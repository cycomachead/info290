"Pours golden with a white head. This is an industrial lager that I used to drink a bit of while i lived in Japan, this one was a gift from the wife when she came back from Japan last summer. It might have stayed a bit long in the can as there is a metallic taste to it. Otherwise there is slight diacetyl. The beer is very light, some hop bitterness and just a little malt sweetness."

"This is a damn fine foreign brew. Thanks Brian and Diana for the travel brew!"
"The previous beer made me a little nervous with its propensity to foam up and overflow, so I went with a more gentle pour on this one. It was still slightly foamy, perhaps due to heat and humidity, but it was under CANtrol all the same. Two fingers of rocky, bone-white head were the result and I watched it as it slowly bubbled and popped its way out of existence. Color was a gorgeous golden-yellow and I could only laugh as Croesus, Mammon and King Midas fought for a drop. Nose was very honey-like, very much like a clean, unadulterated lager. From a CAN?!? I am already a fan. I CANnot tell you how many AALs in a CAN that I have been subhected to and it is never pleasant. Mouthfeel was medium-to-full and I caught a grassy hoppiness that made me think of a GER Pils, but I will buy Dortmunder. Finish was pretty dry, a real gem on this hot, humid day. I really liked the grassy finish and might CANsider it for a lawnmower beer CANdidate."

"Still in Tokyo and back at the hostel enjoying some beer. Poured from a 11.2 oz. can. Has a light golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is very mild, a touch of malts. Taste is also mild, some malts, dry at the finish, lacking in flavor or punch. Feels light in the mouth and overall is a sub par beer."

"O: One of the better macro Japanese beers. Malt forward beer that has great grain notes. It really is refreshing."

"Final Thoughts: I'm finding that the simpler styles of Japanese beer are done well, but not quite well enough to justify their import costs. I mean they solidly thump the macros and a lot of the European import Lagers, but aren't quite as good as local craft offerings. I'd really like to see Sapporo bring some of their other brews over to brew locally. Not sure how they could market it, but I've been a fan."
"Poured a slightly hazed bright yellow with a thin head of moderate retention. Some spotty lacing to it. Aroma was of clove and citrus. Taste was surprising; crisp with a bready note that shifts intio a tangy citrus flavor: lemony-grapefruit. It reminded me of a spiced wheatbeer. This was served very cold at a local Japanese restaurant; the taste definately improved as it warmed."
""
"O - This is the fourth Yebisu brew I've tried and I'm finding that my first drop (the black) is likely to remain my favourite. Similar in some ways to the white label beer but with little to distinguish it as ""Premium"". It's a basic export lager with some ok flavour combinations."
""
"O: Nothing special but not bad... probably would describe it as average for the style. Easy to drink and could be a session beer but personally I don't want to have a lot of this beer (I would save my time/money for something I enjoyed more)."
"O: This beer is easy to drink but the taste isn’t overly special. It’s not that bad compared to some of the other beers in the style."
"Yebisu is one of my favorite canned beers to drink simply because the malty flavor carries through even packaged in such a medium. Often, canned beers lose so much of their magic that is normally found in bottles or especially via tap (take Guinness as a perfect example). However, as far as canned beer goes, Yebisu is amazing. Full of malt, wheat-flavored with a bit of citrus in the aftertaste, this beer goes particularly well with things like Korean BBQ or curry with some spice. I often pour it into a glass, and any pilsner or tulip style glass will do, depending on how much head you want on it. The only negative side to this canned version that does not bother me when it comes from the tap is the excess gas in the beer that translates to some nasty burps. I've had Yebisu in all forms (even from the brewery in Ebisu, Tokyo), and this only seems to happen when I drink it from the can. However, since that does affect my overall image of the beer, I do have to stick with this ranking for now. If you have a chance to have it from the tap, I would recommend it, as it easily would rank a 4+."

"Clean and go down well easy either drinking it alone or pairing with some foods, high drinkability."

"Dry, crisp, and refreshing, with a strong-enough malt body to keep it interesting for an easy-drinking pilsner. Hands-down my favorite mass-produced Japanese beer."
"A crisp, clean, bitter lager. While it's nothing special it is nice and refreshing."
"D: was a decent dortmunder that was drinking really good and went really well paired with some yakitori and sushi."
"About as good as I expected which is just a bit better than Sapporo Premium. I would buy it again if I found it for the same price or cheaper as other similar tasting german or Czech imports we get in dépanneurs here (Bitburger, Konig, Wernesgruner."
"Overall it was fine. Totally average and went well with dinner."
"Drinkable brew. Nice change from the standard Japanese beers. Worth a try."
"Everything else about this lager was terrible: wet-rope aroma, burned veggie taste, sour aftertaste, flat body. Sadly for me, this was the last thing I consumed before leaving Japan. Blech. To be avoided at all costs."
"D: Good"
"Is this really one of the best Japanese lagers? Won't be seeking this one out for another round again."
"Drinkability is pretty high on this one due to its lightness. I'm quite surprised by what I thought would be just your average lager!"
"Overall a pleasant and easy to drink lager."
"M&D: lightly carbonated, light-bodied, the flavour profile gears towards the dry and bitter side of hops not unlike the German Pilsener style. I once tried the bottle version and to my best collection this canned version is not too different - all in all a pretty decently-made dry lager."
"Drinkablity: Very well crafted all-malt beer. Deserves a place alongside the world's great beers."
"D - Overall, doesn't compare to most dortmunders I've tried, but is drinkable in comparison to the adjunct lagers in the states. The bitterness and DMS content is a little much for the style and there is a lack of malt complexity. Will pass on further yebisus."
"D: I've certainly had better Dortmunders, this was a bit of a letdown. Had it with some Chinese food and it seemed to work there."
"If it weren't for the price ($4.99 per bottle) this would likely be a frequent summer purchase for me. Unfortunately I am reviewing this on a cold autumn's day, it would be better appreciated (and possibly have scored higher) in summer."
"i was in japan and did try and find a whole bunch of beers, and recall this one being the best of the bunch. too bad it's rather pricey stateside."
"Very nicely done! Certainly worth trying."
"Good beer though I prefer much more hop bite. Still I would drink this again."
"D - I find Japanese beers as a whole very drinkable due to their light flavors and body."
"My bottle was a strange volume of 334 ml and I liked the large eared fisherman on the label"
"Medium body with some wateriness to the mouthfeel, other than that it's a very easy too drink, sessionable type lager. I prefer it to the canned Sapporo I've had in the past."
"D_Surprisingly not bad. A good choice at many Japanese restaurants or izakayas though a bit more expensive."
"This is a simple, yet flavorful pale lager. Sadly, the high price tag for a single bottle of this will have me choosing Sapporo/Sapporo Reserve over this the next time I want a Japanese lager."
"Make sure to let this one warms up, it's nothing incredibly special, but for a mass-produced beer its pretty respectable."
"Golden colour with a large fluffy white head. Floral aroma with sweet honey. Some caramel and honey in the flavour. A very decent malt profile, that had hints of Dead Guy to it (but with far toned down hoppiness). Medium body with lighter than expected carbonation. This is a very decent offering from a macro, and probably the best beer I've had from a major producer."
"As it says on the label, aroma is mostly pleasant malt with some floral character. Flavour is similiar with rich malt and bittery finish, maybe with some sourness on the back. Overall, very drinkable and refreshing, very good for the mainstream beer."
"It's has a nice malt profile - something you won't find in the rice beers. It also has a slight yeast flavor - something I've never really came across in lagers. It's a unique beer and quite tasty. Enjoyed with some sushi, if every you get the chance."
"Drinkability : pleasant and refreshing beer in Dortmunder-style lager from the Japanese Sapporo"
"Notes: If the price was right this could be a staple sessioner in the beer fridge but at roughly $18 a sixer I'll pass."
"D - Nothing to get too excited about. Just a nice, well balanced and refreshing lager."
"i think this is by far one of the best of the higher end japanese macro lagers."
"Family thought I was weird when I was taking notes on this beer, did not understand the concept"
"A friend brought this to me directly from Tokyo, Japan. This beer was a pale yellow straw color. The head was decent and dissipated quickly. The aroma was faint. The taste brought out a smoky malt. The hops seemed only to be there for bittering...very light hop flavor. The flavor also seemed to bring out the flavor of cigarettes."
"D: Very drinkable. It's a much better beer than your standard Japanese rice lagers."
"The appearance was really good, surprisingly good lacing on the glass and nice dry-looking foam in general. The aroma is neutral malty, pretty good. The flavor was all malt, nice for the style. Very drinkable, I had two in quick succession."
"Good, crisp, & refreshing, but bitter."
"Nice amber color. Smells kinda nutty. Wheaty? Something like that. Before it was even described to me as one of Japan's finer beers, I thought this beer was one of the best I'd had here. Which is of course not saying much. Quite drinkable, and one of the beeriest beers in Japan (as most seem to taste like expired alcoholic tonic water)."
"Pours amber tinted black color with brownish head. Aroma is porterish with some roastyness to it. High carbonation for a dark beer. Taste is on the light side with just hints of dark roasted and chocolate malts, bit of mild hop flavor but with such an overall lightness this beer does not really need a lot of hops. Overall a nice drinkable beer, nothing really special about it but a decent flavor and high drinkability, feels a lot lighter than it looks due to thin body and high carbonation. I could go through a few of these with some Japanese BBQ."
"Then for the first taste - and first surprise. It was actually surprisingly flavoursome. A lot of hops and a fair herby flavour to it. Slightest sourness on the back palatte but there really isn't much of a back palatte anyway so it's quite noticeable. None of this was really expected given the nose and appearance. It didn't really taste like the standard chugging lager I had expected, although there were touches of that flavour in there. I have to say, it's not the most pleasant-tasting beer I've ever drunk, slightly too sour for my taste, not much of an aftertaste and still not as flavoursome as I like. Having said that though, this is worthy of a lot more respect than the watery swills known as Kirin Ichiban, or Yanjing - to name just two. It's not something I'd drink all the time, but it certainly is a respectable drinking lager."
"smooth mouthfeel is fuller than expected, but very welcome. wasnt sure what to expect from this, but a pleasant surprise."
"this is the beer to drink with sushi or other japanese cuisine."
"I picked this up on a layover at Narita airport on my way back to the states from Korea. I loved the fat fisherman in the can design. Poured fairly light, maybe more toward yellow than gold with minimal scent but not grainy or skunky like many Japanese beer. Taste was upbeat and the beer tasted very crisp and clean in the mouth. Looks like they have some quality water supplies at Sapporo after all. A surprisingly good Japanese beer that doesn't offer tons of flavor but is very refreshing and easy to drink. A pleasant goodbye from the land of the rising sun."
"Super Premium Yebisu Stout Draft (everything except 'Yebisu' is a misnomer) grew on me with drinking. It will never make me forget my favorites of the style, but was enjoyable while it lasted. It makes no serious missteps and is worth a look if you happen to run across a bottle."
"Fairly good example of the style. Was sold to me as a stout at RFD's, which I was not happy about when I saw the pour, but I decided to try it anyways. Crisp, slightly dry, nice hop bite at the end. Very pleasant session beer if nothing else, though there's plenty of other beers I'd buy for the price that was charged."
"16 ounce bottle. Not the most interesting beer I have ever had, but if I was in Japan, at least I would know of a beer I might be able to locate that had a bit of flavor."
"The head is dense, the color pale golden with an apparently high level of carbonation. A very tasty brew. The fruityness of peaches and lemon give the beer a very round mouthfeel, with maybe a fig like dryness. Hops encircle the palate in a nicely balanced way. Pretty nice."
"Mouthfeel is fine, but drinkability is no more than average. Not a good beer to pair with spicy food as the sweetness will not help cut the heat."
"Overall drinkability was pretty good, I could have a couple of these, but wouldn't if a different beer was present."
"It tastes great though, with some nice crisp hoppy bitterness and round malty body. There's an extremely sharp carbonation onset--very nice mouthfeel--which changes over to clean hops and then abruptly stops. Very nice, very nice."
"Strangely named, Yesibu (Stout Draft) is a decent beer to pair up with various Asian dishes, particularly spicy ones. By itself, its pretty average."
"Medium straw color, medium head. A medium bodied draft style lager. Nicely malty with a nice hop bite. Clean and crisp taste. Light taste but with some flavor. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and round. Finish is crisp and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly bitter. Nice beer. I don't mean to go on a RANT here, but STOUT DRAFT is confusing!!"
"As mentioned, this has a little more flavor that its brethren, but this is a pretty unremarkable beer. The flavor was crisp, clean, and quite drinkable. I would probably go for this if I see it in a Japanese restaurant."
"White 2 cm head on a yellow gold body. Leafy malty aroma. Reminds me of a restina, firm lasting bitterness, but more than the average Japanese lager. A little husky, rich flavor. Significantly different from the common Japanese swill, but nothing amazing."
"This lager poured a clear, golden yellow color with thick, creamy, white foam that had good staying power and left a coating on the glass. The smell was faint and malty. The taste was light: slightly sweet malt, hints of hops (floral and bitter) in the background. The mouthfeel was clean and smooth with medium-light body and medium carbonation. The aftertaste was mildly hoppy. This was an easy-drinking lager on tap."
"Poured a deep yelow color with minimal head,smel of pretty much nothing maybe a tad of sweetness.Taste was malty and maybe some apple tartness but pretty weak in the flavor department,highly carbonated and a little thin on the mouth.Was expecting more not to impressed with this."
"Honey colored, slightly cloudy, hardly any head or flavor really. Wasn't too bad once it warmed up a little. I like Japanese beer but this one is not a quality brew. Served it's purpose which was to wash down some Japanese food. I can't say enough enough about this beer for the required 250 characters."
"Not bad but not special in any way, other than being an all malt Japanese macro brew."
"Pours a medium golden color with a bubbly white head that fades into a thin lace. Nose is stale grains and a bit of cooked corn. Taste is a bit of sweet malts up front followed by some notes of wet hay and musty grains. Some mildly bitter hops are present in the end leading to a dry finish. Better than many other Asian beers Ive had, its still no better than an average brew."
"Thick white head, leaves a lot of lace, golden color. Nose is clearly skunky and not stout-like. Indeed the label has stout draft but this is a whole new definition of stout - not dark nor medium/heavy bodied. Label is veeery misleading and won't be purchased again even at $2,75 for 16oz."
"I smell muchu roastiu nutsu, along with proof of lager. The taste starts off with candy giving way to a sourish, nutty middle. The finish is tangy and slightly sour. This is actually pretty darn good."
"Yebisu Stout Draft: Served from a fairly fancy sixteen-ounce bottle. Stout draft? No, not Guinness, but rather a darkish gold color under a very impressive thick white foamy head. Left some fairly thick lacing down the side as well. The aroma is fairly impressive, some skunk, some malts. The taste is impressive, and hard to compare to other beers. I can taste somewhat of a pronounced floral/vegetable taste, which follows up closely with bready malts. At the end, it is fairly clean, with a tiny bit of hops."
"The 1 Pint bottle has particulates in it leading me to believe it to have some bottle conditioning. Pours golden with just a hint of amber to the color. The Head is thick and luxurious settling quickly to a fine lace on the glass with the faintest hint of tan color. The nose is reminiscent of very fresh and bitter hops. The nose released from the head is quite good. The 1st sip is malty and sweet. This is quite good. Malt with hops and a distinctive bitter aftertaste. Well balanced beer though the finish builds to a powerful bitter. But I like Bitter so Hoo Rahhh! Mouthfeel is like liquid silk. Verrrrry smooooooth beer. I am so happy I tried this one. Not quite a 5 but damn close - especially for an Asian beer."
"The name itself is quite a misnomer, calling it a stout, when it's anything but that. It's mildly spritzy, almost fruity, and delivers a heck of a punch in the aftertaste department. It's not a beer that I'm wild about simply drinking on its own, but as an accompaniment with some great food, this beer is definitely a winner."
"The average pour a golden yellow, the head modest in size, bright white, frothy, the lace a fine sheet to coat the glass. Nose is all malt, lightly sweet, crisp and clean. Sweet malt start, top cadaverous, finish is strikingly acidic, hops apropos to the style, dry aftertaste."
"Medium golden color with a decent snow-white head and spectacular clouds of rising bubbles, lots of thick, sticky lace. Nice aroma of sweet malts, grain, and hops. Taste begins with grain flavors and a sting of carbonation, mild bitterness and dry characteristic appear midway through. Slight sweetness and a bit of metallic bitterness bring the taste to a close. An eminently refreshing and drinkable beer."
"Anyway, this is definitely the best Asian beer I have come across so far, but still not a great brew. Still, I think Sapporo may be on to something. Pours a very orange color with a medium off-white head. Medium sweet malt aroma. Lightly sweet malt flavor and medium effervescence. There was some hops in the finish but everything seemed understated about this beer. Nothing really stood out, but if I am in Japan I will order this before a Sapporo or Kirin."
"Pours a golden straw color with a decent white head that sinks quickly and lots of yeasties floating around as I didn't know the beer was bottle conditioned when I was pouring it.  Slightly sweet malt smell with a husky grain quality to it.  The beer has a very dry and grainy start to it that makes it rather refreshing and quenching.  The brew retains this excellent dryness until a short and sweet malt burst at the end comes through.  It is then back to the dryness for the slight lingering finish however.  The graininess provides a very dry and crisp mouthfeel which makes the brew very refreshing and very drinkable.  I can imagine that this would go excellent with sushi and other japanese foods."
"The ""all-malt"" on the label is a misnomer to a true malt lover. Guess yebisu is a malty beer compared to other to japanese zymurgical efforts.. this beer is dry, with a light malty mouth taste and feel. The hops too provide a mild aftertaste to the palate. All in all, a decent refreshing flavor. Served ice cold, this light beer could be a thirst quencher."
"This is by far the best beer I've had in its style... dry, as you would expect... malty, and refreshing.  Deep gold, with a very thin head... malty smell and flavor, with a balancing hop bitterness.  Thin to medium mouthfeel, and highly carbonated.  There just might be no better compliment to a good sushi dinner."
"Like everyone else, I had this at a Japanese restaurant last night.  It was definately an above average lager.  What struck me was how different (in a good way) a mass-produced lager can be without the use of adjuncts.  Hoppier, maltier, creamier than any US macro.  Enjoyable."
"I didn't even know this beer existed until last night at a sushi restaurant.  The label caught my eye:  ""all malt"" making it unusual for Japanese beer.  I tried it and was very pleasantly surprised. It's darker in color than other Japanese lagers.  The hop aroma is actually fairly strong and the malt smell is there too.  It's has a pleasantly sweet taste and is not as dry as other Japanese beers.  This is a surprisingly good beer.  Seek it out next time you're out for sushi."
"Nice lager, had a lot worse. Floral nose, creamy palet. Not bad but prety average."
"Thanks to Yukiko Ueyama of Sapporo USA, Inc. for the fresh samples."
