"Overall - Nice refreshing beer.  My first dortmunder, it reminds me of a lot of European lagers I've had over the years.  Nothing especially distinctive, but well executed.  4 paws."
""
""
"If you enjoy a classic lager, you will enjoy this.  However, it does not distinguish itself dramatically from a decent, cheaper, American version."
"Overall, this beer is one of the many reasons that I love German lagers. Incredibly delicious, light and easy to drink, and smooth on the palate are just a few of the reasons that the Germans have their reputation for beer, and this beer is stellar on all counts."

"Love this beer, reminds me of Germany. You could sit in a bier garden and trink bier after bier after bier of this clean, crisp , light refreshing beer"
""
""
"Taste:  Very faint.  There is a tiny bit of spice, alcohol, and crackers.  This is exceptionally drinkable.  It is very soft."

"O- A lager done in the proper fashion, but it's still not something I'd like to revisit and surely not a flavor I crave.  I suppose, in certain situations (hot weather, beach, sporting event), I would enjoy it's immense drinkability.  But I'm really just ticking this to cover the Dortmunder/Export Lager style and move on."

"Pours a medium-light gold with a thick white head. The head settles down and leaves some nice sticky lacing. The aroma is clean and crisp, with notes of light bread and noble hops. The taste is equally crisp, with both qualities of the aroma balancing each other quite well. The body is both light and full, with a little carbonation and a nice crisp finish. An excellent lager."

"this beer was recommended by a customer at a large store in Boulder Colorado. he had 8 of them in his basket so I suspected something was up and ask him his reply was that he felt it was one of the best Czech pilsners in the world. that's the kind of tip you go with and I did nice 4.0 well done"

"Medium body, medium carbonation, creamy smooth, no warmth, no astringency."

"Great hops, a great Dortmunder."
"price point - $3.59/16.9 oz bottle"
"Overall : a good beer in the style Dortmunder."
"Great beer I so regret never having purchased the countless times it was within my reach. Highly recommended."
"Overall: Another great beer from Ayinger and one I would highly recommend to lager lovers everywhere. This is a magnificent beer to emphasize how flavorful lagers can be- the bready bitterness makes this a fantastic beer. Would highly recommend."

"O - A solid beer. not as good as others from this great brewery, but still enjoyable."
""
""
""
""
"O: Overall It was a good beer. It has a good hop character which keeps the beer interesting, while being light enough to make it an easy drinker. I didn't get any grain flavor, which is the biggest disappointment. It could be a freshness issue, but there is no bottled date or import date listed on the label. There was also a slight harshness to the beer. Even still, It was an enjoyable beer to drink."

"one of the great german lagers here, light and fizzy and sessionable forever. pale yellow in color with as much frantic carbonation as a well shaken soda. inch of white head rests on top. nose is like cheerios, cereal grains, although light, dominant. bittering hops only, but they add a layer, timeless familiar german lager yeast. this is a beer, that while new to me, is comfortable and familiar. this is what i want when i seek a german lager. ultra refreshing, light but not wanting for flavor at all, no stale malt flavors, and a clean finish that isnt too dry. its just right, perfect for the coming warmer weather, and somehow incredibly cheap to buy in colorado at the moment. extremely high carbonation level would be distracting in another beer, but it works wonders for this already airy lager. german lager exemplified here for me, i am going to load up on this later in the week i think, very impressed with a style here that doesnt always do it for me."

"Great Dortmunder that happens to be my favorite brew, so I might be a little biased. The biggest surprise is the first sip. It's very unique. Like the foam, that stays and lingers inviting your lips to kiss it again and again. Has to be chilled well. May be a little too sweet, but Great for relatively inexpensive beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"Finishes dry and crisp, quite bitter with some flinty minerals very apparent. You know this is an authentic Dortmunder from this mineral effect that provide some bite and a dry mouthfeel. Whoa. Certainly this feature differentiates this brew from the other German and Czech lagers I've tried to date, including mass-produced examples of the style like DAB, as do the faintly nutty malts. Closest thing I've found to a legit Dortmunder in Canada outside of homebrew circles."
"Not a fan of the lager style, but this one is very good; 1000x better than any BMC, very drinkable"
""
"Overall: This lager was delicious. Very traditional, clean, and good."
"O: Im not a huge fan of the style but this is a very good beer. Definitely worth trying, and I enjoyed it more than I thought I would."
""
""
""
""
""
"So drinkable. Easy to kill a few bottles of this."
""
""
"Mouthfeel is great. Crisp, light and refreshing feel balances the sweet and sticky malt components nicely."
""
""
"O: Tasty lager is tasty. Okay, MAYBE it could be a bit hoppier. Now that I'm done nitpicking, I'd just like to say even though it isn't mega-cheap ($3/500ml isn't BAD, though), I'd gladly buy it again for drinking duty in hot weather."
""
""
"Pours a hazy straw color with a big head that fades to decent lacing. Aroma of malt, fruit, flowery with a bit of yeast. Taste of malt, fruity and a bit of spice in the background. Mild bitterness and a dry finish. Medium body, smooth and refreshing with a nice balance. Enjoyable beer that goes down easy."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"It's a nice beer with a mature profile, balancing sweetness and bitterness for a nice flavor profile. Very versatile. Sessionable yet substantively satisfying. Great brewery."
""
"Super clear golden straw color with a lovely cakey white head. Big chunks of fluff stick to the glass once the massive head settles down to a reasonable 1/4"" foam pile. Aroma is pilsner malty with a light topping of lemon and flowers. A hint of meaty spice. Taste is full of chewy malt and dry with zesty lemon and herbal hop. Soapy floral included. Overall a clean, simple, and very nicely crafted lager. I'd love to try this fresh at the brewery someday."
""
"Overall, I liked this beer the more I drank it. Malty and light."
""
"Overall this has some great flavors not typically found on this side of the Atlantic. The malts and yeast blend together very nicely and make for a wonderful mouthfeel."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: MUST TRY. I love surprises like this. Great food and fish beer."
"Pours out a clear, bright, pale gold. Smells of hay, grain, and bread. Flavor is of crackery malts and crisp grains. So very dry and crisp. Fresh, herbal, minty hops are very faint in the finish. Mouthfeel is light and bubbly. This is delicious and refreshing. This truly is craft at its finest."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Taste is also bready and malt forward, with a crisp dry finish. Lingering noble hop bitterness in the aftertaste. Very clean and flavorful, light bodied and highly drinkable. Made a great pairing with weinerschnitzel and spaetzle at Laschet's. Simplicity is often underrated, and this is a shining example of how good a simple beer can be."
""
""
"Overall a perfect beer that keeps you wanting more. Hop fans will likely want to pass on this one but I would drink this anytime. I do wish it had a freshness date though."
"Sampled 9/2/13 and chilled down to 36 degrees in my beer cooler. Poured into a pilsner glass. Came in a 500ml bottle. Pours a light gold in color with a 1-finger+ of a white head. Leaves a lot of lacing when sipped. many streaming bubbles were seen rising from the bottom and sides of the glass BUT the carbonation was actually perfect. The aroma is of grain, malt with a hint of citrus. The taste is pretty close with a nice 'sweet' flavor really coming through. Very pleasant and easy to drink. No bad aftertaste."
""
""
"O: A very enjoyable and drinkable brew. Quite simple, but it's a good simple. Good price at just over $3 for a 500 mL bottle, so I can definitely see myself drinking more of this"
""
""
""
"O: A disappointing offering from a sometimes excellent brewery."
"O: nice Bavarian lager with clean palate"

"Mouthfeel: slightly thin, but smooth and clean"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Would be a typical, forgettable light lager were it not for the buoyant breadiness present in both the smell and taste."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - This is a nice easy drinking German lager. The hops could be a little more pronounced, but the overall flavor is nice although a little too sweet."
""
""
""
"Overall, a very refreshing beer and masterfully done. It seems that no American brewery can approach the crispness of the German brewers when it comes to this style of beer. Definitely one to come back to."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"My first try of a Dortmunder lager, so I don't have much to base it on. Pretty solid, a very tasty lager that has hints of an IPA in it. Definitely worth another buy."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I'da guessed this was about 3% or so. 5.2%, huh? Okay, I'll take it."
""
"Pours a crystal clear light golden color with a decent sized brilliant white head that slowly dissipates to a cap on top. Smells of grainy malt like the mash tun on brew day with a light floral hop to balance. The flavor is sweet and malty with honey like grains and light earthy spice hops to counter. Medium body with a moderate level of carbonation and a sweet mouthfeel. Nice clean well made lager that I could literally smell all day."
""
""
""
""
"This is great. One of the best lagers I've ever had; maybe the best. The taste and smell are about identical. It's a warm taste with a distinct bitterness. Dry. Excellent to the end. I would get this again."
""
""
""
""
"Golden straw colored beer with a fizzy, thin pale white head. Smells kinda skunky and grassy with a bit of a sweet malt undertone and some honey scents as it warms. Initial impression is a big carbonic bite on the front of the tongue. The initial ""bite"" is so big, there is no real flavor impression until the finish, which seems very balanced with a bit of sweet and bitter. The malts sweetness has a flavor somewhere between caramel and honey, but very mild. The bitterness is somewhat herbal and has a minerally-like bite. A crisp, drinkable lager with a touch of malt sweetness balanced by a persistent herbal hop bitterness."
"O- easydrinking, but just complex enough to keep the mind thinking."
""
"Pours a clear, gold color. 1/4 inch head of a white color. Good retention and decent lacing. Smells of pale malt, slight hops, slight sweet malt, and a hint of minerals. Fits the style of a Dortmunder / Export Lager. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level. There is also a noticeable dryness. Tastes of pale malt, slight sweet malt, slight hop, and a hint of minerals. Overall, decent appearance and feel. Otherwise, the aroma, blend, and body are simple, but characteristically accurate."
"-Overall 4.00: In spite of its generic lager look and somewhat generic bouquet, this beer is a surprise and rises well above it other Teutonic Lager kin. This is really sort of a ""long boil"" lager: normal lager characteristics are heightened and accentuated in this brew. Recommended to all lager lovers and beer drinkers in general."
""
""
""
""
"O: Optimal warm-weather beer, if a little pricey for generally cheaper summer styles. Still, this exceeded expectations and I'll buy it again."
""
""
""

"Easy drinking. Will have again in summer"

"Overall another tasty, understated beer from Brauerei Aying. All that's missing is the bier garten."
""
""
""
"Pours a hazed bright golden color with a quickly fading large white frothy head. Nose of bready malt, grass, lemon, straw and green apple. Medium full body with high, fine carbonation and a pleasant sweet and bready flavor. Straw, grass and lemon with faint noble hops providing bitterness in the finish. Very good."
""
""
"On tap at Kickbacks in Jax. Poured into a snifter. Clear, pale yellow in color. White head, moderate retention, with soapy, then clear lacing. Aroma includes some malt sweetness and a touch of apple cider. Taste is mildly sweet, almost a pilsner-like yeastiness taste, and maybe some residual sweetness on the back of the taste reminescent of apple pie. Odd and unexpected. Anyway, a very easy to drink lager, despite it sweet qualities and as usual, like everything else from Ayinger, delicious."
""
""
""
""
"Notes: Really enjoyed this one. Better beer on draft than in a bottle. Great Dortmunder."
"Overall a great drinkable beer."
""
""
"overall, plain, generic, slightly sour, but very drinkable in succession. love the ayinger brand, but this is one of the 'plainer' versions. got a celebrator waiting for me in the frig for next weekend when i do my (usual) foray into dopplebock land...."
""
""
""
"A decent lager overall. I liked the balanced malt and hop mixture. A fine offering..."
""
"This had body and depth of flavours: I really enjoyed it. Second half of the bottle was taken with some 'Emmental Cheese, home made Green Tomato Chutney and dry salted biscuits, the beer complimented the food very well in deed."
""
""
""
""
"This is a very clean and crisp beer with some nice floral notes."
""
"D- A real beauty for me. Crisp and refreshing with a super hop malt balance for the style. Could drink all day long."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"D - Great balance and hard to think of a better thirst quencher. If only more lagers were like this one..."
"Medium-light body, medium carbonation, ridiculously easy drinking. Tossed back a few of these with some pretzels and football on Sunday, all is right with the world for a few hours."
""
""
"O- a clean and enjoyable lager."
""
""
""
""
"O - This is far from a style I typically enjoy. This does some things well, as far exceeds what it looks like: a light-lager with a massive pale head."
""
"Taste: Slight pilsner taste with a little bit of a bitterness at first. The aftertaste is somewhat bready which I really like."
"Overall, this is a very flavorful and quaffable German lager. There is nothing complex but there are subtle flavors that keep this one interesting."
"It's a very enjoyable beer!"
""
"O-This is not the biggest or most complex beer that you will come across, but for what it intends to be, this ayinger is outstanding."

"500 ml bottle into pilsener glass, no bottle dating. Pours lightly hazy golden straw color with a nice 1-2 finger fairly dense white head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Slight spotty lacing clings to the glass, with a small amount of carbonation streaming up. Aromas of lemon, pear, pepper, grape, herbal, floral, grass, bread, and light earthy spiciness. Very nice aromas with good complexity, balance, and strength. Taste of lemon, bread, pear, grass, bread, pepper, grape, herbal, floral, cracker, and light earthiness. Lingering notes of bread, light fruit, grass, herbal, pepper, and earth on the finish for a bit. Nice balance and complexity of flavor; fairly dry on the finish as expected. No cloying flavors at all. Medium carbonation and body; with a crisp and lightly prickly mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with pretty much no warming noticed at all after the finish. Overall this is an excellent Dortmunder lager. Nice flavor balance and complexity; very crisp and smooth to drink. Highly enjoyable as expected from this brewery."
""
"O - Smooth European lager, not quite as much hop taste as I'd like, but the clean flavor makes for a great beer on a warm day. The excessive foam is a little off putting, but an otherwise solid beer."
""
""
"Thin-bodied. Light showing of booze. Amply dry in the finish. Beefy carbonation that cleanses the palate after each glug."
"Note: There was still a bit left in my glass when it warmed, and the characteristics were much bolder and more complex. Pity there was not even half a mouthful's worth. This is one lager I'll need to try again at warmer temps, because I think it has much better things to offer."
"Jahrhundert-Bier is quite pale in color with an ever-so-slight haze to it. Under light the beer is a light gold, straw-blond. Bubbles flow to the top with the playfulness of champagne. It smells clean, bready, with a very slight herbal sweetness. It doesnâ€™t so much pique your intellectual interest as it does lure you in with its back-to-basics approach. As I am an American, I have certain built-in expectations with beers of such a light color. Any expectation of thinness or boredom, though, disappears in the first taste as the full-bodied character of the helles immediately occupies the appropriate senses. It is refreshing, drinkable. Itâ€™s malty without being sticky. It is the epitome of well-balanced. I want a liter or three in a giant glass mug while I peer over the landscape on a cool summer afternoon. I am in a state of GemÃ¼tlichkeit."
""
""
""
"500ml bottle $3.49 Super light yellow color, average white head. Smells lager-like if that makes any sense, not bad but nothing enticing. Flavor is very much lager like almost like what a pilsener taste like but more. Crisp, easy to drink, refreshing but not something I would reach for over a pilsener or kolsch. I did kill this quite fast so it is a pretty decent beer."

"500ml bottle. Tall Lager glass. Enjoyed on mayÂ´12.Pale golden color, crystal clear appearance. White, close & dense, froth. Thick layer, fairly well retention, crown. Floral hop & Noble aromas. Well balanced Malts & hops. Medium body, soft carbonation. Smooth mouthfeel. Refreshing & easy drinkable. Close to style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Tasting the beer, the flowery hops are up front. Bread and a little tart follow in the middle, while the malt backbone is towards the end. Very balanced and very drinkable. A very nice thirst quencher."
"if there is heavens manna on earth, this is it. everything about this beer is glorious."
""
""
""
""
"O: I'm not the biggest lover of lagers, but this is a drinkable, easy to like beer."
""
""
"A fairly simple beer, but enjoyable."
""
"Straw yellow in color with perfect clarity. Poured with a huge soapy white foam that slowly dissipated to a wispy cap. Biscuity and bready malt aromas with hints of earth grass and floral hops. Smooth delicate feel and a surprisingly thicker, fuller feel given the appearance. Pleasant delicate carbonation. Bready and biscuit flavors up front with light, tangy, spicy hoppiness lazily carrying through the middle to a crisp biscuit finish. Maltiness was very much like a pilsener, but with a more delicate feel and less hop character. Refreshing and enjoyable nonetheless."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is my first experience with the style. Based on the description of the style, I thought I would like it, but didn't find this offering terribly interesting. I'll have to give it another shot."
""
""
""
""
"The beer had a light feel to it, as expected. Overall, this is a quality brew and one that I will enjoy many more times in the future."
""
"O: A simple beer for sure, not overly complex but the drinkability is off the charts. Very smooth and clean tasting. No bitterness. A touch of sweetness. Nothing offensive about it at all. I really enjoyed drinking it - not every beer has to be a barrel aged 13% monster."
""
""
""
""
""
"It's neutral, and a benchmark for Lagers. Happy to have tried it. Of course I'll make it a point to avoid it in the future."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Overall, this is an excellent German Pale Lager, maybe a bit on the sweet side for me, but the taste, feel, and appearance lack any real flaws."
"Overall - This is a pretty good lager.. brewed under the purity law, pretty interesting."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Light and drinkable for a lager I will put it on tap right now!"
"These aren't my flavors, but this one does them really well. This is exceptional for a l ager but it is still a lager."
"O: Great example of the style and well put together. I thoroughly enjoyed this beer"
"not that ive read others review maybe i got an old bottle or bad bottle. so i might be getting another to rereview"
"A subtle haze lays over a golden yellow body. The haze give the yellow a small amount of orange color. Head is minimal but the ring around the glass is thick and stays the whole way down. Nose has a light yeast character that meshes well with some grassy/spicy hops. Light, doughy malt character is in equal proportion to the hops and yeast. Flavor has a malty sweetness upfront but switches right over to some fruity grass and pale malts. Finishes with that fruity/grass hop character playing a big role and lingering. The malty dough sweetness carries throughout the finish even with a big dryness at the end. The balance of malts and hops from start to finish is extremely satisfying."
"Another fantastic beer from Aying who rarely goes wrong. It can't compete with some of the bigger styles, but it's probably the best I've had in the style."
"Overall very interesting and very tasty with a hint of lemon goodness!"
"Overall / Drinkability: A good German lager and very drinkable. I could easily have another one. It's a beer that is enjoyable in its simplicity - I feel I could have plenty of it and not get bored of it. But - it's not a deep or amazing beer, just good."
"Poured a 1.5"" white head. Hazy light lemonade colored body. Smells of malt, nuts, spice, and a little of fruit esthers. Taste is the same plus it adds on a nice long refreshing zing in the finish along with lager crispness. Certainly a worthy lager, one both beer afficianados and even BMC drinkers can enjoy together."
"Crisp and bubbly light-bodied mouthfeel which comes across with a clean bite. Overall, this makes for a tasty lager but it wasn't quite what I expected, as the continental hop profile was stronger (almost like a pils) than expected. Recognizing it for what it is though, this is a damn fine hoppy lager."
"Overall: This is a very straightforward German lager that is ideal to have with almost any meal, especially one that is bready. Its recipe may be simple â€“ and not usually what I drink â€“ but it provides immediate gratification and quality that any beer should have."
"Pours a clear light yellow with a 1 inch white head that fades to a thin film. Random spots of lace dot the glass on the drink down. Smell is of bread with some grass and citrus notes. There is also a honey aroma coming off this beer as it warms. Taste is exactly like the smell, even with the honey notes. Very refreshing flavors on the palate. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp and clean mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good lager from Ayinger and my first of the style. I would get this one again in the future for sure."
"A nice beer, if you're in the mood for a lager."
"D: very clean and refreshing gold lager from Aying."
"Taste is very well balanced, it's light and crisp with a nice light hop bite and slightly spicy yeast note on the finish. The mouthfeel is nice and full, smooth and a bit sharp. very well done."
"O - Another decent Ayinger. Try one if you're in the mood for a good malty lager."
"Overall: Just a great example of the German brewing tradition that is widely overlooked these days"
"I am not sure if I have had this before, but I was craving a German Lager today, and this was the first bottle that caught my eye. Poured in to a Sam Adams Noble Pils glass, it comes out a clear golden straw color, with a finger of white heading, and a lot of tiny carbonation bubbles shooting to the top of the glass. The nose comes in with lots of grain husk and a certain mineral quality. Huge malty grain in the flavor, with bittering hops giving it a nice edge. Mouthfeel is light, crisp and entirely refreshing. It strikes me as a beer I could sit and drink all day. A true gem of a beer here."
"overall; a very drinkable and tasty brew. Definitely a benchmark for the style, nearly flawless with a malt profile that is strong and grainy, without becoming sweet...amazing and what this style is all about....well done! Just for fun, eat some MÃ¼nchen malts, appreciate the flavor, cleanse the palate, and try this beer."
"cheers"
"Radiant straw-yellow with an adequate cap of white foam. Grain and hops seem to be neck and neck with the former providing a complex grainy, husky, and bready base for the latter's beautiful blend of Easter grass, lemon, wildflowers, and micro-herbs, while finishing with a touch of honey that softens. The essence of an early spring meadow trapped into a beer. Gorgeous. And by far the most excellent example of the style I've come upon."
"Clear pale yellow in color with a full, stable, dirty white head. Smells malty with subtle clove, grain, and a pinch of lemon. Tastes malty and lemony with a backslpash of orange and a light hop finish. Clean and light bodied. Well-balanced and smooth. This is simply a sharp dressed lager."
"Notes: Overall it's a very good easy drinking beer with excellent balance."
"500 mL from WF Arlington"
"Slainte!"
"The taste falls along similar lines--there's some bread and grain up front followed by a smooth bitterness. The bitterness comes toward the finish and doesn't rally come along with much hop flavor. Good balance between the malt and hops. Drinks quite well. This would be a great brew on a hot summer day."
"An awesomely flavorful lager. I wish this came in 6-packs, it would make a great session beer."
"M-"
"this is a great lager that I will be drinking again, this is a great brew in the dead of winter I can't imagine how smooth this would be under a summer sun"
"Drinkability: A tasty beer, but I don't think it fits this style very well."
"D: An exceptionally drinkable lager, with considerable flavor to boot. I would recommend this to any that believe lagers to be flavorless."
"Flavor is also bready but with a less characterful and fresh impact than the nose. Big and flavorful malt character with strong biscuity malt. Clean and full finish with a low enough impact to be incredibly drinkable. Mouthfeel is light and crisp but with a full mid-palate. For a pale colored, low abv euro lager, this is impressively deep and flavorful."
"Either way, it's a pretty drinkable and basic German lager. Due to their purity laws that restricts ingredients they can use, a lot of these beers end up tasting somewhat alike. Drinkability doesn't get much better though. I know some people won't like how light the flavors are, though."
"First, I'm quite confused how only a 5.5% ABV beer has the alcohol burn of beers >9%? Second, I'm a huge fan of Ayinger's Celebrator and a few others I've sample but this Jahrhundert seems to miss the boat entirely and should be discontinued. The only positive thing I can say about this beer is the head retention continued for the full 12 oz session in my pint glass. The starting head was only 1 finger thick but held. But you drink a beer not stare at it like a piece of art (although I think all of us beer geeks prefer looking at a fine beer in glass over most artwork). Verdict: stay away from this one!"
"Overall Ayinger Jahrhundert Bier is very sessionable, although the aftertaste is a little odd in flavor. This would seem to be a great transition beer for a person just starting a better beer journey, or anyone who has not had a Dortmunder before."
"500 ml bottle. Pours straw with a foamy, white head and lots of carbonation. Aroma is of light floral hops, hay and some bready malt. Fuller body than a look might suggest, quite smooth. Taste is sweet, bready malt in the beginning then light herbal, floral hops kick in overpowering the palate. Long dry finish. This Ayinger I can skip next time."
"Verdict: Really poor effort and not worth trying."
"D: 4"
"This beer was a clear light golden yellow color with a fair amount of carbonation. The aroma was pleasant and not overpowering. It had a slight citrus scent. The taste was very crisp, clean, and highly drinkable. It is smooth to drink. I would drink this beer again, but it is not one of my favorite lagers."
"Not my favorite style of beer, but drinkable."
"As said above, strong malty body worthy of export."
"Another light, clear, barely yellow beer. The head is just a thin white sheet over the top. The nose is crisp, tart, pilsner-like and extremely light. It taste a little sour with some skunkieness. Not my style beer and a little unpleasant. Not much of a finish and what is there is not that desirable. Just not a lot to say about this experience. Maybe I got a bad bottle. I'll have to give it another try at a later date?"
"D-I just saw this on the shelves and figured it would be fresh and it was....tasty, tasty lager..."
"Drinkability: A refreshing beer that goes down smooth. It is easy to drink. I was expecting something a little more complex but very good overall. I would drink again."
"Drink- In the words of Chip Diller, ""Thank You Sir, May I have another"""
"This beer reminded me of a German pilsner, but maybe that's due to my lack of experience in the styles. I'd like to try another one in the future."
"D-it needs to come in the 16oz. bottle because nothing less would be satisfying. it goes down so easily and satisfying!"
"Pours a transparent golden yellow color with a tall white head. The head is tall enough that it gets in your nose a little when you take the first sip, thats a good sign for a great beer. Smells refreshingly hoppy, i can smell some citrus and yeast in there too. The taste is similar, light fresh hops, a little grain, taste is definitely one of the strongest suites. Mouthfeel is medium with high carbonation. Overall, its a great lager, something I would consider drinking again."
"Really good German lager here, and a cheap one at that. I think this just found a regular spot in my beer fridge."
"D: As a beginner to the style, I'd say this balances somewhere between a hefeweizen and saison. Fantastic beer."
"D: A refreshing beer from Ayinger. Solid dortmunder."
"A decent lager. It has good balance and goes down smooth."
"Drinkability: Very straightforward, but not exactly something I expect a brewer to make for a centenary celebration. Though I was hoping for something bolder and more complex, Jahrhundert-Bier is a good brew."
"Almost no hop bitterness, but hop flavor is clear and present."
"very high. A light bodied brew with very good flavor. would love to have this in a big german krug."
"True to style, but I think I enjoyed their other brews I have tried more. Good summer/grass cutting beverage."
"D - very classic bavarian beer flavours with a nice feature of maltiness, the dry crispy finish leaves me craving more, a very chugable brew"
"Looks like a macro but has much more flavor for such a pale light-bodied beer. Leave it to hundreds of years of German brewing to get it right."
"I was blown away with the quality of this brew! when asked about it i normally respond with something along the lines of ""this is what Grolsch & heineken want to be when they grow up."" while the styles are different, i think this an easy step for those interested in growing from those examples"
"Cheers!"
"Ayinger Jahrhundert bier was a slightly hazy pale golden color with a large white head with good retention and lacing. The smell was bready malt with some light citrus. The taste was very good and well balanced between the sweet malts and hop bitterness. It had a nice dry finish. It was medium bodied with a very fine carbonation, very smooth and nice. This is a highly drinkable beer that is definitely worth trying."
"Fairly drinkable, although a little more robust and heavier than a regular lager."
"A hearty pour brings 2"" of bubbly eggshell head from this clear yellow brew. Nose is semi-sweet, a little lemon and skunk, similar to a decent pilsner. Taste is much the same. On the tongue it's a little fizzy until it warms up a bit. Also as it warms a bit of metallic aftertaste develops. Mediocre overall."
"One of the best Munich Helles I have had and true to style in every way."
"D: Light and crisp. Flavor is almost so light there's nothing there. This is listed as a Dortmunder but the label says Helles and the character more closely resembles a helles so thats what I assumed it to be. A decent brew overall."
"D- unashamed, and upon ayinger's nutsack, i plege my allegiance to this brewery. if i ever find myself myself in germany i would probably fall to my knees. drinkability is beyond compare and i glorify this brew as such. hands down my favorite brewery and another stellar offering to hit on par with oktoberfest, weiss, and dunkel. many thanks."
"Very light haze, yellow gold colour with a thin white cap. Looks nice. Good aroma, malty with spicy hops, lemons, a bit floral. Bitterness was well balanced and lingered in the finish with a citrus/lemon and spicy character. Malty sweet up front, a bit floral. Medium bodied with plenty of carbonation, a bit more creamy than crisp, fairly dry. Quite tasty and very clean. This beer has lots of flavour but stays refreshing."
"Pours a beautiful crystal clear yellowish gold color with a soft pillowy head that leaves a little lacing. Smells exactly like a munich helles lager which its stated as that on the label but here its an export lager. whatever. Really reminds me of augustiner helles from when i was in germany. has the bright fresh acidity with german malt characteristic that jumps at you. Tastes really clean, crisp and focused. this beer is meant to be drank in mass quantaties for sure. next time i will pour 2 into my MASSkrug. Mouthfeel is spot on with a nice sweet finish. Drinkability is high as well and this really should be the go to session/summer brew."
"D: This is a great German lager. Great flavor and highly drinkable. The Bavarians really know how to make great beer."
"D: The beer goes down very easy and can be considered sessionable."
"D: very easy, as are most german lagers."
"Drinkability: This is a nicely drinkable beer for both a meal and an evening spent with friends. I definitely found one sip followed another quite easily and I'm sure I'll be having this one again."
"Usually I go for hops but I love this malt monster. Pours hazy golden with a nice whitish head. Taste is smooth, mellow, bready, rich thick malt. Our local Indian restaurant serves this and indeed it tastes like a malty Indian brew, I think it's Kingfisher, but much better. Drank this one at a Vietnamese restaurant on San Francisco Bay and it turns out an Indian fellow from Mumbai was sitting next to me drinking the same beer. He liked it a lot too."
"this is like a really good version of Heineken."
"O: A nice example of the style. Could use a richer malt character, but well balanced."
"A very good lager (rated to style) - Ayinger rarely disappoints."
"Clean crisp medium body with a nice balance of pilsner malt, citrus and earthy hops, crisp light fruit and grass/straw notes. Sweet with hints of apple and pear along with subtle citrus notes as well as some banana and a tangy dry finish. Well balanced and pretty drinkable."
"Juicy, refreshing mouthfeel - again, much more substantial than it looks. Delicious!"
"Medium bodied, smooth and tingly. A good substantial feel and a nice drinkable export lager."
"Nice golden color, slightly cloudy with lacing throughout. Smells like honey, lemons. Taste: smooth, with hints of honey, citrus, grass. Some carbonation but a nice match with flavorings, with an overall result of a very drinkable beer. Low alcohol content makes it a great choice for a session beer. Would be excellent with fish, cheese or fruit."
"Bottle, home. Very good malty German lager. Pours a pale yellow with a good white head. The aroma has lots of doughy malt and a good dose of floral and grassy noble hops. The flavor is malty lager heaven. The malt tastes like sweet, yeasty bread, and the hops are crisp. The beer is quite refreshing and tastes wonderfully fresh. You can almost imagine green hop cones and fresh barley as you drink it. I would love to see more American breweries attempt lagers like this."
"D: This is a great example of the style and quite refreshing."
"Delighitful Lager. Definitely worth a buy. Even better post mowing the lawn or washing the car in the warm sun."
"This brewery makes some good stuff, I haven't had a beer from them I didn't like yet."
"F: Semi dry with lingering wheat and toasty malts. A nice lingering good lager flavor. Crisp and clean finish. A light banana lingering as well. Another amazing Bavarian lager from Ayinger. I really need to take a trip out to Bavaria!"
"Drinkability: this is a nice, refreshing, drinkable lager. I'm glad I picked this up and now I really want to try other examples of the style."
"As usual, Ayinger has done a solid job at crafting a solid example of the style they're going for. I'm not the biggest fan of light lagers, but if you're going to tie me up and force one down my throat, I definitely wouldn't mind if it were this one. Jahrhundert goes down the ol' hatch like coke up Lindsay Lohan's nose. By the second commercial break of the ""24"" episode I was watching, it was history."
"D: A wonderful export lager. Crisp and refreshing with all the elements in good balance."
"D- Paired well with some leftover Thai red curry chicken. Not a huge fan of German lagers but this was among the better ones I have tried. Give it a try yourself."
"Beer is medium to low bodied. Sweet up front and finishes cleanly. There is a slight sulfur flavor in the back but overall its clean and crisp. There is a slight ester quality to it, almost berry flavor. drinkability is high. Mouthfeel could use a little improvement but in entirety, the beer is very good."
"Drinkability: this is a great session beer. Nicely refreshing and easy to quaff."
"Overall- Clean and crisp. Nice drinker."
"D â€“ As drinkable as it gets. This beer is now a go-to for me."
"drinkability is great - light body low abv - just wish i had some mexican food to pair with this"
"Overall a quinessential perfect example of the style. There is so much flavor in this beer, but yet it never bombards or overpowers the palate. Please take heed of the quality, class and care of this fine offering. Train your palate to it. Fully enjoy this masterpiece."
"Drinkability is good. I don't like very bland beers. This is interesting enough to make me want to pound a few, especially on a warm day."
"D- easy to drink and something i could see myself going for a second and third. sessionable also. great summer beer for BBQ or picnics. i really liked this one."
"Poured from a brown 11.2 oz. bottle. Has a pale yellow color with a 1 inch head. Smell is slightly skunky, almost pilsener like. Taste is crisp, some malts and finishing a tad bitter. Feels light in the mouth and has average drinkability. Overall this is a fairly mediocre offering."
"Taste is full maltiness up front with bread, light fruit (golden raisin, pear), hint of honey, and zesty herbs, a nice m,alty-grain-herbal finish and a full grain-bread dough character with light herbal bitterness following at the aftertaste. It is slightly oily and a bit on the sweet side,but the flavours are excellent, clean, fresh, well integrated and balanced."
"Thanks Bobsy!"
"This is an eminently sessionable dortmunder, and a fine example of the style. I could imagine putting quite a few of these back on a nice summer's day."
"hazy deep straw yellow colour. big bright white head. the bubbles in the beer keep the head stacked at a minimum, but that minimum is kept for a long time. the nose is grainy, and thats about it; maybe a bit of a metallic note, the general taste is a grainy malt with a bit of sweetness. the body is a bit thick even without the addition of the carbonation, but the beer is quite drinkable at a cold temp."
"I have a hard time thinking of a good American example of the style... very hard water would help."
"D- It's decent enough but this just wasn't for me. It reminds me a lot of a euro pilsner which I'm not a huge fan of."
"From the 330 ml. bottle with no noticeable lot code or expiration date. Sampled on September 26, 2009. It pours pale yellow with a long-lasting white head. A very malty aroma as it should be. A full bodied mouthfeel and sort of honey-like in texture. Malts are the leading flavor sensation by far along with something bready. A nice traditional Bavarian malt brew."
"A pretty good Export. Recommended."
"Overall I have to say that I'm not terribly experienced with this style but I was a fan of what I tasted. Crisp flavors and nothing was out of place. Worth a shot."
"Pours a pale/medium golden with a full head that dissipates into a white ring with moderate lacing. Herbal smells with hay/straw dominating. Taste is rather subdued, again with herbal/straw notes and a restrained hoppiness in the background. Some tart, citrus notes detectable in the aftertaste, not at all unpleasant though. Very good, smooth mouthfeel, with the right amount of carbonation. I find this to be a good representation of what the style should be imho. Highly drinkable, this might be a close to perfect beer on a warm summer day."
"enching on a hot day, this is a keeper. For those of you who like dry, grassy, clean beers, you've gotta try this."
"Pours a nice golden yellow with a lot of bubbles and a bubbly 2.5 finger white head with great retention. Smell is some bready malt and a bit of spice. Taste is up front with some spice and malt, some honey sweetness, and a bit of hops in the back for a somewhat dry finish. Some lemon and citrus notes as well. Mouthfeel is creamy with some effervescence. Very nice. Very drinkable. I'm not normally a fan of lagers, but I'd drink this one again."
"D: Not bad. Decent session beer, but I'm not a big fan of the style."
"Mouthfeel is light in body and medium-low carbonation. Somewhat sweet with little in the way of hops to balance it out. Very drinkable and especially nice on a hot day."
"D- My first for this style I didnt really know what to expect but I was pleasantly surprised! Definitely could be a easy session brew."
"Sessioning - this is definitely a sessionable beer. Maybe too much so. At 5.5% and in 500ml bottles, sucking these back is gonna catch up to you."
"Poured a clear straw gold with good head retention thanks to constant carbonation. A grainy, herbal hop smell that is a little husky. Incredibly smooth and has a good amount of sweetness to it, like honey or light chocolate and hints of cherries/berries for a very minor fruit taste; not just a dry, citrusy/veggie taste. Balanced and has a dry edge but is very well balanced thanks to the sweet malt sensations. I could session this anytime."
"D - A little bit too sweet overall. The predominant flavor charactaristics of this brew are honey and biscuits. I love Dortmunders and would definitely buy this again, but I like Great Lakes Dortmunder Gold better."
"Pale golden-straw with a large, white, frothy head that slowly diminishes to a thin film. Light lacing. Smell is mild and malty with some grain and light lemon. The taste has a huge malty sweetness. It's fine, it's just that I wasn't expecting it. Also a pleasant mild, floral hops presence. The finish is nicely bitter and dry with some lingering grassy hops. It has a medium body, dry texture and moderate carbonation. This was a good beer that I enjoyed more as it went down. Worth trying."
"D: Was down the glass before I knew it. And it tastes great, too! Definitely deserving of a 5 here. So drinkable I barely noticed it was so easy to drink until I was wondering where the hell all the beer in my glass went. This is one of the best summer beers I've ever tried."
"500ml bottle. Pours clear straw yellow with a a large, sturdy white head that lasts. Nice sweet grainy smell with very light grassy hops. Tastes again of grains notes of sweet hay. Faint hop bitterness. Lightish body. A pretty straightforward lager without any real character."
"D: Flavorful and light, this one is quite the easy drinker. It's got enough flavor to go with food or on its own. I may prefer something just a tad bit hoppier to session with, but this beer would do just fine."
"D- This light smooth beer has a nice flavor but the aroma is a little strange. There is good depth to the flavor and the sulfur qualities are reserved letting the malt and hops come through."
"A world apart from North American lagers, close your eyes and imagine yourself in Munich... or Aying."
"This has genuinely pleasant German lager, the obviously good kind, written all over it, inside and out. It seems a shame to not be drinking it whilst parking my backpacking backside on some centuries-old spartan wood bench table."
"D: Very tasty, very easy to drink. I imagine you could throw down quite a few of these in place of your everyday lager."
"D- I love this beer. I could drink several. I didn't know of it until finding it in the local Wegmans. Very very easy drinking.They only sold the half liter bottles as singles."
"D -- Very good drinkability. I was afraid that this bottle may have been past prime, based on where it was purchased, but it's damn good."
"I was going to save my reviews of my favorite biers from Deutschland until Oktoberfest 2009 season, but what the Hell! Dortmund (not ""Dortmunder"") is a suburb-like area of Muenster in the northwest (where I plan on visiting next year), and I could see the factory workers dropping by the local and sitting outdoors for a few pints of this before heading home for their wives' home-cooked German meals."
"pour is golden with a mild greenish tone. two fingers of white head... nice delicate lace. nose is malt of toffee and apple and a nice twig quality. palate is not so earth but citrus with a nice toffee apple finish. consistent and steady feel that has a nice sweet fruit a blend of apple like and citrus yet subtle."
"D - Refreshing and very drinkable, perfectly carbonated, perfect ABV."
"D- pretty good, this beer has a good body but is smooth drinking and crisp, with flavor for days. Really hard to go wrong."
"Poured translucent yellow - not completely see through, but not as cloudy as an unfiltered/hefeweizen. Very refreshing beer. The carbonation seemed as if there was more of it, but with smaller than usual bubbles - if that makes sense. At it warmed slightly the aroma really came out. Honey and malt was what I was getting from it. I didn't get much citrus as some others did, but did notice the slightest acidic hint to linger. For a lager is sure drank a lot like a Czech pilsner. Just a great quality beer."
"D: First of all, this really should be listed as a Dortmunder/Export. Anyway, I am of the opinion that, with the exception of Prima Pils, Bavarian brewers are absolutely untouchable when it comes to producing quality pale lagers. This is one of the premier examples. A bit maltier than most, but outstanding nonetheless."
"Easily one of the best Munich Helles that I have had. I only wish these beers were cheaper and available in six packs."
"Nice yellow - blond color. Pretty beer with a held head... Smells good, sweet kind of, not hoppy but malty. Very good tasting beer. Again sweet and easy to drink. Really good. Mouthfeel was good... Full of flavor. Very nice beer. I could drink a couple and then sit around for awhile. Good beer."
"D: A little tasty, goes down easily, not very filling, mild kick, good representation of style, this is a good mild beer to drink for a long time but there are other beers in the style that I would choose first."
"Mouthfeel is soft but sparkling carbonation. Nice beer, the kind I'd gladly sit and drink all night long if given the opportunity."
"Sidenote: Wonderful label as well... Im a graphic designer and I have to say this is one bottle I'll be saving."
"Mouthfeel is a bit on the light side but still retains an overall viscosity that's about right. Drinkability is decent. Overall a pretty good lager from Germany."
"Drinkability: Tastes good, mild generally, low ABV, good mouthfeel. Recommended"
"Overall: Quite nice. Highly recommended."
"A masterful balance of malt and hop character. A nice light, refreshing brew that knows no boundaries, as far as the time of year is concerned. This is a beer that Budweiser etc. wishes they could brew."
"I could see sitting back and knocking down a number of these. It's very easy to drink, clean tasting and goes well with just about anything."
"This is a very drinkable beer and one you could enjoy throughout the night."
"Thin mouthfeel and nice carbonation finishes very dry and slightly bitter."
"That being said, the honey sweet malts and mild but spicy hops make this one of the most delicious and balanced lagers I have tasted. Call it what you like, I could drink these all day."
"The taste, wow! This is probably one of the smoothest lagers you'll find. There is a nice graininess to the beer, some florals popping through, and just a honey smoothness that makes this a delight. It is very refreshing, there are some cracker like biscuitiness in the background, and some smooth malts that do tend towards the dryness in the finish. There is just a bit of hop presence that balances out the honey flavors so that the beer doesn't become overly sweet or cloying. The hop adds a nice complementary balance in this beer. There isn't much crispness and it has just the right amount of carbonation. The Germans still make the best lagers around and this is no exception. L'Chaim."
"The taste is very grainy upfront as the malt hits your palate. This is where the grains I detected in the nose hit my mouth. You also taste a hint of sweetness that balances out this medium-bodied brew. There is a slight bitterness in the end with a mild hop bite, but the brew finishes very clean."
"The yellow color light enough that not only is it transparent, you can se the widespread, large bubbles work their way upwards. Thick head of immaculate white, the foam so fine you almost can't see the bubbles comprising them. Crisp, well-detailed nose of mellow hops, grain, straw with more of a suggestion of honey than delivery, sourdough bread, the malts smooth out the texture without ever dominating. Light to medium-bodied with persistent carbonation which adds to the body rather than disperse it. Oats, grain, bread dough, lemongrass and lemon peel, clove, at no time bitter nor sweet, expertly treads the middle ground, balance more important than making an impression. Finishes with an impression of apricot and pear fruit. Were the foam slightly lower you could chug a gallon before having to whiz."
"This brew has a very distinctive flavor and nose. Also, a great feel. Nothing overbearing, but a nice complex combination of aromas and flavors. Great quaff."
"Poured from pint bottle, extremely pale hazy yellow with fluffy white head. Head turns to clumps of foam, with good lacing. Smell is grass, grains, slight lemon and spicy hops. Taste: bready, good amount of spiciness, grassy. Very smooth. Hops give a slightly bitter, drying finish. Mouthfeel and drinkability are fantastic as is customary from this brewery."
"D - I was in a bad mood when I poured this. I took one sip and I couldn't recall what I was pissed about! Amazingly refreshing, easy to drink, and reasonably priced($2.89!). I could drink this all day. I'm using the remaining half-pint in my mug to wash down some German sausage,sauerkraut and potatoes."
"7/4/7/4/15 (3.7/5)"
"The aroma is hopped well with herbal and floral hops. It is also grainy with faint but detectable cardboard and yeast elements. The appearance is nice with a large foamy head and somewhat hazy gold color. The flavor is complex but not with flavors that compliment each other. It has soap, grass, paper, citrus, yeast, cereal, and bitter hops. The palate is average and the aftertaste is bitter citrus. I know this is a quality beer but there is just something about the taste that could be better."
"Taste is good. Pretty bready, and mildly bitter. Somewhat fruity and sweet, but overall very grainy/bready. Mouthfeel is a little lacking, and there is some metallic coming through in the taste. Not bad at all, but the Augustiner Munich Helles Lager is far better in my opinion."
"This beer is why I love German beers, and that reason is balance. And that balance is of subtle flavors which is even harder to perfect. The appearance was of a filtered pilsner with a hint more of orange (a hint to more malt) and a big frothy head with lots of carbonation (maybe a little too much carbonation). The smell was classic German festbier / helles / pilsner. Taste was a nice surprise. Being a special beer the flavor had to be something different, well not too different to mess with a winning German beer formula. To me it taste as though they added more of each ingredient to bring more flavor all around and especially more sweetness from the extra malt that gave the hint of orange color and a tad more alcohol. But by increasing all the ingredients some what equally the refreshing balance is maintained. Mouth feel is watery, smooth and hint of slickness. Drinkability is good do to the exceptional balance."
"Wow, this one blew away my expectations to the next county! To its credit, Ayinger Jahrhundert becomes my favorite lager to date, as well as one of the best beers I've ever had. And fortunately for me, it's easily accessable and won't cost me more than $3 a half-liter. Drink and learn fellow BA's, this is what a German helles lager is all about."
"D - This is a good lager. Very easy to drink and has a surpising spicy kick."
"Hugely drinkable, another great brew from Ayinger !"
"D - I've thoroughly enjoyed this beer, but the mouthfeel really keeps the drinkability down. The flavor is good, but it's not something I want to keep drinking with the relatively heavy and flat mouthfeel."
"It has almost a marzen flavor, but with a hefeweizen's complexity. Yet another winner from Ayinger."
"Pours a crystal clear pale straw yellow color with a thick rocky head that left behind some very nice looking lacing. Grainy aroma with only slightest hint of hoppiness. Sweet, malty flavor, a little grainy, husky, minimal hop bitterness. Creamy on the tongue, decent carbonation. A fantastic Helles Lager, probably the best I've had."
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability: As aforementioned this one is much heavier on the palate than I expected. I'm going to say that this one is heavy on the palate. Not heavy as a stout mind you, but for the style I think that it is heavy. Low carbonation and what I'll gather to be quite a bit of residual sugar, or maybe its just full of unfermentable dextrins... no matter what it is this beer has a full body. Finish isn't dry as was with the Edestoff. Very pleasant beer, one that I'll definitely be buying again next time I'm in the mood for a great Helles. However, still going to be ""questing"" for better and different Helles. Most likely won't be back to it for a while, till I run out of available Helles in the area. Definitely worth the time and money to try."
"MF&D - Overall a very good beer. Went great with a soft pretzel and spicy mustard."
"D. Nice, easy full-floavored Helles. Very nice hop and malt balance."
"Poured a dark yellow color with extremely fluffly white head that took quite some time to dissipate. Aroma was a malty grainness. Taste was extremely malty with just enough hops to balance it out. Tasted of malt, grain, and just a bit of sweetness. Mouthfeel was excellent and drinkability is way up there. I enjoyed."
"Drinkability: Acceptable, but it's no Altbairisch Dunkel, I will say!"
"It has a very clear pale straw yellow body with a large 1.5"" head that had great retention and lasted to the last sipp and left some extensive patches of film. Smells of biscuity malt and light grassy noble hops. Taste is a nice sweet buscuit malt with some grainy flavors and a good back end bitter hop hit that gives a clean dry entrance to the finish before giving way to the malt again on the swallow. The mouth feel was medium, smooth and slightly creamy. Very drinkable I wish I had more...oh wait about 3 more oz's in the bottle, nice!"
"D: A good beer from Ayinger, not a typical Helles, but solid nonetheless."
"A very well balanced brew that is more complicated than it seems. A another great brew from Ayinger."
"Notes: Finally I find a Helles lager that I enjoy. Both the FFF Gorch Fock and Brooklyn Keller Helles were disappointments"
"Overall - A decent enough and pretty drinkable lager.... nothing groundbreaking but very quaffable... worth a try..."
"drinkability is very good on this, a great example of the style."
"Overall: Very satisfying beer indeed."
"D: Decent light drinking helles lager, not particularly my style but cleanly brewed and decent for what it is."
"Drinkability: An excellent session beer, very crisp and drinkable."
"I love the Celebrator Doppelbock so I went for the opposite en of the spectrum. Poured a pale yellow but colorful at the same time, not just drab like many thin, watery beers. Smelled pleasenty of lemons and a bit grassy, reminiscent of a shandy maybe. Taste was crisp and clean with the same hint of lemon zest but smooth on the tongue. It was wunderbar!"
"D - The Mouthfeel and Appearance help this beer, but I will not drink again."
"D: I've never had a lager with such a prominent coriander aroma and flavour. I am enjoying this beer very much. It's very light and a breeze to drink - I will most definitely buy this helles again. This could be a new summer favourite for me. I'm loving this brewery! A perfect fit for my 100th review. Cheers!"
"Very different from their doppelbock, this poured a very pale blonde with fluffy white head. It had a very light and springy scent, like lemon and yeast. It tasted like sour hops at first (fairly typical for lagers, I believe) with some honey sweetness for balance. It was light and watery with moderate carbonation and a mild aftertaste. Overall this was a very light beer, not bad for a lager, but not good for me."
"Bravo to zee Hermans JA JA JA JA"
"Wow, the pale colour and standard euro hoppy nose indicate a standard euro pils but the beer is full of big bodied goodness. The crispness and big finish make this beer a cut above most pils. There is a sweetness to the beer combined with a decent hop rate that make every sip a joy."
"quenching, but not too crisp or dry, giving it a somewhat unique drinkability."
"Mouthfeel is very good. Super smooth, low alcohol, mellow flavors. The kind of beer you can drink forever."
"The best element of this gem, to me, is its outstanding texture. It holds this together extremely well and makes it amazingly easy to down. Ayinger is an incredible brewery, and everything I've had from Ayinger, including Jahrhundert, is nothing short of excellent and delicious. Choosing this for my 200th review was almost as good a decision as choosing this from Friar Tuck. Superb."
"Well, I was caught off guard by this one, but not at all surprised due to it's namesake. The balance of this beer, excellent flavor, and easy drinkability make this one hell of a good brew. One of the best I've had the privilege of drinking, and highly recommended."
"Ayinger's Brau-Weisse is one of my all-time favorite beers, and their Munich Helles Lager fails to disappoint - top-notch stuff that is head of the class... wonderful hazy, cloudy witbier-like appearance with a foamy head... Copped a 500ML bottle from Gary's in Madison... smell is replete with citrus, floral notes, lemons, and ripe fruits... wonderful, crisp, clear, clean taste with honey-dew and grapefruit notes... extremely crisp mouthfeel with an elegant, easy-going, light drinkability... full-flavored, rich, thick, creamy beer that is ultra-satisfying... wonderfully refreshing and easily drinkable... goes down like water with no problem at all... could drink this all night-long... no bitterness or alcohol detected... top-of-the-line flavor and taste that deserves recognition... another winner from Ayinger... Definitely recommended... Awesome depiction of the style..."
"D. I cut my teeth on German beers. Helles were never my thing, but I must say this is my favorite of the class. I look forward to trying this directly at the brewery next year!!!!"
"Pours a four finger white head that fades very slowly leaving a trace of lace. Ugly cloudy green/amber color. Light-medium carbonation and medium bodied. Slight citrusy nose. Flavor is more like a wheat than a lager - lemony, smooth some sweetness, clean finish. $2.35 for a 330ml bottle from Colonial Spirits Acton, MA."
"Crisp clean golden lager with a helthy white ouickly dissapating head,excately what you would look for with a helles. Biscuty scent with a dry malty flavor and an almost electric mouthfeel. Refreshing and envigorating on the pallet. All summing up with a slight hop spice but ending as a well ballenced beer."
"Ayinger Jahrhundert Bier pours a light yellow with a thick white head from a brown half liter bottle. There is a nice light spicy hop aroma. The mouthfeel is thicker than I would expect, but quite pleasant. There is untoasted malt and a bit of spicy/citrusy hops in the taste and that's about it. But this simple combination adds up to quite a pleasant lager."
"D: Drinks alright, but due to the taste, I won't be buying again."
"i haven't tried many true German helles until now, only am. ones ; pours a hazy golden-straw into my weizen w/ thin white head which dissapates rather quickly, lots of lacing ; a rather light aroma, a slight malty aroma , not a noticable hop aroma ; a crisp malty palate w/ a faint amount of hop flavor, a slight ""macro"" and metallic undertone as well ; a nice light bodied & dry mouthfeel, just enough co2 ; a very drinkable beer, i'll drink this one again soon..."
"This would also be a great beer to serve up to any BMC drinking friends you have. It has the same look but infinitely better taste. At the same time, it is not a beer with any Â“newÂ” or overwhelming flavors."
"pours a cloudy pale straw color with a large white head that holds to about a quarter inch but not a lot of lace. smells like green olives cured in oil. taste is malty, with a earthy corn grainy finish. medium body and slightly dry. not what i expected for a lager beer."
"Mouthfeel is smooth, medium body and almost creamy. Highly drinkable and a great segue way into the fall. As with most Ayinger beers, highly recommended."
"This beer is light to medium yellow in color, with good clarity. The head was good, but dissipated after several seconds. The aroma was sweet and estery...almost hefeweisen-like. There was no hop aroma. The taste was sweet, estery and lightly spicy, almost ale-like."
"D: If you're looking for the subtle nuances of a lager and something that will pair well with food or be able to stand on its own, this is definitely worth a shot. Not only is this a good example of the style, it's quite versatile and has a relatively low abv. Highly recommended for fans of lagers, especially the German Helles style. Great drinkability."
"Pours a medium yellow color with a decent head. Aroma is sweet and malty with some fruitness. Taste is somewhat malty with some spiciness and a decent dryness at the back of the throat.Goes down quite well. It's close to the style as mentioned as well."
"Finishes with a sweet, earthy taste. Very good beer, easy to drink."
"Another good example of a Munich Helles lager. This one isn't anything to go crazy over but it's still above average."
"Amazingly drinkable for a pils - all the usual smoothness with a bonus in body. Hops are here seeminglly in tradition only. Less refreshing and more chewable."
"Mouthfeel was rounded and smooth with a short soft finish."
"D: Easy drinking - effortlessly sessionable. Why doesn't Bud or Miller taste like this (rhetorical question)."
"D: Most of the Ayinger brand is a must and this bier stands with it's already exceptional class. I would buy this again...and I think I will as soon as I get around to it!"
"Notes: A simple lager, not terribly complex but impressive in its balance. The taste remains extremely clean, even when it warms up. I bet this would be a great beer fresh on tap."
"hazy gold with a bright white head that leaft a little lace all over. bready, herbal, slightly floral smell. taste the flowery malt! its not the hops. i'm not a big lager/pilsner fan, but this one has a little thicker body than average, and i like that. very nice going down. very drinkable."
"Bottle courtesy of Plucier: Poured a cloudy yellow lager with some white hue and a big foamy head with good retention. Aroma of floral malt with some light citrusy notes. Taste is dominated by big floral malt with some light sweetness. Defintely more malt then what i am use to for the style. Body is full with some low filtration and some great carbonation. Overall, well done for the style."
"The flavour was mainly malty and sweet, with a bread-like quality, but some hops at the back end added a nice crisp bitterness that prevented it from being cloying. Medium carbonation and body felt right and kept up this beer's outstanding refreshing qualities."
"Pours a slightly hazy golden straw color with a nice white head that dissipated without leaving much lace. The smell is of mellow spice, a bit grainy, almost has a slight buttery smell. The taste is slighty spicy and grainy/bready malt base. Some light hop presence but nothing significant to make this bitter, but a small metallic twang. The feel is creamy yet well carbonated. A very good helles, some nice subtle flavors blending well. A nice summer drinking brew."
"I have to say I was a bit disapointed by this one from Ayinger as I normally enjoy their offerings, but as a Helles its not too bad, I'm just not that big a fan of this particular one."
"This is a nice pale lager, but nothing to flip about. It is so nice to enjoy another great beer, except that it further muddies the water when trying to determine where above average and excellent resides. This is a good crisp pale lager. This is what (to me) is considered good ball-park beer. Not disruptive or offensive in any area, along with many other beers in this category. It is definitely worth being on a long term beer rotation."
"Carbonation levels are resonable, making this beer very easy to drink. A classic munich style lager...PROST!"
"Mouthfeel is light, but not as actively carbonated as first appearance would leave one to believe."
"An awesome lighter lager that's still full of flavor. It looks a proper straw-yellow in my glass, similar to a macro lager, but the aroma is way off from cheap beer. It's sweet with a pale grains and lager funk. The flavor expands on the aroma with deeper barley flavors and a balancing bitterness, but nothing on par with a good pilsner. Definitely a good lager to try if you've never had a good helles lager."
"Pours an extremely light straw color with a fizzy white head. The aroma is clean with malt, a touch of biscuits and some herbal hops. The taste starts out with a smoot maltiness that finishes with dry with a nice lingering herbal hop finish. Mouthfeel is light and crisp from the carbonation. Overall, this is a pretty darn good lager, definately one of the best I have had. Recommended."
"Very well balanced. A smooth refreshing brew that is not short of taste and complexity. Another great beer from Brauerei Aying."
"Quite simple, but nicely done and enjoyable."
"poured a clear pale gold with a rocky head and nice lacing. bread dough dominates the nose along with some floral and honey notes. taste is balanced towards the malt with nice residual sweetness reined in slightly by some subdued hop bitterness. i definitely enjoy the clean, slightly sweet malt profile of ayinger beers. mouthfeel is light/medium bodied with lively carbonation. on first impression a great session beer but the sweetness becomes cloying after a couple of these. needs a touch more hop bitterness."
"Body is medium, but feels light on the palate with a creamy texture and slick drinkability. A interesting beer, and a style that will require furthur investigation."
"Pours a good thick head that has pretty good retention. It also has a very good lacing along with a good clear very very light golden color. Smell is bready and a little sweet, nice smell that's lager-like, but with a seemingly thicker smell (if that makes any sense). The first thing is when it hits the tip of the tongue and you taste a sweetness of the malted barley. Usually I'm not a fan of sweetness especially when accompanied by lagers. Ever since my first lager (Butt-wiper), the smell and taste of the sweet beverage has always been sickening. This however is very nice. Mouthfeel is crisp and nice, very good. Overall I will have this again, I like it. I will buy 3 next time to fill up my 1 liter Hofbrau Haus glass."
"Drinkability: A very drinkable lager that hooks me right in. Love the smoothness , the tasty malt , and the herbal / grassy hop qualities. I feel like im in Bavaria!"
"Pours a hazy straw hue, with lots of sediment. The three finger head is rocky and dense, showing great retention and lots of sticky lacing. Fantastic floral hop aroma, with a light caramel and pale malt background. Pale Munich malt sweetness upfront, followed by a mellow wheat flavor and a slightly acidic citrus note. Somewhat dry aftertaste with a faint yeast bite anf fading acidity- this makes for a good balance when combined with the mild spicy/floral German hop flavor. Light bodied and medium carbonated- but brisk on the tounge due to the wheat texture and citric character. Very refreshing yet it has a considerable malt profile- an odd combination that seeems to work well here. Great drinkability with an interesting residual pale malt sweetness and tart phenols in the finish. A strange Helles for sure, but a good one in my book."
"Not sure of the age of this bottle, but once again the vulnerability of imports to America's three-tier system shows lack of accountability for old/poorly handled product."
"Overall a nice flavorful helles. Very sessionable and so full of complex flavor that this is a beer to enjoy slowly."
"I expect much more from this brewer."
"An easy-drinking ""session"" - light, smooth and refreshing with enough malty flavor to keep it interesting. If you want an easy, malty drink, this is a good choice."
"D - Aside from slight metallic aftertaste, not really offensive, but just a bit on the boring side."
"A tasty beer that aims to please. When ever I think of German beers I think ""malty, robust, dark in color and frothy heads."" Which may be true to an extent? But this is a good example of a smooth, drinkable, tasty German lager!"
"Purchased this at Belmont Beverage on South Bend's Southside. Poured into Pilsner glass at cellar temps. Poured a cloudy straw yellow. Impressive comact three finger head and attendent lacing. The cloudiness set off alarm bells immediatly. The aroma was mainly a grainy, sour maltiness. The taste mirrored the aroma. Sour, sweet, a bit rancid. The sell by date on the bottle was missing. This beer is obviously oxidized. Too bad, I drank Ayinger lagers while living in Germany many moons ago."
"Fulll malt palate in the taste followed by bitter hop bath, unfortunately tinged with metal in the aftertaste. Otherw ffrom that, the finish is fairly clean. Mouthfeel is wet and refreshing. Carbonaation is about right for the style. Not a beer I'll be looking high and low for but not terrible either. esssionable if you were so inclined. Among Ayinger's weakest, but for many brewers, better than their best."
"Pretty good overall. Not really my style, but I liked it."
"Notes: I couldn't finish the beer. This doesn't happen often. It was just way too sweet and malty and I didn't like the herbal hops either."
"-Oelergud"
"Not a bad brew, yet I won't be searching this for this beer at the store. Better IMO than the Oktoberfest."
"Drinkability: Sessionable, malt, and enjoyable. Worth a try."
"This beer pours a cloudy orange yellow with a giant white foamy head. The smell is very pungent with lemon zest, bread yeast, and sweet malt. The taste has bitter hops, sweet malt, lemon, and wheat. A very nice taste along with high carbonation makes this beer extremely drinkable. The m/f is light with all the flavors mixing well. An excellant beer that should not be missed."
"Drinkability--Mmmmm. Yummy."
"Poured into a pilsner glass,very light golden color,nice fluffy white head.Looks very tempting,grainy,slight sweet malty,hint of yeast aroma.A bready,slighty grainy taste,not a lot of hop presence.A light moutnfeel,with just the right amount of bitterness to finish. An execellent session beer. Would really be nice on a hot summer day."
"Pours a very bright clear golden color. Smell is clean. Has about a finger thick head with light laces around the glass. There is a lot of carbonation with loads of bubbles, its quite effervescent. The taste is nice and crisp with the hops shining through a bit with a dry finish. Mouthfeel is moderate. This is a nice lager, I'm an ale man so I don't drink many lagers, but I could have more than one of these in a row."
"While not as good as the doublebock, this Ayinger is a nice beer."
"Cheers!"
"Notes: A good brew that is refreshing and shows some depth."
"Notes- a very very good beir that I would have again , yet it is not the wiehenstephaner which is the finest example of the syle"
"A very pleasant sweetness rounds everything out with this beer. Cunningly deep layered flavors and awesomely balanced German goodness - this actually approaches a Dortmunder in style."
"Drinkability: The beer is very drinkable with a firm malt body."
"D - This is a very nice summertime beer with enough character to keep it interesting without being too bold, and enough balance to keep it very drinkable."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable, very enjoyable. Will I run out and buy more? Probably not right now (I can't find any either), but I will try to revisit this one again. Definitely a must try to experience the style."
"Drinkability - this is decent, it goes down easy, and is refreshing on a hot day. Fairly sessionable."
"My bro and I had a bottle of this highly drinkable brew shortly after landing in Munich. Gold and bubbly, the smell was almost nil with a touch of bread. It poured with a nice head and dispersed quickly. My brother commented that it had a bit of a rubbery aftertaste, but I could not find it. We both liked it and had another. It was a great way to start off our World Cup trip."
"Poured from a 22 ounce bottle into a glass. Thick white head that lingered through much of the glass. The aroma was mostly bread and dough. The taste is a continuation of the bread and malt sweetness, with just a touch of hops bitterness. Impressed with the long, strong finish."
"Overall: An outstanding lager with a great balance between hops and malt, and extremely drinkable. Strongly recommended."
"Prost! MK"
"Overall: A really fine beer."
"ayinger makes solid products, this is also good... but nothing I will ""have"" to get next time I am beer hunting in NY."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Exactly what I would expect for this beer... elegant, simple, yet fully present. This beer drinks very well with brunch and could certainly be a summer day's best friend by the pool or grill. Tasty, clean, simple, and delicious. Prost!!"
"This beer is one of the best beers that I have yet to run across. Good looks, good to the nose, and very good on the palate."
"D - high, due to its sweetness"
"This bottle poured out a golden-yellow witha nice white sparkling head that quickly dissappeared.The aroma was of yeast and bread.The body was medium-light and the taste was of citrus,bread and yeast characters.This was a very refreshing and delicious beer,and another great offering from the great Ayinger brewery!"
"I don't rate it as high on drikability as I do the Hefe's but it has a good drinkable quality to it. Overall I really enjoyed this beer."
"Very drinkable but not a flavorful as some in this style. The Munich Helles is a great crossover from American Macro Pilsner Lagers."
"Flavor is malt. Honey and lemon rind, sweetbread. Sile King's hawaiian bread with lemon jam on top. OK, not really, but it's the best I can do. Sweet, clean, and just a slight hint of hop at the end. Very tasty, very drinkable."
"Less reviewin', more drinkin'."
"I'm taking a liking to this beer. If the smell wasn't so unusual, it would probably be amongst my favorites in the lager styles."
"Aw shucks, I've just tried it for the first time and it's already getting me all maudlin. Or is it the stress talking (or perhaps this as a result of it managing some stress release?). A charming little beer, you just want to pinch its cheeks and take it home to feed it a nice warm bowl of soup before sending it back on its way. That's the feeling I'll get every time I see it on the shelf now."
"I don't know how faithful this is the Helles style, not having much personal experience with the style, but damn is it good."
"This is one hell of a session brew. Damn, I wish I could get a few cases of this close to home!"
"A fairly aggressive pour produced a large white head over a very light golden body with plenty of small bubbles. Smell of hay and wheat with piney and metallic hops. Nice. Taste is pretty broad for a Helles Lager -- some complexity of wheat, straw, crackers with a citrus note or two dominated by the nice hop dryness and bitterness. Good mouthfeel, with light refreshing carbonation. Very drinkable: at 5.5% it's probably just out of the session beer range, but still quite quaffable. Nice beer. Go get some."
"Mouthfeel is light bodied and a bit of carbonation tingle on the tongue with a clean and crisp finish as it goes down. This is not my favorite style but I'd probably buy it again when I feel like something different from my normal strong ales...cheers"
"I liked this beer the first time I tried it and I think itÂ’s still worth a try. I got the current bottle at the German Gourmet in Falls Church. VA., which I visited for the first time this week. If German cuisine is your thing, this is an unbelievable store. In particular, the beer and wine selection is huge. The Jahrhundert pours a yellow straw color with a slight haze to it. There is a very nice malt/hops aroma coming out of the glass. The flavor is well balanced between those components right through the finish. ItÂ’s a little spritzier than IÂ’d like but some might find that energizing after a few. Good stuff."
"Drinkability is exceptional as well. I could drink this anytime of year. It would be great on a hot summer day or just sitting around the house in a snow storm (as I am right now). I will go back for more of this one."
"D: The moderate alcohol content; fresh, distinct taste; and pleasant mouthfeel make this beer not only great for part of a session, but also an excellent choice for those days where you'd prefer something lighter-bodied, refreshing, and crisp"
"Super drinkable, perfect summer bier eve in january this made me remember some great biergarten moments"
"Drinkability & Notes Â– Great summer beer, sadly its the middle of January... Still tasty, but I'll have to try it again in 6 months to see if I like the smooth easy drinking flavor on a hotter day."
"Hazy, murky straw like appearance; champagne-bubbly carbonation that helps solidify a soapy white head. Subtle noseÂ—bready and grainy notes, as the beverage is sipped, more fruity notes, banana peel and lemons, are noted. A rather suprising Â‘chewy startÂ’, spicy floral hops, crisp carbonation and lightly toasted malts. The body is quite rich and creamy, the Munich malts are the key player here, with some dry hoppiness in the body. Medium bodied. Warming shows the doughy characteristics that allow for a very smooth finish. This helles takes me back to my days in Germany, and has Â‘gimme a brat and a bierÂ’ written all over it. A winner, and one that should indeed satisfy the wide range of BA taste-buds."
"Poured a nice two finger head. Slighty cloudy golden color. Great carbonation and brussell's lace. The little sediment that poured out was kept floating in the middle of the beer because of the high carbonation. Smelled a nice hoppy and estery green apples and lemon. Tasted of green apples with a nice hop note. Very light and semi-tart palate. Very eay to drink and a good recommendation for a session beer."
"This beer pours a foggy straw color, and leaves a very sticky white lace that sticks to the side of the glass. The appearance is foggy with some golden hues throughout. As I taste this beer the grass, malt, lemon, honey, and the very slightest taste of grapefruit bitterness. The mouthfeel is malty the beer just cleanses the palate with crisp carbonation and the finish is semi-sweet with a honey lemon finish. This is a great style my first time trying it, and one I will go back to."
"Pours a dark gold with a slight haze and a tall fluffy head that fell to a thin film of bubbles. Smells absolutely fantastic with hints of apples, bananas, play dough, red liquorish and an over all dry smoothness. Tastes like a grassy oat and wheat malt that dries out the roof of my mouth and edges of my tongue with a slight grapefruit rind finish. In the middle, there is an intermittent banana and black pepper sweetens between the initial grains and the final dryness. The mouth feel is thick but on the verge of being too carbonated. Over all, this is a well done beer that I wouldnÂ’t mind having a few more of. Also, IÂ’ve noticed that this beer tastes way better in the half liter bottle, as opposed to the 12 oz, or 330 ml bottles."
"Pours a straw colored pale yellow with thick white head. Smells of a malty bread and bits of lemon and grapes. There is a flowery nose to this also. Taste is grainy with bits of honey and flowers. There is a good hop balance that doesn't over power this beer. Really good taste to this beer with a nice carbonartion amount. Very tasty with the grains coming back as an aftertaste. Very drinkable."
"Even the feel of the brew is dainty, this would make a good summer brew, but now in late fall this just doesnÂ’t fit the bill (no points deducted for me drinking in the wrong season)."
"Opinion: Now this is a good beer! Aying makes good beer anyway, but this is one of their best. It is clean and refreshing, and a good example of the style. If this one were available here in Texas (where I could find it), I would drink this beer on a very regular basis. Thumbs up!"
"It has a malty aftertaste, followed by a little point of pungent."
"Pours a clear straw yellow with a huge bright white head that takes it's time to settle. Decent lacing. Nose was of lemon and flowery hops overlying a slight biscuity malt. Taste was is clean and dry, with some light citrus notes over a nice strong malt and finishing with a rather light hop note, just enough to give a hint of bitterness. There's a sweet honeyish aftertaste which is pretty nice. Mouthfeel is a little on the thin side, good level of carbonation though. This is a really good lager, simple and refreshing, but full flavored."
"The body is quite light and crisp from the carbonation. There is a tiny hop bite in the finish. Good, but nothing spectacular... and not just because it is a light beer."
"Ayinger's Jahrhundert is a firm lager that shows what's best about German lager brewing, but with added body, flavor, and confidence."
"Pours a light hazy yellow with a frothy monster of a head, lacing will coat the glass. The smell is of honey toasted grains, hints of lemon coreandor, a nice soft buttery hue. The taste is fabulous, light but damn tasty, the grains are mixed with a light melon. A slight banana yeast with a hint of lemon. Perfect for anything, goes good with a dinner, watching a ballgame or just sitting down relaxing. Ah perfecto!"
"The look is of a straw-like, apple juice color topped with a modest head...not highly filtered, either. There is apple and nutmeg on the nose, as well as a sweet cream scent. It is heavy on the apple in taste, but in a good way (no gross artificial taste). The lack of carbonation was rather disappointing, but it was a very, VERY drinkable beer overall. Love it!"
"Pours a cloudy yellow color with a moderate head that falls fast and leaves a little lacing on the glass. The aroma has a lot of citrus, lemon with some grain. The flavor is tasty with some of the citrus notes and very smooth. The body is light to moderate and the drinkability is pretty good."
"Pours a lightly hazy straw color with a 2 finger head that falls to less than a finger. The nose is grainey, but not harsh. Light lemon notes hit. Its very clean. The flavor is very grainey, but again...not harsh. Very flavorful and clean. Very nice beer. Flavors don't hold on too long. The feel is light to moderate with a light to moderate carbonation. I'm very impressed with this one. I'm not very familiar with the style, but I reall like the clean lines. It will never be my favortie, but its good."
"This is an easily quaffable beer. It's a step up from ""lawn mower"" beers. If you go into the tasting thinking delicate, you will likely enjoy this. If you are looking a big, powerful lager, this one will disappoint."
"Slightly hazy straw color with a good amount of head that lingers nicely. Nose has pleasant herbal notes but grains are nondistinct. Smoothly malted at the start with balanced hops that take over into the aftertaste, giving this one a mildly bitter though not crisp finish. Mouthfeel is rather light and somehow fitting for this lager. I'm a fan of Ayinger, but this one won't frequent my fridge."
"500 ml bottle."
"500 mL with no freshness date - served chilled in a pilsner glass. It pours a bright golden color that is very clear and it's topped with a 2 finger white head that slowly fades and leaves little lacing. In the nose there is sweet malts with some spicy/floral/citric hops and a hint of metal. The malts are grainy and toasty on the palate and they are balanced by moderately bitter spicy hops. There are hints of metal, lemon, and orange and it has a medium body that is smooth, crisp, and a little tingly. Overall a tasty lager."
"A great warm-weather beer."
"Pours yellow/cloudy color with a nice head which eventually fizzles away. Has a sweet smell with a nice taste. Mouthfeel is nice not too full. Very nice aftertaste not bitter at all. This brew, to me does not taste like a lager at all. This brew is very drinkable. Will buy again."
"Drinkability is very fine. This Ayinger has an interesting complexity for a lager style. This is an excellent session brew. Wish I had purchased another 4 pack."
"A light straw yellow beer. Has a big foamy white head with a nice lace. The aroma starts with a sweet grassy character. Followed by a Biscuity grain note with a hint of peppery hops in the back. The flavor has a quick malty sweetness to start and a sharp peppery hop finish."
"A light yellow (piss?) color, unimpressive. Bitter Heinekan-like smell. Eh. Taste is much better than expected. Good balance and not bitter to the taste, it is definately a german lager. Good carbonation, flows well over the tongue. On a hot summer day, i could drink a lot of this."
"Pours a beautiful golden yellow color. I hate to say it but it could pass for a Bud if it wasnt so carbonated and didnt have a killer head. Almost defines what a ""beer"" looks like. Sulfury aroma-almost seems skunked but more sulfur. Malty flavor-slight hop bitterness. Slight fruitiness. Very good full mouthfeel. Body stands up quite well. Enjoyable beer overall-bring on the hot weather for this one."
"Very smooth mouthfeel and it goes down great, but I expected more from Ayinger."
"Light bodied, dry-finishing great beer."
"Medium bodied, crisp and smooth, with a pleasant mouthfeel. This is a delicious and very drinkable malt-accented lager. I'm happy that my local store keeps this one in stock."
"Overall, a tasty, well-constructed lager that is refreshing and nicely balanced. Worth picking up."
"Slightly hazy, golden yellow with a creamy, white to off-white head, that laces nicely, though it doesn't stick around for long. Nose is tangy, yeasty bread malt (sour dough), with some balancing sweetness, and a noble hop backing. Strong yeasty bread malt flavor with light sugar cookie sweetness combine with a perfumey fruit flavor. Light noble bitterness takes us into a yeasty, dryish finish. Medium bodied and quite quaffable. Me gusta."
"Nice drink with supper. Aggressive carbonation, good taste. Some complexity, with different malts and some toffee and citrus. Went with bread, meat and fish. Appearance light golden with white lasting head. Medium mouthfeel.Refreshing in winter and would be so in summer as well."
"This is a very easy drinking beer which was gone in no time and left me wishing I'd picked up a few more."
"50 cl bottle decanted into 50 cl Ayinger becher. Pours a slightly hazed sunny yellow color with a fluffy off-white head. Nice husky and malty nose with a fair hopping level and some suggestions of toasted nuts. Excellent husky astringency melding with the hops. Light malt sweetness, but everything else is dry, lightly astringent and husky. I think I""ve found my new favorite helleslager. Suggestions of nuts show up again in the taste. Just wonderfully drinkable and thoroughly enjoyable. Highly recommended a beer that's light in alcohol, yet chock-full-o'-taste."
"Jagged mallow rests on a foggy electric yellow. Clean aroma hinting at baked hard pretzels and crisped rice cereal in lowfat milk. A satisfying mouthful balances a bite of plain puff pastry and weed. Quality suds that might be perfect taken vom Fass in Bayern."
"This IS lager...the standard...Refreshing flavorful, well crafted....I could drink dozens in a sitting..this is a world class authentic lager just made for sessions."
"Let me preface the review with this: I really enjoyed the all the other beers from this brewery so far. I wish this one had measured up to the fine standard Franz Inselkammer has set with their other offerings. The beer pours out the color of pale golden straw. A big, fluffy head forms and leaves behind some lace. Smell is almost missing in action. Light hops and lighter malt are the only notes found. Taste is a bit hoppy without being bitter but there is not much to taste either. Mouthfeel is lightly carbonated and a medium body. Drinkability could be so much higher if it had something to taste. In the end, this was more like a German version of an American megabrew offering, a disappointing beer. My only hope - after reading some of the other reviews -is that I simply got a bad bottle. I might try it again down the road."
"This is pretty much the perfect session beer. It tastes like a nap in a Bavarian field. It is a lot more earthy than anything you'd expect from a beer that's also so light anfd fluffy. The head lingers well and there is some lacing. Your 90 year old grandma could drink this all night and awake the next morning a BA."
"Simply put, Brauerei Aying brews great beer. They're far and away my favorite German brewery and seem incapable of a making a misstep (note to self: revisit Celebrator now that you have more palate experience). Although Munich Helles Lagers will never be my favorite style--and aren't even in the top 10--Jahrhundert Bier is a delicious treat and is probably the best beer of its kind that I'll ever drink."
"from the bottle. poured a cloudy yellow with a white head. aroma, citrus, hops, yeast, lemony, pepper. flavor, was surprised by the sweetness that 1st came out, malts, sweet apples, orange, with a touch of lemon. has a nice smooth and creamy mouth feel to it. this would be a good summer beer."
"Pale gold color.really nice head with excellant lacing.Nice crisp aroma and flavor.A little citrus,nothing heavy.Thirst quenching,definitely!Last week I tried Ayinger Hefe-Weisse and was very impressed, it was my first of this style ,but definitely not my last of those babies.So ,since I liked that so much when I saw this lager by the same brewery, I had to give it a shot.There was a moment of hesitation when I got home and took the bottles from the four pack and realized there was actually fuzz and dust in the bottom of the carrier.It was then I noticed the layer of dust on the bottles.Uh-oh, in my haste did I just toss my hard earned money away on something that has been sitting around since George W. Bush was only an embarrassment to Texans.Lo, my fears were unwarranted.I don't know how old this brew is , but it was great so I don't care.Give it a try ,it's worth it."
"Pours a light, transparent, hazy yellow color. The head is mammoth and brilliantly white, with considerable staying power. Small strands of bubbles rise consistently from the bottom of the glass. This is a nice-looking brew. The aroma is mix of malty, musty, and floral sensations, with a bit of citrus hidden in the back. The beer starts just mildly sweet, then truns to a grainy, grassy flavor. The flavor is quite intense, where the aroma is present, but restrained. Light and tasty, this is an exquisitely drinkable beer. Beers like this are the reasons why German beers have such a great reputation."
"Pours an oh so slightly clouded straw yellow colior with a nice full bright white head. Tastes nice and sweet with a great hoppy nip in the end. Malts are full of flavor for the style, and the hops add such wonderful balancee. This is a top notch basic german lager that is worth a sample if you see it."
"There is a little white head atop this straw gold body. The aroma is lemony with some light grain malt scent as well. Sweet malt up front, nice hop contrast, hints of lemon. Light bodied, refreshing, this is one of those great tasting brews that you could put a bunch down."
"This is a summer beer that has a little body and alot of flavor. I really liked this beer."
"Update - I sampled a 2011 vintage and this really is a terrific bier. The grain is strong yet incredibly sensual and the hops, usually too light for Americans' taste, are actually quite strong here and create an expertly balanced brew."
"A beer that doesn't fit well in the helles-type category, which is fine by me as I tend to find them drinkable but bland. Instead, it is a tart beer that reminds me more of Belgian session beers than the typical German beer. Very nice."
"This poured a pale and hazy straw yellow color. A small creamy bright white meringue-like head topped off this beer. The aroma is light and has a grainy sweetness, along with a pleasant floral hoppiness. A light tasting beer, but with a solid body of malt. Overall, this is light and estery with small hints of sweet fruit and an inviting hop bitterness that seems just right in this beer. A satisfying soft lager beer that is easily drinkable."
"This one was somewhat disappointing to me as I normally love Ayinger products. The ""Hundred Year Beer"" poured a hazy yellow color that had a small, quickly disappearing head. It smelled primarily of the malt with a little hoppiness. The taste though is a kind of musty malt taste. It is very full-bodied in the mouth, but is not as satisfying as some other Ayingers. Not bad, just nothing special."
"This was a pleasant surprise. I probably shouldn't have been surprised, seeing as how Ayinger is a high quality brewery, but nevertheless I was. It may be a bit simple for some, but I fully enjoyed this offering from the little brewery in Aying, Germany."
"Ausgezeichnet!"
"I could drink this like water, without thinking that I'm drinking water...and for that I'm awarding a 5 in drinkability. Exceptional is right."
"This is a fine dandy drinker of a beer. Perfect for warmer weather days, or even any Ol' time as a session brew."
"The taste is very balanced with a bitter clean finish. A great lager in my book."
"A nice helles."
"Superior Drinkability balances all the flavor components well. Probably one of the top 3 lagers in the world."
"Overall, I was thoughly impressed with this one and will buy again."
"Cloudy, golden in color with a huge white head that lasts, nice lacing. Bready, grainy and flowery aromas, starts sweet and bready with nice balanced hop bitterness, light bodied, good crisp carbonated mouthfeel, finishes clean with some lemon flavor."
"This was a very fine looking lager. It pours out of the bottle as a wonderrful light golden color. There was a nice foamy off-white head. The smell and taste were somewhat neuatral: neither hoppy or malty. This beer was not bad but it is not something I would search out again."
"Pale yellow straw color with a moderate head that quickly recedes leaving a minimal lacing. Aroma is weak, but malt and a touch of hops are noticable. Flavor is sweet, bready malts and a touch of barely there noble hops. Body is surprisingly full, not going to pass itself off as ""liquid bread", but it is heavier than I expected from the light color, flavor, and aroma. A good summer beer if you want something light yet malty, however there are better choices out there."
"This beer is a great answer to the pilsners of the world. I really enjoyed this style."
"The taste is crisp, clean, and impeccably balanced. Its very light, with a slightly clove-ish and lemon presence. The aftertaste is very quenching with an ever so subtle hop bitterness sticking to the back of the palate. Pleasantly surprised, great brew."
"Drinkability: Like many of the other fine German lagers, pull up a seat, listen to the oompah band and stay awhile"
"The color was very light, clear gold topped by a big creamy head. The lace was good. The aroma was malty, with some citrus and yeast elements. The taste was slightly bitter-sweet and a little grainy with some citrus (lemon). The finish was dry and citrusy with a little sweetness. A good beer for a hot day."
"The beer pours a pale gold color with a thick white head. The aroma is refreshing with a malty touch; not bad. The taste is good. It has a bit of pale malt and bitter hop flavor. It finishes dry, but manages to please. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a low bodied beer with good carbonation. It drinks decent; a fine beer."
"A little more hoppy and bitter than the weiss beer. The aftertaste is very strong on this beer. A funny blend of hops and malt. Maybe I can get used to it over time. Not as smooth as other Germans I have had."
"Lightly cloudy pale golden brew forms a poofy, meringue, snow white head with excellent retention and beautiful lacing. The head is sticky and thick with a densely soapy whipped consistency, forming one of the most beautiful looking brews I've ever had. Milky with just a hint of opacity. Carbonation is moderate. Aroma is delicate with a distant sweetness...grassiness, husken malts, pale grains, lightly perfumy hops all contribute to a nice, bready, satisfying nose. Mouthfeel is full, bright and crisp, with a smooth, lingering aftertaste. Medium-light in body. Taste is of the highest quality...perfectly balanced contributions of the above noted tastes and aromas..the water is clean and fresh, and the finish is bready with just a hint of cookie-like sweetness. It reminds me of mixing a Steinlager or Harp with 33% hefe-weizen. The only fault in this otherwise very good brew is an off-putting metallic ring about halfway through, with a bit of skunk."
"Pours out a cloudy light yellow with a nice big white head. Looks like a hefe. Aroma of lemons and grain, nothing to strong or overwhelming. This beer is very clean tasting. There is a strong lemon taste, and not really much else I can put my finger on. Not too different than a corona with lime (Sacrelige!). Good full mouthfeel while remaining refreshing. Very easy to drink, this would make a great session brew. ""Half pilsner half hefe"" pretty much sums up this beer. Good, but nothing to celebrate over as the name suggests."
"John"
"Very pleasant, and one of the most refreshing brews I've had in a while. Pairs pretty well with salad and/or chicken too."
"A surprisingly hazy, but a rather tasty example of a German helles beer. A hazy pale yellow lager with an astonishing crispness: like drinking fresh air. A very neutral aroma that could be considered malty. The malt and hops are balanced and the finish lightly dry, but the hops are not at all assertive in the way of other German pilsners. Light in color and body without being boring. This is a very straightforward incredibly crisp tasting lager that is very drinkable and desirable, if for nothing else, its remarkable fresh and firm maltiness."
"500 ml bottle with the coolest cap I've ever seen. ""Century Celebration Bavarian Lager", no discernable freshness date. I was surprised when I poured at how hazy it is...looks like a wheat beer instead of a lager. Nice big foamy head, and a potent aroma...grainy, sweet, citrusy hops. Tastes like it smells, highly carbonated, and very smooth. Good stuff."
"A soft, low-acid beer with enough bitterness to keep it very well balanced. Quite viscous and chewy in texture without ever clogging up the senses."
"A nice version of the style."
"Appearance: Slight haze going on with a yellow straw color light golden with a nice sized well retained white head, lacing is nice and evenly scattered big webbed patterns. Aroma: Some very gentle but evident hoppiness going on along with a signature grainy. Taste: Crisp smooth and refreshing describe this Jahrhundert - Bier or Hundred Year Beer, a creamy sweetness very flavorful when compared to other beers that pour this light in color, the bitterness is tame but balances the beer so well with the no flavors dominating here, very nice. Mouthfeel: It's not light bodied believe it or not nice mouthfeel with a slow even carbonation. Drinkability: Is superb for any German lager fan, this one hit's the spot after a stressful day with two exams."
"Clear light golden appearance. Big fluffy white head that retains nicely. Aroma is very pleasing. Soft pilsner malts. Flowery boquet of hop flowers. And a little sun baked hay. Body is about medium with a good dose of carbonation. Taste is herbal, grassy, malty in a bohemian kind of way, and also appropriately bitter for the style. Nice combination. Enjoyable and refreshing."
"Light overall aroma that's made up of a light, sweet watery and slightly grainy malt, with a small amount of hops backing. Clear, light yellow/gold with a watery look to it. Medium sized white fizzy head that subsides to a ring around the edge. Flavor is a mix of a malt base (grainy quality), but with hop bitterness present and firm (a little strong for style, Helles). Long dry and bitter finish that is also rather crisp leaving a thirst quenching quality. Fairly carbonated, which keeps it feeling heavier that it is, but also adds some fluffiness. Develops some smoothness in time. I was hoping for better. This is a beer that seems readily available, but not as good as I had hoped."
"This beer pours a huge head of big bubbles quickly filling my 'weisse-pilsner' glass. Head recedes with good lacing and a clumpy appearance on the surface. Color is of straw or hay, very pale, with medium clarity. Aroma is sweet and citrusy and a little pungent. Taste is sweet citrus with a smooth hoppy finish. Very light and balanced and easy to drink."
"Excellent lager nose--tawny with a little fruit, leads to an exciting palate of flavors. Complex palate offers an interesting display of yeasty flavor notes including vanilla, cinnamon and apples, along with a variety of grain notes. Very light on hops, at the finish. My favorite lager."
"This brew poured a very large white head of fine to medium sized bubbles that was mostly lasting and a cloudy wheat yellow body. With a mild hoppy aroma and the flavor of fizzy banana and hops, this beer goes down smoothly with a slight bite to its finish."
"I originally sampled this at a Bavarian beer tasting at Hi Time Wine Cellars in Costa Mesa, CA on 26 April 2003. I am writing this review from my notes. For me, there was nothing about this beer that stood out. It wasn't bad, but I certainly wasn't impressed by it. It was rather bland"
"Overall: A very good quality lager, imported by Merchant du Vin I have just noted, $1.99 for the bottle was not too bad for this high quality Helles Bier I thought. Makes a great, thirst quencher, and a very refreshing lager for a very warm night."
"Crystal clear in color-very clean and pure looking to the eye.Simple grain notes on the nose. In the mouth the beer shows alot of grain and an almost meaty/earthy like flavor that makes me yearn for veal sausage? Slight hint of cream corn mid-palate. A rather grain driven offering, with some melon chiming in on the finish-canteloupe? An interesting, refreshing lager that I would be happy to serve with my next encased meat sandwich-mustard only!"
"Drinkability: Good stuff here. Highly drinkable and superbly crafted."
"Light gold color. Large head. Aroma is floral and malty. A medium bodied dortmunder. Kind of malty, also not a lot of banana and clove flavor. Not very hoppy. Light and flavorful. Crisp and slightly spicy. Mouthfeel is full. Finish is crisp. Aftertaste is slightly bitter."
"Very pale straw color, clearish, and a nice 1/2 inch frothy head that leaves crystalline spidery lacing. Crisp nose, hoppy with generous amounts of mown hay. Very smooth malt impression, fresh nuts and honey with a sense of lightly toasted grain. Lower carbonation than I expected, lends a creamy mouthfeel. Decent hop steeping near the finish provides a nice crispness, but overall, I give this concoction marks on the malt side. Just a very pleasant beer, one that I can imagine drinking in quantity in the warmer months. Thanks to the guys at 1st Grand Ave. Liquors for selling me one of four preview bottles."
"Very light bodied, easy to drink."
"Not a bad golden lager by any shot. I'd say this probably ranks for the style of golden lagers excludng pilsners up with the Max Lagers Reserve Lager. There's not a lot of hops going on, but there is a maltiness that is pleasant and lightly sweet. The body is probably on the darker end of the golden style, but the carbonation was plentiful, but not overbearing. A nicely crafted lager."
"The straw/pale golden body with a big pure white foamy head is a one-of-a-kind, in a league of its own. I drank the first one too fast to notice the lace, so I popped open another and noticed some sticky lace. The floral hop and lightly roasted malt lasts a good long time. The lightly roasted malt is heavier than it appears and possesses a pleasing sweetness. A bountiful sharp-edged bitterness is lightly tempered with caramel notes. A faint note of vanilla is detected. Balances slightly, although the hoppiness remains dominant. Hmmm, grilled bratwurst would hit the spot right about now!"
"This particular brew poured a large white long lasting head. The lacing was not very good on the sides of my mug. This brew had a yellow body to it and a cloudy appearance. It had a fruity aroma to it. It was very bitter tasting in my opinion which isn't a taste that I enjoy all that much. An aftertaste was also observed."
"I didn't enjoy this as much as the Weisse from Ayinger but the Lagers are not one of my favorite styles. Nonetheless, this is what I can say is a classic German lager. It is a refreshing beer. Clean, malty and fresh just like the description. Reminded me instantly of some of the beer I had in Duesseldorf a couple years ago. Has that German taste to it. I don't know how else to describe it but I would drink it again. Not a dissapointment"
"I think I was expecting a little bit more out of this one especially, since itÂ’s their anniversary beer. It just didnÂ’t have that OOMPH!, that I thought it would. It pours a cloudy yellow/gold color with a medium sized, fluffy white head. Head retention is good and leaves a sticky lace. Aromas are of mild hops with some undertones of yeast bread. The taste was a mixture of fresh baked bread, citrus fruit, and earthy hops. There was a bit of a bitter aftertaste left in my mouth. I donÂ’t know if I got a bad bottle or what, but this one just didnÂ’t knock my socks off."
"This beer pours a hazy(some particulates) yellow-orange color with a large very bubbly disappating white head. The mouthfeel is slightly rounded and effervescent. The smell is rich, almost(but not quite) smoky. The taste is round malty with a sweet hoppy finish. A pleasant drinkable brew."
"A smooth medium carbonated mouthfeel is enjoyable along with some sweet malts and a touch of hops in the finish. The finish is pretty dry with not much of an aftertaste. A very enjoyable lager, most definitely worth a try."
"I had this head to head with Weihenstephaner original, my favorite lager. This more than held it's own. Pours a Duvel-like meringue head, which took a while to disapate. Nice, fresh malt taste. Quite clean and refreshing. Like another reviewer said, this is what A.B. should be making. Everything you could want in this style beer. Seems to have a decent kick, and would rate right up there with the Weihenstephaner, Paulaner Original Munich, and Sammy Smith's lager as the best examples of the style that I have tried."
"Pours very nice pale gold with a fluffy white head. The look is slightly opaque and the head lingers nicely after settling into a thin layer. The lacing is lasting and full. The smell is pleasant and bready; full of malt. The taste is quite nice with a slight citrus hint and good bitterness over the sweetness that seems short-lived. Good aftertaste after the creamy mouthfeel, although somewhat astringent. Overall this is a very nice Munchener style light lager that I'd go back to if it were easily available. Nicely bottled and presented. Great capping."
"This beer pours a clear light gold. Gives off a tight white head, great retention, leaves a thin lace behind A mostly hop aroma is present, fresh cut grass comes to mind. A balanced flavor of malt and hops for a dry finishing taste. A great session beer, with or with out food."
"Color is a pretty light-gold; head is frothy white. Aroma hoppy, slightly tangy. Flavor is nicely balanced between hops and a mildly sweet malt. Body is just right. Finish is medium-dry with a spicy attack right in the middle of the tongue. This is a flavorful, well-balanced brew with body...solid effort by Ayinger."
"All in all an excellent summer session bier."

"Poured a clear golden color with a frothy pure white head that faded to a 1/4 inch rather quickly leaving a thick spotty lace. Bready aroma, yeasty with a slight hop tinge. Taste is very crisp and clean. Slightly sweet with a little hop tartness too. A really enjoyable beer."
"the taste is pretty good with some nice malts. it has the good qualities o f a german brew. a medium body with mild carbonation and smooth as silk. there is a dougy characteristic that makes this an interesing beer."
"I was expecting a bigger and darker beer as a ""century celebration lager"" but was pleasantly surprised to find that this is very much a Munich helles with some added hop character. It showcases the hops, as well as a very nice round malt, but it's also superbly balanced and very drinkable. I'd love to try an even fresher example as I know that some of the hop character has been lost here."
"Delicate all-around and highly enjoyable."
"I cannot help but loathe this beer, the bouquet is horrible and it soils almost everything about it. I had to pour it outÂ…"
"My bottle may have been a little long in the tooth, since I noticed some aspects not noted by other reviewers.  Appearance was a little cloudy for the style (listed here as a Dortumunder, but on the bottle there was a notation ""helles export"").  Aroma was a little yeasty, and at the front the flavor was likewise yeasty and a little bready, almost like a weizen.  Good, solid mouthfeel, a little unrefined.  Overall, not a bad bier, but did not really grab my interest."
"pours a beautiful golden color with a creamy white head that sinks slowly and a nice lace down the glass.  Nice biscuity malt aroma to this one that is balanced out by the earthy hoppiness of the noble hops used.  Great biscuity malt character that gives the bier a great creamy mouthfeel.  The hops were a little more subtle that expected, but were still very nice as they provided a great balance to this brew.  Awesomely drinkable brew with its smooth creaminess and excellent flavor.  I don't generally like a lot of the lager styles of bier but this was an absolute joy to drink."
"Talk about standing to attention, not only does the head on this beer look like meringue, the lace also peaks like fluffy egg whites!  Quite a sight.  I'm all with the others on the citrusy finish.  It left my mouth squeaky clean.  And, indeed, it is refreshing.  I am more awake after drinking this baby."
"158"
"The huge fluffy white head settles painfully slowly.  It's a notch darker than a pilsner and is yellowish -gold in color.  Clarity is excellent.  Soft, slightty grainy notes in the aroma, with only a hint of a herbal noble hop nose.  Clean aroma overall, but not too exciting.  A clean malt sweetness dominates the flavor, but a clean hop bitterness does a fine job of both balancing the malt sweetness and adding to the drinkability of this brew.  There's a bit of a nondescript grassy finish, but the taste is overall clean and balanced, borderlining on being bland.  Although Jahrhudert is a well brewed beer, it leaves me craving a good helles, which has many of the same qualities, albeit with a more pronounced malt character."
"Notes: First brewed in 1978 in celebration of the 100th anniversary for Brewery Aying, a great choice for this creation. A wonderful malt profile. This beer makes you crave for more ... very appetizing. Went well with some dark rye bread and mild goat cheese."
"real nice slight fruit smell,nice and clean.Could drink alot of this one somewhat different than the dortmunder gold of Great Lakes Brewing,much more delecate.Liked em both havent had to many dortmunder syles but Iam sure this is a standard.Something to drink when eating a light meal."
"Clear golden lager, rising up to a wonderful puffy head. Absolutely delicious. Ayinger does it again. I love this brewery. Clean crisp taste, smooth, flavorful. Ayinger brews (this one included) remind me gently of apples. Complex taste that grows bolder with each sip. Leaves you feeling light as a feather  - most beers can make you a bit logy. Disappears from my glass very quickly, too quickly. If it was cheaper I'd probably drink it all the time. Man, if Anheuser Busch could learn how to make a beer like this, they could rule the world. Excellent complement to a weird pineapple chicken dish that I had."
"Impressive amount of both malt taste and aroma. This beer tastes like you are literally snacking on fresh grain. A touch of sweetness rounds out the husky flavor(which some may not care for but I certainly do). Hops are not that noticible to me, a slight bitterness though. Color is appealing and mouthfeel is initially crisp. Quality brew from a quality brewer."
