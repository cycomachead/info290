"I usually like a malty lager, but often find the Vienna style too sweet. I think this one does a great job of mixing the two, it's grain driven, more than the same old base pils malt, a tad sweet, but way more drinkable than the Vienna types. Just darker than golden, not much head, but a really nice carbonation on the palate. Some body for a pale lager, creamy a little too, but still crispy in the finish. Easily my favorite if the beers I had from Berghoff this week, and while still a real basic lager, it has some real character."

"All-in-all a fairly enjoyable beer."
"I mistakenly let this warm a bit before pouring. Corn comes out more. Poured with a nice, large, foamy, frothy, off-white head that soon settled to a light cover and a little lace. Color is a clear yellow with some bubble trails. Aroma is corn first then malt and a hint of hop. Flavor's very similar to nose, but strong carbonation adds significant tang. Body and carbonation are ok. Finish is a little like flavor but morphs into something not as pleasant and too long."
