"O: This one's not bad. It's got some nice bitterness and is pretty refreshing as a lawn mower beer."

"O: An American take on a German style. Maintained the softness of a helles while adding a nice hoppy punch to the flavor."

"Handsome clear amber in the glass with a modest foam. What I call the browned biscuit taste is quite intense. Lime and a touch of lemon. Woody and quite bitter at the finish. From the 12 oz can purchased at Bottlecraft in San Diego."

"O:  This is a decent take on the style.  Still not sure how much I like new world hops working with German style lagers.  Seems a bit discordant and unbalanced."
"Serving type: can."

"Pours to a huge sudsy detergent-like head that reduces to 3/8"" and patchy lacing. Color is deep golden. Aroma is malty honey sweetness and grassy, herbal hops. Flavor is light pilsner and biscuit malt notes and sweet white wine and grassy/citrusy hops. Mouthfeel is light and ""smooth"". Overall a tasty lager with good hop flavors."

"It's worth trying, but I did not enjoy it."
