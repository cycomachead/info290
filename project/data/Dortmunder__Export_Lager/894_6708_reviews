"Malt goes along with leather and tobacco, becomes a little sweeter as taste lingers on the palate, toffeish, then gets rolled over by a very livley metallic carbonation. A soft touch of yeast adds smoothness to the mouthfeel, while barley and hops carry a zingy freshness."

"A good example of how a decent lager should be."

"Lovely malty taste. Smooth finish. Lovely bouquet. At 5.3% it is a perfect accompaniment to many dishes. This is a beer to enjoy rather than quaff. I enjoyed one, i found the second a little bitter to the taste. I have only limited experience of Swedish beers but this tempts me to experiment further, as the intensity of the flavours is very much to my palate."

"M&O: to be honest it is less carbonated than desirable, but fortunately the body is not heavy at all and the flavour profile is generally moderate and quite simplistic. All in all, an easy drinking Dortmunder lager but I would personally expect a bit bolder hop and richer malt presence."

"Not a great one really, surprisingly considering the name but still ok. Basic dortmunder style but a step up from a cheap pale lager anyway so that's something."

"O: A better lager - it should be at 18.90 SEK à 330 ml. It's not for binge drinking, but it's a great match with most classic Swedish foods. A good alternative to both ales and lagers."
"O: One of the best and most original lagers I've had. Very different take on a German style, and I would dare say outdoes the German varieties."
"Skip and move on in Sweden, nothing worth trying here."
"A nice well balanced lager."
"Pours a nice amber gold colored. Flavor is kind of thickly sweet and malty. Borders on sickly sweet, but doesn't quite get there. (seems like it's a ""just barely"" thing) the thick sweetness is probably masking any other potential characteristics from showing well. It's okay, but too fuzzy and lacking sharp definition."
"This has a good feel to it, plenty of body for a lager, be it a Dort or an Export, and enough flavours to make it stand out from the crowd."
"A very good lager!"
"D: This isn't my favourite beer style, nice but nothing special."
"Overall: this Swedish lager was a nice surprise. Well-balanced, it results in a crisp and refreshing lager with a marked personality and a nice malt character without forgetting its hoppy strengths."
"Great, simple stuff."
"D: A good lager, way better than the standard euro lagers usually found in Sweden."
"Not bad at all, very sessionable. Spice/pepper/acidity could get old after a few, though. Pretty sure it doesn't live up to the name, but I would drink it again, especially on a hot day."
"This is a nice, clean tasting lager. Good for drinking when youre not after a lot of big taste, but you still want something way better than the biggest commercial beers."
"A nice and well done Dortmund lager with a fine palette."
"Very tasty indeed, much more complex than most other swedish crap lagers. Hoppy and with the bitterness that comes together with it. This is one of the better swedish lager I've drunk I'd recommend everyone to try this if they have the chance."
"A good lager, malty and hoppy, slightly spicy, lightish, slightly resiny, at times it came across as a bit soggy or sticky or something, still, very nice bittersweet flavour, i kind of liked it."
