My advice: Buy it at one of the harbor shops when taking the ferry from Germany to Scandinavia. Drink it only from a can. Served best at punk concerts!","Ekkard","Aug 29, 2012"

3,-5.1,3,3,3,3,3,"500ml bottle (labeled ""Hansa Pure Quality"" rather than ""Export""). Pours golden with a large white head, lively carbonation and much lacing. Nose is piney hops and biscuit malt. Taste is the same with a firm crisp body. Finish is medium and balanced. Very drinkable, thirst quencher.","mikeg67","Dec 07, 2010"
3.58,13.3,4,3.5,3.5,3,4,"Overall it is a style with few German examples that make it over here, of the 3 I have had it is the cheapest and least impressive but still a solid beer.","crossovert","Feb 27, 2010"
3.7,17.1,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"While this beer is not earth shattering, it is clean and flavorful enough for us to deem it a half decent session lager. Make it a night with some friends, warm pretzels and playing cards.","BeerAdvocate","Nov 13, 2009"

3.4,7.6,3,3,3.5,4,3.5,"A great Dortmunder especially for the price. Found a six pack of pint bottles at the grocery store. Pours a nice golden yellow with moderate white head and minimal lacing. Aroma is grainy but appealing. Mouthfeel is surprisingly full with a wonderfully smooth finish. Flavor is real good, seems balanced although a tad thin. Great choice on a hot day, very drinkable. Solid better than average representation.","kinger","Aug 04, 2008"
3.23,2.2,3.5,3,3.5,3,3,"Pours a clear straw yellow with a few strands of bubbles. There is a light foam on the top of the beer. Strong evervesance of dry malts and dried out grass. Lots of pilsner malts mixed well with German hops to balance out the malts and bring forth the dry character of the malts. A little too dry to be that refreshing. But sil hits the spot right after a hard days work and your waiting for dinner to finish cooking.","scruffwhor","May 15, 2008"
3.05,-3.5,3,3,3,3.5,3,"Just a generic alcohol twang with a smooth, almost silky backbite that does nothing. Could see drinking this after mowing the lawn or something over a Budweiser, but I'll spend extra money on better beer.","clayrock81","May 08, 2008"
3.13,-0.9,4,3.5,3,2.5,3,"From a 33 cl can, this one has a huge, puffy, beautiful white head. The head isn't incredibly long lasting, but when it falls, it does leave an intricate, clinging lace. The color is a deep, but not quite rich, gold. The aroma is sweet and perfumy. It's a mixture of sweet, pale malt and floral hops. Not bad. The taste is light and delicate. On the downside, it's a bit watery. Great balance, though, and the hops have present a nice theme through the beer. Not overly bitter, but they have a nice backdrop in every part of the sip. The body is a little too light, and the beer turned out to be a little less carbonated than it needed. Still, this one is a solidly good and clean dortmunder. Worth a try.","Suds","Nov 03, 2007"
2.43,-23.1,3.5,3,2,2,2.5,"I picked this up planning to have a couple or so over the course of an evening, figuring that it would be an easy style to ""session"". Yikes - this is embarrassing coming from the city that invented the style, as I've had better from there and locally. One is plenty - lacking and more unpleasant than not.","jwc215","Aug 02, 2007"
4.02,27.2,3.5,4,4,4.5,4,"From a 1/2 litre bottle at the cathedral known as Brickskeller, Washington, under the ""Hansa Dortmunder"" label. Smooth and golden with a thin white top, as expected. Very smooth across the tongue ... cereal malt, corn, and wheat here, but in a well balanced way. Nice little subtle hop finish. Classic to style. (#2776, 4/6/2007)","Braudog","Apr 08, 2007"

3.52,11.4,3,3.5,3.5,3,4,"Enjoyed with my pizza lunch in Siena Italy. I found it a great Dortmunder. Classic colour, deeper in golden. Aroma offers some pronouced hop notes, a great balance between malt/hop character. Carbonation and texture very agreeable. Refreshing and full of taste. A distinctly Dortmunder, and clearly defined apart from standard Euro lager. I liked it alot.","biegaman","Sep 30, 2006"
2.7,-14.6,3,3,2,3,3.5,"Pours a golden yellow color with fizzy white lacing. Aroma is a faint malty lagerish aroma with a faint whiff of herbal hops. Taste is clean and refreshing but pretty thin and unimpressive. The taste is just lacking something. I am not a huge lager fan so that does affect my rating. Overall, this is a below average lager that I have no interest in drinking again.","cjgator3","Aug 28, 2006"
2.46,-22.2,3,2,2.5,3,2.5,"Hansa Imported Dortmunder pours a golden color with a white head from a one pint brown bottle. Some skunk like hop smells are evident. Taste is fairly mediocre, hops are noticeable, but not particularly good. I probably could down a few, but I'd prefer something else. Not recommended.","Drew966","Jul 25, 2006"

3.56,12.7,4,3,3.5,4,4,"On a pairing note, goes incredibly well with a thin crust sausage pizza... this malty beer matches well with mild cheese, a little spice, and a doughy crust.","apintofknowledge","Jan 10, 2006"
3.35,6,3,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Poured into a freshly rinsed Weissbier glass ...Poured a pale gold with an expansive four finger head with some retention. Signifcant lacing left behind. Mildly carbonated. Aroma is faintly floral with yeast in the background, not overpowering at all. Tastes clean and balanced, no real outstanding charcteristics. Mildly hoppy perhaps with a little yeast. followed by a short dry finish. Not a chart buster just a good solid every day brew.","Citadel82","Oct 19, 2004"
3.05,-3.5,3,3,3,2.5,3.5,"There isn't too much to write about with this beer. It serves as a decent thirst quencher and I suppose it's a good value since the bottles are slightly larger than your average 12 oz. bottles. Average all around.","Beastdog75","Jun 04, 2004"

3.63,14.9,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"It pours a crystal clear golden body topped by a solid inch and a half of bright white froth. The retention is limited, however, and it drops fairly shortly to just a creamy collar and some lacy surface foam. The nose displays a mild combination of delicate grainy malt and lightly floral, gently spicy, and mildly herbal hops. It's clean and fresh, but not overly impressive. The body is surprisingly light for the Dortmunder style, and it's gently crisp on the tongue with a fine, median carbonation. There's a very nice balance of malt and hops in the flavor; although, like the body, it seems restrained for the style. Initially the malt captures your attention, but it quickly shifts towards floral and spicy hop flavors and a rising bitterness. It finishes quite dry but not lingering - very nice, and quite refreshing. That, at least, is like the Dortmunder lagers that I know and love. This seems almost like a ""diet"" version of the style with the overall flavor and balance dead-on, but not the full level of malt and hops required. It's refreshing and quite drinkable if you're simply looking to go through beer after beer, but I think it lacks enough in overall character that you'd soon want to turn to something with a little more ""oomph""! I'd suggest this as a good summer beer during a game of horseshoes or when tied to the grill with a yard full of guests. Otherwise, there are better examples of the style to be had.","NeroFiddled","Jun 12, 2003"
2.75,-13,3,3,2.5,2.5,3,"Easy pour gave no head, but if you slam this into a pilsener glass, you can generate a pretty impressive froth.  It kind of went downhill from there.  Aroma was a nondescript hint of brown sugar.  Flavor was sugary malt with hops following up with a very subdued, flat bittering.  Mouthfeel was thin, bordering on watery.  I was not impressed.","Brent","Aug 22, 2002"
1.98,-37.3,2.5,2,2,1.5,2,"The up-side? Umm... it *does* contain alcohol, and it *can* be followed by something else.","bmacaskill","Aug 10, 2002"
