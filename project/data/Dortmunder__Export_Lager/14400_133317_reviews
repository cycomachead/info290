"Overall, it's a refreshing, well-styled, day-drinking kind of beer—something I'd personally want for breakfast, even, since it's light enough for foggy-eyes but hearty enough to coat the empty stomach a bit.  It doesn't quite match up to Jinx Proof—a beer that's one of my favorites within the ""lighter lager"" universe, and that's likewise very underrated, to my mind—but it's probably more true to ""Dortmund-Style"" form, so points for that are in order."

"Overall, as a dortmunder / export lager, this one works. Try it if you see but remember its a dortmunder so keep it real folks!"
"Great representation of the style!"

"This is my first foray into Dortmunder Lagers. So far I like it a lot!"

"12 oz. bottle poured into a flute. A slightly hazy lemon yellow with a single finger of creamy white head comprised of particularly small densely packed bubbles. Aroma is cracker-like doughy malts, with a slight sweetness yet largely crisp and dry with an emergent nip of grassy hops. Palate is similar, crackers and biscuit with a hint of brown sugar, strong grass and herb noble hop flavors (tarragon, a hint of lavender?), low key apples and lemons, and palate-scouring flinty minerals. Nice medium body, heavier than a pilsener, with some carbonation bite and a multi-part finish, goes biscuit malt but swiftly transitions to bitter grassy hops. Although no hardcore Dortmunder expert, this closely jives with classic descriptions of the style: Softer than a pils, a little sweeter, a little hoppier (maybe this overshoots the mark but I'm not complaining, this is a not imported after all, hahaha), clear flinty bite. Wonderful."

"I was surprised with this Dortmund. Great balance, perceivable hops and a very subtle fruitiness you see on Kolsch. I would sure have this again."
"A pretty robust and enjoyable version of the old-world style - malty, hoppy, and worthy of the industrial might of the Ruhr valley in its goings between.  Could easily see killing a number of these on a summer patio, and the waitress wouldn't even have to necessarily be a blonde German stereotype, either."

"Pours straw gold and with pristine clarity. A white head of creamy foam that lasts to a ring and leaves a bit of lace as you drink.  Serene int eh glass with no bubbles coming up from the bottom.   Nose is clean and crisp. A bit of grainy sweetness from malt and a floral backnote from the hops. it becomes herbal as it warms but it is not too much for the style. there is s slight pungency from  sulfur on the nose.  No fruity scents. Lovely.  Taste is dry and a bit rich with a lovely light honey to grace the malt .  crisp on the palate with a good smooth mouthfeel. The bite from carbonation is perfect and does not hit until the swallow.  There it resides with a moderate hop bitterness. A touch more bitterness than the usual but not offensive.  The hop herbal sings on the mid palate and the light touch of sulfur adds a bit of dimension to this beer and actually accents the sweetness of the malt by contrast.  Finishes dry and with a bit of noble hops to linger in the aftertaste."

"Poured a clear golden body with a thin cap of bubbly white foam. A very good looking lager, though not amazing looking, like most of its kin. Scents of grainy, lightly sweet Pilsner malt, and medium levels of spicy, floral Noble hops and light sulfur notes upfront. Overall impression of aroma is of a crisp, clean, straight-forward lager aroma that is perfectly on point for a Dortmunder. Flavor begins with a moderate, soft Pilsner malt sweetness balanced by a medium-light level of spicy, floral Noble hops with a low level of bitterness. This moves into a middle that still mingles softly sweet malt with Noble hops, though the hops are slightly more prominent and the bitterness is at a medium level. Finish balanced, with a moderate level of sweet Pilsner malt, with a honey-like character and a moderate level of Noble hop flavors with medium bitterness. Aftertaste continues the moderate Noble hop bitterness and flavor, along with a nice light honey and grainy malt. Overall impression of aroma is of a classic Dortmunder. Balanced between Pilsner malt and Noble hops perfectly, just bitter enough and crisp and clean. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation and a smooth, creamy feel. Overall impression of mouthfeel is of a smooth, easily drinkable lager. Overall this is an amazing lager. It is a near-perfect example of a Dortmunder Export, with the style aromas, flavors and mouthfeel hitting the mark. It is a pleasant, crisp, clean beer and a great example of what a good brewer can do with a simple style."

"12 oz bottle from a six pack purchased from Winco in Salem OR $7.88. Pours an ever so slightly hazy bright sunshine yellow with a nice sized frothy white head. Lots of lemony hoppiness and biscuit malts, touch of fresh baked bread. Very well balanced drink with the hops emerging more at the end ,but malts dominate. Nice well carbonated mouth feel. But there is a strange astringency in the end that sort of bothers me. OK beer overall. But could do with a smoother finis"

"Poured into an Euler stange. Pours a light golden amber with a thin white head that dissipates to patches with slight lacing. Aroma of biscuit malt with slight citrus and grassy hops. Flavor is biscuit malt with hints of bread, light apple juice and lemon citrus; finishes with dry biscuit with grassy hops that taste authentic for a German style beer. Not one of my go-to styles, but this was very nicely balanced with a pleasant malt and hop component. Nicely done and great with dinner."

"O:  Pretty good example of the style.  I wish the noble hop characteristics were amped up a small bit, and it has a distinct (but subdued) toasted quality in the mid palate.  No complaints otherwise.  Pretty decent brew."
