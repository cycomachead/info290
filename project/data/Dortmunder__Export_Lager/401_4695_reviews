"O:"
"Crisp and refreshing Euro pale lager. Very decent. Closer to a pilsner"
"An acquaintance brought this over. He didn't know any better."
""
""
""
"Stinky aroma with a moderate skunkiness. Thin and watery texture. Very light non-descript flavor. Overall impression....watery.  Would not get again."
""
""
"I am neutral on this beer."
""
"O:  not that bad ... the sunlight/UV/whatever light has skunked it just a bit, but it's still super fruity for an overall smaller flavor/aroma profile"
""
""
"I did not like it."
""
"This is very much what I expected and hoped for. Baltika 7 is on par with most of the Euro lagers I've tried. There is less skunk in the nose, but the same notable malt-hop pairing I enjoy in the other ""green bottle"" lagers. It has a clean, smooth finish with an enjoyable light hop aftertaste. This would pair nicely with homemade borscht!"
""
""
""
"Overall I found that Baltika 7 Eksportnoe was quite easy to drink and it did the business after a long day of work. Having said that though, there was a small aftertaste that was quite strong but that brought a nice balance to the beer and I recommend this as a good session beer."
""
""
"Overall- Better than average, had a fruity taste than I expected.  I would drink this again."

"Final Grade: 3.18, a C+. Baltika #7 is a passable Euro lager, but it's a weak attempt at a Dortmunder (if that's even what they were going for). One thing I will say is that this is easily the best Russian beer I have ever tried, but to be honest I haven't had very many, and the others were pretty terrible. Baltika #7 is no masterpiece, but I'd have no issue with drinking another bottle here and there - but that being said, German and Polish lagers are better, easier to find, and often cheaper, so this one's utility is rather limited."

"After being told about this whole Baltika line by a former co-worker, I was relatively jazzed to find a few at my local Caputo's. This one pours a clear pale golden-straw topped by a finger of relatively short-lived white foam. The nose comprises wild rice, generic grain, light flowers, very light grass, and a splash of hard water. The taste brings in more of the same, though a firm semi-biscuit backbone is evident, and the flowers provide a cleaner hop thrust than before. Still, everything just kinda lies there, mostly lifeless, certainly character-less. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a slickly watery feel. Overall, this is just a boring, unassuming, little guy, something I'd likely confuse with any other bland Euro lager. It's not bad, per se, just nothing I'd ever really wanna drink again."

"The beer pours a slightly more pale yellow than most euro lagers and has a little hint of rice in the aroma. It is pretty nice, despite it probably having some adjuncts in it. It is refreshing with a light taste and good aftertaste. I'll admit this is probably not something I'll be buying a lot of, although it is a fine effort from Baltika, and certainly better than some of their non-export beers."
""
""
""
""
""
"On the lower range of drinkability among Pilsners. I found it a bit too heavy given its buttery notes on a sweet malty base. Number 4 is still their best bet."
""
""
"The flavor has a little more character with grainy malts, astringency, and a slightly lingering clean hop finale. Heineken, Carlsberg, St Pauli Girl - take your pick. It is very much like those but I think it is meant to be. Baltika #2 is better."
""
""
"Cheers!!!!"
""
"Overall it is sweet and drinkable."

"Presentation: Packaged in a custom 500ml (16.9 oz) green glass bottle with a pry-off crown, served in a New Belgium Brewing chalice."

"If you can taste without smelling, it's not bad for a dinner beer."
""
""
"By appearance this is better than your average lager. It smells like a good effort was made. By teste it's too sweet and fruity. The bready malts try to save the day but to no avail. I'll pass on this in the future."
"Pours a very clear golden yellow. Moderate head that lasts a few minutes. Good bit of carbonation, bubbles rose for at least 15 minutes. Malt and grain aroma. Taste is slightly malty and grassy. Pronounced mineral aftertaste. Not a great beer, but better than Bud or Coors. At least now I can say I've had Russian beer. I actually expected it to be worse than it is."
"Pours a clear golden yellow with a foamy white head that settles to a small cap on top of the beer. Small dots of lace slowly drip into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, and a slightly skunky aroma. Taste is mainly of malt and grain with a mild corn flake flavor on the finish. There is a mild bitterness on the palate after each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty poor beer that doesn't smell or taste very good."
""
"O: There were some artificial notes in there that really hurt the flavor, otherwise it would have been a normal export lager."
"O - not as bad as I thought it was going to be."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-It is good,but not many different then No3."
""
"O-I actually love this. It has a taste of high quality and it's so drinkable! This has got to be the best euro lager I've ever had. I wish I could find this by the case here. It is quite cheap though!"
""
""
"Not horrible, not great."
"Served in a branded pilsner style glass. Very light in colour, with a sweet nose. Grains come in strong at the front, but it finishes fruitlike, perhaps a melon, I has having trouble determining what type. Not terribly complex, but pretty solid and consistent. A nice afternoon beer."
""
"Overall, a good beer. Haven't tried many Russians, so I don't have much to compare it to, but it reminded me a bit of Steinlager Pure (a Euro Pale Ale)."
""
""
"I recommend this as a very easy to drink lager. The flavor is spot on."
""
""
"O: This beer is easy to drink and goes down easily. I would have no problem knocking back a few of these."

"Out of a bomber this beer was a clear golden color with one finger of white foam. The retention was only average and it left mild lacing. The aroma was of macro grains, a hint of floral hops, sweet malt and a little bread. The flavors were pretty much exactly like the aroma: boring and right down the middle. Drinkable, to be sure, but so blasé as to be unappealing. The mouthfeel was fine, the body medium/light and the carbonation bit light too. Just kinda uninspired and clearly like a Budweiser for the Russian working class."
""
""
"Extremely smooth and easy to drink, even a little too easy going down - this could be a good summertime brew or even a session beer. Number 7 is similar to but just slightly better than the Baltika #2 or the #5 in my opinion."
"500ml bottle.Dimpled mug.Enjoyed on mar´12.Pale straw yellow.Slightly foggy.White froth.Close quickly dissipated crown.Metallic & grassy odors to the nose.Enters fizzy,hard water.Medium body, high carbonation. Grainy,astringent.Tastes as a carbonated mineral water -sparkling,flat & fat-."
"Overall, not bad. I could put these down in the summer, and have them with grilled food, but this is a bit flawed to want to have 6 on ice. Just ok. Didn't hate it."
"O: This beer would be excellent on a really warm day, I wish had I had tried it earlier this week when it was in the upper 70s vs. this afternoon when it is in the high 50s. The beer is easy to drink and refreshing but not something I would go out of my way to find - though they likely carry it at any Russian or Eastern European grocery/convenience store."
"Poured from the bottle, this beer is a clear golden/yellow colour that reminds me a bit of citrus soda. Head, at first, is big and billowy, but fades quickly to nothingness. Smells of biscuits, citrus, grass and grains. Tastes very clean. Subtle citrus, some grains, and a touch of dry hops. Mouthfeel is thin, crisp, and a tad dry. A decent lager, and a few steps above swill."
"Overall - Refreshing lager by Baltika. One of the better mainstream/export lagers I've had in a while. Was surprised to see the pull-tab style cap on the bottle. This brew is certainly good for a hot summer day."
"An OK lager, but nothing special. Clean, bland, watery and probably quite refreshing on a hot day. Would be an acceptable choice in the absence of any alternative, but I won't be picking this up again."
""
""
"for style I liked it but wouldn't go searching for it, I think the coolest part about this beer is the peel off cap. I'm a little surprised the razor sharp edge left behind hasn't caused lawsuits."
""
"O: Not a bad beer, and good for what it is. Eminently quaffable... Still not my cup of tea..."
"I'm not the sort to drink beer while I do yard work and such, but if I were, I suppose I'd drink something like this. I see Baltika #7's chief selling point being that it is a worthy substitute for water. I suppose that's not saying much."
""
"Well, I was expecting a metric-tonne shitload's worth of Euro-skank, given the clear green bottle, and other unjust prejudices. Turns out, one should not judge a book by its cover, as this is a decently malty, softly-tinged hoppy Euro-lager. Maybe not up to the stringent standards of the Teutonic style source, but still agreeable enough - mea culpa, tovarisch."
"Overall, the first half of the taste is really quite nice but it just drops off to a watery nothingness. Nonetheless for the price it is a pretty decent beer, just nothing outstanding."
""
"Pull-back cap lets out a champagne-like pop. Very pale straw-yellow color shows a stunning clarity. Hints of cooked hops, fresh-cut grass, lemon zest and some alcohol in the nose. Dry maltiness still has some body to it; dried grass with some spicing from the hops. Kiss of green apple skin. Hint of alcohol, perhaps not so clean, but not so much as to be a bother. Bitter hopping is here and lingers into the dry finish. Half decent, relatively easy to quaff back and certainly better than most mass-produced lagers."
""
""
""
""
"Smooth finish."
"D- I expected the worst. It wasn't bad. It is one of the lightest beers I have ever had."
"Appearance pours a golden yellow color with a white fluffy head leaving fair lace. Smell is yeasty, adjuncts and a note of fruit warehouse. Taste has a clean lightly sweet graininess with a bit of light fruit in the background. Mouthfeel is light with a nice spike of carbonation. A very enjoyable lager I wouldn't mind going back to."
"D ~ I honestly liked this beer, regardless of the average reviews. Who cares if it is mass produced if it tastes decent. Will easily buy again. Great price."
"Overall: aside from the skunking which was my fault it was a light, crisp and refreshing beer and definitely a good sessionable beer at that. It fits all the guidelines but if it wasn't for my mistake, it probably would've been a little higher...but it probably shouldn't be in a green bottle. All it takes is 30 seconds of sunlight."
"Overall I didn't hate this as much as I thought I would. I really hate the Belgian or European yeast strains and hops. So I didn't go into this expecting much. Not a bad beer though. Not even close to my top 100 but not a bad summer beer. Thanks to Bill for this sample."
"Notes: Overall this is not too bad a bit thin but still decent. Cheers."

"Tastes like the except sweeter, almost as if some maple syrup was added. A little distracting. Good body with a higher level of carbonation. Very short aftertaste--mostly grainy malt."
"M&D: lightly effervescent, medium-minus bodied, a lacklustre interpretation of this beer style. I can’t find anything bad about this beer, apart from the fact that nothing stands out, either. At any rate, my palate agrees that alc. is hidden pretty well."
"M: A light beer. Very carbonated, which was a little overwhelming at first. But overall, very drinkable. Just not much there taste-wise."
"Easy drinking, light on the palate, and nicely carbonated for the style, this is without a doubt one of the best beers that I was able to enjoy on my trip. It likely doesn't travel well, judging by the reviews on here, but in the motherland, this is definitely one to try. I would seek this out if I was in Russia again."
"Dr: In spite of its balance issues, it does maintain a certain perverted refreshment capability in its first half. I wish they'd clean up the latter bit, but it does have some value. It isn't worth its price in Ireland, but is likely worth it in other locations if you're looking strictly to get bollocksed. In general, I think it's a beer to be avoided if you're a serious beer fanatic."
"The beer was a clear pee yellow color with a thin bubbly white head that quickly faded. Strong, skunky smell with a hint of lemon and hay. The taste is mostly grassy with some sweet cereal flavors in the background. There is also a slight lemon and bread aftertaste. The beer is light and fizzy, the finish is just a bit dry. This is a pretty average beer, tastes like most Euro lagers."
"O: I thought this was a good middle-of-the-road lager. Nothing special but a good beer for watching sports or washing down a pizza."
"O - Decent lager, fit for both proletariat and bourgeois! Not overly complex but with a nice body and fairly easy to knock back."
"As an import beer, this lager is not competitive with many other domestic and imports, whether on price or interest or quality."
"One of the first Russian beers I had ever had. This brew reminded me of a Becks. The color was a yellowish gold, the aroma wasa little grassy and had a but of a funk to it. The taste was bitter in the same ways as the aroma. The brew seemed to be much like a German Lager and not so much of a Russian one."
"Ahh, the Crack & Glug, sometimes the best part of a CAN of beer. I have come to really appreciate the auditory nature of CANs. I achieved a finger of rocky, bone-white head with very limited retention. The color was a beautiful sunshine-yellow with NE-plus clarity, allowing me to peer through the wall into the neighbor's kitchen. Nose had a characteristic lager sweetness, free of adjuncts. I am in lust! I am so sick of AALs in a CAN that I could scream! I may have to order up some more of this, now that I have a source identified. Mouthfeel was tending towards thin and it had a very dry taste to it, very little sweetness of which to speak. Instead, it kind of reminded me of a better-made Minhas, with a light cotton candy flavor and no plastics factory. Hmm. Finish was likewise dry and refreshing. I would put this in the cooler for a day at the beach, definitely. Howzabout Brighton Beach? Maybe I could latch onto one of those Russian expat honey honeys ... maybe I'd just best leave well enough alone."
"D- Decent enough to session, not worth spending the import price tag."
"Pours a pale yellow with a medium white head. The aroma is skunky and of plastic, but with a hint of actual hops and pale malts. Flavour is corny with a bitter bite at the end that suggests hops, as well as some skunk and sulfer. Really nothing too bad all things considered. Mouth-feel is quite light but biting and lively."
"Pours almost clear, pale yellow with a thin soapy head. Smeels similar to cheese, there is also a grainy sort of grassy note here too. Tastes mildly hoppy almost skunky, it has a little bit of a crispness to it but that is overshadowed by its watery texture. Mouthfeel is like water, the only reason I know its not water is because it is carbonated. Would not have again, this is a drain pour."
"FourthBeer potential: NYET, COMRADE! I don't like wasting beer, and halfway through I was struggling to enjoy this, but it's not like a Keystone that I'd openly dump out in the backyard. And while it's more expensive, I'd choose this over Keystone because, while the taste isn't great, at least it has a taste, and does put hair on your chest (figuratively, at least I hope). That, and drinking this beer allowed me to write a review of it with over-the-top Cold War-era metaphors. You're welcome."
"If you can find grenchki (very crispy rye bread toast-fries with garlic and mozzerella), 7 fits well with them for a night of drinking in St. Petersburg."
"I did not like this beer. It was fresh, part of the LCBO gift pack. No direct sunlight, though you cannot stop the less disasterous flourescent lighting in the store. The beer had a light yellow colour to it, carbonation bubbleswere apparent, and there was a big cheesy head. The horse and cheese aromas made it unapproachable. Boozy and sugary.Watery."
"Pours a clear yellow colour with small, bubbly white head that dissipates to nothing fairly quickly. No lacing on the glass at all. This smells fairly bad atually, though the bottle is fresh I believe. I don't get any hops, hardly any malt. No real bitterness. Big carbonation level. I don't want to have this again."
"Poured a 1.5"" head which dissipated pretty quickly. Pale pee yellow in color. Aroma has hops and citrus. Taste is standard cheap lager with corn and not much else. I'd say though this is equal or better to most of the American versions of cheap lager. And I'm grateful due to the can it didn't have even a hint of skunking despite all the time and distance between its foreign brewery and my mouth."
"Refreashing and thirst quenching, but not really tastey in any way. Dry rather than sweet, but again not really dry either."
"This beer smells like an India Pale Ale (IPA) which I really HATE -- Yet it tastes about like Coors Light, only better. Coors Light is strong in alcohol but weak in flavor. Still, I'd choose this beer above Coors Light dammit!, If I weren't so poor. ;) Because even though similar, it does taste much better than Coors for sure!"
"Clear, Clear, Clear! If it wasn't for a slight yellow tint I would think it was water. Wow it is crystal clear. The pure white head is about one finger thick. The nose has a barely noticeable skunkiness to it but nothing else? Some soft bitterness and maybe a grassy note on the end. There is nothing to this beer but it is easy to drink. I think this will score low, not because it's not any good, but because there is nothing to it."
"Dortmunder is a working man's kind of beer. It is a simple but substantial style that is naturally gifted in the ways of quenching thirst and providing clean, wholesome sustenance for those nights were the rounds just seem to keep coming. It is a prime example of the kind of proud and efficient engineering for which the Germans are renown."
"D - Overall not a bad beer to have in the summer while doing some chores in the heat but would definitely avoid it in the future."
"Drinkability: a decently drinkable little lager. This would make a good summer beer and probably a good tailgating beer. I'd like to see it around here in cans."
"Would pair nice with veggie burgers and some waffle fries. Or you could pair it with something spicy -- it would provide a refreshing counterpart."
"The beer pours a light yellow color with a white head. The aroma is grassy hops, lemon, grain and wheat. The flavor is lemons, wheat and grain. Not too much in the flavor, but it is not skunky like so many green-bottled beers. Overall, the beer is better than I expected. Easy drinking, light mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"D - Refreshing on a hot day but somewhat boring at the same time."
"Drinkability: Not bad, but pretty average overall. I would be willing to drink this again, but not ahead of many, many other things."
"Overall, a pretty nice beer, worth a shot when you see it."
"Poured from a green 16.9 oz. bottle. Has a clear, pale yellow color with a 1 inch head. Smell is mild, some malts. Taste is crisp, a bit sweet, malts and finishes a tad bitter. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and is very drinkable. Overall this makes for a decent brew."
"Nothing to recommend this one. Pretty anonymous like a zillion other Eastern Euro macros. Drinkable, but not interesting or exciting."
"Picked up a 6pack of green 11.2oz bottles. The pop-top opener was a real crowd pleaser. Poured into pint glass. Appearance was light yellow, some bubbles and head that disappeared rather quickly. Light carbonation. Taste was better than expected. Not as skunky as other Easter European beers. Sweet and malty. I Could drink plenty of these."
"Drinkablility; This is a easy drinking session beer that goes great on a hot day like it was yesterday. Nothing special but great to have around when finished cutting the grass."
"If I don't think about it too much, it's really not a bad lager. Better than most American macros. This is a drinking beer, not a tasting beer."
"Poured from a 16.9 oz bottle with freshness date on back of label. Poured into my Baltika glass. Bright yellow color with no head and not much added carbonation. Refreshing lager with some very minor hints of spice and hops. Slight metalic after flavor. Seems like a good solid choice for a lager on a warm day."
"On my trip to finish this entire series. Poured a 500ml green bottle into my Hennepin globe glass. This beer pours a crystal clear straw with a big 3 inch bright white cap that leaves just a little lacing. A steady stream of tight bubbles emanate from the sides of the glass replenishing the head. Man, I cracked this one open and instantly the whole room spelled like green bottle funk. Wow, I had a #5 just a bit ago which came in a clear bottle and nothing like this. The nose is, well, funky. Sulfur from the spoiled hops, bready malts, and sweet corn. The taste is exactly the same. No difference. The green bottle funk definitely overpowers just about everything. Reminds me of Grolsch. I've had beers (Saison Dupont comes to mind) where the bottle funk adds just a subtle layer of sulfur to the flavor profile, but this just overwhelms it. Dang. And the say the use less hops in this then their other lagers. Kind of scares me. The mouthfeel is a bit heavy for a lager. Overall this isn't a horrible beer but the funk is just to much."
"This starts out sweet like the smell, but then finishes with a small amount of bitterness. I expected an explosion of carbonation, but was met with very little. This makes it easy to drink. I enjoyed it but didn't find it as anything special."
"Overall: excellent lacing and the Baltika glass makes this a compelling drink on New Year's Eve, although I bet if this were next Thursday night, I might not be as festively aroused by its aesthetics... pours well with potato skins, pizza bites and mozzarella sticks..."
"D - It's cheap and the ABV is fairly low but this beer doesn't have a whole lot else going for it. Maybe it's better on tap in Russia."
"Combination of taste and price makes this a quite affordable beer to sip."
"Bottle from the LCBO- Sparkling gold pour, topped with a foamy bleached white cap. Nose of grainy malts, mild grassy hop, a bit skunky to be honest. Tastes sweet, of pale malts, sharp grassy hop, a bit metallic. A bit of a bite to the finish. Overally pretty bland."
"drinkability is high and for 2bones a pint i will buy this again"
"Cheers"
"Straw yellow body with fluffy white cushion of head resting on top. Head lasts fairly long and leaves patchy lace behind. Smells of bread and hay with some lemon lingering in the background. Doughy malt, bright lemon, and a kiss of hop bitterness in the finish. Crisp. Alcohol gets a little rough as it warms. Light bodied with low carbonation. Not watery, but close to it. A simple lager, just make sure you don't let it warm up to quickly. Better served cold."
"Well it's an export luckily it only gets exported here in Christmas gift packs. Here's hoping the other beers in the pack are better."
"Ugh, taste unfortunately follows suit closely. Actually worse than it smells due to a molten plastic flavor joining the aforementioned foulness from the aroma. Tastes like groundwater pumped from one of the chemical plants on the ship channel. Drain pour for sure and easily the worst Baltika offering I have had."
"Green bottle with a cool pull-tab cap. Crystal clear and possibly the palest yellow beer I've ever seen. A soapy, frothy, bright white cap appeared during the pour and remained for a surprising amount of time. Streaky and spotty lace. Aromas of cereal grain, barley husk, hay, and lemon. Low bitterness. Sweet yet mild flavour, a bit of cereal and lemon/lime, slightly fruity, faint mineral finish. Very light bodied without getting to the point of being watery. Medium to low carbonation aided the texture, keeping it from being harsh. Actually, it was fairly smooth. Quite clean and refreshing. This one was a surprise for me, based on my experience with this line of products. Easily one of my favourites from this brewer and a superb lawnmower beer."
"Cheers!"
"O: Quite drinkable. Quite honest Lager"
"There are much better Baltika options."
"Bready, coarse and lightly sweet. Not bad."
"I scored this lager as average across the board, so it got a C, it's not a yucky C, just..average. Glad mine wasn't skunked."
"Interesting, quite sweetish brew, however not a champion in smoothness; leaves a sweet-bitter aftertaste, which perhaps makes this a good thirst quencher"
"I might buy this again, depending on the price."
"mouthfeel is light and crispy. light-bodied and drinkable. a refreshing brew for hot weather or in between big beers as a palate cleanser maybe."
"For the price it is better than Heineken, and looks very different than the others..."
"Although this is labeled as an export lager, it seems more like a Stella Artois with a pinch more of alcohol. At least this beer is inexpensive in the 500 ml bottles."
"Overall a decent adjunct euro lager."
"Overall, not a bad one, maybe too thin."
"Thin and not necessarily pleasant."
"The foam was light wheat/white in color that dissapated quickly but a small ring around the glass til the end. The smell was a typical crisp hops and a little metallic. The taste was sharp, light, very hopsy - Russia's version of the American lagers and pils but better. Color was light honey wheat. Mouthfeel was sharp and smooth. Drinkibility was ok."
"The taste is grain with lightly herbal hops, mostly on the sweeter side with a light bitterness. A light mineral-water quality is noticeable after a few sips. The taste is like a fuller bodied, more flavourful basic American lager more than a European one. It's basic, but good and very drinkable."
"Do not recommend."
"Overall - This is not a bad lager. Actually, it is quite tasty for the style. The cap on the bottle is different as well, kind of cool. Don't know why the green bottle however. When I first opened this beer it smelled a bit skunky, but that went away."
"Pours a clear light gold that is more colorful and has a nicer head than your average lager. Nose is nothing special but nothing to complain about: a clean, sweet graininess with a hint of hops. Taste is very simple but dependable. I taste a light graininess with just a touch of lemony hops. This beer is not great but definitely not worth complaining about. It aspired to be average and easily hit its mark."
"A slight notch above the regular Euro Lager, but not something I would ever buy again."
"Inoffensive, no outright unpleasant characters, but nothing special."
"Overall, don't waste your time on spending more money for this export than you would on a regular American beer."
"very easy to drink."
"Pale, clear yellow-gold look, some nice lacing and a generally thin head. Aromas had a weak metallic tone with typical bread characteristics. Dry taste that was really refreshing actually. Watery and light, allowing a smooth taste. Lagging dull bitter taste after a few sips. Overall, a really nice, light drink for the evening."
"Another note, this might be a great transition beer for people who are macro oriented to go ahead and try other things. My father isn't the type of person who likes to try new beers, but when I handed him this, I found him coming back for more next time he was in town."
"D - Easy to drink and unoffensive. Nothing wrong with this brew, but nothing really stands out either. Forgettable but not bad."
"D - Compared side by side with #3, this our is so much better. More flavorful and with a light hop kick."
"M&D- Medium-light and refreshing as hell"
"Not too familiar with Dortmunder lagers but this did not seem too far away from a standard Budwesier in many ways, again not bad for the money but probably would skip buying again, might be worth trying"
"D - Very light. Nothing offensive about it, but not a particularly enjoyable beer."
"Drinkability: Just another simple European lager. Similar to the #5, except with a dialed down sweetness."
"D - For a Dortmunder/Export lager its not really anything special but if you call it an American Macro its a decent beer and for the cheap price tag its not bad as well try if you want something new"
"A nice beer overall. Maybe my favorite from the bunch known as Baltika. Good, clean, crisp, solidk beer."
"D: Pretty easy to drink beer from Russia. Cheap for an imported beer, I could see myself drinking this again for the price, but wouldn't seek it out."
"I'm thinking this beer doesn't have the depth of flavor to keep me coming back for more. I guess if I drank everything else in the room and the Ruskie was all that was left I would say Slainte since there is no cheers in Russian and bottoms up. Spasibo"
"Thirst-quenching, refreshing, easy-to-drink with a nice taste, I could easily ""session"" this. One of the better export lagers out there, IMO."
"I'm guessing this is Russia's version of Miller Light or Budweiser. I drank it straight from the bottle, which seemed much more fitting for this than it did for the other Baltika's that I've tried. Anyway, it had a pretty mild flavor and watery texture. It had a generic but mostly clean taste. There's not much more to really say about this. Overall it was better than a Budweiser, but it was still pretty boring."
"taste was a bit sweet, mild hops and not much else I can say except that it was very smooth with no offputting qualities.mouthfeel was bubbly and a bit creamy. overall this was a pretty decent beer, I could easily have a session with these and they went down very smooth."
"Got the 'mini-keg' offering. Not bad taste, just not much taste at all (a little bit of corn, maybe?). Looks suprisingly good, refreshing, but no real taste. Very thin mouthfeel. Very well priced given the serving offering, but nothing too special. I would probably by overe most common Macros for the price."
"This isn't an instant favorite of mine but it is still a decent beer. It's just another typical export lager."
"D - A very simple and drinkable brew. Nothing special going on here....seems like a fairly run of the mill German Pils IMO, but I could drink a few of these with no problems. Might be nice with lighter foods."
"A big foamy head that takes a while to dissipate. A nice golden lager. Impressive that it still retains a 1/32 inch head throughout drinking it. A very clean crisp taste with a nice dry finish."
"another brew from Russia; this one pours a pale yellow w/ fluffy white head which dissapates quickly, good lacing; slight hop aroma, some underlying ""ricey"" kinda smell; very ""watered down"" tasting, slight hop bitterness, light macro-rice syrup type flavor, maybe a little better grain-rice ratio than a US beer, tho; again, very thin, light, watery body, thirst quenceing, could possibly drink a few on a warm fall day..."
"Green bottle notwithstanding, this was a refreshing and tasty, pale lager. A pleasant surprise."
"Drinkability is just so so. Nothing to really recommend here. To be honest the only reason to try this is if you are trying to try all the Baltika beers. Some of the Baltika's are winners like #6 and #8 and some are turkeys like this one."
"The beer poured a light pale gold the head was white and quickly went from rocky to a lace. The aroma was of sour malt and beer. The taste was of sour malt with some light hops and a citrus finish. The feel was light and dry. Not a bad export, no bitterness and not overly hopped."
"Export beers are meant to age a little while, which should explain why this beer is so much better than the other Baltikas that find themselves halfway across the world, in the Mid West. Though nothing special that's worth seeking out, this is a decent enough beer. I'd love to get a chance to try it fresh."
"Better tasting than a domestic lager and much more enjoyable."
"another beer from the Baltika Challenge we held. This one wasn't one of the better ones. poured with a totally white head and a straw colored body. malt and corn and ethanol odor like a stinky old malt liquor. taste is bitter, astringent and dry....im thinking amstel. its funny because Vlad (the Russian we were drinking with) said that this is supposed to be the version of #3 that they export out to everywhere else. why do they think non-russians want to drink a shittier version of #3? eh. thin and not a good drinkin' beer."
"Pours a clear gold, with a slight white head. Nose is, surprise, grainy corn. Slight alcohol, and a bit of mustiness. Taste is mild old malts and grains. Not too interesting, but not offensive. Mouthfeel is a bit thin, drinkability is so-so. Overall it's just a bit boring."
"Adam"
"Drinkability  Im not a huge fan of the style but this seemed right on the mark."
"Pours a five finger white head that fades quickly to a ring leaving traces of lace. Chrystal clear amber color. Light carbonation and light-medium bodied. Skunky nose. Starts sort of sweet, corny/grainy not much flavor. Easy enough to drink on a hot day but I'm glad I bought only one. $1.95 for a 500ml bottle from Colonial Spirits Acton, Ma."
"Not recommended in any way."
"Other than the exceptional #8 (Wheat) and the very good #4 (Porter), most of the beer from this brewery is merely above average. That's pretty much where #7 settles out as well. In a region of the world where good beer is pretty hard to come by, that's nothing to sneeze at."
"D- This light lager has some nice qualities but the carbonation really dominates the beer. It does enhance the hops a bit, and I would drink this over soda pop, but it just doesn't have the depth of flavor."
"Easy drinking, but also easy to forget, I've certainally had worse"
"Purchased a bomber (unfortunately it is in a green bottle). It pours a very pale straw color with a nice head. Smell is mild, as is the taste, not bad compared to a typical Euro lager. Nothing special, but drinks fairly well. I would drink this again, but not worth looking for."
"Clear wet straw gold with a 3/4 inch white head, that didn't last more than a minute or so leaving a small thin table and some bubbles on the glass. The smell is sweet hay with a clean malt base, a bit boring. Taste is sweet with a mild, but not too important, bitterness that is quickly overwhelmed by a sweet finish. The body is light and while this is drinkable enough, it isn't anything special. I'm not sure if it's the style or the beer, but it isn't my thing."
"The beer pours a pale gold color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a clean, crisp lager malt scent along with German style hops and yeast. The taste is decent. It has a pale malt flavor that goes down easy and finishes dry, yet surprisingly malty for a lager. It is lightly hopped and clean tasting. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a low bodied beer with good carbonation. This is a good export lager. It's light and easy drinking with a maltier approach than some."
"not reccomended"
"Big, white, fizzy head. Superclear, pale yellow beer. Streams of carbonation. Spoonk! from a mile away. Sweet front, a little chemically spoonk, a little corn, a little burnt toast. Quite full, sweet malt, a little syrupy. Finish is crisp spoonk and fairly sweet. More burnt toast and some alcohol. It's a fairly sweet, malty, crisp lager. Not bad. Fairly strong flavors."
"Pours a clear very pale yellow color with a nice creamy and tall bright white head that slowly dissipates into a thin lace. Nose is sweet malt and fresh grain and is rather clean. Taste is lightly sweet malt and is fresh and crisp with little to no hop bitterness present. A fairly simple light and refreshing brew."
"Opinion: On the scale of cheaper adjunct using macro-brews, I would put this one a little higher. Not quite with Kirin or San Miguel, but still it is an OK beer. Not one that I would seek out, but I am glad that I gave it a shot."
"The beer after its extraction from the 500ml green bottle resides in my glass a luminous gold with a diminutive frothy white head that evaporates quickly leaving a thin cover of lace upon the glass. Nose is archetypal lager sweet malt that is fresh, crisp and clean, with the start slightly sweet and the grain presence adequate but a bit light, top is fair to middling in its feel to the palate. Finish is pleasantly spicy as far as the hops go acidity moderate and the aftertaste desert bone dry, a passable beer, but nothing to get excited about."
"BB 12-09-05. Poors in with good head and nice&clear pale golden beercolor. Nose is strong malty with light hoparome reminding me of perlehops. Litle oxidation noticable but overal fresh. Taste is quiet dry, most certainly for a Dortmunder and misses fullness. Bitterness also dosed quiet low what makes this one tasting watery as mouthfeel is. Drinks easy but misses flavour."
"this was an excellent beer that can surprise most beer drinkers. It was light but full of flavor, that almost resembled Spaten. A nice crisp taste allowed it to go down easily and quench my thirst. It trully should be highly recommended. As a master of beer, I would say it is at the moment one of my top 25."
"Unfortunately this is packaged in a green bottle, but the price was right at $1.69 for a pint bottle. Baltika #7 is a pale yellow straw color. Carbonation is very good. The head is large and ultrawhite. After uncapping the bottle the aroma starts with a quick whiff of skunk followed by a pleasent, but generic grainy sweetness found in many euro pale lagers. The taste is diffenently that of a euro pale lager and not a Dortmunder. Flavor is nice and sweet with a mild grainy taste. The depth of flavor and malt profile are way better than the average euro pale. Drinkability is very good, this is a good session choice for those times when you feel like something tasty, but want something relatively light."
"Better than most macros is all I can say."
"The Baltika #7 is really not much different that the other golden Baltika beers in appearance, aroma, or taste. The only thing that seems to vary is the strength. It pours a clear golden body with yellow highlights and a full and foamy bright-white head that dissipates quickly. It keeps a decent collar through most of the glass, and even leaves some lace. The aroma displays some semi-grainy malt with a light sweetness. The body is medium with a soft carbonation that helps to give the impression of a fuller body than actually exists. The flavor is as the nose suggests, with an adjunct laden but still mildly grainy maltiness. The bitterness is restrained, and it finishes with some gently lingering sweetness. Overall, it's not a bad beer, but if I want an overly sweet adjunct lager I think I'll just stay domestic and have a Pabst Blue Ribbon!"
"Well, its definitely a special export, meaning kind of bland and very pale. Theres nothing wrong with it, just very pale and full of adjuncts. Interesting that in Russia, they are required to list the ingredients on beer cans. I found myself playing a game of seeing how far down the list I could go before encountering the word ""sugar."""
"The on tap version of this beer comes out closer to golden than the canned rendition. The head is also much more substantial, almost up to average. Interestingly, the malt smell from the can is much weaker on tap - hardly noticeable at all. The mouthfeel is all bubbly, like a Coke. The malts are definitely present, but I'm still looking for some hops. There was no finish and no aftertaste. Yeah, it's drinkable, but I'll always ask the bartender what else is on tap."
