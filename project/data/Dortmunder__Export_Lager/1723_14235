3.8,21,4,4,3.5,4,4,"500 ml bottle into lager glass, best before 10/5/2013. Pours slightly cloudy golden straw color with a 1 finger fairly dense white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Light spotty lacing clings on the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of bready grain, cracker, floral, pear, apple, light pepper, biscuit, and herbal earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance of light fruity esters with malt/hop notes; with good strength. Taste of bready grain, cracker, floral, pear, apple, light pepper, biscuit, and herbal earthiness. Lingering notes of bread, cracker, floral, light pepper, and herbal on the finish for a short bit. Good balance of malt/hop flavors with light-moderate fruitiness; and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth and fairly crisp mouthfeel that is nice; without feeling too thin. Alcohol is very well hidden with hardly any warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a very good dortmunder style. Very clean with good balance of flavors and minimal esters; and very smooth to drink. A nicely enjoyable offering.","superspak","Dec 24, 2012"

3.8,21,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Without going over the top with an in depth analysis, this is a good cheap lite tasting beer that works well with fast foods. Overall there is nothing too complex about it; this is trouble-free light lager made of barley malt and hops. Not a common beer to be found in my location, but still miles better than most in its price range and yet still very drinkable.","smokinyodas","Oct 06, 2012"

3.13,-0.3,3.5,3,3,4,3,"Overall this was an average example Export Lager. It was pretty light and smooth which made for good drinkability. The flavors weren't too impressive, but they remained true to the style. I thought I was buying a traditional German Export lager, and it was pretty close to that, it was just brewed in Namibia instead of Germany.I wouldn't search this beer out but it might hit the spot on a hot summer afternoon.","StoutHunter","Apr 16, 2010"
2.93,-6.7,3,2.5,3,2.5,3.5,"Drinkability is it best attribute. Very easy drinking session beer. Very refreshing but not something that wows you. I definately could put down alot of these fast.

2.95,-6.1,3,3,3,2.5,3,"I like Dortmunders, they have a unique taste. This baby comes in a 16oz bottle and is on sale at my store for 6.49....can't beat it! Pours a bubbly yellow color with a fine head. Smell musty with a little hop spiceyness. Taste is clean and crisp, true to the German purity law. A good beer to sit back and chill with but don't expect heaps of flavor.","Portertime","0"
2.81,-10.5,3,2,3,2.5,3.5,"Well just got another 2 cases for $25/ in NJ. They got rid of the 'canned' hops! though now using hop extract. Also now using a super aga that makes capping these bottles a breeze.","beer272","May 03, 2009"

3.16,0.6,4,3,3,2,4,"pours straw yellow with a monster head with nice lacing from a half liter bottle. don't smell like much but i can detect some hops in there somewhere... took a couple sniffs though. taste is pretty average to minimal. it seems like it's kind of flat or something. which is weird because the head and the lacing are impressive. but it doesn't seem carbonated enough. it is not bad. but nothing special. but it does have a unique taste to it. drinkability is good though. the best thing about this beer is the bottles...half liters. buy these and use the bottles for your homebrew! they're totally drinkable. i could have like 6....5 more to go! CHEERS!","righlander","Nov 01, 2006"
3.07,-2.2,2.5,3,3.5,3,2.5,"Served from a pint bottle into a mug, this beer is a nice straw-amber color with a finger head that dissipates after a minute - about what you would expect from any ""typical"" beer. The nose is very typical, and what you would expect from any European lager. The taste is about the same - nothing special, but very drinkable. There's nothing bad to say about this beer, and for the price (about a dollar for a pint) I think I may actually pick it up again. This is a big step above similarly priced beers...","BucBasil","Jun 01, 2006"
3,-4.5,3,3,3,3,3,"The pour is a light gold color with a white head that quickly disipates. The aroma is lightly fruity with light hops presence Flavors are complimentary with a nice light malt the hops come through late in the finish but, coupled with the crisp carbonation is just enough to make you want another sip. Mouthfeel and drinkability are both what would be expected form such a light beer. Overall, a good brew when you need a quick thirst quencher.","MrVisegrips","Feb 21, 2006"
3.45,9.9,3,3,3.5,3.5,4,"Poured a bright golden color with monstrous white puffy head. Smell is a bit fruity and sweet. Taste is refreshing, but very subdued, with little to cheer about. Finishes crisp, with a slight malt sweetness and no hops. An average beer. Too expensive for what you get.","tgbljb","Dec 10, 2005"
2.8,-10.8,3,3,2.5,3,3,"Clear golden color and mildly effervescent with a thin white head that lasts pretty well. Not much lacing evident. Aroma of bready malt and Lager-like hops. Light-bodied and very clean on the tongue. Mild malt and caramel flavors along with a bit of hops. The finish is mildly sweet malt and corn and does not linger. Below average, I would expect more from a Dortmunder from the city of Dortmund.","Dogbrick","Sep 18, 2004"

3.24,3.2,3,4,2.5,3,4,"High drinkability marks, because it goes down as easy as a regular lite beer. At around eight bucks for a sixer, though, you might as well go for a 12 pack of Whateverthefuck Lite.","diamonddave","Jul 20, 2004"
3.25,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,3,3.5,"This beer is golden in color with white head that quickly dissapears. There a light malt smell to it with a hint of hops. The flavor is mainly of the malt and mildly sweet. Nice carbonation. This light to medium bodied beer that is crisp and refreshing.","afinepilsner","Apr 23, 2004"
4.13,31.5,4.5,4,4,4,4.5,"This beer poured a clear and bright golden color, had a small but creamy white head and left an intricate lacing on the glass. A vibrant carbonation tickles the tongue. The aroma gives off sweet lemony grains and fresh malts. The taste is very light and very clean, almost lemony fresh. The body is light, but overall there is a firm body of malt holding this beer together. Lively and musty hops bring this beer together. Very nice.","pezoids","Apr 16, 2004"
2.85,-9.2,2.5,2.5,3,3,3,"Pours a clear gold with a thin white head... a bit too pale to be called a Dortmunder. Aroma is grainy... with a light touch of floral hops... had to strain to get much aroma though. Flavor isn't bad... some sweet grain and a touch of biterness. Basically this is a very boring beer... nothing special... no hoppiness... no complexity... Mouthfeel is light and crisp. Not offensive or flawed... but when I'm looking for a really good Dortmunder, I'll be looking somewhere other than Hansa.","zerk","Jan 11, 2004"
3.58,14,3.5,3,3.5,4.5,4,"This brew is a pale gold color, with a decent sized white foam head. The scent is of pale malts. As for the taste it is a delicate tasting brew, with sweet malts in the front and a delicate hop presence balancing it out. Cereal grains. Smooth creamy mouthfeel. I'll admit ive never had a dortmunder style brew before, so i cant really know what they are going for, but for me this is a fine beer.","Tballz420","Beers"
