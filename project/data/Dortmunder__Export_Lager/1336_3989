3.92,19.5,3.5,4,4,3.5,4," grain and bread like smells, which completely dominated the entire profile from the first moment you took a whiff of it. This was not a bad thing in fact it was kinda what I would be looking for in the style and it really came off with the aroma of a classic German lager. big-time bready and malt heavy lager this just did not mess around and came right at you. Nice light profile that was just full of bready grains and a bit of an earthy sort of twang to it that was hard to place, but was a little different. The finish was great; a nice big kick of hops to finish it off","mikesgroove","Jul 24, 2011"

Popping the top yields an earthy lager malt with grape accents and a very pilsner, noble hop aroma, very pilsner-like.The hint of grapes is also very pilsner-like. Pours to a golden lager colour with a bright white head made up of multi sized bubbles. Taste is sweet and skunky like a classic lager. Mouthfeel is good, carbonation is sufficient but not overdone. Reviewing this for what it is, a lager, it is quite good. Great noble hop undertone, light bitterness and a good flavor.","mooseisloose","Sep 26, 2010"

The aroma is not very strong; I pick up some bready doughy malt and a light hop spice. The taste is of a thick honey malt with some grain and stale hop flavors. Has an interesting thick yet lightly toasted malt flavor. The feel is moderate and well carbonated finishes with a honey sweetness. Good balance, drinks very easy. A good brew, flavors don't standout but there aren't any real negative flavors. Good brew to kick back and session.","Gmann","Jun 22, 2008"
3.26,-0.6,4,3,3.5,3,3,"Pours a clean golden/ yellow color with a white head. In the aroma, a small malty sweetness. In the taste, a small hop presence and also a sweet maltiness. A small bitter and medium mouthfeel, with a small dry maltiness in the aftertaste. Nice sessionish lager, quite balanced and fresh.","OWSLEY069","Mar 06, 2008"

3.95,20.4,3.5,3.5,4,4,4.5,"Used my new Sam Adams glass for this beer (cool!). The beer pours a pale yellow with white head that dissipates except for a white cap that laces down the glass. Light grainy aroma, flavor was malt accented with some decent hop bitterness in the back. Refreshing and especially suited for summer quaffing. Full body with a nice substantial mouthfeel. A great introduction for macro drinkers into craft beer.","John1985","Jun 05, 2007"
3.78,15.2,4,3.5,3.5,4,4.5,"It IS refreshing...with a light mouthfeel, and light flavor. In fact, not alot of flavor to speak of, but enough. I wouldn't want something heavy on a hot day like this! Has a nice finish, and even a tiny bit of hop bite at the end, that doesn't last. I like that. Pretty much par for ABC stuff, as it's light and non-offensive. Highly drinkable, I'd say...but sadly, I only have 5 left! Guess I'll have to have a PBR in between! HAHA! I recommend it for anyone who drinks our American macros...IE: Bud, Miller, Coors, etc... It's comparable but better than all of those. Nice lager, especially for the hot summer days. Go for it! You won't regret it. Hell, I haven't met a beer I didn't drink yet!! Cheers, my friends.","musicjustintime","Mar 22, 2007"

3.55,8.2,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,4,"Great, fresh (for us lucky enough to be near the brewery) craft beer. Nice rendition of the style. Light, clear amber with minimal head. Smell was malt with Dortmunder-style hops bitterness in the nose--and in the taste. Slightly biscuity with (adjunct?) smoothness and a slight astringent flavor. Would be a very refreshing summer beer--perhaps with crabs!","tugdriver7","0"
3.88,18.3,4,3.5,3.5,4,5,"Pours a crystal clear straw yellow with a thin head of white bubbles. Slight sweetness in the aroma along with a tad of hops in the background. Crisp, clean flavor of grain. Mild sweetness balanced by the bitterness of the hops. Lingering bitterness in the aftertaste, somewhat dry. Great example of the style. Very easy to drink with just enough character to not be boring, but at the same time be accessible to the masses. Wow it seems like I drank this one in secondsÂ… Could be dangerous on a hot summer day!","sacfly","Dec 12, 2006"

3.53,7.6,3.5,3,3.5,4,4,"I don't know what's Dortmund or Export about this beer, tasted like a plain old american all-malt to me. Not that that's necessarily bad, but this doesn't taste any different to me. Reminds me of the older Saranac all-malt lager. A slight grainy and biscuity quality with sweet grains. Nothing to write home about, but pleasant and washes doesn food just fine.","tempest","Aug 07, 2006"
2.43,-25.9,3,2.5,2.5,2.5,2,"On tap at BP in Gettysburg. Pours with a clear light golden color with a paper thin head. No lacing noticed in the pint glass. Aroma was extremely grainy and sugary sweet with some fresh cut grass and hay overtones. Mouthfeel was a tad too slick and oily (undercarbonated?) for a lager. Not enough fizz here. Taste of slightly sour grain, light malts, fresh baked white bread, lemon and grass. Overall quite a sweet flavor profile. Finish is a bit tame and quick with a barely perceptible hop presence and a slight crispness. My brother-in-law was with us and heÂ’s a committed Bud drinker and this is what he was ordering. There ya go!","macster","Aug 02, 2006"

3.63,10.7,3.5,3,4,3,4,"Poured a clear golden that seemed to show more signs of yellow as it got warmer. Smelled light..slight hoppiness and spice.

2.83,-13.7,3.5,3,2.5,3,3,"12oz. bottle. Poured a crystal clear gold color with a modest, off white head. Scent was pretty low key, yeast-malt-some fruit and a light floral hopping.

3.97,21,3.5,4,4,4,4,"Darker than I was expecting, but still inviting. Not much carbonation though. A nice, suprisingly fulled bodied lager, crisp and refeshing, almost a little creamy. Pretty decent brew, and a fine lawnmower beer. I got it at the Brew Zoo during a visit to Altoona, as part of a four pack. Sort of an overshadowed brewery, perhaps, but most seem to be good ground level brews.","hustlemuscle","Nov 06, 2005"

A hint of hop flavor and a hint of bitterness but not as much malt as I expected to taste. I could definately sit back and enjoy a 6-pack of this on a warm summer afternoon. It had the ""refreshing"" sort of characteristic to it but overall the beer was not something that blew me away.","chakadrum","Oct 17, 2005"

3.73,13.7,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4.5,"This arrived with a nice white head, but it quickly evaporated to wispiness, although it continued to bubble with CO2. It was deep golden yellow in color with a lightly sweet nose. It had a light mouthfeel with a light combination of hops and malt in the mouth. The finish was more malty, but it was still light in its flavor profile. Having said all of that, I still feel that it was a great interpretation of the style and the low ABV makes it a great session beer candidate.","woodychandler","May 10, 2005"
3.58,9.1,4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"Light gold in color with a medium-sized, respectable white head. Moderate, leaning-to light in carbonation. This is a nice-looking brew. Sweet, restrained grain and malt aroma, with just a thin bit of hop presence. The taste is nicely balancedÂ…sweet and caramel with biscuit, offset by a moderate bitterness that begins in the mid-taste. Finishes soft and lingering, with the balance very notable. If anything, this brew might slide a little toward the Â“too sweetÂ” side, but itÂ’s still nicely balanced. Medium mouthfeel, and soft. I could see myself having a few of these brews.","Suds","Feb 25, 2005"

3.75,14.3,4,4,3.5,3.5,4,"A clear golden body teems with vibrant carbonation beneath a full head of bright white foam. The retention is fair, and maintains a wide collar and leaves some minor lacing about the glass. The nose expresses a combination of lightly grainy malt and citrusy (lemon rind) and lightly floral/grassy hops. It's not bold, but it's fresh, clean, and welcoming. The body is medium-light; and it's fine and slightly zesty carbonation is more airy on the palate than crisp. The flavor is more grainy than the nose leads you to believe, and the hops are unfortunately subdued. A delicate bitterness balances it's cereal-like maltiness well, but somehow leaves it lackluster. It finishes fairly short and dry although some grain tends to build on the palate as it warms.","NeroFiddled","Mar 13, 2003"
3.58,9.1,4,3.5,3.5,3,4,"Served as part of a sampler tray at their brewery. This is a highly quaffable beer. More of a malt and grainy body than any macros I can think of. This beer is golden and very clear with a thin head. Slight whiff of grains and bits of citrus hops in the aroma, same hops leave a pleasant bitterness behind as the beer finishes clean and crisp. Refreshing and slightly bitter yet smooth.","pezoids","Dec 30, 2002"
4.1,25,4,4,4,4,4.5,"I was impressed with virtually all aspects of this brew. It poured a clear, straw color. Nice head, tight bands of carbonation and good lacing. There was a subtle but tempting malty scent, and strong hop aroma...even a floral mix of aromas was perceived, almost making it smells more like an ale. The taste started out with a sweet maltiness, followed by a smooth transition to a mellow bitterness after the swallow. Very crisp and refreshing. The medium body had a slightly sticky mouthfeel, very nice. The Mountain Lager was an enjoybale, very drinkable beer...can't wait to have more of it on tap.","SchmichaelJ","Nov 12, 2002"
4.48,36.6,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,5,"This is a great everyday, not-so-heavy or alcoholic brew, making it a great session beer. I drink it on a regular basis and it never lets me down. Good, solid Summer beer when I just want to have something light and great tasting.","thefireman","Aug 01, 2002"
3.85,17.4,4,4,4,3.5,3.5,"When brought to the table you notice that the head is dense/thick.  It is gold/cooper in color.  A malt (slight sweet) aroma with some hops.
