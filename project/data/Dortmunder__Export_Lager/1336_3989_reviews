"Pours a clear yellow color. Flavor is slightly fruity with a bit of toasted grain. Corn and pair aromas. Bottle brought back from Nasville. A little more exciting body and flavors than your typical pale lager. Not an incredibly amount of complexity or individuality in this beer however."

"Fairly meh, but not off-putting.  Pairs well with food.  Easy to ignore, not something you'd drink for the sake of the beer itself, but sessionable on a hot day."

"Overall – This is certainly not a beer I would recommend. Very cloying and rather unbalanced in flavors and feel. Most adjusts are far superior to this with a much lower cost and actually a better taste. I will likely not come back to this brew."

"D - Goes down easily enough... Rather quaffable... Nothing off-putting, not even in the slightest... However, there is nothing memorable or even slightly remarkable about this offering... It is a simple, straight-forward pedestrian Lager... There's nothing wrong with that in and off itself, but it's not necessarily what all BAs are hoping... There is a time and place for a beer like this, but it's not something I would stock regularly nor recommend..."

"Poured light gold with a short lived white head. Very clean aroma. The light malts are readily apparent with notes of bread and toasted grain. Sparse hops of a grassy and citrus nature adorn the aroma and the mid-late quaff. Finish is clean and unlasting, but leaves you wanting a little more. Light bodied and refreshing carbonation."

"Poured a clear golden brown with a small white head that receded to a ringlet. Light aroma of sweet malts, toasted grains, grass. Taste is friendly and malty, with a dab of honey, toasted grains, and a touch of grassy hops for a sense of balance. Actually not too bad for a simple lager. Smooth, light-medium body, goes down easy, even if it lacks in flavor overall. Decent."

"Lagers are no longer my favorite style but they have their place. If you are in the mood for one, this is an enjoyable one. Not all that different form your standard BMC but, still a better representation of the style."
"Overall: This beer is labeled as a Dortmunder-Export Style. In having several Dort's, I have found this brew to be the least fitting into the Dortmunder style. This beer if served to me in place of a domestic light beer without my knowledge could probably dupe me.. The beer does slightly have more flavor in the way of hops in comparison to U.S. light beer and would fit more into,and be highly ranked in that style."

"This beer is a decent lager. I am not sure if I have ever had a ""dortmunder"" before but this is alright. Could use a boost in the flavor department, but the flavor that is there isn't bad. This is a decent light alcohol, easy drinking lager."

"When i poured this beer, it has a nice golden color body, with a 2"" white fizzy head. The smell is of hops and barley. The taste is clean and the hops comes through very nice. The balance of hops and barley is very nice. The mouth feel is crisp and goes down nice. Overall this is a good beer and is drinkable."
"O: This was a very good, will brewed lager, i look forward to having this beer again on my next visit"
"Pours a pale gold, small cap of rocky white head, decent retention. Scent is light and contains some clean and fresh malt notes backed by faintly grassy and earthy hop notes. Taste is quite light and clean with some minimal maltyness and faintly stale hop bite. Light bodied, bubbly. A little step above a macro, comparable to a decent import."
" grain and bread like smells, which completely dominated the entire profile from the first moment you took a whiff of it. This was not a bad thing in fact it was kinda what I would be looking for in the style and it really came off with the aroma of a classic German lager. big-time bready and malt heavy lager this just did not mess around and came right at you. Nice light profile that was just full of bready grains and a bit of an earthy sort of twang to it that was hard to place, but was a little different. The finish was great; a nice big kick of hops to finish it off"
"A little bready with some up front hop bitterness followed by a malty ride into a clean, if a little sweet, finish. A little floral hop aroma. Overall, a pretty solid lager from these guys. Pairs well with clams and scallops."
"Pours a clear light yellow color. Aroma of spent grains and floral hops. In the taste, mild cracker like yeast, white bread, even balance and a clean crisp finish. Refreshing, light, good for the summer heat waves. Nothing remarkable, but absurdly easy to drink."
"O: Overall, I think this is a pretty good version of the style. Clean, biscuity, and tasty."
"Overall a good clean beer."
"Drinkability: This is a beer very lacking in flavor or character. It has that nice lager crispness but almost nothing in the way of real flavor. It's not overtly offensive but something really needs to be done to up the flavor here. In the meantime, don't bother. Take your money somewhere else; there are better lagers out there."
"D; One is enough"
"D: a nice dort but there is such a wonderful selection here I wouldn't see my self passing up a new offering just to get this. And with almost brewpub only exclusivity it cuts down on the drinkability."
"D- Highly drinkable and delicious. It doesn't have the unpleasant aftertaste that most macro lagers have. It goes down smooth and has a crisp aftertaste that keeps you begging for more."
"D: An average lager, in the straight-up all-malt American lager category similar to Yengling Lager.,"
"I generally go for heavier beers, but this is a nice, drinkable, lager. Not outstanding in any way, but a nice drinkable lager."
"This was a recent BOTMC arrival, let's give it a whirl. Popping the top yields an earthy lager malt with grape accents and a very pilsner, noble hop aroma, very pilsner-like.The hint of grapes is also very pilsner-like. Pours to a golden lager colour with a bright white head made up of multi sized bubbles. Taste is sweet and skunky like a classic lager. Mouthfeel is good, carbonation is sufficient but not overdone. Reviewing this for what it is, a lager, it is quite good. Great noble hop undertone, light bitterness and a good flavor."
"I was bracing myself for a pretty weak, middling lager, but was pleasantly surprised with some nice twists along the way. Can't say it's a real stand-out in my mind, but there were definitely some things about it that impressed me. An easy drinker, tasty, I could easily spend an evening with this one."
"Very light tasting golden yellow color with a thin white head. Half way decent taste and mouthfeel but overall pretty thin tasting. Has some straw notes with a mild light malt taste. Ceratinly a bit of a spicy hop note. Reminded me more of a pilsner with the slight hop aroma and finish. I guess I was looking for more of a richer malt flavor but still it was a very refreshing lager. Seasonable summer time lager. Easy to drink and you could certainly consider this for a session brew. Overall a decent selection."
"D: A reasonable lager, although I would not put it in the Dortmunder category personally -- it fits more in the straight-up all-malt lager category for me."
"D: A very nice, very sessionable lager. It's nice to find a clean, light tasting lager that has some flavor. Well done."
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a rich golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of malts, slightly sweet. Taste is crisp, some malts, a touch of sweetness, finishing a tad bitter. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and is very drinkable. Overall this is a very good beer on a hot day."
"A Dortmunder? Hmmm - wouldn't have pegged it as such. More of a mainstream lager, perhaphs leaning a bit more than average to the malt side. A touch of caramel to the malt, moderate hopping and the finish a little sweet. Overall, it was well put-together and the flavors all complimentary."
"Overall: I thought this beer was kind of weird. Honestly, I know very little about this style. It's maltiness might be too much for some people. It's respectable."
"d- this was a drinkable lager that i enjoyed and would drink again."
"Drinkability: I could have three or four. Very good for the style. I like the mix of sweet and hoppiness. This tastes like a maltier pilsner."
"Pours a cloudy golden color. 1/3 inch head of a white color. Good retention and good lacing. Smells of yeast, pale malt, very slight hop, and sweet malt, and slighty earthiness. Fits the style of a Dortmunder/Export Lager. Mouth feel is smooth and crisp with an average carbonation level. Tastes of pale malt, yeast, slight sweet malt, hint of hops, earthiness, and grain. Overall, a well blended, nice bodied beer that is much smoother and drinkable as it warms."
"I'll certainly be coming back to this although it's not my normal style. A fine effort by Appalachian."
"A solid feel, light bodied but substantial. Smooth, crisp, clean. I sound like a beer commercial. I like this beer in all it's simplicity. Easy drinker, good all around lager."
"D Well, good since it is so close to water but really, there is not enough here for me to buy this again. 4.0"
"Pours a very slightly hazed golden orange with a nice enough white head. Nose is sweet like apple juice. Flavor is grainy and slightly doughy sweet. Thicker kind of liquid feel. Almost seems congested a bit, if that makes sense. Nice enough I guess, but a bit out of balance and not the proper formula I would say."
"Appalachian Mountain Lager is a clear golden beer with a thin white head that fade and leaves some OK lacing. It carries smells of light grain and lemon. It's very light bodied; a little watery, but smooth. The flavor is mellow, with a soft wooden bitterness. It tastes fresh and it's very drinkable. My brother picked this up at the brewery (I think) and brought it here."
"Poured a nice yellow color with a bit of head and lacing. Nice clean scent, very neutral with just a slight sweetness. Nice taste, clean and refreshing, mostly a nice light malt flavor. Goes down smooth, a bit of a dry beer. Not bad, a refreshing lawn mower brew."
"Gold colored beer with a rapidly fading head.Aroma is malty.Taste is malt,wheat and some undefined frutiness.This is very bland and boring.This is about as mediocre as you can get.This is nothing I would recommend and something I would never pay for again!!"
"Overall, this beer is crisp and refreshing, but I just can not get over the fruity taste it has which was not advertised on the bottle."
"Don't drink and review."
"Notes from 10/23/04"
"D: Relatively clean with Some bitterness, but sweetness lingers"
"D: A decent lager, but nothing too impressive. I can see myself drinking this on a hot summer day to cool off, but I cannot say I would go out of my way for it."
"Pored a clear yellowish color. Aroma is quite faint. Slight hop odor. Other than that, nothing I could really pick up. Very nice light refreshing lager. Sweet malty taste with a hint of light hoppy bitterness finish made this good. Drinkability is very high with this one. It's just nice."
"Pours a toasted grain color with an average tight white head that dissipated into a slight cap. The aroma is not very strong; I pick up some bready doughy malt and a light hop spice. The taste is of a thick honey malt with some grain and stale hop flavors. Has an interesting thick yet lightly toasted malt flavor. The feel is moderate and well carbonated finishes with a honey sweetness. Good balance, drinks very easy. A good brew, flavors don't standout but there aren't any real negative flavors. Good brew to kick back and session."
"Pours a clean golden/ yellow color with a white head. In the aroma, a small malty sweetness. In the taste, a small hop presence and also a sweet maltiness. A small bitter and medium mouthfeel, with a small dry maltiness in the aftertaste. Nice sessionish lager, quite balanced and fresh."
"Drinkability is ok. It's really easy to drink, but it's a bit bland and uninteresting."
"D-easily couldput down a six pack of this because of the smoothness. It isnt rough to drink and it reminds me of a coors light with class."
"D: Not an easy drinker, I was disappointed in the taste after hearing how good it was supposed to be."
"D--I have had good versions and bad versions of this. This particular version was not very good. Had it better in the bottle than on tap."
"D - One of ABC's easiest to quaff. Pretty straightforward and according to style. Could be a litter cleaner in the finish, but overall it's still a very drinkable brew."
"Used my new Sam Adams glass for this beer (cool!). The beer pours a pale yellow with white head that dissipates except for a white cap that laces down the glass. Light grainy aroma, flavor was malt accented with some decent hop bitterness in the back. Refreshing and especially suited for summer quaffing. Full body with a nice substantial mouthfeel. A great introduction for macro drinkers into craft beer."
"It IS refreshing...with a light mouthfeel, and light flavor. In fact, not alot of flavor to speak of, but enough. I wouldn't want something heavy on a hot day like this! Has a nice finish, and even a tiny bit of hop bite at the end, that doesn't last. I like that. Pretty much par for ABC stuff, as it's light and non-offensive. Highly drinkable, I'd say...but sadly, I only have 5 left! Guess I'll have to have a PBR in between! HAHA! I recommend it for anyone who drinks our American macros...IE: Bud, Miller, Coors, etc... It's comparable but better than all of those. Nice lager, especially for the hot summer days. Go for it! You won't regret it. Hell, I haven't met a beer I didn't drink yet!! Cheers, my friends."
"drinkability - A beer that one could sit and drink one after the other, if I wasn't alone, out of state and had to drive in the rain."
"Great, fresh (for us lucky enough to be near the brewery) craft beer. Nice rendition of the style. Light, clear amber with minimal head. Smell was malt with Dortmunder-style hops bitterness in the nose--and in the taste. Slightly biscuity with (adjunct?) smoothness and a slight astringent flavor. Would be a very refreshing summer beer--perhaps with crabs!"
"Pours a crystal clear straw yellow with a thin head of white bubbles. Slight sweetness in the aroma along with a tad of hops in the background. Crisp, clean flavor of grain. Mild sweetness balanced by the bitterness of the hops. Lingering bitterness in the aftertaste, somewhat dry. Great example of the style. Very easy to drink with just enough character to not be boring, but at the same time be accessible to the masses. Wow it seems like I drank this one in seconds Could be dangerous on a hot summer day!"
"Drinkability: Overall an impressive lager. I'd especially love to pair it with pizza."
"I don't know what's Dortmund or Export about this beer, tasted like a plain old american all-malt to me. Not that that's necessarily bad, but this doesn't taste any different to me. Reminds me of the older Saranac all-malt lager. A slight grainy and biscuity quality with sweet grains. Nothing to write home about, but pleasant and washes doesn food just fine."
"On tap at BP in Gettysburg. Pours with a clear light golden color with a paper thin head. No lacing noticed in the pint glass. Aroma was extremely grainy and sugary sweet with some fresh cut grass and hay overtones. Mouthfeel was a tad too slick and oily (undercarbonated?) for a lager. Not enough fizz here. Taste of slightly sour grain, light malts, fresh baked white bread, lemon and grass. Overall quite a sweet flavor profile. Finish is a bit tame and quick with a barely perceptible hop presence and a slight crispness. My brother-in-law was with us and hes a committed Bud drinker and this is what he was ordering. There ya go!"
"D- an easy drinker, very refreshing on a hot summer day, I would have this again"
"Poured a clear golden that seemed to show more signs of yellow as it got warmer. Smelled light..slight hoppiness and spice. Lightness carried over in the taste, but it is very well-balanced between the malt and grassy/floral hints. Very drinkable brew...goes down crisp and clean."
"12oz. bottle. Poured a crystal clear gold color with a modest, off white head. Scent was pretty low key, yeast-malt-some fruit and a light floral hopping. Taste was uninspiring, mildly sweet and mildly hopped. Light body with medium to high carbonation. An OK beer, but rather bland."
"Cheers!"
"Drinkability: Several of ABC's core lagers and ales could be considered high quality sessions. This is another to add to that list (along with the rye, the purist and the water gap wheat). Great job, Artie T and crew."
"Drinkability: even though the flavors are not overwhelming, I found this to have a decent drinkability from a refreshing standpoint. Not a beer to search for, but maybe worth a look if confronted with a limited beer selection."
"Brewpubs that bottle & sell their own beer are kickass, and I totally want to be supportive, but this beer is just not very good. I cant say I'm disappointed, since I didnt expect much in the first place, but there is certainly room for improvement."
"Darker than I was expecting, but still inviting. Not much carbonation though. A nice, suprisingly fulled bodied lager, crisp and refeshing, almost a little creamy. Pretty decent brew, and a fine lawnmower beer. I got it at the Brew Zoo during a visit to Altoona, as part of a four pack. Sort of an overshadowed brewery, perhaps, but most seem to be good ground level brews."
"Poured a nice golden color with a head that faded rather quickly. The smell was slightly malty and just a hint of hops. Taste was very crisp and clean. No strange flavors. A hint of hop flavor and a hint of bitterness but not as much malt as I expected to taste. I could definately sit back and enjoy a 6-pack of this on a warm summer afternoon. It had the ""refreshing"" sort of characteristic to it but overall the beer was not something that blew me away."
"Oddly it seemed the first bottle was much better than all those that came after, though I don't know how to explain that."
"Very, very clear and a nice golden color. Low aroma-not much there really. Good malty flavor with just a hint of hop bitterness to it. It gives it just a snap of flavor. Very clean in the finish. Nice body for the style. Goes down easy and quite smooth. Great beer for the non micro drinker or someone who is scared of having a beer in a brew pub. Would be great on a hot day."
"An above average lager that is crisp and refreshing. A good American representation of the Dortmunder style."
"presented a medium golden color with white puffy head. Smell is a bit malty with a slight background sweetness. Taste is slightly of citrus with a tangy background. Aftertaste is crisp and a bit bitter and very enjoyable. I'm normally not much of a lager fan, but this a better than most."
"This arrived with a nice white head, but it quickly evaporated to wispiness, although it continued to bubble with CO2. It was deep golden yellow in color with a lightly sweet nose. It had a light mouthfeel with a light combination of hops and malt in the mouth. The finish was more malty, but it was still light in its flavor profile. Having said all of that, I still feel that it was a great interpretation of the style and the low ABV makes it a great session beer candidate."
"Light gold in color with a medium-sized, respectable white head. Moderate, leaning-to light in carbonation. This is a nice-looking brew. Sweet, restrained grain and malt aroma, with just a thin bit of hop presence. The taste is nicely balancedsweet and caramel with biscuit, offset by a moderate bitterness that begins in the mid-taste. Finishes soft and lingering, with the balance very notable. If anything, this brew might slide a little toward the too sweet side, but its still nicely balanced. Medium mouthfeel, and soft. I could see myself having a few of these brews."
"Drinkability: Of course something as smooth as this gets a high drinkability"
"Overall-dissapointing, it doesn't taste very good (almost tastes thrown together) and ruins what looked to be a promising beer, hope Appalacian gets their act together on this one sometime."
"Has a mouthfeel between light and medium. I think I would have scored this beer higher, if I were enjoying it on the boat in the middle of a hot summer day. After living the last few weeks on bold winter warmers and imperial everythings, it just seems a bit muted."
"Definitely the best starting lager that I've ever had at a brewpub. When I normally try their starting beer, I'm nonplussed or downright disappointed, but this is an exception. Very nice and flavorful Dortmunder, and one I'd love to have again."
"A nice lager but wish the carb was toned down just a little and the flavor cranked up a tad."
"Drinkability: Awesome. This beer is the perfect session beer. Absolutely. It's not interesting, it's not a masterpiece, it's just an absolutely solid and easy drinking lager. Very nice."
"I'd say that this is one of the better lagers out there. I managed to get my one friend who hates beer to drink this and now shes a big fan of lagers due to this beer. This beer has a nice clear pale color to it with a nice mild aroma. It has a mild malt taste with a good amount of hops to make it and over all good lager."
"A clear golden body teems with vibrant carbonation beneath a full head of bright white foam. The retention is fair, and maintains a wide collar and leaves some minor lacing about the glass. The nose expresses a combination of lightly grainy malt and citrusy (lemon rind) and lightly floral/grassy hops. It's not bold, but it's fresh, clean, and welcoming. The body is medium-light; and it's fine and slightly zesty carbonation is more airy on the palate than crisp. The flavor is more grainy than the nose leads you to believe, and the hops are unfortunately subdued. A delicate bitterness balances it's cereal-like maltiness well, but somehow leaves it lackluster. It finishes fairly short and dry although some grain tends to build on the palate as it warms."
"Served as part of a sampler tray at their brewery. This is a highly quaffable beer. More of a malt and grainy body than any macros I can think of. This beer is golden and very clear with a thin head. Slight whiff of grains and bits of citrus hops in the aroma, same hops leave a pleasant bitterness behind as the beer finishes clean and crisp. Refreshing and slightly bitter yet smooth."
"I was impressed with virtually all aspects of this brew. It poured a clear, straw color. Nice head, tight bands of carbonation and good lacing. There was a subtle but tempting malty scent, and strong hop aroma...even a floral mix of aromas was perceived, almost making it smells more like an ale. The taste started out with a sweet maltiness, followed by a smooth transition to a mellow bitterness after the swallow. Very crisp and refreshing. The medium body had a slightly sticky mouthfeel, very nice. The Mountain Lager was an enjoybale, very drinkable beer...can't wait to have more of it on tap."
"This is a great everyday, not-so-heavy or alcoholic brew, making it a great session beer. I drink it on a regular basis and it never lets me down. Good, solid Summer beer when I just want to have something light and great tasting."
"When brought to the table you notice that the head is dense/thick.  It is gold/cooper in color.  A malt (slight sweet) aroma with some hops. The flavor reflects the aroma but has a slight fruit - hop appeal.  Finishes off pretty well with malt.  Not what I expected, slightly different then others in its class."
"Medium amber in color with golden notes.  Hoppy nose with slight hint of roasted malt.  Thick bubbly head. Very smooth and easy drinking with nice blend of hops and malt. Slightly less body than others in its category.  Smooth and easy drinkable with a satisfying finish."
