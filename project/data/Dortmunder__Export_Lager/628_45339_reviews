"O: Decent beer for the price, Nothing fancy. I like the label which says "" Brewed with love and alcohol"". Seems to be appropriate for the Reeperbahn."
"O: probably a lot fresher from a plane ride to the states rather than dealing with importers and distributors."
"Astra Rotlicht is a half-decent beer, just a tad boring in the end. I'd rather drink this than the standard Astra pils."
"D: Decent beer. Different and drinkable."
"D - If I wanted to, I could have another. But I don't."
"Quite average beer whcih can be found all along Reeperbahn."
