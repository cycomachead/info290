Smell is of malt, honey, and grassy aromas. Taste is much the same with malt, honey, and spice flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that displays a surprising honey presence in the aroma and flavor.","UCLABrewN84","Feb 12, 2013"

4.35,20.2,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Poured into a glass mug. Pours golden with lots of tiny bubbles and a white head that dissipates rather quickly. The beer smells of roasted malts with some grassy aroma from the hops. It's bready on the nose with just some mild sweetness. The taste of this beer is everything you look for in a pale German lager. There's the grassiness and mild citrus from the noble hops, but this is mild. There's the bready quality from the Munich malt. The body is light with lively carbonation. The finish is crisp and smooth. The drinkability is very high. This is an excellent beer.","acevenom","Mar 30, 2012"

3.06,-15.5,3.5,2.5,3,3.5,3.5,"Light gold color with a wet, filmy white head. Leaves some spotted lacing. Boring grains and pale malt on the nose, with a slight bready sweetness. Flavor is similar with grains and biscuity malt. There's a balancing earthy hoppiness that's a little grassy and a little metallic. Very low bitterness. Thin and a little watery, but this is a clear step up over your average crappy pale lager. Easy to drink, just very typical.","illidurit","Dec 03, 2008"

It's smooth and lightly on the oily side, with an engaging zestiness, making it light but tasty, subtly complex, and very satisfying. It has a light bitterness to balance the sweetness and give a light bite in finish. The flavours last well, never degrading and it is a smooth, full-bodied, solid German lager.","Offa","Aug 10, 2008"

Strong malt presence in the nose. Taste is good. Malty with a lemon zest and a strong "grassy" taste to it. Mouthfeel is light and crisp. Overall a good beer. It wasnt amazing but a strong lemon-like presence made it easily drinkable. Best served nice and cold.","bunnyhustle","Feb 07, 2008"

4.08,12.7,4,3.5,4.5,4,4,"This is very crisp, clean, refreshing pale lager. That's really about all I ask for in a Munich pale lager. It's beers like this that make Germans feel like kings of the beer world. I always approach German imports with some caution, seeing as how they can lose their lustre fairly easily sitting on a store shelf. In this instance, I got lucky. My bottle had clearly not been sitting overly long. The hop character was clean and non-skunky. The aroma was mostly malty-bready with just a hint of spicy hop. It had a full malty flavor and a brisk hoppy bite to dry out the finish. I recommend trying this beer to any lager-lieber. With luck, your pivo purveyor has followed the directive on the label: "kühl und dunkel lagern."","ctdfalconer","Mar 01, 2007"
3.53,-2.5,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Reuterberger Export Hell is yet another pale lager that I'd love to drink at the source. I get the feeling that it's better than the beer that found its way into my glass today. Even so, I like the fact that it's hoppier than most. This one is worth a shot if you can verify a reasonable amount of freshness.","BuckeyeNation","Aug 04, 2006"
4.12,13.8,4,4.5,4,4,4,"Took a chance at the beer store, and what do you know ,this ain't bad. Dusty goldenrod in the glass, my 1/2 inch white head has died down to 1/4 inch, but still clings to the glass. Aroma is slightly yeasty and bready. Taste is also slightly bready with a faint note of metallic in the finish. Aftertaste is a bit sweet. Mouthfeel is medium. Pretty drinkable, as in: it's been quite a day at work, and I could drink more than one. $3.45 at Downtown Wine and Spirits if you really need to know.","PatandDavid","Jul 28, 2006"
3.27,-9.7,3.5,4,3,3,3,"Drinkability  This is an easy drinker, but the strong sweetness and off mouthfeel mean I probably wont buy again.","RoyalT","May 03, 2006"
3.8,5,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Reutberger Export Hell pours a clear golden color with a thick white head from a brown one pint and nine tenths ounce bottle. The aroma is grainy, perhaps even a hint of citrus and a little bit of hop is noticeable. Good malty flavor with a little bit of hops toward the finish. Grain is also noticeable in the taste. Overall, a pretty drinkable beer. If you're looking for something light, I'd recommend this.","Drew966","Apr 26, 2006"
3.68,1.7,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"500cl bottle. Pours a clean golden straw color and makes a fluffy white head, has great head retention. Pleasant aroma of sweet malt and grains, hint of corn. Flavor is clean, lightly sweet and malty, hint of spice from the noble hops. Crisp, medium carbonation, and a soft medium body on the palate. This is a pretty nice Helles, easy to drink and enjoyable.","kmcnair","Apr 01, 2006"

3.03,-16.3,3.5,3,3,3,3,".5 liter bottle. This beer has a clear yellow color with a huge rocky white head. Grainy aroma, too much like corn. The flavor is quite husky, which partially covers up the German hops. The finish is bitter. Mouthfeel is light to medium. Drinkability is diminished by the corn aroma and husky flavors, which are quite distracting. Most of the smaller breweries in Germany make great beers. Therefore, while this beer isn't terrible, it is a bit of a disappointment.","beveragecaptain","Beers"
4.08,12.7,4,3.5,4.5,4,4,"Nice overall helles. Pours a pale straw color with a beautiful soft and creamy white head that laces very well. The aroma is a subdued sweet maltiness with no real expressive hop presence noted, in other words just like a helles should be. The flavor is a sweet maltiness with grain overtones and dry finish with faint hop bite. A nice quenching helles that i will seek out again.","brakspear","0"
3.88,7.2,4,3.5,4,4,4,"smell was lacking much substance (some wheat), faint but surprisingly the taste packed a bit more punch. Great lacing as each drink produced more head and left evidence of my gobblage. Sweet aftertaste and partially cleansing finish but not dry. I really enjoyed this beer for what it is. Refreshing, Light but enough taste to let you know there was some imagination and effort put into this pup. caramel comes into play in the middle and it is slightly syrupy for a light colored beer....Would love to get this in a sixer. I can only find it as a individual 25oz. Oh well I'll continue to buy this beer for casual after work sessioning.","DogFood11","Jan 03, 2005"
3.6,-0.6,4,4,3,4,4,"Pours a radiant golden hue with some cloudy sediment and a small brilliant white head. Aroma of banana is evident as soon as the cap is popped, but then takes a back seat to the clean smell of German lager yeast and mild fruity hops. Palate is understated, a balance of mild hops and light sweet malt, and more nice, clean lager yeast. Very nice, creamy body. A nice, drinkable beer, but a bit light on flavor.","ElGordo","Dec 29, 2004"
3.73,3,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4.5,"Pours a clear light gold with a nice two finger head that settles nicely leaving a small amount of lace.Sweeter malty aroma with some mineral along with a light toastiness but pretty clean,taste is very German some toasted malt and honey with a big mineral flavor that comes thru late and lingers.A nice helles clean and soft a real quaffer woulld be real good on a hot summer day for sure.","oberon","Dec 02, 2004"
2.78,-23.2,4,3.5,2,4,2.5,"Smooth in the mouth with nice, crisp carbonation. Medium-full body. Nice feel, but flavor is not there. Brutal.","Skidz","Jul 26, 2004"
3.08,-14.9,4,3.5,2.5,4,3,"Begins with that notion of of lightly toasty sesame seeds, then moves into a grainier breadiness. Traces of honeyed sweetness, at time suggesting corn though that is certainly not present. A harsh minerality precedes a vegetal bitterness, which eventually gives way to lemon-rind and herbal hops. It gets better as it sits awhile, but remains pretty disorganized. Somewhat akin to a lager from another European country, but as a German entry, it lacks the typical helles finesse. It has all the traits of a decent one except one. Taste.","cokes","May 04, 2004"
3.15,-13,3.5,3.5,3,3,3,"Pours a clean golden and sports a nice fluffy white head and a good solid stick throughout. Aromas are sweet and malt driven. In the mouth the beer is rich and again sweet and malt focused to the point of being a tad cloying and flabby. The flavors are extracted and concentrated sweet malt with a mild kiss of hop. This is a nice beer to start the night, but not one I'd easily drink a second unless I had a mustard crusted pork chop and some noodles thrown my way.","moulefrite","Mar 12, 2004"
