2.65,-25.4,3,3,2.5,2.5,2.5,"Just not a very good beer here. But, you never know what you're going to get with something labeled ""Landbier," as it's not really a strict style. Give me the Mönchshof Kellerbier over this any day.","dasenebler","Jun 29, 2008"
3.83,7.9,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Smell is OK, a bit of citron from the hops. Good and very drinkable for a landbier. I will enjoy every drop of this half liter.","Brabander","May 11, 2008"
3.77,6.2,3,3.5,4,3.5,4,"D: Easy to drink due to its lightness, but not really something I would want to drink a lot of. The weird, pilsner-on-steroids taste is offputting, as I expected more from something claiming to be a landbier.","jenitivecase","May 21, 2007"

3.58,0.8,4,3.5,3.5,3,4,"Poured a huge, fluffy, bright-white head that faded slowly leaving scattered patches of lace. Transparent, glowing, golden beer holds a few streams of bubbles. Herbal and floral hops in the aroma along with a bit of faintly sweet pale malt. Herbal and grassy hop flavor combines with a light sweetness from the malts to create a hop tea flavor. It is accompanied by a mild bitterness that develops quite early on and pulls through to the finish. Moderately light body combines. A bit of fine carbonation props up an almost watery mouthfeel. An easy drinking biergarten brew.","HappyHourHero","Beers"
3.53,-0.6,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Pours light golden and effervescent with a thin foamy, mostly maintained white head. Aroma of malty grain, toasted malt, cracker crispy. Taste is sweet, malty, chewy, with undertones of bready lager yeast. Mouthfeel is between medium / full bodied with lively carbonation. Pretty good stuff.","stoutman","0"
