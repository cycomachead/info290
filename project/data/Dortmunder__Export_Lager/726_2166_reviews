"Clean, malty flavor.  Far less grainy than the smell indicates.  A touch of hop in the swallow, but otherwise this is all about the base.  The aftertaste has a bit of soured cream to it.  Full body for the style but with an equally high carbonation level.  Much more flavorful than a typical macro."

"We should all be so lucky to have cheap beer that tastes like this brewed domestically."
"Certainly not a bad Dortmunder, but very boring for the style. Surprisingly tasteless."

"A very light beer that I would consider  Germany's Coors Light. Pours a light yellow with a quickly  decimating head, DAB Export has barely any flavor and has a taste that I would describe as watery and light."

"Overall, this beer is a great example of the style, supposing you can get a fresh and canned (not skunked) version. It is, of course, a Dortmunder, so don't expect the flavor to punch you in the face. Nonetheless, it is a wonderful and refreshing beer. A relatively simple, but perfectly balanced beer, just as the style should be."

"The Pour was clear dark golden with a great white fluffy head that stayed together over the glass. The smell was fresh cut grains and hay with a bit of tinny hops. The taste was hay and strong alcohol, almost astringent. It was slightly creamy with the alcohol staying on the tongue. I was hoping for a more drinkable, refreshing beer but I will have a few more."

"Poured into a pint glass, nice frothy, white head with mild retention and some lacing. Appearance was clear and golden. Aroma was slightly hoppy with more bready, malty notes. Taste was crisp with slight malt, hop notes and some bread and fruit notes. Mouthfeel was light and carbonated with a crisp, clean aftertaste."

"D: A pretty solid example of a Dortmunder Export beer, but I'd like to see more bitterness in the finish of this beer."
"Overall a decent drinkable beer. It was crisp and left the palate satisfied. Not an overly interesting beer, but a good quencher."
"What can I say The first thing that came to mind was a strong Heiniken the taste was similer but body and mouthfeel a little firmer. Still I would take this over Heiniken any day this was my first Dortmunder Export and I would love to try others and compair. All in all not bad I'll have another."
"Pours a brilliantly clear pale straw. Fizzy white three finger head, showing decent retention and leaving stubborn lace. Lively, streaming carbonation. Some pale malt and pilsener in the nose, but the aroma of light-struck hops dominates. Cloying atrificial sweetness that vauguely resembles pale malt. Weak noble hops in the aftertaste, grossly unbalanced. Light bodied and somewhat crisp, but the off-sweetness and skunky hops ruin the flavor and drinkability."
"The mouthfeel is very interesting, it is light but has a kind of syrupy-buttery-melts-in-the-mouth quality where it gradually gets heavier. I like it. This is a very drinkable beer but I'm just not in love with this style."
"I'm likin' the Dortmunders a lot, and this is a good example. Much more noticeable malt flavor than a pale American lager, just a little more taste of German hops. Very drinkable, but too tempting to slam one down, especially after an evening spent cooking chile pork stew for the homebrew club picnic!"
"Unfortunately, due to its hop/malt balance and white/green/gold/red packaging, this beer bears an uncanny resemblance to Clausthaler N/A, which is a serious buzzkill."
