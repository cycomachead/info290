"Comes across like a cream ale, a bit sour, a bit hoppy with decent malt. Highly carbonated with a neutral body."

"Overall / Drinkability: Not knowing what this style was exactly when it was served in the restaurant I looked it up during the meal (thank you BA App!). When I saw it was a dortmunder after having drank about 1/3 of the glass I thought something must be wrong or someone thought if you combine a hefe, a lager, and some spices that this would be a dortmunder. I'm going to assume the brewer knew what they were doing and the odd flavors I got was due to poor service at the restaurant. But whatever the case, this is not a beer I want again and I found it a bit of a disappointment."

"Comments: This beer has more flavor and body than most golden lagers. It is very drinkable and balanced while remaining interesting. Talk your average Joe friends into trying this beer to expand their beer drinking experience."

"This isn’t quite the traditional style lager I expected. This one isn’t going to win any contests in my opinion, but its name rhymes with itself and is possibly a double entendre if you’re a pervert."
"I recommend giving it a try!"
"Goes down easy, but not something I would seek out."
"Dark gold color with no head. Interesting spicy aroma, taste was rich flavorful malt with a little burst of bitterness in the aftertaste. Mouthfeel was sufficient for style. Crisp and refreshing but kinda one dimensional. Good for thirst quenching but not much else. I first thought this was Coors Extra Gold but this grows on you."
"D: This was a solid beer offering, and I look forward to trying the other I have from the brewery. Worth checking out."
"The aroma is way off for the style but not altogether horrible as it's slightly citrusy. There is definitely malt and it's the corn type but there is also an ale like smell to it as well as metal and a touch of sour funk. The appearance is dead on it's golden with a little hazy and a big head. The flavor is like the aroma with a soapy, astringent finish. The palate is typical for the style. Overall it's an off beer but somehow it's got enough to it to make it sort of interesting."
"Outstanding!"
"Drinkability on the other hand for me is bad, not my favorite style by any means so I might not be a great judge here. But I would rank this with so many micros in my book by the fact I would just order water with my meal before ordering this beer again."
"This is the second of the DSB offerings I've sampled and it was pretty solid stuff. A: Deep golden with nice carbonation and durable head. S: Nice mix of malts and hops with neither winning out T: Very much like the nose but give the slight edge to the hops. Mild, smooth and tasty. M: light but right for a lager D: Very much a beer that should be repeated. Crisp and refreshing just what you want from a lager. Nice job Depot Street."
