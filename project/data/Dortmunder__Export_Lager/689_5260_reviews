"O-When cold the beer is enjoyably but as it warms it takes a turn for the worse."
"To me, this seems to have little flavor. The appearance is good although the lacing could be better. Both the aroma and flavor are very light and delicate; to my overloaded IPA-favoring taste buds there are hardly any of either."
"Easy drinking, but actually quite disappointing."

"Overall: A pretty solid take on a Dortmunder style Lager. Solid crisp bready taste with a nice backing of Noble hops."

"O: A nice dortmunder style brew. Pretty solid work by Two Brothers."

"Thanks to the creator of the canquest, woodychandler, for this beer. Poured from a 12 oz. can. Has a bright golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of grains, malts, some sweetness. Taste is crisp, malts, some grains, very refreshing. Feels mediu, bodied in trhe mouth and overall this makes a fine session beer."
"O - Not often that I drink the style, but its very drinkable."

" The flavor is very good with some yeast attributes which bring to mind fresh baked bread with light herbal flavor from the hops with a nice toasted middle and gentle fruitiness from either the hops or yeast with a slight Dimethyl Sulfide attribute which seems more like corn than anything. There is hardly any diacetyl and the lager has a very mild sweetness as it finishes which is pleasant. I consider this pretty darn drinkable. I would pick up more if it were available in my area."

"Beer is medium-light to light in body, with carbonation of medium intensity, leading to a mouthfeel that is fizzy at first, then smooth and foamy a few seconds later. Closes semi-dry, with light stickiness clinging to the palate and lips."
"12oz can, pours golden with striking clarity, frothy white head is fairly persistent. Aromas are sweet grain, grass, lager yeast, slight nuttiness. Tastes are sweet but sharp, grassy, nutty grain, yeast, slightly pungent on the clean finish. Body is ligher, but with a creamy mouth-feel; ample carbonation. Overall, refreshing & I love the can...much more attractive than the old bottle/label. Good summertime beer."

"Here was yet another brimful craft CAN that revealed itself upon the Crack. The Old Lady gave a little squeal of delight when I showed her what I have noted as a recent phenomenon. Nothing like getting just a little more than you expect. The Glug producd a finger of foamy, rocky, bone-white head with reasonable retention. Color was a light lemon-yellow with NE-quality clarity. SRM = 3. Nose had a soft Saaz grassiness. Mouthfeel was medium-to-full with a pleasant grassiness on the tongue. I would have guessed German Pils were it not for the CAN's verbiage. Finish was semi-dry, grassy, very mild and pleasant. A great summer beer."

"Personal Rate: 3.75"
"Overall I found a couple of similar reviews of this batch ""best by 8/27/12"" mentioning a sulfur and sour egg thing going on. I guess a lager can get infected..."

"Pours a transparent straw color with a minimal white head that is soon gone--utterly unremarkable. Aroma is mild, smelling of grain and some light hops. Not much to distinguish it from the most stereotypical beer smell. Upon tasting, the crispness stands out more than anything. A floral and citric hop flavor is most prominent, with just enough light malt to lend some balance. Nothing terribly fancy going on here, but it is crisp, drinkable, and refreshing, which is, as I understand it, what this style is all about."

"Overall: an interesting beer. Not too bad, but there's just not too much to distinguish it."
"O - a solid example of the style."

"O- A very good beer that is a is a strong example of the style. Worth a try. Very easy drinking."

"Overall-- I don't even like Dortmunder lagers, but this is a very nice beer. A perfect beer to offer BMC drinkers and craft fans alike."

"Two Brothers Dog Days poured a full gold color with a small white head, and average lacing. Smell was loaded with grain and Saaz like hops. Taste was crisp, with malts, and followed by a mild biscuit like hop bite. Mouthfeel was lighter in body with mild carbonation and was good for the style. Drinkability was nice as well. Overall this beer is decent for a summer seasonal beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"I really like Two Brothers. Everyone gets one miss. This is theirs."
""
"Pours a rich golden color, mostly clear, with a white fizzy foam head that fizzes away. Aroma of bready malts, spicy, herbal hops, a touch of citrus, and straw. In the flavor, rich biscuity malt flavor and a presence of mild tea like, earthy, grassy hops. Pale malt flavor with faint watery honey oat bread flavor. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, crisp, and well carbonated. Overall, an aptly named beer perfect to drink during the dog days of summer."

"D/O: One should look no further for a full-flavored lager of normal strength, as long as the flavors are allowed to fall outside of the normal limited expectations of the style. A witches brew of beer-related organic molecules monopolize the nose and also make a strong showing in the flavor of this beer. When combined with an assertive bill of light malts, the palate cannot help but be entertained. Confused at times, but always entertained."

"Pours a clear golden amber color with a fluffy white head that makes for a great appearance during those hot summer days. Scent is a nice blend of caramel malts and noble hops giving it the authentic German Pilsner scent. The taste is comprised of soft mellow grains that compliment each other very nicely. It also has some hints of citrus and a slight spice as well that finishes nice and crisp. Quite a refreshing summer beer that isn't too heavy or too light."

"Taste is sharp at first, with a definite bread and yeast character. Hints of citrus hops are also omnipresent, making this one a very tasty, balanced, and well-done lager. I would drink more of these, no problem."
"I am rating this beer very highly because I think it absolutely nails this style, perhaps improving on it. If you don't like this style you're not going to agree with me but if you do you shouldn't miss this one. Beautifully executed. I am becoming a big fan of this brewery."
"O - Not a bad beer, decent representation of the style, and possibly one of the better beers I've had by Two Brothers."
"O: An easy drinker; not as crisp and dry as I expect (and want) from my lagers and pilsners, but a serviceable option on a hot summer day in the ""dog days of August."""
"Light amber in color with tons of carbonation bubbling up to the surface. Really nice and tight looking as white head of maybe an inch and a half came up and settled down, fading slightly but holding its own. Light grains and bready malt notes really pulling through here. Some smattering of hops in there but again nothing really pushing that way, this was a well rounded, and very straight forward lager. As I take the first sip, crisp, clean flavor rolls across the taste buds. Really very well put together. Earthy, nice touches of grain and smooth, mellow caramel notes infiltrate as it warms. Light banana and clove maybe then coming through. I am very pleased here as the light body and ample carbonation make for something that went down like water"
"Overall this was a surprisingly decent drink. I'd get this again, but it wouldn't be my first choice."
"Pretty clear gold colored brew but there is some chill haze. Smallish pillowy white head, nice lace. Scent is sweet and grainy. Pretty grainy taste, malts dominate. Liquid bread. Nice kiss of hops as well. Clean and refreshing, this is a pretty well put together lager. Pretty sharp on the tongue. Good brew, id get it again"
"Served from a 12 oz. bottle. Pours a medium pale golden, with a significant amount of foam that persists quite nicely, leaving about a 3/4 layer on top, and a nice amount of lacing. Decent aroma, with a prevalent maltiness, and apricot/hop notes in the background. Piney hoppy notes come to the fore upon tasting. Maltiness is a bit more understated than I would have liked for the style. Mouthfeel is good, with a welcome full-bodiedness, though I would have preferred a bit more carbonation. Overall, an enjoyable drink, if a bit hoppy for my ideal of the style."
"Overall a very nice representation of a dortmunder lager. I look forward to this beer coming out every year near summer. Nice thirst quencher. Very sessionable."
"Overall, pretty decent brew. Im never disappointed with Two Brothers!"
"A great golden color with little head when served. The smell wasn't very powerful but definately had a malty smell. Taste was very crisp and clean with malt flavors very prevalent. The alcohol content kicks nicely on the way down. Definitely a great summer beer that's smooth and easy to drink."
"DD has a real nice grain and malt taste. The real joy of this brew is the full and flavorfull mouthfeel. This is one of the easiest drinking brews and its an ideal summer session lagger."
"O- an average dortmunder that did not have enough noble hops or german malts for the style..it was however a thirst quencher and one that i will have again"
"Flavor is similarly light, easygoing in feel, soft carbonation with a slight crispness. Lightly bready, with a gentle toasted malt flavor. Very light inkling of noble hops, lending a hint of grassy astringency. Pairs great with spicy food, barbecue, just about anything. A solid session candidate as well. It's well made with no flaws, a good gateway craft lager for the novice craft drinker. Locally I prefer Metropolitan's lagers, but this one seems targeted for a broader crowd."
"FINE, BUT NOT A MUST HAVE!"
"This seemed like a nice choice to finish my mixed sixer from Dobby's. It pours a clear golden straw topped by a small finger of white foam. The nose comprises wheat, very light caramel, light walnut, and flowers. The taste holds notes of grass, light buttery biscuits, wheat, and walnut. The body is a hefty-ish light, with a light moderate carbonation and a fluid feel. Overall, a pretty nice Dort, nothing wild, but it's certainly easy-going enough."
"An all around excellent lager. I really love it. Something that I highly recommend."
"OVERALL: The Dog Days was not exactly what I expected from a Dortmunder, but it was very pleasant nonetheless. This would be an excellent beer for a warm summer afternoon...at least if Two Brothers decides to release it again at some point in the future."
"Light bodied and easy to drink. Should have had this around over the summer. Important: none of the chemical aftertaste of the big commercial lagers or of the really cheap versions."
"Pours a light golden color with a white head and not too much lacing. The nose is a bit of light hops as well as some grain and a bit of sweetness. Some grassy grain and a bit of bread and caramel in the taste. Nice, light body with really great drinkability on a hot day."
"This is not a bad beer but it could have been better and much more drinkable if the sweetness wasn't so prevalent."
"D: Good for a hot day thirst quencher. Easy drinking, not much else."
"D: I'd buy this again. This beer just makes me happy."
"Avoid this."
"Very light head, hardly any foam, what's there is clear white, nada lacing. The slight gauze doesn't effect the overall transparency, straw yellow color, not that vivid, very few and randomly scattered bubbles, has the appearance of a beer gone flat. Pretzel dough, wheat bread in the nose, the peppery bite and hops give it lots of verve, softened by a light florality, the malts lack distinguishing qualities, some milk chocolate and hard butterscotch candy, solid apricot, peach scents without seeming fruity, overall well-integrated and easy to kick back and sniff. Medium-bodied, carbonation gives it a steady churn without getting in the way of smoother drinkability. The malted milk balls and chocolate ease the mouth entry, then orange to lemon citrus perks things up, greener straw and hay notes. Brings on some ginger, coriander notes too. Quieter tone to the pear, peach, apricot fruit, however, consistently there. Slight turn to bitterness through the finish, keeps it lively. Solid, crafted to be so rather than spectacular, a rarer and rarer thing. Could easily put a few down in one sitting."
"Did I mention that I pretty much love the Two Brothers beers I've tried. This is the nicest easy going balanced summer session beer I've come across. Pours a bright golden hue with egg shell white head, forming nice speckled lacing with each sip. Aroma has light biscuit malts and herbal grassy/strong mineral water notes in the finish. A solid liquid bread type of beer, tastes clean and smooth with ample balance a crip hoppiness goes quite nicely with the semi sweet biscuit/cracker notes. A sight lemongrass herba tones in the finish. Mouthfeel is light bodied solidly carbonated with ample CO2, smooth going down I could have went for a whole six instead of a single. Great tasting brew that deserves be drunk in number during the Dog Days of Summer."
"D: Would be easy to session this but the flavor isn't my cup of tea."
"D: The beer is very easy to drink and can be sessionable, particularly on a hot summer day."
"D- meh, this isnt my favorite two brothers beer. something ill still try at least once a year, but not too much more than that."
"A solid Lager, easy to drink, but with just enough extra flavor compared to many in this category to set itself above them."
"I have always enjoyed this style when I can find it. As with this product, most dortmunders are seasonal offerings. This is ideal for the hot, summer months."
"D -- Drinkability is solid, but I was hoping for more of that true German maltiness in this beer. It's trying hard, but falling a little short."
"I'm not sure about this one. Nice mouthfeel and appearance, but the aroma immediately tuned me off, and the flavor wasn't as unified as it should be. Not something I'll pick up again."
"Pours a clear golden honey color with a wispy white head that settles into a solid ring. The aroma is of a sweet bready malt with hints of grassy bitterness. Perhaps a touch grainy. The taste is light and somewhat grainy, there is a touch of honey sweetness and grassy hop bitterness. Has some hay like characteristics. The feel is moderate with active carbonation, the beer starts off sweet but finishes with a light bitter kick. A tad heavier than most lagers but drinks very well. It is nice to see another American brewery make this style as it is a good summertime brew."
"Overall: Great beer that I would come back to or recommend to others when looking for a Lager."
"D - Very easy to drink; satisfying."
"Tastes weedy--maybe it's just the power of suggestion, maybe it's just the european hops, but I'm getting a strong floral profile here that's almost like dandelions. That drifts towards a drier, earthier middle, and then ends on long, dry hops."
"D - Good session beer, I plan to go to this frequently over the summer."
"D: A little tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, mild kick, good representation of style, this is a decent lighter beer to drink for a while but there are others that I would choose first."
"There's something not quite right about this beer. Too sweet; too fruity. They said it was their only lager, so it makes sense that it's rather ale-like"
"D- This could be a really easy beer to drink all night, but it's just not my thing."
"D: Off the charts. Not filling and extremely partakable. Refreshing."
"I like the label. There are a lot of lagers like this out there, but it's not a Dort. Since I don't buy beers for labels, pass."
"great tasty session brew. this would be great to have pouring from a kegerator throughout summer. bravo"
"This is my first Dortmunder and I look forward to comparing it to some other offerings."
"M & D: Medium bodied for the style and very dry. Very lackluster beer."
"Reviewed on 07/31/2009. On gravity keg at Blind Tiger. Pours a cloudy orange with a white head. Aroma of sweet fruit and orange peel. Flavor of light, sweet lager malt, nice citrus hops, and wheat/bread. Nice and refreshing. It was a pleasant surprise."
"This is my first dortmunder and the drinkability was prettygood. Not great a a drinkable beer."
"This might be the first dortmunder I've had ever; at least as long as I've been paying attention. The name makes it sound stronger than what it is so I've avoided it as a summer drink. The bartender described it as sweeter than a pilsner but the same lightness otherwise. That's pretty much what I would call it as well. Very drinkable, a little bit of malty sweetness but still as refreshing as a good pilsner. Great combination of maltiness and drinkability. Good color and good carbonation as well."
"D: This is an OK beer. The metallic flavors detracted from the experience for me. The low ABV makes it go down easily."
"From a straight taste and ease standpoint, drinkability is high as a maff. You could knock these puppies (ha) back all night. From the price standpoint, it runs about $9 a sixer. Knock the price down about a $1.50 per six-pack and you've got a higher drinkability score."
"D: Much more refreshing and easier to drink than Trois Pistole, but that is an apple to oranges comparison. Let's just say that on a hot, sweaty night like this one, this beer certainly hits the proverbial spot."
"overall,i not one of my favorite styles.but this is a pretty good beer.i like it."
"This was a really well balanced lager and a nice introduction to Two Brothers. I hope the rest of their beer is as good or better than this."
"This beer was left at my place after a bon-fire and i thought it would go good with my wings last night. If the name was referring to the Dog Days of summer and the fact that you just need something,anything, then it fit but otherwise; I found the color to be nice transparent gold. Thin white head, that disapated quickly. The taste was crisp but not very strong, which may have gone good with my wings but i drank most of it before they were done grillin cause I wanted to get on to the next beer. Overall I would have liked a stronger taste to go with the good color maybe something to remember itself by."
"D - It's a very easy drinking lager, I'll give it that. It's good for the style despite it's very lacking head and touch of fruity esters (good flavor but shouldn't be there)."
"Two brothers never disappoints."
"Two Brothers Dog Days poured a full gold color with a small white head, and average lacing. Smell was loaded with hops. Taste was crisp, with malts, and followed by a mild hop bite. Mouthfeel was good for the style. Drinkability was nice as well. Overall all I enjoyed this beer a great deal. I a fan of this style, ans wish more brewers offered it. This beer is good for a summer seasonal beer."
"a very good summertime beer - i will be picking up more of this one"
"In my opinion this is a typical example of a session brew. There's nothing offensive about it, yet it has decent enough flavor to still be enjoyable and is light enough to throw back a bunch over the course of a sitting."
"D-Not particularly familiar w/this style, but it's decent. Easy to drink, pleasant, sessionable."
"Overall this would be a good drink on a summer afternoon with fairly low ABV"
"A bit schizophrenic in quality and in the end, boring and uninteresting flavor. The low ABV is nice but not really willing to drink more than this than necessary."
"Pours an bright golden with a frothy white head. Aroma is lightly sweet grainy malts, corn and noble hops. Flavor is malty sweetness initially then more bready with a crisp bitter finish. Light to medium bodied, creamy texture. A decent Helles with a slight alcohol aftertaste."
"drinkability: ok, just not my fav"
"This beer is boring, worth trying if you like moderately flavored beer. There is an itty-bitty hop bite in the aftertaste which is the only sign of life in the beer. The malts get more apparent as it warms but they never make a run for the gold."
"As a side note, every beer I've yet sampled from Two Brothers has been top-notch..."
"Drinkability is moderate to high. Easily sessionable, and decent flavors makes for pretty easy consumption. This style in general lacks complexity and is uninspiring which limits the brew slightly."
"Drinks down very easy and is totally quenchable. Gone in no time flat. A bit more length and complexity in the flavor and this would make for a easy choice as a regular rotation for summer brews."
"Two Brothers is a brewery from the Chicago area that has made a splash here in New York City with its wide range of excellent renditions of many styles of beer, Ale and Lager alike. While this is far from the first of their beers, which range in style from Belgian Farmhouse Ales to this Dortmunder Style Lager, that I've tried, it struck me that Two Brothers has really outdone itself with this, arguably the most humble style it has tackled. Dortmunder style Lagers were amongst the first German Lagers to be consumed en masse in Europe -- a German take on the Czech Pilsen beer, the ""Export"" Lager version of this beer, at a slightly higher ABV than other varieties, caught on and eventually molded all Lagers from that point on. The Two Brothers version is a crisp and refreshing beer, with all kinds of subtle flavors going on -- spicy, sweet, citrusy, and more. Mostly though, this is one of the most drinkable and tasty beers that I've had in a long time in terms of sheer drinkability. The Dog Days beer is perfect for summer days, where you want your beer to have some real flavor, but you want to drink a lot, and you don't want to be praying for death the next morning. This has all of those qualities, and it pours a beautiful, perfectly carbonated golden color with a big white head and all the smells you could hope for in a beer. An excellent take on an under-investigated style and another winner for Two Brothers."
"No trouble finishing this one, but wouldn't grab another, either. Glad I didn't pay for it."
"I am again impressed by these guys. Very good American-Dortmunder style. Nice job!"
"Not a bad beer, but not something I will revisit."
"Not bad, fairly smooth. Worth trying, though it's nothing overwhelming."
"Pours a clear gold with a very thin white head. Nose is bready. Flavor is tangy sweet a bit. Kind of too much. A bit bready on the flavor as well. But the sweet tang just overpowers things here. Feel is decent, as is the drinkability. This is okay. Not something I'd go for again, but hey...nice to try."
"Dog Days is bright, clear, and lemony gold with a fuzzy white cap. It features light caramel and toasted malts with earthy-grassy, lightly spicy, noble hops in both smell and flavor. The mouthfeel is exceptionally smooth and oily creamy considering its relatively light body. It is a very well done dortmunder style lager. These two brothers continue to impress me with their beers."
"A nice light-to-medium body, certainly quite sessionable and worthy of firkining."
"D-Good quaffer on a hot day refreshing if unremarkable."
"D - This was our first stop on my bachelor party micro-brewery pub crawl, and most of my buddies drank this since they are weirded out by most craft brews. A basic but satisfying lager."
"Overall a tasty and easy drinking lager. Thanks to unclejedi."
"Drinkability: Needlessly bland. C'mon, even the humble Dortmunder Lager can shine and sparkle if you allow it to."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: It's light bodied. Carbonation is okay. It's somewhat drinkable. I just think it's a bit ho-hum for a session. There's much better choices on the market. Overall, it's okay. Nothing spectacular."
"Aroma is fresh and malty. Some slight citrus hints in the background. The taste is very true to style. A good malty crisp light beer for a warm day. It has mostly malty elements with just the slightest hop finish. It is very smooth and easy to drink a few of these. I have now tried a few by Two Brothers and I think they are definitely a good up and coming craft brewery."
"But the taste, that sour dough ball of bread, just doesnt sit well with me, and Ive now had several Dorts. Even the lasting finish with some caramel cant pull this one over to my list of beers I like  and thats saying a lot. But I wont down grade the taste score just because of it."
"Maybe if this was cold as hell and served on a hot, hot August day....hence the name."
"Drinkability - this is not bad, but it's not good either, so that kills off sessionability."
"this is straw to apricot in color with perfect clarity. white head and lacing. vegetal and grassy aromas along with some bready caramel notes in the nose. really smells like a lager. taste is a very light malt sweetness finished up with german hop bitterness. metallic twang in the finish. light in body with a crisp mouthfeel. a good lawnmower beer."
"Mouthfeel was medium with mild carbonation. Smooth."
"Kind of dry to drink a lot of them, but definitely goes down easily and is enjoyable."
"Pours a hazy golden color with a one finger head. Aroma is very mild with sweet malts and faint hops. Taste is an excellent sweet bread - very malty. Just enough hops come through to cleanse the sugary taste away and keep it from being too sweet. Mouthfeel is very good, not too light. Very drinkable summer beer. Not quite a lawnmower beer, very nice."
"Dog Days Dortmunder Style Lager Beer is clearly the product of a capable craft brewery. Even though it doesn't quite jibe with the characteristics that I like to see in a Dortmunder, I can see how plenty of people might like it."
"Not terrible, but nothing real impressive in my book."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a minimal 1/4"" white head over the clear golden brew. Head is a skim of bubbles quickly, with average to good lacing. Aroma is tart with a light sweetness. Taste is pale malts upfront, balanced with sedate hops. Mouthfeel and drinkability are good, this one could be an acceptable dinner beverage with most any meal, like those people who get along with just about anyone."
"D- The punch of hops bitterness doesn't have any depth and the malt flavors are nice and fresh but very faint and a bit hidden behind the hops."
"Served in a pilsner glass, the beer pours a light golden color with a very small white head. It smells like light citrus and floral hops, and also grainy/breadiness. The taste is mainly a malty breadiness with a light hoppy middle and aftertaste. The mouthfeel is light, but the beer is very smooth, crisp and refreshing. The drinkability is very good, I could probably down quite a few of these. I think this is a pretty decent beer. A great summer beer, but good for any other time of year as well."
"This lager pours a clear, honey gold body with a small white that deposits some patchy lacing. Aroma is toffee maltiness and spicy and floral noble hops. Well carbonated and light bodied in the mouth. Taste is crispy, biscuity malts and a substantial floral hops bitterness. Well balanced, overall, and a very drinkable lager style that would be ideal for a session."
"The drinkability is very good. I love fresh beer! Prosit, MK"
"M&D - smooth and highly drinkable, well balanced between sweet and bitter, very easy down a great brew"
"Mouthfeel- Refreshing and relaxing is what comes to mind first and foremost. The palate of this beer enhanced my mood at the time and added something special to the evening."
"I thought this beer was well balanced and very drinkable. A good summertime brew for those hot and humid days."
"Wonderful! A simple, yet delicious beer. Very well done!"
"Taste is malt first with a bit of sweetness, followed by some good well-balanced hops. Yum. Mouthfeel is neither thick nor thin, which seems proper. I get some carbonation feel on the lips but not too much. I haven't been drinking a lot of lagers lately and haven't really liked the ones I have tried, but this one is good. Definitely an easy to drink brew, probably the only lager I've had that I'd want to drink several of, though as I noted lagers haven't been my thing of late."
"Medium mouth with smooth carbonation. Easy enough drinker. Nice change of pace summer beer here!"
"Part of the ""Summer Brews"" pack from Cost Plus World Market. Label says 4.9% abv. Poured a medium gold with a thin head that fizzed out pretty quickly. Good lacing, though. Mild smell of hops. Taste begins with sweet, doughy malt and is quickly balanced with crisp hops. Very smooth and easy drinking. Great example of a summer beer and of the Dortmunder style, this would be a perfect beer to have with a burger or a brat."
"Pours a clear medium gold, with a thin white head and a constant stream of bubbles. Aroma is a mix of doughy malt, some grassy and slightly citrusy notes. Flavor is very well balanced, beginning with a biscuity malt, and finishing with some spicy noble hops... not overly hopped, but enough to make things interesting. Mouthfeel is light and crisp. All in all, this is an excellent summer quaff, and one I'll definitely be keeping in my fridge!"
"A nice beer, not world class, but a good summer refreshment. Another good beer from Two Brothers."
"Cloudy deep golden in color with a small floating particles, small white head that doesn't last very long, Bready and flowery aromas, starts sweet and bready with a hint of grains, light to medium bodied, nice soft mouthfeel, finishes clean, not bad."
"Golden color, clearish, with a thin 1/4 inch head of decent duration. Laces are simple and spare in a pint glass. A fair bit of spicy hop aroma, some cinnamon and an earthy wet canvas maltiness that works better than it sounds (I occasionally use ""wet canvas"" to describe some pretty foul brews). Thin body, medium carbonation. Malt falls in the toasted range of bread and is reserved. Respectably balanced with a good late hop twang. A very good summer beer for drinkability and balance, but a little tame overall and lacking in memorable body."
"The Rathskeller Wine & Beer Fest:A medium sized white head with small sized bubbles.The body was cloudy with soft carbonation.The hue was straw yellow and the nose was lightly hopped.The flavor was hoppy and the mouthfeel was smooth, light, thin, and watery."
"It's ok. Not too bad. I tasted the caramel and malt but very faint.The hop characteristics weren't as prominant as I would expect in a Dortmunder. High citrus flavor throughout and a very light finish overall. I like it but the next time I want a Dortmunder I'm going for Great Lakes."
"Not ubercomplex (nor should it be). And also not GL Dortmunder Gold. Nonetheless, it hits the style, and the spot, fairly well."
"My favorite seasonal from the two bro's. This years model is the best ever. Nice color, head retention is minimal. But the mouthfeel, and flavor are wonderful and lingering. As this brew passes my lips I only want to savor the nicely roasted maltiness and the velvety texture-everything is so fresh, and almost savory- like enjoying freshly baked bread and home-ade butter. Well, sooner or later ya have to swallow and then it's time for another round of sloshing and slurping this tasty beverage around to extract the maximum pleasure. A doggone tasty beverage!!"
"Two Brothers Dog Days: another fine brews from the Western Suburban brothers. This one pours a light golden color, nice clarity, but not a whole lot of head. Nice appetizing aroma, fairly malty. The taste is very nice, Lightly malted, with more than a little taste of candy. The label says caramel, but thats not it, it was more like a faint taste of hard butterscotch candies. The finish is cleaned up nicely by a dusting of hops. As pone would expect from a summer brew, this is light and refreshing. Pick it up if you have the chance."
"It's pale golden in color and just a touch hazy. The aroma is mellow spicy hops and caramel malt. There's a very nice maltiness to this lager which surprised me. The spicy hops come through for a crisp and dry finish. This is a wonderful refresher. It's not complicated in flavor but it doesn't have to be. It's not as watery as most lagers and the carbonation is perfect. It went up to 87 degrees today and this six pack came in handy."
"Head is big and foamy, color is clear golden. Aroma is next to nothing: dry, vegetal,herbal, a touch floral, and fresh. The palate is quite dull, lacks any kind of nuance, or any sort of spark. I'll be the first to label me a non-lager lover, but this just has nearly nil to speak for itself, and while I can imagine it's handiness as the proverbial ""lawnmower beer", that's not quite enough. Blah. Just blah..."
"This is a very good brewery....This Dortmunder is another example...I'm still learning to identify hop varieties, but the nose on this beer is very nice...some spicy/fresh notes...the body is medium light...gold in color with a creamy white head...very good maltiness for this style, with a dry hop finish....very drinkable and refreshing...high quality beer..."
"The beer pours a clear deep golden and throws out a healthy white head that laces nicely.  Big malt presence on the nose with a hint of spicy noble hops.  The malt profile in this beer is deep and clean.  Very satisfying.    It also has an earthy and herbal hop aftertaste splattered with spicy notes here and there.  And did I mention the lingering bitterness that is quite lovely also.  The body of this beer is medium at least.  Good healthy body for a lager.  It finishes a bit dry, but nicely.  This is my kind of lager.  Very nicely done.  Refreshing and smooth."
