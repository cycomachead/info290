One thing I will say is that this is easily the best Russian beer I have ever tried, but to be honest I haven't had very many, and the others were pretty terrible. Baltika #7 is no masterpiece, but I'd have no issue with drinking another bottle here and there - but that being said, German and Polish lagers are better, easier to find, and often cheaper, so this one's utility is rather limited.","thehyperduck","Oct 19, 2014"

3,-1.3,3.5,2.75,3,3.25,3,"After being told about this whole Baltika line by a former co-worker, I was relatively jazzed to find a few at my local Caputo's. This one pours a clear pale golden-straw topped by a finger of relatively short-lived white foam. The nose comprises wild rice, generic grain, light flowers, very light grass, and a splash of hard water. The taste brings in more of the same, though a firm semi-biscuit backbone is evident, and the flowers provide a cleaner hop thrust than before. Still, everything just kinda lies there, mostly lifeless, certainly character-less. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a slickly watery feel. Overall, this is just a boring, unassuming, little guy, something I'd likely confuse with any other bland Euro lager. It's not bad, per se, just nothing I'd ever really wanna drink again.","TMoney2591","Jul 29, 2013"

The taste is diffenently that of a euro pale lager and not a Dortmunder. Flavor is nice and sweet with a mild grainy taste.

It pours a clear golden body with yellow highlights and a full and foamy bright-white head that dissipates quickly. It keeps a decent collar through most of the glass, and even leaves some lace. The aroma displays some semi-grainy malt with a light sweetness. The body is medium with a soft carbonation that helps to give the impression of a fuller body than actually exists. The flavor is as the nose suggests, with an adjunct laden but still mildly grainy maltiness. The bitterness is restrained, and it finishes with some gently lingering sweetness.
