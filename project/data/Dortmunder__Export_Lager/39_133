Pours a light gold in color with a 1-finger+ of a white head. Leaves a lot of lacing when sipped. many streaming bubbles were seen rising from the bottom and sides of the glass BUT the carbonation was actually perfect. The aroma is of grain, malt with a hint of citrus. The taste is pretty close with a nice 'sweet' flavor really coming through. Very pleasant and easy to drink.

Initial impression is a big carbonic bite on the front of the tongue. The initial ""bite"" is so big, there is no real flavor impression until the finish, which seems very balanced with a bit of sweet and bitter. The malts sweetness has a flavor somewhere between caramel and honey, but very mild. The bitterness is somewhat herbal and has a minerally-like bite.

Bubbles flow to the top with the playfulness of champagne. It smells clean, bready, with a very slight herbal sweetness. It doesn’t so much pique your intellectual interest as it does lure you in with its back-to-basics approach. As I am an American, I have certain built-in expectations with beers of such a light color. Any expectation of thinness or boredom, though, disappears in the first taste as the full-bodied character of the helles immediately occupies the appropriate senses. It is refreshing, drinkable. It’s malty without being sticky. It is the epitome of well-balanced. I want a liter or three in a giant glass mug while I peer over the landscape on a cool summer afternoon. I am in a state of Gemütlichkeit.","Eddxii","Aug 08, 2012"

Head is minimal but the ring around the glass is thick and stays the whole way down. Nose has a light yeast character that meshes well with some grassy/spicy hops. Light, doughy malt character is in equal proportion to the hops and yeast. Flavor has a malty sweetness upfront but switches right over to some fruity grass and pale malts. Finishes with that fruity/grass hop character playing a big role and lingering. The malty dough sweetness carries throughout the finish even with a big dryness at the end. The balance of malts and hops from start to finish is extremely satisfying.","DrinkingDrake","Oct 02, 2011"

The only positive thing I can say about this beer is the head retention continued for the full 12 oz session in my pint glass. The starting head was only 1 finger thick but held.

Crisp, well-detailed nose of mellow hops, grain, straw with more of a suggestion of honey than delivery, sourdough bread, the malts smooth out the texture without ever dominating. Light to medium-bodied with persistent carbonation which adds to the body rather than disperse it. Oats, grain, bread dough, lemongrass and lemon peel, clove, at no time bitter nor sweet, expertly treads the middle ground, balance more important than making an impression.

The appearance was of a filtered pilsner with a hint more of orange (a hint to more malt) and a big frothy head with lots of carbonation (maybe a little too much carbonation). The smell was classic German festbier / helles / pilsner. Taste was a nice surprise. Being a special beer the flavor had to be something different, well not too different to mess with a winning German beer formula. To me it taste as though they added more of each ingredient to bring more flavor all around and especially more sweetness from the extra malt that gave the hint of orange color and a tad more alcohol. But by increasing all the ingredients some what equally the refreshing balance is maintained. Mouth feel is watery, smooth and hint of slickness.

The first thing is when it hits the tip of the tongue and you taste a sweetness of the malted barley. Usually I'm not a fan of sweetness especially when accompanied by lagers. Ever since my first lager (Butt-wiper), the smell and taste of the sweet beverage has always been sickening. This however is very nice. Mouthfeel is crisp and nice, very good.

Somewhat dry aftertaste with a faint yeast bite anf fading acidity- this makes for a good balance when combined with the mild spicy/floral German hop flavor. Light bodied and medium carbonated- but brisk on the tounge due to the wheat texture and citric character.

The Jahrhundert pours a yellow straw color with a slight haze to it. There is a very nice malt/hops aroma coming out of the glass.

The body is quite rich and creamy, the Munich malts are the key player here, with some dry hoppiness in the body. Medium bodied.

In the middle, there is an intermittent banana and black pepper sweetens between the initial grains and the final dryness. The mouth feel is thick but on the verge of being too carbonated.

I wish this one had measured up to the fine standard Franz Inselkammer has set with their other offerings. The beer pours out the color of pale golden straw. A big, fluffy head forms and leaves behind some lace. Smell is almost missing in action. Light hops and lighter malt are the only notes found. Taste is a bit hoppy without being bitter but there is not much to taste either. Mouthfeel is lightly carbonated and a medium body. Drinkability could be so much higher if it had something to taste. In the end, this was more like a German version of an American megabrew offering, a disappointing beer. My only hope - after reading some of the other reviews -is that I simply got a bad bottle. I might try it again down the road.","PorterLambic","Jan 04, 2005"

Aroma is delicate with a distant sweetness...grassiness, husken malts, pale grains, lightly perfumy hops all contribute to a nice, bready, satisfying nose. Mouthfeel is full, bright and crisp, with a smooth, lingering aftertaste. Medium-light in body. Taste is of the highest quality...perfectly balanced contributions of the above noted tastes and aromas..the water is clean and fresh, and the finish is bready with just a hint of cookie-like sweetness.

Flavor is a mix of a malt base (grainy quality), but with hop bitterness present and firm (a little strong for style, Helles). Long dry and bitter finish that is also rather crisp leaving a thirst quenching quality. Fairly carbonated, which keeps it feeling heavier that it is, but also adds some fluffiness.

Aroma was a little yeasty, and at the front the flavor was likewise yeasty and a little bready, almost like a weizen.  Good, solid mouthfeel, a little unrefined.  Overall, not a bad bier, but did not really grab my interest.","Brent","Oct 25, 2002"
4.33,9.6,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"pours a beautiful golden color with a creamy white head that sinks slowly and a nice lace down the glass.  Nice biscuity malt aroma to this one that is balanced out by the earthy hoppiness of the noble hops used.  Great biscuity malt character that gives the bier a great creamy mouthfeel.  The hops were a little more subtle that expected, but were still very nice as they provided a great balance to this brew.  Awesomely drinkable brew with its smooth creaminess and excellent flavor.  I don't generally like a lot of the lager styles of bier but this was an absolute joy to drink.","Murph","Sep 14, 2002"
3.97,0.5,3.5,4,4,3,4.5,"Talk about standing to attention, not only does the head on this beer look like meringue, the lace also peaks like fluffy egg whites!  Quite a sight.  I'm all with the others on the citrusy finish.  It left my mouth squeaky clean.  And, indeed, it is refreshing.  I am more awake after drinking this baby.","DarthMalt","Jun 08, 2002"

3.66,-7.3,4.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"The huge fluffy white head settles painfully slowly.  It's a notch darker than a pilsner and is yellowish -gold in color.  Clarity is excellent.  Soft, slightty grainy notes in the aroma, with only a hint of a herbal noble hop nose.  Clean aroma overall, but not too exciting.  A clean malt sweetness dominates the flavor, but a clean hop bitterness does a fine job of both balancing the malt sweetness and adding to the drinkability of this brew.  There's a bit of a nondescript grassy finish, but the taste is overall clean and balanced, borderlining on being bland.  Although Jahrhudert is a well brewed beer, it leaves me craving a good helles, which has many of the same qualities, albeit with a more pronounced malt character.","marc77","Apr 07, 2002"
4.08,3.3,4,3.5,4.5,4,4,"Notes: First brewed in 1978 in celebration of the 100th anniversary for Brewery Aying, a great choice for this creation. A wonderful malt profile. This beer makes you crave for more ... very appetizing. Went well with some dark rye bread and mild goat cheese.","Jason","Apr 04, 2002"
4.1,3.8,4,4,4,4,4.5,"real nice slight fruit smell,nice and clean.Could drink alot of this one somewhat different than the dortmunder gold of Great Lakes Brewing,much more delecate.Liked em both havent had to many dortmunder syles but Iam sure this is a standard.Something to drink when eating a light meal.","oberon","Mar 03, 2002"
4.68,18.5,4.5,4,5,4.5,5,"Clear golden lager, rising up to a wonderful puffy head. Absolutely delicious. Ayinger does it again. I love this brewery. Clean crisp taste, smooth, flavorful. Ayinger brews (this one included) remind me gently of apples. Complex taste that grows bolder with each sip. Leaves you feeling light as a feather  - most beers can make you a bit logy. Disappears from my glass very quickly, too quickly. If it was cheaper I'd probably drink it all the time. Man, if Anheuser Busch could learn how to make a beer like this, they could rule the world. Excellent complement to a weird pineapple chicken dish that I had.","Thrasher","Feb 21, 2002"
4.4,11.4,4,4,5,4,4,"Impressive amount of both malt taste and aroma. This beer tastes like you are literally snacking on fresh grain. A touch of sweetness rounds out the husky flavor(which some may not care for but I certainly do). Hops are not that noticible to me, a slight bitterness though. Color is appealing and mouthfeel is initially crisp. Quality brew from a quality brewer.","hbis2gut","Oct 08, 2001"
