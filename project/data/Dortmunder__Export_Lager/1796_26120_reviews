"A very good beer and definitely up there with the best lager-style beers I think I have tried. Slightly sweet with a great balance between flavours and one that proved very easy to drink from the start."

"O: Good drinkability. Another smooth and easidrinking German Lager beer"
"Now the smell and taste. Smell is ok but not breathtaking. It is as to be expected in this style. Taste is rather flat because of the lack of carbonation. Some sweetness with a bit dry aftertaste."

"Overall: This beer is very one dimensional, even for the style."
"The beer pours a yellow color with a white head. The aroma is a mix of grassy hops and grain. The flavor is grassy hops with low bitterness and some grain and bready malt. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. Not too much going on here."
"The 5.6%ABV is just about detectable within the brew, but I found the whole expereince a bit disappointing, I had been looking forward to this beer. I traded this at the Pre-Zythos earlier in the year and had been saving it for a treat, big mistake!"
"The sweetness becomes a bit dominant as I drink the beer, and lowers drinkability a touch or two. This is a decent brew, pretty hard to find unless you are in Munich, but I'll stick with the Augustiner or Andechs. Cheers"
"This brew reminds me of Augustiner's Export offering (Edelstoff), and is a bit more complex than a typical export. It's all around a good set of suds."
"EDIT: On my trip from 6/11 this was much bolder and it had a creamy, nearly Czech like flavor. I found it to be much better this time and I had it at the same exact locale."
"Taste is full, as the aroma promises. And there's not a whole lot there besides the malts. A little bit of hops towards the finish. Aftertaste is okay. A bit metallic. Nevertheless, a good beer, and I respect the stronger alcohol content (as in I like is as much as I am wary of it). Numbing carbonation. All right overall. As others have mentioned, it's nothing ""spezial."""
"Not a grand beer to say the least, but enjoyable still."
"Average to light body, hop in the aftertaste, points of metallic."
"I brought this bottle back with me from Bavaria. Tegernsee is a beautiful brewery on a crystal clear lake. I don't know how long they have been brewing but its a long damn time. Like most Bavarian lagers this beer is perfectly balanced. I guess that comes from brewing for several hunderd years. Pours a clear yellow with a great big white head. wonderful aroma. very refreshing smooth taste. I wish someone in the US could brew a lager this good. Fantstic mouthfeel and super high drinkability make this a great drinking beer."
"Taste is light malty with some hoppiness and some bitterness. These tastes are numb and not very outspoken. The mouthfeel is a little warm and the beer tastes like a heavy pilsner. This is not very special."
"I had a liter of this (on tap of course) at the Hirschgarten beer garden in Western Munich. The beer was a crystal clear yellow color with a massive head, the way all light colored beers appear in these huge 1L mugs. It had a neutral and malty aroma and flavor, honestly a little hard to tell a difference from the Helles beers which are served in the same manner all over the city. Kind of light mouthfeel and extremely drinkable, I enjoyed it in its correct setting. Probably not something I'd reach for at home though."
"BB 20-2-06. Good white head and a golden beercollor. Nose shows lots of fresh malts, litle green hoppy nose( H. Mittelfrueh like), litle vanilla but overal almost esterfree and very clean . Taste is malty, litle alcoholic and well bittered. Good carbonisation and clean taste makes mouthfeel almost as good as a Spezial/Export can be.Great session beer but also a pleasure to just enjoy one."
