Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance of bready malt, earthy hop, and yeast ester notes; with solid strength. Taste of cracker, biscuit, honey, herbal, floral, light pepper, light pear/apple, and yeast earthiness. No bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of cracker, biscuit, honey, herbal, floral, light pepper, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Nice balance and robustness of bready malt, earthy hop, and yeast ester flavors; with zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth and lightly bready mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish.

This beer doesn't have good drinkability, it doesn't hold my interest and is way too sweet, one is more then enough for me. What I liked most about this beer was the label, it's pretty sad that the label was the best thing about this beer, but that's the truth. What I liked least about this beer was pretty much everything else, there wasn't one part of this beer that didn't have some issues and the sweetness really hurt it. I wouldn't buy this beer again, and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. This seems to be the first miss that I have had from this brewery, it just missed the mark on what a good Dortmunder should be like, and so far this is my least favorite Dortmunder I have had with Great Lakes Dortmunder gold still being my favorite, and this beer isn't even remotely as good as Great Lakes Dortmunder. I took a chance on this beer and it didn't turn out how I thought it would, oh well you can't win them all, better luck next time Thirsty Dog.","StoutHunter","Mar 02, 2012"

Pours a bright golden hue with a slightly hazed body maybe a bit of yeast left unfiltered it's like a Dortmunder/kellerbier. Aromatics offer up a liquid bread combination of malts and floral hops, I'm a fan for sure. 6% abv well hidden for a golden lager, ample hops at 22 IBUs fits the style guidelines without any issues. I love the bright white flowing head, leaves even layered lines of speckled textured lacing. Each gulp takes you into a very refreshing crisp combination of rich layered biscuit malts, a bit of honey sweetness balanced with herbal grassy German hops, not too pungent or bitter but very fresh and balanced which is key in this style of lager. Mouthfeel overall is as pleasant as it gets, and as hot as it was working outside today the beer tastes that much better. Ample natural feeling carbonation crisp inviting finish makes you want to take the next sip that much faster. Overall a highly drinkable skillfully brewed, and meant to be enjoyed in number go seek some out if your in Ohio or some of the limited distribution of this brewery.","WVbeergeek","Oct 04, 2010"
3.1,-15.8,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,2.5,"from Half Time cooler,Pours mid-yellow body with some white foamish head. Aroma is a bit of strong yeast, some malts. Middling mouthfeel. Tastes so-so,minerally, somewhat apple,grassy hops though 20 IBU, not overally drinkable.You have to be in the mood for this, maybe that's not having a beer all week and it's hot.","Sammy","Aug 21, 2010"

3.64,-1.1,4,2.5,4,4,4,"The malt profile and refreshing flavor is ideal for a hot summer day. I could enjoy this one any time of the year. It is good to see more breweries producing this style.","jkrich","Aug 08, 2010"
3.86,4.9,4,3,4,3,5,"In the end i love the style and love the beer its great for a light offering. And even better for a lager. I recommend trying this for a great lighter microbrew.","Josephkeene","Jul 27, 2010"

3.12,-15.2,4,4.5,2.5,3,2.5,"12oz bottle into a Boston Lager glass pours a crisp, very bubbly orange with a decent eggshell head that diminishes to a thin layer and leaves nice lacing on the glass. Aroma is crisp sweet malts with a Worther's Original like caramel scent to it. The taste is an overabundance of sweet malts, not quite cloying, but almost. The beer is medium bodied with decent carbonation, but the sweetness gets in the way. This is one that smell's WAY better than it tastes, not anything I would have again.","atsprings","Jul 22, 2010"

4,8.7,3.5,3.5,4,4.5,4.5,"Pours a rich, deep golden hue with a smallish off-white head. Smell is all sweet malts. First taste is like the smell - bready and sugary - but has a subtle toastiness, almost nutty, with a nice dash of hops for the bitter finish. Great feel, excellent combination of flavors without being over-the-top. I would gladly drink more than a few of these.","sixerofelixir","Dec 20, 2009"
3.23,-12.2,4,3.5,3,3.5,3,"Picked up a single from Abe's Cold Beer. Pours a clear gold amber with a short white head that leaves a bit of lacing. The malt is disappointingly plain with a mild bready cake taste and aroma. The hops do a little better and bring both floral citrus and a little grassy herb forward and long into the aftertaste. Smooth and drinkable, but unremarkable aside from some pleasant hop character.","tempest","Dec 17, 2009"
4.15,12.8,4,4,4,4.5,4.5,"Great Lakes Dortmunder Gold is the best dortmunder that has ever entered my glass. Labrador Lager isn't quite that good, but it's a surprisingly well-brewed version that I'll definitely look for again. This is a great all-rounder that is delicious solo and should accompany most foods with ridiculous ease.","BuckeyeNation","Nov 17, 2009"

2.95,-19.8,3.5,3.5,2.5,3,3,"Highly carbonated, giving it a crisp mouthfeel. I thought I had smelled the telltale signs of adjuncts. Here, I think the taste confirms it. Overall, a very dry beer. There's some bittering hop flavor in the aftertaste.","smcolw","Sep 12, 2009"
2.99,-18.8,3.5,2,3,3,4,"Notes: The second less than stellar beer out of Thirsty Dog (had their Barktoberfest recently). These were the first two Thirsty Dog beers that did not really impress me. I found there Cerebrus 10 and Siberian Night to be exemplary.","adamette","Sep 02, 2009"
4.38,19,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"This is a very crafty craft brew here. Distinguished looking, tasting. I just hope we can get this year-round.

4.69,27.4,3.5,4.5,5,5,4.5,"D- I could definitely knock over a 1/6 barrel of this stuff in a couple days. A Great offering from the boys in akrowdy. It's an agreeable beer for the lighter beer drinkers with enough flavor and complexity to please the real beer drinkers.","hustlesworth","Aug 02, 2009"
3.78,2.7,4,3.5,3.5,4,4.5,"Overall, a very solid offering from Thirsty Dog. Its not in the same league as something like Dortmunder Gold, but drinks very well and is worth the checking out. Recommended.","OldSchoolGamer","Jul 01, 2009"
