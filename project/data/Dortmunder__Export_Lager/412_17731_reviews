"M: Very refreshing and with some sensation of sweetness that is very faint but present, the bitterness is moderated as should."
"An adequate deutsche lager, but a bit crass overall, seemingly lacking any nuance."
"The label said it was 'Wurzig-Mild', can't argue with that!"
"One of the fullest bodied lagers I have had in awhile. Big fresh mouthfeel, lots of hops and a clean dry finish. This is the export style at its best ( bigger than a pils). Wonder why not many people have reviewed this but rest assured I will buy more this Spring"
"Drinks alright, typical of the style nothing special here"
"Overall a decent above average helles, it's not overly memorable, but is enjoyable nonetheless, refreshing and quenching without being offensive, that sneaky veg didn't prove to be an issue after all."
"Pretty average."
"Wouldn't look for this one again. There are better lagers available."
"Overall: although this beer is classified as a Dortmunder/Exporter I did not see much difference from any macro lager that we can find in a supermarket shelf."
"A bright golden colour with a correct head that disappears soon. Hops and floral aroma. Light bitter flavour. Palate is a light bitter, some dryness, sulphury. Clean finish. A good correct beer, very refreshing in summer, but one that you can drink at any time."
"Overall this beer was tasty enough and went down quite smooth, but it didn't have any characteristics that jumped out either, so its fairly middle of the road in the end."
"Poors a pretty standard clear gold under a healthy 1.5 finger white head with some contour and a bit of staying power. No lace. The nose is very mild, with just a touch of barley malt. The mouth is prickly and one shade heavier than light. There's a good bit of malt here, not quite sweet and very smooth. This is followed by mild metallic hops, which give the finish a bit of an edge. The bitterness lasts into the aftertaste, where the maltiness dares not return. This is an OK beer, but nothing to get excited about."
