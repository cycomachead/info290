You can, upon close inspection, see some fine white specs roiling about the beer, so it is not super filtered. Aroma is of rich, pungent, sweet & sour barley malt and a slight grass. Taste is of the same thing, with a noticeable biscuit note, across the sip. Mouthfeel is medium, and Flensburger Gold finishes crisp and refreshing. No complaints, here.

Aroma was very nice: reminded me of walking by our local regional brewery - of cooking malt and a little hops. Fresh. Flavor's the same plus some extra sweetness, heavy grain flavor with a little bread dough. Good body from all the malt. Decent carbonation. Finish is short to medium and like the flavor of eating malted grain. Not bad, but a little too much simple malt flavor for my taste.","drpimento","Jul 22, 2009"

Could have been a bit more crisp. Drinkability was good. Overall this was a decent lager. More of a novelty with its ceramic pop top. At $2.99 a bottle I will probably only buy this on rare occasions. But the bottles are keepers for home brewing.","nickynick","May 04, 2009"

Nice continental hop aroma, but very straightforward. There's a little grain, and faint faint smells in the back of the nose. The beer is soft, and a bit sweet. The sense of sweetness intensifies as the beer warms. The taste has a little fresh bread and yeast flavors as well. Medium body and relatively low carbonation. This is a nice, straightforward and satisfying beer. It's nothing extraordinary, but it's well made and enjoyable in and of itself.","Suds","Beers"

Very dry husky grain, yeasty sourness that fades midway through, a steady bitterness, and honey notes. Assertively dry and the flavor is gone almost before swallowed leaving nothing but some dry herbals in the finish. Thin watery mouthfeel with some crisp medium carbonation.

Malt is very noticeable in both smell and flavour, but has enough hops to cancel out the sweetness. Crisp and clean, but a little too much carbonation for me.
