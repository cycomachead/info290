3.15,12.9,3.5,3.5,3,3,3,"A clear golden brew that shows lots of bubble activities throughout and clinging to the sides of the chilled pint glass. The modest head is snow white but holds on reasonably and leaves similar traces of lace. The aroma offers a mild but balanced rice/wheat grain. Very clean, nothing unusual but fine for the style. The flavor brings fairly simple wheat and light malt with a rice-lemon theme and maybe even some sweet corn and a cardboard kiss. But it’s a light bodied beer with a fairly dominant carbonation that makes for a very bright, crisp feel. Very refreshing, perhaps overcarbonated and a little under-flavored. But adequate to wash down your Viet Namese chow.","Durge","May 18, 2012"

Big whiff of veggies (celery) and cooked corn up front, with a bit of spicy hop aroma in the background. A little sour too. Not much going on in the flavour department. Very low bitterness, some sweetness and fruity esters, plus the vegetal note was there from the aroma and lingered in the finish. There was a bit of spiciness from hops near the end, but that just wasn't enough to make this attractive. Light bodied, average carbonation that was a bit coarse, and none of the crispness I'd like.

Aroma is ghastly, with burnt plastic, a hint of sulfuric hops, and some corn syrup. Mouthfeel is light bodied with medium carbonation. Tastes like a lower tier, adjunct lager.

Nose is all malt, clean and fresh, the start lightly sweet and malt laden with the top cadaverous. Finish is stingingly acidic, hops sparse, and the aftertaste dry. A beer that was readily available to us Gobs while running the Mekong Delta, but still taste like I remember Bad, even 35 years ago, I did not really care for Light bodied lagers.","Gusler","Jan 04, 2003"
3.35,20.1,3,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Maybe it was the setting, a big Vietnamese buffet, but this beer was quite nice. It wasn't macro ricefest I was expecting. Reminded me of a true German Helles. Suble flavors with no harshness, no hoppiness either, but not all beers need to be superhopped. A pleasant surprise.","Scoats","Nov 25, 2002"
2.86,2.5,3.5,2.5,3,2.5,3,"A fresh bottle from the initial distributor. Clear, golden in color with a brass cast and a bright white head that holds well. It drops to a good collar but leaves no lace. The aroma is mainly of a sweet, grainy, and husky malt but there's an odd vegetal aroma as well - it's light, but noticeable. The body is thin with a very fine, crisp carbonation. The flavor is of a semi-sweet, grainy & husky malt that's fairly well backed by hop bitterness. It finishes crisp and dry with just a residual husky maltiness in the mouth. An average beer that's not really well brewed and seems slightly unbalanced. Still, it has some bitterness to it and it does have a refreshing quality. Overall, not worth looking for.","NeroFiddled","Oct 05, 2002"

1,-64.2,1,1,1,1,1,"Horribly thin and sweet. Probably close to the worst brew i've had, one of the few many that is isn't "humanly" possible to finish, i think my sink liked it though, coz it seemed to go down it pretty fast. Putrid fizzy yellow swill, very artificial.","rastaman","Aug 30, 2002"
3.46,24,4,3,3.5,4,3.5,"Notes: Well in their kind of weather would you want any other beer that you could not quaff faster than this one? Similar to every other macro beer around the world with no surprises. So if you feel inclined to try a beer from Viet Nam, go for it.","Jason","Aug 29, 2002"
2.53,-9.3,3,2.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,"33 Export, from the Nam:  Slightly dark golden lager, with a pure white head that disappears very quickly.  Very light aroma, and very light body.  Spicy hop bite, and very highly carbonated.  With the tang of hops and the tang of the bubbles, this was as lively a beer as I’ve had in a long while.  The problem was, it was like hot sauce from Taco Bell, why bother?  Might be good with bad hot food, but do not go out of your way for it.","jackndan","Aug 17, 2002"
