"Overall: Great Lakes makes some of the best lagers i have laid my lips on, and this is one of them. Super clean and crisp profile with some character unlike most lagers. I prefer Eliot Ness to this, but either would be absolutely perfect as that lawn mowing, game time, bbq, go to beer, and for turning a BMC drinker into a craft drinker"

"Golden malty goodness. Just enough hop to keep it interesting."
""

"This is a wonderful beer. Looks and smells great, and has a nice full malt taste with just enough hoppy bitterness. One of my all time favorites."
""
""
"Overall, a really tasty lager that is clean, crisp and very refreshing. Could easily drink a couple more. Excellent."

"This is by far the best lager I have ever experienced. Taste, 24 carat gold appearance, smell are all beyond compare!"

"ITS A STANDARD GO TO BEER"
""
"Love GLBC and this beer is critically acclaimed world wide, but it's just very underwhelming to me."
""
"Its a okay beer for me."
"This one is just very Clean/Refreshing and added richer Biscuit/malty character really is tasty, gets into/more like how a Lager should be like xD"
"I like it with a lime!"

"Nice foamy but quickly thinning head. Very creamy for a lager. Beautiful golden honey color. Sweet but faint aroma. Biscuity, malty sweet flavor with a mild hoppy slightly bitter finish. Very well balanced and flavorful. I'm a stout and porter guy but I liked this one very much."
""
""
""
"Overall: Quite a lot of flavor for a lager, super drinkable. I like it a lot."
""
""
""
""
"Kudos to Great Lakes for this one. As I was not a fan of their IPA's, but damn this is such a great product."
""
""
"This is a tremendous lager. Very possible that I have just found my perfect go-to beer. Very versatile and perfect all around."
"Overall, a very good lager and worth working into a constant rotation."

"Pretty good beer for Great Lakes"
""
"Overall, this was a good lager. I've had this beer several times, and don't remember it being as hoppy or having any spiciness to it. But still this was a good lager."
"o: not complex, but super enjoyable.  clean, crisp, and delicious. definitely recommend"
"A very well balanced lager.  Good color and nice lacing.  I enjoyed the overall flavor and could throw a couple of these back anytime."
"I'm no expert on this style, but this is good and enjoyable."
""
""
""
"This beer about approaches perfection"
""
"A very smooth, light and refreshing beer. Not overly hoppy or bitter."
""
""
""
""
""
"Fantastic, easy to drink beer."
""
"Perfectly balanced. Lots of hops, but not too bitter."
""
""
""
""
"Overall- A well balanced and very interesting lager. Nice complexity. Quite smooth as well. A must try! Well done by Great Lakes."
""
"O: Not my favorite lager, to be honest, but this is also not my favorite lager style. The earthen noble hops are present enough to obscure some of the other flavors for me, and the malt tones are less biscuit, more bread and grain, to me. I usually avoid this one, and the occasional revisit reinforces to me why I do."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O – Very reminiscent of a Kolsch with a bit more depth.  Bitterness compliments the malts used very well.  A fine, easy drinking lager, with good complexity."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"o: A darker and tastier than average lager, which more than holds up as it warms, eventually becoming a nice sipper."

"I don't always drink a lager, but when I do... I drink Great Lakes Dortmunder Gold.  This is a truly incredible beer. Though I try to avoid using the word ""drinkability"" I can't dodge it here. Thankfully, however, drinkability with this beer does not mean tastelessness or watered down flavor. I highly recommend this beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O- very drinkable and true to the style, I would down a couple after cutting the grass on a hot summer day."

"Everyone has beer styles that they like more or less than others.  To me, Dortmunder was an in-between kind of style that never impressed.  This beer impressed.  Great balance with smooth malty undertones, slight biscuit, subtle hop nose, light/balanced bitterness...just a delicious beer.  Plain and simple, this beer just defined this style for me."
""
"O: [3.75] This would be an excellent transition beer for BMC drinkers.  It is also an excellent lawn mower beer.  It is really easy drinking and there is no sense of the alcohol at all.  Great Lakes makes really good beers and this is no exception.  It doesn't really shine like a top 10 but it is very approachable and is an easy ""Go to"" for price, quality and taste."

"Overall: Really reminds me of CBC Summer Teeth, but slightly heavier and filtered.  remarkably low carbonation and lower bitterness leave me wanting more oomph. But outstanding retention and lacing, and a very balanced flavor make this an instant classic.  I think I still like Michelob better as my go-to pale lager."
""
"It is the best tasting beer I have ever come across.  It's like they created a brita filter for beer and it pissed out the most reliable, un-offensive beer of all time.  It's one of the greats, I just hope someone else sees it for how great it really is."

"T: Grapefruit juice and orange pith. Good spiciness featuring grainy coriander. Good amount of sulfur creates a vegetal taste that is not out of place. Sweet caramel toffee finish, but needs more malt sweetness throughout."

"Ah, Dortmunder export, one of the vague styles. This one pours out a reddish-orange colored beer with a nice large head. The heavy malt aroma doesn't really go with the style, but it does smell nice. Flavor has a strong malt presence with only slight hop bitterness. Malt is a touch grainy, though not too much. Good body and mouthfeel, which is appropriate for a strong export."

"Maybe the best of the Great Lakes offerings. I had the the Dortmunder Gold recently on tap at a seafood restaurant outside of Cleveland. Was skeptical since it had been a couple years since I had had it, but this beer is still as world class as it was before I knew what good beer was. If you grew up with Great Lakes you grew up spoiled."

" 4.5 overall. This would be a great anytime, go-to lager for craft enthusiasts or those crossing over . Pretty much any food would go well with this brew. I will certainly buy this liquid gold again!"

"Great Lakes Dortmunder Gold brewed by Great Lakes Brewing Co. This brew pours out a dark amber color with a small white head. The color of this brew is nice. There is nothing wrong with the appearance of this brew. The taste is smooth and rich at first. At the end there is a little bit of of bite. The bite is a nice finish to this brew. Great Lakes Dortmunder Gold is a good drinking brew ,no bad after tease or anything over powering. This brew is all around a good brew smooth tasting with a bite. Overall I'm giving this brew a 4.5 out of 5. I would get this brew again."

"O: A simple but awesome pilsner by an always reliable brewery. There's nothing super extravagant about this beer, but it's pegged down the basics and it's done it well. Personally, I could drink this all day it's so smooth and good. If you're wanting to get into the pilsner style, start here."
""
""
""
"O - The sweetness of this beer seems like it would pair well against something bitter, like some brussels sprouts or similar. My socks aren't exactly knocked off, but it's a solid beer that is very pleasant to drink."
"One of my favorite beers in the style. Great lakes is probably one of the best breweries in the US"

"overall i can understand why this is GLBC flagship beer. an amazing golden lager from start to finish. balanced and so super smooth. i have had this so many times and will continue to. however as amazing as it is i do like other GLBC brews more. this brew is simple, yet complex, if that makes any sense. so it appeals to more people. after all this is the very first craft brew i ever drank!"

"Fortunately I live in Lakewood Ohio which borders Cleveland's west side. The Great Lakes brewery is about 15 minutes from my house. This beer is available on tap at almost all restaurants in the area, and thank God for that. I've been honing my beer pallete for a few years now, tried many types of lagers, and this is hands down the best. There is no rival."
""
"Overall - Big fan of this one. Wish I had access to this in my area. Great example of this style."
""
"O: Amazingly sessionable, the mild but the clear flavors are immediately accessible without any offensive notes and smooth mouthfeel is simply remarkable- perfectly sippable. Perfect beer to share a few rounds with friends."
""

"Dortmunder Gold pours a hazy dark golden color with a small lacing head. There is a cheap grain like aroma. The taste has a nice strong biscuit flavor. Nice full flavors, enjoyable great body, nice feel. Overall its very good, enjoyable and has a spring like flavor."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Was not expecting this much. This is a great beer and may be my favorite lager on the market for me.This is the perfect beer for a macro to micro changeover for anybody with a friend who drinks crap BMC stuff. It is great with almost any food type and just delicious on its own. Anyone who does not like this just does not like beer, period. Perfection it a bottle."
""
"Final Thoughts: I went into this one with little to no expectations and am impressed. Maybe not a beer that would ever be in high demand, but a good example of how satisfying a lager can be. Would I drink it again? Sure."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Definitely not my favorite style but I enjoyed this one, outstanding beer."

"Overall: This is an interesting and complex lager."

""
""

""
"O: This beer and I go way back; it was my first serious foray into the world beyond yellow pisswater. I think I've actually grown a bit colder to it over time. Still, a great lager."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A really nice balance of citrusy sweetness and dry earthy flavors. A top-notch lager for sure."
""
"Overall: A great example of the style. Dare I say the ""end all"" to Dortmunders? Perhaps, it is certainly my personal favorite of the style. Recommend to any and all!"

"This is a great tasting German style lager. It has a beautiful golden appearance with minor lacing and a one finger head. The smell is malty and mildly fruity. This beer has more taste than most lagers and it lasts on your tongue. I'll be keeping this beer stocked regularly."
""
"O: Not the sexiest style, but a great representation. Great Lakes hit the spot with this puppy."
"Its very bland. Im getting very little taste out of it and its a little to dry. Not worth $12. I really expected more from Great Lakes. It kinda spoiled my taste for a Lager and Im going to move to an Ale now."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A fantastic lager. Can't believe I waited so long to try it, and I plan to drink a lot more of this in warmer weather. I am amazed by how well Great Lakes does so many different styles. I can't think of another brewery that does such different beers so well. Lagers, ales, light, dark. This one certainly upholds that reputation."
""
"Overall- A great lager to sip on any time of year, perhaps also a good one to give to those who typically ""enjoy"" their light ""beers"". I'm becoming more of a Great Lakes fan every beer I try from them."
""
"Pours a nice amber color with a light and airy white head that sticks around a while and leave excellent lacing. Smell is what you would expect of an amber lager. Taste is balanced well, but lacks complexity. The star are the barley and hops. It does have that bitter aftertaste. It's medium/light bodied and smooth. Overall well brewed lager but I can't say I must have another one."
""
""
""
"Overall: This is an excellent lager! Nicely balanced, very delicious and very refreshing. Just an excellent lager."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: had some high expectations given what I've read about this beer here, and must say I was not disappointed. It is a lager, but I do enjoy those that add some dry bitterness to the crisp start."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Almost medium bodied, medium effervescence is sharp initially but drops almost instantly. A tangy, almost metallic note remains, somewhat acidic. No knock on the beer as I bought this nearly a year ago. I'll write it off as an effect of age. For a lager, this is seriously good brew."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This was a very good beer, and I would say it lived up to the Dortmunder name. It seemed worthy to stand up to beers in a pub in Germany. The taste had a bitter edge without the grapefruit, citrus tone prominent in many American IPAs. It did not have as much depth or profundity as some Craft beers have. My call is 88 out of 100."
""
""
""
""
""
"A great lager, the perfect lager. A nice rich golden color, good tall head, but it did dissipate rather quickly. good flavor, a sweetness but not actually sweet, tasted the malt, smooth with a crispness to finish, had an almost hay flavor mixed in there. wonderful lager very impressed."
""
""
""
""
"Bright transparent gold color with small white head and a little messy lacing. Aroma has crisp bready malts with very light citrus hops. Flavor is mostly malts with a bit of hops. light and refreshing with no bitterness. Very smooth and balanced with light mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I think even six or so years after first trying this, Dortmunder Gold remains my only experience with the style. Based on how good this beer is a and the awards its won, I'm not too upset that this is the lone representative of the style for me. As advertised, it is a gorgeous gold beer that falls between a pilsner and a vienna lagger in terms of flavor profile. The taste and mouthfeel work excellently together to create a beer that is both highly drinkable, yet complex. I will undoubtedly get this again next time I am in Ohio."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- a really good interpretation of a German-style beer. Absolutely great. Not complicated but easy drinking and flavorful."
""

"RJT"
"Taste is full, toasty bread, hay (esp. in finish), strong herbal hop character, complex, zesty, engaging. Full-bodied and firm of character, it has a creamy, yet lively, full feel that retains lightness."
""
"Very good, nice taste, definitely worth repeating."
""
""
"O: This has vaulted to the top of my lager listings. I'm not well-enough versed in the style to say whether or not this is a great example, but it hits every note perfectly for me. I honestly don't get the comments I've seen in some reviews comparing this to an AAL. It is SO much more flavorful and sophisticated than anything being put out by the big three. I'm not sure why it took so long for me to get around to trying this one, given the great experience I've had with every other Great Lakes beer, but this will now become a regular fixture in my fridge. My Great Lakes winning streak continues. I've yet to have one of their beers I haven't loved."
""
""
""
"One of the lagers made in the US. Just all around tasty and well balanced."
""
""
""
"I'm not a big lager drinker and tend to buy this only when I have guests who prefer lighter styles. But every time I drink it I'm impressed. Great looking golden beer with a fairly powerful sweet malty scent. Taste is similar and complemented by a crisp mouthfeel. This is a great beer to pair with food, to serve to your Bud-drinking pals, or to guzzle down after a round of golf."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"My first dive into the craft world was surprisingly exceptional. This beer hits the palate smoothly and finishes with a mildly bitter aftertaste. It's quite crisp. It has the most desirable level of carbonation, per my tastebuds. Now, this bottle is a staple brew at my place."
"O: A clean, flavorful, balanced, extremely drinkable lager. No doubt this is something I would buy again for any occation. This would even be a great gateway beer for someone looking to get away from BMC"
""
""
""
""
"Would definitely drink again."
""
""
""
""
"Serving type: on tap at The Landing in New Hope, PA. Pint glass."
""
""
"Overall: An incredible beer, and one well worthy of the high rating on this site. That being said, if you don't like ""bitter beer", shy away from this one, since it's a bitter bomb in an entirely different way than bitter APAs or IPAs. This one almost tastes like a more bitter version of a Czech pilsner, in my opinion. Would certainly buy again."
""
""
""
"Drinkability: Easy going, true to the style, original and well made, but not differentiated enough from mass lagers to really get me excited about the beer, or about repeating often. (*liked this much better when tasted next to another german beer and in the fall.)"

"I'm not a sophisticated beer drinker and won't pretend to be, but I know what I like. I had this Dortmunder for the first time on its home turf this past week. It was smooth, balanced and refreshing. Looking forward to trying Great Lakes' other offerings."

"O: Awesome brew! Super clean and refreshing and most importantly, great balance."

"Overall- Not a big fan of this beer but good example of the style, very spicy with malt background."
""
""
""

" Terrific classic taste that does not wander all over the place , stepping outside the lines and blurring itself to a bunch of different styles. It's a lager that tastes like a lager. I love it."

"Golden orange in color with perfect clarity. Poured with a thick white foam that slowly reduced to a healthy white cap that left sticky lacing down the glass. Sweet biscuit malt aromas with a touch of earthy grass and light lemony hops in the background. Medium bodied with subdued carbonation, a delicate feel and crisp finish. Bready and biscuity malt flavors with a touch of herbal maltiness toward the end. Finishes crisply with touch of hop bitterness at the end. A wonderful, delicate German lager."
""
""
""
"O - this is pleasant and refreshing. This is top notch."
"Overall I would give it a 5 but there is only one beer that will get that score and it would be the Christmas Ale. I love Dortmunder and most all of the Great Lakes line. I would highly recommend that any beer fan give this one a try."

"Great beer. Nice color and great carbonation when poured into a pilsner glass. Wonderful aroma. The best part however is the taste and mouthfeel. A very malty pilsner with a lingering bite on the back end, very dry. A perfectly balanced beer. My favorite beer from my favorite style. Really hit the nail on the head, the best Great Lakes has to offer!"

"I've yet to have a beer from Great Lakes that I've been truly disappointed in. I wasn't overly impressed with Lake Erie Monster, but it still trumps a LOT of other beers that I've had. This is just a great beer, and would be a good choice to get somebody's feet wet into the world of craft beer. It has a nice sweetness, isn't at all off-putting, and has just enough hop flavor and subtle bitterness to let a newbie know what's to come in the future if they keep drinking craft."
"Remarks: Did not score A, T, S, M at that time; disregard those scores"
"Overall - a well crafted lager, nicely balanced and highly enjoyable."
""
""
""
"Overall: All the qualities of this beer come together perfectly as a team to form a balance that's extremely hard to find. For a beer that is almost completely naked and doesn't hide behind any dominant flavors from hops, malt or yeast it shows very few worts, if any. A great interpretation of a classic from maybe the best lager brewers in America."

"Awesome brew."
"Great beer. In Europe you can hardly find Dortmund style beer (or Munich style for that sake) anymore. This beer was very good - nice foam, lot of taste, but not too bitter. Bitterness is of course a matter of preference. Munich style is more bitter and other end of the scale is Paulaner Pilsner. I love this beer."

"Thankfully, the alcohol was spot-on but I wish this had a bit more hops here or some wheat to fill this out a bit. While this wasn't an empty-feeling taste, this wasn't what I was accustomed too and it was a bit darker than the average lager in a few ways. It's probably me, as there are so few examples of this style on the shelf these days but on its own, this is an enjoyable beer that deserves a wider audience, since it's quite enjoyable and likely to not offend anyone."

"12 ounce bottle into lager glass, best before 5/8/2013. Pours lightly hazy golden amber color with a 1-2 finger dense white head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of pear, apple, grape, pepper, floral, grass, bread, cracker, honey, and herbal earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance of hop, malt, and moderate ester notes; with good strength. Taste of bread, toast, cracker, pear, apple, pepper, floral, grass, light honey, and herbal earthiness. Lingering notes of light fruits, bread, toast, pepper, floral, honey, and herbal earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Fantastic balance of bready malt and spicy hop flavors; with light-moderate fruity ester notes and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth and crisp mouthfeel that is very nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming after the finish. Overall this is a highly excellent Dortmunder as expected. Great balance of hop and malt flavor; extremely smooth and crisp to drink. A highly enjoyable offering."
""

"Pours a clear, crisp, polished bronzy prismatic beauty! A real looker! Fine foamy and prominent lacing throughout with large oceans of clear glass. Smells bready, earthy, hidden, sweet notes. A great, fine smeller, some pine notes too, fine, hidden. Tastes lager all the way...a rich, malty, cleansing, fizzy, foamy, slick drink with a good high note and the finest piney hoppiness that lingers like a mild IPA. Bolder for the style, for sure. You'll drink this fast. I like this one. I'd heft six for sure. A buy again."

"This is perhaps the best of this style that I've ever had. The smell and taste is nice honey, but the taste presents that familiar biscuit goodness. The spritzy carbonation almost burns the tongue (obviously not burns, but a strong tingle). This is excellent. I would probably get this again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The hops mixed well with the malt, added a slight dryness to the beer, but not to much since it still had a refreshing mouthfeel."
""
"Great Lakes has done a good job with an admittedly boring style. I've not met a Helles or Dortmunder that really interested me all that much, but if I had to pick one, this would be on my short list."
""
"Clean tasting with a buttery rich character up front, toasted bread character. Faint hop character tries to come through the malt but doesn't incredibly and instead clashes with the malt flavors in an off way. Finishes with a lingering toasty and bitter flavor. Drinkable but not crazy about it. Perhaps if it was a touch hoppier it might work a bit better for me but overall pretty nice toasty lager."
"Overall, when i saw this beer the appearance was very nice with a Gold/Brown Appearance. The aroma was a little grainy and bready with a tad bit of bitterness to it. The mouthfeel was very heavy in my opinion and it tasted very thick and bitter. Overall i thought it was average."
""

"I'm not a huge lager fan, more into APAs, IPAs but this is probably the best that I have tasted. Most lagers are too grainy and biscuity with no hops but the hop profile is more pronounced and has a nice sweetness to it as well. The aroma is outstanding for this type. I'll be keeping this on hand for summers."
""
""
""
"O - Lagers just dont do it for me. As lagers go, this one is good, but I just dont like it. I know that ratings are supposed to be based on the style, based on that, this rating should be rated higher. However, I cant depart from the ultimate arbiter of the rating being, would I order this again, and I just wouldnt. A reflection of my personal taste, not any knock on the beer."
""
""
""
"Overall: This one doesn't do it for me. I expect a lot from Great Lakes and this one let me down a little. but hey not all year rounds can be above a 4. still nice and drinkable but much better offerings from great lakes."

"Head was good and foamy, decent lacing all the way down. The color was oaky burnt orange, with an old wood smell. The taste was crisp, which to me was very surprising for a Lager. Nonetheless, by the end of my time, and fifth one, I had the whole group drinking this brew. Good times, definitely a recommend, am gonna try to procure some for my journey back to Texas before I leave."

"A right tasty little number from Great Lakes Brewing Company. Well-balanced and nice complexity of ingredients make this a flavorful without being overpowering. I need to see about getting my relatives in Ohio to periodically ship some to me in the future..."

"Overall/Comments: Finally reviewing this after having many many times. Excellent in every aspect from. Great flavor, aroma, presentation, and mouth feel. Classified as Dortmunder/Export Lager at 5.8% ABV. Consumed 12-27-12."

"Overall- Very well balanced, hoppy overtones with very subtle sweetness that allows for a wellbodied dortmunder. I would reccomend this beer for anyone who is trying to experience the classical Great Lakes style with the very traditional German Dortmunder style beer."
"More good stuff from Great Lakes."
"O - I really enjoy how Great Lakes can make solid representations of basic styles. I would take this over plenty of comparable German imports. Just need to make another trip upstate to get this."

"Great Lakes Dortmunder Gold ----3/5"

"Overall although not a beer I would normally turn to, this is always one I have thought is amazing. Would highly recommend it to anyone getting started in craft beer as well as the older generation."

""

"Without a doubt one of the best lagers I have had from any brewery. A treat to drink, and something that should be shared with anybody that thinks lagers are inferior in any way. One of my favorites."
"Overall, one of the greatest lagers I've had to date."
"Overall: A good beer. Not one I will hunt out Great Lakes for, but will gladly purchase if easily available."
"Overall: Great Lakes has wowed me again. This might be the best lager I’ve ever had. Drinkability is outstanding as well, but without sacrificing a rich, full flavor of great bready malt and clean hop balance."
"O: This beer is different than any I've had before. Light, interesting, and refreshing."
""
"Overall this is an interesting lager. I don't believe that I have ever had this style of lager before, but I enjoyed it. The beer is light and refreshing yet different in it's own right. Great job by a great brewery."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Notes- I fist tried the beer about 4 years ago and it was my first taste of craft beers and to be honest I couldn't stand it and I haven't tried it since but on my trip to the drive thru to pick up Great Lakes Oktoberfest and this this was all they had so I bought it jut to see how my taste had changed. I have to say I am very pleased that I did. I can't believe that I have waited four years to try this beer again. It taught me that just because you didn't like something the first time it doesn't mean its not worth giving it another shot."
""
""
""
""
""
"A terrific beer, and an appropriate flagship for an amazing brewery! Cheers!"
""
""
""
""
"Beautiful gold color, though little head on the pour. Smells almost champagne-y with a hint of fruit and always reminds me of sitting in Great Lakes Brewery itself. Smooth with a good mix of grain and malt taste. Almost tastes buttery, like a fresh biscuit or muffin. In the mouth it is ridiculously smooth and crisp, with a lingering sweet grain taste that is wonderful. One of the first beers I ever had and still one of my favorites. Possibly influenced by the first beer thing, but is pretty much what a beer should be in my head."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"EDIT: had again recently, still had a cheesy aroma, though not as strong, and this time, not accompanied by the sulfuric character, either. Much more enjoyable this time around, although I still didn't fall in love with this beer. If I want a Great Lakes lager, I'd still reach for an Eliot Ness."
"Overall this is a very strong beer, I would definitely pick it up if it were distributed to my area."
"O: I'm not too well versed at Dortmunder Lagers, but I must say while they resemble a wimpy macro appearance they also deliver a solid micro flavor. It's not something I'll go out of my way to get my hands on, but certainly not something I would turn down."
""
"Overall (3.5): This is my first experience with dortmunder, so I don't have much to compare it to (though I should hope to be trying Ayinger's soon). This was my last bottle in a six-pack that I've drank through the last couple of days, waiting for this one before I reviewed it."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall a superb example of the style and the perfect session beer for a nice hot summer day or any day for that matter. Great Lakes is exceptional at crafting great sessionable ales that is for sure."
"Malty, well hopped, and incredibly smooth - a superior German-style lager. Rating to style, this is among the best, and pairs well with the pierogi I picked up at the West Side market just down the street from the brewery."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a really top-notch lager. This is a really great example that other brewers should follow. Not enough craft brewed lagers on the market. A great brew from Great Lakes."
""
""
"Clear gold with a dense cap of ivory head. Aromas of crisp, doughy malt, lightly toasted malt, and herbal hops. Taste is similar to the nose. The hops impart a nice bitterness, resulting in a nicely balanced and quaffable brew. Mouthfeel is smooth and crisp, with a medium-thin body and good carbonation. Such a great, drinkable, no-frills beer!"
""
"nice clear copper body with a fingers worth of white frothy head. has a crackery and biscuit forward malt profile. hints of grapefruit and pine hops on the nose. Taste is crisp crackerey malts with a hop bite to even things out a bit. Mouthfeel is crisp and clean with great carbonation level. A touch of bitterness from the hops and a little dry on the finish, reminds me of eating plain non salted satlines. overall a very refreshing beer any time of day or year."

"Overall, this beer is a winner. Try it today!!!"

"Had in the Cleveland airport on draft during layover. Scared to death I'd miss connector, so I had only on Great Lakes beer. Dortmunder was very clear, light amber beer with good head. nice yeasty smell. Very drinkable beer. Good balance, soft buttering, fairly clean finish. I hate I could only have one. Really wanted the Edmund Fitzgerald too. Maybe next time."
""
"Not the most complex beer out there, but still has plenty of flavor. Very drinkable, the sweet malt and bitter hops are nicely balanced, nothing dominates, making for a nice easy to drink beer."

""
""
""
""
""
""
"12oz bottle, pours golden with good clarity, some particulates suspended. Frothy white head holds good retention and leaves good lacing on the glass. Aromas are lager yeast, biscuit, grassy hops. Tastes are crisp and clean, biscuity, somewhat bready, grassy hop, straw, slight tartness on the finish. Mouth-feel is smooth and finishes exceptionally clean, while being lighter bodied. Overall, I love going back to this one time and time again. It's among the best in its style."
""
""
""
"O: An excellent beer by Great Lakes. I'm getting into this brewery's beers more & more and this one is a fine reason why."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"D: High drinkability, but only if you like the style. I find it a bit unbalanced, but in the right (Germany) mood, I'm sure this would hit the spot completely."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall – Crisp, flavorful, and easy drinking. A nice lager to go to again and again."
"Taste-Bready pilsner malt, crisp. Soft, subtle, floral hop bite, faint mineral note. Very well-balanced with lots of understated character. A perfect ""entry-level"" brew for those who want to get their feet wet on craft brews, without jumping into unfamiliar territory."
""
""
""
""
"The body is excellent, at least medium. It manages to be refreshing and substantial at the same time. Overall it's decent, but I find the grape character takes away from what might otherwise be a very good malt-forward beer. The mouthfeel keeps this one alive. Not bad, but definitely not one of my favorites from this outstanding brewery."
""
"This beer is similar to New Glarus's Naked in that it somehow magically manages to make a very simple and stripped down beer shine via fine-tuned balance and control of each element."
""
"Pours a bubbly, crisp, dark golden color with an inch foamy, off-white head which remains throughout. Fair amount of lacing left on the glass. The excellent smell is slightly sweet, malty with heavy hints of hops & bread, and a slight touch of citrus/fruit. The taste is excellent as well -- basically a perfect combination of crisp refreshment with solid taste and body. The finish is a little dry, but I'd consider this a really solid session beer."
""
"Taste is malty up front, with grains, hops, and yeast coming in very well-balanced and quite enjoyable. Superb!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Mouthfeel is very good- medium light body, light soft carbonation. This is a very nice beer but I'm not wild about. Very drinkable though and worth trying."
""
""
"Had this at the Cleveland airport waiting on my plane for home. Pours a rich, transparent amber color with a decent-sized head. Aroma is pleasantly maltly with just a touch of citrus. Lacing rimmed the glass with every sip. Really nice carbonation. Flavor is very malty with just hint of the herbal and citrsy hops. This combination makes for an incredibly balanced and highly drinkable brew. Hops flavor is clean and appropriately present. Extremely well crafted lager. I am impressed. Just wish they sold it in SC."
""
"O - Good lager, but I'd prefer several others over this."
""
""
""
""
"overall - this is a really good lager, this is the epitome of a gateway beer and good to have on those hot days when I'm in the mood for a refreshing brew"
""
""
"on tap at hard times in Arlington VA. Pours a dark copper color with a very attractive white head. smell is quite mild...but the taste is so refreshing. great malty and bready flavor with a distinctly pleasant aftertaste makes this one a keeper. overall can't see anyone not liking this brew."
""
""
""
"Medium bodied with very lively carbonation and a supremely crisp overall feel. A really fine, highly refreshing lager. Goes down too easy."
"( 4.5 / 45)"
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Nothing to crazy here, but it probably appropriate for the Dortmunder beer style. This is only my second beer sampled from this style. Hoptonius Union was the first and that beer was outstanding. This beer is probably truer to style. It a german lager no doubt. It reminds me of New Glarus Cabin Fever."
""
""
""
"Poured in downtown Columbus,OH at the end of the night. My first try of this style and I am impressed. Clear golden color with lots of bubbles coming from the bottom, and a massive white fluffy head on top. Aroma is hay, pale malts, dry and lightly sweet. Floral flavor, ever so slight sweetness, with a bit of bitterness on the tongue that allows this lager to finish cleaner than any other I have had. Very light bodied with high carbonation. Awesome beer and incredibly drinkable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a golden amber, bright white head with fine bubbles, good lacing. Scent of bread, light citrus, and granny smith apple. Taste is much the same, nice hop balance, with a very clean aftertaste. An interesting brew as its not quite a pilsner and not quite a lager. Thick mouthfeel for the style. A solid beer especially for the style, though not as good as the ratings suggest"
""
""
""
""
"I wish I had a fresher bottle to review. This is perhaps a placeholder review to be amended in the future... or maybe, this beer doesn't go downhill so quickly. As always, time will tell."
""
"O - Very good for the style, but I wouldn't drink this often only because I don't care for for the pilz/lager hybrid"
"Overall: a very good Dortmunder. A tiny bit biscuity for my taste, but overall quite enjoyable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: My first D/E lager, really nice, similar to Sam Adams BL (Vienna lager) though I imagine the two styles blur the lines"
""
""
""
""
"O: More proof that Great Lakes makes solid lagers. This has a fantastic bread character that really sets it apart from other average lagers. Personally, I wish it was a little drier, buy why nitpick? I'd gladly drink this over and over again."

"After hearing much praise for this brewery, I'm happy to have it available in my state (in the grocery store no less). This one pours a sparkling orange gold color, with a modest but respectable off-white head. The aroma is mild but pleasant, with light lemony and earthy hop characteristics being only slightly sweetened by a very subtle dry bready malt presence. The malt contribution is much bigger in the flavor, with a dry bready/biscuity character complementing a musty, grassy, dull bitterness. The texture likewise complements the flavors, with a crisp, prickly carbonation helping to blend everything into one drinkable yet satisfying package."
""
"Overall: A solid brew but nothing really stands out or is particularly memorable. I reviewed the last of my six-pack and felt pretty much the same on this one as the others."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Much more enjoyable than all the American macro lagers but it still is what it is, a light lager. So by default, not very interesting. Easy drinking though."
""
"O: This is an outstanding beer that is wonderfully balanced and very satisfying. The armoma is amazing where the first whiff lets you know your in for a real treat with a well crafted beer. I'm totally lacking in my ability to describe what going on beyond those two primary notes of malts and hops in the aroma and flavor but it's pure magic."

"O: Excellent lager here. Flavorful and relatively complex while maintaining a light and refreshing mouthfeel. Great Lakes continues to churn out some of the best lagers in craft beer. Great work."
"Pours a nice golden hue with a tinge of amber. Nice creamy head just a tad off-white that holds the side of the glass. Smells strongly of traditional German pilsner hops but are actually from America (Cascade, Hallertau). Also pick up some hints of some herbage, like coriander or clove. Tastes dry with a tinge of honey towards the end. Like a nice mix between a pilsner and a cream ale. A tad bitter on the finish, though not unpleasant. One of my favorites. Perfect for sipping on a summer evening."
"o - Overall I thought this was a great, easy to drink beer. I haven't had many Dortmunder's, but this is definitely the best one I've had so far. Very nice look and mouthfeel, and a beer you could certainly have a few of. Glad to see this hitting NoVa, looking forward to having more of this one."
""
""
""
"My highest recommendation."
""
"O - This is a fantastic lager. It's inviting, simple, and delicious. I'm not surprised to see this is the highest rated of the style. Highly recommended, and I really look forward to having this again."
""
""
"Overall: Wow. Not my normal style of beer, but one I will definitely pick up again. Tasty, clean, drinkable-- begs you to have another."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: While 5.8% isn't that high, I wouldn't exactly call this a ""session"" beer, but it is definitely one that I could pop several of around the pool. Fantastic!"

""
"This is a nice, easy drinking beer that brings flavor that most lagers don't. It offers a nice balanced malt/hop character. I will have this again in the future."

"Dortmunder Gold - The bottle says: “Our Dortmunder Gold is a consistent gold medalist and a balanced golden lager (do you see a pattern forming?). In the Middle Ages, this style brewed in Germany was so popular it required armed escorts when exported to surrounding towns. As you can see, this beer was and still is as good as gold.”"

"O: Tasty. Not the most attractive, but very tasty."
""
"Pours a rich, transparent amber color with a decent-sized head. Lacing is persistent, with attractive reticulation. Aroma is pleasantly wheaty, if unremarkable. Really digging the perky carbonation. Flavor is as suggested on the label: not as dry as a Pilsner, though less malty than a traditional lager. This combination makes for an incredibly balanced and highly drinkable brew. Hops flavor is clean and appropriately present. I'm not much of a lager man, especially lighter lagers, but there's no denying this beer is well crafted and a worthy champion of its style."
""
""
"Overall, this is a bold, rather heavy take on the style. The ABV and body are definitely close to the biggest you will find in a Dort. In spite of this, Great Lakes kept the great drinkability and balanced flavors that are necessary in a beer of this style. It is no wonder this beer is a Cleveland favorite."
""
""

"Mouthfeel: My palate was expecting this beer to be a lot thinner than it is but I am finding it to be a smooth easy drinking session beer that has great taste to back up the gold medals that it has received."

"O: Such a great drinking beer and goes down with incredible ease."
"I'm embarrassed to say that I did not even know that the Dortmunder/Export Lager existed before attempting to review this beer. Assuming this is a good representation of the style, I may have to seek out some more. It's pretty interesting. Not my favorite, but it's worth a try."

"One of my favorite hometown brews. It is a smooth lager that has balanced hops and malts. I dont catch much of an aftertaste but enjoy the mouthful. Coming in at a 5.8 alcohol percentage, you definitely get your bang for your buck with this beer. If your not looking for a cheap beer and want something at a reasonable cost I'd recommend something from my hometown, Dortmunder Gold."

"The #3 this Christmas is the Dortmunder Gold...part of a mix pack given to me from my in-laws!!!! Finally something that they are good for...(JK!). The beer pours a very nice rich golden clear color with very thin white head that is lacing. The smell includes grain, lemon grass, and hops. The taste is a slightly sweeter than most dortmunders, but includes many of flavors that the smell contains. The mouthfeel is a nice medium body, with weak carbonation. Overall it is a very good beer and is highly recommended."

"This beer poured out as a nice clear looking golden color with a fizzy white head on top. The smell of the beer was much like any other lager out there, it had some grassy notes along with some grainy malts aromas. The taste of the beer had a good amount of hops in there which I liked, the taste was pretty well balanced without having too much of a pilsner like flavor to it. The mouthfeel of the beer was pretty good too, it had a solid crisp bit at the end too. Overall it's a good lager, very traditional in style but remains to be very good."

"Overall, this is pretty much the perfect Dortmunder, in my opinion."
"a really light beer for great lakes. smells german malty and crisp. taste is awesome for the style, simple and balanced. prilarily malt driven beer but nice hop additions which show up in the crisp bitterish finish. a wonderful beer at 4pm after an 8 hour day of construction work. in australia we called easy drinking beers like this ""throwies", because you can throw down a whole mess of them in a hurry. drinkability through the roof, supremely refreshing. when the time is right for this beer its just perfect"

"O- I bought a variety pack and was least interested in this one because I dont tend to favor this style. But this is an excellent beer, i'm very pleased and will probably get this again."
"O-this ia another damn fine beer from GLBC"

"Overall: A very respectable lager. Nice balance of malt and hops. Refreshing and insanely drinkable. I'll definitely be picking more of this up come summer time."

"O: Interesting lager, hard to describe but I tried my best. Very unique I think."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: a really nice lager, generally i find the style to be weak and boring but this one had nice light notes with a good quality to it, greatly drinkable"

"This is a great example of what lagers should be: full of grainy, balanced flavor with low esters and no diactyl. This beer showcases its ingredients and does a lot with a little."

"12oz bottle (thanks to Mikeg67). Pours a nice clear amber with medium white head. Aroma is yeasty, malt, some citrusy hops with nice light fruity note, pears. Taste is fruity like pears, yeasty with some light spicy citrusy hops. Palate is a nice crisp medium body with good carbonation. Finish is sweet maltiness, yeasty with some nice fruity notes ending with some nice sweet spicy hops for balance. This is my first Dortmunder style so overall a very nice and drinkable brew"

"Pours a vibrant golden color with a fingers width of white head. Smells of earthy, floral hops. Taste is hop forward, citrusy and sweet with a slight bitterness. A bit floral also lingering in the aftertaste. A little drying as well. One of the better lagers ive had. This is very well done.. Great Lakes never fails me."
"A very good lager by Great Lakes, which has never failed to impress me with their brews. Definitely worth a try if you enjoy lagers."
"No doubt that this is a well-balanced, well-crafted beer, suits the style to the 't'. An archetype certainly. Yet, it doesn't get me terribly excited, was expecting a bit more given the rave reviews of this one."
"12 oz bottle. Pours bronze with a foamy, long lasting, white head and a lot of lacing. Biscuit malt aroma is balanced by perfume hops and tropical fruit. Medium, slightly crisp body. Biscuit malt and spicy, herbal hops fill the mouth. Some DMS come through. Long, bitter finish. Good brew, but too much DMS makes me take off some points."
"Overall, this is one of the most robust and full-flavoured lagers that I've sampled. It has amazing depth with very high drinkability. A true gem of a beer, and one that I would purchase often if it was available locally. You have to try this brew."
"Pours a bright, clear amber and has a light biscuity smell. This is a classic clean lager--biscuit malts, some earthiness, a good hop balance, some lemon zest, perfectly medium-bodied carbonation, very smooth going down. My local grocery store has this, so I'm going to have to start stocking it in our fridge more often--it goes with everything and never gets old."
"A very tasty lager, good to drink a cold and refreshing beer that is of good quality."
"O - This is a lager to write home about! Despite many unique characteristics, it still manages to focus on being a well balanced, thoroughly flavorful, brew."
"Overall: this beer is great for any occasion. It is light and crisp but is still packed with flavor. As far as lagers go, this is one of my favorites."
"D= Off the charts drinkable with a great (and authentic) flavor to match. World class and highly recommended!"
"A fabulous German style lager, that I would seek out again."
"O- I'm honeslty disappointed right now, after reading the reviews I was expecting a great beer but this is rather boring to me. Always nice to try new things though"
"Forgot how much I loved this beer. Definitely one of the greats."
"O: I’m usually not a lager drinker, but this brewery is awesome and this beer did not disappoint. It was very well balanced and complex. Easily drinkable and very enjoyable all around."
"O: Shockingly good! Easily the best lager I've ever encountered. Super-drinkable and highly recommended. Delicious."
"Orange gold color. Medium white chunky head. Aroma is malty, fruity and sweet. A medium bodied helles. Malts are fruity and sweet. Hops are slightly spicy and a touch bitter. Hints of orange and honey. Nicely balanced. Light and refreshing, yet very flavorful. Nice beer. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly sweet."
"Harsh to say, but really tastes like a bigger, more bitter American macro lager to me. A bit of a disappointment given how beautiful it was in the glass."
"I have tasted most domestic and european lagers and this is by far the best lager I've experienced! Do yourself a favor...go out and buy as much Dortmunder Gold as you can find! I pick up at least a case ever time I'm in Ohio! Its harder to come by in PA. Great Great Great Beer!"
"Now this is a flagship beer (but we all know GL has a fleet). My go-to beer, and it should be yours as well."
"Overall: A very solid take on a German lager by Great Lakes. Nice malt/hop balance and good subtle notes of fruit."
"Overall: A nice solid, drinkable lager that is very good for the style. I could have a couple of these, yet I like it more in the style than as an overall beer. Good for the summer, but nothing I will go out of my way for."
"Overall- quite wonderful. Without a doubt, I will get again. Highly recommended for those who aren't too snobby to enjoy a nice Red Stripe or Gosser or Heineken. Superbly done."
"A very drinkable German-style lager. Overseas deployment and hockey stories go well with it."
"O- A pleasant easy drinking lager. Nice solid, body and plenty of flavor."
"This is probably one of my favorite lagers overall. Very crisp and clean and easy to drink. Everything is well balanced. I'm sure I will enjoy many more Dortmunder Golds in the coming days."
"Overall, Great Lakes Dortmunder Gold is a flavorful and very drinkable lager."
"Mouthfeel and overall - Consistently smooth. Medium bodied and fresh. I love this beer, even when i overpay for the bottled version at Cavs games."
"Overall, an exceedingly drinkable lager, worthy of the German heritage it alludes to in its name. A solid example of the style, especially for something brewed this side of the Atlantic."
"Overall: Very drinkable! Nice and sweet at the start, finishes slightly dry and bitter. The aftertaste is mostly dry, but some malt sweetness lingers."
"This beer is great! Deep golden brown body, thick head, malty aroma. Tastes pretty sweet and malty with just a kiss of hops. Crisp feel, easy going down. I definitely wanted another!"
"Overall: The critics don't lie - this is a good one. I've been enjoying my tour of highly-rated domestic craft lagers, and GLDG doesn't disappoint!"
"This is a light bodied beer that is crisp and delicious. It is slightly dry and not very sticky."
"O: good beer, a bit less sweet than I initially anticipated."
"O: Dortmunder Gold is a well-tuned beer and brings very good drinkability. Great Lakes is a brewery that tends to brew to style better than most, so I assume Dortmunder Gold is no different. I need to explore this style. "
"Pours a deep golden color, white bubbly foam forms and has good staying power. Aroma is full of bready, biscuity malt and a light floral hopping. In the taste, clean lager flavor, crisp, somewhat malty and biscuity and finishes nice and even with leafy bitterness. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied with a crisp drying finish. Overall, I found this to be a pretty good lager. True to style, I can see why lagers of this quality were prized back in the day."
"Taste - A nice reversal of the aroma; the flavour is nicely bready, but with more hops than malt. Biscuit flavours back up floral and herbal hops with a refreshing dry finish."
"O) Why have I waited so long to try this beer??? I picked this up as a single in a mixer I put together. This is a no doubt slam-dunk six pack purchase next time."
"Overall: Emminently drinkable. Very smooth going down. A fine example of a lager."
"A solid beer. Certainly one of the better German style lagers brewed in the United States."
"O=Alright, but not one I will purchase again."
"O - A very good summer beer and one that I would order again without hesitation."
"O - Nothing but great from GLBC. Check out the gold medals on their site. It basically speaks for itself. Putting a gold medal as the main label of a brew is a bold statement. But Dortmunder Gold has earned it's gold. It's proven and delicious. One of the best all around lagers in the world. Gold is not just a way of describing the color of this brew, but a way of describing its character and class. Nothing overly brilliant. Just a damn good tasting beer anyone can enjoy. It's a blue collar lager that still has a place in the world of beer. Must try"
"Poured into a pint a nice golden yellow with a tinge or orange, with a bright one finger head that disapated rather quickly. Smell is buscuity sweet malt and a hint of some piney hops. Taste is crisp malt crackers some pepper and grassy piney hops. Mouthfeel is thin but well balanced for its style. Overall a very enjoyable and tastey lager that had more than refreshing to offer!"
"You win this round, Great Lakes. Your gold medal label is fully justified. Just a stellar lager, loads of fun to drink, that is complex enough to satisfy the most discerning beer geek, but accessible enough that it could be used to bring those who normally avoid craft beer to the fold."
"Great example of the brewer's art and absolutely delicious. Wish I had this at home for everyday quaffing."
"D: very drinkable dort. slightly more on the hop side, but still a great example of the style. another solid brew from great lakes."
"Pours a faintly hazed copper tinted gold, cap of creamy off-white head. Scent is of freshly dried and malted grain with a kiss of flowers and citrus zest. Taste begins with a lightly sweet, freshly dried and malted grain backed by a light kick of bitterness before ending with floral and citrus notes. Medium bodied, smooth, lightly creamy. A very nice beer, great freshness to the taste without being overly sweet."
"O: Goes down easy, tasty, mild kick, not too filling, and nice representation of style. This is easily a beer to sit with for an evening."
"This was my first try with Great Lakes. And what a way to start off. This beer is great! It has good taste with a light to medium body.It's a beer I could drink a lot of on a hot day. It pours a golden color with a 1-2 finger white head. The head disapears pretty quick."
"Cheers!"
"This was a great beer. It has a nice clean malt taste to it that is balanced by a slight hop bitterness. Would definitely by buying again."
"O: This was a nice intro to Great Lakes. It has the soul of a bigger brew, but I feel like it’s trapped in the style’s smaller body. Good experience, though. I’ll definitely be looking for some other GL offerings while I’m in the area."
"D-Overall i was pleased with this lager and i think its a beer that could ease BMC drinkers into the craft beer scence. I would def. pick this up for friends of mine."
"Color is goldish amber. 1/2"" white head fades rather quickly leaving a ring behind. Aroma is lightly sweet, bready, and a little citrusy. Refreshing. Taste is sweet also, lightly bitter, and somewhat fruity. Mouthfeel is good. Slick, smooth, and medium carbonation. Overall, I am enjoying this beer. I'm sucking it down pretty fast."
"Clear gold color with a thick white head that drops to a thin covering, leaving wispy strings of lace on the glass. Clean, mild floral hop and bready malt aromas. Moderately sweet, crisp and balanced flavor...grassy hops, light citrusy fruit, pale malt. Medium bodied and quite resfreshing. A nice lager overall..."
"Overall, a very nice beer. It's well-balanced and while things stick out a bit at times, it's more like a dance that carries it through interesting twists and turns, never off balance but rather tilted in one direction at one time and the other direction just a touch later. Interesting and yummy."
"This one pours a great looking golden color with huge amounts of visible carbonation. This probably has something to do with the excellent head retention. Aroma has plenty of bready/nutty malts, along with a fair level of herbal bittering. The taste is quite good, it goes on crisp, with a bit of floral hops in the middle. The nuttiness of the malts really starts to come out on the finish. The mouthfeel is nice, it's fairly thick for a lager, but feels good going down. The drinkability is superb. Overall, this is a great lager that'd be a staple in my fridge if I lived in the area. I'm not going to go crazy not being able to get it though."
"O: Really impressed with this beer. Incredibly easy drinking with a clean flavor profile."
"The only catch is that the price of a 6 pack of Great Lakes is not really much different than most German Lagers such as Spaten, Warsteiner, etc. so I'm thinking the major reason to buy this over those would be the freshness of the beer. If the price difference were two bucks a sixer less I would make this beer one of my default Lagers for sure."
"There is nothing wrong with the mouthfeel here. Light-medium-bodied for a lager with plenty of carbonation. Overall, this is an excellent Dortmunder Lager. This beer is just plain delicious. If I could buy it where I lived I would use it to convert BMC drinkers over to the side of craft beer."
"I bought this bottle a couple days ago from Party Source in Newport, Kentucky. It pours light bodied and a bold gold in color with a light white lacing around the glass. It is very clear and has nice color. It smells of pale malts, light yeast, light breadiness, and grains with light spices. The flavors begin with a dry lightly fruity, almost pilsner esque sweetness. The biscuity malts are prevalent and pair nicely with the citrus flavor that is also presented. It finishes pretty dry. This drinks light and body and is pretty smooth. It coats the palate and leaves a moderate biscuit flavor behind. Overall it's a pretty good Dortmunder. It's one of the better ones out there so it's worth a try."
"Very solid, truly in between a helles and a pilsner, very drinkable."
"I poured this beer into a perfect pint glass, it has a nice 2 inch fizzy white head that lays down to a nice lace around its golden color body. The smell is nice and malty with a hint of citrus. My taste buds get a sweet malty taste on the first part then a hop and bitterness on the back end of it. The mouth feel is nice with a little of a after taste. Over all i like this beer and would definitely drink it again."
"Overall: A good beer from a solid brewery."
"All in all, a simple beer, and one of the best low/moderate ABV lagers I've had. Would be a nice introductory craft beer for the uninitiated, but there was nothing about this that makes me want to have it again. Kinda tastes like high-class BMC."
"Beautiful golden amber color. Generous head and lacing. Smells of bread and biscuit...malty, fresh yeasty dough. Tastes medium bodied, smooth and crisp. A touch of bitterness. Nice and light, yet satisfying. Very drinkable and enjoyable. A darn nice lager. Not my favorite style, but would definitely buy again for a change of pace!"
"I've only ever had a few beers of this style and hate to pass judgment on this one. I really enjoyed it and would probably buy it again, but I would like to sample a few others of this style first."
"O:This is a great beer without question. It has a great taste, color and feel. It lacks just a bit in the smell but it still makes a great beer to sit back and enjoy"
"It is no secret that I don’t like lagers, but I do love Great Lakes. I do have a bias, but I feel like they are incapable of disappointing. This beer pours a beautiful golden orange, with a lot of chunky head, great lacing, and great retention. The smell is sweet and malty. This beer definitely gives you that thin bodied bitter feel that makes lagers suck, but adds a nice hint of maple…or honey? The malt complexity is nice, and gives a little bit of a bready taste…but it doesn’t come on as strong as some other German styles. There is a crisp bitterness, but I wouldn’t say that the hops are over-done. This is a Great beer, I will come back to this one."
"O- I drove from Beaumont, TX to Arcadia, Michigan looking for this and the Edmunds Fitzgerald. Only found this. I was at GABF and saw it win the gold medal. This is a very good beer and very true to style. Highly Recommended."
"This is my favorite beer by Great Lakes. Really very good."
"Overall not something I would track down again but a great addition to the variety case. Good lager."
"Served this Dortmunder from a bottle,pouredthis golden beauty into a glass and it had an inch of head followed with a nice white lacing.Ha that reminds of a song. Anyhoo the smell is good w/ a hint of apple cinnamon so I'm told.The TASTE is slighty bitter and bready but refreshing with no hints of fruit.THe after taste is kinda dry.I'll have to try this one on tap sometime.Overall its good tasting beer."
"a good solid beer here. probably nothing go out of your way for though."
"Overall its a good beer. First time with the style but had it a few times now. A pilsner on steroids is a good way to describe it."
"Overall - Soild example of a lager. Malty, bitterish, and easy to drink. Bout as good a lager as you can get in the usa. Low alcohol adds to how great this beer would be at a cook-out or bbq. Its a gold metal winner for a reason."
"drinkability: despite the notable clashing flavor, the beer has redeeming qualities that makes it easy to drink."
"Oddly, if I drink this beer following GLBC's Eliot Ness, I get a nutty flavor and the bitterness decreases substantially. The combination of the two in sequence is very stunning and I find the flavor of this brew extremely tasty after pre-conditioning my taste buds with Eliot Ness first."
"O - Excellent excellent excellent. I need to try more of this and more from Great Lakes!"
"O: Pretty much spot on style. It's nice to drink something light and refreshing once and awhile."
"The city of Dortmund has historically been a major industrial center for coal and steel manufacturing - no wonder it birthed a style of beer that is so industriously refreshing and to-the-point gratifying; a beer to chug not sip. Great Lakes Dortmunder Gold is indeed a shinning example of the style as well as an exceedingly enjoyable lager in its own right."
"Pours one finger of white head, clear amber body, very classic. Smells floral and fruity, maybe apple skin, some classic lager yeasty smells, quite nice as well. Tastes grainy like pilsner malt, touch of earthy hops, some carmel, some typical lager yeast characteristics leathery and maybe rubber band. Medium thin bodied, medium carbing. Overall not too bad but not one I'd go out of my way to get. I'd prefer a touch more carmel malt and a touch more body."
"D. A smooth easy drinker with enough character to please. A great summer beer - light and refreshing while maintaining a nice balance of sweet malt and bitter hop notes."
"O - delicious and rewarding from a style that can go so very wrong; perhaps not as dry as a traditional example"
"The roasted malt and bread notes dominate the flavor finishing with a slight orange zest and bitter herb taste. Mouth feel is chewy and buttery. A very nice beer."
"D: This is my first beer of the style and it’s a little bit sweeter and heavier than I like my lagers. Still, it’s very flavorful and I’m loving the hop character. Definitely recommended and it hits the spot."
"Pours a beautiful, slightly dark, golden yellow with a good amount of head in the Sam Adams perfect pint glass. Tastes of breadie/biscuit like malts with just a hint of hops and lemon in the finish. Its nice to have a lager that doesn't taste like rust. Compared to all the other BMC type of lagers you normally run across here in Canada. Good session lager."
"This is overall great beer right here, man I could just pound these back like nothing, I want to have this on tap somewhere it just feels so perfect. This could be my borderline lawnmower go to beer all the time lager right here."
"O - Not my style of beer. That said, it was still pretty good. I'll take an Eliot Ness over this any day."
"Served from tap into a sampler tumbler. Poured golden yellow with a minimal white head. Maintained excellent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, wheat, and banana. The flavor was of sweet malt, wheat, banana, and nutmeg. It had a light feel on the palate with mild carbonation. Overall this was a pretty nice and refreshing brew. The nutmeg aspect was a little palate invasive for me. It did have a decent flavor and aroma going on here, but nothing too memorable. I would suggest this to people to try it as it is worth it to do so at least once."
"Great Lakes Dortmunder Gold is a clear, solid, sparkling golden lager with a big, frothy, bubbly white head that has outstanding retention and lacing. It has a bready, yeasty aroma. It smells a little grainy a little fruity. It has a lively medium body with a metallic feel and a slightly gritty finish. It tastes malty, but not sweet. It has a twangy, slightly funky flavor. There's a slight juniper bitterness and alcohol in the finish and the aftertaste is hoppy. Is there fusel detected here? This is not really my thing. It seems kind of like a malt liquor."
"O- Beer with high drinkability and the flagship beer of Great Lakes that is widely available in NE Ohio. Not my favorite of their year-round beers, but a nice refreshing well-crafted beer that looks great."
"D-Hopiness start to build halfway through beer. A very nice, flavorful beer that is a nice alternative to less flavorful lagers."
"O: Overall, an excellent beer and, if it were more readily available here, would be one of my summer staples. Very good, clean flavors suited for a hot summer afternoon."
"Overall - A beer that just captures the style very, very well. I thought the taste was complex, but not overly so. Very refreshing. Kuds to Great Lakes."
"Very enjoyable beer. Not my favorite style, but still one of my top choices when I'm in Ohio. Very well balanced and always refreshing"
"D: Not a huge beer, but they manage to squeeze a huge amount of flavour in it. Just plain delicious! This beer is exciting and tasty; a great summer beer, but can be enjoyed all year long."
"O (D) - A smooth, tasty, inoffensive beer. Not my favorite style (lager), but something I enjoy drinking."
"Easy drinking. Extremely sessionable."
"D: a very tasty lager. Another classic from Great Lakes Brewing."
"Pours a clear orange with two finger sudsy white head, settles to a thin ring, splotches left behind. Smell: spicy with a hint of citrus rind, floral, light biscuity aroma, white grape. Taste: pale malt sweetness, white grape juice, spicy hopping. Relaxed but creamy carbonation, light bodied. Nice. Best by 5/30/11."
"Pours a dark yellow with a frothy white head, the frothiness is very impressive, smoother than a normal bottle pour. The smell is sweet with a nice malt aroma, nothing out of the ordinary. The taste is sweet with the malts driving the flavor. The sweet fades leaving a nice rich taste, a real full bodied lager. The mouthfeel is medium, the carbonation is spot on, this beer is well balanced overall. Definitely worth checking out."
"Give this one a try. It has won awards so don't hesitate. Great crafting."
"D: Great beer, goes with almost anything... I've probably had this more than any other craft beer (at sporting events, when introducing people to craft beer, and more)... no complaints about that."
"Not a great beer overall, but good for a lager. I wouldn't want this to be the only beer I drink, but having one once in a while wouldn't bother me."
"D: Easy to drink, clean, and crisp--just like a good lager should be. I wish this was a more prevalent style."
"This is a great example of a Dortmunder. Certainly the best American example I've had."
"Whenever your in the mood for a golden lager this is definetely a good choice."
"This is absolute perfection in a bottle, just pick up a sixer at any price and enjoy. This is craft beer at it's absolute finest."
"D: This is a good lager, very solid in it's taste and feel. Would be good in the summer, yet was fulfilling in the winter"
"D -- Definitely worthy of the awards and the purchase. Very solid brew."
"Reminds me of Dortmunder Union which I loved but can't find anymore. Great beer!! It looks like the original Union beer and I drank it out of a stein which created a very nice head. The aroma is distinctive and the taste is smooth. Just what you would need on a very hot day. I taste tested this beer against 2 others not knowing which was the Gold and I chose this beer as my favorite."
"This beer is fantastic. Perfect for the style. Perfect balance of sweet maltiness and bitterness from the hops. The hops start out with citrus notes before they turn more herbal. The malt gives body, flavor, and sweetness. This is a great lager. I like this almost as much as Elliot Ness from GL. They make some great beer at this brewery. In my top 3 domestic brewers!"
"This beer is the best beer ohio has to offer! It compared to a German Pilsner, my favorite type of beer! It does not have that horrible skunk smell that most german pilsners have! This beer had exceptional taste and was worth the $9 for the six pack!"
"Poured from 12oz bottle into pint glass as well as on tap. Honey-gold color with a puffy white cap that lasts and laces. Big bready sweet nose with some woody and herbal tones Huge chew of Munich malt in the front with a wonderful herbal noble hop balance, mid palate there is a subtle complexity as you taste the multiple malts and hop varieties used . Finishes lightly drying clean and satisfying with a citrus snap. A very nice Dortmund styled lager with a rich malt spine and traditional German hopping."
"Pours a nice golden color with a slight one finger head which reduces to skim but leaves some nice lacing. The aroma is of sweetness with a nice biscuit and breadiness to it. The taste has a biscuit and bread backbone with a hint of sweetness and a slight hop bite at the end. The mouthfeel is moderatley carbonated and dry. The drinkability is good, it is a smooth easy drink that is well balanced."
"Drinkability - This is really a pretty nice little beer. Solid all around. Easy drinking and balanced well. Worth a try. Could be enjoyed year round. I don't think I would turn this down."
"12 oz. bottle with clearly-marked freshness date; 30 IBUs, best at 45F. Courtesy of BA greenethumb. It is a deep golden color, unfiltered?, fairly carbonated with an inch of light tan head that leaves beautiful lacing. The very enticing aroma emits toasty malts and earthy/spicy hops. Rich and toasty Munich malts meld with sweet and grainy pilsner malts on the palate, backed by very flavorful spicy/perfumy hops that impart a lingering medium bitterness. The body is medium and smooth, with a chewy, dry finish - a bit heavy, but very nice. What a great beer here - crisp and refreshing, with a lingering finish. This is as easy to sip and contemplate as it is to drink by the pint; or at least it would be if I only had more bottles! A wonderful craft-brewed domestic lager."
"12oz bottle to a 16oz pint glass. pours a clear golden yellow with a fizzy white head that runs to the edges of the glass. The smell is wonderful very sweet pilsner-like smell, with faint spice and malts at the edge of the nose. A very bold spicy first sip that ends with a taste somewhere between lemon and grapefruit. Leaves the mouth dry and wanting more. Very drinkable as it lays pretty easy in the belly. i would assume it would be great on a summer day, but its not doing too bad in January either."
"Drinkability: A great beer that deserves all its awards."
"D - Drinkability is high. A light, refreshing beer with a nice profile to it. Alcohol is well masked and the bitterness at the end isn't a deterrent."
"This is a classic beer right here. This is the only lager I really need to drink! I've been enjoying this one since I got into craft beer. Great beer to try to convert your non-craft drinking friends. Without a doubt the benchmark for the style.. a pure winner."
"There's a reason this is GLBC's flagship brew. A simply amazing lager all around. Go try it now, it will not disappoint."
"This is a real nice lager, but without much to distinguish it."
"Great, easy drinking beer. Only if there was a way of cramming all this flavor into a lower alcohol beer."
"Drink - A fantastic full bodied beer that I will be happy to drink again anytime."
"Drinkability Yes,it's a bit dry but still interesting. Good ""changeup"" from the normal Stouts + IPA's I drink."
"Drinkability - This is something i wish i had access too daily. It would make for a great session beer and something nice to share. A must try!"
"Pours into a nice golden color with a thick white head. Very good lacing and retention. Carbonation isn't too bad either. Has a nice sweet hoppy smell that is a little yeasty, and the taste is a pleasant taste of hops that are slightly sweet with a nice crisp finish to the taste. The mouth feel is a nice firm taste that grips the cheeks on goes down smoothly. This is a very good summer drink with its crisp clean feel that is very drinkable. This style of lager is much better than the american macros like budweiser, coors, or miller high-life, reminds me a little bit of American Badass, and Moosehead, but with a stronger taste and more flavor to it. After trying this I think this is the beer that other brew masters are going to wish their beers were as good as this if your looking for a good crisp clean beer that most Americans would be used to when it comes to taste, appearance, smell, mouth feel and drinkability."
"AMAZING; TREAT YOURSELF!"
"d- overall this is a pretty good beer would definitely recommend to try and would repeat buy"
"Great Lakes Brewing is very good at what they do, which is to make very flavorful beers, and this one is no exception. Their attention to detail is evident in the flavor of this brew, which comes across as assertive, but not overwhelming. If you're drinking a Dortmunder, you probably want to be refreshed, and this beer fills the bill. You won't be disappointed."
"Very good, and easy drinking. I will be getting more of this!"
"I would love to try this fresh."
"D: A very highly drinkable beer. One of, if not the, best American lagers that I've ever tasted. I would be happy drinking one of these or a whole six pack. I've never seen this outside of the Ohio/western PA area, but definitely pick a pack up if you see it."
"Drinkability: I like this beer, personally though I enjoy it sparingly. It is tasty and easy to put down but, the style is just not quite up my alley. On a wider scale though someone might really enjoy this as a session beer."
"Appearance is clear with nice golden color, no seriously it really looks gold. One finger head quickly fizzles away. Smeels malty and bready with light hop scent in the background, good solid smell that i can get without even putting my nose to the glass. Really enjoy the smell. Tastes great, well rounded and balanced. Malty bready flavor up front with hoppy aftertones that leaves a good clean finish. Gives a nice solid feeling. This is not the first time i have had this particular beer...this is the 3rd sixer i have purchased and wont be the last sixer. Nice solid beer to keep in the fridge for any time of year."
"1/2 finger white head small bubbles, medium dissipation with above average lacing. Clear deep gold body with some rising carbonation. Nose is malty, mostly bready, some caramel, little hop aromas, mainly mild grassiness. Taste is sweet and clean, some dry breadiness up front, sweetish in the middle, some floral hops on backend. Medium mouthfeel, good effervescence, a slight bit of stickiness. Good drinkability, clean but not too heavy, a bit sweet for me but very nice, though I prefer the Elliott Ness to this."
"This is an exceptional beer. Great for a warm summer day in the back yard. Also -the 5.8% ABV is an added bonus as you can have more than a couple and still remain functional."
"This beer looks a beautiful golden orange color with some nice white foam with some decent lacing. The smell is very bready with some light lemon pepper notes. Overall not too impressive. The taste is rather acidic. There are some general bitter notes that are perhaps from the vinegary flavor notes. I know the style is supposed to be like this, but this is too bitter to really be all that enjoyable for me. I don't know why, but I'm starting to think that there is something in the water in Cleveland that doesn't personally work with my taste buds."
"Serving type: bottle"
"D: Quite drinkable and refreshing. Good balance and complexity."
"Upon drinking you definatly pick up on a sweet grainy flavor, much hoppier than I've expected, but that was actually pretty pleasent, with a slightly very subtle malty finish. At times I would pick up on a very citrusy fruity taste, something like a hefe, but as quickly as it would surface it would dissapear again. All in al a great brew."
"D - Another good brew from Great Lakes also had this one in the sampler case. I highly recommend the sampler packs. Very good choices!"
"Drinkability: Off the charts drinkable. Tasty but light. Every brewpub ought to have a tasty, drinkable beer like this in its regular lineup. If I could get this beer locally, I'd buy it by the case, especially in the summer."
"Drinkability: Exceptional, crisp malty beer. This guy is a winner. I haven't been disapointed by great lakes brewing yet."
"Overall, this is a very inviting beer, and outstanding specimen of a craft lager."
"Some beers really do live up to the hype. A great dark golden color. Aroma is malty but nothing leaping out. Nice flavors of malts with just a hint of hops. Very smooth, all of the flavors really come together. My first of this style, but WOW can't imangine any better then this. Just a great full floavred beer that begs you to have another."
"D: Excellent beer. Very drinkable. I'd certainly order it again."
"Great clean gold just slight red color good head retention. Nice big body full and malt taste. Good beer if you are looking for the biscuit or bread taste. Didn't get as much of the hop flavor that others talk about but that didn't wreck the taste. Good beer just after two or three it starts to seem like a meal."
"Drinkability is flawless - flavors are perfect both in amount and in proportion, mouthfeel follows close behind. Beautiful beer for anyone who loves a good German lager."
"Drink well my friends"
"Pours a perfectly clear golden color with a frothy and magnificent white head that retains well and leaves nice lacing. The aroma has some nice malty notes upfront (bread dough, hay, biscuit), along with some turbinado sugar and toffee, floral hops, and a faint note of alcohol. The flavor is also very malty, with bread dough and biscuit upfront, as well as hay, cane sugar, treacle and some herbal hops. The mouthfeel is light without being watery, and drinkability is very good. Very pleasant dortmunder here, glad to see more examples of the style."
"way too drinkable. a randy session brew for sure."
"Pours a clear, light copper/orange-gold with a small white head. Aromas are extremely honey-like, and I agree with those who detect something like hay. To the extent that hops are detectable on the nose, they're floral. The flavors are more complex than the nose suggested, with a malty start and an orange citrusy flavor that enters on the mid-palate and grows in strength to the point of achieving balance by the end. Finishes dry. It deserves its reputation as highly drinkable. For my money, it's the best of its style, but that's not necessarily saying much."
"D - Decent. If it weren't for the bold hopping, I'd rate this beer lower. There's other things from Erie that are much better, but overall, decent...not memorable."
"Overall, i thought this beer was great and i am glad i tried it. I can see why this beer won so many awards. If BMC beers stepped there game up and tasted more like this the world would be a much better place."
"End Beer Musings: Being a homebrewer and beer enthusiast it is well known it is much harder to brew a clean well tasting light beer or lager then it is a hearty RIS, stout/porter etc with nothing to hide any imperfections or contaminations. While not a big fan of the style, this makes an exception on what a lager could be, exceptionally smooth, hoppy with a great grain bill that is well balanced. I could easily keep a keg of this at all times and hardly tire of its thirst quenching session style drinkability that is refreshing from all others per style. A top 100 beer IMHO when style is considered."
"D: Overall very nice.. clean and tasty. Very solid and drinkable, but not a knock down amazing kind of brew."
"This pours a deep gold with some loose head but not much lacing. The nose is a piney sweetness, but I'm not getting the biscuit note that others are. In the mouth it's a very balanced brew, not as sweet as I was expecting based off of the nose. The mouthfeel is medium-light, and a little fuzzy from the carbonation. One could drink a few of these. Not a bad beer. I've been really pleased with the sampler from Great Lakes."
"Tasty tasty, just held back a bit by the flat nose... probable due to the age."
"very drinkable and quite refreshing on a sunny autumn afternoon. i'm not usually a lager fan but this one surprised me. well crafted and worth seeking out."
"O: Very good beer, one of the best I've had from Great Lakes."
"D: taste is not overbearing, and along with the crisp finish makes this beer easy to drink...better than your average lager"
"D: Great Lager. Session friendly."
"Overall this is an excellent beer. Winner, winner, winner!"
"This is a beer which demands certain attention. Even if you're not particularly into the style, its pretty impressive."
"I haven't had a beer of this style before. To me, it's a fairly average beer as far as drinkability goes. It doesn't stand out too much to me in any way, though it does seem like it'd be a decent summer beer."
"Pours a beautiful crystal clear amber with dense head. Herbal and citrusy hops along with malt in the nose. Stupendous flavor and mouthfeel experience. Malt, hops, carbonation, crispness, medium body... All in total sync. Aftertaste is a slightly sweet, highly hoppy, yeastiness. A very balanced brew that impresses in a big way."
"Great Lakes has mastered 5-6% ABV beers with tons of flavor. This is a great beer that I could enjoy any day of the year."
"As a native of Cleveland, I'll start off with the disclaimer that I'm extremely partial to this brewery. That said, its merits easily transcend hometown pride, and the Dortmuder Gold is perhaps GLBC's best ambassador. Pity it's not available out here. 12oz. Light aroma with a rather small head. Floral, mild pine. Where the beer comes alive is in the mouthfeel. It's perhaps the ideal weight for a lager with enough heft to stand up to food and flexibility enough to be enjoyed in beyond responsible quantities. Slightly creamy as well, with a light hop finish. What an American lager should be."
"Picked up a six pack at City Beverage while in town for the BA Sexual Chocolate release. 12oz bottle into a DFH Signature glass pours a crisp bubbly orange with a decent off white head that diminishes to a thin layer and leaves a trace of lacing on the glass. Aroma is crisp sweet malts and slight Earthy hops. The taste is sweet malts and mild caramel with a nice Earthy hop backbone. The beer is very smooth, crisp and refreshing, perfect to end a hot Summer day. This is quite possibly my absolute favorite average strength lager, a truly wonderful beer."
"Served in a Guinness pint glass. Pour results in a two finger head that holds its lace nicely. A nice malty nose with a wonderful lager flavor. Very good mouth-feel and exceptionally drinkable. The big macros could take a lesson in how to brew a wonderful lager such as this. A home-run for Great Lakes and one that will be a regular guest in my refrigerator..."
"Bottle. Pours a very clean light reddish copper color with a 1 finger head of offwhite bubbles. Nice collar. The aroma that I get is a sweet malt and a touch of hops. Actually has an aroma like apples or pears. Interesting taste, sweet up front followed by a slight hop bite in the back but the sweetness really never goes away. Medium mouthfeel. Overall, not a bad smooth drinking beer."
"D: Very smooth and easy drinking. Highly recommended for sessioning."
"One of my favorites of the Great Lakes beers that have finally made their way to Minnesota. This beer is about as crisp as you can make it, the euro malt and the sharp hops in the back end of the flavor make this a lager to think about. A well crafted and extremely enjoyable lager, I really enjoyed GL's take on this very European style."
"Overall, this is a very solid beer. It's a great drinkable standby that knocks most like-style beers out of the water. It's not my favorite of the Great Lakes Brewery lineup, but then again, GLBC makes some astounding beers, so that by no mean qualifies this as a sub par brew. I can't imagine any beer drinker hating the good old Dortmunder."
"D: Very, very drinkable. Anyone would drink this stuff. Nothing is offense or challenging, just easy drinking goodness."
"D: An excellent lager and my first (and regrettably only) Great Lakes Brewing beer to date. A very nice brew if you can find it -- it is a great accompaniment to food and a very solid, well-made lager with nice body and a sweeter, fruitier aroma and flavor profile."
"This beer delivers some flavor, complexity and balance while still remaining refreshing and exceptionally drinkable. Hmm, something good that comes from the Mistake by the Lake."
"Palate is malt and sweetness balanced by herbal and citrus hops on a nice medium-light body with moderate carbonation. Seems simple enough, but it's very, very well done, tasty and drinkable."
"Crisp, clean, with assertive noble hops, malty Munich, and sweet caramel, with a dry finish and just a hint of sulfury yeast contribution. What more could you want for a refreshing summer beer? The Munich and caramel malts will have you dreaming of Pork chops while the stiff hopping and lager yeast aroma call for pretzels and mustard. Medium bodied, 2.5V carbonated, and versatile."
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a rich golden color with a 1 inch head. Smell is mild, some hops. Taste is crisp, hops with a bit of malts, a tad hoppy for a lager. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and has good drinkability. Overall this is a fairly good beer."
"Overall, very good: light & smooth, a little sweet, & dry enough to beg returns. Really drinkable."
"Really good stuff that will likely be a regular in my fridge during the summer months. Another great beer from GLBC."
"I've had this many times and finally getting around to reviewing it. Bright golden color with a three finger white head that lasted forever leaving some gorgeous lacing down the glass. Smell is grainy, lightly sweet, and a nice bit of hopping on the back end of the nose. Perle hops?? Good balance in this beer. Malts are not too sweet, but there is a light honey-like thing going on, plenty of pale malts, but dries out on the finish with a decent, snappy hop bite. Medium body and crisp, easy drinker. One of the best craft lagers out there!"
"This was an interesting beer-more interesting than your standard BMC ""pilsner", but I like a little more hop flavor in my lagers. It got a little weird tasting before it warmed up."
"This is a good beer, maybe even a great beer. Its very drinkable, very enjoyable. A well crafted brew."
"D: Nice drinkability on this one. Although this is a good beer, I was a little disappointed; after tasting Great Lakes' porter I was expecting it to blow my socks off. It did not quite accomplish that."
"The beer pours a golden hue that lives up to its name. The smell, to me, is German. I don't know how to say it any clearer than that. The flavor is deep, but the mouthfeel can be a bit too carbonated at times. Drinkability is high. Gotta love that their flagship is a lager, though I think their best offering is the Edmund Fitzgerald Porter."
"I have been drinking this beer for years, but I guess I will finally rate it. Drinking from Bottle while night fishing for Catfish in Conneaut Ohio. Here comes a storm, lightning all around us. Better drink quickly. Starting off cold, Nice sweet malt, a touch of hops on the finish, a really nice smooth Lager. But as it warms, the flavor's explode. Hard to pinpoint what the flavor's are except it is a wonderful smooth Lager with exceptional balance that can be enjoyed all damn day....and night."
"Aroma is strong and crisp, malty and yeasty with a hint of honey sweetness. It pours a nice clear yellowish amber with a thick, if not persistent, white head. Flavor is richer than most golden lagers I have tried, malty and crisp with an interesting fruity undertone, the sort that I find mainly in ales. Texture is crisp and fizzy, leaving behind a nice tingle."
"D - A very nice, very flavorful lager that's extremely easy to drink. Even at 5.8% this brew may get some in trouble because it's smooth and easy to have multiple (or many some may say) servings."
"(Bottle) A replacement selection from Keg_Juggler for the week. This is the first I've tried the Dortmunder style. This is a nice alternative from an everyday pilsner with a bit more malt and sweetness. Poured a golden color with a lingering head & good lacing. Mild and easy to drink. Refreshing, very enjoyable."
"D - This one went down rather quickly on such a hot day...this one would be easy to drink...yet it's not my style to have all the time"
"The body and carbonation are both medium and the drinkability of this beer almost defines drinkability in the best possible way. Cheers!"
"Perhaps my favorite session beer, next to Oberon. I'd highly recommend this to drink again."
"This is my second beer so yea it is drinkable."
"D: Very good beer, this is one that I will come back to. A very good rendition of this style. The medium body is very drinkable."
"Excellent, all-around enjoyable brew even though, after every few sips, I was a little tweaked that I was tasting something that reminded me of Bud (or some other macro). Still awfully drinkable."
"Notes: This is typically far from the style I would go after, and I almost feel strange rating it this high, but it is quite the treat. Very nicely balanced with a flavorful and rich profile. Maybe not my favorite Great Lakes but quite the brew."
"Overall: Kind of a distant cousin of Goose Island Pale Ale."
"Taste is incredibly balanced with pilsner hops that you'd expect, a bit of citruis and good malt to back it up. This is a great all around beer, wish it were avail in Indiana, probably need to look harder."
"D - quite refreshing, and tasty to boot. might have to make this a regular among my Summer hot weather repertoire. very well done."
"D:This was an excellently crafted beer (based on my experience with Dortmunder beers) and I will drink it on draft whenever possible. It has a pleasant finish that balances the malty front."
"D: It had been a while since I had this one. Finally starting to roll into NY. One of the best lagers that I have ever had."
"D-This beer is quite delicious. I find it difficult to decrease the drinkability rating, if anything for the fact that the body is a bit much, compared to my expectations."
"Drinkability is very good, feels like it cleans the palate everytime you have a sip. Alcohol is very light. Normally I say the more hops the better, but I think this brew really fits the style well, and I will most likely seek out more."
"O: I would love to take a fresh Dave's Brewfarm Select, Dortmunder Gold, and Surly Hell and try them all side by side. I know style wise they differ a bit but these are my three favorite light lagers. This is definitely one to pick up. A lot of people might say ""perfect lawn mowing beer"" I'm just gonna say great beer."
"Pours a clear golden straw with about a finger of white foamy head that stays around for a while, leaving a small amount of lacing as it goes. The smell is of vague grains (mostly wheat), sweet corn, and a light breeze of floral hops. The taste follows pretty closely, though the floral hoppy bitterness is higher than in the nose. The sweetness of the corn is also toned down a peg. The body is rather light, with moderate carbonation and a fairly dry finish. Overall, a refreshing, if not all that exciting, gold lager. Not bad."
"This is one of my faves of the GLBC brews, and I hope it makes its way into your fridge sometime soon! (No hometown bias here, I promise -- it's that good!)"
"D- Nice beer that isn't hard at all to finish. Could knock a couple back with ease and I could see this becoming a session beer for many people."
"Others here talk about it as a gateway to craft beer, and I could see that. Everything that's wrong with macro lager corrected, without having to get used to C-hops."
"Drinkability: could drink this all night wish there were more examples of this style available."
"Drinkability: The operative word for this beer is ""balance."" This is a very well made beer that I've enjoyed drinking and would be happy to have a second. I will most certainly have this beer again in the future and look forward to the chance to set up a side by side tasting with this beer, a good helles lager and a tasty pils style."
"really good drinkability, good for the summer months. has more flavor than your average lager and is a really great session beer. this is the first ive had of this paticular lager style, and i could see myself drinking this again, i just wouldnt go seeking it out immediately. go get this if you want a really flavorful lager."
"Drinks with anything. Might as well order a couple because you'll be ready for another by the time the first course arrives. Get a driver though 'cause it's bigger than it feels going down. Great beer; highly recommended."
"Overall, this is a good lager. While I'm not crazy about it I won't have time finishing off the rest of these in the fridge."
"Light, refreshing, decent carbonation, and a dry finish. A decent beer which I would not hesitate to buy again."
"Great Lakes Dortmunder Gold pours two fingers of dense creamy foam over a clear brassy brew. Carbonation is lively, and the nose is sweet light malt and funky lager yeast. The flavor is bready, slightly fruity malts, giving over to tart notes and grassy/herbal hops off the back. Mouthfeel is pretty full and round for a lager, drying just a bit, with grassy hops in the aftertaste. Very solid lager- all too drinkable..."
"D: The source of the American light lager, I guess. I can see why American brewers mimicked styles like this for so long, too bad they don't make it this good for the most part anymore."
"D--could pound a 6-er of this beer all summer long, glad the Great Lakes brews have hit the city"
"D= A good beer for the style. Not the most interesting beer but pretty spot on for the style. I would be hard pressed to find a beer that fits better into it. Great beer to drink when ya got nothing going on."
"O: Exceptional balance. This beer really does have an awesome maltiness up front and a floral hop finish. Definitely going into my rotation."
"Absolutely wonderful. Amazing. Hats off to Great Lakes. Top 3 p4p breweries world wide. You can't F with Dortmunder Gold. Top Notch beer."
"In my opinion, this is Great Lakes Brewing best year-round beer. Damn near perfect session lager. Pours a bright, pale amber color with two-fingers of dense, white head that had excellant retention before settling to a thick cap. The aroma is not that potent but it smells nicely balanced between the pale malt and hops. Not as malty as Munich lagers, not as dry as a Pilsner, fits this beer perfectly. The flavor blends all the best parts of the various German lagers. Solid bready malt base balanced perfectly by spicy hops. Notes of some citrus hops as well in the finish to add more flavor. The body is rich and smooth for a light lager. Might be just a touch overcarbonated. I could drink this all the time, any season of the year. I just wish it was cheaper."
"Drinkability is excellent. Very easy to drink."
"Awesome session beer. Has to be one of the best in this style."
"Drinkability: Well balanced lager that truly shows what Dortmunders are all about. Smooth, crisp body is the highlight, as is the complexity, although there is just a little too much straw and grass flavors for my liking, but that is a minor gripe when the beer is so good."
"D-Wow, I remember hating this beer about 5 years ago. Thought it was so bitter, oh how tastes change. This is a super easy drinking, light bodied, flavorful beer that I could see myself having a number of in the upcoming warmer months."
"Drinkability: Overall, the beer is very well rounded and an easy drinker, but really delicious. Just a solid beer."
"D- I am admittedly not a huge fan of lagers but I was pleasantly surprised with this one. It has a good taste and is almost creamy. I would pick this one up again."
"Taste, a little more than where my expectations had sank to after the pour. Tasted grainy. Minimal hop or malt feel. No surprises through the rest. Light on the palate. Hoped for more zest. Very easy to drink. I honestly don't get what is so great about this beer. Its fine, just fine."
"pours a nice dark yellow /slight amber color with a fresh 1 finger head and nice lacing on glass....the smell is malt and bread some hops and spices..the taste is malt forward in a big way its crisp with pale malts and noble hops and some bitterness to this.. it finishes crisp and clean..the mouth feel is medium its flavorful and satisfying ..the Munich malts balanced with the noble hops make for a tasty treat for the summer... a great lager representation will drink this many times this summer"
"Overall - Not too bad"
"A very nice Dortmund styled lager with a rich malt spine and traditional German hopping....a lager lover's wet dream."
"Pours a golden yellow color with one finger of fluffy white head. The malt shows up big in the aroma with a lot of sweetness and some butteryness over a slight metallic background. A light, floral hop aroma is also present. The taste starts off with a slight bitter bite and then there's a nice, medium body of sweet malt with a slightly drying, toasted flavor. Some bitterness comes back in on the finish which is fairly clean and fast. Drinkability is excellent. This is a favorite of mine for a nice, easy drinking beer."
"Cool to finally drink a beer that has been every beer book since the late 90,s as a great example of US lager. Poured it into my new Sam Adams perfect pint glass and it looks golden and lovely. Decent head and a good hoopy nose. This is a great lager with nice mouthfeel and good malt backbone as per the style. Could drink a bunch of these and it is a shame that it isn't available on the West Coast. Nothing imperial or weird about this beer but rather a well crafted drinking beer ."
"D: Would take this any day over a pilsener. Definitely a go-to for a sixer."
"D - balanced, smooth, very easy to drink"
"Drinkability is great. It goes down nice and easy and is quite tasty and refreshing. Definite session beer for sure, I would love to have this year round. I will be picking up more of these in the near future."
"if i am going to drink a lager this is the one for me!pours dark amber ,nice head , drinks real well,smooth and deliscious!it doesnt surprise me it is gold medal winner. said it before and will say it again cant go wrong with great lakes!this is not too bad in a bottle either."
"D: Not only is it delicious, it is well balanced and very quaffable. I would happily have many of these."
"D: Admittedly, I'm not much of a lager drinker. I actually picked this one up for my wife. After working outside in the yard, this was absolutely perfect. It isn't too light, and has just enough going on to interest the finicky beer drinkers. I am quickly becoming a fan of Great Lakes."
"A very good, working-class lager that has been one of my staple brews for years. A harmonious balance of bitter, sweet, and toasty. Light golden color, an aromatic and spicy finish almost like a ""champagne of beers"" or something. It's just really good, quite complex, and perfect for days or nights, with food or by itself, in a glass or from the bottle.. etc.,etc.,etc."
"I'm looking forward to this as a fundamental for my summer fridge (when I can afford it)."
"Drinkablity: I love this beer and it's one of GLBC's staples -- nice, solid, simple and straightforward, love the flavors and it's not too heavy and the ABV is more than manageable at just under 6%; great all year but I tend to prefer it in the summer."
"M: This beer has a bit more body than I would expect from this beer. It is also pretty carbonated, which I really enjoy."
"Taste is well balanced and has loads of flavor for a fairly light lager. Spiced herbaceous hops are very much in the forefront as well as some freshly crushed grains drizzled with honey. I am surprised by the hop presence in the beer, both flavoring and bittering. Finish is dry with a little bit of lingering earthy malt husk and toast. Very delicious brew, I like it a lot."
"Taste was much like a pilsner, dry with a nice hop bite, again grassy and hints of some pear, with spicy notes on the end. The malt profile was not as pronounced as a pilsner but it was good nonetheless. Mouthfeel was dry, lots of carbonation with a clean mildly astringent finish. This is a very nice lager and I could enjoy several for several days in a row."
"D: Good, solid sessionable brew."
"D/O- Drinkability is there, not quite sure I wouldn't switch to something else after a couple of these though."
"D: As an export, the ABV is slightly higher than the standard 5%. I suspect that would be the limiting factor, because the taste makes me want to have several more. I truly hope they start distributing this in New Jersey, although it makes my trips to Pennsylvania all the more worth while if I get this along the way!"
"D: I would not question purchasing this beer again. Its a very good light beer with enough flavor to justify another pour."
"D - Dangerously drinkable at 5.8%. While I might instead choose a pilsner as my go-to lager in the warmer months, Dortmunder Gold could easily fit the bill the rest of the year."
"This beer is to good to be true, and it is under $7 a sixer. If you find it, buy it and it is wonderful, for those BMC drinking buddies."
"Good finger's worth of close to tan foam, nice frothy look, whipped up, the lacing possesses adequate stickiness. Clear deep orange with as much red influence as yellow, has a metallic brightness to it. Oats, grains, corn husk and some pepperiness most noticeable in the nose, uncooked bread dough, honey glaze, wildflowers, mixed white fruit, no one element jumps out at you but it remains full and satisfying as a whole. Medium-bodied, sets itself widely yet never heavy. The dough here closer to sourdough or pumpernickel, sweet like browner bread than honeyed. Soft carbonation adds to the overall pliancy, yields but doesn't give. Deeper apricot, peach fruit, the citrus mixed in composition but also more resonant. The maltiness betrays traces of cocoa and mocha, not sweet chocolate. Smooth as she goes through the finish, the hoppiness more a bracing perfume than flavor on the tongue. Quaffable without ever seeming simple."
"D: Well, this would be a great candidate for a session beer. The only thing holding me back from giving it a slightly higher rating is that it's a little on the sweet side for me."
"This is an easy drinking golden lager. Would make a great brew for gatherings and for me anyway, would be a nice change of pace. Good stuff..."
"It must be me. I went again, off of the ratings on this site for this beer. A local 6 pack store sells all kinds of beer, and it had this one. I made my own 6 pack and had one of these last night. I couldn't drink it all. Again, I can't describe the taste, but it did not agree with me. I love Yuengling, so I thought I might like this brew, and I didn't. It looks very good, not much carbonation which I like, but I just didn't like the taste."
"M/D: This beer is so enjoyable and well balanced, that I would have no problem drinking these all night. Great Lakes, at this point, seems to be unable to do any wrong when it comes to brewing world class beers. This beer is no exception."
"D-highly drinkable this beer has a great taste and could easily be enjoyed all night"
"Yet again another fine brew from Great Lakes. And yet another case worthy brew from this brewery."
"This is one of the best lagers on the market. Very fairly priced. Goes down so easy. Easy to get swept up in fancy limited release beers and forget how good a classic like this is. The 5.8% is a nice number for those of us who like our beers a bit beefier. A great beer to spend a night with."
"This German style Dortmunder pours a bright clear gold with a nice frothy white head that leaves nice lacing down the sides of your glass. The aroma gives off plenty of sweet malt, with some light breadiness on the end. Dortmunder has a nice medium body with a light amount of carbonation that works perfectly with the heavy amount of malty sweetness. Great Lakes did a great job of balancing this Lager with a near perfect amount of herbal and citrus hops. The brew dries up fairly quickly, although there is a little remaining sweetness. This is an excellent, light sessionable Lager weighing in at a drinkable 5.80% abv."
"All in all, this might be a decent brew to convert from mainstream to craft. Only if the transition will be slow though. This doesn't fall too far out of mainstream. If you are already into craft, this is not worth hunting down."
"D: A highly drinkable session brew. For me, this ranks right up there with SN Pale Ale as an elite session beer. I'm amazed again and again by the quality of Great Lakes' flagship beers. All 5 of them are truly great brews and Dortmunder Gold is no exception. Germany should be proud."
"This is not my style of beer nowadays, but this is an excellent brew nonetheless. I dream of downing a few of these on draft in a Cleveland beer garden..."
"Pours a beautiful golden (go figure) color with a wispy light head, good carbonation and very nice lacing. Aroma of sweet bready malts, a touch of caramel, and some nuttiness as well. The taste is wonderful. Nice and clean, yet complex. Lots of white bread malt notes, caramel, soft herbal hops, honey and a touch of toastyness. Also, I am detecting some toffee in the finish. Delicious. Very well balanced with just enough bitterness to balance out the malt character. Medium bodied with a very nice clean finish that is not too sweet or dry. This beer would go great with a sports game or BBQ. Very well executed. It is no wonder that it has been a gold medal winner. I realize that hoppy American ales are not for everyone, but with amazing lagers like this around, it's amazing that people still drink BMC beers."
"D-easy drinking, so smooth, incredibly tasty (little hoppier than I would have expected but I loved it) fantastic offering, another top notch session beer from Great Lakes!"
"D - The balance is fantastic. I don't get the aroma being the way it is but the rest of the beer is very good. An extremely drinkable lager that's flavorful but not overpowering."
"Overall a very drinkable lager and an interesting one as well."
"Drinkability: I have not had too many beers more than once in the past three years. I bought two sixes of this stuff because it was soooo good!"
"A beautiful light copper amber color, crystal clear and full of bubbles with a big off-white head and great lacing. The aroma says pleasant malty grass hop blend, almost nutty with a sour milk edge. The flavor comes on with the same blend of bready malt and leafy hops. Well carbonated, refreshing but a very solid mouthful of woodsy flavors and a delight to discover in the lager family. Medium bodied for the style. A true quality brew that goes down like you want a lager to go down."
"F.T.- One of the top 5 lagers in the world; in my opinion."
"D: Very drinkable, these flavors blended well for a really nice beer."
"D - An extremely drinkable lager... Quite quaffable... Goes down easy sip after sip... A terrific session brew... This is an exceedingly simple, but uber effective offerings from at Great Lakes..."
"D- Pretty clean finish, low ABV, very pleasant to drink. Anyone will like this beer from the seasoned beer snob to the noob who only drinks Miller."
"Dortmunder Gold was one of my gateways to better beer and I am very happy to re-visit this. One of my all time favorites."
"I poured from a 12 ounce bottle into my SA perfect pint glass. It is clear gold in color with a sticky little white head. The aroma is grainy, sweet and bready. The flavor is sweet, bready and it has a lingering malty finish. There are enough hops to keep it balanced. The beer is medium bodied and a easy drinking. A good all around brew."
"Would I buy more of it? - maybe as part of another mixed pack. I just can't see myself buying a whole six-pack (after driving to upstate New York just to get it). There are too many other beers I'd be more likely to buy in bulk."
"D: balanced perfectly this is a well crafted beer, nice balance between hops and malts they work together to make one amazing brew. this is the only dourtmunder i have ever had and it was great. so I have nothing to compare it to, reminds me of a amber ale. this is highly drinkable ."
"F: Dries off slightly on the finish and even bitters a bit. Adds almost a spicy feel to the crisp lager finish, with some spicy bitter hop hints. It finishes smooth and lingers a bit with the bitter hop flavors and more toasty malts. It sticks around lightly for a while, and nicely. This has quickly become one of my favorite lagers!"
"A great beer, but a bit heavy and definitely not for the weaker drinker. The alcohol content is high. The flavor is very rich while remaining refreshing and vibrant. It starts off smooth and crisp then rounds off with a solid finish that is exactly as the name says ""gold."" It's all here: clear hops flavor, perfectly balanced malt, and outstanding mouthfeel. Flavors of slightly buttery grain and a very slight copper tinge. As mentioned, this might be a bit rich for lighter beer fans, so drinkability is not the main feature of this beer. If you tend towards heavier beers but still enjoy something a bit lighter than a fest beer, this is your dream come true."
"Beer is really smooth and finishes cleanly. Lots of malt in the character, clean and finishes really nicely. Mouthfeel is great, there is a very mild sweetness and then some malt flavors come through, slightly (very slightly) bready overall. Drinkability is high and my overall impressions are positive."
"Pours golden orange with a small white head. The aroma is bready malt with some hops and honey. The flavor is clean bready malt with some hops, honey, toffee and lemon. High carbonation and thin-medium mouthfeel. I have not had too many beers of this style but I really enjoyed this one."
"An insanely drinkable lager."
"One of my favorite beers of all time. One of the first micro-brewed beers I ever had, and something I will drink for years to come."
"Overall this is one of the best lagers I have had. This isn't really a style I buy very often, but it's one of the best of the style I have had."
"As a Lager, I think this is the best of the brand that I've ever had."
"D - I don't think a beer could be any more drinkable than this. It strikes such a great balance that I don't think I could really tire of it. I bought a variety case of GL and this is the one I've been trying to spread out as much as I can, haha."
"With adequate marketing, this could easily outsell Yuengling Lager... not even in the same class."
"M & D - This is a really drinkable beer - the carbonation is proper to the nitty gritty. It's never too fizzy or flat. The body is not watery or thick but seems just right. This is not an ""intense"" beer like a lot of American breweries tend to be making these days. But instead this beer comes off like a beer that knows it has nothing to prove and puts forward unpretentious flavors in such a way that delights even the most seasoned palate. Really good beer from the edge a dirty-nasty lake."
"Cheers!"
"This is a superb beer. One of my new favorites. Great tasting beer for any time of year. A new sessionable brew to had to my collection."
"A highly drinkable choice, with tons of flavor at that ABV. It might come on strong for a session beer but it could certainly do as one. It's really fun to find a lager with the flare and craft of some of the better American ales. Definitely worth a try if you find it."
"Very drinkable beer -- every swallow invites you back for the next one, and wouldn't just a bit more be nice? I could definitely session this."
"d- wow, this was a great surprise. i wasn't expecting the dortmunder to be like this at all, it's a very lightly flavored crisp, bitter lager - i'm loving it! i'm glad these beers are finally available in pa and i can pick them up now, this may be my go to lager."
"I was pleasantly surprised by this beer. It's not a style I'm a big fan of, but this is a very tasty beer."
"D- This is a stupid drinkable beer. I forgot how good this beer was and to be honest I think this is one of Great Lakes best year around beer. I do think this beer needs to be revisited by everyone who had it at some point in their beer drinking life because it will make you remember how good something can be without being over the top!"
"Pour is a clear deep golden hue. Head doesn't stick around long. Sweet bread scent along with a hint of citrus and floral hops. When trying to pinpoint a taste, you realize how well balanced this beer is. There's a floral herbal vibe intermingled with a sweet doughy bread. Very crisp finish. It's been years since I've had this and I never much cared for it before, but I quite like it now. Must be a maturing palette. I know I'm in the minority, but Eliot Ness is my favorite GL lager."
"D. A good brew, nice balance, with plenty of hops. Refreshing and I liked the lasting bitterness, and the citrus peel tartness."
"This ain't no yellow fizzy stuff!"
"Drinkability: Very easy to quaff, and I could without a doubt session with this beer. Low-ish abv, crisp taste, refreshing quality, and not too overpowering. Very solid"
"Drinkability- Excellent! Packs plenty of flavor but goes down smooth. No wonder why it used to require armed escorts."
"Drinkability: I am going to make this my every day drink , really nice beer, I do not like hoppy beer that much, this is more malty beer , and I love it."
"Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied with low to medium carbonation. This is what lagers are all about, one of the easiest drinking beers ever."
"Drinkability: This is one of those desert island beers. A brew I could drink every day, in very high quantities. One of the best Great Lakes beers, and one that you need to track down if you haven't."
"D- Pretty easy to drink, I'm normally not a huge fan of this style but once again GL delivers a mighty fine brew."
"Drinkability is high. This is a great Dortmunder-style lager overall."
"O: An EXTREMELY sessionable beer. Not filling in the slightest and finishes clean, leaving you wanting more. Goes well with the pad thai I made the other night and would be perfect for barbecue or spicy food. An excellent beer. I always wonder why the big boys don't just do something like this. It's so very simple but so very good. A great transition beer for someone looking to leave macro lagers behind and set foot into craft beer."
"i'm interested to see how this varies from a pilsner or german lager. pours a color true to the name, pure gold and perfectly clear. hmm, have you ever had a beer that doesn't smell or taste like anything, but yet it's very good? it looks like beer you see on a BMC commercial when they talk about ""clean, crisp, clear lager"" except it actually delivers that smoothness that the macros don't. i'll leave it to others to note more distinct and subtle flavors/notes, but i'll just say this is the most drinkable beer i've ever had. it tastes great, leaves the palate in order and makes you want another. and another. i need to remember to have a case of this on hand for my next backyard bbq."
"Overall: Good overall but definitely not my favorite style. For style though a nice robust yet drinkable job."
"Great beer - reminded me of many of the high-quality lagers you can get in Germany and the Czech Republic. Although satisfying with a homemade pizza, it could go with any traditional German dish, or with most casual dining fare. I'd recommend with grilled pork chops or chicken, salad, and haricort verts."
"Gold colored beer with a rapidly fading head.Aroma is citrus and hoppy,Taste is lemons,florals and a hint of caramel malts.Goes down very easily like a cold glass of water on a hot summer day.I wasn't expecting much and was pleasantly surprised.I would recommend and purchase again!"
"D: It feels weird to say this on a site where the Top 100 is populated almost exclusively by imperial this-and-thats, but this is a clean, simple beer and I'd love to drink this on a regular basis."
"Overall a very nice lager. Delicious in it's simplicity."
"decent, but might have to try to get a fresher sample, just to be sure..."
"Off the tap at the Bluewater Grill in Skaneateles, NY this beer was an orange-gold color with a good amount of rising carbonation. The pint was delivered to me perfectly full so there was no head to speak of but the thin collar of beige lacing did retain well and lace appropriately. The aroma was of caramel malt, dry grains and floral hops. The flavors were just plain outstanding for a lager, displaying a perfect balance of grassy hops and sweet malts, both caramel and toasted. The flavor profile started sweet followed by some light lemon notes in the middle before it proceeded to a bitter, but crisp and dry finish. The body was medium, the carbonation perfect and the mouthfeel smooth. One of the best food beers I have ever encountered. Sessionable, balanced, on-point for the style and easily paired with any food. This brewery is famous for a good reason and I would rate this one up there with their Edmund Fitzgerald as an all-time favorite. Simply put, if you see it, don't miss it."
"This is about as easy drinking as you can get. The flavor profile is good, but not great or this category would probably be a perfect 5."
"Pours a brilliant crystal clear deep golden color. Thick bubbly head. Not much in the way of lacing. The smell has a funky vinyl or plastic quality to it that was a little off-putting. The taste is dry and grainy. It's nicely balanced up front with bready fresh cut hay flavors and a pleasant bitterness. Theese flavors give way to a little bit of metalic and skunk aftertaste. Tastes like an import is the easiest way to describe it. I'm not as in love with this stuff as alot of people seem to be. It does grow on you. It goes down very nicely and the third or fourth is better than the first. Maybe the style just isn't my thing. I'm sure this tastes exactly like it is supposed to taste. Great lakes knows what they are doing. Personally if we are talking about a good lager, just give me a nice crisp pilsener or even a macro. This just wasn't great for me."
"This is excellent. It's pretty clear why this has won a gold medal at the GABF. Can't think of a more authentically German-brewed American lager that has this much flavor. Buy it when/if you see it."
"Its ABV may not technically qualify it as a session beer, but this is a ridiculously drinkable brew, and I'd be happy to spend an evening in a bar ordering glass after glass. Another winner form one of America's most consistent breweries!"
"Drinkability: this beer is superbly easy to drink and is a clear session ale during any season, whether sitting alone watching TV, or out on the town. Great beer."
"D-Extremely tasty and refreshing. I am rapidly becoming a bigger fan of this style, due in no small part to this particular brew."
"D - Definately easy to drink, could be a nice session beer."
"D: Impressive."
"Flavor is very similar to the aroma. Medium bodied yet slightly watered down with some nice earthy hops up front and a sweet pilsner malt backbone that provides excellent balance. There is a nice biscuit graham cracker presence in the malt profile and I'm also picking up some subtle faint light crisp fruit, mostly apple and pear. The hops provide a nice bitterness that is prominent up front and lingers above the complex maltiness into a nice dry finish. Very well balanced and very drinkable."
"Notes: I haven't had a Dortmunder Lager before, but from what I've gathered it fits in between a Czech Pilsner and a Munich Helles Lager. Based on that it works very well. The right combination of hops and malt, while still being both crisp and smooth. The perfect craft alternative to people who want an American macro. Bring some to the next party and watch people convert instantly from their BMC. It has all that ""drinkability", but still tastes like a good flavorful German lager."
"this beer pours a nice clear golden color with red highlights and an off white head that recedes to thin lacing. the aroma presents a nice pilsner nose with a bit of hop at the back. the taste follows with a bready malt taste and a dry bitter hop finish. the light mouthfeel with adequate mouthfeel make this a really easy drink."
"M/D: Great amount of carbonation, this beer is highly drinkable and refreshing... and one of my favorite session beers hands down. Light to medium body."
"Screw a six pack; this is something I can drink by the case. Crisp, balanced, refreshing and just damn tasty."
"Decent beer to drink. I think it'd do better on tap but otherwise, it's nice to try beer from other states."
"D - Light taste and very refreshing, but still flavorful. Definitely an easy drinker. Considering I'm not a big lager beer style drinker, this beer was very nice and flavorful IMO. I would definitely drink this again."
"Pale copper in color. Seems a bit dark for a Dortmunder style. A decent head, but it does dissipate. Only moderate lacing. Smell and taste demonstrate significant hops presence, again, more thsn usual forn the style. Intense hoppiness in tatse, with a spicy finish. Good, strong mouthfeel. Overall, a good beer, but I don't know how representative of the style this beer is. It actually drinks more like an IPA or pale ale to me."
"D: Easy peasy."
"(from tasting notes dated 05 Aug 2009)"
"Pours yellow gold with a finger of frothy off-white head. Aroma is a balance of biscuity malts and mildly grassy hops. The flavor is where one really gets to enjoy this beer. Wonderfully balanced, and full of the aforementioned biscuit malts, and grassy, earthy hops that linger on the tongue. A touch of grape fruitiness and a little more alcohol than I would like. Mouthfeel of this medium-bodied beer is minerally, and I'm sure that one could put away several of these. Another solid example from Great Lakes and a fine way to take a break from more extreme styles. Very enjoyable without getting whacked upside the head."
"Drinkability - Excellent Lager. This is definitely a keeper and another great selection from Great Lakes."
"What can I say, this is the Great Lakes Brewery flagship beer and possibly my favorite session beer of all time - its a fantastic, well balanced, flavorful and enjoyable brew!"
"D - Well balanced, tasty, nothing overpowering. This is a very good beer I could drink a number of in an afternoon especially with football season around the corner."
"Drinkablity: Good beer that could be a great session beer. I do not know if this is available in Dallas but I would enjoy this beer again and again."
"D - Flavorful and smooth, this has always been one of my favorite Great Lakes beers. This was one of my favorite ""expensive"" beers in college, and probably the one beer most responsible for getting me into craft beers. This bottle and six-pack, I am convinced, were not ""on their game", so to speak. Something was up with the smell and the flavor that wasn't like Dortmunder Gold I have sampled in the past. The freshness date was perfectly fine, so I dunno... Regardless, this is still a great beer."
"Drinks super fresh. The grains and hops mix to be very smooth."
"D: Very well done brew, crisp and clean is the perfect way to describe this brew (don't underesimate the bite, ha). I'd never tried the style before (and Great Lakes seems to be the biggest producer in the US) but I was extremely impressed with GL's take. Another feather in GL's cap, the more of their brews I try, the more I continue to believe that they're one of the best. If you're looking for a nice easy drinking lager to relax with, give this brew a try!"
"Enjoyable, the bottom of the glass leaves you wanting another. Not the best Golden lager I have had but still, another solid brew from Great Lakes."
"Dortmunder Gold has a amber color with some lighter spots here and there. Alot of rising bubbles create a nice looking tan but unsturdy head that fades into some small patches. No lacing from this.The smell consists of grain, barley hops and some earthy hops. The hops come out in taste a bit more with a nice sweet malt backdrop and light floral arrangements. Some bisquits in the middle with yeast taste finishing it out. The feel is light crisp and refreshing on this hot day, carb is spot on. I will pick up a sixer of this next time around cause it was good."
"D- overall drinkability is excellent, a huge difference from the german offerings, much better IMO"
"(D)- A fine beer that could be really enjoyed in the Fall season, however, I think that this one is a bit old. A bit too sweet."
"This beer pours as a clear, medium orange with very little head. It tastes sweet at first, mild citrus with a slightly bitter aftertaste. Actually reminds me of a light-weight IPA. Very drinkable, but when all said and done, I found it rather mild. I would drink it again, just wouldn't go out of my way for."
"Drinkability: A great beer. This is definitely going to be a mainstay in my collection now."
"4.0 D: It tastes so damn good, but it's a little on the sweet side so it reduces the drinkability."
"Grassy, herbal aromas dominate the nose, with a light, clean citrus quality thrown in. Biscuit-like malt on first sip, followed by the grassy/herbal character. Light bodied and eminently drinkable, with an overall sense of being simply clean. I'm a fan."
"This beer was just fine. Nothing complicated, but if you're in the mood for a lager, it hits the spot quite nicely."
"D- Now this is a 'lager' that I could get in to! An easy drinking beer with just enough taste to let you know its there."
"D- good drinkability almost sessionable but at almost 6% alittle strong for that"
"Dark gold or light honey color that seems in the right (or wrong) light to approach a light amber. Light head with a little bit of prickle. The nose is grainy and thick. Fresh clean attack that refreshes the palate. Very gentle flavor of grain. The beer sours a bit towards the finish and leaves a taste like unripened fruit or berries on the tongue. Believe it or not this is the part of the beer that I enjoy the most. I feel too much like I have to work to get anything else out of the nose or flavor. I am glad that there are many others that like it as I think a broad variety of beer from any brewer is a wonderful thing. I prefer some of their other offerings however."
"Carbonation is actually fairly high. It's incredibly drinkible and very refreshing. Perfect for summer, but also a beer that I could enjoy fully in the colder months, too."
"Pours a clear gold color with a below average egg-colored head. The smell is sweet, but it's a bit faint. I can also pick up some citrus hops. The taste is nice and refreshing. A hoppy finish complements the sweet taste up front. Mouthfeel is a bit thin, but it has a solid carbonation. Drinkability is high due to the low ABV and good taste."
"Great beer!"
"I could drink this by the gallon, an excellent offering."
"notes: the keg was changed a few hours before i tried this beer, so i believe it was pretty new and fresh. Liked it more on-tap then in the bottle."
"Has a nice amber/gold color with a lively head. Has the smell of hops and firewood in the morning. The taste is very hoppy all around, but a very tasty hoppiness. The mouthfeel is a bit lighter than other beers. I could drink a whole 6 pack of this in a sitting, especially for the price."
"Tap at the brewpub. Pours a perfectly clear gold with a nice off-white head. Nice retention and lacing. Pleasant, slightly sweet malt with some apple-like fruitiness. Grassy hop aromas. Very nice flavors of sweet, grainy malt, balanced by the perfect amount of bittering hops. Slightly dry finish. Full body. Very nice, very drinkable lager."
"D-This is what Bud Light wants to be when it claims ""drinkability""."
"Drinkability: Very high - this beer pairs well with food and is good on its own. The ABV is fairly low, and the the taste and mouthfeel are very balanced and smooth."
"Very nice clear light gold color. There is a lot of carbonation in this beer. Has an odd smell that I cant quite place, sweet but has a vegetabley? smell to it. Taste is different. Not sure how to place it. Reminds me of their grassroots ale. Light body. Low ABV. Not one of my favs from GL."
"D- What an enjoyable lager. This is very sessionable and just well done. The awards backing this brew has definitely been earned here."
"This is just a great brew and easily sessionable."
"It was very drinkable, but not my favorite offering that Great Lakes has."
"This is without a doubt one of the top 5 best lagers I've ever had. I prefer this over Great Lakes' other renowned lager, Eliot Ness. A real lager done right. Thank you, Great Lakes, for being so awesome."
"Bottle poured into pint glass. Pale to amber gold color, fizzy with head that dissipates quickly. Smell is lots of sweet honey with a small amount of hops. Taste is loaded with the honey as well: very sweet and malty with a small bitter hops bite in the finish."
"A bright clear golden color pour with a small white head,heavy carbonation but not too much in any way. Aroma is mildly floral,fruity,and just a bit hoppy. Flavor is much the same,a sweet malty backbone,peaches,floral hops,and a bit of some kind of spice. Lively mouthfeel,crisp and clean finish. Very good"
"Drinkability - Very high. This is one of my go-to lunch beers. At 5.8% it's great because it's packed with flavor without being too alcoholic. Try this stuff, you won't regret it."
"Two inch light tan head starts dropping kind of fast. The clear orange body shows a lack of carbonation. Definitely a hoppy aroma. Hops seem to be a mixture of grapefruity hops and floral hops. The taste is a perfect blend of caramel malts, floral hops, and a sizeable bitterness to round out the experience. Supremely drinkable, it was only in my glass for a couple minutes. If only I had another bottle of this great beer."
"Pick this one up. This was my first Great Lakes brew & I'm intrigued..."
"This one is so much better than the other Dortmunder I've had, Dab. Lots of character and flavor bursting from this one combined with high drinkability make it a keeper. Oh Great Lakes, please stop skipping over Indiana on your way to Illinois."
"I had the beer with a pork BBQ sandwich (mustard base) and I think it went very well, but, after finishing everything I saw the date on the bottle was 04/04/09 so now I wonder if my opinion (especially the smell) is more a reflection of the age of the beer or the meal I had with it. Either way it was quite good and I'll try it again (checking the date first) with something else and see how it goes."
"I've been drinking it nearly daily so long now that it is hard for me to describe its taste. I enjoy it from the bottle with most rich food. It goes particularly well with unseasoned steak."
"D- Outstanding drinkability...very easy to go through a few of these...it seems to be just the right mix of flavors and ABV"
"Gotta say, not a crazy lager head, but this is pretty damn good. Almost, just barely borders on too much hops, but it doesn't. Clean, crisp, refreshing with some malt and hops. Great stuff."
"Great drinkability, spot on for the style, damn near flawless"
"This is a very drinkable beer. Much more quaffable than a lot of American lagers out there."
"D- This would be a great session beer or something to sit back on a summer porch with. Definitely worth trying."
"Not since Troegs Hopback Amber has a flagship beer impressed me this much. Good stuff!"
"D- Drink it. Now."
"Drinkability would be rated high. Another fantastic beer from Great Lakes"
"Pretty solid beer, not very dynamic to me. A little too heavy feeling to want to drink more than one. Well balanced, but nothing to get too excited about."
"Just like their other beers, if GL was in my area I think I'd have them in my fridge at all times."
"Pours a golden color with a white head. Slight copper hue adds some extra color and a little bit of haze makes it unique as well. Aroma is biscuity and sweet similar to a pilsner. Slight metallic bitterness up front opens up to a more pilsner-like hop flavor. Dry at the end. Not overly bold, but great for sessioning."
"D: Very high. One tasty and smooth and easy drinking beer."
"D: This one is hard to put down, and after taking the first few sips of my first, I already know that I'd like another. Excellent drinkability. This is not to mention the fact that I'm in Chicago, where it's currently a blistery 29 degrees--I can't imagine how much more appropriate this'll be in the middle of the summer while grilling up a few items."
"Supremely drinkable. solid, solid brew."
"Good stuff"
"Dortmunder Gold... Very tasty beer. Poured in nicely with a good head and a continuous ringer.Very nice color for a lager, a bit darker than I thought it would be. Smelled almost like a dubbel. Pretty complex aroma with carmel hints and hops. Hops were smooth, smooth... Malt was balanced right. Good beer. Mouthfeel was above average, didn't leave much to be desired, but it wasn't unbelieveable. Very easy to drink. Good beer."
"D: Good beer, I don't know if it gets the gold metal on the bottle but it definitely gets a spot in my fridge."
"I.m enjoyin' the hell out of this mixed sampler pack from Great Lakes, not a single dud among the offerings. I poured this one into a glass and had about one and a half fingers of very light tan foam over an amber body with very light carbonation visible. The smell was unassumingly light of biscuits, honey, caramel and fruit, raisins or plums maybe. The hops take a back seat with just a hint of earthy pine and grass or sweet hay. The taste is the same, grainy toasty bread or biscuit, sweet toffee with just a hint of chocolate and fruit balanced with the bitterness of the hops. The feel is full and the finish is slightly dry and a bit sweet. Very good beer, I think I'll have another."
"M/D - a bit of a zippy bite with some nice carbonation and good taste"
"Overall: The mouth feel is has some carbonation and is a medium body. The finish is slightly sweet with a touch of bitterness, but very clean. The beer is very balanced and very good. There is some sulfur notes in the beer but it is not overwhelming, it just there."
"D: A nice craft lager, can easily be sessionable. If you like lagers this one will be more enjoyable to you. Recommended to those you are. What can I say, I'm a hophead..."
"The feel is smooth like honey, and buttery like an ale. Actually a nice save here. The taste is a little funky, a little too ""lagery"" for me. Not bad, just not great."
"High drinkability rounds this one out as a great lager overall."
"Clean and crisp, with a slightly nutty finish. Slightly hoppy off the bat, then we get biscuity, bready malts. Never too sweet at any points, and the finish is nutty behind a flowering of hops, slightly piny, nothing overbearing, nothing taking away from the very clean experience. Mouthfeel is surprisingly full for a beer like this, despite the overall light body. Everything stays crisp, and thanks to all this, remains very drinkable. An interesting treat, as my tastes seem to be gravitating towards the maltier and heavier. Definitely makes for a pleasant change of pace."
"A very good beer. Not as heavy as anticipated and one that could easily become sessioned."
"D: A great session beer, very easy, wanting more."
"D - This is definitely one of the hoppiest lagers I've ever had, which was surprising. Even with the extra hops, this remained extremely drinkable throughout. I can see why this still remains one of Great Lakes' flagship beers."
"drinkability was extremely high and had most of it gone before my food showed up"
"D: I am enjoying this brew considerably. High marks all around for the Great Lakes Dortmunder Gold offering. I'm really beginning to dig the GLBC. Nice job."
"Overall - Very Flavorful. Easy Drinker"
"Drinkability: A very drinkable brew. This one's light, crisp, refreshing, and highly quaffable, low in alcohol, and pretty darn tasty/aromatic. This is a supreme session brew."
"D: This is just a really well made beer. I'd be happy to drink this at any time and I'd also be happy to knock down a good few. A pretty darned nice session brew. I have yet to have a Great Lakes beer that I didn't like."
"As with the other Great Lakes beers, I wished that they would more often make the taps here in Boston. Even so, I gladly grab the bottles up when I can. Although not the top-shelve Dortmunder, this is definitely a great adherent to German brew-tradition. A rich dark golden pour with nice lace retaining head and malt aroma with a hint of orange-honey. The taste opens the malts to a hoppy clementine smooth flavor. Definitely a great summer beer."
"Overall it's very interesting and drinkable for a lager. Fairly nice balance and complexity. I don't know if I'm in love with it, but I'll certainly drink it and enjoy it."
"Wow this this brew take me by surprise. There is so much going here it is hard to remember that this is a lager. The pleasant hop profile ads some serious depth and I can easily say that this is far and away the best lager I have ever had."
"(D) Easy drinkability. Pairs well with stir fry."
"T; smooth, easy to drink, but will make you want to savor it. It's pricey here, but I plan to drink a lot more of these when I get a chance."
"This has to be the best tasting lager I have had to date. I can't get this in PA, so I conned my mom-in-law from Ohio to bring me some. This is definitely a drinker! It's a shame I can't get this in Altoona."
"date consumed: 15 Oct 2008"
"Drinkability: I am constantly reminded of what great beer Great Lakes makes. A solid, flavorful lager."
"Future outlook: Great Lakes....in state, always available, and more importantly, always good. We shall meet again!"
"The drinkability was pretty high for the ABV. I could drink 6 over a few hours, and I just might New Years Eve. Great beer as always from GLBC. BTW, the Second beer was just as good as the First..."
"I don't think I've ever had this style before so this should be interesting in one way or another. I got this from mashmaster which is irrelevant to the review but appreciated. Clear, bubbly, golden but not yellow with a good creamy head listing on top. Smells like lager and honeycrisps. Do you know what those are because I don't but that is what I smell. Nice flavor but I have a really hard time describing lagers. I definitely tasted a hint of hops. Overall, nice beer and if I wasn't so lager-ignorant this review might be more useful."
"A great beer. Would be good with a meal."
"Another great beer from the Great Lakes Brewing Company. Keep up the great work!!"
"D: This is really tasty. I actually prefer this from the bottle. When I've had it on tap, the hops have tended to dominate and the malts haven't shown up as much. This is near-perfectly balanced and very, very drinkable."
"D- One of the best lagers I've ever had. Would definitely recommend"
"I prefer a little more flavor, which is why I'm not much of a lager fan. But this is a good lager with a good amount of flavor."
"Nice crisp mouthfeel and medium body makes this excellent in drinkability. Nice malty concoction that finishes with a beautiful hop bitterness, begging you to drink more. This is a good lager. I'd get again."
"Mouthfeel is quite crisp yet smooth with a good hop bite adding to its refreshing qualir"
"D - Excellent overall. Great beer when I don't want something too complex that I need to think about. This beer is made for easy drinking and is extremely sessionable. Great beer with almost any food."
"This has a lot of depth to it - quite rustic to say the least and warmingly enjoyable. A few weeks playing with house money hasn't hurt this one too much."
"D: Not very complex, but a good beer for its style."
"There is a reason this beer is their flagship."
"Ok, so this is my first attempt at rating a beer, so I chose one I like. When you first pour this beer into your pint glass from the bottle, you immediately notice the very fine bubbles of the head. It doesn't tend to have a huge head, however. The beer is a coppery gold color with some deeper copper tones. The beer smells yeasty at first then settles down to some sweet malt tones. The taste is sharp at first, with a sweet malt note that finishes into a balanced hop bitterness that lingers on the tongue. The mouthfeel is crisp and bright, but smooths out quickly to a slightly velvet texture. This beer is very drinkable and consistent. It's a bar staple in the Cleveland area."
"Ultimately, I don't know. Maybe this is exactly the way it's suppose to be, but something doesn't seem right. Old (?), but it's not oxidized. No dating to determine. There seemed to be a funkiness to the aroma that didn't sit right with me. Otherwise drinks alright. I had hoped for better."
"I love how the flavors of the malt and hops can come through so cleanly on lagers."
"had it again two month later on tap... would like to get more of that astringent nature from the pilsner. there but not as prominent as i would like. mine be my saison arrogance."
"Poured a crystal clear amber golden color with a thin foamy tan head that didn't stick around. Not much lacing. The aroma is super malty, grainy, earthy and citric. The flavor is incredible and balanced. The malt flavor is sweet and earthy. Hints of caramel and a crazy tartness. The hops bite just enough! Creamy yet tingly medium feel. One of the most overall balanced (and at the same time complex) beers i have had."
"Pours a beautiful tawny gold with a medium sized fizzy/frothy head that dissipates in under a minute. Smells of light caramel and lemon with some nuttiness to it. The taste brings me right back to Germany. Very sweet, with a clean bittering presence throughout the sip. This is definitely a really unique beer. The caramel flavors are so appealing and so perfectly balanced by the malty sweetness. A nice medium/light mouthfeel keeps it nicely in between a pilsner and a pale ale. I only have one bottle of this left and I wish I just had a whole boot of it.. or at least a Maß."
"From a 12 ounce bottle - Pours a clear pale yellow with a tad of red. Below average carbonation, and only slight lacing. The aroma is dominated sweet malts and mild piney hops. First sip is surprisingly mild but balanced with not much else going on. A light malt backbone is welcomed. Some hoppy bitterness is present but on a whole this is only fair."
"The beer has some of the best aromatics of any beer I've tried. The taste is full-bodies and powerful and left me with a great after taste. Although many would consider it a sin, we were out of glasses so i drank this one right from the bottle. (says alot because it still smelled great without a proper glass.)"
"D- 5.8% is nice for an export. Definitely nice. Would have again."
"Pours a nice copper color with a small off-white head that left a small ring around the glass. The aroma has tea like characteristics, lemon, and grassy hop. The taste is of a honey malt, slightly bready, earthy tea like hops, and hard water. The feel is fairly light with a good amount of carbonation, finishes slightly bitter and dry. Not as bready as other Dortmunder brews that I have had and the hop flavor seems to be different. It's well balanced and drinks easy and has flavor. Good brew to session."
"D: This is really up there. A highly quaffable beer on a warm day (or any other day)."
"Pours a very nice clean/clear golden yellow color, very nice carbonation, awesome two finger white creamy head, lots of nice sticky lacing follows. The nose is malty, sweet, bready, floral. The taste is malty, slightly sweet, nice little hop/bitterness. Medium body. Very drinkable, this is an exceptional brew."
"D: not my personal favorite style, but given what it is and what it tries to be, it's an above average example of the style."
"Overall, an easy-drinking, full-flavored lager with a clean, yet complex character. I'd keep this in my fridge all the time if it were available to me. Bravo!"
"M/D - Light to medium bodied. Well carbonated and very crisp."
"This beer pours a shinny golden color. The head is one inch in height, and recedes slowly leaving a nice cap of lacing. The aroma is full of bready, biscuity malts with a noble hop edge. The taste is perfectly balanced. Soft yet flavorful. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with lively carbonation. Overall, this is a great beer. It would be great if more sessionable lagers like this were made here in America."
"This beer pours a dark gold with a white head that holds some wisps of foam and a ring on the top of the beer, leaving a bit of lace. The smell is of biscuit and caramel malts and a touch of german hops. The taste is fairly bitter with more of a german hops presence. The malt also has a nice sweet presence. The mouth feel is light-medium with effervescent carbonation. Overall a nice easy drinking beer with a nice hop presence."
"Tastes quite hoppy flavored over strong biscuit malt. Malt is drying overall, so the hops stand strong. Hallertauer or Liberty flavor on the hops with some dry weedy contribution. Hop bitterness is noticable, but reasonable amid the hop and malt flavor. The bitter is clean of grassy co-humulone, so it's quite nice. Carbonation is strong, which adds to the drying finish and gives a slight acrid tang to the aftertaste. Md mouthfeel results from a battle between dextrinous mouthfeel with the dried out malt. Plus strong carbonation lifts the beer off the tongue. Really nice."
"Could drink this till I pass out on the floor."
"Drinkability- This would easily be my go to lager if they sold it out here. Or at least my go to beer of this style for sure. Very tasty and quenching. Sessionable for sure as we went through a two six packs in two nights."
"Lovely deep golden lager that pours a very nice bubbly head and leave a nice lacing down the side of a pilsener glass, and continues to bubble with carbonation as you drink. The body of the beer is slightly hazy, which gives it an interesting and quite lovely appearance in the sunshine. The aroma is slightly malty, but the malt comes across more assertively on the palate. This one slides down very smoothly, leaving a crisp, slightly bitter, finish."
"Abundant in my neck of the woods, this beer is on tap at most of the local establishments. When in doubt I order a tall one knowing that I will be easily satisfied. Dortmunder Gold is perhaps the most popular of the Great Lakes Brewing Co.'s beers, and for good reason as it is well balanced and chances are your bud light drinking buddy will actually like this. In my opinion this is a great beer overall but I prefer many other beers made by this brewer. Pours a clean copper almost light amber color with a full head that tends to simmer down. Strong carbonation and lacing are always present. The aroma is appealing although very mild for my taste. A slight hop aroma is given off just enough to tickle the nose. The flavor is very good and extremely balanced, the malts and hops seem to be in perfect harmony. The mouthfeel is thicker than I expected which is good and this one finishes as strong as it begins, very refreshing and always a treat."
"pours an orangy yellow color with little head retention. compares pretty well to german lagers. higher in alcohol than my favorite lowenbrau. a good american impersonation of german beer. i love the great lakes brewing company. even though it expired a week before i bought it, it was still a good beer"
"Pours a great dark golden color with some nice (rapidly diminishing head) and great lacing. It has a great scent, very crisp and malty with a nice peppery spiciness to it. Great taste, a well balanced beer with great malt sweetness followed by a nice hoppy finish, hints of biscuit and pepper. It goes down very well, nice and refreshing, very clean and crisp."
"D - This is an excellent lager. One you don't want to put down."
"Pours a light gold in color with just a slight head forming on the pour. It's quickly gone after receiving my beer. Smell is very ""lagerish", but surprisingly with some nice piney hops. Taste is more of those nice hops. I'm not a big lager fan, but the hop flavor in this one really let me enjoy this beer. Clean and smooth on the taste. Good beer."
"Drinkability is obviously, outstanding. Every time I begin drinking this beer, I start wondering why I don't have cases and cases of this stuff stocked up for myself."
"Paleish orange color with gold hues, lively action inside the body, and a big frothy head give this beer a good first impression. The aroma is sweet with ripe grapes and some dry grain. Taste: oohh, this is refreshing. And very tasty. It's a mix of dry biscuit, raw hop and citric, drying grain, and tones of lemon. The refreshmnet factor is great in this beer, couples with a very good flavor, makes me want more of this beer. Too bad Great Lakes beer is a rarity in SoCal (purchased at Lone Hill Liquor, Glendora, CA)."
"Prosit, MK"
"Mouthfeel is smooth finishing... light, but not watery... finishes much cleaner than most lagers. Feels well aged."
"Awesome lager; it has an excellent array of spicy notes, many of which are unidentifiable, as well as a flavor of caramel. This beer is very smooth on the pallet and provides a decent amount of mouth-feel especially for the style. It has just the right amount of hops, which provide a bitter sensation at the center (longitudinally), spanning from the back to the middle (back to front) of the tongue. I've had this beer out of both a stange, and a pint glass. It is better tasting out of the pint glass, at the expense of the superior aroma from the stange."
"Had this beer for the first time aproximently 7 months ago. It was good, but it was one of four amazing great lakes products that made great seem ordinary. 7 months and 80 beers later, I realized how spoiled I was that night and bought It again. The beer pour a bright golden and has a very flavorful smell. The smell is not misleading as the flavor is both light and not overwhelming, but has an enjoyable bite and goes down well. Though it feels light, I'm not sure its a real session beer, though I'm sure it will work that way. If you love beer and are visiting Ohio, buy a great lakes sampler that includes this beer. You wont be disappointed."
"D - Great here. Easily a really drinakable session beer. Very good example of the style. Have had this in bottles also and is good also."
"Drinkability: This is a session beer, being raised as I was on shit American lagers, having some great lagers in the rotation is a must, I can't do big beers all the time, this is a great option."
"D - Now I know why there were only two in the sampler 12-pack: they were keeping the extras for themselves! Very drinkable beer."
"While I didn't enjoy Dortmunder quite as much as Eliot Ness, it is still a damn good Lager and beer. Another solid offering from GLBC."
"Nice beer,best of the lager catagory I have ever tasted.I would love for Great Lakes to be sold in Phila."
"D: Super high drinkablily, this beer has got just about everything anyone might be looking for. It's light enough to have a couple but not so light as to be uninteresting and thin. Its got malt sweetness galore but has an aggressive enough hop profile to keep hop heads interested as well."
"Poured attractive clear dark golden color with generous white head that lingered a while. Aroma was a pleasant balanced of malt and hops. Flavor was nicely malty with a good hop presence as well. Slightly sweet. Excellent session beer that I look forward to enjoying more of. Very refreshing."
"Notes: It is just darn good and very drinkable."
"This is a great beer to pull out and shove in the face of those who say ""boo"" to light colored beers."
"Medium to full bodied, very clean, very malty, very easy to drink, and very well balanced; just about perfect. This one delicious beer and pairs well with the dog days of summer."
"Well-carbonated, good body. Quite drinkable. Nothing really outstanding here, but a pretty solidly made beer."
"A exellent lager, but I don't think the germans would call it a classic example of a dortmunder."
"A good go-to Export Lager for watching the Brewers struggle on the tryptic flat screens."
"This beer is a great example of the style and comes highly recommended."
"D : No complaints, one I would definitely drink again....and again"
"Drunk from a 12oz. bottle into one of my many pint glasses. Has a pretty clear gold color to it. Head is a nice one finger white. Smell tons of rich malts. Kinda has that lager smell to it as well. Taste is very smooth and creamy all the way through. Little crisp twang in the back. Sweet malts and some citrusy hops come together for a great balance. Never had this style before, but I was extremely pleased. Desreves that gold medal on the label."
"Dortmunder Gold is a classic. It's obviously Great Lakes Brewing's flagship beer and it doesn't disappoint. Personally, I don't think it's their best beer. But, it's damn fine and is a great representation of the style. Perhaps the best. It's certainly one you can't miss."
"D- Refreshing and incredibly easy to drink."
"D - Very clean, easy drinking lager with substantially more flavour than most."
"Notes: No complaints about this one, an excellent lager with tons of flavor."
"Poured a bottle into the chalicesque glass the bar provided. Has this many time before and the quality has alwas been consistent. Nice golden clear color with healthy head. Sharp hop aroma and taste. Very crisp feeling in the mouth. This isn't my favorite style but it does what it tries to do very well. A solid beer."
"D: Such a smooth beer, great for a nice summer day drinking all day."
"Very drinkable could easily do a quite a few of these of these. a great lager that I wouldn't mind drinking again"
"D- I like Dorts a lot and this one hit the spot. Very deserving of its gold. I would certainly not hesitate to pick this up and consider this highly quaffable. Kudos Great Lakes - Great ale and Lager maker - This is what I call a refreshing beer."
"Yum, I wasn't expecting much, but this sucker is crisp and mighty tasty. It appears a clear, brilliant gold with a bit of white lacing. The aroma is of lager tamd and sour, pale biscuity grain. That same sort of sourdough flavor carries through with a balanced but rich hops kick of grassy spice and grinding citrus rind bitterness. Really, this is beer is a treat and a nice alternative to pilsners when I want a hoppyi-sh lager."
"Bottle thanks to nrbw23. Poured a deep golden color. Medium head with lacing on the glass. This is my first Dortmunder style and I'm liking it. Kind of a cross between a Helles and a Pilsner. Pleasant mouthfeel and just enough hops to know they are there. Clean aftertaste. I could drink a lot of these. This beer would be exceptional on tap."
"D- solid lager, a great stand by"
"Notes: This is the flagship beer for Great Lakes and a very solid offering."
"This is what a good lager should taste like. A definite must for the summer."
"D,notes: The perfect gateway beer for the BMC crowd. Having been out of the Cleveland area for close to a decade with occasional visits home, I have watched this and some other Great Lakes beers slowly become more and more prevalent in bars. It has also slowly become the beer of choice for many of my friends."
"So drinkable. Completely defies my lager impression. A top notch beer and the best lager I have ever had."
"This is a very good, light flavored American lager. It is very drinkable, which caused my glass to empty very quickly."
"D: This is the perfect summer beer. I wish i had more of it."
"drinkability is great. this is a very well refined dortmunder, with complexity and richness seldom seen in a lighter lager. well done by Great Lakes. cheers!"
"D-I really like this beer, nicely balanced with a light body, not watery, and very refreshing."
"Morey's Bottom Line: I would have no problem drinking this beer, and being proud of it. Highly Recommended for Lager and Ale drinkers!"
"D- good all around, this one gets an A+ in drink for sure, year round, hot or cold, this is some drinkable stuff."
"I've had this both on bottle and on tap, but I'll limit the review to on tap. This is an absolutely delightful beer (yes, I said 'delightful'). Rich and full of flavor; the beer pours out golden with an deep amber hugh. The scent is very grainy, or as a friend who also tried it said ""that's what beer is supposed to smell like"". It is wonderful in the mouth, and easy to drink. Those new to drinking ""premium"" beers may be put off by the taste, but I fell in love with the first glass."
"Nice & drinkable, it goes down easy. Nothing outstanding, but like other GL selections it balances both quality & accessibility to please both purists and your average beer drinker."
"Drinkability: A very nice, easy drinking Dortmunder. I'd say I would have it around regulary, but Great Lakes beers are regrettably unavailable in my state."
"Finishes mostly dry with a good hop puckering in the end as well. I thought this was okay. Not too familiar with the style, but I think I could grow to like this one. Easy drinker for sure."
"Wow, what a lager! This beer is expertly crafted and is the benchmark for this style. It is beautifully balanced and it has a considerable depth to the flavors. Although the abv may be just a little high, I think this would make an excellent session beer. Definitely a top notch lager. I would recommend it to anyone."
"Pours copper/golden color with a large white frothy head. It has a little sweet and malty aroma and the taste is very nice for the style full body. There was a slight bitter aftertaste and is a nice beer for a light lunch."
"The body is close to mid than light. I would have liked to see it finish lower with more of a crispness as there is a lot of sweetness especially for style. There is a definite yeasty finish that is offset and really is a deterrent. Overall a good beer but a lot of tangibles that are missed here, then again this is a very difficult beer to brew."
"This beer had a great color; khaki, golden, and crisp. Had a nice white head with decent carbonation. The aroma was grainy, and like others who rated this beer, it had notes of biscuit and oatmeal. A very drinkable/ session beer. I highly suggest this beer to have as a staple in your fridge."
"Pours a clear amber with a nice whitish head. Nose is sweet in nature, but doesn't seem overly complex. Flavor is sweet, but not overpoweringly so. Also seems to fade over time so that it doesn't kill the experience. Noticeable grain tones that grow as it warms. Feel is smooth on both ends. This is easily drinkable, though not very complex. The higher sweet tone might be a bit much for some people."
"To me this tastes like another typical export lager. Good over all but nothing that makes it stand out above the rest."
"12 oz bottle. Pours copper with a 1 cm foamy off white head. Aroma is mostly malts, some lemon and some strange nut or woodiness. Initial flavor is covered by the malts, ends with hops and spice. Some decent lacing, noted carbonation, light on alcohol. Light to medium mouthfeel but adequate for the style. Drinkable and one of the better options from GL."
"This beer crossed me as one of those gratuitous light beers that a brewpub will have to appease the Bud drinkers and draw them to the next level., so I've been rather hard on it for years. I apologize. This is a real world class beer to be reckoned with (OK, enjoyed)."
"D: So easy to consume - the quintessentially drinkable lager. One I'd have on hand all summer long were it available out here. Thanks to vwcraig."
"Had this on tap at the Hopleaf. Poured amber with a deceent head and excellent lacing. Smelled of lager yeast with a slightly grainy sweetness. Happily, the taste is a good deal more interesting with slightly sweet flavors of vanilla and banana, more lager yeast, and a slight, but pleasant graininess. Uber smooth and a bit soft in the mouth. This is truly delicious and easy to drink. I like this style, even though I usually drink ales, and this is a beautiful interpretation of it. A little fruitier, and richer and fuller than some while keeping the abv in check. Great beer."
"Overall I liked this one; it was a nice classic German lager with a good hop kick in the back. A nice little different one for me in the midst of everything being so complex with different things added and different temperatures. Sometimes you just want to grab something and not have to think about it. Here you go; this is the one for that."
"Drinkability: A delicious and very drinkable lager  best Dortmunder I have run across. This brewery and this beer in particular were a very pleasant surprise to find while on vacation in Ohio."
"Drinkability is great. Strong beer, but very easy to drink."
"Possibly the best Dortmunder around."
"This was a very bright, clean, and enjoyable beer. Although all facets were above average, the combined effect turned out to be slightly better than the individual components."
"Let me first say that I am a very big fan of Great Lakes Brewing Co. They are quite possibly my favorite brewing co. in the USA but I have to be honest, maybe this was just spoiled (they don't pasteurize) or an old batch. I was thoroughly unimpressed with this beer. The only thing I could compare this too would be a thick version of Miller High Life. Pale, foamy head that quickly dissipates, and a bit funky. I may try this again down the road and re-rate it to balance it out but otherwise a huge letdown."
"Pours a clear light copper hue with a one finger white head that quickly dies down to a thin layer of bubbles. Small amounts of lacing on the sides of the glass, nothing to write home about. Smell is almost like a smoked caramel malt with a hint of white grapes. Some corn like aromas emerge as well. Just a pleasant smelling beer overall. Taste is of mild buttery biscuit, mild caramel malt, and mild citrus hop. Overall, this one is extremely balanced with an amazing bouquet of flavors. Aftertaste is pretty weak, but has hints of grain and wheat. Light to medium body with a fair carbonation. Very interesting brew, it grew on me after a few sips. Definitely worth a shot, I look forward to comparing Great Lakes to other breweries version of this style."
"Over this could be a nice session beer if it wasn't for the slightly high ABV."
"Pours a clean yellow/ orange-ish color with a white head. Aromas of a small malt, but not much going on. In the taste, again just a small maltiness, but not much to say. A very small bitter mouthfeel and a light malty aftertaste. Very clean, good for a palate clensor. Very similar to a macro lager."
"Copper colored. Initially poured with a 1"" foamy head which quickly disipated to a bubbly layer. It is a bit darker than many other lagers suggesting a richer flavor. The aroma comes across as sweet and malty. The taste is rich for a lager. Sweet on the tongue with an unremarkable finish. It doesn't feel thin in the mouth but rich and viscous. Not a spectacular beer but a very drinkable beer for most occasions."
"While I prefer ales to lagers, this is a great beer. The Great Lakes Company provides yet another great offering."
"Pours a clear dark copper color with very little carbonation. The head starts out thick and foamy but thins out to a thick lace. Smell sweet, but isn't very strong and aromas a pretty minimal. Taste is biscuity and quite dry. Mouthfeel is highly carbonated and has a bitter aftertaste. This is the second time having this beer, but only the first time reviewing. This is much better than I remember it."
"The bottom line: A simple yet tasty offering by Great Lakes, the very definition of a sessionable beer to me."
"Very easy to drink, not a complex beer by any standards, but perhaps the best Dortmunder I had. Will get a few for next spring/summer."
"Had this beer while at Slows BBQ. Beer was from a 12 ounce bottle and poured to a nice golden color, very clear with a fair sized off white head that had some retention till it broke down leaving a nice ring of froth along the sides. The aroma is of malt with some clear hop scent which is a little surprising based on the style. The taste is nice, malt flavors come out from the start, they are quote pronounced. They mix nice with a slight fruit flavor and a slight hop presence. Overall this is a nice brew, another excellent offering from Great Lakes, I really wish we could get this stuff in NY!"
"Drinkability: could do two in a night"
"D: Very easy to drink and very tasty. Glad I have more of these."
"Overall-Quite possibly the best example of the style I have had and maybe the best lager I've every had."
"I tried this bad boy at the Hard Rock Cafe in downtown Cleveland. I drank with brunch that was served before the Browns/Ravens game. This beer was fresh! This is brewed only a few miles from where it was served. It pours a nice copper color: yellowish-partially unfiltered looking. It has a nice zing that dances on the tongue but does not linger for to long. This beer can be enjoyed on any occasion. I think I will pick up a sixer of this for my next bbq."
"Pretty awesome beer, especially because it was free"
"All I can say about this, another fine brew from a fine brewery."
"Pours a clear light golden amber color with a loose full finger white head that resists fading. Spotty lacing in its wake. The smell is rich and malty. Medium bodied, the mouth feel is adequately carbonated. Full flavored, the biscuity malt taste and balanced crisp character resonates with a fresh light bitterness through the finish. A wonderful drinker."
"This is a robust, first class lager."
"The beer pours a nice golden color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a light pale malt scent along with a faint hop aroma. It's dry with just a hint of malt sweetness. The taste is decent. It has a very smooth pale malt flavor that goes down so easy and finishes dry and hoppy. I wish it wasn't as bitter as it is. The malt bill seems just about perfect. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a low/medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a decent lager. I love the malt flavor, but I'm not a huge fan of the hop character in this one."
"D- A fresh beer for summertime enjoyment. A good session beer. So many readers dislike lagers, this is a very good one."
"Drinkability: Awesome. This beer is well balanced and would pair well with many foods."
"D: A good lager with some complexity. I could have a couple of these."
"A little dry, but nice on a summer day."
"Pours a nice string gold color. Smells of malts and hops very nice malted scent. Very tasty beer with refreshing malt and hops and not too citrus. Hints of pepper and spices very refreshing. Great mouth feel balance between great flavors and refreshing beer."
"Nice big white head. Clear gold color. Nice lacing all down the glass. Exactly what one thinks of when thinking of lager beer. Very nice malty smell with a slight hop aroma. Great full flavored taste. Nothing is too much, a very good balanced beer. Leaves no sour aftertaste and is not overly drying either. This is a very easy drinking beer that could be had all day long."
"A average brew, hence the straight threes. A clear golden brew with a fair head that recedes to a light covering and leaves little lacing. The smell is corn. There is also some medicinal aftertaste but it is not too harsh and doesn;t affect the drinkability of the brew. Overall a fair beer that is light and easy to drink. A sessionable brew for sure."
"D: Excellent beer from the crew at Great Lakes. The malty flavors and crisp hop finish are excellent for a muggy summer day."
"Into a pint glass, pours a clear light copper gold, a nice but small off-white head forming and holding at a solid film, not much lacing. The aroma is spicy hops first, toasty grainy malts second. Pretty decent, but not assertive. The taste is crisp and refreshing, drying toward the end, a nice balance of bittering hops with noble spices and slightly toasted but definitely grainy malts. Very refreshing indeed, a good beer to have a number of in the fridge, particularly this time of year."
"Overall, this beer was a rather light, refreshing, palate cleansing and easy-drinking offering. At the same time, it was flavorful enough to keep my interest. It also paired perfectly with my pizza and would go well with a variety of pub fare."
"D: Easy, quaffable, on par with the best German lagers, would be a great crossover beer for novice beer drinkers, it's bitter, shows the hops but inviting."
"Drinkability: An everyday beer, to be sure."
"all around (and trying not to be biased) I have to say it's a great beer. a great dortmunder."
""
"***purchased the bottle at ""On Stage"" (I think that was the name) a restaurant in Concourse C at the Cleveland Airport and smuggled the bottle through security."
"Got this one in a GL Taster. Pours a nice copper gold color with a head that disappears disappointingly fast. Nose is strong on hops and some grain, along with some light banana. Taste is fairly similar; lots of grain, some light citrus, and some drying hops again at the back. Body is a touch thin, but overall solid on carbonation. This one is a tasty one that I'd drink again, although in my opinion it didn't top the Elliot Ness or Edmund Fitzgerald that were also in the taster."
"D: Very high. Especially on a hot, humid Ohio evening."
"Two Thumbs Up."
"Very easy drinking, a great brew for a hot day. Smooth, crisp, well balanced. Will have to pick up more for the up comming summer"
"Medium mouthfeel with a good bit of carbonation to make it crisp. Goes down really easy but still quite flavorful."
"Overall, not a bad brew, fairly accurate for the style. Possibly it falls a bit short in the hops end of the equation. Nonetheless, worth a try."
"Wonderfully drinkable. This one stands out for the style. A friend of mine recently brought this back from Ohio. If it were available around here, it would be a staple in my fridge for the hot summer days. A well-deserved medal winner!"
"I'm a Hellas fan, and this has a nice west coast apa/ German Hellas combo goin on, and the biiter/rosey aftertaste is like some 'dortmunder badge of honor'... Da%# this beers good."
"D: Still an excellent beer, very easy to drink but not simple. I think just about any beer drinker could appreciate this. Highly recommended."
"Feeling light to medium bodied, this still is a very refreshing and clean brew. It makes me actually proud to be an Ohio native! This is a great session brew and pairs great with our hot Ohio summers."
"Overall, this is a good Dortmunder example. The style is characterized by balance and I really think this fits the bill. It's a great 'introductory' beer to craft brew for those who are new. Kind of a stronger and all-barley malt version of the common American-style lager. I find it enjoyable and very well-done, but I don't think it would be my first choice if presented with some of Great Lakes other tasty brews."
"The Dortmunder Gold pours into my pint glass a brilliant clean gold liquid, the thin sparse head left some lacing. Smell is sweet bready malt with a hint of hops. Taste is malty and sweet, but to a perfect degree. The hops make their presence known by helping the brew stay dry and clean on the palate.One of the lightest beers I've had that still held a TON of character. Very drinkable,"
"Very crisp beer as per the lager profile. Looked good, tasted good and was enjoyed all except for that smell. Who knows, maybe that's just my upper lip. Oh snap."
"D -- There's a lingering, heavier malt character in the aftertaste that keeps the flavor from being clean and refreshing and thus more drinkable. It's not a bad beer at all, just not as drinkable as I remember."
"D- I will have this again. It was quite tasty and goes down easy. Its a great refreshing brew that goes with any meal and is great at any time of the year. espicially summer."
"Poured out a straw gold color with a thin white head. The nose was mostly fresh grain, not much else. The taste was very well balanced, some light malt and light hop notes. Had a light but bitter finish. Light bodied, medium carbonation. Overall, this was a solid beer."
"This is a very tasty and refreshing lager. I used to drink it often when I was first crossing over from lesser brews. Another very solid offering from an often ignored brewer."
"Mouthfeel is crisp and doesn't get bogged down by any resin-like sensation from the hops. This is the very epitome of a session brew; I can't believe it's been since before I was a BA that I've had this last. I'll be sure not to wait so long next time."
"One of the best lagers I've tried... If this were available in Nebraska, it would be a regular visitor to my house... especially on my deck on a hot summer night. Quite good."
"I usually tire of the taste after drinking a few lagers, but this is exceptional."
"Drinkability: Clearly to style but I'm just not a big fan of Dortmunder Lagers"
"Pours a clear golden. Nice white head,with excellent retention,and lacing. Lots of bubbles! Smell is bread,and roasted malt,with some floral hops. Body is medium,and carbionated. Taste is crisp with a nice mix of malt and hops. Smooth,and refreshing. You will want to have more than one!"
"Best before 7/02/2007. Poured into a pilsner glass, this lager is a pumpkin-gold hue with steady, active carbonation and a thin but resilient light-ecru head. Soft grain aromas, like cold whole wheat flour mixed with floral hop notes. A bready sweetness greets the palate up front before being washed over by a spicy and citric hop melange with a bit of sulfuric metal twang near the back. A smooth and full biscuity malt flavor rounds out the finish. Clean and dry mouthfeel with a subtle pepperiness on the palate. Refreshing but not too light -- satisfying, to be sure. A highly flavorful and more than reliable session lager. Nicely done."
"Overall, the drinkability is better than average... It left a pronounced film in my mouth. I wasn't so keen on the after taste.... but this one is worth another try."
"Michael Jackson once wrote that this was one of his top 10 favorite american beers. I can see why."
"D: Very smooth and easy drinking session lager. Thicker than I thought it was going to be, but that doesn't take away from it's session qualities. I like this one."
"This is a style I generally love and I tried Great Lakes with expectations of greatness..."
"Clear light copper color and a firm one finger off white head that retains nicely. The nose exhibits floral hops, grains, tart and biscuity yeasts, and a mild sweetness. Hop characters very smoothed out with fresh florals and fruit, like mango, and a delicate spice. Pale malts balance well allowing the mellow hop notes to come through clearly. Slightly twangy yeast tones and faint citrus give way to a dryness towards the end quaff. Thin body and medium carbonation yields a semi-smooth mouthfeel with minimal fizzing. The finish has a lasting sweetness with dry roasted grains biscuit notes hanging in for a bit."
"Dortmunder Export is too sweet for my liking, and it doesn't fit the classic DAB style. The lager, while showing plenty of good features (smoothness, appearance, body and carbonation) , the taste profile is out of balance. Way too sweet."
"Tastes of a rich, dark, toasted malt, lightly biscuity, and a slight hint of caramel. Very smooth. Finishes off sweet and inviting for the next sip."
"The galss emptied very quickly showing great drinakability. A nice change of pace beer that is very refreshing with going over-the-edge."
"D- Before I knew it, this beer was almost gone. Very easy going beer. I was surprised to see that this was 5.8%."
"Glowing deep golden, clean, clear, with a small, gauze-y, off-white head. Toffee, sweetbread, cooked/caramelized vegetables, alongside spicy, floral hops. Very nice! Honey toast and spicy hop bitterness interplay up front. Cooked veggie tang picks up. Sweetish fruit cake before herbal, spicy hop finish takes over. Echoes of honey malt down the hatch. Moderate body, with an oily feel. Very full-flavored lager that has excellent balance. Should be a goto quaffer at your local Midwestern tavern...that'll be the day! (some day, I hope)."
"Taste is refreshing and mild. Mouthfeel is crisp and refreshing, making this beer highly sessionable."
"Wow really great lager and I'm not the biggest lager drinker. From the bottle pours out golden in color with a good carbanation level. Aroma of sweet maltness. Taste sweet malt, mild bitterness and hop undernotes. Medium/light body, more than light but not medium. Crisp,refreshing this is a good session beer. Or the first beer of the day. I like start out with a less aggressive beer first, but not all the time. Dont start with an Stone AB then switch to a Dortmunder, not a good idea."
"On tap, its tough to find a better beer. This stuff is what beer is meant to be. Starts off with a rocky, silky smooth, and withstanding head retention. Follows up with a golden / orange hue with a clean, clear look. Smells and tastes very fruity with oranges, peaches, and appricots. Very ripe and fresh. Quite hoppy with the English variety, showing very stable citrus and pine flavors, but with no real aggression. Very smooth and clean to drink. An ultimate thirst quincher. Plenty of character, but never offensive. Simply a great brew."
"drinkability is good. i think i enjoyed the Eliot Ness i had earlier more, but that's more my personal preference."
"Drinkability - always have this on retainer. great beer to give to friends!"
"Poured smooth into a pint glass pale honey colored with a tinge of red. Light clean aroma after swirling glass. Deliciously bready malt with an nice hoppy overtones, not quite citrusy. Very smooth and drinkable, yet not without a little carbonation on the tounge. Lingering lightly bitter flavor. Very Nice"
"Ahhh- a golden ale without that over-hopped citrus spray. An even keel blend of bready malts and hops and a kiss of honey and faint citrus sweetness that doesn't paralyze or send the tongue off into oblivions of taste but goes down with an easy hit of cleanness. I now know what Sylvia Plath meant when she said ""The snows of the Tyrol, the clear beer of Vienna Are not very pure or true."" No they aren't, not like this golden by-product of the German Purity Law."
"Pours golden straw with an impressive, yet diminishing head. Aroma is just okay in my book. Very faint minerally aroma, no hops present. Flavor is grassy and minerally, well, I guess it's balanced, and to style, but I don't think it's my cup of tea. Maybe it's hard water or something, but it's not hitting the spot with me. I do get some catty hops with the flavor, but it's out of balance, instead of malt, I get hops and mineral water. I will admit, this isn't the freshest sample, but it's not yet past it's best before date. Perhaps I will seek out a fresher sample at some point."
"I got this with the Great Lakes sampler pack, poured a very golden color with good head retention and lacing. Like the fact that they stuck with the German Purity laws in this brew. Taste was ery good, i was a little drunk when I had this one last night, so I won't go into detail on the flavor. Mouthfeel was virtualy perfect with great carbonation to boot, which infuenced the drinkability nicely. Good brew."
"I poured this 12oz bottle into a pint glass. Very nice golden in color slight head. Sweet biscuity, very drinkable. I would like to try it on tap before stacking it up against some of the other dortmunders I have had. Expected a bit more velvety sweetness that I have experienced in others."
"This is well deserving of the Gold. Cheers GLB!"
"Drinkability- Very impressive and very drinkable. One of my favorites."
"D: This beer has a simplistic taste, isn’t filling at all, and is extremely easy to drink. It’s a very poundable beer."
"Fantastic lager! A superb ""drinking"" beer. Easily accompanies many dishes. Highly versatile, dangerously consumable."
"Very drinkable, very good. Let it warm up to enjoy the its full spectrum of characteristics. Viva GLBC."
"The pour into my Spaten becker glass raises a one finger off white head that falls slowly to a glass ring. Lacing is sudsy. The color is a dark golden/copper. The nose is mildly floral from the hops, and very grainy-sweet from the malt. Taste is of a restrained sweetness, that manages to be mildly bitter and bready throughout. Very nice, clean, and simple. Finishes dry and cereal-like, with a slight hint of its elevated alcohol content. Mouth is a bit thick, and the carbonation is high but very fine, lending a sharp, refreshing kick to the beer. This is a very enjoyable lager. I almost wish I bought a case, like my neighbor."
"Eric"
"Mouthfeel was raspy. Zesty tingle when held in the mouth for a moment. Pleasant. I will come back for more."
"Thanks to Dertbert for providing the sample."
"D: Pretty good light bodied beer, very pleasantly surprised by this beer, would have this one again."
"Poured with a white creamy head.about an inch,clings to the side of the glass.A golden color with a reddish hue.Has a sweet,bisquity aroma,not any real hop aromas.Has a slight bisquity,sweet malty taste,very smooth.A slight fruity taste,A quick sharp,nice tart finish.The mouthfeel is between light and medium.A very drinkable,and refreshing beer."
"Very crisp and clean. Nice mouthfeel. Light bodied without being watery. Leaves you wanting more. Excellent, tasty lawn mower beer."
"Pours out a nice dark gold/amber color, with nice head which holds well and laces all the way down. Smell is full of some malt, with a coffee/caramel undertone. Taste is nice and smooth, with malt at the front, and a decent hoppy finish. Mouthfeel is medium, crisp and smooth finish. Very nice beer."
"D-Another easily drinker from G.L. Nicely balanced and smooth."
"Cheers2Beers"
"This is a high quality beer."
"Pours a very nice golden amber color with a decent head, good retention, and almost zero lacing (poured from a glass into a mug). The smell is very malty, fruity, and citrusy. The taste goes along with the smell. This is a very tasty beer, with a very malty, fruity, citrusy flavor to it. Not very bitter. Nice, dry, and crisp....perfect amount of carbonation and a moderate amount of mouthfeel. A very delicious, drinkable beer (whether on-tap or in the bottle). Drink this beer."
"Nice golden color with a white head that fades to a nice film that coats the glass with each sip. Smell is very bready with a nice floral note. Very pilsner like aroma. Taste is very malty with a spicey pepper finish. Very dry mothfeel. Probably the best lager i've had in a long time. Another winner from Great Lakes."
"Very nice lager. Pours great with a fair amount of lacing and a great copper color. The smell is light and satisfying, but the best part of this beer is the taste. The taste compliments the nose very well with hints of floral and a little hoppiness. It's very crisp and extremelly satisfying. Like most Great Lakes brews this one didn't disappoint. I had this with fresh lake walleye and it was just a really great compliment. All in all, this is what I am looking for in a lager. Try one if you get the chance."
"The aroma mirrors the taste in that there is a hint of floral tones to it, but the beer also has a very nicely balanced hop and malt taste. The hops bring a sharpness to the beer's taste, while the malt smooths out the feel. While the taste favors the hops, there malt serves as a counterbalance, and due to the floral influences, plays off the hops nicely. A more bitter hop would just dominate and you would lose the malt altogether. Here, the contrast is nice, and it makes for a very drinkable beer."
"The taste is great. I could drink this stuff all day long. Has the same high ester profile followed by a great hops bitterness that meets the sweet esters in the middle. Very crisp and clean. Beautiful aftertaste. This beer reminds me of how much I love a good lager, but there is no way even this beer can subtract from my love of ale. Don't get me wrong, however, I LOVE me a good lager."
"Starts with big sweet fruit that moves into grassy biscuits that end on a nice node of hay and sunshine. Crisp and clean and with a distinct node of grass so, like most good gold lagers, it tastes like you're walking through a field at sundown."
"The beer arrived as an amber-gold colored liquid with a one-finger white head. The aroma is an enticing mix of malt and hops, both somewhat mild in intensity, but well balanced. The malt aroma is soft, with a slightly toasted and sweet-smelling quality. The taste is mildly sweet, with the lightly-roasted malt and fleeting caramel forming the foretaste. The finish is composed of a floral hop presence and a solidly balanced bitterness. The body is medium-light, with a very clean finish. This is a terrific and refreshing drinking beer. I wish I had it on the golf course."
"Seems like a good example of the style, a nice beer, and a good way to introduce macro drinkers to the joys of craft beer."
"Poured from a bottle to a reddish copper color with thick white head that lingered through mid-glass and gave way to decent lacing. Aroma was mostly hops, but I also detected hints of honey and fruit..possibly cherry. A slightly fruity, spicy flavor, and a very good finish. A most enjoyable beer."
"D: Although this isn't the strongest lager ever, its simple flavors and smooth carbonation make it excellent for drinking. Rich texture that makes this a lager I would gladly reach for - this could easily become one of my trusted stand-bys."
"I don't like this style, so maybe I'm not being fair, but this one is just kinda watery. Very thin bodied, although drinkable, with some odd aftertaste. Couldn't figure it out. Hey there are plenty of worse beers out there and Great Lakes is a terrific brewery, I'd just chose another one."
"Another winner from Great Lakes. Great malty character. Definitely worth a try."
"A nice drinkable lighter beer."
"Opinion: This is a surprisingly good beer. I like the balance of the malt and hops, and this beer passes itself off as a good representation of the style. The malt is a little ""raw"" in my opinion, and would likely benefit from a bit more processing during the mash. This would probably help the clarity also. Regardless, this is a good beer and one that I would drink again."
"I'm going to buy a few more and try them on a hot summer evening, as it seems it would be particularly refreshing."
"Overall: Plain and simple another great brew from Great Lakes. The crisp flavors are true to style and the dry ending is superb. Quite a good beer."
"Not highly carbonated, but a little more than I would like. Still, not too bad. Perfect mouthfeel. An easy drinking balanced lager that would be perfect for a BBQ or football game. This is the rich-man's Budweiser."
"Beer poured from a bottle into a pint glass. Beer is a medium redish/amber, transparent with a small head and a little bit of lacing. Smell is sweet/malty and a little bready. Taste, umm, what the hell? Where did these hops come from? A Pale Ale like hop quality is the dominant factor here, but the bready malts also come through in force, making this a full drinking beer. Mouthfeel is very nice and drinkablity is just as good. I'm not familiar with the style, but to me this tastes like a Pale with a better malt profile. Very good beer."
"D: There is a reason this is sold everywhere, most stores, even the smallest gas stations and quick marts usually stock this one next to BMC. Again, not my preference because of price, but. like tonight, it was on the way home and I knew it was quality."
"Drinkability - this goes down very easy. This would be a good session beer anytime."
"I do see from the BA style notes that this one, with the dry tones and bitterness, meets the style requirements!"
"A nice beer overall, but not as good as I hoped. Seemed out of balance to me. As far as I know it's the only Dortmunder I've ever had, so I could be off base. Definitely worth a try if you can find it."
"over all a great everyday drinking beer, maybe you could convert a macro drinker with this one?"
"Good hop character with firm malty malts. Slightly spicy flavor and once again very clean-love Great Lakes ingredients. The cleanliness of these beers makes the whole line including this Dortmunder very easy drinking yet complex beers."
"Good drinkability but I do wonder how many of these I could drink without getting tired of it. Tasty a full flavored lager beer."
"Poured into a pint glass, it was Goose Island, I don't have a Great Lakes pint glass... Light golden, borderline amber body that is very clear, lively carbonation goes to the top, the head was thick, but goes away within a few minutes. The nose is very grassy, almost smells like fresh cut hay, a little yeasty, European bread smelling. Strong grassy taste on the tongue, blends into a slight spiciness, a dry nutty taste with a clean finish with just the slightest hop spice lingering in the mouth. It is criminal that I can't get this beer around here anymore, I hate the distributor!"
"A deep golden color with a nice white head that laces beautifully. The slight sweet aroma of amlt and then a solid dose of hops comes in at the end. The taste is excellent, the malt flavor is strong and not dominated by hops, well balanced flavor. In the mouth it feels heavy for a lager, which is medium bodied. This beer is exceptional, fantastic flavor and crispness, a great choice for session beer. I use this beer on alot of bmc drinkers, as an introduction to craft beer. This is a great beer to take camping and watching the campfire."
"Great Lakes Brewery's first bottled beer, and far and away their best seller. Poured from bottle into pilsner glass. Pours a glorious golden. Smells very malty, balanced evenly with hoppy spiciness. Taste is malty at first contact, segues into hop bitterness as beer makes its way to being swallowed. Mouthfeel is typical lager fare. Easy drinker, the balance of hops and malt mean your mouth never gets overloaded with bitterness or sweetness. A classic from my favorite brewery!"
"Appearance was Clear Gold, poured with thick White Head. Pleasing Aroma of honey and Hops with a Crisp green apple Sweetness taste, Tingly on the tongue. Refreshing. Smooth and refreshing. Easy drinker. First experience with Great Lakes and I have to say it was a good one."
"D - This is an all around great beer. It can be drank any where, any time, by anyone. I think its the best dortmunder I've ever had."
"Musings: This is a wonderful brew. For a lager - it is on the top end of the scale and can compete with just about anything out there. A little hard to find - and a little expensive - but a prime drinker."
"Picked up a bottle while in Madison, WI. Best by date of January 26, 2006 is printed on the label."
"This brewery is just awesome! everything they do is top notch, all around terrific beer."
"Overall: A very impressive brew, tasted super fresh and was refreshing. Highly recommended as a session choice."
"This lager poured a clear, amber color with creamy, off-white foam that persisted. The smell was mildly malty with a hint of hops. The taste was malty with a hint of sweetness and with modest hop bitterness. Good balance. The mouthfeel was dry and crisp with medium body and good carbonation feel. The hoppiness came out in the finish and lingered pleasantly. This was a very nice, crisp lager, and was easy to drink."
"Drinkability  Hell yeah! This is a wonderful beer any time of year. This is what a lager is supposed to be."
"drinkability: very drinkable, session-like"
"price:$5.99 for a 6 pack"
"The beer is light on the palate and is not full bodied. It has a moderate amount of carbonation perhaps just a bit too much. There isn't much more to say about this beer. It is pretty average, nothing that makes it stand out nor is there anything that condems it. Depending on the selection at the store I would buy this again. However I would only buy it again if I saw no better beer there. It's not a bad brew but there is nothing that is special about it. Then again perhaps I am just not a big fan of the style."
"Notes: One of the better GLBC beers. I had this in a bottle and it is even better on tap."
"Drinkability: This made an excellent choice for an alternative to nothing but macros. This is just a litte better on-tap comapred to their bottled version."
"Bottle: Poured a clear light copper color beer with a nice clean white bubbly head with pretty good retention. Aroma of floral malt and subtle hops. Taste is very refreshing with a good malt presence, a full body (for the style) and medium bitterness at the end. Very good for the style."
"Either my palate is shot or I got a bad example...I want to like this, and I do like part of it. But the first section? No thanks."
"A reliable anytime beer. You can't go wrong with this."
"I'm not a big lager fan, but this beer was better than I was expecting. I'm glad I picked up a 6er of this while I was in Ohio."
"Bracing, bursting, beautiful beer. So fresh if you live in the Great Lakes."
"D- This tastes like strong sweet corn and I think I can even taste the corn silk in my teeth. I would like to see the malt come through a bit more or some more hops to balance. It was to one-dimensional for me. However this beer had an amazing, long-lasting head."
"Brilliant golden colour topped by a fluffy white head. Good lacing and retention makes this a fine looking beer. Hoppy aroma consisting of plenty of floral character and a bit of lemon, pine, and spice. This is balanced by mild toasty malt. Really nice. Great combination of flavours; toasted maltiness, moderate-to-high bitterness, and generous hopping. Everything stays nicely balanced right through to the dryish finish, with the bitterness lingering on even longer. The body is a little fuller than light, this beer is quite smooth with moderate carbonation. There's also a bit of residual sweetness that keeps it from being overly dry. Great tasting and full of flavour, this is a very enjoyable lager. Well done!"
"D - For this beer, in this category, I would give it a good rating. It's a good drinkable beer, at a palletable ABV, not a bad release from Great Lakes."
"The drinkability of this beer is untouchable. There really isnt much more to say about it."
"Cheers!"
"Pours a fantastic clear gold with a two finger head that dissipates leaving some nice lacing. Not a lot of smell slightly sweet and yeasty. Taste is very malty and sweet with just enough bitterness to balance it out. Very good stuff with perhaps some honey and peach flavors coming through. Nice medium mouthfeel with substantial carbonation. I could drink this all night."
"I was at a friend's house and saw two bottles of this in the fridge. I asked if I could have one and he said I could but he wouldn't reccomend it. Good thing for me, I went against his advice. The smell was very light and it had me expecting an average beer. Well the taste was certainly not average. Slightly bitter, slightly sweet. It was very well balanced. A nice satisfying brew."
"Taste is clean,dry and malty with a wet grainy finish. Quite nice. Everything else seems to be in check on this one. All systems go."
"Overall, a mostly typical golden craft lager with just a little something different. Hard to put my finger on it. The word that comes to mind is ""grainy."" More than tasting ""malt," you can actually taste something like fresh grain in this. Hops are light. Well balanced and something i'd definitely like to have again..."
"Drink ability: This is a very drinkable beer. It is not to heavy and not to light."
"Clear golden clor with a 1 inch white head. Toasted grain aroma. Sweet toasted malt flavor with grassy hops. Totally lacks the off-flavors found in most similar beers. Very tasty. Crisp and refreshing. Great drinkability. This is not a very complex beer, but it works very well. This is a beer that probably anyone could enjoy."
"Poured a bright golden yellow with a fluffy head. Some lacing down the sides. Aroma is very light and mild. Taste is definitely better then the average lager. Smooth, mild and slightly sweet. Good mouthfeel with a clean, crisp finish. An enjoyable beer."
"Pours a brilliant dark gold with a fluffy cream colored head. The head dissipates quickly leaving virtually no lace on the glass. The aroma has a wonderful hop character, mild citrus, backed by a light caramel malt. The taste has a pleasant hop bitterness up front with more of the citrus/grapefruit followed by the caramel with just a bit of toffee. The citrus comes back and has an almost pine character on the finish. Very crisp and refreshing. This beer, a nice Hefe Weizen (Schlafly Weiss Beer being my fav), and Prima Pils rank up there as my favorite summer beers."
"Beer is good. Happy beering."
"Pours crystal clear; a pale shade of golden amber. Dense three finger head, slowly dissipiates to sticky lacing. Some faint toasted aromas and a hallertau scent, but mostly clean. Toasted pale and pilsener malt sweetness meets a noble hop bitterness for a magnificent balance. Spicy german hops will dry the aftertaste somewhat, but fade quickly and finish clean. Medium mouthfeel and fine carbonation make a very smooth mouthfeel and great drinkability. This is what you might call a ""gateway beer""."
"Not my favorite style, but well worth trying...if you really enjoy lagers, you will really want to pick this one up."
"A clean dark yellow beer with amber highlights. Has a big creamy off white head with some lace. The aroma has a strong grain sweetness with acorn note and a whiff of spicey hops in the background. The flavor starts out with a spicey hop character followed by a light sweet malt with a caramel note. The finish is a smooth dry hoppy one."
"this looks like a good simple old beer. nice appearance and mild well balanced aroma. taste is a bit metallic. may just be me or this sample. it is crisp on the tongue. it seems a bit watery to me as well. maybe it's just this sample, but i'm a little dissappointed. i can't get past the metallic taste so i guess i don't have anymore to say."
"D: An excellent session beer. This one is very solid overall, goes down easy, and is great for the price."
"Pours from a 12oz bottle into my pilsner glass and there it sits, remarkably clear and deeply golden. Bubbly pure white head. Patches of lacing. Grassy, earthy, herbal European hops greet my nose and blend with some grainy malts. Flavor is crisp and dry - very refreshing. A large malt bill provides an impressively full and satisfying mouthfeel. Big biscuity malt flavors are at times a little toasty and dry, yet there is a pleasant underlying creaminess. Hops are perfectly balanced, adding quite a bit of bitterness to the flavor and finishing spicy. As the beer warms, it becomes slightly creamier and less dry. Aftertaste is toasty dry with lingering hops. Very well balanced lager, I am left wanting nothing."
"Nice,somewhat pale golden color. Low aroma-bready and yeasty in places. Nice full malt flavor. Pleasant hoppiness that tends to linger a bit. Theres a faint, almost ""apple like"" flavor in the finsh. Small amount of sweetnesss. Good body for style. A very quaffable brew-quite enjoyable."
"Wow. This is just a great beer. If you expect the ordinary lager from this one you'll be pleasantly surprised. Pours a nice pale golden color with a white head that leaves nice lacing. The smell takes me by surprise. It has a more pronounced aroma than most beers in the lager family. Slightly sweet malt and floral like smell that makes you want to dive right in. The taste is one of perfect balance. Grainy malt sweetness and crisp hop bitterness. Carbonation is right on. Feels alive in the mouth. Although it doesn't taste like an apple, it has a sweet/tart apple like thing going on. Very drinkable. This is a good one to kkep in the fridge anytime."
"Pours a deep yellow with a hint of orange, short-lived, mildly creamy head with considerable lacing. The nose is citrusy almost suggestive of a chardonnay as much as a brew. Taste is hoppiness again mixed with the strong citrus, not any particular fruit but a sort of generic citrus with a slightly herbacious finish. Mouthfeel is about medium-bodied and the beer overall is pre-eminently drinkable. After mowing brew for the stars."
"I am always happy to find any Great Lakes Style in my fridge. The are always welcome but never stay long."
"Picked up a mixed 12 pack with fellow BA dwvarner77. This one pours a rich light golden color with a 2 finger head that falls to a stickey coating over the beer. The nose is nice, with sweet caramel, slight lemoney citrus and a light graineyness. The flavor is okay as well. More graineyness with the slight lemoney background and a light caramel sweetness. Its nice. The feel is moderate with a light carbonation. Overall, a nice beer. I enjoy it."
"Great for sitting out and having a brew."
"The taste is a nice balance of sweet malt and and bitter hops. Finishes very clean. The mouthfeel is fuller than its appearance suggests. Goes down easy, I could do a session with this for sure."
"Drinkability: Perfectly poundable. A great session. GLBC can do no wrong. Looking forward to spreading this down south to other well-deserving BA's."
"Unlike the rest of my Great Lakes tastings, this one came from a cafe in Cleveland instead of the brewery. Fantastic Dortmunder (whatever style that is). Very smooth, great look and crisp taste. Nice combination of hops with a hint of citrus. Great session beer that I wish i could enjoy all the time."
"This is a very good beer, and I can't think of a better one to help introduce newcomers to craft beers with. You'll never go wrong with this."
"Drinkability: Lord knows I have pounded a goodly number of lagers consecutively in my illustrious career. I think I would much rather enjoy a goodly number of these. Much more interesting in character than most of the others I have met. Quite repeatable."
"Pours a clear, medium golden liquid. Lots of tiny bubbles streaming up from the bottom of the glass. Thick white puffy head. Very good retention, and a good amount of lace on the sides of the glass. Slight biscuity malt aroma, along with earthy, slightly herbal hop aroma. Good balance of malt and herbal, grassy hop flavor. Fair amount of bitterness. Light body, high carbonation. Very drinkable beer here. A simple style that could go down very easily. Another Great Lakes winner."
"Drinkability: I could drink the brewery out of these!"
"The bottle advertises it as having a great balance between hops and sweetness and that is the truth. It truly has an exceptional flavor. After drinking way too many of the Dortmunders, I have been very excited to try some other brews, but unforunately have not been successful in finding any."
"Drinkability and Overall: This is a really interesting beer. The first true Dortmunder I've ever had, and I really enjoyed it. It's crisp, clean and refreshing, but still somewhat filling. Definitly a good brew. Betcha it'd be killer on tap."
"This beer pours a golden color with a tall white head that falls quickly, but leaves some nice lacing on the glass. The aroma is sweet and has some floral hops in it, but very clean and promising. The flavor is full-bodied with a bit of sweetness and a good caramel malt backing. Finish is dry and the drinkability is very nice."
"Golden straw colored with a lumpy thick head that settles to about a half inch, and then slooowly drops down to a quarter inch but leaves clingy lace around the glass. Malty aroma, a little buttery. Flavor is initially corn, a little biscuity, followed by some spicy zestiness, like lemon pepper. Very mild hop undercurrent. Mouthfeel is full and smooth, with a little tingle in the finish. Finishes crisp, a little dry."
"i wish i could get great lakes brews around me!"
"(B. Scott)"
" Drinkability is good goes down easy and smooth not my cup of ale so to speak but much improved on regular export lager if memory serves correctly. Thanks go to merlin48 for this sample."
"Nice deep amber color with a light fluffy head. The nose is spicy, and hoppy. The taste is nice and clean with a definate hop presence. The bitterness is then followed with a very dry finish in the back of the throat. There seems to be a bit of oakiness and butterscotch in the taste. Overall, a pretty nice distraction from the other lagers out there. The only thing I don't like is the heavy dryness felt in my throat, but I can understand that many would enjoy this aspect."
"Amber gold, frothy white head that dissipates quickly. Smells sweet and bready with strong earthy tones and a light hop aroma. Tatses of toasted and sweet malts up front, some grassiness and bitter lemony hops that add a wonderful balance. Finsh is slightly metallic, medium bodied. Keep 'em comin'."
"12 oz. bottle dated best before Apr 20 2005. Pours a nice crystal-clear deep golden color with a fluffy, off-white colored head that stays around for good 25 seconds. Nice lacing, too. A bit of bready Vienna and caramel malt sweetness and a touch of Hallertau hops. Very clean tasting, a thorough malty sweetness cut with a lightly herbal, bitter finish. Some light, fruity esters come into play. Quite outstanding in a sense of drinkability, despite a slightly higher ABV than your average lager. A quintessential example of the Dortmunder style of lager, rivaling some German examples. Very recommended for any lager lover."
"A very well crafted lager. Pours out to a hazed golden orange color with a medium head that dwindled down but kept a presence. Sweet odors were present, along with a touch of a floral note. Direct and up front flavors of hops, barley and malt were detected, with a slightly creamy element. One of the best lagers I have ever had. The one I sampled was marked ""best before Nov 12, 2004"" and I drank it toward the end of Feb 2005, and it was still quite good. I can only Imagine what it could be like if it was fresh! Highly recommended."
"pours a clear golden color, with a decently large frothy head. Looks very macro like. The smell is grainy and hoppy, like a hopped up pabst without the corn. Taste is crisp and grainy. Then the hops hit next, definitely of german descent. Mouthfeel is much fuller than any macro. I really hate bringing up all these macro comparisons, but this truly is the beer to replace all macros. I could down these things by the case. The epidomy of session beer. This is an outstanding brew that anybody from the swill drinker to the person with the most refined pallete can appreciate. I only wish I lived closer to cleveland, I am sure this stuff is stupendous fresh. Way to go Great Lakes."
"Golden in color with a tinge of red highlights the beer also has lots of carbonation in the glass. Bread dough flavors upfront with a balenced dryish finish. The mouth sparkles with lively bubbles on the tongue. Solid and drinkable. The abv (5.8%) is hidden well."
"Excellent for style, and a tasty and sessionable lager/ale that would be a fine transition beer for newbies."
"Real good example of a US lager, Great Lakes continues to impress me. Pours a golden amber hue, with a surprisingly large head that leaves a good bit of lacing on the glass. Smell isn't as up front as the taste, but I can detect hints of subtle malts and light floral and citrus hops, as well as some wheaty grainy wafts. Taste is nice and smooth. A great balanced brew here, easy on the palate. Nice mellow and sweet malts as suggested by the scent and a grassy floral hop profile hiding in there somewhere. I really am loving the smooth mouthfeel of this beer, very drinkable indeed."
"This brew has a deep golden colored body, with a cream head on the top. Some lace. It has a light malt scent. The taste has a light malt front, with a hint of lemon, followed by a touch of hop bitterness. Full round mouth. A nice refreshing brew, not as crisp as a pils, equally satisfying."
"Mouthfeel is bountiful, with a wonderful body that doesn't have that watery feeling. Drinkability here is good as well. This would be a damn fine summer beer....beach...barbecue. Take a sixer and enjoy. It doesn't weigh you down and it's refreshing to boot. Nice job."
"Drinkability: Hoppier than Old Dominion's Lager, which is also a past winner of a GABF award in this category. I'd say GL edges out OD ever so slightly. Sessionable to the utmost."
"12 ounce bottle."
"The more I drink of this, the more I like it. I just don't think I'll ever love it. Maybe I just don't like this style. I keep buying it because my wife loves it."
"Prosit!"
"ng"
"The flavor is bready and malty and not complex at all. Smooth but lackluster in the flavor department. This beer would go well as an apetizer beer or with something light like sushi. But overall it is not that impressive of a beer, even for a lager."
"I returned to Purdue with a stash of this thanks to my parents. It is my first Dortmunder style beer and I think it was pretty decent overall. It poured a nice gold with a two finger white head that made itself present for quite sometime. Aroma is fairly muted, but some floral notes do come through (which I love). Taste is very clean with just a nice malt flavor coming through at the end. Mouthfeel is ok with a medium body on this one. Drinkability rates high with me as this is a supreme session beer. In the end, I will be returning to this beer but I'd definately like to try it at the brewery as fresh as possible. Another winner from Great Lakes."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed 3/4"" of slightly off-white head over the amber brew. Dense head shows good staying power, with nice lacing. Aroma is lightly of pale malts, with a bready tinge to it. Taste is basically pale malts, but ample amounts for the style, and has a crisp, somewhat lemony close-out. Mouthfeel is great, and drinkabilty is incredible, could see revisiting this again and again if the opportunity arose."
"Drinkability/notes: Very pleasing and easy to drink, an excellent session beer. Thanks to HardTarget for sharing this."
"The flavor does not let you down. It has a crisp, tart mouthfeel. Amazingly well balanced, given the initial sweet malts and grains. Finishes dry with a bit of lingering malts."
"Clear deep golden in color with a decent white foamy head that leaves good lacing in my glass. Bready and flowery aromas, nice bready and grainy flavors, medium bodied, nice smooth mouthfeel, finishes clean and dry, very tasty and drinkable, this is an awesome brew."
"Drinkability: Still a favorite from one of my favorite breweries. A fine example of a lager, I can enjoy time and time again."
"Decent on the drinkability scale. Not a spectacular brew IMO, but I would defintely drink more than one."
"Pours a deep gold with a big-bubbled monster head that quickly dissipated. Very full aroma for the style featuring spicy hops & toasted bread. Well balanced flavors of sweetness (caramel & brown sugar) with mild spicy hops & a bit of citrus. Medium bodied with very active carbonation. Well crafted lager that is both exciting and supremely drinkable. Extremely crisp & finishes very dry with a nice touch of spicy hop. Well done."
"Actually, it tastes better the more you get into it...very nice. Yum, top notch lager!"
"Wyll-"
"Overall Impression: Outstanding. The sulfur like taste and smell is really the only downside to this really good beer. This is my first Dortmunder so its hard to compare to anything else. I dont know of any beers in this style in my area, Ill have to learn to brew some. Respectful salutations to mattcrill aka stoutness for the opportunity to sample this very well made beer."
"Drinkability - it goes down very easily. 'nother please."
"Wow. This is an exceptional beer. The flavor is incredibly sweet with the malt right on top and the hops right behind. The head is big at first but almost completely disappears after a very short while. The sweet and strong malt flavor masks the hops in taste but you know just how much hops are there from the ""zingy"" mouthfeel. I will be on the look out for this one in the future. I could only drink one though. It could be considered too sweet by some people. It is a good session beer though."
"This is a beautiful beer. Arguably the finest Dortmunder style beer anywhere. If you want malt, this is your beer."
"i could drink this easily all night long...tastes much better then it smells IMO. great smooth beer that would be great for hot weather."
"A rich dark golden brew with a nice head of white foam that lasts, and lasts, leaving nice lace on the sides of my glass. The aroma is excellent! Fresh, earthy, apply hops dance with yummy sweet malts to create a beer that is truly refreshing to smell! The taste is awesome as well! Sweet malts up front with a lovely zing of fresh, earthy hops in the mix as well. Wow, this stuff is so light for a 5.8% brew, how do they do it? The mouthfeel is creamy, smooth and light, which means that this stuff goes down super easily. One of the best lighter beers that I have had in ages!"
"Huge, poof-ball of a coarse head which lingers on like a trooper. Rich, topazy gold color. Assertive scent of grassy, rooty hops and touch of yeast. Wow. The beer hadn't chilled enough by the time I got to it - it was just this side of cool - cooler and that brought the smooth flavors to the fore. Mild bitterness front gives way to a surprising ghost of tame grapefruit and then from thereon out, just smooth as honey. Finish is much too soft and friendly to qualify for ""long"". . . for a person whose least favorite style is lager: I've converted."
"Calling this Gold is a misnomer. Instead, this is a nice copper, not gold. There's a nice cloud-like head. There are slight tingly hops in the aroma, and the hops back up the smooth malt in the flavor nicely. This one tingles the tongue with both spicy hops and carbonation."
"Their website notes Hallertau and Cascade hops (we found where the refreshing citrus comes from). Sounds good to me."
"Es Ist Sehr Gut GrossesSehrGroßes!!"
"Pours a slightly hazy golden color. The foamy white head was staying power and leaves good lace. Sweet and clean malt aroma with hints of bready. It's about the malt here, some sweetness, light toasted grains, and bread flavors. Malt is balanced nicelt by mild hops that add a light herbal-citrus flavor. Finishes slightly dry with a lingering malt sweetness. Light-medium in body, smooth and crisp. Easy to drink and very enjoyable. A top notch lager."
"Part of a sample 12-pack given by a caring and dear sister-in-law (who could drink me under the table). Pours a clear and golden with an orange hue, white head pops right up, then falls back to make a stand. Aroma is matly, grainy with a hint of German hops. Taste is full grain with a nice slighty dry finish. Medium bodied, refreshing brew this. A quaffer for sure, too bad just three come in the sampler."
"Drinkability is very nice to style and refreshing lager."
"Great in the mouth, smooth, soft and creamy, but adequately bold. Great carbonation, this is an excellent weekend beer incredibly easy and pleasant to drink."
"Ahhh... but the taste is where its really at, tasty biscuit malts, dry and clean, some whole grain and sesame notes, slightly bittered and buttery in the finish with touches of grassy spices. Very nice on the palate, very geniune, gentle, subtle, and another showmanship by Great Lakes of what it means to be well crafted. Feel is quite smooth with a solid medium, firmly built body, kinda fluffy, and an easy drinkablity, could choke down a few of these with ease. Seems sessionable enough, but being close to 6% may be much to ask from a whole sixer. But indeed that could be done without a blink of an eye. Yummy stuff!"
"The mouthfeel is soft and almost creamy. Drinkablity is good, this would be a great bbq, football, or session beer. Very nice beer from a brewery I will be sampling more from!"
"Gold in color, nice 1 inch head that stays through out the drink leaving beautiful lace. Smelled hops with a slight malt, nothing fancy. Well balanced in all aspects. Tastes fantastic, first a delicate use of hops and even smaller malts follow. This is a great lager and finishes great leaving a refreshed malty smoothness in my mouth. Another hit for GLBC!"
"The beer as it skedaddles from the bottle into my ever present empty glass a lustrous gold color with a purposeful in size bright white head with the texture frothy and the lace a fine film to cover the glass. Nose is quite earthy, reminiscent of fresh bread dough, sweet and fresh to the senses; the start is also sweet and nicely malted with the top moderate in its feel to the taste buds. Finish is orthodox in its acidity and the hops enduring in their spiciness, quite dry as the style dictates and a fine drinkable beer and I give thanks to Atlagerheads for this bottle plus several others from this great Midwestern brewery."
"I have a perception that this stuff is exactly what it should be and totally to style. I'm just not all that familiar with the style. Try it, you'll be hard pressed to not find it extremely drinkable."
"Thank you PhantomVodoo!"
"Pours a darker golden color with a sllight head that lingers. Hints of hops in the aroma and a floral matly smell. The taste is a very good flavor of german malts and a perfect balance of hops. A solid beer and one that everyone should appreciate. There are subtle hints of citrus. This is a mellow medium bodied brew with a nice crisp taste. Very impressive!"
"Appearance is a shining clear yellow with a small white head that turns into a film and medium carbonation. Aroma is herbal, like I imagine is a typical Maine hay field by the end of the spring when it's still humid enough and not completely burnt by the summer sun. Restrained mild german hops in the aroma. Taste is all made of subtlety, never too sweet nor too bitter, perfect balance in that sense. I don't find much to be said really, excellent balance, medium body shows a perfect carbonation to my liking, quite creamy lager, pretty crisp dry herbal hops finish. Cheers Ciderguy!"
"Drinkability: This is a very nicely done offering, I can see myself having a few of these in my fridge, and as Jason said, this does match nicely with a sandwich. Good job, GLBC, you make a heckova beer."
"Highly lauded and most worthy of every bit of it. This is an awesome lager. A first rate representation of the style that any beer drinker should enjoy. A good thirst quencher or one to enjoy with a light salad or sandwich. Another reason why Great Lakes is rapidly becoming one of my favorites."
"new scores: 4.0, 4.5, 4.5, 4.5, 5.0... ... 4.45"
"This has to be one of the best Lagers to date that I have had. It pours a nice deep yellow with a thick white head. The heads leaves a decent lace, then that too fades. The aroma is of malt and hints of caramel. Then a slight wave of hops joins in. There is a nice balance between the two. The flavor is a dead match of the aroma. Sweet malt with a slight hint of caramel and then a ever so slight hops bitterness at the end. This beer has nice mouthfeel and is very drinkable. A very nice brew that I would look for again. Thanks to Motorracer36 for the offer!"
"A beautiful color. One of the best beers we have had that goes with almost any meal because of its overall balance. I have never had a bad beer from this legendary brewpub. Worth a night in Cleveland. Too bad not available in Canada, eh? Very popular and three people over dinner will finish a six-pack."
"Burnished gold coulour, topped by a dense white head. Scents of pears, fresh sourdough bread, and floral hops fill the nose. Fresh bread flavour, with pleasant malt sweetness. Crisp finish of noble hops leaves a pleasant lingering dryness. Medium bodied, brisk carbonation. I'm impressed."
"This is a quality beer, but it would be even better if it were slightly less hoppy, allowing the complexeties of the malt to show through. The alcohol can be somewhat distracting depite it's subtlety. Still, this is a high-quality brew from GLBC."
"Drinkability - a fine, fine session beer. A little above average abv at 5.8%, but this beer does everything possible (outside of a rather average smell) to maximize its potential."
"As I said above its a great example of the style."
"Nice transparent, yet hazy, golden with a thick, rocky, white head which begins to lace the glass as it slowly diminishes. An inviting appearance. Pleasant smelling of freshly mown grass and a hint of lemon. The remainder of the fluffy to creamy head greets the lips along with a mild but very good taste of malt and citrusy hops. Very smooth and full feeling, this is a highly drinkable and very good beer."
"Dayton, OH AleFest:The head was small sized, white and it quickly diiminished.The body was clear with carbonation observed.This beer's hue was yellow and the nose was lightly malty.The flavor was bitter from start to finish and it left a lingering aftertaste.The beer's mouthfeel was smooth, tingly and light-medium bodied.This beer's lacing was fair."
"Many thanks to 'Realale' for lugging this brew back from Michigan for me!"
"Gorgeous! Prime example of the style. Vibrant yellow-gold with generous bright white head for a lager. A fairly potent grainy nose and an even grainier flavor -- thick, mouthy white bread. Genuine malt flavor. Sweet with a small hop clean-up at the finish. Light -- but not light-bodied. This is a prime lager beer. And anyone -- I mean *anyone* -- should be able to drink and love this brew."
"596"
"Pours a deep gold/ light copper with a thick white head that leaves touches of lace. Aroma is full of toasted maltiness and spicy noble hops. Flavor is quite good... mixing the bread-like maltiness and spiciness of the hops with a nice balancing bitterness. Mouthfeel is smooth, with light to medium body and medium carbonation. A nicely done Dortmunder Lager."
"Sunny golden hue, thin and foamy head, yet decent retention. Malty nose, some light wheat accents to be noted. Crisp and malty up front, satisfying, smooth and delicate body. Hops blended in nicely, fine biscuity finish. Superb flavor, taste and highly quaffable, a definite staple beer, and yet another fine quality beverage from the folks at Great Lakes."
"Pours dark golden in color with a white creamy head that remains throughout consumption. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied and smooth, yet crisp. Aroma consists mainly of malt with a light fruitiness. Taste has a malty front. Hops introduce themselves toward the finish. Some sweetness noticed throughout with a pretzel-like feint salty and dry finish. This is pretty full-flavored as far as lagers go. Great companion to food."
"A quality lager from a quality brewer, and an excellent transition beer. Although Cleveland still sucks, at least their beer doesn't!!!!!!!"
"This is how lagers should look. A beautiful golden color with a steady head that stays well. Even though I dislike most lagers I find this to be a well done beer. I still feel as if the taste is too grainy for my liking. But the body is nice and thick and the flavors are balanced enough to create a superb mouthfeel. It has a very buttery dimention to it that I have not noticed before in a lager. I also taste a hint of honey. There are citrusy hops that created the fine balance with the grainy malts. A good beer."
"12 oz. bottle. Best Before date of July 17, 2003."
"I can't say enough about how much I like this breweries offerings! Now that I can't find anymore Holy Moses I thought I'd return to an old favorite-good old Dortmunder Gold. If I was in charge of writing the dictionary I would have a picture of this baby under the definition of Beer! This one does not hit you over the head, nor does it fail to challenge-perfect color, flavor and body for the style. Everything is in fine balance -malts, hops, weight. Man, if I could drink these at a Cubs game I would think nothing could be better-except perhaps a Hebrew national Hot Dog to go with it -everything but Onion. Great lakes you make some kickin brew! Thank You Kindly!!"
"My friend and I were bottling our homebrew and ran out of bottles so we had to toss back a six pack of this to get enough bottles. This definitely made our hombrewing experince much better."
"This lager pours a nice, golden color with a shade of copper mixed in for good measure. It features a nice, creamy head that laces well. Smell is quite complex for a lager, as it's a mix between sweet, fruity, and caramel tones and a mildly yeasty and hoppy aroma. The sweet, almost citrusy tones complement the hops well in the taste department, too. This lager definitely has that German breadiness quality to it, all while providing refreshment. This is incredibly drinkable, especially on tap. Great Lakes proves that great tasting, refreshing lagers do exist in America. Outstanding."
"Pours a nice golden color, with a foamy lace head. Slight yeast, malt and citrus notes. Quite bready overall. Wonderful full bodied example of this style, and offers a nice palette of hops, malt and yeast. Not a strong taste, and yielded almost zero bitterness units in the finish. Very smooth and the drinkability is very high with this one. Another wonderful brew from Great Lakes...."
"I tried this in bottles, on tap and then sampled at their brewery and each time this beer got better and better. Pours out a perfectly clear golden color and is topped with a frothy white head. Slightly sweet grainy smell with some grassy hops there. The taste is very crisp and is slightly oily. It goes down very smooth and leaves a pleasant bitterness and maltiness on the tongue. Another super Great Lakes offering."
"I had this brew in a 12oz. bottle poured into a tall pilsner style glass. It poured a gold/bronze color with a large white head. A good amount of lacing is left on the glass. The smell has a good hoppy aroma. The taste is a good balance of malt and hops. Maybe a faint bit of caramel to the taste. It is very smooth with a good drinkability. The mouthfeel is pretty good for a lager."
"I am very impressed with this Dortmunder and I am certainly glad Great Lakes has begun distributing in Wisconsin!"
"Great beer that pours a nice yellow/gold color. Wonderful head that lasts throughout. The taste is a nice sweet, crisp taste. I noticed that the beer was a bit thickerthan I had thought it would be. A bit syrupy (not in a bad way). Much heartier than it appears. Great beer."
"A well-executed example of the style. I was impressed by the malt flavor, which was softly bready, without fading into cereal or grassy notes, as is often the case for the style. Crisply moderate hops balanced nicely with the malt, and the beer is quite drinkable, either with a sandwich or on its own."
"Drinkabilty: So very easy to drink this one. As GLBC's flagship beer, they have done an excellent job with this one. Keep em' coming!"
"Overall, I'm not a big fan of pale lagers, but Dortmunder Gold is my favorite pale lager and a beer I'm always happy to drink."
"This beer pours a slightly hazy medium reddish golden yellow with a large creamy, rocky off white head. The mouthfeel is firm and rounded. The smell is breadlike, spicy with a slight herbalness. The taste is rounded toasty malt with a spicy hoppy finish. A very tasty drinkable lager and definitely one of if not my most favorite of the style."
"Pours a hazy toasted golden under a thin cap sprouting a few reeds of lace. Nose of toasted pine nuts, budding oaks and strawberry taffy, nearly ale-like in aroma, no sulfur to be sniffed. Start your draught with clean sweet malt, add a dash of almond, and finish off with some big mellow hop. Cool and crisp and poundable by the half-dozen."
"This is an incredibly drinkable beer. Beautiful medium golden color, a pleasantly tan-colored head that fades a bit too quickly, good lacing, and a pleasant richness to the feel. Nicely balanced grain sense, it starts well and ends well. Could this be my ultimate favorite? Maybe, if it weren't for GLBC's Eliot Ness!"
"Malty aroma with some citrus in the background. Perfect golden color. Foamy with a diminishing white head. Tangy front. Spicy hops give way to a slowly rising malt presence. Clean, dry finish. Start to finish one of the finest lagers in the world. Excellent!"
"(source: Tops; Williamsville, NY)"
"This beer is a crystal clear golden color with a very enticing enormous off white head that leaves a nice lace all the way down. Aroma is very grainy and strong. The taste is citrusy and enjoyable. It's just plain smooth and easy to drink while having some awesome taste to it. I think anyone could easily drink these all night. The mouthfeel is very smooth, and the aftertaste is slighty hopped. I had no idea what to expect when I bought this beer, and I am very happy I tried it. I will definitely be a repeat buyer, especially in the summer when concerts and festivals come around and it becomes tailgate time."
"Pours a deep, reddish gold with a prominent head which fades rather quickly to a thin layer fed by beautiful carbonation. Earthy yeast aroma with lemon and orange peel hint on the nose. Slightly musty. Starts with a sharp hop bite and fairly dry, malt balance comes to play mid-beer. Grassy and sweeter towards the finish. Great lace clinging all the way down the glass. Overall very drinkable. A great session beer."
"All in all, I'd have to take an educated guess that this is very good example of the Dortmund style of export beers. I find it a little too grainy to be delicious, but I'd love to drink a lot of these. This would be an ideal beer to have a liter of after some hard, sweaty work--the perfect amount of bitterness and body..."
"For me this beer is a go to, it is my trusty dog. One beer that does me right over and over again. The color of this Dortmunder Gold is a deep orangish gold with a huge white frothing head. An aroma full of citrusy grain that puts a smile on the drinkers face without thinking it is a pure reaction. I am not kidding take a whiff test my theory, and you'll be grinning like a little kid. This beer's flavor is so well balanced and crisp it is dangerously drinkable. It contains almost a sharp citrusy sweetness that dances with the tastebuds that equals pure enjoyment. This beer makes me want to pack my bags and make my way to Dortmunder. Awesome along with the other Great Lakes products."
"Pours a deep golden color with a white head, smells slightly bitter, with a nice malty profile. This is one good lager, A little bit more body than alot of lagers, assertive hop presence with a nice malty backbone. I could drink these all night, and I have enjoyed them all night."
"Slightly hazy dark peach color, 1/4 inch small-bubbled head. Spicy cinnamon and slightly hoppy aroma. Nice mouthfeel, smooth and velvety pumpkin pie with elements of some light and slightly buttered toast and a little citrusy hop tang that gets more evident close to the swallow. Seems to mellow more with following sips, very agreeable and somewhat warming. Smooth and pleasant, nice beer here..."
"I know nothing about Dortmunder, but this is an excellent rust-belt brew... tasty, quality beer, yet completely unpretentious. It would be a great pick for tailgating, pizza night, etc."
"If you're looking for a nice medium bodied brew, don't hesitate to tackle this one, particularly if you're looking for something with a little more bang than a simple pilsner."
"This isn't my favorite style of beer but it's hard to find anything negative to say about it, another outstanding effort from Great Lakes. It pours a deep gold, honey color with a bright white sudsy head. Aroma contains lightly toasted sweet malt, a touch of caramel, plenty of fresh grain and some herbal hops. The taste is pretty much just like the smell. The great thing about this brew is that it is magnificently balanced and very smooth, easy to drink. This would make an excellent gateway brew for any macroswilling friends you may have. Give them a bottle of this and they will see the light! Hallelujah!"
"Slightly hazy with a very nice golden color. The foamy bright-white head holds fairly well before dropping to a decent collar. The aroma offers a clean and mildly grainy maltiness but no noticeable hops (which is OK for the style).The body is medium/light with a fine, moderate carbonation that leaves it crisp and smooth in the mouth. The flavor offers a grainy, lightly bready and softly honeyish malt that's well entwined with grassy and mildly floral hops. It finishes dry with a mild lingering maltiness. Very well balanced. I recently spent a week in Cleveland and enjoyed this quite regularly on draft. It's widely available and makes a refreshing change of pace. It's easy to drink and quite enjoyable pint after pint. I appreciate that they've kept it restrained and well balanced. Well made. Very nicely done."
"Pours a thick foamy lace on top of a hazy orange-gold color.  The aroma is clean and crisp with citrus hints.  The extremely well balanced sweet malt with a brush of spice and a lingering mellow crisp bitterness.  Very flavorful, a definite favorite."
"I wish the word ""balance"" wasn't used as often as it is. Instead it should be reserved to describe this beer. It is like a swiss watch. Caramel yet dry. Aromatic and bittering hops are in equal proportion. Full-bodied yet lifted by delicate acidity and fine bubbles. Every component balanced and working in harmony for a sensational experience, sinus to gut."
"This is quite a great beer.  Definitely not my favorite style of beer but it keeps me coming back for more.  The beer is golden with a very thick white head.  There is a floral aroma that permeates through the entire beer.  The hops are subdued but present making it a highly drinkable beer for all seasons.  Unique and delicious!"
"Dortmunder Gold is truly golden in color, such a deep gold that it must be seen to sppreciate the depth of color this beer displays.  It has a great hop aroma which rivals a good bottle of Pilsner Urquell.  The taste is very full and satisfying, with the clean lager finish.  This beer will leave a lace that is extrordinary for a lager.  Truly an exceptional beer, which is not a surprise from Great Lakes.  My favorite traditional lager (thus far)."
"Had the draft version at the Renaissance in downtown Cleveland. Once again, Great Lakes can do no wrong in my book. Wonderful effervescence on the pour, and a nice off-white head. The lacing was what really impressed me though. Similar to how you can tell how old a tree is by counting the rings, the lacing allowed you to see the previous level where your beer was before each sip. So by the end I had a nice ripple effect down the entire length of the inside of my glass. I have never seen that before and it was very cool. As for the flavor, very good as well. Malty oat flavor. Another winner from GLBC."
"p.s.  To all Clevelanders who may read this, I apologize if i offended you for anyway, since I'm from Pittsburgh, feel free to send me all the e-mails making fun of the Pirates you feel like; no offense will be taken :)"
"This is absolutely world-class."
"Gotta give my sister some props for landing this big northern for me on her trip to Pennsylvania."
"Prop's go out to my sister for picking up 4 six-packs of Great Lakes while traveling through Cleveland..and then fighting off the wicked mother-in-law who wanted to save time on their way to the picnic and bypass the liquor store and just take that beer they brought with them(the Great Lakes)..to the picnic for everyone...Fortunately they talked her into stopping for some Bud Light or something..."
"Wow! I found my new favorite lager. It pours a wonderful deep golden (very slight cloud) amber with a inch of fluff on top that didn't run and hide but laced very nice the whole glass. it drank super smooth, not bitter, but slightly sweet. A very drinkable brew with most any meal.If its the Dortmunder style that suprised me or the fact its from Cleveland. Wow!!"
"This beer poured nice dark golden color, forming a nice light head that left a wonderful lace after subsiding. An slight aroma of hops and citrus. It had a slightly tangy flavor from the hops that seems to give it a good finish. Decent body for this style. Worth trying."
"A highly drinkable beer.  Crisp mouthfeel with a nice hop presence.  The hops aren't overdone at all, but aren't weak either.  Reminded me of Euro-lagers.  As the song says...""...all the little chicks with the crimson lips, say Cleveland rocks!"""
"Notes: This is the stuff! A top notch US brewed lager with several awards to back it up ... comparable if not better than some of its German counterparts. If you see buy it ... any macro to micro drinker with thoroughly enjoy this brew. Goes great with a roast beef on rye at lunch time! Fact: Its their flagship brew."
"great color full bodied.Lemony undertones,can hold up to almost any food.Glad I finally tried it.All the GLB beers I have had have bben great,still need to try the Eliot Ness,being its my fav type,the vienna style."
"Impressive Dortmunder style brew. Golden color with creamy head when poured from the tap. Sweet grain and leafy hop aroma. Smooth texture and mouthfeel, perfect carbonation level. Sweetish malty flavor and pronounced hop finish. Excellent, right up there with Victory Prima Pils."
"Nice golden lager"
