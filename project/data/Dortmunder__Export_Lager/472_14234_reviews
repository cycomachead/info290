"Flavor is much the same, bready malts are center stage, some light floral hops lend minimal bitterness. Light sweetness and pretty smooth, some cereal grains and florals in the dry aftertaste. Overall it's ok, not as rustic as expected for a Landbier, but certainly something there in the simplicity and nuance that's worthwhile."
"O: This beer is easy to drink but lacks the dryness compared to other beers in the style. The fruitiness is also unusual for a lager."

"Beer is medium to medium-light in body, with carbonation levels of medium intensity. The result is a slightly fizzy mouthfeel at first, which quickly settles to become foamy and smooth. Closes fairly dry (though not totally), with significant stickiness across the palate."

"Worth a try but the bottled version isn't really worth hunting for."
"Picked up a .5L swingtop at Euro Market. Certainly has that Dortmunder character with creamy, clean barley malt. This one's a little more crisp and dry bready grains. The beer is balanced through the finish and a tough light in body for the style, but you can just call it a more drinkable take on the export lager. It's winter now, but I imagine this would make a fine lawnmower beer."
"This was a beer I acquired when I was unofficially dubbed a tester of a six pack shop. I am so-so on German beers over all. I did enjoy the lightness of the beer all around. It was a refreshing change. It was rather malty and smooth. It somewhat resembled the taste of Straub. It finished a bit on the earthy side, yet not overwhelmingly so."
"The flavor isn’t as good. It is slightly tart with some pretty mediocre malt flavors. The hops don’t work either."
"Very nice one, quite drinkable with pleasant dominating bitterness."
"Pretty tasty and easy to drink for a lighter beer"
"Overall this is a good session beer, but nothing to rave about."
"Pours a clear, quite deep gold under a firm 1.5 finger off-white head that fades to film and collar pretty quickly but leaves excellent lacing on the glass. The nose is full of floral hops - almost like sniffing a bouquet of flowers. The mouth is quite light and fairly prickly. Nice flavors here, although the malt is a bit subdued. The hops are strong, but far more flowery than bitter. The taste is not exactly sweet, but closer to spicey, with just a touch of espresso dryness, which redoubles its presence after the swallow. A very pleasant experience - I could be happy drinking this for quite a while."
"The head pour by the bottle is incredibly dense and large. It leaves an impressive lace that really gets the taste buds flaired up. The color is a light transparent gold and the drinker can see the massive quantities of small bubbles dancing around. Shes a looker alright. Taste is intriguing at first but then just damn good. All flavors are light but a tangy bitterness really stands out. Creamy qualtities are noticeable in flavor and mouthfeel."
