On the palate, light bodied, refreshing and moderately carbonated, with herbal hops, and a heavier pilsner-like character. Drinkable, and not much more.","emmasdad","Sep 26, 2010"

After trying most of Shiner's new beers and being very disappointed ( Smokehaus, 99, 100, 101) I am very surprised that this is a well made beer. Put Live Oak or Great Lakes in front, and this is considered a great lager. Something I highly recommend.","champ103","Jun 25, 2010"

3.5,-3.3,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Pours a coppery golden, with a nice head that quickly disipates, leaving only moderate lacing. Decent grainy aroma, though I would have enjoyed a bit more of a hops presence. Taste is a bit weak, though what was there was enjoyable. Again, there was a grainy presence that might have been better complemented with more hops presence. Mouthfeel was decent enough, but not really memorable in any respect. Overall, a drinkable beer, but I expect a bit more from this brewery.","bristol2120","May 01, 2010"
3.38,-6.6,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"D - A bit dry and hard for my taste, it's going down slow. I also don't understand Shiner calling this a ""hearty, full-bodied ale"" when Dortmunder Exports are, by definition, medium-bodied at their fullest. Still, not a bad beer though.","BeerFMAndy","Apr 30, 2010"
3.85,6.4,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"Taste is a very nice balance between malt and hops, just a little dry, but just a little sweet. I like this. Very thirst-quenching. Must seek out others of this style.","rednrag","Apr 26, 2010"
3.68,1.7,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"D: Easy to drink and has more flavor than typical pale lagers. A bit stronger than I'd like for a session beer, but I can't taste the alcohol, so it's easy to get carried away.","MurphyMacManus","Apr 21, 2010"

Highly recommended and would be a great summer beer should Shiner decides to keep it available at that time. But just in case they don't, I plan on stocking up, especially as the store I bought it at has it on sale. Having this beer with chicken burgers btw - great combo!","marc956","Beers"
3.65,0.8,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,4,"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, mild kick, good representation of style, this is a good lighter beer that is worth pounding down several of over a long period of time.","TheManiacalOne","0"

3.3,-8.8,4,4,3,3,3,"If you really think about it there are not many beers of this style available in the USA. THis is a good beer but just one step down from Great Lakes Dortmunder Gold. This one seems a little less hoppier and just a little more watered down. Still it is good to have another example of this style to drink.","ejimhof","Mar 26, 2010"
3.68,1.7,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"Pours a clear, golden color. 3/4 inch head of a white color. Great retention and slight lacing. Smells of sweet malt, yeast, slight hop, earthiness (grain), and slight vanilla. Fits the style of a Dortmunder / Export Beer. Mouth feel is slightly smooth and crisp with a high carbonation level. Tastes of yeast, sweet malt, slight pale malt, slight hop, and a hint of citrus. Overall, good feel and a decent blend, the hop addition nicely cuts the sweetness.","Tone","Mar 17, 2010"

3.69,1.9,4.5,3,3.5,4,4.5,"Not a style you find very often.Poured into a .5 liter stein a clear rich golden with a large fluffy white crown atop,a majestic pour.Light in the aroma department,just some lightly toasted grain,and some light honey.Flavors wont knock your socks off but have some nice subtle qualities,lightly toasted and grainy,some hoeny malt sweetness,and a smack of herbal hop in the finish.This was made for the wrong season,its refreshing but ""sturdy"" enough,I could see mylef drinkin this out tin the yard over the spring and summer.","oberon","Mar 07, 2010"

4.55,25.7,5,5,4,4.5,5,"It's good beer yeah, it taste similar to Coors to me. i notice little or no hops but some malt. very attractive labeling and packaging. bought a dozen at HEB for 11.99 enjoyed them all they go quickly. not much more to say its frosty goodness from shiner texas. agree it may be a tad sweet if allowed to warm a bit.","lanechaffin","Feb 22, 2010"
3.16,-12.7,4,3,3,3,3.5,"D: You could do worse if you're looking for a nice beer on a hot day, though I'm not sure this brew is available in spring/summer. It's not bad, but not entirely flavorful either.","Infamous7100","Feb 20, 2010"
2.9,-19.9,3,3,2.5,4,3,"D: It's sad to say this is probably the best beer I've had from Shiner. A decent enough lager, but not something I'd be interested in having again.","womencantsail","Feb 19, 2010"
3.88,7.2,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Dortmunders are rarely produced by American micros because they're not exciting, and are all about good balance. This is a well-done one by a brewer known for as many misses as hits. Still, I can't imagine buying it very often. Dortmunder just isn't exciting.","allengarvin","Feb 19, 2010"

3.76,3.9,4,3,4,4,4,"Why is this a winter brew? So we get bock year round, but a refreshing blonde ale in the winter? I don't know about that. On the other hand I enjoyed this brew...for what it is. For my money better than Dortmunder Export, or a Rock Bottom Golden Ale, or any of the American Standard Lagers for that matter. I wonder how much it cost them to brew this and why couldn't the other big companies hit this standard of quality. I think a lot of people could enjoy this potential gateway brew.","tapman","Feb 12, 2010"
3.83,5.8,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,"D- High, I could go through a bunch of these. Worth having if you see it, I wouldn't trade for it unless you're a lager junkie but it's a damn good beer.","ShogoKawada","Feb 09, 2010"
3.83,5.8,4.5,4,3.5,4,4,"Mouthfeel is light and carbonation is above average, which works well for the style. Drinkability is good, a nice lighter beer with some good flavors. This isn't one of my favorite styles but it's a pretty good version of the style.","billab914","Feb 09, 2010"
3.08,-14.9,4,3.5,3,2,3,"D- A decent beer that drinks alright. The aftertaste could maybe use just a bit of work.","david131","Feb 08, 2010"
4.6,27.1,4,4,5,4,5,"Spoetzl Brewery's take on the Dortmunder style is an outstanding drinkable beer. A frothy, tawny gold colored pour that is a gentle reminder that beer was an important refuge to the working class, In this case, the Dortmund coal miners, who probably found this style of brew to be not only a throat 'cutter"" but also also an elixir of restorative malts. ""Frosty goodness"" throughout the straight forward flavors, complimented by an outstanding semi-dry finish.","thebeerdoctor","Feb 08, 2010"

3.91,8,4.5,3.5,4,4,4,"This one is very close to the style, malt forward like a helles yet fuller in body. This brewery should consider this as a year round offering. I am confused that the bottle states, this is ""a seasonal ale."" This is a lager.","jkrich","Feb 07, 2010"
3.53,-2.5,3.5,3,3.5,4,4,"Verdict: Easily identifiable as a Shiner beer, Frost is bright and happy, though ultimately forgettable. A solid winter seasonal for the Shiner faithful, though nothing worthwhile for the rest of us.","BeanBone","Feb 06, 2010"
3.15,-13,3.5,3.5,3,3,3,"D - Another ho hum average beer from shiner on the plus side it's an easy drinking beer but unexciting or note worthy","armock","Feb 04, 2010"
4.03,11.3,4.5,4,4,4,4,"Taste has a pleasant balance of sweet and toffee malts that are followed by a quick carbonation and hop palate scrubbing. Smooth and creamy feeling in the mouth. There is a mild soapy taste that is really the only minor problem I have with this beer. Shiner has done a great job on this one and it is in my top three or four beers they have made. It's a great value to boot, as I am on my second twelve-pack of it since coming out in early January.","twiggamortis420","Beers"

3.58,-1.1,4,3.5,3.5,3,4,"Not a bad beer at all. I just feel like it's a kind of bastardized version of the style just like Shiner Bock is a bastardized Bock. Still it's a nice clean lager with a little bit of character.","bump8628","Feb 02, 2010"
3,-17.1,3,3,3,3,3,"Not sure how this gets such high ratings, but this has nothing in common with the higher rated beers of this style such as Dortmunder Gold. This is just a basic lager targeted to BMC drinkers, packaged as craft beer.","Mora2000","Feb 02, 2010"

3.05,-15.7,3.5,3.5,2.5,3,3.5,"d - Overall it was a decent beer. I thought it was a little lacking in the flavor/taste department, but it is very light and drinkable. I was looking for something under 6% ABV and this did the job.","mdfb79","Jan 21, 2010"

3.7,2.2,4,4,3.5,4,3.5,"The taste is a bit more muted than the aroma, unfortunately, because the flavor that is present is quite good. Crisp, crackery german pilsner malts on the front of the palate are followed by a combination of sulfur minerals and hops. Traces of grassy bitterness linger into the finish as this Dortmunder dries the back of the palate. Light body with a good carbonation level, not exactly ""full-bodied"" as the neck label claims, but there is very little in the way of off-flavors or undesirable consistencies. I enjoyed this beer a little more than my review's score suggested. Not sure if Fr√∂st fits as a winter seasonal, but I am looking forward to the rest of my six-pack.","wagenvolks","Jan 21, 2010"

3.71,2.5,3.5,2.5,4,4,4.5,"It's also the first Dortmunder style beer I've ever had. It's quite a bit like a German style pilsener, though maybe a little breadier. I'm not sure about its authenticity, though. Either way, definitely worth a try for pilsener fans.","Fnord","Jan 13, 2010"
4.15,14.6,4,4,4,4.5,4.5,"My pour resulted in almost two fingers' worth of eggshell-white head with good retention. Color was a deep golden-yellow with NE-quality clarity. Nose had a good biscuity sweetness that made my mouth begin to water. Mouthfeel was medium, approaching full with an initial wash of a biscuity, malty flavor on the tongue. No doubt in my mind that of all of the Texas beers which I have had of late, this was the best (although that ain't sayin' much)! Finish had a slight hoppiness that did not overwhelm the sweetness that I noticed earlier, but instead acted as a nice compliment. I could easily drink another of these.","woodychandler","Jan 09, 2010"

The head was light in color and dissipated quickly. The taste from the beer was a nice blend, kinda high on carbonation from what I could tell.

The taste has alot of malt taste, and for the first time, actually tastes the way the back label on a shiner says. There is a sense of hops on the back end of the flavor. The mouthfeel is pretty good, not watered down like I've come to expect from other Shiner seasonals.","whoneeds8","Dec 30, 2009"
