"Overall / Drinkability: Since I had this at the table while the Mrs. was having the normal Dortmunder Gold, I took a sip of hers in comparison, and indeed, it's like they doubled the normal Dortmunder Gold recipe. More hops, more malt, but still quite good. Due to the higher ABV, need to stop at one, but easily could have another. A nice beer and I'm glad they brought it back to the brewery."
"Really smooth, slightly sweet, medium to low body. Bitterness is mild, overall mouthfeel is great. Drinkability really high. No aftertaste. Second taste, a little fruity, overall great. I really like this beer."
"Overall- i'm bummed i bought an old 4 pack but can't do nothing now besides drink it. if this was fresher it would prolly be in the b's."
"Out of a 12 ounce bottle and into my standard shaker glass. The lager appears a hazed rich amber color with about an inch of fluffy, yet quickly fading, off white head. Quite sweet and malty, as well as a bit fruity. Notes of toasted grains and bread, apples and pears, a bit grassy. A notch or two better than medium bodied with ample carbonation. Not too bad if you dig a big sweet lager."
"Overall, not a beer I am too impressed with. If I am going to be spending that much money on something like this I will get a 12 pk of an adjunct for the same price as the 4 pk. Simply a letdown."
"Sweet malt mixed with hops and some alcohol. Hops are quite prominent, more than one would expect in the style, and the alcohol is quite hot, which detracts from both mouthfeel and drinkability. At this strength, this is a sipper. I doubt that I would want more than one. Still, a pretty tasty beer, but given a choice, I would opt for the Dortmunder Gold, and will the next time I'm in Ohio."
"Drinkability: Very nice, it's got great flavors and is wonderful summer beer - a bit more filling than a standard export lager so it would be a bit heavier to attempt a couple, and the ABV is just a tad higher as well. If GLBC ever releases this one again though, I will be stocking up as it clearly lasts long past the bottling date."
"D- Pretty tasty stuff. Wish I had more than one."
"Drinks a bit slow due to the heft, a nice night cap"
"Drinkability - I thought this one fell far short of the original. I really don't care for oktoberfest beers, mush less the style of this one. I'll make sure I stick to the original, and make this a one time only experience."
"D: Pretty drinkable. Almost sessionable but a slight bit too much alcohol for that. A very enjoyable beer none the less."
"Drinkability: Pretty decent beer. Would like to dry again with a fresher bottle if they continue to brew it."
"D: Exceedingly drinkable. This is some fantastic stuff. They've made their already-outstanding dortmunder offering even better."
"A very good beer. It was refreshing and satisfying."
"Well balanced and good flavor. An interesting experience but I'm not sure it's a beer I'd rush back to revisit."
"Pours an orange yellow with a small white lace that disipates rather quickly. No cling or carbonation present after the pour. Tastes of hops and a good dose of sweet malt at the end. Got this in a BIF and this is the first time I have had this style. Seems to me to be a solid brew that doesn't leave me with too much to remember. Overall seems good in all areas but not great. I probably would not have this again but I would like to try other examples of this style."
"Drinkability: What else is left to imperialize? I had my doubts about this one, but rather enjoyed it"
"Great Lakes can do no wrong...."
"D- Very easy to drink, and is going well with the sunshine."
"This is past its best by date by about 5 months but so what - it's damn good. I wish I had had a fresh one to compare it to, but I would certainly say that the best by date can be ignored on this one. This is better than other imperial lagers (excluding pilsners) I have had - ST Krampus and Penn Penndemonium come to mind - by absolute leaps and bounds. I'm extremely impressed. Excellent!"
"Truly outstanding in terms of balance and mouthfeel, this is one of the finest beers in a lager style that I have yet to come across. Its simply the sort of beer that you wish you had more of... luxurious and well-crafted, but clean and approachable. I recommend this to all."
"Wonderful clear honey color with a small, creamy head and lots of carbonation. Smells very malty and citrusy with notes of apricot, pear and apple and some northern hops in the background. Initial taste is very sweet and malty, with all the cirtus flavors coming through and developing as it goes, followed by a nice balance of hopping and a lingering malt flavor. Very well-balanced and robust for a lager. Medium body and easy to drink and enjoy. Another treat from one of my favorite breweries."
"Overall: The mouth feel is medium with some carbonation. The finish is medium light and last for a few moments. The bottle said best by 10/6/08, but the beer taste great for being a dortmunder. There is nice medium bodied beer with a lot of flavor. Not much to criticize."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 3/4"" beige head above the clear golden amber brew. Quite a few thin floaties swimming through the brew. Thick head lasts well, with tons of slow-falling lace. Aroma is sweet and vegetal. Taste is sweet upfront, a shot of fruity tart in the middle, and closes with ample bitterness. Mouthfeel is very smooth, and drinkability is excellent. Everything comes together nicely."
"Cheers!"
"Chill hazed gold with a thick cap of foam. Lots of lemon in the nose, with some herbal and floral notes. Quite sweet, but not cloyingly so with a candy/lemon/floral hoppiness. Quite rich feeling, both in flavour and mouthfeel. Finish is refreshingly bitter and cuts through the sweetness admirably. Reminds me a bit of turkish delight with it's rich, floral sweetness and heavy body. The hops are just strong enough to balance out the sweetness from the malt. Big, sweet and rich without being overwhelming. Very well done."
"Overall, a quality brew from GLBC. I'd still prefer some of there other offerings over this one though."
"To me, this beer is one of those ""Why??"" beers. Their regular Dortmunder is really good, so why go with the trend and ""Imperialize"" it? I know it's an anniversary beer, but why mess with the beer that made you? I guess you have to try new things once in a while. It's fun to try this beer once because nobody else will make an Imperial Dortmunder. It's kind of a novelty beer."
"Good brew and a standout for style."
"drinkability is perfect and for some thing at 7.5% is way to sessionable"
"Overall well balanced and tasty."
"12oz bottle. Clear golden pour with a creamy white head. Malt, some floral/citrus hop, bready aroma. Flavor is similar, dominated by a bready malt. The hops really seem to have a tough time coming through. A fair amount of carbonation bordering on creamy. Finish pretty clean/dry. This is drinkable, but I think the regular dortmunder is better."
"Admittedly, this sample has grown a little long in the tooth already. I tried it out before hand, contemplated, and in the end decided it was still in good enough form to review. Although I might have enjoyed a little more a month or two ago, I don't think I would have been much more impressed. Imperial or otherwise, it's not any better than other Dortmunders I've tried."
"Overall, Great Lakes did what they set out to do, expand on their flagship by adding more alcohol and more malts. Good beer to try."
"Pours a slightly fogged barely brown orange with a white head. Nose is minimal with a sweet grain thing that's all that's going on. Flavor is fairly sweet. There's a minor edge of citric fruit edge. Consistent, by doesn't go beyond it's one dimension. Feel is slick on liquid and low on carbonation. Drinkable, yes. If you appreciate the style, you'll dig this."
"D - An unusual beer which seems to have the ingredients to pay tribute to the dortmunder style yet also morphs into a malty strong beer unlike the original in simplicity. The complex malt textures are very tasty, but make this a beer I would not normally consider drinkable, but interesting and well worth a try - Kudos to Great Lakes for producing this unique lager."
"Pours a clear dark gold with 2 fingers of foamy white head. Nice retention yields some lacing wisps. Smells of sweet caramel and honey, fruits, brown sugar, floral and spicy hops, and slight alcohol. Tastes of honey, caramel malt, apples, grapes, a touch of lemon, grain, and brown sugar with a floral hop finish with a good bit of alcohol warmth. Medium in body with ok carbonation. Sweet with some good bitterness, but as the beer warms up, the alcohol dominates. An ok brew, but I'll stick with Great Lakes regular Dortmunder Gold next time."
"D - Has the power of an ""Imperial"" but not sure if a Dortmunder is something I would look for ""Imperialized."""
"*Trader's Note: Special thanks to goryshkewych for the opportunity!"
"Overall, this is a great dortmunder."
"Pours a nearly clear golden amber color with a fluffy white head that dissipates quickly. Smells of berries, grassy hops, a hint of diacetyl. Pleasant malt forward smell. Taste is a bit sweet with lots of fruit on the tongue. Lots of malt, a little bit of alcohol and some grass in there as well. Body is medium to thick, mouthfeel is creamy and maybe a little sticky, carbonation is crisp. This is a great malt forward brew, I wish I could have tried it a bit fresher as I wonder if the hops were more pronounced."
"Drinkability is good, flavorful and light. To bad it was so expensive."
"Overall I am kinda ehh on this one. Nothing really different going on here and to be honest, I think they could have done better."
"D: Not bad but I would not want to have more than one in a sitting."
"mouthfeel is sweet hot, crisp, loads of flavor, good weight, nice!"
"Had a prickly carbonation with a dry and warming finish."
"Can taste the alcohol right off. Very prominent. Also getting some of usual lager flavors of corn and malt. This does have a pleasant bitter bite at the end. Mouthfeel is a little weak. Very few bubbles rising through. A little flat. Drinkability is a little low due to the alcohol smack. Good brew though."
"A very easy drinking brew. Could drink several!"
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, good kick, nice representation of style while taking it up a level as implied by the word ""imperial"" in the name, this is a good beer to drink for a while if you're in the mood for the lighter style of beer but with a little extra power to it."
"I don't have a lot of experience with this style but definitely enjoyed this one. Might have to check out a few other dortmunders for comparison."
"The body is moderate but some under lining sweetness makes you think under attenuated. Hard to say per base style really though. Overall I think this is a great version of a Dortmunder, and even more impressive with the ABV."
"thanks go to BuckeyeNation! Go Buckeyes, way to go Obama!"
"Pours a lightly hazed tangerine colour, quite orange, looks like orange punch almost, thin white head forms, settles to a thin ring and drops some solid lacing on the glass. Smell is very sweet, sugary, honey, grapefruit and orange peel, very citrusy, apricots, alcohol, light bready malt, very sweet though. Taste is nice, very bready, sourdough, caramel, sweet orange peels, alcohol, very fruity in the finish, almost a sherry like alcohol character, sugary finish. Mouthfeel is full to medium bodied with low carbonation, some alcohol warmth but pretty restrained. Not too bad, definitely enjoy the normal Dortmunder Gold, but this is a solid strong lager."
"4/3.5/3.5/3.5/4"
"Given the choice between this and a regular Dortmunder Gold, I think I would choose the regular Dortmunder."
"D - an easy drinking, enjoyable brew."
"D- Pretty easy to drink, but not something I would keep going back for more of."
"Thanks to DavidEddie for the sample."
"D- This beer has a smooth yet full flavor of malt that supports a nice hoppy flavor. This is a nice lager with malt and hop flavors big enough to overpower the dry sulfur punch at the finish. It was nice to taste noble hops blended with other pine hops."
"1087"
"From a 12 ounce bottle - Pours a clear pale reddish/yellow with below average carbonation, and slight lacing. The aroma is dominated sweet malts and mild piney hops. First sip is surprisingly hoppy with not much else going on. A light malt backbone is welcomed. Some hoppy bitterness is present but on a whole this is a big disappointment."
"I expected much more from this beer. When a beer's appearance is its strong point, then you normally have a problem. The beer pours a cloudy gold color with a creamy, tan head. The nose is very grassy, with hints of pear. The taste is a bit odd. There seems to be a hint of veggies in the front with juicy pilsner taste. The beer is very syrupy and leads you to believe that it clocks in higher than 7.3%. I can drink a couple but it isn't something I will seek out very often. I prefer the original Dortmunder Gold from Great Lakes."
"It took about six ounces for me to appreciate the full brilliance of Imperial Dortmunder. Good thing I have three bottles left. It's extremely doubtful that GL will add this 20th Anniversary offering to their seasonal line-up, but that won't stop me from dreaming about the possibility. Thanks to my brother for buying and holding the 4-pack for me."
"Though I enjoyed trying this beer, it's probably not one I'll be buying again."
"Pours a clear amber with a starter, one finger head that reduces to a nice filmy foam but ittle to no bubbling. The aroma has a very thick, hop resin quality. Almost like hop honey dripping on an English muffin. The taste is a lovely hop and toasted malt flavor. Very smooth toasted malts tht tste just like liquid white toast. Don't forget the syrup hop jelly on that toast. Adds a note of pine to the bread. Very crisp clean, malt heavy and hop heavy palate. This beer brings a lot of flavors to the palate. Great balance and interplay between the flavors. Silky palate makes for a very drinkale, high abv beer."
"This is a tasty take on an imperial dortmunder or dortmunder export. It is much bigger than I remember the regular dortmunder and almost seems on the edge of oktoberfest beers."
"Regardless, a very solid brew by one of the best breweries in the world. Hurrah for 20 years of definative beers."
"D-Nice job. I like the fruity/spicy notes, certainly makes it an interesting brew. Alcohol is not even detected. A beer GLBC can be proud of for their 20th Anniversary!"
"D: As American lagers go, this beer is among the best."
"Pours a nice clear golden with a one finger white head. Excellent retention and lacing. Smell is of grain,an malt. Body is the heavy side of medium with a lot of carbonation. Taste is bready,toasty malts, and fruity slightly bitter hops. Well balanced. Excellent!"
"Pours a very nice clean/clear golden orange color, nice carbonation, nice small fizzy off-white head, with some sticky lacing. The nose is malty, slight hops, very slight spice. The taste is very nice, malty, slightly hoppy, with some spice, sweet. Medium body. Very drinkable, this is a tasty one, highly recommended, glad to have tried it."
"I had high expectations, and they were exceeded. This is exactly what I want and more out of a lager (says the ale drinker). Happy Anniversary, GLBC!"
"12 ounce bottle, best before 10/8/2008. Served in a pilsner glass, the beer pours a dark gold/amber color with about a half inch off-white head. Head retention and lacing are both pretty good. The aroma is sweet malt, bread, citrus fruit and grassy hops. Taste is the same as the aroma, but the bready malt and hops flavors are the strongest. Good balance between the malt and hops although it is a bit more malty as the sweetness is a bit more noticable compared to the bitterness. Mouthfeel/body is medium/full, it's well carbonated (bubbles are always slowly coming up from the bottom of the glass to the top) and has a slightly dry finish. Drinkability is good too, it's smooth and very easy to drink. Alcohol is well hidden. Overall I think this is a very good brew, another winner from Great Lakes!"
"Bottle: Poured a clear deep golden color lager with a large foamy head with average retention and some lacing. Aroma consists of sweet malt with some notes of dry Noble hops. Taste is also dominated by some sweet malt notes with a dry lightly bitter European dominated hops finish. Body is quite full for the style with good carbonation and no apparent alcohol. Not bad overall but I still think the regular version is more interesting then the imperial version."
"Happy Anniversary to one of the best!"
"A dark golden color, with hints of amber along the glass. A white head froms, about a quater inch thick, and laces slowly down the glass. A strong bread and biscuity fragrance, with touch of grassiness and a bit of citrus at the end. The bread stands out in the flavor, along with a biscuit and mild doughy flavors envelope the palate. It finshes with a mild grassy bitterness.A hearty feel for lager, a tad chewy and hefty ar it rolls to the back of the palate. There is a slight warming feeling of alchol on the back of the throat. The regular dortmunder is favorite of mine, this is definately a ramped up version. The only real deterent is the alchol on the throat, but everything else is strong. So, drink up."
"M/D - Light to medium bodied and very crisp from excellent carbonation. Very easy drinking. Alcohol is masked very well."
"D: A nice brew. I could easily have another."
"Drinkability - This was a ok beer just a bit to sweet and heavy."
"A great job on going imperial without going so far as to leave no characteristics of the style left."
"Overall this was an interesting first tasting for this style."
"D - Good offering, but I think I'd prefer the standard Dortmunder over this amped-up version. I like the crisp, clean finish of a Dortmunder lager, and this didn't really deliver that."
"D - The sweetness and alcohol detract a bit from its drinkability, but if its something you're in the mood for, it goes down nicely. Definitely worth a try."
"D- It was great to try this one...but I had much higher expectations for it. I love dortmunder gold and this just isn't as good. It's much sweeter and not as hoppy. This has the same flavor profile as most Munich Helles that I have had. Doesn't seem very unique to me."
"Has a thick mouthfeel more than i would have expected. Some cloyingness. Goes down fairly easy and does get filling a bit quickly.A malty backbone not a hop lovers beer. I'm kinda of in the air about this one. Maybe i just ezpected something more. Not a bad beer,just would have expect more for a 20th anniversary beer from GL. At least they didn't do the overdone hop bomb anniversary like most breweries do. The jury is still out on this one for me. Still worth a try,just because it's different than the rest."
"Pours a near perfect copper color, clear, with one finger white head. No lacing and minimal retention. Smell is fine. It has a malty, biscuity sense to it with a bit of straw. Taste is pretty good I though. A nice blend of strong malt backbone with some grassy hops and a slight (very slight) alochol kiss. Mouthfeel was a little heavier than I liked. Even for an ""imperial"" this beer seemed to scream light but the mouthfeel was slightly thicker and didnt seem right. Overall a good beer, not amazing but I would revisit this one."
"It's good - you should try it. I got this bottle at Discount Liquor in Milwaukee."
"D-Really a pretty strong boozy afterburn with this....there are some fine qualities to this but overall I much prefer the regular dort. One sixer a year of this would be fine. I thought it would border on maibock territory but it doesn't. They actually did a nice job of making a bigger dort."
"D - I would find it hard to drink more than one of these in a night due to it's thickness and barrage of flavors. Not a bad beer by any means, just one I wouldn't pay $10.00 a four pack for any time in the near future - I'd rather get a good Belgian."
"Drinkability: Really a very drinkable malty lager, especially considering the alcohol."
"Pours a golden color with a decent head. Nose is sweet vanilla taffy. Flavor is sweet, thick, with a viscous mouthfeel. Fairly malty with a lightly hopped/bitter finish and very full-bodied. I remember the regular Great Lakes Dortmunder Gold as being rather thin and weak, however, this is very different in its imperial state. It was unusual, but I would say I liked it. Thanks to drgonzo3705 for this taste."
"Cheers!"
"Glowing orange body. Bubbly dirty white head. Lace is evenly spaced in delicate rings. Perfect blend of bready malts, lager yeast traits and subtle flowery hops on the nose. I love this aroma. It's got some poundcake aromas as well without seeming overly sweet. From the start, you can tell this is one full bodied lager. But also carbonated nicely. And the slightest hint of alcohol makes this incredibly drinkable for such a full bodied full flavored lager. The EtOH adds just a touch of spice to the overall picture. Otherwise, I get a bold flavored balance of malt and hops on the palate, with the scale being tipped in favor of the malt flavors. It has that similar bready, crisp pils like malt base that the original has. I like that malt flavor a lot. The hops add a little flowery character and some hay. Overall, this is one helluva beer."
"drinkability: not great"
"D: I could take down a 4-pack easy. Dangerously drinkable."
"Solid offering, on my second batch it proves to be better than the first. By far superior to dort/gold"
"D- Pretty solid brew, I'll drink another one for sure but I think I like the orginal better."
"Not bad. The only characteristic that really screamed ""Imperial"" to me was the body but this packed enough flavor to keep me interested. I picked up a four-pack of this from the gift shop on the way out, so I'm looking forward to visiting this in bottle form as well down the line."
"D- A decent beer, and worth a shot. It really is what is advertised, imperial. A sipper for sure."
"D: The lager is moderate in strength but I don't see myself having more than a bottle or two."
"Drinkable, I wouldn't power drink with this; but it's a good beer."
"Overall impression: This reminds me of a maibock or a hoppy pale bock. I guess that's what happens when you try to step up a Dortmunder. A good beer but kind of having an identity crisis. Who cares what the style is...I'll drink it."
"I could drink a 4 pack of this easily but not all at once. Great drinking brew, I really didn't notice the alcohol in the flavor but it did catch up to me in the end"
"D - Before I knew it I was done with the first and wondering to the fridge to grab another. At 7.5% this could be hell of a morning at the rate at which they go down."
"Drinkability - I'm of the opinion that this may be a style that doesn't take well to imperializing. That being said, I'll probably prefer this to that big 1.5L Baltika 9 staring at me..."
"Drinkability: Lacks the refreshing qualities and overall enjoyment of it's non-imperial kin. Worth a try, I suppose, but I'd take a Dortmunder Gold over this any day of the week."
"Drinkability: one a night is good for me....too many of this beer could leave you really tipsy...maybe im just getting old though"
"Overall I really enjoyed this, but it was a bit on the ""hot"" side for such a clean and crisp lager. I would have liked to taste a bit more hop character for something this boozy, but it's still a very nice interpretation on the style if you enjoy it slowly and in moderation."
"Overall, I think this is a pretty good brew; it has some tasty notes, good mouthfeel, and looks nice in the glass. I think it's just a wee bit to boozy and that cuts down on drinkability for me."
"Good flavor, but a little strong tasting in the alcohol department to be greatly drinkable."
"M,D The mouthfeel is medium, but the drinkability is rather good for the high ABV"
"Imperial Dortmunder is a solid brew from Great Lakes. I would pick up another 4-pack again if I came across it. They just keep on making impressive beers over there in Cleveland."
"D- Very tasty and it's a big one to boot. A beer that is highly drinkable but flavorful enough to savor."
"Tastes strong biscuity malt (nearly toasty). Alcohol sting is present, but clean and not bearing. Hops not as strong as the aroma would suggest, but come across as orange, lemony, and bright herbal (hint of basil?). Wet from the malt hangs on the tongue allowing memories of the flavors to persist. Alcohol adds a sour and drying contribution that's really quite nice. This beer is *quite* drinkable despite the extra alcohol ummmph. Ponderable. Md-thick, but dextrinous quality makes it come across as thicker. The moderate alcohol can't pierce this, and neither can the md+ carbonation."
"D-Had a 4-pk and I would say 2 tasted pretty good and 2 tasted just ok."
"Nothing really wrong with the flavor of this beer, but it is just a bit too much and seems to be too far from the Dortmunder style of beer. I just don't get a Dortmunder essence any more; too much of everything has turned this into something else. I am not sure what separates this from a Helles Doppelbock, though it is even on the sweet side for some of those. Certainly there is nothing wrong with the flavors here, it would have fared a bit better if labeled as a hells bock, but I am a bit disappointed in the end."
"Conclusion: One beautiful beer in every visible way, an enticing aroma, a nice long-lasting head that never seemed to drop below a fourth-of-an-inch tall. Only hampered--unfortunately--by its taste. If only it were more balanced. As a craft beer, this one's average. As a Great Lakes brew, it's actually disappointing. Yet it blows away a lot of the crap in the beer areas of most stores. And at around $10 for a *four* pack (plus another dollar sales tax), it's unfortunately overpriced. But yet... at the same time... I still feel that just having the privilege of seeing this beer in action was somehow worth it."
"Medium bodied and bold, this beer is really a wolf in sheep's clothing. ""Imperial"" is a fun and applicable word here. ""Double"" just wouldn't do it. Kudos to GLBC for creating a new and interesting brew. I'm glad I got these, but will not likely spend another ten bucks on a four pack. Too many other reliable standbyes and new ones to try."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a certain slickness to it as well, almost making it chewy. Quite a big lager here for sure. Overall, an interesting brew, however I don't think the Dortmunder style really needs an ""imperial"" version. Glad I tried it but I'll be sticking to the super tasty original."
"Very clean, very refreshing and nothing like it. A tad cheesy aroma, dissipitates in time. Purchased at the new Village Mart. Short lasting head, light colour. Medium plus mouthfeel. Drying aftertaste. Very drinkable. Dry hopping and malt, works for mer and good with food."
"Well done - a big version of the classic - when I first saw this - I wanted no part of it. I was a frequent visitor of this pub in it's earliest days and Dort Gold was the first star - this is a nice tribute to the anniversary given todays style choices. I want to taste this next to Capital Blonde Dopplebock."
"D. I could drink this on hot and cold days alike. it is smooth yet distinctive, especially if you are used to the dortmunder gold from the same brewery. i only drop it points as i couldn't justify spending so much on a 4 pak and the alcohol would be too much for multiple bottles each day."
"Ultimately this is a beer worth passing on as the cost is way too high compared to their normal version. If you find it on tap though it might be a nice change."
"Notes: Pretty good stuff, but I like the plain ol' Dortmunger Gold a lot more than this."
"D: Pretty damn drinkable even though this beer leaves me wanting just a bit more, I was always going back for another sip so something must be going right. If you are in search of a well crafted and well balanced lager, look no further, if you are looking for something cheap, look elsewhere."
"Pours a clean yellow/ orange color with an off white head. In the aroma, a sweet malt and a lager/ saaz hop note. In the taste, a small roaty maltiness and a small sweet hop end. A smooth and medium bodied mouthfeel, and a semi dry to a clean aftertaste. A big lager, good and hides the alcohol presence."
"12 oz bottle. Pours a clear copper with a 2 cm quickly diminishing, off-white head. Aroma of sweet malt, not much else. Initial flavor is sweet, a hint of spice. Flavor switches to a little bitter on the backend. Not strong flavor-wise. Moderately carbonated, light to medium body, light lacing, and a hint of alcohol in the aftertaste. Overall, slightly above par for great lakes, but that isn't saying much."
"Pours a transparent deep golden/copper color, decent size fluffy beige head, lots of sticky lacing. Grainy smell, a bit of lemon, and I feel like I'm getting a whiff of alcohol in there too. Nice crisp grassy hop taste, bready, some more lemon. Slightly thick mouthfeel, not really what I'd expect. It's good, but not something I'd go too far out of my way for."
"Drinkable: yes, for a crisp rich full bodied Dort. A good job indeed. The ABV stays suttle as well aiding in the drinkability."
"D: This one is just plain odd, and I'm not sure if I really like it yet. I'll stick to the original GL dortmunder."
"Pours a dark gold with a rocky two finger white head that remains for a bit. Fair amount of stick on the sides of the glass with a whole lot of bubbles racing to the top of the glass. Smell consists of sweet buttered biscuits, malts, and some honey. Toasted grains and noble hops round out the nose with this one. Sweet bready malt up front with an interesting spicey pepper bite. A lemon zest midway with a touch of noticable booze as well. Aftertaste is some honey with the lingering alcohol burn. Feel is oily and warm with a medium body and a stinging carbonation. The regular Dortmunder Gold is a very solid lager, this is just a bit too much for the style. I appreciate the attempt by GLBC, but I didn't enjoy this one too much."
"Notes: This is a good beer worth picking up if you find it somewhere. The success of Dortmunder Gold (both in this reviewer's opinion and its popularity elsewhere) is clear. This stronger version loses the excellent balance of the original and therefore suffers."
"Overall a pretty easy drinking beer with such a high ABV."
"Mouthfeel is light, crisp and clean, drinks nicely."
"Not a preferred or familiar style but certainly worth a try if you can get it while it's available."
"Not a bad beer, but not as good ass the original."
"Medium body, with low carbonation. Nice anniversary beer, however making the original one bigger seems to take away from it in some ways. Still, worth getting a pack or two."
"Appearance compared to the standard is pretty similar, the head had a toasted biscuit hue versus the traditional Dort Gold being more of an egg shell bright white foamy. Of course head retention is better here with more malt and hops on board, lacing does indeed form thick and evenly with each sip. Smell has a deep floral herbal grassy kick going down, definitely some noble hops kicking. The great pungent hop aroma is literally wrapped with honey drizzled fresh baked biscuits with a touch of noticeable alcohol. That is fuckin' awesome, a bigger version of one of my favorite lagers that still retains it's balance and original concept of the little brother. Flavor wave rides heavy with cereal malts and deep honey sweetness, fresh baked split wheat toasted with honey and butter describes the meat of the malt backbone. Hop profile doesn't bash you but you fully understand why Dortmunder Gold is such a world class beer. More flowery hops with herbal and grassy layers very noble hop esque in general. Definitely worth the hype of this very limited released brew. Mouthfeel is pretty clean nothing heavy sitting on the palate, carbonation is even very smooth 7.5 abv is barely noticeable very balanced yet flavorful. Drinkability is solid all around something I would down few more of if I had more than a four pack, btw I picked this one up in Wintersville, OH at Valley Wine Cellar for 8.99 for four. Get this limited brew while you can."
"D: I'll probably drink another (it is pretty tasty and goes down with nary a remonstrance from me) but the regular Dortmunder is the superior beer."
"Lightly toasted malt and spicy hop bitterness up front. Big, sweet, rummy fruit malt follows. Solid herbal hop bitterness hangs out on the edge, providing balance. Sweetness peaks with some caramel cookie dough before the herbal, grassy hop bitterness finishes. Medium-full body with a mouthfeel that becomes almost syrupy in the finish. A little on the sweet side (and therefore not as drinkable as their regular Dortmunder), but a nice way to celebrate 20 years!"
"D: A great beer, I could enjoy a few in one sitting. A 7.5 ABV keeps this from being a session beer."
"Well, if the regular Dortmnuder Gold didn't qualify for Export strength, this one surely does. The beer opens with a golden, lightly amber-ish color like the regular Dort, despite being described as darker on the lable. Fair head formation, but falls to a trace after a few sips. The aromas are deeply malty with hints of herbal hops, moderate alcohols, and touches of cereal grains here and there. Flavors are rich and malty, but taking on Imperail Pilsner and Malt Liquor sweetness that prove a little much for my taste. Although the beer is dry-hopped, the presence of hops either in the bittering or flavor offer little reprieve from the heavy malt-grain flavors. Moderately weighted with some silickness and a slow alcohol burn late. Finishes quite crisp for such sweetness. I appreciate the attempt at a bigger beer of this style, but the beer just doesn't fullfill the quality that has been already established by the standard Dortmunder Gold."
"Thanks to abankovich for the TIF Championship extra..."
"Pours a dark amber in color with a thin sheen of froth sitting on top of the beer. Some hops in the nose, but the malt wins out here. I'm wanting to say that I'm getting some sort of fruit in the taste. Perhaps from the type of hops being used. Medium mouthfeel and tasty. I'm not a big lager fan, but this is starting to grow on me."
"Congrats on another astonishing brew GL. Looking forward to many more!"
"Poured out just like a regular Dortmunder but seemed to be a little bit thicker. Caramel malts came through on the smell with a little bit of breads. Taste is pretty medium bodied with the malts hitting you and then the hops to balance it. Hops are slighty grassy in taste. Very good drinkability in my opinion but you have to watch out for the higher ABV. This would make a great rotating release if they weren't just brewing it for the anniversary."
"Still, worth trying if you're in the region."
"Overall a very good beer, very Great Lakes-y, I'm just a little skeptical to the whole ""imperial"" term being applied to all styles of beer."
"This beer poured a clear golden copper color and formed a nice foamy off white head that coated the glass with lace as it subsided. A medium amount of carbonation is present. An aroma of malt, bread, yeasts and lemon. The flavor was of bread, citrus and pepper. The body is medium light and slightly creamy. The finish is slightly bitter with pepper. Another nice beer from the neighbors to the north."
"D: Take the awesome fruitiness of the taste and mix it with the incredible mouthfeel and you are left with an extremely drinkable beer. Great stuff!"

"I was a little skeptical of the Imperial Dortmunder style when I heard about this beer. But, I'm a believer. Great Lakes brewed the perfect beer for their 20th anniversary. It's a classic representation of everything that is Great Lakes. Straight forward, damn tasty, smooth as can be, and extremely drinkable. Happy 20th! Looking forward to many more to come."
"Thicker than the Gold, but smooth and enjoyable. I like it. Maybe not enough to drop that kind of money when I can get very close to this very good beer with the Gold. Oh, who am I kidding. I'll buy more. I love GLBC. They're the shit."
"Overall a very good beer but at $10 a 4 pack I couldn't drink it all of the time (that would buy me 2.5 gallons of gas and take me 50 miles!! ;)"
"D- great lakes is known for extremely well rounded beers and it's a no-brainer that their 20th anniversary beer would be a knockout. very drinkable for something so full and flavorful with a decent amount of alcohol. happy anniversary, baby."
"Like other reviewers have mentioned, nice to see this anniversary beer as a take on their flagship brew. I always find the regular dortmunder to be a refreshing session beer. This still resembles that beer, but takes some of the drinkability out of it and beefs up the body and alcohol. I enjoyed this on tap a little more than the bottle, the finish was a little cleaner and the alcohol was a little more masked."
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability: Overall this is a dry beer on the palate. The beer has a crisp feel to it. This beer has a great body...I want to say that it is medium-heavy, however, the carbonation makes it hard to say this. Carbonation levels in this brew toy with the palate, they make the beer feel lighter on the palate than it is. When ignoring the carbonation the beer feels medium heavy, when including it and feeling the beer as a whole it feels much lighter due to the higher levels of carbonation. This is one I'll have to pick up again, after all the 20th anniversary only happens once! Don't miss this beer."
"Very pale golden color-not a lot of carbonation or head. Ok aroma-malty and grainy-mild hop presence. Somewhat bitter and skunk like. Full and malty flavor. Nice, heavy bitter flavoring going on. Somewhat sharp and metallic but that has to be between the hop levels and a slight alcohol presence. Certainly not unpleasant. Good, full body-more so then a plain old Dortmunder. Very drinkable and enjoyable. Comes off as a milder form of some of the ""super lagers"" you get in Europe. Nice beer."
"D: Obviously not as drinkable as the original but a good and interesting pick for a 20th Anniversary. I'm very glad they didn't do the cliche RIS or DIPA, though I'm really looking forward to my trip upstate when they release BA Blackout again."
"Notes: There is no buttery taste like GL's regular Dort making it better still, but again, not my thing"
"Na Zdravje!"
"Very nice beer. Literally tastes like they just doubled everything. Creamy in the mouth showing a drawn out finish. That lager refreshment on the end with a warming alcohol and prickly carbonation. Honey dew, sap, breads, biscuit, bitter on the end with piney almost herbal hops. A good beer however I think the regular Dortmunder is more well rounded. Why double it?"
"Wow. It was worth the wait!! The appearance is a lovely dark yellow/ light orange hue. The smell was of a very strong alcohol presence, truthfully a little off putting, then you drink it. Lovely sweet malty tones make this beer start and finish well. It has been a half hour since my last drink and I still can taste the lovely sweet finish on my lips! This is a very drinkable beer, which at 7.5% ABV can be trouble! I would have to say this is my favorite Great Lakes brew and I hope it is not a one time thing!"
"Excellent beer. Is it a Dortmunder? An Imperial Dortmunder? What is an Imperial dortmunder? Who cares! This a just a damn fine brew."
"Eric"
"Feels smooth and creamy and is very drinkable."
"Drinkability borders on dangerous. At 7.5% ABV, a beer that goes down this easy is easy to underestimate."
"I'm not even sure what Imperial Dortmunder really means - but to the brewery it means more malts and ABV. And to tell you the truth, this brew rocks!! It poors a pretty amber color, average to above average smell for a lager - but the taste is so smooth and refreshing!!! The brewery was a buzz about this beer, if you can get your hands on it, please do - you will not be dissappointed!"
