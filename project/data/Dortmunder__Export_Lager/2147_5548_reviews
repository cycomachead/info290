"If I hadn't known better I would have said this was a Heineken with a different label."

"A light, sweet, grassy, cereal, honey and green tasting lager with a surprising medium sized body."
""
"Clear golden color with a decent sized but short lived bubbly white head. Light sweet grain with a hint of bread and melanoid. Not bad for a pale lager."
""

"Contrary to conventional beer geek opinion, pale lagers (even mass-produced ones) *can*be a source of uncomplicated scrumptious - provided they're done right. That's the caveat. ""33"" Export isn't so poorly made that it couldn't be enjoyed given the right conditions but, by and large, it is a beer I'd only buy again with counterfeit money."

"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a mug. Pours dark straw orange with a white head that dissipates quickly. Smells of weak grain not much else. Tastes of watery grain, but with a tad of fruitiness. Beer is heavily carbonated and light bodied. Overall an ok beer."
"Enjoy"

"Overall: this beer is uninspiring to me, but it's also not terrible. It's hot out today, which is contextually appropriate, but even that doesn't strongly help its drinkability."

"O: Decent for what it is: A thirst-quenching lager designed to cool you down on a hot day, or pair with a salty, spicy bowl of Vietnamese phở noodle soup."

"A clear golden brew that shows lots of bubble activities throughout and clinging to the sides of the chilled pint glass. The modest head is snow white but holds on reasonably and leaves similar traces of lace. The aroma offers a mild but balanced rice/wheat grain. Very clean, nothing unusual but fine for the style. The flavor brings fairly simple wheat and light malt with a rice-lemon theme and maybe even some sweet corn and a cardboard kiss. But it’s a light bodied beer with a fairly dominant carbonation that makes for a very bright, crisp feel. Very refreshing, perhaps overcarbonated and a little under-flavored. But adequate to wash down your Viet Namese chow."

"O: The slightly metallic taste is definitely off-putting in this beer and to me makes it less than enjoyable and not a sessionable beer. I do not want to have more than one of these, never mind more than one in a single session."
""
""
"O: I wouldn’t drink this beer again on a dare, or if paid less than twenty bucks per sip. You wouldn’t believe how many potato chips I had to eat to nullify the effect on my tongue. I know this doesn’t make me popular with the maker, but that’s my true opinion; better luck next time. I’m immediately going to another beer. Until the next time."

"Refreshing and crisp on the palate, not a bad example of the adjunct lager style, certainly a better choice than Tsingtao for you Asian food accompaniment."
""

""

"I'm not quite sure how to compare it. To american adjunct lager this is a highly drinkable beer which is non-offensive without strong adjunct flavors. Highly drinkable and good for a session."
"Oh man, this isn't too good. Got a cold bottle, poured a small, off white head that quickly settled down to a light scummy cover and lots of lace. Color is a pale yellow with varying size bubble trails. Aroma is super mild, a little fruit, and maybe malt. Flavor is dominated by carbonic tang with a little malt, fruit, some mineral, and adjunct flavors. Body is watery and carbonation very sharp. Finish is like flavor and too long. Can't drink anymore."
""
"Actually not bad for a food pairing. But not much different than other asian lagers like tsing tao either. Quenches thirst though."
"O: The metallic nature and strong adjunct natures don't make this a beer that I would want to try again."

"Had a couple bottles of this tonight ice cold along with some spicy Vietnamese cuisine (a nice pairing!). Pours a typical macro lager; nice lacing and head retention for the style. Smell is faint but pleasant; lightly sweet and grassy/earthy. Taste follows the nose. Goes down very easy; extremely crisp. Not bad at all as an accompaniment to spicy food (bbq would also be excellent with this). I could also see tossing a few back on a humid day in the delta."
"Overall Drinkability - I'd definitely like to try a fresher batch of this to give it a more accurate rating. It wasn't as bad as I thought it was going to be, especially from the horror stories I've heard about vietnamese beers. Worth a shot. Not bad."
"O - this beer does exactly what it's supposed to: goes down refreshingly fast and easy, whether by itself or w/ hot spicy food. it's definitely not meant for over-analysis"
"The 33 Export presents itself nicely enough for the most part, from bottle to color to aroma, but it fails badly in the taste category. Simply, this beer gets rotten pretty fast, and that's what I take home from this beer, especially when there's this lingering aftertaste."
"T: Smooth and a little sweet. I'd rank this right around Singha as the quality is around the same and the taste is similar. Honey, cereal malts and a little hint of grassy hops. It went pretty well with my pho."
"This one pours a thin bright, bright gold in color with a very light, white head. It smells of light pale malts and is very spritzy, as if overcarbonated. It tastes really subdued and features most faded pale malts, maybe some light honey, and it has a light bitterness. It is very, very light and finishes quickly as well. It's watery thin and essentially a lager I assume a lot of people drink a lot of. It's just ok, nothing special."
"Basic lager similar to about 35 or so American beers that are pretty much trying to copy each others basic lagers."
"O – Feels like you aren’t drinking a thing. It doesn’t taste bad because it doesn’t really taste like anything. That being said its perfectly adequate and you can have a few of these and never feel it."
"Clear, light golden with a shock white head that leaves scraps of lace on the glass as it falls. Untoasted grain, corn grits and faint green apple skin in the nose. Grainy, husky and slightly sweet to start with some creamed corn-like flavor that turns dry with some cracker flavor in the finish. I think this beer is imported for the sole purpose of filling a need for Vietnamese restaurants and giving Vietnamese Americans a taste of home, it doesn't do much for me."
"Medium light body with solid carbonation. A decided tang up front but it mellows well enough. A middling example but not swill."
"D - Could be easily consumed but due to bad taste would not recommend it to anyone."
"D= I couldn't get beyond about a third of the bottle."
"Weak flavors, but nothing horrid. I'm guessing the brown bottle helped a bit here. That subtle apple is there, with corn husk--green--and some very faint florals. The feel could use some carbonation or a bit of a snap to it. Easy drinking at first, but it kinda wears on ya."
"Overall, I enjoyed this beer with my Thai food last night. It was much better than the Tiger Beer I had just before and would recommend it as an easy drinking alternative to American Macro swill."
" D- The watery flavor is strong with the supporting flavors a bit odd and the apple grows as the beer warms but no hops or malt flavors come through to cover or support it."
"Overall, interesting pick, I wouldn't rate it at the high end in comparison to some of the Asian beers I've tried, Cheers."
"D: Judging by the disparity in reviews of this beer, I have a feeling that quality control isn't this brewery's highest priority. My sample was simply not good. Too harsh and metallic to be enjoyable to me. I don't think age was an issue, as mine was right in the middle of the printed bottled on/expiration date range. Not worth a revisit."
"Taste is rather neutral, with a good balance on the finish. Carbonation supports the beer initially but becomes a bit thin as it settles. Decent feel and finish as a quick flash of citrus returns on the finish. A decent example of a rare style for me, and well suited to many culinary styles."
"D: A decent respite from the flavorful Vietnamese food it was paired with, but otherwise a very lackluster brew."
"From a 12 oz. brown bottle. Pours a golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Very mild aroma, hints of malt. Taste is a bit hard to describe. Not a lot going on, but some ingrediants I can not put my finger on. Feels light in the mouth and so-so drinkability. Overall a mediocre brew."
"Flavors of light peaches but flavors are very quick, fragile and thin and very rapid. Finish is so short as to be non-existent. I don't know reason to drink this beer other than water not being available."
"Appears Bright straw golden with thin fizzy white head thin traces of lace. Aromat Bottle states that there is water, malt, cereal, and hps as ingredients...I guess beer has a better shelf life over there filled 10/3/08 and expires 10/3/09. Smells of rough cooked veggies, with a light rice and corn notes and a muted meallic note, not much going on other than the corn sweetness. Flavor has a clean watery sweetness with more cooked veggies and metallic traces in teh finish no real hop bitterness of course and once again rice heavy with a touch of sliced green apple tartness. Mouthfeel is much like carbonated water for sure thin tiny bubbled tickles the throat doesn't offend kind of refreshing, warm weather beer...Overall the coolest part about this beer is the neck label and cap adorned with a ""thunder cat"" like symbol representing, beer wise it's completely forgettable."
"Drinkability: Bleh! Not recommended, as it's both unclean and fairly unrefreshing. This is no way to spend Valentine's Day!"
"Typical pale, fizzy lager with a pure white head and good carbonation. Smells clean and even slightly hoppy with some light graininess. Not that sweet. The taste has a strangely herbal sweet/bitter combination along with some more graininess. Almost medicinal in its bitterness, overlaid with adjunct sweetness. Not pleasant. That combo makes this a drain pour for me. Mouthfeel is acris and bitter. Not for me."
"Nikki"
"The aroma is skunked malt and somewhat metallic. The appearance is pale gold with a medium head. The flavor is sweet and malty with watermelon and a metallic finish. The palate is thin. Overall, I don't like it because there is absolutely nothing redeemable about it."
"Figured I would try a Vietnamese beer as I haven't tried any before. Pours a light golden color with tons of bubbles shooting to the top and a nice little head. There's even a good amount of lacing, better than the average macro so far. The taste is light bodied and a bit odd. A sort of German taste to it but the finish is just weird and kind of has a funky aftertaste. Decently drinkable and something different but wouldn't seek it out again."
"Clear straw yellow with a fast dissipating white cap. Fine bubbles settled to a thin collar with a few wisps covering the surface of the beer. There was a bit of stickage when the glass was tilted, mostly the collar just grabbing the glass and then settling on the beer again once upright. Doesn't look bad at all. Big whiff of veggies (celery) and cooked corn up front, with a bit of spicy hop aroma in the background. A little sour too. Not much going on in the flavour department. Very low bitterness, some sweetness and fruity esters, plus the vegetal note was there from the aroma and lingered in the finish. There was a bit of spiciness from hops near the end, but that just wasn't enough to make this attractive. Light bodied, average carbonation that was a bit coarse, and none of the crispness I'd like. A bit dry. Even by southeast asian industrial lager standards this wasn't very good. And the celery/veggie character didn't help. Not something I'd try again."
"D: Ok drinkability, better then anticipated"
"The flavor, surprisingly, was actually quite good, with a crisp, clean mineral body that finished sweet with notes of honey and light fruits. Some rice and malts up front. Mouthfeel was thin and a tad-bit undercarbonated, but the sweetened finish paired well with my spicy Vietnamese dish. I'd recommend this over other Asian beers, but just barely. Still, a decent export from the far side of the globe."
"Pours a clear gold body with a quickly dissipating white head. Upon my first impression, I know this isn't another offensive or at least bland macro lager. 33 Export is better than that. However, it is a fairly bland export lager. An easy description of this beer is that it tastes like I imagine barley juice would. It's sweet, like fruit juice, and the flavor resembles very lightly roasted barley."
"Worth a try..."
"D - This lager really threw me for a loop. Very drinkable and could go well with a number of meals. for the most part I usually prefer ales over lagers but I will have to add this to my library of preferred drinks."
"The drink is light and well-carbonated and has great drinkability."
"D - I may have a few, but wouldn't. The overly metallic aspect is more than a little unpleasant."
"D- thee are easy to put down. This is like water but there is no flavor. Not tasty just pound em back. Like a Beast or Busch."
"Had one this past weekend while eating at a Vietnamese restaurant in Allston. Poured into a tall pilsner glass. Lots of carbonation, not much head. Pale yellow color with no noticeable aroma. Tastes like an average lager. Not much to complain about or like. It's just the novelty of have a Vietnamese beer with some nice pho or noodle dish. A decent beer to accompany the cuisine."
"Very average and much like the BMCs. Nothing really stands out."
"This was my first Vietnamese beer. It was interesting. Poured a pale banana yellow with a fizzy head. Smelled faint of hops and a little malt. Taste was thin with mild bitter hops and a touch of malt sweetness. Nothing special but nice to say had a beer from Vietnam with out having to go there."
"D-This is not bad for an Asian beer which tend to be light and good with Asian food. Export lager? Seems way to dry to be one but if you think Asian lager and drink it with food its a good choice."
"D: For a mass-produced beer, this is OK. Nonetheless, this doesn't make it a good beer."
"D - This is pretty boring, but it serves as a perfect foil for hot Vietnamese dinners when you can't taste anything but heat anyway. Why drink a flavorful beer if your taste buds are fried? The carbonation and dryness in this one might actually make the painful spice even worse, but at least it'll cool you down a bit if downed ice cold."
"Drank okay, worked with the food, a one & done unless my choices are limited"
"This isn't bad but it is kinda reminiscent of drinking tinny water. I could see this being refreshing if i needed a refreshment but we are in heavy stout season and it just doesn't stand up. Overall though i am still surprised this isn't bad."
"D_this is probably the best of the Vietnamese bottled beers but it really is nothing special. It did go down very quickly in the hot humid Saigon evenings and paired well with grilled pork, scorpions, and cobra."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: It's light bodied and well carbonated. More crisp and refreshing than I expected. Drinkability is pretty good. Certainly would be true on a hot day. Overall, it's pretty average. But, honestly better than I expected."
"OK this beer was not all the bad. A Viet Nam version of Budweiser with a little more taste. It poured a straw color with a lot of bubbles and little head. Very refreshing, clean taste with almost no hop presence. The mouthfeel was crisp and carbonated. Overall it was pretty good. Nice lawn mower beer."
"12oz brown bottle with a exppiration date of 5/08. Pours a straw yellow eith a two finger head OK longevity and pretty good lace. sweet honey malt aromas and rice is detected. Not a bad flavor. Decent malt flavors with a slight watery rice mixed in. Not huge in the hops department but enough to offset the sweet, although it is still on the sweet side. Its clean and a bit watery but not bad. Much better than I expected."
"That about sums this one up."
"Pale yellow beer, no head to speak of. Slight grassy aroma, but kinda unpleasantly funky. Taste however is a bit better. Malty, buiscuity, a nice touch of grassy hop. Not that bad really on the palate, nice dry finish. Not horrible, I have no doubt this would be quite adequate in steamy Vietnam. This one was brewed by Fosters in TienGiang."
"12oz bottle poured into a pint glass. Pours a golden yellow color with a small white head. The aroma is a little skunky with some malt and a touch of grassy hops. The taste is all malt up front with a dry and spicy hop finish.Nothing special here but it is a pretty decent lager. Overall, this is a decent brew that is very drinkable."
"Overall, is refreshing, but just another import that falls into that catagory of the same lighter flavored beer. they intended this to be a lighter beer, and i think they did a decent job."
"D - Not a bad beer. It certainly had an interesting taste. However, I don't feel an overwhelming desire to grab another."
"This one is an easy drinker as it is light on the carbonation and taste overall. Easy to drink with the spicy vietnamese dish I was having and was better than the water I was offered. Overall not too bad for a hot dish or a hot day."
"A light beer in color with virtually no head. Very bright straw color. The smell is a little bit of vanilla and cinnamon. Fair. The taste is similar to a cream ale and is actually better than most macro's. Cereal grains are also evident. This beer has a smooth mouthfeel and drinkability is good. I could see where this beer would be refreshing after a day in the jungle. Drinkable, albeit a little bland. I could go for this beer again sometime though."
"A pale, bubbly pour with a bit more head than would be expected into a pilsner glass. So this isn't the greatest beer ever brewed, but it went very well with a Viatnamese meal. The sweet and sour taste are a decent compliment to the spcies of the meal, and it has an interesting mouthfeel, like a very mild champagne. Good points and bad, but a decent choice for something different."
"Served at the local Vietnamese restaurant. Pours a clean, golden color, with a short-lived white head, and very little aroma. Taste is inoffensive, if not exciting. Typical bland lager flavor; faint hint of hops, with a dry finish. Not something I'd seek out, but better choice than a Bud or a Miller."
"An easy-drinker with a nice, light flavor. It was better than expected. I recommend if you are looking for a lighter, inoffensive ""session"" brew."
"A nice beer. It wasn't very complex. It was a bit one dimensional, but i really enjoyed it. The smell was heavenly, the head was good initially but finished fast. A crisp mouthfeel and an excellent drinkability make this one definetley worth a try!!"
"Still, for a random Asian lager, this has character and is fairly drinkable. Not a superstar by any means, but worth a try and not bad for the style."
"Notes: Date brewed and best by date stamped on bottle. This one is only 2 months old as it was brewed August 5th. I will consider this the next time I see it fresh."
"I would choose this beer over a Bud while eating Vietnamese food but I wouldn't seek this out again."
"This is definitely my go-to asian beer. One other thing I've noticed is that the importer for this brew seems to be VERY much on the ball. I've seen brewed on dates that are only 2-3 weeks old. Imports don't get any better than that."
"Poured a clear golen color with a fairly large , bubbly white head , left a moderate lace. The aroma is clean, with thin hints of malt and grassy hop. Taste is also on the thin side , very similar to most Macros , slight grain and hop , clean. Mouthfeel is clean and thin. A drinkable beer , nothing special in my book though."
"from some Thai restaurant, served in a pilsner glass"
"33 Export pours a straw color with a thin white head from a brown twelve ounce bottle that has a foil wrapped neck/cap. Sweet adjunct aroma, nothing offensive. Very sweet tasting at first, nothing really bad about it, just not good either. Probably better than I expected, which isn't saying a real lot."
"I would buy again."
"This is super refreshing, simple and tasty. Ill say this a fantastic beer saved best for a hot summer day."
"Pours a super pale straw color with a finger width head that subsides to a film that sticks around for the duration of the beer. Smell is weak at best with no hops some malt and I think some rice. Taste is pretty weak as well, slight hint of hops, and some maltyness that taste watered down. Thin in the mouth with some decent carbination. Not much special about this beer."
"D: It's not offensive. I wouldn't go out of my way, and certainly wouldn't pass up better beers for this, but if it were offered to me I would not turn it down. Being pretty light and not very alcoholic, I could easily enjoy a six pack of this on a hot afternoon with a friend, as long as he was buying."
"It would be a easy one to slam on the 90+ degree days in the steamy south Asian areas."
"Drinkability/notes: An uninspiring example, scarcely a Dortmunder."
"Drinkable? Well, let me put it this way. I put my glass down did a few other things and forgot about it. Yeah, that says it all. This is just a boring, run-of-the-mill Adjunct Lager. I purchased my bottle in Council Bluffs, IA as part of a mix six-pack of import beers from odd countries. Skip it. Goodnight Vietnam."
"This beer might be a decent session beer. It is low in alcohol, and the flavor, with the exception of a little too much grainy flavor, is not too overbearing. I doubt I will go out of my way to have this beer in the future, but I am glad to have tried it. Thank you MABZ for this opportunity to try another country."
"I haven't been impressed with Vietnamese beer and 33 Export does nothing to alter my impressions. A colleague who eats a lot of Vietnamese food at a local restaurant swears by this beer so I had to give it a try. Thanks to the '33', when I order my reviews by beer name, this one will appear near the top of the list. When I order them by rating, however, it will be nearly as close to the bottom."
"Last swig: Regretable inedible and forgetable. Prob'ly beter out of the bottle."
"Body is thin as expected, with active carbonation and a gritty, bubbly mouthfeel. I guess it would go well with the food, but not too great by itself."
"Overall Impression: Not very enjoyable, but not awful. Much better than the last Vietnamese beer I had. Still, hard to recommend."
"D - While this beer on its own is nothing too far from average, it is best suited for drinking either as a backyard BBQ thirst quencher or as a pairing to a nice, spicy Vietnamese (or any Southeast Asian) meal."
"Not bad for a plain ""vanilla"" beer."
"I got this in a terrible sampler pack from World Market. I've been afraid to drink it because of the other beers it was bundled with. I was pleasantly surprised with it. The smell is fairly week, but dominated by sweet malts. It poured with little head, as it is lightly carbonated. There is little hops taste. It is mostly malts. It reminds me of sweeter version of Heineken Dark. It has a clean finish. The color is very similar to apple juice. I was planning on finishing it off with spicy food, but it was good enough that it outlasted the food and made me wish I had another. This would be a good session beer if it weren't so hard to find at a reasonable price."
"This would go well with spicy food. I think it had a strong enough taste to hold its own. I wouldn't seek this one out, but if you're in an asian restaurant and choices are scant, this one will do the trick."
"If not for the idiosyncratic name, ""33"" would have nothing going for it."
"If I was sweating my balls off near the Mekhong River, I'd definitely go for this brew before any rot gut local whiskey/rum. I really enjoyed the flavor profile, considering the crowd this beer travels with. It was actually more enjoyable than a cold Singha..."
"The beer pours a pale yellow color with a thin white lace head and some yeast floaties. The aroma is average. It has a dry pale malt scent with some adjuncts and a slightly spicey lager yeast aroma. The taste is horrible. It has a light pale malt flavor that is watered down and slightly metallic. It goes down easy, but it has a dry and spicey finish; not very good. The mouthfeel is average. It is a low bodied beer with good carbonation. This beer is horrible. It's the first beer I ever tried from Vietnam. I hope for their sake that there are others available. It has less than average taste and drinkability. I'm on my way to the sink to dump this one."
"It's like I'm drinking water that gives me dyspepsia. Waste of money."
"I don't make a habit of sampling and reviewing such poorly rated beers, but I've always been fascinated by Vietnam, a country that only a high draft lottery number kept me from visiting, courtesy of the US government, over three decades ago. This beer pours a clear straw yellow body, with a minimal offwhite head that quickly falls into film and a few patches of lace. Aroma is ghastly, with burnt plastic, a hint of sulfuric hops, and some corn syrup. Mouthfeel is light bodied with medium carbonation. Tastes like a lower tier, adjunct lager. Biscuity maltiness has a corn syrupy sweetness and the hops are mildly ""Euroskunk"" sulfuric. This one was a chore to finish. Very little, if any, to recommend here and it seems to be an adjunct lager rather than a Dortmunder Export."
"Drinkability: Guh, if you really want beer in Vietnam, drink Heineken. It might not be real Heineken, it might be if your lucky, but it will still taste better than 333."
"This is definitely not something I will willingly drink again, but it is not so offensive. It is best drunk cold."
"Well, I saw this one for the 1,000 time, so I figured it was time to finally try it. I guess you could say that curiosity got the better of me. Sure, it wasn't as bad as I expected it to be, but it wasn't that good either. The taste was a little metalic and of scalded malt. The alcohol wasn't tasteable at all, which with such low numbers, shouldn't be anyways. If your going to drink this beer, it's way better to drink it cold. If it's warm, it just goes down from there."
"Tried this months ago from the tap at Flying Saucer Emporium and just despised it at the time. This time, received this as part of a Beer of the World's gift pack and said what the heck. Actually, this is much better than I remember. The head retention added some points to the low score in appreance (almost flat with no lacing). Color a bit darker than a BMC and a better option as well. No mouthfeel but easy to finish and perhaps order another."
"Drinkability: Drinkability is pretty good..and to say anything different would be a lie. If i was sweating in the jungles of Vietnam, I'd kill for a refreshing brew like this."
"Drinkability - definitely one to avoid, unless you just want to say you've had a beer from Vietnam."
"1"" of crusty, coarse, noisy white head. Clear, clear, pale gold body. Smells of peanuts and some grass. Nutty start. Thin body, a touch sour, a little fruity. A little metallic in the finish, a little corny, but some nice bitterness. Sour alcohol. It's not bad: a nutty, pale lager with some alcohol kick."
"Pours with a one-finger bubbly white head that fades quickly to a ring leaving some lace. Very pale yellow color. Nose is skunky. Light bodied and carbonation. Not as bad as I expected really a good lawn mower drink, but nothing to go out of your way for. Malts and hops are not strong. I needed it for a new country (#54). $1.90 for a 12oz bottle from Colonial Spirits, Acton, Ma."
"Well, this isn't a bad beer, but not a great one either. I admit, I bought this one just to add a new country, and well...when you do that, 90% of them will be boring lagers. While this one isn't one that blows the mind, it's not terrible, and if I ever go to Vietnam, I'd probably drink it."
"-Oelergud"
"This is refreshing beer, from its light lemon scent, to its ease going down. I can imagine myself sipping this one like lemonade under an umbrella somewhere."
"12 ounce bottle. Very easy to drink."
"The apperance is the usuall lager yellow but this one had little head. A fizzle if anything. The smell has hints of sweetness and malts. Taste is hints of everything, I detected some malts, hops and bitterness as well. The mouthfeel is dull and bland. Not very drinkable when compared to other lagers out there."
"Pale golden hue with a trace murk. A vigorous pour yields a lanky, spotty, porcelain white head that manages sparse, middling foam. Mild, grassy hops accompanied by dilute husky grain and simmered cabbage. Trace sulfur surfaces as the vapid hop nose dissipates. Not impressive aromawise. Non descript, residual, maltose like sweetness upfront in flavor is ensued by a transient combination of token hop bitterness and vegetal DMS. Mid palate a near void in flavor remains, filled only partially by trace herbal hops and soured white cracker. Lean in overall body, and very well attenuated, with a rice induced watery, virtually dextrinless mouthfeel. Finishes bland, and reminescent of a dirty Heineken. Certain beers can be light on the palate, but flavorful. This isn't. Vegetal, yet bland. Utterly yawn inducing."
"Mediocre lagerness- yes, its a new term and I coined it- that pours pale golden with a medium white head that fades, and must take all the good things with it before tasting it. Nor interesting smell, not interesting taste. Pisswater-like, that Runs down your throat along the lines of the ""neutral", where crappy maltyness and crappy hoppyness balance out, not perfectly, but cancelling one another and simply blending odd coloured liquids wih no grace. Gee, makes you crave for those kronenbourgs in line!"
"In summary, a thirst quencher on a summers day. Serve cold."
"This beer was extremely dry for a lager (which is a good thing in my book) and was easy to down. I had four of them with my meal at Edamame Vietnamese Restaurant (Dallas) and I will definitely be having this beer again."
" At first there is not much that differentiates this from standard North American-style lagers, although it does have a bitterness level that is slightly higher than most rice beers. It is rather refreshing for about the first half of the bottle. After that there is a disagreeable ‘funkiness’ in the aroma that starts to creep in, making it a bit of a chore to finish."
"The taste is very full, dry, and crisp. There are big malt flavors, subtle fruit flavors, and a dry aftertaste. There's little noticeable bitterness, but the hops are effective in adding to the crisp flavor. This beer is great with meals, and compliments asian foods well."
"Brilliantly clear, pale golden, forming a thin white head atop medium sized bubbles with poor retention and sparse lacing. Carbonation is moderate. Aroma is lightly of clove with a strong, ""corny"" adjunct aroma & no noticeable hops. Taste is weak with pale malts, corn, and alcohol. Mouthfeel is bright and fizzy with a light body. Finish is light with distant earthy hops, more corn, and a brisk astringency with hints of malt husk. Comparable to any continental macrobrew, particularly MGD."
"Thanks to NeroFiddled for this one!"
"bah bah (33) in Vietnamese. The pale yellow color gives you the light malt you expect. Some notes of grass and corn are detected. Light sharp metallic hops seem bland at first but improve with each swallow. Lightly sweet. Faint cornhusk aroma. The white head dissipates rapidly. Certainly worth a try."
"Very faint malt in the aroma, perhaps some light corn as well. Pretty standard appearance, yellow with some bubbles and a slight head. There is just a bit of light, sweetish maltiness, then a mild bitterness. Fizzy palate, light body. Better than Budwieser, but pretty boring stuff."
"The prototypical lager/pils pour, a crystal clear golden yellow, the head modest in size, bright white and frothy in its texture. Nose is all malt, clean and fresh, the start lightly sweet and malt laden with the top cadaverous. Finish is stingingly acidic, hops sparse, and the aftertaste dry. A beer that was readily available to us Gobs while running the Mekong Delta, but still taste like I remember Bad, even 35 years ago, I did not really care for Light bodied lagers."
"Maybe it was the setting, a big Vietnamese buffet, but this beer was quite nice. It wasn't macro ricefest I was expecting. Reminded me of a true German Helles. Suble flavors with no harshness, no hoppiness either, but not all beers need to be superhopped. A pleasant surprise."
"A fresh bottle from the initial distributor. Clear, golden in color with a brass cast and a bright white head that holds well. It drops to a good collar but leaves no lace. The aroma is mainly of a sweet, grainy, and husky malt but there's an odd vegetal aroma as well - it's light, but noticeable. The body is thin with a very fine, crisp carbonation. The flavor is of a semi-sweet, grainy & husky malt that's fairly well backed by hop bitterness. It finishes crisp and dry with just a residual husky maltiness in the mouth. An average beer that's not really well brewed and seems slightly unbalanced. Still, it has some bitterness to it and it does have a refreshing quality. Overall, not worth looking for."
"Completely unremarkable in every way. The only positive thing about it is that I can now say I have had a Vietnamese beer. Tastes like your standard American macro fare. Weak color, flavor and texture."
"Horribly thin and sweet. Probably close to the worst brew i've had, one of the few many that is isn't ""humanly"" possible to finish, i think my sink liked it though, coz it seemed to go down it pretty fast. Putrid fizzy yellow swill, very artificial."
"Notes: Well in their kind of weather would you want any other beer that you could not quaff faster than this one? Similar to every other macro beer around the world with no surprises. So if you feel inclined to try a beer from Viet Nam, go for it."
"33 Export, from the Nam:  Slightly dark golden lager, with a pure white head that disappears very quickly.  Very light aroma, and very light body.  Spicy hop bite, and very highly carbonated.  With the tang of hops and the tang of the bubbles, this was as lively a beer as I’ve had in a long while.  The problem was, it was like hot sauce from Taco Bell, why bother?  Might be good with bad hot food, but do not go out of your way for it."
