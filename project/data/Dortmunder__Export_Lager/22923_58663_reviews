"Extremely well balanced, perhaps the best lager out of Canada to meet our lips to date. The drinkability scale is showing off the charts. Pit this up blindly against a fine German lager, and we'd have a tough time picking which one is from Canada."
"Lager's personally aren't my favorite style, but it's hard to be a pint of Yellowhead premium lager on the rare occasion Edmonton has a hot day. For the best quality, stop by the brewery downtown and fill up a growler; it's cheap, environmentally friendly, and you get the freshest possible product."
"I will look for it again next time I am in Edmonton."

"O - always glad to see a new local brewer, this one seems to be made for the average Joe beer drinker, and while I am an average Joe in general, I am not when it comes to beer, so I have to rate it average overall"

"Overall, this is WAY better than I remember. I might have to make this a regular part of my beer fridge! My first bottle must have been bad. Or perhaps they hadn't figured things out when the brewery was just getting started. Glad that there's another quality beer in E-town."
"Not a bad beer, a little fuller and sweeter than I prefer for a session lager."
"Bottle: Poured a golden color ale with a relatively large white foamy head with OK retention and minimal lacing. Aroma of lightly sweet malt with clean cereal notes is refreshing. Taste is also dominated by clean cereal taste with lightly sweet ending. Body is quite full with good carbonation. Not bad but lacking fresher cereal notes and maybe some light crisp hops."
"Underwhelming, it has room to grow if they work out the kinks, however for now I have no desire to have another one of these."
"It's an interesting beer - definitely not boring, in a style of beer that are usually quite boring. I think I like it."
"Poured into a glass mug. Three finger fluffy off white head on a deep golden yellow. Good head retention. Some moderate lacing. Malty smell. Caramel in the taste. Sweetish. Light hop finish. A bit weak. Medium body. Not bad drinkability. No real flaws but the sweetness would get a bit cloying after a while."
"A mild, but well-balanced and flavourful German-style bright lager. I'm looking forward to trying it on tap this summer."
