3.42,1.5,3,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"Poured into a Celebrator pokal. Pours a light, slightly hazy golden amber. Thin white head that dissipates rapidly to a ring around the glass. Aroma of sweet caramel and bready malt. Flavor follows, with light sweet bready malt, slight caramel and a hint of light fruit. Finish is attenuated and slightly dry. Light bodied. Nothing outstanding, but the light flavor is pleasant, and something I would have again with a meal or sitting in Ethiopia with no craft beer store in sight.","LiquidAmber","Apr 07, 2012"

3.59,6.5,3,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Overall, this was a pleasant surprise! Nothing outstanding by any means, but certainly better than a lot of other typical lagers. I might have to keep my eyes open for other ethiopian beers in the future.","evlu1441","Nov 19, 2010"
2.99,-11.3,4,2.5,3,3.5,3,"This Lager pours a crystal golden color with a mild white head that fades quickly. There is almost no aroma. The taste is slightly sweet and hoppy with a pleasant but brief fizzing in the mouth. This is not an unpleasant beer and if I lived in Ethiopia I would probably drink it regularly. With so many other choices of good import and domestic beers in the Mid-West this will not be one of my top choices.","Internatbrewlove","Mar 22, 2009"
3.52,4.5,3,3.5,3.5,3,4,"Not knowing at all what to expect from a heretofore to me unexperienced African nation's brewing prowess, I can say that this is not too shabby. More reminiscent of malty British pale ales, but I can't fault the existing classification either. Interesting, and plainly drinkable.","biboergosum","Mar 15, 2009"
3.06,-9.2,4,3,3,3,3,"D= An ok beer, but there are about three dozen examples of this style that I like better. Clean flavor through and through though and at paired well with Ethiopian cuisine.","spointon","Mar 14, 2009"
2.68,-20.5,3,2.5,2.5,3,3,"Drinkability: As it is a guest in this country, I'll politely tolerate it. You've had one lager from a third world country, you've had them all.","ChainGangGuy","Oct 29, 2008"
2.83,-16,3,2.5,3,2.5,3,"From a twelve ounce brown bottle - Pours pale/straw color with a tad of haze, no carbonation or head. Smells of sweet corn adjuncts and not much hops in the aroma. First sip is malty sweet with corn dominating the Malts. My second beer from Ethiopia and both were better tasting than I thought they would. Pretty good for the style.","ATLbeerDog","Jun 24, 2008"
3.67,8.9,3.5,4,3.5,3,4,"D: Someone at the table mentioned that it beats the hell out of BMC. I have to agree. It is light, and tasty. May actually enjoy it on a hot summer day.","tpd975","Sep 29, 2006"
3.85,14.2,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"D- This beer was very light but had a nice note of caramel for some character. I could see this as a great beer for a session in the 90 degree shade. The tang note does increase as the beer warms which gets in the way of the malt a bit.","rhoadsrage","Dec 20, 2005"
3.56,5.6,4,3,3.5,4,4,"This was a pleasant surprise. I've tried other Ethiopian beers in the past and have been quite disappointed with their weak rice-y beers, but this one was quite different. It pairs well with Ethiopian fare (go figure) but would also pair nicely with a smooth chevre or possibly even some Thai dishes. I couldn't see myself buying cases of this brand, but I could see a nice summer day spent sipping down a few sixers. Definitely worth a try, it was a very pleasant surprise.","Jaynuze","Beers"
3.57,5.9,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"I had this at Merkato, a restaurant/market in the Little Ethiopia section of Los Angeles. The pour is an uninspiring, slightly hazy, yellow gold with a small white head, even in the Tom Collins glass that they gave me. The lacing was decent. Lots of doughy malt in the nose with faint noble hop aromas. The taste is pretty much along those lines- biscuity and doughy malts, grain and a hint of sweetness finishes with a subtle, pilsner-influenced bitterness. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with a little less carbonation then average. This beer is solid and drinkable. It exceeded my expectations and then some.","goschool","0"
