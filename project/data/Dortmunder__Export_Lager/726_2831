Aroma was subtle, a sweet biscuit malt with hints of fruity herbal hops, perhaps a bit of sour candy. Taste was surprisingly sweet malt with a medicinal sweet spice almost like candied ginger. Some mineral bitterness on the finish but a round sweetness persists as well. My impression is that the residual sugars are too much for the style. Could use a drier finish although this is in the ballpark. Under carbonated, more fizz might balance things and lift up the hops.","CalgaryFMC","Sep 02, 2013"

Some bisquits in the middle with yeast taste finishing it out. The feel is light crisp and refreshing on this hot day, A bit of a bite from the carb and some hop taste sticks on the tounge a bit.

The body is quite light, with a light moderate carbonation, a nearly watery feel, and a crisp finish.

4.1,26.5,4,4,4,4,4.5,"Well, now! I have been drinking a lot of IHLNC's Dortmunder of late, so I am anxious to see how this compares and vice versa. Oh, the nose was immediate! The scent of quality malted barely took no time in wafting around my kitchen. Zounds! I had two fingers' worth of dense, bone-white head sitting atop the beer. The beer itself was a deep golden-yellow with NE-quality clarity. One good sniff and I was transported to a grain mill room at any of the better brewpubs. This was two-row barley malted to produce a sweet smell unlike any other. Mouthfeel was medium with a great dryness brought on by the hops mentioned on the CAN. It suddenly struck me just how good a brewer we have in Paul Rutherford at IHLNC - I might be hard-pressed to tell the diffeence in a blind side-by-side. Finish had a characteristic lager-like sweetness. It is difficult to quantify, but when you put a quality lager next to an American macro-Lager, it becomes easy to see what a pale imitation most AmeriCANs are drinking on a routine basis. This was very good! Definitely merits consideration for the cooler!","woodychandler","May 18, 2010"

There are some spicy hops in there, but they never make it past the sweetness, and neither does the light bitterness that pops its head in towards the end. The mouthfeel is slightly slick, which is not what I was expecting. I'm not a stickler for style, but when it's a pilsner I have some expectations and this beer missed on a few.

There¬ís no real sweetness to the malt here, and it tends to be reminiscent of crackers.

The aroma of my sample has shades of green bottle skunk, but not overwhelming like Beck's or Heineken. More hops are apparent as the beer warms: perhaps Spalt? The taste is defined by a mineral ""heft"" from the Dortmunder water which is high in sulfates.  Many drinkers think this harshness is from a spoiled beer, but it is the result of the water not the brewer. As the beer warms its maltier base becomes apparent, but the ""saltiness"" lingers from the water.

3.73,15.1,3.5,3,4,3,4.5,"This was surprisingly good and inexpensive. Substantial malt presence, this beer has a real backbone and full flavor. Hops are strong and quite zesty but kept perfectly in check. Very drinkable; I could imagine spending a happy evening with this brew. Green bottle and travel distance are only drawbacks, and the odor wasn't wonderful. Still, I wish this was more readily available. The price was right (I think I payed $6 a sixer?). Heineken, Becks, and Amstel drinkers would especially enjoy this; it is far superior to those widespread and offensive beers.","Thrasher","Apr 26, 2002"
