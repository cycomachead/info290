"500 ml bottle into lager glass, best before 10/5/2013. Pours slightly cloudy golden straw color with a 1 finger fairly dense white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Light spotty lacing clings on the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of bready grain, cracker, floral, pear, apple, light pepper, biscuit, and herbal earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance of light fruity esters with malt/hop notes; with good strength. Taste of bready grain, cracker, floral, pear, apple, light pepper, biscuit, and herbal earthiness. Lingering notes of bread, cracker, floral, light pepper, and herbal on the finish for a short bit. Good balance of malt/hop flavors with light-moderate fruitiness; and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth and fairly crisp mouthfeel that is nice; without feeling too thin. Alcohol is very well hidden with hardly any warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a very good dortmunder style. Very clean with good balance of flavors and minimal esters; and very smooth to drink. A nicely enjoyable offering."

"Without going over the top with an in depth analysis, this is a good cheap lite tasting beer that works well with fast foods. Overall there is nothing too complex about it; this is trouble-free light lager made of barley malt and hops. Not a common beer to be found in my location, but still miles better than most in its price range and yet still very drinkable."

"The taste is OK. Not real clean, though, like it's been in this bottle too long. I am not sure I would buy this again, but maybe. It just isn't very exciting."

"O-this is an example of a great german lager. i truly could drink large amounts of this in a sitting. it goes down so easily with a fresh taste of beer."
"This beer is light bodied with heavy carbonation. At times I felt like I was drinking pop rather than beer. There is a slight dry finish."
"Grab it if you can find it for less than $ 7...otherwise avoid if you have to pay full price."

"overall not that good at all.... never seen this beer before and i bought it thinking it was going to be more of a wit beer... then i poured it. oh well.... if you see it pass it up!!"
"Feels light and goes down easy. For the price this isn't a bad pick."
"""Brewed and bottled by Dortmunder Hansa-Brauerei GMBH, 4415 Dortmund, Germany"""
"Not all that great specimen of this beer."
"O - Not for me. Pass."
"As noted earlier by a BA member. Maybe, just maybe, if it was served super ice cold on a hot sweaty day would I welcome this again"
"Overall this was an average example Export Lager. It was pretty light and smooth which made for good drinkability. The flavors weren't too impressive, but they remained true to the style. I thought I was buying a traditional German Export lager, and it was pretty close to that, it was just brewed in Namibia instead of Germany.I wouldn't search this beer out but it might hit the spot on a hot summer afternoon."
"Drinkability is it best attribute. Very easy drinking session beer. Very refreshing but not something that wows you. I definately could put down alot of these fast. I would drink this again for sure if I wanted something light and not too strong, but I definately wouldn't go searching for this."
"I like Dortmunders, they have a unique taste. This baby comes in a 16oz bottle and is on sale at my store for 6.49....can't beat it! Pours a bubbly yellow color with a fine head. Smell musty with a little hop spiceyness. Taste is clean and crisp, true to the German purity law. A good beer to sit back and chill with but don't expect heaps of flavor."
"Well just got another 2 cases for $25/ in NJ. They got rid of the 'canned' hops! though now using hop extract. Also now using a super aga that makes capping these bottles a breeze."
" The bottle says ""Brewed and bottled in Germany", Dortmunder Hansa-Brauerei, GMBH, 44145 Dortmund/Germany."
"Notes: I am very dissapointed in this beer as when I picked it up I had Great Lakes Dortmunder Gold in mind. I do not recommend this beer unless you want to try and rate something from Namibia."
"this is an everyday brew. not bad. not great in the least! there are plenty of better average brews out there i'd take over this. and yet, i'd take this over most anything from coors or anheuser. so there ya go."
"Drinkability: Well, the mouthfeel leans towards giving this a high drinkability..combined with the fairly mild and unoffensive taste, this works out."
"Recommended..."
"pours straw yellow with a monster head with nice lacing from a half liter bottle. don't smell like much but i can detect some hops in there somewhere... took a couple sniffs though. taste is pretty average to minimal. it seems like it's kind of flat or something. which is weird because the head and the lacing are impressive. but it doesn't seem carbonated enough. it is not bad. but nothing special. but it does have a unique taste to it. drinkability is good though. the best thing about this beer is the bottles...half liters. buy these and use the bottles for your homebrew! they're totally drinkable. i could have like 6....5 more to go! CHEERS!"
"Served from a pint bottle into a mug, this beer is a nice straw-amber color with a finger head that dissipates after a minute - about what you would expect from any ""typical"" beer. The nose is very typical, and what you would expect from any European lager. The taste is about the same - nothing special, but very drinkable. There's nothing bad to say about this beer, and for the price (about a dollar for a pint) I think I may actually pick it up again. This is a big step above similarly priced beers..."
"The pour is a light gold color with a white head that quickly disipates. The aroma is lightly fruity with light hops presence Flavors are complimentary with a nice light malt the hops come through late in the finish but, coupled with the crisp carbonation is just enough to make you want another sip. Mouthfeel and drinkability are both what would be expected form such a light beer. Overall, a good brew when you need a quick thirst quencher."
"Poured a bright golden color with monstrous white puffy head. Smell is a bit fruity and sweet. Taste is refreshing, but very subdued, with little to cheer about. Finishes crisp, with a slight malt sweetness and no hops. An average beer. Too expensive for what you get."
"Clear golden color and mildly effervescent with a thin white head that lasts pretty well. Not much lacing evident. Aroma of bready malt and Lager-like hops. Light-bodied and very clean on the tongue. Mild malt and caramel flavors along with a bit of hops. The finish is mildly sweet malt and corn and does not linger. Below average, I would expect more from a Dortmunder from the city of Dortmund."
"Another one please!!! This has the Shbobdb 'simple beer' seal of approval. MMmmm."
"High drinkability marks, because it goes down as easy as a regular lite beer. At around eight bucks for a sixer, though, you might as well go for a 12 pack of Whateverthefuck Lite."
"This beer is golden in color with white head that quickly dissapears. There a light malt smell to it with a hint of hops. The flavor is mainly of the malt and mildly sweet. Nice carbonation. This light to medium bodied beer that is crisp and refreshing."
"This beer poured a clear and bright golden color, had a small but creamy white head and left an intricate lacing on the glass. A vibrant carbonation tickles the tongue. The aroma gives off sweet lemony grains and fresh malts. The taste is very light and very clean, almost lemony fresh. The body is light, but overall there is a firm body of malt holding this beer together. Lively and musty hops bring this beer together. Very nice."
"Pours a clear gold with a thin white head... a bit too pale to be called a Dortmunder. Aroma is grainy... with a light touch of floral hops... had to strain to get much aroma though. Flavor isn't bad... some sweet grain and a touch of biterness. Basically this is a very boring beer... nothing special... no hoppiness... no complexity... Mouthfeel is light and crisp. Not offensive or flawed... but when I'm looking for a really good Dortmunder, I'll be looking somewhere other than Hansa."
"This brew is a pale gold color, with a decent sized white foam head. The scent is of pale malts. As for the taste it is a delicate tasting brew, with sweet malts in the front and a delicate hop presence balancing it out. Cereal grains. Smooth creamy mouthfeel. I'll admit ive never had a dortmunder style brew before, so i cant really know what they are going for, but for me this is a fine beer."
"Sinkability  Im sure Ill need to chase this with some Liquid Plummer, but it was just too bad to stomach."
