"Golden color, malty and delicious"
"O - Pass."
""
"Overall: Pretty solid - this is my first encounter with Flensburger and whilst it's unlikely to win any prizes for depth or complexity the fact remains that it's a good, crisp-tasting lager."

"Flensburger Gold has a thin, white head, a mostly clear, bubbly, golden appearance, and some minor lacing left behind. You can, upon close inspection, see some fine white specs roiling about the beer, so it is not super filtered. Aroma is of rich, pungent, sweet & sour barley malt and a slight grass. Taste is of the same thing, with a noticeable biscuit note, across the sip. Mouthfeel is medium, and Flensburger Gold finishes crisp and refreshing. No complaints, here. RJT"

"This is an export lager so it's not gonna have earth shattering bold flavors it's gonna be a malt tilted more subtle lager and should be reviewed as such...there done with my rant.Pours a pale light golden with a thinner white head in my stein.Aromas of honey malts and iron with a bit toasted grain.Flavors are pretty dry and grainy at the onset with a little of the German iron element to it,hops are subtle and light with mild sweetness in the finish.No frills but easy drinking,a no brainer for a hot day like today."

"O: loads of taste and VERY drinkable ... it's a great alternative to the German pilsener, and at times it's so sweet and fruity that you get some of the English pale ale sweet twang. it's perhaps a bit watery, but the taste is full-strength, so it works out just fine. a beer I will definitely grab again."

"It has decent flavor and is easy drinking and enjoyable."
"Overall: This is what beer is all about....barley, yeast, subtle but simple flavors. The only way this beer could be better to me? A tiny, tiny bit less maltiness. Overall, a great German lager."

"O- Not what I was expecting at all. Try it."

"This one just slides down the throat. The Germans know how to brew a clean lager, for shure."
"O: This is a nice Dortmunder with a little of everything. Not bad at all!"
""
""
"O: On the whole, this is an average, undistinguished Euro lager. Very forgettable."

"I poured this smelly beer into my tumbler at 45 degrees. The beer was dark blond and the beer poured a big white head. However that head went away fast. The beer had a real pop to it when opened. The beer was really stinky smelling not typical skunk smell but just stunk. Beer was a little sweet tasting had good lacing also. Besides the smell I would buy again."

"Overall: This beer was a conundrum for me. Looked okay out of the bottle. It brought you in with the nose, but left you hanging with the taste profile. Expecting to have an awful drink, it was clean and didn't leave anything unwanted. Very different from the Shiner Frost that I previously tried. Can't wait to trying out some more Dortmunder style beers to figure this one out."
"Don't know that this has the presence to be called a Dortmunder, though it is pretty chewy. This comes at the cost of hops, which are largely AWOL. Adds up to a pleasant but indistinct package."
"Overall: Just a bit too much sweet malt flavor for my palate; otherwise a decent lager"
"This is a little sweeter than many German lagers, but it is rich and delicious nonetheless."
"My bottle is not clear and multiple stores that carry this are not carrying any of this line in clear bottles. I tried the wheat previously and liked it and find this quite good as well."
"Easy and high drinkable thought its clean character."
"The beer pours a yellow color with a white head. The aroma is grain and grass. The flavor is grass and grain, with a little something that tastes like peanuts mixed in. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. There is nothing good going on with this beer. Definitely not one to seek out."
"Pleasantly surprised by this lager, but I confess to liking the style in general. Pours rich golden color, no haze, with white head up top. Nose is light but has a soft grainy character. On the palate there's a moderately flavorful malt component with some herbal-metallic hops to round it out nicely. Nice little hop ""spice"". Finishes on the dry side a little for me."
"I mean, it is what it is, it is a cheap export lager, don't expect a Munchiner Helles over here, still the beer is unique and I will give it that."
"Overall, it was a nice experience having the Flensburger Gold. I can have plenty of them on a hot, summer day. Though I would like to try some more of the Dortmunders out there before I give a final verdict on this one."
"Drinkability: Not a great beer, but certainly worth a taste. This one comes at a good price, too, so it's one that could be had affordably over and over."
"Saw this at my local beer distributor. I've alw"
"It's a nice beer, and it'd be easy to drink a few of them in a session. But I'd much rather spend my money on bigger, bolder beers."
"Decent drinkability. Nothing outstanding, but a decent beer. Probably wouldn't have it again."
"Its very drinkable when compared to other low ABV lighter beers ive had that are just horrible. Its pretty drinkable, great for a lighter beer. I would just need too many. Dortmunder? Guess its my first."
"One side note: I plan on buying MUCH more of this beer, not ONLY because I enjoyed it, but because of the unique bottle. I plan on home-brewing again and these are the kind of bottles that will save you money on caps. Grolsh bottles are the same, but I don't care fro Grolsh, so this is a welcome alternative at $1.50 a bottle!"
"proper and just above average. had a first bottle and a bottle about a year old. nose is quite nice on both... something resembling a musty twig woodiness... quite earthy. not a balance malt quality. some bit of honey finish that is nice. not as resilient as some though. the age gave the fruit of the matter a bit more acidic a quality. doesn't really bring out anything palatable."
"Got this bottle a few weeks ago at Surdyk's in Minneapolis. Poured with a medium, off-white head with a little lace. Color is a slightly tarnished, clear brass. Aroma was very nice: reminded me of walking by our local regional brewery - of cooking malt and a little hops. Fresh. Flavor's the same plus some extra sweetness, heavy grain flavor with a little bread dough. Good body from all the malt. Decent carbonation. Finish is short to medium and like the flavor of eating malted grain. Not bad, but a little too much simple malt flavor for my taste."
"The taste is brisk and snappy with a pale toasty malt flavor. Hops come in and add a slight bittering on the finish to offset some of the malty sweetness. There is plenty of flavor packed into this brew and would be an excellent choice to give to a BMC drinking friend. Good price tag at only a buck and a half for a single."
"Flenburger Gold poured not surprisingly gold, with a decent sized white head, and nice lacing. The smell was malty with almost no hops. I found the nose to not be very fresh smelling. The taste was malty sweet. Very little hop bite. Mouthfeel was a bit light and to me seemed to lack carbonation a bit. Could have been a bit more crisp. Drinkability was good. Overall this was a decent lager. More of a novelty with its ceramic pop top. At $2.99 a bottle I will probably only buy this on rare occasions. But the bottles are keepers for home brewing."

"Poured from a 12oz. dark brown flip-top bottle into a pint glass. Poured a murky gold color with a large white head, lots of carbonation. There is a grainy smell, with a strong feel of apples. The taste is a bit watered down, drinks really easy with the apple taste up front and a bitter aftertaste. I'm not really digging on this one, too watery and light for my tastes."
"Pours slightly foggy gold. Sweet grains on the nose. Seems like a touch of apples as well. A bit too sweet. Out of balance. Feel is sticky and a bit slick. Lower carbonation. This is just okay at best. Way too out of balance on the sweet and not really motivating me to finish it."
"Have a golden color; in the smell are essences of grains and caramel; good foam, quantity of alcohol and body acceptable; the taste is good, combines a smooth bitter with malts, with an accentuated and fresh sensation and carbonation; has a cork species instead of bottlecap; tasty to enjoy it with fish or sea food; The mouthfeel its not very good."
"[Mouth] The flavor is sweet and smooth the sweet side finishes with some bitter flavor. good for your first step in to the German Beers"
"Tastes much more fresh, relatively speaking. The malt is sweet, zippy, and fruity like gum. The hops just are barely there. Whether they got burned off from age or they were never there is a matter for god to figure out."
"The taste is mostly toasted malts, adjunct sweetner, some hoppiness on the backend that dries things out a bit. There is a definite crispness to the beer and a honey like taste in the mid section. More sweet malts come through as the beer settles. This is a slightly better than average lager, nothing more, nothing less. There is a modest degree of carbonation and the aftertaste is quite slight. A refreshing lager, but not in my top ten."
"The appearance is golden with an adequate cream-colored head. The smell is very suttle, a hint of malts & toasty. It tastes bitter with a hint of wheat. Not much aftertaste. Mouthfeel is crisp, clean, & just a little acidic. Drinkability is just average because although it is rather smooth, there's not much taste or smell."
"Avoidable."
"D - This is an ok session beer with more flavor than US light lagers. Actually went well with a piece of cheesecake I ate while drinking this."
"From a clear swing-topped 33 cl bottle: The color on this beer is a rich yellow-gold, with nice transparency. Disappointingly, the head is shallow and film-thin. Nice continental hop aroma, but very straightforward. There's a little grain, and faint faint smells in the back of the nose. The beer is soft, and a bit sweet. The sense of sweetness intensifies as the beer warms. The taste has a little fresh bread and yeast flavors as well. Medium body and relatively low carbonation. This is a nice, straightforward and satisfying beer. It's nothing extraordinary, but it's well made and enjoyable in and of itself."
"Hazy pale bronze color with a fluffy white, crusty two fingers showing really good retention. Aroma is generally spicy and bitter hops, honey sweetness and with caramel malt and nuttiness at a lesser degree. Very dry husky grain, yeasty sourness that fades midway through, a steady bitterness, and honey notes. Assertively dry and the flavor is gone almost before swallowed leaving nothing but some dry herbals in the finish. Thin watery mouthfeel with some crisp medium carbonation. Not overly exciting but good for the style and very quaffable."
"Pours a pleasing gold colour with a thick, foamy white head that lasts a good way through the beer and leaves quite a bit of lacing. Malt is very noticeable in both smell and flavour, but has enough hops to cancel out the sweetness. Crisp and clean, but a little too much carbonation for me. Of all the Flensburgers, I've found this to be the best session beer as it's not too strongly flavoured like the pilsener and dunkel and slips down a little easier than the hef."
"D - Good drinkability. I am liking this German brewery with the cool little bottles."
"Flensburger gold indeed pours a gold color with a white head that sticks around for a while from a clear swing top bottle. Malt is definitely noticeable in the aroma in a pleasant way. Kind of a cracker like malt flavor dominates, there are some hops balancing it out. Thankfully, no hints of skunk, which I feared due to the clear bottle. Pleasant beer, I could probably session this."
"Golden body. Lots of carbonation surfacing slowly. A one finger white cap of froth sticks around for a while. Aroma is bready malts. Hay. And grainy sweetness. Crisp flavor of cracker like breadiness. Sweet dough and smooth malts. Hops add a dryness to it all. Nicely done. Mouthfeel is crisp. Body is medium. Always good to find another well done dortmund style lager. There's simply not enough of them around."
"Pours a dark honey with a frothed head that goes down to thin layer of white over the body. Leaves some interesting lacing patterns. Bready malts with hints of honey and floral hops are in the nose. The malt is pretty sturdy and there are present some floral and tea-like hops. What knocks the taste down is a somewhat present ethanol character that didn't sit well with me. Mouthfeel is moderate in body and mildly carbonated. Solid drinker."
"Opinion: This is a pretty good beer. Again, I wonder about the shelf-life, so I am sure that there will be some bad reviews come in from this beer. Know that this style is fragile, and it won't hold up to the heat and fluorescent lights that it will likely get in the majority of stores that will stock it. I think that the clear bottle was a bad move on the part of the brewer, but a fresh example of this beer isn't too bad."
"Not much else to say about this one...as Dortmunders go, it's a keeper."
"An alright beer, with no obvious flaws, but nothing about it stands out."
"Drinkability/notes: Pleasant and drinkable, although mediocre for a German beer."
"Flensburger Gold is my first beer from a German brewery that I had no knowledge of until this week when I spotted a few of their offerings in a local beer store. If this one is representative, it's no wonder that they haven't gotten more ink (or whatever the internet equivalent of ink is). I'll be interested to see if some of the other styles from Flensburger Brauerei fare any better."
"PH"
"Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: The beer was light bodied with ample carbonation. This is an ok sessionable beer."
"Overall Impression: A Mexican style lager from Germany? Enjoyable and interesting, but not one Id crave."
"Bottle color may matter, I really liked the Pils, it comes in a brown bottle, where thisone is clear."
"Cool 11.2 swing top green tinted bottle pours a clear golden color with a big white fluffy head that leaves a good lacing in my glass. Skunky aromas, light bready, cracker and lemon flavors. Medium bodied with a really nice soft mouthfeel, finishes dry."
