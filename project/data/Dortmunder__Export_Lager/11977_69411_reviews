"Final Grade: 3.84, a solid B+. This is not really one of my favourite German lager styles, but Howe Sound's Lager is still definitely one of the best Dortmunders I've had the opportunity to try. The malts provide a clean, biscuity sweetness that is perfectly countered by the grassy, floral European hop bill. This is not a complex beer, but it manages to provide everything I expect from this style in spades. German lager fans will definitely want to give this one a shot, but anyone looking for something straightforward to glug back in a social environment should consider this a perfectly valid selection."

"M: Surprisingly chewy, I could use a bit more bitterness but this is definitely an enjoyable lager."

"O. I really love this beer. Super versatile, as it pairs with most foods really well. I call the lager that has character. It is malty and smooth yet flavourful. It's in my top three beers."

"Overall - Wow, this was a disappointment. This must be an off can. Cloyingly sweet and sour flavours. Howe Sound is known for a much higher standard of beer and this does not fit into their lineup. Unfortunately, this is a drain pour. Will maybe try a different can and re-review."

"A rather full-flavoured lager, with a decent aromatic structure. Leave it to this brewer to make a complex, quite drinkable, and simply packaged lager. But here it is."
"Thanks to my boss who brought a can back from his whistler vacation...I had a chance to part take! The beer pours a slightly hazy golden color with a fluffy white head. Aroma is faint, from what is present, there is a bready tone. Good flavor of malt and nuts with some light bitterness. Nice mouthfeel, medium bodied and well carbonated. Drinkability is quite good, and I could have several if given a chance!"
"for style I thought it was pretty good, I'm not saying this is going to make your day like a giant stout or DIPA but its a satisfying I could drink again"
"Pours a light honey color, with a fluffy head that mostly disappears, leaving a minimum of lacing. Smells sweet, with some bread, mineral, and hops. The flavor is all noble hops, with some bitterness balanced out by sweet malts and a nutty finish. Has a light mouthfeel, with moderate carbonation. This is a very easy-drinking and refreshing lager, probably my favorite from BC. I could definitely knock back a few of these on a hot afternoon. It beats ass over any of the macros, any day of the week."
"Overall, this is a good beer and certanly worth trying. For me, it isn't really worth seeking out again, but it was definitely worth a try."
"Pours a slightly hazy golden color with a fluffy white head. Aroma is sweet and bready with some nuttiness. Good flavor of malt and nuts with some light bitterness. Nice mouthfeel, medium bodied and well carbonated. Drinkability is quite good, this is probably the best BC produced lager I've tried so far!"
"Enjoyed on tap at the brewpub. Nothing to look at, neutral colour. Neutral aroma. The taste is a little lagerish with a fizzy carbonation. Like a macro with organic like ingrediants. They do make better beer. Moer drinkable than the canned version. Newer, summer product."
"I love their 1L bottles, but I also love a good craft in a can. Hopefully the do some more lagers!"
