"Overall, not too bad, but not all that great either. Average beer all around. No desire to pick up again."

"Had it in an airport hotel in-room minibar, in Sweden. Yes, this is a macrobrew, but as some of the other reviewers have stated, it's quite drinkable. Yellow in color, a bit of lacing, had a sour smell, not overpowering. The taste is quite sweet, but not in a cloying easy. Well-balanced, with a bit of a sour aftertaste. Quite refreshing, and I'd happily drink it again."

"Actually a plastic bottle, 250 ml. Rather easy to drink if you're not into hops, and want a rather sweet beverage."
"D. Two words - Don't bother."
"Average in all ways, not really good but not bad either. Smells a bit of corn, all in all nothing special. Nevertheless I liked this beer and it served me well. I was still able to drink much with my friends, when I had a sore throat! It was very smooth in all ways. Take it for what it is and enjoy. Just a typical beer to drink and have a good time."
"D: Not bad. Quite light and refreshing beer"
"D: This goes down without a hazzle, but who wants that, really?"
"B'ham UK Nov 2009"
"One of the better offerings of IKEA's imports into Great Britain. I thought it tasty and drinkable, unable to remember why now, but it was OK. If I am offered another one day I'll re-reviewe the beer."
"Can- Thanks to Milos for this!A sparkling gold pour with a fizzy white cap. Nose of corn and vegetables, some wet paper, grains and biscuit. Tastes sweet, of grassy hops, grains and sweet veggies. Quick and assertive fizzy finish. Sometimes you just need to shake it like a polaroid picture."
"I did not like the beer and would never buy it again."
"Got a can of this onboard the train from Lund to Stockholm, Sweden. Had a little head with no lace. Color was pale yellow. Aroma was beery with a little citrus. Flavor was common corn adjunct beer with a hint of citric tartness. Body was average for this kind of beer. Finish was the same and instantly forgettable. Mine was only cool and of course would be better cold."
"Drinkability gets a 3.5 because I am Swedish !"
"A friend gave me a 33CL can from a recently trip to Sweden. Poured in a glass, the brew presented a thick white head that rapidly dissipated with almost non-existent lacing. Nose was weakly malted. Color was nice golden yellow. This beer has excessive carbonation. This was the one feature that caught my attention about this beer as I have never seen a beer this active before. The taste was dry which I dont mind. The beer is quite bitter initially, but tones down as the glasses end nears. Mouth feel is thin and watery. While I would not turn down another if offered, I will not seek out this brew as many far better lagers are available."
"Now I've moved around a bit more among the beers, but I'll still say I like this a bit. Might be good memories, I don't know."
"A rather anonymous lager, Dortmunder or not."
"Useless."
