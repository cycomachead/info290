3.31,14.9,3.5,2.5,3.5,4,3.5,"Another "fun fact": This is the second most sold beer in Sweden, after Sofiero Original - Sofiero is one of the cheapest ones at Systembolaget, while Mariestads is considered "premium" as it costs 5 SEK extra (and I actually understand why).","stjaernstoft","Oct 04, 2010"

2.38,-17.4,2.5,2,2.5,3.5,2,"Drinkability: Well, unlike most lagers, this beer doesn't strike me as particularly sessionable since it ends up unpleasant rather than boring and generic. So while the malt/hops balance is on point, Spendrups managed to make this beer completely unbearable, especially for Dortmunder fans such as myself. Unremarkable and i'm being nice.","endovelico","Jan 10, 2010"
2.63,-8.7,3,2.5,2.5,2.5,3,"D: Low. To be avoided. Once in the IKEA in the mood for a beer, go to the Old Gold (also from Spendrups Bryggeri) witch is at least, decent.","eduardolinhalis","Jan 04, 2010"

3.05,5.9,3.5,3.5,3,3,2.5,"Had a bottle of this at the Lund, Sweden train station cafe. Poured with a big, foamy, frothy, almost creamy texture and color head and lace. Color was a very clear, deep, rich, medium amber. Aroma was malty, caramel, and a hint of cinnamon. Flavor was about the same with bitterness in the finish but sweet overall. Body was average. Nevertheless not a lot going on and basically forgettable.","drpimento","Jul 22, 2006"
3.33,15.6,3.5,3,3.5,3,3.5,"Pours a two finger white head that fades quickly to a thin layer leaving a good lace. Clear amber color. Good carbonation and light-medium bodied. Slight hoppy nose. Flavor is slightly sweet with malt, surprisingly good for a label that has "export" on it. 58 SEK ~ $9.74 Villa Godtheim Restaurant Stockholm. From my notes - 7/7/2008.","jdhilt","Jul 23, 2005"
2.06,-28.5,3,2,2,2,2,"the beer is amazingly shitty. but it was all they had on the train. nothing else i can say about it. I should've assumed when something is labelled "export" it translates to "rubbish".","Andreji","Mar 11, 2005"
2.46,-14.6,3,2,2.5,3,2.5,"A lager with some more diacetyl than many others... I cannot really see why this one is selling so much. It might be the lavish marketing, as this is the premium brand from Spendrups.","bark","Beers"
2.1,-27.1,2,2,2,2,2.5,"Comes on pallate somewhat malty. A reminder of what malt is really makes this beer bad. Sweet sugary hops are in there as well with some carbonation and some alcohol.","stjarnflikka","0"
