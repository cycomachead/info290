4.64,11.3,4,4.25,5,4.75,4.5,"On-tap at City Beer Store (SF). The appearance was a normal lager, light orange/brown and see through. The nose is what first got me. While you get the typical bready lager, there was a noticeable hint of citrus and lemon. It wasn't until I tasted it that I realized what I was in for. This is a supremely drinkable lager. The hop flavor is stronger than any other lager I've had, but it is not bitter at all, which makes it so drinkable. This is my favorite Moonlight offering, and I've loved a few of them. Very happy to have access to all of these","mc4z","Feb 03, 2014"
4.94,18.5,4,5,5,5,5,"Perfect representation of the style per BJCP guidelines. Does not merit perfect score due to slight chill haze. Interesting vanilla aroma is very welcome. As far as taste, this beer is a masterpiece of balance, with the slightest hop presence to subdue a pleasant cereal sweetness. Mouth feel is medium to medium light. Overall, wonderful.","BierGiek","Dec 24, 2013"

4.47,7.2,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"The spiced beer from Moonlight are in the love it or hate it realm, but the traditional styles that Moonlight makes should have appeal for plenty. Lunatic Lager is certainly feeling the love from this BA.","DoubleJ","Beers"
4.2,0.7,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Feel is very clean and crisp the way it should be. Malts are present in the beer, but it has a dry finish and fruity body that makes you feel like there isn't. Drinkability is great as the beer never gets too bitter, has plenty of juicy fruit, and remains lively and excited from the decent carbonation for the entire beer. Can't wait to get more Moonlight beers after this.","veinless","0"
4.3,3.1,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,"Overall, an absolutely killer pale lager. Wish they were all this good. A great session beer, and at 4.1%, nobody in the world (except one or two crazy Brits I know) would deny that this is a session beer.","nickd717","May 26, 2010"

4.03,-3.4,4.5,4,4,4,4,"The taste has a subtle spice with notes of lemon, a touch of bread, and an upper level of low bitterness. Notes of lemon are prominent. The finish is crisp, light, and clean. The beer has a high moderate level of draft carbonation and a crisp, clean mouthfeel.","HopHead84","Jul 06, 2009"
4.03,-3.4,4.5,4,4,4,4,"D - This is what macros should taste like, but don't. A touch bloaty after a while, but otherwise a superb summer afternoon/lawnmower beer.","MasterSki","Apr 21, 2009"
4.35,4.3,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Overall what can I say. I have only ever had two offerings from Moonlight, and both have been fantastic. If I can ever get myself out there I am thinking it would make for a very enjoyable time!","mikesgroove","Mar 11, 2009"

3.8,-8.9,4,4,3.5,3,4.5,"Imperial pint at Jupiter in Berkeley on my second visit during my Northern California trip, reviewed from notes, color is a light golden yellow with a slight orange tint, 1 1/2 inch soapy white head with lots of lacing and good retention, aroma consists of lager yeast, grapefruit, light hops, lemon juice, skunkiness, and bread, taste is balanced with light hops and mellow malt flavors, finish does not linger and this stuff goes down very easy, it better though if it is barely four percent alcohol, skunky yeast rides along in the finish as it warms, light flavor overall, mouthfeel is slightly dry, toasty, and citrusy, very light, thin body, tons of carbonation, could drink a few more of these with no problem, super light on the stomach, always willing to try a new Moonlight brews and I would drink this one again, would be a good beer in the warmer months, recommended","Floydster","Sep 28, 2008"
4.18,0.2,4.5,4,4,4.5,4.5,"The taste is malty, yeasty, and bready, with toasted cracker, a hint of nutty grain with a pronounced but smooth piney hop taste and bitterness steadily developing to balance out the sweetness and give a crisp, bitter-sweet finish and a long, nice nuttygrain-toasted cracker aftertaste. It is refreshing and crisp, but flavourful, with some complexity, and nicely balanced.","Offa","Aug 29, 2008"
4.3,3.1,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"On tap at 515 in Santa Cruz. Poured into a big pilsener glass. Clear golden amber color with two fingers of tan head. Nice thick lacing and substantial retention. Aromas of bread and caramel malt with some hop citrus that melds nicely. Flavor is bready with some lactic character. A touch of caramel malt and a nice piney hop finish with moderate bitterness. Kinda of like an overhopped Boston Lager. Great balance, perfect carbonation, semidry finish, excellent drinkability.","illidurit","Jun 15, 2007"
4.35,4.3,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Poured as an imperial pint at Barclay's in Oakland. The glass was filled to the rim, so little to no head to judge. Beautiful, slightly hazy orangish/golden color. The aromas are relatively light at first, but develop as the beer warms into orange and tangerine citrus, a touch of grapefruit and some sweet malt. The taste is really nice. Some wonderfful orange and grapefruit sweetness up-front, followed by a smooth lager yeast tanginess and a hint of cherry, followed by a surprising bitter tinge of earthy/spicy hops at the finish. If all American All-Malt Lagers were like this, I'd drink them all the time. The mouthfeel is really smooth until the bitter hops kick in and lend a refreshing snap to the beer. Just delicious and a real eye-opener as to what the style can be. I've been drinking Moonlight beers for at least 15-16 years whenever I can find them. I really think this stuff is some of the best crafted, freshest beer you can find, and their beers are absolutely worth seeking out. If you are in the Bay Area and have a chance to drink some- don't passs it up for more sought after beers. Most people don't even know many of their beers exist and of what quality they are. Another just fantastic brew!","Georgiabeer","Jun 15, 2005"
4.3,3.1,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Clear pale gold with a small cap of foam on top. Lots of hops in the aroma, fresh and floral, with a bit of cut grass and some toasty malts. The taste is richly malty before giving way to the dry, hoppy finish. Lots of hops in this lager, lending it a signature West Coast character. The light body and ample carbonation make this one seriously refreshing and sessionable beer. It's a shame this stuff doesn't come in 6 packs.","largadeer","Jun 01, 2005"

4,-4.1,4,4,4,4,4,"Perfectly served at Flavor. Light gold with a dense fluffy white head. Totally clear and bright, brilliant even. Aromas of dense malts, juciy fruits, and bitter German hops. Taste is fresh and hoppy with a great malt back bone that provides the drinker with many complex flavor notes. Mouthfeel is light, but substantial enough to hold it all together and provide and excellent drinkability. not the best, killer beer from this brewery, but still freakin' great.","francisweizen","Beers"
3.2,-23.3,3,3,3.5,3,3,"Light gold color. Medium head. Aroma is grainy and a touch fruity. A medium bodied lager. Malts are mild a touch fruity. Hops are spicy and slightly bitter. Nicely balanced. Slightly more flavor than I expected from a lager. Smooth taste. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly bitter with a touch of roasted malts. Not sure if it supposed to be there or not, but it makes it a little more interesting.","beerguy101","0"
