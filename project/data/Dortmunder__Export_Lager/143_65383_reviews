"I would have to view this as nothing more than average; frankly, it doesn't stand out to me at all. The colour is quite rich and it is smooth, but besides that, it isn't anything too special. There was practically no head, and very little carbonation. I suppose for the price I paid I shouldn't have expected it to be too outstanding. Overall I'll give it a bit above average."

"O: Eh, it could have been worse given the circumstances (a 10 month old 6 pack of a not-so-highly-rated beer), so I'll give it benefit of the doubt. Still a plain and uninspired offering."

"My pour created just over a finger of tawny head with good retention. Color was a ""deep gold"" with NE-quality clarity. Nose smelled of typical lager-like honey-sweetness and grassy hops. I have a much greater appreciation of lagers since embarking on The CANQuest (TM) and this one was making my mouth water. Mouthfeel was medium and just like the nose, the taste was grassy honey. Yum! Finish was semi-dry and quite refreshing. I just mowed my lawn yesterday for potentially the last time this year and this would have made a fantastic accompaniment. Well done, Shiner!"

"(FYI, despite what the label says, this is not an ale)"

"O- Not too shabby. I prefer a hoppy beer but this was a nice change of pace. Very drinkable. Nice session style ale."

"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a dark golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is malty, slightly sweet. Taste is crisp and refreshing, malts, some grains, kind of earthy. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall this makes a good session beer."

""
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a 14 oz ""pint"" glass. Pours a deep straw color with a fluffy white head that leaves some nice lacing. Smells of sweet grain, not much else. Tastes of sweet malt with a few hints of citrus and hops, very well balanced. Carbonation seems a little light but it is fine for the light bodied beer that goes down very smooth. Overall, a very good beer."
"Golden color with a brief flash head and no real lacing, medium-light honey and spice aroma. Clean fresh dry lager biscuit malt flavor stays solidly in tandem with clean fresh herbals and grassy notes through and through. Crisply carbonated, light texture and body... so why does the bottle label say the word ""ale?"" I *hate* it when packaging lies to me! So it loses some overall points for the trickery, unfortunately."
""
"12oz bottle. I’ve had this one a few times now, so about time for a review. Pours a dark amber/copper with a finger-width beige head. Nose is sharp with grassy hops, floral overtones, lemon zest. Crisp feel. Slick finish. Nice hop bite at the onset, followed by a faint citrus kick. Refreshing beer that really hits the spot each and every time."

"O: My first Dortmunder and I'm glad I was able to try this style. Interesting and palate pleasing a great spring time beverage. Great mesh of flavors with the sweet, bitter and mild bread. I will look for this every year."
""
"Overall like most Shiner beers they are light in flavor and easy to drink. This is better than most of the lagers (or light lagers) they put out and its not half bad. Better than all BMC."
"Overall / Drinkability: Quite drinkable - wish I had another. A solidly good beer, but is it an ale or a lager? Label says ale...but it doesn't look that different than the Dortmunder lager also made by Shiner. So is it the same beer or a different one? Can't quite tell, but if this is an ale, I think it's mislabeled and instead it is indeed a Dortmunder export lager. All that potential mislabel aside, it's a good beer that goes well with food (Zucchini cakes in this case) and I suspect it would go well with a lot of other food, or all by itself."
"Overall: Nothing special here. It's drinkable and flavorful enough. Seems like a good beer to enjoy during some springtime yard work. (3.5)"
""
"This is a bland but thirst quenching beer. It's just a little bit better than the usual suspects because the malt and hops are ever so slightly more detectable."
""
"O: Very nice beer, good balance of malt and hops, good ABV, so you could session with this one... Another good Beer from Shiner"
"12 ounce bottle. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours a clear dark gold color with an inch off-white head that sticked around for a little while. There's also a decent amount of lacing left on the glass. The brew smells like bready malt and fruit (apricots?). It tastes like bready/grainy malt, dried fruit, and a bit of herbal hops. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit syrupy with moderate carbonation. Overall it's not a bad brew at all. I bought this as a single bottle so I could try it. Not sure if I'd buy a 6 pack of this or not, but I would try this again in the future."
"O: There’s nothing overly special about this beer but it has some refreshing properties and goes down easily."
""
"O: This beer is pretty easy to drink and could be quite sessionable. Enjoyable and certainly not one I would turn down but not certain I would go out of my way to find it again."
"Overall: In the end I enjoyed this beer. Bought a six pack for $5.99. This is an easy drinking, simple, sessionable beer."
""
""
"Overall- Very drinkable. I can see myself enjoying more of these on a warm day."
"I gave this beer low marks due to the phenolic stale taste. There was no hops flavor to speak of and something was definitely off about this beer. I have contacted Shiner with the pertinent info and am waiting their reply. This may be a bad bottle from the distributor or the brewery. The best that I can describe this initial tasting is as undrinkable. Appearance: beautiful clear golden color Smell: no smell except phenolic Taste : overpoweringingly musty, stale. Body : nice head but..."
""
"O- nice refreshing beer, with a wonderful malt character that reminds me of so many true German beers. Was well balanced with some hop character at the end. Would definitely drink some more."
"Drank straight from a 12 oz bottle, unknown freshness date. The smells are of grass hops, earthy, some bread malts. The feel is lightish, decent carbonation. The taste is somewhat good, light larger taste, grass hops, mild bitterness, earthy malts labor with it."
"Go Shiner seasonals! Last summer's Ruby Redbird was good. A Dortmunder for spring? Excellent. Worth getting six. 4.0"
"This was an interesting beer: a dortmunder called a ""spring ale"" by a brewery known for lagers. It was not refreshing or zesy enough for a top quality dortmunder, though it is worth trying. There are better interpretation of this style available."
""
"D/O: This American-brewed lager represents an unusual style for a domestic beer, but it fails to distinguish itself as such. Malt seems not so much like an apology as just a fumble, unremarkably executed. This could be a Dortmunder, or five other Euro-style lagers; without a more accomplished malt expression, it is destined to bounce around splitting time between categories. In the final tally, it's a difficult beer to get very excited about."
"Overall: Very drinkable brew would be great hanging on the porch on a warm may evening. I would drink this in the summer time if they offered it."
"Pours a golden yellow color with a half finger head which recedes to nothing. There is also litle to no lace. The aroma is of cereal malts and a hint of floral. The taste has a bready malt backbone with a slight taste of citrus and a slight sweetness to it. There is a lager yeast taste in the middle as well. The mouthfeel is crisp and clean with moderate carbonation. Overall this is a good beer, it is very true to the style and is an easy drink."
""
""
"Pours dark golden with a two-finger length white head that retains well. There are plenty of bubbles coming up the glass. Shiner is labeling this as an ale in the Dortmunder-style. The smell of malts and hops dominates. Flavors of slightly sweet malt are up front and followed by some hop bitterness to balance it out. It's light to medium bodied with plenty of carbonation. It's clean and crisp and the flavors make this very easy to drink. One could easily session this. Overall, I believe Shiner has a success here with this Dortmunder-style ale. It's not spectacular, but it's good. It has enough drinkability to make this sessionable and one could enjoy this on a warm spring day."
""
"Overall: I feel like this beer is missing something in the flavor department, but otherwise it's a very refreshing and drinkable beer. Not bad."
""
"This isn't a bad beer. It's drinkable and refreshing, but it's not incredibly flavorful and a bit too sweet. I'll probably pass in the future."
"It wasn't bad but it reminded me of an american macro brew. Yeah, it was a beer but mostly just ... there and ultimately forgettable. It may just be that this isn't my style of beer."
""
""
"Pretty good."
"Overall an easy drinking, nicely balanced, great session beer."
""
""
"I wasn't expecting much so maybe that is why this seems decent enough to me. Grainy malt profile...Grassy hop feel....a little honeyish sweetness...clean bodied...drinks nice....GL Dort Gold this is not but it sure isn't bad either.. Not a lot of beers of this style around which makes this a good find and a decent price...one of Shiner's better efforts."
"Maybe the twist top makes it easy access for yard work"
"O: This is a very nice ale, but if I look at it from the point of view of a Dortmunder, it comes up short. It has a very rich palate of ale esters that make it very drinkable. Just don't call it a Dortmunder, please."
"A forgettable entry, but I will not argue the merits it may have paired with the family lawn mower."
"The flavor is herbal and grassy with a grainy malt base. The beer is medium bodied but finishes spicy, crisp, light and semi-dry. It goes down very easy and smooth. An excellent, refreshing, beer."
"Overall Impression- For my first time enjoying this style with an American Brewery, a great brew from Shiner (Spoetzl). Well balanced and had nice body that kept this beer in my glass for a longer amount of time than other lagers would. Would definitely recommend trying this style if you haven't before and if you find it in Austria/Germany, enjoy many!"
""
""
"O- Good drinkable beer. Made me wish I had more than the single gifted to me."
"This beer is one more in a line of pretty good Shiner seasonals. Thanks Kosmos!"
""
""
"Into a pint glass, brew pours a clear pale yellow golden with a nice display of bubbles under a consistent white cap. A zesty and crisp mild malt aroma of lemongrass fills the nose. Mouthfeel is crisp and refreshing with a solid floral and mildly pungent hop character that's balanced out nicely by a bright bready malt flavor and honey like sweetness. Flavorful and quenching brew for the Spring."
""
"O: I am not very fond of this beer, like most of the boring Shiner beers. It is decent, but not worth the money I spent on it. Just a pretty boring beer to me."
"Served from bottle into a shaker. Poured yellow-orange with a minimal white head. Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, nutty, wheat, and grain. The flavor was of sweet malt, wheat, nutty, grain, and fruit. It had a light feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was an average brew. The aroma on this one was unfortunately a little lackluster in my personal opinion. However, the flavor was not too bad and was quite refreshing. I could probably drink this one again if given to me, but doubt I could see myself going out and buying a 6-pack on my own."
""
""
"Half finger head with little retention and no lacing on a clear golden body. Aroma is a little light with mostly breads and malt. More of the same in the finish with a mild bitter hop finish. Light body And moderate to high carbonation. Overall somewhat refreshing. I have only had one or two from this genre so it's hard to accurately judge."
""
""
"I haven't tried any other spring beers. This one is passable for something I'd bring to a party, though."
""

"It's somewhat like shiner bock in a lot of ways. Pretty good stuff. Within the style guidelines it's definitely good."
""
""
""
"Atmosphere is pretty solid. Substantial, frothy head, collapses under its own weight; heavy carbonation, but no real lacing. Nose is subtle, but balanced. Flavor follows suit in its subtlety, but does add a little hop and tang for character. Overall, this is a pretty good quaff."
"Mouthfeel is appropriately light with just a light crispness to it moving into a smooth feel."
"Smells of yeast, hop, and citrus. It tasted of a hefeweizen with a citrus body with a slight spicy bitter hop finish. The mouthfeel was medium body, slightly refreshing. Overall was an okay dortmunder compare to some of the german ones I had. I might taste it again next year."
"O: overall a classic style and ahold representation of it."
" The flavor has a little to much slickness to start with some toasted malt and husky grainy flavors which seem to give the impression of adjuncts with not much depth of malt. The vegetal elements and slight sweet middle w/ hops that relax pretty soon after the initial taste. From midpoint on the flavor becomes more grainy and hints of metallic vegetal become more noticeable with a sweet finish. Overall I was dissapointed in this since I am a fan of the dortmunder style and wish more American brewers had one in the portfolio, but this is lackluster at best and one I will not purchase again."
"Overall - nice and refreshing taste, although not terribly interesting in its taste span."
"RJT"
"O - overall, a very nice beer. My first foray into this specific style, and I really enjoyed. In comparison to other lager offerings, the flavor profile seems relatively complex. However, that's not to say that this is a great ""hot day"" type beer. I bought this as part of mixed sixer, but I might have to get a sixer of just this now."
"O: Overall a pretty good beer. Without a doubt worth a try."
"Very drinkable tasted great on an 80 degree day after mowing"
"Overall : Surprising experience. Wouldn't be a first choice to recommend to friends but would drink it if I was invited to one."
"Pours a medium pale gold, with a nice big head, that settles down to a quarter inch layer of foam leaving a nice amount of lacing behind. Aroma is pleasan\t, but lacks both strong hops and malt character. Taste is a bit too understated, though does have some enjoyable hops notes, but no real malt backbone to be found. Mouthfeel is very smooth, but a little too thin for my liking. Overall, not a bad beer at all, especially considering the price point. I would not however call this a standout example of the style."
"pours a slightly cloudy straw color with little head and no lacing. picked up some malts, grass, bread, a little spice on the nose. taste was like the smell, not too complicated, just simple beer. mouthfeel is light and crisp, slightly carbonated and a little dry on the finish. overall a good beer on a hot day. will definatly drink again."
"Really like this beer. It has been a decade since having DAB's lager, and this reminded me of it right away. Pours a honey-golden hue with white head. Nose is clean, with some soft earthy grains and light herbal note. Palate offers a bit of malt sweetness, some cereal, and certainly minerally flavors that flow into some hop herbal qualities. Finish leaves me with that mineral taste, light sweetness, and is very drinkable."
"Poured from a bottle into a tall pilsner. Good head that dissipates quickly but good lacing throughout the glass. At first, taste had a nice, malty breadiness with an almost cloying sweet finish but little flavor from the hops. Almost like a Shiner Bock. But as I enjoyed this while playing some serious Black Ops, the beer had time to warm by perhaps 10*F which improved the taste drastically. The whole body became noticeably fuller and more of the hoppy flavor came through. A great spring beer from Shiner and definitely better than that grapefruit, ginger, dark and stormy alcopop they called a beer that came out this Summer."
"Overall - A nice sweet and easy to drink beer. Fine cold drink for a hot day. Nothing new or spectacular for the style, just a soild beer and east to enjoy"
"Dr. Dang, it's half gone just figuring out the smells and flavors. Easy drinking."
"pours out a clear dark gold. minimal head and lace. grassy, grainy aroma...touches of honey, herbs and sugar. flavour follows suit with malty breadiness punctuated with some herbal grassiness. a bit of adjunct comes through but not in a bad way. lager like mouthfeel in a medium body. relatively simple but tasty enough to be consumable, especially on a hot day. overall not bad, about run of the mill for a Shiner product and their take on styles. a fair beer for a fair price."
"I'm a Texan, so take this review with a grain of salt. But compared to Blue Moon Spring Blonde Wheat, and some others. This is more beer, and not so much sugar coated beer."
"Malty and bready are the dominant smells in this palette. I can smell a faint hint of sweet, earthy tones. The taste has a nice spice to it with a malty/dry finish. There is a slight sweetness that I quite enjoy. It is not a very complex, but it is crisp, clean, and refreshing. It is worth checking out on a nice spring day."
"Shiner Dortmunder Style Spring Ale does not put a scare into the very best versions of the style (Great Lakes Dortmunder Gold is at the pinnacle). Having said that, it's a tasty little lager that has some character and that should be mucho enjoyable alongside most foods. Year-round would be the better way to go."
"Overall: A pretty well rounded lager here, a good choice for warming weather conditions;."
"D: Very drinkable as it is a lighter beer but it is definitely not the best example of the style."
"Overall not the greatest beer. I'll take Great Lakes Dortmunder over this all day every day. A bit of a metallic taste and isn't as clean and crisp as I'd like. I love well crafted lagers but this one falls short, that being said it is drinkable at least."
"O: Good representation of an easy-drinking lager beer that has some character."
"O: This is not a complex beer, but it is not a bad beer. I was searching for better than average easy drinking beer, and this dortmunder does offer that. However, it also does not do anything to distinguish itself in an already crowded market."
"Very drinkable. I'd say 'as advertised' a spring ale. I bought a six pack that I will enjoy on warm spring days."
"This is a nice beer. It's light, yet complex and very much a step above most of the Shiner beers I've had."
"Ale? Doesn't matter as long as the brewer hits the mark, right? Bright and clear and golden. Quite a spicy nose, but light on the malt. Lager-like smoothness and crispness take the palate for a ride. Thick herbal flavor pushes hard against a dried grassy maltiness. That soon leads to a spicy dry finish. This beer gets right to the point; complex it is not, but it makes up for that with a clean drive to be as drinkable as possible. We were too impressed with that drinkability to really start nitpicking the style--a refreshing Spring Ale it will be."
"A medium amount of carbonation and a light body make up the feel of this beer. Aftertaste is well balanced; I couldn't say it was bitter or sweet. Overall a good, refreshing beer to reach for in the spring or summer."
"Pours very pale with a quickly dissipating head. Smells faintly of grain and honey, which immediately got my attention. I like a nice crisp beery with a bit of honey and grainyness to it and this fit the bill perfectly. This is really refreshing. You can taste the grain and honey and other than it being a bit over carbonated for my taste, this is a great brew. I bet I would love this on a hot summer day after doing some yard work."
"Poured a light yellow with a centimeter head that remained for a surprisingly long time. The beer flavour was imparted mostly by the hops, but it wasn't over-powering. It had a very slight pine, but mostly citrusy taste. It even seemed to have a tiny apricot note to it. It wasn't particularly bitter. It was too much hop flavour for me since I'm not a fan of hops, but even so it was all right. I didn't get any biscuity malt flavour that's supposed to be an element of this style, so perhaps the citrusy hop flavour was stronger than it should have been."
"Overall, an excellent beer. I will absolutely buy more of this. Good Job, Shiner."
"O- One of Shiner/Spoetzl's better products I've come across. Is it boundry pushing? No. Is it particularly unique? Not really. But it's a pretty good example of an underappreciated style. Easy drinking, and I gotta say, in my humble opinion, Shiner would do well adding this to their year round lineup, even if it meant dropping one of their current year rounds."
"Mouthfeel is very clean and goes down very quickly. There is a little more weight than a typical lawnmower beer. This is would be a great Spring Cleaning beer. I could definitely knock a few of these back after cleaning out the garage."
"Would not be my first choice but is certainly not a bad beer."
"The drawback to all of that is that although it may be a very good beer, and really quite balanced and drinkable, it lacks a bit of complexity, and it doesn't raise any eyebrows - and in our current beer climate, that's unfortunately what's necessary to get attention and keep sales going. Even in Germany, the Dortmunder or ""export"" style is dying out. It just falls too readily between the Munich Helles and southern Pils styles. Overall, however, it's a great style that should really be appreciated more, and thankfully Shiner has put out a really good version of it!"
"Not the best brew I have had in the style, but certianly a nice brew none the less. Its a nice summer/spring time kind of brew. I enjoyed its and could certianly session this brew without a problem. Good brew, I will have to try a few others from this brewery as well"
"Dortmunder style spring ale, did somebody just make up a style? Anyways I'm guessing this is basically an export style lager brewed with an ale yeast to turn it out quicker and not hold up any tank space. Pours brilliant golden crystal clear completely filtered with a bright white foamy head that sticks arounds and coats the glass at the same time. Aroma has pale malts a bit of biscuit/bread dough baking complemented by an assertive herbal/citrus/grassy hop character. Flavor wise it has a honey drizzled biscuit like malt profile with just enough hops to keep it from being cloying sweet, the herbal/citrus/hay like hops dry out the sweet bread malt base so that things just seem to work. Even a bit of mineral water/metallic edge that doesn't offend me or take away from the drinking experience. Mouthfeel is medium to light bodied with a crisp smooth natural feeling carbonation level. Overall a nice drinking spring/summer beer that will wow your bud/miller/coors friends. The uber beer geek will say this tastes like elephant piss, but I think it's awesome great spin on a classic German style."
"I absolutely loved this beer. It lives up to every superlative on the label. I could drink bottle after bottle and not get sick of it. This will be great for summer and I plan on stocking up."
"Overall: Not a great beer, but a solid effort nonetheless. A good beer for the spring and a nice refresher. Interesting, though, that Shiner's winter seasonal as is its new spring brew are both Dortmunders..."
"O- A good beer for drinking in front of the tube, and the honey taste does lead my mind to spring. So I'll take it."
"Its a descent spring brew. Has some flavor and is refreshing. I like the hop character."
"Taste-grain, faint honey bread, buttered saltine cracker. Very easygoing, clean and quaffable. A nice springtime session brew."
"Good flavor following the aroma. Solid lager flavor that is definitely enhanced by the citrus. Some notice of malty grain as well. Overall, this beer drinks easily and is very crisp and tasty. Good spring and summer choice."
"Disappointing taste. Like an American adjunct/light lager, with no snappiness or crispness. Maybe my bottle was bad? Absolutely nothing special."
"D - Definitely made for mass consumption, have at the sixer over a Spring Texas Fling."
"D - This has it where it counts, and it's definitely one of the better Shiner brews exhibiting both a good grasp of the style as well as lager brewing (despite being labeled an Ale - thanks Texas. Maybe you'll get it one day). Nice drinkability for this crisp beer, it's just the thing to get me in the mood for spring."
"This is another special beer from Shiner that doesn't impress. It's not bad but it's nothing I'd want to purposefully drink again."
"D: After I agitated the beer when I was half a glass down to release some of the carbonation the beer went down really smooth. Over all a good lager if the carbonation was reduced by about 1 volume?"
"D - Very tasty, and I really like the 5.5% ABV. Could drink these all night."
"Drinkability isn't bad as well, better with less carbo. I deem it worthy to pick up from time to time."
"D -- Very nice quaffer here, has that perfect balance between a Helles and Pils in malt and hop character. Another very nice rendition from Shiner -- now, can we talk about that Bock?"
"Thanks Dave."
"Not an exciting beer. But that's partly because the style is pretty unexciting; this example does hit the ""Dortmunder/export"" style square on."
"D - This was an okay beer. There are better Dortmunders out there."
"Pours a clear golden body with one finger a bright white foam. Aromas are disappointingly subdued, mostly grainy with a bit of honeylike sweetness. Flavors are good but uninteresting, which is hardly a knock because the same could be said of almost every other Dortmunder I've tried. With an extremely low hoppiness, the flavors are dominated by unremarkable malts. Not bad, but joins the other members of its style in lacking character."
"A bubbly and effervescent beer with a clear orangish gold hue. A moderate pour produced two fingers of head which quickly subsided. Smells of biscuity malt a touch of hops and a hint of adjuncts. I think I smell corn. Fairly unimpressive taste, malt was lack luster and thin, hops made no appearance, and adjuncts definitely come through. On the bright side served cold it is light and refreshing and absolutely a step above BMC but IMO not much more than average American lager. Mouthfeel is heavy which is unusual considering this is a light beer and there is an odd metallic finish. I also expected more carbonation. On the whole pretty average if it was a dollar cheap for a sixer I'd say go for it but at $7.75 you're not missing anything."
"The mouthfeel was medium to light and had a lively carbonation. Easy to drink."
"Overall: Too weak for my palet but not a bad brew. Seemed a bit watery if you ask me"
"I'm curious as to whether or not this is just Shiner Fröst relabeled.  This Dortmunder is grassy and sweet.  The mouth-feel is medium with medium carbonation.  I wish I had some Shiner Fröst here to compare it to, but, I don't. Im at my favoritve bar and they are corrently out of it. If this is indeed the same beer as Shiner Fröst, I must say, I don't like it as much.  Shiner Spring Ale Dortmunder seems to have some adjunct-y flavor that comes through, especially towards the end of each sip.  It also seems sweeter than I remember Shiner Fröst being, but perhaps my palate has changed, or this particular pint is not up to snuff.  The Adjunct-i-ness is the most disturbing part for me as it adds a dirtiness to the flavor of this beer that I do not appreciate. That being said everyone is different and if your a shiner man you sholuld try it."
"Pours a clear, gold color. 1/4 inch head of an off-white color. Decent retention and slight lacing. Smells of sweet malt, slight pale malt, hint of grain, citrus hops, and slight yeast. Fits the style of a Dortmunder / Export Lager. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of sweet malt, pale malt, yeast, slight citrus hops, hint of caramel malt, and a hint of grain. Overall, good aroma, body, and blend. A refreshing quality without being too heavy."
"A Dortmunder style ale?Thats different.Poured two bottles into a 1/2 liter stein,a nice brilliant golden with a fluffy one finger white crown atop that left a frothy ring of lace as it settled.Aromas were pretty light just some toastd grain and mineral,not much hop presence wich would have been nice.Toasty flavors at the onset with light honey-like sweetness,a German malt driven iron quality underneath,a decent lemony hop flavor comes in the finish.Not a bad beer at all,I could see drinking this grilling this spring without any problem at all."
"This is alright for drinkability I'd say I could have this again, I can't say I am desiring it or very fond but it will do in a pinch. I can't unfortunately compare it to others in this style as either better or worse since this is my first one, so I am trying not to be too middle of the road here. But I'd drink another for sure no problem."
"The beer pours a solid gold color with very active carbonation, and very good head retention and lacing. The nose is not quite as impressive, as I get some light honey, a hint of underlying oranger citrus bitterness, and not much else. The flavor profile replicates the nose in this lightly sweet lager, with a slightly bitter finish. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, with a fairly long, almost slick finish. Considering the fairly low alcohol, this beer delivers an impressive amount of flavor. Drinkabilty is pretty good in this fairly low alcohol beer, though I wish there were a bit more to it. Still, this is an easy to enjoy, easy to appreciate lager from the folks at Shiner."
"taste a tad bit of lemon with some grassy notes"
"I think sthis is one of the best beers I have had from Shiner. I look forward to more of their offerings."
"Drinkability: you can knock back a few of these without any problems, but the fact remains you have to desire to knock them back, and really, I'm lacking that desire at the moment. I'd definitely be more interested in it during the summer months though."
"Not bad, but not great. Pretty one-note, but maybe that's all you want in a light spring seasonal. I only bought a single of this though, and I can't really imagine buying any more. Decent but forgettable."
"Drinkability- could easily drink more than one of these but I am not sure I would want to."
"Opinion: Well, overall this is a pretty decent beer. It has a pretty good mix of malt and hops which is essential for this style and I would actually say that it is pretty close to what the guys over the water are doing. It could use a different balance to the water as this is currently too clean. Either way, it is a pretty good beer and I will enjoy this glass to the end. I'd give it a try if I were you and it was convenient...but I wouldn't drive 100 miles into Texas for it or anything."
"Poured a bomber in anticipation of last year's funness, but nyet. Weird, and I mean WEIRD, aroma and taste that I gotta think was not supposed to be there. Smelled like wet cardboard and burning plastic. Basically it was like I left my GI Joe (in its original cardboard, '70s box - PRICELESS HEIRLOOM!) out in the rain and then it caught on fire. That's what it smelled and tasted like."
"D - Drinkability is good. I could see myself putting a few of these back during the warmer spring/summer months. A very ""sessionable"" brew."
"Bought a six pack of this and it was ""ok"" to say the least. I was not too impressed and I would not buy again. Poured a clear orange/yellow. Little hop presence, more malt. Don't prefer this over the regular shiner. Carbonation is average and the taste is not anything to die for."
"The brilliant bright white head on this beer is stunning. This was my first time to try this beer and I am pretty sure I like it better than Shiner Bock."
"Pours clear copper brown in color, with a white foamy head. Has decent retention. There is a little lacing as well. Smell is mostly of bread and grain malts maybe a little toffee, although there is a nice clean lemon hops presents in the background. Not too complex on the nose. Taste is malty and biscuity with a nice lemon bite to it. Pretty much like the nose although the bread characters are more pronounced. Finishes clean with just a little lemony aftertaste. Very good carbonation. Light to medium body with good bubbly carbonation. Very refreshing a crisp mouth feel. Although very simple it is very good. Seeing is that this is in season and very well priced, I will be picking up more of this beer."
"FourthBeer potential: ABOVE AVERAGE. A solid effort by Spoetzl. A few of these would be quite refreshing after a round of golf."
"D: I really can't compare this to beers of the Dortmunder style as my only other sampling is Dog Days and that was probably three years ago. As far as I am concerned this is an average Spring release from the boys at Spoetzl, meaning this is something you can grab a case of, throw it on the boat, and enjoy the day out on the water. Too bad it isn't in cans, that way I could take it with me Toobin' on the Guadalupe."
"D- The lower ABV on this beer makes it a good multi-drinker. The flavors are a little off but it doesn't make it a bad beer. Nothing too terrible and I would love to have another one if given the chance."
"Drinks really easy, not a world beater here, but one would happily sip on while watching sports on TV or having pizza. There's a few from Shiner I can't stand, but this one is pretty tasty"
"drinkability is very good - this might be best shiner beer i have had to date"
"Very lively beer pours a rich honey color with a very bubbly, loose head. Good looking beer. Sweet honey malts and piney hops in the nose. Light pear wisps and some spice, too. Pale malts with more piney hops varieties. A little harsh on the palette, spicy bubbles and a good hops bitterness gives it a slightly raw character. Definite honey tastes. Not bad."
"Poured into a nonic English pub pint glass, a nice golden color. White head that dissipates to minimal lacing. Smells of floral hops and a whiff of sweetness from the malts. Taste up front is grain followed by light malt sweetness finishing with light floral hops. Carbonation is perfect, flows down the throat with great ease, I could have a few of these and I wouldn't mind."
"Drinkability - Easy to drink, refreshing, never loses it's appeal."
"I could do with drinking this no problem."
