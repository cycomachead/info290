"Poured from a green 12 oz. bottle. Has a light golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of grains, malts. Taste is crisp, malts, grains, a bit on the sweet side, very easy drinking. Feels light in the mouth and overall is a decent beer."
"Easy drinking lager similar to a Michelob."

"Remarks: Gift from a friend of my wife; pretty pleased overall"

"Overall: this beer seems to be pretty strongly underrated in my opinion -- it's definitely no gag-inducing adjunct lager. That said, it's a somewhat bland but serviceable beer; it's not really crisp enough to be a Pilsner nor rich enough to be a Dortmunder, but it's refreshing enough for me."

"Pours a clear yellow with a frothy head. Nose is grainy, cereal malts without much hop presence. Taste starts off with sweeter malts, which turn more to a softer cereal malts; not much else complexity on the palate. Mouth is full and has nice carbonation. Overall, kind of what I expected - light, crisp, and refreshing."

"Clear pale yellow, white head with good retention and lacing. Nose is doughy, crackery, spicey hops and a bit of urine. Taste is doughy, grainy, old fruit, socks and some malt sweetness. Low carbonation, light palate and mild bitterness. Not at all tasty, pass."
"Thanks Josh for doing a fairly fresh bottle. I could do this at the end of a hot day."

"O- Out of all 4 of this brewerys' products, this one is probably the best in terms of flavor, fullness, aroma, and most definitely looks. Still not one of the better beers out there, it serves it's purpose and if I had to drink this one again, I wouldn't complain...I probably woundn't seek this one out again though, unless on vacation in the Honduras! Average at best, I've definitely had worse!"

"O: This was the best of the three I tried because it had something unique about it."

"This one is all about cold moderately alcoholic refreshment on the beach after a long day in the sun. If you're looking for a better beer experience in Honduras try a Pina Colada cuz you probably ain't gonna find it."
"Carbonation was at a nice level."
"Therefore a good beer for a hot country like Honduras."
"The beer was a pale straw color with lots of bubbles rising and a thick, white, mattress-like head that grew into a snow cone shape above the rim of my glass and just stayed there. It smells of grassy, lemon hops and adjuncts. The taste is mostly bready malt with some lemon and hay. There some musty flavors and it's pretty macro-ish. It feels pretty light with some stinging carbonation and the finish is very dry. This beer is ok at best."
"D: amazingly easy to drink; could toss them back all day"
"I'd call this a completely decent beach beer. There was a fair share of DMS and the aroma reminds me of corn casserole. The flavor is a basic, but fairly clean, crisp bready malt character that drops the mild spiced corn aroma. Yes, the label says ""Export"" but this just tastes like your basic pale Euro lager with a hint of fruit that most American lagers lack."
"D - Overall this really isn't a bad beer sure its not really exciting but its a good easy to drink lager that I could drink a few of in a sitting hey its worth a shot"
"RJT"
"Dortmunder? Tastes more like an Adjunct lager to me. I would be shocked if this was all malted barley. Cereal grains are very sweet and not balanced at all by even a mere hint of hops. Mouthfeel approaches cloying, just too sweet. Does not taste as bad as it smells, but bad enough to contemplate drain pourage."
"Edited after drinking again. The old ""drinkability"" score had to be adjusted now that it's the ""overall"" score."
"port royal export green glass bottlePOured with a light white head and some lace. Color is a clear pale yellow. aroma is a bit skunky + world common corn/rice beer. Flavor is exactly like aroma. Body is like and in context with the above characteristics - in other words, not that great. Finish is like flavor and can serve the purpose of the moment, but in the longer term, best forgotten. Except to remind yourself to try and get something better."
"My dad (a German Brewmeister) came up with this beer and even though it is not a A Class beer, it is smooth and a bit stronger hopsy malt flavour compared to other Honduran and Central American beers out there. It certainly deserves more credit than given in the reviews."
"Finally, an import from Central America that isn't an American Adjunct Lager. ...At least not officially. This thing pours like a lighter version of the store-brand vegetable oil in my kitchen. Come on, Honduras, don't do this to me, the ol' Bait 'n' Switch. Dirty pool, Honduras. The nose better eat its spinach, 'cause it's pretty damn weak right now: only some vague corn syrup and rice notes waft through the thick haze that is the air. The taste comes pretty close to approximating this, but with less sweetness than would normally be expected. The rice fights its way through from the back of the bus. Damn bullies... Once again, I would recommend this brew eat its spinach, or anything for that matter, as the body is so very thin, finishing with an unsurprisingly dry effect. Honestly, I'm not sure how they get away with calling this thing a 'Munder. For that style, this is piss-poor. As an AAL, though, it's par for the course--though anybody can shoot par at that crappy old putt-putt down the road. You know the one."
"The beer pours macro yellow with a white head. The aroma is corny macro. The flavor is more of the same with corn, rice and some malt sweetness. Just your basic adjunct flavor here. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"Bone white head of noticeably delicate foam, dimples like it was bubble bath bubbles, crests at close to fingers than dissolves down, thin but persistent streaks of lacing. Pale yellow straw color, clear, not sufficient hue depth to notice much change at the rims, haphazard large bubbles launch upwards with good speed. The nose is simple but clean, sweet cornmeal and cereals, more honey than sugar, apricot pits, white grapes, no bitter residue, marked more by the absence of negatives than presence of positives. In the mouth it's light-bodied and almost evanescent, the carbonated swirl enhances palate presence. Same general appeal as in the nose, grains, cornbread, molasses, light white fruit, creamy enough with a hint of malts, just not a lot of length. Easy to drink and doesn't piss you off, two fairly big compliments for beers of this sort."
"12oz bottle. Pours clear yellow/green with a surprisingly ample, fizzy white head. Smells of typical macro lager adjuncts, though with a slightly malty kick to it that makes it a bit more pleasant on the nose. Very similar taste--like any other nasty adjunct lager, but somewhat more substantial. Light body. As bad as this is, it's quantifiably better than BMC stuff, at the least."
"Rather bland, but a mainly inoffensive brew that I could drink plenty of to quench a thirst, especially on a hot day."
"Noted as a crisp and refreshing premium Pilsner on can."
"i don't get all the negative reviews. yes, this beer is brewed in honduras. yes it has a clean, crisp taste to it. yes it is a pilsener. you don't expect complexity or anything extra special from it. but it does deliver on the style. and for a pilsener style lager its right in line with urquell or warsteiner. i found it better tasting than warsteiner in fact. do a blind taste test of a couple and leave preconceptions behind. you will be surprised. it has the light hoppy smell, but nothing much else. taste is a little hoppy up front then very clean and and a bit dry on the finish. a little malty and grainy tasting. is thin to medium bodied, which is right for the style. drinkability is through the roof. exactly what you want in a pils. a good beer, though not outstanding."
"On a side note. I learned that some rich guy went over to Roatan and actually built a brewery. He planned to brew beer for the island, and I believe tried to, but was quickly run out of the business by the big wigs. I guess they went to all the businesses on the island and paid them NOT to sell his beer and continue to sell these 4 as the only local beers on the island. He tried to sell the brewery but was unsuccessful and he now makes soda with the equipment."
"When out snorkeling or scuba diving, you'll want to stock your boat with Port Royal for the return trip. This beer blends well with the salty brine that has infiltrated your mouth and sinuses. The salt brings forth the crisp yet nutty characteristics that may be lost on an un-marinated tongue. The rejuvenating characteristics of a cold Port Royal feel great to a body that has been pickling in the briny deep all day."
"Out of the 3 beers available in the Bay Islands this one was by far the worst. Grainy, corn, taste that was very hard to choke down along with a little skunk flavor. One of these was enough for me, if you have to choose go with Salva Vida for a beer in Honduras"
"The aroma is not good but unique for me since its the first beer that has ever smell like personal lubricant. On top of that you have a touch of grass hops but mostly corn like malt. The appearance is pale gold with a nice head that lasts. The flavor is like the aroma, yeah. The palate is thin but ok for the style. Overall its pretty bad and pretty strange."
"Port Royal Export pours a pale yellow with a white head from a green twelve ounce bottle. The aroma is grainy. There isn't a lot of flavor, a bit grainy and a bit of sweet malt. Not much to it, not very good, you'd be better off looking elsewhere. i'd pass."
"Overall: When a beer's appearance is it's strongest point, not a good sign. But it's more drinkable than some other down-south brews."
"Tastier than other Central American beers and my favorite so far. It held up better against the other Honduras beers, which weren't bad either (though a bit bland). It's not my favorite style, but it is a good Pilsener and the tastiest Central American beer I've come across."
"I tried 4 beers on my day in Honduras, and this was probably the best one. It actually tasted like a beer and not a corny vegetable soup! Not much hops, not much aroma, but a decent smooth barleyish taste that was a welsome change from my other experiences. Having said that, it was nothing special. Don't take a trip to Honduras just for the beer."
"This was sampled in a hotel restaurant in Honduras after having toured the Copan ruins and had little to choose from. Glad to have tried it and found quite acceptable for the middle of Central America."
"Overall, a below average beer, but I wouldn't mind trying it in a bottle just to see if there's much difference in the metallic flavor."
"It is actually very malty when compared to other beers from this region. Very smooth. Quite possibly what Coors could taste like if better ingredients were used in the brewing process. Very light and easy drinking. Second bottle: I take back the good things that I said before. Obvious quality problems."
