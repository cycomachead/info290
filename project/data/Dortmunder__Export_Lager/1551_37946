Smell is of malt, grain, and some fruity aromas. Taste is much the same with a grassy flavor on the finish. There is a mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is an above average beer that is drinkable but nothing I would go after again.","UCLABrewN84","Feb 12, 2013"

3.2,0,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,3,"o - Overall a pretty average lager. Lots of that grain and corn in the nose and taste. Not bad at all, but pretty average. Would suggest trying one of their other beers.","mdfb79","Sep 25, 2011"
3.68,15,3.5,3,4,3.5,4,"Initial mpression is a cross between unmalted and malted pale grains. Relatively thin, but the aftertaste has a touch of bitterness that brings some good balance.

3.51,9.7,4,3,3.5,3.5,4,"Had the Golden Export at the G & B in Bolingbrook, IL last evening. The color was a clear yellow with white head that laced slightly. The aroma was common of dortmunder grain, Saaz hops, etc. The first taste was overpowering with grain and was a bit rough, but the following drinks were more smooth. The grain and malt was balanced with hops and the beer came off the pallet clean. Overall not to bad...the mouthfeel was smooth and easy. good session beer.","WoodBrew","Aug 07, 2011"
2.38,-25.6,2.5,2,2.5,2.5,2.5,"Poured a golden-yellow with a small fizzy white head that fizzled out rather quickly. Grainy aroma, with a light citrusy hop profile. Simple taste, nothing too interesting happening. Lightly toasted grains and light citrus and piney hops, leaving a somewhat bitter aftertaste. Balanced, but just too light for me. Drinkable if you're playing it conservative.","Rifugium","Aug 01, 2011"
2.8,-12.5,3,3,2.5,3,3,"Aroma of noble hops w some malt. Golden straw color, very clear. Mild hop bitterness, with mellow malt. Overall, good session beer, but a bit thin for my pallet.

Not great but not bad either.","rjochman","Nov 13, 2010"
3.2,0,3,3,3.5,3,3,"Sampled at Gordon Biersch restaurant in Dallas, TX. Pours light-golden hue. Aroma is of hops and some biscuit malt. Body is medium, crisp. Piny hops and biscuit malt are balanced on the palate. Long, dry finish. On the whole, it is nice Helles lager.","mikeg67","Aug 12, 2010"

3.53,10.3,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"GE pours a very clear, lemon-like gold color with a white head. I could smell a bit of pils malt sweetness in the aroma. The flavor of the beer is balanced between equal parts pils malt and hop bitterness. The pils malt is just a little sweet yet balanced by a medium amount of hop bitterness that is very smooth and sticks around on the palate for a bit. Overall it is medium bodied, medium carbonated, and smooth & balanced.","Rootdog316","Feb 20, 2009"

Better when it was just below room temperature.Below average mouthfeel.","Sammy","May 14, 2008"
3.68,15,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"The first in the line from the 6x Sampler at the Rockville Restaurant. Obviously a very popular beer at GB, but (even by admission of the waiter who said it was popular and added, "it compares to your typical macro beer"). I wouldn't say it's that bad, but it's definitely the beer of choice for the "micro-uninitiated." Plain gold in the glass with soft cream-colored head. No lacing per se, but a nice malt in the nose, soft carbonation, and the taste is almost all malty slick--like butter. Enough hops bitterness to (barely) balance the malt, but definitely a macro-lover's beginning foray to the craft world. Went down well, but I was glad I started with it. The rest only got better.","tugdriver7","Beers"
2.73,-14.7,3.5,3,2.5,3,2.5,"D- This veer has a big crisp sulfury flavor with other flavors falling behind or are covered up. I don't hate this beer there is just little flavor character to review.","rhoadsrage","0"

3.17,-0.9,3,3.5,3,3.5,3,"A light, seethru golden body with minimal head that did stay with the beer and maintained some lacings. A crisp, earthy smell belied by some hop bitterness and some fruit notes. A watery, almost bland beer but there is a sharp hop bite and it does go down smooth. I guess this is there version of a light beer, and it is better than a Bud or Miller. That being said, I think this is the beer a non-beer drinker gets and if you like real beer you can skip this, trust me.","clayrock81","Jul 28, 2007"
2.89,-9.7,4,2.5,3,2.5,3,"Overall, somewhat refreshing. Not one I would search out. Just too light and lacking any character.","atigerlife","Jun 11, 2006"
3.83,19.7,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,"The export lager poured very clear, a light golden color, with persistant carbonation. Its initial head dispersed to a ring, leaving sudsy retention on the glass. Golden malts, light hops, and as it warmed, an aroma of wildflower honey. Nice. Tasted of floral hops, clean sweet malt, and a slight bitter yeast. Fairly crisp finish. Damned fine for the style, which admittedly is not my favorite.","jbsteiny","Jan 24, 2006"
3.6,12.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"Presented as a medium golden color beer with white puffy head. Smell is light with slight malt notes present. Taste is light and refreshing and unobtrusive. Finishes with a slight sweetness but not much else. Easy to drink, but nothing great. A step up from a macro.","tgbljb","Feb 20, 2005"
4.22,31.9,4,4.5,4,4,4.5,"Sampled at the Washington DC location 11.5 Plato, 5.0% ABV. Nice golden pour with a light head bright white in hue. Carbonation level medium and nice. Nose is clean, some hop, some malt, but clean and light. Sweet light malty flavor finishes with a very nice crisp aftertaste. This beer was very well made.","jimbotrost","Oct 19, 2004"

3.85,20.3,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"This is one of Gordon Biersch's better beers: a pleasant, medium-bodied brew that goes down easy, beer after beer. I've had it at the GB brewery restaurant and in bottles. It's often on sale at Trader Joe's (CA) for $4.99/sixpack, which is a bargain for an above-average beer. GB Golden Export isn't a great beer, but it's a good one: not at all bitter, perhaps even a bit on the sweet side. Not my favorite, but a contender at the right price!","DFN","Apr 30, 2004"

1.58,-50.6,2,1.5,1.5,1,2,"As I take my first smell, it flashes me back to my days of downing Milwaukee's Best Light after losing at beer-pong. I cant describe the smell very well other than it smelling like a cheap American Lager. The taste is more of the same. Nothing special. Starts like carbonated water and ends with a slight hop bitterness to remind you that you are drinking a beer. The mouthfeel is that of carbonated water. As for drinkability; I could drink it but, why would I want to?","crackerpooch","Mar 10, 2004"

The taste was a bit thin: light malt and a touch of bitter hops. The mouthfeel was smooth with medium-light body and moderate carbonation. Overall a bit thin. This was an OK beer, easy to drink, but rather light.","UncleJimbo","Feb 17, 2004"
3,-6.3,3,3,3,3,3,"The beer pours a typical lager/pils golden yellow, monstrous bright white head, frothy in texture and the lace a thin sheet to cover the glass. Nose is the archetypal sweet malt, crisp and clean with the start excessively sweet, fair malt presence, top thin as my patience after sitting in the airport for almost 8 hours. Finish brisk in its carbonation and the hops apropos to the style, quite dry aftertaste that lingers on to long.","Gusler","Feb 11, 2004"
3.73,16.6,3.5,3,4,4,4,"Overall, this was the best of the three G.B. brews I tried (the others being the Marzen and Blonde Bock).

3.85,20.3,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"This beer is very light, in color, aroma, and even taste. Its a blanched straw color with the slightest amount of head. There's very little detectable aroma, other than the slight hint of malt you'd expect from a light lager. The taste is somewhat surprising though. Its a very delicate but interesting beer in this regard. For such a clean taste, it really has many subtle flavors that really compliment each other, and make the beer quite enjoyable. It would be an excellent yard work beer. Quite a surprise.","freed","Apr 13, 2003"
3.2,0,3,3,3.5,3,3,"This beer is a bright golden yellow, clear, with a moderate head and very little lacing effect. The aroma is fairly light with a nice malt sense.

3.19,-0.3,4.5,3,3,3,3.5,"As usual, a very good-looking beer. Taste is simply malt and a slight sourness that seems common in Gordon Biersch beers. Not impressive but not bad. This beer goes really well with the pot stickers. Actually tastes better with them than without.","aracauna","0"
