"A standard (in the good way) German lager - you are immersed in everything (all four of them) that goes into making it. Pleasantly malty, though maybe lacking a bit overall in the crisp, biscuity department. At any rate, flavourful, simple, and pretty easy to put back, not to mention that the standard price (sub 4 bucks) for a German-made lager or weissbier applies here as well."
"No need to search for."
"I didn't know what to think when I picked this up at the store, but I like it quite a bit. It's not the best representation of the style, but the flavors are unique and it's a perfect beer for grilling out or chilling out on a summery day. Now if those days would only get here. I'll have to see if I can grab some more Urfass this summer."
"The drink is surprisingly substantial and on the full side of medium-bodied. Nicely carbonated with great drinkability."
"I would say this is a very drinkable brew, if you can get past the wierd metal taste."
"Very drinkable crisp, clean tasting beer. Could drink quite a few on a warm day in the yard or at a bbq. Nothing super, but a nice beer."
"Straw yellow color with tons of carbonation bubbles. The head has great retention. The aroma is classic German pilsner. Soft grains and spicy grass/hay like hop. The taste is classic as well. Spicy hops dominates the lager while a nice touch of grain and malt balance out the beer. Finishes clean and slightly spicy. I enjoyed this beer. One of the best pilsners I have had in a while."
"Pours a clear light golden with a thin white head that is well sustained,lightly skunked aroma from the green bottle but a light toastiness comes thru along with some fresh mowed grass (would love to smell fresh)a nice mix of toasted malt and hop.Taste has a sharp hoppy edge to it,a a lightly toasted malt backbone holds up well to the big dose of spicey/sharp hops,as like many German lagers there is also a faint note of iron coming thru.A well rounded German lager I wish I could try fresh even an older bottle shows some nice lager qualities."
"Overall an enjoyable pilsner. Certainly worth a try."
