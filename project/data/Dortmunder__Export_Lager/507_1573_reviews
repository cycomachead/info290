"A quite interesting beer. A lager with 7% alcohol and I do not even taste it (though it warms). Nice malty exeperience without beeing sweet. Guess this would be a great to balance spicy food."

"Overall, a nice experience, it was like I was drinking one of the Mei/Lente (spring) bocks but with the high alcohol not being so obviously present."

"This is a style that is lacking on the American beer landscape....and I doubt....nay,... challenge it to be done better!"
"Overall: Sweeter and stronger version of the German style"
"O: Nice one. Interesting, different, definitely worth trying!"
"A nice enough strong lager but it is too sweet and cloying for my tastes."
"Descent beer, according to style."
"A very nice drink and one I will look out for again. I have had beers from Dortmund but don't remember them being so interesting as this Dort is. Maybe they were Pilsners and not Dorts."
"Taste is very malty and bitter with a nice sizzle from the carbonation. The special malts give the beer a caramel and breadiness. Aftertaste is bitter and dry. Body is medium to thin and fits this beerstyle. Drinkability is high because of it's thin body and balance between malt and bitter."
"This is one of those beers made without many pretensions. I left this beer a bit too long in my fridge (BB MAR06) but having been kept cold the beer did not suffer. A beautifully dark orange beer with almost no head (very persistent layer though) it has an incredibly malty taste. Sweet. Taste follows smell closely. Very bitter, lingering aftertaste though. A nice beer."
"Drinkability is fairly high despite its relatively sweet taste."
"Rather dull yellowish-orange with an off-white frothy head that faded quickly. Rather sweet on the nose, not too strong, very pleasant. Very tangy, sweet, citrus, many different sensations and tastes. It was very unique, feel and taste, lingered for a while. The aftertaste faded into something spicy that I wouldn't have expected from the beer that I just swallowed. Hard to describe, never had anything else like it to compare."
"Gulpener Dort is a great lager. It is a definite must-try from Holland."
"As it sets in my glass, unambiguous copper color, and the head miniscule, the color an off white with the texture frothy and the resultant lace a filmy coating upon the glass. The aroma of sweet malted grains dominate, citrus crisp and clean, fresh and quite inviting as noses go, start is sweetly malt, the top slender in its feel to the palate. Finish has a distinct acidic bite, tart and tangy, hops are present but understated in their spiciness, very dry and lingering aftertaste, a quite quaffable brew."
