review_text
"Pours a clear deep gold bordering on pale amber producing a finger of frothy, off-white, shortlived head that leaves little lacing. Aroma is bready with some honey notes & a hint of biscuit, grassy & floral hops. Taste is biscuity & soda cracker malt with toasty hints, lemon, grassy hops, a dominating bitterness & a malty, mineral aftertaste. Mouthfeel is medium bodied & a little stiff, moderate-high carbonation, prickly & dry with an astringent aftertaste. Crisp & refreshing."

" Pairing this beer with some fresh Puget Sound Oysters made for an enjoyable experience. ( I read that this style of beer works well with shellfish and am happy to report this is true! )"

"A little slippery, nice foam, could drink lots.!"
"It looks and smells like a refreshing light beer. It tastes about how you would expect, with a light, very slightly hoppy taste. It is not overly strong, but a smooth beer. It has a good after taste."
""
"It's got a nice dark golden color, and it pours a decent head. You can see it bubbling up, and it's a got a great lager taste, not too strong, but definitely not too weak.  It's not a heavy beer.  It's light enough whereby two guys can make a pretty good dent in a 1/6 keg during a three and a half hour game."

"Good showing Delaware. I've tasted airplane peanuts more flavorful than this. It has a generally comparable color and smell. Taste and mouthfeel fail to exceed the expectations set by mainstream breweries, let alone craft shops. Not sure how mature Dominion brewery is, but they have potential (despite my opinion of this particular brew)."

"12 ounce bottle into lager glass, no bottle dating. Pours moderately hazy golden amber color with a 1-2 finger dense and rocky off-white head with fantastic retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of pear, apple, cracker, biscuit, light caramel, honey, floral, grass, herbal, light pepper, and yeast earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance of malt, hop, and yeast ester notes; with solid strength. Taste of pear, apple, cracker, biscuit, light caramel, honey, floral, grass, light pepper, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Light earthy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of light fruits, cracker, biscuit, honey, light caramel, floral, grass, herbal, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Nice balance and robustness of malt, hop, and yeast ester flavors; with a great malt/hop balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth, clean, and moderately crisp mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very good Dortmunder style. Good balance and robustness of flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A nicely enjoyable offering."

"Overall: very drinkable with a good flavor. I think it would be great on a hot day. It's a great take on export lager."
"Overall: as Dortmunders go, a solid offering--couples with chips well and yet could stand alone for a night of socializing as well...."
"O- I would recommend this beer to anyone who likes malty beers. Well Done!"

"But this one is fairly nice. The grass tones are a bit high and the carbonation could ease up on my tongue and mouth. But the flavor profile is consistent and hearty. I suppose that hearty aspect may be the pitfall for some, but I can appreciate it."

"A nice sample of the style - nothing overpowering at all, but a joy to drink. Very crisp, clean and refreshing. I'd destroy 3 or 4 of these easily after mowing the lawn."

"An above average lager but pretty boring."
"Pours a copper color with a quickly dissipating head. Some pretty good carbonation, lots of bubbles ascending in the glass... inviting. Faint biscuity aroma. Taste is light to medium bodied, taste is bready with a touch of hops. Nice clean finish, pretty good mouthfeel. A nice, easy drinking beer with no frills. Won't knock you over with anything unique, but a nice, simple, good beer fitting at the end of a hot day."

"Very drinkable, well suited for a refreshing cool one after a hot day."

"D: overall a nice drinking lager from O.D. flavor and aroma is pretty close to what i enjoy in a dortmund. worth grabbing a six pack if you feel like some good, light craft beer."
"O: a great lager, I will be planning on having a lot of this during the summer."
"A light dry caramel aftertaste, I would really like to try this with a food pairing that would bring out the best in each other, I think I would really enjoy this beer with a meal."
"Old Dominion has a nook in Terminal A of the Dulles Airport…..so I certainly had to take advantage! They had the Lager, Ale, Stout, and Pale Ale on tap. I started with the Lager…..It is clear with a nice copper color. Thin white head is present and seems to be lacing nicely. The aroma is mostly non-existent….meaning I do not smell much. The German Pilsner malt used to make the beer is prevalient….it starts the taste…in the middle there is a swath of malt, then it becomes bitter on the pallet after the swallow. The mouthfeel is fine and follows the line of Becks."
"D - Wow, if this is what a Dortmunder is, then sign me up. As a lager alone, this is one of the most complex yet quaffable ones I've ever encountered. Recommended."
"O: This is a classic Dortmunder and if you've never had one you must try it."
"D- An easy drinking lager that goes down quickly and was an inoffensive pairing with corned beef hash. I had another pint in the same sitting so that says something I think. If only they could have done something with that head..."
"The CPJ"
"Transparent and bright magnifying goldenrod in color with a fuzzy saliva spackle in the center and many rising bubbles in the body. Greasy potatoes chips register first and foremost via the nose, followed by paprika over wet rusty grass, spray starch laundry offshoots and musty corn husks. Bready herbal traits ring flavorfully alongside moderately crisp sourdough characteristics. Fresh Bavarian bakery traits with sweet grain characteristics. Musty bran with a mild sweetroll traits. Bitterness is up there with a clean, supportive dietary supplement. Fresh cracked biscuit with some sharp churned butter. Ample carbonation and everything levels out no matter which sip sequence is attended to, finishing with honey, vanilla flavored toasted chex and aged white pepper, ultimately contributing to a musty, biscuit styled backdrop. In other words, just okay.. :)"
"D - Not something I would buy but defiantly not something I would turn down if handed for free this beer is pretty much in the same boat as Boston lager. Hoppy, grainy, drinkable"
"D: Very drinkable, this is a great session beer that has great flavor and feel to it and a modest amount of alcohol."
"Pours a nice golden amber with a 1/2 inch white head. Very fizzy. The smell is of grain and some hops. The taste is very grainy, but also with some hops in the presence and noticable carmel malt. A little bit too watery for my liking. the mouthfeel is normal, and its pretty drinkable."
"Pours a clear golden color with some visible carbonation and a white head. The nose is slightly hoppy and floral with some grain. Taste brigs slight bitterness and some straw and grain. Feel is light and crisp leading to good drinkability."
"This is almost the last of the single new beers I brought home with me from NoVa. It pours a slightly hazed orange amber topped by only an intimation of white foam. The nose...is apparently missing. There's nothing there. I don't really know what to say here. The taste comprises caramel, lemon zest, coriander, flowers, lemongrass, and some light biscuits. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a fairly crisp finish. Overall, a decent brew, nothing close to special, but definitely drinkable."
"D: For the style, very nice. I see why it is ranked so high on BA in the Dortmunder/Export Lager category."
"Crisp and clean, a bit on the thin side for the style, but the malts had a nice lively character. A bit less depth than average, but certainly refreshing - perhaps offering not quite enough to be a session candidate. Credit given, however, for the lively and crisp nature."
"D. Not bad for a lager. A bit more flavor than most. Great for a hot day."
"Thanks to Mr Miller for this bottle."
"pours a deep straw with massive white head. settles with some light lacing. basic malty nose with hints of what seem to be rice, corn...nothing enormous. not bad. the taste is much bigger with no real sweetness (as i feared from the nose) but rather an upfront, dry light hop bitterness. refreshing. crisp mouthfeel keeps this drinkable. wish it had more of a finish. nothing too complex, but not simple and mundane as any typical macro."
"Don't get me wrong, this doesn't pack the flavor punch of an imperial stout or IIPA, but damn tasty for a lager. It is not commonly available in my area, but when I can, I would be proud to hoist an OD lager."
"This is a very solid lager. Pours a light copper color with a 1/2 inch, foamy head, leaving a fair amount of lacing on the glass. Robust and malty taste; slight, slight hint of fruit. Dry finish. Could easily have 2 or 3 of these in one sitting and feel very satisfied. Would go great with a burger, steak, or stew."
"A very drinkable a flavorful lager. It's well balanced between he grassy malt and bitter hop flavors. It might be one of the best lagers I have had."
"I poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a standard pint glass. The beer is a pale orange hue with a fluffy white head. The aroma is bready with a few herbal lemon notes. The flavor is bready and light with a clean crisp finish. The beer is well carbonated and easy on the palate."
"D: Very drinkable; good representation of the style."
"Drinkability: A decent lager. The fruity notes are very appealing. I definitely recommend this one. Old Dominion is, in my opinion, a very good and very underrated brewery. This is one of their best beers."
"This brew is very drinkable - my first of this style lager. Very nice and could drink all night."
"Poured from the tap to a light orange-yellow color with thin white head that dissipated quickly and left little lacing. Nose and taste were both dominated by grain, to the point that little else was noticed. The mouthfeel was medium bodied and slightly tingly, and the finish was short and dry. Not too much to this one."
"Drinkability is high. At first I thought it was very simple but more flavor came out as it warmed. A good lager. I want to try it again. My first ""dortmunder/export lager""."
"A fairly drinkable, crisp brew. Light bodied, but not light in flavor. Prickly carbonation."
"The aroma is like a sour mash made with corn and herbal hops. The appearance is cloudy gold with a small but nice head. The flavor is like the aroma but not quite as sour. The palate is smooth and the finish malty with pepper and citrus notes. Overall I like it but it has a strange pickle sourness to the aroma."
"This one suffers by being the final style in my ""Rack Pack."" Compared to the Ale or Pale Ale, this one is rather one-dimensional. Wan yellow in the glass, though the foam head was impressive. Thinner, clearer, and a bit sparkling, with a slight malty presence in the nose. Taste was interesting, but the interest didn't last. A nice malty ""beer"" flavor, balanced with a hops bitterness that began to overpower the flavor toward the end. Lost a few points on drinkability for that. Though I haven't seen it on tap lately, the Vienna Lager is a better lighter (color) beer than this one."
"D: A drinkable beer, but definitely odd in its own way. I don't think I've had a dortmunder like it."
"D- very easy to drink. i got a sixer from a friend who went on vacation and it left me wishing it was available in my area. nice and hoppy, this one is something you should check out if given the chance."
"Overall: served its purpose"
"The taste is not as great, but still good. It's light but flavourful with apples, bread dough (slightly yeasty), herbs, with more herbs and some lemon pulp in the finish. Fairly full-bodied yet crisp, it is very clean with light sweetness followed by light but dominant, lively bitterness and hop flavours, lasting through the finish. It soon becomes a little bland and dulled, but retains its basic, solid characteristics and is highly drinkable."
"Pours a very light gold in color with absolutely no head whatsoever. Smell is very vegetal and corn like. Really can't get past the smell of this beer. I've had other offerings from Dominion and they've been decent. Taste is vey lager like emphasing in corn. Plenty of carbonation and bad smell to go around. Not good."
"d - highly drinkable. i don't drink many lagers but this is one i'd go to again and would be a great gateway beer for people becoming interested in craft beer."
"Brewed on 5/27/08."
"D: Certainly very drinkable, a nice overall offering. A bit of complexity, and on the refreshing side."
"Pale yellow colored lager with rapidly fading head.Aroma is a lemony citrus smell.Taste is citrus with a metallic finish.This is a pretty boring bland beer.I probably would not recommend this even though it's not terrible.I personally will not seek out,one is enough thank you."
"Good middle of Saturday beer."
"10/24/2004. Not a bad beer at all although I'd say it's pretty much average across the board. Bright golden-yellow colored with a thin white head. Aroma is fruity, malty and a touch grassy. Taste is sweeter than a lot of lagers I've had. Pretty smooth and refreshing."
"Pours a pale golden color with a thin sudsy white head that fades to a wispy layer. Smells of toasty biscuity malt with a touch of clover and honey. Very flavorful, with a nice biscuity base, some sweetness on top, and a touch of nuttiness. Dry grassy flavor and a note of lemon zest add to the overall taste. Drinks nicely, with a lighter medium body and some good carbonation. Smooth with a slick coating on the finish. Goes down easy, with some great flavor."
"This beer was a delightful surprise. The lovely golden amber color is accentuated by a slight but lasting head that laces well down the glass. A very pleasant nose greets you as you begin to drink, and this maltiness follows through to the palate, expressing a slight caramel sweetness that is enough to stimulate you without overriding the refreshing drinkable character. There's a mild slightly bitter hop finish. The bottling date is stamped on each bottle to ensure that buyers are aware of freshness. I picked mine up in a Delta Airlines Crown Room Club at the Washington DC Reagan National Airport. Nice selection, Delta."
"Overall: Not a bad beer, very sessionable and a step up from the big boys but nothing special, I wouldn't seek this out by any means."
"M + D: Clean with a crispness and a great, dry finish. Perhaps just a tiny bit stronger than I'd go with as a session brew, but just fine for a few on the patio!"
"This is a nice, drinkable beer, if not a classic of the genre."
"Decent flavor profile as well. Bready and toasty and grainy. Good bit of toffee as well. This wasnt too bad. I enjoyed this but am not sure I will purchase again. Worth a shot, in the end."
"Fairly drinkable."
"This is a very drinkable beer and I am pleasantly surprised. I live right near this brewery and I've avoided drinking it for years with fear that I'd be disappointed. Stupid me. Drinkability is great and I could down quite a few of these."
"Malt dominates this beer, and that's a good thing. It works. I believe this is my first try of this style, and I like it. Looking forward to trying others in this category."
"Clear gold with a thin off-white head. Sweet, lightly buttery pilsner malt and a low noble hoppiness. Clean sweet pale malt flavor balanced with a grassy hop bitterness. A bit of caramel and biscuits. Very refreshing and easy to drink...smooth and balanced. Good session lager."
"Pours a clear, medium light straw color with a nice cloudy white head. Aromas start out with what I perceive to be a lot of diacetyl, but it soon dissipates. A very light malt note follows with a slight spicy hop note, but the butter lingers. On the palate, a medium low bodied lager delivers a balanced malt and hop flavor, neither overwhelming. Mouthfeel is quite light and dry with a very crisp, dry finish. Not as hoppy as I would expect for a Dortmunder, but a decent beer nonetheless."
"D: Pretty sweet but in line with the Dortmunder style. Easy to drink and with a nice, complex aroma and flavor profile."
"Pours golden-straw color with a thick, creamy head. Strong buttery aroma. Toffee and caramel malt flavor, some breadiness. The mouth feel is thick and rich, quite carbonated. A good example of the Dortmunder style. Hopefully this will survive the changes at the brewery, it's a beer my non-craft drinking friends enjoy."
"Drinkability: A good version of a Dortmunder, a refreshing drink on a hot summer night."
"Not a bad all-around beer. I've had MANY others that are similar in style, but taste alot worse than this. I could probably drink many of these and be much more satisfied than any macro. Worth drinking, for sure."
"This is a pretty decent brew, and I'd have it again if it were my best option. Not bad and worth a try."
"A very sweet and grainy beer with not much to show as far as complexity. However, it's a very drinkable and clean lager perfect for the summer."
"Sweet, I love finding a decent craft lager. This stacks up with the other fine Export's I've tried. There's a creamy malt flavor with a touch of crisp hops and a mellow, lingers bitterness. Yummy. I would appreciate a touch more malt flavor, but there's no hint of adjunct or anything nasty. Just a tasty lager to enjoy."
"Very easy going down. Paired weel with my seasoned steak wrap."
"Overall a tasty lager. Very drinkable."
"Poured from a 12oz. brown bottle into my nonic Imperial pint glass. Appears a clear yellow in color with about two fingers of off-white foam. Smells of bready yeast and light hops. Tastes of lightly toasted grains and crisp, understated hops. Medium in both body and mouthfeel. Not a bad beer, but there are better ones in this style that I'd reach for first."
"Pours a clear lighter amber with a suprising light, fluffy head capping the pint. Nose is very malty. Flavor profile continues with the lightly roasted malt notes. Some faint fruit and sweetness. It was smooth, but not all that much happening here. This was OK, not offensive, but not enough to make you want a 2nd. Thanks to dherling for this one."
"Pours a light golden color with a one finger head. Aroma is mild but pleasant, like a sweeter version of your typical American lager. Taste is pleasantly full and robust for the style. Very tasty grains with hints of carmel malts, citrusy hops, and spices. Feels great drinking it and is highly sessionable. If it were available in my area, it would be a regular. Great version of the style."
"D- A good session beer, I could enjoy this beer on a nice summer evening."
"There was little aroma but i detected some sweet smell, maybe citrus. if you view the info on this beer its got a lot put into it, but seems to result in a prett mellow brew, This could just be me but the tatse seemed rather unremarkable. It was by no means a bad beer. It just seemed slightly above par or avg to me. The taste for me was light plane and maybe a little sweet. Very little if any hop,or bitterness. I understand that a lager is not mean to be hopped up and super bitter, but i just feel the lager fell a bit flat, and maybe could have more depth of flavor. worth a try but nothing remarkable."
"Overall impression: Not a bad lager - certainly drinkable, and interesting enough to enjoy a few."
"The beer had a tangerine/orange hue with gold highlights and a bit of haziness to it. It had a miniature head of small white bubbles that just fizzled away in a matter of only a few seconds. It just left a spatter of white bubbly lace and rings. If you put your ear to it, it sounds a lot like Rice Krispies. You can hear snap, crackle and pop! It barely had an aroma to it. The aroma was just toasted malt, hops, sweet butter, and with a hint of citrus fruits. The first taste I received from this beer was butter. I thought the first taste was going to be malt, but not this lager. After the butter comes a pinch of toasted malt and just a slight snap of citrus hops at the end. I didn't know Old Dominion was buttering up their beer. I guess they had some butter lying around the brewery and decided to put it in the beer to make it taste like you're eating popcorn at the movie theater. The mouthfeel was light and just had a small aftertaste of citrus fruits. Without the butter taste, it would have risen this beer to an average run of the mill Lager beer that would have been OK to drink, but with it, I wouldn't drink it again. Too much butter and not enough malt or any other decent flavors."
"Recommended."
"If this was a blind test, I'd assume this was from western Germany. Very good. Export styles are fairly rare to see, especially from a US brewery and these guys do it very well. I could drink this often, especially at the end of summer."
"Draft at Green Leafe, Williamsburg VA. This is hazy orange with a thin veil of foam. Lightly hoppy, but not much of a bite. Smooth and evenly malty, mostly. This is a well done, light lager, an awesome beer if youre looking for a good session lager! (#2696, 2/12/2007)"
"Generally a smooth and easy drinking bigger lager. The diacetyl was a bit disturbing early, but overall found a nice hop/malt balance (but neither was robust enough to make this as good as better examples of the style - like DAB)."
"A nice ""session"" brew. Thanks to a friend of mine for bringing me a six-pack of this from Virginia. If it were available in my area I could see getting this to accompany a ballgame or as a thirst-quencher on a hot day, or to accompany chicken wings or the like."
"The drinkability is ave. Nothing of interest here. MK"
"OV: drinkable but slight off flavors detract somewhat, upsetting due to near flawless presentation."
"I just wish that there was something to be said about this one, the metal taste and the way I just never got into it really didnt help it."
"Drinkability: Yup, sessionable. More alcohol in here than I expected but didn't seem to stop me from enjoying a few."
"drinkable, sessionable summer beer on a 90 degree day. interesting malt character as a dortmunder effort makes it a treat among all the other straight lemon zest summer offerings."
"This is a nice refreshing lager for the summer months."
"This beer poured a golden color with a nice fluffy white head. Nose was a muted malt and not much else. Taste is a blend of refreshing malts and comes thru with a hint of hops to finish. Mouthfeel is lively and refreshing. Overall drinkability is very good. This is a brew that would totally hit the spot after a round a golf or after cutting the grass because of the refreshing factor."
"Drinkability: Stellar drinkability. This is a ""BEST OF..."" Dortmunder Lager, I'm telling you."
"Deasy drinking, could easily be a session beer and they were wonderful with the steak I cooked for dinner."
"The beer pours a pale gold color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is great. It has a wonderfully malty scent that boasts of pale, Munich, and Carapils malts. It smooth and creamy with a bisquity feel. The taste is good. It has a nice malty flavor that is light, but well rounded. It goes down easy and finishes dry with some residual malt sweetness. The mouthfeel is good. It is a low/medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a damn good lager. It's full flavored and easy drinking; a fine session beer."
"Drinkability: Consumption is rather easy, yet taste is lackluster. Nothing about this beer leaves me craving another, but all the same, nothing deters me."
"Drinkability & Notes: Extremely drinkable, very light and refreshing. Could drink 'em till silly."
"Had a 22-oz draft of this at my favorite watering hole. It pours a light and clear golden color with a small bit of head and no lacing. It has a standard light lager smell with a bit of fruity overtones. The mouthfeel is light with a sharp fizzyness. The taste is clean, slightly hoppy, with a lasting light hoppy aftertaste. I wasnt too surprise to learn later that this was a Dortmunder style lager. I seem to enjoy the Dortmunder and Imperial Pilsners the most of the Pilsner-ish or light lagers."
"The taste is simply one of balance. The sweetness of the lighter malt is balanced well with a good amount of hops and the astringent of the lagering. There's a slight sense of malt huskiness, but seems to fit. All in all, nearly perfect for the style and amazingly drinkable. I put it right up there with Great Lake's Dortmunder Gold."
"Old Dominion brews some outstanding beer, as I was reminded of while briefly reading some of my reviews. This one is excellent and is impressively drinkable as well. Its enjoyability is attributable, first and foremost, to the brewing skill of its creators. If I lived in Virginia, I'd drink a whole lot of Dominion Lager."
"Overall- a mediorce lager, slighty watery with a decent malt taste every 4th sip. Won't purchase again. I would drink if there weren't other options though!"
"On-tap at The Barking Dog. Good tasting lager, but minimal complexity or distinctness. It's got a medium-brown color with little head. I faintly smell caramel along with some roasted character. The taste is smooth and refreshing with a slight oak character. This brew is moderately hopped and that's what I taste after each sip. Again, not complex or unique but the taste is not discouraging and fairs well as an average (or slightly above average) lager. A few of these can be had because of it's mild attributes."
"I noticed that it formed a nice head. It was well carbonated but not fizzy. There was a bright golden to yellow hue. The body of the beer is relatively light. The aroma has a grassy, straw quality. I noticed a bit of a yeasty character in the nose. This is enticing to a beer drinker.I found the flavor to be gentle. The light body gives it a good drinkability. This is a good session beer. You can take this beer to a picnic or BBQ. It works perfectly well in situations when you will drink more than one. There is a lot of malt emphasis in this beer. That is typical of German and German style beers. This malt character gives Dominion Lager a slightly sweet flavor."
"A beer that could get unfairly overlooked as some find the style unexciting, or overshadowed by it's big brother in the Old Dominion Line, Tupers Hot Pocket Pils. This would make a fine beer to serve at a gathering of macro drinkers and beer geeks."
"The beer poured a nice gold with a small white head. The aroma was of sour malt. The taste was of sour malt with a touch of hops. The feel was light and slightly oily. This beer was a pleasant surprise. I went in to find something reasonably priced for July 4th and how could I pass up what should be a decent beer at $9.00 a 12 pack? What I got was a fresh case of beer that is probably the ideal american lager. This isn't a great beer, but is certainly a good beer to open the door for those who haven't tried anything other than a macro."
"Pours light golden, slightly cloudy. Very little head. The scent is mostly the malts, while with the taste, you get a nice blend of the multiple hops and malts. Many of the ingredients and a description is on the bottle, which is nice. Hops are quite floral and refreshing. Overall a good lager. Dominion has made another good beer."
"12 oz., bottled on Oct. 1, 2004, with a blurb about the beer on the back label - brewed with 4 different malts and 5 hop varieties. Served chilled in a pilsner glass. It is a pale gold with a slight haze and a half inch head that leaves decent lacing. Lots of diacetyl (butter/butterscotch), caramel, and a nice hop aroma (floral?). Diacetyl is also big on the palate, there is a nice bitterness that lingers and a hint of metal. The flavor is substantial and the malt notes remind me of a brown ale. No hop flavors stand out, but you can tell there's a good amount in there. It is crisp at first, but becomes very smooth. One of the tastiest light-colored lagers I've ever had."
"Not experienced with the dortmunder/export style. This beer medium brown with a firm white head. Plenty of bubbles and a malty aroma. Sweet. More sweet. Not cloying. Pretty full mouthfeel, sweet and citrusy finish, but I didn't get the hoppy bite that others have reported. This is an easy drinker. Good beer to introduce to a regular macro drinker."
"Sampled this one a few minutes after finishing a Brooklyn Lager. Not really fair to compare the two, as they are completely different styles of lagers. Old Dominion is a Dortmunder Export, very similar in character to the the excellent, Great Lakes version. This pours a clear, golden body with a healthy vanilla white head that is mediumsized, The head hangs around quite a bit, and leaves a moderate dose of patch lace on the glass. Aroma has lots of floral hoppiness with an undertone of grainy malt. A hint of clover honey caps the bouquet. Mouthfeel is underwhelming, but decent enough, with light to medium body and adequate carbonation. The taste is quite good. Assertive floral and herbal hops are augmented by some sour lemon. Malt presence balances well, with a touch of soda cracker and clover honey. Fruity pear notes appear midway. Well balanced finish with mild citric bitterness. Complex for a lager, but this is a well rendered version of the Dortmunder style, which in my opinion puts Classic American Lagers to shame. Excellent drinkability. One of the better American lagers you're going to find."
"The mouthfeel is lively carbonated with a medium light body. It is a flavorful and easy to drink."
"A very enjoyable beer. While it won't win any prizes, or contend for the best Lager you've ever had I don't have any complaints. Pale gold to golden in color it has an appealing appearance, full bodied taste, and pleasing aroma. A pleasure to drink and beats the pants off of similar more available beers. I make sure to have one when I am in the area of the brew pub."
"Received from Manekineko. Thanks! 12 oz bottle chilled in a pint glass. The brew pours a light yellow color and a small bleached white head foams up and fades to an edge layer rather quickly. Aroma is grainy, husky malt with some caramel and not much else, rather mild on the nose. First sip reveals an average body and fine tingly carbonation. Flavor is sweet malt up front and some husk again. I get a bit of fruitiness developing as the beer warms, light apricots. The beer is nice and crisp and refreshing. Very clean finish and easy to drink. I wish the fruity flavors were just a little more robust and the aroma was more pronounced."
"Had a few of these on tap in Arlington recently. I found it to be an extremely drinkable beer, and a fine accompaniment to a varied dinner (pasta, filet, shrimp). The beer is a pale, hazy yellow color. The head is tremendous, towering, and long-lastingwhite and thick. The aroma is notably yeasty, and has gives the smell a doughy, soft edge. Also in the smell is a little citrus and light hoppiness. Its not particularly sweet, and is medium to light in body. Finish is clean, crisp, and hoppy. Its a well-made and very enjoyable brew."
"Beer is good. Happy beering."
"Pours a slightly cloudy golden color. Head is creamy and slowly dissipates. There was a perceptible citrus aroma to this beer, like grapefruit. Light hoppy notes too. Taste was of cirtus again and slightly bitter. Aftertaste was malty goodness and hoppy bitter. I felt I wanted just a bit more body to this beer, but I still liked it. I think the thing that stuck with me the most was the maltiness, which I enjoyed. Overall, I thought it balanced the malt and hops flavors nicely. This was a pretty damn good beer and I'd definitely try their other brews in addition."
"FInal Thought: This is about the next best thing to GL: Dortumunder Gold - for American Micro Export Lagers..."
"This just tasted like your average run of the mill lager. Nothing special, it was just there. I guess the only good thing about it, was that it was refreshing and kind of had a malty/hjoppy hint to it. Had no real head to it, and was a golden straw color. Had it at the brewery, but I don't think I would go for it in bottles. I think it geared towards the folks who drink Bud and stuff like that."
"Appearance: Golden hue deep straw sunshine honey tone with a slight tint of amber going on, forms large chunky white frothy head leaving thick heavy patches of lace as the billowing head dwindles. Aroma: Cereal grain sweetness stands out with a touch of peppery Saaz and herbal noble hops great presence with a honey like sweetness as well. Taste: Excellent export style lager contains flavorful layers of lightly toasted specialty grains wow malt character definitely broadens as this beer warms a bit, light and refreshing decent dose of traditional hops perfect summertime brew. Mouthfeel: Lighter body easy carbonation I'm a fan perfect crisp and flavorful lager. Drinkability: An easy sixpack beer all the wayy for a refreshing flavorful lager grab some Old Dom Lager good stuff."
"A very nice lager. Pours a light golden/amber color. There is almost no head at all, even though I tried to get one going. Smelled rather yeasty upon opening but once in the class that smell was gone. A very tasty beer. This is highly drinkable, I wish I had chilled the entire six pack. I thank my wife for brining me some back from VA."
"Clear pale golden color with a very thin head and minimal lace. Forced carbonation is very lively. Aroma is clean and grainy with subtle delicately floral hops. Taste is again clean grainy malt with very light hoppyness. There are almost no fruity esters to speak of. A little citric tartness starts creeping in mid palette. Enjoy this for what it is folks, a simple, clean, sessionable lager. Pretty similar in most respects to Samuel Adams Boston Lager, but a bit less malty. Thanks AragornUnplugged for this trade."
"I'm drinking this nice beer out of a Dominion pint glass I just bought at their Ashburn, VA, brewpub this weekend. It's a dark golden color that had a nice white head (gone now, though). I'm not quite sure what niche this beer fills because it won't help macro-drinkers convert to micros, but it's not really different enough from a macro to attract your average micro-drinker. Actually, however, that's one of its strong suits for me: I don't like Bud and Coors because I know they taste bad to me, but my palate is not refined enough to taste all the subtleties in most craft beers, so their flavors are often lost on me. This one has just enough flavor, carbonation, and body to make me enjoy it-- and it's not even a style I normally enjoy."
"Tasted: 12/30/03"
"Very drinkable and highly recommended for its taste:price ratio. very cheap, great price, equals an everyday drinking beer. Good stuff"
"- Backdated tasting: I first reviewed this beer on 01JUL03, this post is based on notes from that review. -"
"Medium gold color. Small head. Aroma is malty and slightly sweet. A medium bodied dortmunder/helles. Malts are mild, slightly sweet and a touch fruity. Hops are mild as well. Spicy and citrusy, but not very bitter. This is a very well balanced beer. It smooth as silk and very clean tasting. Nice ""lager"". Would make an excellent gateway beer. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly sweet."
"Big thanks to Marc77!"
"Taste was light, astringent grains, with a small hop snap that was a little bit spicy. Mouthfeel was nice with tight carbonation, good for the style. A very drinkable lager and nicely well rounded."
"This beer poured a golden color and formed a foamy white head that left some lace as it slowly subsided. An aroma of malt, hops and grain with a touch of caramel. A flavor of malt, hops and caramel. The finish was light with some hint of caramel and grain. A nice lager but a bit sweet for the style in my opinion."
"Proper lawnmower beer - sweetish (honey/apricot) malt and slight graininess with a well balanced hoppiness (I get mostly noble hop, but there is some citrus way in the back), good underlying bitterness, and a slightly drier finish followed by a slightly sweeter aftertaste. My buddy in DC always has a good supply of these on hand, and for good reason - it's a very drinkable everyday brew. Homebrewers take note: The brewpub will let you take a jar of slurry home, and I've tasted some homebrews using this yeast that are very, very good."
"Overall, a good, clean lager. This isn't a style I'm really into, but I enjoyed this beer and would be glad to have another. Not quite as much character as GLBC's Dortmunder Gold, but one of the better pale lagers I've tried."
"A soft and malty, refreshing lager, drinkable and subtley complex."
"This lager pours a clear bright golden with a nice white head. Balance is the watchword for a Dortmunder style lager and I would say this beer is one of the most balanced I have tasted in a long time. The aroma is very mild and all malt. The flavor is quite balanced with a little malt sweetness and a hop bite that lingers on the tongue. This is a crisp fresh beer that has a surprisingly medium nearly creamy mouthfeel. I would recommend this beer and find it quite drinkable."
"Pours with a good head that goes quickly and leaves no lace. Clear amber color with more malt than hops but the balance is there. This beer has a crisp, smooth, and clean malt palate - very different from the big lagers like Bud. It finishes with a good balance of malt and hop but not bitter."
"This brew pours a deep golden color with a very foamy white head. A light hoppy aroma introduces a light bodied lager with a floral hop presence and a dry malt flavor. The finish is clean a crisp. Altogether a very drinkable brew that goes down easily. Great Sunday sports brew."
"A clear golden body is topped by a short, foamy, bright-white head that dissipates fairly readily but holds a decent collar and thin surface covering as well as leaving some trace lace. The nose welcomes you with a firm expression of grainy malt dressed up by a softly floral & mildly citrusy hoppiness that's actually quite interesting with a soft touch of lemon (?). The body is light/medium with a fine carbonation that caresses the tongue and then falls away quite smoothly. The flavor is exactly as might be expected - a lightly sweet and grainy malt that's gently infused with floral & softly citrusy hop flavors, backed by a firm bitterness. It finishes short and dry. A well-done, refreshing, and enjoyable lager that could easily fit many occassions and would make a great cross-over beer for the macro drinker. It makes me think of summer, baseball, and backyard BBQ's although it's just as good on a crisp night nestled in with a good book or video."
"Pours a slightly hazy bright golden color with a thin white head.  Smell has nice hop aromas.  The hop flavor is light, but it compliments the smooth malt flavors of the brew very well.  Nice light body and nicely smooth in the mouth.  Very drinkable.  This is a very nice brew.  Will definitely go well with the hot weather of the summer."
"Old Dominion Lager is the primary house brew. I like it on tapthough sometimes it has a slight sulphurous aroma and after taste do to overuse of the yeast.One of the original recipes at OD I believe was created by John Mallet former brewmaster.Somewhat rich in flavor as a lager better in cooler weather."
"Notes: A top-notch, well rounded American version of a Dortmund/Export Lager. 5.4%abv."
