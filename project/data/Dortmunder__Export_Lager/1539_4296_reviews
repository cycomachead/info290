"O - It looks more then decent, 1/2 finger foam staying till bottom. Taste is not so powerful, but it is full of grain tastes. Who like this stile, will be satisfy."

"Overall, just meh. It is good to drink this rather than cheap adjuncts in Northeast China. It's labeled as 4.7 ABV, but in fact this one I just drank is 5.4 ABV. Don't know...Cheers to the summer!"

"Overall: The flavors seem ordinary and one-dimensional. The bitterness is not one that refreshes, it begins to annoy. I'll pass on this one in the future."

"There is no offensive about this beer but a bit lackluster. Fairness, yes…repetition, no."
"Overall, pretty average beer, nothing remarkable about it, except its very low price."
"O- An easy drink that does not feel as fake as other industrial beers. Half a point bonus for being so cheap"
"Dr: Relatively low ABV with a crap taste and an excellent price (~.40 Euro in Berlin). This is what we might politely call a ""student beer"". In terms of regional considerations, it's better than the crap cola porter mixes often seen on shelves alongside it in Germany, but that isn't saying a great deal. If the cream were amped up, this would be a much better beer."
"D - I quite liked this beer, as I'll take dominant sweetness over bitterness any day. Its nothing intriguing, but the affordability makes it a good everyday beer with a place in my fridge."
"Bottle: Poured a deep bright yellow color helles with a small foamy head with average retention and not much lacing. Aroma of sweet malt is a bit overwhelming with not much else I term of noticeable characteristics. Taste is also too sweet for the style with no hops presence discernable. Body is quite full with average carbonation. This one is too sweet for my own taste."
"Meh. Poured with a nice, foamy, frothy, white head and a tiny bit of lace. Color is a clear, light yellow and a couple of small bubble trails. Aroma is cereal, starch, and a little hop and malt. Flavor is like nose with a tiny bit of sweetness coming out, especially in the finish. Other than that, flavor is quite bland. Body is ok and so is carbonation. Finish is like I said and strangely, has a little alcohol warmth. Forgettable beer. Better than a light tho, generally speaking ('ceptin' Sam Adams)."
"D: A typical Dortmunder..."
"D: Not bad"
"It's cold, cheap, fresh and it's in my glass. Not much to complain about. Drink Oettinger cold and from the bottle for optimal enjoyment."
"D: This is a pretty drinkable beer with actual flavor, though the flavor is at times not very good. The beer was easy drinking, but I'm not sure I want to drink it again."
"A good and enjoyable beer from on of the best brewcountries in the world."
"Notes: ABV = 5.4%. A cheap beer that doesn't taste horrible, but there are certainly better beers and examples than this one. Not very balanced but makes a decent summer time beer to drink."
"I find as I continue to read others reviews of German beer, many recieve low scores because of an over-all lack of a ""wow"" factor. Now that Im cut off from the world of barrel-aged 12% stouts and IPA's with 8 hop varietials, I actually am finding more and more in the simple refined execution o these traditional brews. A good thing in really being able to find the hidden, subtile flavors often overlooked...but I really am looking foward to the palate-blowing intensity of craft beer! Cheers"
"Gold color and small head that disappeared quickly. Not too impressed. Initial taste was carbonation, malt and a bit of bitterness that was not hoppy. It was more like a metalic taste that persisted throughout the entire experience. This is quite different from the Oettinger Gold in the big bottle. Cheap price and cheap tasting. I wish this was a good beer due to the price. I just can't drink this on a regular basis. I have tried this several times to be sure that it was not a bad batch and the taste is the same. I passed by the brewery recently and hoped to try some of the other brands. However, there is too much good beer brewed close by to take a chance on an inferior product."
"Oh yeah: the bottle says 5.4 ABV, not 4.7. But I know this is the same label, same beer as the title says. Is the 4.7 a typo? Or did they up the % recently?"
"Smells malty with a bitter flat hoppy smell. Pours to a standard yellowish lager color. Taste is very sweet almost marzen-like. The hoppy bitterness evident in the smell is almost not present in the taste. Quite a common tasting, nothing spectacular but very drinkable."
"This tastes light and makes good for a good session beer."
"Not too bad, after all, clean, drinkable."
"D- acceptable and not unpleasant to drink. found this refreshing enough. Nothing outstanding in the flavour or smell, but could drink a few, and at 40p i did!"
"Overall: An acceptable beer for BBQ's but not much else. I was dissapointed because from the pour and smell it looked like it might be good. Too bad."
"Once again using the 25 cl glass, received ¾ inch head. Just a few seconds and it disappears into a nice rim fizz. The color is that of a yellow gummi bear. Smell is a light caramel and malt, with the taste being the same."
