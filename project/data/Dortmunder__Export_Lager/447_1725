There really isn't anything special about this at all, but if the name of the beer was just Export, well it just wouldn't have a nice ring to it. A fair lawnmower beer, if ice cold.

3,7.1,3,3,3,3,3,"By reading other reviews it's apparent that most people don't remember the Special Export brewed by Heileman when it was brewed in LaCross, Wisconsin. At that time Special Export was a Krausened beer, like Old Style and was a beer a big step up from Old Style or pretty much any other of the hundreds of ordinary beers of it's day. Like Ballantine XXX Ale, Export pretty much only exists in label and fond memories or earlier days.","fizzy","Feb 17, 2012"

3.09,10.4,2.5,3.5,2.5,3,4,"Thanks to woodychandlerfor the trade.Poured from a 16 oz. can. Has a pale yellow color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of malts and grains. Taste is very mild, crisp and light, not much going on at all. Feels light in the mouth and is very drinkable. Overall a good beer on a hot day, but otherwise mediocre.","tone77","Dec 12, 2008"
4.03,43.9,4,3.5,4,3.5,5,"My pour initially produced a finger-and-a-half of rocky bone-white head, but its retention level caused it to do a pretty quick fade. Color was a deep golden-yellow with NE-quality clarity. Holy nose, Batman! This actually smelled like clean, unadulterated lager! It had a clean lager sweetness with just a hint of hops. Oh, be still, my beating heart! Mouthfeel was medium with a smooth, pleasant flavor of simple lager, slightly sweet with a touch of bitterness in the mouth. Finish was equally pleasant and devoid of any off flavors. Houston, we have a winner! This is definitely going into my cooler, if I had the opportunity to score some on a routine basis.","woodychandler","Nov 02, 2008"
3.02,7.9,2,2.5,3,3,4,"From what I remember, its best quality was drinkabilty. Goes down smooth and easy. Taste and smell weren't bad either.

Not a bad beer pong beer if I do say so myself.","Mistofminn","Sep 08, 2008"

2.94,5,2,3,3,3,3,"Served straight from a can, nothing really special with the look. Normal beer golden color. Little head, which quickly dissolves. Smell nothing special, and nothing pungent. Taste better than your normal Pabst Brewery Beer. Average overall, nothing special, but to me my beer tasted FRESH, which was a plus. Mouthfeel and drinkability average. OVERALL its an average beer, which is a good thing. To me its also a good thirst quencher.","NOOGIE","Oct 03, 2007"

Light yellow appearance and cheap beer smell. The taste is crisp and an attempt not to offend. It seems to be a bit thinner than it used to be. This is an OK low priced beer for kicking back in the garage.","SargeC","Aug 02, 2007"

2.63,-6.1,3,2.5,2.5,2.5,3,"The old classic "Green Death". Bottle smell is corny and sweet. Poured into a tankard, great head, tiny bubbles, real foamy. Golden color. Taste is very pilsner-like. Good carbonation. No notable bitters even in finish. Taste is same throughout. Kind of boring. Good lawnmower beer. Recommend ice cold on a hot summer day.","mooseisloose","Jun 09, 2007"

Not the finest beer you will ever taste but a very good one when price is factored into the equation. Crisp, Hoppy and sharp at first I find that while the flavor fades quickly there is no aftertaste which replaces it meaning one must take another drink. Not a bad proposition.","chuckm","Dec 05, 2006"

3.54,26.4,3,4,3.5,3,3.5,"A surprisingly good lager in a place I would not have expected it. Hard to believe that Pabst made this, an American beer from a macrobrewery that is good. A nice surprise in the glass at $2.99 for a six pack.","Zorro","Mar 24, 2006"
3.28,17.1,3,2.5,3.5,3,4,"I normallly distaste pale - domestic lagers; but this one seems to be the best @ $10.99 / 30 pack; it cannot be beat.

3,7.1,3,3,3,3,3,"This was one of those beers where, when it turns out not to be as bad as you expected, it then almost seems good. Bright pale gold with assertive carbonation. Sweetish, with some vague corn flavor and hopping that comes across with a bit of artificial grape flavoring. No skunking, despite the green bottle, which makes me think that some stabilizer must be in play here. I'd probably take this over many of the basic Eurolager crowd.","Brent","Beers"

3.02,7.9,2.5,3,3,2.5,3.5,"Pours clear and golden yellow into the glass. Minimal head, but fairly decent lacing. I used to drink the shit out of this stuff when I was younger. I am over that, but at 14.00 for a 30 pack, I thought it was worth a try again. Smell doesn't impress, corny grainy, somewhat chemical, that is about it. Light carbonation burn followed by a corny taste. Not awfull, but not good either. I don't feel ripped off, but this is not a beer I would neccesarily reccomend either.","corporatejim","Dec 07, 2005"

3.59,28.2,2.5,3.5,3,4,5,"Pours a very clear and bright golden yellow, medium thick white head forms, little bit of lacing. Smell is honey, grass, citrus, some floral hops, kind of perfumy. Taste is sweet and malty, some iron, citrus and floral. Mouthfeel is light bodied, carbonation is medium to low. Really not a bad adjunct lager. The carbonation is a ton lower than any other adjunct lager I've had, so theres more flavour and its real smooth.","Viggo","Sep 07, 2005"
2.41,-13.9,3,2,2.5,2.5,2.5,"Can obtained with a bunch of other stuff as a reward for volunteering for GABF. Can stamp reads 01096 A11492. Pouors a two finger white sticky head that quickly settles. Crystal clear light golden straw colored liquid. Smells very light. Mild sweet and a hint of floral hops. Tastes mild sweet with floral hops late and fruity esters that mix with the hops in the aftertaste. Corn and empty flavor. Too simple to be even a session beer. Light body and Md carbonation. Rated to style.","mentor","Jun 21, 2005"
3.88,38.6,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Nothing wrong with this beer. It is more of a macro adjunct lager than a Dortmunder and I reviewed it as such. This was brewed in Milwaukee. Clear gold capped with a bright white head. The head diminishes quickly and leaves no lace. Very fizzy and light on the tongue. Nose is neutral maybe some adjunct grass and slight yeast. Light flavor with the same adjuncts found in the aroma but primarily clean, finishes crisp, slight aftertaste. Quite drinkable.","jimbotrost","Aug 27, 2004"
3.65,30.4,3.5,3.5,4,3,3.5,"Honestly now, this is a pretty good beer for a friggin' macro. Poured out to a clear golden color with medium carbonation. A 1/2 inch head was present, but quickly dissipated. No traces of lace noted. Aromas of malt and adjunct, with a floral like quality as well. Taste is very comparable to other import lagers, as that is what Heilmann was going for; flavors of corn, malt, oats, grain, and a bit on the sweet side. Finished crisp with a touch of dryness. This is a well made macro. Would make a killer session beer. If you like import lagers, like Heineken, Beck's or the like, this is the beer for you at half the price.This is also a good place to make your start for micro's and higher quality beers, if you're still stuck in swill-land. Recommended.","Frozensoul327","Jul 23, 2004"
1.68,-40,2,1.5,1.5,2,2,"This is the dog of the Pabst line. Next to Old Style or even regular PBR, it can't stand up. This beer has the flavor of it's container. If it's from a bottle or tap, then you are lucky and it is at best flavorless. From a can, it tastes like aluminum. A great beer for heavy smokers, as it allows you to save money for cigarettes while not noticing that your beer is nickel and cadmium flavored.","StuFox","May 27, 2004"

2.7,-3.6,2,2,3,3,3,"Decent for a macro. Nothing too offensive or too special about Special Export. Highly carbonated, pours to a sudsy head that dissapears quickly. Kinda dark for a fizzy yellow american lager. Taste is clean with noticable corn adjunct. Finishes with a bit of warmth and bitter bite. Tastes a bit strong in the alcohol department. If given the choice I definitely have to take this over the typical BMC offerings.","EagleTalon","May 23, 2003"
2.87,2.5,2,2.5,3,2.5,3.5,"Clear straw with a fizzy short head and no real lace to speak of. Sweetish smell, barely brown sugar. Light body with generous carbonation. Flavor is hardly outstanding but there is a sense of bare grain to the malt, any adjuncts seem to be background players, and there's a "Pabst Blue Ribbon" bit of real hop balance. The carbonation, while lively, combines well with the hop and doesn't fizz down the throat as in some cheaper Lagers. I will probably drink a few more cans of this along with dumping them in coolers at cookouts.","ADR","Mar 07, 2003"
2.6,-7.1,2.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,3,"The taste, however, ain’t bad, smooth, with a slight warming hit at the end, which follows a blast of sweet malts, and yes, a hint of malts. Not bad, not great, but not bad.","jackndan","Feb 16, 2003"
