"While this certainly is NOT an explosive or big full-flavored craft beer, the likes of which we normally praise around here, this is an excellent offering for its style and highly recommended (as a fun training-wheels brew) as their winter seasonal offering or--even better--in place of a cold, wet macro-brew should the need arise after mowing the lawn on a summer day."
"It's a damn good beer!! My favorite from Shiner."
"A beer to be gulped, but enjoyed for its solid, pleasing taste."
"Pours a medium to dark golden color, with a fairly decent amount of white foam on top. On the nose, hoppy, slightly grainy with just a hint of vanilla. On the palate, light bodied, refreshing and moderately carbonated, with herbal hops, and a heavier pilsner-like character. Drinkable, and not much more."
"First taste is impressive, but after a bit, it becomes watery and almost bland."
"Notes: There is not much to say here. Frost does everything well for the style and I enjoyed it."
"Drinkability - not sure if the diacetyl means these are aging a bit, but they go down easily."
"An excellent example of Dortmunder. There are a lot of subtle flavors that are excellent. After trying most of Shiner's new beers and being very disappointed ( Smokehaus, 99, 100, 101) I am very surprised that this is a well made beer. Put Live Oak or Great Lakes in front, and this is considered a great lager. Something I highly recommend."
"So the appearance...ya it looks pretty good i'd say. The smell....sweet with a hint of hops perhaps? Taste...a bit disappointing really. Not a lot going on. Mouthfeel a bit watery....but drinkable for sure. Give it a try, it might be right up your alley, plus the abv is not too high or too low, maybe even just right."
"Shiner Frost isn't quite as good as the gold standard (Great Lakes Dortmunder Gold), but it's still a tremendous achievement for Spoetzl Brewery. Is this their best beer? Yeah, it just might be."
"Overall a very good beer and went well with some Jarlsberg Swiss cheese. Highly recommended."
"D: Easily drinkable. A nice malty beer with fair finish; not to light, not too heavy."
"Drinkability: I'd definitely have this one again, but given its warming characteristic it isn't well-suited for Houston summers."
"I'm not usually terribly impressed by new beers since I can't afford anything too fancy, but this was only $7 and it's one of my new favorites. I'm gonna buy it up before it disappears."
"Pours a coppery golden, with a nice head that quickly disipates, leaving only moderate lacing. Decent grainy aroma, though I would have enjoyed a bit more of a hops presence. Taste is a bit weak, though what was there was enjoyable. Again, there was a grainy presence that might have been better complemented with more hops presence. Mouthfeel was decent enough, but not really memorable in any respect. Overall, a drinkable beer, but I expect a bit more from this brewery."
"D - A bit dry and hard for my taste, it's going down slow. I also don't understand Shiner calling this a ""hearty, full-bodied ale"" when Dortmunder Exports are, by definition, medium-bodied at their fullest. Still, not a bad beer though."
"Taste is a very nice balance between malt and hops, just a little dry, but just a little sweet. I like this. Very thirst-quenching. Must seek out others of this style."
"D: Easy to drink and has more flavor than typical pale lagers. A bit stronger than I'd like for a session beer, but I can't taste the alcohol, so it's easy to get carried away."
"Drinkability: Not bad, not bad at all. Quaffable, refreshing, Fr√∂st is simply a tasty little lager."
"Finally had a chance to try this ""new"" beer from the folks at Shiner .. it's on the hoppy side (which I like), refreshing (which I like), affordable (which I really like). Highly recommended and would be a great summer beer should Shiner decides to keep it available at that time. But just in case they don't, I plan on stocking up, especially as the store I bought it at has it on sale. Having this beer with chicken burgers btw - great combo!"
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, mild kick, good representation of style, this is a good lighter beer that is worth pounding down several of over a long period of time."
"I'd absolutely drink another of these, seems like a great hot summer day beer after a softball game or mowing the lawn."
"If you really think about it there are not many beers of this style available in the USA. THis is a good beer but just one step down from Great Lakes Dortmunder Gold. This one seems a little less hoppier and just a little more watered down. Still it is good to have another example of this style to drink."
"Pours a clear, golden color. 3/4 inch head of a white color. Great retention and slight lacing. Smells of sweet malt, yeast, slight hop, earthiness (grain), and slight vanilla. Fits the style of a Dortmunder / Export Beer. Mouth feel is slightly smooth and crisp with a high carbonation level. Tastes of yeast, sweet malt, slight pale malt, slight hop, and a hint of citrus. Overall, good feel and a decent blend, the hop addition nicely cuts the sweetness."
"This is well crafted to the guides set for the style, and the best of the Shiner series in my opinion."
"Not a style you find very often.Poured into a .5 liter stein a clear rich golden with a large fluffy white crown atop,a majestic pour.Light in the aroma department,just some lightly toasted grain,and some light honey.Flavors wont knock your socks off but have some nice subtle qualities,lightly toasted and grainy,some hoeny malt sweetness,and a smack of herbal hop in the finish.This was made for the wrong season,its refreshing but ""sturdy"" enough,I could see mylef drinkin this out tin the yard over the spring and summer."
"Drinks pretty easy, a solid shot at the style, I'd happily drink a few on a warm summer's day"
"D - little aftertaste, very satisfying, gets better as you drink.."
"It's good beer yeah, it taste similar to Coors to me. i notice little or no hops but some malt. very attractive labeling and packaging. bought a dozen at HEB for 11.99 enjoyed them all they go quickly. not much more to say its frosty goodness from shiner texas. agree it may be a tad sweet if allowed to warm a bit."
"D: You could do worse if you're looking for a nice beer on a hot day, though I'm not sure this brew is available in spring/summer. It's not bad, but not entirely flavorful either."
"D: It's sad to say this is probably the best beer I've had from Shiner. A decent enough lager, but not something I'd be interested in having again."
"Dortmunders are rarely produced by American micros because they're not exciting, and are all about good balance. This is a well-done one by a brewer known for as many misses as hits. Still, I can't imagine buying it very often. Dortmunder just isn't exciting."
"Overall an excellent offering by Shiner. I do recommend this one."
"D- Another lager from Shiner that fails to really shine, but does provide a lasting impression"
"Why is this a winter brew? So we get bock year round, but a refreshing blonde ale in the winter? I don't know about that. On the other hand I enjoyed this brew...for what it is. For my money better than Dortmunder Export, or a Rock Bottom Golden Ale, or any of the American Standard Lagers for that matter. I wonder how much it cost them to brew this and why couldn't the other big companies hit this standard of quality. I think a lot of people could enjoy this potential gateway brew."
"D- High, I could go through a bunch of these. Worth having if you see it, I wouldn't trade for it unless you're a lager junkie but it's a damn good beer."
"Mouthfeel is light and carbonation is above average, which works well for the style. Drinkability is good, a nice lighter beer with some good flavors. This isn't one of my favorite styles but it's a pretty good version of the style."
"D- A decent beer that drinks alright. The aftertaste could maybe use just a bit of work."
"Spoetzl Brewery's take on the Dortmunder style is an outstanding drinkable beer. A frothy, tawny gold colored pour that is a gentle reminder that beer was an important refuge to the working class, In this case, the Dortmund coal miners, who probably found this style of brew to be not only a throat 'cutter"" but also also an elixir of restorative malts. ""Frosty goodness"" throughout the straight forward flavors, complimented by an outstanding semi-dry finish."
"-Cheers!"
"Light/medium bodied, very smooth and easy to drink. Maybe not the greatest example of the style, but still an enjoyable lager in any case."
"This one is very close to the style, malt forward like a helles yet fuller in body. This brewery should consider this as a year round offering. I am confused that the bottle states, this is ""a seasonal ale."" This is a lager."
"Verdict: Easily identifiable as a Shiner beer, Frost is bright and happy, though ultimately forgettable. A solid winter seasonal for the Shiner faithful, though nothing worthwhile for the rest of us."
"D - Another ho hum average beer from shiner on the plus side it's an easy drinking beer but unexciting or note worthy"
"Taste has a pleasant balance of sweet and toffee malts that are followed by a quick carbonation and hop palate scrubbing. Smooth and creamy feeling in the mouth. There is a mild soapy taste that is really the only minor problem I have with this beer. Shiner has done a great job on this one and it is in my top three or four beers they have made. It's a great value to boot, as I am on my second twelve-pack of it since coming out in early January."
"Mouthfeel was medium bodied and lightly coarse in texture."
"Not a bad beer at all. I just feel like it's a kind of bastardized version of the style just like Shiner Bock is a bastardized Bock. Still it's a nice clean lager with a little bit of character."
"Not sure how this gets such high ratings, but this has nothing in common with the higher rated beers of this style such as Dortmunder Gold. This is just a basic lager targeted to BMC drinkers, packaged as craft beer."
"The brewers from Gambrinus cleverly try to market this brand as a German/Czech style beer....perhaps they should visit these areas to see what the beer tastes like, cause none of their brews are it."
"M/D: Nothing really stands out except for the hops. Mouthfeel is perfect for the style, its clean and very 'sessionable'. You can drink alot of this and not get bored."
"-Cheers."
"Notes: good example of the style though not my favorite"
"Overall, not your beer if you like a lot of aggressive flavor, however it follows the Dortmunder standard pretty well, and would make a decent session beer."
"D - I could knock a few of these back, but it's nothing to write home about."
"More interesting than the TX staple Shiner Bock. Frost would be a great gateway beer to the world of craft beer, or a nice change of pace for those looking for a light, straightforward lager that does a lot more tastewise than the macro staples."
"d - Overall it was a decent beer. I thought it was a little lacking in the flavor/taste department, but it is very light and drinkable. I was looking for something under 6% ABV and this did the job."
"- but not interesting enough to keep my attention."
"A good session beer in my book - solidly malty for the winter months."
"The taste is a bit more muted than the aroma, unfortunately, because the flavor that is present is quite good. Crisp, crackery german pilsner malts on the front of the palate are followed by a combination of sulfur minerals and hops. Traces of grassy bitterness linger into the finish as this Dortmunder dries the back of the palate. Light body with a good carbonation level, not exactly ""full-bodied"" as the neck label claims, but there is very little in the way of off-flavors or undesirable consistencies. I enjoyed this beer a little more than my review's score suggested. Not sure if Fr√∂st fits as a winter seasonal, but I am looking forward to the rest of my six-pack."
"D- A very drinkably beer. Light and crisp, throughly enjoyable. Possibly my new favorite shiner product."
"Opinion: Well, this is a pretty decent beer, and I am surely going to drink the six-pack that I got. I am not sure how much more I will be buying. The price was reasonable <$7, so we'll see what happens in the future. It is worth a shot, but you may want to split some with a buddy or two so you can make up your own mind."
"This seasonal brew is very good. It is best served ice cold to accent its strong malt and seasonal elements that really put you in the mood for the great Texas summers ahead. This is one of my favorites from Shiners limited brew runs."
"drinkability is ok but the adjuncts kill it"
"A very sessional beer, I believe I will be opening another."
"Another fun offering from the boys at Spoetzl. Always a pleasure checking out their seasonal and one-offs. Kudos!"
"Will enjoy until I no longer can this year!"
"Body is on the light side, and mouthfeel is very clean, with just a slight bitterness throughout the mouth upon the swallow. Frost is a very, very drinkable lager, one I'd reach to in far warmer weather."
"It's also the first Dortmunder style beer I've ever had. It's quite a bit like a German style pilsener, though maybe a little breadier. I'm not sure about its authenticity, though. Either way, definitely worth a try for pilsener fans."
"My pour resulted in almost two fingers' worth of eggshell-white head with good retention. Color was a deep golden-yellow with NE-quality clarity. Nose had a good biscuity sweetness that made my mouth begin to water. Mouthfeel was medium, approaching full with an initial wash of a biscuity, malty flavor on the tongue. No doubt in my mind that of all of the Texas beers which I have had of late, this was the best (although that ain't sayin' much)! Finish had a slight hoppiness that did not overwhelm the sweetness that I noticed earlier, but instead acted as a nice compliment. I could easily drink another of these."
"First seasonal I've tried from Shiner so I poured this puppy into a 12 oz pint glass. It's light golden in color with has a completely transparent body. The head was light in color and dissipated quickly. The taste from the beer was a nice blend, kinda high on carbonation from what I could tell. I enjoyed the bite the beer had, it almost reminded me of an ipa. I thought it was a really good beer and more drinkable than most beers that shiner makes"
"Definitely sessionable."
"I wouldn't normally label this style of beer as being a Winter seasonal, but I'm pretty happy with it overall. I am a little disappointed to hear that it is replacing the Shiner Cheer, which was one of my favorite Shiner beers."
"Good stuff Shiner!"
"D: I think this is an all around solid lager. It has some nice clean aromas and flavors."
"Very easy to drink."
"Pours out a golden yellow with a nice thick white head. Good lacing down the glass. Smells of strong malts. The taste has alot of malt taste, and for the first time, actually tastes the way the back label on a shiner says. There is a sense of hops on the back end of the flavor. The mouthfeel is pretty good, not watered down like I've come to expect from other Shiner seasonals."
"Overall, a good beer from Shiner, much better than their other xmas seasonal effot (the xmas beer, ""cheer"" is absolutely awful in my opinion). I'd buy and drink this again."
"D - Smooth and easy drinking."
"P.S. Package design is the SHhhheeeeiii***!!!!"
"It's not going to give Great Lakes' Dortmunder a run for its money, but its a good beer ... and it's not like we can get Great Lakes in San Antonio anyway."
