"Drink this one cold: the lack of carbonation makes the drinking of this lager a bit disappointing, otherwise."
"Just not a very good beer here. But, you never know what you're going to get with something labeled ""Landbier," as it's not really a strict style. Give me the Mönchshof Kellerbier over this any day."
"Smell is OK, a bit of citron from the hops. Good and very drinkable for a landbier. I will enjoy every drop of this half liter."
"D: Easy to drink due to its lightness, but not really something I would want to drink a lot of. The weird, pilsner-on-steroids taste is offputting, as I expected more from something claiming to be a landbier."
"¡Salud!"
"Will drink it, but i know there is much better out there."
"Poured a huge, fluffy, bright-white head that faded slowly leaving scattered patches of lace. Transparent, glowing, golden beer holds a few streams of bubbles. Herbal and floral hops in the aroma along with a bit of faintly sweet pale malt. Herbal and grassy hop flavor combines with a light sweetness from the malts to create a hop tea flavor. It is accompanied by a mild bitterness that develops quite early on and pulls through to the finish. Moderately light body combines. A bit of fine carbonation props up an almost watery mouthfeel. An easy drinking biergarten brew."
"Pours light golden and effervescent with a thin foamy, mostly maintained white head. Aroma of malty grain, toasted malt, cracker crispy. Taste is sweet, malty, chewy, with undertones of bready lager yeast. Mouthfeel is between medium / full bodied with lively carbonation. Pretty good stuff."
"I expected more of this beer which claims to be a Landbier, but tastes more like a tweaked lager."
