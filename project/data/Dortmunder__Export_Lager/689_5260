There is hardly any diacetyl and the lager has a very mild sweetness as it finishes which is pleasant. I consider this pretty darn drinkable. I would pick up more if it were available in my area.","Slatetank","Beers"

The Glug producd a finger of foamy, rocky, bone-white head with reasonable retention. Color was a light lemon-yellow with NE-quality clarity. SRM = 3. Nose had a soft Saaz grassiness. Mouthfeel was medium-to-full with a pleasant grassiness on the tongue. I would have guessed German Pils were it not for the CAN's verbiage. Finish was semi-dry, grassy, very mild and pleasant.

Scent is a nice blend of caramel malts and noble hops giving it the authentic German Pilsner scent. The taste is comprised of soft mellow grains that compliment each other very nicely. It also has some hints of citrus and a slight spice as well that finishes nice and crisp. Quite a refreshing summer beer that isn't too heavy or too light.","Lemke10","Dec 29, 2011"

4,13.6,4,4,4,4,4,"Light amber in color with tons of carbonation bubbling up to the surface. Really nice and tight looking as white head of maybe an inch and a half came up and settled down, fading slightly but holding its own. Light grains and bready malt notes really pulling through here. Some smattering of hops in there but again nothing really pushing that way, this was a well rounded, and very straight forward lager. As I take the first sip, crisp, clean flavor rolls across the taste buds. Really very well put together. Earthy, nice touches of grain and smooth, mellow caramel notes infiltrate as it warms. Light banana and clove maybe then coming through. I am very pleased here as the light body and ample carbonation make for something that went down like water","mikesgroove","Jun 17, 2011"

Pours a medium pale golden, with a significant amount of foam that persists quite nicely, leaving about a 3/4 layer on top, and a nice amount of lacing. Decent aroma, with a prevalent maltiness, and apricot/hop notes in the background. Piney hoppy notes come to the fore upon tasting. Maltiness is a bit more understated than I would have liked for the style. Mouthfeel is good, with a welcome full-bodiedness, though I would have preferred a bit more carbonation. Overall, an enjoyable drink, if a bit hoppy for my ideal of the style.","bristol2120","May 17, 2011"

Very light inkling of noble hops, lending a hint of grassy astringency. Pairs great with spicy food, barbecue, just about anything. A solid session candidate as well. It's well made with no flaws, a good gateway craft lager for the novice craft drinker.

The nose comprises wheat, very light caramel, light walnut, and flowers. The taste holds notes of grass, light buttery biscuits, wheat, and walnut. The body is a hefty-ish light, with a light moderate carbonation and a fluid feel. Overall, a pretty nice Dort, nothing wild, but it's certainly easy-going enough.","TMoney2591","Nov 02, 2010"

4.16,18.2,3,4.5,4,4,4.5,"Very light head, hardly any foam, what's there is clear white, nada lacing. The slight gauze doesn't effect the overall transparency, straw yellow color, not that vivid, very few and randomly scattered bubbles, has the appearance of a beer gone flat. Pretzel dough, wheat bread in the nose, the peppery bite and hops give it lots of verve, softened by a light florality, the malts lack distinguishing qualities, some milk chocolate and hard butterscotch candy, solid apricot, peach scents without seeming fruity, overall well-integrated and easy to kick back and sniff. Medium-bodied, carbonation gives it a steady churn without getting in the way of smoother drinkability. The malted milk balls and chocolate ease the mouth entry, then orange to lemon citrus perks things up, greener straw and hay notes. Brings on some ginger, coriander notes too. Quieter tone to the pear, peach, apricot fruit, however, consistently there. Slight turn to bitterness through the finish, keeps it lively. Solid, crafted to be so rather than spectacular, a rarer and rarer thing. Could easily put a few down in one sitting.","farrago","Jul 12, 2010"
4.3,22.2,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Did I mention that I pretty much love the Two Brothers beers I've tried. This is the nicest easy going balanced summer session beer I've come across. Pours a bright golden hue with egg shell white head, forming nice speckled lacing with each sip. Aroma has light biscuit malts and herbal grassy/strong mineral water notes in the finish. A solid liquid bread type of beer, tastes clean and smooth with ample balance a crip hoppiness goes quite nicely with the semi sweet biscuit/cracker notes. A sight lemongrass herba tones in the finish. Mouthfeel is light bodied solidly carbonated with ample CO2, smooth going down I could have went for a whole six instead of a single. Great tasting brew that deserves be drunk in number during the Dog Days of Summer.","WVbeergeek","Jul 04, 2010"

Perhaps a touch grainy. The taste is light and somewhat grainy, there is a touch of honey sweetness and grassy hop bitterness. Has some hay like characteristics. The feel is moderate with active carbonation, the beer starts off sweet but finishes with a light bitter kick. A tad heavier than most lagers but drinks very well.

4.27,21.3,3.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Two Brothers is a brewery from the Chicago area that has made a splash here in New York City with its wide range of excellent renditions of many styles of beer, Ale and Lager alike. While this is far from the first of their beers, which range in style from Belgian Farmhouse Ales to this Dortmunder Style Lager, that I've tried, it struck me that Two Brothers has really outdone itself with this, arguably the most humble style it has tackled. Dortmunder style Lagers were amongst the first German Lagers to be consumed en masse in Europe -- a German take on the Czech Pilsen beer, the ""Export"" Lager version of this beer, at a slightly higher ABV than other varieties, caught on and eventually molded all Lagers from that point on. The Two Brothers version is a crisp and refreshing beer, with all kinds of subtle flavors going on -- spicy, sweet, citrusy, and more. Mostly though, this is one of the most drinkable and tasty beers that I've had in a long time in terms of sheer drinkability. The Dog Days beer is perfect for summer days, where you want your beer to have some real flavor, but you want to drink a lot, and you don't want to be praying for death the next morning. This has all of those qualities, and it pours a beautiful, perfectly carbonated golden color with a big white head and all the smells you could hope for in a beer. An excellent take on an under-investigated style and another winner for Two Brothers.","brewdogmrb","Jun 24, 2008"

It features light caramel and toasted malts with earthy-grassy, lightly spicy, noble hops in both smell and flavor. The mouthfeel is exceptionally smooth and oily creamy considering its relatively light body. It is a very well done dortmunder style lager.

3.95,12.2,4,4,4,3.5,4,"Aroma is fresh and malty. Some slight citrus hints in the background. The taste is very true to style. A good malty crisp light beer for a warm day. It has mostly malty elements with just the slightest hop finish. It is very smooth and easy to drink a few of these. I have now tried a few by Two Brothers and I think they are definitely a good up and coming craft brewery.","rousee","Aug 03, 2007"

3.76,6.8,4,3,4,4,4,"Served in a pilsner glass, the beer pours a light golden color with a very small white head. It smells like light citrus and floral hops, and also grainy/breadiness. The taste is mainly a malty breadiness with a light hoppy middle and aftertaste. The mouthfeel is light, but the beer is very smooth, crisp and refreshing. The drinkability is very good, I could probably down quite a few of these. I think this is a pretty decent beer. A great summer beer, but good for any other time of year as well.","bluejacket74","Aug 16, 2006"

Good lacing, though. Mild smell of hops. Taste begins with sweet, doughy malt and is quickly balanced with crisp hops. Very smooth and easy drinking. Great example of a summer beer and of the Dortmunder style, this would be a perfect beer to have with a burger or a brat.","thechaacster","Sep 07, 2004"

3.52,0,3,3.5,3.5,3,4,"Golden color, clearish, with a thin 1/4 inch head of decent duration. Laces are simple and spare in a pint glass. A fair bit of spicy hop aroma, some cinnamon and an earthy wet canvas maltiness that works better than it sounds (I occasionally use ""wet canvas"" to describe some pretty foul brews). Thin body, medium carbonation. Malt falls in the toasted range of bread and is reserved. Respectably balanced with a good late hop twang. A very good summer beer for drinkability and balance, but a little tame overall and lacking in memorable body.","ADR","Aug 03, 2003"

Nice appetizing aroma, fairly malty. The taste is very nice, Lightly malted, with more than a little taste of candy. The label says caramel, but thats not it, it was more like a faint taste of hard butterscotch candies. The finish is cleaned up nicely by a dusting of hops. As pone would expect from a summer brew, this is light and refreshing. Pick it up if you have the chance.","jackndan","Mar 06, 2003"
3.87,9.9,3.5,4,3.5,4,4.5,"It's pale golden in color and just a touch hazy. The aroma is mellow spicy hops and caramel malt. There's a very nice maltiness to this lager which surprised me. The spicy hops come through for a crisp and dry finish. This is a wonderful refresher. It's not complicated in flavor but it doesn't have to be. It's not as watery as most lagers and the carbonation is perfect. It went up to 87 degrees today and this six pack came in handy.","AudioGilz","Aug 14, 2002"

And did I mention the lingering bitterness that is quite lovely also.  The body of this beer is medium at least.  Good healthy body for a lager.  It finishes a bit dry, but nicely.  This is my kind of lager.  Very nicely done.  Refreshing and smooth.","Bighuge","0"
