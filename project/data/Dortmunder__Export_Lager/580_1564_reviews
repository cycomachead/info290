"500ml bottle. Bottle labelled as Amber Pils (and also as ""bitter aromatic""). Pours a straw colour with a towering, frothy white head which settled reasonably and left only a trace of lacing. Very gentle aroma malt, hay and hops. Light sweetness and bitterness. Light to medium body with some fizz. Long gently bitter finish. Someone should have a word to their marketers because this doesn't fit the Pils mould nor is it particularly bitter or aromatic. That said it's very light, inoffensive but still quite drinkable."

"Pours clear golden with decent white head, good retention, some laces. Smell of grain, dough, slightly herbal, slightly metallic. Taste is unbalanced, skunky, grain, mineral, chalk, cardboard, undefined bitterness. Sounds too artificial and inessential."

"O - Drinkablility is real good. but flavor level is pretty low. American beer flavor has far surpassed the Polish version."

"500 ml. bottle, pours a clear golden colour, with a small white head that fades soon. No lace. Smell of grains and flowers with some malty notes. Light carbonation, light body. Taste is the same as smell: grains, flowers and some biscuit. Just another correct beer more."

"Flavors of toasty puffed wheat, clean grains, dry subtle noble hop bitterness. Very clean and simple, but flavorful and unique at the same time. No flaws or off flavors. Dry aftertaste, not sweet. Extremely drinkable, light bodied and smooth. Something from the Polish lager category that seems to transcend a little bit, which is surprising."
"Overall: a straight middle-of-the-road Dortmunder. A bit on the grainy side, but balanced and quite drinkable."
"This beer was ""accidentally"" opened at work today, so I figured I'd partake in its contents for the sake of it. It pours a clear pale straw topped by a finger or so of white foam. The nose comprises light wheat, hard water, light grass, and flowers. Everything is mild and muddled (in an inoffensive way). The taste brings in more of the same, with the grass and flowers coming through a bit more powerfully, though not enough to really help this beer claw its way out of mediocrity. The body is light, with a light moderate carbonation and a watery feel. Overall, a nice little beer, better than I expected (thanks to some bad experiences with pale Polish lagers), but nothing at all memorable."

"O: All-in-all one of the better Polish standards I've had. Apart from a light body, some sweetness and a bit high ABV, this is a nice, malty and grassy lager, good for warm summer days - or with lighter foods."
"Picked up a bottle at EuroMarket in Astoria. Aside from the bit of skunk, this is a decent beer. Shame about the green glass bottle. There's a crisp bready toast with just a touch of caramel. Slight spicy hops finish the beer is what seems to be a fine, but abused, example of the style. I hope to find a fresher find some day."
"D: A nice export lager, with the green bottle I wasn't expecting as much, but a solid beer."
"A refreshing brew that is easy to drink."
"This is a fine beer for washing down the brats and sourkraut."
"Flavors are simple candi sugar, banana, Belgian fruit and cooked stone fruits. Pleasant, but almost sweet and somewhat one dimensional without a lot of character. Pleasant but simple."
"Mouthfeel / Drinkability: The body of the beer is light and fizzy. This is a straight up throw back beer without alot going on. Not a drain pour but not exciting."
"This is fairly agreeable in flavor with a little malt and a tiny bit of hops and an overall grainy, almost vegetative quality to the malt. However, it is inoffensive and slightly watery, and the finish is crisp and somewhat bitter. More or less what I expected, although not altogether terrible. This is comparable to most of Poland's top lagers and better than a few, not that there aren't higher compliments I could give a beer."
"Good and refreshing. Though I'd love to get a fresh sample of this without the skunky aroma."
"D: Overall a bland and boring entry, a beer you wouldn't feel guilty dumping after sampling half a glass."
"Pours a clear straw gold with a fast falling white head. Nose is like dirty grain. Flavor exhibits much the same qualities. Just a bland and boring lager. Feel has very little bubble on the tongue and a very thin liquid feel. Average drinkability at best."
"A bit different than the typical German pilsners, but absolutely a very good beer."
"Pale golden yellow appearance with a nice white head when poured carefully out of the half liter bottle. Crystal clear. Rich malty aroma accompanied with a musty, flowery hopiness. Eastern European feel to it. Quite tasty in a heartier lager sense. Malt sweetness abounds in this lager, lingering hoppiness in the finish. I could enjoy this one again."
"Nothing quenches the thirst like a fine Polish lager, and the Lomza Export is certainly no expection. This beer pours a pale yellow with a F-4 Maelstrom of carbonation (common to many polish lagers). Smell is sweet and malty and the taste is very similar. I like diversification, but I do lean towards sweeter beers and this one appeals to me more, probably, because of its underlying sweetness. This beer went perfectly with my melted mozarella topped soft pretzel and home made beer cheese. HEAVEN!"
"On the pour a translucent golden amber color with a pretentious head, and nice covering lace. Light hints of yeast, but malt dominates the nose, crisp and clean, pleasant. A bit over sweet at the start with the top shamefully thin and the finish scantily hopped with a middling carbonation and the ever present dry and lingering aftertaste, just to Thin-waisted for me, but still a drinkable beer when you want something light."
"From Lomza Brewery in Poland. Pale gold. Medium light body. Mild bitterness. Mild hops. Medium malt. Dry. Reminicsent of grains, fresh fruits. Rounded and pleasantly refreshing and tasty. Not bad 5.7% ABV. Nice label of polish villagers in costumes."
"Pours a crystal clear golden body capped by a foamy bright white head that holds fairly well; dropping to a creamy collar that's buoyed by carbonation. The nose expresses clean, sweet, grainy malt with a mild floral hoppiness in the background. The body is light/medium with a fine and gently effervescent carbonation. It's lightly crisp on the tongue at first, becoming smooth and creamy in the mouth as it warms. Very nice! The flavor reaffirms the malty sweetness suggested by the aroma, but also shows more complexity. It's very well balanced by a spicy and gently citrusy (lemon, lime) hop flavor and bitterness. It finishes dry with some residual grainy/grassy malt sweetness, mild peppery hoppiness, and a touch of alcohol (which is surprising for a beer of only 5.7%). A really surprisingly good pilsener! Quite refreshing, delicate, and interesting. Certainly worth trying!"
"Export Lomza:  In a funky little bottle.  Pale golden colored beer, with a foamy, pure white head.  Clean, grainy aroma.  Very light in body and in taste, with adjuncty flavor, of grain, and the barest hint of malt.  Clean, dry finish.  Not too bad, hella easy to drink, but there’s lots better out there."
"Not bad at all, but there is alot of other good brews from Poland."
"I was lucky enough to pick up a couple of bottles of this, and while expecting an average Euro Pils, I was very surprised...I could actually taste fresh hop bitterness! Must of been right off the boat...very tasty, one of the best I have tried. Sad to say I haven't seen it since (Feb. 2001) Reccomended!"
"Notes: A very good export lager. Potent with many malt liquor qualities."
