"O - wv isn't the beer Mecca of the world so it still was drinkable after driving 5 hrs."
"I have had this on tap several times at various locations around WV. The first time I nearly returned it to the bar. It was so incredibly buttery that I could barely finish it. It felt as if I was drinking melted butter with a slight hop presence. I gave it another try about 6 months later because I do want to see this brewery succeed due to the fact that it's from my home state. However, not much has changed with this brew. I think they might have fixed the previous recipe somewhat, but the butter notes are just out of control in this. The hops are abnormally high for a lager and the aroma isn't exactly pleasant. I usually write fairly detailed notes for the beers I try, but there honestly isn't much to write home about this. What is truly sad about this is that I LOVE their other beers. They just simply missed with this brew."
