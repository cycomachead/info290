"   I'll give Barnburner Lager - Lagerheads Smokehouse & Brewing Co. an overall 3.25. I probably will never buy this beer again."

"Overall it's a pretty good beer but it seems like a home brew take on a Altbier but that's kind of far from the labeled style so minus points."
"So is this lager supposed to be amber/brown? Interesting beer, but oddly malty with a touch of hop influence. Feel is smooth. An easy drinker, but frankly, this strikes me mostly as an odd homebrew as opposed to a finely executed version of the style."
"Mouthfeel: Medium-light bodied with a rather sweet finish good beer but no where it should be."

"This had the makings of a great dortmunder. A great local brewery, nice color, and a cool label. In the end, though it's pretty average. The aroma is lacking - it is inoffensive, but not where it should be. The taste is somewhat hoppy but not nearly as malty as it could be. The aftertaste is very good. Due to all the above, it is a reasonably good experience and I woulc never refuse one of these, but I don't intend to buy it again."
"Pours golden orange copper body with a bright off white head, forming thick and flowing fast with carbonation. Aroma smells horrible like sick grain gone horribly wrong, I can't even explain the offness I'm smelling in the nose. Flavor tastes like garlic, garbage, regurgitated throwup, a bit of corn meal, off graininess, no hops. This beer sucks asshole, and I can't evenly say that with any sort of finesse. Officially the worst beer I've ever tried in the state of Ohio, no aging notes written on the bottle. Mouthfeel is horrible, I can't stomach another sip of this beer completely horrible gut wrenching beer from Medina Ohio. Never by these beers if they taste like this,l I guess I will try this beer again only to see if it's actually this bad."
"O: As others have said, pretty average but certainly a nice beer to sit & sip & not think too hard about."
"Pours a straw yellow with a chill haze. Silky head forms and recedes away. Aromas of lager yeast, fruit, mild herbal hop and some alcohol. In the taste, sweet grains, faint bitterness, and buttery biscuit. Some alcohol comes through, and in the finish, a distinct lagery yeast trait with some buttery diacetyl. Drinks like a very big lager. Medium bodied, slick feel with decent carbonation but not quite crisp. Overall, not a bad effort, a pretty decent export lager, but could use some cleaning up."

"Picked up a bomber of this at the local beer shop. I've been wanting to try some of Lagerheads stuff for a while. Pours a dark straw color with a light white head. Head went away pretty quickly but would leave a little lacing at every sip. More malt centered than anything with notes of caramel in the background. It was a little too sweet for my tastes and that made the bomber a little tough to finish but overall not a bad brew."
"M: The lager's softness doesn't seem like an assertive export lager. An okay drinker though, the sweetness growing on me with each sip."
"Overall, an average brew at best. It is not bad, but there's nothing about it to make me stand up and take notice. Nonetheless, I want to support the local brewery, and will definitely give their other offerings a try as I find them."
"D- decent at best, there's too many little flaws that (i assume) could be easily fixed for this to be a winner. but hell i love supporting local breweries nonetheless. goes down easier at 3am after a hard night."
