"Overall and interesting take on a lager, but can't say I'd be repeating this in the future."

"Not overwhelming hop flavor, I enjoyed the floral notes and subtle smell and taste of caramel or honey. Great beer, definitely one of my favorite 3 floyds brews."
"Really solid beer...beats drinking Stella any day"

"the thing that really surprised me about this one was the mouthfeel. its another pils sure, a sacrificial offering from every brewery that needs to have a mass appeal beer, or at least one within basic style conventions. this is better than that though, creamy and dry at the same time, and well hoppy for what it is, not neatly american or german or czech, but rather a stylistic cuvee of all three, which might be yet to be done until this beer. i get grassy saaz type hop notes, but also german pils malt and a real basic and clean american lager yeast. its familiar but about as challenging as the style can be. highly carbonated and real refreshing, but something different. i always expect the world from three floyds, given the hype and the rarity, and while this falls short of i think the expectations i had, i still think its a heck of a pils, and one that should be treated as a one of a kind. well made and not deviating real far from what these guys do well."

"Overall: a unique version of a hopped up dortmunder. not usually a fan of the grassy and musty hop character but this one works well with it."

"This is a clean, crisp and refreshing lager, with good hop bite."

"Light lager appearance but it is tricky because the strong hops smell and taste make it almost American Pale like.  It is a nice complex larger if you like the flavor of an IPA with the harsher bitters.  This is my favorite fridge beer (when I can find it)."
""
""
""
"left something to be desired"
""

"Decent lager with a smooth mouth feel, slight hops with a biscuity malt/yeast taste."

"Pours a clear, copper color. 1/3 inch head of a white color. Great retention and great lacing. Smells of pale malt, sweet malt, slight hops, and slight yeast. Fits the style of a Dortmunder / Export Lager. Mouth feel is smooth and clean, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of pale malt, sweet malt, hint of wheat, slight hops, slight biscuit, and slight yeast. Overall, good appearance, aroma, body, and blend. One of the better Dortmunders I've ever had."
""
""
"After the thoroughly disappointing Dissenter, this was a pleasant surprise. I really was just planning to take a sip and dump this, clearing up some room in the fridge, but darn it, I drank the whole thing and enjoyed it. I gotta say, this is honestly one of the best lagers I've had."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Very refreshing beer. A simple enjoyable lager."
""
""
"Slightly hazy with orange hue. Tasty for a lager with a bit of biscuit taste. Hoppy for a lager with that slightly skunky finish. Can taste the alcohol as well, however it all comes together fairly well. My least favorite of three Floyd's which is a phenomenal brewery."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Purchased a six pack from the brewery. Pours a straw/yellow color, and lots of bubbles can be seen rushing to the surface. The head is short (especially for a 3 Floyds beer). The nose consists of bread, grain, and a touch of fruit, and there's a bit of skunk in there too. The taste begins rather sweet with pronounced grain but finishes heavy on the bread/biscuit flavors. This beer is quite crisp and easy to drink. As I haven't had more than a couple Dortmunder beers, I can't say whether this is really remarkable, but it is refreshing. While I tried it solely because it's a 3 Floyds beer, it's not one that I would seek out again, probably just because I'm not that interested in the style."

"O: A refreshing pils with a clean hop character that I love about this style. The price tag is a bit much for JP, but if you can find it on draft somewhere you maybe better off as this has a relativity short shelf life being such a delicate beer. Nice beer overall"

"Golden hued with a tightly knit half inch off white head. Brussels lacing. Aroma of light bready grains and Dortmunder yeast is present. The flavor is packed with sourdough bready grains and gentle lager yeast. The mouth is fairly dry,quaffable,and crisp."

"As FFF is my favorite brewery, I feel obliged to review their lager, Jinx Proof. It pours a light gold color with about a finger of white head. Pronounced hops for a lager, but this is a FFF signature. Good mouthfeel but a bitter finish. An easy drinker for a hot day, not the best, not the worst."

"Taste is very much akin to a traditional lager, with a dialed-up citrus hops tone. Very flavorful, while remaining true to the lager style. Well tasty and worthy of repeat purchase."
""
""
""
"O. This is a very very very good Dortmunder. A little too sweet and tropical for the style, but very enjoyable nonetheless. Provides a flavorful experience and satisfying dry finish while still being reasonably light on its feet. If you're someone who appreciates the lager side of the beer spectrum, this should be on your wish list. One of the better American Dortmunders out there."

"O - This is a reasonably good version of a very common style in the mainstream market. I am not a huge fan of the style, which factors, I suppose. But I wish this had more depth. Drinkable, but not particularly memorable."

"A nice thirst-quenching lager with a great flavor profile. Very impressive and quite good."

"Bottle from Rebekah. Thanks! Pours into my tulip a hazy light golden color. Half finger head, white and fluffy, but recedes quickly. Aroma of hay, sweet malt and honey, maybe some light fruits like apples and pears. Flavor is light straw, a little dirty lager flavor, them a nice burst of sweet fruit and honey-like malts. The flavor is very light and a sweetness remains on the palate. Light bodied, medium carbonation. Nothing super exciting but a solid pilsener overall that is pretty drinkable. This improves as it warms a little and some papaya and passion fruit comes out that is nice."
""
""
"I have wanted to try this and was surprised to find a lone six pack at one the liquor barns in Louisville, KY. The sweet and balanced flavor is typical of a ""Dortmunder"" style but it takes a back seat to Great Lakes' Dortmunder."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This pours a semi-hazy golden yellow color with a slight white head. The aroma is filled with earth tones and grains that you expect from a pilsner. The taste is very strong with a very dry grain tone. This has a lot more dry hops than you would which is why I could this beer would turn some people away."
""
""
"O - Its a good pale lager, kinda simple and to the point, but refreshing and lightly hopped for good effect."

"Overall, this is a solid lager that is smooth and easy drinkin'. Definitely worth a shot."
""
""
"This is a good lager. I'd feel better about it if it came in $2.00 cheaper for the 6, ""it was in the area of $11.99", I dont remember exactly cause Im more worried about taste and dates. By the 2nd one I might rate it higher but im going to stick with first impressions. A solid Lager, but never again for that money."
""
""
"Overall - Not a bad beer at all. A little different flavor for the style but still is a malt forward drink. Packs a punch for being under 6%, yet is still crisp and easy to enjoy."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Much like the aroma the taste starts off all citrus. Orange and grapefruit are at the forefront, but again the bready malt comes thru and transforms this into more of lager. It finishes rather dry and bitter and the bitterness hangs on for awhile. This is a session beer if I've ever seen one. Small ABV, light mouthfeel, and very nice thirst quenching ability. This beer doesn't really fit the style it's suppose to fit into, but I think its a great beer by itself. Price could use a little work, being that it doesn't have the same heft that their other $10.99 6packs have. This was much better than I expected."

"The beer pours a nice, golden yellow with orang highlights. It pours with a little head of tight, eggshell white bubbles that, unfortunately, fizzle away quickly… I’m not sure if it’s my glass or the beer. The beer’s body is clean but a little hazy, it muddles sights on the other side of the glass. On the nose, this beer expresses its Noble hops as soon as the cap pops, with big herbal spiciness. As I put my nose in it, the beer smells clean, crisp, and a little like apple skins, which is scent I get a lot in pilsners. The malts are nice and crackery, giving light sweetness to the scent while the hops give bursts of lemongrass and spice to the nose. On the tongue, the beer tastes nicely balanced between bitter and sweet. This is definitely one of the bitterest pilsners I have tried, but the malty sweetness stands right up beside of this and the acidity is lightly tart, which makes this a very nice beer to sip. Right as the beer passes down the throat, the sweetness gets a touch too much, but other than that the beer has some great balance. The beer feels on the light side of medium in body with a nice, clean crisp mouthfeel, like most pilsners. There is a little more malt weight on the tongue than you usually find in the style. In taste, the beer begins surprisingly fruity as light lemongrass and sweet cracker, but the bitters thread beautifully into this with grassy and herbal characters, and the malt dries out a bit on the mid-palate, providing a dry-cracker flavor before dipping slightly towards sweet apple juice with a touch of wheat malt. The finish is light as sweet apple juice, mellow grassy hops, and light cracker malts. The aftertaste is clean and slight. Overall, this is a nice pilsner, and one I prefer to many others in the style. It is a little too sweet in places, but the extra malt gives some nice character to the beer. This is a nice twist on a classic style, and a good intro to Three Floyds for me. If you can get it regularly, I would advise this beer for a session, but I wouldn’t go whale-hunting for this one."

"O - Definitely strong for what it is, not my favorite style but enough flavor here to keep it interesting and enjoyable."

"O - This beer started out good. Then that aftertaste got me. That is all I can think of when it comes to this beer now. It reminds me of a Euro lager."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

""

"More of a classic representation of the style. Not much of a 3Floyds' twist on this one, but a quality brew just the same."
""
""
""
""
""
"This beer is awesome. It's a meat and potatoes kind of beer. This is doesn't exactly remind me of a pilsener or a Dortmunder/Export, but I don't hold that against this beauty. It's a very unique lager. Oddly enough, it kind of reminded me of an Irish Red Ale. Well crafted and extremely enjoyable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a clean orange-ish to yellow color with a white head. In the aroma, roasty, earthy, and lagery. In the taste, a roasty nuttiness, and still quite lager like. A hop bite and a lighter bodied mouthfeel, with a dryer roasty lager like aftertaste. A touch nutty, and roasty, and hoppy, quite a nice lager."
""
""
""
""
""
"If all lagers tasted like this, I'd drink them more often. This is good. It's easy to drink, has little ABV so you can drink them all day long while you're at the baseball game. Smooth, easy drinker."
""
"On the other hand, aren't Dortmunder export lagers meant to be pretty light like this one is? A premiere ""lawnmower"" beer in many ways, this would also do the trick on a warm day out. Aside from the initial over-skunked flavor, as well as a bit of syrupiness, this isn't horrible. Only slightly above average for the Floyds. I finished it with no problem, but there are plenty of American made pilsners that I would much sooner return to."
"Overall: A really solid lager. Does not pop off the charts in any areas but is refreshing brew that is certainly worth a try."

"The body is definitely medium, more as the appearance would suggest than one would expect from a Dortmunder. It's a bit creamy and quite smooth, with crispness off the bat that stays the entire way."

"This is a nice lager from Three Floyds. The citrusy character and hints of orange peel really made this a treat. Lagers tend to be oversimplified, but the citrus here set this one apart from other dortmunders that I have had. This is really an enjoyable, lighter offering that is definitely worth a try."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Taste-Pale/toasted malt, nice floral hop note, subtle citrus rind. Good flavor and character for a lager, drinks and tastes like a pale ale, with a nice dose of noble hops. A crowd-pleasing, backyard brew."
""
""
""
"Transparent golden reddish in color with a decent lingering head. Really subdued nose. A little sweet smelling but nothing about the glover is betrayed. Light crisp mouthfeel highly carbonated. There is a Clapton of flavor In this beer. Has that classic smooth pilsner taste but finishes with an assertive hop presence. Honestly it tastes like a slightly better noble pils by Sam Adams. Overall refreshing, tasty drinkable session beer perfect for a warm weather tailgate."

"This would make for a great summer beer, but it's not the most complex or best beer in the world. There is some bitterness, but it's very clean and refreshing beer to drink. A very good representation for this style."

"12 ounce bottle. Served in a pilsener glass, the beer pours a hazy orange/amber color with about a half inch off-white head that didn't stay around for too long. Not much lacing, either. Aroma is mostly bready and caramel malt, and also light some floral hops and nuts. Taste is pretty much just like the aroma, but there wasn't as much hoppiness as I expected for a Three Floyds brew. With that being said, it's still tasty. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit slick and easy enough to drink. Not sure if I'd pay $10.99 a 6-pack for this again, but it's a good brew and I'm glad I got to try it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Very crisp, very refreshing, the taste is light and easy. Some caramel, malt, and cereal grains its easy but simply too light."
""
"Good malt character, albeit somewhat overly toasted. Darker than expected. The fruity character was unexpected and offputting. I had this on tap a while back and remember it being much lighter in color..."
""
""
"C+"

"Overall Drinkability: An interesting lager that has a few ale qualities."

"O- This is not my favorite style of beer but I could definitely drink this all day long. I have never had a beer by Three Floyd's that I didn't like and this one was no exception."
""
"Pilsners are not my favorite style and I do not seek them out, but I found this one to be quite enjoyable. Neither the malt nor the hops are ever lost in this beer. Both are evident and noticeable. A well-crafted pilsner that should appeal to fans of the style."

"O - Flavorful and easy to drink but the harmony was a bit off for me."
""

"Big thanks goes out to beeruser for sharing this one! Served from bottle into a Boulevard Smokestack tulip. Poured golden yellow with a white half finger head that subsided to a minimal amount quickly. Maintained nice lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, floral, floral hop, and fruit. The flavor was of sweet malt, floral, fruit, and earth. It had a light feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was a pretty decent brew. This one carried a big floral character to it throughout both the aroma and flavor. The touch of fruit on this one was a very nice addition to the floral characteristic. Worth trying if you get the opportunity for sure."
""
"Clear golden yellow, white head with moderate retention and a bit of lace. Nose has some grain, a bit of veggie, light sweet malts and mild hopping. Moderate sweeteness on the palate, grains and cereals as well. Light hopping still, perhaps with a hint of citrus. Light body, medium low carbonation. Gentle bitterness. A solid flavourful dortmunder, quite drinkable."
""
""
"Overall this is a decent beer, but I don't love it. There's nothing spectacular about it and the flavors aren't that well-rounded. The cleanness and crispness that could be present in the body are muddled by vegetal tasting hops that provide more than bitterness. Would drink again, but won't seek out."
"Average smell for a dortmunder/pilsener/lager...european yeast, decent smell. The look in this is above average, nice golden color with nice head and decent lacing. The first couple I have had of this were a little off...by the time I got through the six pack in day three I has to review..it had changed, for the better! The taste on this was much better than the smell for sure...one hg ny favorite dorts for sure..at first I regretted my purchase, but after a few I was hooked. I live nearly three hours from the brewery but would drive back up for this for sure..nice job changing up the pace Three Floyds...one of my favorite lagers."
""

"12 oz bottle poured into a pint glass. Pours a straw yellow with a 2 finger white head that shrinks to cover the top. Minimal lacing. Aroma is bready, slightly grassy, and earthy. Taste is more bread, earth, and a grassy bitterness with mild citrus in the back. Caramel and toffee are somewhat present. Thin mouthfeel with a lingering flavor. Good pils."
"Three Floyds Jinx Proof pours a hazy light orange, with almost three fingers of cream colored foam. There's a little bit of head retention, with not much lacing left to speak of. The nose has lots of bready malts, and a fair bit of minerals and herbal hops. The flavor largely follows that blueprint. The cracker and bread maltiness that leads off is a bit more crisp than in the aroma. The bitterness that rolls in mid palate is pleasantly mild, with just enough snap to briefly grab my attention. The finish is largely herbal, with just a little bit of a mineral edge. The beer manages to avoid harsh grassy flavors that I sometimes get from German style lagers with a noticeable hop presence. The body has a nice firmness to it, but the carbonation essentially dies off by the middle of each sip, rendering the beer a bit dull. I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed Jinx Proof, as it comes from a style of beers I'm not typically fond of."

"O: Very well done for the style."
"O- This is a good refreshing brew with a light taste and feel to go good with any occasion and is drinkable by just about anybody."
""
""
""
""
""
"D - Very drinkable. Very nice example of a Dortmunder with some nice noble hops. Really smooth and very sessionable."
"Pours a cloudy gold with a finger and a half of head which quickly dissipates into a thin ring which persists throughout. Smell is of light, sweet malts with a little bit of spicy breadiness and a touch of pear, almost like a wheat beer. There is a large hop bitterness not evident in the nose, pushing the malt profile to the back of the palate. With no hop on the nose, I find the bitterness more detrimental than anything to my enjoyment of the beer. This is a bit more aggressively hoppy than I like my lagers, which seems to be par for the course from FFF."
"Our Three Floyds Brewpub Experience continues with this offering. It pours a lightly hazy straw topped by a finger of white micro-foam. The nose comprises wheat, light rice (I know, I know, how much lighter can rice get, right?), and some very light bits of lemon zest and coriander. The taste holds notes of wheat, flowers, and light greens. The hop character is decidedly subdued. The body is a sturdy light, with a light moderate carbonation and a crisp, dry finish. Overall, a solid Dort, though nothin' entirely special."
"Hoppy citric goodness with toasty biscuits, bread crust. Fluffy and resiny palate. Hard to belive its a lager. But tastes and feels pretty good."

"Not my style of beer. Thus not highly rated. unless you know and likethis style I would spend my money on any other 3 Floyd offering as all others are spectacular! I am a hophead so Zombie/Arctic/Dreadnaught even Gumball or better options for me! Even the A Cow is not bad!"
"Overall nice, more of a spring beer, nice pilsner like qualities, malts, nice hops and bitterness, light crisp and very drinkable. The best lager from FFF so far."

""
"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass. Pours a nice straw color with a good head. Smell was nice and clean, sort of a lager scent. Nice hops bitterness, not IPA like overpowering, but noticeable. Good mouthfeel. Overall, very good beer, I would drink a lot of this if it was available easily near me."

"A great lager option that I'd turn to in the Summer if it were available to me year-round."
"I really am getting into this beer, i know it's a week fresh, picked it up delivery day, and it's really tasty. It really hits that noble hop spot when it is itching, and i will be buying packs of this often."
"O - a very good lager. hop forward but done well."
"O: I really, really dug this beer. This could make for some epic sessioning, it's easy drinking and damn tasty. If you're like me (a closet session lager fanatic), seek this one out, and with haste."

"Jinx-proof pours a bright orange color with a thin off white head that quickly disappears. Decent lacing on the side of my snifter glass. Fairly hazy in appearance as well- you can't see through this brew. The nose is grain, sugar, grass, and slight hops. Maybe a little fruit in there as well. Very sweet smelling. The taste follows suit, although a little more balanced. Add biscuits and wheat in addition to the nose. Feel is light, and slighly thin, but decent carbonation and a hoppy aftertaste. Overall, a good lager that deserves a shot. I enjoyed it. Cheers."

"o - Overall a decent lager, though nothinng mind blowing. Very crisp and easy to drink. The nose doesn't have a ton going on other than some grain and biscuit, but the taste is a little better with the fruit/citrus hops. Worth checking out once, but wouldn't break your back seeking it out."
"Pours a clear golden-yellow color with a big white head and a good bit of lacing on the way down. The nose brings some faint floral and herbal hops plus plenty of grainy malt. Flavor is grainy with a moderate bitterness through the finish. Light, crisp body. Solid, but not great."
""
""
"Overall : I really enjoyed this beer and will pick it up when I have the chance. Great example of the style worth seeking out."

"O: FFF is not just hop bombs and Dark Lord, and to my mind, with brews like this one, they.ve proven that they are also masters of nuance. Really nice fellas...."

"Overall: The aroma didn't transfer over to the taste very well. The taste didn't seemed as balanced as the aroma. Still a decent brew it just disappointed me when I took my first drink. Going to drink it FRESH next time. Cheers!"

"O- Although not quite at the session beer range, a great lager you can have a couple of and not feel too bad. Not quite as good at Dortmunder Gold, but in the same ballpark."
"O: this is a nicely constructed lager, the malts are well pronounced without going overboard."
"Had on tap at the UChicago pub. Hazy straw with a small white head but lots of lacing--could use more carbonation. Smells bready but with a distinct sweet and mineral sharpness, and the taste is one of the strongest lagers I've ever had. Very malty, with nut and wheat tastes, but with lovely sharp citric hops and a crisp grassy finish. I wish there was more carbonation--it's sweet with a medium body, very nice drinker. Would get again in a lager mood."
"D - One of the better lagers I've had; easy to drink and enjoy; could replace the cheap crap beers I've had while watching the game; I like 3 Floyd's lager-venture, long-time waiting"
"Overall: A beer to show the macro lager drinkers what they should be drinking"
"This pours a golden color with good carbonation and bubbly, white head that doesn't last. Smells of biscuit and grains. Has the musky smell traditional to lagers. Not overpowering smell but enjoyable. Taste of breads, grains, and some fruit. Good tasting. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and very well carbonated. Overall a very good lager. Easy drinking."
"A good, incredibly drinkable, Dortmunder lager. This would be great outdoors at a ballgame on a hot day."
"Overall: a VERY drinkable lager with a nice FFF hoppy twist. I recommend this one for both lager and ale lovers alike. Wish it were more readily available. I'd order it pretty regularly!"
"Overall this reminds you of the time when you were a kid and tasted dads beer. Its so very traditional but... more. This may be one of the most impressive releases quite simply due to their back to the roots approach with Jinx Proof."
"D - A very traditional lager from Three Floyds - easy to drink, but not particularly exciting. I'm glad this is in 12oz bottles, as 22oz would get boring pretty quickly. Still, quite easy to drink and well-executed."
"O- Eh, decent beer. Probably not going to get it again but still glad I got to try it"
"O - Enjoyed this beer a good deal and could session it regularly."
"O - Just a normal session beer. Light and easy to drink."
"Pleasantly bitter and understated, crisp and clean with a bit of bready sweetness upfront that fades quickly under a wave of noble hop bitterness. Nice crispness to the light bodied lager, something you could easily have several of. Lingering grassiness and vague biscuit flavors. Again, a super clean and drinkable session lager, traditional to the hilt... it's not an IPA, just in case you were wondering."
"O: Jinx Proof showcases the most important qualities in a Dortmunder Export: balance, crispness and drinkability. "
"O- Very easy to drink and I wish I had some more of this one."
"A very nice semi chill hazed bright golden hue with a fine layer of white head, sampled first at a local BA gathering. Aromatics some mild citrus notes, but a really nice bready cereal grain note that was really inviting in the warm weather. Not crazy complex big or bitter just a nice Dortmunder style, fairly different compared to the standard I judge all other export style lagers to, Great Lakes Dortmunder Gold. But this was well made clean crisp with a great toasted breadiness, amongs the herbal citric hop additions, made to style and it shows why 3Fs is successful not just because of their big beers, but they actually know how to brew. Mouthfeel was lighter bodied ample carbonation for style flows nicely, I'm wishing I had access to a couple bombers of this or any 3Fs for that matter. Overall experience was a great way to start things out highly quaffable refreshing and goes to show not every great beer has to be on everybody's White Whale list."
"Overall: I didn't feel like there was anything special about this beer. I enjoyed the bitter finish, but otherwise a bit boring to be hones. FFF gets a pass due to the fact that I've loved almost everything else I have tried from them."
"O - Nice lager."
"Comes to me a cloudy golden with little white head that leaves clingy lacing.  Smells slightly grainy, with malts.  Tastes a touch grainy with some light citrus, and a slightly bitter hop finish.  Mouthfeel is medium, drinkability is extremely high. Not one of my favorite styles, not a very challenging beer but a good solid drinker, could defitinely see drinking a lot of it in the summer time."
"Poured from bomber (no date stamp) into dimpled mug. Pours a yellow-golden colored body mostly clear, but with a slight haze. Finger-width, fizzy, white head that dissipates quickly and leaves a light lacing throughout the session. Aroma is a lightly sweetened grainy, pils malt with a light herbal hop backing. Flavor is a richer grainy malt with a medium sweetness. A touch of bread and honey as well as a light fruit come in during the middle before this finishes with a light to moderate level of herbal, grassy bitterness and a pinch of spice. Dry and crisp with a somewhat flat lingering aftertaste which was disappointing to me especially coming from 3F. Medium body, smooth, and a soft carbonation. Overall, this tasted like a regular macro pils. Its straightforward brew that provides a crisp and hop bitterness. Definitely an unusual release from FFF, but it proves to me that they're not just all about the juicy hop and malty bombs. Good point there."
"I was really stoked to try this and when I did I was really bummed. I couldn't believe how generic this turned out to be. I tried telling myself that there must be something that will pop up in the after taste but there wasn't. I never expected this from 3 Floyds. This beer was yellow, clear, and not very flavorful."
"The mouthfeel feels like it's on the heavier side for the style, but still pretty light overall. Carbonation also feels a little low for the style, but above average overall. Overall it was a pretty good beer for the style. It was crisp, clean and easy to drink. Pretty good beer overall for the style."
"D- This is the 1st 3 floyds beer i have not liked. I would of rather been drinking a Crisp Budweiser then this. Just tasted like a watered down amercan lager. Not much flavor or much of anything going on."
"D: Can become a bit cloying, but still quite high."
"Jinx Proof is an easy drinking lager beer with a slighly more robust malt flavor and body, followed by a bit more hop bite than is expected for the style (starts to play into German Lager territory). The lemony-grassy hop notes in finish is a nice reprieve."
"CHEERS!!"
"This beer was interesting, it was described to me as a pilsner, but here it says a Dortmunder. It was probably a combination of the 2 in hindsight. This beer pours a nice golden color with a decent white head on it. The smell was not particularly strong in any regard. All I was able to grasp was some light sweet malt notes on the nose, but really there wasn't much there. The flavor was a quality mixture of lots of pilsner malt and some bready biscuit malt. It was a nice mug of liquid bread that I had the opportunity to taste, that the way I look at this beer. The mouthfeel was oddly flatter than I would have anticipated due to the lightness of this beer. It was good and drinkable."
"Our Three Floyds Brewpub Experience continues with this offering. It pours a lightly hazy straw topped by a finger of white micro-foam. The nose comprises wheat, light rice (I know, I know, how much lighter can rice get, right?), and some very light bits of lemon zest and coriander. The taste holds notes of wheat, flowers, and light greens. The hop character is decidedly subdued. The body is a sturdy light, with a light moderate carbonation and a crisp, dry finish. Overall, a solid Dort, though nothin' entirely special."
"D - This was a tough one for me, mainly because I really don't care for the style but admittedly it is pretty well done compared to what else I've had. For FFF repertoire it seems a bit odd. Regardless, it's not half-bad."
"Midwestern Lagers = The Best!"
"pretty good, but doubt I'd grab another bomber of this. Too many other good FFF beers I'd grab and I'm more of an ale man myself. Doubt this will be around longer anyways. A sweet looking bottle though!"
"This is one of my least favorite styles but for the style one of the best ones I've had, especially from an American brewery. If you like pilsners you have to get this. Score is too high for an average beer, but not for style."
"D= Very drinkable could drink more of this on a hot summer day."
"I received this bottle in a trade with mayorQuimby, thanks Scott! It poured a thin, dull orange with no head at all. It's pretty cloudy, like a good hefe. It doesn't really smell like too much other than it has a light honey accent to it. It smells alright though. It is what it is. The taste too is pretty on point. It's light and the only thing I can pick out, again, is honey. It tastes like a solid lager with honey plain and simple. It makes you wonder my more mainstream lagers aren't like this one. It drinks smoothly and is light. I could drink this all day. This beer is very drinkable and a very good representation of the style."
"This is a medium bodied brew with a modest level of carbonation. It is overall quite drinkable."
"D - I never thought I'd quote Ding's vitriolic Anglophilia-driven blurbs, but here it goes... ""Think!.. Just because you can, it doesn't mean you should."""
"D - a quenching tasty dort, not a complex style to begin with but it is great in its simplicity and this is a very good representative of the style if a little hoppy -who cares it is flavorful"
"D: it was a very drinkable beer that was decent acroos the board and had more flavor than I thought it would have for a dortmunder."
"Very good lager from FFF, though I actually prefer the Gorch Fock I tried on tap at the brewpub. These guys really do a ton of styles well. Well worth seeking a bottle of this out."
"This is a fresh beer and tastes great. It's easy to drink, with a smooth feel and a crisp, clean finish. The body is thin, but not too. It's slightly sweet, but the sweetness is subtle enough that it doesn't degrade the drinkability or the overall enjoyment of the beer itself. Another good offering from Three Floyds."
"This is another very solid summer session beer. Not too exciting, but very good nonetheless."
" D- This was big hops that were nice but there was an odd cloying flavor that just got in the way. The lager crispness was nice but the big noble hops get to be to much for a full glass."
"Beer is medium to light in body, minimal carbonation in the mouth. Great mouthfeel with some estery notes and some minimal bitterness. The forward is mildly sweet but all is well connected, highly drinkable. A little bigger in the mouth would have improved it and a cleaner back palate presence. Overall a good lager and I would drink it again for sure."
"Drinkability -- Quite refreshing. Not my favorite style, but this is a great beer for the summer season."
"D: I think this is a good lager! I found it to be very refreshing."
"D: 3F has a thing for good lagers. I'd be happy with another bomber."
"D: Pretty good. Not one of my favorite styles, but this one is pretty tasty."
"Pour a straw yellow with a pils type head,large and wild carbonation,perfect pour for the tulip glass,thin lacing remains,citrus floral but not at all overpowering,just enough hop-bite to round it out,This is a easy drinker, moves right along to the bottom with little effort,grab another and start again,still reminds me of an interesting take on a pilsner style with FFF twist"
"The palate opens with a firm bitterness with a beautiful grassy, earthy and herbal hop character, along with a little lemon. The mid-palate has crackery and biscuit-malts with a grainy, husky character. I'm also getting a little citrus hop character, making me think this was a leaning little bit towards an American interpretation when fresher. Drying and bitter on the finish, there is an excellent hop bite. Remarkably flavorful, this light-bodied beer has high carbonation and is exceptionally drinkable. If only I could get this by the six-pack at a reasonable price, I'd be sold."
"Surprisingly hop forward for a pilsner although it is Three Floyds so I guess I shouldn't be too shocked. This provides a nice dry earthy character that lasts throughout even though it is nicely balanced by a slightly malty backbone with lots of golden wheat, bready yeast, light crisp fruit, citrus peel and peppery spice. Very well balanced, light, crisp and refreshing. Perfect for the warmer months although there is two feet of snow on the ground right now. Nice dry grassy hop finish that gives it a crisp bite. Very good."
"Drinkability is insanely high. Taking down a bomber of this is like taking candy from a baby."
"D: Pretty high. I'd order another and would probably buy again."
"Thanks Jer & Karen!"
"My wife likes this. That says something about this beer."
"Crisp, tasty, and thirst quenching, this was a well made take on the style and I had no problem killing this bomber. Hey, sometimes it's nice to just enjoy a ""normal"" beer from these guys once in a while."
"D: This one disappeared on me a little too quickly, it's remarkable how consistently this beer reminded me of Great Lakes version of the same. This beer is, dare is say such a thing, normal. And it's not a bad thing either, as it turns out to be a well constructed beer, just not one of the most popular styles is all."
"Glad I got to try this one. I found it to be an easy sipping beer that is a nice change from their bigger beers. This would be a good keg beer for a gathering of friends."
"clear gold with a nice, thick, persistent white head and lacing. biscuity, doughy malts and grassy hops in the aroma. cracker-like lightly sweet malts are well balanced by the smooth hop bitterness. light bodied with a frothy mouthfeel and crisp finish. a good example of the style and quite drinkable as a sessionable lager."
"[NA-1/2]"
"Bottle thanks to FlssmrBrewAlum. Pours a clear golden orange with a small white head. Aroma of wheat, grass, and a touch of cardboard. Flavor is better--sweet fruits initially with a wheaty, lager malt finish. Very pleasant and super drinkable on a warm summer's night."
"D- I expected more from this beer but I think their goal was to make something that would be more mass friendly. I have had a lot worse beers than this and to be honest I could drink this over and over if I had some. It's a nice beer to drink when you don't want to wreck your taste buds and want a easy drinker."
"Have at you!"
"D - Excellent for the style, shining in both flavor and refreshment areas. A very good FFF offering that *doesn't* rely on on the overuse of Amarillo."
"This is a decent beer from FFF, but their twists on this one took away from the drinkability and didn't add much in the way of complexity or depth. That said, a mediocre beer from FFF is better than most things out there."
"overall i enjoyed this and would have given the drinkability a 5.0 if this was not a $12 beer. $6 would be a far better deal, $12 is way too expensive. taste wise, i loved this and it was the perfect 4th of july lets light of fireworks beer. sure, it may not be 100% brewed to be a dortmunder or pilsner but thats what we do in america, tweak everything. happy 4th!"
"Mouthfeel is light and clean with strong carbonation."
"Arrives medium yellow in a pint glass at the FFF brewpub with only enough head to let you know they didn't forget to carbonate it. Aroma says they looked east rather than west for most of the hops, definitely Saaz with a bit of a kick, perhaps their kettle is permanently infused with Amarillo. The flavor is a pretty straight reading of a Czech pilsner. A very serviceable and well-executed effort, but I sat and waited to find out what FFF had done to twist this style, but was only left with a little heavier body than a traditional plis. Overall a respectable effort, but a surprisingly normal take on a classic style for a brewery with the slogan ""its not normal."""
"Decent, spritzy mouthfeel but just not light enough for my taste. An easy-to-drink beer, but there are better options for this style. Easily the least impressive beer to come out of Munster."
"Pours thinly veiled pale gold with a stubborn head that leaves ribbons of lace all the way down the glass. Smell is fresh bread with slight whiffs of lemon zest and grassy notes. Mouthfeel is a bit creamy for the style but there's enough carbonation there to keep this on the refreshing side. The flavors are very well balanced: the sweet breadiness blends seemslesly with the earthy hop bitterness. No one flavor speaks out of turn. Not quite as crisp a finish as I was expecting, but overall this is a very nice journey into the lager world for this ale powerhouse."
"Flavor is the same as the nose, but more intense. Starts ouf with fabulous pilsener complexities, roundly dry and bitter. Ends with a sweet balance from a finish which is like walking through a hayfield at dawn."
