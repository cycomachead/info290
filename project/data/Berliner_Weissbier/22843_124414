4.17,0.5,4.5,4.25,4,4.25,4.25,"D - Not the most complex beer, but enjoyable and easy to drink. Appreciate the sub-5% ABV too, as there are too many of these 6%+ Berliners popping up. Probably more appropriate for the summertime.","MasterSki","Jan 06, 2015"

3.4,-18.1,,,,,,"Pour is clear pale golden yellow with lots of tight white head. Nose has some rich rounded honey grains and doughy malt. The fruits are more red tropical punch and more clean grain. Taste is a bit sweeter and no off flavor. Grains arenâ€™t nearly as strong but there, notes of honey, a fuller body than you would normally see on a Berliner. Sugary fruitiness and tropical punch, faint citrus and low acidity. Slightly sour and high carbonation.","cpetrone84","Oct 27, 2014"
