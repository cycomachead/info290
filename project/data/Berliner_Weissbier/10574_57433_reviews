"Mouthfeel is light and pleasant. Overall...not sure what to say. I have little experience with the combination of sour and smokey. It's definitely interesting, and I would say it's well made, but it may not be my style."
""
""
""
"This beer is ripe, unique, and full of incredible flavor. What a winner."
""
""
"This beer is light and refreshing, heavy on the smoke, and wheaty on the finish. I'd say the tartness of a berliner weisse is absent here, so that's a bit of a strike against it. Otherwise, it's an enjoyable beer for summer months."

"O- A tasty unique beer, definitely will try this again!"
"Light orange in color, slightly hazy. Small head quickly dissipates to a ring around the glass. Aroma is wheat, grass, a slight sour citrus note. Flavor is tart yeast and smoke at first. Grains intertwine with the sourness... very appealing. A slight smoky saltiness sits on the tongue on the aftertaste. This beer is a treat to the taste buds. Lighter bodied with moderate carbonation. Overall, this is a very good beer and unlike anything I've ever had up to this point. Recommended to fans of Berliners and rauchbiers."
"Overall this is a light bodied, tangy weissbier. I'm not rooting around for my bullhorn to let the neighborhood know about my great find. If you stumble across it at the packie and you feel like trying something new-- grab a bottle. I just wouldn't seek it out over another favorite Weiss or Lager."

" The flavor is very interesting and has lots of malt complexity yet only light sweetness more earhty and high smoke presence with aromatics of wood in the taste and not charred or overly heavy like a briquette -or campfire smokiness, a very well integrated smoke in the malt which has a nice caramel accent which adds to the yeast flavor with tangy taste yet there is a mild herbal quality with dry toasty layers of wood in the finish. Overall I loved this -I think it is great since it combineds some of the elements of a sour wheat with a smoked beer in a way that enhances the blend with sour-dough bread with smoked grain kind of complexity and it is just excellent with lots of interesting and complex elements that work well together. I recommend this ."
"Overall I am really impressed! This is a great beer. It is not hugely smokey, or aggressively sour. Just very even and refined and full of delicate notes that are plentiful and tasty. I'm buying more of this beer, no questions asked."

"One of the most original beers I have tasted in awhile. The base of a good hefe , soured and then smoked. The sour notes balance the banana flavours of the Hefe and then the smoke comes through in the finish and the nose. It all works as the balance is there and such the drinkability is maintained. I have never tasted a combination such as this and I applaud German brewers who step outside the tried and true styles that dominate the country."

""

"Worth adding to your palate but there is not enough smokey character though."
""
""
""

"Really great all around. Not nearly as much smoke presence as I'd expected, but far more complex. Well balanced and very easy drinking."

"330ml bottle. Footed Flute glass. Pale brass, foggy appearance. White froth, close crown. Fairly good retention. Lasting thin layer on top. Gentle acidic at first -wine like- followed by slight sugar & bready notes. Light to medium body. Moderate carbonation but funny palate. Oily texture. Citric astringency in the middle rounded by sour fruity notes - green pears & apples. Low bitterness. Long acidic finish & subtle hops on the aftertaste. Refreshing & easy drinkable."
""
""
"O/D-Interesting. Never had a ""Smoked Lichtenhainer Weisse"". I dare say, I would take another stab at this interesting brew."
""
""
"Overall: A style I am a little familiar with and this beer is like a rauchbier and Berliner Weiss mixed in him. Delicious and interesting. Might not be for some people, but I enjoyed it."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: The smoked malt is nice but they need to let the lacto do its work here...not nearly acidic enough."
"Quite sour flavor. Little wheat taste. The body is a bit watery, in both body and carbonation. The aftertaste reminds me of cranberry juice. Overall, I can't advise to try this. I even find the smoky flavor to be distracting."

"Poured into a Seattle Beer Week pint glass. Pours a slightly hazy golden amber with a thin white head that dssipates to patchy foam and a ring around the glass. Mild aroma of lemon, white grapes and slight biscuit malt, faint smoke. Flavor is tart lemon, apple and grape juice up front, very tart at first, but soon ameliorated by smoky dry light fruit. Light bodied. An interesting take on the Berliner style. The flavor was almost to tart at first, but does mellow in the finish, althoug it leaves a lingering lactic tart and smoke aftertaste. Flavors are tart, but not intense. Although tart beers are not my style, I enjoyed this. I would have liked a bit more smoke presence, although the smoke does make this beer stand out. Interesting and different."
""
""
"O: I've never had a beer be both sour and smokey, so this was a nice first experience to the lichtenhainer weisse sub-style. I'm generally a fan of both sours and smoked beers, and this delivered on both ends. Worth a stab if you're into either individual styles"

"This is a gangly creation. A learning experience of sorts. I found myself wishing for some mild cheese to smooth out the sharp edges and make it more drinkable; lacking this, I left some in the glass."
"Absolutely happy I had the experience. Wouldn't and couldn't drink a ton of it on one setting. But would certainly have a glass again. Must try!"
""
"I like the argument that Lichtenhainer should be its own style, as apparently it was historically, and not any sort of Berlinerweiss. There is no hint of lactobacillus. It has just a touch of the Hefe spice, but a distinct malty, grainy flavor with some perfumey notes. This is vastly more drinkable than any Berliner I've had, in any case, and I say if you see it you ought to try it. From the 500 ml bottle purchased at Bine & Vine in San Diego."
"I don't know that I'd get another but damn. Strange one."
""
"Blown away by this one. Amazing brew."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- The nice wheat flavor with good smoke flavor is complimented by some funk tart hints. Every thing is balanced and mellow making this interesting and very tasty and sessionable."
"Definitely a strange idea but it works well here. Nice balance and the flavors don't clash."
""
""
""
"Nice and refreshing. The smoke really didn't get in the way of the tartness like I thought it would. The nose was muted and didn't amaze me. Clean flavors with a solid finish. Good beer for food pairing."
""
"O: Well, I didn't realize this this was a smoked Berliner when I ordered it. And I probably wouldn't have tried it if I did. The smoke was a surprise, and diminished what was otherwise a tasty beer. But I can't ding the beer too much for tasting like what it's supposed to. I finished it without a problem....but won't be having another."
"A smoked German beer with some tartness to it. This combination of flavors isn't going to cause a revolution but they work out better than I imagined. A decent beer that is worth a shot."

"Beer is medium-bodied, with carbonation of a medium-low intensity, resulting in a pleasantly full, slightly foamy, flowing mouthfeel. Closes very dry, as might be expected by the mild acidity of the beer, with modest stickiness remaining on the palate."
""
"Lightly hazed blonde colour, ring of white head, not much in the way of lace. Smell is smoked with some fruity lemony citrus, fairly acidic nose though, mix of camp fire/bbq and light peat smoke consistantly. Taste is smokey with bit of acidic-tart fruit flavour, subtle bbq flavours, lemony, more smoke in the aftertaste. Medium carbonation, medium body, acidity is felt in the cheeks as well. Pretty good stuff here, interesting stuff here too, would drink this again gladly."
"Thanks to Sebastian for breaking this out. Sampled on 4/10/2013 at Braustelle and described as a smoked Berliner Weisse. Pours a burnt orange hue with a 1/8th inch, loose, bright white head. Nose expresses citrus notes, primarily tangerines, yeast and candied fruit. Taste reveals slightly soured tangerines, the merest suggestion of smoked malt, apricot and a hint of lactose towards the finish. Mouthfeel is light-medium in body with a mild carbonation and a slightly milk texture. Not really spot on for the style, but amazingly drinkable; just a touch of sour and goes down extremely easy."
"Pour is dark golden orange with heavy haze and a tight white head. Nose has a lot of lemon and golden fruits and golden raisins. Notes of lacto, cream, pear with a fair bit of smoke especially as it warms. Taste has a fair bit of lacto, there are bright golden fruits, pear, mango, lemon. Body is creamy with a cream flavor and light sourness in the finish with moderate carbonation. Body is a bit full and carb a touch low. The smoke comes in towards the back, nicely balanced and more present as the beer warms. Very interesting take on a Berliner, the lacto and smoke dominate the front and back with a nice bright fruit flavor."
"Overall, nice, and has some slightly weird things going on. Worth a try, but not likely to become part of the regular rotation."
"Filtered straw yellow, light head with almost no retention. Nose has light lemon and lactic notes, with a hint of a campfire. Tastes of lemon, wheat, smoked grains/an extinguished fire. Light feel, light carbonation. Tastey as is, and is more of a subtler Hopfenstark Boson de Higgs."

"Gotta give it up for the resurrection (of sorts) of a nearly-lost style. This stuff pours a hazy pale straw topped by a finger of white foam. The nose comprises mildly-tart lemon zest, light coriander, light black pepper, light cracked wheat, and a hint of beech smoke in the background. I may or may not get a hint of juniper in there as well, but it's hard to tell for sure. The taste brings in more of the same, but that smoke is a bit more intense now; not very much, frankly, it's still just a minor pall on the absolute range, but it's enough to effectively color the second half of the proceedings here. Normally, I'm all for smoke like this, often even stronger, but here it begins as a clashing partner with the lemony bits and then as a silencer, a deadener, of the same. Things just don't work all that well together on my tongue. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a drying finish. Overall, an interesting beer, for sure, but one that just doesn't quite do it for me."
""
""
"Overall: The first time I had this I hated it. I had it again more recently and actually really enjoyed it. Not sure if my palate just changed or what, but this is definitely and interesting and excellent brew. It's a great modern take on a very ancient and forgotten style."
""
"Possibly the most interesting thing about this beer is that it revives, in a way, a forgotten style; and in that way it's unique because it's so different from almost all of the other beers on the market. There are hundreds of years of German brewing history behind us, and I'd love to see more of these styles revealed. Hedonistically, the beer is also a treat. It offers both tartness and smokiness, two fairly unique characteristics these days, but at moderate, very accessible levels. It's interesting and entertaining, as well as refreshing and satiating. Absolutely worth seeking out!"
""
"What a tasty, unique, and refreshing beer. The smoke and the tartness are both in check without being overdone."
"I really expected this to be more sour, so it was a little bit of a let down. It's still a really tasty, nicely balanced and refreshing beer, just not very sour. :("
""
""

"Overall - Holy cow.. I've never had a beer with this much funk. It's got a bit of a 'it's so bad its good' thing going on.. at times I want to drainpour but then I keep going back. Can't say I'd ever drink this again, but interesting to try once."
""
""
""
"Interesting mix of smokey, tart, and fruity flavors along with a persistent grainy malt note. Certainly not brewed to style but a solid beer none the less."
""
""
""
"O-points for uniqueness. It is drinkable, though maybe not as much as other German sours. I recommend anyone to try this."
"Enjoyed while attending Cantillon Zwanze Day 2012 at Avenue Pub as a pre-game to the event! Served from tap into a Duvel sampler. Poured a hazy pale golden yellow with a half finger white head that subsided to a minimal amount slowly. Maintained phenomenal lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, smoke, sour, and earth. The flavor was of sweet malt, sour, toasted malt, smoke, and earth. It had a light feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this was a fairly good brew. This brew really had quite a bit of potential. The aroma was about the only letdown here as it was rather weak. I basically had to bury my nose into the beer to pick up on anything. While this was a little bit of a buzzkill, the flavor did recover from this. The toastiness actually went decently with the sour note I picked up on. The smokiness just took it to another level on top of that. A really well done brew that I would definitely take the time to explore again."
""
"Bottle: Poured a light hazy pale yellow color weisse with a large pure white foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma consists of lactic sour notes with light subtle smoky flavour are quite interesting. Taste is a good mix between some lactic sour notes with some subtle smoky notes which are really not overpowering. Body is about average with good carbonation. Well brewed with nice light touch of wheat notes."
"So at the end this revieuw is not for people who like rauchbeers, i just didn't!"
""
""
"Aroma and flavor go hand in hand; there's a lot going on here, with the lemony tartness and smoke, which is certainly present but not overbearing, wheat, spice, pepper, funk all play a lesser, subtler role. A sour rauchbier that stops short of the full smoked sausage effect but should appeal to fans of both styles. Really unique and fun, I quite enjoyed this. Definitely memorable."
"O - German craft beer, thats right German craft beer. Certainly not in line with tradition but this one escaped that rule for a pretty good reason."
"O: I really enjoyed this beer - the combination of the smokey flavors and smells with the tartness of the Berliner Weissbeir is quite complementary (the smokey flavors do not overpower as I had feared they might). Easy to drink even though this is an ""Imperial Berliner Weissbier"" and the alcohol is still well hidden. I would definitely try another of these."
""
"this is unique like no other, so bonus points there. it is a smoked berliner weiss, which as far as i know, hasnt been done too commonly. it pours hazy light brown without much head. a little watery and kind of yellow to. weird. the nose is rauchbier smokey, intense in that way, over the lemon peel acidic bitterness of a normal berliner weiss. an odd fusion of styles for certain. the flavor is overly smoked, dominates the subtle fruit notes. acid and smoke are also strange bedfellows, and im not sure it works. feel works though, maybe a little thin on body, even for the style, and the carbonation isnt as bright as id like it to be. i appreciate the attempt here, but it didnt exactly click in my opinion. the smokey citrus tart beer is an odd blend. worth a try though i suppose, because there is nothing else like it out there."
"O: This beer is very easy to drink and even though it's an ""imperial"" Berliner Weissbier coming in at 6% abv, no traces of alcohol are present in the taste. I think that the smoke was very well incorporated into this beer because it's not overpowering and you can still taste the sourness and other flavors in this beer."
"4.0 D: Well rounded tasty brew. This is an instance in which combining two things I like if a huge success."
""
"Pretty mild on the tartness and slightly acidic on the back of the tounge. The taste seems to fade out towards the end. Light bodied and boldly carbed up. If it tasted better and the ABV was lowered a bit this would make it easy for a few. Maybe the addition of peat/smoke ingredients is what upped the Alc on a session type beer."
""
"Very enjoyable, if you are adventurous. Different, complex and balanced. Love that after all of the pieces, you get wheat at the end. Worth trying."
""
""
"Fuller bodied than expected but even more one dimensional than the nose suggests. Only sligtly sour with an overwhelming lactic funk presence. Very funk and cheesy with an unpleasant dairy flavor that overpowers the mustiness, light fruit and other notes. Again, I'm not picking up any smokiness, wheat or citrus. Just all lactic funk."
""
""
"O: I like this beer quite a bit. Including the smoke element in a wheat beer just adds to the autumn appeal. I’ll have this again."
""
"It's always nice to come across a beer that is interesting, unique and good. Plus, for the odd flavor combination, it's actually quite easy to drink."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a murky honey orange with 2 inch foamy off-white head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Thick foamy rings line the glass on the drink down. Smell is of grain, wheat, and smoke aromas. Taste is actually pretty sour with a nice balance between wheat/grain flavors and smoke flavors up front. There are some flavors of banana and spices on the aftertaste. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer that is tasty and really easy to drink. Definitely a very interesting beer to try."
"A unique take on the style for sure. I'd a like a bigger sour kick, but this is still a pretty good beer and a bit of a surprise to come across."
""
"B-"
"T: Opens with a nice tartness of lemon and Granny Smith apples. Leaves a touch of sweetness in the middle. Maybe a hint of white nectarine and grapefruit. Finishes tart with just a hint of smokiness on the way out. Feels a bit heavy for the style, but a really good beer nonetheless."
"It's all there: the smoke, banana, clove, sourness, bubblegum, apple.... all creating a ton of complexities for such a refreshing beer."
"2nd glass, different keg: Seemed a bit less funky and the tartness was in the background compared to the mild smoked grain character."
""
"D - I had multiple pours, and I found this pretty easy to quaff even at 6%. Would really like to try the original version, as I can imagine it'd be even more drinkable."
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a medium to light bodied brew with a very effervescent level of carbonation. Everything about this brew is bigger than the Abraxas; the carbonation, the residual malt inclusion, the alcohol, etc. The smoke and tartness are just as evident as the other version but this one just seems to be a bit better blended. The smoke transitions to tart a bit better with the more solid grain inclusion that is here. For 6% though, the alcohol is still masked pretty well. I enjoyed both of these very much and for different reasons. If I had to pick one and only one though, I would choose the Abraxas over Abraxxxas."
"D - The Imperial version here is way more interesting, but perhaps less easily enjoyed than the regular, more straightforward incarnation."
"D and overall impression: Not something I would have again. Overall, the smoke does not work with this beer. Regular Abraxus blows this out of the water. Skal."
"In short: A smoke-veil dressed Berliener Weisse and one of the the most refreshing brews you'll ever come across."
"A very interesting Berliner Weisse/sour ale hybrid.. The aroma is that of funk, fruit, and grass, very complex , reminiscent of a dewy field. There is a major shock upon taking the first sip, as the taste and smell differ vastly. The taste has a strong Berliner muskiness upfront and a thin, lactic finish. Hints of smoke and dryness in the mouthfeel..Very curious brew.. Would love another go at this."
"I found the beer interesting, but 'not my cup of tea'."
