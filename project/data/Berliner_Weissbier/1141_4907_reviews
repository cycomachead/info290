"Perhaps not as good as the cerise, there's a touch too much seed and bitter pit presence in this one. Still, its a very enjoyable beer that displays the qualities of the fruit perfectly."

"Raspberries come across really stemmy in this beer."
"Notes: Ruby colored body. Pink, frothy head. Good retention and lacing. The bright raspberry nose suggests sweetness but that doesn't carry into the flavor which displays a clean, sharp sourness. Dry. No bitterness needed. For fans of sour beers this one is a ""must-try""."

"Aroma is raspberry dominant, slightly sweet. Flavor is raspberry tart. Makes my mouth water with the tartness. It's like juicing raspberries with a touch of lemon. Raspberries are my fave fruit, so I may be biased."
""
""
"Exit stage left- the light bodied ale lifts from the tongue and evaporates in an instance, allowing for a highly clean, refreshing and palate-stripping taste with virtually no malt or earthen linger. Only a faint echo of raspberry and lime trail in the retro-olfactory, yet only briefly."
"Pour is a dark ruby in color with a light pink head.  Nose has a ton of juicy raspberry with notes of lactic acid. Very simple.  Taste has a bit more going on.  Raspberry's aren't as seedy, some leathery brett, lactic acid mid to back palate and faint tartness in the finish.  Softer creamy body, moderate carb and quite a dry finish."

"A stellar flavoured wheat beer, no matter what world region's style it was going for - tart, wheaty, sour, and fruity, all in admirable balance.  Easy to drink - that is if you don't mind the stripped-down nature of the titular fruit - each sip daring you to immediately have another go."

"O-One of my most sought-after beers at the festival; actually one of my more sought after beers. Raspberry Berliner Weiss! Oh yes. An absolute stunner. Exceeded rather high expectations."

"O: This is a fruit beer i can get along with. Not that overly chemically, artificial mess that fruit beers usually end up as. Recommend to someone who believes fruit beers are a boring style as i once did."

"O - awesome Berliner / sour. Great balance between sweet and sour.   Got as an extra from franklinn"
""
""
"Nice moderately high carbonation."
""
"O - Would love to have a few more of these! Really awesome lambic style berliner"
""
""
"O/D - Guess what? This is a sour wheat beer brewed with raspberries. Just like the bottle says! This was pretty decent. Can't say it was worthy of the hype and my expectations, but not too shabby at all and seemingly well put together. One and done for me though."

"Overall - This would be really great if not for that weird flavor."

"Drinkability: It's a very smooth drinkable beer accompanied by great flavors and aromas."
"O: Fantastic beer! From the nose to the start and through the finish, this is full tribute to raspberries."
""
""
""
""
"The taste is again raspberries, tart but unfortunately slightly one dimensional, tart and very light."
"O: Awesome. It's out of control raspberry. I would imagine that this beer is best served fresh, and I am a massive fan. Bonkers! ""This is too much raspberry."" - said no one ever."
""
""
""
""
"O: A bright and tangy brew true to the flavour of raspberries. Light and dry like a palette cleanser, it offers a tangy and refreshing drink to liven the palette. Thankfully void of the artificially sugary cough drops profile, while delivering of a full sophisticated scent and flavor. Simply delicious."
""
""
""
"This is a light bodied brew with a modest amount of carbonation. It is dry, crisp, clean, refreshing and downright impressive. I could drink this by the quart if given the opportunity. An awesome representation of the style. Very impressive how much raspberry character is present without any sweetness for being at least a year or 2 old bottle. Thank you very much Heath for sharing."
""

"Overall, very nice. Doesn't taste a lot like a berliner to me, but I like it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Not really familiar with Berliner Weissbier's, but judging by the style description, this is a very nice example of a flavoured variety where the colour and smell really show off the beer, but the berry flavour then takes a back seat to the sour wheat beer characteristics.... a perfect summer sipper, not too sour but enough so to be refreshing, and as with all DDC, very well made. Not a beer you're expecting when you crack the bottle, but leaves you wishing you got more than just 1 four pack for the entire summer! Definitely worth seeking out...."

"Big thanks goes out to oldp0rt for sending this one as an extra in a semi-recent trade! Shared this one on the One Year Anniversary of My Accident/Surgery! Served from bottle into a Mikkeller taster flute. Poured a deep ruby red with a half finger pink head that subsided to a minimal amount quickly. Maintained nice lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, raspberry, fruit, funk, earth, and tart. The flavor was of sweet malt, raspberry, strawberry, funk, subtle earth, tart, and sour. It had a light feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was a pretty good brew. If I am honest I have to say that this was one of the best Berliners that I’ve had to-date. The raspberry boomed through on each sip and kept me begging for more. The tart and sour aspect worked really well with the fruity sweetness. This made for a unique and down-right tasty combination if I am honest. A really well done brew that I’m glad I got to experience!"
"Overall. Just a fantasic beer. I could drink this every week and probably never get tired of it. Lived up to my expectation and then some. So glad that I have a couple more to savour of a style I don't get nearly enough of!!"
"Bottle: Poured a light pinkish color beer with a large pure white foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of tart raspberries with some light brett notes. Taste is also a mix between some tart notes with fresh raspberries and light residual sugar. Body is about average with good carbonation. Well brewed with right mix between fresh raspberries, tart and funky notes. I wish this would be available on a more regular basis."
"Cost: $5 for a 12 oz bottle."

"This is excellent, highly recommend!"

"Bright purple body topped by a pink layer of foam. Big acidic raspberry aroma, very vibrant. Some lactic and lemon notes are present behind the berries. The palate is similar, quite sour and lactic with a great tart raspberry character. Nice bubbly and light mouthfeel. This is really enjoyable."
""
""
"The flavor grips the tastebuds with a vinous sourness of ripe berry vines. Lots of raspberry flavor going on here to balance it all out, but the sweetness is overcome by a shock-tart-like puckering note. Mouthfeel is crisp and bubbly with a light body. Supremely drinkable on a summer afternoon in Houston. Dieu Du Ciel strikes again!"
""
"Overall, this beer rocks. Incredibly drinkable and tasty. Thanks Andrew for sharing this treat. Wow."
"Bright pink colour, solid one finger ring of white head, light shhets of lace on the glass, really a great colour though. Smell is dominated by tart raspberry, some underlying malt and yeast, acidic notes but mostly bright berry takes the front seat. Taste is tart and sour, raspberry with more puckering sourness, some malty flavours come into play mid palate and finish, just a perfect amount of acidity, more fruit in the finish as well. Medium carbonation, medium body and a fairly good feel overall. An outstanding beer well worth seeking out and no doubt something I wish I had a couple bottles of in the fridge, another excellent beer from DDC."
"Overall – Not sure if I had a bad bottle, the but smell was really off-putting with this beer. I'm all for funky scents in beer but this one smelled like burnt rubber.. or at least burnt raspberries. Thankfully it tastes much better than it smells."

"O - Surprise beer of the night. I had no clue what this was before I tasted it and was completely blown away. I want more...now. If you can get your hands on this Berliner, do it! Recommend!"
"Note: One of the two bottles I opened had a diacetyl-esque note to it, so there appears to be some bottle variation. It was still quite enjoyable, but mileage may vary here."
""
"Raspberry version had, not as good. synthetic (and natural) aroma. Pinkish colour. Minimum head. Still Nice tanginess.Too candy raspberry taste and aroma. Cherry much better.Average mouthfeel with appropriate carbonation."
"M - Medium body. Light to moderate carbonation."
"Poured a dark red with some lighter red and pinkish hues; opaque and unfiltered. Big fluffy pink head of several fingers; moderate retention. Nose is bright, with fresh raspberries, wheat and some lactic notes. Taste is tart initially, with lactic notes coating the mouth before revealing the raspberries. Some light acetic acid makes a brief appearance. Light green apple and a good body provided by an abundance of wheat. Body has a good weight to it. High carbonation which bubbles away leaving the raspberries and some slight tartness hanging around on the palate. Had to swirl this down just a bit to get it to a slightly better carbonation (personal preference), but it was great as is. A solid fruit beer, perfect all around for summer imbibing. I could enjoy this quite often given the opportunity."
"Overall – I like experiencing new beers. I love being surprised by new beers. This beer is no exception. When Luk gave it to me as an extra, I decided to hold off for a bit to try it knowing I would probably enjoy it. I am very happy I was not let down. I can only hope this beings to be imported to the United States (I believe it is only available in Canada as of now). If so, I would buy as much of this as I could. Fantastic."
"couldn't think of anything better at 10am, props to hoser for getting the day off to a good start"
"Listed as 5.9 abv, this beer pours a super vibrant red with shades of pink and appears more red than Gambrinus or any other beer with raspberries that I've seen. The smell and taste are the same in terms of fruit foward raspberries as it almost seems you're drinking carbonated sour raspberry juice most of the time. There is some hearty wheat in the nose as well, while the lactic sourness is very refreshing when combined with the perfectly ripened raspberry flavor. I don't normally like to compare within a review, but this beer is basically what I had expected Bottleworks XII to be. Instead it is simple, but simply delicious."
"Overall: One of my favorite DDC beers. Raspberries are my favorite fruit and this beer really lets them shine. While certainly tart, it still is a world-class brew and is worth driving 2+ hours round trip to the brewery to get."
"Good stuff!"
"Brilliant red body with a pinkish thin head. Huge raspberry nose. It smells exactly like real raspberries. Taste is killer. Perfect raspberries right up front and super strong. Again, real pure raspberry taste. Very tart and delicious. Thin bodied. Phenomenal drinkability."
"I was not expecting to like this beer as much as I did, wound up ordering a second. I really enjoy the Dieu Du Ciel beers and tried many others this past weekend. This one was far and away my favorite!"
"This is a refreshing and sour; a step from what I would call a Framboise-it's delightful."
"Taste: Whoh, this stuff is tang-tastic! Lip-smacking, like pure, unsweetened cranberry juice. May not be for everyone, but I seriously believe that it's impossible to make a Beer more refreshing than this. Light, wheaty body, and a dry mead aftertaste. This stuff is kick ass."
"It is quite an experience to try"
"I'm thinking of making the drive from So. NH to Montreal just to have this brew!  This is an interpretation of the Berliner Weisse style done avec fruit (strawberry, raspberry, or blueberry), with this lovely example being enhanced by the raspberry.  Strikingly beautiful rose red color with pinkish head.  Tart?? Can I hear ya say ""Hell Ya""!!  Freshly picked raspberries run bone-dry through the finish. This isn't for the faint of heart, a definate no-no for non-BA women drinkers looking for one of them funky-ass sweet fruit brews."
