"I get whats trying to be done. Its just over done on the lemongrass. Not much ginger present."
""
""

"Not my thing. Couldn't palette this beer. Extreme medicinal taste."
"First sour beer i ever had, took me a while to get use to it but now i love it"

"Tasted in 4 ounce size at Night Shift taproom.  Taste was reminiscent of Lysol.  Could not drink more than a few sips."
"Omg that is delicious.  Thick, straw yellow, opaque, sour as hell.  Great ginger root and lemon grass, lemonade, a little salty.  Phenomenal."
"Love this beer - very tart, very refreshing."
""
"Another excellent example of why Night Shift is known for its sours. Lemon grass and other citrus flavors and aroma are striking over a biting, slightly astringent, sourness. Barnyard aromas are detectable under the heavy citrus aroma, suggesting that this beer was made with a small Brett component, in addition to the more common souring techniques for Berliner Weisse. This may have arisen through contamination from their American Wild Ales or been deliberately added. The resulting flavor/aroma seems out of place in this beer, though it remains one of the better Berliner Weissebiers I have had."

"Surprised this is rated this low. Very unique berliner. It's not on par with Ever Weisse, but certainly pretty good."

"Tastes of lemon-scented soap and chemicals. Smells mildly of regurgitated, low-grade Thai food mixed with cheap floor cleaner. This beer is undrinkable and one of the worst I've ever had."

"Sour but not too harsh, slight hint of lemon."

"The flavors are strong and distinct.  Lots of citrus, ginger and lemon.  The ginger and lemon are fighting each other rather than working together.  Then you add in the citric acid and this gets to be a mess and disgusting.  I think there is a good idea in there, but you have to get the ginger and lemon to play on the same team."

"Pour is a deeper yellow with a good bit of white head.  Nose is huge musky sweat ginger with a hint of lemon and spicy tang.  Taste is very sweet, tons of sweaty ginger, tangy, citrus, chlorine like mineral in the back.  Bigger body, a bit juicy, softer carbonation.  The spice is so strong I just can't handle it."
""

"Extremely tart, even for this style"
"Batch 15. Seems from other reviews that this was ... off. Much harsher than I expect from a Berliner. The other review comparing it to cider vinegar is apt, though the lemongrass and a big ginger bite come through. It's not foul, but it's not balanced either. Literally the sourness on first drink took my breathe away and rendered me temporarily incapable of speech."

"Overall: Not a fan of this one at all. Had a really overpowering ginger/medicinal quality that just made drinking it a chore. Might be worth a try if you're really into ginger, but otherwise I would avoid"

"I'm a huge fan of sours but this is one note all the way, it would be cheaper to buy apple cider vinegar and drink that since this is what you're getting with Somer Weisse. I don't know if this batch went bad or it's meant to be like this, but this isn't a refreshing Berliner Weissbier."
"O: Extremely quaffable and refreshing. Crisp, light and flavorful all-around. Thanks a ton, Kevin!"
"Wow, this beer has a crazy amount of harsh acetic acid! So much so, it destroys almost all of the other flavors. Very strong acetone/solvent chemical flavor completely overpowering everything else. There's some sour lemon acidity and bready yeast as well but they are hard to pick up underneath all of the solvent/vinegar. Complete acetone bomb with harsh, rough solvency. Impossible to finish. All but one person at our tasting poured this down the drain(AKA Ryan's stomach)."

"O - Wow, I like this beer. Maybe my favorite out of MA. I might no have left had the state been brewing beers like this eight years ago."
"Sideline note: I heard there is plenty of batch variation here and this one being batch 17 seems to be the most timid one to date."
"Pours a murky light yellow with a foamy bone head that fades to nothing. No lacing on the drink down. Smell is slightly sour with malt, grain, lemon, and ginger aromas. Taste is much the same with sour lemon and ginger flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of acidity on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good beer that is tasty and quite refreshing."
"Nicely done, but a bit too damn sour for a berliner. As a sour head, I really enjoyed this and can't believe this is so lowly rated. Sure, Ever Weiss and Mainer Weiss are better, but this beer is better than people give it credit for."

"Overall- Another nice sour from Nightshift. I feel that this would actually be a better colder weather beer as opposed to a ""summer"" beer. Tart but warming, and still refreshing."

"Has that nice tart balance I expect from the Night Shift Weisses, but it's so ginger heavy it's distracting. A perfect summer refresher though."
"This is really weird, and really interesting. There are some huge lemon and ginger notes here, with some big funk. Definitely worth a try."

"Overall - I can't take all this ginger. Everything else is pretty nice."
"O: Fantastic. Easily the best Berliner Weisse Ive ever had. If this is available to you, go buy it, now. Thanks again Kris for this awesome extra."
""
"O/D-By far one of the oddest beers I had at Night of the Funk. First sip I didn't like then the second one grew on me. Well worth a try."
""
""
""
"Overall - Another great sour by NightShift. This is a perfect summer beer that is refreshing and light with still a but of funkiness as well"
""
"Pours a hazy yellow with a big white head that fades very quickly. Smells of lemon, ginger, citrus and a little vinegar. Taste is lemongrass and ginger and is fairly tart. Good amount of carbonation. Great Berliner would definitely have this again."
""
"M: Light bodied. High carbonation."
""
""

"O - Interesting sour with the ginger that adds a nice heat and spice to a Berliner"
"O - Overall, while not a traditional berliner it is still very nicely executed with the ingredients. Great for a warm summer day."

"I'm sold. A really good beer. Nice in the summer, but drinkable any time"

"The beer pours a chalky, pale yellow with hints of light orange and green. The beer pours with a nice head of soda-like white bubbles. In body the beer is very cloudy and impenetrable to the eye, though light and bubbly. On the nose, the beer smells beautifully funky, almost like a lambic with leather and cherry hints beside bright citric lemon and a touch of spicy ginger. The more you stick your nose in the beer, the richer the funk smell becomes and the more nuances you detect. It smells delectable and complex. On the tongue, the beer tastes tart and puckering with big acidity at the forefront of the taste. As the beer moves over the tongue, however, a nice balancing sweetness blankets the tongue and cushions it from the harsher bite of the acid. Faint, herbal saltiness can also be detected on the edges of the palate. In flavor, the beer begins as huge citric lemon with deep fruity notes that lightly hint at cherry, but mostly suggest the complexity of a well-crafted lemonade. Subtle ginger spice tingles across the middle of the swallow, and brings some really nice, ginger ale-like flavors to the finish alongside tart lemon and light wheat flake flavors that quench down the tartness. The aftertaste is lightly citric with lemon fruit and soft wheat flake flavors. In the mouth, the beer feels light in body, but sharp in carbonation with a good strong scrub and a solid pucker from the acid. The mouth is left with a light ringing pucker and some nice balancing saliva that doesnâ€™t completely flood the mouth with fluid. Overall, this is a supremely crafted American Weisse with a great amount of Berliner Weisse in it. The citrus and wheat flavor of the classic Berliner are still in this beer, but it is far fruitier and more complex than a traditional Berliner Weisse, making the beer fascinating to drink. This beer is light and refreshing, and makes one hell of a summer beer. Try it!"

"Poured a cloudy, white peach color with a nice white head that receded to a thin layer and left a bit of lacing on the glass. Aroma was citrus, musty, mildly acetic. Well-rounded taste, clean and fresh (would be good in the summer, though I did have this in the winter), lemongrass, citrus zest, a twinge of tartness, pale malts, and a dash of gingery spice. Smooth mouthfeel, medium body, very enjoyable overall. My favorite of the NS brews I sampled."

"I'm not a huge fan of ginger but I love me a solid berlinerweisse and this one delivers. A little weird and takes a bit getting used to but it works for some reason. Worth a try."

"This is my second Nighshift beer and I'm not just impressed I'm in awe. Now Teddie isn't the only good thing to come from Everett."

"Overall, an interesting take on a berlinner weisse. I feel like the ginger and lemongrass really overpower everything and can become too much too handle. Some lighter touch with the spice notes would do wonders. The sour component is pretty nice, but hardly ever shines. Definitely a unique beer unlike anything I've ever tasted."

"Bottle shared with a few friends, thanks guys. Very cloudy yellow color. No real head. Minimal lacing. Tons of ginger in the nose. Taste really does hit you with a load of lemongrass and ginger. Mouthfeel is very tart yet refreshing and light. Love that twang left on the palate. Nice beer to sip, but I wish it was a bit more inviting to look at from the beginning."
"Looks like pee. Appropriate for style I suppose. smells like ginger, overwhelmingly. Tastes like ginger and water, and a hint of lemon. Hops are present only a little, but grassy. sticky finish worth a mild tartness that's vey appropriate for the style. Malts and mouthfeel medium, rather than thin, and the 5.2 abv is a little high. Still enjoyable thigh, especially for a summer beer. I hope they make more of this. Thanks, mike!"

"Their Berliner Weiss also shines in the flavor department. I picked up lots of citrus and ginger, but also green mango as well as a mellow, agreeable sourness that I wanted to find in the first place. Medium-bodied with some acidity, Somer Weisse finishes clean and paired well with an Indonesian rendang. In general its tart profile makes it a great companion to Southeast Asian food."
""
"Great job Night Shift!"
"O: Definitely sour but not overpoweringly so. Simple, crisp and refreshing combination of citrus and wheat. Good hot weather beer for sure."

"The appearance of this beer is rather flat, but the flavor is terrific."
