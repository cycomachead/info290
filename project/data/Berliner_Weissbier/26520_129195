For reasons entirely unclear to me, the style has yet to catch on and sightings can be few and far between. As result, it's become a sort of sacred treat I reserve for those days so sunny you're happy just to be alive. And indeed this one fit the bill.","biegaman","Feb 23, 2015"

3.79,0.8,4,3.75,3.75,4,3.75,"every time i have a beer from these guys, it forces me to think about what styles really mean. their ability to lager everything and add that new element to beers we thought we knew everything about is special, and almost always successful. i love these guys, i seek their beer out, and i learn something every time i have one. the berliner braun blew my mind, and this is close to that. always though the ale yeast was part of its very complexion, but this shows that the souring can benefit from a slow cold fermentation without declining in intensity. its like a normal berliner in many ways, but less juvenile, more refined, and about average in the pucker department. hazy very pale straw colored brew with a dainty white head. nose and taste of tart green apple and white wheat. light lemon pucker in the finish but it isnt sour. not sure i could definitely pick this out as a lager not knowing, the sour overpowers the lager yeast flavor, and because of that, the finish isnt all that quick. still, knowing what it is allows me to look for and then find its differences, and appreciate them. more power to these guys, redefining the lager game yet again, i love it.","StonedTrippin","Oct 21, 2014"

Taste is also dominated by simple tart notes with light wheat malt also noticeable. Body is light with good carbonation. Easy drinking Berliner with limited amount of complexity.","Phyl21ca","Sep 20, 2014"

4.24,12.8,4.25,4,4.25,4.25,4.5,"Pours the color of pale straw and with a slight haze and a one finger head of fizzy white foam that falls off fast. The nose is tart with a bit of lactic sour, perhaps a hint of something lemony a bit of hop floral and a hint of malt. The wheat scent is hard to miss and I personally love it in a beer. Smells like the color of sunshine, golden. The taste is perfect. A slightly sharp bite of acidity greets the palate with all the tartness of a lemon that has been slightly sweetened by the wheat malt presence. The malt in this one is a gentlemanly compliment like in a ballet where the man stands tall yet firm while the girl dances beautifully around him. Sour, tart and a bit of pucker. No hop bitterness. Light body ,clean dry finish. Perfect beer for a hot day.","utopiajane","0"

The taste is sour lemon, wheat, funk, and maybe a hint of pepper. Finishes with a nice tartness. Light and crisp mouthfeel. Very drinkable thanks in part to the low ABV, obviously. Very interesting twist on an existing style but that is what Jack's Abby does well so it is not surprising. Overall, good summer brew I'll look for again.","PicoPapa","Jul 30, 2014"
