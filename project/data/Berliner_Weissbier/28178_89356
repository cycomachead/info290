I drank it, but I was so caught up with the sediment that I wouldn't let myself enjoy it to its fullest extent. I could see this being a nice representation of the style, but it was just a miss for me. If I could drink it down without being preoccupied, it would be a very refreshing beer on a warm day.","dwagner003","Jun 09, 2013"
3.75,-4.6,3.75,3,4,4,4,"Batch 99. bottle picked up about a week ago in a Chicago trip. enjoyed from a pipeworks berliner weiss glass. beer poured such a pale yellow that it looked almost white it had a thin fizzy head that fizzed away quick. smell is super tart and super tangy lemon rind and some sour egg. Fairly cheesy which is a bit off putting. thankfully the cheese is gone in flavor. taste is relatively nice lemon sourness. Some egg, but all in all a very nicr berliner. Perfect for a summer afternoon. Nice fizziness and crisp body.","cosmicevan","Jun 08, 2013"

So glad to see more US breweries venturing into this style, and Pipeworks have been pumping out some good ones. I suggest picking this up as an intro into sours.","mjohnson17","May 07, 2013"
3.43,-12.7,3.25,3.25,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Pours a murky light yellow with a foamy white head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is sour and tart with malt, grain, and slight fruit aromas. Taste is much the same with sour grain flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of acidity on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that has a better taste over smell in my opinion.","UCLABrewN84","May 06, 2013"

3.96,0.8,4.5,4,3.75,4.25,4,"This beer is very interesting as basically a naked Berliner. The tartness attacks your tongue, then some sweetness and bright flavors surround. It's very light and appealing for warm weather. If this is your style, then it should satisfy. If this isn't, then this would be a solid version to try and see if you can develop a taste for it.","PHBoiler","Mar 25, 2013"

Crisp wheat notes in the nose, lemongrass, mineral. Similar taste, lightly toasted wheat and crackery pale malts, lemon zest with a touch of tartness, grassy, a little mineral in the taste as well. Light body, thin, but appropriate for a 3.5% beer, Champagne-like carbonation. Crisp and clean, refreshing, easily drinkable.","Rifugium","Mar 22, 2013"

4.1,4.3,4.25,4.25,4,4.25,4,"(O)- I quite like this one, particularly when its hard to find a good example of this style in the states. Truer to the style than their Blueberry variant, which to me felt more like an american wild ale than berliner. At only 3.5% ABV, sign me up for many more once the weather starts to warm up. And, I was happy with the $9.99 price tag per bottle.","sweemzander","Feb 20, 2013"

4.25,8.1,3.75,4.25,4.25,4,4.5,"If they weren't already doing a good enough job of it, I would be more than happy to write copy for Pipeworks labels. Anyway, this stuff pours a cloudy pale grapefruit juice topped by a finger of relatively short-lived lightly off-white foam. The nose is a simple blast of tart and juicy lemon zest. Things go from straight within-the-rind fruit to lightly-sweetened lemonade. The taste is more single-minded, keeping to the tart and sour track with a hunk-a-hunk-a burnin' vengeance. The body is pretty light, with a light moderate carbonation and a dry, sticky finish. Overall, a highly enjoyable and refreshing little Berliner. Good times. 'Nuff said. Get some.","TMoney2591","Feb 17, 2013"
