"love this beer!! poured from bomber into a snifter. crisp flavor with a nice gentle sour after taste. a near perfect example of a berliner wiess !! with the added benefit of a bit more abv"
""
"22oz bottle that has been in my fridge for about six months. Hazy yellow color, small head. Aroma was wheaty, and hinted at tartness. Mildly tart, really good flavor. Had this right after a Snarling Badger and this was mile ahead of that one. Nice stuff."

"Overall the beer is dry, crisp, tart and refreshing. Excellent summer beer and a good example of the Berliner Weisse style."

"It drinks like a standard Berliner Weiss despite the abv being higher than true to style. No frills here, and I appreciate that."

"Verdict: A very refreshing beer from Three Floyds and easily one of the simplest beers they've made. Fairly true to style, although much higher ABV, although you'd hardly notice the difference between this and a 2-3% ABV berliner. Perhaps a bit too acidic, but thirst quenching nonetheless."

"Pours a clear, gold color. 1/3 inch head of a white color. Decent retention and good lacing. Smells of lemon, pale malt, hops, slight sweet malt, yeast, and a hint of sourness. Fits the style of a Berliner Weissbier. Mouth feel is strong tartness, crisp, sharp, and high carbonation. Tastes of sweet malt, pale malt, sourness, hint of hop, lemon, and yeast. Overall, weaker appearance than the aroma and body indicate. Good aroma, body, and blend."

"O: Very good flavor and mouthfeel. All around very enjoyable. One of the heaviest Berliners I've had. Extremely delicious though. Thanks for including this Paul."

"Pours a hazy gold with a foamy bone head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace slowly drip into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is sour with malt, grain, fruit, funk, and acidic aromas. Taste is much the same with sour grain, fruit, and acidic flavors on the finish. There is a medium amount of acidity on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good beer that is tasty, refreshing, and easy to drink."
"Overall: Not only one of my favorites, but also one of the best, from 3F; crisp, refreshing, flavorfull...just, amazing. Should you come across any bombers, stock up on as many as you can - you will want to savor 'Deesko!' as frequently as possible."

"An odd take on the style that's not without its good and unique qualities. As a Berliner, it's strange and abnormally high in abv. As a post run sour beer it hits some positive notes."
"Overall - Not what I expect from a berliner. Some of these flavors don't belong."

"The beer is clear and light golden with a small white head. Scents include lemons, ornage peel, light funk, lactic sourness, stone fruit. Nice flavor, with everything coming together nicely. Puckering finish with lingering tart citrus. My chief complaint is the abv, which I feel could be lower, making the beer more refreshing and quaffable. Still, a solid offering from FFF."

"O- A very enjoyable and sour Berliner Weissbier. Really with I some raspberry syrup to put in this, I feel that would be really good!"
""
""
"Overall - not a fan since I'm not a fan of sour beers. It's about on par with new glarus's Berliner weisse that I've tried."
""
"Looks like a dark apple juice. Nice nose on this. Lots of citrus, phenolic acid. Smells just like a Berliner should. Huge tartness upfront and mellows out with a wheat malt finish. Very nice carbonation on this, quite refreshing. Could see myself drinking a ton of this in the summer."

"O: Maybe a touch more grainy than I like my Berliner Weisse, but true to style. Puckeringly tart and very crushable. A great summer quaff."
""
""
""
"The first sour ale that I have ever tried. The taste was rich and full of flavor. It is quite sour, but personally I like that. I have had other sours, but Deesko is still the best one I've ever tried. Unfortunately, 3 Floyd's does not brew this often. If you're looking to try your first sour then I recommend this beer strongly. It will change your life."

"Overall, the beer is the right amount of tartness, sourness, dry, yet easy-drinking with a clean aftertaste. A great beer."

"Berliner Weisse review #26."
""
""
""
"It's light-bodied, but this one might be an example of a beer that should have a little more body just to carry thh big flavors through, a bit more wheaty heft (not much). It might be a bit more of a break from tradition, but it seems necessary, just to a small degree. As it is, it's nicely crisp, bright, and acidic but still smooth."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Tart from begining to end with hints of bread and citrus. Not the mostt drinkable beer but I'm glad I was able to snag a bottle at the brewery."
""
""
""
"O - Nice tart and refreshing Berliner. It isn't too complex but it gets the light tart profile just right. Definitely a beer to sit on the porch and drink during the hotter months"
""
"I liked this more and more everytime I tried it. It is not the ""starter"" sour beer as some berliners have been hailed to be, but great if you cant get enough of the sour (like me)"
"Wonder what the gobbledygook is? ""This ""not normal"" Berliner Weisse is a tart and refreshing liquid homage to Euro culture."" Sure. Why not. I doubt that this is being consumed in any desk. Or nazi tanks. Unless it's Euro-culture fashion to drink feline urinary, sauvignon-blanc-y, vegetal, grassy, wild and yeasty, and ever-so crazy."
""
""
""
""
"O-The initial tart notes are great but the bread finish throws off the balance and ruins the beer."
""
""
""
"Overall, I really enjoyed this beer. I like a straight shot of sour and this provided. Doesn't stay true to the Berliner style (based on the other Berliners I've tried), but great otherwise."
""
"Overall: Refreshing and a very sour version of the Berliner Weiss style. I'm glad to have tried this and its too bad FFF isn't selling more of it right now at the pub because I would buy a couple of these. They are like a non-farmhouse geuze and plenty sour, which is what I've been in the mood for lately."
""
""
"really loving the hell out of this one. again, FFF nails yet another style down to the T."

"A pleasant American wild ale/sour, but this didn't really resemble a berliner much at all. Quite tasty at colder temperatures, but it began to fall apart as it warmed. A bit of a white/green grape character is present along with moderate sourness throughout. Some vinegar. A decent sour from Three Floyds, but an unrepresentative berliner."
""
"Mouthfeel is nice and light. There is a sticky was that comes from the sour that is not like that of a hop Stickiness at all, however, light feel and carbonation keep it refreshing."
""
""
""
"An excellent effort from the Floyds. This is really hittin' the spot."
"Yea, I'm pretty sure my face is going to stick this way."

"Overall: An interesting brew. The higher ABV gives this brew some uniqueness. Nothing I would go out of my way for or but I'm glad I got to try it."

"Reviewed from notes. Pours a relatively clear gold with minimal head. The nose is a tad funky with heavy lemon character up front followed by wheat bread and acidity. The taste is basically exactly what the o promises... Waves of citric tartness balanced by grainy wheat character. The body is super light ith a high level of carbonation. Overall, a nice example of the style. Well balanced and refreshing."

"D - I think this is basically the same as I <3 Deesko, although the bottles seem to have significantly more spritz to them than the draft version I tried.. It's not subtle, but it's far and away 3 Floyds' best sour beer. I think m stomach would melt if I tried to finish a 22oz bottle on my own."
""
"Somehow I'm always transported back to seventh-grade German class when I hear Disco pronounced this way... Anyway, this stuff pours a lightly hazy straw topped by a finger or so of white foam. The nose comprises tart lemon zest, sour green apple, lactic wheat, and soft powdered sugar when all of the sourness has passed. The taste brings in more of the same, with that tart citrus really rocking the initial tastes. A mild vinegar character peeks in at times as well, but never stays long to chat. The body is a hefty light, with a light moderate carbonation and a dry, sticky finish. Overall, a very nice B-Weiss, one that definitely brings the tart without overdoing it."
""
""
""
"Light hay colored with a head that left faster than a fart on a windy day (seems fitting adjective for funky beers). Yogurt in the aroma tells me it'll be lactic so I am excited. Tart and grassy and very light and fleeting but manages to leave an impression. Quite dry. Good."
""
"Pours a hazy straw yellow capped with a one finger white head. Fruity notes, a bit of apple and light citrus including lemon accents and some funk similar to that found in yogurt or cheese on the nose. The taste follows the nose, slightly bitter apple, light lemony citrus, some grain accents, and mild tart funkiness. Light bodied with light, bubbly carbonation. The depth of flavor in this brew doesn't match some others in the style, however very refreshing and enjoyable."
""
"This is a light bodied brew with an effervescent level of carbonation that keeps this light, refreshing and easy drinking. Overall it fits the bill for the style but it falls slightly in the middle when compared to other takes on the style. There are some kinks that could be worked out to make it overall more enjoyable but as-is it isnt bad by any stretch."
"OK and perfectly drinkable, but falls well short of what I prefer out of a Berliner."
"O: I wasn't wowed, but it was interesting to try. I liked Bear Republic's Tartare much better. I'm considering tossing in some flavoring syrup for the hell of it."
""
""
"Not sure if the on-tap syrup option is throwing this beer off cause I have not tried that. But on its own I think it's great. Nice refreshing light bodied beer with good tartness. A little sip went a long way for me in the flavor department but I could put them down fast without a little self restraint."
""
"O - Light, tart, citrus - wheat and corn sweetness keep up."
"Smell and taste have champagne-like characteristics. Sharp on the nose and a quick bite on the tongue before the flavor eases into a tingle. Despite the bite, overal flavor is mild to weak."
""
"Had a pint of this up north. Good tart and refreshing brew that I'm sad is no more. One finger head that sticks around pretty good, then dwindles down to nothing. Lemon grass tartness that ends kind of dry. Good stuff. I'm proud of these Hoosiers."
"D- This beer has no characteristics of a Berliner Weiss but had a good head and light mouthfeel. Where are the wild sour notes? I'm glad I didn't get any syrup added, and why do you served a 3% ABV beer in a chalice?"
"This is certainly an easy drinking beer. Light carbonation, light, sweet flavor, and a firm body. If you're bringing your mom or someone else to 3F and want them to try something aside from PBR, have them give this a go. A great crossover beer."
"Mouthfeel was commendable. 3 F's manged to make a farely light beer have some decent body and drinkability. Added a touch of lime flavoring and really accentuated the tartness a bit. Nice to see a diverse style."
"I want to try this one with no syrup."
"What, a Berliner Weisse from an American brewpub!? That's kick-ass! Amber copper color with a thin layer of carbonation atop which maintains itself. A bit of a wheat aroma with some lime citric notes and some rustic yeastyness to it. Flavor is tart but not real tart. So I stayed sans syrup as I think the syrup would ruin this delicate beer. More of a lemony citric tartness. A slight grain coats the tartness and the yeast comes in towards the finish with a bit of spice, maybe cloves. Finish is drying and a bit acidic. Quite refreshing. I didn't know this was 3% but that is what one would expect from a Berliner Weisse. Easy drinking, refrshing, palate cleansing if not the most daring of offerings. Nice changeup!"
"Mouthfeel- Pretyy sharp acidity with some syrupy sweetness to balance everything out."
