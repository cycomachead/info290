"Hazy yellow no head, saurkraut and bready aroma and flavor. Refreshing tartness and dry mouthfeel. ""A"" grade new world Berliner. Nothing too special."
"Never had a Berlinerweisse out of a can before. I might have to pick some of these up for the summer if they aren't too expensive. Overall a splendid example of the style. Should go well if you prefer to add a dash of himbeer or waldmeister syrup."

"O- a bit of an underwhelming sour, especially at this rice point. One dimensional towards the tartness with only the mild breakfast cereal character giving any complexity. Could definitely stand some increased esters or funk. That said, it's an easy drinker and the six pack shouldn't last long as the days get warmer."

"Very nice Weissber, sour taste, lemony and very fruity acidic.  A refreshy style, good for the porch on a hot day."
"Wow! first time trying this style? Salty and sour lemon...made my mouth pucker up."
"A bit harsher acidity than I'd like. A touch of DMS / creamed corn in aroma and flavor."
""
""
"Overall, if you enjoy exceptionally tart and quenching Berlinner weisse, this beer is for you."

"The sourness was outstanding and perfectly pucker. But also quite drinkable. Pretty much fell in love."

"Wow! What a Crack! It was so loud that it awakened all of the little critters on my kitchen. The mouse hopes that the kitten was not aroused! What was aroused was the lees and the yeast. I got a finger-and-a-half of foamy, bone-white head out of my inverted Glug and it evinced decent retention before falling to wisps, leaving nice lacing in its wake. Nose was earthy, very evocative of my neighbor's garden just before she begins planting seeds. Color was a hazy-cloudy Yellow-Gold (SRM = 4 -5). The lack of clarity meant that The Golden Trio (tm) of Midas, Croesus and Mammon were disinterested. More for me! Mouthfeel was thin-to-medium. Whoa! Did somebody substitute lemon juice for my beer?!? Holy f**kin' tart, Batman! Shazam!  I CAN't unpucker my lips and I am supposed to play the trumpet tonight! My duck face is not of my own free will. Finish was dry, puckering and everything that was intended."

"Overall I thought this was a good beer and good example of the style, it had pretty much all the aspects that I look for in a Berliner Weiss and I think it would make for a good beer to enjoy in the summer time.  This beer has nice drinkability, it's smooth, a little refreshing, a little acidic, a little crisp, not filling and the taste did a nice job at holding my attention, but I think the acidity would prevent me from drinking more than one.  What I like the most about this beer was that it was just a nice true example of the style.  What I liked the least about this beer was the appearance, I wish the head and lacing were better.  I would buy this beer again and I would recommend it to anyone who likes sour beer and especially if you like the style.  All in all i was happy with this beer, it just what I was in the mood for and i think it's nice that more breweries are making this style.  This is one of the better Evil Twin beers i've had and I think it's above average for the style.  Good job guys this is a tasty and refreshing beer, keep up the hard work."

"Very sour.  Like an unflavored lambic.  I don't detect any wheat whatsoever in the flavor.  Lip smackingly sour--long lasting aftertaste, but not necessarily pleasant."
""
""
"Very soda like and thin on the body. Almost feels like water, if not for some noticable hints from the wheat and berliner influence. Kind of a berliner/soda hybrid almost. Strong sour tones (really biting) with a sharp lemon influence."
"Grabbed a can at Astoria Bier & Cheese. Poured a hazy gold with no head. It's fruity and tart with an earth bitterness. The fruit tastes like a mix of cherry and banana with lemon squeezed for the sour tang. Overall, a balanced, flavorful, and well-made berlinner."
"Insanely crushable. Tart and amazing."

"The beer does not explode out of the glass, but it is supremely drinkable and addicting."
"O: This is a nice session beer that would lend to drinking a bunch of these.  Why drink beer with no flavor when you can drink this."
""

"Evil Twin is a hit or miss. This one- a miss."
""
""

"Tasty Berliner, basically like a tart lemonade flavor. Had side by side with bu weisse, couldn't hold up to that but still nice."
"This was really enjoyable! The tartness was just right and had a nice funk. I would have this beer again in a heartbeat."

" The taste is very good some lactic qualities that bring to mind lemony juicy flavor with some wheat to add sweetness with light funk and mild briny-rind-like tropical fruity flavor with some mild sweetness in general. Overall this is a very drinkable sour wheat ale witth tangy fruit with easy to drink strength - I like this canned berliner -recommended."
""
"The feel is refreshing even with the acidic nature, not harsh to drink at all.  The body is a little stronger than the light, soft texture it should display, but not overdone much.  It keeps up a good dryness on the palate even with the juiciness."

"M: Medium-low mouthfeel."
""
"Overall, this is a good and mostly stylistically appropriate Berliner Weisse. It's solid but just a little lacking. Could be a bit more crisp and the carbonation is there, but fairly low for the style."
""
""
"As far as this being a Berliner Weisse...I'm not that sure. It taste an awful lot like a Westbrook Gose variation, than a true Berliner Weisse. I know Westbrook brewed this beer for Evil Twin, and Westbrook is one of my favorite regional breweries, but they didn't try too hard to make it different from their Gose. All that being said, I still like this beer as a Gose and rated it as such."
"Very good Berliner. I could drink this everyday."

"I probably would have liked a bit more sour tang, but I can't really find too much wrong with this beer.  It just doesn't excite me.  At its price point, probably one six pack is enough for purchase."

"Canned on 10/08/14. Straw color to orange with a haze. Medium white head with low retention. Sour, with a hint of passion fruit and salt aroma. Very acid flavor. Some fruit with a salty finish. Dry with low to medium carbonation. Overall, a very drinkable Berliner Weisse that makes to want more."

"Very sour, light, refreshing. Citrusy. Great in can form. Would buy again."

"Its palate-stripping sourness refreshes the palate with ease and provides a light body and crisp texture. With a quick echo of wheat bread, the beer dissolves from the mouth with utter ease. It's a masterful taste with powerful sourness that never lingers or fatigues the palate. Perfect for hot summer days. I wish this was one of those."

"I'm surprised at the amount of mediocre reviews. Fantastic take on a BW, especially if you like em' with heavy Lacto and very sour. Maybe a tad too sweet, but again, hits the style on the head and has terrific smell, feel and taste from top to bottom."

"A big thanks to the legendary woodychandler for this beer. Poured from a 12 oz. can. Has a golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of lemons, grains. Taste is tart lemons, grains, a bit funky, finishes dry. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a unique and enjoyable beer."
""
"i think i prefer this to the nomader wit, that was a bit boring, but this one is not without its flaws either. a real quick lacto kettle sour on the nose, funky and apple forward, just sour enough in the aroma. the wheat malt feels heavy even in this really light beer, and the stinky souring process is not matured out of this beer, its gross to those who are unaware how these beers are made. i get a green apple character in here that im not all the way in love with, and a heavier feel because its so cloudy and raw. the carbonation is also below average for the style, i like these to be a bit brighter in that aspect, so this one was a weird beer. a session style that i only want one of. not too often that happens with me."

"12 ounce can into tulip glass, canned on 7/17/2014. Pours hazy golden straw color with a 1 finger fairly dense white head with poor retention, that reduces to nothing very quickly. No lacing on the glass, and a light amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of tart lemon, green apple, pear, white grape, hay, straw, grass, white vinegar, wheat, bread, musty funk, and yeast earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance and complexity of fruity/funky/lactic yeast and pale malt notes; with solid strength. Taste of tart lemon, green apple, pear, white grape, hay, straw, grass, white vinegar, wheat, bread, musty funk, and yeast earthiness. Fair amount of fruity/acidic tartness on the finish; with lingering notes of tart lemon, green apple, pear, white grape, hay, straw, grass, white vinegar, wheat, bread, musty funk, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a short bit. Very nice complexity and robustness of fruity/funky/lactic yeast and pale malt flavors; with a great malt/tartness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and light-medium bodied; with a very smooth, crisp, and fairly acidic mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with zero warming present after the finish as expected of 4%. Overall this is a very nice Berliner weisse style. All around good robustness and complexity of fruity/funky/lactic yeast and pale malt flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A very enjoyable offering."

"O: a bold and very flavorful 4% ABV beer."

"Overall, this is your typical Berliner Weissbier.  It actually is nice because it sheds things down to the bare bones.  There is no gimmick, and there is no hook.  The beer presents itself solely, offering a serious take on a rare style.  Despite the grapey, fruity, and tart suggestions from the nose, you get hit with that bright, bittering pucker in the flavoring that you might not be expecting.  This acts to both surprise and cleanse the palate, making way for this beer, and nothing but this beer.  Nomader Weisse supports a pleasant philosophy; one of sharpness, cleanliness, and relaxation.  This is a philosophy that is easy to get behind, and you can, hopefully, truly see where they’re coming from once you sample this beverage.  They hit the style well, and make the decision to revisit this beer an easy one."

"Pour is clear cold with a dense puffy white head.  Nose is heavy candied lemon and sugar with a hint of wheat and lacto.  Taste follows suit, overly sweet, lots of candied lemon, a bit of grain and a light metallic finish.  Syrupy body, softer carb, fleshy feel."

"One of the best Berliner Weisses I've had. Not quite sure why the score isn't higher. For my taste, this is right up there with Bahnhof."

"Poured from a can into an Euler stange. Poured a light straw amber with golden tint and a half finger white head that dissipated quickly, leaving little trace. Aroma of lemon citrus with light wheat, a hint of funk. Flavor follows, quite lemony and tart with hints of wheat; tapering off quickly to lemon rind and lemon extract. Light bodied with moderate carbonation despite the lackluster head. A good lemony Berliner weissbier that left me wishing for a bit more wheat character. Refreshing and moderate tart. Not my style, but a pleasant, refreshing summer beer."

"Very middle-of-the-road. This berliner really doesn't taste like much of anything. Maybe it'd be a good candidate for imparting some fruit?"
"Overall: nice tartness, but there's an off-flavor in here that I don't love. Something about that dankish sweetness. That said, there is a tartly refreshing element here which I do like."
""
""
"O- Not the best Berliner I have tried, but I am very happy that I was able to pick this up. Nose is fairly weak, but the taste is not."
""
""
""

"O: Different styles, but Mikkeller won this round of first can releases (whoops, I forgot about Hipster, but I haven't had that, so they are at least the first cans for me from the respective brewers). A let down and I was excited to be having another berliner weisse. The label art is pretty bland and boring as well."
"Pale cloudy blond with a rapidly dissipating head. Pretty standard Berliner appearance. Nose is largely lactic and lemony, decent enough, though there's a rubbery off note that I'm not particularly thrilled by. The palate doesn't differ a lot from the aroma - moderate lacto, some spiciness, some bicycle tire. It's hard to get past that note of rubber. It isn't overt, but it's just noticeable enough that the beer is hard to enjoy."

"o - Overall a good berliner that is pretty easy to drink. I like the nose a little bit better than the taste, but both have lots of lemon and some sourness to them and are good. Worth checking out, a refreshing beer to drink."
"Poured into a Shaker pint. Hazy gold color. Taste is hard for me as this is my first of this style. But it is fairly sour with a bit of a bite at the finish. Mild aroma. Not much lacing and a head that leaves pretty quickly. It was nice to find a single in a can as I had been looking forward to trying this style."

"Hazy yellow gold with an attractive pillow of white foam on top, leaving behind sticky lacing. Light lactic aroma...lemon and creamy, grainy wheat. Refreshingly tart flavor with some lemon and a slight metallic twinge. I wish the wheat spoke up more to compliment the sour. Very drinkable, dry, and crisp. Straightforward, but good. Too expensive to drink in large quantities unfortunately."
""
""
"O: Just enough tartness to keep me wanting to drink it and very refreshing on a hot summer day here in NC. Tastes authentic to the style and definitely one that I would get again. Nice light mouthfeel and extremely well hidden alcohol considering it is on the higher end for the style."
