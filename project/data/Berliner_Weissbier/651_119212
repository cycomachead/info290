Hint of lactic sourness on the nose, not much else. not a strong aroma. Lactic sourness on the palate right up front, some hints of white grape, and some bright lemon notes. Crisp and tangy. Effervescent with a nice, dry finish. Nice beer. One of my first Berliner-style beers. I am sure that there are some whoppers out there, but this was a nice taste of the style for a good price. Berliner-style might be making it to the homebrew queue.","Mikus","Jan 19, 2015"

Even fine speckled lacing looks great poured into a flared chalice. Aromatics bring out tart lemon notes, slightly chalky yeast components, and some yogurt like lactic notes combined complexity into a refreshing summer release from Ithaca brewing company. Clean bright tartness, refreshing chalky yeast component, lacks any off putting phenolics which is a good thing. Lemon, tartness would work perfect with some cilantro spiced pico de gallo mahi mahi fish tacos. Mouthfeel finishes dry like the backend of the sour scale of a Warhead/sour patch kid candy, carbonation is moderate rolling cleanses the palate with the nice bone dry finish. Overall a quality version of an under served style, more summer refreshers slightly sour and funky works for my palate.","WVbeergeek","Jun 07, 2014"

Smells incredibly fresh and clean, with light citrus notes, especially lemon and maybe even a subtle hint of the ginger ale that is fitting from the appearance. Taste is not what I would expect, much lighter and more tart. There's no banana or clove, but tons of citrus, ginger, lemongrass, along with green apple, a slightly herbaceous (grassy) note toward the end, with long, smooth tones of wheat present throughout that gets more pronounced toward the end. The finish is packed with wheat with the lingering taste of lemon, clean, and refreshing. Mouth-feel is lighter than I typically expect from a weisse, but welcome--very light, crisp, and refreshing. I'm realizing this is a Berliner weisse (my first in a long while), which is distinct from the hefeweizens (most hailing from southern Germany, such as the area around Munich) and Belgian witbiers upon which I had been basing my expectations. Perfect summer beer!","logicalparadox","May 25, 2014"

3.99,13,3.75,4,4,4,4,"The beer pours a pale yellow, like mildly dehydrated piss, forming an eggshell white head of soda-like bubbles that quickly fizzle to a scrim. In body, the beer is supremely clean and clear with a mellow trickle of carbonation bubbles moving through the beer. The clarity is honestly a little odd for the style… Where is all the wheat? On the nose, the beer smells tart lemon, yogurt and granola, and a smooth, wheat bread smell on the back of the sniff. This is a very clean and crisp smell. On the tongue, the beer tastes refreshingly tart with a balancing, bready sweetness that moves in with the middle of the sip, yet the finish is elegantly dry and refined. There might be a touch of salinity if I really dig into the flavors, but really this beer is a simple tart and sweet, which is exactly what it should be. In flavor, it begins as tart lemon juice, which moves into greek yogurt flavors that become rich with just a touch of salinity, and then some sweet, fruity green apple. The finish is a lovely blend of wheat dough with hints of wheat flakes and just a touch of lemon juice. In the mouth, the beer feels light in body, with a crisp, effervescent carbonation, a clean and crisp mouthfeel, and a tremendous drinkability. When the beer leaves, the mouth is left slightly wet from acidty, yet clean and refreshed, making this beer awesome for summer thirst quenching. Overall, I like this beer. It is an excellent six-pack Berliner Weisse. Simple flavors mesh together for just enough to interest the sip, while mouthfeel makes the beer very crushable. This is a great day drinker, and would probably pair very well with a syrup (if you go that way). This is a great sessioning Berliner Weisse. People need to make more six-pack Berliners.","Maxwell","May 21, 2014"

Also has a delightful bit of faint cracker. It's a touch funky but not too much. Taste is light and has a bit of cracker on the tongue. The fruit is tart and the lactic sourness makes you pucker a bit. Simple, refreshing. Plentiful and active carbonation gives it s sprtizy feel. I think Ithaca has made a wonderful Berliner here. As it drinks it's dry and even a touch woody. Very simple and easy to drink.","utopiajane","May 08, 2014"
