"sour and delicious.  took a while to find one without syrup at a bar in berlin"
"Way too sour for a Weisse imo"

"Pale yellow, quickly vanishing noisy white head. Smell of lemon and bread. Taste lemony, very sour. Aftertaste doesn't stay for long. Refreshing. OK, but not my style. Much more sImilar to Gose (but it's not salty) than Hefeweizen or WItbier."
"Bowl. Bottle. Pale yellow, little hazy. White almost vanishing white head. No lacing at all. Very light aroma of straw, grains, but mainly dominated by sharp lemon and apple notes. Taste is sour (sharp lemon, some grapefruit). Dry, sharp, light body, above average carbonation, thin texture. In overall refreshing and crispy beer."

"O: If you can handle the sourness, this beer is quite easy to drink. A dash of raspberry or woodruff would definitely make it more palatable. Nonetheless, it is a good representation of the style."
"Tasty, though surprisingly sharp. I suspect the acidity has increased while it was sat in my garage. The flavour is most reminiscent of unsweetened yoghurt, with a tartness similar to grapefruit juice. Earthy yeast dominates, with subtle grain and wheat taking a back seat. Light but refreshing, and would certainly be nice on a warm day. It's a simple beer, and I find it very drinkable (preferably without the syrup that the Germans insist on adding). Worth trying if you come across it."
"A very sour tasting beer with citrus and some wheat but other than that there isn't a lot to report on this one. It was fairly easy to drink after the initial acidity and sourness settled down slightly."

"I felt like taking an effervescent C vitamin. Interesting but didn’t fell like asking another one. Though not knowing what I was drinking ahead didn’t help."

"Overall: I have only had a few of this style, so I am no expert. I like this beer, it is a thirst quencher. Would be outstanding on a hot afternoon."

"Thanks to Thirstybird for the opportunity to try this. Pours a semi-hazy yellow-gold with a loose, half inch, bright white head that gradually dissipates into a broken slick. Nose is bready and yeasty with a hint of citrus. Taste follows nose; however, a bit more citrus forward in the flavor profile. Tartness is present, but a little masked by the other qualities. There is also a residual yeasty character at the finish that lingers between quaffs. Mouthfeel is light in body with a pleasant citrus astringency and an assertive carbonation. Overall, a solid example of the style; however, perhaps a little too bready flavor for my general sensibilities."

"Overall a good beer, bit too sour for me to drink alot of though."
""
""
"Overall, a classic and interesting alternative the the ""average beer drinker's beer"". It has the low alcohol that makes this an easy-drinking beer, but has the complexity from the sourness that is reminiscent of a nicely blended lambic. I am impressed."

"Dr: Too strange, even for the style."
"O: My first berliner weisse. I can see why this isn't considered a great one, but I still enjoyed it and it definitely gives me the urge to try more. Good sourness, but just a little weak on the edges. Worth picking up if you stumble across it."
"O: I dig this beer every time I have it. (4)"
"This is a light bodied offering with a modest level of carbonation. Perhaps just a touch less carbonation than most other takes on the style but still well done. This brew is very clean and excessively drinkable with a crisp finish. I pounded down nearly half my glass before even starting to think about what I was doing. If this brew was readily available to me, I would purchase this non-stop throughout the summertime."
"O: This is pretty much a standard of the style but certainly not the best out there."
"This beer was really not what I expected. A whopping 3% abv, I suppose that since the word Kindl is in name of the beer this is supposed to be a lighter brew for the younger folks in Germany. This beer is the proper color for the style. It's a lightly hazy yellow with a fluffy white head. The flavor had a bit of a tartness to it, perhaps lemon. Either way this beer was a little too light for me and not that good."
"Despite its imperfections, this Berliner Weisse is growing on me. It's very refreshing, simple and really easy to drink if one is accustomed to sour beer. Berliner Kindl is also one of the classics for the style."
"O: Different and interesting but disappointing. It's just basically too sour. I could just suck on a lemon."
"Drinkability. OK. It is refreshing, but it does not make me feel wanting for more. My opinion may change if I had this in 30C weather (now it's 15C)."
"Nose of wheat more or less light for a beer of this type and a smell of fresh earth. Mouth full with an amazing return Suret and acid with a touch of lactic acid very surprising. Not to mention the key wheat (however slight) to recall that this is a Weizenbier. While the course is light but has a very good performance of mouth, plus a fruity, and makes this very special brew."
"D: This is no favourite of mine. To acidic for my taste."
"A good summer quencher to my tastes, but you have to know what you're getting into."
"The sour taste can be overpowering at times but I did drink this much faster than I thought I would and really enjoyed it."
"Notes: I had it without any syrup, and enjoyed it. Not something I would necessarily want everyday, but I could see wanting one on a hot summer day."
"This beer is extremly light, both in alcohol and body, but really packs quite a flavorful sour punch. The main critic point is that the sourness is enjoyable, and I find the flavor intruging, but seems a bit one note. I would like a bit more complexity from the tartness--but that being said, a very traditional style, made to be enjoyed without too much debate over the subtle complexities. Very refreshing"
"I wasn't sure I would like this style, but now I'm intrigued to try more. There's something incredibly refreshing about this berliner weiss, and the sourness brings up fond memories of lambics. I'm not sure how this beer compares to the rest of the style but it gets a thumbs up from me!"
"It's not the most drinkable beer I've ever had, but it does have its charms."
"Not my type of beer but does have some positives, most notability the subtle floral taste, which unfortunately, to a certain extent is masked."
"Not what i was expecting, maybe my own ignorance. I thought I was going to get a wheat beer but it's really more of a sour than anything else. It's typically served with soda or fruit infusion but I got it plain. It would have been better if that's what I was looking for. Not great with food."
"Overall, I enjoyed the beer, especially the refreshment it provided on a hot June day in the middle of Berlin."
"D: Low abv so you can drink all day, but the flavor is only moderatlty good and would get boring after a few."
"This beer is not like its traditional Bavarian counter parts. It has a very pale yellow colored body with lots of bubbles to support its white head. The taste and smell are both sweet but more tart. The aroma is a little earthy and citric. It still has a wheat like taste but I would have to say it is a sour and sort of like a wit. It has a very fruity taste I'm not quite sure what fruit to compare it to. We'll just leave it at fruity. The body is thin and easy to drink."
"There aren't many Berliner Weiss beers out there but I really enjoy the ones I have sampled. Thanks to Bill for knocking another of the list for me. Appreciated Bill, thanks again!"
"This is definitely different from anything I've had up until now and being one who likes tart/sour brews, this one satisfied me and...is very drinkable. The label says, made with water, gerstenmalz, weizenmalz, hop extract, and wheat. I won't argue with that..."
"M&D: super-light bodied, the hyper carbonation doesn't help a lot, but the overall clean palate is certainly welcomed. All in all, a brand new drinking experience for me this is, and really gets me closer to the picture of wheat beer mixed with a young lambic - or something totally more weird than this..."
"The German girl looked at me funny for drinking it plain, but it ain't bad. Really good summer drink, I'll have to try it with the syrups."
"Overall not bad. I like it for sure. And glad I got a chance to try it."
"All in all, I don't really feel qualified to review this, as I don't think I know enough about the style to form an intelligent opinion. I like it, kind of, but it doesn't really conform to my personal expectations of ""beer."""
"I can't say I'd drink too many of these in a row. The tartness will give one a bad stomach ache, as I have one coming on now. For a 3.0 ABV brew, this is not a beer I could drink mass quantities of."
"Tastes bitter and weak. Sort of like quinine mixed in with some malt and a lot of water. I believe this is appropriate for the style but I really just don't get it. Has a mouthfeel like tap water... I think this is headed for the drain... I can't really get more than a couple sips in."
"The tiny bottle is so cute...hey I got jipped here! Oh well. Pours a cloudy gold sunshine color with a weak head. Smells of green apple and fruity. Taste is acrid acidic with lots of carbonation with some fruitiness, mostly sour apples and a hint of raspberry syrup. Takes some getting used to and not expected from a weissbier but maybe the Berliner style has something to do with it. Isn't that a jelly doughnut what JFK so humorously admitted to being?"
"To taste again."
"Review added 12-6-2007, translated from french 1-26-2008."
"D - This is really a desert beer, the sweetness of the syrup really would put you off any food. Had this without the syrup before, but not reviewed, will need to do this. However, if i had to choose which syrup, i would choose the Waldmeister over Himbeere, Himbeere is too sweet."
"D: Very good, extremely low in alcohol, makes this a good summer refresher, and one you can drink a lot of."
"D: I will crave this terrific little beer - extremely drinkable! It's evocative of the Belgian gueuze style (which I really like) in its crisp tartness, though lighter in the mouth and more approachable. I read in Michael Jackson's ""Great Beer Guide"" that Napoleon's troops dubbed this beer ""The Champagne of the North""...I can see the similarities, though at just 2.5% ABV this won't go straight to your head like champagne. At least I hope not... highly recommended."
"Drinkability: Very high if you like sour/tart beers."
"Taste has the tart, snappy crispness from the bacteria present, with a bready overtone. Can't really pick out any hops. Syrup adds a raspberry seed fruitiness, and compliments the drink well, suprisingly. Good carbonation, tart but not especially dry on the palate. One is good, it seems like more of a ""dessert"" beer. Bartender relayed the tale that this was originally developed as a low-alcohol beer for children in Germany..."
"Overall impression: Definitely an interesting beer - pretty expensive, but I was happy to get the opportunity to pick up a six pack."
"FIRST TRIAL: This is only the second Berliner Weisse I've had, but I enjoyed it very much (I enjoyed the first too). But, I am a big fan of sour, so I might be slightly upwardly biased toward this beer. The beer poured a clear yellow with very little head. There wasn't a whole lot in the aroma, but what little there was faintly fruity with just a touch of malt sweetness. The flavor though was entirely different. There was a great light fruitiness, just a little wheat, and lots of sour. The best part was that no matter how long you held the beer in your mouth, the sour flavor seemed to stick around. The finish leaves a sourness in the bottom of your jaw that makes you salivate. Very glad that I got to try this beer and I'll continue to look for other Berliner Weisse brews."
"Up to this point, I thought that only American Berliner Weisses were sour and that European beers of this style were somehow more traditional and boring. This beer has provided me a central point of what the real deal is like for this style."
"11.1 oz. bottle- color of clear yellow , with a frothy head - nose of white wine vinegar straw , hay , and eggish thing going on  taste of brine , hay , dry straw , and red wine vinegar - body light , medium carbonation , and acidic  aftertaste of vinegar , and acidic"
"Notes: If this is any indication of the others within this style I think I'll steer clear. A tart tasting light beer is what it tasted like and it really just doesn't fit well together. I would probably prefer this with the syrup and if I can get my hands on some I would try this again. For now, straight up, Pass."
"Less character than I expected, but possibly more drinkable as a result. Unfortunately disappointing for the most famous Berliner Weiss, but I'll try it sometime fresh in Berlin."
"Had this at Zeke's in Dowagiac. Served in a weiss glass with raspberry syrup in a small shot glass on the side. Looked golden and slightly flat with a fleeting white head. After the syrup went in, it looked like Kool Aid. Odor was sweet and had a slight sour wheatiness. Syrup added a raspberry odor, unremarkably. Taste without syrup was sour and fizzy and tartly wheaty. Syrup added a slight fruitiness and toned down the tartness but otherwise didn't change much. Bubbly mouthfeel. Altogether it was a nice drink. I'd even have it again if i saw it and knew it was fresh. Curious to try it in Berlin now."
"D: Delicious, a definite summer refresher...which my wife and I enjoyed on a mild winter's day..."
"For what it is, though, this is as good an example to be found."
"Pours pale straw colour with a slight cloudiness: it is in fact bottle-conditioned, with a modest sediment. The bubbly head soon declines to minor lace hinting of its claim as the ""champagne of the north"". The aroma is sour, slightly candyish and bready also suggesting this claim. Tart, but smooth honeyish undertones, and slightly woody and vegetal, the result of a complex fermentation involving both top-fermenting and lactic strains of yeast. No hops detected although hop extract is used in moderation, a most enjoyable finish that is lengthy and complex: there's a crisp, green apple quality with tastes of yeastand bone-dry white wine. The tartness persists throughout, but is always softened by underlying honeyed tones. A refreshing taste of brewing history and well worth the search."
"Further Notes: I made a red raspberry syrup for this beer. I added just a bit (about a tablespoon) to the glass first, then poured the beer into it. It was a spectacular red with a huge, pink foamy head that *never* went away. The sweetness balanced the tartness a bit, but not completely, and the raspberries contributed only mere hints of their flavor. I definitely like it better by itself, but it's worth giving a raspberry syrup a try."
"Note: Drank a lot of Himbeerweiss before I reached the age of majority. May be pre-disposed towards thinking this beer is awesome."
"This beer was my 2nd at the Brick Store in Atlanta, and I picked it mainly for the low ABV since I had a fairly strong beer earlier. They served it in the bottle with a wide mouth glass containing a shot of Raspberry juice. I poured the beer and evaluated it without the raspberry. A definite green apple tartness was evident. It was very crisp with good carbonation. I added the shot of juice to it and the character changed dramatically. The tartness of the beer balanced very well with the sweetness of the raspberry juice. This was a very refreshing beer served this way. Without the shot the beer was good but my tastes don't tend too much toward the tartness that this beer displayed. I would drink it again but not in mass quantities."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Crackly and swift, the mouthfeel here is very much alive... yet the soft, fruity palate eases its effects and it feels totally appropriate. When I read the ABV was 2.5%, I was amazed to find a beer this low in strength... so I wasn't expecting much in the way of character. However, this is delicious and quenching, with effortless drinkability. Very glad to have tried this."
"This is probably not a beer I will have again, but for what it is it is very good. If you are a cider drinker and looking for an introduction into good beer this would be a great starting point."
"I can imagine that this can be enjoyable on a hot summernight, but for me it is just a bit too acidic and empty."
"Cheers!"
"The Himbeer gave it a smoothness and sweet raspberry fruitness and added some complexity to it."
"PROST! Beertracker"
"I like this beer more each sip. It's not great, but it's good and very light. This would make a wonderful summer lawnmower brew."
"Berliner Kindl Weisse pours a pale yellow with a white head from a brown 33cl bottle. Lactic acid is noticeable in the aroma. Well now, that's completely different from any beer I've tried. Quite sour, but not in an offensive way. Not something I'd drink often, but quite interesting. Definitely worth a try, your mileage may vary on this one."
"EDIT: After looking around the apartment for a while, I found some fruit punch, and added about two shots worth into my mostly full glass. I'm quite impressed how well this little amount of sweet juice woke up this beer. Despite the addition of the fruit flavors, this really allows the yeast and wheat flavors to come through, since the tartness has disappeared. Much improved with the little addition of sugar."
"A fantastic summer time refresher, although for the uninitiated it doesn't seem like beer at all. A sour, tart beer, generally served in a squat glass with red raspberry or green woodruf sauce to offset the tartness. This is the beer to give to people who find most beer too bitter. I have seen different methods for pouring the beer and the sauce, generally with the sauce going in first, followed by the beer. I prefer it poured with a thick head and the sauce over. The beer stays a little more tart, while you get a slightly sweeter head. The two mix in your mouth for a subtle difference over the sauce first method."
"One of my favorites from way back, I would drink this beer anyday. I love this beer with a capitol L, but none of my friends cared for it at all (more for me!) A perfect summertime sipper, and at 2.5% abv, you can drink all you want. Cheers!"
"Extremely drinkable. I could drink these all night, and with the low abv it is a great hot weather beer. I'll often start out a night at the Brickstore in Atlanta with one of these just to quench my thirst and prime my palate for some serious lambics."
"Bar none, there is no beer I'd rather session on a hot summer day. Perfectly clean and crisp; refreshing and enjoyable. The perfect beer for summer, and better without syrup, in my opinion. Although pricey, well worth the refreshment when the temperature climbs."
"My biggest regret is not buying this the first time I saw it at a local shop. It can be very hard to find, even in larger cities. I have never had Schultheiss, but I will definitely pick it up if I have the chance. Some have claimed it has a more complicated set of flavors, but I'll have to see for myself."
"Drinkability is ok, it would be a great cooler in the summer heat. This is not my first choice taste, but some may have it. It was not foul or offensive just not a style I like at first. Kind of like Corona or an american wheat with lots of lemon. I would try it again. MK"
"Overall, a refreshing low ABV beer that is perfect for a hot summer day. However, the tartness diminishes the drinkability."
"Light mouth with prickly carbonation. Very drinkable and I will buy more as this could be the ultimate summer session brew."
"i've never had a beer like this, but i suppose i like it (it certainly is quite the session brew, though i couldn't deal with a night of drinking fruit beer). it's not something i'd drink often but i'm headed to germany this summer and i can imagine the appeal of sipping this in a cafe at lunch"
"Edit: Tried this from a bottle, without syrup. Very interesting sour flavor. I prefer it with just a small amount of the green syrup, as opposed to raspberry."
"I'd be interested to try this with raspberry or woodruff syrup, but honestly I wouldn't be expecting much. It's just a light refreshing substitute for water or a wine cooler. Basically this is a novelty that's only made for beer nerds still interesting in trying the style. An endangered species kept alive at a the beer zoo."
"Sharp acidic aroma. Apple or grape-like fruity aromas hint of hard cider, but not exactly. Perhaps better described as floral? Basically clear with slight haze, pale yellow color, small lingering head. Tastes like it smells. Sharp sourness, with light fruitiness, sourness lingers well into the finish, and as the sourness fades it gives way to a bready, wheat flavor. No hop character whatsoever. Medium-light body. High carbonation and acidity seems to increase perception of mouthfeel. All in all, Ive never had a beer quite like this before, and might never have the chance again. I enjoyed it. It was definitely an experience to remember. I dont think Id buy a case of the stuff, but it might be nice to sample on occasion. I mixed the last few gulps with a few drops of raspberry liqueur now that was tasty! Still very sour, but the little sugar helped balance out some of the acidity. Thats the way to drink it. Its good on its own, but better with some flavor to balance out the sourness."
"Pale dull yellow. Slight off white head. Not a lot of carbonation looks to be present. Aroma is lemony, tart, citric and tangy. Wow is this some interesting stuff. Only 2.5%?? The flavor is tart and a little sour, but not overly so. It adds some refreshing qualities. Tangy wheats add some quenching ability as well. Lemony qualities. Carbonation is nice. Body is almost medium. This is pretty good. I keep drinking it."
"This brew pours a clear straw color with a greenish tint, and a lot of visible carbonation. The head is two-fingers in height and recedes quickly. The aroma is sour and almost lambic like, with some tartness too. The taste is quite impressive for a beer with so little alcohol...quite impressive for any beer actually. It is like a mild unblended-lambic, with equal parts sour and tart. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with lively carbonation. Overall, I am very impressed with this brew."
"I hate to tell my friend that I think his beer is soured. Although deliberate, this is soured beyond what sour beers normally display. Lemony and musky in the aroma with a sharp and thin scent. Flavors of lemon-heads and lemon rinds with a vineous astringency. Thin and light on the palate with a puckering sensation all through the mouth. Highly carbonated and dry despite the low alcohol. Clean and crisp, yet tough to drink. A murky yellow, high carbonated beer with a whallop of a punch. A treat for the serious beer drinker."
"Move along!"
"First time trying this style (how many of this type could this be?). At 2.5% ABV, i'm not sure sure how many I could drink on a hot summer day. I think the tartness would get to me before that, however. Dry and to the point, this could be a favorite among those looking for a half beer/ half wine cooler. Cool looking bottle."
"Body is razor thin, as it is supposed to be but it just feels like club soda in my mouth. Airey, light texture. I could see this as a summer quencher, nothing else."
"My first Berliner Weisse I have tried not the season for them but available,poured a lighter straw color with a fizzy quick to vanish head.Hmm quite lactic and tart like green grapes aroma wise almost a gueze-likeness to it with the grapeskin and lactic thing going on,quite sour upfront on the palate with a touch of iron but drys out in the finish with a hint of wheat.Not fond of the fizzy,thin mouthfeel I know its very low in alc.A summer quencher yeah I can see it but not something I would try again."
"Drinkability: Berliner Kindl Weisse weighs in at a very conservative 2.5% abv, making this an easy session beer. When paired with Himbeer Getrankesirup (raspberry syrup, this is the authentic German syrup available at Wells Discount Liquors), this ale takes on a much sweeter character in which the syrup balances out the lactose."
"This one certainly caught me off guard, as I was totally unfamiliar with this style. Part of the Beeradvocate experience is the adventure of sampling new styles such as this one. A low alcohol bier that is totally different than any other style, yet is well made and quite enjoyable. Lemony and green apple tartness, with airy carbonation and a light body give this one an excellent drinkability."
"I wasn't quite sure what to expect from this little bottle of Berliner Kindl Weisse. Now that's it's gone, I'm still not sure how I feel about it. I like sour in all its forms, but this beer seemed to lack something essential (probably the syrup). I'm glad for curiosity's sake that I gave it a try, but I doubt there will be any more Berliner weissbiers in my future."
"Overall: I can see sucking back many of these on a warm day. Despite the beer's diminutive size (2.5 abv), there is a load of flavor to go around. A very charming beer."
"330 ml bottle. The joy of trying a new style of beer. The Berliner Kindl Weiss pours out a a very clear, light color with a rapidly diminishing white head. The aroma is wheat with sour apple fruitiness. Sour lemony flavor, so that at first you can just barely taste the wheat. Tart apple skins. More wheat flavor in the finish. No hop flavor at all. A little bit salty. Fuller mouthfeel than I expected. Great drinkability. I would think that fans of sour beers would enjoy this. I would like to try another example of the style for comparison."
"330 ml bottle, bought in Bier Spezi Hamburg. ABV is 2.7%. I had no raspberry syrup available, so I drank it straight. Extremely pale straw coloured, nearly clear, just a very slight haziness. Enormous to moderate head. Unusual funky aroma - sea water / seaweed, notes of barnyard, horseblanket and rotting citrus. Very sour / acidic flavour, but not as extreme as I expected. Lemony notes. Light bodied, watery mouthfeel despite the acidity. Refreshing, but I find very little complexity here. Moderate lemony aftertaste."
"I give it high drinkability... I like this stuff. I could do lots of it... and with an ABV of 2.5%, it would be easy."
"Berliner Weisse are classic thirst quenchers and thus popular in Summer ... highly sour and refreshing .... since Napoleon invaded Berlin some 200years ago it seems to have the nick ""Berlin Champagne"" (not sure the reference was made to the same beer) ... Berliner Kindl is the bigger of the two big Berlin breweries, their Weisse has a hoppy smell and tastes somewhat like tangerines kept in a saucer full of fresh lemon juice .... mix it with woodruff of rasberry syrup and you have the perfect drink for a summer afternoon ..."
"D- This is a very dynamic beer for having only 2.5 % ABV. It has lots of characteristics that are not common to most beers. It has some good ""wild"" beer notes but it would be nice to see more of them. I do prefer them red or green with the syrups but it is refreshing on its own."
"An interesting beer that I must try again on a really hot day. The expense of this beer makes it hard to justify buying a whole 6 pack."
"Light gold in colour and well carbonated with a slightly floral aroma along with some white grapefruit notes. Very sour citrus flavor with a lactic note and a short finish. Light mouthfeel. I normally enjoy sour flavors, and weizens are a favorite style of mine, but this one was a little too astringent to fully enjoy, and didn't have much complexity either."
"Sourness & acidity confirmed. Tart lemony tinge throughout. Quick dry finish, with a little bit of flintiness. Oddly refreshing. Light & spritzy. A thirst quencher."
"I wish there were more versions of this style available in the states, but this is the only one I've come across. I guess this could easily be considered a child's drink especially if you mix with syrups, but I'd still like to see where else this could go."
"Man, this is an odd brew. Really different. Poured out to a nice light yellow color with a touch of cloudiness. No lace, but the head hung around for a bit. Odors of sweet malt and grain were noted. Flavor was very odd, sour and tart. This beer is sometimes mixed with flavored syrup, and I can see why, as on it's own it's not that great. Finished like balsamic vinegar. I would try this beer again if I had some of those syrups i've heard about. Not one of my favorites, but worth a try when you want to sample something different."
"Because of the high acidity the head went poof but the slightly sour nose was always prominent. I tried the beer straight, with Woodruff syrup and Raspberry syrup. The straight beer is straw yellow and very sour with that lacto finish. The woodruff has a cloying medicinal flavour and I found hard to finish. The Raspberry is the most pleasing with the sweetness helping overcome the tartness. To be honest this is a hard to love style of beer as the high acidity plays havoc with your digestion and finding the syrups is difficult at best."
"Pours with just a little more pigment than a Michelob Ultra, which places it just on the yellow side of water. Half inch head with some sticky lacing. Nose was mellow with just a hint of the wheat used to brew this. Ah, the flavor, first taken sans syrup. My lips folded into my mouth as the alum forced a major pucker. Very very lemony. I ordered with an apple syrup flavor also. The blend was very smooth, sweet and sour mix, like a beery soft drink. I could see the flavored version being a favorite quencher in lieu of a heavier beer or an overly fruity lambic. Mouthfeel (w/ syrup) is medium and satisfying. Drinkability (w/ syrup) is very good. I recommend that you at least give one a sip without the syrup, but to really enjoy, do as the locals apparently do and add the flavor."
"I drank this in the absence of any flavouring as is traditional, but I still really enjoyed it. It was my first experience with the style, and overall, I have to say I like it. It's very drinkable and refreshing on a hot day."
"Raspberry version at Winking Lizard. Light yellow/golden color with a thin and bubbly white head. Thin, spotty lacing. Tart fruit and raspberry aroma. Light body with a sour character and citrus/raspberry flavor. Very little wheat to be found. The finish is dry, fruity and astringent. Below average all around."
"Drinkability is slightly above average. The low ABV and refreshing nature of the beer make it drinkable, but I think after more than a couple the acidity and sourness might wear on the palate. Overall I would recommend this especially on a hot day."
"Thin silky head on a grey yellow color body. The smell seems like a mix of straw, whole milk and citrus, with notes reminiscent of a barn. Intriguing and interesting. The taste is fresh, citric with a dry malty character. The mouthfeel is very smooth and velvety, reminding me of oatmeal. After the specific Berliner taste thats sour, acidic and slightly vinegary but controlled and enjoyable, the aftertaste is slightly grainy like in many German pilsners, but I find it quite enjoyable here, as it adds to the refreshing character of the brew. Surprizingly drinkable!"
"Amazingly some tartness still comes through in this beer despite the sweet raspberry syrup. A unique and satisfying beer drinking experience."
"11.2oz. bottle poured into a short stubby Berliner Weisse glass. It pours a medium gold color with one finger of head that dies off quickly. There is little lacing. The smell is slightly spicy, and has some tart grape character to it. The taste is fairly tart, with lots of sweet maltiness trying to balance it out. Almost puckering sour, but very refreshing. I think it would match nicely with pizza. The mouthfeel is fairly thick, something you wouldn't expect for this type of beer (especially with only 2.5% abv). The drinkability is good due to the low alcohol and cooling sensation that it brings to the palate. Decent beer!"
"Big fizz, sour and puckering, a mineral wash of subtle fruit and wheat. Slightly dry finish, acidic and very refreshing. Why ruin this with syrups?"
"Drinikability: Not something I would like to have again, somewhat skunky."
"Pours with a one-finger white head that fades quickly leaving no lace. Cloudy amber color with some yeast left in the bottle. Light bodied and medium carbonation. Nose is a sweet malt and yeasty . Starts with some sweetness but the sourness quickly dominates, a clean, tart vingear finish. A different wheat. $2.95 for a 330ml bottle from Colonial Spirits Acton, MA."
"At just 2.7% abv, this prototypical classic Berliner weisse is an incredibly refreshing and drinkable ale! Its just slightly hazy straw gold body displays its delicately effervescent bubbles beneath a short head of bright white. The head retention is limited but it does leaves some nice lace about the glass. The nose offers lightly tart wheat and nothing else, which is basically what's found in the flavor! There's very little bitterness at all, but it's not needed as the mild acidity dries it out! It's basic but interesting; and absolutely thirst quenching and drinkable!"
"It has a lovely sourness like good apple cider vinegar. Right off the bat I'm surprised with the body. It's certainly a light beer, but it has great presence on the palate. Good mouthfeel. It has a mineral taste reminiscent of club soda. The sourness doesn't linger. Some ceylon cinnamon. Wow, this is quenching, quaint and quaffable. A new beer family for me, and I like it! No, I love it!! I really need to drink a case of this...at 2.5% I could, and then I would try the syrup."
"My first berliner weisse, so lets see what this has in store for me. I tried to order this at the German place in town, but they insisted that I have a syrup in it and I wanted to have it without. It pours a slightly hazy straw yellow color with a small head that falls to coat the top. The nose is slightly grainey, slightly lemoney tart. Okay. The flavor is pretty darn interesting. Lemoney sour/tart hits first with an understory of grainey, but not harsh, flavors. Interesting beer. I find it very refreshing. The feel is thin with a very big carbonation. I could sit down to a few of these on a warm summer night. Enjoyable, smooth, easy to drink. Nice brew."
"Well, this is interesting. don't think I have ever had a beer into which you are supposed to pour syrup. poured into its own special glass (flat bottom, extremely wide and short) green or raspberry syrup on the side. The sour smell is very sour, which I was warned about. Tried it without the syrup. Yup, Very sour. So experimented with the syrup (the green). Poured some in, swished around, tasted. Hum. Alittle more, try again. Ok. Alittle more. Well, this is an interesting beer. I really don't know how to score the taste, as it was not good, too sour, but by the bottom of the glass, alittle too sweet. In between, it was good. Plenty bubbly felt good too. But just too damn much work to be drinkable."
"Drinkability- Well, I guess no need to try anymore of this style, or at least this brand. Too out there more me. Almost tasted a bit salty."
"Overall, as I said it's an interesting flavor, although I can't imagine having this one again any time in the near future. Sure glad I tried it though."
"Nose is sour, grainy and greenmalty alltogether intresting and good for the low amount of alcohol. Taste is also sour, malty, clean but without to much body what influences the mouthfeel negative. Aftertaste is good fresh and litle sourish again but not overdone. Good beer for warm sunny days."
"Overall: my first for the style. Striking similiarity to geuze but lighter."
"As far as the taste goes, it is a verrry sour apple taste. Not much else to it. I wouldn't even be able to begin to pick apart the maltiness/hoppiness of it all, not to mention the different yeast esters and whatnot since the sour apple was all I could taste. I was hoping for something much more drinkable, especially considering the extremely low ABV. I had a bad enough time trying to finish the bottle though. I had hoped to move on from Belgians to German beer, but I don't think this was the right choice for the job. I could easily say this is the second most disgusting beer I've had next to the Petrus Pale Ale but only because I was able to finish this one since it was slightly less acidic tasting. I don't know what I'll do with the remaining 5... perhaps try to pawn them off on my friends, or of course I would trade to somebody on this sight who actually likes it (afterall, this is one of the last batches of of the Berliner Kindle Weisse you will likely see, and I'd rather somebody who enjoys it have the pleasure of finishing the last batch)."
"This is a nice beer. Poured clear, bright and light. Yellowy light and golden color. Thin head at first then dissapeared. The aroma has a distinctive sour lemony hay note. Very pleasant and appetizing. Like a lemon lime spritzer. The taste is light and appealing. I once had this beer in Berlin with raspberry juice and it was burned into my memory as one of my favorite beer experiences. This brings me back a little. The sourness in the taste is refreshing. It's just right. Not too puckering or overwhelming. It borders on lambicville. Overall, this is another fine beer experience. Maybe better enjoyed as a hot day thirst quencher and not a cold snowy day beer!"
"Pours a pale straw color with a light white head that leaves just a slight lace. Green apples mixed with a tart and sour tone make up the aromas of this brew. Initial flavors are a spritzy mix of sour apples and slight wheat tones, with a tart and slight acidic finish. The mouthfeel to this brew was somewhat dissapointing because the body was quite thin, but this is probably due to the low alcohol levels of this brew, and its usage as a thirst quencher. Overall an enjoyable brew for a hot summers day but this isn't currently doing it for me, considering it is 4 degrees outside right now."
"Yep. It's a little puckering. Lambic/gueze-like in its tart, sourness. Kinda like lemon juice too. I can see why the Berlin folk often add syrup. But at the same time, I'm glad to be trying this in its raw form. Stays tart, but a traces of mellow wheat/cereal malt poke through before, and into, the finish. Lacks complexity, but I guess it's only 2.5% abv. Light body, with lots of carbonation. Would be quite refreshing if it weren't so tart. I wouldn't drink this every day, but I do like it."
"the first, and only (as of yet) berliner style weiss i've had. incredibly drinkable. all i can think of is a hot summer day. forget those pilsners. much more drinkable than belgian wits, yet lighter than regular german weiss beers. there is zero hints of those expected phenols from german wheat beers (which i love). yet i was fully satisfied with what this beer had to offer. not much head to speak of, nor much aroma. only a slight citrus\sour note, a bit tart. this beer is delicious. toms of flavor; tart citrus such as grapefruit, lemon, with a lovely sour\dry finish. lingers in your mouth begging for one more. probably one of the best ""hot day"" session beers ever. i will keep in mind to try more beers of this style."
"Drink this bad-boy COLD. As it warmed, it became almost too acidic. Odd little beer, but I might drink again...kind of like Zotz candy in a beer."
"Drinkability  This is not even close to what I was expecting. I dont know why I even finished the bottle."
"What a strange brew. Pours out a very pale yellow/golden color with a nice head that wears off eventually. Smell consisted of lemon aromas, some slight yeast, sour like, almost on the border of geuze/lambic with the sour aromas. Taste was a little weird. Huge lemon flavors rush towards the palate with some tart flavors mixing in as well. Finishes on the clean side to my surprise. A little spritzy as well. I have to try a few of these to see if I like this beer or not. A really ""out there"" style."
"This is one of two beers I pored out in my life due to taste. Two friends also refused to adopt the glass after they tasted it. It seems that many really enjoyed this beer, but I will not be visiting it again nor can I recommend it."
"What is the intent of this beer? I could see draining a few after a brisk Summer hike, but the sourness might tear your throat up quick. Perhaps a rinse for potatoe salad, cold brats and mustard."
"with deli havarti melted onto crusty bread - lecker!"
"My first berliner weisse, so I don't have much to compare it too. Poured slightly cloudy and somewhat grassy yellowish color. A bone white, very compact head, with tight little bubbles of carbonation. Flavor was almost non-existant with just a slight fruitiness to it. No real grain flavor but I detected a little oxidation so I'm not sure of the freshness, but it was well within the drink by date on the bottle. Crisp spritzy mouthfeel that ended with a sour/tart bite. Not that impressed, but its probably better when fresh and I will seek out others within the style."
"Pours a lightly hazy yellow-straw color and is topped by a white head and a fairly low level of carbonation. A sour lemony aroma rises up to my nose. There is a hint of complexity in the nose, some herbal grassiness perhaps. This is very dry, and not nearly as sour as I was hoping. It is quite soft up front, but has a sharp sourness in the finish that is reminiscent of fresh lemonade. Though light bodied, there is a certain amount of creamy fullness to this beer. Certainly this is nice and refreshing, but lacks a certain complexity that I like and can be found in Schultheiss' version."
"The beer after disemboguing from the 11.1 ounce light brown bottle into my Berlin Kindl Weisse glass a somewhat luteolous color, the head is modest in size and evaporates quickly leaving a velum like film to cover the glass. Nose is citrus crisp, sweet and sour, light hints of yeast, start is quite sour as I tried it with out the syrup, light malt profile, the top skimpy in its feel. Finish is astringent, dry as a desert bleached bone, the hops quite mild, all in all not a bad, maybe I need to add a touch of Raspberry syrup as I was advised."
"Drinkability is low for me...perhaps high for others but this isn't my thing...I have no interest into delving deeper into this beer style...this seems one dimensional, and I don't care for that dimension....more power to you if you enjoy this style, it's just not for me...I think this beer is pretty true to style and a decent example from what I've read..."
"Thie beer pours very light in color although it is more Amber than it is Hoegaarden gold. It has a medium frothy head and smells of wheat and alcohol. It tastes of medium bitnerness with a heavy wheat flavor, like an excellent American wheat but not really like most Belgian whites that I have had. Weisse is very light and drinkable, though and I will probably have another on account of its smoothness."
"I had to try this beer after reading some about the style, I don't know if there will be another time when I get to try this style. The beer poured a pale golden color with a small fizzy head that went down to a mm size above the beer. Lots of bubbles raced to the top and they continued to do that for almost the whole time. The smell was quite sour and a bit wheaty. The taste was not near as sour as the smell. I still noticed the sourness but it wasn't like a gueze. The body was extremely light and airy. That left for an odd sensation of lightness combined with a sour aspect, I have never really experienced that. There was a slighly wheaty undertone to this beer as well. I actually really enjoyed it and would recommene everybody to try this once. Personally I don't see how the syrup would help this beer at all. It is so light that it seems like syrup would oversweeten it imo. The only true drawback to this beer is the price $3.29 for 11.2 oz. Is that normal!? Seemed a little outrageous (esp for a 2.5% abv beer). Still, I am glad i had it."
"It is a very easy to drink beer. Like I said though, just understand before drinking it that it is a sour mashed brew."
"I'd recommend you try this beer as long as you know what to expect."
"Really an unique and enjoyable beer. Doesn't have to be just for summer. If it wasn't so expensive I'd buy it with some regularity."
"Mouthfeel is excellent, as the low level of carbonation just prickles through to provide some respite from the acidity, but doesn't overwhelm the very modest malt content. Very drinkable, and in quantity. A really pleasant companion for fatty sausage or cold cuts. 330 ml bottle. Best before date of 06/06."
"Poured a light yellow prior to the syrup (green) being mixed. Color became light chartreuse with a full white head and fine carbonation. Head dies quickly and there is little lace. The aroma is tart and yeasty with some aroma hops. The flavor is tart and lemonade like (but low one sweet). Some hop bite follows up. Mouthfeel is tart and effervescent. A fun and refreshing beer."
"Well, this is interesting. Small bottle, small alcohol content, served with raspberry syrup. Is this really beer? Pours a very pale yellow with a white foamy head that stuck around for a while. Did not get much lace though. Could not find much of a smell. The taste is primarily one sensation, sour. This stuff will make you pucker. I could say however that it was refreshing. This would be good to revisit in the summer. Even though it was so sour, I found it to be drinkable. The syrup was a nice touch, but I could have this plain. This was a very interesting experience. This beer can make you appreciate the wide arrays of taste that beer has to offer."
"This is the first beer that I have ever had with syrup. I drank this beer with a sour apple syrup. Its kind of hard for me to say what I think about this beer since its not really the conventional beer. Also, I have only tried it once and with the syrup so I couldn't tell you how it tastes straight from the bottle. The taste of it the way I had was sour and obviously fruity. It basically tasted like candy and not like a beer. I do, however like sour drinks and can't knock the taste. It was good for the experience but I'll have to try it without the syrup next time."
"Small, 11.1 oz. bottle. This is the first time I had a beer of this style. Poured a nice fill head that lasted a few minutes. Very clear, pale yellow color. Not much smell, picked up some malt as it warms. Taste,sour. Not bitter, more like a lemon. It almost makes you pucker up you lips. On a hot day, you would think you're drinking lemonaide. After you get past the initial sour shock, it's not hard to drink. At the low ABV, this could be a good hot day, drink more then a few, beer."

"Pours a light, golden and crystal clear liquid. The head is a puffy, white, initially towering foam. The head quickly settles into stillness. Aroma is an intense and familiar wheat beer twang. Lemon rind and citrus are quite serious in the smell. Taste is slightly sour throughout...very refreshing. Light, sprtzy, and very drinkable. This would be fantastic on a dusy, dry, hot day."
"This is the epitome of Berliner Weiss."
"light blond active liquid with a big bubbled head. a faint scent of wheat and corn husks, sugary sweet corn and butter. the flavor starts kind of like white vinegar and gets some wheat and grain on it in the middle but then tarts up like crazy and eventually leaves a bit of dry white wine flavors (pinot g or dry reisling) on the palate. the mouthfeel was bubbly and filling, active and refreshing. i didn't use any syrups or added flavorings but that might be a good idea, this was one unique beer. i had to think that the drinkability was average depending on the mood...when are you going to get in this mood, maybe never but it was a good beer all said and done."
"Drank clean. Pours a slightly hazy golden, with a small white head that quickly rushes to leave nothing behind. Aroma is strongly sour and citric. Flavor follows, with a mouth-puckering sourness, and bone dry finish. The sourness of this medium bodies brew sticks around forever. I can see this being somewhat refreshing if mixed with a syrup or something to offset the overpowering sourness."
"With raspberry syrup for sodas/coffee: Just a little splash made it nice and smooth. Though pinkish, of course, the tartness remaining gave it an edge over most raspberry beers. Probably might even be well matched with a 7-up."
"Wow, never ever thought I'd Review a 2.5% ABV Beer !!!"
"Bright white foamy head, fades fast, leaves no head. Incredibly clear light wheat colored beer. Smells a little sour. Tart lemon flavor is dominant, there's a light weisse flavor in there somewhere. The body is very thin and the aftertaste is dry. Definitely wasn't expecting the tart flavor, but it's quite enjoyable."
"Cheers!"
"This beer poured a clear, fizzy, yellow color with tall, creamy, white foam that clung to the glass a little bit. The smell was citrusy, with wheat, malt, and a very faint hint of sulfur(?). Overall not an unpleasant aroma. The taste was sout/tart with light malt, and a light fruitiness and some citrus. There was no hop presence detectable. There was a lingering slight tartness. The mouthfeel was smooth and tart, with thin body but good carbonation. This was a fairly refreshing wheat beer, but with thin body. I would like to sample it with some added fruit syrup."
"With the addition of the traditional raspberry syrup the beer was nicely completed. Only a sour and even beer like this could handle the addition of a high concentration and not throw strange flavors, though Id prefer without."
"Originally sampled on 22 February 2003. I am writing this review from my notes. It poured crystal clear pale yellow (the lightest colored beer I've ever seen) w/ a big white head fully of tiny bubbles. The flavor starts out very tart, but finishes smoothly. It's an interesting beer to try. One of these days, I'll try it w/ the syrup."
"Squat bottle with glass that is not quite brown and not quite green - olive? Should have gone with brown - aroma had a slightly skunked smell, but not enough to be off-putting. Hazy straw color. My first true sour wheat style (although I've had some wheats that turned out that way unintentionally). Lemony, mouth-puckering sour! Like wheat beer dosed with ascorbic acid, or sweet-tart candy. But I like it! Perfect for afternoon lounging on the patio - very refreshing. Despite the sourness, it finished quite clean and dry, and was most drinkable. A touch of the light-struck aspect turned up again at the finish, but I'm sure this would not be the case with a sample handled with more respect during shipping."
"I don't really know what to make of this, that subtle hit of sour is pretty much the only thing i liked about this, very light texture, with little development of any flavour, like sour lemonade, with a touch of grainy malt. My first Berliner weisse, and i'm a bit let down and confused."
"My wife is from Germany and this is the only bier she drinks except for an Altbier with fruit in it which is known as an Altbier Bowle. Anyway I tried one in Germany a couple years ago dut didn't really remember it that well until tonight when I finally located a six pack and the authentic raspberry syrup that is served with it. The beer is very light in color and looks almost like an american lager. I tried it first without the raspberry and found it very tart and sour with a hint of citrus and apple. Not really refreshing in anyway for me. Next we added the syrup and mixed it up. About 2 oz. seemed like the right amount. The combination of tartness and sweetness is a nice blend. This time I taste green apples. This is a most unusual drink and is worth trying once. It is also served with a green syrup made with the herb woodruff. My scoring is based on the beer with raspberry syrup added."
"I like it."
"This poured with a voluminous white rocky head over hazy yellow-gold liquid. Nose is lightly fruity and sharp smelling with fresh overtones. Taste is shockingly tart with up front acidity (I chose to review it ""straight up"" without added fruit syrup) and a short musty note that came and went. Fleeting bit of malty mouthfeel, but that too, quickly fades. Finishes fast and clean with a refreshing quality with no one dominant feature taking charge."
"Very pale. Not as pale as a Belgian wit, but paler than most other German wheat beer styles. The head is bright white and builds easily but fades to nothing just as easily. This really is a tart beer, as tart as an average lambic (maybe not quite). The tartness fades quickly to a wheaty finish. Clean, crisp, dry in flavor, but wet and tingly on the tongue. Easy-drinking and light but not exciting."
"Pale gold in color with a slight orange hue.  Bubbly white head that leaves a nice lace down the glass.  Aroma is filled with tangy citrus and wheat.  Nice wheat flavor with a dry finish.  Some sweet grapefruit is event but VERY subdued.  Goes down real easy.  An enjoyable brew, but there are better beers out there."
"I'm with VENOM on this one - who needs syrup? I had the grenadine at the ready, but there's no way it ever hit the glass."
"and it's hardly a beer with 2.5% abv. I'll stick with the better tasting full flavored Hefe's in the summertime."
