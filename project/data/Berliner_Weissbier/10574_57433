3.94,3.4,4,3.75,4,4,4,"Light orange in color, slightly hazy. Small head quickly dissipates to a ring around the glass. Aroma is wheat, grass, a slight sour citrus note.

Lighter bodied with moderate carbonation. Overall, this is a very good beer and unlike anything I've ever had up to this point.

4.16,9.2,4,4.25,4.25,4,4," The flavor is very interesting and has lots of malt complexity yet only light sweetness more earhty and high smoke presence with aromatics of wood in the taste and not charred or overly heavy like a briquette -or campfire smokiness, a very well integrated smoke in the malt which has a nice caramel accent which adds to the yeast flavor with tangy taste yet there is a mild herbal quality with dry toasty layers of wood in the finish. Overall I loved this -I think it is great since it combineds some of the elements of a sour wheat with a smoked beer in a way that enhances the blend with sour-dough bread with smoked grain kind of complexity and it is just excellent with lots of interesting and complex elements that work well together. I recommend this .","Slatetank","May 29, 2014"

I have never tasted a combination such as this and I applaud German brewers who step outside the tried and true styles that dominate the country.","canucklehead","Apr 07, 2014"

Mild aroma of lemon, white grapes and slight biscuit malt, faint smoke. Flavor is tart lemon, apple and grape juice up front, very tart at first, but soon ameliorated by smoky dry light fruit. Light bodied. An interesting take on the Berliner style. The flavor was almost to tart at first, but does mellow in the finish, althoug it leaves a lingering lactic tart and smoke aftertaste. Flavors are tart, but not intense. Although tart beers are not my style, I enjoyed this. I would have liked a bit more smoke presence, although the smoke does make this beer stand out.

4.34,13.9,4,4.25,4.5,3.75,4.5,"Thanks to Sebastian for breaking this out. Sampled on 4/10/2013 at Braustelle and described as a smoked Berliner Weisse. Pours a burnt orange hue with a 1/8th inch, loose, bright white head. Nose expresses citrus notes, primarily tangerines, yeast and candied fruit. Taste reveals slightly soured tangerines, the merest suggestion of smoked malt, apricot and a hint of lactose towards the finish. Mouthfeel is light-medium in body with a mild carbonation and a slightly milk texture. Not really spot on for the style, but amazingly drinkable; just a touch of sour and goes down extremely easy.","Jwale73","May 02, 2013"

Body is creamy with a cream flavor and light sourness in the finish with moderate carbonation. Body is a bit full and carb a touch low.

3.39,-11,4,3.75,3,4,3.25,"Gotta give it up for the resurrection (of sorts) of a nearly-lost style. This stuff pours a hazy pale straw topped by a finger of white foam. The nose comprises mildly-tart lemon zest, light coriander, light black pepper, light cracked wheat, and a hint of beech smoke in the background. I may or may not get a hint of juniper in there as well, but it's hard to tell for sure. The taste brings in more of the same, but that smoke is a bit more intense now; not very much, frankly, it's still just a minor pall on the absolute range, but it's enough to effectively color the second half of the proceedings here. Normally, I'm all for smoke like this, often even stronger, but here it begins as a clashing partner with the lemony bits and then as a silencer, a deadener, of the same. Things just don't work all that well together on my tongue. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a drying finish. Overall, an interesting beer, for sure, but one that just doesn't quite do it for me.","TMoney2591","Mar 27, 2013"

There are hundreds of years of German brewing history behind us, and I'd love to see more of these styles revealed. Hedonistically, the beer is also a treat. It offers both tartness and smokiness, two fairly unique characteristics these days, but at moderate, very accessible levels. It's interesting and entertaining, as well as refreshing and satiating. Absolutely worth seeking out!","NeroFiddled","Mar 06, 2013"

3.88,1.8,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Enjoyed while attending Cantillon Zwanze Day 2012 at Avenue Pub as a pre-game to the event! Served from tap into a Duvel sampler. Poured a hazy pale golden yellow with a half finger white head that subsided to a minimal amount slowly. Maintained phenomenal lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, smoke, sour, and earth. The flavor was of sweet malt, sour, toasted malt, smoke, and earth. It had a light feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this was a fairly good brew. This brew really had quite a bit of potential. The aroma was about the only letdown here as it was rather weak. I basically had to bury my nose into the beer to pick up on anything. While this was a little bit of a buzzkill, the flavor did recover from this. The toastiness actually went decently with the sour note I picked up on. The smokiness just took it to another level on top of that. A really well done brew that I would definitely take the time to explore again.","thagr81us","Dec 19, 2012"

3.59,-5.8,3,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"this is unique like no other, so bonus points there. it is a smoked berliner weiss, which as far as i know, hasnt been done too commonly. it pours hazy light brown without much head. a little watery and kind of yellow to. weird. the nose is rauchbier smokey, intense in that way, over the lemon peel acidic bitterness of a normal berliner weiss. an odd fusion of styles for certain. the flavor is overly smoked, dominates the subtle fruit notes. acid and smoke are also strange bedfellows, and im not sure it works. feel works though, maybe a little thin on body, even for the style, and the carbonation isnt as bright as id like it to be. i appreciate the attempt here, but it didnt exactly click in my opinion. the smokey citrus tart beer is an odd blend. worth a try though i suppose, because there is nothing else like it out there.","StonedTrippin","Oct 11, 2012"

Everything about this brew is bigger than the Abraxas; the carbonation, the residual malt inclusion, the alcohol, etc. The smoke and tartness are just as evident as the other version but this one just seems to be a bit better blended. The smoke transitions to tart a bit better with the more solid grain inclusion that is here. For 6% though, the alcohol is still masked pretty well.
