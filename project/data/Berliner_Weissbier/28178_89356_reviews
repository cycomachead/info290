"Beer is medium-light to light in body, with carbonation of medium intensity, resulting in a mouthfeel that is slightly fizzy (1/5), then becoming somewhat foamy (1/5) and otherwise smooth (3/5). Generally fairly crisp and dry. Closes dry, with light stickiness clinging to the palate and lips."

"O-a pretty nice BW, good flavor, the sediment was excessive and really needed decanting"

"Unfortunately, I was very turned off by the appearance. I think something went wrong with this bottle, because I am not seeing any other complaints. I drank it, but I was so caught up with the sediment that I wouldn't let myself enjoy it to its fullest extent. I could see this being a nice representation of the style, but it was just a miss for me. If I could drink it down without being preoccupied, it would be a very refreshing beer on a warm day."
"Batch 99. bottle picked up about a week ago in a Chicago trip. enjoyed from a pipeworks berliner weiss glass. beer poured such a pale yellow that it looked almost white it had a thin fizzy head that fizzed away quick. smell is super tart and super tangy lemon rind and some sour egg. Fairly cheesy which is a bit off putting. thankfully the cheese is gone in flavor. taste is relatively nice lemon sourness. Some egg, but all in all a very nicr berliner. Perfect for a summer afternoon. Nice fizziness and crisp body."

"O: my first Berliner, so I had no idea what to expect. but his is one beer that I would not buy again to be honest. its simply too bland. definitely look forward to trying more of this style, but I have a strong inclination that this is weak for its style."

"O: A solid representation of the style. Nice sour notes, good lemongrass and wheat backbone taste. Just a really well done Berlinerweisse. So glad to see more US breweries venturing into this style, and Pipeworks have been pumping out some good ones. I suggest picking this up as an intro into sours."
"Pours a murky light yellow with a foamy white head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is sour and tart with malt, grain, and slight fruit aromas. Taste is much the same with sour grain flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of acidity on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that has a better taste over smell in my opinion."
"This is a light bodied brew with a moderate to lower level of carbonation than what is expected in the style. Overall it is not bad. It is not the best ive had in the style nor even close to the worst. Nicely done, I look forward to trying Pipeworks other berliner iterations but seriously, what the hell is going on in the bottom of that bottle..."

"O- This is a nice tart beer but is much softer than it’s Cousins from Berlinne. It has some nice flavor but I’m not sure a 3.4% ABV bomber is worth $10.00. It was also frustrating that I couldn’t even drink the second glass."

"Something different fof Pipeworks, Americo’s bottle. Great hoppy aroma. A creamy head on dark brown. Some chocolate, roasty taste with citrus in the finish. Was expecting more significant sourness in the style.I can only speculate that they purposely concentrated on these other elements."

"O: It's ok. The fruited one is better."

"Overall: This is another great Berlinner Weissbier by Pipeworks. I like it more than blue lady, but its just not near as good as well red temptress. Great to see a brewery in Illinois brewing this beer style and trying different spins on a berlinner especially since you just dont see that many berlinner's on the shelfs in craft beer stores."

"This beer is very interesting as basically a naked Berliner. The tartness attacks your tongue, then some sweetness and bright flavors surround. It's very light and appealing for warm weather. If this is your style, then it should satisfy. If this isn't, then this would be a solid version to try and see if you can develop a taste for it."
""
"Overall: So easy drinking and pleasant. The sourness is very balanced, does not overpower this brew like other sours. Another very unique style that Pipeworks knocks out of the park."

"Hazy, straw-yellow color, with a healthy, fluffy white head that receded to a thin layer of bubbles, leaving some lacing on the glass. Crisp wheat notes in the nose, lemongrass, mineral. Similar taste, lightly toasted wheat and crackery pale malts, lemon zest with a touch of tartness, grassy, a little mineral in the taste as well. Light body, thin, but appropriate for a 3.5% beer, Champagne-like carbonation. Crisp and clean, refreshing, easily drinkable."

"D - A nice session option. I was able to finish the bomber with minimal effort. Nice Berliner, and you get 50% more for the same price as the German ones available here. Would love to see this on-tap in the summer, as I can imagine putting back a few glasses."

"Such an easy drinking and refreshing beer, yet packed pretty well with aroma and flavor given its low alcoholic content. I could put down a bunch of these and still be feeling fine. Keep them coming!"

"O: The acidity level here is at just the right amount, and the mouthfeel is on point as well. I really hope the Pipeworks guys make this often, as this is one of the better berliners I've had in a while."
"(O)- I quite like this one, particularly when its hard to find a good example of this style in the states. Truer to the style than their Blueberry variant, which to me felt more like an american wild ale than berliner. At only 3.5% ABV, sign me up for many more once the weather starts to warm up. And, I was happy with the $9.99 price tag per bottle."
"Drink- I thought it was good. Above average but needed a bit more. I dont know if I like the naked version of the other Berliner Weisses. I will keep drinking and see how it goes."
"If they weren't already doing a good enough job of it, I would be more than happy to write copy for Pipeworks labels. Anyway, this stuff pours a cloudy pale grapefruit juice topped by a finger of relatively short-lived lightly off-white foam. The nose is a simple blast of tart and juicy lemon zest. Things go from straight within-the-rind fruit to lightly-sweetened lemonade. The taste is more single-minded, keeping to the tart and sour track with a hunk-a-hunk-a burnin' vengeance. The body is pretty light, with a light moderate carbonation and a dry, sticky finish. Overall, a highly enjoyable and refreshing little Berliner. Good times. 'Nuff said. Get some."

"A great American-brewed berliner."

"O: A nice beer and a fine example of the style."

"O: An enjoyable Berliner. I must say that I enjoy the fruited Berliner's from PW more, but this was a great take on the style and very true. Extremely easy drinking and I'd love for a re-brew in the summer months to enjoy on a 90 degree Chicago day."
"O- wasn't sure at first how this was going to be at first glance and sniff. But another tasty Berliner from PW. Still enjoy their fruit Berliners more but still solid."

"O- This is awesome, it hits the style perfectly and IMO is way better without any fruit added to it. This is a really refreshing and delicious beer."

"Glad I picked up two of these, and will try to grab a couple more for when spring finally rolls around."
