"My second 12oz. of this particular beer and one of my overall favorites. So refreshing."
""
""
"Low alcohol content, but delicious taste if you like tart. Smell is pleasing, but mouth feel is a bit too bubbly for my preference."
"What an excellent Berliner this is, wonderful stuff."

"This beer has a nice fruity tartness and does seem a bit simplistic in my description but it is a great summer beer that is very quaftable.  It has enough interesting character to make it worth a session."

"Pours a pale straw-yellow in color with a good finger foamy white head that settles down to a very thin layering after awhile with lots of bubbles rising up from the bottom of the glass. Sediment is seen around the bottom of the bottle. Some light streaking lacing is seen when sipped but not a bunch. The aroma is of tart citrus zest. Bit more going on with the taste is it is slightly sour BUT good as this is the style of brew this is. Totally different type of brew but good actually. No bitter or hoppy aftertaste just makes you pucker-up some. Lighter bodied with high carbonation but seems to work for this one. Overall, kinda like this one."

"Overall: I would drink this beer all the time in the summer months. I got this as an extra from a very solid trader and I do appreciate this! Cheers man! I would definitely recommend this beer, very nicely done and I appreciate the opportunity to try it out."
"Not bad for a sour type"

"Bottle as a nice trade extra. Thanks! Pours light yellow, mostly clear, with a giant fluffy, bubbly head on too that recedes quickly. Aroma is lots of vinegar, lemon peel, wheat malts, dry funky tartness. Flavor is lightly tart wheat malt, some hay, dry funk, and a bit of a dirty finish (something that always happens for me with the style). Very light bodied with spritzy carbonation. Overall pretty standard Berliner going on here. Plenty drinkable but there seems to be something missing from this and I don't know what."
"Lemon heads!"

"It's quite flavorful."

"O. A satisfying beer.  Good for a chicken dinner or on a hot summer day.  Not a stick to your ribs beer but very thirst quenching."
""
""

"The nose is lactic acid, citrus, lemon, yeast, berry and wheat.  The flavor is tart, citrus, lemon, a little salt, white pepper.  It isn't mouth puckering, more like noticeably tart.  This is pretty simple, clean, easy to drink.  Almost zero alcohol present.  Pretty good."
""
""
"Overall: very easy to drink but not very sour, would not recommend for those looking for a very tart beer but if you are just getting into sours this is one to try as it has the beginnings of a sour. Parings McRib"

"Overall: This is a really mellow berlinner and I really enjoy it for what it is. I would crush a ton of this beer during the summer time. So many layers of flavors for such an easy drinking beer. This is off colors best beer that is available in 4 packs. I hope to revisit this beer many many times in the future."

"Conclusion: Very tasty representation of this classic style. My first beer from Off Color, and the first I have seen of them in Colorado."
""

"Bottle from Maltitude. Pours hazy gold. Aroma of funk and wheat. Taste of bread and funk. Very lip-puckering sour. Sour aftertaste. Not too shabby"

"Good god, this is amazing.  An EXCELLENT example of a Berliner; fiercely tart, yet robustly malty.  Easily in my top 3 examples of the style."

"This didn't really strike me as a particularly sour Berliner Weisse, but it was still very tasty."

"its becoming too easy and too widely known how to whip up a quick berliner. its not as special as it used to be, and there are lot of real average or even poor ones being acclaimed by people who are just thirsty for a sour beer, so its nice to have a more careful one here. super light, maybe the lightest example of the style i have seen. looks like milky wheat beer, fizzy white but cant hold a head. a fruity nose thats tart but short of sour. white wine aromatics, puckerly lemon flavor, with a fruity middle and a body thinner than water. carbonation is high, and that helps a lot. i like that its as simple as it is, not trying to overdo it, the esters are there, and the lacto mash or kettle sour aspect is there, sweaty and meaty, but the fruitiness balances it all out. i still think the apex is the best beer from off color that i have had, but this is a solid berliner. just hate paying per bottle prices like this for a beer that should be in an affordable twelve pack of cans..."

"Lemon, lactic, and acetic acid dominate the aroma, accompanied by grain and light floral notes. Flavor reveals a light, clean base of crackery pilsner malt, along with a touch of wheat in the finish. Lactic acid lies beneath, in an interesting way. It hits upfront and dissipates as soon as the mouth is opened, but it can linger as long as the mouth is closed. Notes of lemon and acetic acid surface in the aftertaste. Excellent beer. Great restraint in the sour character, as compared to most released these days, but still a flavor punch."

"Bottle. Pours a hazy yellow color. Well built head. Thicker and white. Random lacing. Smells of lacto tartness. Sour lemons. Wheat. Good aromatic intensity. Flavor starts off with initial tartness. It's pretty tart but there is a level of balance with the other flavors. Whet and grains after the tartness. Has a cider element to it. One of the more drinkable takes on the style. The sourness isn't parching like other Berliners. A good amount of body for such a minimal beer."

"I've been working this one over pretty good over the last couple months.  A great summer drinker.  Hell, one I'll probably drink well into the fall as long as it's around."

"O - Well done Napoleonic-Era Berliner Weisse. Solid B-B+. Amazing on hot summer days. Reminds me a lot of 1809 Berliner, but with more spice and less general flavor."
""
""
""
""

"Overall - Well-made.  I always have trouble reviewing base berliners because they just can't be that interesting, but they can still be very good."

"Off Color Brewing Fierce -----4/5."
""
"Off Color tends to lean toward styles rarely seen on the shelves and they also seem to nail each and every one. The wheat is substantial, as it should be, with a bright lemon acidity that's makes the drinkability ridiculous. Honestly, I could drink this stuff all day long. Buy you some."

"Verdict: A very nice Berliner Weissbier from Off Color. It has a nice delicate feel and a gentle softness that is very enjoyable. Definitely a nice refresher of a beer that arrived just in time for the dog days of summer."

"Overall: I'm glad I tried it. For someone looking for a change of pace (such as myself) on a hot, humid summer day(such as today) it's perfect. It wouldn't mind having a couple more of these laying around my fridge. However it's a bit pricey at $8.99 + tax for four 12 oz. bottles. I am aware the style generally boast a lower abv, but I mean come on, I spend that kinda money I want to at least get near a proper buzz. And the thing, while quite tasty, doesn't immediately signal ""beer"" to me. I'm a heavyweight not no featherweight that's just how I get down. I just don't see myself drinking this (or perhaps it's the style) on the reg. 85/100"

"Pours a cloudy yellow with a finger of white head that retains nicely.  Nose features heavy wheaty/bready notes paired with lemon zest, tangy yogurt, and doughy yeast.  Taste starts with a flash of tartness, this is quickly balanced by candied lemon, orange rind, bready wheat, and a dry finish.  Mouthfeel is light and moderately carbonated. Overall, a nice easy drinking berliner."

"Its dry and vinous finish leads to a quick aftertaste, leaving behind a bright limey acidic taste that's beautifully sour and brilliantly clean. Echoes of light bread return long after the taste has concluded. Its simply an excellent thirst quencher."

"Taste follows suit with tart puckering lacto, and a berryish gooseberry note in the middle, it's not sweet but lends a subtle fruitiness. Crisp, tart and dry. Very light and drinkable, it was gone before I blinked twice. Lends itself well to summer six pack drinking."
"Bright straw colored body with a bubbly white head poured on draft. Bright citric/tart punch on the nose. Really well balanced with the tartness of a fresh lemonade and a clean/crisp body. Really well rounded Berliner that is approachable to most palates."
