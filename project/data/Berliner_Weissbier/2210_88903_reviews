"O: Very mellow and well integrated flavors. Subtle overall but fairly complex. I got something new with every sip."

"Overall - It's a little more interesting than a standard berliner.  Brett and oak help it out."

"Pour is pale golden yellow with a small amount of white head.  Nose is heavy leather brett, lactic notes, tons of green apple, oily hops.  Taste is off like the nose, the green apple is completely out of place, the body is syrupy and slick, lactic acid is low, not delicate or to style."

"O- Very good Berliner Weisse; heavier on the oak barrels which isnâ€™t necessarily a bad thing. [4]"

"Loved how the Bretta and how it balanced against the tartness. Great beer."

"O: Base beer for some of the FW sours. Standing alone, this is a bit thin and watery although there is a nice tartness but not too crazy."

"more or less a berliner style beer, just more brett than lacto. still the same pale wheat base, listed on the hops and pie draft list at 4.9% abv, which is far more sizable than the listed content here. seems light though, and so pale hazy in color, caucasian looking beer here, creamy and rich and pale and peachy. the nose is familiar white wheat malt in healty dose, and subtle brett C type yeast, along with mild and immature lacto, which if left to get weird probably would before too long. some sturdy oak on this too, sweet and woodsy, even a hint of sap to it. richer than any berliner weisse on the market, but in the same family, albeit loosely. the development of the wild side of this is extremely pleasant, up there with the other firestone beers, and not all that different from lil opal, although i think i like that one a bit more. this one sits a little heavy at room temperature, and never really gets to the sour level. supremely well made though, and this would surely satisfy any drinking of the lighter side of wild ale. it certainly works for me. thanks to hops and pie on tennyson for making this come to life for me. scrumptious rarity."

"I was largely underwhelmed by this beer, and I'm not sure if that's a function of how it's marketed or if it's just not that great. As a Berliner weisse, it's not very good. It's fairly flat and watery, with minimal tartness. Notes of straw overtake any pleasant maltiness or sour bite it might have had. The brett funkiness is pleasing, but eclipses some of the other notes usually present in a Berliner weisse. Perhaps I expected too much, and maybe I should have adjusted my expectations for something less a Berliner weisse and more a slightly tart saison (which, even then, this wouldn't be a very good example of). It's worth tasting, but I wouldn't return to it."

"Pours a hazy gold with a foamy off-white head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Small streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is slightly sour with malt, grain, spice, lemon, and acidic aromas. Taste is much the same with slightly sour malt and grain flavors on the finish. There is a very mild amount of acidity on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is an above average beer that is drinkable but fairly watery and lacking in sourness."
