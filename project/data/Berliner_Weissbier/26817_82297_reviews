"A light, tart and a slightly salty sour wet sock finish but in a good way as to not overpower.  Could drink this all day."

"Love this beer. My official brew of summer.  Light and refreshing with just the right amount of pucker for a sour.  Sad it won't be back this year but hoping the new sour is even better."

"Golden straw with a pinkish hue to it.  Tons of active carbonation, thin light pink head fades fast and leaves no lacing.  Tart in the nose.  Lemon, sour apple, berry and a little funk.  Tart on the taste, lemon, sour apple, and a hint of mulberry in the finish.  Straight forward but great.  Sharp carbonation carries that tart flavor and gives a highly carbonated feel all the way through the finish and some dryness at the end.  Great beer for the style with a nice twist with the mulberry."

"decent, didn't do it for me but I do like the effort to get different styles out to the people. Liked it up front but the finish lingered a bit too long."

"Can shared at the Swamp Head Batch 600 release. Pours a purplish pink color with a creamy white head on top. Aroma of mulberries, sour vinegar, wheaty malts, and berliner like yeastiness. Flavor follows with big notes of mulberries--wow they go really well in this style--wheat malts, yeasty tart berliner notes, some lemon peel, and some floral notes. Really light bodied with high carbonation. While I’m not a fan of the style generally, this was very nice. I would have it again for sure."

"Overall: A versatile and complex sour that I really enjoyed. The mulberries play well and plenty of other fruit and sweet malts throughout create an exciting experience for the drinker. I think this brew would play well with a newbie to sours or a hardened fan of the tart. Well done."

"O - I haven't had too many Carton beers, but this is definitely one of, if not the best. Boat is awesome as well. Would definitely recommend this batch. Perfect for a nice summer day."
"Pourded into a wine glass, pinkish hued in color, with a half of finger of large white bubbled head. Smells of wheat and not much else. Easy drinking that's for sure. A slight sour crispness to it. Super duper crushable. Don't know what a Mulberry taste like, but there is a little bit of a berry taste to it. This was really nice summer beer. Not super tart, but definitely an above par berliner."

"Bottom Line: Enjoyable beer."
"O: Was not a fan of this brew, but I would say it wasn't terrible, I guess I am not a fan of sour beers, not to hard to drink but just something I didn't enjoy."

"first beer ive ever had with mulberry, and its a low alcohol summer berliner, how perfect! cleverly thought out, and well executed, this pinkish purple pale blonde white beer smells like tart fruit juice and a heavy sour lacto mash. its white wheat, low body, high refreshment, maximum drinkability. this is a perfect summer drink, tart enough to be refreshing without being sour enough to sit weird in the belly or be caustic when it warms up a little. the low abv makes it an all day beer, and i think the pint can is a nice format for it. a touch of white white acidity in the finish, along with the fruit, which i wouldnt immediately identify as mulberry, but it is a little different from other fruits, really juicy and tart. carbonation is medium, but its enough with how light the body is. overall a really fun beer, and a little something different. a great first impression from these guys as well. worth seeking out."

"O - It was a three-hour, one-way drive from my house to the brewery to try this, as well as the other brews on-tap. I also worked in a hike at the beach at nearby Sandy Hook, and then drove back home. I brought back this brew, Boat and 077XX. All are very good, but from a uniqueness standpoint, this stands above the others. I think my wife is really going to like this one when she tries it. I certainly do."

"Overall: Tasty, refreshing and crushable. Sightly weird aftertaste kept it from scoring higher, but this is still a great summer beer."

"The beer is a bit light on flavor, has a tartness of apple cider, but also some funk and wheat of a Berliner weiss."
""
"Had a glass at Good Beer in the East Village. This was a pleasant surprise. I haven't tried many good American-made Berliners, usually they're all bite, without much flavor. This beer, however, had a light creamy malt character with touches of fruit in addition to the well-balanced tart bike. Very cool beer. I hope to find more of this in the summer."

"O: Easy to drink and very refreshing on a hot summer afternoon/evening. I really enjoy this one and could really see myself enjoying quite a few of these. Definitely sessionable."

"Excellent, interesting, tasty berliner. Would happily drink again."
""
""
"Pours cloudy hazy pale yellow gold. Ring of white foam. Peppery/rye like nose. Slight sour taste with a deep bite. Bitter hangs around. Interesting blend of a slight sour taste and a hop. Works very well together."

"Decent Berliner weisse, very much in the organic school of beers."

"Mouthfeel is lighter bodied, but very well carbonated. Highly drinkable and very flavorful. As I drink it I think it would also act as an excellent base for some summer punch."
"O. This is an excellent Berliner. I'm not overly familiar with the style, but this one impresses. It's a great balance between tartness & funk, wheat & sweet. Its low ABV and crispness make this an excellent summer beer. Strong offering here from Carton, and I'm happy to have found this on tap at a local store."

"Medium bodid with some tart, puckering acidity up front that's countered by citrus fruit and sourdough bread notes.  Flavors fall off mid-palate and there is an odd metallic adjunct flavor that overpowers.  Doesn't have traditional characteristics associated with the style. Lacking in bready yeast, fullness in body, lactic funk and wheat beer notes. Kind of bland really with some lactic funk and sour lemon acidity up front."

"O: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, very mild kick, good representation of style, it’s a good beer to drink for a while if you’re in the mood for the style."

"After the fact edit: freaking mulberries! Never would have guessed that based on how it didn't impart any discoloration in the brew."
"o - Overall I was very impressed with this one. An easy to drink berliner that was very reasonbably prices. Not overly sour or funky, but could definitely have a few glasses of it and would like to again."

"Pours straw gold with a small white head. Smells of tart peaches and apples with a slight barnyard ish funk. Taste is slightly tart green apples up front that mellows out to a very nice funky wheat base. Mouthfeel and carbonation are very on point for the style. Overall probably the most refershing thing I could have ordered on this 94 degree nyc day and at 3.9%abv I think I can drink it all day."

"Carton Monkey Chased the Weasel pours a slightly hazy goldenrod, with a wispy bit of white foam lingering for a minute before dissipating. The nose has plenty of lactic tartness, along with a light berry aroma. The flavor profile opens with a touch of wheaty, grainy sweetness. A big lactic sour and funk note comes in next, and fills in the majority of the beer. The finish, where most berliner weissbiers lose me, is saved by a subtle fresh berry note that works very nicely with all that came before it. The body is appropriately light, and the carbonation, which doesn't leap out of the glass, has a certain pep to it. Monkey Chased the Weasel is one of the most enjoyable berliner weissbiers I've had. The addition of mulberries really helps it shine over more traditional offerings."
"O: Overall a fantastic Berliner Weiss. Crisp, flavorful, drinkable, and refreshing. It's so nice to see a local brewery doing a Berliner! Keep up the good work guys."

"Lighter medium body, crisp and bubbly on the tongue - highly refreshing. I was waiting since March to try this and I'm definitely excited about this one. Nice balance between low alcohol, tartness and fruit - I want another growler!"
"Overall this is a super flavorful beer for being so light in ABV. I normally am not a fan of this style at all, but the addition of mulberries has added a freshing dynamic that elevates this beer to a new level. So impressed by Carton and super-psyched to see more great local beer from NJ."
