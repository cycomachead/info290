It begins with a burst of tart lemon that coats the tongue until the middle where a light biscuit sweetness creeps in underneath.  Hops make a slightly bitter appearance as the middle ends.  The finish is slightly sour at first, then fades into a slight tart sweetness and finishes dry.","tillmac62","Beers"

Along the mid palate a bright twang of tart flavor with a just a touch of sour acidity underneath the tongue and along the gums that makes the mouth water. Body is super light and bubbly with a certain silkiness about it. Finish is surprisingly very dry balancing the acidity of the beer with lots of lingering flavors. The tart qualities that make this style unique are in check enough to allow light biscuit-y and grainy notes from the malt present themselves on the finish as they linger on the palate. Delicate and refreshing.","dorosjim","Jan 25, 2015"

Syrups are sometimes added to this style of beer to cut the sourness. Napoleon himself praised this beer as the ""Champagne of the North"". It's a cross between champagne and beer: sharp, rather tart, and very very bubbly. The citrus is light and delicious. A great--and fun--summer drink.

The hazy-golden color is maybe a little on the dark side for what is supposed to be a lighter style of weissbier. Aromas of lemon and wheat abound with hints of yeast. Wonderful flavor, like a glass of fizzy lemonade. Nice lactic character but a little on the lighter side with its acidity--making it quite quaffable on a hot day. It is light on the palate with a nice bubbly mouthfeel. Slightly heftier than most Berliner Weisse, though. I really do like this beer despite its high alcohol content for its style. Berliner Weisse should be closer to 2.5-3.0% abv. But alas, disregarding style characteristics, this is a very enjoyable sour wheat beer and I would recommend it to anyone interested in the style as it is easier to find and better than 3/4 of the US-produced Berliner Weisse.","bierfreundlich","Sep 18, 2013"

Smell was more subtle than I expected but I picked up some wheat, lemon, and clove. In the taste there's also the wheat, lemon, and clove, and it is sour and tart as the style dictates. The 5% ABV is actually high for the style, and the crispness from the high carbonation and the alcohol produce a bit of bite in the mouthfeel, but the thin mouthfeel makes this a nice late summer choice. For being as thin as it is, the mouthfeel worked quite well, and the high carbonation was everything but distracting. Overall, I'm not experienced in the style and so I don't have much with which to compare this. It's simple, elegant, and refreshing if you're into a tart beer, and I like it.","DeFaz","Beers"

4.05,-1.2,3.75,3.75,4.25,4.25,4,"The beer pours a very pale yellow, almost a chunky white with a small, half finger’s width head of tiny bubbles that fizzle away slowly. The beer’s head leaves a lacing of thin sheets on the glass. In body the beer is deeply hazy and cloudy with plenty of bubbles racing up through the glass. On the nose, the beer smells clean and lightly wheaty with a very light hint of tartness on the nose. The smell is not really overpowering, and is quite one dimensional. On the tongue, the beer tastes lightly tart with sweet bready wheat. In flavor, the beer begins as tart citric lemon/lime, which quickly moves into creamy wheat bread flavors and then wheat flakes. The finish is citric lemon tart and lively like Sprite in the mouth with and the aftertaste is light to non-existent with just a touch of wheat flakes. In the mouth, the beer feels light in body with prickly, soda-like carbonation that scrubs the tongue. The mouth is left full of acid neutralizing saliva and a light tingle from the carbonation. Overall, this is a nice light beer that is thirst quenching, but begging for a syrup or something to be added to it. This is a beautiful canvas beer to be experimented with, and is refreshing to drink, but rather one dimensional. I think it is great that they are recreating this style with historical accuracy, but personally, I think this beer needs something to add some zing to the taste. A great beer to add things too.","Maxwell","May 25, 2013"

The head hangs out for a minute or two before fading cleanly down the glass. The nose has some nice citric acidity. There's also a musty, earthy, almost mushroom-like aroma present that, as someone who's not fond of mushrooms, I'm not crazy about. The citrus is more prominent flavor wise, a bright note of lemon juice that's not too tart. There's a distinct grainy wheat flavor there too, and that earthy, musty quality is a bit more muted, and has lost some of it's mushroom edge. The body is nice and light, but I think the carbonation could stand to be just a little more lively. I haven't necessarily been a fan of most of the berliner weisses I've had in the past, but this is definitely a great one, and a beer I'd welcome in my glass again.","axeman9182","Aug 14, 2012"

The beer is very light and pleasant. Crisp and refreshing. Very good. I really enjoyed the high carbonation light crisp dry nature of this beer. Overall, this beer is very refreshing and drinkable.

They offered some Woodruff syrup to add into the brew and I found that to be interesting. I liked the beer more with the syrup which is probably frowned upon by some people.

The aroma is of light yeast with the lightest of tartness. It definitely isn't as aromatic as the other Berliners I've had. The flavor is very subtle and very light. It gives off slightly sweet pale malts, dry yeastiness, with just a tad of sourness. It's so light that I'm not even sure that sourness is the right word.

Nose has some really bright lemon with a slight acidic funk. Taste is bracing citrus and acidity but the sourness was far from overpowering. Finishes very refreshingly and begging for another sip.

The aroma is kind of funky and yeasty with a slight lemon edge to it. The taste is very light. It's nice and crisp with a biscuity flavor with an tart lemon apple finish to it. I think the carbonation is a but much on this. It kind of explodes in the mouth and the carbonation is a bit on the sharp side. I do however really like the nice light body. This is near perfect.

It's not as appealing as a lambic's smell, but it is interesting, and will surely keep your nose engaged. The taste is not really sour..but very well balanced. More funk, and a very appealing crispness. It would be quite refreshing on a hot summer day (too bad I'm drinking it on a cold winter night). Light body, with a relatively low carbonation.

4.15,1.2,3.5,3.5,4.5,4,4.5,"A sour beer that is still very drinkable. To someone completely new to the style, this is a rather odd beer. Unfortunately, no other Berliner Weissbiers are readily available for comparison. The beer smells and tastes closer a sour white wine than most beer. It's not entirely unlike other sours that I've sampled. The pucker is relatively weak, and there's only a hint of barnyard tang. It's a bit yogurty, but that's a poor descriptor. All in all, it's actually further from the norms of beer than most sours despite being less ""sour."" It's not hard to drink at all. It's fairly vinous but less so than a Flanders Red or something. There are strong notes of fruity, spicy wheat, no surprise with its high wheat content and coming from one of, if not the, best wheat beer breweries. My opinion of the beer is higher than my average score. It is not a nice looking beer. The head fizzes up and rapidly dissipates leaving no lacing and a cloudy overripe banana yellow glass. The smell is yogurt sourness mixed with spiced wheat with a metallic note. The flavor is very good. It's refreshing and bizarre, at once. You can taste the lactic acid, but it's very clean and not off-putting. I should really give it a lower mark for feel with a fair bit of wateriness (apparently, water is added just before bottling for unknown reasons, although I imagine its to cut the sourness some) and some weird lactic stickiness, but the sour has such a refreshingly light pucker that I can't. It's astonishingly drinkable for such an odd beer. The bottle says that Napoleon's troops drank it in celebration of their victory in Prussia. I like that. I can imagine soldiers in funny hats having glasses of it. ""A soldier will fight long and hard for a bit of colored ribbon."" -Napoleon Bonaparte","popery","Dec 21, 2008"

When this happens, I find that the best way to cast off my beer blues is to find something new and different: 1809, in this particular case. I've wanted to try this brew for some time, but at $5.99 the price was usually enough to make think ""I'll try it next time."" Damn I'm glad I bit the bullet this time. Appearance is dramatic - I popped off the cap and a fountain of tart-smelling fizz burst out. Glad I had it over the sink... Poured into my hefeweizen glass, 1809 had a towering puffy white head which slowly dissipated to leave a constant layer of froth on the surface. The beer itself looks like liquid wheat and is impenetrably cloudy. The smell of wheat is unmistakeable, but I've never smelled a wheat-beer quite so sour as this. Taste is even more tart than the smell suggests - flavors akin to sour green apple, under-ripe nectarine and grape skin are dominant. The sourness, while extreme, is not in any way unpleasant (quite the opposite), which is good because the tartness lingers on your palate long after you swallow. Mouthfeel is prickly with tenacious carbonation, but otherwise a bit spritzery - could use some more body. Drinkability is good for the style, but this certainly isn't anything you'd want to drink all night. Still, I find it enjoyably different. 1809 is certainly a special beer, and although I wouldn't seek it out as a staple, I look forward to revisiting it.","dfitch81","Nov 24, 2008"

The appearance was what I would expect from a wisse; bubbly white head and golden straw clear body. The smell was very light except for the hint of funk I was hoping would indicate some sourness in the flavor. Ahh yes the hint of sourness on the finish was there, and pretty well balanced as well. It's just enough funk that other flavors are not over powered and the beer doesn't require a lot of other ingredients to compensate for balance. Mouth feel is light, watery and refreshing. Drinkability is a little above average just because it's not a session beer to me, but I would start a session with one anytime. I also like the mission of this brewer; to bring old obscure styles back to life, but do it true to form, history and original recipes. Simple plan yet very effective.","danadeny","0"

Four inch rocky bright white head sizzled and popped, reducing it's volume to 1/8th of it's original size within a minute; no lacing on this one. Nose was citrusy and tart with a subtle indication of yeast in the back. Citrus character revealed as lemon zest, but flavors consistent with nose as well as the presence of a mild wheat character towards the finish. Nice refreshing mouthfeel. Lively and effervescent through the mouth before culminating in a slight pucker at the finish. Easy drinking and refreshing on a warm, sticky NE day.

Long lasting lighter aftertaste combines with a lot of small bubbles on the tongue and a good liquid feel.

The beer poured a nice head that dissipated pretty quickly, was a bit hazy, and yellowish. The smell was subdued and not overpowering. I did pick up some candied citrus flavors in the smell. The taste is very good, almost cidery in quality. You will get a very smooth, tart apple, sweet citrus taste that goes down very easily.

A side note of light must, sweaty, dust, and driftwood provide the most shallowest of funk notes. But with all the challenging flavors to the untrained palate, this beer showcases well the style of Berlinerweiss.

Pours into the weizen glass a clouded, milky-yellow, lighter than a witbier, with high carbonation and a finger of white head that disappears, then reappears. It smells phenolic, spicy, almost funky, with tart, husky wheat, and a dash of hops. The flavor is similar, but adds a big lemon and yeast kick, a hefty lactic sourness, notes of banana, tart/nutty wheat, and a mild bitterness from the green/grassy/spicy hops. Its body is light, smooth, and almost dry, with medium carbonation and finish. My first experience with a Berliner Weisse - if this were a blind tasting, I'd call it a hefe gone sour... the intentional sourness, however, is pleasing and quite refreshing.

Anyway, it pours the typical Berliner Weisse appearance with a slightly hazy golden body and short head of bright white foam. It offer the typical slightly-sour and mildly wheatish grainy nose, and it delivers the same tartness and graininess in the flavor. Hop flavors are not to be found, as expected, and the bitterness is next to nil, but not needed anyway. It could be a bit more sour like the Kindl Weisse, but at the same time this is probably a tad more accessible to the general public. And it's remarkably clean, which can sometimes be difficult in the production of this style. So, in an ever smaller world of Berliner Weisse, I'd say this has to come out within the top three.

4.22,2.9,3.5,4,4.5,3.5,4.5,"NOTE: I decided to concoct my own fruit syrup as I've heard such a mixture is added to Berliner Weiss' in their traditional setting. Using a mixture of blended peach and strawberry and a simple syrup strained through a mesh filter, I added the concoction to the beer. The appearance was dramatically improved upon by the resulting Champagne-esqe head with tremendous staying power. The taste was altered a good deal and was honestly (If I do say so) quite good but I wouldn't say better per se. It was simply different. If I were to choose, I would take the beer in its original form sans syrup and enjoy the sheer sourness and uniqueness of the experience.","malcontent","Jul 03, 2007"
4.72,15.1,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,5,"My first dip in to this style and up until actually trying it I expected something more sour from what I've read. This is not the case, the beer is only mildly tart and it really only serves the beer well rather than being overwhelming like you might find in even domesticated lambic. Awesome beer.","Grundle20","Jul 02, 2007"
4.3,4.9,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Poured from a 500ml brown bottle into my shaker ""pint"" glass. Appears a slightly cloudy golden yellow/orange color with about two fingers of white foam. Smells of crisp wheat as well as a mild sourness. Taste is refreshingly sour, almost addictive, making you crave another sip. Lemon and yeast are also present. Medium bodied with moderate carbonation that works perfectly with this beer. An excellent warm weather beer. Wish I would have bought more than one bottle.","ClockworkOrange","Jul 02, 2007"
4,-2.4,4,4,4,4,4,"Pours a cloudy straw color with a good initial head that fades fast. Smell is of hay, a slight lactic sourness, and a touch of grain. The flavor is surprisingly gentle. I was expecting and hoping for something a little more sour. The sourness is pleasant and quite yogurty, but I wanted something more brisk. In some ways this Berlinerweiss is more complicated than some others, and I like the taste, but I'm not sure or not if it is true to style.In any case, you won't be adding syrups to this one. Its also a little higher alcohol than most. Mouthfeel is creamy and delicious, but not as crisp as some. Drinkable if a bit different.","Georgiabeer","Jul 01, 2007"
4.35,6.1,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Pours a cloudy straw color with a decent white foamy head and lots of bubbles. Lots and lots and lots of bubbles. The new champagne of beers, anyone? The aroma is a lemony butter scent, or a buttery lemon scent, depending on how you want to look at it. Light and airy, it smells like a field of grass on a crisp spring day. Not overwhelming, but nice and to the point. Admittedly, I've never had a true Berliner Weisse in Germany (woe is I) but I truly love this style of beer. Kinda reminds me at times of the tart Flemish sour reds in the Belgian highlands. This definitely holds up. Tart and tangy, with a strong lemony/citrus zest, the 1809 packs a puckering punch and, in my opinion, is really really addictive. I could drink this beer all day (and perhaps all night). It's that good. Wonderful in the summertime especially. I can see why the Germans put flavored sweeteners in theirs, but I personally like this style just the way it is. Mouthfeel is crisp, but smooth, and finishes with dryness and a lingering tang. Gotta stock up on more of the 1809 for the rest of the summer.","Atlas1","Jun 21, 2007"
4.03,-1.7,4.5,4,4,4,4,"This beer poured a cloudy straw color and formed a huge foamy white head that refused to go away but eventually did, coating the glass with latticed lace. A heavy amount of carbonation is present. An aroma of hops, banana, clove and yeast. The flavor was of hops, citrus and clove. The body is light and the finish is tart. Similar to in some ways to a hefe, but definately different flavor.","Wildman","Jun 12, 2007"
3.5,-14.6,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"D- This beer has a light tangy note but it is very filling. This beer is smooth but there is not much depth of flavor and the tartness is a bit too soft to keep in interesting.","rhoadsrage","Jun 06, 2007"
4.6,12.2,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,"1 pint 0.9 oz bottle served in a Kindl Weisse glass. I'm very happy to find a new (to me) Berliner Weisse. It pours a hazy straw color with a finger of head that falls to a patchy coat over the beer. Haze is prevalent and carbonation is rapidly escaping from solution. Just as expected. The nose is definitely in the realm of hefeweizen, with a banana/clove ester present along with a lemony citric tinge and a lactic acid sharpness. I really like the character brought to the style with the hefe characters. The flavor hits immediately with a lemony tartness and lactic bite that fades to a creamy banana and clove character, rounding out with a strong wheaty creamyness. Enjoyable. Mouthfeel is light to moderate with a moderate carbonation. The acidic character leaves some stringy spit behind, making me want some water to go along with it. Overall, this one is very nice. This is a beer to sit and drink on a nice warm day...no syrup needed. The hefe base to it really adds a dimension to this one that I don't recall from other experiences with the style. I will be drinking this one again, and soon.","kmpitz2","Jun 02, 2007"
4,-2.4,4,4,4,4,4,"Given this is my first experience tasting the style, but after reading it would seem that this is true to the style. Its also quite tasty, drinkable and refreshing. Although it really doesnt require fruit syrup it would be interesting to taste the beer","mmcave","Jun 01, 2007"
4.13,0.7,4.5,4,4,4,4.5,"It is bottle-conditioned, unfiltered and unpasteurized. ""1809"" will age beautifully in a dark and cool location. Its complex fruitiness and tartness will most likely develop in quite astonishing ways. 1809 is fermented in traditional open fermenters and horizontal lager tanks. The applied mashing regime is a single step decoction mash with 50 % wheat malt.The total amount of hops is added to the mash so that isomerisation takes place in the decocotion part of the mash. The wort is not boiled but only heated up to boiling temperature and then transferred to the open fermenters and pitched with yeast and lactic acid bacteria (isolated from malt) at 18 °C (64°F).","Sammy","May 30, 2007"

4.2,2.4,4,4,4.5,4,4,"This beer poured a hazy gold/straw color with lots of fluffy head. Aroma was light clove and sourness. Flavor was also a blend of sour and cloviness. I felt this beer was less sour than Berliner Kindl Weiss. I had this beer with a meal, and I noticed a pleasing fruitiness as the beer warmed which was really a nice complement to my meal. Mouthfeel was soft and champagne-like. I really thought highly of this beer.","BeerBelcher","May 03, 2007"

4.03,-1.7,4,3.5,4,4.5,4.5,"Label notes: ""Brewed with traditional mash hoping and without wort boiling. This along with a traditional strain of lactic acid bacteria provide a fruity and dry but palateful (sic) character.""","emerge077","Apr 16, 2007"
4.27,4.1,4.5,5,4,4,4,"Pours a very light, slightly cloudy yellow with a tinge of gold. Delicate, perfectly white head that kicks up and stays put but leaves no lace. Big, pungent aroma of funky, sour citrus notes (lemon and grapefruit). Distinct lactic acid smell laid on top of a slightly grainy note. On the palate, soft fruit flavors come out first, but then things sharpen up with whip-crack acidity that starts light and then gains weight through the mid-palate. The mid-palate has a very metallic flavor to it, then gives off one final burst of sourness before fading into a surprisingly sticky finish. Wonderfully bold acidity and citrus flavors -- kind of like a good New Zealand sauvignon blanc. Light in body, lots of activity on the sides of my tongue, stiff carbonation. I don't have much experience at all with this style, but I'm really impressed with this beer. Great for summer time, great for summer foods, very distinctive and interesting.","geexploitation","Beers"
