As someone who hates to see beer go to waste, I decided to finish it up for him.  Surprisingly, I actually liked this beer quite a bit.  Open the first taste, you get a bit of dry sourness but then it turns into a round, juicy flavor that I rather enjoyed.  I might need to rethink sour beers now.","iheartmyTHO","Mar 29, 2015"

It poured a hazy purple amber color with a fizzy white head and almost no lacing. The aroma was a funky blend of lemon, blueberries, and yeast. Mouth was light and refreshing. There is no coating effect and the flavor (aside from the bite) only lasts as long as the sip. The flavor is quite tart and acidic. Lots of lemon; even more so than the blueberries (of which there are an abundance of). Virtually no alcohol bite and absolutely no malt. This is different; not sure its my cup of tea but refreshing and interesting none the less.","lochef81","May 07, 2014"

Pours slightly hazy deep orange copper color with a 1-2 finger fairly dense light pink head with solid retention, that reduces to ring of lacing. Slight spotty lacing clings on the glass, with some light streaming carbonation. Aromas of tart blueberry, lemon, cherry, green apple, hay, straw, vinegar, musty funk, wheat, bread, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good complexity and balance of fruity/funky yeast, blueberry, and moderate malt notes; with good strength. Taste of tart blueberry, lemon, cherry, green apple, hay, straw, vinegar, musty funk, wheat, bread, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Good amount of fruity tartness on the finish; with lingering notes of blueberry, lemon, cherry, green apple, hay, straw, vinegar, musty funk, wheat, bread, herbal, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice complexity and balance of fruity/funky yeast, blueberry, and moderate malt flavors; with a great sweetness/tartness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth, crisp, and moderately acidic mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish as expected for 4.5%. Overall this is an excellent Berliner weissbier. All around great balance, complexity, and robustness of fruity/funky yeast, blueberry, and moderate malt flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Apr 30, 2014"

It pours a hazy orange and is full of quickly disappearing foam. There's some blueberry-ish sentiment that settles and floats at the bottom, which trust me...doesn't make much scientific sense to me either. The nose is pretty flat in my opinion...some lemon acidity and a touch of that berliner wiesse. It's pretty tart and sour up front, with just a touch of those blueberries present on the medium part of the swallow...and they disappear quickly. I really wish there was just a bit more of that fruit component in the flavor. The beer finishes with a dry biscuit and puckery end. Mouthfeel, it's nicely carbonated and light. I guess I just expected a bit more in terms of blueberry. It's a pleasant beer and not too funky or lactic, but nothing outstanding either.","SkeeterBoganski","Dec 02, 2013"

The lemon and berry cohesive taste is impressive...I find myself going back for additional tastes as there is a mix of sweetness left on the palate after the initial tangy almost sour flavor subsides. This is a great beer and very quenching at the same time I was pleased to have the chance to try this bottle and would recommend it to anyone who enjoys berliner weissbier... a very drinkable, quaffable and satisfyingly great sour wheat.","Slatetank","Nov 29, 2013"

The nose has huge bready notes, hints of tart fruit, citrus, and...dog spittle. The taste leaves a more distinct blueberry impression than the nose, but the heavy yeast presence is truly the highlight of this beer. It has a light-medium body that's characterized as being bready, semi-dry, tart, fruity and finishes with a potent funkiness that lingers. I definitely think this beer would be a really tasty berliner w/o the fruit, but the blueberry really takes this beer into a new category of deliciousness.

3.99,2.6,3.75,4,4,4,4,"The beer pours like watery pink grapefruit juice with pink and pale yellow notes, and a lot of murkiness. The beer pours with a small head of fizzing soda bubbles that burst away into nothing. In body, this beer is like swamp water; murky, opaque, and possessing a couple of floating particles. On the nose, the beer is initially yeasty--like a bread doughâ€”but then the fresh fruit breaks through on the nose with mashed blueberries, slight apple skin, and citric lemon and lemongrass with a touch of blueberry pie that is just delicious to smell. On the tongue, the beer tastes lip-smackingly tart with a little balancing sweetness from the wheat malt and the blueberry fruit. Citric acid is huge in this beer and puts a nice pucker on the lips. This beer is puckering and tart, but the balance is enough that it is not painful, and gives the beer some wonderfully refreshing qualities. In the mouth, the beer feels light in body with a crisp mouthfeel that gives way to a little bit of oiliness on the finish. Carbonation tingles nicely over the tongue at a rate on the plus side of medium, and the mouth is left full of acid-canceling saliva. In flavor, the beer is very light with its blueberry character. The beer begins as sharp citric lemon juice, slowly moving into lemon grass with a touch of yogurt, which is rounded out by sweet blueberry pie with some nice wheat flake flavors moving into the finish. The finish is lighter but refreshing with a last burst of fruity lemon and blueberry. The aftertaste is sweet with wheat malt and a touch of yogurt. Overall, this is an American Weisse/Fruited Weisse/Miami Weisse that is closer to the original Berliner Weisse style. It has some great wheat and lacto flavors, along with some lovely nuances from the blueberries. This is a great beer to put back during the summerâ€¦ Unfortunately is was just released by me, and it is distinctly the fall nowâ€¦ Crisp, refreshing, sessionable, and delicious. A great weisse to try.","Maxwell","Oct 22, 2013"

Blueberries contain just the right tart level and acidity to make them a perfect addition to sour beers, and I really wish more people were doing things with it rather than usually going for cherries or currants. Good stuff - definitely one of the more memorable beers I've had from Evil Twin in a while - and trust me, it's not just because of the label!!","magictacosinus","Oct 22, 2013"

4.26,9.5,3.75,4,4.5,4.25,4.25,"Poured into snifter. Pours a reddish purple with a bit of haze. Not much head with a vigorous pour, no retention. The nose starts with a fresh tart wave of blueberry followed by lemon zest, wheat, and some acidic notes towards the end. The taste starts just like the nose with ripe blueberries paired with wheat and lemon. The combination of flavors are seamlessly integrated and makes for an extremely refreshing drink. There is tartness present mid palate, nothing overwhelming. A nice note of citrusy zest on the finish. Mouthfeel is light and moderately carbonated. Overall, a delicious Berliner that is very refreshing.","homebrew311","Oct 09, 2013"

Aroma of crackery wheat malts, light scent of freshly picked blueberries, lacto, pithy funk. Nice tartness in the taste that really hits the comfortable middle ground between ""not tart enough"" and ""too tart."" So, it's obvious but not puckering. Blueberry skin--not juicy or overpowering at all--lemony pith, toasted wheat, hints of yogurt and/or cheese rind. Light-medium body, great drinkability. Overall very nice.","Rifugium","Sep 07, 2013"

Aroma is raspberry juice (?!?) and not much else, similar to a light lambic. Flavor follows, with very light biscuit malt, berry juice, faint wheat, finishes dry with some light Berliner weissbier tartness and more clearly identifiable blueberry. Light bodied with active carbonation. A nice light, refreshing fruit beer; it is not as tart and lactic as a traditional Berliner, which is actually fine with me, but might bother traditionalists (who would aviod this just from the label, I suspect). Fun to drink and crazy presention, but one of the things I like about Evil Twin is that they sometimes have weird names and presentations, but most of the time the beer is unusual and great to drink. This is one of those. Odd that the initial berry aroma and taste is closer to raspberries than blueberries.","LiquidAmber","Aug 10, 2013"

This is how I wish all fruit beers would be. You have a well-done base beer that is made better by the subtle addition of fresh fruit. Really tasty and extremely drinkable. I would recommend this to any beer drinker, but especially Berliner weissbier fans. Bonus points for the awesome label.","BlackBelt5112203","Aug 02, 2013"
4.19,7.7,4,4.25,4.25,3.75,4.25,"Tart blueberry taste, some crisp lactic sourness, clean finish with a little bit of residual fruit skins. Moderate carbonation, a little bit gassy. A quick swirl brings back a finger of foam right away. Minerally wheat, crisp, fruity. Blueberry is distinctive and a clear common thread from the color, to the aroma, and the taste (even the lulzy goofball label). I was sold when I saw Westbrook on the label, and this one is legit.","emerge077","Aug 02, 2013"

I find the beer to have a good balance between sharp sourness and lively carbonation and both funky and tart blueberries, although I must add the blueberries give off a touch of sweetness at times. Easy to drink with a light body, I've not had too many beers of this style but this one is a keeper.","clayrock81","Jul 30, 2013"

4.22,8.5,3.25,4.25,4.25,4.5,4.25,"Foggy, glowing reddish peach color with a very small, fleeting white head. Smell is plenty of blueberry juice tartness and freshly cracked grain. Increased fruity tartness in the mouth, but far from any sort of artificial or cloying characteristics. Blueberries, gentle acidity, and a long, fresh grainy finish. Dry, clean, mineral, and puckering in the mouth. Seems to me like the base beer would hold up as a good Berliner on its own. Pretty simple, but it stays away from being a one note wonder with a pleasant complimentary grainy wheat component. Nicely done...wish it wasn't so damn expensive.","wedge","Jul 21, 2013"

It is downright crushable as far as drinkability goes. As far as berliners go, this one at times feels a bit watery. However, it is a perfect summertime offering that (i am nitpicking here) could use a bit more tartness. Regardless, I enjoyed the grain backing and how clean this was.
