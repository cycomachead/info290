"Overall - This is ok.  Well made, but the cherry is the highlight and it isn't that fantastic."
"Just the right amount of sourness mixed with a touch of delicious cherry.  Not too sweet with a nice amount of carbonation.  Very refreshing"
"As with all of these from Schell's I enjoy them.   The base flavors seem amazingly consistent and fortunately I enjoy them.  Glad these are around."

"Has a big cherry nose with a trace of tartness. It pours brilliant effervescent cherry red with a quickly dissipating 1” white foam cap. Big cherry flavors dominate the palate with lemon in the background and very faint grain flavors. It finishes tart and dry. It is a very refreshing, light and drinkable beer. Not syrup or cloying in anyway."

"O - I'm a cherry fan I'm always up for this flavor in my beer including sours. Very glad I grabbed this one."

"O - Tasty, tart take on a classic German ""sour"" style of beer. Really enjoyed the tart cherry flavors."

"August Schell has really impressed me and this beer doesn't disappoint. A unique and very tasty berliner!"

"Black Forest Cherry pours a cloudy dark reddish color with a very small non lacing head.  There is a strong tart cherry flavor.  The taste is tart, slightly sour, big fresh cherry flavors.  Nice body, good feel, not too sweet.  Overall its a very drinkable sour beer, with great hints of cherry."

"This beer really benefits with a little breathing. The cherry opens up wide and the experience overall is more enjoyable. This is a good take on a cherry forward Berliner from the fine people at Schell's. It doesn't quite match the lofty expectations of the original but it's still excellent and sitting even shouldered with the other two releases. Worth drinking without a doubt."

"Tart cherries, lots of funk, some lemon. Dry finish. Better as it warms up."
"Eh, not too thrilled, especially at the un-Schell-like price point. It is, dare I say it, boring. Decent, but after not enjoying #2 in the series either, I think I’ll look to WI for my Berliner fix."

"O- This works pretty well. I could even be convinced that there is some smoky chocolate in here, too. [4]"
"Overall: Another very good wheat beer in this series. Good taste of cherries and funk with a nice balanced sweetness."
""
""
"Light bodied. Lively carbonation. Easy drinking."
"This is far better than most American fruit wheat beers.  If you want a very tart cherry brew, and can find this, get it before it is gone!"
""
"Overall: An exciting beer if you're at all into traditional beers and especially Berliners. Schell has gone to great lengths and you can taste it here. I would recommend chilling but then letting it warm up in the bottle for 15-20 minutes- I thought it was just ok (and very thin) when ice cold, but quite delicious as it warmed up. This is a great way to get those friends who love New Glarus Belgian Red to jump over into more authentic ""sours", as the flavor profile here is much more traditional of a ""sour"" ale (although not as extreme as an American Wild Ale). I really wish it was $10-12 a bottle instead of $13-15. But I will most likely buy another to age until next summer."

"Overall: Simpler than the others of this series so far, but still delicious, and I am not always a fan of cherry beers."
