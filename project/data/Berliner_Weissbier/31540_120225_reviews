"750 bottle. Amuses me that they call something that 5.5% imperial. Bright yellow/orange. Almost looks like it could be apricot pur√©e in my glass. Intense apricot aroma. Very sour taste, but mixes well with the fruit. Really good stuff."

"Brightly sour with great, but not overpowering, apricot presence. The amazing de garde creation of the imperial bu base beer shines through very nicely.  Sublime"

"Very tart (which I like), yet challenging."

"Tons of sediment.  Not an improvement over the non-imperial version."

"t/m/o - I have had the pleasure of having this beer a few times in the past along with a bunch of other bus and imperial bus and this is one of my favs. Really nice apricot with a hint of eggy sourness. The ultimate in refreshment. Overall there is a lot of hype around degarde, but for good reason. This is one of the many shining examples of why everyone is so degarde crazy."
"Holy crap. Awesome.  One of the better apricot beers I have had."

"The nose is heavy apricots, tart, tropical fruit, a little chalk and candy.  The flavor is pretty sour, puckering, dominated by apricots, other tropical fruit, a little grass and some lemon.  The finish is clean, fresh fruit, but very tart and makes it difficult to drink alot of this at once.  A bit intense tartness wise."

"First had this at de garde winter release an was not impressed. Was an older bottle release. Today I had this on tap from the recent release and wow! Much more apricot flavor and aroma. Beautiful beer"

"O - Apricot character was definitely stamped all over this beer. You'd expect this to be top notch and it is. Definitely beats out the Fou'Foune I had recently on tap. Having said that I did feel that it lacked wood, and I personally would have like a little more residual sweetness."

"O-Wow. This was spot on. If it was a tad more sour the beer would have been perfect as this might have been the best apricot beer I've ever had."

"Pours a murky whitish-orange with a foamy bone head that fades to nothing. No lacing on the drink down. Smell is slightly sour with malt, fresh apricot, and apricot nectar aromas. Taste is much the same with slightly sour apricot fruit and apricot nectar flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of acidity on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good beer that is very tasty but has a slightly better apricot presence in the aroma to me."

"Popping the cap revealed a goopy ring of what was presumably apricot residue around the rim of the bottle mouth. Pouring yielded an orange-copper color, murky but bright, with pours past the middle of the bottle giving quite a large amount of pulpy apricot floaties. A fluffy white head receded to a small ring, lacing the glass nicely. In the nose, apricot dominated, with lesser notes of oak and wildflowers, lightly toasted wheat. The taste was no joke...apricots and lots of them, more pronounced than in any other apricot beer I've ever tasted, a mix of fresh apricot meat and candied apricot, more sugary sweet than tart/sour; secondary flavors of fresh oak, toasted wheat, and some hay funk. Medium body, juicy mouthfeel. Overall: amazing. I would foam-dome this all day every day if I could."
