"A good beer if you like german wheat beers"
"A tart, lemon, barnyard weisse beer. I really like this as it is refreshing. If definitely seek this out again."

"Nice and tart and tasty! I like it a lot. A nice delicious beer."

"The outstanding flavor profile is reasonably intense, not very complex but is perfectly balanced and allows the effervescence to showcase the flavor.  It begins with a burst of tart lemon that coats the tongue until the middle where a light biscuit sweetness creeps in underneath.  Hops make a slightly bitter appearance as the middle ends.  The finish is slightly sour at first, then fades into a slight tart sweetness and finishes dry."

"The 5% may disappoint the hop heads, as will the lack of a hoppy presence, but if you call yourself a beer drinker, you should let this brew show you how things can be."
"Funky aroma's of barnyard, hay, and lemon drop candies. Bright effervescence tickles the tip of the tongue sweet flavors of candy, citrus, and lemongrass. Along the mid palate a bright twang of tart flavor with a just a touch of sour acidity underneath the tongue and along the gums that makes the mouth water. Body is super light and bubbly with a certain silkiness about it. Finish is surprisingly very dry balancing the acidity of the beer with lots of lingering flavors. The tart qualities that make this style unique are in check enough to allow light biscuit-y and grainy notes from the malt present themselves on the finish as they linger on the palate. Delicate and refreshing."

"An addicting amazing German beer. Not to sour just right for hot summer day."
""
"This may be my first authentic German version of the style. I must say, I prefer the more powerful Americanized ones. But for what it is, it's quite good. Balanced and drinkable."
"Pours a hazy honey yellow with thin white head.  Smells of apricot, Belgian yeast and dried fruits.  Sweet orange, chardonnay and wheat.  Nice effervescence and chardonnay aftertaste. Medium light body goes nicely with the style."
"Pours slightly hazy light golden in color with a thin fizzy white head. Smell has light fruity banana aromas along with a crisp clean tart lemon aroma. Taste follows the nose with night crisp clean lemon tartness and some light wheat and banana flavors to compliment. Mouthfeel is thin crisp light refreshing with high amounts of carbonation. Very crisp clean traditional Berliner."
"Very traditional and very tasty. No off-flavors at all. Wonderful example of the style. Nice glass bottle for homebrew use too!"
"O-  really good.  I was left wanting just a bit more in the taste department.  Overall though, it's a great representation of the style."

"O:  tart, lemony, at times outright sour ... it's what I expected in my first shot at this style.  it's got that classic chase-the-dragon thing going where you taste almost all sour but just a hint of sweet, then as time passes after a drink, your mouth starts watering and you instinctively start reaching for another sip to quench your thirst and look for more of that tantalizing sweet.  more of a summer/hot weather style (and it's chilly out), but I needed a break from big hops and big stouts, and this is doing the trick"

"O – Not quite what I expected in my first Berliner Weisse, as the tart is fairly mild in comparison to the standard in the style.  However, this is an excellent, tasty, very refreshing beer, that I could go back to over and over again."

"Poured from a 16.9 oz. bottle, into a Belgian tulip glass."
""
"O: This is one of the best examples of of this style, although it is much less tart than many others I have tried. Probably a good choice for those new to the style or sour flavored styles in general (like Goses, Lambics, Flemish Reds and Browns, American Wild Ales; etc.)."
""
"This is very nice."
"Pour is bright hazed yellow with a white head.  Nose has a fair bit of dirty grain, faint dusty brett, decent lacto, strong lemon.  Taste is a bit sweeter, grain is there but a little messier, lacto comes in mid palate, quite a bit of lemon and gets a bit sweet.  Light body, a touch syrupy, moderate carb, dry finish."

"Overall this one is exceptionally good and a fantastic Weiss. I highly recommend it and can't wait to get more."
"Cloudy straw colored pour with a foamy white one-finger head. Has a strong yeasty aroma with hints of lemon. Really nice light lemon tart flavor backed by mild yeast and biscuit. Light bodied with medium carbonation. Near perfect example of the style."

"O: Out of the Berliner Weissbiers I've rated, not a single one has scored higher than a 3 from me. This, though, is actually quite solid. Beers like these are exactly why I never give up on a style I dislike. This would also make a great introduction to those who've never had the style before."

"My beer guru brought this one over to split. Ourstanding appearance, very good smell, and unreal taste. Would describe it as a sour but lighter. Very easy to drink and very clean on the finish. I really wish we could get more of this style here in Maryland."
"This is an amazing beer and provides a very unique and different spin on what flavors can be found in beer. I highly recommend. Just wish this could be found more easily in Maryland. I've never seen it anywhere."

"Probably the best of the style I've had so far. It's more dynamic than the others, but with less lacto presence."
""
""
"Pours a golden opague color with a small white head that fades to more or less a lacing of head around the top. Smell of light hay with zest. First taste has a bright lemon sourness that is washed away by a fair amount of carbonation with a clean dry finish. A pleasant funk lightly lingers in the back end. A great example of the style."

"Overall: Solid beer, but this berlinner weisse does not have that level of cheesy/greek yogert funkiness that you get from the Lactobacillus. It does have saison like qualities and its still a pretty enjoyable beer. It is a beer thats definately worthy of revisit during the heat of the summer. Hot weather session beer for sure. Also a great consideration as a entry level Berlinner Weisse beer to introduce someone to this specific beer style."

"This pours light straw and translucent. A thick fine bubble head slowly retreats to a minimal rim. No laces. It takes a while to settle. Excellent clarity. The smell is mainly dusty grain with a little sourness. The taste however is very different. Fairly tart with a light malt presence. Minor notes of white grapes, oak, and wheat. High carbonation, light body, and mostly smooth. This is a great summer time and or lunch ale. I highly recommend this ale if you are a fan if sours."
""
"Tall head that quickly recedes to nothing, with no lacing. Cloudy straw yellow/lemonade color. Smell is lactic acid, lemon, and bready, and the taste mostly follows this. Medium bodied with lively carbonation and a dry finish. A nice example of the Berliner Weisse style."

"This is a dry, refreshing, slightly lemony beer which would be an excellent lawn mower beer. Definitely worth trying – more jobs for Lactobacilli!"

"This would make for an excellent summer drink, but it's really not my preferred style."
""
""
""

""

"OVERALL: This is a very good example of the style. Wheaty, fairly sour, crisp and refreshing. Has good character and makes for an enjoyable drink. Though in the depths of winter at the time of this writing, it makes me yearn for a few of these in a cooler, outside in the summer."

"This is a 'Berliner Weisse'--a sour wheat bear that used to be (in the 1800s) the most popular beer in Northern Germany. Syrups are sometimes added to this style of beer to cut the sourness. Napoleon himself praised this beer as the ""Champagne of the North"". It's a cross between champagne and beer: sharp, rather tart, and very very bubbly. The citrus is light and delicious. A great--and fun--summer drink. Sip, don't gulp this one."
""
""
""
""
""
"I love Berliner Weisses and have been actively seeking them out and decided it was time I revisit this brew I'd first had about a year ago. I have to say that others in the style that I've tried recently have been a bit more interesting on the tongue, but I still enjoyed this and could drink plenty of it during the summer months especially."

"Overall: Excellent beer overall. I thoroughly enjoyed this one and would put it up there with any unflavored Berliner Weisse that I've tried. I would definitely recommend giving this one a try."
""
""
"Pours a clear yellow with a MASSIVE, billowy white cloud head that overflows the glass. Luckily it dissipates pretty quickly. Aromas of granny smith apples, and a hint of sulfur. Taste begins with some mouth puckering green apple, then a hint of grain, and finishes with a dry, grassy finish. Mouthfeel is a bit light. Overall a fantastic Berliner Weiss, I wish we got more of these over here."

"overall if you think berliner Weiss, you think this beer."
""
""
""
"Beer is with carbonation of high intensity, leading to a very fizzy (painfully so), ultra-foamy mouthfeel that's just too much for the style and the beer itself as well. Closes semi-dry, with light stickiness remaining on the palate."
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured into a beer flute, the white champagne-like head gradually dissipates leaving minimal lacing. The hazy-golden color is maybe a little on the dark side for what is supposed to be a lighter style of weissbier. Aromas of lemon and wheat abound with hints of yeast. Wonderful flavor, like a glass of fizzy lemonade. Nice lactic character but a little on the lighter side with its acidity--making it quite quaffable on a hot day. It is light on the palate with a nice bubbly mouthfeel. Slightly heftier than most Berliner Weisse, though. I really do like this beer despite its high alcohol content for its style. Berliner Weisse should be closer to 2.5-3.0% abv. But alas, disregarding style characteristics, this is a very enjoyable sour wheat beer and I would recommend it to anyone interested in the style as it is easier to find and better than 3/4 of the US-produced Berliner Weisse."
""
""
""
""
""
"O. This is pleasant, but more acidity would be nice. I realize that the trend nowadays with berliners is a light hand with the bacteria, but this is lighter than most."
""
"O - I haven't had a ton of Berliner Weissbiers but I do like the style and this probably the best one I've had in the style."
""

"Pours an extremely cloudy light yellow/straw color with a huge head that recedes quickly. Smell was more subtle than I expected but I picked up some wheat, lemon, and clove. In the taste there's also the wheat, lemon, and clove, and it is sour and tart as the style dictates. The 5% ABV is actually high for the style, and the crispness from the high carbonation and the alcohol produce a bit of bite in the mouthfeel, but the thin mouthfeel makes this a nice late summer choice. For being as thin as it is, the mouthfeel worked quite well, and the high carbonation was everything but distracting. Overall, I'm not experienced in the style and so I don't have much with which to compare this. It's simple, elegant, and refreshing if you're into a tart beer, and I like it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Absolutely delicious. Must be experienced to be truly understood, as there's nothing quite like a berliner weisse! A little confusing on the nose, since it lacked the sour aroma that would have prevented it from smelling like a hefeweizen."
"Overall: A super refreshing tasty beer. Like a slightly sour hefeweizen, with a bit less banana and clove sweetness. Very enjoyable. I want more!"

"I wasn't sure what to expect with this beer since I haven't really had a Berliner weissbier before but this beer is awesome! Has a light acidity that makes it dry and refreshing. Not sweet nor bitter just very pleasant and palatable. I could definitely see this paired with chicken or maybe even fish entrees since the lightness of the beer would enhance without competing with the flavors. This is also a beer I would be comfortable sharing with non-beer geeks/craft beer novices as well as beer snobs. I could see how some more experienced beer geeks might find this beer a bit too subtle, but I find this beer to be extremely well crafted"
"light body with high carbonation and a slightly sour feel. this is a nice traditional beer, not as good as some of the others i've had, and definitely not as tart as the others out there but i can see this being a good introduction into the style for some people willing to expand their tastes."

"1809 is a very nice Berliner-style Weissibier, although I haven't heard of many Berliners reach levels of 5% ABV (crazy, I know). This stuff would go down like water if it wasn't for the explosively prickly mouth feel that almost forces you to take it slow at first. Certainly not bad, though, considering you can get this almost anywhere."
"O: (3.75) a nice and refreshing beer for the summer months. kind of reminds me of a belgian wheat beer, but the added sourness/tartness makes it something different and quite a bit better in my opinion. a bit pricey at $6/16.9oz bottle, but something I’ll probably come back to one or two more times before the hot weather subsides."

"This was not terribly complex. It had exceptional balance and poise. Well turned out and sparkling . Vivacious and enlivening. A terrific beer with a low abv that is the perfect thirst quencher for a hot day. Would compliment almost any food."

"The beer pours a very pale yellow, almost a chunky white with a small, half finger’s width head of tiny bubbles that fizzle away slowly. The beer’s head leaves a lacing of thin sheets on the glass. In body the beer is deeply hazy and cloudy with plenty of bubbles racing up through the glass. On the nose, the beer smells clean and lightly wheaty with a very light hint of tartness on the nose. The smell is not really overpowering, and is quite one dimensional. On the tongue, the beer tastes lightly tart with sweet bready wheat. In flavor, the beer begins as tart citric lemon/lime, which quickly moves into creamy wheat bread flavors and then wheat flakes. The finish is citric lemon tart and lively like Sprite in the mouth with and the aftertaste is light to non-existent with just a touch of wheat flakes. In the mouth, the beer feels light in body with prickly, soda-like carbonation that scrubs the tongue. The mouth is left full of acid neutralizing saliva and a light tingle from the carbonation. Overall, this is a nice light beer that is thirst quenching, but begging for a syrup or something to be added to it. This is a beautiful canvas beer to be experimented with, and is refreshing to drink, but rather one dimensional. I think it is great that they are recreating this style with historical accuracy, but personally, I think this beer needs something to add some zing to the taste. A great beer to add things too."
""
""
"O: What an interesting beer. The sour notes and minerality are lively and enjoyable."
""
""

"Overall: Good, but not amazing. While it's not completely true to style it's one of the better easily available Berliner options out there."

"O: I can't say I've ever had a Berliner Weisse in Germany, so while I can't vouch for the authenticity of this beer, I can say this is about as spot on a Berliner as I could imagine. Tart, but not sour, with a strong lemony taste. Well done."
""
""
"O: this is a weird style of beer, it's hard to rate because I can't compare it to anything but pickles and malt vinegar"
""
""
""
""
""
"Light bodied with high carbonation. Leaves a dry, sticky feeling in the mouth, with a lightly bitter aftertaste. After two disappointing Berliner Weissbiers, I found this one, which I like quite a bit."
""
""
""
""
"Had very pleasent citrusy tartness. Didn't hit you in the jaw like a lambic, but had a nice sour taste. Highly carbonated and refreshing. Would be great on a hot day."
""
""
""
""
"O: Very light and refreshing, less flavor than I was expecting but still extremely good."
""
""
""
""
"I would drink this for hours during the summer."
""
""
"Pours a cloudy, golden color. 5/4 inch head of a white color. Great retention and good lacing. Smells of lemon, hops, sweet malt, slight pale malt, and slight herbs. Fits the style of a Berliner Weissbier. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with a high carbonation level. There is also an appropriate level of tartness. Tastes of lemon, sweet malt, slight pale malt, slight sugar, hint of herbs, and a hint of hops. Overall, good appearance, aroma, and blend."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"My scores were based on the pure, non-syruped drink. For reference, I also used a non-standard passion fruit concentrate, but even generous amounts of it did not mitigate the overwhelming lactic character - again, it was expected, but too evident on this beer. It helped the appearance, though, as I could finally see a white neck just for a few seconds."
"A very mild and refreshing beer."
""
"Overall: This one feels authentic. Simple, clean, not overdone in any way. The taste is perfectly simple, refreshing and delicious. With a little tweaking on the carbonation this could be a perfect summer beer."
""
"Overall, this was somewhat of a disappointment. It just tasted like a boring, fizzy wheat beer with a little bit of tartness. I'll conclude that I prefer the modern American Berliners with a more robust lacto component than this traditional Berliner."
""
"O: A nice easy drinker that has a nice lactic quality and a solid wheat presence. Great for a summer any-time beer"
""
""
""
"O: Like it, and have to be in the mood to enjoy this, rather like a lambic. Refreshing, crisp, unique, love the bottle that has lots of writing on it. Love the history it gives on the beer."
""
""

"Poured from tap at Avenue Pub NOLA. Pours a hazy golden with a little bit of white foamy head. Great hefe banana and clove aromas with a nice dose of sour. Taste is fantastic banana hefe wheat, with a burst of sour. Finishes with a chocolate like note and smooth. Its amazing how the tartness just finishes out leaving the maly characteristics behind. Really a fantastic brew."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - This is everything you want from a German beer. It is simple and easy to drink yet full of flavor. The slight but not overwhelming tartness reminds me of a lighter Gueuze. This is one you could drink all summer long while sitting out on the porch and enjoying the sun."
"Overall: I like it. Drinkability is the biggest factor, I can drink this with or without food. A no fuss, refreshing beer."
"One of the best BW styles i've had."
""
""
"Tart flavors as well. The lemon is more of a persimmon on the tongue. White grape. Hints of pine..very green. This beer drinks remarkably well even though it does have a tartness that some may not favor. Very nice"
"Overall, quite good. While I do not have a ton of experience with them, I really like the Berliner Weisse style, and this strikes me as quite a good one."
""
"Infinitely drinkable. Great next to a slice of pizza."
""
"O-This is a solid, above-average Berliner. The whole package was nicely balanced in terms of feel and flavor, but nothing jumped out and made me say, ""Wow!"" This would be a good introduction to sour beers for the uninitiated."

"O: This is a pretty tasty standard berliner. Nothing crazy added like so many of the ""Florida-weisses"" around now, but very solid."
""
"OVERALL- Finally satified my curiosity about one of the last styles I haven't tried. No doubt this is the real stuff, a couple of US- brewed attempts I had were just watery and bland by comparison. This is extremely refreshing and would be better than lemonade on a summer day. I know beer snobs recoil at the idea of putting syrup in beer but I made my own woodruff syrup and a couple spoonfulls really tied things together after I wrote the review above. Wouldn't drink this again without the syrup."
""
"O- refreshing beer. Was expecting more tart or sourness, but very little is present."
"a very true to style berliner weiss here. pours cloudy lemon colored with a smallish white head that fades out after just a minute or two. the smell is very sour and citrusy, acidic for sure, and refreshing. there is a lot of lemon in the flavor, tart like lemon juice from concentrate, and the wheat malt does little to calm that down. there is also a funk sort of yeast, almost saisony. i really like the mouthfeel too. its got more carbonation than the appearance shows, and the body is super light. the acidity at the end is a little harsh, but on a hot summer day this would be just right. its not one of those beers id want to get drunk on though, too much acidity would turn the stomach around. it is a very refreshing berliner though, one of the better versions ive had really, and for under 7 bucks a bottle, its a nice buy."
"Solid and nice to have a bottled Berliner around when I have a craving for one, but better examples exist."
"Overall: This beer is a never fail shot to get a nice tart bite with some flavors (minus the funk) that you might find in a gueuze. Really helps scratch that itch when I don't want to drop $12 on a bottle of Black Label or open something from the cellar."
""
"This is my first of the style, so I don't have anything to compare it to, but got it because I've been wanting to try one and because of the good reviews. Definitely not disappointed, and would love to seek more of these out (and I've seen some random ones popping up at domestic breweries). I just really appreciate all the flavors that come through in this, despite the sour twang, which sometimes tends to overpower for me."
"On the palate its a mix of tart and sweet. Not overly sour but a nice bit of lemony pucker and healthy dose of juicy fruit sweetness alongside. Light in the body and quite refreshing. Overall, a nice slightly tart Beliner that makes for a nice quick sour fix without palate busting kick out of other sour styles."
"O: A very nice Berliner, incredibly easy drinking."
""
""
""
"Extremely crisp and refreshing with just a spot of lactic sourness. A tasty little treat."
""
""
"O: Very drinkable and refreshing this may be the perfect warm weather beer. Best I've had of the style."
"Professor Fritz Briem 1809 Berliner Weisse is good beer. While I’m not a huge fan of the style, I am enjoying this bottle. Is it the world’s best representation of the style? It could be. If you’re looking for a good one to try out, this is a good place to start."
"Note: I reviewed this beer straight from the bottle, though I also tried it both with Himbeer syrup and Waldmeister syrup (the traditional manner). It was excellent with both."
"Quite enjoyable. I would drink it on the regular."
""

"A spritely, lively beer. Light and zesty in character. A great beer for warm weather patio or biergarten lounging."

"Big fan of this beer."
""
""
"Fizzy overflow upon popping the cap. Big ol’ white head sits atop a liberally carbonated hazy yellow body: hard to fault the appearance of this one – stunning in a curvy hefe glass with a an even pancake of a head that sticks around for the long haul. Has the musty sort of lactic aroma associated with many wheat/Belgian styles; it’s citric, and there’s an aromatic sandalwood type smell. The carbonation jolts my throat – flavor is subtle but refreshing: light bodied, lemony, tart, and dry. Nice."
""
"I'd give it an 83/100."
""
""
""
""
"Overall a drinkable, refreshing beer."
""
"So glad I finally got to try this! Pricey at 11 bucks a bottle. but its definitely a great summertime treat."
""
""
"O: A bit thick and wheaty for a Berliner Weisse, but still quite nice."
""
"Drink- Took a long time to finally see one of these bottles and its a damn fine beer. Clean, crisp, refreshing. Ill have to get another."
"1809 Berliner Weisse pours am opaque light yellow, with about two fingers of white foam crowning the beer. The head hangs out for a minute or two before fading cleanly down the glass. The nose has some nice citric acidity. There's also a musty, earthy, almost mushroom-like aroma present that, as someone who's not fond of mushrooms, I'm not crazy about. The citrus is more prominent flavor wise, a bright note of lemon juice that's not too tart. There's a distinct grainy wheat flavor there too, and that earthy, musty quality is a bit more muted, and has lost some of it's mushroom edge. The body is nice and light, but I think the carbonation could stand to be just a little more lively. I haven't necessarily been a fan of most of the berliner weisses I've had in the past, but this is definitely a great one, and a beer I'd welcome in my glass again."

"I'm quickly getting into the Berlinerweisse style and this is a big reason why. A simple, yet almost flawless beer. Crisp, refreshing, balanced, and super drinkable. Hard not to like this one."
"Tried this at the map room in Chicago. Nice beer, I would have expected more tartness out of this the lemon comes through huge and ends up being more of a lemon hefeweizen more then anything else, no funk but some sour from the lemon flavor. medium body with a lot of yeast hanging around."

"Review from 5/2010 notes. Poured into a Celebrator pokal. Pours a medium cloudy yellow-orange. Lively white head which dissipates quickly. Taste is wheat, light fruit and lemon, weizen spicing; sour with citrus flavors interacting with carbonation. Light wheat in the middle and sour lemon finish. Refreshing flavor. A bit sour for me, but to style and I still enjoyed this well made weizen."
""
"O: This was incredibly refreshing (given the circumstances, that was a major selling point). I would gladly buy another."

"The warmer and longer it sits, the more tart the lemon gets, making this even better."
""
"IMO, this is how a BW should appear, smell, and taste. Highly recommended, this is a must try for likers of the style"

"T: The flavor opens gradually and moves towards a medium lactic/lemony twang. Some green apple, light funk and wheat on the finish. Probably the best I've had of this style."

"16.9 oz bottle $6. I haven't had many chances to grab an authentic berliner so I snapped this up. Light yellow color, hazy, good head. Smells tart, lemon, wheat. Flavor was wheat cracker, very subtle lemon, so easy to drink on a hot day. I could kill a lot of these if given the chance, solid beer."

"O - A nice refreshing beer for a warm spring, or summer day. Reminds me of a sweet tart. I can see me getting into Berliner Weiss's."
""
"Pours a light golden straw color, moderately hazy, prickly white bubbles. Scent leads with a touch of lactic tartness, follows up with light fruit such as apple and citrus, faintly musty dried grain. Taste brings moderate lactic tartness, a nice bit of tart apple, grape, lemon, musty dried grain. Medium bodied, moderate carbonation, refreshing. A nice Berliner with a touch of fruit and some toned down tartness. Sampled the last few ounces with Woodruff, very nice."
"O: Super great summer beer. Best Berliner i've ever had. Definitely pick up a couple bottles if you see it."
"O: Easy drinker, especially on a hot day. Good for a few."

"O- it's a good beer, but it's not a good berliner weisse."

"o: awesome beer. glad i was able to find a bottle. will probably pick one up everytime i see it."
"overall - nice beer - easy to drink and it invites you to keep drinking more."
""
"O- This is beyond any Berliner I've come across. This is just magnificent in all aspects."
"O. This is a solid Berliner Weiss that is oh so easy to drink. On a hot summers day, I could easily see downing two or three of these."
""
"O- So this is what a real Berliner Weisse should taste like. I like it much better than DFH's ""neo"" berliner weisse, Festina Peche."
"Overall, it's an interesting beer with with a non-traditional flavor. Thought I read it is usually served with a sweet syrup. Will drink again maybe with a little fowl."
"A very good wessbier that was surprisingly funky."
"Pours a clouded light grainy yellow with a loose, vibrant three fingers of white foam. This falls over 5 or so minutes to leave a solid sheet. Lots of funky Brett on the nose, with some wheat and yeast and peppercorn notes. Don't really anticipate sourness. Very lightly tart with a solidly wheaty flavor and some hints of metal. The brett plays second fiddle to the lactic acid. There are plenty of subtle tones in the beer, and I would hesitate to put syrup in this one, as it's fairly refreshing as is. Medium to full bodied with hi carb and semi dry finish. Nice beer, better than last time."
"Just lovely."
"500 ml bottle into imperial pint glass, no bottle dating. Pours slightly cloudy golden straw color with a 1 finger foamy white head with poor retention that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. No glass lacing, and a good amount of carbonation streaming up. Aromas of big tart lemon, apple, pear, grape, grass, hay, cherry, and yeast spices. Fantastic aromas here, with good acidity and balance. Smells a lot like a dry cider. Taste of tart apple, pear, grape, lemon, pepper, grass, hay, yeast spices, and slight funk. Fairly dry on the finish; but there are some lingering notes of apple, pear, hay, grass, and yeast spices on the finish for a bit. Great balance of flavors with a nice tart/sweet balance. Medium-high carbonation and fairly light bodied; with an extremely smooth and crisp mouthfeel. Alcohol is completely hidden at 5%, with no warming present at all as expected. Overall this is a fantastic Berliner weissbier. Fantastic flavor balance, with a nice amount of flavors. Very drinkable and highly enjoyable."
"Overall. Nice beer but I have to admit, I'm a little underwhealmed. I think BR Tartare has ruined me forever as far as this style goes."
""
""
"Solid example of the style. One that everyone should try."
""
""
""
"Verdict: Light, simple, sour, excellent Berliner Wiesse, and one I can find almost anywhere. At nearly 5% ABV, it could actually be called an Imperial Berliner Weisse as most beers in this style hang around the 2 to 3% mark."
""
""
"This is a superb looking beer, a pale white-golden color with a large head that retains for days. The aroma is fruity and sour. The taste is good, it's got a nice, well-balanced tartness that is rather quaffable. Fruit flavors and a touch of yeast and wheat provide a supporting role. Very well-composed, if not fascinating. The mouthfeel is HIGHLY carbonated, it's been a while since I've had a beer quite this fizzy. The drinkability is very good. Overall, it's a solid introduction to the Berliner Weisse. It's not quite as interesting as some of the things that Florida breweries are doing with the style, but remains a great reference point for those who are interested."
"M. Lighter body with champagne-like bubbles, dry and crisp extended finish after the fade of sour."
""
"This is super clean, crisp, and refreshing."

"O: Very good!"

""
"Pours a slightly hazy light yellow with a 2 inch fizzy white head that settles to a thin cap on top of the beer. Small streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of subtle wheat, lactic acid, and some tart and sour aromas. Taste is of subtle wheat, lemon, and some tart lactic flavors. There is a grain aftertaste as well. This beer has a higher level of carbonation with a very crisp and bubbly mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good and refreshing beer and one of the better examples of the style I have tried so far."
"O: While this isn't my favorite style of beer, and I wouldn't drink it all the time I have a lot of respect for it. It brings in a lot of flavors and goes down easily. A well crafted beer and definitely worth a look."
"Overall I found this beer to be quite enjoyable and refreshing. Tastes kind of like a sour lemon drop but the tartness never becomes overwhelming. Very nice on a warm day."

" ~ This is not something I could have on a regular basis. It seems like it would be a very interesting conversation piece if it were to be served at a social gathering. Not something I will seek out again."
""
"Leaving it in the glass for a little bit seems to let this open up much better. Dry white wine really begins to take over."
"O: Very different and excellent beer. I enjoyed it and would recommend it. I think this would be even better on a hot day in the summertime."
""
"O: Such a refreshing beer! Lightly tart, good carbonation and light body. A really delightful style and one I'd love to have much more of."
"O: One of my favorite styles of beer, would have been interesting to sample this with the red and green syrups as well as on it's own like I did when I was in Berlin last fall. Very refreshing and very sessionable, easy to drink in the cold or in the heat. Would easily pair with lots of different foods."

"M-very light and refreshing. I am brewing this to be enjoyed in the heat of summer. Can't wait!!"

"Overall: Delicious, quenching, refreshing. One of my favorites of one of my favorite styles; wish more breweries were doing a Berliner weiss. Hopefully they will be soon, 1809 is fantastic."

"O-a great take on a sour beer... Has definitely become one of my staples (whenever I can find one)"
""
"O - So, it's been that long since I've been here that Drinkability now starts with an O. But yeah, this is a delicious, stand out beer, that deserves a place in every serious beer-drinkers fridge. It's challenging to dissect, but also a pleasure to drink."
"Berliner Weissbier is one of my favorite styles, but unfortunately it is all too rare. So when I was picking up a few bottles for a friend, I couldn't resist grabbing this bottle as soon as I noticed it for myself. I was a little put off by 5% ABV (seemed a bit high), but now I'm glad I picked up a bottle."
"Overall, this was a great Berliner. Easy drinking with a nice amount of sour. I could easily drink a lot of this on a hot summer day. Amazing!"
""
""
"Pours a clear, golden straw color with a large white head that diminishes quickly. Scent is initially sharp and acidic with a bit of musty, damp cellar-like aroma. A bit grainy with some tart, yeasty aromas. Apples, white grapes, and hay. Nice, complex aroma. Taste is just slightly astringent with lovely green apple and grape flavors...somewhat champagne-like. Perfect amount of tartness for this style...puts Festina Peche to shame. Up there with Hottenroth. A bit of clove and banana with wheat and grain. Mouthfeel is nice and light with a crisp, refreshing finish. Drinkability is very high. Overall, not typically the right weather to be drinking such a beer, but DAMN this would be PERFECT on a hot summer day. Outstanding beer."
""
"O: Really good example of the style. It’s no limbic but it’s really tasty and certainly the best example of the style I’ve had (and one of the most affordable and price appropriate). A"
"Bright, sweet, tart and refreshing. Love it."
"A highly refreshing and relaxing beer. This could easily be a sessionable beer for one to take their time drinking. The character develops with time, rather than progressing."
""
"This is an outstanding beer. It is extremely refreshing. It's very light and crisp which, combined with the slight tartness and higher carbonation, give the beer an excellent, pleasant bite. It was very enjoyable early on a Saturday afternoon when it was about 34 degrees outside. My guess is that it's even better when enjoyed outside on a hot summer day."
""
"Notes: Light in body with a very soft mouthfeel, this is one thirst-quenching brew. Almost like a lambic/wild ale, yet without the brett funk. Remarkably easy to drink, as I will be seeking this beer out again in the warmer months to come."

""
"Overall, I like this beer a great deal. The complex flavors and supreme drinkability had the two of us thinking, a day after brewing our first batch, when we ought to brew a Berliner Weiss."

"Cloudy golden tangerine hue. Huge three fingers of white head. Mild tart oranges and lemons mixed with soft wheat undertones. Hint of vanilla. Flavors are pleasantly tart. Citrus fruit and soft wheat cracker blend with a touch of vanilla. Light crisp body. Superior refreshment for sure. This is my new go to lawn mower beer."
""
"Skål!"
"Overall a nice beer I'd like to try again and seek some more examples of."
""
"Overall this is a tart, refreshing, easy to drink wheat beer. Sourness lends as great deal of palette interest and the light body/high carbonation reinforce the crispness. My first example of the style but I'd say it's very well done."
""
""
""
"O - A great beer for a light meal or on a hot day."
""
"Overall: Very interesting, almost like a mix of a dry champagne and sugarless European citrus soda with some wheat grounding it in beer territory. While I am willing to try this style again, I found the dry sourness to be a bit intense. Luckily I was able to pair this with some food (baked salmon), but I do not think I would drink this without food."
""
""
""
"O: I'm not all that familiar with Berliner Weisse as a style, but I would venture to say that this is a solid example of what a traditional Berliner Weisse is supposed to be. I enjoyed the elegant character of this ale, but I'm not sure that I would be all that keen on revisiting this one until I've tried some other Berliner Weissbiers. All in all, this is a pretty decent beer."

"Overall: A really awesome beer that I love to keep around the house. It's a really solid entry-level ""sour," and it's pretty easy on the wallet. I don't really have anything else to say about it, that isn't just reiterating what i've already said..."

"Review with some woodruff syrup thrown in. Aroma is a bit sweeter. Taste is much sweeter with a lot of the tartness cut out. Bit of marshmallow flavor. I think I like Berliner by itself better but it's still good."

""
"o - this was my intro into berliner weissbiers, so i don't have a lot for comparison. but it was good as an after dinner beer to sip on while drinking. i definitely prefer lambiks and russian river sours in comparison, but it was great to try a german sour."
""
""
""
"500ml bottle. Pours hazy golden with a short lived, thin, white head and lively carbonation. Aroma is of lemon fruit, barnyard, sour dough and hints of hops. Medium, tart body. Very sour, tart taste with hints of hops, while high carbonation adds to drinkability. This beer grew on me with every sip. I would not mix it with a syrup."
""
""
"O- A nice simple refreshing beer. Reminded me of JP Weizen Bam. So easy to drink. The flavors are bold enough to make this interesting. This beer exists between a wit and a blond sour. Would like to try more of this style."
"O: Light and lightly tart, refreshing concoction, it actually reminds me of my wifes prosecco (Italian sparkling wine) a bit. This was my first berliner weiss, it seemed nice I've rated it 4's across the board."
"O: Refreshing. Like a cross between a Gueze and a Hefeweizen."
"This is very delicious and is a slightly more drinkable alternative to lambics and gueuzes."
"Edit: If you don't like the sour taste, drink it with something greasy. Having it with Camembert cheese now and can hardly feel the sourness."
"O-I must revisit this in the summer months!Super refreshing and unique style."
"Crackling carbonation is quite high. Like a Perrier sparkling water. Nice head. The cleanest of light golden yellow bodies. Aroma is dominant with Granny apples, but there's also lots of lemon. Floral, fruity, Autumn apples. Taste is tart but not as sour as I had hoped. Fruity and dry. Thin, crisp, refreshing mouthfeel. On the bottle: Lactic acid. Mash hopped, No wort boiling...Hmmm I'm intrigued."
"Taste, more tartness, great light mouthfeel and body to the beer. Amazingly similar to Hottenroth. So fresh and so clean. A perfect summer beer. Very prickly carbonation like a nicely done skunky pilsner (this is not skunky whatsoever). Like most good bw's, there is no residual sugar, just plenty of tartness and a light wheat base to wrap it around."
"Pours a lightly hazy pale golden yellow, with a creamy white head of a finger or two. Good retention. Nose has some wheat, bright lemon zest, lemon juice and some light tart notes. Taste has some lactic tartness, lemon zest as per the nose, citrus zest and some modest wheat notes. Gets slightly juicier, and more citrus flesh with the addition of the yeast. Light mouthfeel, and a gentle zip in the carbonation. On the lighter side of tart, and modestly drying finish. Good drinkability, but a bit more tartness would've been nicer. Refreshing certainly."
"Overall: Great beer. I have truly loved everything I've had from Weihenstephaner and would buy this beer in a heartbeat if I find it again. Great, refreshing, original stuff!"
"Looking forward to some Stakem homebrew Berliner's someday, thanks again Adam."
"Overall, for my first Berliner Weissbier, I was quite impressed. Very drinkable and balanced. Refreshing and smooth. I will definitely be grabbing this one again."
"Wonderful stuff. Clean, refreshing, complex. Loved it."
"Overall Experience- This was my first Berliner Weisse and i really enjoyed it. the aroma and taste was similar to a nice sour but the wheat character gave it a very summery kick. a mix of summer wheat with a sour would love to try some others of this style."
"O: Overall very good. Something that is nice for a summer night, light, crisp and refreshing with a decent amount of citrus and tart flavors."
"What a great Berliner Weisse! Full of flavor and aroma, and a great beer to end the summer season on. Thanks to Will @ The Beer Store in Southampton for the recommendation."
"O - A great beer for a warm summer night, and possibly a good beer to introduce someone to the tart/sour side of beer styles. It is pretty simple but very good."
"Quite a new experience for me. Poured into A ""Berliner Kindl Weisse"" glass, a small head was produced above the clear dark yellow body. The smell is tart like fruity wheat beer. The lactic acid creates an incredible tart almost sour raspberry flavor in the beer. Hops seem to go unnoticed as the bottle indicates the beer was only hoped during the mash from what I understand. The bartender told me that it's typically served with a raspberry syrup, this may help round out tat tartness next time around."
"O-this is definitely an easy and fun beer to drink. the germans might really be making this style the best. it tastes so much more genuine and pure than the other that i've had."
"A testament to the style and a fine example of what it should be, although, it is rather bland and lifeless. If you could consider this to be the ""banner bearer"" of berliner weisse, then I can see plenty of room for which this style could grow. Regardless, an excellent summer style and beer."
"Overall Impression- One of my favorites of this style so far! Refreshing, medium acidity, and has this strawberry flavor that was very interesting. So far I haven't seen this in Beer Stores but am going to be buying this very soon to enjoy again! I suggest you do the same."
"Overall: An excellent, refreshing example of the style. Next time I get one, I'm going to let it sit in the fridge for a week or so to let the yeast settle out. Highly recommended by my cousin, David, the clerk at Lukas Liquors, and now by me! I only wish this were more readily-available!"
"O: This could be an excellent summer beer, and quite possibly will be this year for me. Goes down way too easy and is super refreshing. 4"
"A fantastic example of a hard to find style, though I have to imagine that this is not as tart as the original berliner weisses, as those are generally described as bracingly sour, but it is tart, refreshing, and all around pretty awesome. Also has some nice yeast/bacteria notes in the aroma and flavor as well."
"Bottle at City Beer in SF, first I’ve rated of the style I think. Golden color with a white head and high carbonation apparent. Aroma of wheat and lemon/other sour fruits. Flavor of wheat with lemony tartness and sour grapes and apples. Sharp, crisp palate with a pleasant astringency. Not too sour. Refreshing."
"Light summer beers that are good are really hard to come by. This and Russian River's Redemption are my top 2."
"I'm finding as I get further into the glass that its drinkability is just amazing. What a wonderful beer."
"The flavor is similar. Light and zippy, though heavier than other examples I have had."
"Super cloudy light yellow beer, white head with awesome retention. Head is well composed of tiny bubbles. Smells really clean for a sour beer. Lot of malted wheat in the aroma, with yeast and bread notes mixed in. Also a hint of lemon as well. Very refreshing beer. The tartness adds a well suiting aspect to the wheat beer. I was surprised at house subtle the sourness is, it's highly drinkable considering. Tastes like malted wheat and lemons with extreme tartness.The Ph is very low, reminiscent of lemon juice. I like it. I'm impressed and would definitely have it again."
"Overall, this is not my preferred beer style, but I could sit and easily drink one or two of these and enjoy it. Nice components combined with a uniqueness keeps me coming back."
"O: This shows classic examples of the style, a very good beer with a great depth and drinkability."
"While this is not really my style of beer at all I did enjoy trying a very different beer than what I'm used to. I appreciated it but I don't know if I'll be rushing out to try more beers in this style."
"Overall great to try an authentic style, and the more and more I drink this the better it gets. It's the perfect version of lemon beer I've ever had if I could use that term. Not punching acidic not too bretty, not boozy, just tolerable lemon joy. I'am sure there isn't even a drop of lemon in this. Well done."
"O - the beer is actually pretty good wouldnt be a go to beer but probably would have from time to time"
"7.2/10"
"Taste is much different than the nose and better than I expected. It is a refreshing beer good for the hot summer months, especially today. Soft and well rounded mouthfeel. This beer comes with a medium amount of sourness. Nice tart and semi-sweet. Bubble gum, banana, and rubbery notes makes this a semi funky wheat. There is a healthy dose of sediment in the glass."
"O: 1809 has bigger flavors and body than other berliner weisses, which does hurt drinkability. Still, I find it enjoyable and will drink it during the summer to break up the ""monotony"" of Oarsman and Hottenroth. "
"O: Very refreshing. Quite enjoyable. A little age seems to bring more tartness. Would certainly have again."
"The mouthfeel is mostly dry with spurts of juicy tart fruit. Very complex and well-done beer."
"Expected DMS from the unboiled wort, but instead got the most delicate malt sweetness and the flavor of grains. The body is flush with malt flavor, balanced with sourness that, because of the complete lack of vinegar, tickles the tongue."
"Not for everyone, a beer that can be perceived as being more like a wine than a beer but a singular and interesting drinking experience."
"Overall, a nice enjoyable berliner weisse and definitely a great example of the style. Plenty of funk and barnyard notes throughout and a nice dry finish. Refreshing, but I think more time in the bottle could help this become more tart."
"This beer is light, golden and clear with lots of carbonation evident. Looks nice. Nothing special. The first thing to hit me in the aroma a yeast. Didnt even pour the yeast in, but it seemed to be fairly apparent in the beer. Along with the yeastiness is also tartness and mildly fruityness and funkiness (but not a ton at all). The beer is very light and pleasant. Crisp and refreshing. Very good. I really enjoyed the high carbonation light crisp dry nature of this beer. Overall, this beer is very refreshing and drinkable. Light in flavor, but there is a lot going on. Would definitely like to keep a few of these on hand for the rest of the summer."
"Light and spritzy on the palate, this is definitely a summer beer. Easily drinkable, this is something I will return to again and again, especially with its sub-$5 price tag. I wish there were more of these that were so widely available."
"One hell of a beer and I will look for this one over and over again! Cheers!"
"Off the charts drinkability, if you enjoy tart beers. The only thing holding me back from drinking this allday everyday is the $5.99/16.9oz bottle price tag. A lovely beer that really shows what an under produced, but fascinating beer style Berliner Weiss is."
"Overall- Outstanding beer, going to have to stock up on this big time. I wish more breweries would give a stab at this style, though this is definitely the best I have had."
"O- A very good Berliner Weisse that packs a lot of funk and some sourness. At first it was not as sour as the Bruery's Hottenroth I had recently, but still quite sour. After I poured my second glass more of the sentiment got in the glass and it became a lot more sour. This one packs a punch. Very nice refreshing summer brew."
"D - very delicious and, as most beers of this style, thirst quenching. I randomly picked this up not knowing it was so highly regarded and that Weihenstephan is behind this brew. I think I just found my go-to summer beer."
"O/D-I like this one a bunch. Very unique. Great for warm weather. Would love more than just one bottle of this. A very solid, well-rounded beer. I have nothing bad to say about this one. Great introduction to the Berliner Weissbier style."
"Overall - A style I wouldn't drink year-round. But it's nice when I'm hot and thirsty. An intriguing twist on what malt and yeast can become."
"It's so great served cold and crisp, but it really just gets better with some warmth. This is very drinkable - will get again."
"Note: this is definitely not a beer to be served ice-cold, as I hated the first half-glass and then started to appreciate it as it warmed a bit."
"This beer poured out as a very pale hazy looking yellow color. The head was white and had a light lacing on the glass. The smell of the beer was kind of on the tart side, wasn't really thinking it'd be like that but it was. The taste of the beer was also a little tart but subtle. They offered some Woodruff syrup to add into the brew and I found that to be interesting. I liked the beer more with the syrup which is probably frowned upon by some people. The mouthfeel was light and refreshing. Overall the beer was refreshing the tartness was tolerable and would probably be most enjoyed on hot days."
"Very nice overall. Quite unique. The elements are combined very well. It would make a very nice, more flavorful alternative to the standard list of ""summer"" beers."
"O: Very refreshing and drinkable. The citrus notes in addition to the wheat and lactic acidity are really enjoyable and make this beer much more drinkable."
"I'm honestly trying to remember the last time I had a beer this refreshing. A revelation, and certainly the best Berliner Weiss I've ever had the pleasure to sip. Go get yourself a bottle."
"This is a fine example of the Berliner Weiss style. Very refreshing and at 5.0%, highly drinkable, although it is fairly tart. To moderate the acidity, Germans add sweet syrups to the beer, but I prefer consuming it with food where the acidity can do its thing. This would pair very well with roast chicken, seafood, and cheeses."
"#300"
"O- Overall a really interesting brew that was crisp and very drinkable."
"CHEERS!!"
"I wish that nose was a bit cleaner. I understand the process lends itself to that...but not all of 'em I've had have a stank. With my experience so far with this style I've liked the American versions much better than the german versions. This one is alright and nice to quaff."
"O - not being a fan of middle-of-the-road German weisse, I actually prefer this tart variant."
"This beer poured a very, very clear light apple juice gold in color with a three finger self destructive white foamy head. The head appeared to consume itself before setting as a light white lacing around the edges of my snifter. It's probably the clearest Berliner Weiss I've seen to date. The aroma is of light yeast with the lightest of tartness. It definitely isn't as aromatic as the other Berliners I've had. The flavor is very subtle and very light. It gives off slightly sweet pale malts, dry yeastiness, with just a tad of sourness. It's so light that I'm not even sure that sourness is the right word. It's drink fine but isn't dry like most of the style are. Perhaps this was an old bottle. I don't know, it just wasn't nearly as good as advertised."
"I did not like the smell at all. It seemed to me to be just that, a smell not a pleasing aroma. That said, if I find it to be typical of the style, I will have to change my score to reflect a middle ground between my personal aversion and what is to be expected. That would likely shift my score from a B+ to an A-."
"This seems like a wonderful style that I really wish I could get my hands on more easily, especially in the summer. I'm very fond of the addition of bacteria and the lively carbonated feel. With no apparent downsides, this is all in all a great beer."
"O: One of the most refreshing beers I've had. Think of a sharper, dryer S. Dupont with more fizz. Took me all of 3 minutes to guzzle it. Almost TOO refreshing, if that can actually be considered a fault. ultra-drinkable."
"Wow, now this is to the style! I didn't know what to expect but I have to rate this high for drinkability, etc."
"O: A refreshing beer, excellent with a light meal with enough flavor to stand on its own. I liked the White Birch Berliner Weiss better, however."
"A bit less tart than some examples of the style, but still satisfyingly lactic-lemony. Nicely drinkable, as the well-moderated sourness holds at a pleasant level throughout. I think of this style as the ""lemonade of beers"" (but not in the horrid shandy-style) in that it is refreshing on a hot day."
"Pours a beautiful old gold and clear - left about an once of beer along with the sediment in the bottle. The carbonation is ridiculous, not a gusher when opened, but in my duvel tulip the bubbles are crazy for thr nucleation point on the glass - never seen abeer so carbonated. Nose has some really bright lemon with a slight acidic funk. Taste is bracing citrus and acidity but the sourness was far from overpowering. Finishes very refreshingly and begging for another sip. Outside of festina peche my only other attempt at this beer. My girlfriend who loves festina says that this beer was better and i tend to agree"
"overall; Last time I visited Berlin, I liked the selections from Berliner Kindl and Schultheiss, but this one stands out to me above the others. A perfect beer for a sunny spring day in the states or a sunny summer day in Germany. Highly reccomended for anyone, who can appreciate a sour beer."
"It's hard not to give this one good marks since A) it sticks pretty closely to the traditional recipe and brewing process and B) for most of us this is probably our first Berliner Weiss. These B.W.s aren't exactly clogging the shelves, but I much prefer this one to many sour beers I have been trying lately and find it quite enjoyable."
"Bottle. Pours a hazy golden with a huge white head that dissipates pretty quickly and leaves a small amount of lacing on the glass. The head reappears with some swirling of the glass. Aroma is wheat, grass, a light funk, and some lemony zest. Initial taste is a lemony zest, going into some wheat, light grapefruit. Finish is more wheat with some yeasty funk. Light body. Medium-low carbonation. Overall a pretty tasty beer."
"Big frothy golden pour, pretty agro coming out of the bottle. Big crazy sugar cookie lemony nose, with some sour funk on the end. The is a very tasty beer once you get used to it, slighgtly bitter, but not over the top, and quite refreshing. I would love to have this on a hot day outside on the porch, it would shine. Overall a very interesting beer, and quite drinkable for such an interesting first taste. I'm a fan."
"But it still is like a whole tree of lemons exploding in my mouth."
"Notes - This beer is light but only in nature. It can be light but still pack enough flavor for any beer drinker. I've had it straight and also had it rot, or red with himbiersirup added. Both were enjoyable."
"This one is as easy to drink as seltzer water. Nothing bad here at all, and while I've never had a Berliner Weissbier before, I'd like my sour beers with a bit more going on than this."
"Drinkability:off the charts! This is going to be my goto beer for the summer."
"Great for a hot day, this is such a pure version of the style - though some might prefer a tiny bit more tartness, this is very pleasing."
"D- Mmmmm love me some sours. The sweetness can take away a little from this category, but it isn't overwhelming. This would be great on a hot summer day (not surprising). Now if only my homebrewed berliner would finish fermenting sooner...."
"This tastes better once the yeast from the base of the bottle is added to the glass."
"The CPJ"
"D- Very drinkable. I love the flavor of a good Berliner Weisse or any other tart beer so it scores high with me there. The 5% abv also helps, as it becomes pretty sessionable (Not a SESSION ALE, DING, but sessionABLE). Also, the tartness doesn't wreck you palate like some other wilds/sours I like, so you could enjoy a couple of these no problem."
"Drinkability: Hmmmm....such an unusual beer I'm not sure what to make of it in the end. Refreshing, but I wonder if I would enjoy the styles of this beer fresh with the fruit syrups put in like they do in Berlin. I say this because I have a sweet tooth and after awhile the sourness of this beer gets to me. So while I could not have another, I say this because I don't have something to pair it with. With the right food I could probably have another. But by itself, no, one is enough. Still, I greatly enjoyed it and I'll have to figure out another occasion to try another one of these."
"D. Supremely drinkable. I'd prefer this on a warm day, but any day with a beer is acceptable."
"Pours a hazy yellow. Lots of white head that foams up on the pour. The head dissipates quickly and leaves no traces. Smells sour and tart and wheaty. I can taste wheat and maybe corn? On the tongue. Sour and tart predominantly on the tongue but subtle enough that its tasty. Solid mouthfeel. Vry drinkable especially for a sour"
"D-very drinkable. Very nice sour after taste. Taste was gone in no time"
"(16.9oz bottle). Gusher. Pours cloudy lemon yellow color with massive white head. Active carbonation. Aroma of funk, basement, citrus and lavender; it's perfumey. Taste is tart with some malt sweetness underneath. Medium bodied with a smooth finish. This is a gentle beer. I definitely should get more to age. Nice."
"drinks very well! by far the best example of the style, though I can count the ones I've tried on one hand still. dry, yet sweet, yet tart, yet herbal, yet simple, yet complex."
"(D)- A great Berliner Weisse. Nice crisp and tart fruits with a bubbly carbonation level. Great stuff that would be fantastic on a hot summers day. I look forward to exploring this style further."
"Drinkability is great. This is my first take on the style, and I like it. Reminds me of sour light, but still with plenty of flavor."
"Reviewed from notes. Poured into a tulip. Pours a very light straw color with lots of visible carbonation and a gorgeous three finger fluffy and creamy looking white head that settles down to about half and retains nicely through out the beverage. The aroma is kind of funky and yeasty with a slight lemon edge to it. The taste is very light. It's nice and crisp with a biscuity flavor with an tart lemon apple finish to it. I think the carbonation is a but much on this. It kind of explodes in the mouth and the carbonation is a bit on the sharp side. I do however really like the nice light body. This is near perfect. By biggest qualm with this is the carbonation, otherwise, this is a great example of the style."
"Clean, tart, tasty, great beer. Well done, Professor."
"This is a fascinating and amazingly interesting beer. It's not an appealing beer to behold, being a little cloudy and full of floaties. The head is a soda-pop fizz that fades as quickly as it forms. The aroma, however, is complex and intriguing. Sour-smelling, lactic, horse-sweat, funk, grass, and straw. It's not as appealing as a lambic's smell, but it is interesting, and will surely keep your nose engaged. The taste is not really sour..but very well balanced. More funk, and a very appealing crispness. It would be quite refreshing on a hot summer day (too bad I'm drinking it on a cold winter night). Light body, with a relatively low carbonation. Great smoothness and texture...I love the mouthfeel. All in all, this is not a beer that I'd go out of my way to drink, but it's a wonderful experience. Hail the funk!"
"This is spectacularly drinkable, and anyone looking for light, tart and gently sour and for a pinnacle of this style should reach for this one. Of course, I haven't tried any other Berliner Weissbiers, but I imagine this beer will be extremely difficult to match."
"Overall, I like this syle and this was the best one Ive had so far. It is really a crisp refreshing beer, would have no problem drinking these all day long in the summer"
"D- Very sessionable. Perfect for a warm day. Low abv and refreshing taste."
"D- Really nice stuff. I would drink this often in the summer."
"CHEERS!"
"Could use a touch more flavour on the front and perhaps more of a flourish on the finish. It's quite enjoyable as it is, however."
"How is this style of beer not more popular? It's great great great. This particular beer needs to be in six-packs as soon as years ago. It's awesome."
"A lovely, refreshing and very light beer. It's the sec champagne of the beer world. Very easy to imbibe, and incredible delicate, but with a lilt and depth of character that is surprising in a beer designed so much from a refreshment point of view. Lovely."
"Pour a lemony, yellow color that was topped off with a white fluffy head that dissipated rather slowly. Very cloudy and full of yeast. Nice citrusy aroma. Citrusly, clean, crisp taste. I could drink a lot of these on a hot summer day as drinkability is extremely high."
"D - good...good...if this came in cans I'm sure I would be toting it everywhere. Hard to find but this is a relatively rare style (only 7 beers listed on BA) with a great contrasting flavor profile. Big fan - get it if you see it and see what this style is all about."
"D: A great beer. I wish it was a little cheaper ($6 / bottle) and available in six packs. I really enjoy this beer and would drink it anytime."
"drinkability: great summer ale and good for it's purpose"
"50cl bottle poured into a long, thin glass. Small, fizzy bubbles abound. Kind of subdued, slightly sour aroma with an impression of peaches. More sour peaches in the flavor, very dry and tart. Highly carbonated and dry, perfect mouthfeel for this style. Highly refreshing and very good. Edit: This has improved after 6+ months. Really a softer a better mouthfeel, and more richness in the flavor."
"Pours a very light apricot color with a thin white head and not much lacig. Nose brings a bit of tart wheat and some very mild acid. Hints of peach. The taste is a bit more expansive, with peach, grean apple, and a bit of grass coming in as well. Light mouthfeel with good carbonation. Nice and mellow throughout, this drinks really well."
"Note: I've also tried this on several occasions with the Raspberry and Woodruff syrups, and, while those are interesting additions, believe this beer is best served straight up."
"D - This is a shockingly drinkable beer. I expected intense sourness that would overshadow all other flavors, but the acidity is actually quite restrained and while the flavor profile is simple, it is very well managed. The intense carbonation helps to bring out the subtle flavor of the wheat and some notes of lemon and pear. The acidity is restrained and just strong enough to set off the other flavors and it makes for a perfectly refreshing, tart finish. I am really blow away by this beer, it is easily the best Berliner Weisse that I have ever tasted and it is definitely worth seeking out."
"a particularly high abv berliner. Although only five percent. This is a robust tart. And the creamy quality of the lactic acid smears the sour with the malt like butter on beer. The wheat is the backbone to a pretty consistant sour grit and mild apple. Very one dimensional for people that aren't fans of sours. Granny smith apples with a wheat grit that has a bitter of fresh dandelion greens. One of the best found in north america."
"Super pale yellow with thin white head that falls quickly. Nose is huge compared to the appearance: white smoke, rocks and gravel, and some barnyard funk. Palate is crisp and dominated by pear notes (like peary). Tart and earthy. Not a lot of wheat character. Very clear and clean finish."
"Drinkability: Once readjusted to what to expect of a Berliner Weisse (I've not had a true example of the style in several years) the quality and subtlety of this beer become clear. It is quite easy to sip my way through this beer. It would be good to have a second, and I won't hesitate to have this beer again when I have the chance."
"O: great sessionability, though a little pricey. I would drink again."
"I've wanted to try this brew for awhile, and the Professor didn't disappoint. It's not overly sour or funky, while staying ultra drinkable. Nice!"
"this is a hard beer to review because it is art in a different kind of way than most of the beers we try and review on here. the art here is replicating a process and evoking a sense of place and time for the sake of art, enjoyment and education. if we don't know where styles come from, we don't know where to go with them. dr. fritz gives us the foundation of a style that was almost lost to the tee and it is awesome. pale golden with a white head that hangs out for a while, but doesn't leave much lace. nose is awesome. musty, mossy-wet-rock-in-a-cellar, wet animal, and a touch of citric acidity. the semi-spicy (yeasty) taste is way less tart than one might imagine from the nose, and everything seems just a touch subdued, but like i said, fritz isn't really trying to pull out the stops here, he's trying to school us and make us happy at the same time. ahhhh. this is why they called it the champagne of the north. the cellary, cobweb, musty wet-rockiness is very similar to real champagne. yum. i think i've gone on enough here. awesome beer. know your beery roots. cheers!"
"Drinkability is high. This is just such a clean tasting beer with subtle characteristics that are intriguing and inviting. A true lawnmower gem."
"Overall: This is an adequate beer that I'd pick up again if I ran across it and was in the mood for this style, but I would not hold it to the same regard I hold others(The Bruery & Cambridge Brewing Company were much better)."
"Pours clear with a very pale yellow body and a thin white head. A lot of lemon in the nose with some apple and pear that give away the yeast in the bottle. Also some banana in the aroma along with some skunky grass notes. Very refreshing. Lemon, pineapple and apple cider are prominent. Definitely has a tart champagne quality with a some husk/wheat malt coming through at the finish. Hops are subtle but impart a nice grassy quality. Light bodied and well carbonated. Mouthfeel is tart and fizzy with a dry finish. Not a lot to this beer but it's very enjoyable if you're in the mood. The right amount of sourness to play off the malt. A bit Phenolic as it warmed but super easy to drink. Great presentation."
"Once this brew warms up to room temperature some brett character becomes evident in both the smell and taste. It was previously hidden beneath the other flavors but once it was warm it presents itself with a light amount of leathery character."
"Taste: Very tart with a dry finish. Pale wheat malt. Not alot of complexity but it's still pretty good."
"D - Extremely drinkable, I love this beer and I love this style. This went from a random choice on the shelf of my liquor store to ""I need to go buy more of this"". Great example of a Berliner Weiss!"
"Drinkability -- This one didn't disappoint. Crisp and refreshing, but with enough clean malt sweetness and tart funkiness to keep it complex and intriguing. Rock solid Berliner Weissebier."
"D: refreshing, easy to drink, I enjoyed it."
"Stellar brew. Total treat. Wish it was easier to get. I can't imagine a better beer to use as an introduction to sours. I really liked Dogfish Festina Peche and this puts it to shame."
"Easily one of the best in the berliner weissbier style and the fact that it's readily available makes it ever better."
"A refreshing brew; enjoyable and drinkable."
"D: Very, very high! This beer really took me by surprise. I had no idea that the Germans messed with lacto. This was the perfect blend of wheat and lacto (that's the 3rd time I said that). I can't wait to find more beers in this style. This would be a great intro to sours!"
"Bottle. Pours a slightly hazy golden yellow with a slight head. Very effervescent. Sour, tart, lemony aromas wafting from from bowl. Ok, I'm not drinking from a bowl as the style calls for but you get the picture. The taste is very straightforward. Think charged water with some beer and lemons added to it. Very light in the mouth. Just a very mild drinking beer. Slight acidic bite (nibble) at the end. Bottle has lots of sediment. Really like the aroma probably better than the taste."
"D-It's $9 a bottle, so not too high. If it were cheaper, I would drink a ton of this."
"Extremely drinkable. Man, I could drink the hell out of this, so refreshing. I think I like this better than Hottenroth and Festina Peche, and I'm a big fan of those beers."
"D= I would love to drink this all the time. If this came in a can and was affordable I think I would drink this all day everyday. Wow. A wonderful brew."
"M & D - Nice and light with good crisp carbonation. Delicious and refreshing. Very drinkable."
"overall - very tasty. nice refreshing beer, great on a summer night."
"J"
"Very enjoyable, although past 16oz it started becoming a little bland for me. Refreshing summer beer and the best of the few Berliner Weisses I have tried. Would love to try it with a little syrup, just to scale back the dryness a bit."
"M/D- medium-light bodied, high carbonation. very refreshing and quite appealing."
"This only being my second berliner, I was hoping this would be more like Bell's Oarsman. It's actually quite a bit different with the exception of the tartness. I have to say that I was blown away by the Oarsman and this is a bit of a letdown. It's a good beer and probably represents the style correctly, but I prefer the Bell's. Still worth a try if you are looking for a berliner weiss."
"Great beer! Poured with a fine, white head and no lace. Color is a clear, light yellow. Aroma is tart, grassy, lemony, berry. Taste has tartness in the fore and the nose qualities. Body and carbonation are perfect for the style. Finish is clean and short to medium in length. Excellent summer beer alone and also equally good with a bit of fruit syrup such as raspberry. Would really like to get some more and lay it by."
"Drinkability: Above average for the style. Never have I had a beer that tastes so much like a wine before. Not as sour and tangy as my previous experience with the style. Not bad, but I would probably reach for others in this style first."
"Overall, a very tasty and well made beer. My new benchmark for the style."
"F: Very dry of course, with a touch of wild dry sour fruit funk and lingering toasty flavors. A crisp but light creamy flavor balances with a gentle tart bite. Mouth watering dryness and sour fruit balance the funk well. The lacto dry flavors stick around too."
"16.9 ounce bottle. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours a hazy straw gold color with about an inch white head. Head retention and lacing are both a little above average. Aroma is lemon zest, lemons, tart apples, bready malt and wheat. The taste is pretty much the same as the aroma, but the taste is more tart than the aroma would lead you to believe. It's a good tart/sour beer, but the tartness isn't overpowering. Mouthfeel/body is light, it's nice and crisp, and it has good carbonation too. Drinkability is pretty good, it's refreshing and enjoyable. It wouldn't be hard to drink a few of these at a time! I think this is a good overall brew, I'll definitely buy this again in the future."
"It comes together well. I am most definitely drinking a solid thing, instead of a bowl of varied sournesses. It may be a bit offputting to people who are accustom only to newer, more immediately palatable sours, but it's not hard drinking in the least."
"Pours a hazy straw color with fizzy white head. Gentle pour but got enough sediment in here that the massive stream of bubbles rising to the top have turned it in to the world's most lively bowl of sea monkeys. Anyway, looks alright for a berliner. Smell: husk, cornbread note that I seem to find in all berliners, a little barnyard funk. Taste: tart but not as tart as others, lemony, just a little bready and a hint of unripe banana."
"Cheers!"
"Very refreshing drink, I am happy to have tried it. At $4.99 a pop, I might have to grab one to put in the cellar to see how it develops. Delicious, easy drinker, a style that I might have to explore more."
"D - Yum. Good stuff."
"D: A crisp und refreshing brew."
"The beer pours a hazy light yellow color with a white head. The aroma is wheat with tart lemons. I also get some apple. The flavor is tart apples with wheat. The beer is very dry. Thin mouthfeel and low carbonation. This is a good beer, I just wish there was a little more tartness."
"This beer is really enjoyable and refreshing. I could definitely drink a lot of this, if it wasn't for the price tag. I liked that this version is higher in alcohol than other berliner weisse's. Pretty good."
"Flat out delicious, and oh so drinkable. Impressive."
"My first Berliner, so I figured I'd attack this one ""ohne Schuss""...always time for Schuss next time, right? Well, let's see... ... ...Sorry, the jet of bubbles through the champagne-y gold's got me all... ... ...Finding Nemo and whatnot... Shake it off, man, shake it off! Alright, maybe a good, healthy sniff will divert my attentions elsewhere. It's a bit light, but it'll do: some wet, spicy straw, coriander, peppercorns, and lemon peel. If nothing else, my trance is broken (at least momentarily), the perfect opportunity to get a taste in before the bubbles regain their insidious hold on my apparently weak spirit. The taste is heavy on the lemon peel, with those peppercorns and coriander seeds grinding their way about before having some less-than-innocent meetings with some funky characters. Not as sour as I was led to believe by my contemporaries, but not all that blunt either. Really interested in trying it mit Schuss now. Without it, it's pretty dern light and airy, leaving me with a pleasantly dry, tart aftermath. Prolly would be nice on a summer day in Saxony, mit oder ohne Schuss; gonna haveta try that someti-- ... ... ... ... bubbles... ..."
"M/D: Loads of carbonation in the mouth feel, it even holds bubbles down to the last drop. Very clean and crisp. I really enjoy this, it is only my second beer from this style, but taste great. Perfect for the time, summer and heat. I would definitely drink this again."
"Cheers to Weihenstephan for going after a ""dead"" style with a long history. Pretty cool idea."
"Notes - Just a beautiful looking beer that is delicate and tasty. Good mouthfeel and carbonation."
"M: Tart, sweet and bubbly"
"Crisp, clean body is well carbonated. Quite easy to drink despite being a bit strong for the style."
"D: The beer is rather refreshing to drink; adding a dash of fruit syrup could make this even more palatable and thirst quenching."
"D- This is a summer time patio pounder, I could drink this refreshing brew siting out side looking at the ocean. I cant thing of any thing I would rather have on a hot summer day."
"Pretty mild on the tartness(at least in this bottle) and slightly acidic on the back of the tounge. The taste seems to fade out towards the end. Light bodied and boldly carbed up. I remember liking this better back in the day, but perhaps my tastes have changed. If it tasted better, the low ABV would make it easy for a few."
"D- huge this stuff on a warm day and I'm in heaven. Totally a session beer with flavor for days."
"i was a bit let down by this. not as pronounced as i'd like or have come to known. lacks dominating flavors and is more or less a bit bland. overall, probably would not seek out that often but easy to drink."
"D - I've had a number of Berliner Weissbiers and this one stands out as different from all of the others I've had...more alcohol, more malt character, darker color...all seem to be a bit off for the style. This is still an enjoyable beer, but I would call it a bit flawed for the style."
"Drinkability: It's the first 70+ degree day I've seen this year, and I can't think of a better beer to drink on this beautiful day. Very refreshing, tasty, and a reasonable and sessionable ABV. I highly recommend picking this one up if you get the chance...I know I will the next time I see it."
"Flavor begins with a sharp lactic acid twang and segues into a creamy wheat background. The acid overtakes it in the end and it leaves you with a clean refreshing finish. One of the more sour Berliner weiss biers i have had I hope they keep on making this for a long time."
"D - For some reason this beer just was not super drinkable for me, surprising considering the low ABV. Maybe it's just the sweetness becoming overpowering. Had trouble getting through the single bottle."
"O: My first example of such an elusive style of beer. I wish that more breweries would take this style seriously, this style has incredible potential. As usual, this happens to be an excellent beer from the World's oldest brewery."
"Overall I really didn't know what to expect of the Berliner Weisse. But this is an extremely delicious and refreshing beer. It almost reminds me of a hefeweizen on some kind of sour jag. It's very tasty, now if only it was easier to track this stuff down in Michigan!"
"Overall Impression: This is a style that will appeal to people that enjoy Tart Belgian Ales, and Wild Ales. I strongly recommend against getting the syrup poured into it, thus making it a foofoo girly drink."
"Still a pretty good beer overall. I wish I had caught that yeast on the pour. I'm not typically opposed to ingesting some yeast sediment, but those are some damn big chunks."
"Nothing leads me to believe I didn't drink this in good condition, but looking at the other reviews I would really like to give this another try since I like the style and this does come from a reputable brewer of wheat based beer."
"Leave it to Weihenstephaner, a Bavarian brewery, to perfect a North German style. Great, spot-on stuff here."
"While not as common as other Weihenstephan products, 1809 is worth getting your hands on. Berliner Weiss' popularity seems to be growing here stateside, but are still rather hard to find."
"Pours a clear yellow color with a medium sized fluffy pure white head. A light tartness, notes of toasty wheat and a Smarties candy sweetness. Crisp with a mild sourness of lemon skin and a very delicate spice note, an aged hop bitterness rounds and balances. Clean and refreshing, a very good, highly drinkable example of the style."
"d - very drinkable, par for the style, the crispness is very refreshing, I could see this as a perfect warm weather beer"
"D – Very high drinkabilty. I could drink a ton of these."
"D: Wish it were summer, this would be the ultimate summertime refresher!"
"What a delightful beer. Such great flavors and beautiful balance. Everything is in harmony. I really wish we could get this in Colorado because it's just excellent."
"Beer has a light body and is really drinkable. The overall flavor is one note and its a kind of lactic sourness that you may associate with spoilage. Its clean finishing and mouthfeel is good. The high levels of carbonation provide an odd bitterness in there and helps to average the flavors over the entire palate. I like this beer in the bottle better than on draft."
"Notes: This is my first taste of a very interesting style, and I was not disappointed. It is definitely not your ordinary beer. I loved it plain, however, I would love to try this in the traditional style by adding flavored syrup. Apparently in Germany, woodruff is the popular flavor."
"Robustly carbonated for the style and with a pleasant feel offering a nice drink."
"D: This, like other Berliner Weisses, is incredibly drinkable. My only gripe is that it's not quite as tart and lactic as the other Berliner Weisses that I've had."
"Sour apple and spice, you get the sourness up front, then a good malt middle, with a sourish finish that puckers. The flavor is not quite as good as the smell, but very refreshing. Slick and heavier than expected in the mouth, a refresher that really one is enough, not a session beer, but I could see putting some fruit into this as they do where they make it."
"Not bad. I feel like I might've gotten an old bottle. I'll be sure to revisit it as I go through the rest of the Berliner Weisse's I've acquried."
"pours a clear golden yellow with massive carbonation leading to a huge white head that dissipates quickly to very little. throughout the experience bubbles were racing up the side of my glass. smells of fresh lemon and some grass. the grass isn't very palpable, but it's there. the zest of the lemon is very prominent and overpowers anything else that might be there. there is a tartness to the aroma that is very faint. taste is of tart lemons throughout, no real noticeable wheat in the flavor at all. there's a dryness to the finish that wasn't really my cup of tea. this is a very light bodied beer with a crispness to it that makes it very drinkable and refreshing. very worthwhile and i would happily drink it again."
"D - If you like wheat beers and sours this is the best of both world for you an interesting beer thats very good worth finding to try"
"Funky sour version of a heffe. Bready yeaty bosy with hints of corinader, lemon and orange peel as well as some subtle grapefruit and ripe banana. The tartness is subtle and not as dominant as I was expecting and/or hoping for. Slightly tart finish but otherwise just tastes like a muddy earthy german wheat beer."
"The beer is a little watery, but highly drinkable."
"Pours straw yellow, cloudy, with a sparse white head. Scent of lemon and some light funk, yet still crisp and appetizing. Tastes citric with lemons, and some light funk. Pretty good, though I like the grain to shine through a bit more instead of having the funk. Light bodied with a medium mouthfeel. Not a bad beer to break up the rest of the night, but not something I would want to session."
"Poured a clear light golden yellow with about 2.5 fingers of white airy head that quickly dissipated to about a finger. Obviously very bubbly. Smell is a lot of citrus and wheat. Very clean smell. The taste is very refreshing, similar to biting into a lemon (but not in a bad way). Crisp, clean, refreshing. Good effervescence in the mouth with a nice dry finish. An all around good beer."
"D- I think this is a cool style in general- and this is a good representation. I wouldn't put down a bunch, but I think pairing with food would be cool."
"D- Very refreshing and drinkable- if it were only on tap throughout the summer!"
"Cloudy, translucent yellow with a thin, white head that recedes to a disk. Lactic tartness up front with a mild lemon and citrus character. Raw wheat is noticeable as it warms up. Tart and refreshing with a mild lactic character. Plenty of lemon and lime character, before a dry, tart and refreshing finish takes over. High in carbonation, light in body, this beer is immensely drinkable. An excellent berliner weiss."
"Very enjoyable beer, which drinks easy and is very thirst quenching on a warm day."
"Overall this was a good example of the style but I prefer a bit more tartness. Still, it's very much worth a shot."
"D Highly drinkable and I am sure refreshing on a hot day, say after yardwork or something. This thing is that I would not reach for this in that situation, I would probably go with a more tasty and more available beer such as SNPA. 4.5"
"Fizzy, spritzy carbonation lighten the body, but the flavors are washed clean and it seems a bit thin. However, the pleasing tartness and the clean finish make this one highly drinkable. An extremely refreshing beer for the Summer."
"D = This is an enjoyable beer and would make a great beer to enjoy on a hot afternoon, but it is a bit more than one would want to drink a lot of at a sitting."
"drinkability is excellent. a great berliner. very crisp and refreshing with just enough funk to keep it honest. cheers!"
"While I enjoyed this beer, I found that it was not quite as sour or as complex as other examples I have sampled. Nevertheless, this is a light, refreshing and tasty beer perfect for sipping on a hot summer day."
"For a beer I've been wanting to try for a long time, this came as somewhat of a letdown. Too expensive and unidimensional to be really satisfying in the end."
"I'll take everybody's word that this is a good representation of style and hey, the bottle says Napolean drank it so that's good. Right?"
"Not a complex beer, but very tasty, and much better than the first weisse I had (which was only about 3% alcohol, and had probably sat on the shelf far too long)."
"D: A fantastic Berliner Weisse, after having a lot more of this style recently I'm starting to really get into it. This would make a great summer poolside beer if I could actually find it in my local stores. Thanks to Gabe at Beachwood for having this on his bottle list."
"D: This is my first beer of this style. It seems to fit the style guidelines to a T. The sourness is something I have to be in the mood for to revisit this. The low ABV makes this light and refreshing."
"D: This one is not drinkable at all for me due to the tartness."
"Drinkability is high, this is an excellent beer. I love it."
"Overall: Fantastic, refreshing beer! It scratches that summertime itch..."
"Exceptional drinkability, truly the champagne of beers!"
"Drinkability - High, especially in some hot weather, when the cold effervescence and tart flavors refresh to excess!"
"This is interesting, and my first Berliner Weissbier. I can dig it, a sour wheat beer. It works well. I would like it to be a little less carbonated, but still worth a try."
"Overall very, very good. I could drink this one all night. I would have to highly recommnend seeking this out."
"I could really get into this style. I will be in search of more in this style. A real treat to drink!"
"overall tastes better than it look or smells, refreshing, leaves mouth clean."
"D - Smooth and refreshing... Refined, elegant, and classy... Light and delicate... A terrific brew and a wonderful and top notch representation of a very under appreciated style... A terrific summer session brew..."
"Overall, this is pretty decent, but nothing I'd buy again."
"mouthfeel/drinkability - its a very light beer but overly carbonated and added to that tart sour taste make it almost painful to drink"
"Notes: Nothing overly complex here, just a nice sour brew with tart citrus fruits and a dry, refreshing feel in the mouth. Nice beer for a hot day! Not sure how many of these I could drink, though, as the lively carbonation seems to squeegee the tongue of all moisture. Enjoyable nonetheless, and well worth a shot if you're into this style."
"D: Perfect for a hot day."
"drinkability- a very refreshing beer with too perhaps just a bit to much sour. I myself felt it to be too sour, while my girl friend absolutely loved it."
"For some reason I have been craving this style lately. This is my first time trying this brew. Pours a cloudy, sort of lifeless pale gold, with a quick to dissipate white heading. Aroma is wheaty, and slightly sour. Lots of citrus in the smell too. Bursts of lemon and orange in the taste, with some slight sour notes and more from the wheat. Body is light, and incredibly thirst quenching. I could drink a few of these for sure. This is an excellent beer. I will be getting it again."
"Goes down very well. I would love to try this in Germany to see how the shipping affects it. A shame we can't get 6 packs of Berliners here in San Diego, this would be a great summer session beer. I might have to pour one in a pepsi can for the beach ;)"
"D: I'll be sure to grab another bottle or two, as this one is a nice summer sipper."
"Pours an incredibly hazy orange-yellow with an effervescent white head that dissipates quickly. Aromas are typically hefe, with a lot of banana and clove character, backed by an unmistakable citric tartness. This doesn't reflect the taste, where the acidic sourness sticks out over all. Nice sour apple character that mostly masks the banana notes. Dry, tart finish. The light-medium body with heavy carbonation goes well with the flavors to make this quite refreshing."
"Overall a superb berliner. A tiny touch more tartness would be nice, but the subtelty of it makes it ideal for a refreshing treat. Yet another classic from one of my favorite breweries, and the authority on german styles. Great stuff."
"Pours a very pale straw color, cloudy with all the yeast, with a big fizzy white head that disappears quickly. Aroma resembles some wheat beer characteristics, a little citrus and clove, but there's a lot more twang here, some acidity. Taste is very tart, mouth puckering with a touch of sour. Lots of citrus acidity that resembles lemon juice. A drastic departure from most wheat brews, but still retain some of the defining characteristics of that style. Another top notch brew from Weihenstephan."
"Pretty drinkable, good beer."
"Just a great beer. I was not expecting this. If you don't get a similar experience; try drinking it out of a tulip glass, that's what I did."
"i don't have much frame of reference, but this is refreshing, and also fun to drink with fruit flavoring added."
"I definitely liked this more than the New Glarus Berliner...this seemed to have more subtlety and finesse."
"Great marks for drinkability. This could easily be a session beer for me, and one I will revisit from time to time."
"Poured into 10oz pilsner type glass. Pours a light golden color with tons of fizzy soapy head. Smell is faint and in my opinion apple like. I've never had a lighter beer that tasted quite like this. Very funky taste in a good way. Tastes like a really light sour to me. Light mouthfeel almost like drinking water. Very drinkable, I will be enjoying this beer often in the summer months."
"D- this beer is 5 percent, awesome... give me this one all day"
"D: Strong! Very enjoyable."
"Mouthfeel is good -- stimulates the salivary glands with a moderate gush, not quite as intense as a gueuze, but strong enough. I really liked this, but I think I could stick with just one. Very satisfying."
"Overall, a very good beer - something I would drink more than one of in a night."
"Clear this time, no yeasty sediment if you pour it proper. Less sour than the first bottle, marvelous mouthfeel. Quite nice with a dash of real Woodruff syrup. Bumping taste up from 3.5 to 4.0. Total score goes from 3.7 to 3.85. This is a very nice example of the style when you get a good one. Would love to try fresh, age can't help this any way that I can think of. Bottle date would be very welcome."
"A very nice beer. I love the subtle honey overtones among the sour crispness. This beer would be great on a hot summer day in place of lemonade. My first berliner weisse but definitely not my last."
"The tartness might be a little much for a long session but this is a terrific beer and I'd like another."
"Drinkability- Enjoyed this beer. Would like to try a mainstay of the style if I get a chance, just to compare."
"D - i was not a fan of this beer."
"I really liked this beer. And would be interested in trying it with the raspberry or woodruff syrup that Berliners drink it with."
"Overall, an interesting beer that has potential if it gets more sour to it. Hopefully, my bottle was off and I can try a new one in the future. I do recommend as it is rare style and it does have a unique taste."
"Drinkability is really good because, for this type of beer, its the best. I could actually sit and drink this regularly, where as others of this style are more just for trying."
"A sour beer that is still very drinkable. To someone completely new to the style, this is a rather odd beer. Unfortunately, no other Berliner Weissbiers are readily available for comparison. The beer smells and tastes closer a sour white wine than most beer. It's not entirely unlike other sours that I've sampled. The pucker is relatively weak, and there's only a hint of barnyard tang. It's a bit yogurty, but that's a poor descriptor. All in all, it's actually further from the norms of beer than most sours despite being less ""sour."" It's not hard to drink at all. It's fairly vinous but less so than a Flanders Red or something. There are strong notes of fruity, spicy wheat, no surprise with its high wheat content and coming from one of, if not the, best wheat beer breweries. My opinion of the beer is higher than my average score. It is not a nice looking beer. The head fizzes up and rapidly dissipates leaving no lacing and a cloudy overripe banana yellow glass. The smell is yogurt sourness mixed with spiced wheat with a metallic note. The flavor is very good. It's refreshing and bizarre, at once. You can taste the lactic acid, but it's very clean and not off-putting. I should really give it a lower mark for feel with a fair bit of wateriness (apparently, water is added just before bottling for unknown reasons, although I imagine its to cut the sourness some) and some weird lactic stickiness, but the sour has such a refreshingly light pucker that I can't. It's astonishingly drinkable for such an odd beer. The bottle says that Napoleon's troops drank it in celebration of their victory in Prussia. I like that. I can imagine soldiers in funny hats having glasses of it. ""A soldier will fight long and hard for a bit of colored ribbon."" -Napoleon Bonaparte"
"1809 is very light and refreshing."
"7/4/7/4/13 (3.5/5)"
"I love beer, but every now and then I get into a kind of beer doldrums where nothing sounds good and I'm temporarily bored of all my usual favorites. When this happens, I find that the best way to cast off my beer blues is to find something new and different: 1809, in this particular case. I've wanted to try this brew for some time, but at $5.99 the price was usually enough to make think ""I'll try it next time."" Damn I'm glad I bit the bullet this time. Appearance is dramatic - I popped off the cap and a fountain of tart-smelling fizz burst out. Glad I had it over the sink... Poured into my hefeweizen glass, 1809 had a towering puffy white head which slowly dissipated to leave a constant layer of froth on the surface. The beer itself looks like liquid wheat and is impenetrably cloudy. The smell of wheat is unmistakeable, but I've never smelled a wheat-beer quite so sour as this. Taste is even more tart than the smell suggests - flavors akin to sour green apple, under-ripe nectarine and grape skin are dominant. The sourness, while extreme, is not in any way unpleasant (quite the opposite), which is good because the tartness lingers on your palate long after you swallow. Mouthfeel is prickly with tenacious carbonation, but otherwise a bit spritzery - could use some more body. Drinkability is good for the style, but this certainly isn't anything you'd want to drink all night. Still, I find it enjoyably different. 1809 is certainly a special beer, and although I wouldn't seek it out as a staple, I look forward to revisiting it."
"D: This is the first Berliner Weissbier I've had and hopefully I'll be able to find more of these."
"Bottle from Winking Lizard. Served with a cup of raspberry syrup which I declined. Pours a somewhat hazy yellow-gold color with a medium thin bone white head that diminishes slowly. Patches of lacing on the glass. Tart fruit, doughy malt and spices in the nose. Light-bodied and clean with a tart citrus and raspberry character. Mild spices and grainy malt flavors as well. The finish is fruity with a lingering tartness afterward. Overall this is pretty interesting."
"Had this in bottle at The Metropolitan in Baltimore. I've only had a few (maybe 3) berlinerwisses in my life so I though this would be a good opportunity to taste another example of a hard to find, not often brewed style. The appearance was what I would expect from a wisse; bubbly white head and golden straw clear body. The smell was very light except for the hint of funk I was hoping would indicate some sourness in the flavor. Ahh yes the hint of sourness on the finish was there, and pretty well balanced as well. It's just enough funk that other flavors are not over powered and the beer doesn't require a lot of other ingredients to compensate for balance. Mouth feel is light, watery and refreshing. Drinkability is a little above average just because it's not a session beer to me, but I would start a session with one anytime. I also like the mission of this brewer; to bring old obscure styles back to life, but do it true to form, history and original recipes. Simple plan yet very effective."
"Worth a shot!"
"Nice citrus zest in the nose, hinting at the tartness but other than that, absolutely nothing. This beer is great- very drinkable and simple enough to be perfect on a hot summer day. I get a nice punch of tartness initially, but it has a very nice clean finish. Maybe some lime in the taste, but high carbonation throughout regardless. I love the berliner weiss style- but i have yet to find one that is tart enough for me. I suppose that's the segue to venture into sour ales."
"The body is light but some of the lemongrass gives it a fuller feel. I would like this to be much drier. Carbonation is non-existent. Overall a pretty boring berliner weiss."
"Interesting, not my style."
"Napoleon and his troops called this ""lively and elegant," apparently, and while it's got something about it that's failing to blow my mind, I would have to agree with that. It a little less intense in tartness and dryness than some other Weissbiers, but clearly solidly made, and not a thing wrong with it. Pairing with sauerkraut--which it has parallels to, flavor- and aroma-wise--would be complete Germanic insanity."
"The aroma has sour wheat, sour kraut, barley, and yeast with virtually no hops. The appearance is hazy with gold color and a nice head. The flavor is sour but not overly so and very much like the aroma. The palate is thin but just right. Overall it's close to being good."
"Notes from and tasted on 6/12/07."
"This was a more citrusy and carbonated brew as apposed to the Bayerischer Berliner which was more bready and smoother. They both were good though...."
"D- This is not the most complex beer, but it is extremely drinkable. I could drink this brew all night long! Recommended."
"D: Quite an excellent beer. The perky character of the style is nice to enjoy, and the lower ABV makes this very easy to do."
"D-I've had festina peche -but this is my first real berliner. When I tried Brooklyn-Schneider I imagined a real berliner to taste like this. This is exactly what I expected and it is very good-a style I wish more brewers would pick up. The acidity gets to ya after a little bit but its one I would definately trade for again."
"My first Berliner Weisse. I'm a fan. Too bad this was exceptionally expensive, $12.50 for a 0.5L bottle from Toronado. I wish this was more widely available. A great refreshing, light bodied beer."
"Drinkability: The crispness from the carbonation and the tartness makes this a very drinkable beer..light and refreshing."
"For sour beer lovers, this is a must try. If I can find this again, it will most definitely make its way into my shopping cart!"
"Tart/sour and yeasty with a hint of sweet. There's a fruitiness that makes this one not need the fruit syrup that modern interpretations of the style often have. Perhaps a bit too acidic and tart to drink ""all day long", but I certainly wanted another after I was finished (which unfortunately didn't have - will have to get again!). If this is indeed a true ""historical""/"traditional"" interpretation, I can indeed see how Napolean and his troops were pleased (as described on the label)!"
"Pours a peachy-yellow with a pillowy white head that falls off after a short while. Somewhat cloudy, laces brokenly. Smells of lactic sourness, wheat, gooseberries, alcohol. Taste is mostly a thin wheaty flavor up front, with a distinct tartness and growing sour quality. Alcohol present too, which I find surprising and out of character for the style. Ethanol actually distracts from the flavor and reduces the complexity of the sour flavors. Didn't have any syrup to add so I wasn't able to see how it improved the beer, but I feel like even a B.W. should be reviewed based on how it tastes straight. Thin bodied, kind of watery. I've had a few Berliner Weisses and this has been both the least interesting and the least palatable."
"Drinkability... If you don't mind the tartness, this is a refreshing, easily drinkable beer... Authentic and true..."
"Poured a 16.9oz bottle into my Unibroue tulip. This beer pours a clear, straw yellow with a nice 2 inch white head. The aroma of this beer is what reminds me of sweet tarts. Definite sour notes, with a little grain, and just a hint of brown sugar. The taste is sour wheat malt. It seems to me to be really 1 dimensional. Just tart with a bit of what reminds me of green veggies. The mouthfeel is light and crisp. While drinkable, I find it just a little to tart for a beer that's not a sour."
"This beer gets more drinkable everytime I try it. Mmmm. Wish I saw it available more often."
"D- For a sour beer, this is pretty easy to drink but still not one that I have all the time."
"Bottle from Ledger's Liquors. Poured into a pint glass. Hazy gold with a large white head. Expectedly fizzy due to the sourness. Aroma is wheaty banana with a meringue note. Flavor is raw tart lemonade with wheaty maltiness and banana esters, some apple, a touch of clove. Very drinkable and crisp."
"D - This brew was decent enough, but in the end it was a little bland and boring. It's uniqueness lies in the sourness which doesn't hold my interest very long. While very refreshing and crisp, it doesn't do much to engage the senses though it isn't mild enough to sip on all night."
"Very nice. I'm glad I was able to try an authentic German version of the style. This will have to go into my regular summer rotation. It's a shame the end of the season is coming soon."
"Overall very unusual beer but highly enjoyable. They said on the bottle it is mash hopped and uses no wort boil. Strange. I think I'm a fan of the style now."
"Overall, it was a very refreshing beer. I think I could have a couple of these no problem."
"PROST! Beertracker"
"Drink extremely easy."
"I'm definitely happy living in the 21st century, but all 700 of Berlin's 19th century weissbier breweries probably made a compelling argument that life was certainly worth living before electricity. The label claims Napoleon and his troops called this style ""lively and elegant", so it would seem they certainly knew good beer. Maybe this is to blame for all those invasions?"
"Served in my SA Sensory Pint. Pourd a hazy, pale yellow with lots of tiny bubbles effervescing from the base to the cap. Four inch rocky bright white head sizzled and popped, reducing it's volume to 1/8th of it's original size within a minute; no lacing on this one. Nose was citrusy and tart with a subtle indication of yeast in the back. Citrus character revealed as lemon zest, but flavors consistent with nose as well as the presence of a mild wheat character towards the finish. Nice refreshing mouthfeel. Lively and effervescent through the mouth before culminating in a slight pucker at the finish. Easy drinking and refreshing on a warm, sticky NE day. Another excellent offering from Brauerei Weihenstephan."
"D- Over all this is a good representation of this style of beer."
"A very tasty beer that I wish was less expensive so I could have it more often this summer. It's not complex but does fit to style quite well."
"This beer was good, it has a fuller body than I would expect, and the lactic acid flavors could be more pronounced. Very drinkable beer though."
"I honestly thought that this was going to be a light beer with a light taste of just malted wheat. Boy was I wrong!! In the end this was a great light yet sour and tart lemony beer. Who needs the flavor syrup when it comes to this Berliner Weisse? Not me!"
"Drinkability is perfect. I would drink this beer all summer long if I could get it cheaply, which I don't think is really possible. If you see it, definately pick it up. If you are wary, perhaps try Festina Peche from dogfish head first and go from there."
"I should add that the second half of this bottle I paired with a small block of fresh Creamy Havarti from a local cheesemaker - stunning!"
"So well done. I am more impressed by this beer than I have been by the sum of all other Berliner Weisses I've had to date (not many). This is a style I will seek out more of, but I imagine that this will be the benchmark."
"500ml brown bottle from Ron's Market in Farmington. Pours a hazy light straw color with a good inch of short-lived off-white head. Smells fruity/citrussy, spicy, and slightly sour. Tastes fruity - citrus, apple, equally sweet and sour with a fairly dry clean finish. Light bodied with ample carbonation. Tasty, unique, complex, and super-drinkable. A new favorite!"
"Even though I like funk more in music than in beer, I appreciate the craft involved in concocting this thing. Very well-made, thirst-quenching and enjoyable."
"Not sure I'd like to drink this everyday , but it's easy drinking."
"The beer does not disappoint on impact. This takes the traditional Weiss style and adds a kick of sour-fruity tartness (think lactic acid). The tight carbonation adds to the flavor profile and gives this beer a very refreshing quality. Truly a great summer beer."
"Simply put, Brauerei Weihenstephan 1809 is the best Berliner Weissbier that I've had so far. I can't see myself drinking beer of this unique style very often, but it's nice to know there's a damn good one out there. If you're curious about the style, start here."
"D: I would like to try other brands in this style and would probably like this beer better closer to its source. Not sure I will be picking it up in the bottle again any time soon."
"Very good beer. Very different flavors, in a good way. I can see why this style would be served with a syrup, but I don't think it's necessary for this particular beer."
"Great summer time session beer, would tire after 3 or 4, but man this cuts the dust! I can't find much fault with this style-wise or flavor-wise"
"1 pt .9 fl oz bottle: Aroma is tart, lemony, nice pungent almost sour hop aroma, and green apples. Pours a clear golden color with really nice lacing bubbling up the side of the glass. Taste is nice and sour, citrus, tart, light hop characteristics, awesome taste in my honest opinion. Palate is very carbonated on the lips, and aftertaste has a lingering sweetness and tartness. Overall, This is the prefect style for a hot summer day. My first Beliner I thought it was a sour disgusting mess. Now I love the style. Cheers!"
"D - My first of the style and I really enjoyed it. A very good weiss beer."
"Drinkability: For a sour beer, this is compellingly easy to drink"
"Ah, very refreshing but still strong in flavor. The aroma is a bit musty and bready with sour fruit notes in there. The appearance is a clear, straw yellow, easily mistakable for your common wit. The flavor is obviously sour with a slight starchy taste with light fruit, big cut green apple, slight must, subtle acid, and finishing with mild wheat and lemon. Finishes a bit dry, what a nice beer."
"This beer pours a somewhat hazy pale orange color. The head is one inch in height, and recedes slowly into a firm cap of lacing. The aroma is of funky and sour with some dark fruit and plums. The taste has more of a sour zing to it, and some nice acidity in the finish. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with a lot of refreshing carbonation. Overall, this is a very nice Berliner Weisse. I will certainly drink this again."
"D: Very tasty, goes down quite easily, not filling at all, mild kick, very good representation of style, this is an excellent light and flavorful beer that is worth drinking for a whole evening."
"Mouthfeel is reminiscent of ginger ale with large active carbonation. Likely to style, but not to my tastes. Highly drinkable, but I wouldn't reach for another. Altogether a fairly straightforward beer that doesn't carry much depth. I don't see the call for syrup as necessary."
"D) The tart-sweetness, combined with the light fizziness strikes me like it would be a very nice summer celebration beer. It is tart, but very slightly, and leaves me wanting another."
"Poured from 16.9 oz bottle into a duvel snifter. Poured a cloudy murky straw color with thick foamy white head very little lacing. Smell is a mixture of lemon zest, banana phenolic, apple cider, and sour lactic scents. Taste is extermely refreshing with a sour citur dry flavor again with some apple flavor minus hop and only slightly bitter. Mouthfeel is crisp and refreshing with a light body. I could drink this beer on the beach, mowing the lawn, pretty much anywhere and especially in times of hot weather because I think its more refreshing then lemonade. First Berliner weissbier and to me its a nice one."
"D: Refreshing and not put off like I thought I would- might be growing into appreciation of the style. Still a bit too tart to have too many at once but great for summertime Im sure."
"Overall: I loved Festina Peche which sent me in search of other wonderful Berliner's. Fishingnet from ratebeer told he to get this one. Boy was he right. Tons of nice light flavor with wonderful drinkability. I can see me sipping many of these during the hot Florida summer days."
"1809 turns out to be a great brew that is lower on the abv but packs a lot of flavor. A definite session beer and something to be enjoyed while outside on a warm day. I will pick this up again without question."
"D: Overall a very refreshing beer with great yeast attributes providing a sour citrusy bite makes this beer truly standout in its class. Very good drinkability and a very good rating overall within style."
"D: Very drinkable for the style."
"Very interesting for sure.. I should probably get some more.. but beer funds are limited.. Hopefully the Matt has a couple more when I go hunting.. This would be fantastic on a hot summer day."
"D- I could drink this all day. I am making a homebrew version of this later this month and I cannot wait to have it here to drink this summer. This is a beer you could drink 4 or 5 of."
"D: This is a good beer and I know this is supposed to the one of the quintessential beers of the style, but I've had better."
"Taste & mouthfeel - An even mix of fruity, phenolic flavors and lactic sourness. Banana bread and lemon juice come to mind. Light-bodied and spritzy. Very refreshing and drinkable."
"Drinkability - mostly tasted for posterity, but after the experience, I would have it in Berlin, no problem."
"D - Tasty. Poured the yeast in half way through and the only difference I noticed was the clarity."
"Pours a straw to golden in color, vibrant and clear with the lightest haze. A white head rises up and falls, though very active carbonation keeps coming up throughout. Smell is of tart fruits, light grain and wheat. Taste expands on the subtleties the nose provides. Good and sharp, crisp flavors hitting the tongue. It starts somewhat dry with wheat but moves to tart fruits. Green apple, nearing sour at times. Light orange, lemon, and banana flavors. A refreshing and again crisp mouthfeel, very big on carbonation. At times it's near creamy to the tongue. Reminds me somewhat of champagne but I could drink this more easily...not bad at all."
"Certainly not bad, but not what I was looking for either."
"This beer had a Lambic type aroma. The finish on the beer was tart. The mouthfeel was champagne like."
"This is a beer that I could drink all day long on a hot summer day."
"Pours a slightly cloudy lemon yellow with a fine white head that disappears quickly, save for a persistent ring from the abundant carbonation. The aroma is that of a great hefeweizen with a sharpness from the Brett. The flavor is true to the smell, with a clear sourness that does more to balance the malty body than the light hop bitterness. Absolutely adherent to style and with such clean and crisp flavors that the addition of the woodruff or respberry syrup traditional with this style would be a sacrilege. Certainly will inspire a homebrewing batch in a month or so."
"Pours a clouded straw gold with a very sizeable brighter white head. Nose is yeasty and wheat. Touch of citrus. Just the nose you want on a weisse. Flavor is extremely tart and tangy, so much so that it really grabs the back of your mouth. Very strong citrus tones. Long lasting lighter aftertaste combines with a lot of small bubbles on the tongue and a good liquid feel. Heavily drinkable, though that first taste really hit the back of my mouth and sent me for a spin. After that though it was very smooth sailing. Well worth trying. Even though the price tag was a wee bit high."
"Bottle courtesy of jjpm74: Poured a cloudy and hazy deep yellow color ale with some white hue also noticeable and a huge pure white bubbly head with some good retention and minimal lacing. Aroma consists of wheat malt with some sour notes. Taste consisted of wheat malt with some medium sour notes without much acidity. Full body with some good carbonation. Very well done, easily drinkable and I am just glad somebody tries to brew this though to get style."
"500 ml Bottle, poured in to my Orval glass. Hay yellow with a big, fizzy white head. A soft wheaty aroma, with plenty of fruity citrus acidic notes. To me, that flavor is not much different that your average weissbier, then you get to the ultra refreshing tartness. Super dry finish. Really glad I picked this one up today."
"the tartness is quite a bit more prevalent in the taste, and really carries the rest of the flavor profile on its back. some sweetness, but the citricity is the most noticeable of the flavors. coriander and other spices come through. caraway?"
"Pours hazy straw color. Lots of carbonation. Aroma is slightly sour, lemony/citrusy. Mouthfeel is spritzy, a bit like champagne. There's a pleasant tartness and nice citrusy flavor. A tad too sweet. It would be a nice refreshing beer on a hot day. Overall enjoyable"
"The beer departs the 500ml bottle a hazy light gold, the head monstrous in size, a bright creamy white, and it fades slowly, leaving the lace a thick and tight sheet upon the glass. Nose has a sweet and sour tone, fresh, crisp, spicy and mouth watering to say the least. Start is sweet with grain, tart at the back with the top light to medium in feel. Finish has a modest acidity, the sweet and sour taste continues to the end, quite dry and a good representative to the style."
"I give it '5's because it is a perfect example of the style."
"D: The sourness takes some getting used to, but true to Weihenstephaner fashion, this is a good beer. I'll probably stick to the hefe next time though."
"D: This one is a first for me, as I had read some about the style but had yet to try one. I found it to be primarily a weissbier with a kick, a sour punch to the palate that was most welcome. The lightness of character make for good drinkability, but the tartness may wear on the tastebuds after a while. Still, drinkable in its own right."
"Drinkability - this is good ale. Owing to the taste, I think this goes well with, and around appetizers, dinner, and dessert, but I don't think it would be a stand alone session beer."
"Pours a hazy golden/yellow, thin white head, no lace, settles to a thin collar on the glass. Smell is sweet, nice and fruity, apples, nice tartness, wheat, candy, pretty unique. Taste is light banana/clove, bread, lemony citrus, acidic tartness in the finish. Mouthfeel is light bodied with medium carbonation, very refreshing. Could see myself drinking lots of this in the heat."
"This is my first Berliner Weisse and I am definitely enjoying it and will be buying more in the future."
"A great representation of the style and a refreshing beer overall. A little too tart for the fall season, but it's my fault for opening it now anyway. Save it for late spring/summer, and it'll be money."
"Drinkability: Tart, crisp and refreshing."
"The label on this beer is quite informative, but I wasn't sure who actually brewed this beer. Apparently, the recipe is quite old and is an attempt to capture an authentic style. How much comprising with modern techniques went into the actual brewing process would be interesting to investigate. Nevertheless, this is a very good Berliner weiss. The beer poured a nice head that dissipated pretty quickly, was a bit hazy, and yellowish. The smell was subdued and not overpowering. I did pick up some candied citrus flavors in the smell. The taste is very good, almost cidery in quality. You will get a very smooth, tart apple, sweet citrus taste that goes down very easily. The beer isn't particularly complex and contains no huge transmutations from start to finish, nor cold to more room temperature. It is a bit watery, with a mouthfeel that is quite light. This beer is well worth seeking out."
"Incredible lemon aromas combine with a seriously pure yet undescribable sour note that's evident in aroma and taste. Sharp to both the nose and palate, the intense pang of lemon/lime pith and peel provide a lightly briny, lightly salty, flavor of savory sensation and thirst quenchment. A side note of light must, sweaty, dust, and driftwood provide the most shallowest of funk notes. But with all the challenging flavors to the untrained palate, this beer showcases well the style of Berlinerweiss. Big on acidity yet light on astringency, this beer is a welcomed thirst quencer for lovers of light wheat beers who want more complexity but perhaps lower alcohol then finishing with a tampering bready wheat aftertaste."
"One of the very few I have tried and this by far has been the best its just unbelievably drinkable.Poured into a standard pint glass a dull lemon color with a sptritzy white head almost like a sparkling lemonade,a little funk was noticeable in the aroma wich is a bit unpleasant but it has a nice lemon pith note that makes it a little better.Non as mind numbing tart as the others I have had this has just enough tartness to make it refreshing and not mouth puckering a bit of wet grain as well but the lemony flavors linger for a long time they still are.Man would this be a summer quencher although I am not one to drink beer real cold I bet this would be the shiznit very cold on a hot day,very nice."
"A bit sticky in the palate, but is still rather clean for the style."
"1.83"
"Mothfeel is light to medium bodied with a light carbonation that helps make this a refreshing warm weather beer."
"Drinkability: Not so bad, really. In fact, it's so tasty, I just HAD to tell the world!"
"drinkable?: sure, sept for the greens"
"drinkability is good. light and refreshing. my first experience with this interesting style, and i really enjoyed it. definitely something i'll have to try again, and maybe attempt brewing myself."
"Pretty drinkable, but I don't think I'd spend the bucks for a case of it."
"D - A very tasty ale and the light sourness gives you just enough to continue wanting to drink the beer. The wheat and carbonation are refreshing and when the yeast is added even more grainy, nutty spice flavors show up. A bready quality is apparent and very enjoyable. Quite drinkable summer beer and big flavor for a 5% ale."
"This is an absolute perfect example of a berliner weisse. I can't imagine drinking it with syrup, though. It pours with little head, and it's a pale yellow with cloudy yeast. The aroma is slight lemon and light flowers with yeast. Mouthfeel is spritzy, the tartness of the taste changing the mouthfeel. Refreshing, light, and extremely quaffable. I'm glad the world's oldest brewery hasn't sold out."
"Created by Dr. Fritz Briem, this beer is brewed as a collaboration between the Doemens Institute and Weihenstephaner. Half-liter bottle with loads of info, yet no freshness date; unpasteurized, unfiltered, and bottle-conditioned. Pours into the weizen glass a clouded, milky-yellow, lighter than a witbier, with high carbonation and a finger of white head that disappears, then reappears. It smells phenolic, spicy, almost funky, with tart, husky wheat, and a dash of hops. The flavor is similar, but adds a big lemon and yeast kick, a hefty lactic sourness, notes of banana, tart/nutty wheat, and a mild bitterness from the green/grassy/spicy hops. Its body is light, smooth, and almost dry, with medium carbonation and finish. My first experience with a Berliner Weisse - if this were a blind tasting, I'd call it a hefe gone sour... the intentional sourness, however, is pleasing and quite refreshing. Recommended, and worth seeking out."
"Pours a hazy blonde body, like grapefruit juice, with a rapidly diminishing white head. Some patchy lacing left on the goblet. Aroma has a sour lactic note, with green apples and green banana skins in the forefront. Some wheat malt underneath. Light bodied with crisp carbonation and an acidic bite. Taste is tart and acidic. Green apples, wheat biscuits,and lemon drops dance around in the spritzy carbonation pool. Seems like a cousin to a Flanders Red Ale with its sour bite. Fascinating style that is supremely refreshing. Wish there were more breweries trying these."
"Cheers!"
"readily available by me.. I am going to buy more this summer without a doubt. I would recommend this to those who like geuze as well."
"A quickly diminishing frothy white head covers a hazy pale yellow beer. Aroma is dry and sour...I'm not sure how else to describe it. Sweetly fruity in some sense, but mostly funky with a lactic sourness. The taste follows suit, but the sourness is not as upfront. Wheat appears cleanly before the tartness takes hold like funky lemon juice with an almost salty trace. Light bodied, dry, and very refreshing. My glass is empty already?"
"The second pour yields a taste that is a touch more yeast, and thus bread-like and perhaps a touch less tart. This is a tasty beer; I would be really curious as to how this will bottle condition over the years; I certainly wish I had more of this right now, so I will have to pick up a couple bottles the next time I have a chance. I think that this beer might get considerably better after some age on it."
"Interesting beer... is this specially brewed for the distributor here in America? Hmmm. Anyway, it pours the typical Berliner Weisse appearance with a slightly hazy golden body and short head of bright white foam. It offer the typical slightly-sour and mildly wheatish grainy nose, and it delivers the same tartness and graininess in the flavor. Hop flavors are not to be found, as expected, and the bitterness is next to nil, but not needed anyway. It could be a bit more sour like the Kindl Weisse, but at the same time this is probably a tad more accessible to the general public. And it's remarkably clean, which can sometimes be difficult in the production of this style. So, in an ever smaller world of Berliner Weisse, I'd say this has to come out within the top three. Well worth trying."
"1809 pours an absolutely beautiful golden color with a white head from a brown 16.9 ounce bottle. It definitely smells like a German wheat beer, banana and clove are noticeable, as is a lactic acid type of smell. I definitely get banana and clove at the end of the flavor, the middle is all lactic acid and citric flavors and I like it. The sourness here is refreshing, like a sour glass of lemonade might be. I like the mouthfeel, it's very carbonated in a champagne like way. A really good beer."
"Pours a proper hazy hue berliner weisse. Light fruity scents that are pronounced with the green woodruff syrup. Light tartness and elegantly sour. Clean finish and refreshing all the way. At first I went light on the syrup, then I added a few spoonfuls towards the end of the 16 oz'er bottle. Overall a proper style that went back easily."
"NOTE: I decided to concoct my own fruit syrup as I've heard such a mixture is added to Berliner Weiss' in their traditional setting. Using a mixture of blended peach and strawberry and a simple syrup strained through a mesh filter, I added the concoction to the beer. The appearance was dramatically improved upon by the resulting Champagne-esqe head with tremendous staying power. The taste was altered a good deal and was honestly (If I do say so) quite good but I wouldn't say better per se. It was simply different. If I were to choose, I would take the beer in its original form sans syrup and enjoy the sheer sourness and uniqueness of the experience."
"My first dip in to this style and up until actually trying it I expected something more sour from what I've read. This is not the case, the beer is only mildly tart and it really only serves the beer well rather than being overwhelming like you might find in even domesticated lambic. Awesome beer."
"Poured from a 500ml brown bottle into my shaker ""pint"" glass. Appears a slightly cloudy golden yellow/orange color with about two fingers of white foam. Smells of crisp wheat as well as a mild sourness. Taste is refreshingly sour, almost addictive, making you crave another sip. Lemon and yeast are also present. Medium bodied with moderate carbonation that works perfectly with this beer. An excellent warm weather beer. Wish I would have bought more than one bottle."
"Pours a cloudy straw color with a good initial head that fades fast. Smell is of hay, a slight lactic sourness, and a touch of grain. The flavor is surprisingly gentle. I was expecting and hoping for something a little more sour. The sourness is pleasant and quite yogurty, but I wanted something more brisk. In some ways this Berlinerweiss is more complicated than some others, and I like the taste, but I'm not sure or not if it is true to style.In any case, you won't be adding syrups to this one. Its also a little higher alcohol than most. Mouthfeel is creamy and delicious, but not as crisp as some. Drinkable if a bit different."
"Pours a cloudy straw color with a decent white foamy head and lots of bubbles. Lots and lots and lots of bubbles. The new champagne of beers, anyone? The aroma is a lemony butter scent, or a buttery lemon scent, depending on how you want to look at it. Light and airy, it smells like a field of grass on a crisp spring day. Not overwhelming, but nice and to the point. Admittedly, I've never had a true Berliner Weisse in Germany (woe is I) but I truly love this style of beer. Kinda reminds me at times of the tart Flemish sour reds in the Belgian highlands. This definitely holds up. Tart and tangy, with a strong lemony/citrus zest, the 1809 packs a puckering punch and, in my opinion, is really really addictive. I could drink this beer all day (and perhaps all night). It's that good. Wonderful in the summertime especially. I can see why the Germans put flavored sweeteners in theirs, but I personally like this style just the way it is. Mouthfeel is crisp, but smooth, and finishes with dryness and a lingering tang. Gotta stock up on more of the 1809 for the rest of the summer."
"This beer poured a cloudy straw color and formed a huge foamy white head that refused to go away but eventually did, coating the glass with latticed lace. A heavy amount of carbonation is present. An aroma of hops, banana, clove and yeast. The flavor was of hops, citrus and clove. The body is light and the finish is tart. Similar to in some ways to a hefe, but definately different flavor."
"D- This beer has a light tangy note but it is very filling. This beer is smooth but there is not much depth of flavor and the tartness is a bit too soft to keep in interesting."
"1 pint 0.9 oz bottle served in a Kindl Weisse glass. I'm very happy to find a new (to me) Berliner Weisse. It pours a hazy straw color with a finger of head that falls to a patchy coat over the beer. Haze is prevalent and carbonation is rapidly escaping from solution. Just as expected. The nose is definitely in the realm of hefeweizen, with a banana/clove ester present along with a lemony citric tinge and a lactic acid sharpness. I really like the character brought to the style with the hefe characters. The flavor hits immediately with a lemony tartness and lactic bite that fades to a creamy banana and clove character, rounding out with a strong wheaty creamyness. Enjoyable. Mouthfeel is light to moderate with a moderate carbonation. The acidic character leaves some stringy spit behind, making me want some water to go along with it. Overall, this one is very nice. This is a beer to sit and drink on a nice warm day...no syrup needed. The hefe base to it really adds a dimension to this one that I don't recall from other experiences with the style. I will be drinking this one again, and soon."
"Given this is my first experience tasting the style, but after reading it would seem that this is true to the style. Its also quite tasty, drinkable and refreshing. Although it really doesnt require fruit syrup it would be interesting to taste the beer"
"It is bottle-conditioned, unfiltered and unpasteurized. ""1809"" will age beautifully in a dark and cool location. Its complex fruitiness and tartness will most likely develop in quite astonishing ways. 1809 is fermented in traditional open fermenters and horizontal lager tanks. The applied mashing regime is a single step decoction mash with 50 % wheat malt.The total amount of hops is added to the mash so that isomerisation takes place in the decocotion part of the mash. The wort is not boiled but only heated up to boiling temperature and then transferred to the open fermenters and pitched with yeast and lactic acid bacteria (isolated from malt) at 18 °C (64°F)."
"A little pricey , but probably worth it once in a while."
"I have never had another Berliner Weisse so I have no basis for comparison but this beer is amazining. It pours a thick hazy golden body with a head that quickly thins out. The taste has a lactic bitterness, somewhat like good yogurt, with citrus presence as well. Apparently Napolean loved this shit."
"The balance between sourness and traditional weissbier flavors work really well. This is a fantastic beer, and If its representative of the style, I like this style. Its like a lambic without the funk."
"As for its long term drinkability, I do not think this would be an all night kind of beer, but would be better suited to getting used to first."
"I could see how this would be a really easy style to mess up, but this beer just nails it."
"This beer poured a hazy gold/straw color with lots of fluffy head. Aroma was light clove and sourness. Flavor was also a blend of sour and cloviness. I felt this beer was less sour than Berliner Kindl Weiss. I had this beer with a meal, and I noticed a pleasing fruitiness as the beer warmed which was really a nice complement to my meal. Mouthfeel was soft and champagne-like. I really thought highly of this beer."
"The mouthfeel is good. Light and refereshing. A good lawnmower drink."
"The body is quite light and dry. The carbonation is so light it almost can't be felt on the palate. If it weren't for the lactic acid burn, this would seem almost flat. I am going to make this my new summer drinker, though I may have to take it easy at $5 a half liter."
"Label notes: ""Brewed with traditional mash hoping and without wort boiling. This along with a traditional strain of lactic acid bacteria provide a fruity and dry but palateful (sic) character."""
"Pours a very light, slightly cloudy yellow with a tinge of gold. Delicate, perfectly white head that kicks up and stays put but leaves no lace. Big, pungent aroma of funky, sour citrus notes (lemon and grapefruit). Distinct lactic acid smell laid on top of a slightly grainy note. On the palate, soft fruit flavors come out first, but then things sharpen up with whip-crack acidity that starts light and then gains weight through the mid-palate. The mid-palate has a very metallic flavor to it, then gives off one final burst of sourness before fading into a surprisingly sticky finish. Wonderfully bold acidity and citrus flavors -- kind of like a good New Zealand sauvignon blanc. Light in body, lots of activity on the sides of my tongue, stiff carbonation. I don't have much experience at all with this style, but I'm really impressed with this beer. Great for summer time, great for summer foods, very distinctive and interesting."
"This was my first experience with this style, and quite a positive one. Delicious flavor and super drinkability. A bit pricey at $5 for 16.9oz, but well worth it for the experience. I hope to find this again, but I suspect that it's quite a rare find."
