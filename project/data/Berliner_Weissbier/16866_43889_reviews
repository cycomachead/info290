"Very tart nose, wheat, acidic. Palate: acidic, lemony, hazy pale straw, head is large and fluffy but quickly dissipates, very highly effervesce, light tart, refreshing, no hops, light fruitiness, light body, high carbonation, no alcohol presence, refreshing."
""
"Tastes OK,was expecting bigger flavor"
""
"Still not sure what to think. The wheat comes in as a really strong aftertaste, and I am not sure if I like it or not."

""
"On tap at Naja’s Place in Redondo Beach. Smells funky with some bread. Starts citrusy and sour but finishes with wheat."
""
""
"Pours an opaque, muddy straw producing 2+ fingers of effervescent, white, shortlived head that leaves no lace. Aroma is wheat, lactic acid sourness, green apple & lemon/lime with a hint of Brett mustiness. Taste is very lactic, thin wheat malt, some citrusy & green apple fruitiness, a little Brett & brine. Fruitiness & brine most prominent in the finish. Afrertaste is tart & salty. I'm not sure that this is brewed with salt as is the case with Gose but it certainly has a saline twang.  Mouthfeel is light-medium bodied with medium carbonation, prickly, crisp, dry & puckering. If you liked Sweet Tarts candy as a child then you will most likely give this a solid 4-5."

"Transparent shiny golden with everlasting white head. Aroma of wheat, sour grapes, floral notes. Tastes of wheat, sourness, lemon zest, spritzy backyard fruit bucket. Light in body with high carbonation. Real nice, refreshing. Athletes could substitute this for Gatorade."
""
""
"Overall - Do yourself a favor and find some woodruff. Syrup is a must with this style of beer."

"D:  It's a cool, fall October day, so perhaps this style is out of season. My plans consist of watching a 2 hour Freddie Mercury documentary with my pregnant wife, so a 750mL bottle at only 3% is the perfect match.  Enough beer to last the movie, and no unwanted buzz. To sweeten it up a bit I am adding 1oz per pour of framboise liqueur.  The beer is a nice representation of the style, but the extra sweetness (as suggested by the bottle) really elevates the beer to another level.  This could be a go to for the style, especially at $10 a bottle."

"Overall: Very decent and balanced brew. I could crush a pint and carry on my day. I couldn't do pint after pint though. The funk could get too much. This brew is worthy."

"O: Refreshingly easy to drink. Seems simple in description, but so complex on the palate. Low ABV...you won't get bombed on this, this is a beer to drink simply to enjoy a great beer. Recommended."

"Hottenroth feels like The Bruery going hard on some William Eggleston grind -- full spectrum of emotional color here. Nestled amongst the many hued sunsets and supermarket promontories and pre-war lamps tossing their many hued lights there is something pristine/sinister that feels utterly appropriate and inextricable from the total composition. A real glassfull of considerate juxtaposition and moral play."

"Well-rounded in its tart and funky base parameters, and overall, a decently drinkable, and even refreshing at times version of the style - I've not had many chances to try the real deal, so take that with a grain of salt (sounds like something that's actually in this beer). I suppose I should try mixing this as is typically suggested, but for some reason I'm all out of woodruff."

"Pours a cloudy deep straw color with a white fizzy head. The aroma is sour and fruity, even had a ketchup like smell. In the taste, lactic tartness sour lemon, cooked veggie and stale wheat bread. The tart, refreshing nature of this beer is quite remarkable, as well as the amount of flavor in a 3.1% ABV beer. Medium bodied ale with a high level of carbonation. Overall, this is a good example of Berliner Weisse, not the cleanest, but has unique character. Worth sharing and a good choice for those fond of sour ale."

"O. An outstanding Berliner, one of the best I have had. It certainly leans towards the ""sour"" side of the style, with emphasis taken away from the biscuity, wheat qualities traditionally found in these beers. Wheat notes are there, but the early mid through the finish is one big puckery kiss of lemon, strawberry, and even some tart cherry. Fairly complex flavor profile for the style. Still, some traditionalists won't enjoy the acidity in play here. Nevertheless, I dig this beer quite a bit. Packing an inordinate amount of flavor, pucker, and complexity into a tight little sub-4% ABV package, The Bruery's Hottenroth is a welcome addition to my summer lineup."

"o: Might have been a bad bottle, but the label does say it is a ""Berlin Style Tart Wheat Ale."" And tart it is, to the point of making your mouth pucker and your eyes close and your face wince. The label also says ""Sour=Yum."" Not here. An $8 drain pour for me."

"This a very tart, refreshing Berliner Weise. Some earthy notes, and tastes on this beer."

"750 ml bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 6/4/2013. Pours moderately hazy pale straw color with a 1-2 finger fairly dense white head with poor retention, that reduces to nothing. Minimal lacing and moderate streaming carbonation. Aromas of big sour green apple, lemon, pear, grape, wheat, hay, straw, vinegar, clove, herbal, white wine, musty funk, and yeast earthiness. Fantastic aromas with great complexity and balance of fruity/funky yeast notes with slight malt presence; with great strength. Taste of big sour apple, lemon, pear, grape, hay, straw, wheat, vinegar, clove, musty funk, white wine, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Good amount of fruity/earthy tartness on the finish; with lingering notes of sour apple, lemon, pear, grape, vinegar, hay, straw, wheat, musty funk, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice balance, complexity, and moderate robustness of fruity/funky and tart yeast flavors with light malt presence; with a nice crisp balance of acidity and no cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and light bodied; with a smooth, crisp, and moderately acidic mouthfeel that is very nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish as expected of 3.1%. Overall this is a highly excellent Berliner weisse! All around great complexity, balance, and robustness of fruity/tart/funky yeast flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A highly enjoyable offering."

"Overall: I love the idea of this beer, a 3% refreshing sour beer for the summer. but the execution falls short for me. It doesn't look very good, the smell comes off too grassy, and its overly acidic"

"Pours an interesting looking hazy straw color with very minimal head but lots of fine suspended sediment particles. Smell is lemon, yeast, and tonic. You can smell the sour. Taste is very light, like drinking tonic water with lemon zest, some grassy notes, and wheat. Decently sour, but not puckeringly so. Feel is great! This is light, refreshing, easy to dink with high carbonation that enhances the sour taste. Great beer, super easy to drink. Good pizza beer."
""
"This is a very underrated beer. I think because of the price point and ABV level. Everyone seems to give big points to rare beers just because they are rare and high in ABV. I think this is my summer fishing beer for the future. I drank a lot of this. It has a perfect amount of sour to it and drinks very refreshing. I also enjoyed the nose a lot. Next time you see it give it a try. It is a wonderful Berliner Weiss."

"boy was I reluctant to pay 9 bucks for 12 ounces of 3% beer, but the bruery is the bruery, and I am a sucker, so I let it rip down at jake's in downtown Littleton. not as pale as most berliners, its got just a hint of darker malt color to it and a lacey little white head. smells lacto sour, lemons and acid, but I smell more than wheat as a grain. maybe a touch of rye or something in the copper family making it just a little more interesting than the generic. wild yeast and bacterial fermentation are obvious from the outset. citric funk dominates above the lightest grain bill ever. what I like though is that touch of something other than white wheat. it gives the beer a desirability all of its own, I don't need woodruff or cherry syrup for this, I want it on its own. ultra light in body, carbonated like soda, this is a really odd sensation. so acidic and low in alcohol it would be a chore to get drunk from it, but I guess that's the point. authentic with a twist, another winner from the bruery."

"O: Not blown away, but I enjoyed this. More sour than the German versions I've tried and not a whole lot of typical wheat smells/flavors. Not terribly complex or particularly pretty to look at, but drinks nicely. Refreshing."
"Overall impressed given the abv. Nice light sour, not a bad deal for $8. Very ideal session bier"
"O-The low alcohol content is phenomenal. A good beer at an amazing ABV."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Nice, well-done berliner with a restrained level of tartness. It's not in the same class as Tartare, or the fruited Florida-weisses available. But a really enjoyable drink nevertheless. Recommended."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A great summer beer. Very low alcohol. Sessionable."
""
"O: A light, crisp, low-alcohol beer with a refreshing sourness. It's not a complex beer but they style is geared for that."

"i really do appreciate a lot of the beers the bruery releases, but they should really consider doing 4pk releases or even 2pk of 12oz bottles. sometimes, you feel obliged to drink the full bottle in one sitting when you don't have any friends around.. and even a light beer like this - feels like too much for the palate for one to drink all by themselves. a great berliner weiss, for sure, but i'd rather have multiple servings of it in smaller quantities."
"O-This is an interesting, flavorful take on the Berliner style. The lemony sourness is quite puckering, but it works well against the full body of this beer. The brew packs a lot of flavor for just over 3% and doesn't need any syrup to keep it interesting. That being said, this Berliner is the lightest or most refreshing I have had because of the big taste and body."
""
""
""
"Overall - I really, really like this!"
"O- I am happy to have found this on tap and it was delicious. The slight tartness was refreshing for the palate and not sour at all for me. Great beer to have on a hot day!"
"O: Amazing brew!"
""
""
""
"Taste- Light sweet malt quickly taken over by lemon peel and unsweetened apples, and some grape juice to almost a wine character. This beer is dry very dry. Tartness is big but not over whelming."
"O- Smell, taste, pucker up, repeat."
""
""
"This is a great Berliner Weiss. I've had a few samples of this in the past that tasted like vegetable broth. This bottle did not. Instead, it has some nice wheat, lemon, and tart aspects. Not the best in the style, but worth a try."
"I've tried this several times and never had a consistent experience. This is delightful."
""
""
""
"Pours a cloudy straw with a head that fades quickly. No lacing. Aroma of fresh cut, tart green apples. Nice earthiness notes follow. Tartness hits the palate front and center with nice lemon notes. Finishes dry. Light bodied with light carbonation. Overall, this might be the best summer brew on the market - bracingly tart and very refreshing."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A great beer; very light and refreshing with lots of sour tartness and yeasty wheat characteristics. I could drink this all day."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - I have limited experience with this style. That being said, I have had better. This is an enjoyable style though. So with only having had a handful of beers in this style I have liked them all so far."
""
""
""
""
"Bottle poured in teku. Pours straw yellow, very clear, two finger white head with some big bubbles, once they fade the beer looks like a Chardonnay. Smell is slightly funky, bready, some citrus,. Taste hits you with pucker right up front, sour lemon, some wheat, some nice sweetness. The texture is very light, leaves your mouth watering for more. This beer is very good. An easy drinking sour that's abv is close to water. So glad I got to try this great sour."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Light and refreshing with a pleasant amount of tartness/sourness - not intensely tart/sour so an approachable Berliner Weissbier to get started with... Enjoyable and definitely one I would have again."
""
""
""
"The taste is very nice, with hints of citrus (mostly lemon), over the wheat, overall just a nice refreshing beer that I enjoyed in the sun. This is one of the easiest drinking beers that I have tasted, and I would recommend it to anyone (Unless you are trying to get drunk, as it is only 3.1% alcohol)."

"The beer is a light cloudy straw typical in color of any berliner weisse. The head is white but very weak in substance with big bubbles fading quickly. The lacing is light. The aroma is light with a light tartness some citrus and lots of bready yeast. I wish it was a little more sour. The taste is a light too, a little lemon citrus on the front followed by a little muted tartness. The feel is medium but very drinkable. Overall, a decently drinkable enjoyable beer but not tart enough to be an awesome berliner"
"o - overall, fantastic berliner. exactly what you want from the style...great summer day beer."
""
"TOTAL = 43/50"
""
"Overall, this is the best Berliner Weisse I've had, and I think it would stand up to comparison to most Belgian sours out there. Not quite the sour punch of a lambic, but the quality is every bit as good as a Cantillon or 3F."
""
"O/D-Pretty tasty. Its got some neat stuff going on at 3.1%. Its very agreeable and I don't really have anything bad to say about it; just happy to have copped a bottle."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is probably my favorite BW style beer to date. I've also had Bell's Oarsman, Professor Fritz Briem 1809 and DH Festina Peche. The 3.1% abv also makes it easy to polish off a full 750 without getting sloppy, so that's nice. I will definitely have to seek out additional bottles of this wonderful sour beer from The Bruery. The more I have their beers, the more impressed I become."
"The Bruery Hottenroth Berliner Weisse ---3.5/5"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"D: a really good take on the style. without necessarily trying a plethora of German-made examples of this style I think this is one hell of an American stab at it. get some."
"Cheers!"
""
"Overall I'm bumping this up because when mixed with a fruit beer like Rubaeus, it is actually very nice. Perhaps a fruit syrup mixed with this, as in traditional for the style, would make this a more complete beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Strong sour presence. Also, it's very dry. It's as if someone added unsweetened lemon juice. The aftertaste is lip-smackingly tart. Relatively watery and the high carbonation accentuates the thinness."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall (4/5): Hottenroth is a perfect summer beer. It's super refreshing, lighter, and has a nice tart berry/citrus thing going on. It IS a one-trick pony, but as far as domestic Berliner Weisses go, it's of very high quality–as to be expected from The Bruery. Good stuff."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- I really enjoyed this beer, very refreshing and tasty, as usual the berliner style is perfect for the summer weather would definitely have again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: It's super hot and humid tonight so this is perfect. I love this style more and more with each example I try. This one is world class as far as I can tell. Especially for an American brewer. This particular style is about to blow up. It's already popping up at more breweries and is building a following. Who doesn't love a refreshing, funky, low ABV beer? I've been searching for this beer for a few years and didn't really know why. I just had a feeling. Now I know my instincts were spot-on."
""
"O - Good example of the style and a fun beer to try. Another good Bruery offering."
"O - my second Berliner Weiss, lighter and more sour than the NG version. Very good for a hot summer day"

""
"O- It's a good example of the style and one of the most tart Berliner Weisses I have tried. The stickiness at the end makes a whole 750ml a little tough to finish."
"This is a fantastic Berliner! $9.60 for a sour that you can drink all day? RIGHT ON!"

"All of those imposing aromatics aren't as harsh on the palate as you might expect. Mild citrus with a gueuze like tartness... a delicious candidate for a brunch beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"A big $10 bottle of Berliner Weissbier that actually stands up to good German versions. Flavor and palate feel are excellent. Must try if you like the style."
"Probably only fitting I am drinking this great beer on the official first day of summer. So hitting the spot right now."
""
""
""
"O - This is crazy enjoyable. And at 3.1 you could drink it all day long. Throughout the whole bottle it doesn't get cloying at all and is super drinkable all the way through. 9/10 would buy again - especially at the price."
"Overall - These straight berliners suffer from simplicity, but this is an excellent example of the style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a truly refreshing beer. It's easy drinking and depending on the price, could be cheaper than Professor Fritz 1809. I prefer that beer, but for a Bruey beer, if you can find the right price. I recommend this."
""
""
""
"M: Light leading to medium bodied. High carbonation."
""
"O- This is a nice beer and very easy to drink. The only issue I have with this beer, and it is a small issue, is the amount of lactic acid in the finish. I feel this is a great example of a beer with low alcohol and nice big flavor. I can't wait to have this again!"
""
"Overall, a big let down. Would grab New Glarus or bells Berliner before this."
""
""
""
"Very, very nice Berliner. Super refreshing and insanely drinkable, but I guess that's pretty expected for the style. A little different than many Berliners in terms of the higher hoppage, but it's not enough to inject unwanted bitterness or distract from the nice, zesty fruits and soft wheat flavors. Very well executed, thanks again to cocoapuph for this. I might be asking him for more pretty soon!"
""
""
""
"Overall a really great, refreshing summer beer. I can't stop drinking this, and I'm not taking little sips, I'm taking full gulps."
""
""
"Overall: One of the best Berliners I've had. Nice tartness without, but not mouthpuckeringly sour. Extremely refreshing and I would definitely seek this out again. The only drawback is the price and the fact that it's only sold in large format bottles. This would be a perfect beer to put in 6 packs."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A very refreshing, classic take on the Berliner Weisse. This seems to be more to style than a lot of the Berliners we see around the states these days."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"overall perfect for summer and at only 3.1% you could enjoy this all day if you so desired. loved it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This was a nice, light offering from a solid brewery. This was a refreshing, light beer that was a bit tart but still highly drinkable. This would definitely be a great beer to have on hand on a very hot day."
""
""
""
"Overall, a very impressive Berliner Weiss and one of the better ones I have had. I enjoy it without any syrup as the flavor of the beer alone is wonderful."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"M: Light carbonation, tart dryness."
"Fantastically dry and painfully delicious. It invites sip after sip with a mouth stripping sour dryness. So tart, so delicious. Its better than candy ever could be. Its a sadomasochistic dream of a beer. Drink the 750ml to yourself but its better shared with friends. After all, how much fun is sadomasochism by yourself?"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Overall, an incredibly refreshing beer that is easy to drink and allows you to maintain your sobriety."
""
"Overall- This is my second or third Berliner Weiss and it's the best I've had yet. Super drinkable on a warm day like today. If I could get this regularly in the summer, I'd drink it all day especially at 3.1%."
"Beer is light in body, with carbonation levels of high intensity, resulting in a beer that's fizzy at first, then gradually becoming foamy and smooth on the palate; rather soda or Champagne-like. Closes quite dry, with little residual stickiness on the palate."
"O: a great beer for a warm day. the tartness is nice and the flavors are light yet still apparent. very drinkable and very enjoyable"
""
""
""
""
""
"Hazy straw color with an airy, frothy, pure-white head. Sour, lemony funk aroma met with grainy wheat. Tart lemon and light lactic sourness over fresh cereal grain continue into the flavor. Light, dry, and puckering mouthfeel. Just a very refreshing, easy to consume, true-to-style Berliner. Quite enjoyable..."
""
""
""
"Yep!"
""
""
"O- Though I wasn't expecting much from a 3.1% Berliner Weisse, I was at least looking forward to a more lively drink. This is just a limp version of the style. Only the second beer from The Bruery that I found to be less than great. The other was White Oak which was on the other end of the spectrum in terms of alcohol and flavor where there was too much of both."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Verdict: A quintessential Berliner Weissbier, the flavors are light, yet impactful and it has a great refreshing finish. The simplicity of this style is executed wonderfully, a really nice beer to share with friends."

"o - Overall a very nice, easy drinking berliner. It is sour and funky, but not overly in either direction, which makes it very easy to drink. I think this would be a good berliner to give to someone getting introduced to the style, as it is a good example of a lightly sour/funky beer without being overwhelming. Would like to have it again."
""
""
""
""
"Overall I am not particularly enthralled with this beer, the sour twang notes are a bit too light and the mouthfeel could use a slight carbonation bump. Flavor profile was not too far from an undersweetened lemonade."
""
""
""
"O- A very nice Berliner Weisse, it's very drinkable and refreshing. The tartness is spot-on in typical Bruery fashion, and the bacteria provide some nice complexity. Great stuff."
""
""
"Overall. A great Berliner Weiss. Love the style, loved this beer. Another nice one, Bruery!"
""
""

"I am not a seasoned drinker of this style. In fact, this is only the third one I have had. I reviewed the beer straight from the bottle, but this is the first time I also tried one with both of the traditional syrups added: Waldmeister (woodruff) and Himbeer (raspberry). While adding these sweet additions does tend to make it more softdrink-like (if overdone), I think everyone should try it. They work really well with this particular beer, especially when you just add a dash."
"The aftertaste is to die for - I hope to burp for a long time! The very low alcohol is nice for a change, the balance is kept, but it could stand more malt and the resultant kick. This is highly recommended."

"o - very quaffable and nice complexity for a 3% ABV beer. very refreshing."
"O- this beer is not as sour as I've heard it was, and is instead a tart thirst quencher, and is a well crafted version of the style that doesn't stray outside of the lines like the brusry usually does."

"Picked up a couple bottles of this at Provisions yesterday. This is one of my favorite Bruery offerings. Pours a nice hazy golden wheat color with an inch of white head. Refreshing scent of lemon, freen apple, and a nice grainy quality. Pleasant tartness on the palate. Sourness level is perfect for my taste. Nice wheat character along with lemons. Perfect beer for a summer day. Would love to see this distributed in Colorado."

"Pure to style with low alcohol, and nice mix of tart and funky. Flavor really comes out as it warms but I could see taking it a bit colder for a hot July afternoon. Nice beer."
"Overall: I wouldn't have minded a touch more tartness, but I still really enjoyed this beer. I don't know that I've had a better American Berliner."
""
""
"Nice wheat flavors, and new mown grass smells. Lemon, white pepper, lactic acid, some orange zest and bready into the finish. Very light and refreshing on the palate but maybe a little too light. However this is only 3% ABV. A nice beer."
""
"One of the better Berliners I've had. The green apple gives a nice contrast to the normal lemon and funk. Wonderful complexity for a beer barely over 3%. Definitely glad this one will be back soon."

"Big thanks goes out to beeruser for sharing this one with me quite awhile back during a tasting at his house! Served from bottle into a Mikkeller taster flute. Poured a hazy straw slightly golden yellow with a half finger pure white head that subsided to a minimal amount slowly. Maintained nice lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, wheat, fresh cut grass, and a nice hint of sour apple. The flavor was of sweet malt, wheat, subtle funk, and a nice tart characteristic. It had a light feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this was a pretty good brew. I am personally a big fan of this style so I am quite picky when I try them. However, this one was pretty solid as far as Berliners go. All of the right components are here for a solid brew, but I just wish they were a little more intense than they were. This did make it easier for the novice to the style to drink, but as someone who appreciates the style it was a little on the weak side. Still a very solid brew that I wish I would have gotten MANY more of."
"This is a good example for the style. The sweetness and a touch of funk work really well with white meat, or on its own. I can see picking this up for a summer evening. I hope to have both again soon."
""

"Poured out as a bright yellowish color with a touch of haze to it. The smell of the beer was of wheat and what could have been lime. The beer smelled sour for the most part. The taste of the beer is light but has a pretty good amount of sour flavors in it to make you wanna pucker a little bit. The mouthfeel was light and fairly refreshing. Overall this beer was exactly what it's supposed to be in my opinion."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A good Berliner Weisse that always works when I want a light and refreshing beer. I need to pick this up more often."
""
""
""
"O- At first I hated it. In sipping more, I found it to be more and more wonderful. Strange beer. Would try again for sure."
"Light in body, easy to drink. Not quite as tart/sour as I was hoping, but that's just me. Subtle lemon tartness. Very light without being thin or watery. Well done. I would definitely have this again."
"B-"

"After extolling the virtues of this style to a customer earlier, I figured I'd try out a new B-Weiss myself. This one pours a clear pale straw topped by a short-lived couple o' fingers o' fizzy white foam. The nose comprises tart lemon zest, sour yeast (yeah, it's bacteria, but for some reason saying ""sour bacteria"" doesn't sound right in my head), and light wet wheat. The taste brings in more of the same, with the tartness really blooming right up front. This is short-lived, though, as things die away completely just after the midway point, leaving a very dry and empty tongue. The body is fairly light, with a moderate carbonation and a decidedly dry finish. Overall, a nice B-Weiss, but one that ultimately leaves me wanting in some vague sense. I can't explain it. It's still good, just not as good as it probably could be. I think."

"O: I like this one alot but just wish it was at least around 5 %. That being said this would be a nice one to drink on a hot summer day."

"M&D - puckering, wish I had some of the syrup the bottle suggests to try, definitely quality regardless, but like most sours, you have reeeaaaally like sours"

"Overall: very tasty. The best light beer I've ever had. Very complex. Very drinkable."
"Meh! Not the best Bruery beer out there."
"O - Well, this is the 4th Berliner Weiss I've tried, and probably second only to the Fritz Briem Berliner Weiss. This is a fascinating beer that comes from a fascinating style that is in need of more accessibility. Hopefully more breweries will start to brew Berliner Weissbiers. This was a solid beer for me. One I would purchase again in the future, but hopefully will find it fresh."
"O: between Berliner Weiss and Gose two hard to find styles in, mainly by different brewers yet are my favorites."
"mouthfeel/overall - lack of acid makes it pretty wet in the mouth, thin body and thin carbonation. still very drinkable and enjoyable, but not my ideal for the style."
"And you won't hear me complaining about 3.1% alcohol by volume. What a gift!"
"D/O: Effortlessly drinkable; the strong wheat component here is unexpected in such a low-gravity beer, but definitely compelling. It is a strange sour, fresh rather than woody or musty as is typical for various other styles, possibly with potential as a gateway. While remarkably clean, a word of warning is in order: do not follow other beers with this one, unless you like your sour beer to taste like stomach acid."
"Overall I would love to try a fresher version but for a rare style I think this is a good example."
"A wonderful Berliner Weiss I'd love to have in my fridge at all times."
"Poured a whiteish and hazy straw yellow, good sized white head sits atop. A heavy film of head is retained. Nose has straight lemons, wheat and a bit of funk. Uncomplicated, distinct and to the point. Taste is tart through and through, lemons with some light wheat and breadiness on the back-end. Puckering finish, and a relatively quick mouthfeel. Very light body. Very drinkable, and the best berliner I've come across in some time. Extremely quenching, and one where I would've love to have tried the blueberry and raspberry variations(maybe with some woodruff syrup too if available). Incredibly drinkable."
"A very light easy drinking beer, the mild sourness adds some nice character to the subtle wheat notes."
"Hazy pale golden colour, light white head, subtle lacing. Smell is funky, tart lemons, sour in the nose and pretty yeasty. Taste is sour, tart and lemony, yeast, citrus, lemon juice like points, very nice. High prickly carbonation you can feel all across the tongue, good feel, nice weight. Very nice stuff here, very drinkable, I think we knocked off the bottle in about 3-4 minutes, would welcome again gladly."
"Notes: Solid, mildly tart and a little funky. Glad I have a second bottle coming from DarthKostritzer so I can see a little more development."
"Wonderful drinkability if sour or tart is in your repertoire. Cloudy yellow with a big soapy head. Funky, lemony, yeast aroma. Smooth mouthfeel despite tartness, Drying finish. Hits the bullseye.Lots of flavour for very low abv, sessionable. Great by itself or with food."
"Light bodied but I think filling from the heavy carbonation. Still, wife and I will have no problem downing this 750."
"Overall, a better beer than my review likely indicates. I wouldn't want this on a cold winter day, but a fantasticly refreshing summer beer."
"Pours a clear, straw, white-wine-like color with a large white head that disappears slowly. Scent is tart lemon with some wheat and grain in the nose. Nice citrus aromas with bright, tart fruit notes. Taste is initially like a very light wheat beer that lacks in all the clove and coriander flavors (which is a good thing) and is replaced by tart lemon and citrus notes. Pleasant yeast flavors make the tart flavors more mellow than they want to be. Finishes with lovely lemon and wheat flavors. Mouthfeel is EXTREMELY light and airy...perfect for this style in beer. Drinkability is EXTREMELY high. Overall, this is an outstanding beer that represents this style to a tee. With such low ABV and such high drinkability, this beer is perfect for session drinking and hot summer days/nights."
"Ontap this beer pours a light golden straw color with a small white head. It smells of sour candy, hops, lemon and wheat. The taste is much like the nose lemon peal, wheat and a very strong tart sourness. The mouthfeel is a medium light good carbonation and good balance of smoothness with the tartness. this is one of the few berliner Weisse beers I have had and it has convinced me to explore the style deeper."
"Overall - Exemplary. Refreshing. A delightful burst of refreshment. Only gripe is I wish I had about 30 more bottles of this nectar."
"Mouthfeel and Taste - Very light bodied. Crisp and tingly carbonation matches with subtle acidity for a very refreshing flavour. Lemony, minerally and quite dry."
"A very good example of the style. Very much delicious. Nice."
"Bottle. Aroma: Lots of funk, white wine (cat piss), lemon. Weird but nice. Appearance: Milky yellow with small head. It’s far from cute but it is so unusual I kinda like it. Taste: Packed with flavors I can’t believe it. Lots of lemon, brett. This is very dry and very tart. I love it. Palate: Dry, thin Overall: This is the more drinkable and refreshing beer I’ve ever had. This 3% berliner weisse couldn’t have been better executed. If it wasn’t for the price tag and availabilty, that’d be my go to summer beer. Best surprise in a long time."
"Tart with a refreshing lemon zing. The wick of lactic sour lit in my mouth. The head of the beer is so sexy, it pours, sparkles away. You can hear the head dissipate into the air, a mystic wonder. This is an excellent version of it, alcohol content spot on, the true working class beer, in spite of the talent and patience it must take to make. Cheers to the rue in all of you!"
"Poured a light yellow and a bit fizzy. Slightly hazy. This had the best aroma of any weisse I've had; with a more fruity aroma as opposed to a lactic (spoiled milk) smell I've noticed in some other Berliners. Tart enough for the style; but certainly not mouth-puckering sour. Very light in body with a dry finish which normally would make a beer very quaffable, but the sour character actually had me sipping this beer. The very low alcohol content made this very refreshing after moving some furniture."
"Absolutely spectacular representation of the style. Certainly glad to have had the opportunity to have tried this brewing masterpiece."
"O: I'm not too used or into this vicinity of style but I actually found this enjoyable and quite drinkable. It would actually be interesting to try these with some of the recommended syrups. If lighter german styles are your thing, I have a hard time believing you won't love this."
"O: A nice brew, very refreshing. It comes off a bit mellow on the palate, but maybe that's why the style invites the addition of syrups. I was more than happy to enjoy it plain, and I got a real sense of the subtly lager/champagne fusion. Enjoyment of this brew is highly contextual. For me in a warm climate I can see this being a very enticing alternative to a great many Ales. I'd grab a bottle or two for a non-beer-drinker get together, and enjoy my craft beer without sticking out like a sore thumb. Points for refreshing, points for craft, but I'm not sure how true this is to the style. I'm very curious to try more in style now. Good beer for what it is, but if you aren't in a warm climate, this might come off a bit strange."
"O- I love a great berliner weisse, and this is one of them. I just wish it were a little more affordable"
"Overall: I've said from time to time that, although I love craft beer, I still think a light American lager is the most refreshing beer during the summer. Well, I'm eating my words big time with this one. Highly sessionable, and HIGHLY recommended! I just wish it were more readily available..."
"O - Yeah, not sure what to make of this. The first time I tried it no one could get past one sip, this is slightly better but not by much. Incredibly disheartening."
"Overall - Very drinkable and tasty in the summertime. Well brewed beer"
"Pours a murky white wine color with a 1 inch white head that fades to a film on the top of the beer. No lacing whatsoever. Smells of wheat and sour lactic notes. Taste is of mild wheat with a nice sour puckering quality. A high level of carbonation makes for a crisp and clean mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty tasting good beer but the appearance and smell are not that good. With a low ABV this is a beer you could easily drink all night."
"I've had better low abv beers. The Alchemist's Shut the Hell Up! comes to mind. Overall, I could imagine drinking a couple glasses of this outside in the heat, but the price is a turn-off. I feel like I am paying for the bottle, and that the presentation works against this particular Bruery beer. A 4/6-pack would be prefered."
"pour is as expected. Yellow. Top of the bottle is clear... Bottom is a bit of cloudiness. Not much. After brewing these i'm come across two different types of berliner... The low FG dry... This dryness working as the backbone of the palate and the thicker wheat core with a sour twist. This is the first. Quite filtered lack of carbonation. Easy drinking. Weak protein formation. Nose of lemon grass and yogart. Zesty. Palate is lacto... Also salty. The perfect bbq beer. When without fruit syrup i can see it cutting sweetness wonderfully. Palate of yogart hints and minimal wheat. Intense tart dryness but not offensive. A quick finish. A bit of lemon pulp and teeth grinding. A novelity of sort but sours are in so it works. In the end a tad heavy for the aby but good to see people are making a style i like. Can't wait to have mine."
"Flavor has a bit of grape sweetness as well, before the wave of dry tart crabapple crispness blasts the palate. Very dry and effervescent, clean and simple. Aftertaste of grain and a hint of clean wild yeast. Very quenching. Easily sipped or gulped, pairs well with food or as an apertif to whet the appetite. If you know someone who likes dry champagne, offer them this. It's no coincidence this is known as the ""champagne of the north""."
"Like a previous review, not sure the bottle was quite worth the $8-$10 price tag."
"Lighter body, higher carbonation, tingly and refreshing on the senses. I could probably take down an entire bottle of this without much effort, and I really enjoyed the balance of sweet and tart at the same time. Add in that this is 3.1% and you've got a winner, especially if you like Berliner Weiss."
"Bruery Hottenroth is probably the palest beer I've ever had--probably 1 SRM, if that. It's lighter in color than lemonade, and the first pour is almost crystal clear, whereas the second is hazier. The beer foams up with a thick white head that quickly fizzes out. The beer smells a little funky sour, not entirely like an American wild, but like spoiled milk and a little lemony. It also smells a bit doughy. The beer is tart upfront with good round mouthfeel and light carbonation. The finish is very dry and sour. This is not a very complex beer, pretty bland sour with a little lemony bite and a clean aftertaste."
"One of the better versions of this somewhat elusive style. For me, most are simply not tart or lactic enough. This one hits the nail on the head. Pours a hazy pale straw color, with an almost greenish cast. Finely beaded pure white head. Smells soft and slightly grainy, with an almost barnyard note as well. Some lactic tartness, particularly at the end. The taste is much more lactic and tart than the aroma would suggest. Nice lemony sourness, almost cutting at first, and then turning more into a lemon peel bitterness with some lemon juiciness hanging in there. A touch of lactic tanginess, not quite creamy, makes a brief appearance. Really nice beer."
"O: Berliner Weisse beers put drinkability above all else and Hottenroth is no exception. I love its big flavor and low abv  Perfect for a hot summer evening. "
"O- This is a very tart and sour beer, mouth puckering sour and delicious. I really enjoyed this and look forward to trying more sours. I can see me getting beer quite a few more times. The dryness, acidity, and some of the taste remind me very much of white wine."
"T: Very light, but has a great taste. Lemon, tart green apple, vinegar, and a touch of baby aspirin. Tart but not exactly sour. Like it restrains itself before it gets so sour that it makes you pucker up. A great take on the style and the perfect summer beer."
"The only thing I complain is the price - my bottle says 13,50$ - (which is ~ 9,20€). In my eyes far too expensive for such a beer. It's a good beer - but here in Europe you won't even sell it for half of it!"
"O - Quite nice Berliner Weissbier. I can see how its highly rated. Easy drinking. Good flavors and some nice tartness."
"Overall - Don't look for this one to blow you away with appearance, smell or taste, but it is fantastic to the style. Perfect thing for a hot day especially with the 3.1% ABV, you can drink these all day if you can afford it. Will definitely buy some more and share them with the non craft crowd, see if I can sway a few."
"Overall: My first of this style, this is exceptionally like the BA description. A fantastic beer, I'll enjoy this often over this summer. Absolutely fantastic."
"D - not bad for a summer sipper"
"Pours a pale clear yellow/silver with a lively head that leaves quickly without a trace, looks like champagne and the carbonation is right on par with that too. The nose is subtle with a slightly sour vinous quality, along with cherry and a touch of earth along with a funky minerality. The taste is spot on champagne, dry, nice acidity, chalky with a slight sourness and almost a french ""terrior"" of minerals and earth. Very good to drink just not a fan if its considered a beer as it could trick most into being champagne and though i like it, to style its just not there"
"this is a wheat beer, so someone correct me if i'm wrong, but i don't worry about the sediment in this one as much. pours a slightly hazy, glowing white-gold with a white head that fades pretty quickly and manages to leave little bits of lace. lots of lemon on the nose, as well as a good deal of (almost salty) minerality, some hay/wheat, a touch of funk and fruit (pear skin?). taste is just barely tart. lemon rind hits right away, but everything is extremely well-balanced and works together fantastically well. soft, light and zippy mouthfeel. very clean with no aftertaste. overall, a well-done refresher that makes for great summertime schwill. always happy when this comes out. god bless bruery!"
"I'm newly infatuated with this style and this is my favorite so far. Really very refreshing and light and quaffable. My favorite from the Bruery's regular lineup. I'll be sipping these all summer."
"O: nice beer on a warm sunny day. Easy to sip, quite sessionable were it not a bit on the pricy side."
"I like this on its own and I don't find it necessary to add flavored syrup. It is a perfect choice when you want a low alcohol yet very refreshing beer."
"D - excellent! This is my favorite berliner weisse. The nose is a little off, but overall a great example of the style."
"O – After reviewing half a bottle with a few friends, we poured a second round to try it Berliner-style with flavored syrup. The best was a jerry-rigged apricot syrup made from apricot jam, brown sugar, and enough water to re-dissolve the pectin and thin it out. The juicy and lightly tart apricot flavor paired exceptionally well with the bright lemon-citrus of the beer."
"D- pretty good berliner, nice tart character mixed with the citrus, I wish the nose would have been a littler more interesting, solid nonetheless"
"D-its definitely an easy drinker, but the taste isn't exactly something i want a whole lot of.the corn flavor isn't very desirable to me."
"Overall: There's not a great deal to be said since it, as a style, is not that complicated. I do like that there is the Brett funk that's thrown in to give it a bit more complexity than it might otherwise have. It's pretty refreshing, has to be nice on a hot summer day."
"(D)- In terms of style, this is really great! It has a ridiculous drinkability due to the mellow ABV and smooth mouthfeel. All the while having a great sour bite to fulfill any sour head's desire at least temporarily. This bottle did not last long. I would not mind getting a case of this for the summertime; Super refreshing."
"D-Didn't really do it for me.. Might just be how this style is. But this mostly tasted like water with lemon juice squeezed into it. Easy to drink but not really much flavor or a very desireable flavor at that. will try others of the same style but prob. wont get this one again"
"Drinkability is fantastic! Could have had a few of these, but wanted to save my money/alcohol intake for PtY."
"Hottenroth is one of The Bruery's better efforts and is almost as good as the best Berliner weissbiers to have ever entered my glass (Professor Fritz Briem 1809 and DFH Festina Peche). Bottom line: traditional Berliner weiss with a wild ale twist that works."
"Definitely Belgian-esque. Very interesting for it's style."
"The beer pours a clear golden yellow color with a finger of snow white foam. Smells of sweet esters and lemon rind. The taste is lemon zest, sweet esters and chardonnay. Very nice. The beer is light bodied with a high level of carbonation. I'm really enjoying this one. It's very refreshing and the white wine characteristics that I'm getting lend a complexity to the beer that is very enjoyable. This would be a great beer to have on a hot summer day. it's great on a cold, rainy winter one today! I'll be seeking this out in the future."
"D: pretty decent berliner weiss brew that was drinking good with a good amount of tart character."
"The CPJ"
"Tart, sour, snappy, crisp. This would be a great summertime brew, especially coming in at 3.1%."
"This beer is light in feel, there is a rather low ABV but has a well craft flavor profile that also makes for a very drinkable beer that goes down easy with little effort or afterthought."
"D- I think I am going to down the entire 750 by myself. This is one fantastic brew and will get it again for sure"
"D: extremely drinkable, its light and enjoyable. its kind of a mixed bag overall for me, but all in all im glad i tried it."
"Bottle: Poured a clear light bright golden color ale with a large pure white head with good retention and very good lacing. Aroma of sour and tart notes are very well balanced with solid malt notes. Taste is dominated by tart notes thought not overwhelming with great notes of malt and no acidity notes. Body is full for style with good carbonation. Very refreshing with great drinkability factor. Probably one of the bets beer I tasted from this brewery with great balance and refreshing factor."
"EDIT2: Had a growler of it on Memorial Day while 4wheeling and cave spelunking. Just awesome. This beer keeps rising."
"D: An outstanding example of one of the most fascinating styles of brew. I highly recommend this to any fan of sour brews, as it is quite delicious."
"Drink- I finished the bottle. If all sours are like this, then I don't think they are for me."
"Drinkable, but I didn't order a second..."
"Berliner Weisse production notes: Mashed hops (into grain, hops not boiled) will impede the pedicocci and lactobacillus which imparts flavors to this sour wheat beer (50% wheat). Popular in the 19th century, Napoleon liked it. Germans cut it with syrup, raspberry."
"Overall - One would expect any 3.1% abv beer to be easy to drink, but this beer combines the crisp sharpness of the carbonation and the sour tartness to provide great drinkability regardless of abv."
"The taste is lightly tart with a nice wheat base. Some lighter stone fruits and green apple come through with a bit of sourness. Light mouthfeel with very nice sourness levels and a good overall carbonation base. Drinks incredibly well either plain or with the woodruff."
"D: At just above 3%, this is about as sessionable as they get. Great taste and really thirst-quenching. I feel like I could never get enough of this. Solid representation of a great style."
"Do beers get any easier to drink than this? I think not! Another top score it is! 5/5"
"This is my first beer from the Bruery and I'd been wanting to try it for awhile, despite the low abv. It poured a very carbonated and crisp pale, pale straw yellow in color with a great deal of white, quickly dissipating foam. It looks like pear juice or watered down apple juice and is very light in color. The only thing I can really smell is the sourness and tartness of a good Berliner Weiss. The taste is excellent. It reminds me of a sour, light apple or pear cider. The mouthfeel is very light and very, very crisp due to good carbonation. I find this to be insanely drinkable, probably because it's only 3.1%. The only drawback is the price of 9.99 for a low abv beer but otherwise it's definitely worth trying."
"Overall a very light bodied brew with a moderately high level of carbonation that fits the style. Overall it wasn't bad but I think there are a few others out there which are a bit better value for the money."
"CHEERS!"
"4.0 D: Overall pretty mediocre, but the mouthfeel is great and brings up the drinkability quite a bit."
"If at all possible, this must be enjoyed on tap at The Bruery. I think it can also be found at Stone on tap."
"I like sours and I still didn't like this one. Maybe I had a bad bottle or it is a little too intense for me."
"Picked up a bottle on my way back from the beach over the weekend... cracked it open before dinner tonight. Poured a pale, hazy straw, with a one and a half finger, ultra white head that fizzed down pretty quick, leaving no lace. Smells of light grains / wheat, with some tart lemon zest. Taste is nice and wheaty, with some nice lactic tartness, again lemon and sour finish. Mouthfeel is light and crisp - nice carbonation level with a nice, tart zing on the finish. Very drinkable - very refreshing on a hot summer afternoon."
"D - This is a good brew but simple too tart to get a really high drinkablity score."
"Saying that Berliner Weisses are drinkable is obvious, but this one is particularly downable and it's fun to take the ride from sour bite to wheaty coat. I also love the low ABV, which will allow for a full day of sober sipping."
"Bottle. Pours a cloudy yellow grapefruit like color with a tiny bubble white head. The arome is funk, wheat, with a slight touch of citric notes. Also reminds me slightly of a belgian. The first sip is tart and sour that transitions to a wheat beer aftertaste. Not overly sour by any means. Slightly acidic. At only 3.1%, you don't pick up the alcohol notes at all. Very light mouthfeel. Dry finish. Great summer time low abv beer. Interested to see how this will be with a year down in the cellar."
"Here is a beer that I think people have a hard time rating without the proper exposure to the style. Having tried about 7 different Berliner Weisse brews from commercial breweries, and many many homebrew attempts, I think this beer is the perfect example of the style. The smell is clean with a touch of wheat/grain, yet you still get that touch of lacto vinegar and citrus. The flavor is well rounded and features citric acid and light grains. It is the perfect level of sour, and the carbonation is spot on. I love this beer and could drink it all day. The only part that isn't perfect is the head, which didn't seem to last long. But who cares about that with a stellar berliner like this."
"All in all, this is probably the single most refreshing beer I've ever consumed. My first of the style so I don't have much of a baseline for rating, but it's hard to imagine a Berliner Weiss that can be much better than Hottenroth."
"Being light, nice and tart, not heavy at all, not really sweet, some nice toasty malts and wheat, nice raspberry, and the nice toasty barnyard funk (not Brett funk, a special Belgian yeast)."
"great mouth feel and drink ability extremely refreshing easy to drink and just a flat out tasty beer. Wish I still lived close enough for growler fills."
"Light body. Spritzy carbonation. Is there really alcohol in here? Very refreshing, with a bit of complexity. Very well made."
"This is the first time I've spent $8 on a 3.1% beer... ABV does NOT always equal flavor. Berliner Weisse is a style that will really make one reconsider lower ABV brews, especially when you're tired of big, sweet flavor bombs."
"The Hottenroth pours a hazy golden color with a nice fizzy 2 finger head and minimal retention. Very brilliant looking pour. Nose is very citrusy and some bananas. Wheat is noticeable as well as some funk. Taste is sour from lemony tastes. Also yeast is pronounced on the mouth. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and very well carbonated. This is a pretty drinkable brew. I am digging this style."
"D - This is an awesome beer with a damn good sour taste at a super sessionable abv making it easy to drink the 750 on your own worth hunting down to try sometime"
"Poured a lovely light straw yellow, slightly hazy as it's supposed to be, with a 1"" white short lived head. Very nicely tart and citrusy in the aroma. Hint of biscuit and a pronounced wheat twang. Flavor is a touch more complex than expected. Lemony tart, touch of yeast, puckering finish with a layer of ""barnyard"" funk, but this is almost hidden. Crisp and light, this beer is best served chilled (slightly above refrigeration temperature) in a flute or a weizen glass. Outstanding beer. Perfect for Florida weather."
"You better enjoy sour tart things before you tackle this bottle, because its a large one. I will be sharing the rest with my wife who always enjoys when I break out a sour beer. Overall I really enjoyed this beer and even better it was just perfect for this hot day. I will chalk up another win for the Bruery and their beers, they always seem to impress me. Since this is a rarely made st lye of beer i would definitely say you should give it a try if you come across it just for the experience. It was sour, tart, winy, and refreshing and should not be overseen when you go looking for a great summer beer."
"D: Definitely hits the spot on a hot summer day. Don't be a sissy and drink it with syrup, though."
"Poured with a fine, white head and no lace. Color is a clear, very pale yellow. Aroma is tart and a bit of funky, barnyard. Flavor is tart forward with hints of berries and lemon, plus some grass. Body is a little more soft than a couple of the German versions I've had & carbonation is good. Finish is good, fairly clean and on the short side. With woodruff syrup - very good too!"
"D: This was a very tart beer, but not in the same way as a wild ale or lambic. It was interesting to try, and I could certainly understand why it's traditionally drunk with fruit syrup added. Recommended only for experimentation purposes, or if you're a huge fan of this unique style (as it seems to be a good representation)."
"Drinkability: Though I am a little disappointed in the fading carbonation (keep the pours small to preserve the bubbles), this is a refreshingly tart summertime drink"
"Got a bottle of this as a gift from a friend and just opened it today. Very light straw color and very cloudy. Very light head, in color and amount. Flavor is typical for a berlinerweiss, good sourness with a slight bready character. Aroma is very good, a little fruity. I love everything I've had from this brewery."
"Drinkability? Man, this is an excellent summertime brew that really really is refreshing. The Bruery....I THANK you and Ding!"
"I'm a fan of berliner weisse beers, just not this one. I was really hoping it was just me. This beer just seems to be lacking in content to me."
"D - Very tart and refreshing, perfect on a hot day. I threw back a couple of these one day while painting my kitchen, definitely helped make it bearable. This is a really nice example of a fairly uncommon beer style that I love to introduce non-beer drinkers to."
"Berliner weisse is probably one of those love-it-or-hate-it styles. I'm a big fan, and don't see many examples of the style in my neck of the woods. Thanks to Blake for the bottle. Exceptionally well balanced lemony tartness - enough to be pleasantly tangy but not mouth-puckeringly sour like some. Lemon and clean grain notes. Great hot weather quencher and, as per the style, low abv."
"I could drink this all day. Hard to imagine a more drinkable beer. Very well done. I'm going to have to find some woodruff syrup the next time I try this style."
"D = This is a great hot weather beer, easy to pound away while sitting on the deck. Great stuff."
"D: If you like sourness, the beer is very easy to drink, although you could add some fruit syrup to make it a little more palate. The beer is very light and refreshing."
"Overall this beer was an excellent departure from what I usually drink and I found it to be a great beer. Recommended."
"Drinkability: Very good for the style and my favorite from the Bruery. I could sip on this all day. Not a starter sour, but more of a medium one. Wish I could find this more easily."
"D. I wouldn't drink these all the time, but this was just what I was looking for today: tart, refreshing, and cool on a hot summer afternoon."
"I must admit, these would not be very sessionable for me due to its sour nature, but still a good beer nonetheless."
"The finish is nice and dry. Drank the glass before I even realized it."
"Drinkability -- So many people in the craft beer community rail against beers they call ""fizzy yellow water."" This is fizzy, yellow, and about as close to the feel of water as you're likely to find in a beer, and it's great. Delicious, refreshing and very unique. It was worth the effort it took me to track it down."
"D- Super quaffable. Super refreshing. Drink it straight on a hot summer day. I would definitely covet a 750ml bottle for myself in a sitting!"
"It's a very refreshing and easy-to-drink beer. Sour fans, seeks this one out."
"D-big flavors and very light body. easy session beer but the tartness makes me not want to keep drinking it."
"D: A drinkable, if somewhat odd, beer."
"D: Like most Berliner weissbiers, Hottenroth is low in alcohol and long on tartness, at least for a spell."
"Straw yellow hazy body, big finger rocky white head, slow dissipation, decent lacing, a nice looking beer. Nose is dry, lemony, grapefruit, not much hops. Taste is lemony wheat with dry finish, quite tart. Medium mouthfeel with a lip smacking finish. A great summer quaffer, very sessionable."
"Otherwise, a fine offering for a style we see rarely here in the US."
"D: Really drinkable as far as ABV goes but turns into a sipper due to sweet and tartness of it. Enjoyed on a sunny day and seems nice for such a setting."
"Probably one of the most refreshing beers I have had. At roughly 3%, I could drink a few of these. I would love to have a growler of this on a hot summer day or on the golf course. Amazing brew for sure!"
"Simply a must try!"
"update: starting to love this style and this beer. re rate"
"I will note that I was drinking out of my tulip while my girlfriend was drinking out of a regular glass and the difference was noteworthy. The appearance and taste were noticable"
"The taste has a bracing sourness up front when it's cold, but subsides and smoothes out as it warms. It's crisp and lemony, not very complex, but it doesn't need to be. This is an after work, hot day, slammer. And it does a great job of that."
"The body is very light with such a high carbonation which makes this the ultimate summer refreshment. I don't have a huge familiarity with this style but this one hits all the notes for me."
"D - A solid Berliner Weissebier, but a slightly muted and subdued version... Doesn't pack the flavor or potency that I was expected... Easy drinking and still highly enjoyable, but nothing to memorable..."
"Not super complex, kind of relies on 2 notes, but interesting nonetheless. Good but challenging, one's enough for an evening."
"drinkability is great. light, well balanced, and super drinkable. a great refreshing summer brew."
"Mouthfeel is light bodied with medium to high carbonation. Very refreshing, I need to do one of these for home. Great Berliner. Thanks Mike!"
"Sharply tart and crisp in the mouth, without a lot of unpleasant souring character, this was a rather good take on a Berlinerwiess. I believe that I actually enjoyed this a bit more in the bottle than I did on tap."
"Mouthfeel was light bodied. Crisp, with tiny carbonation. Nice. I think this is my first Berliner Weiss."
"Overall I am really glad I got to try this. It has encouraged me to seek out other similar beers. I feel like this would be an excellent warm weather beer and would pair up wonderfully with light salads, fruit, and grilled chicken and seafood."
"This beer is sour, but it lacks the intense sourness that would slow you down if you were drinking a wild ale. Combine that with a balancing wheat flavor and a very low ABV%, and the Bruery has put together a very drinkable and refreshing beer."
"D- This is a great berliner. Its tart but it has a good yeastiness to back it up. The body is good-but a hair thin-which is to be expected in a brew that is 3.1% ABV. Well done overall by the bruery."
"Excellent."
"Huge thanks to viggo for bringing this to the epic Bruery tasting. Perhaps my most anticipated beer, and it wasn't a let-down."
"D - Great drinkability this a beer that is not overpowering but has great very subtle flavor. It seems like a great spring/summer beer to sip on, on a nice evening. It has a nice amount of sour but is not overwhelming. I could drink a lot of this in a night which I think it great."
"Super drinkable, I wish more people were making this style."
"The top part of the bottle poured a clear, light straw colour with a short-lived, fizzy, white cap. Smells a bit sour, wet hay, faint tart berries, fruity as it warms. Light and tart in flavour, quite fruity throughout. Not overly acidic, nicely balanced with a bit of sweetness up front. A bit earthy with some straw and grass notes. Light bodied with a smooth texture and enough heft to keep from feeling thin. Carbonation was moderate. Pretty nice overall and easier drinking than some other beers in the style due to the balanced acidity."
"Decently done I guess but not for me. Little too thin and a little too sour. Well done though."
"one day, when i have this again, i'll surely introduce syrups into the beverage. next time, i will be prepared. as it is, i could drink it everyday of the summer even in alaska."
"It's a Berliner Weissbier and only 3.10%. It poured a bright yellow. It smelled a bit funky, Brett, not too tart but with a bit of lemon. It tasted like sour lemons, green apples then turns to yeast. It is very light and I learned from some fabulous East Bayers that it is meant to be drunk with sweeten syrups, which I would love to try sometime."
"The mouthfeel is light and carbonation is moderate. it could have used a little more carbonation for the style. Drinkability is good, it's a very nice easy drinking beer for a warm day. I've only had a few beers of this style but so far I've really enjoyed the ones I've had and look forward to drinking this more often during the summer."
"this is beyond drinkable. the ABV is silly low, the flavors are just enough to keep interest, and its very refreshing. i really wish i had bought like 5 of these now."
"Pours a hazy, very light straw, with creamy two finger head that fades quickly, leaving lace for a half inch or so. Smell: spicy rye and a slight sour funk, along with some cornbread. Taste: big time lemon, tart, with a little sour lemon candy thrown in there too. Something a bit undercooked yeasty dough-like about the finish. It's refreshing and sour/tart which is nice, but the 750 is certainly enough..."
"Drinkability: I have to say that this beer is perhaps one of the most drinkable beers I have ever come across. It's light, crisp, has an enjoyable bit of tartness to it, all with a very sessionable 3.1% ABV. I could easily see myself enjoying a couple of bottles of this in an evening. I highly recommend trying this beer if you get the chance."
"Drinkability: This is the third drainpour I have had out of over 900 different beers sampled. It was just very sour, with no other characteristics that would give it at least some personality. The two friends I shared it with totally agreed."
"This is quite to style (which calls for clean with a solid tartness); the promise of Brettanomyces on the label has me wishing for more funkiness as this is on the low side, but it does have a nice gripping sourness and it is quite clean and light. This is most definitely refreshing and a testament to the style. I could wish for more funk and complexity here, despite the fact that the style doesn't call for it. In the end this is still a really, really nice beer. I wonder if the Brettanomyces will contribute more character over time; there is only one way to tell, and I have a couple bottles to lay down and try the process out."
"D= Awesome. At 3.1% it doesn't get much better for a session. Great beer for a summer afternoon for sure I'm happy I bought more on a whim when I was in Wisconsin. Awesome drinkability."
"The carbonation was a little light for the style, which is supposed to be highly carbonated around 4 volumes. This felt more like 2.5, similar to an American pale to me."
"Good light-hearted drink, relaxing."
"Mouthfeel is pretty thin, but very drinkable for the style."
"Pours golden, yellow with a nice white head. The head fades quickly, this brew is lightly carbonated. Pleasing sour aroma, with a little bit of funk. Complex, tart taste with massive lemon highlights. The beer is very smooth and goes down easily. Due to acidic nature of this beer, the drinkability is average, one or two glasses will do. When all is said and done this is a good brew."
"D - I'm glad beers like this are available. The Bruery deserves credit for taking a shot at this rare style. Great beer for warm weather, and also for sour-lovers who want something sour, but not quite at the same level as a lambic."
"Drinkability: Low abv and ok mouthfeel, but flavor profile doesn't make me want more."
"With a very good taste and low ABV, this one is quite drinkable."
"M + D: Crisp and refreshing, with a snappy carbonation and that wonderful dryness that I always appreciate in sour brews. Drinkability is rather subjective, I suppose. It's light enough in alcohol to go down very easily, but tart enough that it's not really appropriate to 'guzzle.' All that aside, it's a very fine brew, albeit perhaps something of a 'mood drink.' Nicely done!"
"Mouthfeel is light and airy with a crisp amount of carbonation."
"Had this on tap in August 2009 at Bailey's Taproom in Portland, Oregon. The colour was a very light straw with thin head. The aroma was redolent of tangy citrus and yeast. On the palate...WOW! Quite sour! More so than I expected for a Berliner weisse. Tangy and citrusy with a very refreshing quick finish."
"D - High, especially given the low ABV. The more I get into this style, the more I enjoy it!"
"D - This is damn tasty and would make a great summer quencher and nice lawn mower beer. Would have never guessed it was 3.1%."
"D- Overall, I'm not a huge fan of this style overall. However, I can appreciate that this is a good representation of the style. Worth a try."
"This beer is an easy drinking one at such a low ABV. Sours of this manner really just arent my favorite."
"Pours the palest yellow I've ever seen in a beer, with a large white fluffy head that left little lacing. A lot of raw wheat in the aroma, grainy, husky, light sourness. Taste is more sour than the aroma lets on, light funk in there, grassy, lemony, with a lovely wheaty twang and a dry finish. Crisp body, easy to drink. Never becomes too sour. Really not digging the raw wheat aroma when I take a sip, as I it takes away from the good flavor, I try to hold me breath. Wish I had some raspberry syrup to pour in this thing. Not bad, but there's still no Berlinerweiss that can hold a candle to NG's Unplugged version."
"Drinkability: very drinkable indeed. I love tart/sour beers; they pique the tongue's interest enough that when the flavor fades, you just want more."
"D: This is my first example of this style, somewhat thin and tart. I personally would have liked a fuller body to this beer, but certainly one to enjoy a few pints of."
"This is an interesting beer from The Bruery. It is very light and refreshing and basically tastes like lemonade. This is the perfect beer for a warm day like today or on a hot summer afternoon."
"Whoa this is sour. And has an aftertaste of wheat. That's unfortunate. The sour flavors are fine but the cereal rears up late in the beer and kind of ruins the good tartness in the corners of my mouth. No sweetness, no real bitterness to it. Drinkability is OK mouthfeel is OK. Overall, I don't really care for it though."
"D - I love sour beers but I'm new to the Berliner Weiss. While I prefer Belgian sours more, this was very flavorful and enjoyable."
"""mit schuss"" raspberry syrup, becomes sweet and sour, and not as dry of a finish."
"Poured a pale gold color with good carbonation. Nose is funk and spice. Taste is grass, spice, funk and hardly any booze at all. So much flavor and so little alcohol, nice. A little tartness, fruits but mainly citrus. A very good, low ABV brew with good taste. Well done."
"Overall - A very nice sour; I prefer more complex, intensely sour beers, but the maltly character of this beer is quite good. I will definitely pick this up again."
"D- Pretty easy to drink and at 3% alcohol it is a definate session beer and a replacement to any light beer out on the market. You can mix this with different flavored syrups and make it taste even better also, just very easy drinking."
"Palate is fairly light, dry, and refreshing. Drinkability is exceptionally high. Awesome for the style and really good overall. Well done again, Patrick!"
"This is only my second berliner weiss, but very well done. More malty and less tart than a traditional German berliner weisse, still a great interpretation. I loved how the alcohol is only 3.1%, yet the mouthfeel doesn't feel thin at all. I could drink a lot of this."
"Drinkability is high. Jm aboutto drink the whole 750 myself. I could drink sever pints at a bar."
"D - wasnt sure how to grade this as its the first of the style i've had. quote unique but just missing something, can understand why its historically flavored with syrups. would love to try it the traditional way."
"D: All day long. Super easy drinking. Just wish it was a little bit more tart."
"Mouthfeel is light with carbonation kept at a reasonable level. Overall this beer is very good, and for the style is even better. A weak aftertaste and bit of wateriness are the only things keeping it from an A rating for me."
"We bought and sampled several beers that night and used this one as a palate cleanser between IPAs... I recommend that you pick some of these up for your next IPA party."
"The beer by itself is not bad, but it is a bit boring. I don't have any woodruff, but I found some raspberry syrup and decided to give it a try with the second half of the bottle. The syrup adds a nice dimension of fruit to the aroma that works well with the sourness that was already there. The syrup seems to boost the acidity in the flavor while also adding a bit to the body of the beer. I only added a little bit of the syrup so that it wouldn't sweeten the beer too much and it does nothing to mask the nutty wild yeast character. I would definitely recommend tasting the beer straight, but I found it more drinkable with the added complexity of the fruit."
"D - Drinkability is good. The low alcohol and abundance of flavors make this a very interesting choice. I can see this beer being very good in warmer weather along with also being a nice compliment to a hearty winter's meal. This is one of a few times that I can easily agree with the 750 ml bottle size. Even at that size, the bottle disappears quickly. I think I'll be hunting down more examples of the style based on this brew. Another good beer from the folks at the Bruery."
"The mouthfeel is light and effervescent with a ton of carbonation, maybe a tad overdone, but that's par for the course with Bruery's year-round offerings I've had. This one is not extremely complex, but it is unbelievably drinkable."
"Reviewed on 1/1/2010. Bottle. Pours a clear light yellow with a small white head. Aroma of light sweettart candies, slight funk, light fruits. Flavor is initially sweet and tart with a bready, wheaty finish. Pleasant and easy drinking, although not as flavorful as I would have liked."
"Mouthfeel was good. Crisp. Drinkability is exceptional. It's so pleasant and refreshing, it goes down effortlessly."
"Pours yellow straw color with a white head. The aroma is very tart with some citrus. The flavor is sour wheat, lemon, other citrus and some spices. Very drinkable and a light bodied beer. For 3.1 percent, this beer has a ton of flavor."
"I found this to be very drinkable albeit tart."
"Poured into a Berliner Kindl Weisse pokal, formed a 1/4"" bright white head over the cloudy golden brew. Head is promptly down to an uneven skim, with slow-falling lace. Aroma is earthy citric tartness. Taste starts lightly tart, then comes full on lemon in the middle, and then ends dry and clean on the tongue. Mouthfeel is so smooth for such a sour brew, and drinkability is great."
"I have to admit that I'm very surprised with this one. I had this on tap at a Bruery event and was not impressed at all. After sampling this bottle I have to say that Hottenroth is probably the best example of the style I've had yet."
"I was recommended this from my local retailer, and I am a fan of sour, acidic/tart beers including this style. It could use a splash of woodruff or raspberry syrup as tradition dictates. Decent beer, it's nice to see someone attempting this style at all in the U.S."
"Good atmosphere. Appearance is not extravagant, but very nice. Nose is powerful, but not off-putting. Flavor is very tart, but not sweet... very interesting. Overall, this is a really good quaff."
"Drinkability: Immensely refreshing, made all the moreso with its mere hint of alcohol at 3.8%. It's good to see somebody over here trying to keep this style alive. This would serve as a fine Summertime beverage, but did just fine as a kick start to a local Christmas gathering."
"Drinkability is quality in limited quantities I love sour ales, my limited runs with Berliner Weisse thus far has been a great experience, time to try some German versions. I've only had Nodding Head and DFH versions. At 8.99 it's a bit much for a session ale, but the complexity and experience made it worth it for a one time visit. I'd have see this one more readily to try it again anytime soon. Next stop I have to try the Saison Rue or Orchard White. So far in Ohio there's only like 4 or 5 at the most varieties of the Bruery's wares around."
"Overall, a decently drinkable enjoyable beer but not tart enough to be an awesome berliner."
"A style we don't get to drink often, so thanks to The Bruery for giving it a shot. This brew pours a very pale yellow, cloudy and even lighter than a Lite beer; the head is frothy and white but goes away quickly. Aroma is lemony and herbal with a slight funk. Taste is the same, lots of lemon pepper and with a nice sour kick that brings this brew together. Still a little thin, but I think that's the point of this brew, might want to hit 1809 for a slightly more robust version. All in all, very tasty, hopefully I can grab a couple bottle come summer."
"D: pretty decent. You would never guess this beer to be only 3.1%abv in nature, which had a huge offering of flavor and sourness making this a decent summer time quencher. A bomber suffices here due to its fairly strong acidity and sour nature. Enjoyable and recommendable."
"D - At only 3.1%, as light as you'd expect. quite refreshing"
"overall a solid representation of a style that i would like to see more of..."
"Not a whole lot going on with this one. Admittedly, not my favorite style."
"Overall, an excellent beer. I could see myself putting back gallons of this on a hot day."
"Clear light golden pour with a thick but short lived white head. Smell is an odd mix of fresh corn, lemon zest, fresh baked bread, and a slight touch of funk. Taste is exactly what I was hoping for based on the only 2 other beers of this style that I have tried - 1809 and Festina Peche. Tartness and acidity is very mild, and does not linger. Very refreshing. Mouthfeel is smooth and light. Drinkability is out of the park. I could drink this all night, and with the low abv, it would be perfect for just that. At 9.00 a bottle though, it would make for a long and expensive night."
"M/D - Very light in body and quite sessionable. Could have been a bit more adventurous in the sour/funk department but a good Berliner for the uninitiated."
"Very very light on the palate, with a pleasant but fairly non descript taste. It is tart, and acidic, with fruity notes, but all a bit too light. Perhaps on a very hot day it would taste better. It is certainly not bad, but not really good either. New Glarus makes a significantly better version."
"Everything just fell away once I took a sip; this beer ends up thin, bare and empty. Maybe this is a Berliner Weisse which really requires syrup to give it any character (or rather, to cover the weak, but unpleasant characters it has). It was promising on the nose, and it looked the part, but it couldn't hold its end up when it counted. A shame."
"Great session beer, perfect for many thirst-quenching occasions. Nice to see a brewer take this under appreciated style and hit the nail on the head."
"Mouthfeel was nice. Carbonation appropriate. Not terribly drinkable- it could be a lot better for its ABV, but this one is surprisingly funky and too much so to be able to gulp down."
"750 ml bottle. Served in a chalice, the beer pours a slightly hazy straw gold color with about a half inch white head. It smells like wheat, bread/dough, lemon and also a bit of an herbal aroma I can't identify. The aroma isn't tart at all. However, that all changes in the taste. Tart lemon and apple flavors show up first, and there's also some wheat/grain and herbs noticable in the taste. Also has a nice lingering tart finish. Mouthfeel/body is light and thin, and it has moderate carbonation. Drinkability is excellent, it's crisp, refreshing, smooth and extremely easy to drink. With the ABV being just 3.1%, going through a bottle of this is pretty easy. This would really be a great summer beer. This is the first Bruery beer I've tried, and it certainly won't be the last."
"I would love to have a taste of what a chef could build around this beer!"
"Drinkability: Very light in the stomach, low low low ABV and not overly sour. Not problem killing the whole bottle, barely felt it. Flavors could be a little more pronounced, but overall pretty good. Liked it better than the 1809 Berliner Weiss."
"Overall, this is a decent berliner wiesse. A few adjustments could make it much better, but as it sits it is good to see this style emerging more on the US made front. An ok representation of the style, and one i would maybe buy again. A nice beer."
"drinkability: fine"
"Served in my New Belgium Globe glass. Poured a translucent pale yellow with copious tiny bubbles effervescing in solution. Pour generated a half inch, loose and frothy bright white head that quickly dispersed into a bubbly skim that coalesced around the edges. A strong doughy aroma was revealed off the cap pop with a lemony quality that follows. Taste consistent with nose with the breadiness lightly lingering at the finish. Mouthfeel is light in body, with a pleasant background carbonation and a dry finish. Pleasantly refreshing and enjoyable. Doesn't beat an 1809, but still very good."
"Drinkability - Commendable drinkability! This should be the archetype session beer for any occasion, although one might find it most refreshing during the warmer months. The diminutive volume of alcohol levitates the drinkability, too! I could see Hottenroth as a portal into the craft radius."
"A refreshing sour beverage, which would serve as a nice base for a good quality flavored syrup (e.g. Monin) - a fairly successful example of a neglected style."
"Very drinkable - a nice, tart, brew. Something a bit ""different", but still within style... A solid brew to pair with fish or chicken."
"D-Good flavour, low ABV and a pleasant crispness. This isn't the best BW I have had, flavours are a bit light, I like a bit more zing/ bite in mine...but this would do if preferred brew were not available. Nice to see a domestic bottled BW though!"
"Draught at The Bruery's anniversary. Lightly hazy pale straw with a white head. Funky, tart, wheaty aroma with some apple. The flavor is mostly crisp lemony tartness with some wheat grain, a light acetic touch and tart pear and apple. Not intensely acidic, but I do have a high threshold for sour. Light bodied with crisp, ample carbonation. Great light and refreshing beer."
"Drinkability: Off the charts. I can't wait to go to have this over the summer."
"By the way, in my opinion this is one where the ""bottle"" is better than the ""draft."" Draft is less assertive, less extreme, ""less"" all around. Draft is still nice but go for the bottle on this one."
"A capped 750ml bottle purchased at Abe's cold beer in Bethlehem for $8. Opened and poured into my 1809 goblet (you can pound nails into concrete with this glass). Appears a cloudy pale straw yellow color with about an inch of fizzy, quickly fading bone white foam. Nose and flavor consist of tart lemon juice, lightly toasted wheat, tart green apples, sparkling mineral water, the sourness is never overbearing. The body is rather light with decent carbonation levels. Nice stuff, although I prefer 1809 a tad more."
"75cl bottle. Pours cloudy light yellow with a small white head that dies quickly. Little lacing. Smells citric and fruity; I would describe it more tangy than sour. Definite yeasty notes. Tastes quite sweet, actually, with a lot of wheat character and only mild tartnesss. Citrus. Lots of cereal grain. Light, borderline watery body, which is to be expected, but the carbonation is too low and doesn't really suite the beer. Definitely easy to drink, but I've certainly had better berliner weissebiers."
"Overall, a very disappointing beer that continues my hit or miss from the Bruery (2 great and 2 so-so). I love sour beers so had high hopes for this one but not much here besides lemon tinged water. Can't really recommend. Rotation: not avail here. One and done as I didn't find much flavor to it."
"Overall, this beer reaffirmed why berliner weisses are one of my favorite styles of beer. Simple, clean with a hint of sourness. I forgot to add...extremely sessionable."
"Taste is much more of the same. And the initial flavors thru midway through each sip are very nice. But there's still this burnt, smoky grain flavor in the backend/finish that keeps getting my attention and detracting from the rest of the beer. If it weren't for this, this beer would be very enjoyable. As it is, it's still solid, but just can't focus on the rest of the beer, while I now that flavor is coming in the finish."
"The Kings Of Hop"
"Overall, not a bad beer. I know nothing of the style, and therefore don't know if that wet moldy hay/stale wheat character is supposed to be there, or an off taste developed somewhere along the line. I wish it was more tart and sour than it is. I'll have to have this agian, and others in the style, to find out if this is a good representation of the style, or if The Bruery put their own twist on it that I just don't care for."
"Moderate and lively carbonation making it very refreshing and thirst quenching. Light on the tongue and a nice tart dryness in the end. Nice summer drink, glad this style is brewed somewhat locally and available in bottles."
"Great to see this beer make it all the way to Masachusetts. I bought this bottle at Winchester Wine and Spirits. Poured in to a white wine glass, it actually looks a lot like white wine. It is a hazy golden straw color, and does not foam up all that much. Smell is very similar to a Sauv Blanc or perhaps a Riesling in that it is tart and has some grape character to it. Very tart to start, with a nice backing dash of carbonation. Very light in body, I would recommend serving this one cold, as it is simply not as refreshing when warm. The low alcohol level makes this one you could drink quite a few of, however, some may be put off by the sour nature of it. This is a great Berliner that competes with the German examples in many ways. I might save a bit of my bottle to see how it does with some of the syrup added. Cheers"
"This drinks reasonably well; it may be a little TOO benign in spots while the grains have a little bit of heft that can be filling. Nevertheless, this is quite an enjoyable beverage. Wish I had more of this over the summer."
"The 750 ml bottle was great for a glass each for two. Of all the different beers I've had my wife try this is one style she really enjoys."
"D: What a refreshing beer. I can see how this could be sipped on all day with little to no consequences. Superb!"
"Overall, pretty good. I would like to try this with some syrup."
"I just didn't dig this one. The pour wasn't too bad. Light, hazy straw colored. Decent, loose frothy head on the pour, pearly white. Not a ton of retention but decent lacing. The smell was very interesting. Unconventional but interesting. Plenty of toasted wheat and some odd spices. Yeasty but not overly estery. Some tartness, but again, odd. The taste was full of the toasted wheat but with some unidentifiable off flavors, or what I feel were off. This was washed away but a lemon water or watered down lemonade type flavor. Some tart fruits before the lemon water but very light in both fruit and tartness. The mouthfeel was very watery and the carbonation couldn't help it. The low ABV would help the drinkability but the off flavors and watered down mouthfeel doesn't make me want to drink this."
"Pours a super pale yellow with a small white head. A delicate nose of lemon and soft toasty wheat. Very light in body, with crisp lively carbonation. Light, slightly tart, extremely refreshing and very drinkable. This is the kind of ""extreme style"" i would like to see more breweries doing, with that said, The Bruery nailed it."
"Drinkability- Sitting at 3.1% this thing isn't going to be anywhere near hard to drink. The beer is lightly tart and super refreshing and oh so delicious. Honestly I think I like New Glarus's a TAD better since it's filtered and has less of that floury/wheat bite. Either way, lame bitching aside, great beer. Thanks Jeff!"
"Pours a pale yellow, straw yellow, couldn't be yellower, more yellow than mellow yellow. Very pale, almost colorless, a bit hazy though, but fairly clear, with a nice white head that forms on top. The head dies quickly to nothing, and leaves no lacing from the start. Not bad, but I guess that it actually looks quite average. The smell is nice, though all descriptors I could use would sound kind of disgusting. The first thing you get is burnt garbage, like stale bread, old vegetables, rotting starches (trust me on this, I have roommates that keep potatoes until they rot), with just a bit of tartness underneath it all. This is just right I would say - about the only time that hot garbage could be a good smell. The taste is right on too. Nice and tart, with a good back of pale graininess. Not much sweetness, it doesn't need much, just enough to balance the tartness a bit. So light and refreshing, but so interesting with the sour tastes. This yeast profile is actually a bit familiar to me, it reminds me of wild yeast that I caught in my own house - not overpoweringly sour and tart, no taste a vinegar, just a nice pleasant, slightly chalky tartness. A bit of the garbage comes in with the finish as you swallow the smell down. I'm a fan. The body is thin, of course, what else would you expect at this ABV, which I would say is right on for the style. The tartness fixes it back up. Pretty good, for 3.1. The drinkabiliy is just great. Perfect for a session beer. Light, refreshing, low in ABV, and the taste is just challenging and enjoyable enough that I could drink this a lot. When everyone asks ""What beer would you choose if it could only be one for the rest of your life?"" (assuming that it wasn't going to be your last by far, I suppose) I could probably be happy with this. So very simple and nice."
"D: I could easily sip on this throughout the day. I would never have guessed it to be so low in alcohol, but all of the flavors are great."
"D - At 3.1%, this is practically non-alcoholic...good alternative to lemonade on a hot day. Very easy drinking, if you are into sour/wild ales, this will fit the bill nicely. Probably too tart for people not accustomed to sours. Adding the traditional syrups to this beer will only make it more drinkable (especially for newbies), but I like it just fine by itself."
"The flavor is light and pleasant: lemongrass, citrics, a little bit of wheat flavor, a bit of funk. Very refreshing, with the nice tartness. Low alcohol, easy sipper. Pretty great."
"The beer is light bodied with a nice high medium level of carbonation a crisp mouthfeel. This is a hell of a beer."
"Served to me in a tulip. First time having this style of beer. Smelled kind of bad actually. Like cat piss and barnyard funk. Luckily the taste was stellar. Nice lemony sourness and acidity. It could almost be lemonade. Would definitely get again."
"Overall, wow, just wow. I was not sure what to make of this offering, but if this is a year round thing, I am really, really impressed. One of the light, most easy to drink things I have run across in a very long time. Go get this one, go get this one now."
"D - Good representation of the style, though it was a little undercarbonated, probably from the long journey from California. However, I found this to be a well-balanced Berliner Weiss that was refreshing and not overly tart."
"D: Toyed with a lower score, but really wasn't sure why I'd give LESS than a 5; drinkability is just about perfect. Intensely flavorful + terrific feel + minute ABV = 'outstanding' for my tastes. Highly recommended and one I plan to have again ASAP. Like right now...Geoff, can I get another?"
"HV"
"D - Very good example of a Berliner IMO, I am very glad I tried it on tap after only having a sample of a bottle at EBF earlier this year. The mild abv makes for a drinkable sour, a good way to start brunch."
"The beer pours a light gold color with minimal head retention and lacing. On the nose, this beer is quite tart, but with mouthwatering acidity. I get some lemon-lime aromas, which are replicated on the palate. The beer is just so light and easy to drink, and is just a joy to drink. It's a bit more sour and tart then I've ever come across in a berliner weisse previously, but is still very thirst quenching and delicious. Drinkability is exceptional. What a treat!"
"drinkability is excellent. perfectly proportioned with a crisp, refreshing profile. an excellent summer beer with the perfect balance of funk and sourness. cheers!"
"Drinkability is very high. The menu said they sold this by the boot, which I was ready to split with my friend, but they had all broke. It would have gone down easily though! Nice lemon wheat taste, clean and light, yummy."
"D - The drinkability is off the charts with this one - great balance of tart, sour, and sweet elements and huge flavor for such a low ABV brew. Anyone who digs this style should check this one out immediately."
"I was glad to finally try this one. Being as though most 3.10% beers have no flavor, this one was great. There aren't many examples of this style that are avaialble. It was perfect after having a few bigger beers."
"This tart beer was a cloudy pale lemon yellow color with a good 1 to 1 1/2 inch cotton white head of foam. This head of foam had good retention that left behind a tiny skim of white foam and just a few small white blots of lace. As soon as I twisted off the cap, out comes a super strong aroma of sour and tart lemons. With the strong scent of lemons is that unique farmyard scent that can only come from Brett yeast. Rounding off this potent aroma was a subtle whiff of malted wheat. Sometimes this malted wheat smelled like soggy cereal and sometimes it didn't. I wish I could explain it. Even with the strong taste of tart lemons, this was still a light bodied beer. If you couldn't tell already, this beer has a long lasting lingering aftertaste of tart lemons and that down of the farm taste that comes with the Brett yeast. This is truly a unique and tasty beer. I never thought a Berliner Weisse could be this damn sour, but Bruery did it. And what it was! If you can find this beer on tap at your local bar, consider yourself lucky. Just make sure to pucker up!"
"This is a strange style, and I get that. However the smell was simply bad. It reeked. The flavor was much better and pretty nice. I'd like to try some more examples of this style, but I just didn't think it was a great beer, frankly."
"What a beer for a summer day. But I think the smartest thing I did was choose a 3.1% beer to get a whole half-gallon of. This should be gone in no time."
"Overall this was a very solid berlinerweiss, and makes me wish that the style were a bit more common. Certainly worth a shot, especially as I hear they will begin bottling this soon."
"D: This is truly quaffable, I need a sixtel!"
"D: A solid beer, my favorite so far from The Bruery. This is pretty much my go to beer from them. Just about every time I go to the tasting room, I leave with my growler filled with this."
"D - Great overall. Would seek again."
"It has such an unreal clean lactic flavor. No acetobacter/vinegar flavors. Pure clean sourness. There is no doubt in my mind that this is easily my favorite session beer of all time, and one if my absolute favorites of all time."
"Overall, a neat brew and one that would easily be a staple in my diet if I were able to find it more often. Great stuff, and worth a look."
"I really liked this quite a bit. Shame it's so tough to find."
"D: Good I like this one, will head back for a few more pints before I head home."
"drinkability: would be great for a warm spring day especially at 3.1% abv...too bad I didn't have a growler with me."
"I couldn't find any Woodruff syrup locally in time. Having sampled this beer before with some though, I enjoyed the curious shift in taste(cotton candy), & would take it either way. :)"
"If I did like more of the sour beers, this would be the one I would drink purely based on it's smoothness and balance."
"Thanks to Patrick for bringing this to philly."
"D: I'd be hard pressed to find a session beer that rivals this in taste. At 3.5% you could start your day with this and not feel bad."
"I look forward to having this again."
"Overall, an interesting Berliner Weiss that seems to have just a touch more of a gueuze-like quality to it than is common. Loved it."
"Poured a lighter and hazy yellow color with a large sized white head. Aromas of wheaties cereal, citrus, musty, yeast, and citrus (lemons). Tastes of lemons, lighter wheatines, and fruity (apples). Light to medium tart and sour finish. Refreshing and enjoyable!"
"From a growler fill from the Bruery. Aroma is yeasty, with a little lemony spicy note. Pale straw, fizzy with a small white head. Sour, tart, dry and carbonated. Light and refreshing. Who needs lemonade? This would be an awesome summer beer. Awesome beer."
"Review updated 10/31/09. Drinking this again, also had some more examples of the style since originally posted. This is the best one I have tasted, bumping up the taste score to reflect this."
"The body is light but has some lingering sweetness. Overall Berliner Weisses are tough. Not bad, just missing some more sour/lactic quality."
"UPDATE 6/20: more sour and tart flavors + less tonic water character = better beer. Lemme up the score here."
"Cat piss and cider. And I am quite familiar with the style and its production, and this is not quite right. It's not horrible (well, unless you think all Berliner-style weisse is horrible...), but it should be better, somehow cleaner, and definitely less cidery. Oddly, it's an incredibly easy beer to make. And this is a little known fact, but because of that, it was actually quite common in the U.S. at one point. I digress, you are kind of at the mercy of the 'unknown' in its production, but you do have some control, and you do have taste buds... it's also an easy beer to blend if something goes astray! I've never had another beer from The Bruery so I can't judge it against anything else they've done. Hopefully what I had was just a bad batch. Oh, I should mention though, that it was well-received by the rest of my party."
"D: A nice beer from the Bruery, would be great on a hot day. Not a style I have a lot of experience with, glad to see a local brewer taking on this kind of beer."
"Pours a very light, clear gold. The smell is predominantly wheat, basically like a wit with no spice. There is some tartness there but it is in really small amounts. The taste is, again, a nice subdued wheatiness with a very faint fruitiness, almost like it was fermented with a kolsch yeast that's giving it a bit of fruity esters. Very good overall. One could drink this all day and night it's so good."
"First of this style I have had but knew what to expect going in, exactly how I pictured it in most ways, would make a great summer beer, would not mind having this one again, just heard there was more of this and it was not solely brewed for the festival, go grab a growler if you get a chance, glad I got to try this beer from the new OC brewer, it was nice to see somebody branch out and brew something different for a change"
