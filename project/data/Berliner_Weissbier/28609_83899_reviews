"Overall: a very nice and flavorful take on the berliner. Tastes quite similar to ng strawberry rhubarb but with a bit more funk, in a good way."

"Thanks, Deltoro, for the opportunity"

"Pour is hazed golden amber with a tight fizzy white head.  Nose is plastic, lemon, faint grain, and a hint of strawberry.  Taste doesn't have the plastic, a bit sweet, no grain.  Strawberry, faint kiwi.  Light body, decent carb, very dry finish."

"Shared at the Batch 600 release in the Swamp Head parking lot. Pours orangish red colored with a fluffy white head. Aroma of some strawberry and floral notes, wheaty berliner and yeasty sour notes. Flavor follows with lightly tart notes and strawberry, floral flavors, wheaty berliner finish is there but subdued. Light bodied and high carbonation. Though I’m not a huge fan of the style, this was pretty solid. I wouldn’t turn it down if offered again. Thanks for the share!"

"Really an outstanding beer that is top notch all the way through. Decent complexity and as drinkable as the style should be. Definitely worth seeking out!"

"Medium body with a lot of harsh acidity and slight acetone/solvent character. Very sour with lots of funky bugs, citric acidity and lactic funk along with some dry toothpick-y oak and light fruit sweetness. Hints of strawbery and cream with some cherry and other sweet berries. Well integrated sweetness and a decent amount of sourness but this beer is a bit harsh with too sting of a solvent presence for my preference."
""
"O: Interesting take on a Berliner. Fruit was much more apparent in the nose than the taste, but was a welcome addition. Thinking that cellaring this one for almost a year maybe wasn't the best idea, was probably a bit more balanced when the fruit was a little more potent. Having said that, very good take on the style. Nice work Night Shift."

"O: Bright and easy to drink. Kiwi is subtle but strawberry adds a nice sweetness. Delicious, thanks again Kevin."
""
"A pretty good beer that could be better. The sourness becomes fatiguing and doesn't allow the fruits to showcase themselves nearly enough. I enjoyed this but I think it has the opportunity to be a pretty great beer...it's just not there now."

"This is light bodied with a modest amount of carbonation. It is unique and quite tart but almost too bitey to the point where it hinders the overall drinkability. I think these guys are on the verge of greatness with their berliners. The fruit combinations are fantastic. It's just a little too sharp and the wild character doesnt always work."

"Very interesting, very complex sour Berliner Weiss. Very enjoyable. Highly recommend."
""
""
""
"Overall- A nice beer, and close to home to boot. Nicely wheaty like a Berliner Weiss should be, but I don't get much of the fruit. Solid overall."
""
"This beer pours a pretty pink hue with a nice white head. The beer has great carbonation, which helps my enjoyment of this style. There is only light fruit on the nose. Loads of yogurty tartness on the nose. The first drink is fairly lactic and acidic. Then the fruit comes through very well. You get fresh strawberry and even a bit of the kiwi. Very well made Berliner with plenty of tartness but good fruit flavor."

"Pours a nice pinkish with very little haziness and a one inch head that dissipates fairly quickly. Smell is strawberry and kiwi, some lactic sourness and hint of the hibiscus. Taste is pretty tart and dry. I get some of the strawberry and kiwi, a little lemon. Mouthfeel is lighter with medium to high amount of carbonation. Overall a great beer, very clean and refreshing."

""
""
""
""

"Overall - I don't love the sourness in this. Kinda weird. Decent fruit though."
""

"M: Light bodied. High carbonation clears palate."
"Mildly hazy pink color reminiscent of grapefruit juice with a frothy light pink head that dissipates relatively rapidly without much lace to speak of. The aroma is mostly strawberries with a lot of noticeable lactic sourness and a good amount of Brett mustiness. The flavor, on the other hand – look out. This thing is mouth-puckeringly sour. Strawberry and kiwi are prevalent with tons of sour acidity. At the finish, an earthy, floral taste comes out that may be the hibiscus and an earthy, musty, and funky flavor that has to be some Brett. The mouthfeel is tough to appreciate just because this thing is so sour but it’s light-medium-bodied with good carbonation. While this is too sour to fit into the Berliner weisse category, it is a delicious beer that is definitely worth a try if you can get ahold of it. Especially after seeing “brewery only” on the label, thank you so, so much for giving me a chance to try this beer, Jared! Cheers!"

"O - This is a tart Berliner that has a nice sweet and fruit presence that balances, but does not diminish, the tartness you'd expect from a Berliner."
""
""
"D - This was quite enjoyable and I could imagine having many a glass on a hot summer day. Perhaps a bit too sour for stylistic authenticity, but a very nice fruited American sour ale otherwise. Will have to keep Night Shift on my radar, as this was a pleasant surprise."

"This was a great summer beer. Pleasantly tangy, sweet. I could drink a few of these."
""
"O - Very good and enjoyable sour beer. I would call this a bit too sour to fit well into the Berliner Weiss category. Nice fruity flavors to complement the sour, touch of funk. Just a very good sour beer."

"This stuff is simply awesome. Beautiful hazy, bright ruby red with a frothy but short-lived light pink head. Huge aromas of fresh fruit, yeast, and funk. Crazy carbonation. Probably one of the most carbonated beers I've ever had. In a good way. Great flavor and fantastic body. You get the strawberries, kiwi, and hibiscus if you search hard enough. I could drink this every day for many days at a time. Refreshing, delicious, sour, well-crafted. High quality beer in general and even better for the style."

"A wonderful, light, refreshing, complex brew. The fruit and added flavors work wonderfully, and add great complexity. Found this at Berman's in Arlington. Couple of bottles left."

"Comes to the table a light pink/amber color with an almost no existent head. The aroma is a little funky and a bit lactic with lots of strawberry dripping through my nose hairs. The flavor is lightly fruity with strawberries and hints of sour cherries poking through. Lightly sweet brown sugar and a whole lot of lactic flavor. Medium body with a moderate level of carbonation and a tart puckering mouthfeel. I typically don't enjoy a Berliner but gussied up with strawberry and kiwi and it works for me, I enjoyed this with some brisket and a vinegar sauce."

"Ordered from the sour reserve program and.picked up by caguiar65 (thanks chris!), enjoyed from a night shift wine glass. Brew pours a majestic ruby with a nice fizzy head that fizzed away almost immediately leaving spotty lacing at best. Great pinkish orange color. Smell is soft soury egg with fruit. You definitely get the strawberry and kiwi with hints of floral notes. Subtle sourness. Flavor matches the nose with great fruitiness and just the right amount of eggy funk and floral, almost brett like sweetness. Super easy drinker and a.pleasure in this beautiful summer day. Really glad to have another bottle and can't wait to try more from this brewery, hopefully get a chance to get a few more of these to enjoy all summer. Cheers night shift, well done!"
"O - awesome. so sour and fresh and fruity. good for June, I like that it reflects the season for the ingredients."
""
"My favorite weisse from Night Shift to date. Tart and funky, but uses fruit to great effect. Planning on cleaning up with a case on the next release. Could drink an entire bottle, but it would probably crack your tongue."
""
""
""
"Ever Weisse is an amazingly interesting and complex Berliner weisse that makes terrific use of the added flavors. This brewery-only release is reason enough to make the trip to Night Shift."

"Overall really good beer for a fruit sour, but as a Berliner Weiss it's not quite there... I'm all for pushing the bounds of styles but this is way too far out there, very very barely even resembling a Berliner Weiss, but as a sour strawberry beer it's awesome."
"O - Overall I fucking loved this beer, so much berry with this brew, it's a potent fruit but works nicely with this style, very drinkable, rush I could have gotten more of this."
""
""
""
""
"O: This is my first beer from Night Shift and I am really impressed I will definitely be back at this brewery as for their beer itself it does live up to my expections but it does not blow me away. The strawberry and kiwi flavors are there but I wish it was not so harsh and vinegary. With that being said I would definitely recommend this beer."
""
""
"O: Huh, not what I was expecting. A great berliner. It's tart and funky but not horrifying. Has enough sweetness to balance it out somewhat but not completely. Strawberry and kiwi are great fruits for such a concoction I think. Great job Night Shift."

"Beer pours a beautiful reddish pink, almost like ruby red grapefruit juice. It pours with a fizzy, eggshell white head of big soapy bubbles that fades away slowly. The head leaves a very light lacing of thin sticky bubbles that form clouds on the sides of the glass. The beer’s body seems clean of particles, but hazy with no site of the other side of the glass. On the nose the beer smells like ripe and jammy strawberry. It is thick on the nose, and beautifully fruity, and though it is one dimensional with pure strawberry and maybe just a kiss of citric kiwi, it is still a big and beautiful smell that is rich and complicated in its own right. On the tongue the beer tastes tartly acidic and then fruity sweet with a lingering pucker but no traces of bitterness. In flavor the beer begins as puckering citric sour but then blossoms into huge strawberry flavors with touches of fuzzy sweet kiwi fruit and a very faint hint of savory hibiscus. The finish and aftertaste bring more of the subtle hibiscus flavors into the mouth alongside ripe strawberry skin and acidic kiwi fruit. The malt in this, of course, is light, but does give a faint touch of grainy breadiness. The aftertaste softly rings with lingering hibiscus and even fainter touches of strawberry. In the mouth, the beer feels sharply citric, but on the light side of medium in body. The real weight in the beer’s body comes from the real fruit that was added to the beer, and which (oddly enough) can be felt as a slight graininess on the tongue. The carbonation is sharp and prickly on the tongue, working to keep in order the massive, ripe, and sweet fruit flavors of the beer, and it achieves this nicely. The mouth is left puckering from the sourness of the beer, and also begging for more beer. Overall this is a beautiful example of the burgeoning American Weisse style. It is fruity, sour, and very refreshing while still being puckeringly refreshing. This beer tastes great. It is what all fruit beers should be with its beautiful fresh fruit flavors and its thirst quenching beer touches. Try this beer for sure."

"O/D-A really neat brew. Beautiful looking. I really enjoyed this. It may not be the most complex sour, but the combo of kiwi and strawberry is pretty awesome. A treat."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Pretty nice twist on a Berliner weisse. The fruit addition and hibiscus is coil as it gets. Will look more for this in the future."
"I love fruited berliners, and this is a really stellar example of an oft overlooked style. Wish it were made in larger quantities, absolutely seek it out."

"Pours a murky orange with a foamy bone colored head that fades to nothing. Small dots of lace slowly drip into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is sour, tart, and funky with some berry and floral aromas. Taste is much the same with fruity and acidic finish. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer that is tasty and super easy to drink."
"Would I buy it again? Absolutely."
"O- This was a nice surprise from a local brewery that's still fairly new to the craft beer scene. In my opinion this is definitely the best beer they've brewed yet and a nice Berliner. I definitely recommend checking it out if you like sours."
""
""
"O - A great release from the upstart brewery. Apparently they only brewed one batch so I feel lucky to get my hands on a bottle (they were selling it at a local tasting event). Delicious and balanced. Complex enough to savor but refreshing enough to satisfy."
