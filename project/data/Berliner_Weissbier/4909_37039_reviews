"Tart Citrus Berliner Style - could knock back a 6er of this on a summer day easily"
"O: TART: would be more refreshing on a hot summer day than with the 3 feet of snow I'm staring at;"

"Not much to look at like most Berliner Weissbiers, not much head or lacing.  Nice smell, you get the citrus, more of a lemon with some funk.  Excellent flavor, similar to the smell, some citrus and very tart.  Very low on the ABV but this would be an unbelievable summer, hot weather beer that I enjoyed very much."
"Nice and more tart for your average Berliner.  Great beer."

"Pour is pale straw yellow with a white head.  Nose is husky grain, some raw doughy malts, loads of lacto, moderate lemon.  Taste is lots of slightly less raw dough, light grain, wheat bread, a lot of lacto cream with a lemon punch in back.  Very light body, a bit creamy and syrupy, lighter carb, faint sour finish."

"O:  Clean and probably the most sour berliner I've ever tried.  All previous samples have been pleasantly tart while this one is definitely in the realm of a sour.  Very good but an unexpected amount of pucker."

"O- I enjoyed this but found some of the flavors and sensations to be slightly off. I have found many berliner weisses lately that surpass this, so the competition is getting stiffer."
""
""
"O: . Not awesome, but nice to find an example in this style that is assumedly close to the original style of the beer. Bought at Bruisinâ€™ Ales Asheville, drank at Deerfield Beach, FL."

"O: I enjoyed the surprising balance between lacto and malt flavors here - many domestically-produced examples seem to focus on the wild qualities and eschew malt flavors, essentially making the beers flat and dry... I could do this one again - recommended"
""
""
""
"Poured into a New Glarus pils glass...it was convenient, and somewhat appropriate for the style. Hazy yellow-straw color, with a small cap of fizzy white head that sank to an assertive ringlet and held there; minimal lacing. Tiny bubbles rise from the bottom of the glass. In the nose, sweet malted grains, light notes of lemon and grassy funk. The taste was crisp with a lemony tartness, slightly acidic, apple skin, cereal grains, sourdough, honey, the latter of which came out a bit more as the beer warmed, in the aroma and taste, leaving a residual sweetness in the finish. Light-bodied, crisp and enjoyable overall."
""
""
"Overall, I will buy this beer again. It is fabulous and I actually appreciate the low ABV. It makes it easy just to kick back and have a beer, with a GREAT deal of flavor and complexity, and still be able to go about doing stuff without feeling a bit fuzzy."

"O-a decent Berlinner Weisse, refreshing and easy drinking"

"An interesting beer that I'm glad that I had. However, I really wish I could have done it justice with some traditional flavorings added."
"11.2 ounce bottle. Served in a Sam Adams Boston Lager glass, the beer pours a hazy straw gold color with about an inch white head that didn't stay around for too long. Not much lacing. The brew smells like wheat/bready malt and lemons/lemon peel. The taste is mostly like the aroma, it's nice and tart, with some green grape flavors noticeable too. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, it's smooth and has moderate carbonation. I think this is a nice, enjoyable brew. It's refreshing and easy enough to drink, definitely worth trying. $3.59 a bottle."
"O: Unlike many other berliner weisses, this beer is all about the bacteria and features very little wheat/malt or yeast character. I'd prefer a bit more wheat character but this is pretty nice."

"fast forward to tonight (2:30am on a september saturday night), i pop open a bottle i ended up ordering online - and every single thing i remembered from this beer came back immediately. absolutely my favorite in a style i was not really a fan of - this made me fall in love."

"I first tried this back-to-back with the Brett-ed version, but that was a while ago, and I only have this bottle now. Cool story, bro. Anyway, this stuff pours a lightly hazy straw topped by over a finger of relatively short-lived white foam. The nose comprises mildly-tart lemon zest, a twist of tart orange zest, some light sweet flowers, and a touch of mild sweet biscuit in the background. The taste brings in more of the same, with a stronger tartness throughout. However, due to its incredible lightness and crispness, the bulk of the flavor only lasts a short time, leaving a small squad of tartness to linger for a bit. The body is fairly light, with a light moderate carbonation and a crisp, dry finish. Overall, a damn solid Berliner, something that can deliver some sour without tearing the enamel from your teeth and can do so on a nicely regular interval."
"pretty good berliner overall. i plan on getting some more. perfect for summer."

"Overall: Nice Berliner, could use a little more pop."

"It pours a murky, yellow-brown color - kind of like straw. There's one finger's worth of head and it disappears within seconds. No retention and no lacing whatsoever. There's citrus on the nose with some yeasty bread as well, but not much going on. The first thing that hits me is the carbonation which is very aggressive. Then the tartness hits me...it's very tart and the depth of flavour isn't quite there to balance it out or back it up. I find that i'm puckering more than i'm savoring it. There's some lemon and orange going on and overall, it's a refreshing berliner, but that's about all it has going for it. It's a one-trick pony and far from special."

"330 ml bottle into pint glass, no bottle dating. Pours lightly hazy very pale straw color with a 1-2 finger dense white head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Light spotty lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of big tart apple, pear, grape, raspberry, lemon, hay, grass, honey, wheat, funk, white vinegar, and earthy spiciness. Fantastic aromas with great balance and complexity of fruity/funky notes with some light malt presence. Taste of tart apple, pear, grape, lemon, honey, wheat, grass, hay, light vinegar, funk, and yeast earthiness. Light fruity tartness on the finish; with lingering notes of light fruits, citrus, honey, hay, grass, light vinegar, light funk, and earthiness on the finish for a short bit. Good balance and complexity of fruity/funky ester flavors with slight malt balance; feels fairly watery, but not too bad; with zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and light-medium bodied; with a smooth, crisp, and slightly acidic mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with zero warming noticed after the finish as expected. Overall this is a very nice Berliner weisse style. Nice overall balance and complexity of yeast ester flavors; and extremely smooth to drink. The aromas were the winner vs the taste; but this was still very enjoyable."

"Overall: Nice berliner weissbeir. nothing crazy, but outstanding drinkability. great summer beer."
"11.2 oz bottle that cost $4.69, yowza! Very light yellow color, ok head. Aroma is tart, peach almost, nice. Flavor is tart, peaches, honey, malt, quite good. Way, way too easy to drink, I killed my glass in under ten minutes. Its really too bad the style is hard to find and expensive, this would get swilled during the summertimes."

"an interesting Berliner, lower abv than ive seen in one of these. the pour looks like lemonade, really pale yellow, almost white really, with a lot of haze and not much head. the nose is very lemony, but also a little more wheat malt to this than I expected based on the color, also a touch of honey sweetness apparently to counteract the intense acidic and citrus bitterness. the flavor doesn't really hold onto much of that malt character or the sweetness, maybe just a touch of floral perfume essence amidst the piquant sour flavor. lemon zest and acid in the finish, typical of the style. its a very good version, but it comes through a little thin, even for this genre, also soda like carbonation may be a little over the top, still, the beer is yummy and refreshing, I will enjoy this even more come summer weather, which has to be about due right? I think the gose from these guys was a bit more refined, but both are solid choices if you can find them."
"Overall, super-easy to drink, and given the abv, you could make a night of these. If I ever see these for sale around me (I haven't yet..), I would buy a case."
""
"(O)- Its definitely a nice Berliner. Fairly easy to find in the area and not overly expensive. Not earth changing for the style, but really no complaints."
""
""
""
"Not the cleanest Berliner. Fairly sharp and acidic at every turn, but it definitely packs a little punch."
"This beer is easy to drink, and at 3abv that's a welcomed sign. Should have this one again on a hot summer day. Very nice, maybe I'll try it with some sort of syrup next time"
""
"Overall: lacks balance, but a very tart and refreshing beer in general. I like sour beers, and this is a good take on the style."
"Flavor is much better than appearance, thank goodness.. It's a decent BWeiss, but no where near the best or top. Recommended, but at $5/12oz...think twice."
""
""
"Could use more carbonation, although the sourness does a good job of creating a prickling sensation anyway..."
""
"A decent interpretation of the style and a good intro into sours. I'd buy this again only if it was the only Berliner Weisse on the shelf. With that being said, I can imagine the Brett L version of this being fantastic."
""
""
"Medium bodied and thankfully more interesting than the aroma suggests with a nice balance of funk and citric acidity. It's still light and pretty tame for the style but you can at least pick up the wheat beer characteristics. Only slightly tart with more of a lactic presence than expected countered by sweet citrus, bready yeast and mild spicy. Faint peppery clove flavor countered by hints of lemon juice and sourdough bread. Not too exciting but well balance, clean, crisp and refreshing."
"A decent brew, with parts I really like and a few things missing. Still, I would have this again."
"Bottle: Poured alight hazy color weisse with a large slightly off-white foamy head with great retention and some great lacing. Aroma consists of slightly tart nose with some salty notes and light herbal finish. Taste is a weird mix between some light tart notes with some distinct salty notes. Body is about average with a smooth texture and great carbonation. Must be me but I felt too much salt in this beer and not enough tart notes."
""
""
""
""
"O: Enjoyable on a warm late afternoon. Easy to drink."
""
"Pours a cloudy yellow color with a white head. Lightly funky on the nose. Popcorn, grass, lactobacillus, and some lemon. A bit of lemon peel, wheat bread, and hints of sweet malt. The flavor is quite crisp, dry, and tart. Lots of lactic acidity, lemon, and lemon peel. Some straw, a touch of unripe strawberry, grass, and a light malt sweetness with a definite wheat and popcorn character."
""
""
"Its pretty dry, very clean, it is enjoyable as long as you don't think about how much you paid for it. A great option on a hot day and limitless wallet."
"O: The taste is significantly better than the very faint nose, but this beer could use a bit more acidity. It's quite dry and tart, but there is no real acidic punch. The spicy aftertaste is a bit off-putting, too."
""
"Crisp and light with a bit of a creamy flow, the feel is good, and refreshing at that."
"I think I waited a bit long on this one as the malts are kind of stale...good thing there isnt much of them, haha! There is a nice sourness to it that is light and refreshing. This would be an absolutely perfect beer to have after mowing the yard. After having more than a handful of berliners, I think I prefer the ones that have a little more malt and alcohol to them like the 1809 and the DFH Festina. Very good though and would love to try a fresher sample."
""
""
"Light sourness and acidity but very palatable. This is perfect for a hot humid summer day. The 3% alcohol only makes this easier to drink. Some straw and light bread in the malt character but the fermentation and yeast drive this."
""
""
""
"O= This is a great brew that fits into a style more people need to make. The berliner is sooo good for summer and worth every penny. Buy this beer if you see it and if you like berliners because it's worth it."
"Delightful."
"Decent enough, and incredibly drinkable, though the wheat flavors dominate and I was wishing for more lemon/apple/sour flavors. Simple."
"Pours a lively light yellow ale with four fingers of lingering white foam. Smells of light lactic acid and almost a sour milk smell. Actually quite pleasant when paired with the wheat tones. Flavor is mealy with some nice subdued lactic sourness and hints of a yogurt tone honestly. It's okay, but nothing special. Medium bodied with hi carb and an off dry finish. Nice beer, not as good as their Gose, IMO."
""
"Very refreshing, big on sour lemon with a nice surprising finish"
"I drank a lot of beers to get to 500 reviews and this was not one of the better ones. Not exactly forgettable, because I will definitely remember how subpar this one was. Oh well, live and learn I suppose."
"D: i find the sour OJ aroma/tastes rather off-putting. after it subsides, the brew becomes rather refreshing and enjoyable, like many other berliner weisse's. also, i have read these brews typically have no head on them, so i am a little unsure what to think of the frothy head that came with this brew. meh, sort of middle of the road in my opinion."
""
"Simple refreshing strong flavored beer. Gimme another, give it here. Easy to get, always on shelf, I know that shouldn't matter, but..."
""
"Light and easy to drink. Would pair well with salad or fish."
"Pours a moderate-light golden color with a short white head and not too much in the way of lacing. The nose carries some bready malt and a very faint acidity. Not much going on. The flavor has a light breadiness and no real acidity. Perhaps a touch if I imagine it. This really does not get into the style. Light body and crisp carbonation; acidity is near negligible. Boring and way too plain."
""
"o - Overall a decent berlinerweiss. Not the sourest out there, but considering you can just buy it off the shelf worth checking out. Lightly sour in the nose and moreso in the taste."
""
"Well, this is the lowest ABV berliner Weisee I've had recently. I could drink a ton of this and the low acidity would make it that much easier to do. I wish it was summer. Surprisingly, I can't find this particular BW in the Philly area, which is odd."
"M-pretty full bodied for a low abv beer.really just the aftertaste that bothers me but makes this hard to drink. I will buy another and re review."
"O: Very nice example of the style and super easy to drink. Quite sessionable and at 3.0% ABV you could probably put down quite a few of these in a setting with no adverse effects. I would describe the beer as refreshing."
""
""
"-I was definitely hoping for more out of this beer, but it scored high marks in the worst 2 areas"
"I'll sip this one without the syrup next time just to know what's going on with the beer by itself. But as far as the style goes, with syrup, it's excellent."
""
"Overall, a very nice Berliner Weisse. An acceptable sour for those with the palette for it. Sours native to Germany may even pre-date the Lambics of Belgium."
""
""
""
"Two words. Actually is drain pour still two words or is it one, now? Drain pour, anyway. Ouch."
"Not one of my favourite Berliner Weisses, and one which makes me question the genre yet again. Probably just really needs that woodruff syrup."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O:Average, B quality, nothing special but glad to compare it to the style."
"Overall Impression- Not my favorite and for the price I paid for it, not worth it! I was about to become a fan of this style but this one didn't do it for me at all! No sourness to it at all and just really tasted like a European light brew or a Czech pilsner with a bit of lemon. I'm going to be inquiring about more ""top of the line"" brews that are in this price range before making a purchase next time. Live and learn."
" Overall, it is a decent beer. I like the low ABV, and the refreshing qualities. It isn't my favorite, and I probably will not seek it out again, but it was decent and I'm glad to have tried it."
"Pours a clear light gold with a fluffy white head that dissipates quickly, leaving nothing but a slight ring and a steady stream of bubbles. Aromas of tart green apple, lemon zest, wheat, and yogurt dominates, very crisp and lactic. Taste is similar to the nose, the yogurt character stands out the most. Imagine a lemon yogurt with wheat granola and you have this beer. Mouthfeel is crisp and inviting, with a thin body and sharp, spritzy carbonation. Overall a very drinkable Berliner Weiss that bring a lot to the table with its high level of lactic character."
"A really good beer which is a nice satisfying session funk."
"Poured a 3"" white head. Slightly hazy lemonade yellow colored body. Smells of spice and banana. Taste has a general fruitiness but also an interesting combination of sweet, sour, and downright tart. It's surprisingly fresh for an import. All in all I'd say this is indeed a standout of a Weisse although I personally don't go for high on the tart and sour side."
"Meh, not impressed. Somehow too delicate for the style, which is odd, I know, but not nearly enough tartness compared to the gems I've had in the style."
"If this is the style, A+ for making a beer in that style. However, I now can decide that it's a terrible style. I do not recommend this beer."
"This has some seriously odd flavor. I detect pumpkin in the aroma, but the flavor is much stronger than anticipated. It is a sour type of flavor, but it is not an acidic sourness like sour ales."
"This is a pleasant-tasting and mostly inviting Berlinerweisse. While I like, and mostly prefer, stronger variations on the style, I do like this and wouldn't mind having another."
"O - Great summer sour beer and a good interpretation of this style."
"O. I am pretty sure I bought an old bottle, which might be the price one pays for loving such an unappreciated style. Still, the style generally holds up well to aging, so the review will stand. Hopefully, I find some fresh bottles and have reason to revise this review.Â "
"I was told I was hard core for refusing syrup..."
"This is a light bodied brew with a fizzy high level of carbonation. It is super crisp and refreshing. No indication of alcohol inclusion and one just isn't enough. Yes sir, may I please have another."
"Clear light golden colored, the beer has a thin, white head that leaves minimal lacing. Fruity and slightly musty aroma. The beer lacks the funky and/or lactic presence I have come to enjoy in beers of this ilk. The body is thin, with light carbonation, subtle zestiness. Average. Difficult to finish the bottle. I won't order this again."
"D-Very easy drinking, and I could see this being a real staple in the summer months. If only I could find a local example of this one to have around in the fridge regularly."
"D - I could drink a beer like this all night. Not huge but very flavorful on the palate and the low abv makes this unbeatable. Good stuff, I really enjoyed it."
"Thin mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"I lift and sip, savoring the sour, complex notes of varying sourness battling on my tongue. Very light bodied and packed full of flavor. I didn't realize this was going to be so lovely. Not at all disappointed here. I'll be revisiting sooner or later."
"Very pale yellow with a silver hue, no head or lacing to speak of. A pleasant lactc sourness on the nose, along with sour cherry, buttermilk is prevalent. The taste reveals sourdough starter with tart citrus and more lactic acid notes. Nice for the style but i did a bit more than a 3% beer at 6.49 a bottle."
"Great balance of tartness in this beer. Some wheat character but, as appropriate, the citric character is center stage. Not as lemony and more of a generaized citrus note. Tangy but not jaw clenchingly sour, and the tart note did not grow or become too much as the beer progressed. One of the few of this style that I could session."
"Overall, it is definitely a unique Hefe, but the ABV is oddly low. That makes it taste too much like a juice to me. One is enough and I'd probably pass on it the next time I saw it."
"Pours a very murky and watery brown with absolutely zero head. Very spotty strands of lace on the drink down. Smells of wheat, slight lemon, and very faint vinegar. Taste is of wheat and weak lemon. Very little tartness for this beer, which is odd for this style. Good carbonation with a light, easy drinking body. This beer isn't too good. I was hoping for a tartness that just wasn't there. I would not recommend this one to anyone."
"Overall this is a nice middle-of-the-road berlinerweiss - nothing stands out as exceptional but it's something I could have quite a few of, especially in warmer weather. Worth a shot."
"D: As I mentioned earlier, I wouldn't feel bad drinking this for breakfast and then showing up to work. It's almost non-alcoholic by some standards, and I can see why it's popular. That said, it's not particularly complex--about as interesting as apple juice. Some woodruff or raspberry syrup really would help. I appreciate the style, but this one needs a bit more."
"The CPJ"
"I must say that they served it with some cherry syrup, which I added to a small amount of the beer. I preferred the beer ""as is"" though so drank most of it without any additive."
"Taste is light yeasty funkiness up front, then lightly fruity character with pear and lemon, then light aromatic grain, lightly tart and citric. It is not full of flavour, and rather on the thin bland side, but still good and refreshing."
"Poured a pale golden with a frothy white head. Aromas of granny smith apple, lemons and kinda bready. Tasted much the same. With a pleasant tartness. Light carbonation. Super refreshing and easy to drink. I could easily drink this all day long on any summer day."
"Very drinkable beer. Good summertime thirst quencher."
"Overall: very refereshing beer, great for a summer afternoon. That being said I still enjoyed the beer even thought its in the teens outside. Will drink the beer again."
"D: The beer is easy to drink and quite refreshing, despite the mild amount of sourness. The beer is very sessionable given its low alcohol content."
"A very pale straw color with lots of haze, a quick dissipating head. The nose reminds me of straw and wheat. I was hoping for more tartness. The taste is full of wheat, and pale malts and with a tart and sour bite to it that is mellowed by the wheat. Sharp carbonation, rather thin and thirst quenching. This is something I could quaff all day in copious amounts during the hot summer months."
"Trying a new Berliner Weiss is always fun, there aren't enough of these brewed. I'll probably be drinking this one again in the future..."
"Let's be honest, any Berliner Weisse can be drinkable, but this one just so happens to do its own thing as well. It's a beer worthy of cookout chug sessions and thoughtful after-dinner sipping. I can't think of a higher compliment than that."
"Cheers!"
"D-very drinkable, I was somewhat expecting something sour but this isn't close. Drinkable though, nonetheless."
"Overall, this is an average wheat beer, which would be truly awesome on a hot day after a long bike ride. It's also one I wouldn't mind trying on draft. I wouldn't recommend seeking it out, but if you run across a bottle and like Berliner weisse, I'd give it a shot."
"Drinkability was amazing. I was astounded by how much flavor could be packed into a 3% ABV beer. I could only wish this style would become America's new go-to summer brew."
"This beer is yellowish-brownish color with a few centimeters of white foam. The aroma is new leather, vinegar, fruit, and citrus. The mouthfeel is light, airy, and carbonated. The flavors are sour, tart, fruity. Its dryness becomes apparent through the center and it finishes bone -BONE- dry. Refreshing and appetizing. Not a bad brew at all."
"D- Perfect in this heat. I could throw back a few of these. Good stuff."
"With a BIT of fruit syrup - wow, what a delight!"
"This beer is a not a great berliner in my opinion. The acidic tartness is present but it is toned down to the point where much of the wheat beer flavor is present and you can almost taste the hops. This makes it taste closer to a lager than a wheat. Overall this is a decent beer, looks really pretty, taste isn't bad by any means but I prefer a stronger sour taste. Still one of my favorite beer styles on a day like today."
"drinkability: great summer ale and good for it's purpose"
"D: An easy drinking low alcohol beer for sure. Summertime in lieu of lemonade this would be a good choice though it's considerably more expensive than the better Hottenroth."
"Berliner Style Weisse is highly drinkable, but it was definitely not worth the price tag and I was a little dissapointed. I am not sure what a classic example of the style should taste like as I have only had the Bruery's Hottenroth to compare this one too, but I prefer the Bruery's version much more than this one."
"Brightly citrus and lactic flavors, not as sour as most berlinerweisses I've sampled lately. Light body, lots of carbonation, overall its pretty good but I've had better recently."
"D - This is a very light beer, with a clean, lactic sourness being the defining flavor characteristic. Somewhat less sour than I expected, it is still tart and refreshing but more drinkable than other examples of the style, it doesn't need the syrup that Berliner Weisse is often served with."
"11.2oz. bottle served in a Tank 7 tulip. Bottle conditioned. Poured a very pale yellow with two fingers plus of white head. Plenty of carbonation. Tart and fruity aroma. Very light bodied. Not as tart as the aroma would suggest, but it becomes more so as it warms. Some berry flavors. Fairly refreshing, but not really something I would drink a lot of."
"D - At 3.0%, this is practically alcohol free. Sampling this after the first lawn mowing of the season. Does the trick as a thirst quenching post work drink. Almost by definition, this style is very drinkable, and this is no exception. I wouldn't call this a great version of this style, but I definitely could drink this all day long."
"This can be a very refreshing drink, especially cold and at 3% abv one could drink a lot. Likely a drink in which one usually mixes syrup. Not a ""go to"" or food beer."
"It was difficult to find an appropriate score for drinkability. On one hand this beer is crisp and refreshing, and has almost no alcohol so it would be easy to chug it all day. On the other hand, it was a decent beer but not one which made me actually want to go back and have another. Overall, I'd say this beer is worth a look if you like this style."
"Found this little (11.2oz) baby sitting at one of my favorite local bottle shops. Being one never to shy a way from a Berliner Weiss (they are, like, totally awesome) I dropped the $3.29 and put it in the sack. Popped the cap and was instantly hit with a mild lactic twang along with, uh oh, wet cardboard. This beer has a slight oxidized aroma to it. Hopefully it wont be to prevalent in its makeup. There also is a slight lemon zest and grassy hop aroma that hides the slight oxidization. The flavor profile is much the same except for one big difference. The infection in the Berliner Weiss isn't entirely lactic in nature. There is definitely something else in there. It reminds me of sour yogurt pushing on the tail of the flavor profile. The mouthfeel isn't as crisp and clean as most Berliner Weiss' but as a ""Berliner Style Weiss"" I cant really fault it. This isn't my favorite Berliner that I've had but its drinkable."
"Drinkable beer but not that great."
"D: Fine if you are considering it a summer thirst quencher, but not a good rendition of a great and nearly dead beer style. The citizens of Berlin only have one offering in a city that consumed over a million hl of it at the turn of the 19th to the 20th Centuries. A shame."
"D â€“ Very drinkable, I could drink 10 of these, especially considering the low ABV. But not my favorite of the style."
"I don't think I'll have this one again. I might have a few sips of someone else's if they bought a bottle, just to revisit the bizarre flavor of this brew, but other than that I wouldn't want to venture another glass."
"Drinkability is decent. A good starter into the Berliner Weiss style, but it ends up flat and without any distinct characteristics."
"D: This is a drinkable beer, best suited for a hot summer day. Worth a shot."
"11.2oz. bottle served in a standard pint glass. No freshness dating indicated. Poured a pale, honey-gold with a quarter inch, frothy, off-white head that quickly dispersed into a skim; clarity was a bit hazy - no lacing on this one. Mild nose - bready, yeast with some citrus in the blend. Taste consistent with nose, but also has a slight Heineken-skunk quality and a mild, lemony tartness. Mouthfeel is light-bodied and mildly effervescent, with a kiss of citrus astringency at the the finish. Ends fairly crisp and mostly clean, except for some residual breadiness. Only my second Berliner Weissbier, 1809 being my first, and I have to say that this beer doesn't hold a candle to it. Interesting, but I'm not loving this one, particularly at the $4.99 price tag."
"It has the color of a witbier. Washed out straw color, slightly hazy, and a tall bubbled head stand on top with good head retention. The aroma is ""sharp"". It's like smelling raspberries with a hint of cereals. Tastes like the aroma as well. Slightly tart raspberries are the dominant flavor, with a touch of wheat touching down on the palate and settling into the aftertaste. Make no mistake though, there is some sourness here. Lemon creeps into the overall picture. More flavor emerges as I go along. Very light bodied, but not watery. It's a very easy brew to knock down, but if you plan to knock down a few, be aware that it is expensive; $5.49 for a 330 ml bottle."
"Drinkability - If you don't mind a sour beer I think this is highly drinkable. Packs plenty of flavor for a low alcohol level beer. Certainly a new experience in beer for me. I'd been interested in trying a Berliner Weiss for some time and I would definitely recommend giving this a try."
"everything is improved (including lacing) with a dash of sugar and raspberry syrup. the score reflects that slightly."
"Drinkability? The taste was a let down on 2 counts: It never got to the level of the nose and the finish put me off and pretty much spoiled the session. Still, for a brew this low in abv, it wasn't as bad as you might infer from my comments and as always, I'm glad I got a chance to try it."
"D - Low ABV and not offensive. Easy to drink."
"Enjoyed with Velveeta Mac and Cheese for some reason, Worked well. A good beer that I would like to enjoy again. A good introduction to the style."
"A pretty good beer that definately favors the milder end of the style's spectrum. Very fruity and less challenging than most."
"Clean and drinkable, very refreshing. Highly recommended, especially for those unaccustomed to this unique, wonderful style. Cheers!"
"Overall a very well made berliner weisse. If not for mild flaws in the taste, this one would be top notch. Very traditionally made, and accurately so. The subtle tartness and mouthfeel are fantastic. This one really could be a very amazing beer if they can just get that damn wierd corny taste out of the middle. A good beer, but I'll grab 1809 over this one nearly every time."
"33cl bottle. Pours a hazy gold with a billowing white head that eventually recedes to leave a collar. Smells tart, with citrus character, as well as notes of damp hay and a bit of honey. Notes reminiscent of grappa. Tastes of lemon and grain. Some sourness, but not incredibly strong. The flavors are rather weak. Light body with heavy carbonation. Very crisp and refreshing; a great summer beer, but not a great berliner weisse."
"drinkability- I couldn't even finish the beer :( Also, such a low abv. Seems like it will be good for people who love lemons, but not suggested for most"
"very nice pour with a nice head that sits and eventually ends up a ring on the glass. light lace. color of light yellow murky. quite light, and not murky but cloudy even. smell is tart and a mild sweet. there is a light aspect of yogurt... and this carries over into the 'creamy' aspect of the body. mild sweet wheat malt, apricot, grass, predominant tart quality, apple, combining into a fruit acid and lactic acid that give the sour multiple dimensions."
"Excellent drinkability as the low alcohol, complex yet sessionable flavor, and soft mouthfeel make this an nice summer beer for beer geeks."
"The body is light but not as dry as would have liked. Some yeasty leaves a chalky off aftertaste in the finish. Overall, a decent berliner weisse but I suppose my US expectations expects a bit more acidic notes."
"Very interesting beer. I could easily drink a few of these."
"Pours a hazy, very pale yellow color. 1 inch head of a white color. Good retention and good lacing. Smells of wheat, sweet malt, sourness, and some slight fruit. Fits the style of a Berliner Weissbier. Mouth feel is slightly thick with high carbonation levels and high level of sourness. Very sour, almost burns the tongue - another first for me! Tastes sour first, then the sweet malt and wheat come through. The fruit and more sourness is in the finish. Wow, this is hard to describe - it's a mix between sour drop candy, lemonade, and a decent wheat beer. I agree that the sour level is too much and that I couldn't drink more than one. Since, this is the desired affect though, they nailed it as far as I can tell. Worth a try if just to sample the style."
"Mouthfeel is crisply but softly carbonated, very light bodied."
"D: Highly drinkable; for pure raw apple taste, this blows more apple flavor-oriented brews (like Unibroue Ephemere Apple) out of the water."
"D: a very good drinker, very easy to drink and have several as it is low in alcohol. even for a light beer it packs enough interesting flavor to make it a good choice."
"Overall, interesting, nice touch with the sourness, but not quite something I would get again. If they raised the abv and it had a smooth alcohol burn aftertaste I would probably get it again."
"Very light bodied with medium carbonation and a thin mouthfeel."
"Pours a slightly cloudy very pale straw color with about 2 fingers of pillowy white head. Aroma is very subdued, a bit of wheat, some lemon and a distinct, although not terribly potent, sourness. Overall it was a bit like white wine. Taste is just as subdued as the aroma. Initially there is a very dominant sourness but after the first sip the sourness lessens considerably. The sourness is the main flavor component here with and it builds into the finish. There is a soft wheat flavor that supports the sourness. There is no hop presence to speak of whatsoever and no is expected. No hop flavor, no hop bitterness. The sourness that was so strong initially returns after a few sips and is quite welcome. Mouthfeel is pretty good. Light body with moderate+ carbonation. Drinkability is quite good. The sourness is the dominant flavor but not too strong. Overall this is a very interesting brew that I really did enjoy and I'm glad that I was able to give it a try."
"7/4/8/4/14 (3.7/5)"
"Drinkability - I refuse to drink BWs with a flavoring syrup, dash of liquor, or a straw (especially a straw as it destroys the wonderful carbonation). Maybe it's because my family is Lebanese and I enjoy a pleasing, sour flavor, but I really enjoyed this bier as is."
"Brause-grundstoff"
"Notes from 6/6/08"
"Bottle thanks to Eric. Pours a cloudy yellow color with a small, almost no head. The aroma is fairly sweet; lots of honey and grains, and some light lemon notes. The flavor was much tarter; loads of lemon, acidic and citrus flavors. Some balance achieved by the sweet honey and malt flavors, lots of grains. Very interesting. Quite acidic but also very drinkable and smooth."
"This brew was very empty in flavor but I heard that Berliner Weisses were supposed to be the most ""refreshing"" beer on a hot day. I could see it."
"Drinkability- I said I would never try this style again, but now that I can handle sour beers I appreciate this style. Very crisp and drinkable."
"A most unusual beer and one I'm glad to have tried. Not sure I'd want to drink down very much of this, but it was certainly tolerable and interesting to sample. However, I felt like I needed a good dopple afterward to clean and refresh my palate."
"D: Not great scores, but this is a refreshing, quaffable little beer. As summer draws to an end, this is a perfect 'warm day' quencher. I've had better Berliners, still this deserves a try."
"D: Tasty, goes down very easily, not filling at all, very mild kick, good representation of style, this is a very mild beer to drink for a while if you're in the mood for the sourness and you want low ABV."
"This is quite drinkable - I do enjoy this style a great deal."
"Berliner Style Weisse pours an extremely pale yellow with a white head from a brown 11.2 ounce bottle. The aroma is a bit malty and very lemony and even a bit sour. The mouthfeel is light and pretty carbonated. The taste is very lemony, tart, sour and refreshing. Wow, this is what they should be selling instead of that chelada/wine cooler-like/shandy/malternative junk, this is the real deal as far as a light refreshing well made beer. I'm not sure it's really to style, it's not as intense as the other German Berliner Weisse I've tried, but I really like it."
"Carbonation is actually a little too low here, resulting in a less-than-optimal palate. Sticky and not very crisp for a style that's intended to be refreshing. Body is as thin as can be, making this quite drinkable."
"D - Wish I didn't give the other one away"
"Tasty and very refreshing. I would have liked a little bit more sourness, but that's just me."
"Drinkability: After a while, this beer grew on me and I enjoyed the light but complex flavors"
"Refreshing but not what I was hoping for or had anticipated."
"A huge head of bright white foam rises up as you pour it. Beneath, a hazy whitish-gold body releases delicate pin-point bubbles. The nose is a touch grainy, wheatish, yeasty, and even subtly sweet. It's subdued, as is the flavor. Again, it's got some grainy malt and yeast character, but it's also veiled in a thin tartness. It's far from mouth-puckering, and overall this is a very restrained version of the style. That, however, leaves it imminently drinkable and refreshing. With its low alcohol content and tartness it's almost like a lemon seltzer. Perfect for summer!"
"Edit: I must brew this.. the ultimate lawnmower beer... No need for Gatorade with this one.. No doubt an all day enjoyable brew... as long as its hot."
"D: Very light you could drink a ton but there are others in the style that are more suited for such."
"Notes: Got this one from dyan - thanks! I'm starting to really like this style of beer."
"I appreciate the fact that B.B.B. & G.G & Co. have created a kinder, gentler version of this classic style. It's much more enjoyable and infinitely more drinkable this way. Syrups? We don't need no stinkin' syrups."
"Poured at Pizza Port bottle shop into a snifter glass. Poured a pale clear straw color with a little white head. Smell is dominated by wheat , citrus, and a slight sour lactic scent. Taste is lemon citrus with a little sour flavor but not much and a semi dry finish. Very light body beer bodering on the lightness of water with a moderate to low carbonation. This is my second Berliner Weissbier and while not as good to me as the 1809 ( ilike the sourness and funk of that beer) its was very easy to drink and refreshing none the less, becoming one of my favorite style thats for sure."
"Poured into my cup and received a very light gold (could see through it clearly when held to light) body with minimal head that died quickly and left little lacings. A mild citrus smell with some hops and yeast in it. A sour taste, a little too sour for my liking. The sourness overrode the wheat coming and ruined some of the smoothness of the beer. There was no backbite to me because of the sourness when first hit on the tongue. Still, a somewhat flavorful brew that with some citrus and wheat that was noticeable and it did go down alright. At 3% I wouldn't session this though - too weak. Just not my style I guess."
"and mine is much more sour)"
"11.2oz bottle pours a pale and cloudy whitish yellow color with a thin fizzy white head The aroma is a bit sour with wheat and yeast and just a hint of citrus. The taste like the aroma is a bit tart with some wheat and yeast flavors. The mouthfeel is pretty light and thin with a moderate amount of carbonation. Overall, this is a decent brew that is worth a try. It is nothing special, but would be nice and refreshing and would be a pretty nice session brew on a hot day."
"Edit: I added the yeast after finishing about 3/4 of the beer. Doing so let the yeast some through in the nose, rounded the mouthfeel out, but also got rid of some of the nice, clean sourness. I'd recommend trying it both ways to see which you prefer."
"I have had other Berliners and this one is pretty true to form. Overall, a delicious sour-ed slightly wheaty beer."
"D: The unusually low alcohol in no way distracts or hinders from flavor or enjoyability as this is a prime example per style and goes down nicely from the smooth sourness."
"I really like this. It's very very drinkable, and at 3.0% I could down a 6'er of these way too easily on a summer day. I'd like to try one with syrup as is traditional with Berliner Weisse. I tried this one with and without the yeast, and while the difference is subtle, I prefer mine without. It tended to add a little bitterness."
"poured out a very light straw color, very foamy head. This beer is actually pretty nice to look at. Lemony on the nose, straw,yeast,this may sound funny, but I am a country boy and this beer smells just liked freshly shucked sweet corn. light yeast lacing now that beer is poured out. very tart lemony flavor. very light, nice aperitif. clean mouthfeel, I like it!"
"-Oelergud"
"Pours a slightly hazy pale straw color with a minimal white head. The smell is of wheat malt and lemony citrus. The taste is very light, kind of like lemon seltzer. A slight malt base to distinguish this beer from water. The feel is light and moderately fizzy, finishes very neutral almost water like. I'm not an expert on this style but knowing what it should be, I would have to say this doesn't hit the mark. It is barely tart or sour and adding any sweet syrup to this brew would make it grossly over balanced."
"Purchased: Plaza Liquors, Tucson AZ"
"The beer was moderately carbonated. A slight sweetness on the front palate that was follow by a refreshing tartness on the mid to back palate. Reminds me of pink grapefruit. Reminisent of a flemish sour or, in the wine world, a sauvignon blanc."
"D - This is a very good example -flavorful, low abv -3%! Very sessionable and refreshing. I could probably drink this often and not get bored. A slightly lighter version of the style than I am used to, but stands up just fine."
"Very light and easy to drink, however there are more unique Berliner Weisses out there..."
"If you like the style, you should give this a try. But if you want better versions, you should try Weihenstephaner's 1809 or the DFH Festiva Peche, both of which are fuller in body and character. Still, this one is nice and certainly refreshing. Great for a hot summer day like today. And at 3% ABV, it's something you can enjoy all afternoon."
"Ohhh! Based on another reviewer's comments, I tried adding some Woodruff, and I have to say the beer improves dramatically! Still not the best of the style by any stretch of the imagination, but I'd bump the taste up to a solid three with the woodruff."
"Easy to drink and very thrist quenching. This beer is at the light end of the spectrum for the style, but still maintains the most important characteristics. Definitely one to try for Berliner fans."
"This is the palest beer I've ever had I believe. Somewhere between clear and very pale golden. Very slightly hazy with an initial head that fades completely. The smell has faint lemon and grassiness. The taste is similar- very, very lightlemon and a hint of grassiness. The mouthfeel is crisp and soft and the body is very light. Somewhat drinkable, but so light and with a washed out citrus taste that is somewhat distracting. This is a nothing beer and dissappointingly soft for a Berliner Weisse- I like way more zing in the style. Don'teven think of adding syrup to this one- it would overwhelm what little flavor the beer has completely."
