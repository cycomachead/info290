"Schell, in Star of the North, probably makes my favorite Berliner Weiss that I have yet to come across. It's not the newfangled, sour 6%ers, but a traditional Berliner Style wheat with low alcohol, loads of flavor, and a brightness with no end. Buy this beer if you see it, it holds up very well."
""
"Sorry Schell's brewing but this beer is not good.  It's not my style. I realize this beer is made specifically to taste the way it does but I did not like it.  My poor rating won't hurt though because there is a pretty strong group that likes Star of the North.  It's the only offering from Schell's I haven't enjoyed so there's plenty of options for me."

"Overall. A well made Berliner with a really nice level of sour."
"Overall - Simple and well brewed. To style."
""
"O - Excellent, refreshing and easy to drink. I love this. Only 3.5% but it's got enough complexity where you can sip and enjoy. Great job here!"
""

"M: Lighter side of medium. Fairly high carbonation."
""

"D/O: Clean and traditional; quite refreshing. Although it seems a bit lifeless after it is allowed to sit, it is nice to see a domestic berlinerweisse executed by the numbers."
""
""
"Star of the North is a real treat. Only 3.5 percent ABV? Not to worry, this thing is packed with tangy, sweet, and sour flavors that work wonderfully together. Please make this again!"

"D - A very easy to drink Berliner that's pretty crushable. If this were available locally I'd buy it regularly. I dig the authenticity with the wood fermentation vessels and wild yeast, and there's tons of flavor here for a 3.5% beer. Hope Schell's makes this a regular."
""
"Star of the North pours a yellow color with a large white head that doesn't quit. There is a flowery pale aroma. The taste is fruity light and crisp, very tart, mellow fruity flavors. Good full flavors, great body. Overall its a very nice drinking light berliner Weissbier."
""
"I'm liking this lots. Good choice on Schell's part to put it in a large bottle at a high price. Not everyone's going to want to down this by the 12-pack. Hardly anyone, actually. And also cheers to them for actually brewing such a thing."

"One of the better American Berliner Weisse examples out there, hope they continue making this in the future."
""
"Overall: This is the best Berlinner Weiss that I have ever drank. Its a true bench mark of the beer style. Its a timeless beer, that I dont think that I could ever get tired of it. This is the first and only beer that August Shell has brewed that really impressed me. This is a go to beer for a hot summer day to quench your thirst better than water. I think that this beer has a niche similiar to a table beer because it will hold up well with any meal or food you could think of. This beer would be a staple in my fridge if I could get a few more bottles of it!"

"This is the best Berliner Weiss I've ever had. Beats out New Glarus' offering for sure. Its fuller bodied with much stronger flavours, with a puny 3.5% ABV hit. I strongly recommend this to anyone who likes the Berliner Weiss style."

""
""
"Overall: A really good take on the Berliner Weissbier style. Good fruity and acidic wine presence with an interesting kick from the Brett. Nicely done."
"Very solid Berliner Weisse, and extremely authentic for the style. One of the funkier ones out there, for sure. Wet blankets and bales of old hay, left and right, balanced by a great tartness that only imparts tingling levels of acidity in your throat. Mmm'mmm, good. The second time I had this with Doug, we mixed in some raspberries and simple syrup... I recommend this, as well."
""
""
"Overall: Berliner Weiss is an interesting style and Schell's is a very good example. Tart, lemony, with a dry finish. A nice change of pace in the summer to mix in among the pilsners, wheats, and pales."
"Ok this is my first review but when I opened the bottle and started to drink this beer I ran right away to see what this stuff was. I was very surprised to see how highly this was rated here. I am not a beer expert necessarily but I drink beer in the $10-$18 / 12 pack so I don't drink swill either. I expected this to be like other wheat beers I have had and enjoyed, namely a Paulaner Hefe or others that I have had. I do not want to be too harsh because this may very well be (and by the reviews I believe it is) exactly how this beer should look and taste, but I have to say this tastes similar to stomach bile to me, specifically the taste of regurgitating beer when having a few too many. So anyway this did not agree with my palette and I won't be buying it again. For those of you who like this I say awesome, and thanks for supporting my local brewer :)."

"As noted very refreshing and enjoyable. Well done. Now to do with with some syryp"
"Overall: Delicious and refreshing. An excellent beer."

"great sour that comes cork and caged by Schell's Brewing considering it's the first of it's kind by them. Overall great smell and tastes very light and crisp. Slight sour taste makes the beer very drinkable. I am looking forward to more like this from this brewery"

"Beautifully crafted beer, & I totally understand why people are digging it. Very good, bordering on excellent - doubtless one of the top 5 3.5% ABV brews in the Milky Way."

"A really nice berliner weisse. Has a great green mid-summer wheat feel, and the touch of sour makes it all the more refreshing."

"WOW!!!! Second Berliner Weisse i have ever tried and this was amazing!!!! Bready goodness with clean crisp lemony lactic acidity that fills the pallet. Slight funk but no horse leather funk that comes with brett fermented beers...very champagne like.... extrememly enjoyable...had with some improvised rasberry simple syrup and was superb with and without."

"Pours a beautiful hazy golden yellow with about an inch of pure white head. Medium retention with little lacing. Some bready malt sweetness on the nose, but mostly a lactic/citric tart aroma. Smells great. When you first drink there is some malt sweetness that is slightly bready and even slightly fruity, although I found it hard to nail this down. This was replaced very quickly though by a clean tartness that I found very well balanced and by no means over whelming. Thinking green apples and champagne. Nice dry finish. The tart lingers nicely and there is a touch of funk in the after taste that could be attributed to either the yeast or the old Cypress tanks the beer was aged in. The body is light and easy drinking although perhaps under carbonated. This beer is fantastic, both my wife and I loved it. A great summer beer. For a Schells product I was floored. Not that they are a bad brewery, but this is far above the bar for them. I am headed back to the bottle shop for a few more of these."

"Kudos to Jace Marti and crew at Schell's in New Ulm, Minnesota!"

"O= This is the best beer I've had in a while and the best Berliner I've had to date. I really don't know if this beer could be any better. A perfect summer beer and a perfect Berliner in my opinion. I don't even like too many Schell's beers. They are usually a one and done company for me. I buy things to try their new beers and then never really try it again. This beer was different. A day after trying it I bought all of it I could find. Try this beer and buy a lot. They need to keep this one."
""
"Overall: Nice to finally have a more authentic example of the style, as Bell's Oarsman and Dogfish Head Festina Pecha hardly count, and the only German one I had was heavy up on Brett (which was very good). But this is just fantastic, refreshingly tart and ridiculously drinkable. I am excited to see where Schell takes this new Noble Star series, as it essentially give them a line of Sours, albeit German-style."
""
"sours and this is a great switch up from the, now familiar, Belgian varieties. What I love even more is how Schells, a brewery that recently failed the ""craft brewery"" label test, is putting this out. They brew wonderful representations of German styles, and never try to be anything they're not (they don't even brew a pale ale, let alone an IPA). I am proud to have these guys in MN. Highly recommended to anyone who can find it, and this definitely worth trading for if you can't. Cheers!"

"Light bodied with modest carbonation. Has a tart lemon aftertaste, and finishes dry. this is a very nice Berliner Weissbier. I could drink this all the time, not just in summer."

"O- Very impressed with this beer. Very easy to drink, refreshing, love the tart lemon characteristics. Very well made Berliner, but again i have not had to many berliners to compare it to. Im a Fan."
"Overall: a wonderful beer and if more people drank it, it could turn them on to the style. I love finding refreshing and crisp beers that are full flavored and sessionable. Can have a few and not stumble around. Well done Schell's."
"Overall, this beer is spot on. I know I am not a b-weisse expert, but this tastes very German and authentic. I am a big fan of this. It is so easy to drink and provides way more flavor than you would expect from a 3.5% beer. A must try."
""
"Easily my favorite Berliner to date."
"Schells- Keep it crafty down there in New Ulm."
"O-tasty and drinkable on a hot summer day love this style with not alot of offerings on the shelf"
"Happy that Schell's did a proper Berliner Weissbier instead of the half-hearted attempts by most other brewers. I am definitely going to pick up another bottle and let it sit for a year or two as I think this will develop into a real fascinating beer."
""
"Overall: Perfectly balanced. Fresh and clean with just enough bread, cracker, and sour apple to make it interesting. Seems like a good pairing would be any cheese with penicillin, a good crisp pale cracker, and a slice of granny smith or mulberries."
