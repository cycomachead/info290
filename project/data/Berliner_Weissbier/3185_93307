3.55,-9,3.25,3.75,3.5,3.5,3.5,"This is a lip-puckering, wheaty beer. Plenty of yeast to it. Powerful lemony touch to the start of the taste. No sweetness to cut the tart bite. Higher body but it is also higher in carbonation. Long aftertaste that reminds of sucking a lemon.","smcolw","Jul 22, 2014"

3.73,-4.4,3.75,3.75,3.75,3.5,3.75,"Muddy yellow/beige with a skim and collar of fine whitish bubbles. Sour nose, a bit of wheat and fruitiness, slight husky or grainy character. Acid cuts all the way through the flavour, start to finish. Notes of tart fruit, grains, wheat throughout. Lingering sourness and a bit of saltiness. Light bodied with moderate to high carbonation, a bit coarse. Refreshing, but a bit rough on the palate.","DrJay","Jun 15, 2014"
4.02,3.1,4,3.75,4.25,3.75,4,"Intergalactic Acid may not be one of the more intense Berliner Weiss-style beers on the market, but it was tasty and quite refreshing nevertheless. Available for under $4 a bottle, I can definitely see this becoming a summer staple.","Damian","Jun 14, 2014"

3.95,1.3,3.5,4,4,3.75,4,"Overall not bad, nice sourness, tart lemon and fruit, lactic acid, crackery wheat, very refreshing.","jlindros","Jun 01, 2014"
2.63,-32.6,3,2.5,2.5,3,2.75,"Pour is a cloudy pale yellow with a deep colored head and a fairly tight white head. Nose has some nice grain up front but a lot of muddled wheat, heavy lacto cream and notes of lemon. Taste has a lot of muddled wheat up front, heavy lactic acid, some acetic acid, hints of lemon mid to late palate but a huge sulfur flavor takes over and lingers through the finish. Body is a bit fuller than I'd presser with strong carbonation and a puckering finish.","cpetrone84","May 26, 2014"

3.93,0.8,2.75,4,4,4,4,"Milky yellow with a brown tint in color when poured, opaque, with a one finger head that dissipates rather quickly. I did not find the appearance appealing, in my opinion. The smell however was very appealing; sweet, citrus scent with lemon being prominent, tart, and somewhat wheaty. The taste matched up well with the aroma; tart, lemony, wheat and smooth. Very refreshing at the end of a warm spring day. Light to medium body with nice light carbonation. Overall I really enjoyed this beer. It is a great summer beer, as it has a refreshing quality. It will be picking up some more for sure.","sprat1960","May 22, 2014"

3.74,-4.1,4,3.75,3.75,3.5,3.75,"The beer pours a milky, pale yellow with a small sized head of eggshell white bubbles. In body, the beer is cloudy and opaque, leaving nothing of the other side of the glass to be seen. On the nose, the beer smells of soggy wheat flakes, light lemons, thick yogurt, and a pool. On the tongue, the beer tastes of a middling tart bight and then a bready sweet finish. In flavor, the beer begins as tart lemon, moving into lemon yogurt, then chlorine, and then a nice bready finish of wheat flakes and very soft lemon. In the mouth, the beer feels light in body with a strong carbonation, yet a slightly smooth, yet crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a nice little Berliner weisse with some good wheat malt and yogurt flavors. Itâ€™s neither the tartest nor the tamest, but the chlorine flavors do effect the experience a little. I like the yogurt flavor, but I like this one more mit schuss. A decent Berliner weisse.","Maxwell","May 05, 2014"
