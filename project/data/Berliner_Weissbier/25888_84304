3.91,3.2,3.25,4,4,3.5,4,"The beer pours very cloudy, was a little turbid but not in a bad way. I felt like it was more like that and it had a kind of creamy/heavy mouth feel because they used real peaches in the brew so there was pulp in it. Smelled like peaches (surprise). It was more sour than any other berliner weisse I've ever had and it lacked a funkyness characteristic that i get when I drink 1809 so I don't know if I would really call this a Berliner but I would compare it more to Pizza Boy Peach Funker which is an American Wild because of the sourness and mouth feel. If you see this it is definitely worth a try, not the best peach sour I've had but it is a solid beer.","caffeineTX","Feb 27, 2015"

The tart lacto was much more subdued than is normal for the style. The buttered popcorn and candied peach really complemented each other nicely I thought.

4,5.5,,,,,,"Hazy golden orange body pours into a chalice with great effervescent head, fine speckled bubbles left behind as it settles down a bit.  Aroma has pungent acidity, chalky yeast notes, and earthy peach pits with a bit of flesh evident of actual fruit.  Flavor just think very tart and refreshing peach tea tannin notes with peach pit notes and dry acidity lactic fruit yogurt (maybe a Chobani).  Dries the palate from every direction, I popped some Nexium earlier and I'm glad that I did.  Effervescent well done carbonation levels carries this lively tart lower abv ale across my palate nicely, light to medium bodied with a bone dry finish.  Overall impressed with the use of fruit so subtle where they used loads of real peaches in a classic German berliner weisse.","WVbeergeek","Nov 09, 2014"

Color is what you would expect; blonde, hazy pinkish hues just like a ripe peach. Smells like a ripe peach too, no guessing here this beer is what it claims to be. First sip is undeniable refreshing, fresh peaches, medium low sourness, sweetness from the peaches, soft and drinkable. Great beer, not a lot of depth but I could drink this all night long on a warm summer evening .","WildSoul8","Oct 12, 2014"

And might I say this Berliner started out like a sour mess so I put it away. Trying it again I thought its pretty tasty and came to a conclusion that this style cannot be mixed with others or at least drink this first IMO. I appreciate the effort of hundreds of pounds of Michigan peaches added to this. But to be fair I really didn't get a lot of peach. Anyway, tasty nonetheless.","joeseppy","Apr 22, 2014"

3.79,0,4,3.75,3.75,4,3.75,"yet another Berliner that is slightly off the authenticity track, but tastes darn good. on tap at hops and pie right now, this beer reminds me more of festina peche from dogfish than the true berliners. hazy pale yellow color, soda bubbles, sweet and fruity nose with plenty of yeast to balance the sweet. more funk than tart or sour, but a clean, low acid feel to it. the flavor features prominent peach, fresh and ripe, a nice use of the fruit. wheat malt is in abundance, and there is a tartness, but its subtle, and its after the swallow. I like the lightness and brightness of this, the feel really works. aggressive carbonation cuts the sweet of the fruit and aids the funky finish, but I expect quite a bit more lactic tartness is my Berliner Weiss than this. still, another fun and tasty brew from perennial, who seems to be really exploding into the Colorado market lately. good for them, good for us.","StonedTrippin","Dec 11, 2013"

It pours a lightly hazy wan straw topped by a finger of off-white foam. The nose comprises light white grape, cinnamon, and light wheat. The taste holds notes of light peach, white grape, lemon juice, and light wheat. Not really much tartness at all, which is a decent disappointment considering the style in question. The body straddles the line between discord and rhy--I mean, heavy light and light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a sorta/kinda dry finish. Overall, this is a mediocre Berliner, with little-to-no tartness and the same amount of peach, really.
