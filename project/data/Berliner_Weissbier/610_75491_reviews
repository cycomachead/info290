"I'm a fan of sours and this beer is SOUR.  Very lemony, light, and drinkable at 4.0., this beer really delivers.  A perfect summer sipper."

"Overall this is a very sour Berliner weisse.  For fans of puckering sour beers only, for this is one of the most intense I've had."

"Overall: berliner weissbiers I usually think of as a gateway to sour beers, this one is easy an exception. it is intensely sour. but the flavors are so strong and complex. This is a must have for all who like sour beers and the style."

"Pours an extremely pale straw color with no head, but still appropriately carbonated. The aroma is very tart smelling- nice lactic aroma, lemony and tangy. Delicious beer! Very lactic and tangy with lemon and yogurt flavors. Creamy and tart in the mouth with good carbonation. Excellent beer!"
"Hazy pale straw topped with a minimal, wispy white head that vanishes, leaving the beer looking rather still. Smells like big-time acetic, lactic lemon. Flavor is sour...like, Warheads sour. Lactic, acidic, crisp lemon juice tartness that obscures whatever other flavors might be trying to poke through. Don't get me wrong, this was fun to try, I enjoyed it like I do overly spicy food; it's just one great big sour kick in the teeth without any grainy wheat for depth. Light, crisp, puckering. Too intensely acidic and one dimensional for the style and I can't imagine drinking more than maybe 10 oz. Expensive too, which in addition to the crushing sourness makes the whole thing seem more of a novelty than a truly sessionable Berliner."

"Had a 10 oz. pour with dinner. Mouth feel was sharp, and tart. Light hazy yellow color with no head or lacing. The flavors were of lemon and straw, very dry, there is no malt in the flavor at all. It is all about the tartness. Like a very dry wine. went well with my pork loin with a cherry sauce. A classic German sour."

"WOW! Was like drinking liquid lemon heads in a good way. Smelled extremely tart and lemony and tasted the same. Extremely mouth puckeringly tart with very powerful acidic and sweet lemon favors. Just how I like my Berliners - overly tart! One draft of this is enough for but boy was it good. Wave after wave of tart acidic candied lemons but was still refreshing. Would love to have again"

"one of the sourest, most acidic beers ive ever had. a 10 ounce pour of this was close to way too much for me. as a sour beer, or as something different, i like it a lot, but as a berliner, its terrible. berliners are tart session what beers, there is nothing sessionable about this beer from bear republic. its blonde and sour as the come, clear and with a little body. the head is soapy white, and an inch tall, but its dead in just seconds and the beer appears still at that point. the nose on it is caustic lactic acidity and wheat malt, simple but enormously sour. the flavor is the same, extremely one dimensional, and that dimension is sourness. i have no doubt that this will score highly with sour lovers, and i like it in that context, but its an over the top berliner for me, and was hard to get through frankly. a medium body too seems big, but its slippery on the palate, prickly and stinging from the acidity, like sucking on a lemon wedge times ten. at 8 or 9 bucks a pour down at hops and pie, once was enough for me, it hurt my stomach and sent it somersaulting for hours. i appreciate it, respect it, and am glad to have tried it, but its just too much."
""
"On tap at Hops and Pie. Bright yellow color, mostly clear, hardly any head whatsoever. Aroma is indicative that this will be tart, vinegar, and I could almost swear a note of tartar sauce but that could be the power of suggestion. The flavor is extremely sour, lemons and vinegar. It didn't taste bad but I have never had a berliner that was this sour, most of the berliner weisse beers I have tasted are only mildly tart. If you are looking for a palate crushing sour than look no further but I felt this deviated a little too far from the style."
"O: to me, this hits on all that I expect and want from the style. Being a relatively newer style to me, my palate might evolve, but for now, this gets a high rating."

"O - this is spot on for the type. Bear republic nailed it."

"O-I have somewhat mixed feelings on this beer. On the one hand, I feel like this is the type of sour, lemon bomb that is overdone and scouring in its highly citric, lemony, acidic glory. On the other hand, this beer needs no elderberry syrup because it packs plenty of flavor on its own. A no holds barred Berliner...I guess I'm OK with that."

"Overall: I wasn't expecting a beer like this from Bear Republic but they nailed the style with this brew"
""
"Verdict: A delicious Berliner Weissbier and one of the best examples of the style to be made in America. This has long been the benchmark of the style, and it's deserved. One of the more refreshing but more importantly, delicate examples available."

"Overall, an excellent sour offering from Bear Republic. I had Cuvee de Bubba once and it was a bit disappointing, this one however was quite good. Reminds me of Love from New Belgium, and strikes me as more of a Wild Ale instead of a Berliner."

"The pour is nothing to look at,,,super yellow - almost looks like lemonade. Smell is super tart and lots of sourness...awesome. Lemony, grainy, and a bit of ever so salty flavor...tart finish with a huge sourness...unlike any Berliner Weiss ive had. This is way more tart and sour than most...but simply awesome. Probably the best BW ive ever had...I hope to have this again one day."

"A clear straw yellow with a white head that collapses quickly. Juxtaposed with the cantillon iris grand cru , the wheat in this beer is really pronounced. Plenty sour, sharp, lactic with some acetic notes as well, this is cidery, fruity (white grapes) a little husky and yummy. The palate opens very sour with a little bit of solvent and nail polish remover, harshly so. Unripe grapes, some wheat and raw lemons round out the palate. Drying sour and with some oak on the finish,  this is a little disappointing, the antithesis of what a berlinerweisse should be."
""
"O: A great beer, and an excellent example of the style. Recommended, but be warned: It is *sour*."
""
""
""
"Tartare is a very unique take on an already interesting style of beer. Given its low ABV, I feel like I could drink gallons of this on a hot day. I really hope Bear Republic decides to bottle this sometime soon."
""
""
""
"Light, crisp, refreshing... Like watching Lily Aldridge using a loofa, Raul can get used to this."
"I am not a huge fan of sour ales or this style at all but this was one of the better beers, not just of this style but of all styles, that I have had. Poured a cloudy yellow with one-finger head and minimal lace on top of an aroma that is mostly sour and tart with touches of sharp, spicy citric. Smooth, light-bodied, easy to drink, tastes like the smell with an extremely sour, puckering, citrusy vibe with some funk and tartness (can't really put my finger on the exact tastes). Finishes real crisp and dry and don't know if I could session this as the sourness could wear but definitely a must try to have at least one."

"If you are lucky enough to come across this, get it and savor it."

"The aroma was properly tart, with a nice wheat base. Same on the tongue, the expected mix grain and sourness, with any particular aspects that made it stand out. The body was on the light side, but still had a subtle substance, and a dry finish. Drinkability was very good, I could have a couple of these on a summer's day, except for the unrealistic price. Overall, a very good and enjoyable brew, and one that's worth a shot, if you can stomach the price."
""
""
""
"O: Excellent interpretation of a base berliner. This one has some serious tartness. This is probably the most enjoyable non-fruited berliner I've ever had, and this is coming from someone with access to Cigar City, Peg's and Wakefield's stuff. Excellent, and highly recommended. I must get more..."
""
""
"Delivered on tap at Pi Bar, San Francisco CA. The beer appears a light yellow to pear color with little to no head whatsoever. No hoppy aroma but upon further sniffing one can get a slight tinge of the sourness. Upon sipping an instantly and somewhat overwhelmingly sour flavor hits the palate, but in an appreciable and exciting way. Low alcohol flavor and invites you to drink bigger sips. Wonderful delicate mouth feel provides contrast to the strong sour flavor. Good to see Bear Republic really trying to make something special and I wholeheartedly approve."
"O. 4.5"

"Couple of thoughts and observations. I'm not a huge sour fan, but I've enjoyed the German versions of this style, because the sour component generally doesn't smack you over the head. This clearly does. I guess this beer is remarkable for the level of flavor you get in a 4% beer, but I just wish there was a bit more to this beer than sour, sour, sour... The couple next to me at BS were drinking a flight of left over sour beers from puckerfest, and I was surprised they hadn't gotten a sample glass of the tartare. The guy told me that he was a huge sour fan, while his wife (GF?) said she was a fan, but not to the extent her husband was. So I happily gave them my glass. The woman indicated that the beer was too sour for her, while the gentleman indicated that he enjoyed it, but that it was on the boundary of just how much sour he could tolerate. Don't believe I'll be ordering this one again."

"A very good Berliner Weissbier that I would definitely try again."

"Color of pale straw, and cloudy--almost looks like fresh farm stand lemonade. Smells lactic, with light hints of peach and citrus. Lots of lacto up front at first taste, with notes of apricot and lemon peel. Little to no wheatiness. Good mouthfeel, but no lacing on the glass whatsoever. Finishes very clean."
""
""
""
""
"12oz pour - unbranded tulip - slightly clouded straw-yellow beer with a nice fluffy white cap. Aroma is overwhelmingly tart - grassy, lemon rind, sugar. I'm somewhat of a novice in the style, but this was pretty staggering. Easily one of the tartest beers I've ever consumed - sugars, lemon, wheat, lactic. Pretty intense stuff, and from the looks of it, A WHALE"

"O: An amazing Berliner, probably the best I have had. Great sour/tartness for style with plenty of fruit flavor."
""
""
"Not sure why this is a Berliner weiss. Scored as that, it would be much lower since it's too tart and oaky with not nearly enough grainy wheat that is standard for the style. As an American Wild, it is sublime and one of the best ones I've had so I've scored it as such. If you want a great American Wild try this beer. If you want a traditional Berliner look elsewhere though."
""
""
"[O] Berliner traditionalists would probably cringe upon trying this brew but I quite enjoyed it for the enamel and esophagus eating qualities that I experienced."
"Huge thanks to yourefragile for sharing this growler. Served in a cervoise. The nose is fairly tart with a bit of wheat in the background, but mostly sourness and light stone fruits. Flavor is similar. It's quite tart, and unfortunately doesn't have much dry wheat character like a great Berliner. Instead, it's more of an American Wild, though a good one at that."
""
""
""
""
"O: This beer is light and refreshing, but takes a long time to sip given the heavy amount of sourness."
""
""
""
""
"This poured out as a muddy looking yellow color, there was no head retention on this or lacing at all. The smell of the beer was obviously sour it's got a potent amount of tart aromas coming off of this one. The taste is also very tart/sour it reminded me of limes or lemons almost. It over powers the malt base entirely in my opinion. The mouthfeel of the beer is light, a little watery, it's refreshing and dry all at the same time. Overall it's not something I would drink a lot of but it was nice to try."
"Tartare pours a burnt gold yellow, and is totally opaque thanks to the wheat. The glass arrives without a bit of head on it. The nose has a sharp citric acidity to it, with just a little bit of grainy wheat appreciable as well. The flavor follows through on that blueprint. The beer is highlighted by a bright lemon tartness, which is just kept in balance by the flavor of the wheat. There's a little bit of a body contribution from the wheat, and it's the only thing that keeps the beer from coming across as watery, meaning the beer is perfectly light bodied. The effervescent carbonation lends credence to the style's nickname of ""the champagne of the north"". Berliner Weiss is a hit and miss style for me, but Tartare is probably the best of the bunch that I've had."
""
""
""
"Very pale straw color in the glass, nearly a pastel shade it was somewhat hazy and glowed when held to the light. Thin layer of white foam on the surface that stuck around for the first couple sips. Aroma had a whiff of sulfur at first, but this blew off fairly quickly, revealing sour lemon, sharp lacto, and faint supporting notes of grainy wheat in the background. Extremely tart, more of an explosive sourness that builds quickly and vanishes just as fast. Very crisp and clean, puckering lemon and dry like champagne in the finish. A well crafted Berliner Weisse, much more sour than most. Extremely drinkable and refreshing, the low abv was welcome and it certainly stood out as a memorable beer early on, preceeding a night full of booze monsters."
""
""
""
"Beer is very sour, almost one note sour, very lactic, mildly succinic, an interesting and grainy bitterness on the finish. A nice berliner for sure. I do enjoy it and glad I got to try it."
""
""
""
"While perhaps not the most authentic, this is probably the best and most memorable example of the style I've tried to date. Seek this one out."
"Served in a tulip glass, a dull and slightly hazy yellow-pineapple-juice color with no head other than a thin ringlet of bubbles that fizzled out in a couple minutes. Tart and lactic in the nose, funky and slightly floral. This is reflected in the taste: quite tart and puckering at first, lemon and grapefruit, citric and lactic acid, not so much acetic, though there was a slight vinegary presence in there, secondary flavors of biscuity malts, white grapes and grassy funk, but the sourness/tartness was clearly in charge here. Medium body, quite good for the style. Definitely a tasty brew worth revisiting."
""
""
""
"Highly acetic, just how I like my sours. Tartare may be too intense for some, but I would happily drink this all day long given the chance. Fantastic execution of the style. PLEASE bottle this!"
""
"O- I know this is a berliner weiss, and I've only ever had one other by comparison, this beer probably doesn't fit the standard mold but who cares. Rating to style would take away from how great this beer is. So I am rating based on my experience which was outstanding. Maybe my favorite beer of the day."
""
"O - This is, hands down, the best berliner I've ever had. The previous record holder was Funky Buddha's Passionfruit, and this one beats it handily. I didn't know this one was barrel aged, but after reading the description, I can totally see how the chardonnay barrel helped this one out. Would love to have again. Relative to other beers in the style, I couldn't give this beer anything but a 5."
""
""
""
"Pours like a beautiful, cloudy Pinot Grigio with a moderate head. Smells of lemon juice dominate the nose. Taste... an absolute sour bomb. This sourness of this beer rivals, if not exceeds, the most sour of gueuzes and will satisfy those who seek that kind of experience. However, to me it's too sour for the style: like drinking apple cider vinegar cut with Perrier. Still, it had a wonderful mouthfeel like a stellar Berliner Weiss should. In small doses, this is an excellent experience. As for a full glass... maybe a little too much."

"This is a light bodied brew with a light amount of carbonation. It very tangy and sour for a berliner which cuts back quite a bit on its overall drinkability. Fans of sours will absolutely love this brew. I surprisingly did not enjoy this as much as I thought I would. This is really a take on the style that exceeds the upper limits of how tart a berliner should be. It is worth trying but I cant see myself drinking more than a glass of this at a time. If the style was changed to american wild, id increase my rating across the board but for a berliner this one is brutal. This is a very rare occurance where adding woodruff would have appealed to me."
""
"O- Tartare is a fantastic representation of the berliner Weiss style, and easily one of the better ones I've had. Not for the faint of heart due to the fairly sharp acidity, but a must try for any fan of the style."
""
""
""
""
"A very good version of the style, with some measured creativity on display from the exposure to wood."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall quite nice, good tartness, fruit and citrus, acidity, lighter on the funk and bready mts though. Nice oak too."
"O - Overall this was a very nice representation of the style. Super sour and creamy this really shines in many levels."
"O: Very enjoyable but only for someone that truly appreciates the style or sour beers - this is probably the most sour beer that I have had in the style. Not super easy to drink but a nice beer to sip on over the course of an hour or two."
"Poured from draft into a 9 oz snifter. Pours a Mountain Dew'esque shade with minimal head and zero lacing. Nose is fairly subdued, but a powerwhiff reveals the heart of this beast. Lactic sour madness. The taste is akin to liquid sour. Like...if sour were an extract. The mouth is thin with a further tart finish. Solid beer."
""
""
""
""
"o - Overall I thought this was an outstanding berliner; I'm struggling to think of one I liked much better than this. I had never heard of it and assumed it was a new BR hoppy beer and was pleasantly surprised to look it up and see it was a berliner, and even more pleasantly surprised to see it actually live up to the reviews and score. Tons of sour fruit and lemon, with some funk in the taste too. Would love to have this one again."
""
""
"I don't know if this is deserving of being the #1 ranked berliner. That being said, this is different than any other beer I've had from the style. Super tart and juicy and very refreshing. Surely worth trying."
""
"Great stuff!"
""
"Tartare looks real pretty in the glass. Right off the tap there is no bubbles to be seen at all, it's all liquid. A bright gold color with some yellow surroundings. Some swirls bring the faintest amount of trying to survive bubbles that die. No stick. Smell on this sucka is wonderful. I get some nice wheat base with some lactic quality. Some pear, apple, white wine characteristics. Some tart lemon spritz in here as well. Integrated and bold nose, wonderful to get into. Tartare is one of the more tart forward berliners out there, this is eye opening. Lemon, apple, lacto, wheat, pale malt, white wine, sour patch kids. Flavors are well integrated, body is light, lactic sourness, very lightly carbed, hardly at all. While the flavor was intene and mind blowing to say the least, it took me some time to clear my glass, the pucker is a bit overbearing, but oh so awesome."
""
"This is easily the best, most in your face tart Berliner I have experienced. A winner in all aspects."
""
""
"This pours a hazy, cloudy golden color with tight bubbles atop it. Big, tart aroma. Grapefruit juice, freshly squeezed, and just-juiced lemon. The kind that will sting your eyes when you first take a bite. The flavor has a light and delicate tartness—more tart than bitter, but it seems like there’s some bitterness midpoint—and a dry, crisp finish. Good one. I’d like to see this in bottles."
""
"T: I'm quickly falling in love with this style and this is by far the best I've had. Lemon Warhead sour upfront with a ton of lactic sourness. Tastes like biting into a lemon. Some light wheat on the finish. Amazing stuff!"
""
"Pours a nice golden yellow, frothy white foam atop and much higher clarity than I had anticipated. Nose is lacto, grain, hints of soil and hay, a bit of lemon and green grape skins. Flavor packs a punch! Nice and sour with lemon and citrisy acidity. Nice and refreshing with crispy carbonation and a thin body - off dry finish that quickly makes me salivate. This one is probably the best american version I've had to date - really fine job."
"So excited to see this on tap at this year's Bluesapalooza festival! And not too many people knew they were tapping it, so I got to have like 6 tasters of it. I loved it! Appearance was a straw-like lemonade yellow color with a large, fluffy white head. Scent is very-wheat forward with a ton of funky sour aromas going on. Picking up a lot of lacto and acidic aromas. A lot of lemon as well. Taste is WOW... way more sour than I was expecting. Definitely the most sour berliner I've ever had. Sour lemon flavors with white wine vinegar and sour white grapes. A lot of wheat and funky lacto acidic flavors. Puckering. Mouthfeel was very light, puckering, and refreshing. Drinkability was very high. Overall, my favorite beer of the night. So much sour with such high drinkability. My gums did feel like they were ruined after my 6 taster glasses though."
"Overall - Excellent unfruited Berliner. I'm spoiled in Florida, but this is quite good."
""
""
"Drinkability is pretty good, if your a sour head. This thing packs a ton of pucker. Actually to much for me to really have more than another."
""
"O: A highlight of the event. Sitting under a tree, listening to the fake stream flow past in the garden. Very nice indeed."
""
""
"Cloudy but bright golden yellow, bubbly and prickly white head, decent retention and some sticky lacing. Scent hits me across the face with tart lactic sourness, beneath lies notes of earth, grain and watery fruit. Taste brings huge tartness as nose promised. It has some good earthy, grainy and fruit charachter, but its really all about the tartness and funk. Big, bold and bright, aggressive yet refreshing, dry yet quenching. In my quest to drink as many Berliner Weiss' as i can this summer, i've had one that range from lightly tart and graininy, to this big, bold tart and sour one. Fantastic."
"Please for the love of God, bottle this beer!"
""
"Pours a slightly hazy light yellow with a foamy off-white head that settles to an oily film on top of the beer. No lacing on this one. Smell is super sour, tart, and funky with some lemon and lactic acid aromas. Taste is the same with a fantastic mouth watering flavor and an acidic finish. This beer has a high level of carbonation with a crisp and prickly mouthfeel. Overall, this is an awesome and refreshing beer and by far the best beer in the style that I have tried so far in my beer tasting journey."
"O - This is a fantastic beer. The best Berliner Weisse that I have been able to try. I will definitely order this again if I see it."
"This is on the level. Tart and mildly lactic (and thankfully not too much so). Has that sticky kind of thick feel to it that fits to what I've experienced of the style in the past. If you've never had this type of beer before, you may not be prepared for it. Though if you've had legitimate lambics and gueuzes, you'll probably be okay. Regardless. This is an intense beer that does not cut corners. A pleasure to be able to try this one."
""
""
""
"Light body with some decent zesty carbonation makes this very refreshing. What a surprisingly excellent sour beer from Bear Republic."
""
""
"Pours a bright hazy straw golden with a a few fingers of white, creamy head. Fades a to collar with spots of lacing. Grainy, bready nose blends with lacto sourness and mild citrus. Light earth and floral notes in the finish. Light, effervescent refreshing body with prickly carbonation. Flavor is dominated by a sour and tart lemon acidity with a strong sourdough bread presence mid palate. Lemon sourness builds through the finish with light floral notes occasionally emerging. Oak dries out the surprisingly clean finish. Damn Bear Republic, this was a surprise."
"I can't believe I have never had this style before, and I love sours. Such a great beer and style; I hope more American breweries start pumping out berliner weissebiers."
""
""
""
""
"Tart, puckering mouthfeel with a decent amount of sour acidity that lingers over the sweet citrus and bready yeast into a lingering acetic, vinegary finish.  Kind of like a sour kvass with lots of bread, citrus acidity and funk."
"Well this was certainly interesting. It’s hard to take this one as a straight up Berliner Weiss experience, as the barrel and funkiness definitely took this to an another place. Still, I’m glad to say that I’ve tried it. It’s a wood-aged Berliner Weiss for CRYING OUT LOUD!"
" The taste is like tart lemon juice with the rind ground up and thrown in for extra astringency w/out any sweet flavors to balance -kind of funky with subtle carbonation level and very dry bitter taste with tannic presence and not really any wheat I can gather. Simply sour and acidic with citrus bite and mildly acetic taste with earthy jolt of sour and light nutty finish of wood. Overall not the most drinkable of the style and just sour taste after sour flavor with the bile like bite which I found to be just a bit harsh on the palate. I could not see having more than one which is not what I like from a Berliner."
""
""
""
"The pour is a pale straw hue with a short lived white head. An excellent tartness to the aroma. Very sharp lactic acidity to go along with plenty of wheat. A little bit of lemon peel and maybe some popcorn. The flavor is similarly enjoyable. Great lemon peel and lemon juice tartness with an undertone of sweetness from the wheat. Light bodied with medium carbonation. Very well done beer."
""
""
""
"O: Pretty outstanding!"
""
"Overall. Blown away by this one. Nice and sour, unlike some berliner weisse's I've had before. Even at $8 for 10oz, I had to have a second glass. Wishing I had bought a growler!!"
"Wow, a nice sour from Bear Republic for a change. On tap at Toronado. Hazy straw hued body with a thin head that doesn't provide much stickage. Great lacto and grain aroma, a bit sourdough-like. Little funkiness, too. Bright, sharp, acidic palate, pretty citrusy with a pleasant lacto profile that's extremely refreshing. Touch of pineapple, grain, not much oak or barrel to speak of. Brief, thirst quenching finish. Drank a few of these and could have had more, low ABV with a ton of flavor. Drank this side by side with Cable Car 2010 and found this better."
""
""
""
""
"finishes bright and dry with lingering tart."
""
"Overall: A very good Berliner Weiss. Don't pass this up if you enjoy the style."
"O: Very tart but great flavor. Super lemon flavor and clean. Thanks again for bringing the growler Mike!"
""
""
""
""
""
"I've gotta hand it to Bear Republic...they usually win me over with their hoppy beers (e.g., Racer X, Mach 10), but this beer takes the cake. Tartness hits the tongue and refuses to let go, but at the same time it doesn't overwhelm the palate with sour acidity. Lemon, sourdough, and vinous funk are equally in effect. Mouthfeel is ultimately crisp and well-carbonated. The 4% is perhaps the crowned jewel of this beer...so flavorful, yet entirely sessionable all the while. Highly recommended."
""
""
""
"O: A really good and impressive Berliner Weisse. Maybe not completely to style, but this was one good beer."
"Bear Republic is a very good brewery, though it is not known for sour ales, so it was a great surprise to everybody that this came out of Headlesburg. This is a beer that should turn some heads."
""
""
"Awesome beer! I had this on draft today at the pub and it blew me away. Unfortunately so did a couple of their other beers and I opted for a different growler. I regretted not getting this one the minute I left. I can only hope I will be able to try it again."
"O - Super drinkable and nice and complex. Lots going on with this beer and I went back for a couple servings. Well made berliner that I would drink often."
