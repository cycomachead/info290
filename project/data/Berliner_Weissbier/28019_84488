Having tried other SARA beers this is definitely one of the bottom beers they have to offer. Nice lemon zest flavor and crisp but, just not enough mouth feel or other flavors come through","Raziel313","Jan 10, 2015"

Still fairly dusty up front with notes of grains.  Lighter body, a bit slick mid palate, strong carb.","cpetrone84","0"

It's clean, light, drying, and very drinkable, so it's a fine example of its style. That said, New Glarus just does it better as far as I am concerned, and they do it for 1/4 the price and in a much more accessible way. I'm glad I got to try this, but would not go out of my way to get bottles unless they were for someone else.","jdhowe","Jan 28, 2014"

Small dots of lace slowly drip into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is sour with malt, grain, salt, lemon, and acidic aromas. Taste is much the same with sour lemon and salt flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of acidity on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that is light and refreshing.","UCLABrewN84","Jan 04, 2014"
