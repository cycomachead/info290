"Overall, a great berliner weisse - the aroma is so unique but a great quality that allows you to understand this beers progression from fermentation."

"Pours a finger of furiously fizzy head with a very pale straw color. Almost diluted lemonaide like. Nose is off. Some lactic acidity and tart lemons with a super funky and ripe brett. Makes ne think of vitamins and dog food. Tastes better than the nose, lots of tart lemons and lactic acid with that odd funk in the background. Prickly carbonation with a little bit of lip smacking. Easy drinking aside from that odd funk. Overall it's a decent take on the style, not sure what's up with that nasty funk."

"Overall – Big and lemony, tart, and sour. A very interesting brew which even while puckering is still somewhat refreshing. A very interesting try."

"Will review again when I have the beer on it's own."

"Overall: Decent beer, but not great. Worth a try, but no need to seek out."
""
"O: Overall there is a good level of tart and spicy flavor here packagaed in a 4.0% abv that many can not claim that just may surprise you. Quickly dissipating head, pale straw color, sour fruitiness, tart and spicy flavor all within the general guidelines of style making for a good berliner. Not many american breweries attempt to brew such a style."

"O: Very different brew. Maybe the first time I've tried this exact style but I like its uniqueness and especially good on hot summer evening."
""
"This is very German in style. Almost soda like, I have to say. Sourness is definitely there. Grabs at the mouth and pulls. Very on-point. It could be rounded out a bit (puns!!), but for what it is, I like it. Glad to get a chance to stop by and try this one."

"This poured out as a milky looking yellow color with a nice white head on top. The smell of the beer was definitely tart, lots of citric acid aromas dominate this brew. The taste of the beer is in fact a lot like a fresh lemonade, makes the taste buds tingle and almost makes the lips pucker. The mouthfeel is decently carbonated with a very light body. Overall this beer is pretty good, I liked it better once the Raspberry syrup was added but that's because I am not a big sour beer fan. Still worth a try."

"O - Super solid offering from a new local brewery. That alone makes this beer a winner for me. Will also note that my bottle says 4% ABV yet both this site and their site lists it as 3%."

"On the fuller end of medium bodied with a tart, slightly puckering sourness that lingers over the sweeter notes into a dry finish.  Strog lactic funk woth again, a strong cheesy/milky flavor.  There's also some musty bret that's countered by sweet citric acid and a sourdough bred flavor.  Lots of lemon peel/citrus  flavor but the cheesy funk is a bit overpowering."
"Light body, solid carbonation, goes down super easy. Totally sessionable. Tarter and funkier than most American Berliners I’ve tried. Recommended, but only to those who don’t mind a little funky foot cheese wafting all up in their grills."
"Pretty mild on the tartness and slightly acidic on the back of the tounge. The taste seems to fade out towards the end. Light bodied and boldly carbed up. The low ABV makes it easy for a few, i hope to find some six packs some day."

"A nice, incredibly drinkable berliner."
"Serving type: on-tap"

"Pours a hazed yellow straw, spotty patches of head, little lacing. Scent brings expected tartness, more tangy than overpowering, notes of wheat and yeast, earthy. More tangy than tart, definite presence of grain in the flavor profile, light citrus and watery fruit, earthy. Medium bodied, a touch grainy and not as bright and spitzy as I prefer in the style. Decent into to a new brewer in a style i enjoy."
""
"This is a must have berliner. Completely enjoyable for its uniqeness. Really impressed."

"O: Color me impressed. Round Guys nailed the beer stylistically. If it isn't already, I hope to see this beer available in cases soon."
"Cheers!"

"Poured from a bottle into a Just Kidding (Jester King) snifter. Pours a very pale, yet at the same time opaque, straw color with a minimal head that recedes/disappears entirely, very quickly. The smell is, well, strange. I'm not going to use the ""f" word because I hate it's usage in describing a beer in any capacity. In fact, I don't know how to describe it. It's just...and off smell. It smells the way no beer oughta smell. This beer isn't sour, but it's super tart...like a Sweet Tart or something. It has a touch of sweetness to it as well. The finish is tart, with a sort of graininess to it. It's actually pretty clean and crisp, all things considered. One of this beer's more endearing qualities. Overall, I can see this being refreshing as hell on a scorching summer day where I typically don't even have the desire to consume beer. Otherwise, I can't see myself reaching for one of these. More a product of my own personal taste than because of the beer's quality."

"this was highly drinkable. i would recommend this to someone wanting to try a sour for the first time. cant wait to try more from this newer brewery."
"Thanks to yourefragile for sharing this bottle. Served in a mini gueuze tumbler. Pours a nice straw color with a fizzy white head that recedes like a soda. Thin collar for a bit. The nose has a light bit of lactic acidity and lemon alongside a moderate wheat character. Flavor is fairly wheaty with mild acidity. Not much fruit there. No off character. Body is light and crisp with a touch of acidity and a nice wheat-driven dryness. Pretty good, but nothing over the top."
" The taste is very full with nice fruity zesty and lactic tanginess which seems like a slight tangy green apple mixed with the sweet tart of kumquat with some wheat elements which are earthy, but not quite funky with a light tinge of sour which seems to liven the overall flavor as it becomes dry in the final tastes. Overall I thought this was a nice take on the style. This is not over the top sour wheat but nice and balanced in a traditional berliner style I really enjoyed."
""
"This is not a bad take on the style. It is light bodied and has a short lived effervescent level of carbonation that while initially is active, it gets swirled out of solution quite easily. It fits the bill for the style with some unique character to it that I feel is reminiscent of sour mashing and brett included in this. The sheer amount of yeast and wheat protein stuck in solution hinders that crisp snap I look for in the finish of a berliner. That gripe aside, I enjoyed this and will have no issue polishing off another glass."
"Check this place out. I think these guys are going to ake some interesting beers. The triple was also vey good as well."
"This is one style of beer I can't seem to get enough of, and whenever a brewer decides to make one (not frequently enough it seems), I have to try it. Round Guys, this is a giant leap forward to set yourselves up for being a killer brewer of this style. Absolutely well done - I cannot wait for either some growler fills or bottles of this eventually. I kept going back to the booth for this beer until it ran dry."
