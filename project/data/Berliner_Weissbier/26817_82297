Lemon, sour apple, berry and a little funk.  Tart on the taste, lemon, sour apple, and a hint of mulberry in the finish.  Straight forward but great.  Sharp carbonation carries that tart flavor and gives a highly carbonated feel all the way through the finish and some dryness at the end.  Great beer for the style with a nice twist with the mulberry.","HopBomb515","Oct 26, 2014"

3.96,0.5,4,4.25,3.75,4,4,"Can shared at the Swamp Head Batch 600 release. Pours a purplish pink color with a creamy white head on top. Aroma of mulberries, sour vinegar, wheaty malts, and berliner like yeastiness. Flavor follows with big notes of mulberries--wow they go really well in this style--wheat malts, yeasty tart berliner notes, some lemon peel, and some floral notes. Really light bodied with high carbonation. While Iâ€™m not a fan of the style generally, this was very nice. I would have it again for sure.","BMMillsy","Jul 30, 2014"

A slight sour crispness to it. Super duper crushable. Don't know what a Mulberry taste like, but there is a little bit of a berry taste to it. This was really nice summer beer.

Its low ABV and crispness make this an excellent summer beer. Strong offering here from Carton, and I'm happy to have found this on tap at a local store.","siege06nd","Jul 14, 2013"

2.42,-38.6,3,2.25,2.25,3,2.5,"Medium bodid with some tart, puckering acidity up front that's countered by citrus fruit and sourdough bread notes. Â Flavors fall off mid-palate and there is an odd metallic adjunct flavor that overpowers. Â Doesn't have traditional characteristics associated with the style. Lacking in bready yeast, fullness in body, lactic funk and wheat beer notes. Kind of bland really with some lactic funk and sour lemon acidity up front.","corby112","Beers"

Taste is slightly tart green apples up front that mellows out to a very nice funky wheat base. Mouthfeel and carbonation are very on point for the style. Overall probably the most refershing thing I could have ordered on this 94 degree nyc day and at 3.9%abv I think I can drink it all day.","joefuzz","Jun 29, 2012"

4,1.5,4,4,4,4,4,"Carton Monkey Chased the Weasel pours a slightly hazy goldenrod, with a wispy bit of white foam lingering for a minute before dissipating. The nose has plenty of lactic tartness, along with a light berry aroma. The flavor profile opens with a touch of wheaty, grainy sweetness. A big lactic sour and funk note comes in next, and fills in the majority of the beer. The finish, where most berliner weissbiers lose me, is saved by a subtle fresh berry note that works very nicely with all that came before it. The body is appropriately light, and the carbonation, which doesn't leap out of the glass, has a certain pep to it. Monkey Chased the Weasel is one of the most enjoyable berliner weissbiers I've had. The addition of mulberries really helps it shine over more traditional offerings.","axeman9182","Jun 26, 2012"

3.97,0.8,3.5,4,4,4,4,"Overall this is a super flavorful beer for being so light in ABV. I normally am not a fan of this style at all, but the addition of mulberries has added a freshing dynamic that elevates this beer to a new level. So impressed by Carton and super-psyched to see more great local beer from NJ.","claspada","0"
