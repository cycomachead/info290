"Good but I was disappointed.  Wanted more raspberry and more juiciness."

"Gorgeous color. Would have loved just a TOUCH of sweetness to really makes the berries pop. The dry, sour flavor really instead gave way to more seeds/skins characteristics and not the juice."

"Not that well balanced and way to much lacto imo"
"De garde is amazing."

"Overall pretty nice, nice berry, nice acidity, but weird buttery aroma. Still tasty and enjoyable. If not for that buttery thing it would be so much better."

"Up there with Imperial Boysen and fresh Lily (and better than Lily is drinking currently)"

"Absolutely stunning nose and color. Big jammy raspberry flavors with a somewhat thick mouth feel. Very drinkable sour with huge berry notes. Possibly the best American sour beer I've tasted. Hard to believe this is classified as a Berliner Weisse style beer. I never would have guessed that. Only had a small pour, but I feel that this is better than VSB.  Highly recommended!"

"Tremendous beer... jammy and vibrant berry tartness, thick for the style, but still refreshingly light, sour, and dry. Good complexity for such a lighter beer, goes down way to quickly, leaves one wanting another glass."
