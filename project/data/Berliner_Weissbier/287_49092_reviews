"Nice crisp taste. Easy to drink down in gulps. Light on the alcohol content which means you'll last longer at a drinking session. I had this in a glass poured from the bottle at Montana's Ale House in Bushwick, Brooklyn."

"A palate-cleansing highly sessionable cross between an American wheat and a Berliner Weissbier?  Yes Bells, you nailed it. It doesn't light the world on fire but it doesn't need to. An excellent example of crafting beer with finesse."
""
""
""
"Decent beer, but I have enjoyed other Berliners much more."
""
"Mildly sour but not heavy. Love it."

"Very pale yellow, nearly clear. Smells light, slight sour and wheat. Effervescent wheat flavor and a little green apple tartness. Sessionable too, we have a winner!"
"I'd place this somewhere between an American pale wheat ale and a true Berliner weisse. Bell's gets major props for packaging this in six packs; not many other breweries that distribute to my area do so. This goes down easy for those hot summer days (of which we have a lot in Southern California) and it is extremely thirst quenching. Wheat, slight tart lemon flavor, and a light body with lots of carbonation and a dry slightly tart finish keeps you coming back for more. If you're expecting tons of flavors, look elsewhere. Actually, don't, you should still try this and maybe open your palate up to the subtle finesse of a nicely executed beer that won't destroy you in 100 degree heat and pairs excellently with any food."

"O- Good taste. A very easy light drinker with some complexity from the sourness. Would make an excellent summer beer"
""
""
"Overall - It rings true on some notes, but falls flat on others.  Not really sour enough to be called a berliner weisse, more of a light American wheat beer.  Very refreshing, good warm weather, outdoors beer, but the minerality is a bit off-putting.  3.5 paws."
""
""
""
"Very light with sour hints. Pours light in color with a small head that goes away quickly. Almost list a lemonade type of beer. Enjoyed a ton."

"another great beer from the guy's at bell's.  beautifully balanced easy drinking sour.  if i had one complaint, i would say that it the flavor doesn't last.  just drink and taste and then gone.  not a bad thing especially when coupled with food.  just seems a but thin."
""

"Just ok, probably never drink again"

"Just not a good beer"

"Really enjoyed this beer.  Good coloring, not too much foam.  Loved the taste."

"My traveling beer geek pal, picked this one up for me while on beercation in OBX.  A wonderful session beer in Berliner Weissbier style.  Slightly tart, easy to drink and very balanced and flavorful.  Could have this beer anytime, anywhere, any reason.   If there is anything to knock it, its only because of fizziness in the body and the finish is a touch on the dry side and not as smooth and cleansing as some other ones from same style of beer.  Otherwise, its delicious.  Enjoy!"

"pours a cloudy straw color with the carbonation of a Berliner Weisse. It is lemony, dry, tart and refreshing. It lacks 1809’s barnyard funk and the carbonation is not quite as champagne like or tart as the two German interpretations but it is very drinkable and much cheaper than either German beer. For someone looking for something light, refreshing and not a traditional American Light Lager, this is worth a try. This would be a good beer to spend a day on a boat with."

"A 12 oz. pour at World of Beers in Cary, NC on 9/18/14. While the look and feel appear to be on, the smell and taste are where this beer is lacking. Both the aroma and flavor are very muted. In particular, there is less citrus and acid than one would expect from this style. While it drinks very clean from start to end, the flavor seems to fade toward the finish."

"Very light, reminiscent of a gose, with less tartness. Certainly no Berliner."
""
""
""
""

"The beer pours white and small bubbles as part of the head but dissipates quickly. The beer itself is hazy and a pale straw color. the Beer has a tart smell mixed with a banana yeast notes and orange hop notes. However, the smell appears to be a little weak. The taste has a strong sour/tart note with banana notes from the yeast. The orange hop flavor is still present but each of the notes taste a bit watery. The beer's mouthfeel is slightly watery and light bodied with smooth and light carbonation. Overall, a decent beer but falls to the trap that the style needs something else and stronger to make it good."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O: Well done brew, though nothing overly defining about it.  Craft beer Berliner meets assembly line, leaving a minimalist brew to style that is refreshing and smooth without abrasive characteristics.  I love that its sessionable, and somewhat accessible."

"This is certainly one of the least tart Berliners I have had in a long time. This is not detrimental but I think even a hint more tarts would do wonders. Solid but suprassed by other modern examples of this style."

"Overall, this is a decent beer. Rated to style, its ABV and hoppiness is too high for a Berliner Weisse, and it's missing the big, fruity, banana-like esters of an American Pale Wheat or a Hefeweizen. Wherever it lies stylistically, it's drinkable but far from exceptional."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I guess some people just don't understand this type of beer. It achieves everything I'd want in a summer beer: light, drinkable, yet still offering a number of diverse flavors. It's damn goodd and don't let anyone tell you different."

"Great overall beer. Refreshing sour for the summertime! A light ale appearance with a nice sour bite at the end. Something i could drink a few of and not have trouble. Im new to trying sour beers and this one is making me a fan. I would recommend this beer for a hot day. A big fan of bells brewery and will be buying this beer again."
"This had no visible carbonation but was very crisp and easy to drink. It was easily sessionable and was fuller than the watery complexion."

"O - An awesome summer brew, and is so refreshing on a hot summer day. Goes down easy and is light, so you won't get tanked."
""
""
"Overall - Pretty sure this is my first Berliner Weiss, and I gotta say I'm digging it. Really nice lemon zing that comes across as very genuine. Perfect summer brew. Corona with lime wedge, eat your heart out!"
""
""
""
"Not the best Berliner Weiss out there, but a good showing from bells, especially considering the low price and high availability in my area. This would be nice to drink all day long at the beach. Very sessionable and very refreshing. I'll probably buy this again to enjoy on a hot summer Sunday."

"A solid brew from Bell's and one of the better brews from them. Truly a good summer brew compared to their Oberon."
""

""

"O. This is a very solid Berliner and, I suspect, very close to the traditional style. There's only hints of tartness as opposed to outright sour acidity. Bouquet and flavor are very similar to a German Pilsner, but the lacto tartness and the wheat lend a creaminess more appropriate of the Berliner style. The reviews on this are understandably muted: this is so easy drinking, so straight forward, and so well-integrated that it almost comes off boring. But it's anything but. This is a wonderful piece of first class craft and an absolute treat for the warmer months. In a world of over the top sours, Oarsman aims for classic simplicity and makes its mark. Cheers!"
""
""
"O- Not bad, just lacking the amount of character needed for it to be a repeat buy."
""
""
""
"The buzz word ""sour"" made me go for this one. Pours piss yellow, more neon than a BMC brew. Smell is almost non-existant, but it honestly smells like puke. The flavor is better than the nose, but it's mostly lemon- like the sour part of lemon, not necessarily the citrus flavor. Anyway, this could be refreshing if I was sweating my ass off on a hot day, but it wasn't exactly the best way to end the night after having a few beers."

"Poured from a bottle with a clear yellow color, plenty of bubbles, and a foamy white head that disappears quickly. The aroma is lemon and wheat. Taste is lemon, wheat, and a nice touch of tartness. The beer has a light to medium body feel and crisply refreshing. This was a surprise to me. I was expecting something light and uninteresting, but got something much more enjoyable."

"Overall - A light, refreshing Berliner Weiss. Perfect for a hot day. It could have been a bit more flavorful, but it's still solid."
""
""
""
""
""
"I absolutely love this beer. The sour taste is exactly what I like, of course, I didn't know it until I tasted it. I have drank a good number of these beers, and a little pre drink advice before you pop the top, flip the beer upside down and tilt it and spin it to get all the goodies off the bottom. It makes the first drink as sour as the last."
""
""
""
"On the whole, an uncomplicated but refreshing and sessionable beer that I fear I have not done justice to by waiting to drink it. As it stands, this was a perfectly pleasant drinking experience, but I'd love to revisit a fresher bottle at some point."
"taste is very simple and straight forward. Crisp and effervescent, tart lemon and a light grain sweetness. It is not mouth puckering but it is dry and palate cleansing. It's mild and very easy to drink. Refreshing and a perfect beer for a warm day, for the beach, a lawnmower beer. Light and drinks so very easily."
""
"When I poured this beer, it has a.gold color body with a fizzy head to it. The aroma has a light maltyness to it. The taste has a tart flavor and some sweetness to it. It also has a little bit of malt on the back of the tongue. The mouthfeel is like champagne. Overall this is I think my first sour and I enjoyed it very much."
""
""
""
"Bottom Line: Buy if you're looking for a refreshing and semi-traditional berliner. Try if you're a fan of sours. Don't bother if you easily have access to other berliner weisse styles unless you wanna try a new one."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall I've always been a fan of this beer. Real interesting flavor that sets this one apart from the other session beers on the market. Sure its not as tart as some berliner weissbiers can be, but the malt backbone is solid enough to gain this some more points."
""
""
"Crisp refreshing beer that would be perfect on a warm summer day. I enjoy it just fine on this cold winter evening."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I don't know....maybe its the style that I don't like. Way to tart for me. The beer poured a hazy yellow with no head and no lace. The scent had almost a chardonnay flare. The taste was tart much like a white wine. The mouthfeel was light in body with subtle carbonation. Overall its ok...probably better summer beer than a late fall beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A pleasant surprise, although nothing world-beating about it. I'm not usually a sour beer fan, but this one was not too bad and could be really good in the right circumstances -- a hot day out on the deck."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Not the most flavorful of this style that so many brewers are making more traditionally and also with decided American twists. Very tasty, and I recommend it if you like this style, and prefer it less tart and grainy than traditionally brewed."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"More lemons on the palate, moderate puckering sour/tartness. Bright and fairly refreshing. Also wheat, hay, and a gentle eartyness come to mind. Still not my favorite style....But I could see enjoying another bottle of this on a warm summer day with some some cheese, bread and salad."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"It's scary how bad this beer is. I've tried it bottled on 2 different occassions and I was shocked both times at the overwhelming sour taste. Overall Bell's is one of my top five favorite breweries, but this one is a solid miss. A definite drain pour on this one."

""

""
"O: What little I've sampled of the style, I haven't liked. This is definitely the closest I've come to liking a Berliner. It still has its fair share of flaws which keep that from happening: poor aroma, ugly look, and undefined flavors mean I'm not going to get this one again."

"Bell's Oarsman Ale ---4/5."
""
"12 ounce bottle into signature pint glass, bottled on 4/2/2013. Pours lightly hazy golden straw color with a 1 finger fairly dense white head with decent retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Slight spotty lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of tart apple, lemon, grape, pear, wheat, hay, grass, pepper, funk, light vinegar, and yeast earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance and complexity of yeast and light malt notes; with decent strength. Taste of tart apple, lemon, grape, pear, hay, grass, wheat, funk, light pepper, light vinegar, and yeast earthiness. Light fruity/earthy tartness on the finish; with lingering notes of light fruits, hay, grass, wheat, light pepper, light funk, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a short bit. Nice and pleasant balance and complexity of flavors; with a very dry finish and no cloying flavors as expected. Medium carbonation and light bodied; with a very dry and crisp mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is well hidden with zero warming present as expected of 4%. Overall this is a very solid Berliner weisse style. Nice balance and complexity of flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. An enjoyable offering."

"O - 3.5 - Great beer, definitely a session beer. One of my favorites from Bell's!"
"O: Overall this was quite interesting and unexpected, although it was a groundshaking beer to me, it's still quite unique, worth a try."
""
""
"Overall: I'm new to the style, but I do like the 1809 Berliner Weissbier better I must say because of its more appealing appearance and mouthfeel. This is refreshing, but it isn't something I'd go out of my way to find."
""
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a tart, dry finish."
""
"O: A good beer and I believe a good example of the style."
"Pours a relatively clear straw yellow with lacing that very ally fades. Smells tart & crisp with lemons. There's a faint sour mash character found on. Tastes tart with an easygoing mouth puckering. Tastes crisp with lemon and citrus. Easy drinking and feels light. Could drink this all day long. Perfect for hot, humid weather."

"O: a very enjoyable beer, especially in this hotter weather. Berliner Weiss is not a style that I’ve tried many beers from, but it’s a very nice change of pace from my usual rotation of IPAs and porters. I'll definitely be drinking some more of this one."
"Not a favorite of mine, but a super easy drinking beer, could toss a few back in one sitting. Going to try and add some fruit to this the next time to add a little more flavor to it and counteract some of the sour-tart flavor to it."
""
"Overall, not very good."
"O - A refreshing beer. Not bad by any means, but I probably wouldn't seek out."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - A thin beer low on flavor. I found it about as refreshing as a glass of water. Possibly a serviceable session beer on a hot day, but I found this one lacking in every department."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Not very tart for a berliner weissbier. It kind of tastes more like a wheaty saison pale ale. A bit refreshing but overall lackluster to me. However, the age on it might have hurt it a bit."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Pretty straight forward, classic Berliner. Nice tart and wheat characteristics make this a very good choice to drink on a mid-summer's day."

"Overall: very good and often over-looked Bell's year round. tasty and extremely drinkable."

"Faintly tart with that same wheat presence and honey... very light, crisp. Quaffable."

"pour is transparent straw yellow with a thin white head. Nose is heavy grain, pale malt, some herbal notes with a fair bit of lemon and citrus. Taste follows suite, fairy tart lemony finish, bready grain mid palate with herbal and citrus notes worked in towards the back. Moderate carbonation, fairly dry finish with a lingering grain."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, an ok berliner for the price, but after having 1809 and New Glarus, its hard for any others to stand up against them."
""
"O: A truly great session beer. It's got a mildly sour kick, and it's fairly effervescent. It's very light, but it has a lot of character. At 120 calories per bottle, I think I'm in love."

""
""
""
""
"O: a very drinkable Berliner Weiss, really refreshing"
""
""
""
"Oarsman Berliner Weiss is a slightly cloudy pale straw/orange color. It's very carbonated, however this fizzyness dies down almost completely shortly after the initial pour. There's no lacing whatsoever. The aroma is extremely complex and curious, with sweet kiwi, lemon, sour apple, yeast and biscuity grain. The taste makes the drinker recall baked goods with a fairly straightforward and crisp tart fruit flavor being the most prevalent. Very light feel and refreshing overall. I had this with a spicy dish, and it paired very well. Great entry to the Bell's lineup!"

"Travelers 14oz mug. An American Wild Ale. Pours hazy lemony yellow, opaque, low head, blotchy lacing. Nose vague, hidden, wet, etoh. Citrus notes, wetness, then light bitter sour notes effervesce. Goes well with salt. Afternotes linger, lactic isn't too biley, clean flavors. Would like to have a more bitter hop bite on this to elevate. Carbonation is finer, moving to lambic, but fatter at the end. Somewhat champagne-like in mouth feel. Low EtOH allows for an easy another."

"This is a good introduction to sour beers. It refreshes the palate, but isn't overwhelmingly sour. It finishes crisp and clean. It has hints of ripe fruit like sour apple, but still has a grainy backbone. It is great to drink when the weather is warm, or if you like a change of pace from heavy stouts or hopped up IPAs. It won't knock you out of your chair, but I think that it is definitely worth a try."
"Overall- Definitely shows the characteristics of a Berliner weissbier. While I haven't tried many of the style I'm so far not used to their sour flavors making it a bit difficult to gauge its quality."
""
"Overall - a great beer for a hot, summer day. It is a good beer to just sit and sip."
"Aroma & Taste: Light malt and straw notes, with some grapefruit and pineapple. Light fizzy mouthfeel with moderate acidity. The acidity gives the beer a sour taste that has a slight sweetness to it."
"Overall, this is a great way to get your sour fill in a cheap and easy to find beer. Great, if not ideal, example of the style. The perfect summer lawnmower beer if shandies aren't your thing."
""
"This beer has a pleasantly tart, citrusy aroma. It has a bright light gold appearance. The beer was at first crisp and refreshing, followed with a tart citrus taste, almost like a weak lambic. Very light mouthfeel makes it very refreshing and clean, this beer would be a perfect one to end the day with."

"An excellent summer session ale. Great to drink while grilling -- the low AVB will lead to fewer fires!"
""
""
""

""

"Love how light and refreshing it is. This beer makes a great all day drinking beer since it's also a lighter ABV. An excellent starter sour beer for those that aren't too familiar with sours. Would like to be able to drink all through the summer though, which sometimes doesn't happen as it's apparently a fall seasonal. The fact that people haven't caught on to how nice this sour is makes it last longer at retail locations though, which is a plus."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this beer was its lightness and ease of drinkability. The aroma introduced a serious sourness and tartness, while the flavoring, via crisp grain and citric inclusions, smashed, smoothed, and blended things into a concise, easy final product. No one component ever became overwhelming, and the wheat stayed right where it needed to be to ensure the strength of the base. If we are being picky, the flavoring does ease up a bit too much at the end of the sip and, at times, can feel watered through. This, however, doesn’t change the fact that this is one clean, refreshing, and sessionable beer."
""
""
"Not for me. Once is enough."
""
""
""
""
"The beer pours a spritzy golden orange with a small, egg shell white head of tight bubbles that quickly fizzles into a rim on the glass. The beer’s body is misty but clear of particles, and chock full of a torrential river of carbonation bubbles that are constantly racing up the glass. For lacing, the beer leaves small slippery strings that do not stay on the glass long. On the nose, the beer smells deeply of cereal wheat, almost like a meaty wheat flake. There is the faintest hint of tartness in the beginning of the nose, but that is quickly eaten up by the thick bready caramel wheat smell that makes me think this beer is heavier than it is. On the tongue, the beer tastes lightly acidic with a nice sweet wheat malt roundness to the taste. In flavor, the beer begins as tart, almost citric acid that washes quickly over the tongue and is replaced by light chewy lemon wheat bread (without the acid) and a touch of citric orange. The finish is of light lemon and orange water, mixed in with a touch of sweet wheat malts. As the beer warms, a wheat flake flavor does enter the beer throughout the taste. The aftertaste is light and tingly, similar to how the mouth feels after a light tea, or flavored water. In the mouth, the beer feels a step above light in body, with a strong prickly carbonation that never grows out of control and helps to punctuate the flavor notes on the palate. The mouth is left fairly clean, with only the faintest feeling of carbonation burn and a touch of sticky malt candy covering the mouth. Overall this beer is nice, and could definitely be a great all day beer. Its light spritziness makes it refreshing and interesting, but I kind of wish there was more tartness to this beer. It’s simple and nice, but it doesn’t blow me away, and it really just leaves me desiring a fuller flavor. A great session beer for sure, if you want something light, but you can find more flavorful beers for the ABV level."

"Not a bad beer but I expect more from a world-class brewery like Bells. There's just not much going on here as if Oarsman is made to have syrup added to it. There's more interesting beers in the style though this is still worth trying."

"Clocking in at 4.0% ABV, this is WONDERFUL for drinking. The mouthfeel is fantastic effervescent and light enough to pair well with the tartness. The low ABV keeps this one being REFRESHING! It's my easy-to-get fix for my Berliner cravings!"
"Poured from the bottle to a standard shaker, May 2012. Pours a pale, hay colored yellow with a little haze to it. Very thin head, but very active bubbles rushing up from the bottom. Smells heavy of yeast and fresh bread with a cutting smell of acid and lemon rind as well. The taste and mouthfeel was very clean, like a standard lager but with good body and obvious wheat sweetness to it. It did get a little cloying after a little bit and almost tasted like a lemon jolly rancher. The ABV says sessionable, but it was just a little too sweet to me."
""
""
""
"O- average Berliner with very mild sourness and a thinner feel than others I have had."
""
""
"Verdict: A bit lacking for such a simple style, the balance of flavors seems to be a touch out of whack and it's lacking brightness and vibrancy that makes this style really enjoyable."
""
"O: Was not aware this is a sour upon purchasing. That is my fault for not reading the back of the bottle. I just read ""ale"". Anyhow, I tried to judge fairly based on the fact that I am not a fan of sour beers. The initial pour did not look like a ""high end"" beer to me. The heavy carbonation and yellow color reminded me of a cheaper light beer. The lack of foam and lacing added to this. However, actually tasting the beer turned it around for me. The tartness and carbonation played well with each other and created a beer that is reminiscent of something like white wine. The aftertaste and smell of vinegar are sort of a turn off for me. I imagine that for people that enjoy sours this is a pretty decent one. However, it is not for me."

""
"I am NOT a Flemish sour fan ... yet (I'm still working to develop a taste for sours). But the tartness of this light-looking beer was just enough to be interesting but not sour. I had a four-ounce taster of the beer, so I don't know if it would have held my interest for a full 12- or 16-ounce serving."

"Pours a clear, pale yellow with a creamy white head. Aromas of tart fruit, and a hint of vinegar. Taste is an initial sour, tart fruit beginning, followed by a light cracker middle, and a hint of earthiness in an otherwise super clean finish. Mouthfeel is good for the abv. Overall a great true session beer. It's a shame there arent more Berliner Weiss' available in America!"

"1st time trying this style. It's not going to be a favorite of mine, but it's a nice change of pace beer and easy drinker if you don't mind the puckering sourness. Didn't try it with the addition of flavored syrup like they do in Berlin. Would be interesting to see what that does for it."

"I read the description of the style which says 'tourists in Berlin will often order on as a ""Berliner Weisse mit Schuss: Himbeere.""' Luckily, we have raspberry syrup lying around the house. About one tablespoon or little less is just perfect. It cuts the sourness. I put the syrup in the glass and pour the beer over it, and the result is a very nice foamy head. This is the way to drink the beer."

"O: This beer was okay. Pretty average. Good tart taste though."

"It's an ok beer. Not a good drink for the colder months, but would be money as a hot weather session beer. I'd look forward to one of these after doing anything to work up a sweat. Easy to drink, won't land you in jail."

"Pours a hazy pale straw yellow with a bright white one and a half finger head which quickly dissipates. Grass and flora, light sour citrus notes, and a very light accent of funk on the nose. Green tea, fresh grassiness, slight tart light lemon and bready yeast midpalate that finishes dry slightly tart and refreshing. Light body, mild carbonation. The concept behind this beer seems to be a less intense Berliner weiss-style beer. Bell's is successful in accomplishing that. Oarsman Ale is a good introduction beer, however it may seem to be a bit lacking to those fairly familiar with the style and other sour styles."
"O - I guess this is well done to the style, but it's really just not for me. Probably a good introduction to craft beer for some people. Sessionable but too tart to really be all that sessionable."
""
"Although… although…I am liking it more, at the end of bottle #2. Maybe I'll be a rootin' tooting' booster before too long."

""
"Poured this 12 oz Weissbier into a pint glass. Poured a cloudy straw color, and produced an average white head. Featured average retention and it left a nice amount of lacing on the glass. The aroma had a base of malted wheat, lemon rind. Medium in body, this brew had a classic malted wheat base, and the tart flavor of lactic acid due to the sour mash process that was used to brew this beer. By far, not the best sour beer that I have had, but is an excellent gateway into the category. Nice session beer. Excellent summer beer. I would order this again."

"Very bready with lemon and citrus tones, but with an excellent mix of characteristics that lets a lot of things show through and lets no one thing hijack the ride. Berliner Weisse characteristics abound. Good feel, very easily drinkable. I could actually go for many of these in one sitting. A really excellent production, imo."
""
""
"Pours a semi hazy yellow color with a very slight head. Scent is grassy and grainy with hints of citrus. Taste is light, refreshing, and very easy sipping with its grassy, earth taste. Overall a very smooth and light beer. I was really shocked by how light tasting this was from being a Bell’s brew. Great for summer, but don’t expect the bold Bell’s taste you’re accustomed to."
""
"Overall: I really, really like this beer for what it is. I would love this in cans."
"Overall: Another excellent beer after a long day of hiking. Not as good as the German counterparts I have had, but certainly a beer I could do a six of. Wish the smell was a bit stronger here."

"Nice body thats on the lighter side of medium. Sweet bright citric fruits with a tarty dried fruit aspect on the middle of the tongue. Very nice actually with the right amount of balance between sweetness, acidity, and sourness. The sourness is a little stronger than the other aspects of the beer but is rounded out by a faint creaminess. For being 7 months old the beer held up quite well and retains amazing qualities that a berliner weiss should have. Now to find a fresh one! Very good brew."
""
""
""
""
"O - Not nearly as enjoyable as I recall from my first sixer around a year back, but hey everyone's palette progresses. I will not be revisiting this one."
""
""
"O: I really, really liked this beer. I've not had significant experience with the Berliner Weiss, but reading the label on the bottle, I think Bell's hit right on with what they were trying to do. I'm very much looking forward to trying this again soon, and will update my review when I do."
"3.5 D: Super easy to drink with good flavors, but could use some more depth and complexity."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is a pretty good beer and shouldn't be overlooked."
""
""
"D - Very drinkable. Nice Berliner Weissbier with really nice balance and some good acidic, tart, and funky flavors."
"Not an amazing beer by any measure, but give it a chance and you realize this is a nice session beer, with the zesty tartness to keep you interested. Works well in the summer heat too."
"This isn't some big-time, heavy barrel aged, super rare and expensive beer. It's a mild Berliner Weisse(-ish) that delivers what you'd expect it to deliver. Very refreshing to drink one of these after mowing the lawn on a hot summer day. More quenching than a cup of iced tea or lemonade. A good beer to keep stocked for the hot season, no doubt."

"On tap at Bar Louie's in Ann Arbor. Cloudy yellow pour, creamy white head on top that sticks around for a while. Aroma is sour lemons, yeast, tart. Taste like sour urine, a bit watered down, unpleasant finish, slightly puckering. Was not impressed with this one, and not a huge fan of this style in general. I'll stick to DFH Festina instead, as this is the only one of the style that I found tolerable."
""
"12oz bottle i picked up at Beverage World in Ft. Oglethorpe. I had no idea this was a berliner based on the label though it did metion sour mash technique. Light orange color, hints of malt and tartness. Flavor was refreshing, slightly tart but had a hint of what seemed like stale malt. Easy to down but I might need a fresher sample."
""
""
"This is only the second Berliner Weissbier I've had (the other being Dogfish Head Festina Peche). I enjoyed this one more, but I don't know if it's because I liked the flavor or because I knew what to expect. If memory serves, I think that the DFH offering is a little more sour than this one (I'll have to try them together sometime to verify). Unfortunately, those two might be the only beers of this style I can easily get. It's a shame, since these beers are incredibly good thirst-quenchers."

"Poured into a wine glass, it has a light yellow color with a thin head. Oarsman has a nose of lemon, pepper and wheat. Sipping on this and I taste bread, yeast, spice and citrus. It is a light and refreshing beer, as one would hope for the style. Mouthfeel is light, with nice carbonation. Some dryness in the finish. It is not the best of the style that I have tried, but pretty good and some folks have easy access to it."
""
""
""
""
"This beer pours golden yellow with a rahter lage white head and a slight haze to it. The nose has some floral citrus as well as some wheat and a lager feel. Taste of the beer is about the same and it also has a slight sourness to it. The beers flavors are well balanced but lack strength and complexity. It is rather easy drinking and accessible to just about anybody. Not bad, but quite average."
""
""
"not a conventional berliner weiss as i understand them. this one pours a bit darker, hazy orange honey color with a small white head that doesnt last long. smells a touch sour, like just a tad of brettanomyces in there, but i dont think there is. tart lemony notes as well with a funky ale yeast. flavor is yeast forward with a really cool wheat malt profile. the sourness comes from the yeast i think, very citrusy. this is a pretty solid summer brew, lots going on, but lighter in body and carbonation. very drinkable, not boring at all. my only disappointment was not in the beer at all, but in the fact that my waitress told me this was a sour beer. it isnt, but it is quite good for what it is. still never had a bells brew i didnt adore."
""

""
""
""

"O - this is a great beer for a hot day. I'm not sure that I agree with the description of it being a session beer. I think the sourness would get a little overpowering after 2. I enjoy sipping on just one."
"The beer pours a hazy yellow color with a white head. The aroma is full of grain and some wheat, but not too much of the tartness I expected. That changes a little bit in the flavor. I get a lot of wheat, with a very light amount of tartness and some grain. Thin, watery mouthfeel and medium carbonation. Decent, but not really what I was expecting."
""
"The extra age didn't seem to hurt this bottle at all. Easy to drink."
"O: It's a very refreshing and light beer. Nothing impressive or anything but I could probably drink this all day long during a hot summer day."
"Lightly hazy yellow, thin head with a film of retention, and a collar. Nose has a light tartness, some graininess, a bit crackery and doughy. Perhaps a bit of lemon citrus, but this is quite mild. Not a ton of flavour initially, but opens up into some tart lemon and wheat and pale malts, again crackery and light. A bit of sweetness in there too. Flavour disappears almost as soon as it came, not much else too this. Light and refreshing, and I could easily put back many of these on a hot patio."

"O: Good, but there are better Berliners. NOTE FOR MYSELF - I forgot I reviewed this one already. Had it out of a bottle, and my review notes were almost identical, other than the beer was much more clear in appearance than it was on tap."

""
"O: Not my favorite beer. Memorable beer because of the fact I haven't had one like it yet. It will give me something to compare to. May buy one here and there just for fun."
""
""

"D - I'm a huge fan of Berliner Weissbier, but this one misses the mark... Average at best in all facets... A bit of a disappointment... Lacks the refinement, nuance, and character that I look for in the style..."

"D: nice berliner weiss from bells. super sessionable and nice to have an easy-to-find american version."

"The mouthfeel is light, as you'd expect, with a medium amount of carbonation. It's meant for quaffing, and it does the trick. Overall, this is an average at best Berliner Wiesse. But it's a refreshing beer that I'd never turn down. This would be a superb pairing with pizza."

"M- Light bodied and wonderfully bubbly."
"O: This beer really cleanses your palate, similar to what you would expect from a light sorbet between courses at dinner."

"I'd place the Oarsman somewhere between an American pale wheat ale and a Berliner weiss. Light and refreshing, it would make a good summer beer."
"Another winner from Bell's."
"Overall, a very good beer, outside of my comfort zone, but it makes me curious to try others in the style."
""
""
""
""
""
"I first tried this about a year ago and I remember it being more flavorful. If you're looking for a refreshing, lighter craft beer, go with Oarsman. There are plenty of other low alcohol beers that are more flavorful if you're looking for a great session beer."
""
""
""
"I will probably try it again in hopes that we got a bad batch, but man, this was the first Bell's letdown I've had."
"O: Bell's has done a fine job with this beer, regardless of the style. It gets me more excited to try other versions of the style. Seems to be a good introductory sour for non-sour drinkers because it's light on the sour and ABV but big on flavor."
""
"It poured a hazy off-white light yellow with a nice off-white head. Plenety of sour notes with each sip, but it was not too overwhelming. Nice use of hops and some crisp and dry malt backbone with each sip. This is nice intro to the style, I must admit. Overall, it is a very ""clean", tart and sour and crisp wheat beer, but not for novice beer drinkers."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This beer is probably the lightest beer I have ever seen. Pretty clear, but there is a bit of haze. Initial bright white head which recedes to nothing relatively quickly. There is visible carbonation on the glass. Aroma is mildly lemony with some mild tartness and a bit of maybe smooth wheat and very mild funk. There is lots of lemon and maybe peach with some nice tartness and a bit more musty dirtyness than the aroma. Mouthfeel is great. Light, high carbonation, refreshing, and dry. I had this on tap a while ago and was not as impressed with it. I think it was the lower carbonation. The aggressive effervescent carbonation really helps a lot of the other aspects of the tartness and fruit shine."
"For whatever reason, this is the first time I've ever seen Oarsman here in Florida. It's a nice cloudy yellow-white color with a large white head that quickly drops. The aroma is nice, it's got sour wheat aromas along with some overripe fruit and lemons. The taste is very, very nice. It's got strong lemon flavors at first, backed up by a slightly tart wheat. The tartness lets up a bit at the end, letting the wheat and a bit of fruit fade into the sunset. It's really quite the beautiful beer. The mouthfeel is refreshing and slightly drying, and the drinkability is great. I can't help but think we were getting the short end of the stick here in Florida for a while. You see, we got Oberon year-round, but didn't get Oarsman at all. And it's a damn shame we're only getting this fantastic beer now."
"O - A bit all over the place, but still a very good brew. Super glad I got to try this one! Nice extra in a great trade with Nppeders!!! Thank you!"

""
""
"poured into a Duvel tulip, this is a very pale gold, and slightly hazy beer. The aroma is subtle,but nice: Light tart/funk with a clean, almost creamy wheat smell to it. A crisp mouthful opens up into a nice moderate malt sweetness provided by the wheat and lighter malts. A very mild but pleasant tart note envelops the flavor near the finish, but then fades quick. A very ""clean"" and crisp, and subtly tart take on a berliner weisse. I bet this would be great in the warm weather. Overall, if you're a fan of the style it's an interesting take. Not very tart at all, but I liked it."
""
""
"I have yet to try many Berliner Weiss biers but this one really made an impression with me. Light enough to drink many, but with enough body and taste to be enjoyable. The tartness of this beer is what really makes it stand out. It has a light citrus aroma. The taste of the beer has notes of citrus acidity but is not overly sweet, a common downfall of many fruit beers. One of my top ten."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Very pale yellow with a slight haze. Poured with a minimal head that dissipated quickly with no lacing. Smell and taste were sour; notes of tart lemon and fermenting fruit, both watered down. I enjoy some of the other Bell's beers but this is not my taste."
""
"o - overall, getting more into this style and this one isn't really the best representation. a bit thick for the style. bell's is usually spot on. this isn't a bad beer, but it isn't a great berliner."

"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a golden/whiteish color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is very mild, some lemon notes. Taste is tart, lemon and wheat, has my lips puckering. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is worth maybe worth a try if you are looking for something different but this beer is not really my thing."

"Revisited in June 2013 on tap: surprisingly tart'"

"Bell's is going for a session beer here. They nailed that. I'd like to try more Berliner Weisses to compare, but I'd certainly go after another six-pack, especially when the weather warms."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I know this is a tough style to do, and I really enjoy most of Bell's products, but this one isn't that good. Far too weak and one-note for a Berliner. There are better beers out there."
"Very different. Not a real big sour fan, so that was a turn-off. Interesting though."
""
""
"O: Overall it's a good beer. It makes a good light beer for Spring or Summer, or when you're just feeling for something refreshing. It's a good tip-of-the-hat to the Berliner style that I think many people would appreciate. I'd recommend it."
""
""
""

"Overall: Highly drinkable and very refreshing. I will definitely keep these around during the spring and summer."
""
""
""

"While I haven't had many of the Berliner Weiss style, I think this is a little odd. It's kind of like a Berliner Weiss crossed with a lager. It's very clean and easy to drink. I would definitely drink this again."
""
""
"O- great session beer, affordable funk and intro to the sour side, really nice twist, sour mashing and using american ale yeast. This is a win at under 2$/bottle and definatly not main stream."
""
""
"Overall this is a very flavorful beer for only being 4%. I could see drinking many of these on a hot summer day."
""
""
"This pours a cloudy white-golden color, intensely bright yet hazy. There’s a sharp sour-tart aroma to it that’s unique and distinct. I remember it as being ‘Oarsman-like,’ from when I first had this on tap. I know that’s not helpful. Perhaps better to say it reminds me of green apple Jolly Ranchers, only from real fruit and not artificial? The tartness gives this beer a crisp, clean taste and finish. There’s a smoothness to it and it’s strong enough to cut through say pasta or a garlicky salad, yet it’s not heavy in the least. Refreshing and delicious."
""

"O: Nothing amazing here; however, this is a demanding style, and bells really pulled off something that should be tried if one has the option to."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Taste is light and citric. Very slick and sweet, yet sourness is still there. Overall it's very balanced and decently complex. But it's still a session beer, and one my favorite session beers. Im rating this as a Pale Wheat Ale, because thats what it really is. Its only got a touch of sour, and hasnt had all the sugars fermented out."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"D- a decent mild ale, but the flavor gets annoying by the end of the glass."
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel is thin and very carbonated but ultimately quite refreshing. Taste is crisp and slightly sour. Very little hops, but here is a note to the flavor. Has something of a cider quality to the texture and taste. Produces some great belching. Not really my style overall, but it is different and very easy to drink."
""
"a very dry finish, citrusy hops on the taste"
"More so than most in the Bell's line up, I have a soft spot for this beer. A true session beer, simple yet enjoyable flavor and highly refreshing."
"Overall:	I am not a big fan their beers are hit and miss with me and this one is a miss."
""
""
""
""
"Interesting beer. Served at a good temperature with a small, off white head that rapidly disappeared and no lace. Color is a very clear yellow with some large bubble trails. Aroma is yeast, malt, wet grain, white sparkling wine. Flavor is similar to nose with a little tartness up front, plenty of carbonic tang, an ever so faint fruit sweetness and yeast bitterness. Body is good and is dominated by the acid. Finish is clean and like flavor; strangely, there seems to be a little alcohol warmth. Maybe that's an illusion due to the tartness. Any case, a touch of fruit syrup could work nice with this. Cooking too."
""
"Overall - It's extremely sour and it starts to smell quite offensive after a few minutes of being out. I'm not sure if it's because I'm not used to this style of beer but I didn't really find myself enjoying Oarsman at all. I know Bell's produces excellent beers, but this is sadly not one of them"

"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, Oarsman is a slightly hazy, straw-golden color with a minimal head that forms a thin ring around the edge of the glass. The nose is juicy and sweet, wheaty and tart. The flavor is a very interesting mix of horse blanket, barnyard funk, sweet fruitiness, wheaty-ness, and a sour-tart finish. Mouthfeel is light in body and carbonation; slick on the palate. Overall, not a bad beer, probably a pretty good representation of the style."

"Overall, Bell's Oarsman is a straightforward palate-cleansing drinker with a welcomed sour twist on the wheat ale style. I could easily pack this back over an afternoon. Recommended."
"O - Refreshing, light and easy."
"O: Nice beer. Would like a little more tart in here."
"Highly recommend..."
"Taste is tart up front, but not overpowering. Very light bodied. Not much going on outside of the tartness. I think if you like sours, or are thinking about getting into sours that this would be a good beer for you. Not my cup of tea though."
"Tart and juice-like, it's a little sweet, but overall it's an easy drinker. The low ABV helps out, too."
"Light bodied with good carbonation. I enjoyed this brew well enough, but it wasn't great and I probably would not have it again."
"Overall / Drinkability: Very drinkable - could easily have another without thinking about it. Went very well with pepperoni and green pepper pizza - the carbonation cleared the palate every time and the sourness didn't clash. Overall, a nice beer. Definitely worth trying again someday...I wonder how it would be as a summer beer."
"Great session beer. Subtle, understated, and insanely refreshing and drinkable. Not the best looking beer, and it is maybe a touch overcarbonated, but that doesn't bother me much and boy could I drink a lot of it. Maybe my favorite American Berliner weisse."
"Overall: I've been into some Berliner Weissbiers of late and have had a few good ones. This is not one of them. Too plain, I wouldn't have another."
"This is an acceptable domestic Berlinerweisse. Considering the imported versions are roughly $3 per bottle, this is more than an acceptable substitute. It hits all the right notes, if a bit softly. If produced again, a definite summer staple for us wheat beer and sour enjoying types."
"O: This one maybe to tart and lemony for some but I found this one enjoyable... and with a low ABV you could down a few of these. Good session beer!"
"O - it would be a good summer beer if it wasn't skunk. Maybe it was just a bad bottle"
"Thinner medium body, higher carbonation, tingly and invigorating on the palate. Incredibly refreshing and tart on the palate, I could easily drink 2 or 3 of these in a row."
"Overall: A pretty solid light bodied lemon forward beer. Pretty flavorful."
"O: Bell's Oarsman is a really unique, easy drinking and pretty complex session beer. It's not everyday you run into a low ABV beer with this much flavor and character. I recommend checking this Berliner Weiss out - I'll certainly be returning to it."
"Its fairly easy drinking, but really only somewhat enjoyable. I would want this to be refreshing and have another, but I really have no desire to."
"Pours a super-lite golden-yellow. Sorta hazy. A white head disappears. Smell is tart and spicy, mild malts also. Taste is sour and slightly fruity, like a wine. I don't like the taste. Finishes tight and tart."
"This is very balanced and subtle but has good flavor. At 4 %, this is eminently sessionable with outstanding drinkability. Exactly what I was looking for this evening and I will come back to it."
"O- it is what it is. very sessionable drinkable and enjoyable. get yourself some"
"D: This beer would be great in summer. A great shocking wheat beer, or pitching bundles beer. I love this style. Bells you gave it a good get go."
"Its nice to have a year round berliner weisse of this caliber."
"This is the first time I have tasted this beer overall a very nice beer. I poured from the bottle into my Sam Adams Perfect Pint glass a small white head appears but quickly disappears. The beer is a clear yellow color almost like a light iced tea. My first sip I taste lemon and smell citrus. There is a slight sourness in the beer but it seems to make it more refreshing. The lemon is very pleasant not overpowering. The flavor and the lower alcohol level make this a very easy drinking beer. Overall a good first impression. This is a beer that I want to drink again."
"Pours a murky light yellow with a 1/2 inch foamy white head that fades to an oily film. No lacing whatsoever. Smell is of wheat, lemons, and a sour aroma. Taste is of wheat, lemon/citrus, and a slightly sour flavor. A nice tart flavor lingers on the palate after each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a very crisp and clean mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good refreshing beer with a nice pleasant tartness. I am glad I got to try this one."
"Pours a light yellow with no head and visible carbonation. The aroma is citrusy mainly lemons. There is also a wheat malt smell. The taste is light, crisp, and tart. Lemons but also pears and green apples over a wheat malt. The mouthfeel is well carbonated. Overall a very drinkable beer nice light and refreshing a very good session beer."
"Extremely refreshing, with a flavor and finish that begs you to have more than one. Fits the bill for a beer you'd like to have a cooler full of while out fishing on the lake in northern Michigan. I'll definitely be seeking this one out in the future."
"Certainly not a big beer in any sense of the word but that's not always what's called for. Yummy. Went well with spicy food."
"O: Perhaps I am enjoying this one more because it is hot and this is hitting he spot, but I think this is a great brew. Very flavorful. May have to do another trade just to get more of this."
"O - got this as a housewarming gift, very thankful for it. not a home run but solid. I am now very intrigued by the style"
"Taste - Very clean flavour profile. Lemon and mineral flavours with a hint of wheat malt. Well-carbonated and crisp."
"I'm not sure why I never had this before, but it is an example of why Bell's is on my A list of breweries."
"Very easy to drink, light on the alcohol, very good summer beer. Bell's rarely disappoints me, summer or (specially) winter."
"I didn't love it. But I didn't hate it either. Overall an enjoyable enough beer, but never having had a Berliner Weissbier before, I can't say it was a great ambassador for the style as I don't feel compelled to try more based on what I had here."
"The Berliner Weiss is not a style that I reach for very often--I'm probably never going to stock my fridge with them--but Bell's has produced one that is smooth and drinkable, if not especially engaging. The balance between the malt signature and the sour citrus presence is very good--surprisingly so. I certainly could have stood for a bit more boldness of flavor, but this is a beer worth trying for yourself."
"Enjoy"
"This ended up being more tart tasting than the aroma suggested, but it still isn’t as sour as I prefer my Berliner Weiss beers to be. Still this is a very refreshing beer and it is one I would be quite happy to see show up in Arizona (though honestly it is such an easy style to make so much better that I doubt I would buy it much), and I would definitely recommend it to folks that couldn’t otherwise get Berliner Weiss beers."
"I suppose I'm doubly disappointed in this beer given that I recently enjoyed a bottle of Fritz Briem. It's not totally fair to compare this to a paradigm of the style, but I can't bring myself to ignore the fact that this is a sub-standard representation of a Berliner Weisse."
"T: This is a wheat/sour and that is exactly what you get. Nothing overly complex, but a tasty brew none the less. An easy to drink, all day long type brew."
"O: very disappointing attempt at style, weak and watery and lacks true sourness of authentic examples"
"Sharp, tart, and sour. I don't care about the commercial possibilities, this is a good beer."
"Cheers!"
"The mouthfeel is thin, as the flavor and appearance both indicated. Just a disappointing beer overall, and I don't think that the sour mash did it any favors."
"This is a nice hot weather brew, though I much prefer 1809 Berliner Weisse. A decent example of the style, this brew could stand a few minor improvements."
"Sorry Bell's. I thought this was a lager based on the mouthfeel. I got some lemon and sourness out in front, didn't like it, and went for a perrier with lemon instead. Fresh bottle from Cleveland.So not so drinkable, didn't care for the smell, the mouthfeel. You get the picture."
"This one is definitely refreshing, and I'm glad to see Bell's didn't overdo the ABV here, but Oarsman isn't one of my favorite Berliner Weissbiers."
"Quite inoffensive example of the style. The edge mellows off the acidity after a while. Pale color, more white than yellow."
"Bottle! Pours straw yellow and hazy with a minimalist white head. Aroma is grassy with lemon and mild funkiness. Grassy flavors with light tartness and a very dry finish. This particular bottle had about 6 months on it in an effort to nurture da funk and encourage additional sourness. Alas, nothing much happened. The baseline, however, was a refreshing summer beverage. So close to being transcendent, though. Light body with lively carbonation"
"The CPJ"
"Full of flavor and pleasant drinking. I really couldn’t see having more than a couple of these but it’s definitely a full flavored brew. By the end it was almost a little too much."
"O: I was disappointed. I only had one bottle and I'm wondering if it was 'bad' or old. I usually love Bell's products so I do plan on giving this one another chance."
"D/O- I've had a few Berliner Weiss' lately and I have to say, this is at the bottom of the bunch. Not a bad beer, just better examples of the style. Would revisit in the future as its probably the most common of the style."
"Overall: Incredibly drinkable. This might be something I ask for in trades from now on. It's a little crisp, incredibly refreshing, and has the right balance of malt, hop, and sour/tart to keep things interesting. If this isn't a go to beer for the summer heat, I don't know what would be."
"O: I had an odd experience with the nose on this bottle, but it didn't seem to affect the flavor profile. I will keep being a regular customer to this beer. Full of flavor for only being 4%abv. Great session beer!"
"O: All in all, this is nothing special. In all honesty, this is a pounder. You could put a 6 pack of these down like water! Not much flavor and definitely categorized in the wrong category. Don't worry about this Bells brew."
"This beer isn't a Berliner Weiss, but to be fair, Bells has said that it's not. This is a fantastic summer beer. Tart enough to be interesting, light and drinkable enough to put down a six pack without thinking twice."
"thanks again larry bell."
"O - Great summer beer. Light, sweet, sour and not to heavy. Really liked it."
"Light body, with refreshing carbonation. Very easy to drink. Very nice for hot weather."
"Thanks to Thirstybird for sharing. Pours a pale hazy yellow with a loose, quarter inch bright white head. Head eventually dissipates into a soapy skim and a tight white band around the perimeter of the bowl. Nose expresses wheat, sour mash and a trace of citrus. Flavors are slightly bready with a light, lemony tartness. Mouthfeel is light in body with a pleasant, easy carbonation. A very refreshing berliner weisse. I wish this was available locally because it is a perfect session beer for summer - refreshing on a hot day."
"Overall an average beer. I like the tartness in the finish. I can see this paired well with the right food, but would not drink again by itself."
"From my weekend notes: Having trouble making up my mind about this beer. On the one hand, it’s fascinating, with a layered, rolling flavor that never stays in one place. On the other, it’s an underhopped, mildly sweet weak wheat beer. The former is based in curiosity, the latter in cynicism. The truth is closer to Famous Potatoes. In the end, the tartness keeps bringing me back, so I’m pretty sure I like this beer."
"O - Had a number of people suggest that this brew had a pleasant sourness that was remarkable for the price, but the overwhelming corn flavor and moderate tartness is not quite what I was expecting. This bottle comes across as a muddled Kolsch, but I'll definitely seek the beer out on draft and review again. Cheers,"
"This is a good beginners sour that wont scare anyone away."
"Draught @ Headkeeper: This one pours a cloudy, straw yellow color. There was a fairly small white head that dropped off rather quickly. No lacing. Nice aroma. Mainly lemon and wheat notes. The taste is also good. Decent wheat flavor and body. There is a bit of a tart lemon taste to the beer. Very refreshing and easy to drink."
"M: Featherweight body and medium sparkling carbonation. Nice fizz on tongue. "
""
"O: Can't say I cared for this one very much, but it was starting to grow on me a little."
"The taste is surprising -- fruity malts up front, with tart citrus notes dancing around the tongue. The slightly hoppy finish closes it out with gracefulness. A delightful light beer for the warm months, and one I'd return to again."
"This is simply a fantastic summer session beer. It's light-bodied, low ABV, and refreshing, but still incredibly flavorful. This is a revelation for me - I never would have designed a beer like this, but now that I've had it, it seems so obvious. I could drink it all day long."
"O - This is a fantastic summer session beer coming in at 4% abv. While it has it's flaws both in finish and appearance, I find this beer extremely pleasant and light on the palate, which is fantastic for PA heat and humidity."
"Overall this is not a good beer, even for a session beer. By far the worst beer I have had in a while. Back to the drawing board for Bells on this sessionable pale wheat ale."
"Feels light in body and a bit thin. A little crisp and wetting to the palate."
"Overall-Smell and Taste are nothing to go crazy about, but it's extremely easy to drink. Perfect carbonation, goes down easy. Alot of times Wheats are way overly carbonation, but this one very drinkable and smooth."
"This is one of the palest wheat beers I've ever seen. It's a crystal clear yellow with a foamy white head. The nose is mostly wheat with a touch of soured lemon. The palate is susprisingly nice and refreshing. The wheat is still prevalent but the tart fruity notes are the main focus. Mouthfeel is fluid and finishes semi-dry and clean. Overall, this is an impressive brew that could serve as nice alternative to white wine."
"Light mouthfeel that is very drinkable. Great, tasty, summer session beer."
"D- I couldn't drink more than one. It's just a bit sour for my taste."
"Poured from the bottle, only a slight haze differentiates the look of this beer from an adjunct lager, with its straw yellow color and big, fluffy white head. The aroma is a bit dull but clean, with a musty combination of mild wheat and yeast characteristics. The flavor is much more enticing, though, with a crisp, refreshing lemon-orange citrus tartness that combines well with a mellow wheatiness. The very-fine, active carbonation complements the flavors to energize the tartness and make the beer even more refreshing. Overall, the flavor profile is quite interesting and different, and while the tartness is a bit strange at first, I grew to enjoy this beer as a drinkable and refreshing change-of-pace."
"O: What's with all the low reviews? Oh well... to each their own I guess."
"O: It feels like there is a big disconnect with the style and the yeast used."
"O: All right; nothing spectacular. For the intended style, it's okay."
"This is clean, light, and crisp - I think for the style it's pretty appropriate. Like the tartness."
"Pours very pale gold with fizzy, soda-like head. No head retention or lacing. Aroma is a sort of musty sour apple. There's not much to the flavor except for a little sourness, kind of like a watery cider. Carbonation is high and kind of a harsh fizzy. Overall, it's hard to find much redeeming about this one."
"O - Refreshing with a mellow flavor, but still keeps my interest. I wish more breweries made Berliner weisse."
"Cheers!"
"Cloudy pineapple juice body with fleeting white head that leaves some lacing. Aroma of slight wheat, subtle floral, and some unwanted impressions of vomit. Tastes of light fruit juice, wheat, floral notes, esters of banana or slight vanilla. Light bodied with light carbonation. Artificial flavors, nauseating aroma, annoyingly tart."
"O - An interesting beer. I enjoyed this one but I don't think I would buy this one again with other choices available."
"Drinkability high, a very quaffable, refreshing brew, it would be great in warm weather as well as with food, especially something spicy. I'd like a bit more pucker, but that would probably cut out some of the crowd."
"I feel bad about not really liking this beer. It would be great when paired appropriately, but it just doesn't float my boat."
"It's ok. Too much emphasis on sour flavors in my opinion. Fairly drinkable though."
"O: Certainly refreshing, a little heavy on the wheat. A good summer beer, but I would like to give it another shot at some point."
"If you can get past the initial shock of the unique, unexpected flavor, it's not a bad beer. But Bell's could do better with its ""session"" beer."
"O: A bit of a strange one... great if you like tart cherries and lemons."
"O: certainly something sessionable. Another single I wish I had another one."
"Overall this is a very refreshing and enjoyable beer. I am a little new to sour/funky beers, but this reminds me of a light version of a lambic or gueuze. Would have this again."
"O- Overall this is a strange beer for me. The tartness of this beer is very pleasing, but there is not much else going on here. It is designed to be a session beer and it is drinkable, but this beer needs a better backbone and the aroma was unpleasant. But in a strange way there is something about this beer that kinda works for me, it is very refreshing and pleasantly sour. I am a little new to sour beers, but I have always loved sour candy and this packs a nice sour punch. The sourness kinda dulls the graininess of the beer the more I drink it."
"Oarsman is one of the best American Pale Wheat Ale I have ever had. Now, I do love me some Gumballhead and New Glarus makes a hoppy wheat beer that I love too, but Oarsman manages to be an amazing beer without steering very far from the typical American wheat beers that we have all become so bored with. It is light, simple, refreshing and low alcohol, but that little snap of acid makes it soooo good. The other American Wheat beers that I do like are really a new style of wheat beers, more like wheat based Pale Ales. Oarsmen is like a more interesting Easy Street or Bully Wheat. Or maybe its the American version of Berliner Weiss. But unlike the virtually extinct Berliner Weiss, Oarsman is actually available to consumers. My only complaint is that a $9.49 6pk is hard to think of like a session beer."
"O: This is very drinkable and goes well with the war weather."
"Pouring a light straw yellow with a thin, white head that rises briefly before falling off to a ring, this isn't the best looking beer. The nose is refreshing. Tart, mildly lactic with a raw, wheaty aroma with some mild rotting fruit present, this is pretty enjoyable. Very doughy, this is quite enjoyable. The palate opens with a blend of lactic and lemony tartness, both light, both refreshing. A little doughy on the mid-palate, there's some wheat that appears. The finish is disappointing, though. Watery and surprisingly bland, the acids disappear leaving no real sign of their presence, and the high carbonation does further scrub them right off. The watery finish also really shows off how light this beer is in body. Adding the yeast does alleviate this problem, but it introduces another - it muddles up the acidity and tartness. All told, a solid APWA, but not the best Berliner Weiss. Very drinkable, especially for the price."
"Overall a good session beer. With it at only 4% you can drink more than a few at a sitting. Good lawnmower beer."
"Pretty boring. Not sure why they have this in the rotation when Oberon is similar but tastes way better in my opinion. oh well."
"O: I wasn't sure what to expect with this one - it was surprising in more ways than one and turned out to be a tasty and refreshing. Definitely a well-crafted uber-light session beer that would pair very nicely with a variety of dishes. Well done, Bell's."
"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass. The beer is very light looking. Very clean and clear brew with some bubbles rising periodically. The Head wasn't too much of anything really. The smell had something like a funky aroma, not strong like a lambic but very light hint of it in there. That little hint from the nose come over onto the tongue with each sip. It's quite a different beer. I don't recall having something similar to this before. Not a bad brew at all, but not my favorite."
"Overall it is a great hot weather beer. Very easy going, very efreshing, very tasty."
"Overall: This is an impressive beer. I was not sure what to expect with this beer. I really enjoyed this beer I will be drinking this beer on those hot days of summer when a session beer is needed! Flavorful and light on the palate; it tastes very fresh!"
"Overall: I'm always a fan of lower ABV beers and this one packs a good amount of flavor to style. Could have been better IMO but pleasantly surprising simultaneously."
"O: Not bad, glad I tried it, but don't know if I could have more than one. Seems like this is a good session brew for a cider/wheat ale fan. Not a must try, but you could do a lot worse."
"O - A good session ale that keeps things intersesting. Not something I'd drink everyday, but something I could drink ALL day and still remain sober."
"D - If it were cold after mowing the lawn on a hot day, yeah I'd enjoy it. But, the same could be said of most beers. Perhaps a good beer for the beach?"
"Light/medium body, a very sharp effervescence, tart to the point of biting. A bread like note in the aftertaste. Listed as a sour ale at the bar, I was expecting something different. Nothing really bad here, just not what I expected. Tastes like someone squeezed a lemon in my wheat ale. Alright, I reckon."
"O: I have heard such varying opinions on this beer I wasn't sure what I would be getting, but I liked this one. Nice and refreshing."
"O- although not my favorite style, the sour mash thing added an interesting twist. one i can see checking out again next season. i like the low alcohol aspect of it."
"It's a good session beer, though I would fear my acid reflux issue coming into play if I had very many. As long as a person doesn't mind this particular style, they will probably find it a refreshing and simple beer. I really enjoyed this one."
"D - A nice interpretation of a wheat ale. With its sessionability and enticing sour notes, it is must try."
"D/M: Crisp and drinkable. Not too sour, slightly sweet and drinkable."
"Pale and perfectly transparent in appearance, my beer lacks head retention and lacing. The faint dought aroma offers little hint of what is to follow. The taste is pleasantly sour up front with a light malt undertone at the finish. It is not as sour as a Berlinerweiss, and leaves a prickly mouthfeel. Quite drinkable."
"Snappy, moderate carbonation and ample mouthfeel. Sessionable....though I despise the term. Could, and have drunk these en masse, all while maintaining an Old Spice-like coolness. Well done, Bell's."
"Overall this isn't anything that will blow your socks off, but it does a good job of being a thirst quencher and palate refresher. I will be looking to try this again sometime really fresh."
"This one is a bit odd, but is much better as a wheat beer than Oberon, IMO. This one in the summer would be awesome. The flavor could be much better, but as something to drink with food, not a bad choice, and the grainy flavors that come out will be familiar to BMC drinkers. Might be a good choice to get newbies started on :)"
"I expected more of a head from this beer. About 1/4"" white which rapidly diminished to a thin ring around the top. Clear, pale gold with lots of bubbles rising to the top, good lacing. Initial tart taste, didn't detect much hop presence. For an ale, this tastes an awful lot like a lager. Light, fizzy mouthfeel. Goes down pretty easy, I could drink a few of these."
"A great idea. A tart, almost wild ale like session. Though this is not a very well made beer. A Calabaza Blanca rip off. Nothing I would recommend."
"In the words of Larry David: ""Intresting"". A funky mash-up of a Pale Lager, Wheat Beer, and Sour."
"D - Hmm, if it wasn't for the tire warehouse-like nuances in here this would be quite good. Light, tart, lemony...all good on a spring or summer day."
"Alright, here is where the lemon notes come into play, the flavors have a great light clean finish, not super sour or puckering, just really clean and crisp, really awesome. i'm really impressed with this beer, this is an awesome beer for $10 6-packs. This summer i'm going to buy a case do doubt. I could probally go through it in a week without trying."
"D - Incredibly drinkable, perfect for a refreshing hot day beer. Perfect amount of tartness, this would be a good into to the ""sour world""."
"This is pretty underwhelming honestly. The tartness keeps it from being an easy drinker but the complexity isn't there to keep it in the league of a solid Berliner or wild. Just not a fan of this one really."
"Pours Budweiser gold with ample white head. Slight funk and tartness on the nose. Light lemony sourness on the palate. Taste is not as funky as the smell. Light bodied with refreshing high carbonation. An enjoyable session brew for a hot summer day. Wish I had regular access to this."
"If you are new to Bells try Two Hearted Ale...a fantasitc IPA."
"Mouthfeel / Drinkability - Very smooth and slightly bitter The finish is a very refreshing blast of orange and citrus. Tastes more of like an orange drink as opposed to a beer. It is quite good, though."
"more."
"D: I don't understand the hate on this beer--maybe because it was incorrectly labeled as a wild (wtf?) for a while--but this is a very nice berliner-weisse-like wheat beer; I could drink these all day, especially in the summer. What a great, slightly tart, refreshing session beer!"
"O - Bell's Oarsman shows slight attributes of a Berliner Weiss from the faintly acidic aroma to the citrus taste and tart feel, but this beer, to me, is really just a notch above a bland light lager. It's not offensive and while there's no off flavors or poor production evident, there's almost nothing that sets it apart from said lager. Easy drinking, absolutely. Worth drinking? Maybe as a lawnmower beer."
"Berliner Weisse is a hard to find style, but this one definitely falls within the category. Light, crisp, and citrusy with some healthy tartness-this is a perfect thirst quencher, and a fantastic summer beer. If only it was summer..."
"D: I would not get this one again. Just did nothing for me and it really was not a good example of the style for me."
"This is a Bell's brew?? For a second I thought I was drinking a Bud Light with Lime. Ok maybe a bit harsh, but certainly not a good brew from a brewery of Bell's caliber. Pour was pale yellow and flat. Taste was crisp but bland. A few nice tones of lemon and orange, but certainly not enough to wet the D Train's train whistle."
"This is an awesome session beer, I wish it was bottles in liter plastic bottles and sold every four feet on the sidewalk."
"D- Designed as a session beer...this fulfills it's mission with the style. Not a huge American wheat fan but this is what it is. I don't care for the overt tartness with no other body behind it....but....Bell's accomplished their goal. A great summer session drink better than any macro junk. That said....likely my last taste."
"D - Well it tastes a heck of a lot better than most light lagers and surely better than most BMC. Light, refreshing and low ABV with a nice splash of flavor. Pretty much the definition of ""Sessionable"""
"D - Drinkable, but not particularly desirable."
"D - This is a good Summer session brew. Very refreshing. Super low ABV. I'd happily grab a sixer of this if I could find it, shove it in a cooler before a mid-Summer camping trip. This is a very simple beer that could be a good gateway brew for the uninitiated."
"M/D. The mouthfeel is a smooth light bodied crisp clean feel that is a nice easy drinking beer."
"Reminded me a lot of a sweeter Corona. This beer has its place on a hot day but for the most part is weak, flavorless and uncomplex. I would understand this beer better if it had a somewhat pleasing taste, alas it's pretty much meh, not terrible, not loveable - the definition of a C beer for me."
"Light toasted grain notes initially. Apple and honey wheat malt follows, with a lemony, slightly sourish edge. Herbal, somewhat peppery, grassy hop finish, with lingering tart lemon acidity. Light body with a sparkly feel. Not overwhelmingly complex, but a nice refreshing beer."
"M:"
"Very pale straw colored brew. Small white head. Fair amount of rising carbonation. Scent is mainly a light sweet scent, maybe a hint of sourness or something. Taste is pretty cool, its like a light filtered wheat with some light sourness, probably from the yeast. Light bodied. Very nice light filtered wheat"
"This is light bodied and prickly with a high level of carbonation. Very easy drinking with an alcohol level that is quite suppressed making this very sessionable. The sour mashing aspect is evident throughout this brew and the face that it is a light wheat beer has me sold that this is a berliner weisse more so than an american pale wheat ale. I will be picking plenty of this brew up come summertime."
"Fine for what it is, but not very interesting. Nothing to make it separate from others in category. Still a good drink for a light lunch or warm afternoon."
"Overall I thought this was a pretty average brew. I see what bell's was going for, but I feel like this beer could have had a tad more wheat flavor to help balance it out. I will probably revisit this beer in the summer but till then I stick to more flavorful beer."
"Very drinkable, a good session beer for a hot day."
"D- Probably one I would pass on again."
" A Great Session Beer! Finally something to enjoy without sacrificing my sobriety so quickly."
"D- I really disliked this beer. The tartness, while intentional, really didn't mesh well for me. Won't be drinking this again."
"D- it was a struggle to get through this. not one to purchase as a sit down beer. This would be a cheapy purchase."
"D - I am surprised this one came from Bell's. This is a pretty weak APWA...really grainy and bready with a good, but very artificial, lemon flavor throughout it. I think I'll go with a two hearted next time..."
"This one took some time to get used to. At first I considered dumping it, but after a few more swigs I was glad I didn't. After my palate adjusted, this became fairly enjoyable."
"I had hesitated getting any of this, sure it would be another boring pale wheat. Only when stumbled upon the fact that it was a sourmash wheat did I get interested. Essentially, this an American spin on a Berliner Weiss, with nice lactic notes and a clean, crisp, sparkling sourness. It's not as tart as the best of the Berliners, and its more sparkly and lighter. There is also a very slight sweet breadiness in the finish, which doesn't come through at all in the mouthfeel, but does in the taste. The only other sourmash wheat I've had is the one from Moonlight, and this one is much less grainy and cleaner tasting. I suppose Telegraph wheat bears a passing resemblance as well. I think this is bound to be a misunderstood beer, and I'm not surprised to see scores all over the place. Personally, I ""get"" this beer and enjoy it. A very pleasant surprise."
"Light bodied, average carbonation. No aftertaste. Pretty easy to drink. I'm glad I had a chance to try this. Decent, but at the same time, this does not impress me much."
"Medium bodied with tight carbonation up front followed by a slightly tart, spicy yet sweet flavor. A decent amount of bready yeast adds to the feel and there is a decent amount of citrus fruit. The prominent flavor is lemon juice with hints of pepper and clove. This beer is refreshing and easy to drink but it tastes like a lemon juice spritzer. I guess I could down a bunch of these on a hot summer day but I don't really like the flavor or the dry lingering tart citrus finish."
"This is very drinkable and would be perfect on a hot summer day."
"Pours a light golden yellow with a big white cap that took its time fading. The aroma is a nice mix of straw with some lemon and wheat notes. Not overpowering. This is starting to remind me of a berliner weisse, definitely not a wild ale. Slight amount of sourness but not puckery. tart lemons with that straw to wheat grains. Nice crsip carbonation with a light body and mouthfeel. This is a great beer for a summer day or night. This definitely leans toward berliner weisse."
"Poured into a unbranded tulip, this ale has a light lemon yellow body. It is clear, with lots of bubbles rising up, maybe a 1/2 inch of head that fades quickly leaving no lacing. Some lemon and wheat notes in the smell, a bit tart, nice. Taste is just what my nose led me to believe but more pronounced...tart lemons and wheat with perhaps a touch of pepper - has a very nice flavor to it. Lighter bodied, and fairly dry, but very refreshing. Certainly not a Wild Ale, so really just reviewed it to taste - a nice, sessionable wheat beer (more like a berliner imo.)"
"Worth checking out as in my experience this is a pretty unique beer- tart, but light and intended for sessioning."
"Overall - An nice refreshing brew. A perfect brew for a hot summer day out on the lake, or possibly by the grill. Not really something I'd drink in early January which it is right now, but good nonetheless."
"D- Very drinkable and thirst quenching on a hot summer day. The slight sourness is what makes this beer great"
"(D)- A wild ale? More like a Berliner Weisse in my opinion. It has a nice light tartness to it, but otherwise a very mild/light-bodied beer that drinks more like a lager, but an easy drinking one at that."
"Drinkability: It's alright for a light ale best suited to easy, refreshing drinking outdoors in the warmer months."
"So you can feel better while drinking it."
"I hope to God this was a bad bottle and will definitely pick up another at some point. I've heard things about the oarsman and they've all been positive. This one however, is one oarsman that out to sea without his oars.... haha, wow."
"Pours a cloudy wheat yellow orange color with a thick white head and tons of lacing. Smells of apples, citrus, and wheat. Tastes of sour apple flavor, wheat malts, some hops, and a little orange. Mouthfeel is medium with a good carbonation background. Drinkability is high."
"Into the second bottle--I bought a six pack and must soldier on--the beer seems to improve. On second thought, though, what doesn't?"
"This beer poured an almost straw yellow color, wit very small head that dispated quickly. The smell was minimal. The taste was rather stale, and there was hints of some lemon, or other citrus. I found the taste offensive and unpleasent, and I couldnt even finish one. Overall I found this horrible, and I was disapointed that such an abolation from my one of my favirote brewers could be sold."
"This is decent and a pretty easy drinker, but it's also a bit boring and thin. Less flavor than other Berliner Weiss beers I have had, with only minimal tartness. An interesting attempt by Bell's, but not a huge success in my opinion."
"D: Not a white-whale by any stretch, but definitely a refreshing brew with a slight twang. As noted above, I could go through many of these in one sitting."
"Oarsman Ale is a pretty solid beer. After passing over it several times, I'm glad to have picked up a bottle. I've enjoyed it just fine."
"D: Fairly drinkable, but I think this needs some tweaks. Berliner Weisse is an underappreciated style, and with work they could be at the top of it."
"D: Glad I tried it, but I don't think I'll drink another one of these. It was good, but was missing some ""omph."" However it was my first Berliner Wiesse, so what do I know?"
"Mildly sharp lactic acid tartness, with wheaty creaminess settling in after the initial tart snap. Firm wheat flavor, sour crabapple, and mild grape notes, soft and ethereal. Even carbonation, soft feel, not even approaching puckering, rather a mild pleasant tartness. Sublime in it's simplicity, this is something i'd crave on a hot summer day. Ultimately sessionable at 4%, and sadly misunderstood."
"D: Goes down easily, not filling, mild kick, not a good representation of the style. I actually really enjoyed this beer. However, it seemed more in line with a berlinerweisse than an American Wild. I'd buy this again for sure."
"overall, i really enjoyed this brew"
"D: I could drink this beer all day long during the warmer months although I'd want to mix in a bigger beer once in a while throughout."
"The palate is well carbonated until the finish. The carbonation and tart, sour flavors make this beer more sessionable than I expected."
"D- this is a fantastic true session beer. Ridiculously easy to drink, great tasting, not too powerful...love this"
"D - Delicious warm-weather beer. More substantial than just dropping a lemon in a hefe. Could easily enjoy several of these in an afternoon of puttering or just hanging out. The sourness might eventually become cloying, but it would be worth finding out."
"Taste is very light, just a hint of sweetness. Not a bad beer at the end of the evening. A little light in the mouthfeel, but easily a session beer."
"Others, particularly those fond of wild ale, may well enjoy this. I found it so-so; a nice and distinct beer, but undeniably sour, a bit thin in content, and not one to which I'll return anytime soon."
"Overall, I like where this one is going. What's with the low ratings? This is a nice, tart, refreshing wheat ale, and a true session beer."
"Drinkability: This certainly is a simple, easy drinking brew. It's clean, crisp, and pretty refreshing. My beef is it doesn't really pack much of a punch in the flavor department. Still, I'm glad I got a chance to try it. Cheers!"
"Pours a clear straw yellow with a typical white head - not inspiring, but this turns out to be the beer's weakest point. Aroma is not strong, but is crisp, yeasty and a little lemony. Flavor is better - yeasty and rather lemony, even somewhat tart. Texture is smooth, just a teensy watery but acceptable. Maybe this bottle came from what was not their best batch."
"Flavorful, but it is a 4% ""session"" brew. Good for tailgating, so I won't go into the game Trashed."
"D-NOT...this was a drain pour for me."
"drinkability: this could be fabulous if improved a little on the flavor. needs more acidity/citrus/sour power"
"D: Really good. An easy-drinking summer beer."
"Pretty light in body and carbonation, it does go down pretty smooth. Now knowing what I'm dealing with, I'll have to try it again on a hot summer day to see how refreshing the Oarsman is, and if I'm looking for something refreshing between now and then, I'll probably head in a different direction. It's definitely different than any other ""session ale"" I've had before... for better or for worse."
"Overall, very different, and a good choice for a flavorful session beer."
"I would perhaps use this as a stepping-stone into the sour world of beer for the uninitiated. If they like it, I'll tell them, ""It's just the tip of the iceberg, baby."" Check my review for White Birch's Berliner Weisse, it's a much better example of the style."
"A great session, the second bottle is better than the first."
"Overall- A very unique sessionable beer. I really enjoy it and definitely plan to purchase additional six packs. Some of the more experimental Bell's beers doesn't work for me but this beer I feel is very well crafted, light, and interesting enough make it part of my rotation. I would not claim this beer is outstanding but it is very solid."
"I see that this beer was placed in a different category. Makes a lot more sense than the original listing as an American pale wheat ale."
"Nice sour beer, very drinkable, very thirst quenching. This would make a very nice summer beer. Not sure this fits as an American Pale Wheat Ale - sourness doesn't fit. Recommending changing style to american wild ale."
"Pours a semi hazy golden color with a little fizzy head that lines the glass. Smells of light citrus fruits with some hops/malts. Some booze is noted as well. Taste is slightly water, slightly bitter. A nice light tasting beer to enjoy with dinner. Mouthfeel is light bodied. Drinkability is mediocre. Not an eye opener but not something I would turn away."
"I saw a couple of reviews on this one so I gave it an agressive pour. And was pretty happy with the results. Had a nice two fingered white head. Head hung around for a little while. Not a lot of lacing going on. Ale itself was a cloudy light yellow. Not a lot of smell. I mean almost nothing. Just maybe some light grain notes. Tasted very light as well. Had a slight bitter tart going on. Maybe a slight sweet aftertaste. But nothing really standing out. Felt average in the mouth. Carbonation I thought was right. I dont know who Bells is trying to market this ale to. All and all there was nothing there to make you want to buy this ale again."
"D= Crazy drinkable. Pretty much the best American pale wheat beer I have had to date. That tartness is fantastically refreshing, making this a beer I would gladly drink a few of on a hot summer's day."
"drinkability is good and one i could see myself drinking anytime of year"
"this is pretty light and easy overall, would do well on a warm summer day."
"Overall: A simple beer, light in body with a lot of acidity to it. This would be great during a night of drinking to awake the palate. Nothing too fancy about it, and while I liked the one I had, I won't be searching any more out soon."
"I poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a SA perfect pint glsss. The pour is hazy yellow with a fizzy litle head. The aroma is tart, mostly lemon. Tart lemony flavor, with a dry finish. Very light body, acidic mouthfeel, and highly carbonated. An ok beer, I was expecting a bit more from it. On a hot day it would be refreshting."
"Likewise, the 4% abv paired with ultra-lite flavor and watery consistency gives this a pretty high drinkability. If you don't mind the pucker inducing bitterness I imagine you could drink these all day and night; but why would you really want to?"
"Poured from bottle into tumbler at refrigerator temperature. Oarsman pours with a thin, highly-effervescent head which sticks around in a rim until the end of the glass. Mouthfeel is pleasantly thin with a heavy taste of wheat and citric acid (not lemon). This acid taste is initially off-putting but quickly gains favor. Recommended."
"D - Drinks like a light beer without the crappy light beer taste."
"D - I guess if I was hot and sweaty it would have been refreshing."
"This is only the second ""berliner weisse"" that I have had the chance to enjoy (and he last ine I had was about three years ago). I understand that Bell's did not intend this to be a berliner weisse or american pale wheat, but something in between. Thin white head dissapears after a few seconds. Appearance is a light, clear yellow. Aroma is primarily citrus hints. Flavor is a strong, citrus tinged tartness. Some hints of pilsner maltiness can be tasted in the background. Tartness is pretty strong to my tastes, and about at the limit for what I would want for a refreshing summer beer. I'll probably purchase this again next year in July or August to enjoy after yardwork."
"In my opinion not a very good product from the people at Bell's. Maybe they don't like this style either."
"D - Great drinkable summer beer. I'd almost say I prefer this to Oberon (minus the lack of ABV). Great beer to bring to a party or to session. This is a beer that I COULD drink all night, but I wouldn't because I'd never get a buzz (probably good for some people). Glad I tried it, but I'm not so sure I'll buy any more."
"O: This would make a nice stepping stone to sour beers for the uninitiated."
"D: I'd love another. I'd buy 6 for the summer time. Very enjoyable session beer."
"Drinkability - I think immensely. I really enjoy this and could easily session a six pack of this in the summer like it ain't no thang. I will for sure pick this up in the summer when I am back home. A refreshing beverage."
"This beer pours a hazy yellow color. The head is one inch in height, and recedes quickly into minimal lacing. The aroma is of horse blanket, wet hay, acid, and barnyard. Very pleasant. The taste is earthier than the aroma. Dirt, hay, horse blanket with a hint of tartness in the finish. It is too dirty fo my liking, but not all out bad. The mouthfeel is light bodied, and slightly watery. Watery even for a Berlinerweisse (if the is in fact what this beer is trying to be as I have heard). Overall, this is a beer that I am just not feeling. I will probably not drink this beer again."
"On another positive note, it is light enough to consume quickly and not strong enough to offend. I had this on tap during the Bell's Philly Beer Week event and really enjoyed it. Just to be sure that the bottle wasn't old, I checked my batch number (9861) on the Bell's website and confirmed that it had been bottled on 8-16-2010 and should be good for 6 months. If it has that long a shelf life, why does it taste like sun-drenched Heineken after a mere 60 days?"
"Bleached white head, delicate and airy foam, as it dissolves you think you're watching a film on fast forward, some dimpling and the lacing stays around much longer than expected at first. Extremely pale yellow color, if with a slight luminescence, the haze prevents crystal clear transparency, big stream of bubbles more or less right in the middle of the normal pint glass. Lemongrass, wheat, sage, pepper, pretzel dough, mandarin orange zest, green apple and apricot to peach pit fruit scents, light yeasty funk. Light-bodied plus, the carbonation has enough toughness and tight weave to keep what weight is there present through to the end. Very citrusy, tart lemon, orange burst. Yeast, sourdough, the wheat tastes grainy and unprocessed. Close to no fruit, some sour apple, pear and apricot. In the back half, though, there's a glancing brush of honey and caramel. Have to say it has a lively, crackling presence in the mouth, no way you are not noticing it there. Low ABV helps but overall bitterness makes this a two bottle tops in a sitting beer pour moi."
"D: Easy, make that EASY, to drink. Small ABV, good flavor + about as 'session-able' as they come. May not be to everyone's liking, but I'm glad I got a chance to enjoy this one. A hearty thanks to you, Derek."
"On the strength of too many offerings to mention here, Bell's is a mainstay in my top-10 American breweries of all-time. The idea behind Oarsman Ale was a good one, but the Berliner weissbier-like sourness might not have been the best way to go."
"This is a perfect example of a session beer. Low abv, refreshing, and decent flavor. It's good for what it is."
"This pours the hazy pale straw color that I would expect from a BW. There was no head really to speak of. The aroma is like burnt popcorn, I'm sorry but it's as unpleasant as walking into a kitchen and saying ""hey, who burned something"". The taste is sour like really sour. The flavor is acidic and the malts are hidden behind the taste. This is citric and harsh. The odd thing I have to say about it is this is really feels good for the mouth, if only it had tasted better. This is very drinkable if it tasted better. I don't recommend you try this I really didn't like it. But if you like sour and acidic, which is to the style go for it."
"More like an experimentation. I give them credit for trying something different, but I feel that the beer lacks a personality/identity."
"A nice little beer from Bells here... I'm not the biggest. Wheat fan so the scores aren't that high here but this was pretty good..."
"My brother bought a sixer o' this and hated it, so I smilingly inherited some free beer. Always welcome. It pours a hazy pale straw, not entirely unlike lemonade, topped by a bit less than a finger of relatively short-lived white micro-foam. The nose is basically a two-pronged attack consisting of lemon zest and some mildly funky wheat and rice. The taste reminds me of a hardy lemonade, with a touch of Squirt for extra citrus flavor and the carbonation. This doesn't really mean I think it's bad, just not great. The body is pretty light, with a light moderate carbonation and a fairly refreshing feel and finish. Overall, it's very drinkable, but I'm just not too enthused about it."
"Oarsman looks very nice in my pint glass  It's light straw, almost a white wine color. A small ring of foam leaves behind decent lace. I also observed some slow visible carbonation.  A nice start!  "
""
""
""
"The mouthfeel was medium/light. There was a steady stream of carbonation from the etching in the glass. I really like the label art too."
"D= Overall I was disappointed with this beer from Bell's glad I just tryed it at a sampling wouldn't waste my money buying a bottle or six pack probably overpriced. This really isn't my favorite style of beer but I do enjoy Bell's just not this one. To me it's just a dressed up miller high life."
"D- Very easy to drink, with how light it is and only a 4% abv I could drink this all day. Weather I would or not would depend on if i got sick of the flavor but drinkability wise it is very easy to drink."
"Mouthfeel is very light in body, with a light carbonation, crisp, bright and very refreshing. Clean. Ridiculously drinkable."
"Drinkability: Very refreshing and probably a good beer for a hot summer day, but just a little short on aroma and flavor for my liking."
"Hazy, pale lemon yellow body. Thin bubbly off white head. very little lace. Aroma is vibrant, tangy (if an aroma can be tangy, that is), tart and lemony. Spritzy carbonation gives this beer some palate scrubbing potential. Body is close to medium. Light bready base of malt with bright, tart, lemony and citric overtones. Acidic feel to it with a dry finish. Not bad for what it is."
"D: Decent summer beer. Pretty easy drinking, not much else going for it though."
"Pours a medium yellow with a frothy white head that faded fast. The smell indicates the ""sour"" beers like those of jolly pumpkin, mostly a light citrus smell with yeast notes. The beer has a very light flavor, sour and tart, but very refreshing. This would be excellent on a hot summer day. A very light mouthfeel, not much flavor power, but what is there does get the job done. This beer is interesting, very refreshing as mentioned, but would have more than a couple due to the nature of the beer, but still enjoyable."
"Oarsman Ale is a rather mediocre release from Bell's. I know it was initially characterized as a Berliner Weissbier. It might be a little reminiscent of that, but it's nowhere near as tart as others I've experienced in that style. The American Pale Wheat characterization is more appropriate. Whatever style it may be, Oarsman Ale is a little short on everything - aromatics and flavor most notably. It's worth a try, but I wouldn't pick up another six pack (unless it was roasting outside)."
"12 ounce bottle, Batch #9861, bottled on 8/16/2010. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours a slightly hazy straw gold color with about an inch white head. Head retention is decent, but not much lacing at all. Aroma is wheat and some light citrus (lemon). The brew tastes like tart lemon, wheat, and a little bit of pepper. Mouthfeel/body is light, it's a bit dry and crisp with low/moderate carbonation. Drinkability is very good, it's really smooth and refreshing. I think it's a great choice as a session beer, and it's also a good brew to drink at the end of a night when I'm looking for something that's still tasty, but has a pretty low ABV as well."
"After seeing this listed here as an American pale wheat, I checked the brewery's website to see how they classify it, because my impression was that of a Berliner Weiss. Bell's does not make reference to that style, but they have certainly created a very refreshingly tart wheat - Prickly, lemony tartness up front, with a smooth body and sliglty dry finish. Only detracton was a bit of grainyness near the end as the beer warmed."
"D- This beer is very drinkable. The ABV being so low makes this beer a session beer and then some. Bell's did a great job like usual on this beer. I am very glad to have gotten to try this and look forward to a lot more....a lot more!"
"This is a low alcohol beer making it sessionable, however, and I found the beer to be quite refreshing. Not a fall beer per se but I would enjoy it occasionally year round."
"D- Clean with a light tartness. Very simple and highly sessionable."
"This is an interesting one. I know the style is looked down on by some, but I absolutely have nothing against the style. This one just doesn't have the bit extra to put it over. I might even rate this higher as a kolsch. As it is, it could certainly use more hops and malts as well as having a better balance. I'm used to such goodness from Bell's. At least it's above average."
"d - A pretty average pale/wheat ale. Wasn't bad, but nothing really stood out in the smell or taste. Wouldn't seek out again."
"Served with a finger of white head that fades to a thin layer. Color is a very slightly hazed dark straw yellow. A very basic beer. Not too much on the nose. Grain with grassy hops mainly. In the background is some sharp wild notes. Grain, grassy hops, and some light funk and wild notes. Not a whole lot going on here. Fizzy, smooth, with a touch of funk. Lighter bodied with a lower amount of carbonation. Ends very very clean."
"This beer pours with a pale straw color with about a finger of head on top. The head disappears quickly leaving a haze on top. The aroma gives off hints of sour mash underneath the wheaty hues which dominate the smell. Some of those ever-so-slight sour notes make their way into the flavor, but recede quickly into some pear. This finish on the beer evaporates so hastily that you almost forget you just took a sip of beer."
"Oarsman seems to take a reverse procession than what beers normally do. The usual transition is from a creamy-sweet start into a dry-acidic finish. This beer starts with the lemony-acidic start into a froathy-bready-earthy finish. Although this beer is characterful, drinkable, and complex it's still an American Wheat Ale that pales in comparison to traditional German Hefeweizens."
"I'll say it again, I can't believe this is a Bell's beer. I have never had a Bells beer that is this bland."
"Again, if it were cleaner and drier it would be more drinkable, but still pretty smooth and light."
"I rarely find an APWA I enjoy, but this one was quite good. The spice is added in correct measure, and the wheat-bread note is successful as well."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable, its light and refreshing, but has a good wheat taste, could have benefited from being a little more flavorful though."
"2. The label art - its not terribly appealing to begin with and it doesn't fit in with the rest of the brands labels"
"Notes: Interesting offering from Bell's."
"M/D - Mouthfeel is light but not watery and leaves some tingle on the tongue. Very drinkable beer for those who enjoy the style."
"Nice brew...american wheat with some hints of Berliner Weisse...a perfect amount of tartness...sour apple like but not real dominant...just a nice light impression of it....basic wheat base...light side of medium bodied...interesting beer that would have place in the right situation for me...looks flat in the glass"
"12oz bottle into a DFH Signature glass pours a crisp bubbly straw yellow with a nice frothy off white head that diminishes to a thin layer and leaves slight lacing on the glass. Aroma is tart fruit and sweet malts with mild citrus hops. The taste is a nice kick of tart fruit with sweet malts nicely backing them up. The beer is quite light and smooth with nice carbonation. This is a very enjoyable wheat beer, one that I can easily enjoy on a hot day or a cool evening."
"Overall- seems to me more like a berliner weisse, or atleast more similar to the few I have tried. If reviewed to that style this would probably recieve an A from me. This is definitly a strange brew, thus the widely varried ratings, I like it."
"A very unusual beer. It could grow on you."
"drinkability: smooth,refreshing and goes down easy. However it starts getting a bit sweet towards the end of glass. I only have a single of it so I can't say if it would be too sweet to have more than one in a row. This one went down well, could see a few going down well on a hot day but am also worried it may get too sweet to really enjoy more than one or two at a time."
"D: I get what they were going for here, but it just does not appeal to me.. It's watery, and tart, and doesn't seem to come together well."
"Bell's Oarsman Ale was a hazy yellow color with a thin white head. The aroma was musty to me, like some belgians I've had. The first taste I got was a little saltiness, and then a weak lemon flavor. The mouth feel was light bodied with mild carbonation. Drinkability was so-so, just not enough flavor to recommend a second one."
"Foggy pale yellow with a thin, bright white sheet of a head. Subtle aroma of wheat and tart lemon...clean and mildly funky. Wheat and lemon tartness again in the flavor with a fine sweetness running right through the middle, finishing with some fresh grain. Light bodied, dry, and refreshing. Quality summer beverage..."
"This beer is garbage, unless you think bmc is good, stay away."
"It was a decent beer, not sure on the classification. It tastes like a berliner. Worth it on a hot day..."
"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a weizen glass. Pale golden and slightly hazy appearance. Head dissipates exceptionally quickly for a wheat beer, leaving minimal lacing. Aroma is quite subdued, and lacks many of the classic characteristics I look for in the style. Taste lacks much depth, but does have a nice refreshing tartness. Mouthfeel is a bit thinner than I had hoped for. Overall, lacking in many of the characteristics I look for in this style, but its tartness is nicelyrefreshing, and would probably go down nicely on a hot summer day."
"Very drinkalbe...a lawnmower beer if I do say so."
"pours a slight hazed pale light yellow color with a brilliant white head that dissipates quickly and leaves a sudsy light lacing..smell is a earthy lemon wheat with malts and a touch of sour yeast lots of malts ..taste is the same as smell.. lots of munich malts with a sour lemon yeast hit ,some lemon tartness and bread..mouth feel is light tart crisp a mix of lager pils and wheat that is tart..its ok drinkable ..i wont be drinking much of this..its one and done for me..it worth a try"
"Drinkability -- Interesting in that this straddles the line between a pale wheat ale and a Berliner Weissbier. Pretty drinkable, but it didn't blow my mind."
"The mouthfeel is light and carbonation is above average. Drinkability is pretty decent, it would be a nice choice for a hot day. The crispness and tartness were pretty good in it."
"D: Very drinkable body and everything, and in the right setting the flavor could work very well, but there are more settings where it does not."
"D: Funny. When I had this on tap at RFD a few months ago, it seemed to have a lot more Berliner Weisse character. As it is, it doesn't quite rise to the level of a genuine Weisse, but it's just reminiscent enough to drive away the typical drinker. A shame. I expected more from Bell's."
"I bought this one solely because I hadn't seen it before and we got it in the same time as The Oracle. It poured a light, light straw yellow with a light white head. It wasn't completely translucent but wasn't exactly cloudy either. The smell was light, yeasty and somewhat dry and sour. The flavor was pretty solid. It says on the bottle that it's got sour accents taken from sour mash. It had superb flavor and tasted amazing. It's greatly comparable to the DFH Festina Peche, minus the peach concentrate. It drank very light and was very refreshing. This may be one of my new favorite session beers. I really liked it."
"Pours a hazy, yellow color, with a small white head. In the aroma, wheat notes and funky cheese. In the taste, earthy and small sour, funky cheese. A smooth and medium bodied mouthfeel, with a dry earthiness in the aftertaste. I say funky cheese, but in a good way. refreshing."
"Drinkability: Though it is not a true Berliner Weisse, I think Bell's has stumbled onto something here as I really enjoyed the lightness and tartness; the beer would also pair well with a range of foods; it might not be every BA's cup of tea but it is a beer with potential mass appeal that I wouldn't mind drinking on a range of occasions"
"Enjoyable little beer on a hot day. The hint of acidic tartness is pleasant and not overdone."
"Slightly hazed yellow golden hue with a thin white cap of head. Fine speckled lacing on the sides of my flared pilsner glass. Chunks of yeast suspended in the slightly clouded elixer, alot of sediment ends up in the bottom of my glass. Aroma is mildly tart with a nice bready quality, hints of citrus and mild funk going on. Traditional sour mash methods are described on the label at a beerfest a couple weeks ago I was told this wasn't a Berliner Weiss, however I can't describe it any other way. Body is light with a drying tart finish, carbonation is ample nothing too hard to manage. Drinkability overall is super solid refreshing brew, I'm liking the fact that they made this one a year rounder in six packs. I don't know of many brewers making a tart wheat ale one of their regulars."
"Bottle poured into a pint glass. Cloudy pale yellow color and very fizzy. Smell is grassy with a slight citrus twist at the end. Taste is fairly sour with a lot of lemon flavors. Not very complex, but very light, clean, and drinkable. This would be great to have very cold on a hot day."
"I like a light beer for the summer, but unfortunately this is one Bells beer I won't be buying again."
"D - Take it for what it is. I love the beer and would choose pick this one if I just want a nice drinker."
"Bell's Oarsman ale pours a thin ring of bubbles over a slightly cloudy yellow brew. Massive carbonation is evident- the nose is wheat hull, funk, and maybe a note of vanilla. The flavor is tart and citrusy up front, with cereal notes and a suggestion of herbal hop off the back. Mouthfeel is light and crisp, semidry, with a bready aftertaste. Light and drinkable, Oarsman comes in at a mere 4% alcohol by volume. It's that tartness that breaks it out of the pale wheat ale pack- when I took my first sip, I assumed it was a Saison, or made with a Saison yeast, maybe. Later, a look at the back label attributes the flavor to ""traditional sour mash methods," whatever they may be. In any case, Bell's has managed toproduce a wheat ale that is distinct and flavorful, yet light."
"Overall- An interesting beer! Feels somewhat like a Berliner Weisse, but not quite as flavorful or tart. Would definitely be a nice compliment to a hot summer day, or as a thirst quencher after a big bike ride. Definitely drinkable, but may not be the first thing I go for."
"D: Well I have had many American Pale Wheats lately and this one is definitely unique. Upon first taste of this beer, it was presented as a berliner weisse. I can see why, but this beer just lacks the tartness to really fit into that style. As a pale wheat, I think this i s a great summer brew. Nice and crisp."
"I'm not sure, but I don't think this is a pale wheat ale. However, if it is then a score of average is incredibly generous."
"Oarsman definitely is not a bad beer but its nothing special. It is just a slightly sour incredibly refreshing beer. I have been enjoying this beer with my lunch lately and I do not feel a buzz, I just feel refreshed. It tastes similar to a macro but has a solid finish that sold me. It goes down very well also but nonetheless I cannot really justify buying it again unless the price drops because 9.99 for this is just a bit much. Overall worth trying."
"Hrmmm. Not my idea of a good beer. I know Bell's is going for a palatable light ale for hot summer days, but I'd pass on this one and have a Budweiser instead. Honestly."
"Drinkability: Refreshing and tart. Very, very simple but certainly quite drinkable."
"Drinkability: This is too sour for me to repeatedly drinkable."
"A cloudy pale yellow with a decent amount of sediment that was easy to pull up off the bottle. A crisp white head with a wheat heffe smell seemingly subtle on the malts. Pow! A citrus taste right up front, very limey lemon. feels good for a wheat beer with so much citrus flavor. Not too much tart. I was surprised by this. I thought it would taste less then it does. Cheers!"
"Drinkability: This is definitely an all day kind of beer -- really, with no weight to it and an especially small ABV, great refreshing flavors that don't overwhelm the sense and still provide refreshment, this beer's got a great thing going for it."
"It is interesting, but like many American Pale Wheat Ales it leaves something to be desired."
"It goes down like water, a delicious low alcohol beer for drinking on the deck."
"Not a bad beer, but nothing to get to excited about, just a very mild sour."
"Pours a pale murky gold with about two fingers of white head. I smell lemon, citrus and wheat. Tastes like it smells, some lemon, slight grass and a nice sour finish. Very crisp and refreshing, and very easy to drink. I could definitely see this being a session beer for me, especially on hot summer days."
"D: Refreshing summer beer. Not as tart as advertised, but still drinkable. Not sure I would buy again, but would drink if offered at a BBQ."
"drinkability: good"
"could drink these all day especially on a sunny summer day like today."
"Very pale, light yellow color with two fingers of white head that hangs around for a little while before settling to a thin cap. Moderate amount of lacing is left on the glass. Not sure what the brewers intent was here. Brew a Berliner Weiss type of beer or a boring, flavorless wheat beer. This beer definately landed on the boring side. Grainy, wheat aroma with just the slightest hint of sour lemon. If it wasn't for the slight sourness in this beer, it would be a completely pointless thing to drink. But it still is barely enough to get me to continue to drink this beer. Just a little flavor from the wheat but lacks any spice or fruity esters. Zero bitterness. No off flavors so it has that going for it. Light body as expected and pleasantly carbonated. This beer needed more charactor. Seems like it was a lackluster attempt at producing a Berliner Weiss or Gose."
"Tart and tangy with lemon and wheat, bubbly, light and very refreshing and drinkable. The relatively low (4.0ABV) and easy drinkability would make this a great warm weather session beer. This beer is easier to gulp than sip. Perhaps would get better ratings if under a different style category."
"D- No thanks, I'll stick with Two Hearted. Man, this is not my cup of tea. I struggled with the one bottle I had."
"Pours a hazy golden color with a thin white head that retains OK. Aroma has some tart green apple notes upfront, along with wheat and hay, egg, bread dough and little else. The flavor has some wheat and hay notes initially, as well as granny smith apple, lime juice, bread dough, and some cracker. The mouthfeel is thin without being watery and drinkability is exceptional. This isn't a particularly complex beer but it does what it does very well and could be a perfect summer beer."
"Very refreshing and makes a perfect summer beer. I am however disappointed in this. When I first had this on tap in march, it was more tart, had more depth and body and was an overall unique and awesome beer. I feel like now it's a good berliner weisse which it's not even listed as anymore. It's worth trying, but it's not what it used to be."
"It's a simple sessionable sour ale. It's not for everyone, but I enjoyed it."
"T: the flavor is unique and refreshing, at sip 1 i am not sure if i like it but sip 5 it is working well. still, it leave a bit of a sour flavor in the mouth that isn't wholly pleasant"
"Not a fan of this one, but a great gateway beer for some I suppose."
"A pretty pale gold color that has smallish fizzy white head. Head quickly recedes to a thin ring. Aroma is pretty malty actually, some big wheat-y notes in there that smell authentic--interesting nose. Taste is pretty good, has a lemon-y tart kick mid-palate that I enjoy, wheat-y finish, clean flavor. A bit of corn in there too. Fizzy in the mouth, though smooth finish, dry-ish. Very drinkable, and quite refreshing, a good take on wheat beer, but still not a style I am particularly fond of."
"This is a super drinkable beer. It is light and refreshing, and it's perfect for this time of year."
"EDIT - Almost a year later, I had another six pack of this for the weekend of the Fourth. Now that I've had some other beers that are sour, I understand this one a good deal more, and enjoy it."
" D- This beer is a light crisp easy drinking beer but a bit more tartness or some brett character or something would have made it much more drinkable."
"Pretty weak effort from Bell's, in my opinion. I love many of their beers, but this just doesn't do it for me. It's good to see this is no longer listed as a berliner weisse, as describing the beer as such would be rather misleading."
"D - This seems to have some of the characteristics that it should with the style being a berliner weiss/american pale wheat hybrid, but I found it not pleasurable to drink and even in hot weather probably not anything that I'd be reaching for again."
"D- Im not so sure about this one. It is very refreshing but I dont think I could drink more than a couple in a row."
"In every regard this beer vaguely resembles a berliner weiss, but the end result is a mellow pale wheat ale with sharp amount of carbonation and mild tart zing. Appearance is relatively clear, and pale grassy lemon yellow colored with a fizzy white head that maintains a consistent thick ring of bubbles and film with no lacing. Aroma is very mild and unremarkable, blend of wheat, grass and are those peanuts?? (wtf). Doesn't really smell much like any berliner or pale wheat. Ignoring the flavor, the body is very crisp, tart and refreshing with extremely sharp carbonation. The flavor is exceptionally wheaty, lemony and grassy with a lingering mild tartness. I ended up really enjoying this even though I was disappointed it wasn't a more traditional berliner. As others have mentioned its like a bizarre Oberon Lite mixed with...something."
"To me this is somewhere between an American Pale Wheat and Berliner Weiss, probably why it has flipped classification."
"On tap at the Thirsty Monk in Asheville."
"Draft. 2010 St. Paul Summer Fest. Pours a slight hazy golden yellow with minimal head. Aroma of lemon and other citrus. Does not finish well. Finishes with an off bitter taste. Mouthfeel is light. Not a good representation of a Berliner Weisse. The only real good quality was the mouthfeel, everything else falls short."
"D - This was a decent beer...perfect for summer, sitting on the porch, sipping away...as I mentioned the blast of citrus was really nice"
"Served from growler into a COAST imperial pint. Pours a hazy pale yellow with a one finger white head. There was no lacing evident. The aroma was comprised of fruit, and malt with a skunk aroma upon warming up. The flavor was of subtle fruit and malt. It was light on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a nice brew to enjoy outside on a hot summer day. It was refreshing and had very subtle flavors. However in my humble opinion I think the aroma and flavor was lacking a little complexity for me. Still nice and glad I got to try it, but probably won't have it again."
"D - A middling-to-shameful effort by a great brewery. I don't know what else to say."
"D: After I got past the powdery nose and boring start, I enjoyed the ale. A nice beach beer from Bell's."
"I love Bell's but this one was not what I has hoping it would be."
"D-Really easy drinking, and a great summer beer. I wish this would replace Oberon as their summer go-to beer."
"But this... this is just kinda there. The malt is weak, even for a Berliner, and the sour overrides it, but the sour itself isn't especially complex or interesting. You got some light nodes of raspberries and then in the back a little bit of citrus hops. That's it. It's neat--it really is, kind of like a whole new wave of easy drinking sessions--but it's not neat enough to make a fuss over."
"Very drinkable, with the low ABV this is quite a session beer."
"D - Light, easy drinking and crisp. It's great for a hot day but is not as tart as I was hoping. Enjoyable brew but not worth going crazy over. I would drink this again especially in this brutal SC summer."
"Beer is also thin bodied and mildly lactic. I got scolded by the rep for telling people it was a berleinerweiss. He told me some incorrect facts about how this beer was made and how berleiners were made and then instructed me to tell them that it was a lemony wheat beer. I got some lemons in the taste but not a lot. It is about the most drinkable beer I've ever come across."
"This is definitely not my first choice in a style of beer, however, the Oarsmen is an incredibly drinkable. They are spot-on for the style by this sites description. The syrups are excellent if you don't mind a flavorable sweet fruit taste. Himbeere is raspberry and awesome. The Waldmeister is woodruff and tastes like marshmallows, Lucky Charms to be more specific(Thanks Joseph). This was definitely a worthwhile growler and experience! I could drink one of these a day(with the flavoring). Nice and mild, great dessert or break between different styles of beers to clean the palette."
"Served up a hazy, murky yellow with absolutely no head. The aroma was tart and wheaty with some fruity notes of lemon zest and some pear. The flavor was not as sour as the other examples of this style that I have had, but it definitely has some pucker power. Wheaty, lemony, grassy and slightly astringent. Not a whole lot of depth here, but the flavors seem well proportioned and are enjoyable. The body is on the lighter side of medium, and had a clean light finish that made it very refreshing. Pretty drinkable, but overall I was a bit disappointed. Still a nice beer and a decent take on a hard to find style."
"Had a pint with brunch at the Sidecar in Philly. This turned out to be a tasty replacement for a mimosa and made a nice compliment to my huevos rancheros. The beer appeared an opaque yellow with a slice of lemon. The beer, while not very tasty, had a wonderful mix of creamy bread with toast and wheat cracker flavors. There were mild hints of citrus, but on the whole it was a bit clean for the style. Still, a very tasty beer and worth checking out."
"D- This is a decent beer overall. Not as sour as most Berliners and a lot more wheat beer forward. Was happy to see this on the menu at Mad Mex today- you don't see this style around too often. I think there should be more examples!"
"Pours a cloudy, golden color. 2/3 inch head of a white color. Good retention and decent lacing. Smells of yeast, sweet malt, slight pale malt, slight wheat, slight citrus, and slight earthy malt. Fits the style of an American Pale Wheat Ale. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of wheat, slight pale malt, sweet malt, slight yeast, slight hop, and hint of butter. Overall, decent aroma and body."
"Overall I was a bit let down by this beer - the base is there but it needs more complexity to round everything out. Not one to avoid but not one to seek out."
"Overall a rather average offering from Bell's. I was hoping for a little more I have to admit."
"D: Nicely done Berliner. I could see myself drinking a few of these, if they were available in bottles! Love seeing a lighter, sort of a rare style done this nice."
"D: Lite in taste wish there was a bit more tartness. Solid, but not great."
"D: Extremely drinkable. The low alcohol content, light body, and citrusy character makes this one easy to drink."
"Mow the lawn and have a few."
"Bell's Oarsman, ontap. Pours a pale yellow with some head and lace. A bit hazy in appearance. Smell is vague, just some citrus pulling through. Taste follows the nose with some lemon rind, lemon/tea like hops and pale malt. Touch of wheat is also there. Uber-refreshing and went great with some wings. This is another beer that begs for warmer weather to be enjoyed fully. I have to say this was a pleasing beer, and it was gone too fast."
"Drinks very easy, a pretty accessible but a semi- faithful take on the style. Went great with my Pizza"
"D - While this would be highly drinkable in the summer, I would always choose an 1809 first."
"D - Pretty drinkable, the lack of tartness may actually make it more so, but it's not one I will miss."
"The flavor is slightly tart not sour at all but a good flavor of oranges hits the tongue. Thicker mouthfeel than most Berliner Weiss' I've tried. Moderate carbonation also creates a decent mouthfeel. For how exclusive and rare this is, I wouldn't seek it out again."
"Overall Impression: This is the second Berliner Weisse I've had in the past 4 days. I really enjoyed it, even after having 3 other Bell's beers prior to this. It was not quite as good as the 1809 I had a few days back, but it was pretty dam close!"
"D - This is pretty decent overall for drinkability, I don't consider it the best Berliner I have had it is kind of lactic but doesn't hold to the finish"
"Light, cloudy yellow straw color, fizzy white head, good retention yet minimal lacing. Smell is of hay and straw, wheat and white bread with a touch of lemon. Taste starts a with a slightly tart and sour lemon profile, moving on to the straw and bread components noted in the smell. The finnish has a little yeasty and another sour kick to it. Light bodied, good carbonation. Recomended to drink as liquid approached room temperature to get more of the interesting flavors, very light tasting when cold."
"A turbid yellow color, almost the color of wheat. Not too much of a smell, outside of a bit of a sour note. Very refreshing to drink. Dry was the first and the main sensation. There was a bit of a citrus-y/sour flavor but not so much as other flavored Berliner Weisse's I have had. Very refreshing and easy to drink. The low ABV, even though it's standard for this style, was appreciated."
"Overall- Not overly sour. Just smooth and well done."
"Overall, I am having a hard time understanding that this is a b-weissse. Either that or I just don't know the style well enough. It was light in flavor and very drinkable. I could easily have a few of these. Great session beer."
"D - This is a very nice Berliner Weiss. It's only my second but it was quite delicious."
"I would drink it again, but probably not run out and specifically look for it."
"I could drink this till the cows come home. Low alcohol and one of my favorite styles. Here's to hoping some bottling goes on with the oarsman. Don't pass this up, it's good, it's real good."
"My first experience with a sour wheat, quite interesting and mind opening. Poured a cloudy grassy yellow with minimal head. Smell is tart with some vinegar like aromas. Very citrusy and bitter smelling. Taste is mouth puckering with the finish of a wheat beer, quite complex. Like sucking on a lemon and then eating a scoop of cereal. Rushes on the tongue and delivers a citrus punch that puckers the tongue and opens the nasal cavity. Great wheat finish to slow things down. Great beer but considering its my first step into sours, I don't understand the drinkability yet. Very crisp and refreshing though."
"On tap at Stub n Herbs. Pours a hazy yellow color, with the haze probably coming from the wheat, no head and no lacing, which is expected of the style, but still rather dull looking. Smell is light and citrusy. Really not a lot going on in the aroma, but a light sourness can be detected. Taste is sharp, crisp, and lightly tart, flavors of citrus, light acidity, and mild sugary sweetness. Light to medium bodied, fizzy, somewhat refreshing. Not a bad Berliner Weissbier, but I've had much better."
"Note: according to this site, it was only brewed once. I hope Larry Bell and crew decide to make this one again. Its pretty amazing."
"A beer this light and tasty is very drinkable. The sourness could get to some after more than one of these though. I could definitely drink another, and I did."
"- drinkability: very drinkable. Nice flavor, fast clean finish with a little sour and grain, easy to throw back."
"It isn't always on tap, and they don't sell it, so give it a try if you like a nice crisp beer that you can drink all night."
"The beer went well with the peanuts."
"This was decent. Some moderate full flavors and a crisp body made for some good sessionalbility with this. Plus I think that this was their cheapest offering at the Cafe, running around $3 for a 20 oz pint. Good deal!"
"D: Very drinkable. Great outdoor summer drink."
