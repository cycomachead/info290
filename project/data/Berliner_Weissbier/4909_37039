In the nose, sweet malted grains, light notes of lemon and grassy funk. The taste was crisp with a lemony tartness, slightly acidic, apple skin, cereal grains, sourdough, honey, the latter of which came out a bit more as the beer warmed, in the aroma and taste, leaving a residual sweetness in the finish.

Served in a Sam Adams Boston Lager glass, the beer pours a hazy straw gold color with about an inch white head that didn't stay around for too long. Not much lacing. The brew smells like wheat/bready malt and lemons/lemon peel. The taste is mostly like the aroma, it's nice and tart, with some green grape flavors noticeable too. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, it's smooth and has moderate carbonation. I think this is a nice, enjoyable brew. It's refreshing and easy enough to drink, definitely worth trying. $3.59 a bottle.","bluejacket74","Sep 07, 2013"

Anyway, this stuff pours a lightly hazy straw topped by over a finger of relatively short-lived white foam. The nose comprises mildly-tart lemon zest, a twist of tart orange zest, some light sweet flowers, and a touch of mild sweet biscuit in the background. The taste brings in more of the same, with a stronger tartness throughout. However, due to its incredible lightness and crispness, the bulk of the flavor only lasts a short time, leaving a small squad of tartness to linger for a bit. The body is fairly light, with a light moderate carbonation and a crisp, dry finish. Overall, a damn solid Berliner, something that can deliver some sour without tearing the enamel from your teeth and can do so on a nicely regular interval.","TMoney2591","Jul 27, 2013"

Then the tartness hits me...it's very tart and the depth of flavour isn't quite there to balance it out or back it up. I find that i'm puckering more than i'm savoring it.

Pours lightly hazy very pale straw color with a 1-2 finger dense white head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Light spotty lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of big tart apple, pear, grape, raspberry, lemon, hay, grass, honey, wheat, funk, white vinegar, and earthy spiciness. Fantastic aromas with great balance and complexity of fruity/funky notes with some light malt presence. Taste of tart apple, pear, grape, lemon, honey, wheat, grass, hay, light vinegar, funk, and yeast earthiness. Light fruity tartness on the finish; with lingering notes of light fruits, citrus, honey, hay, grass, light vinegar, light funk, and earthiness on the finish for a short bit. Good balance and complexity of fruity/funky ester flavors with slight malt balance; feels fairly watery, but not too bad; with zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and light-medium bodied; with a smooth, crisp, and slightly acidic mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with zero warming noticed after the finish as expected. Overall this is a very nice Berliner weisse style. Nice overall balance and complexity of yeast ester flavors; and extremely smooth to drink.

There also is a slight lemon zest and grassy hop aroma that hides the slight oxidization. The flavor profile is much the same except for one big difference. The infection in the Berliner Weiss isn't entirely lactic in nature. There is definitely something else in there. It reminds me of sour yogurt pushing on the tail of the flavor profile.
