"Fairly hazy, very pale yellow - practically white - in color. Forms a fizzy white head that slowly reduces to a creamy surface coating. Minimal lacing. Aroma is standard for the style: slightly tart, wheat, and a light bit of lemon. Taste is also pretty much on the mark for a Berliner. Mostly wheat with a slight lemony tartness. Lighter bodied. Heavier carbonation. Good stuff."

" The taste really is great with tangy yet not extremely tart flavors with subtle lemony tinge and nice foundation of wheat malt for a lactic acidity  which brings you back with light sweet cereral flavor and honey/lemon quality. Overall a pretty great canned berliner -probably the only I have had _ I would drink this anytime it is sour enough to be truly drinkable without crossing the trheshold of to tart -the epitome of what the style should be. Thanks again for the share Adam!"

"Not a pretty beer, but a sensational summer drink. I am not sure the conventional rating system is fair to this beer. Is it one of the best beers I've ever had? Of course not. But as a purpose built lawn mower beer, outta this world. I did a Berliner Weiss beer bakeoff betwee this and NG BW, and this was narrowly the winner. I had 2 cans. Now they are gone. And it's getting hot. That makes me sad."

"More berliner weiss across the board please. NEBCO are my heros."

"Overall this is a good, solid berliner. I could see heaving these cans at targets floating down the Apple River fifteen years ago. OK, twenty. Well made beer for the cheery days of summer... not that Minnesota is likely to see that anytime soon."
"Extremely drinkable. Really really enjoyed this one, even at below freezing temperatures. Thanks a bunch woosterbill!"
"O- This was a nice simple, standard berliner weiss. I'd love to see NEBCO put some fruit in this at some point, it might also be interesting to try again with some fruited syrup added. Overall it's nothing that I would go crazy for but if you are into the style then and don't mind a little acidity it is definitely worth the try."
"The Crack revealed yet another brimful craft CAN and the inverted Glug released a sour, cheesy odor into the air. I had a brief finger of bone-white head that fizzed its way out of existence very quickly, almost like pop. Color was a cloudy, light-yellow (SRM = 2) and the serving wench in her drindl wanted to know ""Mit Schuss?"" "Nein, fraulein," I replied, ""Schuss ist scheiss!"" I like my beer unadorned. Nose had a sharp lemony tartness and my mouth puckered at the thought of what was to come. Mouthfeel was sort of thin, not watery, but not much to the body, either. The taste was tart, not sour, with a definite lemon-like flavor as part of the assault. Finish was a big ""Wow!"" as the tartness just seemed to explode in the back of my throat. It was definitely refreshing and would be much better on a hot, humid day in the summer. Still, it was very cleansing for my palate and left me ready to Crack open a CAN of something else."

"Who knew you could get such a good Berliner weiss in a can?"
""

"O: Pretty nice overall. A little doughy for my liking, but pretty nice overall. Put this right around Weisse Weisse Baby for American berliners."

"Another seriously good Berliner Weisse. I'm glad to see this style exploding recently; lots of beautiful sour and fruity flavors with ridiculously low levels of alcohol. Perfect combination, if you ask me. I quite enjoyed NEBCo's take on the style; I wish this was available to me - I'd have a case of it stocked in the fridge for the remainder of the summertime."

"Overall- This is a damn fine Berliner Weiss and it comes in a can!"
""

"This is a light bodied brew with a modest amount of carbonation. It is quite clean and a solid take on the style. If this is Nebco's first shot at a berliner, I applaud that effort and really hope more is in the works. Throwing this in a can was awesome...but if only the can was oh I dont know...24oz instead of 12?!"

"Overall a very solid offering from a very solid brewery of an up and coming style that's getting more and more popular. This is certainly one to try."
"12oz can bought at the brewery. Pours a very pale translucent straw color with a small head that dissipates quickly. No lacing. Almost looks like a carbonated glass of white wine. Smells funky and sour with lemon and wheat aromas. The taste is a big sour punch of lemon up front, with some sweetness as well. Almost like a sour candy. Some wheat flavor followed by more sour lemon at the finish. Extremely refreshing and insanely drinkable. Virtually no alcohol presence. The can, the low abv, and the drinkability make this an ideal summer beer. The mouthfeel is light and crisp. Every sip is just a refreshing burst of sour lemon and wheat. I was hesitant to get a 4 pack at the brewery because this isn't a style I drink often but I took a chance anyways and I'm glad I did. Fantastic brew that I hope gets made again, but if not I'm glad I bought some."

"O - This was a good berliner, but perhaps a bit too sour for its own good. I like my berliners to be consumable and relativity easy drinking. This is damn tasty stuff and really feeding my sour itch, but multiples of this would just seem daunting and Tums inducing."
