Pouring yielded an orange-copper color, murky but bright, with pours past the middle of the bottle giving quite a large amount of pulpy apricot floaties. A fluffy white head receded to a small ring, lacing the glass nicely. In the nose, apricot dominated, with lesser notes of oak and wildflowers, lightly toasted wheat. The taste was no joke...apricots and lots of them, more pronounced than in any other apricot beer I've ever tasted, a mix of fresh apricot meat and candied apricot, more sugary sweet than tart/sour; secondary flavors of fresh oak, toasted wheat, and some hay funk. Medium body, juicy mouthfeel. Overall: amazing. I would foam-dome this all day every day if I could.","Rifugium","May 14, 2014"
