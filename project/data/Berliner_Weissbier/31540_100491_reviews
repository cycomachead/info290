"Overall - Overwhelmingly sour without the flavor to back it up."

"O- For my first taste of De Garde, this was pretty disappointing. But I already knew this is considered one of the lesser rated ones. Got to start somewhere, right? [3.5]"

"Pour is dark maroon with a lot of pink head.  Nose has a moderate blueberry, yeast presence, faint plastic, dusty notes and a touch of lactic.  Taste is fairly assertive blueberry, a hint of plastic, vanilla lacto, notes of yeast, strong sourness and a bit of acetic acid.  Typical de garde body, lighter with a strong carb and a bit prickly and puckering in the back."

"Pours a murky light red with a foamy off-white head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace slowly drip into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is slightly sour and tart with malt, grain, and slight blueberry aromas. Taste is much the same with sour and tart grain and subdued blueberry flavors on the finish. There is a medium amount of acidity on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that is tasty but the blueberry presence in this one is fairly subtle."

"The palate opens with a big fruity flavor, bright, jammy blueberries, mildly tart and with a blend of skin bitterness and seed tannins. The Berliner base follows, with a very yogurty and mildly buttermilk-like flavor. Wheat is pronounced on the finish, with a blend of grain, bread and husk. Drying and fruity on the finish, the lingering blueberry flavor is amazing. Sourness is moderate, clean, lactic and refreshing. The funk I picked up on the nose is present to a milder degree, lending a touch of spice to complement the lactic sourness and the fruit. Excellent stuff. Oregon has the best blueberries I've ever had, and this beer captures their essence marvelously. Head and shoulders above other fruited Berliners I've had recently."
