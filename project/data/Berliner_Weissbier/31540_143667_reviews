"Verdict: A delicious berliner from de Garde, one of the truer and jammier fruit expressions I've tried from them. The balance is nice, though quite sour and with a more aggressive texture but the bright flavors and supremely refreshing nature of this make it another winner."

"This beer was awesome. Easily put down the 750ml myself. I can't wait to see the other fruited Weisses from De Garde!"

"Pour is dark pink with an amber hue, light haze, and lots of light pink tight head that lingers for some time.  Nose is big and bright cherry with tons of seedy raspberry.  The raspberry are very pithy, seems very sour and tart.  Flavor is a bit less seedy, more cherry with a balanced raspberry.  a lot less tart than I would have thought but still has a hint of sourness.  Moderate carb, very dry, light body."

"Bottle by special delivery by a friend who visited Oregon."
"This beer smells great (think smucker cherry pancake syrup), and the cherrry aroma is intense.  On the palate, I get the expected cherry sour component, with some underlying vanilla as well.  The is very light on it's feet, but you would expect that, given the abv."

"Pours a bright pinkish/purple with white head and some clarity. Such a nice appearance from the fruit!  The nose is predominantly fresh picked raspberry paired with lactobacillus.  The cherry doesn't seem to make much noise here, perhaps it adds to the acidic undercurrent. The flavor is straight raspberry and lacto tartness.  Juicy fruits up front, nice puckering tartness to follow! a touch of grainy wheat on the finish. The barrel isn't detectable on my palate but that does not detract from how tasty this beer is! Mouthfeel is highly carbonated and light. Overall, a delicious fruited berliner!"
