"(O)- I think I like this better than their blueberry berliner. The fruit is a bit better integrated and a more balanced yet refreshing profile overall. My only complaint is it borderlines as a fruit lambic versus a purer berliner weiss."

"O: I actually like Blue Lady a bit better than this, but this is still tasty and worth picking up when you can find it."
"M: Light leading to medium due to malts sweetness."

"Pretty good, definitely my favorite of the four Berliners, but as already mentioned - I'm slightly biased towards raspberries. Nice fruity flavor, nice up-front tartness, and very easy to throw back. Refreshing, crispy, tasty."
"Very clear, vibrant pink with a big lightly pink-ish head. Lots of raspberry aroma and taste with light dry, earthy brett notes. Tart, but not excessively, despite the amount of raspberry flavor. Moderate carbonation, light and crisp. Easy to drink, a favorite of the day."

"Bright pink, with a pinkish white head. Moderate retention and decent lacing. Nose has bright, fresh raspberry notes, yogurt and lactic character. Sharp wheat as well. Taste has sharp tartness off the bat and tart raspberry/cranberry juice. Sharp wheat character comes through mid palate, with gentle fruit character and mild tartness well into the finish. Medium light palate, high carbonation. A very nice fruited Berliner, and having this in the dead of winter probably doesn't do this justice."

"Overall: This beer really surprised me and I enjoyed it quite a bit. The focus is definately on the raspberries. I would seriously consider this beer as an alternative to a table beer that would normally hold up to alot of different and deverse food pairings from appetizers, cheese, salads, light pasta dishes, sushi/seafood, and even some desserts. I dont know alot about a berliner wiess style beer, but this beer has captured my interest. Pipeworks did a good job with this beer. I would not hesitate to pick up another bottle of this beer. Its a creative concept that Pipeworks had here to just brew the berliner wiess with raspberries instead of serving it with the traditional raspberry syrup."

"O - This was a bit of an odd beer. I descibed it as a good palate cleanser to the tasting group."
"Overall, this is my favorite of the BW's by Pipeworks. Everything is in line with a solid BW. The smell makes me think of Frankenberry or a box of Special K ""Red Berries"" cereal."

"Pours a murky light red with a foamy reddish-white head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace slowly drip into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, yeast, and raspberries. Taste is much the same with a mild vomit or bile note on the finish. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer but the flavor on the finish throws me off a bit."
"Will definitely buy this again next summer"

"O- This is a nice crisp fruity beer with hints of berliner weisse funk. Very drinkable."
"O - Well done Berliner. Wish more of the awesome raspberry aroma was also found in the taste, but this is very good."
"O: A well balanced Berliner with just the right amount of fruit. The Raspberries were not overpowering but definitely at the front. There was also a slight wheat component that really helped balance this beer nicely. It has a perfect clean, crisp tartness that you'd want in a BW. Overall a very good beer."

"O- 6/10 sourness. Very nice beer. More tart than I expected, and enjoyed, with some raspberry notes to balance the sour mash."
"O: Greatly refreshing with the right amount of raspberry sweetness and tartness. The wheat played a nice role in balancing out the fruit as well."

"D - I easily drank a 750ml bottle on my own. It's a solidly executed Berliner that could use a bit more ripe raspberry flavor for my tastes. Thankfully it didn't suffer from the cheese aroma that Blue Lady did, so I'm confident the Pipeworks guys have figured out their problems."
"O - Recommended. Especially if you are a raspberry fan... you won't be disappointed."
"The final beer of the day, from Clybourn to Mundelein. Damn. Anyway, this stuff pours a clear magenta topped by a finger of light pink-white foam. The nose comprises tart raspberry must and a touch of what seems like vague wheat way the hell in the background. make no mistake: the raspberries are the stars here. The taste brings in more of the same, though the tartness overshoots the berry-ness, creating a feeling of just straight and general tartness. I was looking forward to some actual raspberry flavor, but was stymied. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a decidedly dry finish. Overall, a solid Berliner, but the raspberries, despite being in control, don't exert their berry-forward selves throughout. Still enjoyable, though..."

"O: Overall a good beer. Very drinkable. And while it's not the best Berliner I've had, it's certainly not the worst."

"Ample tartness, seedy raspberry tannin, dry finish. Middle is wheaty and clean but the feel is a little watery. Could be more crisp, it's a little thin bodied at first, but not out of place for the style. Tart raspberry through and through. Fruity and drinkable, some light minerals and sourdough from the yeast. A Berliner with the classic Himbeere flavor built right in."
