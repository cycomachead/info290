"I hope that this is just a bad bottle and may try again someday as I am generally a fan of this flavor profile."
"This beer was falsely advertised as an ""intensely sour wild ale"" but the beer isn't sour at all! I mean, not one bit of tart was tasted. The pour is nice without foam and the beer is still a smooth one. If you're looking for a sour, skip this brew. But, if you're looking for a day time or summer beer then this one is a go."
"Tastes like the after taste of a war head. Very bitter. Easy drink. Low alc level. No complaints but not blown away either, 4/5 is a fair assessment. Almost tastes like champagne. If I want to continue my night can't go for 9% so it's a very solid option at one mile house"

"A really wonderful berliner weisse."

"Murky gold, not much lacing. Smell yeast and wheat. Taste lemon, wheat, bubble gum. Medium body, clean, very tart finish. Tart!"

"This is a light bodied brew with a light amount of carbonation. Fairly refreshing with an interesting funk inclusion of brett. This was a good beer, it just misses the berliner style a little with its focus on funk. For an american wild, its solid for a berliner, i was happy with just one pour."
""
"Overall a nice beer, great for summer."
""
"Corked and caged 750ml poured into a tulip. Surprisingly clear with just a slight haze to the straw gold body. Mild carbonation produces a thin mat of white head. Subtle and soft lactic sourness hits the nose and palate first. Lemon juice, grass, and a background note of earth and herb (from the lemon verbena?). A smooth vein of musky funk runs through the beer and adds a nice complexity. Another wave of tartness hits the back of the palate on the swallow. Really nice and refreshing, but still plenty complex. Certainly inspired by Berliner Weiss, but this beer brings a little something else. Well done."
""
"O: More of a wild than I expected and would certainly encourage fans of the wild ales to give this one a try. I would love to have more access to it and will be picking up a case for the summer next chance I get."
"This is a formidable beer but with some complexity,"
"Overall: A joy to drink! As the daytime highs have jumped from 40's-50's one day to over 80 degrees the next, this was just the refreshing, easy-to-drink tipple I needed."

"B-"

"o - Overall the body is a bit thin and watery, and it doesn't look great, but the nose and taste are very good. Would certainly have it again."
"Overall - An outstanding summer beer to beat the heat. Citrus refreshment and not much else more. More Tart than sour and not as complex but enjoyable non the less."
""
""
"O: A very well balanced brew; definitely one worth revisiting."
""
""
""
"This was my first ever sour beer. At least that was what I’d call it. It has its moments, but I’m sure others must be better. Maybe I’ll go back to this after I try a few others."
""
""
"Ahhhh... I love this style, and I really like this beer. ""Bottled on"" date says ""78", and have no idea how fresh/old this beer is, but I drank it over 2 months after I received it and it's still tastes fresh. Would love to try a bottle(or two) of this fresh next summer."

"Bottle. Pours a crystal clear light golden color with a tannish white fluffy head. Slight sourness in the nose with some fruit like pear. Light mouthfeel. Light sourness balanced out with a little sweetness. Pretty subtle. Easy drinking. Not overly complex by any means. For 5.7%, the alcohol is absolutley unnoticeable."
"O: Refreshing, but not a lot to it. Tasty beer. Perfect for a summer bbq."
"Pours a hazy, bright straw color with a large white head that takes some time to go down. Scent is nice lemon zest with some tart aromas. A bit of wheat in the nose as well...as well as cider-like scents. Taste is initially pleasantly tart with flavors of lemon and spices. Lots of lemon with just a bit of bread and wheat. Mouthfeel is light bodied and highly carbonated. Drinkability is very high. Overall, this was an awesome beer that I was not expecting to be as great as it was. To me, this is more like a berliner weissbier than a wild ale. Highly drinkable."
"Overall I enjoyed this and would recommend it as a good introduction to sours for anyone. All the components you look for in a sour are there without anything really standing out. I will seek this out again and will enjoy it. Cheers!"
"Very nice offering, but I would like a little more flavor profile on this one."
"Overall: A very good beer. Extremely refreshing, sour but not overly so, very drinkable."
"Lacto & Brett ... both are very tame here though add just enough to bring some tartness and funk to the palate. The subtle approach works as it ends up extremely drinkable."
"O: Very good summer brew. Happy I opened this before the impending fall season."
"This is a great wheat beer, the sourness is a very nice complement."
"O: A pretty straight forward basic sour. For the cost of it, very much worth it. Wonder if age really does do anything to this though."
"O: Really drinkable and light. The flavors and acidity are mild and go down refreshingly enough. This would be a good intro sour."
"Cheers!"
"I liked this beer, at the expense of complexity it'll just about satisfy a sour craving, without being too heavy or barnyard."
" crisp, clean, tart aroma quickly fills the air. Hints of apples, light touches of citrus, a light bready note all combine to form this crisp, clean profile Wonderful tart green apples blending with hints of light orange peel and lemon. Herbal grasses fill the profile mid palate and give it that depth but flowery notes keep it light and airy. Super quick, clean and dry finish leaves a tart flavor on the tongue that will not go away. So light and refreshing"
"Nice bubbly mouthfeel. It's definitely light bodied, but I think it woks with this beer. Very refreshing and enjoyable on a hot summer day. Reminded me of a less complex Veritas 008 overall."
"750 ml bottle thanks to Ghettofabulous. Pours a pale yellow with some fizzy head that dissipates relatively quickly. Cloudy in appearance. Nice nose of citrus hay and grass. Taste is lightly tart and just sour enough. Nice notes of citrus, Brett, little grassiness. Not really that inky but a real refreshing tartness. Well done for the style. This is great for a nice hot day as it is quite refreshing. Big fan of Berliners just wish more people would do them!"
"Narrative: “Well hey hey hey fellas!” Chip Merken piped out loudly while deftly handling his pitchfork. “Ah can it Chip, we can’t take it on harvest day.” Harvest day was hard and long, with an oppressive sun. Chip was always a crisp jolly individual who could somehow out-harvest the others, and outsow his colleagues at planting time. “Toot doot dee do da dee dee daaa” he whistled some antiquated tune to himself, smiling in between breaths. “COME ON, DAMNIT CHIP!” One co-worker threw his rake down in anger. “Here we are trying to harvest some damn wheat and instead we have you all up in our heads with your old show tunes and knock knock jokes, don’t none of that make this any sooner!” Chip’s smile slowly faded and he looked down at his glistening pitchfork, “don’t let them get sore at you old Chip, don’t let what happened before ever happen again,” the darkness in his heart burned. “Well sure fellas! I will go get the reaper, I GUESS!” The reaper indeed young Chip, the reaper indeed."
"Overall, this was an easy drinking sour/wheat. Nothing crazy, but enjoyable. I would like to see more of these done as they are not overly soured."
"O - I would not like any more of this, due entirely to the disgusting nature of the nose."
"It's a nice beer. Easy to drink, but with plenty of interest. The wild elements give it its edge."
"O-A solid beer. Worth revisiting."
"This is a pretty good effort. Not crisp like a berliner should be, but a worthy effort. Lemon Verbena comes through strong, very juicy. A bit flabby and messy, but still purty good. I should be a good beer advocate and make sure this review is two hundred and fifty characters. Did I make it this time? Thanks Dakine!"
"Overall, I enjoy the beer. It would be a very nice wild ale to quaff in the summertime. Not overly complex, but still interesting enough to warrant another go. I like the take on the American wild style that stays away from the puckeringly sour route that some like to take."
"Drink- A good way to end the day with a flavorful and low abv beer. I could put back a few bottles of this pretty quickly."
"Beer is thin and watery with a nice wheat finish to it. Some oak in the late palate, overall a nice little wild ale. Nothing too aggressive about it just a solid simple palate, mild lactic acid, overall I'd have it again."
"Mouthfeel is thin, which is to be expected and a little grainy. It's highly drinkable and at 5% it won't be a problem to finish this bottle. It's an interesting take on a wild, it's the first ever wheat sour I've had and I'm glad I've got another bottle."
"I was really impressed by Telegraph with this one. It's Wheaty and Sour -- Needless to say: it's light. Very refreshing, drinkable."
"quite a refreshing beer that would taste great while eating fresh fruit on a porch on a warm late-spring afternoon."
"Overall a very enjoyable beer. I'd definitely drink it again. If I had regular access to it I'd probably drink quite a bit of it."
"Hazy yellow. Definitely expected the haze, this being a wheat beer. The beer smells of oak and yeast, with notes of French wine, or vin jaune barrels. The beer isn't terribly complex, but it is so very easy to drink. I wish it was a bit more sour, but then again I am a sourhead. Overall, a wonderful surprise. I thoroughly enjoyed this beer."
"Telegraph Reserve Wheat Ale probably hit the brewery's target in the middle of the bull's eye. It's good warm weather beer and is the wild ale equivalent of a simple saison or a crisp pilsner. Oh, and this particular vintage is showing no signs of age whatsoever."
"Pours a very bright straw color with a huge head that sticks around for a while. It's got an awesome lactic aroma. Very crisp smelling. If you told me this were a Berliner I'd believe it. The flavor only solidifies the previous statement. Super clean lactic flavor with a kiss of brett. I love the wheat in this beer. Awesome. Incredibly drinkable. Well done."
"Tasted from 750mL bottle at Lush Roscoe. Pours pale golden with a decent but quickly receding white head. Smell is sour and funky with tart fruits. Flavor is sour and slightly funky with good lemon acidity. The body is light with lively carbonation and a long-ish tart and bitter finish."
"Pours a pale hazed straw golden color with a quickly dissipating large fizzy bone white head. Head settles into a thick ring and thin film of tiny bubbles with light streaks of lacing. Aroma is mildly lactic and sour, with strong notes of banana, wheat, citrus rind, lemon, florals and light pepper. Body is very light and fluffy with extremely active, sharp carbonation which nicely complements the lactic and lemon sourness. Flavor is much less of a typical wheat beer than the nose would have suggested. Lemon zest dominates the flavor, with some hints of the sweet malt and yeast. Very berlinner weissy (well, a very sweet one) and highly drinkable and refreshing, but the overly effervescent body combined with oppressive lemon and lactic flavors obliterate most of the wheat presence. I enjoyed this a lot more than my score suggests since this was very unique, but the balance and composition misses the mark for me."
"I love the idea of a sour wheat- I think the lactic notes of a Berliner Weiss work very well, so why not Brett notes as well. Pours a hazy golden with a good, but loose head and lots of carbonation. The Brett is certainly active in this bottle. Smells lemony, lactic, and herbal. The taste is a very nice blend of lemon, herbs, and sharp, quick lactic notes, followed by a long salty minerality and the barest bit of barnyard. Very nice. Perhaps a little overcarbonated, but lemony and refreshing in the mouth. Overall, I think this works quite well. It retains the refreshing nature of a wheat beer but adds some funky complexity."
"F: Finishes spicy with a slight acidic and lingering sour tangy fruit, more lemonade like flavor, very dry, little funky dry yeasty taste too, but very little coming from that heavy dryness. Some fruit flavors so light its hard to detect."
"I expected maybe more complexity for a $13 750mL of wild ale billed with Brett and Lacto. For the money i'd rather get a couple 1809's or a Bruery Hottenroth."
"D - Insanely drinkable. Drinks more like a saison than a sour/lambic. Small compensation for the mouthfeel, in my opinion, but is definitely an upside. I could have had another 750ml; it was that drinkable."
"Despite the style its under per BA, TRW is not overly sour, but more of a witbier spiked with some sour character. It worked out great with me."
"Drinkability - Easy to drink for a ""wild ale"" and it is my first wheat wild ale. To be perfectly honest it is not as enjoyable as some of the other American Wild Ale's I have had but it was good to try (though for this price range I'd rather buy a Jolly Pumpkin La Roja)."
"D - Its a great beer for the warmer season and definitely a beer I could put down several glasses of. Really enjoyed it, and would be great to sit and enjoy."
"Bottle from trade, and then I found it in Phoenix as well. Addition of lemon verbena, as well as lactobacillus and brettanomyces. A dry wheat ale, a wheat and lemony aroma. The mouthfeel is certainly not thin, but it is not a creamy wheat taste from a normal wheat ale. That part disapointed my drinking buddy. I got some brett, some herbal lemony flavour, and it was most drinkable to me. It is unique. Light colour with substantive bubbly white head."
"D: Easy to drink, considering it is brewed with wild strains of yeast and bacteria. Note that this beer is not aged in wine barrels, unlike many of the more high-profile american wild ales. It reminds me of RR Sanctification, with wheat added. The rich wheat backbone is very well represented here and it makes me want to try a traditional (non-sour) wheat beer by this brewery. There is a lot here to like, get it if you can."
"All in all, I would especially like to have this in warmer weather with brunch. I'm thinking, and its just a hunch, that it would go well with goat cheese."
"Low ABV makes this great for languid Summer weekend days..."
"Not at all a difficult drinker, but in the absence of any assertive flavors, the experience is a little lacking."
"D: Very drinkable, although not the most interesting or complex sour ale, it's still nice to drink."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, tart, with with acidic citrus tickling the tongue on the finish."
"75cl bottle. Lightly hazy yellow with a medium white head. The aroma is super complex, with spice, citrus, funk, sweet bread, wheat, and doughy yeast. The flavor is not as sour as the aroma suggests, with a light tartness that plays with some sweet, doughy malt to give off a lemon pastry impression. Bready with some light spice as well. Medium bodied with some spritzy bubbles. While this isn't as sour as I was expecting, it's a damn pleasant and drinkable wheat beer."
"Bottle courtesy bulletrain76. Pours a slightly hazy light gold color, much darker than a typical German Berliner Weisse. Lactic lemon zesty aroma with candied citrus and some sort of unidentifiable spiciness. Hard to stop smelling this one. Flavor is wheaty with lemon meringue, slight banana pith, coriander(?), and a wheat malt finish. Solid tartness. Nice robust flavor and body."
"D: A very nice Berliner from Telegraph, a beer to compare with the Bruery's for the best I've had in Southern California. Not the greatest drinkability as it is heavy in a way at times, but a refreshing, interesting beverage nonetheless."
"Tasty enough and certainly dry and quenching. The tartness stays fairly level throughout and never builds to what I would consider ""sour"". More funk and sourness would be welcome on this end."
"Pours a hazy, light gold in color with a nice inch or more of frothy head. Smell is wheat, yeast and some lemon zest. Taste is more of the lemon flavor as well as some clove. This is perfect for a hot, humid spring day. There's just a hint of bitterness and some sort of citrus in the middle of each sip. Very refreshing. Very full and creamy on the mouthfeel. This is a real easy beer to drink. Quite the fact that it is gone too fast. This is a really good beer and the first that I've had from Telegraph Brewing."
"A bit more simplistic than I was expecting, the Brettanomyces character is really quite muted at this time; this would have been a welcome boost to the complexity of this brew and perhaps this will develop a bit more with time. If the yeast character was a bit more interesting I would almost call this a great example of a Saison (though it does lean a bit more towards a clean Berliner Weiss); it is light and refreshing and the lactic character adds a nice touch but is not overwhelming."
"D- I can drink a whole bottle of this easily and still want more. I have no idea what the ABV is on this beer but I would love to put this back all afternoon during a hot summer day."
"Bottle labled bottled on 1/12/09. Poured a medium and hazy yellow color with a smaller sized white head. Aromas of wheat, cereal, and lighter citrus. Tastes of citrus, wheatiness, cereal, and lighter spices. Lighter tart finish."
"T: Overriding sourness, but strangely slick with a complete lack of puckering - which I find impressive! Perhaps the easiest sour beer I've had yet. Sweet, tangy lemon from beginning though mid until a grassy-ness tries to fight through, only to be overpowered by the tang. Finishes clean with only slight lingering flavor."
"D: Easily drinkable. I usually take a little more time when drinking a beer, but I find myself taking bigger mouth-fulls of this one, so it's going down pretty easy and fast."
"Easy drinker. Light, not a lot of mid or finish. Ok nose with slight funk and very slight sour. Maybe a beer to intro people to this style. But ver light and not complex. Though with 3-6 months of bottle conditioning age I could see a bit more happening. There are others in this style I'd rather pick up."
"D: Very drinkable, very refreshing. Compared to the German versions I've tried, this beer is more accessible. It's almost like they blended a small amount of an APA or another mild style into it. The Berliner Weissbier tang is there, but there was little actual pucker in my mouth. I hope that more American breweries take up this style if they can achieve results like this. Then again, I wonder how much my reaction is from just being able to have this beer very fresh, while the German beers suffer from the time lag of importing. In any event, I hope that people try this beer and realize that it's a style that has the potential for returning to popularity among American palates."
"If you want something more complex and floral, try the 1809. If you want something with way more lactic sourness, try the Bruery Hottenroth."
"Medium-high carbonation, slightly tart and refreshing. Excellent for a summer beer."
"Cheers!"
"Drinkability: Intensely drinkable. A great beer."
