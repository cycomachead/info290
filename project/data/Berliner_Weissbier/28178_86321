Taste has sharp tartness off the bat and tart raspberry/cranberry juice. Sharp wheat character comes through mid palate, with gentle fruit character and mild tartness well into the finish. Medium light palate, high carbonation. A very nice fruited Berliner, and having this in the dead of winter probably doesn't do this justice.","liamt07","Jan 11, 2013"

4.27,8.4,4.25,4,4.25,4.5,4.5,"Overall: This beer really surprised me and I enjoyed it quite a bit. The focus is definately on the raspberries. I would seriously consider this beer as an alternative to a table beer that would normally hold up to alot of different and deverse food pairings from appetizers, cheese, salads, light pasta dishes, sushi/seafood, and even some desserts. I dont know alot about a berliner wiess style beer, but this beer has captured my interest. Pipeworks did a good job with this beer. I would not hesitate to pick up another bottle of this beer. Its a creative concept that Pipeworks had here to just brew the berliner wiess with raspberries instead of serving it with the traditional raspberry syrup.","4DAloveofSTOUT","Dec 17, 2012"

Small dots of lace slowly drip into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, yeast, and raspberries. Taste is much the same with a mild vomit or bile note on the finish. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer but the flavor on the finish throws me off a bit.","UCLABrewN84","Dec 01, 2012"

3.7,-6.1,4,4,3.5,4,3.5,"The final beer of the day, from Clybourn to Mundelein. Damn. Anyway, this stuff pours a clear magenta topped by a finger of light pink-white foam. The nose comprises tart raspberry must and a touch of what seems like vague wheat way the hell in the background. make no mistake: the raspberries are the stars here. The taste brings in more of the same, though the tartness overshoots the berry-ness, creating a feeling of just straight and general tartness. I was looking forward to some actual raspberry flavor, but was stymied. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a decidedly dry finish. Overall, a solid Berliner, but the raspberries, despite being in control, don't exert their berry-forward selves throughout. Still enjoyable, though...","TMoney2591","0"

Could be more crisp, it's a little thin bodied at first, but not out of place for the style. Tart raspberry through and through. Fruity and drinkable, some light minerals and sourdough from the yeast. A Berliner with the classic Himbeere flavor built right in.","emerge077","0"
