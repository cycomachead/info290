"Overall not bad but not what I expected, little watery, decent sour and more toasty wheat."
"O - Overall I enjoyed it, very soft and subtle."

"Recommended, only because I'm not sure what it cost, anything over $9 and I'm not sure it's a good value. Misses style only slightly. Very refreshing brew for a hot winter day."

"O: This had all the components for a great berliner, except for the one that is arguably most important - taste. I'll give JK a pass, as this is the most disappointing I've had, but still not bad. A little above average overall. I'll try again next year if released again, but won't trade my life away to obtain it."

"Big thanks goes out to funkydelic for sharing this one at a past Random Sunday Tasting! Served from bottle into a Mikkeller taster flute. Poured golden yellow with a one finger white head that subsided to a minimal amount slowly. Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, lemon, citrus, tart, sour, and lemon rine. The flavor was of sweet malt, earth, citrus, earth hop, spice, bell pepper, and funk. It had a light feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this was a pretty decent brew. Upon taking in the aroma I was thinking that I was in for something special, however the flavor was a little bit lacking as compared to the aroma. While it was still good, it just didn’t have quite the amount of complexity and acidity that I got in the aroma. The flavor was a good bit more earthy. Glad I got the opportunity to finally try this one and wouldn’t mind doing so again in the future to see how it develops over time."
"Very light and thin with a weak head that dissipates to nothing in seconds. Almost no smell with just a whiff of ""maybe something has turned in the fridge."" Even the flavor of rare can't help this one. Water with a touch of plain yogurt and powdered vitamin C."

"O - Funky, acidic and citrus with a sweet bready finish."

"O: I like this beer a lot. I rated it higher than I would because the last one I had was so much more sour. Either way it's a fun beer to have, I just prefer it to be more sour."

"I am enjoying this beer, but it is definitely lacking the tartness that I was expecting. Its somewhere in the middle of a wheat beer and a berliner."

"This is a light bodied brew with a moderate amount of carbonation. It is light and easy drinking but displays just a bit too much focus on malt and not enough tartness. The residual sweetness is a bit much and it overall is lacking the tartness and crisp snap to the finish that I look for in the style. As a summertime beer, it is fitting and something I could throw back pretty effortlessly but considering the trouble getting it and the price tag, there are others out there I would opt for instead of this one."

"O: Great session beer. I enjoy Austin Beerworks Einhorn a little better, but this hit the spot for an after work pre-dinner drink."

" I apologize for how hard this is to describe, but I realllly wanna find some more like this, try it if you get a chance. I have a feeling that this is a really polarizing beer though."

"O: definitely one of the better offerings from JK. Pretty solid brew all around, glad I tried it."

"[Edit: Tried this on tap at Jester King in early '12, and it was much better. Gave it a 4/5 as a 'had']"
"Though I'm not the most experienced in Berliners, this was just boring and lacked a lot..."
""
"O: Very light, refreshing. Great beer for the warm weather."
"O: Another solid offering from JK. Liked this one a lot. Carbonation might come up a little more with bottle conditioning, but that is one of my only knocks on it."
""
"O: All around, this is a very nice beer. Very refreshing and enjoyable to a hot August day. Please make this many more times Jester King!"
"O: not a style i have a ton of familiarity with, but i found this very enjoyable. great evident sourness but not completely mouth puckering. wish this was available in 4 or 6 packs rather than 750s."
""
"This is a great beer and an even greater summer beer. The flavor and mouthfeel make for an enjoyable and refreshing drinking experience."
"O - Another fantastic job by Jester King, Bonnie the Rare is well done. The beer is truly in the style of a Berliner Weiss, has all the characteristics of that style. There is an interesting play going on between the tart citrus flavors and the malt, with the tartness winning out. I really enjoyed this beer."

"This delight pours a light, hazy golden-straw color. I pick up some funky, slightly tart and sour aromas, followed by a slightly tart and lemony taste. It’s light—delicate, perhaps—and has an effervescence that keeps it from getting bogged down by everything going on. Flavorful finish, like lemon zest or citrusy essential oils. Yum."
"Thin mouthfeel and low carbonation."
