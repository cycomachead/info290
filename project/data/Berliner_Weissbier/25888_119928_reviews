"Aroma of citrus zest, mango, peach, apricot, faint honey & green tea. Taste stone fruit, mild earthiness, shape citrus finish. Nice!"
"Overall - This just is not my style. I may have to try a more traditional Berliner Wiessbier to ensure it just wasn't this particular flavor, but this was too sour and funky for me. I rated it like I did because, according to the description, this is how these beers are supposed to be. Well, if that's the case, I don't like them, but I didn't want my personal view to cloud my reviewing judgement. Drink at your own risk."

"The beer is a light pink color with a thin, off-white collar. Aromas of grassy funk, herbal tea, peach, peach skin, kombucha. Moderate tartness with stone fruit and a mild earthiness. Some floral notes with a hint of berries. The finish offers a light puckering sensation with a moderate acetic quality. Complex and enjoyable. The peach character was more prominent the fist time I had this and nearly absent on the second occasion. A fun beer to drink, and definitely worth a try."
"D : definitely not true to style, but delicious with the addition of tea, which adds just a mild amount of sweeter floral notes to the nose and palate. Extremely drikable and refreshing."

" The taste is very good with lemony tangy and gentle tea-like herbal flavors with light wheat in the middle and slight toasted grain with gentle lactic element playing nicely with the tropical tea blend with a nice sour finish. Overall I really liked this but consider it a great berliner with subtlety enough sour flavor to keep things interesting and the tea adds to the blend of tastes well."

"Flavor is much he same despite the papaya front and center on the label it just doesn't come across. Still, as a hibiscus Berliner, it's pretty enjoyable for what it is. Light bodied, crisp and tart. Finishes dry with a slight pucker. It's not bad, just was hoping for more tropical fruit and complexity."

"Flavor starts off with a sharp yet light tartness as expected from the style. There is some nice fruity tartness and sweetness that attempts to show up but is quite mild and light as expected. The tea notes seem more prominent in the flavor with herbal and grassy notes mixed in with the tartness. Yummy and refreshing brew. The tea gives the brew a nice dimension even though everything is very light and refreshing."

"a rad take on a classic berliner. tropical fruit all through it, but ever losing its lactic sourness or bright refreshing carbonation. pink tinted, murky, but still bright because of the bubbles and the airy white head. it has a nose of tart tropical fruit, maybe passion fruit seeds, white wheat in high dose, and a familiar lacto profile, truer to the style here at its base than many american incarnations. flavors of guava and papaya come up in the middle of an otherwise very classic berliner. there is a floral element, sort of in the yeast, that really comes out in the finish that is awesome with the sourness. its about mid scale on the sour spectrum, just right for session drinking. this is the ultimate summer beer this year i think, and at under 10 bucks a bomber, its super reasonable. instead of adding funny fruit or botanical syrups to the berliner, i like this with the fruit added for me. its in perfect proportion, not too sweet, different enough, and very genuine. good bubbles, light body but frothy in feel, not dumbed down. dialed in, even by perennials high standards, this is elegant and delicious beer, sure to be a crowd pleaser."

"Peach to amber in color with a bit of haziness. Head is virtually nonexistent. Aroma of tropical tea with a hint of wheat. Mango and passion fruit are present. The body is light and this is meant to be fairly drinkable,but the sweetness prevents that from happening."
