Sediment is seen around the bottom of the bottle. Some light streaking lacing is seen when sipped but not a bunch. The aroma is of tart citrus zest. Bit more going on with the taste is it is slightly sour BUT good as this is the style of brew this is. Totally different type of brew but good actually. No bitter or hoppy aftertaste just makes you pucker-up some. Lighter bodied with high carbonation but seems to work for this one. Overall, kinda like this one.","BeerWithMike","Jan 03, 2015"

Flavor is lightly tart wheat malt, some hay, dry funk, and a bit of a dirty finish (something that always happens for me with the style). Very light bodied with spritzy carbonation.

4.1,1.5,,,,,,"Lemon, lactic, and acetic acid dominate the aroma, accompanied by grain and light floral notes. Flavor reveals a light, clean base of crackery pilsner malt, along with a touch of wheat in the finish. Lactic acid lies beneath, in an interesting way. It hits upfront and dissipates as soon as the mouth is opened, but it can linger as long as the mouth is closed. Notes of lemon and acetic acid surface in the aftertaste. Excellent beer. Great restraint in the sour character, as compared to most released these days, but still a flavor punch.","barczar","Oct 23, 2014"

Flavor starts off with initial tartness. It's pretty tart but there is a level of balance with the other flavors. Whet and grains after the tartness. Has a cider element to it. One of the more drinkable takes on the style. The sourness isn't parching like other Berliners. A good amount of body for such a minimal beer.","VelvetExtract","Oct 17, 2014"

4,-1,,,,,,"Overall: I'm glad I tried it. For someone looking for a change of pace (such as myself) on a hot, humid summer day(such as today) it's perfect. It wouldn't mind having a couple more of these laying around my fridge. However it's a bit pricey at $8.99 + tax for four 12 oz. bottles. I am aware the style generally boast a lower abv, but I mean come on, I spend that kinda money I want to at least get near a proper buzz. And the thing, while quite tasty, doesn't immediately signal "beer" to me. I'm a heavyweight not no featherweight that's just how I get down. I just don't see myself drinking this (or perhaps it's the style) on the reg. 85/100","LovingCup","Aug 24, 2014"

3.96,-2,,,,,,"Pours a cloudy yellow with a finger of white head that retains nicely.  Nose features heavy wheaty/bready notes paired with lemon zest, tangy yogurt, and doughy yeast.  Taste starts with a flash of tartness, this is quickly balanced by candied lemon, orange rind, bready wheat, and a dry finish.  Mouthfeel is light and moderately carbonated. Overall, a nice easy drinking berliner.","homebrew311","Aug 21, 2014"

4.25,5.2,4.25,4.25,4.25,4.25,4.25,"Taste follows suit with tart puckering lacto, and a berryish gooseberry note in the middle, it's not sweet but lends a subtle fruitiness. Crisp, tart and dry. Very light and drinkable, it was gone before I blinked twice. Lends itself well to summer six pack drinking.","emerge077","Beers"
