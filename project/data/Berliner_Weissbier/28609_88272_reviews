"Pours the color and clarity of cranberry juice with a loose head that dissipates into a tight band around the shoulders.  The nose pretty much smells like potpourri.  The taste on this beer is weird - I feel like I'm drinking one of those spiced candle tart warmers.  Mouthfeel is light in body with an even carbonation and a slight astringency.  Overall, I love the style because of its subtleties; however, this beer lacked those aspects.  Hopefully it was just an off-batch."
"I love the Night Shift berliner series and this beer is a great representative of it. Fruit forward, good balance and very drinkable. Definitely worth trying."
"Very good. Moderately sour. Light fruit. Beautiful color."

"Bottle. Like Ever Weisse by them, this beer is absolutely gorgeous. Pours a reddish purple. Body is clear. Almost the color of Pinot Noir. Blueberry juice color for sure. Soft, airy head that fizzles away quickly. The color is a pretty pinkish purple. The aroma brings forth some incoming tartness. Acidic scent. Tart fruit. Some wheat that reminds me of a blueberry pie or other blueberry pastry. Soft cinnamon, almost unnoticeable at first, when very cold. The bottle tells me to drink it at 45 degrees so I patiently wait for it to warm up and the aroma becomes more intense, slightly less sour and displays more cinnamon and wheat. The flavor is a big zap of tart berries. Not just a blueberry flavor; it's a unripe berry medley. It's very sour!  Acidity is very high, leaving my lips tasting sour as well. The cinnamon is soft at first but grows with warmth. Finishes with a pastry wheatiness that complements the berries. Not sure what batch this is but the label says 5.6% and was bottles on 12/22/14. Body is light and it's fairly dry. High carbonation. Lingering tartness. I thought this one was a great success. Their Weisse series has been great and more than makes up for a few duds along the road."

"Drank a batch 7, bottled 11/18/2013 on 1/9/2015.  Had lost all of its blue/purple color and was a golden color instead (thus the low Appearance score) and was excessively lactic with out any discernible fruit flavor.  Was still a nice, if extremely sour, Berliner Weisse, but was not 'special' as expected."

"Overall:   Got to love how the sweet Maine blueberries balance out the tart and pucker notes.  Definitely worth trying this one again.  A little more cinnamon character would be good since  it was hard to detect."

"Vinegar, not great.  Slightly watery."

"Reminded of Blueberry Yogurt - Didnt really pick up on the cinnamon sticks -- Very interesting and look forward to trying it in the future"

"Overall: Refreshing beer in multiple senses. Do not know who else brews anything similar, or would as well with the task"

"Pour is faintly hazed pure orange with no head.  Nose has a ton of plastic, very off aromas, odd spice, def not cinnamon.  No blueberry in the nose whatsoever, tons of acetic.  Taste is root beer that burns, faint cinnamon, plastic, sweet sugars and citric acid, high carb, heavier body.  Extremely sour and burning around the outside of the mouth."

"Tart and puckering with strong sour acidity and slight acetone character. Not too harsh or solvent like though. Spicy cinnamon adds a nice touch to the bread/yeast, wheat and acidic flavors . Slight mineral quality in the finish but again, I'm not picking up much blueberry. A bit one dimensional but the cinnamon is a nice touch and a unique take on the style. Slightly harsh but decently drinkable."

"Berliners are Night Shift doing what they do best and this is no exception. Despite the lack of blueberries the play between tart and cinnamon was unique and pleasant."
""
""
"O - This is the second Berliner Weiss of theirs that I've tried and I really, really like them. An outstanding New England beer!"

"O: An excellent and refreshing sipper. Clean, flavorful and smooth overall. Blueberry isn’t prominent but the cinnamon adds an interesting touch. Thanks again AutumnBeerLove."

"This is a light bodied brew with a modest amount of carbonation. This is a very, very sour brew yet fruity and unique/interesting. The acedic aspects coupled with brine and vinegar make this more harsh than drinkable unfortunately."
"Easier to enjoy all the individual flavour components compared to Somer Weiss which was less complex. Very acidic and tart for the Berliner style, which I really don't mind. Would recommend this over Somer Weiss and Fallen Apple, but Ever Weiss is the best of them all."

"2 month old bottle. Pours rose hue with not much head. Smells of funk, tart apple, spiced cinnamon, clove. Taste earthy with a bit of funk, tart apple, vinegar. Feel is medium carb with a slight thinness. Not nearly overly sour but more spiced than I would have thought. Tasty early afternoon drinker but would have liked a bit more blueberry notes"
"As noted in my introduction, this was the last of three bottles of Mainer Weisse purchased at the brewery release party in mid-October. While I enjoyed the first and second bottles, I found them to be almost tongue-bucklingly sour, with the potency of the sourness overshadowing the complexity of the beer's other flavors. With the extra bit of time on this particular bottle, however, some of that brash sourness has disappeared, allowing the other flavors in the beer to come out of hiding and have their turn in the spotlight. A tart, refreshing, and nuanced Berliner. Very nice, Night Shift, very nice indeed."

"Sweet and tart. To me, one of their tartest. I thought the cinnamon worked well."
"This is quite a charming Berliner Weiss. It's tart and funky, with some nice blueberry notes. At times this kind of walks the line between a sour and a Berliner Weiss. And that's not a bad thing."
"It's my definition of a dessert beer. Tart, but the cinnamon adds a nice element that evokes some kind of blueberry dessert. Delightful and assertively tart."

"Overall it's hard to drink, it has so much sour and acidic bite, nice tartness and funk, a bit too much on the gym sock funk too, nice tart fruit but not a lot of blueberry, just so hard to really like this despite how good it could be."
"Beautiful pink body. This beer looks like a peeled blueberry. I was very excited to get into this beer. All I got on the nose and from the taste was unripened blueberry tartness. This one was a little more acidic than I would expect from a fruited berliner. My favorite part of the taste was the finish of slightly sweetened cinnamon on the very back end. I kept drinking just for that. It was so interesting. I was hoping for more blueberry and less lemony tartness in the taste personally."

"The beer pours a murky pinkish-yellow with a small white head that doesn’t last but does leave a nice ring of white bubbles around the glass. The head leaves a thin, stringy lacing around the glass. In body, the beer is opaque and cloudy. On the nose, this beer smells of tart lemon, green apple, and yogurt. There is a faint touch of blueberry, indiscriminate spice and wheat flakes. On the tongue, the beer tastes very tart and acidic with just a wisp of sweet fruitiness and not much else. As the beer warms, the harshness mellows slightly but this beer is not very balanced and leans too heavily on its sourness. Compared to other weisses that Night Shift offers, this beer is a little out of whack. In flavor the beer tastes sour apple, sour lemon, yogurt, and chalk. The faintest touch of blueberry can be sensed, but I honestly think that is because I know there is blueberry in the beer. No cinnamon can be sensed, but I do pick touches of indiscriminate, hot spice on the tongue. The finish is quick and muted with sour fruit and the aftertaste is of puckering lemon. In the mouth, the beer feels on the light side of medium in body. Carbonation is a little fiercer than a medium level, but the beer is puckering and fierce in mouthfeel, with a touch of slickness. The mouth is left full of saliva and puckering from the sour shock of this beer. Overall, I am disappointed with this beer. Night Shift has really impressed me in the past with their Sour Futures program and the fruited weisses that they can pump out; this beer however, is just too sour. The acid bulls over any other nuance that the beer might have and makes the beer harder to drink. Night Shift usually does an amazing job of bringing fresh fruit flavors into their beer but they missed the mark with this vintage. This isn't a horrible beer but its a little too unbalanced for me."

"This beer pours a blueish purple color with a pink head. The smell is lactic sour with a definite blueberry smell and hints of cinnamon. The flavor is very similar to the smell with the sourness coming through the most with hints of blueberry and just a touch of cinnamon. I was not sure how cinnamon was going to work in this sour but it integrated really well with the blueberries. The mouthfeel is lite dry very well carbonated. Overall this is a great beer, and while not a traditional take on the style I am beginning to enjoy the fruited Berliners more and more. Just saves the time of adding syrup."
