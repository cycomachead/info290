4.25,2.4,3.5,4,4.5,4.25,4.25,"As good as the nose is, the palate is a whole different beast. This is thoroughly unconventional, lacking in the clean, bready lactic sourness of the traditional berlinerweisses and in its stead, it has a potent and inspired juicy, fruit tartness with a blend of preserved lemons, pineapple, heavily soured yogurt (if you've had yogurt in a tropical country in the summer, you know what I mean), moderate funk - a little bit of earth and mushroom are present - along with a hint of bread. The mid-palate continues the exploration of fruit as an expression in a Berlinerweiss, with semi-ripe white grapes, a blend of sourness, stone fruit and some citrus. Light in body, moderately carbonated, this beer has a long, tart finish, moderately yogurty and mostly fruity. While this beer is not a pure berlinerweiss, it is an inspired and an enjoyable beer. Highly recommended.","DefenCorps","Dec 29, 2014"

I'm not a big sour fan, so maybe that's part of the problem, but I really felt the sour component in this beer was completely over the top. I'm assuming there is a considerable amount of lactic acid in this beer, as it struck me as the kind of beer that would give me an upset stomach pretty quickly were I to try to drink a bunch of it (the bartender indicated he liked the beer quite a bit, but admitted it was hard to imagine drinking very much of this - he agreed that drinking a lot of this would probably give a lot of people a stomach ache.). De Garde seems to be well thought of, so I'll definitely give some of their other beers a try, but IMHO this was not an exceptionally impressive effort on their part.","John_M","Jun 24, 2013"
