"Pours a murky orange with a foamy off-white head that settles to a partial film on top of the beer. Small streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is sour and tart with malt, grain, and fruit aromas. Taste is much the same with fruit and grain flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of acidity on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer that is tasty and easy to drink."

"Fantastic."

"Overall - It's a plain berliner, so there's not much to look for. It's mostly clean and easy to drink. Something in the back is off though."

"O: this is one of the best Berliners I've ever had. It's everything I want in a BW: it has bright, crisp clean flavors, a nice tart punch, good lacto presence, a slight hint of Brett funk."

"8.7/10"
"Overall: This is very light and true to the style. I'm happy I tried it and would have more."

"3.0 D: It's tasty, but it falls close to average for the style."

"The mouthfeel is thin with moderate carbonation. Overall a very cool and interesting beer. Definitely the most fruity, citrusy version of the style I can remember having, but pretty good as well."
"All in all a nice drinkable berliner weissbier and one I would order again."
"This is a light bodied brew with a light level of carbonation which is quite low for the style. It is easy drinking and an interesting take on the style. Seemingly no inclusion of alcohol in this brew. I really appreciated the chance to give this brew a try and really enjoyed this second attempt at the style more so than the first. Keep it up Brad, each try gets better and better!"
"Golden orange color with a the slightest haze. Not much carbonation, a few whispy white bubbles pop up here and there. Aromas are of tart peach and lemon. Very citrusy sour aromas. Flavor is cool, light apricot fruit sweetness up front with an evolving sour rush of tart citrus and funky dried fruits. Finish is quick and light, a little hint of a metallic note pops out but washes back away in the funk and lingering fruit flavors. A really good beer, hope it is around for regular brewpub drinking in the future."
"If only there were no chlorine notes."
"O - An enjoyable summer beer, I'm a fan. Lots of orange citrus, very refreshing, and a nice level of tart. I could drink this all day long at 4%. Looking forward to trying this again in the future."
"Poured into a Jester King snifter, this beer pours a light golden straw color. Fairly clear with just a hint of bright white head. Smells a bit off with a lemon chemical scent and some grains. Taste is lacking as well and somewhat off. Not much sourness or tartness. Mouthfeel is fine and appreciate this is a summery beverage, but this is a style that I greatly enjoy and there are far better examples."
"Overall this was a great beer, this is the type of stuff I would like to see more of!"
"Beer does not improve in the mouth, it is mildly sour on the finish but the front half is candy like and sweet with caramel notes and a pretty heavy body for a berleiner. Oh well, they can't all be winners."
"The beer is transparent and light yellow in color, with a thin, white head. The nose is full of lemon flavors, with a slight mustiness about it. While the flavor wasn't bad, I found it a bit lacking. The absence of any lactic, sour, funky notes kept this beer from being special. The flavor is basically a light, summery ale with lemon flavors and a subtle musty finish. I really enjoy Berliner Weissbier, but this one came up a bit short, in my opinion."
"Massive thanks goes out to mikesgroove for sharing this one at an impromptu Hobo Tasting #7 which turned out to be a good time in an Ingles parking lot out of the trunk of my Audi with my AR-15 in-check to keep the haters out! Served from growler into a Southern Tier tulip. Poured yellow-orange with a one finger white head that subsided to a minimal amount quickly. Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, funk, and fruit. The flavor was of sweet malt, funk, cherries, and dark fruit. It had a medium feel on the palate with low carbonation. Overall, yes! Funk!? Yes, please. This one worked really well together and came together nicely. The funk aspect added to the flavor profiles of a good Berline Weiss are quickly becoming a favorite for me and this one is no exception. Both the aroma and flavor on this one are exceptional. I could easily down A LOT of this one in one sitting with no problem. Really glad I got to try this one and I hope to sample more in the future (hint hint traders!)."
"Overall not the most typical version of the style but it really worked quite well. The extra bit of tartness really came across very nicely and gave it a nice little punch at the end that was much needed. Another classic, really starting to love this brewery."
"Pours a nice semi-cloudy light apricot color with a good, thin white head. Little bit of lacing. The nose brings forward a nice amount of lactic character with just a touch of light funk lingering in the background. Nice tartness comes through along with a smidgen of grain. Everything is light and airy--nothing is overwhelming and all is in great balance. Moderate carbonation and a beautifully dry and lactic finish. Well done."
"I talked to Brad about this and read the description and found this beer to be very close to the traditional Berliner(s) I've had despite its very nontraditional composition. Brad said there are still a few minor tweaks he'd like to give this beer to dial it in perfectly. If you ask me, this one is about perfect already."
"The beer is not real sour but it is an easy drinker."
"Pours a light murky yellowish orange with a bit of nice crisp white head that dissipates quickly. Smells nicely tart and sweet. A light funkiness that floats over a wheaty smell. Tastes lit and wheaty with a twrtrness that is very subtle and melds well with the beer. Overall the flavours are very complimentary. It ain't no fritz briem but im really starting to love Berliner weiss beers!"
"O-not one of their best, but definetly worth a try."
