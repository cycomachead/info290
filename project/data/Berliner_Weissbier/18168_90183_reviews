"Wonderful full bodied sour, maybe a bit of malic acid taste, could also be lactic acid taste. In any event, it's kind of like the stuff they sprinkle on those super sour gummie worms..."

"Pale yellow pour, hazy, with a tiny bubbly head that disappeared pretty much completely, leaving no lacing on the glass. Not unusual for the style. Aroma was pretty muted, light scents of soured grains and sweet corn. The taste was predominantly grainy, toasted wheat, light sweetness, some lemony tartness mid-palate, with a big grainy finish. Body was light, carbonation was low, mouthfeel was less lively than I prefer for a Berliner. Not bad overall, but nothing I'd go back for."

"Very drinkable. Light body, well-carbonated, goes down really easily."

"Im thinking if they just bottled it with double the carbonation, it would be a bit better. Its just too flat and one dimensional for me. Im a big fan of Peekskill BC, but this one just didn't hit the mark for me."

"O: Being nice and light, this beer is easy to drink and exhibits some refreshing properties."

"Overall, the best sour I've ever had. Starts tart, fades fast into thin, refreshing citrus with a mildly sour finish. Outstanding sour beer."

"O: Very enjoyable and refreshing on a hot summer afternoon. Light in flavor and body makes this one real easy to drink."

"This is a super refreshing wonderful beer. Of saisons, hefes, and summer styles, this is what I would love to drink. Granted, I would like a wheat hefe with its malt maybe sometimes, but this really pushes the other way and is just lovely."
"Great intro to the world of sours type of beer."

"o - Overall a very nice berliner; the nose is great, full of sour fruits and funk. While the taste isn't quite on par, it is very good as well. Would definitely have it again and glad to see another good beer from Peekskill."
""
""
"This is a pretty intense Berliner Weisse. Probably more so than others that seem to carry less body and more citrus. This also seems more wheat forward than anything else. I will also say it seems more one dimensional than I would like. Kind of a punch and then that's what you get."
""
"O- such an enjoying beginning to a tart brew that chief will build upon. Really like this and hope its year round!"
""
""
""
""
"This is exactly what you would expect it to be."

"A simple sour, as its name implies, that could be the base beer for some dynamite things to come. Delicious. Glad I brought home four growlers to share."
