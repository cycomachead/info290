Fairly true to style, although much higher ABV, although you'd hardly notice the difference between this and a 2-3% ABV berliner. Perhaps a bit too acidic, but thirst quenching nonetheless.","kevanb","Aug 17, 2014"

Smell is sour with malt, grain, fruit, funk, and acidic aromas. Taste is much the same with sour grain, fruit, and acidic flavors on the finish. There is a medium amount of acidity on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel.

Anyway, this stuff pours a lightly hazy straw topped by a finger or so of white foam. The nose comprises tart lemon zest, sour green apple, lactic wheat, and soft powdered sugar when all of the sourness has passed. The taste brings in more of the same, with that tart citrus really rocking the initial tastes. A mild vinegar character peeks in at times as well, but never stays long to chat. The body is a hefty light, with a light moderate carbonation and a dry, sticky finish. Overall, a very nice B-Weiss, one that definitely brings the tart without overdoing it.","TMoney2591","Oct 19, 2012"

More of a lemony citric tartness. A slight grain coats the tartness and the yeast comes in towards the finish with a bit of spice, maybe cloves. Finish is drying and a bit acidic. Quite refreshing.
