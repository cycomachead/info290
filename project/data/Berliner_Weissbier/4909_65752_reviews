"O- Overall this is a nice berliner.  I'm surprised by the dryness of the body.  It gives the impression of a sour champagne.  The brett and the yeast are definitely more present in the nose than in the flavor and mouthfeel.  This is a nice sour-but its pretty simple rather than complex.  I'm definately looking for more wheat characteristics in a berliner too."

"O /D-The nose was shy but the flavor really crazy and I enjoyed it a lot. A ton of flavor at 3%. What a cool beer."

"O: As someone who really enjoys this style and sourness to a beer in general, I am impressed with the amount of flavors packed into this beer considering the low ABV - I could drink many of these in a day. So refreshing!"
""
""
"Overall - Lots of mouth puckering sour flavour going on. But it still remains quite drinkable and refreshing even. It's a little one dimensional taste wise, but still a solid beer."
""
""
""
"Lightly hazed pale blonde, one finger of white head that went to nothing in seconds, no lace at all. Smell is full on funk, brett, fruity, lemons, acidic and almost lambic like on the nose, seriously funky stuff. Taste is funky and very tart, apple, lemon and other fruits as well, some brett mustiness, acidic and sour with a suprisingly bready malt aftertaste. High carbonation, dry and lightly syrupy. I had no idea how good this was going to be, had no idea what this even was at first, really impresive stuff here."

"O: This is a quality berliner. I'm not sure I picked up a lot of Brett funk in the flavor, but I didn't have the base beer to compare. As a side note, before the last quarter of the glass, I added a small amount of the green syrup to compare. The sweetness completely hid the sour and tart aspects of the beer, which to me ruined the appeal of the brew. I would not add the syrup again, but it was an interesting service. Per the bartender, it is served that way in Germany to make the sour beer more appealing to children."
""
"Oh yes. Gimme, gimme that Brett. Nice funky tones, but mild ones. Some banana wrapped up in there. Super smooth and extremely easy to drink. This is a nice Berliner Weisse. Too bad we can't have more of them like this. Or, just more of them, period."
""
""
"Bottle: Poured a hazy pale yellow ale with a large pure white bubbly head with strong carbonation but not much retention or lacing. Aroma of funky barnyard notes and sour notes are more dominant then expected. Taste is a complex mix between loads of Brett with some tart and sour notes with a dry finish. Body is about average with strong carbonation. Interesting though maybe a tad too sour to be an everyday type of beer."
""
"O- I really enjoyed this beer. It's a very tasty, drinkable Berliner, definitely give this a try if you see it."
"O - Probably the best commercial berliner I've tried. Since the brett was so prominent I'm pretty sure this has a bit of age on it. Not as drinkable as others of the style though due to the intense sourness."
"I remember having this back-to-back with the un-brett-ed version, but I never got around to getting my thoughts together. Here we go a-rectifyin'. This stuff pours a clear pale straw topped by a finger of white foam. The nose comprises lemon rind, wheat, light brett, and grass. The taste brings in more of the same, along with a light but distinct cut of tart lemon. The body is a hefty light, with a light moderate carbonation and a dry, sticky finish. Overall, a very nice B-Weiss, one that seems helped a touch by the brett addition."
""
""
"This is quite simply an enjoyable beer, which I think is accessible even to those who don't much care for the style (case in point is my wife, who doesn't generally like sours, but enjoyed this one thoroughly)."
"Drink- This was all over the place with its individual parts. All that mattered is that it tastes good. Probably would want a bottle but wont actively seek it out."
""
"o - Overall a pretty nice berliner. Not super sour or anything, but the taste has some light sourness and funk to it which I liked a lot. Worth checking out and I would have it again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Incredibly pale yellow color with a huge white head. The nose is very light and lactic. Lemon peel, straw, and a light funkiness. Very minimal malt or wheat aromas. The flavor is, somehow, even lighter. Very spritzy. Light lemon peel, a touch of grass, and the lightest flavors of wheat. Just a hint of tartness on the finish."
""
"Berliner weisses are one of my favorite styles of beer to drink in the summer. Although this example was quaffable and refreshing, it could have benefitted from more complexity."
""
""
""
""
""
"D - Very drinkable. Powerfully funky and tart, but extremely tasty. Really nice complexity."
""
"O: I was a bit weary based on the look and smell of this beer, but the taste and mouthfeel are just spot on, and that's far more important to me. This is a perfect late Spring/early Summer beer. Refreshing, but still complex and interesting. Plus, at 3%, you can drink in the Summer heat without worrying too much about getting wasted or dehydrated. I'm definitely going to pick up a couple more of these while I can."
""
""
"On tap at Blue Monk. A good tartness, akin to an unsweetened lemonade, with a little brett and I believe malt to make it drinkable. Very good drinkability, suitable carbonation. Yellow body with a small white head. A good representation of what is often a yummy style."
"This beer is perfect for almost everybody. A must buy if you see it."
""
""
""
"A pleasant surprise. I've been on a big berliner weiss kick lately and this has easily been the best I have had. The addition of brett and the amount of tartness present here, just cannot be beat. Awesome beer."
"I wouldn't want to bash this one for being overly sour, as it is a berliner weisse. I just wish is held on to the hint of malt that you get just before the finish."
"Pear juice like colour, murky yellow with a real transient head. No retention or lacing as expected. Nose is super lactic, lemon, weird funk notes (maybe some urine?) and wheat. Taste has a shredding lactic sourness, wheat and paler malt character, mild lemon. A really ripping tartness within the style (not on the level of some lambics however) that takes a bit of time to acclimatize to. Some green apple skins as well. Light, watery body and a puckering lingering drying mouthfeel. A solid berliner, refreshing if often overpowering. Would love to try this with some syrups."
""
""
""
"Pours a cloudy pale yellow with a nice head. Nose is sour lemons with a bit of Bretty funk. Taste is sharp, sour lemons up front that move to a bit of a funkiness then a lot more sourness. Really nice Berliner. Spritzy, carbonation leaves a dry finish. Overall, this is a really nice Berliner, best I have had to date. Highly recommended!"
""
"Overall, a great refreshing beer, brett angle hits on the nose, but is sort of lost after repeated sips. No complaints, still solid and quite a fun beer."
"Pours a bright golden straw color with some haze, bubbly and prickly white head. Scent leads with a big push of tart, acidic and earthy funk, took a while before light notes of sweet breads and faint candied lemony citrus came through. Taste brings bold tart and acidic notes, combines with moderate earthy funkiness, fresh dried grain and hay, light fruitiness with some candied lemon and a touch of white grape. Lighter side of medium bodied, bubbly and refreshing, bone dry. Overall a fantastic surprise that exceeded any expectations, unique take on style and impressively refreshing despite the boldness. Another winner from this brewery."

"Overall. Great beer for this sunny spring afternoon. Light, refrshing and delicious."
"Pours a clear, pale straw color with a large, creamy white head that slowly fades away to nothing. Pleasant funky and lactic nose, with lemon and light citrus, some bread. Flavor starts with a fruity, strong citrus juiciness before quickly turning lemon and lime sour and mildly funky. Slightly grassy throughout, and a pleasant lactic finish. Medium light body, crisp and well carbonated with a dry finish."
""
"Note: DO NOT drink an entire growler of this beer in a one-day session. You will regret it based on the pH imbalance in your stomach. You have been warned!"
""
""
"o- i did not know what to expect going into this beer. i did not think that so much flavor and tartness could be packed in such a low abv beer. simply wonderful."
""
"This is really tasty.  Nice blend of malt and yeast flavor."
""
"Overall – A fantastic Berliner Weis. I am ISO more of this for sure."
""
""
"This is delicious. Crisp, tart, and wonderfully refreshing. As mentioned above, I'd like the carbonation to be a bit lower, and the sourness in the flavor to be more balanced. But all around, a very nice berliner weiss."
""
"The CPJ"
"I would pay a shitton to buy 4 or 6 packs of this. It would rival SNPA as my go to beer in the summer. I think I like it more than even Hottenroth (gasp!)."
"O: Really tasty, probably my favorite example of this style that I've come across."
""
"All in all, If this was not 5 beans a bottle, this would be an all day beer. The yeast works wonders to an average beer and takes it there. Easy to gulp down and it won't get you drunk. Had this on tap fresh when it hit the docks and I enjoyed this semi aged bottle a bit better."
""
"Taste starts out with a sour tartness on the tongue, makes you pucker a bit but isn't overwhelming, Brett funk seeps in on the aftertaste, finishes dry and clean, carbonation is a touch high but is expected with a thin body, quite refreshing."
"Pours a hazy bright yellow with a thin white head. Smell is very tart, almost like a wild, but with some more regular light German beer flavor lingering in the background. Taste is very light and tart, very refreshing, almost like a cross between beer and lemonade, but not in the terrible way that combination actually tastes. Mouthfeel is very light-bodied with high carbonation. Overall, this beer is really fantastic, basically a perfect berliner."
"A great beer, very nice overall. If you like tart easy drinking beers, this one is a winner."
""
"11.2 oz bottle. Totally raging carbonation. Very audible mountainous head that eventually dissipates and mutes. Ghostly hazy straw color. Bright citrus floral smell - all yeast and bacteria aroma. First sip is awesome,O obviously lactic acid that coats the mouth and doesn't linger too long. Aftertaste is distinct cherry pie Brettanomyces Lambicus flavor. Tartness is just a bit more that normal for a berliner-weizen. Lactobacillus doesn't get lost though. Wheat body is depleted in fermentation, thin and dry as expected. But the wheat flavor isn't lost. This beer holds up amazingly for a 3%er. Kind of a tooth melter, my teeth hurt after drinking this one. But very worth while. This beer kicks ass."
"This is my first sampling of this style, so I may be way off the mark on this review. It was pretty good, but not very complex to me. Probably won't go out of my way for it. Almost like an American unfiltered wheat with tons of lem juice in it."
""
""
"O - A very good Berliner Weisse. Would definitely get this one again if I were to find it locally. If you are a fan of the style, definitely one to give a try."
""
""
""
"this is a really good berliner, one of the better i have ever had. at 3%, more please"
"Pours a hazy yellow with a thin white head - no lacing. The smell is just sour, with some grassy notes, maybe a little grain. The taste is clean and sour and crisp, though a tad yeasty, with a sharp mineral edge to it - obviously some nice water. It's thin and bright in the mouth, with a little slickness from the yeast. A delicious and drinkable beer. Thanks to Mandark for this one."
""
"Overall this was a really solid example of the style, and quite flavorful for such a low ABV offering. Really nothing amazing about it though, maybe it is just the style for me. I appreciated tasting it, but have no need to again anytime soon."
"O: Absolutely amazing. I would drink this every day if given the opportunity. Don't miss it if you spot it in a bottle store."
""
"Overall, I didn't read any reviews on this prior to trying, so I was expecting funk and a touch of sour.  But no, this is probably the sourest of sours I've had.  It's mouth puckering and i actually teared up.  Nothing complex about it, but a must try if you like intense sours."
""
"O - a truly great beer. pricey but worth picking up a bottle."
""
"O: Light, refreshing and fizzy with a sour twist. Delicious. Could drink this all day"
"O: A very good Berliner Weisse, very dry with a good amount of tart flavor mixed with wheat and citrus."
""
""
""
""
"O: It was refreshing and easy to get down, but I felt that it was a bit one-noted, as the tartness dominated all other flavors in the taste. I think with a bit more age there will be a better balance."
""
""
""
""
"o: Unique, I'm very glad I got to try this. Not something I'd crave often but I definitely enjoyed it."
""
""
""
"O: Overall it's a good beer and I would drink it again."
""
""
""
""
"D: An amazing sour berliner weisse that doesn't disappoint at all.  Very drinkable, yet, I want to sip smaller and smaller sips as the glass empties.  Extremely tasty and tart and an excellent little sour beer.  I'm going back to the beer store I saw these at in SC to clean them out tomorrow.  Fantastic!"
" This beer smells lovely, very funky and fruity. The taste is very dry and tart with a definite brett character. Not bad, but I wouldn't recommend."
""
"O - Great berliner weisse, and I enjoyed it. I had this on tap and was amazed, and it's still just as good out of the bottle. If looking for a sour forward berliner weisse, this is perfect."
""
""
"O: I was very impressed by this beer. It was the highlight of a night that included brews such as Black Tuesday and Sour in the Rye, and this one is only 3% (I still can't beleive that). Pick this one up if you can."
""
"Hazy white gold with a white head that pops and fizzes. Nose is the amazing and beautiful pineapple upside-down cake scent that comes from the mix of wheat and brett lambicus. Taste is tart, mildly sweet preserved lemon on pineapple upside-down. Awesome. Touch of flint mineral/well stone in the back end. Lemonade like body. I love love love this version. More please!"
"Overall: I am not sure I have mentioned that this is tart. Oh, and this is 3% abv - impressive."
""
"O- This beer is intense. A little overwhelming at first, but the more you get into it, the better it gets. Definitely not a session beer, but will be nice to pick up from time to time. I'll be back for more."
"This a delicious sour wheat beer. Given the intensity of the carbonation some people may be put off, but to pack that much flavor into a beer with 3%ABV is truly the work of an skilled brewmaster. (Thanks, Matthias! Keep sending your Leipzig Sour Beers to the United States and they will find their way into my glass.)"
""
""
""
""
"A good one overall. Not my favorite for the style, but a very nice find."
""
""
"O - This was a very interesting beer. Really enjoyed the initial intense sourness followed by the normal wheat qualities. Really enjoyable beer."
"The finest Berliner I have tried. Get it if you see it, you won't be disappointed."
"One of my favorite beers. Mouth-puckeringly sour, refreshing as hell and packed full as flavor for something at 3%. The light fruit flavors combine well with the wheat and grass, creating a citrus and grain sour bomb. While more intense than your average Berliner Style Weiss, it's still the peak of the style. Phenomenal."
"A delicious sour German wheat beer with a plethera of complexity packed into a 3% beer. More of these beers are welcome in my glass!"
"Overall: Very easy to drink. Tart and refreshing. I could literally drink this all night long."
"Yummm... this is an absolute treat. Great stuff!"
"Overall nice, super sour, move fruits and malts, great display of the lambicus wild yeast, without anything else really stepping in, but seems to lack much profile other than the sour fruit."
"O: I dig it, but not more than the classic."
"o: the aroma was a bit hard to get past and made me not want to drink this, but I'm glad I did. Nice use of brett and it works very well in this wheat beer. Flavors really pop in this one and the crispness of this drink from all of the carbonation help make it one of the more unique beers I've had in a while."
"Overall: The beer let out a loud hiss when I popped the cap-- as if it were going to gush all over the place. No problems, though. Maybe I've just not acquired a nose for this one yet, but the aroma is the second favorite quality I enjoy in any beer (after taste, of course!). While this beer ROCKED in every other category, I just couldn't get into the smell of it. Aside from smell, this one has everything I could ask for in a Berliner Weisse."
"Holy Bootsy Collins, Greg! This one's got the funk!"
"O - An amazingly complex take on one of my favorite oddball styles, it's ridiculous how much flavor is coaxed out of a 3% ABV beer!"
"Thanks to Sean for this... Light cloudy gold, nice head that forms quickly and stays a while, nice lacing... A light sourness with some wheat and a hint of grape skins... Taste is light sour, yummy totally drinkable... Nice moutfeel and super easy to drink... I would love to have this on a hot day"
"aroma is light sour and acidic tartness. green apples with a mix of light hay and sour grapes. simply remarkable. as it warms the crisp and clean sour flavor really starts to come through quite nicely as the light nature of it really becomes apparent as you take the first sip. remarkable that this much flavor is coming through. crisp, clean, refreshing and light the nature of this throws me for a loop, as if it simply could not get any better. crisp green apples dominate the flavor with a light grassy note coming in the finish along with an amazing dryness."
"O: Very refreshing. I would've liked a bit more tart/sour, but this was quite enjoyable."
"Light yellow with a a dense, off-white head with great retention, this looks good. The nose is super stinky and farty, mildly shitty. With time, this is fruity, tart and mildly vinous and very lactic. Still, this is extremely sulfury. The palate opens with a clean, lactic sourness, tart and low level of funk. Sulfur is moderate on the palate, lingering on the finish. Drying on the finish with a high level of carbonation, this is decent."
"Medium bodied with lots of tight carbonation up front and a tart funky bret presence that lingers throughout into a lingering dry finish. Although it's dry and funky, it's still light, crisp and refreshing. Very tart and dry without being too acidic. Underneath the dry, funky bret there are hints of earthy grass and straw as well as some spicy clove, banana and lemon juice. It's pretty tart but not as unpleasantly funky as the aroma suggests. Decently balanced and once you get over the initial palate shock it's pretty refreshing and quaffable."
"I'm so glad this masterpiece made its way to Philly. It's certainly one of the best of the style and the addition of Brettanomyces adds a new dimension without overshadowing the masterful balance."
"Original scores: 4.0 / 3.0 / 2.0 / 2.0 / 2.0"
"The beer is hazy and yellow, with a sizable white head. The aroma is a bit funky, tart, citric, and altogether enticing. The beer is teeming with flavor, and at a mere 3% abv. Quite impressive. The feel is thin and watery on the palate, in a pleasant and refreshing way. The flavor also brings forth the tantalizing tart citrus and funky brettanomyces found in the aroma. This would be an ideal beer to have on a hot summer day. I wish I had a keg of it at home."
"Really hazy pour, light straw color, pretty over-carbed with big bubbles. Wet horse blanket, brett funk, some lemon and a little wheat. The nose suggests funk, but the flavor is predominantly sour and tart. Very quenching and refreshing flavor of lemons, wheat, and sharp lactic sourness. Kind of thin and really carbed. A great refresher for the summer, superbly executed example of the style."
"Hazy and color brings to mind Pineapple juice. Carbonation factor is high.Get some funk in the aroma, not overpowering. I am picking up some wet hay in the background. Enjoying the taste quite a bit. Tart, refreshing. Like Fresca for a beer geek! Nice and crisp on the palate.Scrubbin bubbles! I think this would be a nice refresher between styles. I guess you could call this a nice piece of cheese :) Thanks to 7ways for throwing this in the box."
"Beer is wet and thin, easy drinking, I could kill a keg of this in a single day. It's like tart grainy water...super refreshing. I'm dinging it on the score because the Brett l character is a little muddled, I think this beer should be aged on unroasted oak to improve the back flavors with more tannic flavors on the finish. I've got one more of these and I'll drink it soon too."
"Squat bottle poured into a large tulip. Perfect for a beautiful afternoon in front of the grill. Loads of head, serious amounts that dissipate quickly and transition to nice lacing. Color is very nice cloudy golden. The nose is mostly sour peach. Flavor is slightly sour with loads of peach and melon. Overall, the flavor is not overpowering and lends itself to food. High carbonation and light flavor adds to the drinkability."
"O: An improvement over the original, but maybe a bit too intense. I'm not sure I'm terribly qualified to judge perfectly to the style as I've had only a few examples, but this is good, and will teach you all about brett's various characteristics, because there isn't too much else distracting from it."
"D - I could drink a lot of this. I just wish it tasted a little more like it smelled, as there was a pronounced drop-off in complexity and intensity."
"2012: Draft version... less Brett character, tart and crisp, nearly watery, seemingly less complex than the bottled version. Would put it behind 1809 in overall scores, but leaving bottle scores unchanged here."
"Overall a really delightful, light, and enjoyable beer for sour lovers."
"D - Very enjoyable and so easy to drink. It's such a perfect summer time brew...ultra chugable, but something you want to enjoy. Recommend."
"The beer tastes quite dry, which is accentuated by a lactic acid tartness, the fact that it is so light bodied and that it has a spritzy carbonation; all in all this makes for a very refreshing brew. Somehow this seems milky, I am not sure why but it seems to have something to do with the lactic acidity. This really doesn't seem any different than the regular version of this beer to me."
"This beer pours a hazy, bright straw yellow in color with a massive three finger, self destructing very fluffy white head. It took about three minutes to diminish to a root beer float like poof. It essentially looks like pale pear juice. It has the nice, dry, crisp sour notes with granny smith apple like aromas mixed with some strange funk. The funk is just strange. It's as if the brett hasn't found its place. The flavors aren't as numerous as the aromas. The flavor is pretty light and instantly a watery tart apple. It kind of ""refoams"" in your mouth and goes down like you're drinking foam. It's just a little strange. This beer was ok but I didn't like it as much as the Porticus. The brett took away from what I really appreciate in a Berliner Weiss."
"The body is very light with an effervescent level of carbonation. It truly is impressive the amount of flavors a skilled brewer can pack into such a small beer. I challenge anyone who thinks a beer with less than 5% ABV can't be packed with flavor to try this beer. It's just so delicious, easy drinking and just an overall pleasant experience. And the best part is, I can have 3 or 4 or 5 and hardly feel a buzz! :)"
"O- this brew is tits. One of my favorites of the style to date. Ill be having a few of these. Philly is the best beer town."
"This is a light bodied brew that is a little thicker in the feel for the typical berliner weisse (pushing medium bodied possibly due to the extra yeast in suspension making it feel creamier.) It has an excessively aggressive amount of carbonation that is a touch too much even for this style which is expected to be lively. It is tart enough that it creates the minor puckering quality that yogurt has as it seeming strips the moisture out of your mouth. It finishes crisp and refreshing, this style is the epitome of summertime refreshment and this offering/take on the style is awesome. Drinkable as all hell, I actually had to open a second bottle just to finish the review because I had the first glass gone before I even wrote anything about the taste. This lambicus example offers a unique opportunity to experience the different types of brettanomyces. Instead of the typical funked, horsey barnyard notes, this type of brett offers up more of a unique sourness with light fruit notes that provide an awesome addition to this style of brew. Well done, it was my intension to drink and share a couple of these before setting some in the cellar to try and forget about to see how the brett further developes...that obviously isn't going to happen now. I like this beer too much and it's not going to last long. I need to get some more of these."
"Very drinkable. I could have this all night. A delicious refreshing beer. I think this would be amazing after a hot day mowing the lawn even."
"Overall I was hoping for more from this beer after enjoying the non-brett version however the brett didn't meld as much as I'd hoped. An interesting beer but one I wouldn't seek out again."
"If only this stuff was mass bottled and sold for a cheap price, it would utterly destroy bud light."
"Overall, a good berliner weisse, but Southampton still is the gold standard for me. Just not enough lactic sourness for me. Also was missing some distinctive flavors of apples, lemons, etc. that I so much enjoyed in SH's version. Regardless, definitely worth a try if you are a berliner fan."
"d: pretty good, but wish it was more funky tasting and more sour."
"Cheers!"
"D - Ahhh. Very good."
"D: An interesting brew, and very drinkable"
"D- I'm starting to believe Berliner-Weisse might be the most drinkable style out there. Well worth the 5.99 price for a 12 oz bottle."
"d - an excellent example of the style. the funk of the Brettanomyces is enough to highlight the nice lactic tang of the beer without getting in the way."
"D - The aroma is really quite over the top with a funk character that borders on foul. Fortunately the flavor is much more pleasant and surprisingly restrianed. The acidity is much milder than I expected based on the aroma and despite is champagne like character is maintains a certain creamy malt quality that lingers on the palate after the beer is gone. Very drinkable and quite an interesting take on the historical possibilities of this beer."
