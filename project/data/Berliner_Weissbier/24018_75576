3.62,-0.3,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Big thanks goes out to funkydelic for sharing this one at a past Random Sunday Tasting! Served from bottle into a Mikkeller taster flute. Poured golden yellow with a one finger white head that subsided to a minimal amount slowly. Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, lemon, citrus, tart, sour, and lemon rine. The flavor was of sweet malt, earth, citrus, earth hop, spice, bell pepper, and funk. It had a light feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this was a pretty decent brew. Upon taking in the aroma I was thinking that I was in for something special, however the flavor was a little bit lacking as compared to the aroma. While it was still good, it just didn’t have quite the amount of complexity and acidity that I got in the aroma. The flavor was a good bit more earthy. Glad I got the opportunity to finally try this one and wouldn’t mind doing so again in the future to see how it develops over time.","thagr81us","Jan 14, 2013"
1.58,-56.5,1.5,1,2,1.5,1.5,"Very light and thin with a weak head that dissipates to nothing in seconds. Almost no smell with just a whiff of "maybe something has turned in the fridge." Even the flavor of rare can't help this one. Water with a touch of plain yogurt and powdered vitamin C.","TheRealDBCooper","Jan 08, 2013"

The residual sweetness is a bit much and it overall is lacking the tartness and crisp snap to the finish that I look for in the style. As a summertime beer, it is fitting and something I could throw back pretty effortlessly but considering the trouble getting it and the price tag, there are others out there I would opt for instead of this one.","stakem","Oct 13, 2012"
