The brett and the yeast are definitely more present in the nose than in the flavor and mouthfeel.  This is a nice sour-but its pretty simple rather than complex.  I'm definately looking for more wheat characteristics in a berliner too.","PittBeerGirl","Sep 27, 2014"

Taste is funky and very tart, apple, lemon and other fruits as well, some brett mustiness, acidic and sour with a suprisingly bready malt aftertaste. High carbonation, dry and lightly syrupy.

As a side note, before the last quarter of the glass, I added a small amount of the green syrup to compare. The sweetness completely hid the sour and tart aspects of the beer, which to me ruined the appeal of the brew. I would not add the syrup again, but it was an interesting service. Per the bartender, it is served that way in Germany to make the sour beer more appealing to children.","macrosmatic","Beers"

This stuff pours a clear pale straw topped by a finger of white foam. The nose comprises lemon rind, wheat, light brett, and grass. The taste brings in more of the same, along with a light but distinct cut of tart lemon. The body is a hefty light, with a light moderate carbonation and a dry, sticky finish.

Nose is super lactic, lemon, weird funk notes (maybe some urine?) and wheat. Taste has a shredding lactic sourness, wheat and paler malt character, mild lemon. A really ripping tartness within the style (not on the level of some lambics however) that takes a bit of time to acclimatize to. Some green apple skins as well. Light, watery body and a puckering lingering drying mouthfeel. A solid berliner, refreshing if often overpowering. Would love to try this with some syrups.","liamt07","May 08, 2012"

Bright citrus floral smell - all yeast and bacteria aroma. First sip is awesome,O obviously lactic acid that coats the mouth and doesn't linger too long. Aftertaste is distinct cherry pie Brettanomyces Lambicus flavor. Tartness is just a bit more that normal for a berliner-weizen. Lactobacillus doesn't get lost though. Wheat body is depleted in fermentation, thin and dry as expected. But the wheat flavor isn't lost. This beer holds up amazingly for a 3%er.

Underneath the dry, funky bret there are hints of earthy grass and straw as well as some spicy clove, banana and lemon juice. It's pretty tart but not as unpleasantly funky as the aroma suggests. Decently balanced and once you get over the initial palate shock it's pretty refreshing and quaffable.","corby112","May 13, 2011"

It took about three minutes to diminish to a root beer float like poof. It essentially looks like pale pear juice. It has the nice, dry, crisp sour notes with granny smith apple like aromas mixed with some strange funk. The funk is just strange. It's as if the brett hasn't found its place. The flavors aren't as numerous as the aromas. The flavor is pretty light and instantly a watery tart apple. It kind of "refoams" in your mouth and goes down like you're drinking foam. It's just a little strange. This beer was ok but I didn't like it as much as the Porticus. The brett took away from what I really appreciate in a Berliner Weiss.","aasher","Mar 18, 2011"

4.52,7.4,4,4.5,4.5,4,5,"This is a light bodied brew that is a little thicker in the feel for the typical berliner weisse (pushing medium bodied possibly due to the extra yeast in suspension making it feel creamier.) It has an excessively aggressive amount of carbonation that is a touch too much even for this style which is expected to be lively. It is tart enough that it creates the minor puckering quality that yogurt has as it seeming strips the moisture out of your mouth. It finishes crisp and refreshing, this style is the epitome of summertime refreshment and this offering/take on the style is awesome. Drinkable as all hell, I actually had to open a second bottle just to finish the review because I had the first glass gone before I even wrote anything about the taste. This lambicus example offers a unique opportunity to experience the different types of brettanomyces. Instead of the typical funked, horsey barnyard notes, this type of brett offers up more of a unique sourness with light fruit notes that provide an awesome addition to this style of brew. Well done, it was my intension to drink and share a couple of these before setting some in the cellar to try and forget about to see how the brett further developes...that obviously isn't going to happen now. I like this beer too much and it's not going to last long. I need to get some more of these.","stakem","Mar 04, 2011"
