4.39,25.1,4.25,4,4.5,4.75,4.5,"Very pale yellow, nearly clear. Smells light, slight sour and wheat. Effervescent wheat flavor and a little green apple tartness. Sessionable too, we have a winner!","CraigP83","Mar 11, 2015"
4.25,21.1,4.25,4.25,4.25,4.25,4.25,"I'd place this somewhere between an American pale wheat ale and a true Berliner weisse. Bell's gets major props for packaging this in six packs; not many other breweries that distribute to my area do so. This goes down easy for those hot summer days (of which we have a lot in Southern California) and it is extremely thirst quenching. Wheat, slight tart lemon flavor, and a light body with lots of carbonation and a dry slightly tart finish keeps you coming back for more. If you're expecting tons of flavors, look elsewhere. Actually, don't, you should still try this and maybe open your palate up to the subtle finesse of a nicely executed beer that won't destroy you in 100 degree heat and pairs excellently with any food.","crob3888","Mar 08, 2015"

Slightly tart, easy to drink and very balanced and flavorful.  Could have this beer anytime, anywhere, any reason.   If there is anything to knock it, its only because of fizziness in the body and the finish is a touch on the dry side and not as smooth and cleansing as some other ones from same style of beer.  Otherwise, its delicious.  Enjoy!","bubseymour","Dec 06, 2014"

3.7,5.4,,,,,,"The beer pours white and small bubbles as part of the head but dissipates quickly. The beer itself is hazy and a pale straw color. the Beer has a tart smell mixed with a banana yeast notes and orange hop notes. However, the smell appears to be a little weak. The taste has a strong sour/tart note with banana notes from the yeast. The orange hop flavor is still present but each of the notes taste a bit watery. The beer's mouthfeel is slightly watery and light bodied with smooth and light carbonation. Overall, a decent beer but falls to the trap that the style needs something else and stronger to make it good.","HattedClassic","Aug 30, 2014"

4,14,3.25,3.75,4.25,4,4,"O. This is a very solid Berliner and, I suspect, very close to the traditional style. There's only hints of tartness as opposed to outright sour acidity. Bouquet and flavor are very similar to a German Pilsner, but the lacto tartness and the wheat lend a creaminess more appropriate of the Berliner style. The reviews on this are understandably muted: this is so easy drinking, so straight forward, and so well-integrated that it almost comes off boring. But it's anything but. This is a wonderful piece of first class craft and an absolute treat for the warmer months. In a world of over the top sours, Oarsman aims for classic simplicity and makes its mark.

The flavor is better than the nose, but it's mostly lemon- like the sour part of lemon, not necessarily the citrus flavor.

3.58,2,4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"12 ounce bottle into signature pint glass, bottled on 4/2/2013. Pours lightly hazy golden straw color with a 1 finger fairly dense white head with decent retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Slight spotty lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of tart apple, lemon, grape, pear, wheat, hay, grass, pepper, funk, light vinegar, and yeast earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance and complexity of yeast and light malt notes; with decent strength. Taste of tart apple, lemon, grape, pear, hay, grass, wheat, funk, light pepper, light vinegar, and yeast earthiness. Light fruity/earthy tartness on the finish; with lingering notes of light fruits, hay, grass, wheat, light pepper, light funk, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a short bit. Nice and pleasant balance and complexity of flavors; with a very dry finish and no cloying flavors as expected. Medium carbonation and light bodied; with a very dry and crisp mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is well hidden with zero warming present as expected of 4%. Overall this is a very solid Berliner weisse style. Nice balance and complexity of flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. An enjoyable offering.","superspak","Sep 06, 2013"

It's very carbonated, however this fizzyness dies down almost completely shortly after the initial pour. There's no lacing whatsoever. The aroma is extremely complex and curious, with sweet kiwi, lemon, sour apple, yeast and biscuity grain. The taste makes the drinker recall baked goods with a fairly straightforward and crisp tart fruit flavor being the most prevalent. Very light feel and refreshing overall. I had this with a spicy dish, and it paired very well. Great entry to the Bell's lineup!","Neorebel","Jun 20, 2013"

Citrus notes, wetness, then light bitter sour notes effervesce. Goes well with salt. Afternotes linger, lactic isn't too biley, clean flavors. Would like to have a more bitter hop bite on this to elevate. Carbonation is finer, moving to lambic, but fatter at the end. Somewhat champagne-like in mouth feel.

The aroma introduced a serious sourness and tartness, while the flavoring, via crisp grain and citric inclusions, smashed, smoothed, and blended things into a concise, easy final product. No one component ever became overwhelming, and the wheat stayed right where it needed to be to ensure the strength of the base. If we are being picky, the flavoring does ease up a bit too much at the end of the sip and, at times, can feel watered through. This, however, doesn’t change the fact that this is one clean, refreshing, and sessionable beer.","TheBrewo","Apr 03, 2013"

3.79,8,4,3.75,3.75,4,3.75,"The beer pours a spritzy golden orange with a small, egg shell white head of tight bubbles that quickly fizzles into a rim on the glass. The beer’s body is misty but clear of particles, and chock full of a torrential river of carbonation bubbles that are constantly racing up the glass. For lacing, the beer leaves small slippery strings that do not stay on the glass long. On the nose, the beer smells deeply of cereal wheat, almost like a meaty wheat flake. There is the faintest hint of tartness in the beginning of the nose, but that is quickly eaten up by the thick bready caramel wheat smell that makes me think this beer is heavier than it is. On the tongue, the beer tastes lightly acidic with a nice sweet wheat malt roundness to the taste. In flavor, the beer begins as tart, almost citric acid that washes quickly over the tongue and is replaced by light chewy lemon wheat bread (without the acid) and a touch of citric orange. The finish is of light lemon and orange water, mixed in with a touch of sweet wheat malts. As the beer warms, a wheat flake flavor does enter the beer throughout the taste. The aftertaste is light and tingly, similar to how the mouth feels after a light tea, or flavored water. In the mouth, the beer feels a step above light in body, with a strong prickly carbonation that never grows out of control and helps to punctuate the flavor notes on the palate. The mouth is left fairly clean, with only the faintest feeling of carbonation burn and a touch of sticky malt candy covering the mouth. Overall this beer is nice, and could definitely be a great all day beer. Its light spritziness makes it refreshing and interesting, but I kind of wish there was more tartness to this beer. It’s simple and nice, but it doesn’t blow me away, and it really just leaves me desiring a fuller flavor. A great session beer for sure, if you want something light, but you can find more flavorful beers for the ABV level.","Maxwell","Mar 26, 2013"

The taste and mouthfeel was very clean, like a standard lager but with good body and obvious wheat sweetness to it.

Anyhow, I tried to judge fairly based on the fact that I am not a fan of sour beers. The initial pour did not look like a ""high end"" beer to me. The heavy carbonation and yellow color reminded me of a cheaper light beer. The lack of foam and lacing added to this. However, actually tasting the beer turned it around for me. The tartness and carbonation played well with each other and created a beer that is reminiscent of something like white wine. The aftertaste and smell of vinegar are sort of a turn off for me. I imagine that for people that enjoy sours this is a pretty decent one. However, it is not for me.","RuEXP1","Mar 02, 2013"

I put the syrup in the glass and pour the beer over it, and the result is a very nice foamy head. This is the way to drink the beer.","ribby","Oct 26, 2012"

Grass and flora, light sour citrus notes, and a very light accent of funk on the nose. Green tea, fresh grassiness, slight tart light lemon and bready yeast midpalate that finishes dry slightly tart and refreshing. Light body, mild carbonation. The concept behind this beer seems to be a less intense Berliner weiss-style beer. Bell's is successful in accomplishing that. Oarsman Ale is a good introduction beer, however it may seem to be a bit lacking to those fairly familiar with the style and other sour styles.","chanokokoro","Oct 02, 2012"

Medium in body, this brew had a classic malted wheat base, and the tart flavor of lactic acid due to the sour mash process that was used to brew this beer.

There is visible carbonation on the glass. Aroma is mildly lemony with some mild tartness and a bit of maybe smooth wheat and very mild funk. There is lots of lemon and maybe peach with some nice tartness and a bit more musty dirtyness than the aroma. Mouthfeel is great. Light, high carbonation, refreshing, and dry. I had this on tap a while ago and was not as impressed with it. I think it was the lower carbonation. The aggressive effervescent carbonation really helps a lot of the other aspects of the tartness and fruit shine.","Agold","Mar 01, 2012"
4.18,19.1,4,3.5,4.5,4,4.5,"For whatever reason, this is the first time I've ever seen Oarsman here in Florida. It's a nice cloudy yellow-white color with a large white head that quickly drops. The aroma is nice, it's got sour wheat aromas along with some overripe fruit and lemons. The taste is very, very nice. It's got strong lemon flavors at first, backed up by a slightly tart wheat. The tartness lets up a bit at the end, letting the wheat and a bit of fruit fade into the sunset. It's really quite the beautiful beer. The mouthfeel is refreshing and slightly drying, and the drinkability is great. I can't help but think we were getting the short end of the stick here in Florida for a while. You see, we got Oberon year-round, but didn't get Oarsman at all. And it's a damn shame we're only getting this fantastic beer now.","shand","Mar 01, 2012"

A crisp mouthful opens up into a nice moderate malt sweetness provided by the wheat and lighter malts. A very mild but pleasant tart note envelops the flavor near the finish, but then fades quick. A very ""clean"" and crisp, and subtly tart take on a berliner weisse. I bet this would be great in the warm weather. Overall, if you're a fan of the style it's an interesting take.

Perhaps better to say it reminds me of green apple Jolly Ranchers, only from real fruit and not artificial? The tartness gives this beer a crisp, clean taste and finish.

Aroma is yeast, malt, wet grain, white sparkling wine. Flavor is similar to nose with a little tartness up front, plenty of carbonic tang, an ever so faint fruit sweetness and yeast bitterness. Body is good and is dominated by the acid. Finish is clean and like flavor; strangely, there seems to be a little alcohol warmth. Maybe that's an illusion due to the tartness.

The nose is juicy and sweet, wheaty and tart. The flavor is a very interesting mix of horse blanket, barnyard funk, sweet fruitiness, wheaty-ness, and a sour-tart finish. Mouthfeel is light in body and carbonation; slick on the palate. Overall, not a bad beer, probably a pretty good representation of the style.","gmfessen","Nov 18, 2011"

The aroma is a bit dull but clean, with a musty combination of mild wheat and yeast characteristics. The flavor is much more enticing, though, with a crisp, refreshing lemon-orange citrus tartness that combines well with a mellow wheatiness. The very-fine, active carbonation complements the flavors to energize the tartness and make the beer even more refreshing.

It is light, simple, refreshing and low alcohol, but that little snap of acid makes it soooo good. The other American Wheat beers that I do like are really a new style of wheat beers, more like wheat based Pale Ales. Oarsmen is like a more interesting Easy Street or Bully Wheat. Or maybe its the American version of Berliner Weiss. But unlike the virtually extinct Berliner Weiss, Oarsman is actually available to consumers. My only complaint is that a $9.49 6pk is hard to think of like a session beer.","BradLikesBrew","Apr 13, 2011"

Tart, mildly lactic with a raw, wheaty aroma with some mild rotting fruit present, this is pretty enjoyable. Very doughy, this is quite enjoyable. The palate opens with a blend of lactic and lemony tartness, both light, both refreshing. A little doughy on the mid-palate, there's some wheat that appears. The finish is disappointing, though. Watery and surprisingly bland, the acids disappear leaving no real sign of their presence, and the high carbonation does further scrub them right off. The watery finish also really shows off how light this beer is in body. Adding the yeast does alleviate this problem, but it introduces another - it muddles up the acidity and tartness. All told, a solid APWA, but not the best Berliner Weiss. Very drinkable, especially for the price.","DefenCorps","0"

Essentially, this an American spin on a Berliner Weiss, with nice lactic notes and a clean, crisp, sparkling sourness. It's not as tart as the best of the Berliners, and its more sparkly and lighter. There is also a very slight sweet breadiness in the finish, which doesn't come through at all in the mouthfeel, but does in the taste. The only other sourmash wheat I've had is the one from Moonlight, and this one is much less grainy and cleaner tasting. I suppose Telegraph wheat bears a passing resemblance as well. I think this is bound to be a misunderstood beer, and I'm not surprised to see scores all over the place. Personally, I ""get"" this beer and enjoy it.

Lemongrass, wheat, sage, pepper, pretzel dough, mandarin orange zest, green apple and apricot to peach pit fruit scents, light yeasty funk. Light-bodied plus, the carbonation has enough toughness and tight weave to keep what weight is there present through to the end. Very citrusy, tart lemon, orange burst. Yeast, sourdough, the wheat tastes grainy and unprocessed. Close to no fruit, some sour apple, pear and apricot. In the back half, though, there's a glancing brush of honey and caramel.

3.59,2.3,3.5,2,4,4,4.5,"In every regard this beer vaguely resembles a berliner weiss, but the end result is a mellow pale wheat ale with sharp amount of carbonation and mild tart zing. Appearance is relatively clear, and pale grassy lemon yellow colored with a fizzy white head that maintains a consistent thick ring of bubbles and film with no lacing. Aroma is very mild and unremarkable, blend of wheat, grass and are those peanuts?? (wtf). Doesn't really smell much like any berliner or pale wheat. Ignoring the flavor, the body is very crisp, tart and refreshing with extremely sharp carbonation. The flavor is exceptionally wheaty, lemony and grassy with a lingering mild tartness. I ended up really enjoying this even though I was disappointed it wasn't a more traditional berliner. As others have mentioned its like a bizarre Oberon Lite mixed with...something.","yourefragile","Aug 20, 2010"

The aroma was comprised of fruit, and malt with a skunk aroma upon warming up. The flavor was of subtle fruit and malt. It was light on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a nice brew to enjoy outside on a hot summer day. It was refreshing and had very subtle flavors. However in my humble opinion I think the aroma and flavor was lacking a little complexity for me. Still nice and glad I got to try it, but probably won't have it again.","thagr81us","Aug 02, 2010"

It's neat--it really is, kind of like a whole new wave of easy drinking sessions--but it's not neat enough to make a fuss over.","mynie","0"

The syrups are excellent if you don't mind a flavorable sweet fruit taste. Himbeere is raspberry and awesome. The Waldmeister is woodruff and tastes like marshmallows, Lucky Charms to be more specific(Thanks Joseph). This was definitely a worthwhile growler and experience! I could drink one of these a day(with the flavoring). Nice and mild, great dessert or break between different styles of beers to clean the palette.","cdizinno","Jun 06, 2010"

The flavor was not as sour as the other examples of this style that I have had, but it definitely has some pucker power. Wheaty, lemony, grassy and slightly astringent. Not a whole lot of depth here, but the flavors seem well proportioned and are enjoyable. The body is on the lighter side of medium, and had a clean light finish that made it very refreshing. Pretty drinkable, but overall I was a bit disappointed. Still a nice beer and a decent take on a hard to find style.","zoso1967","May 06, 2010"

Very citrusy and bitter smelling. Taste is mouth puckering with the finish of a wheat beer, quite complex. Like sucking on a lemon and then eating a scoop of cereal. Rushes on the tongue and delivers a citrus punch that puckers the tongue and opens the nasal cavity. Great wheat finish to slow things down. Great beer but considering its my first step into sours, I don't understand the drinkability yet. Very crisp and refreshing though.","kiddynamite920","Jan 01, 2010"

Really not a lot going on in the aroma, but a light sourness can be detected. Taste is sharp, crisp, and lightly tart, flavors of citrus, light acidity, and mild sugary sweetness.
