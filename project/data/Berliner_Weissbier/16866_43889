Aroma is wheat, lactic acid sourness, green apple & lemon/lime with a hint of Brett mustiness. Taste is very lactic, thin wheat malt, some citrusy & green apple fruitiness, a little Brett & brine. Fruitiness & brine most prominent in the finish. Afrertaste is tart & salty. I'm not sure that this is brewed with salt as is the case with Gose but it certainly has a saline twang.  Mouthfeel is light-medium bodied with medium carbonation, prickly, crisp, dry & puckering. If you liked Sweet Tarts candy as a child then you will most likely give this a solid 4-5.","mothmanscott","Feb 20, 2015"

4,-1,4,4,4,4,4,"D:  It's a cool, fall October day, so perhaps this style is out of season. My plans consist of watching a 2 hour Freddie Mercury documentary with my pregnant wife, so a 750mL bottle at only 3% is the perfect match.  Enough beer to last the movie, and no unwanted buzz. To sweeten it up a bit I am adding 1oz per pour of framboise liqueur.  The beer is a nice representation of the style, but the extra sweetness (as suggested by the bottle) really elevates the beer to another level.  This could be a go to for the style, especially at $10 a bottle.","antott0523","Oct 17, 2014"

It certainly leans towards the ""sour"" side of the style, with emphasis taken away from the biscuity, wheat qualities traditionally found in these beers. Wheat notes are there, but the early mid through the finish is one big puckery kiss of lemon, strawberry, and even some tart cherry. Fairly complex flavor profile for the style. Still, some traditionalists won't enjoy the acidity in play here. Nevertheless, I dig this beer quite a bit. Packing an inordinate amount of flavor, pucker, and complexity into a tight little sub-4% ABV package, The Bruery's Hottenroth is a welcome addition to my summer lineup.","siege06nd","Beers"

4.22,4.5,4,4.5,4,4,4.5,"750 ml bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 6/4/2013. Pours moderately hazy pale straw color with a 1-2 finger fairly dense white head with poor retention, that reduces to nothing. Minimal lacing and moderate streaming carbonation. Aromas of big sour green apple, lemon, pear, grape, wheat, hay, straw, vinegar, clove, herbal, white wine, musty funk, and yeast earthiness. Fantastic aromas with great complexity and balance of fruity/funky yeast notes with slight malt presence; with great strength. Taste of big sour apple, lemon, pear, grape, hay, straw, wheat, vinegar, clove, musty funk, white wine, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Good amount of fruity/earthy tartness on the finish; with lingering notes of sour apple, lemon, pear, grape, vinegar, hay, straw, wheat, musty funk, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice balance, complexity, and moderate robustness of fruity/funky and tart yeast flavors with light malt presence; with a nice crisp balance of acidity and no cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and light bodied; with a smooth, crisp, and moderately acidic mouthfeel that is very nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish as expected of 3.1%. Overall this is a highly excellent Berliner weisse! All around great complexity, balance, and robustness of fruity/tart/funky yeast flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A highly enjoyable offering.","superspak","Dec 20, 2013"

You can smell the sour. Taste is very light, like drinking tonic water with lemon zest, some grassy notes, and wheat. Decently sour, but not puckeringly so. Feel is great! This is light, refreshing, easy to dink with high carbonation that enhances the sour taste. Great beer, super easy to drink. Good pizza beer.","Samuel906","Nov 22, 2013"

The 3.1% abv also makes it easy to polish off a full 750 without getting sloppy, so that's nice. I will definitely have to seek out additional bottles of this wonderful sour beer from The Bruery.

Poured a hazy straw slightly golden yellow with a half finger pure white head that subsided to a minimal amount slowly. Maintained nice lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, wheat, fresh cut grass, and a nice hint of sour apple. The flavor was of sweet malt, wheat, subtle funk, and a nice tart characteristic. It had a light feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this was a pretty good brew. I am personally a big fan of this style so I am quite picky when I try them. However, this one was pretty solid as far as Berliners go. All of the right components are here for a solid brew, but I just wish they were a little more intense than they were. This did make it easier for the novice to the style to drink, but as someone who appreciates the style it was a little on the weak side. Still a very solid brew that I wish I would have gotten MANY more of.","thagr81us","Mar 03, 2012"

This one pours a clear pale straw topped by a short-lived couple o' fingers o' fizzy white foam. The nose comprises tart lemon zest, sour yeast (yeah, it's bacteria, but for some reason saying ""sour bacteria"" doesn't sound right in my head), and light wet wheat. The taste brings in more of the same, with the tartness really blooming right up front. This is short-lived, though, as things die away completely just after the midway point, leaving a very dry and empty tongue. The body is fairly light, with a moderate carbonation and a decidedly dry finish. Overall, a nice B-Weiss, but one that ultimately leaves me wanting in some vague sense. I can't explain it.

Nice citrus aromas with bright, tart fruit notes. Taste is initially like a very light wheat beer that lacks in all the clove and coriander flavors (which is a good thing) and is replaced by tart lemon and citrus notes. Pleasant yeast flavors make the tart flavors more mellow than they want to be. Finishes with lovely lemon and wheat flavors. Mouthfeel is EXTREMELY light and airy...perfect for this style in beer. Drinkability is EXTREMELY high. Overall, this is an outstanding beer that represents this style to a tee.

Tart enough for the style; but certainly not mouth-puckering sour. Very light in body with a dry finish which normally would make a beer very quaffable, but the sour character actually had me sipping this beer.

4,-1,4,4,4,4,4,"O: A nice brew, very refreshing. It comes off a bit mellow on the palate, but maybe that's why the style invites the addition of syrups. I was more than happy to enjoy it plain, and I got a real sense of the subtly lager/champagne fusion. Enjoyment of this brew is highly contextual. For me in a warm climate I can see this being a very enticing alternative to a great many Ales. I'd grab a bottle or two for a non-beer-drinker get together, and enjoy my craft beer without sticking out like a sore thumb. Points for refreshing, points for craft, but I'm not sure how true this is to the style. I'm very curious to try more in style now. Good beer for what it is, but if you aren't in a warm climate, this might come off a bit strange.","Cavery","Jul 03, 2011"

The low FG dry... This dryness working as the backbone of the palate and the thicker wheat core with a sour twist. This is the first. Quite filtered lack of carbonation. Easy drinking. Weak protein formation. Nose of lemon grass and yogart. Zesty. Palate is lacto... Also salty. The perfect bbq beer. When without fruit syrup i can see it cutting sweetness wonderfully. Palate of yogart hints and minimal wheat. Intense tart dryness but not offensive. A quick finish. A bit of lemon pulp and teeth grinding. A novelity of sort but sours are in so it works. In the end a tad heavy for the aby but good to see people are making a style i like. Can't wait to have mine.","rtepiak","Beers"

3.98,-1.5,4.5,4,4,3.5,4,"Bruery Hottenroth is probably the palest beer I've ever had--probably 1 SRM, if that. It's lighter in color than lemonade, and the first pour is almost crystal clear, whereas the second is hazier. The beer foams up with a thick white head that quickly fizzes out. The beer smells a little funky sour, not entirely like an American wild, but like spoiled milk and a little lemony. It also smells a bit doughy. The beer is tart upfront with good round mouthfeel and light carbonation. The finish is very dry and sour. This is not a very complex beer, pretty bland sour with a little lemony bite and a clean aftertaste.","Soonami","Jun 09, 2011"
4.35,7.7,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"One of the better versions of this somewhat elusive style. For me, most are simply not tart or lactic enough. This one hits the nail on the head. Pours a hazy pale straw color, with an almost greenish cast. Finely beaded pure white head. Smells soft and slightly grainy, with an almost barnyard note as well. Some lactic tartness, particularly at the end. The taste is much more lactic and tart than the aroma would suggest. Nice lemony sourness, almost cutting at first, and then turning more into a lemon peel bitterness with some lemon juiciness hanging in there. A touch of lactic tanginess, not quite creamy, makes a brief appearance. Really nice beer.","Georgiabeer","Jun 08, 2011"

The taste is spot on champagne, dry, nice acidity, chalky with a slight sourness and almost a french ""terrior"" of minerals and earth.

It looks like pear juice or watered down apple juice and is very light in color. The only thing I can really smell is the sourness and tartness of a good Berliner Weiss. The taste is excellent. It reminds me of a sour, light apple or pear cider. The mouthfeel is very light and very, very crisp due to good carbonation. I find this to be insanely drinkable, probably because it's only 3.1%.

The smell is clean with a touch of wheat/grain, yet you still get that touch of lacto vinegar and citrus. The flavor is well rounded and features citric acid and light grains. It is the perfect level of sour, and the carbonation is spot on. I love this beer and could drink it all day. The only part that isn't perfect is the head, which didn't seem to last long.

The syrup seems to boost the acidity in the flavor while also adding a bit to the body of the beer. I only added a little bit of the syrup so that it wouldn't sweeten the beer too much and it does nothing to mask the nutty wild yeast character.

I know nothing of the style, and therefore don't know if that wet moldy hay/stale wheat character is supposed to be there, or an off taste developed somewhere along the line. I wish it was more tart and sour than it is. I'll have to have this agian, and others in the style, to find out if this is a good representation of the style, or if The Bruery put their own twist on it that I just don't care for.","Mistofminn","Oct 21, 2009"
3.83,-5.2,4.5,4,3.5,4,4,"Moderate and lively carbonation making it very refreshing and thirst quenching. Light on the tongue and a nice tart dryness in the end. Nice summer drink, glad this style is brewed somewhat locally and available in bottles.","seaoflament","Oct 21, 2009"
4,-1,4,4,4,4,4,"Great to see this beer make it all the way to Masachusetts. I bought this bottle at Winchester Wine and Spirits. Poured in to a white wine glass, it actually looks a lot like white wine. It is a hazy golden straw color, and does not foam up all that much. Smell is very similar to a Sauv Blanc or perhaps a Riesling in that it is tart and has some grape character to it. Very tart to start, with a nice backing dash of carbonation. Very light in body, I would recommend serving this one cold, as it is simply not as refreshing when warm. The low alcohol level makes this one you could drink quite a few of, however, some may be put off by the sour nature of it. This is a great Berliner that competes with the German examples in many ways. I might save a bit of my bottle to see how it does with some of the syrup added. Cheers","jamie2dope","Beers"

The smell was very interesting. Unconventional but interesting. Plenty of toasted wheat and some odd spices. Yeasty but not overly estery. Some tartness, but again, odd. The taste was full of the toasted wheat but with some unidentifiable off flavors, or what I feel were off. This was washed away but a lemon water or watered down lemonade type flavor. Some tart fruits before the lemon water but very light in both fruit and tartness. The mouthfeel was very watery and the carbonation couldn't help it. The low ABV would help the drinkability but the off flavors and watered down mouthfeel doesn't make me want to drink this.","pwoods","Oct 06, 2009"

4.46,10.4,3,4.5,4.5,4,5,"Pours a pale yellow, straw yellow, couldn't be yellower, more yellow than mellow yellow. Very pale, almost colorless, a bit hazy though, but fairly clear, with a nice white head that forms on top. The head dies quickly to nothing, and leaves no lacing from the start. Not bad, but I guess that it actually looks quite average. The smell is nice, though all descriptors I could use would sound kind of disgusting. The first thing you get is burnt garbage, like stale bread, old vegetables, rotting starches (trust me on this, I have roommates that keep potatoes until they rot), with just a bit of tartness underneath it all. This is just right I would say - about the only time that hot garbage could be a good smell. The taste is right on too. Nice and tart, with a good back of pale graininess. Not much sweetness, it doesn't need much, just enough to balance the tartness a bit. So light and refreshing, but so interesting with the sour tastes. This yeast profile is actually a bit familiar to me, it reminds me of wild yeast that I caught in my own house - not overpoweringly sour and tart, no taste a vinegar, just a nice pleasant, slightly chalky tartness. A bit of the garbage comes in with the finish as you swallow the smell down. I'm a fan. The body is thin, of course, what else would you expect at this ABV, which I would say is right on for the style. The tartness fixes it back up. Pretty good, for 3.1. The drinkabiliy is just great. Perfect for a session beer. Light, refreshing, low in ABV, and the taste is just challenging and enjoyable enough that I could drink this a lot. When everyone asks ""What beer would you choose if it could only be one for the rest of your life?"" (assuming that it wasn't going to be your last by far, I suppose) I could probably be happy with this. So very simple and nice.","taylorhamrick","Sep 20, 2009"

Very easy drinking, if you are into sour/wild ales, this will fit the bill nicely. Probably too tart for people not accustomed to sours.

4.29,6.2,3.5,4.5,4.5,4,4,"This tart beer was a cloudy pale lemon yellow color with a good 1 to 1 1/2 inch cotton white head of foam. This head of foam had good retention that left behind a tiny skim of white foam and just a few small white blots of lace. As soon as I twisted off the cap, out comes a super strong aroma of sour and tart lemons. With the strong scent of lemons is that unique farmyard scent that can only come from Brett yeast. Rounding off this potent aroma was a subtle whiff of malted wheat. Sometimes this malted wheat smelled like soggy cereal and sometimes it didn't. I wish I could explain it. Even with the strong taste of tart lemons, this was still a light bodied beer. If you couldn't tell already, this beer has a long lasting lingering aftertaste of tart lemons and that down of the farm taste that comes with the Brett yeast. This is truly a unique and tasty beer. I never thought a Berliner Weisse could be this damn sour, but Bruery did it. And what it was! If you can find this beer on tap at your local bar, consider yourself lucky.

And this is a little known fact, but because of that, it was actually quite common in the U.S. at one point. I digress, you are kind of at the mercy of the 'unknown' in its production, but you do have some control, and you do have taste buds... it's also an easy beer to blend if something goes astray! I've never had another beer from The Bruery so I can't judge it against anything else they've done. Hopefully what I had was just a bad batch.
