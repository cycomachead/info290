I was hoping for a bit more peach flavor but you do taste subtle fruitiness upfront. Very well carbonated but the mouthfeel is lacking.

The mouthfeel was pretty light, but in a very nice way, as it combined with the carbonation to really set the flavors off.

The aroma resembled more of a hard cider rather than an ale. There were a few flavors that managed to surface through the overpowering sourness. There was not as much peach flavor as expected but there was a very acidic apple flavor.  There were flavors resembling that of a sparkling white wine. Overall, I was not too pleased with this beer but it will please palates fond of sour flavors and hard ciders.","Marisol820","Sep 07, 2014"

Listed as Weisseer I figured there would be a hint of dry or citrus but all I got was a medium body rather bland beer with a syrupy overlay on the tongue More contrived than complex. Neither refreshing nor bright. I'll stick to the North Carolina guys for this style next time.","seedyone","Aug 28, 2014"

4.94,35.3,4,5,5,5,5,"Probably the ""ne plus ultra"" of fruit beers. A category I usually dislike on account of the oft sickly sweetness, Sam Caligione gets it right, letting the yeast eat up all the residual sugars and leaving behind just the flavor, not the sweet. Tart like a lambic, but without the Brett funk. I can see why some beer drinkers might balk - its not really ""beery"" and reads more like a dry Cava on the palate. Crazy good with seafood, especially shellfish. Great with a plate of raw oysters and a lobster roll. Used a bottle to steam some mussels and clams - awesome. A knockout, if not the most beery of beers.","sanhedrin","Aug 03, 2014"

Aroma is sour apples with wild yeast dominant. The tart yeast profile is predominant in the flavor with very little fruit noticeable until the sip is gone. Really mellow peach aftertaste combined with the residual sweetnees gives this more of a tangerine and clementine flavor than peach. Very drinkable but I'd like to have a version of this where the fruit shines more and isn't so muted by the yeast. I'm a huge fan of wild yeast in beers but I expected more fruit intensity even for a Berliner Weisse","beerjunky413","Jul 29, 2014"

It's also not quite as tart as the more modern examples of the style. What it is, though, is well-made, closer to the classic style than most examples these days. While I definitely would have enjoyed a bit more graininess, this beer is refreshing and delicious. There aren't enough Berliners today, in my opinion. Festina Peche demonstrates why brewers should visit this style more often. Outstanding brew here.","siege06nd","Jul 26, 2014"

A little light looking but a mixed bag, has some haziness, at least initially and pretty fluffy head that did not stick to the glass. Not much to the nose, although I was working outside so maybe allergy limited. Outstanding flavor, got that nice sour touch, but not overwhelming, very clean and smooth. Absolutely perfect after some work in the yard. Overall a very good beer that I am surprised is not getting better ratings. Thanks beer guru, hadn't even heard of this one and I like Dogfish.

The aroma is a blend between the traditional wheat beer (yeast, light fruit) and a tart quality. That tart quality comes through loud and clear in the taste, dominating the wheat beer aspects. If you like tart/sour, this one will probably be right up your alley. It does mellow out a little as it breathes. It has a normal weight to the body for the style. All in all, I don't prefer sour beers but this is a well-made example of the style.","delta490","Jun 17, 2014"

The taste is really different than you would expect from the look and aroma. It’s sweet with a decent flavor of grain and peaches. The texture is smooth and light that make for an easy summer drinking brew. Not and big and bold as most Dogfish head beers, but delicious just the same.","Lemke10","May 31, 2014"

When I tasted it, it was like a carbonated chardonnay. There was hardly any taste of wheat or hops, although some hints lingered. I don't know if DHB is trying to achieve this effect, but for sure Festina Peche doesn't taste like a beer. It is either amazing, or a flop.","JulioH","Apr 06, 2014"

While this still isn't my idea of a fantastic Berliner Weisse, they really got the peach flavor to shine this time around. Still lacks carbonation and the complexity of a sour but it's perfect to introduce someone to the concept of sourness in beer. Maybe one day they'll figure out how to make it as good as one of J Wakefield's Berliners.","Immortale25","Dec 20, 2013"

3,-17.8,3,3,3,3,3,"I don't know why this isn't in the fruit-flavoured beer category, but whatever. Either way, it's biggest problem is carbonation. It's way over-carbonated. So over-carbonated that it gets too foamy for the refreshing fruity characters to do their job. It's hard to call foam refreshing. Otherwise, I think it's really great. I'm not often into these kinds of things, but this is decent. For fruit beers, I like Shiner's prickly pear beer better, but this beats the hell out of New Belgium's attempt at frambozen bier. I like how the dry character does not detract from the peachiness and how the peachiness goes well with this sour beer with a slightly biscuity backbone. It's a good alternative to fruit flavoured beers that have more of a sweet, yeasty backbone.","ElCommodoro","Nov 09, 2013"

Didn't knock me out of my seat however. Perhaps I will try it again next summer because it seems like a very nice summer beer; this was on clearance for the end of the season and had caught my eye a few times before so I figured I'd get it before it's gone.","cubbienathan","Oct 29, 2013"

The taste started with a light tartness up front that gives way to ripe peach flavors that has a surprisingly dry finish. The wheat beer flavors were subtle but came through on the end and lingered on my palate. The Festina Peche is not an overly sweet beer but the peach adds a subtle sweetness to this sour beer. Overall the it was a good Berliner Weisse that highlights and is accentuated by the peach flavors.","brurevu","Sep 13, 2013"

Pours lightly hazy pale golden color with a 1-2 finger fairly dense white head with solid retention, that reduces to a thin lace cap that lingers. Light spotty lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of big peach, pear, tart lemon, apple, floral, grass, wheat, light bread, pepper, and floral/yeast earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance and complexity of peach with tart/fruity/spicy yeast ester notes; and solid strength. Taste of peach, pear, lemon, apple, floral, grass, pepper, wheat, light bread, and floral/yeast earthiness. Light fruity tartness on the finish; with lingering notes of peach, light fruits, floral, grass, pepper, wheat, light bread, and earthiness on the finish for a short bit. Nice balance and complexity of peach concentrate with malt and yeast flavors; with zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and light bodied; with a very smooth, crisp, and fairly prickly mouthfeel this is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with zero warming noticed after the finish as expected of 4.5%. Overall this is a nice flavored Berliner weisse style. Nice balance of flavors with solid robustness; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A nicely enjoyable and very session-able offering.","superspak","Sep 06, 2013"

It was difficult for me to discern any peach in the aroma. Although, I did find peach and a citrus punch with my first sip. This is an easy drinker, not very bitter at all, with a lingering semi-sour finish. The peach flavor definitely comes to life at the end. Wine enthusiasts would love this one. On a side note: my wife just had a sip and her entire face puckered up. She's not a fan of anything sour.","BushwyckCraft","Jul 04, 2013"

Tastes refreshing and goes down easy. It does have almost a Chardonnay tangy finish which I'm not wild about but it doesn't ruin it. I'm not a fruit in the beer type drinker but on a hot day I'd reach for this over a peach tea. The ABV is great, since it doesn't eat up much beer credits. I can't see having this regularly, but it might be something I offer at bbqs in the summer. Not bad.","sjones5045","May 05, 2013"

This beer delivers on its promise and is a good example of style.","57md","Mar 03, 2013"

This ale poured a hazy yellow color, produced an average white head, featured nice retention, just a little lacing left on the glass. The aroma of this ale was very nice, bursting with fresh peach nectar, some suggestions of malted wheat. Medium bodied, this ale features a baseline of malted wheat, that gives way to a sour peach nectar, and Granny Smith Apples. The favorite part of this beer, for me, is the sour bite you get about midway through, that sour bite gives way to a dry finish that leaves you ready for the next sip. Very nice session beer, would be a great summer beer- Thanks Dogfish, another winner! Prost!","GossageBrewery","Jan 16, 2013"

This is perhaps the wisest thing I have ever done, and my wife greatly appreciated it. For most people that do not drink a lot of IPA, they are turned off by the ""excessive"" hop taste (Being from Seattle, I do not think there is a such thing). With mixing in the Festina Peche, it cut away at the ""excessive hop flavor"" without taking away from the essence of the IPA. It was easy on the palette yet went down like an IPA. I liked it so much I got a growler filled with 2/3 90 Minute IPA and 1/3 Festina Peche.","tjsjostrom","Sep 04, 2012"

I personally wish it was a bit more tart and sour, but the beer definitely serves it's purpose of being a perfectly refreshing summer drink.

Pours a really light yellow/orange color. Some cloudiness, but the carbonation is streaming up from the bottom. Looks really effervescent. Not much head. This is DFH's take on a berliner weiss as far as I know. Smell- PEACH! Sweet, ripe peach skins, like you had a very fresh peach sitting in the palm of your hand. Taste- nice tart, somewhat sour start, followed by the peach sweetness. Nice dry finish with tight carbonation. This beer is absolutely perfect for a summer day, and a really interesting take on the berliner-weiss style. I would expect nothing less from DFH- always an interesting interpretation and spin on things. I'll buy this a lot this summer if it stays around. Good stuff.","lnashsig","Jun 14, 2012"

This beer had good drinkability, it was crisp and refreshing, with some interesting flavors to hold my attention, I could drink a couple of these on a warm day outside. What I liked most about this beer was that it was solid all the way around and had no real weak points. What I liked least about this beer was the price, it's a little to pricey to buy a lot of and it won't stay on the shelf long. I might buy another before they are all gone but for the price I might be more interested in something a little darker or stronger, but I do recommend giving this beer a try. This was another good and solid beer from Dogfish Head, they take a lot of risks but it always results in more hits then misses, and while this isn't a beer that I just have to have, it's nice to know that there's no reason to ignore this style just because I had one mediocre experience, good job guys, this is one tasty beer.","StoutHunter","May 26, 2012"

3.39,-7.1,3.5,4.5,3,3,3,"Festina Peche started out pretty well, but then ended on a very weird and funky note.

3.6,-1.4,4,4,3.5,3,3.5,"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was the brazen tartness. While it was well within the guidelines of the style, this beer produced flavoring that really made the palate sing, and pucker. The lactic sourness and fruity tartness were, again, appropriate, but effectively took away from the peach character, which would have made a good beer even better, if given the chance.","TheBrewo","Aug 25, 2011"

It is somewhat one-demensional, but and interesting take on a style we don't get much of in the states. Its really easy to drink and I like the sessionability of it.

3.46,-5.2,4,3,3.5,4,3.5,"Pours a slightly hazy straw color with about an inch of pure white, bubbly head. Smells of straw, faint peach, citrus, some sugar, and a slight funk. Honestly, not as much peach as I had hoped for. Tastes of wheat, straw, tart peach, and some lemon. The emphasis is on the peach, and this carries over into the tart, dry finish. Again, I had hoped for more peach, but this is still a good brew. Overall, a refreshing offering that I’d gladly have again, especially in this inescapable summer heat.","eclipse54","Aug 15, 2011"

It is a thoroughly enjoyable summer beer and certainly an interesting interpretation of a lesser-known style. My only qualm with it is that the sourness does impede a bit on the beer's drinkability. However, I haven't had many Berliner Weissbiers so this may be on par with the style. Nevertheless, it is a great beer and definitely something worth trying if you can find it.","wahhmaster","Aug 14, 2011"
3.92,7.4,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"I will definitely drink again, a perfect summer evening on the porch type of beer. Reminds me of a cider, but far more interesting and quite dry. A very nice effort from the boys & girls at DFH.","DJHombre","Aug 14, 2011"
4.03,10.4,3.5,3,4.5,4,4.5,"This brew pours a hazy yellow-white color with a tiny head. The aroma is the weak part, it mostly smells of musty fruits. The taste is much better though, with very tart fruit being the primary flavor. It's also slightly sour, with a bit of graininess on the finish. Very nice. The mouthfeel is nice, it's well-carbonated and goes down easily. The drinkability is very good. Overall, a delicious and very unique brew, it's really not quite a Berliner Weiss, but still worth consuming en-masse.","shand","Aug 14, 2011"
3.35,-8.2,3.5,3.5,3,4,3.5,"Overall: I was sadly disappointed with this beer, but it's nevertheless still Dogfish Head quality brewing. It's more on the sweetened side than the fruity side, and I'm always a larger fan of the latter. Very good for a hot summer day, but otherwise, makes me long to try Berliner weissbiers over in Germany someday.","magictacosinus","Aug 12, 2011"

3.21,-12.1,4,3,3,3.5,3.5,"O: This is an extremely unique summer seasonal. It is rather mouth puckering and I feel it could benefit from being a little less tart and having more peach flavors. There is a decent complexity though. The drinkability is unfortunately low for me on this one.","justintcoons","Aug 09, 2011"
3.12,-14.5,3,3.5,3,3,3,"O: This isn't terrible, but it comes off very messy. Too many aspects of this beer collide to negate flavors and sensations. Some nice light juicy flavors, but they feel contaminated by the pickled flavors. Furthermore, the mouth plays cleanup by drying up the flavors quickly and entirely. The body of a crisp brew, without the crisp clean flavors. Good concept beer, but the concentrated flavors tax this too heavily.","Cavery","Aug 08, 2011"
3.62,-0.8,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Served on-tap in a pint glass, the beer pours a slightly hazy, bright, pale yellow color with lots of bubbles and a slight ring of film around the glass. Very light aromas of toasted oats and the slightest hint of peach sweetness. Flavors are light and the carbonation keeps it very crisp. Semi-sour flavor, with very mild fruit highlights. The aftertaste is tangy and sour, and the finish is a little slick and a little sharp. Very interesting brew, and the fruit doesn't overpower like other fruit beers tend to do. Very light and refreshing on a hot day.","GarthDanielson","Aug 07, 2011"

2.81,-23,4,3,2.5,3.5,2.5,"Overall: This beer is definetly not for everyone, it has a nice sour taste but its not a typical sour, its as if they used green peaches to brew this.

3.87,6,4,4.5,3.5,3.5,4,"Overall: Almost like a dry peach champagne. Aroma is great, and I didn't find any off-notes in the flavor. Something seemed to be missing in this one, though. The flavor profile was a tad bit one-dimensional, while the CO2 was probably a bit over the top. Definitely a good, tasty beer, though, so please give it a try to see what you think.","mdvatab","Aug 03, 2011"
3.75,2.7,4,4,3.5,3.5,4,"T: Very smooth and sweet with a lot of peach flavor. A slight wheat taste on the finish.

That said, I still enjoyed it a lot.","notchucknorris","Aug 03, 2011"
3.79,3.8,3,4,4,3.5,3.5,"O: Well it's no Monk's Flemish Sour ale (yes i know it's a different style), where the tartness is followed by a bit more complexity, but this is still a very enjoyable beer. And it's extremely outside the box. I will probably be purchasing my own pack of this, since this was only a 12oz sample.

Too much wheat in a beer can sometimes hinder drinkability for me, and this beer does a great job of maintaining a wheat flavor but not letting it take over.

3.51,-3.8,3.5,2.5,4,4,3.5,"Pours a soft, pale, golden yellow color with a thin, foamy white head. The aroma has characteristics of apple juice as well as fresh, tart apples, but it veers off beyond being just tart to the point of being a bit musty and sour. The flavor is more appealing, with the tart apple character being complemented by some light wheat, and the peaches add a nice, light, sweet fruitiness. The light and active carbonation further complements this light, sweet/tart flavor.

I've never had this before but other told me it is much sweeter than normal, would love to try an older one to see if this is the case. Has a nice yellowish/copper color with a nice peachy smell to it, that didn't completely throw me off when i dove my nose into my dogfish snifter to smell all the fruit. Just can't see anybody drinking more than one of these at a time, i could see splitting a bottle with someone while having a dessert in place of a port.

I really enjoyed this beer, the peach juice didn't overpower the beer for me, and the lactic acid they add in the brew kettle was very balanced overall, making it a real easy drinker. The price seems steep for a simple 4.5% ABV beer, but overall I really enjoyed this beer. Just sour enough to not make you think you're drinking a Lindemans Peche.","knucks999","Jun 19, 2011"

3.78,3.6,4,3.5,4,4,3.5,"Sour is the first taste that comes to mind. Its very tart, like a Sweet-Tart candy, in the front and then syrupy on the back, like a cola. The taste profile is all about the sourness of the peach and lemon flavors. The finish is ultra-dry like champagne, but it has the added sour bite in the aftertaste that makes it different. Its not at all like a traditional beer, but its also not like any beer I've ever had before, and I'm always down to try new styles and beers, especially those by Dogfish. I'm enjoying this more than I expected I would and I'm glad I bought it. Nice summery beer with the dry finish that makes you crave more.","chodinheaven","Jun 14, 2011"

The smell is dominated by peach, a tart lemony citrus, a touch of citrusy hops, and metallic notes. The taste will wake the taste buds up with a tart peach, lemon, citrus domination. Bready and grainy malts in the back. Slight peachy sweetness like a remnant that didn't ferment out. A nicely balanced, tart, sour, but refreshing, crisp, clean beer.

If there is any peach profile to this beer it is in the aroma. Even then, one must use imagination to detect it. Taste is very tart. I can only imagine what this beer might have tasted like without the peach extract. The sour finish lingers and finishes clean. Medium high carbonation with some bite on the tongue. Body is light. Texture is acidic. This beer is interesting because it is the first of this style for me. I will drink another, but early in the evening with a light crisp salad perhaps.","chickenflea","Jun 08, 2011"

Gotta love those sours.","UTCengOwl","Jun 07, 2011"
3.65,0,4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"O: Would be great if it was significantly more sour, but is is this is still a good beer. A bit low on the wheat for a berliner weiss. The peach presence is nice but would be much better if there was much more lacto.","Azurescens","Jun 07, 2011"

Very refreshing with lively carbonation and nice puckering acidity. I had a 2010 about a month ago and found it to be more complex and sour - i look forward to trying this with more age - i realize berliners arent ment to be aged but it seemed to work.","Trilogy31","Jun 06, 2011"

Spritzy and tart lemon citrus aroma over a crisp wheat malt backdrop immediately fills the nose. A sharp sweet and sour lemon note hits the tip of the tongue at first and refreshingly glides over the palate with a solid tart feel into a somewhat dry and sticky lemon zesty citrus finish. Ending notes of moderately sour peach and lemon juice seem held back enough by malt character to makes this taste more like a ""Sweetart"" than a ""War Head.""","albertjr21","Jun 06, 2011"

Would be fantastic for those hot summer days.","NATOuk","Jun 02, 2011"
3.61,-1.1,4,3,4,3.5,3.5,"I like it a lot, but the aroma reminds me of what happens when you leave chicken stock in a walk-in cooler for too long. You get this sourness in the nose and maybe I'm just biased and influenced by my past experiences with sour chicken stock, but this reminds me too much of it to be as enjoyable as it could. That being said, I think it's incredibly well balanced and it doesn't tread too closely to being a juicy-sweet fruit beer. Very nice little number.","StaEva","May 31, 2011"

3.6,-1.4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"O: The addition of peaches helps to balance off the sourness associated with this style, much like fruit syrups are added to other Berliner weissbiers to make them more palatable. It’s easy to drink for the style and the low alcohol content makes it very sessionable, if you can handle the light amount of sourness.","metter98","May 26, 2011"
3.72,1.9,3,3.5,4,4,3.5,"O - Not a big fan of Wild/Sour ales, but I have tried a few (including this on numerous occasions which I feel like I enjoyed more previously).

It is a weissbier brewed with peach, with the option at the bar to add mango concentrate, which I opted not to do. I don't know if the tap was bad or what, but this beer was soda-fizzy, and tasted watered down. Poured hazy yellow with little to no head. Bitter hop aroma, and kind of funky. Thin, watery taste, with a little bit of fruit and stale wood. Light and fairly easily drinkable, but not too much flavor or character, which is not what I expect from Dogfish Head.","Rifugium","May 03, 2011"

But I must say that I do not enjoy this brew specifically. When I received a 4 pack from my family as a gift I was really excited to try it because it was new at the time. I poured my first one into a glass and everything looked good it smelled a little funky but that didn't bother me. It was the taste it was really not my cup of tea. To this day I can't figure out why I think this beer tastes like vomit to me. I feel really bad that I can't enjoy this brew like a lot of other people do but this is one that I can't get passed my lips anymore.","Knapp85","Mar 20, 2011"

Poured from a 2004 750 ml bottle there was still a ton of carbonation and it showed with a nice finger worth of tiny white bubbles that sat at the top of the snifter for a while. The color reminded me of a peach or apricot. The aromas of peach juice and funk were still very prevalent in the nose. I have had this fresh but this aged bottle was fantastic in the flavor department. It was tart with a hint of peach sweetness coming thru to make this thing superbly drinkable. We sipped at this bottle for a good hour and enjoyed every drop. The mouthfeel was light with great carbonation for your tongue. I would not have thought to age this one that long but I will be doing a few bottles for myself. It really just mellowed down the sourness and made this a great brew","joepais","Feb 04, 2011"

I may have guessed a citrus mix. This is a carbonated, refreshing beer, but is so light I am not inclined to seek it out again. The syrupy fruity flavor just does not have enough texture to make it interesting. There is a little bit of grassy flavor at the finish, but this still drinks close to a soda than I prefer with a beer. This has a pretty accessible level of sour to it, thus is a nice introduction to sourer beer flavors.

The taste starts with some nice, bitingly tart lemon wedge, then moves into some green apple, cardamom, coriander, and a late sweetness like that found after a Sour Patch Kid has been in your mouth awhile. The body is light, with a moderately active carbonation and a dry, almost sticky finish. I was thinking wit for most of the tasting, but the tartness destroyed that possibility. I had forgotten about Berliner Weisses. It was interesting that I didn't get too much in the way of peaches, but there is a possibility this was a slightly vintage bottle, so that could have influenced things a bit.

The aroma falls a bit short, but the smell of peaches does come through. Very strong when it comes to taste. The sourness from the lacto culture complements the peaches very well, and there is a grainy wheat character that backs both up. The carbonation is plentiful and appropriate adding to the light body of this beer.","Agold","Jul 16, 2010"

The aroma is sour patch tart with a hint of peach and some grainy wheat aroma. The flavor is quite tart up front with an acidic bite that is very refreshing. It also has a very wheaty malt flavor as well as some peach and pear notes in the background. This beer is quite interesting in that it is kind of like a Berliner weisse mit schuss, but with the syrup (peach in this case) built in. I was skeptical when I heard about this at first, but it works quite well. The body is light with effervescent carbonation and a spiky mouthfeel that is quite refreshing. It is also one of the lowest ABV beers that DFH makes and is a great BBQ beer. I could drink these all day, and it is a nice change of pace from other summer wheat beers.","zoso1967","Jul 13, 2010"

Taste was surprisingly enjoyable (compared to the bland / fruity aroma) - wheat / grains, with some peach starchiness, with a puckering, sour finish. Mouthfeel is pretty light - that crisp, sour finish is what saved this beer for me.

The peach is MUCH more detectable here...and I'm having a hard time deciding which version I enjoyed more. Immediately, I'm getting a bit of sourness, followed quickly by strong peach and nectarine flavors. Then ending with a very subtle sour taste. I take that back, this beer really isn't even sour anymore...just mellowly tart. I must say this version may have better drinkability. The mouthfeel is quite nice and crisp.

Once acclimated to the sour bite, caramel and bread come through without even a modicum of bitterness or hop presence. Malts come through a bit more in the middle honey and caramel playing the role of sweet opposite the ever-present sour. Fresh fruits make an appearance as well, mostly peach with lemon.

I can see how this beer can be slammed back on a hot summer day, but so can Michelob Ultra Lime, for the same reasons. Just not what I was expecting from Dogfish Head.","hophead21210","Jun 03, 2010"

This is my first Berliner Weiss, and I know not to expect much in the way of a head, but I'd like something. The nose is largely of peaches, but it seems fairly muted/weak (and I haven't had a problem picking up aromas from my other beers tonight). A few sips raise my opinion of this beer greatly, as Dogfish Head absolutely nailed it with how tart they made this beer, it stops just a bit short of becoming overwhelming. The peach flavor is a fantastic balance to the sourness and really rounds out the beer well. The body is light and Festina Peche is highly carbonated (which works well with this beer). It's almost ridiculous how drinkable this beer is, especially given the sour aspect. I'd love to spend a summer afternoon leisurely working through a few of these.","axeman9182","May 21, 2010"

Now that I am typing this out, I know what this reminds me of taste wise. Growing up for some odd reason I use to steal the lemon juice from our fridge and try to concoct ""lemonade"" with it by adding sugar. It never turned out right and you would always drink nine tenths of the water/sugar/lemon juice mixture before getting any sweetness. Hence, for most of the time you were drinking bitter tasting water. That is what this beer tastes like. It reminds me of lemon juice and a hint of peach flavor added to it. That is the puckering effect I am remembering...from when I was a child making that drink. I am glad I was able to try this beer, but I would probably not seek it out in the future.

Poured a slightly hazy straw color with a half inch bright white head that reduced its volume by half in less the 15 seconds before settling into a small slick with a tight band around the perimeter of the glass; no lacing on this one. Mild nose - prickly citrus and light, fruity esters. Taste consistent with nose; however, citrus is expressed more as citric acid than any definable fruit flavor, and a little bit of wheat comes out at the finish. Mouthfeel is light-bodied and very lively with a great deal of astringency that puckers the cheeks and stimulates the salivary glands before culminating in a tart, dry finish. Just starting to explore this style and I found Festina Peche to be quite drinkable, flavorful and refreshing. ABV makes it quite sessionable, but astringency can be a little overwhelming after more than a couple. Nonetheless, a great example of the style.","Jwale73","Oct 17, 2009"

For instance I´ve seen a beer staffer at a well-know store telling another customer that this is only good as a paint stripper, and better stick to ""Son of a Peach"" as a fruit ale of choice. Different beers and different styles... This is quite a nice brew for a Berlin Weissbier, and purism aside if one thinks of the hints of peach, it is actually quite true to style.

Massive foamy head rise quick and falls fast signalling high carbonation. The smell is yeasty with a little bit of spice and some tropical fruit.

Smell was a burst of peach/apple with a hint of watermelon. Nothing faint about the power of the smell... Almost a little to dominating. The initial first taste of this beer is a trip if you have never tried it before. It reminds me of some type of a sour fruit juice. You get a sweet sugar peach taste mixed with a sour apple backbone... quite odd. You cant taste the alcohol at any point from start to finish. Aftertaste is a sour tart malt that doesnt seem to linger and fades quickly. Mouthful is ok if your into sour taste but may not be enjoyable for those who arent. For me, drinkability would be ok but I wouldnt drink more than a 4 pack in a session though... Overall I could see where alot of people would think this to be way to sour or tart. However, being that you cant taste the alcohol, the rating goes up higher. The taste vs price ratio was a little too much for me on this and I dont think I will be buying another 4 pack anytime soon.

Smells of malts and fruits, very acidic, sour fruits. Peach can be found in the scent too. The taste is very sour of fruits, acidic ones. Some peach can be found once the sour leaves the tongue. Malty aftertaste on this one, definately reminds me of some malt liquor I have had in the past. Kind of tastes like a sour kids drink or something. Mouthfeel is a little bit heavier than water with good carbonation that helps balance out the flavor a bit, still can't get over this candy sour taste.

Mouthfeel is tart, good idea to have a glass of water after this. Drinkability is decent, could have another one. This is a good beer and would most certainly be a big step in the right direction if you were trying to ween someone off drinking a "" hard ___"" or whatever those folks at BMC put out with some sweetness to it.","mltobin","Jul 03, 2009"

The flavor is on the sour side. Has a decent lemon, peach taste to it. Has a dry texture like a tart lemonade. A light body. The finish is strong and tart.

3.76,3,4.5,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"If there is a fault to this beer, it's that it doesn't come standard in six ounce flutes. Both hard to take down and a total delight, this is a cerebral beer that lights an MRI orange and green. It's a thoughtful and thought-inducing beer that tastes like decent Champagne and over-marinated ceviche. Tart as all get out with the taste of granny smith apples, a hint of coconut, and yeah peach, it finishes grainy like any good weiss should. Truth is it's likely too sour for most anyone, reminiscent of tame Lambic. But what I love is the interaction of wheaty malt, citrusy hops, and dry white peaches. You don't drink a lot of this, but what you do is more than beer. It's a message, maybe even propaganda. One you learn from, accept, but don't have the freedom to question.","ngandhi","Jun 30, 2009"

This beer is not a one-dimensional peach beer, it is instead it's own truly complex style of beer.

Low carbonation but astringintly sour and tart, with a slight hint of peachy sweetness. There no hop presence but who need it with it being this tart.

The fruit that was missing from the smell was much more evident in the taste. Not easy to make it out as peaches, but clearly quite a fruity beer. As light and airy as a Lambic in the mouth, and very refreshing.

Nose is like smelling the skin of a fresh peach just before you take a bite. You also get noticeable hints of tartness. That same tart feel transcinds right to the front of the tongue as you take first sip. The sour feel meets up with the malt to create almost a flemish sour or wild ale effect. This one is not as harsh as some of those sour bombs are though. It is much more drinkable for my likes. A mineraly, malty hue is left on the buds for a unique mouthfeel of sour, thick and dryness.

Smell was very underwhelming with some very faint perhaps peachy smells that I wouldn't have picked up if I didn't know what it was, along with an almost skunky yeast smell. Very unique to me as it was also my 1st of the style. Taste was dry very bland peachy flavor up front, followed by a noticeable tartness in the mouth and then a definite wheaty finish to it. Very different, and although drinkable, not the easiest beer to enjoy. Perhaps just the style, but this lacked almost any sweetness at all and as a result almost none of the flavors were brought out very well. Extremely mild and tart.","JDV","Feb 24, 2008"

The aroma was full of peach flesh sweetness backed up by noble, sulfury hops. The flavour was pretty intense, lemony sourness with a lighter peach character. There were some floral hops that were apparent for a moment up front and peach/sour really lingered. Very light bodied, approaching thin, with plenty of fizzy carbonation.

Smells fruity and sour, with tart wheat, lemon, peach and maybe some banana. The flavor is quite similar - acidic, sour and tart, with no residual sweetness, and hints of dried peach and apricot, banana?, a touch of leafy hops, and a big backing of yeast and nutty wheat. The body is light and dry, with high carbonation and a fleeting finish - very appropriate, it seems, for this style, and quite refreshing. Overall a good summer beer, but don't drink it too cold as you will miss out on its nuances. The wheat is quite flavorful in this one, and the beer is very refreshing, but I think a touch of sweetness would add even more to it.","mmmbeer","Dec 05, 2007"

Taste starts off very puckering, with the tart fruit (almost lambic like) and then ends on a somewhat dry biscuity note. Mouthfeel is light, yet has a nice bite of carbonation to even things out.

Nose was an interesting combination of more standard wheat beer aromas and a smooth peach in there as well. The flavor had me a little more; the peach is extremely subtle, along with a lot of wheat and some spiciness. Definitely not your standard fruit beer, which often seem to be overpowered by their single fruit flavor. This one was much more drinkable and complex.

Pours and looks like a hefeweizen, cloudy straw color with a fizzy head. Most hefes have a more impressive head, but with a hard pour, this one provides an impressive enough white head. Smell is mildly malty with a hint of the peach syrup. Leaves some lacing on the glass. The peach flavor is blended in very well. This is not a style I would ordinarily appreciate, but the potential for peach syrup in a beer was done as well as I think it could be done. Some initial maltiness followed by a mild peach and slightly citrusy flavor. Neither the sourness or peach sweetness were overpowering or annoying. Mouthfeel was crisp and rich enough for a light summer beer. Drinkability for me is not high, a couple of glasses of this flavor would be enough and it is not a high alcohol beer.

The first sip is quite tart and very refreshing on a hot day. The peaches are more prominent now, as is the green apple flavor. The sourness is spot on, and is my favorite aspect of the beer. This is my ideal summer brew, and I'm sad that this is my last one. It's still drinking great so maybe I'll pick up another 4 pack. I wish there were more of this style on the shelves right now.

Just an overall puckering taste with no relief. I really don't taste any peach, just an overpowering lemon flavor. The feel is light and very fizzy. The sourness drys the mouth and is cloying.

Flavors of underripe peach skin with the appropriate tartness, a light mineral background, tart wheat and a faint grass-like hop. I can certainly see how this is classified as a Berliner Weiss. Tart peach flavors are a nice complement. Light bodied, clean and zesty; a good palate cleanser. It takes me back quite a few years when Nodding Head's Berliner Weiss was flowing at the brew festivals, yet with a nice, tart addition of underripe peach.

Peachy sourness immediately washes over the tongue along with more wood and wheat. Funky lemon acidity. This is growing on me...I'm amazed DFH has the balls to do something like this.

Taste, too, was close to BMC, but again, there were other characteristics present to off-set this. I found this to be quite sour, actually, and somewhat pleasant. If you like gueuze, saison, and/or flemish sour ales, you'll probably enjoy this, as well. Not a whole lot of CO2 in this one. Body is quite and rather refreshing.

The only other time I've had this style was on a trip to Bavaria a few years ago where they had Berliner Kindl on tap and it was flavored with rasberry syrup.

Then at the very end there is a very tart burst of lemon zest/peach, then back to nothing. Very interesting, but I prefer a beer that isn't so delicate, faint, and fruity.

2.97,-18.6,3,3.5,3,2.5,2.5,"Sweet peach flavors are quickly brought down by a succulent bitter finish that is almost sour. As the style should be this isn't overly complex. However the wheat component is very staballizing. Seems like it could be slightly more carbonated. Mouth is puckering to a degree and leaves you craving your next sip. After finishing this this beer gets really acrid. Flavors of a vitamin C pill leaves a chalky unwelcome grit on the tongue.","mcallister","Jul 07, 2007"

Taste is very bitter and sour, but not sour where it does not go down pretty smooth, has a very tarty taste as well, this beer is very unsual and one that goes down pretty nicely, overall I actually enjoyed this different tasting beverage and would have it again and again.","gunnerman","Jul 06, 2007"

Appears a very cloudy light yellow color with about a finger of white foam that quickly fades leaving no noticeable lace. Smells of bready grains, lemon and peach. Taste is of sour peaches and maybe a touch of yeast and malt. A notch below medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Very crisp, dry and refreshing. Not a bad effort, but I prefer 1809.

And that's too bad, because it's an excellent summer beer. But the tartness is an acquired taste for sure. Not unlike that of a Flemish sour red, like Rodenbach. It takes some getting used to. But if you're into tart beers, or you're just ready to try something different, definitely give the Festina Peche a go.

Sourness is a notch below ""extreme"" but it leaves no room for argument, that this is a quite sour creation, and no doubt will not be for everybody.

4.27,17,3.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"I sampled this at the Grey Lodge the other night for their DFH tasting and picked up a few bottles the next day. The beer poured a very cloudy golden color into my DFH pint glass with a medium thickness, fluffy white head that runs away quickly. The aroma has alot going on. There a very present peach aroma running around and it is also a bit creamy. The taste is more of the same and oh so good. You first get a nice tart sensation in the mouth that is rounded out by a fresh peach taste and balanced out with an almost creamy texture. Probably due to the lactic fermentation this gets. This is a really good representation of the Berliner style. You get the tartness that is a trademark of the style but the peach flavor is really enjoyable and with a low ABV of 4.5%, this is going to be on my summer beer rotation at home for some while.","ggaughan","Jun 08, 2007"
4,9.6,4,4,4,4,4,"At the brewpub I noticed that Festina Peche was not the Festina Lente yeah I know...anyway I asked Wes the bartender for a half pint on this one just b/c of the tart character and my eagerness to start drinking one of the 90 minutes through the Randall. Appearance a clouded apricot light golden tone with a large fizzy whtie head leaves behind thin lacing after dwindling away. Aromatics contain that great tart lactic character trademark of the Berliner Weissbier of Germany but in this case also an evident nose of Peaches with a light herbal quality detected as well. Flavors definitely pucker the lips a great eye opening tartness dives into my senses leaving behind a clean dryness after the rush lets up fruity peach notes are not syrupy or cloying very well blended into the design of this beer I'm guessing with Dogfish real peaches here great and refreshing with tartness and funky citrus wheat mix as well. Mouthfeel is light and spritzy carbonation really tickles the throat with the fine bubbled flow as stated the finish is definitely dry once the tart lactic character fades very nice stuff. Drinkablity quite refreshing and interesting but I preferred the half pint although I would not have had any problmes definitely the drinkable type of funky tart beers not that ones that start to turn the stomach acidic a true session beer.","WVbeergeek","Jun 08, 2007"
