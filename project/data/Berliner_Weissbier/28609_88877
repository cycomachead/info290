3.6,-11.3,4.25,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"Beautiful hazy pink body that had loads of head as this bottle was a gusher like so many from the 2014 batch have been. The smell is pretty yogurty with a hint of citrus. The taste is fairly one note. Loads of lactic tartness and yogurty flavor. You get a slight hint of cranberry at the very back end when this warms a bit. The tartness is dialed back a bit this season from NS on this berliner, but there are just so many better berliners on the market. I wanted something beyond lactic tartness and a bit more fruit. There are a lot of great non-fruited berliners available, so the fruit really needs to shine in my opinion.","PHBoiler","May 17, 2014"
4.12,1.5,4,3.75,4.25,4.75,4,"Overall: Really good stuff. The cranberries are integrated very well with the base beer and add some additional complexity without overwhelming the base beer. Drinkability is insanely high as well. I could (and likely will) kill the entire 750ml in fairly short order.","Jonada","May 11, 2014"

Smell is slightly sour with malt, grain, cranberry, and acidic aromas. Taste is much the same with slightly sour grain and cranberry flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of acidity on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer with a solid slightly sour cranberry aspect in the aroma and flavor.","UCLABrewN84","Apr 26, 2014"

Taste consistent with nose with the addition of a tart cranberry. Mouthfeel is light and lively with quite a bit of astringency.

Nightshift and made some unique berlinner weisse beer and it was an awesome ride getting to try all 4 of these seasonal beers by Nightshift. Nightshift is a great East coast brewery for sure. They make some of my favorite berlinner weisse beers brewed in the USA.","4DAloveofSTOUT","Mar 02, 2014"

4.14,2,3.75,4,4.25,4.5,4,"The beer pours a cloudy pinkish red, with an opaque body and a tiny, spritzy head of white bubbles. There seems to be white, cloudy pulp within the beer’s haze, which I suspect is just the particles of cranberry and orange peel. The beer smells excellently citrusy with a lacto-pop and a touch of yogurt, it also sports a nice touch of cranberry, though that is regrettably muddled with the citrus scents. Strong scents of wheat flakes come through as well, heralding the amped up malt bill that was used for this beer. On the tongue, the beer is beautifully tart and acidic with a light, fruity sweet balance that helps the beer to pop in the mouth but not pucker. In comparison to Mainer Weisse (Night Shift’s last weisse release) the sour is much more under control and balanced, and the flavors are just beautiful. This beer sits very close to a classic Berliner in my mind, but also has the terrific fruit funk that establishes it as an American Weisse. The beer features strong lemon flavors that morph into beautiful orange juice with a pop of tart cranberry, lime, and just a touch of plastic acidity that I sometimes find in fruited weisses. Running strongly underneath all these flavors, and building as you sip, is the delicious flavor of wheat flakes, which is far stronger than in any other Night Shift weisse. This wheat flavor blends with the fresh fruit and provides a jammy taste, though not as much so as Everweisse did. In the mouth, the beer feels on the heavy side of light in body, with a strong carbonation and effervescence that adds to the beers crisp and refreshing mouthfeel. This beer has more weight than most other weisses I’ve tried, but I like that and wish more of the American Weisses sported this weight on the tongue. The subtle jam flavors are also delicious, and while the cranberry is a bit light in overall flavor, I still love its additions, as well as the orange peels. This is another great American Weisse from Night Shift, and one that I would happily sip in the heat of summer.","Maxwell","Jan 24, 2014"
