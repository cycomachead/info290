"Looked and smelled great. Then downhill path as once I began to drink it I got a very thin watery mouth feel. Having tried other SARA beers this is definitely one of the bottom beers they have to offer. Nice lemon zest flavor and crisp but, just not enough mouth feel or other flavors come through"

"750 ml bottle, part of fall 2014 batch. My bottle was quite sour, strong on lemon and wheat, with surprisingly low carbonation -- almost flat. Not the most complex sour beer you'll ever have, but fresh, characterful, and highly drinkable."

"Light lemon tart and sour taste. The most recent batch is 4% abv."

"Pour is a transparent pale yellow with a white head that dissipates immediately and then sits still.  Nose is a bit sharp, loads of dustiness, moderate lacto, and a fair bit of lemon.  Taste is a bit more lemony, lacto mid palate but gentle, slight bitterness in the finish.  Still fairly dusty up front with notes of grains.  Lighter body, a bit slick mid palate, strong carb."

"O- Very refreshing Berliner; not the most complex or interesting. I have to imagine that adding fruit to this would get this up to the next level, though."

"O: Nice but not great. Honestly, this is on the lower end of the SARA brews I've tried in terms of my enjoyment. It's clean, light, drying, and very drinkable, so it's a fine example of its style. That said, New Glarus just does it better as far as I am concerned, and they do it for 1/4 the price and in a much more accessible way. I'm glad I got to try this, but would not go out of my way to get bottles unless they were for someone else."

"Pours a murky light yellow with a foamy off-white head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace slowly drip into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is sour with malt, grain, salt, lemon, and acidic aromas. Taste is much the same with sour lemon and salt flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of acidity on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that is light and refreshing."

"O - Tart and acidic take on a German low ABV. Very drinkable and nice."

"Overall - Pretty good. Nothing like a saison though."

"On tap at the brewery. Dark golden orange with a fine white head. Dry grainy pale malts, tart stone fruit, light winey influence, brett. Crisp, dry, a bit astringent from the wine, subtle bitterness. Wine is well-integrated, contributing just enough fruit and acidity without taking over."
