"Straw color with a quickly fading white foam. Smells of peaches and wheat. The taste is just okay. I was hoping for a bit more peach flavor but you do taste subtle fruitiness upfront. Very well carbonated but the mouthfeel is lacking. I liked the second beer more than the first but I wouldn't buy this beer again."
""
"O: the peche in the name had me expecting a lambic but this is Berliner all the way – should have named it pfirsich. A great beer for a summer afternoon sitting in a garden."
"The fact I can see it as an excuse for the next few weeks of"
"Very sour and delicious, try it if you can!!"
"Another outstanding beer from Delaware.  Just enough peach!"
""
"I really like this beer a lot . It's not overwhelmingly peachy, just enough fruity without being wimpy.  Goes great with summer."
""
""
""
"Way too sour and hardly any peach! Very disappointing."
"Pale straw color, lots of bubbles and a massive white head.  A little barnyard funk, cut grass and a hint of peach on the nose.  Nice, mouth-puckering tartness, slight creaminess and, again, just a touch of peach in the flavor.  Not my favorite Berliner Weisse, but not bad.  This one's pretty easy to find and still scratches that itch."

"This was a good beer. A little weak for DFH."

"Overall: 3.5/5 Pretty good - a little bland, but would be a good choice in a bar"

"A little tart for my taste, but overall pretty solid"
""
"Due to the fizziness and foaminess of the pour, I opted to drink this from the bottle instead. The peach flavor and foaminess come together as a a good substitute for sparkling wine. Otherwise, definitely a summer time/BBQ beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"Light and fizzy could use more flavor. It's ok."
"Great summer beer by DFH. The peach flavor is tremendous. I understand that this is a session beer, but I wish the ABV was a tad higher."
""
""
""
"Great sour beer!   Tasty and only slightly acidic.   Clean, crisp and delicious."
""
""
""
""
""
"V - Not really worth purchasing."
""
"A weisse beer that is absolutely reminiscent of a white wine. Effervescent fizzy carbonation, with a light sourness. Was expecting a puckering of the lips but found this to be softened out by the addition of the peach. Would absolutely go well with most food items, especially meats or seafood. Very enjoyable"
"I love this brew. Perfect for a hot day. This is one of the few Berliner style brews available to me in a 4 pack. All other options are expensive bombers."
"Will drink again."
""
""
""
"So peachy good! Light and crisp. Smells good and tastes better!"
""
""
""
"Reminiscint of a fuzzy navel wine cooler (my teenage years, I know fuzzy navel). Thin bodies. Nice clean lager-like finish. At 4.5%, very drinkable. Refreshing. Prickly. Appetizing. Definitely worth a try."
""
""
"Very tardy and almost explodes when it hits your mouth so it does have a nice fizz to it. Also very light, reminds me of a peach cider with a dry finish. Flavor wise, it's sweet and very tardy and I don't pick up too much of the aroma. Not crazy about it but I am glad I tried it."

"Does it need to be anything else? No, absolutely not. Insanely addictive. I remember when DFH first came out with this beer, I was worried about how much I would see it on the shelves. Luckily it has become a staple, I see it all the time now, and deservedly so. As I am writing this review I haven't had this beer in over a month, but as soon as I feel consecutive 90+degree days again, I'll be going to it...."

"I quite enjoyed this one from Dogfish Head, it definitely wasn't the classic that I was hoping for but it had enough going for it to keep things interesting and enjoyable, particularly because I've frequently found Berliner Weisse beers a little too strong and overpowering at times. The beer had a pleasant citrus and peach taste to it that went down relatively easily, particularly after it settled down and opened up some; it's one well worth trying but I'd probably opt for something else over this one if I ever came across it in future."

"Festina Pêche brewed by  Dogfish Head Brewery, this brew has an ABV of 4.5%  This brew pours out a light cloudy yellow color with a small white head. This is an unfiltered brew you can not see though it. The smell is sweet with fruits  and spices. The taste is sour with sweetness.  This brew is different from any brew I have ever had. This brew is bitter sweet. The mouthfeel is bitter sweet.  I like how this brew is different from the rest on the market. Over all I'm giving this brew a 3.75 out 5. Not the best but not the worst. If you are looking for something different try Festina Pêche - Dogfish Head Brewery"
""
""
" Overall a 4 for Festina Pêche - Dogfish Head Brewery. I really enjoyed the diversion of sweet wheat brew for this sour one. I may pick this brew up again."
""
"Poured a hazy yellow color with a nice thick fluffy white head. The head seemed to last quite a long time and left some very nice lacing to the end.  The aroma has a lot of peach up front, with some tartness and wheat notes, and just a touch of yeasty funk.  The taste was nice peachy tartness, with just a hint of sweetness in the finish. The mouthfeel was pretty light, but in a very nice way, as it combined with the carbonation to really set the flavors off. Overall, I really like this beer, very refreshing after a workout, and very sessionable. Nice job DFH."

"Light, saison-like taste, with subtle hints of fruit, and layered flavors.  Beer has a light sour finish.  Low alcohol content adds to the beer's high drinkability."

""

"Delicious. Lighter on the tartness, but the peaches come through. Crisp, dry finish. Could use a bit more carbonation. Great spring/summyer brew."

"Decided to try this after getting tired of ever hoppier IPA (which I love, but hey, gott go the other way sometimes). I was impressed by the relative lack of sweetness; it is flavorful, and redolent of peaches, but refreshing and tart. has a very clean finish too, and is an attractive orange-yellow. Head is pretty minimal and carbonation pretty high. A very pleasant surprise!"

"O: good sour. I don't pick up on the peach. Crisp. Would definitely buy again."

"Interesting peach weissbeer. Color is very pale and slight;ly cloudy with constant bubbles rising. Aroma is light and peachy. Taste is pretty interesting, lots of carbonation, tart peach and a hint of sweetness. Also, the wheat flavor is there. Overall, very refreshing and tangy."

""

"It pours a hazy gold with very little head.  It has an interesting and sour aroma of peaches and a hint of apple, overall a weak fruity aroma. The aroma resembled more of a hard cider rather than an ale. There were a few flavors that managed to surface through the overpowering sourness. There was not as much peach flavor as expected but there was a very acidic apple flavor.  There were flavors resembling that of a sparkling white wine. Overall, I was not too pleased with this beer but it will please palates fond of sour flavors and hard ciders."

"Overall- A great example of the style. The peach taste was quite flavorful. Nice example of the Berliner Weissbier style. Another stellar seasonal by DFH."
""
"I actually had to throw this beer away. First time that has ever happened. No Peach aroma at all, and so sour it was undrinkable. Maybe i got a bad batch but I am super disappointed."
""
"On tap at Rattle n Hum, NYC. Found myself swinging at a curve ball here. Having tried a number of summertime peach brews with a favorable impression I had nothing but great expectations fron DFH, but low & behold I was pretty disappointed. Listed as Weisseer I figured there would be a hint of dry or citrus but all I got was a medium body rather bland beer with a syrupy overlay on the tongue More contrived than complex. Neither refreshing nor bright. I'll stick to the North Carolina guys for this style next time."

"Pale golden hued with a fingernail of eggshell white foam.  Hazy complexion is present.  Perfume sweetness of peaches is a touch too sweet for my nose.  The flavor is extremely sweet almost to the point of being cloying.  This is like a peach candy.  I bet this would be more appealing with a scoop or two of vanilla ice cream.  The mouth is slightly sticky and mildly carbonated."

"O: This was a different type of beer than I am use to , but it wasn't terrible, lots of flavors. A refreshing brew and well balanced as well."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Very nice, the appearance was a light hazy yellow with a thin fizzy head. The smell was full of peach and sour notes. The taste was full of sour flavors that balanced well with the sweetness from the peach as well as the bitterness from the hops and malt. A nice light mouthfeel finishes the beer off very well. For those who love a bit of sweet and sour."
""
""
""
"This is a very bubbly and fruity beer. Fairly low in abv in comparison to many Dogfish Head brews. This is more like a simplistic champaign, offering lovely peach notes and carbonation. Great in a fat tulip glass or perhaps even a flute. It's extremely tasty and bold in color."
""
""
""

"Probably the ""ne plus ultra"" of fruit beers. A category I usually dislike on account of the oft sickly sweetness, Sam Caligione gets it right, letting the yeast eat up all the residual sugars and leaving behind just the flavor, not the sweet. Tart like a lambic, but without the Brett funk. I can see why some beer drinkers might balk - its not really ""beery"" and reads more like a dry Cava on the palate. Crazy good with seafood, especially shellfish. Great with a plate of raw oysters and a lobster roll. Used a bottle to steam some mussels and clams - awesome. A knockout, if not the most beery of beers."

"Poured into a tulip. Thin white head dissipates almost immediately, very thin lacing clings to the glass. Straw yellow and slightly cloudy. Aroma is sour apples with wild yeast dominant. The tart yeast profile is predominant in the flavor with very little fruit noticeable until the sip is gone. Really mellow peach aftertaste combined with the residual sweetnees gives this more of a tangerine and clementine flavor than peach. Very drinkable but I'd like to have a version of this where the fruit shines more and isn't so muted by the yeast. I'm a huge fan of wild yeast in beers but I expected more fruit intensity even for a Berliner Weisse"
""
""

"For a fruit beer it's very good. Well balanced and refreshing."

"O. An excellent Berliner. It doesn't have quite the body the standard Berliners do, with the sweet, sugary peach notes dominating. It's also not quite as tart as the more modern examples of the style. What it is, though, is well-made, closer to the classic style than most examples these days. While I definitely would have enjoyed a bit more graininess, this beer is refreshing and delicious. There aren't enough Berliners today, in my opinion. Festina Peche demonstrates why brewers should visit this style more often. Outstanding brew here."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- not bitter and not sweet slightly sour. Another great beer from the best brewery in the US. I would drink many of these on a hot summer day."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: 3.75 Definitely an interesting and fun beer for summer. Not something I would feel the need to hunt down, but it’s refreshing and tasty. Some more tartness and carbonation would take this beer from good to great."
""
""
""
""
"Considering not many folks make this style. The peaches are subtle and are not boozy or cloying. Think the pulp at the pit pf a peach. This is the perfect beer for the heat of the south. At 4.7% you can have a few and not look like the town drunk. This is a widely available berliner. The only berliner i like better is new glarus out of wisco."

""

"O - I'm a huge fan of peach beers done well and while Festina Peche isn't a knock-your-socks-off peach beer, the light peach nuance behind the classic tart acidity of a Berliner is an amazing combination. This beer is superbly drinkable, especially on a hot day."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Well done brew by DFH here. The peaches certainly dominate but they really fit within the style. Nice malt and yeast notes pull the style through."

"The Wheat character comes through a bit more after each sip. As DogFish Head says, this is a session-sour."

"O - I found this beer hard to drink because it was very carbonated and tart, almost reminded me of a mix between a soda and hard cider. It was very unique to say the least. I couldn't drink more than one, but for its originality I think it is average to good."

"Pleasantly briny, minerally and balanced to perfection with the acidity of dried lemon and lime; the strong lactic acid tanginess of the ale provides the palate with a high rate of refreshment, clean and crisp throughout with brief echoes of peach and wafer-thin wheat in the beer's post-finish era. -perfect for all those hot and hazy days of summer!"

"My beer guru left this one for me as he knows I love sours. A little light looking but a mixed bag, has some haziness, at least initially and pretty fluffy head that did not stick to the glass. Not much to the nose, although I was working outside so maybe allergy limited. Outstanding flavor, got that nice sour touch, but not overwhelming, very clean and smooth. Absolutely perfect after some work in the yard. Overall a very good beer that I am surprised is not getting better ratings. Thanks beer guru, hadn't even heard of this one and I like Dogfish. Will be looking for it in future."

"I'm a big fan of DFH. I've had many of their other beers and am never disappointed, until I came to this beer. It tastes more like cider or sparkling wine than beer. Someone did tell me to mix it with their 90min IPA, so I guess I'll give it another shot."

"Pours a beautiful light gold with just a hint of haze. The head has minor retention after coming out a creamy white. Minor lacing. The aroma is a blend between the traditional wheat beer (yeast, light fruit) and a tart quality. That tart quality comes through loud and clear in the taste, dominating the wheat beer aspects. If you like tart/sour, this one will probably be right up your alley. It does mellow out a little as it breathes. It has a normal weight to the body for the style. All in all, I don't prefer sour beers but this is a well-made example of the style."

"O: not my style, but very well done;"
"O - A light on another approach to fruit beers. The peach offers a delicious counterpoint to the grain and yeast, but sour notes are probably the main flavor element here. Very light on the tongue, it makes for a real contrast to its more syrupy fruit beer counterparts."

"This pours a fairly pale yellow color with a slight, white head. The aroma is mild with a hint of grain and peaches in the mix. The taste is really different than you would expect from the look and aroma. It’s sweet with a decent flavor of grain and peaches. The texture is smooth and light that make for an easy summer drinking brew. Not and big and bold as most Dogfish head beers, but delicious just the same."

"After pouring it in a glass, the clear, faint gold color reminded me of a dessert wine. Texture was on par, color was on par, and very little carbonation was produced. When I tasted it, it was like a carbonated chardonnay. There was hardly any taste of wheat or hops, although some hints lingered. I don't know if DHB is trying to achieve this effect, but for sure Festina Peche doesn't taste like a beer. It is either amazing, or a flop."

"O- There is a high degree of variability on the reviews for this beer. For those who are not acquainted with sour beers, this may be a bit of a shocker. For those well acquainted, this may leave some to be desired. For me personally, I think that DFH nailed this interpretation of a Berliner and am thrilled to drink this beer every time (and I am generally a stout/porter head)"

"Overall/Comments: Wow. I thought this was a really good brew that was very well done as well as being very unique in its flavor profile. I think this would be great, ice cold, on a warm summer day. I suggest trying this one!! Classified as a Berliner Weissbier @ 4.5%. Consumed 6/20/2013."

"O- My friend gave this to me insisting that this year's Festina was the best thus far and I gotta say I agree. While this still isn't my idea of a fantastic Berliner Weisse, they really got the peach flavor to shine this time around. Still lacks carbonation and the complexity of a sour but it's perfect to introduce someone to the concept of sourness in beer. Maybe one day they'll figure out how to make it as good as one of J Wakefield's Berliners."

"I don't know why this isn't in the fruit-flavoured beer category, but whatever. Either way, it's biggest problem is carbonation. It's way over-carbonated. So over-carbonated that it gets too foamy for the refreshing fruity characters to do their job. It's hard to call foam refreshing. Otherwise, I think it's really great. I'm not often into these kinds of things, but this is decent. For fruit beers, I like Shiner's prickly pear beer better, but this beats the hell out of New Belgium's attempt at frambozen bier. I like how the dry character does not detract from the peachiness and how the peachiness goes well with this sour beer with a slightly biscuity backbone. It's a good alternative to fruit flavoured beers that have more of a sweet, yeasty backbone."

"Maybe not the best choice for my first review since I've never had anything like it, but this is a very interesting beer, will have to try more of the style to get more of a feel for it. Didn't knock me out of my seat however. Perhaps I will try it again next summer because it seems like a very nice summer beer; this was on clearance for the end of the season and had caught my eye a few times before so I figured I'd get it before it's gone."

"O: I enjoyed this but I don't see myself adding it to the regular lineup"
"This is one of my favorite summer beers. It's a super easy drinking beer that you can enjoy on a porch in the heat or on the beach. On a boat. Anywhere, really, where it's warm and, preferably, sandy. I think you have to look at it that way in order to appreciate it. It's not going to warm you up in the winter or fill you up like a stout. That's not what this beer was intended to do and it makes no bones about it."

"The Festina Peche poured a hazy golden yellow with a slight white head. The aroma was bready and malty with a slight tartness and bit of peach. The taste started with a light tartness up front that gives way to ripe peach flavors that has a surprisingly dry finish. The wheat beer flavors were subtle but came through on the end and lingered on my palate. The Festina Peche is not an overly sweet beer but the peach adds a subtle sweetness to this sour beer. Overall the it was a good Berliner Weisse that highlights and is accentuated by the peach flavors."

"12 ounce bottle into signature pint glass, Spring 2013 bottling. Pours lightly hazy pale golden color with a 1-2 finger fairly dense white head with solid retention, that reduces to a thin lace cap that lingers. Light spotty lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of big peach, pear, tart lemon, apple, floral, grass, wheat, light bread, pepper, and floral/yeast earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance and complexity of peach with tart/fruity/spicy yeast ester notes; and solid strength. Taste of peach, pear, lemon, apple, floral, grass, pepper, wheat, light bread, and floral/yeast earthiness. Light fruity tartness on the finish; with lingering notes of peach, light fruits, floral, grass, pepper, wheat, light bread, and earthiness on the finish for a short bit. Nice balance and complexity of peach concentrate with malt and yeast flavors; with zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and light bodied; with a very smooth, crisp, and fairly prickly mouthfeel this is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with zero warming noticed after the finish as expected of 4.5%. Overall this is a nice flavored Berliner weisse style. Nice balance of flavors with solid robustness; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A nicely enjoyable and very session-able offering."

"Tried this based on a recommendation from the beer store employee. I won't be doing that again. The appearance on the pour was fine. Everything went down hill and fast at the smell. Needless to say it smelled like vomit and literally tasted like it. To be fair I had the girlfriend and an unsuspecting neighbor try it to validate my opinion (the neighbor was compensated for the agony), consensus was the same all the way around. Save your money and appetite, try something else."

"Dogfish Head Festina Pêche ---4/5."

""

""
""
""

"I was confused when I saw on Beer advocate that the style is Berliner Weissbier. I've had a Berliner and this was nothing like it. Dogfish's Festina Peche is well crafted, but not necessarily something I'm going to seek out specifically because of the sour taste."
""
""
"O-not as tart as I would like for a Berliner Weisse, peach flavor is nice though"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, not bad, but not something I would seek out again. Too fizzy, and too much peach. The sweetness from the peach detracts a bit from the tartness. Yes, that is the point, but not to my preference."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This is probably not the best example of a Berliner Weiss, but it's an overall enjoyable experience. This is one of the few peach beers I have had that were not cloyingly sweet, the balance between tart and sweet flavors is just right. I would also claim that this is a great beer for introducing people to the style, and perhaps one that can satisfy a staunch wine drinker."
""

"Overall- A fruit ale that doesn't skimp on peach flavour. Refreshing and crisp. Perfect compliment for the summer season."

""
""
""
""
""
""
"This isn't a bad Berliner. I enjoy the aggressive maltiness. There's decent tartness, and the peach is subtle but pleasant. This enters my very tiny list of Dogfish Head biers I actually thought tasted good (and weren't just interesting ideas)."

"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a 14 oz ""pint"" glass. Pours a greenish yellow, pretty translucent, with a small white head. Smells of peach with very slight grain. Tastes of peaches, but not fresh ones, more like canned ones, with fizzy water. Beer is light bodied and goes down smooth with heavy carbonation. Overall, a slightly above average beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel has a big carbonation typical for the style. Big sticky body from the malt and sour."
""
""
"O-Just not my thing."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I'm not sure why I'm not digging this - it has the fruit-forward tartness I like from a good sour, without the ridiculous price point. I don't know, this one doesn't come together the way I wanted it to. My first sampling of the style, and it won't be my last. This one, though, I don't need to have again."
"Taste - like pilsner malt with tart peach... Finishes like yeast. Not a fan, overall a very poor beer..."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: It seems like this used to be a lot better. There’s not much fruit flavor and that doesn’t help the acidity. Not too bad, but very average."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a slightly hazy yellow color like fresh cut hay. Head is white and about a thumb’s width. There’s hardly any lacing and it smells strongly of peaches - very sweet and musty smelling. There’s also some wheat and funky aromas in there as well. The taste is tart at first, then predominantly peachy. The tartness level is not very strong but it’s enough, I think. It’s a lot less funky than the aroma and is very refreshing. Overall it’s an interesting take on a Berliner and a pretty successful one."
""
"Poured from 12 oz bottle into my jester king snifter. This is a good looking beer. Very fizzy translucent gold. Aroma is tart peach and biscuit. Taste is disappointing. Very thin with an unpleasant aftertaste. The poach flavor tastes almost fake. Beer is dry, but needs more tartness to cut through the underwhelming old bread finish. The look and mouthfeel are above average."
""
""

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured out a 32oz growler into my BHB tulip glass. Pours a nice clean yellow color, fizzy white head that is gone fairly quickly. Smell is clean, some sour notes but not a ton of peach on the nose. Flavor is very tart, sour nice. Not a ton of peach flavor coming through but I kind of welcome the subtle nature of it... Once the sour flavors back off there is a really biscuit tone to the finish of the beer. I really like this tart, refreshing great finish."
""
""
"Not as tart or dry as some, and a bit heavy and hot for the style, but a great departure from the usual styles, and pretty refreshing."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Flavor is a little more peach than expected, but pretty good as a whole."
"O: Pretty nice and refreshing. A bit more tartness (like that in Perennial's peach berliner) would bring it up, but I don't mind this at all."
""
""
""
"Sometimes I enjoy DFH beers which are different, but not great. This beer is great. I look forward to it every year and find it to be damn refreshing on a hot summer day."

"I wouldn't go out of your way to seek this one out."

"What a fantastic pour. The effervescent nature of Festina is the first thing that caught my senses. It had a longer than average burst of carbonation, looking more like champagne than beer. The head was a fantastic 2 fingers of white clouds. It was difficult for me to discern any peach in the aroma. Although, I did find peach and a citrus punch with my first sip. This is an easy drinker, not very bitter at all, with a lingering semi-sour finish. The peach flavor definitely comes to life at the end. Wine enthusiasts would love this one. On a side note: my wife just had a sip and her entire face puckered up. She's not a fan of anything sour."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a wonderful summer beer, but perhaps not the one for you if you're looking for something with a bit of a pucker factor. Still highly refreshing and drinkable. I'll look forward to my second bottle."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"With nothing to base the beer on for the style, I'm left with my own personal tastes. It's defiintely good, and interesting. The peach is a little much at times, almost cloying, but I gather that is sort of how it's supposed to be. So I guess that's good. Do I like it? sure! Do I love it? Nah. Will I try more Berliner Weiss? Absolutely. Great hot day beer."

""
""
""
""
"Almost a mild Sour beer with a good acidity. Peach was at a perfect level. Enjoyable."
""
""
"Overall, despite the poor appearance, it's a very nice summer beer."
""
""
"Overall - For what it is, it delivers, and it probably delivers better than most others of this style, but this is not one that I would personally seek out again."
""
""
"O: I think this might be my first berliner weissbier. Interesting, definitely a nice summer beer. Another good one from DFH. I think it might be my favorite of their seasonals."

""
""

"This is an exuberant drink. It's not explosive in it's fruit character but it is clean and tart. The fruit did sweeten as the beer warmed but not to the measure of an IPA. The strong wheat based malt character gave enough bread to create a balance you could literally observe. I would call it a liberated taste."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-This is a fairly simple, but decent-tasting summer beer. I could have used a little more Berliner Weiss tartness to offset the sweet peach flavor, but this brew is not syrupy or cloying. The light body and chunky carbonation make for easy drinkability and solid refreshment. Fruit beers aren't always my thing, but this is not a bad effort."

"The smell is of a dry peach, and it almost looks like a champagne with the light color and little bubbles. The beer has a forward flavor of a sour peach followed up by a pilsner malt (aside: I don't think that's the style of it, but has that note). The mouthfeel is odd, both thick and thin but overall worth a try for a neat summer experience."
""
""
""
""
"Simply put, this was basically a cider to me. From the color to the taste, was not impressed with this ""beer"" at all. The smell was the best part of this, even that was slightly underwhelming. The first beer from DFH I can say I will not try again."

"135 Calories, 4.5% ABV. Peach fruit flavor and aftertaste is a good level under this category. I enjoyed trying something out of the ordinary. The price is a bit much though at only 4 bottles for $9. This is a seasonal beer and worth a try but not one I would list on my top 10: which is determined by taste, ABV, and cost."
""
""
"The pour was interesting. When done pouring it almost reminded me of a champaign with the carbonation streaming up from the botom of the taster glass with no head what so ever. The aroma to me was almost bready with a slight hint of peach. The taste was more like a very dry peach cider. I wasn't a big fan at all and think DFH missed the mark. But kudo's for trying."

"Lightly tart and dry on the tongue, this beer just comes together very nicely altogether. Creamy and consistently crisp with a flowing smoothness underneath before upping the dryness a touch into the finish, the feel is surprisingly good."

"Pours like a light wit beer. Decent white head and looks pretty fizzy. You can smell the peach instantly along with a sort of musty smell. Tastes refreshing and goes down easy. It does have almost a Chardonnay tangy finish which I'm not wild about but it doesn't ruin it. I'm not a fruit in the beer type drinker but on a hot day I'd reach for this over a peach tea. The ABV is great, since it doesn't eat up much beer credits. I can't see having this regularly, but it might be something I offer at bbqs in the summer. Not bad."

"Appearance is reminiscent of white wine with a stark white head that retained longer than expected. This offering is effervescent with a body more wine-like than beer-like. The peaches are distinctly present in the nose and flavor profile. The sour peach taste is refreshing and light, but distinct as well. This beer delivers on its promise and is a good example of style."

"Poured this Berliner Weissbier from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. This ale poured a hazy yellow color, produced an average white head, featured nice retention, just a little lacing left on the glass. The aroma of this ale was very nice, bursting with fresh peach nectar, some suggestions of malted wheat. Medium bodied, this ale features a baseline of malted wheat, that gives way to a sour peach nectar, and Granny Smith Apples. The favorite part of this beer, for me, is the sour bite you get about midway through, that sour bite gives way to a dry finish that leaves you ready for the next sip. Very nice session beer, would be a great summer beer- Thanks Dogfish, another winner! Prost!"

""
""
"O- I had this beer once at the brewery and really enjoyed it, it seems that some time in the bottle has made this seem a little less bright and refreshing but it still holds a lot of juicy peach flavors."
""
""
""
""
""
"A nice warm-weather type beer, crisp and refreshing. Although, my problem is a slightly medicinal and chalkiness that I prefer to not have in my beers. Good tartness and sweetness throughout, although the peach flavoring can come of as impure or contrived. Still decent, though."

"I could see drinking a few of these on a hot day for a change of pace."

Also, like I said, being highly drinkable you could have a whole 4 pack in a single session, after a good meal or just to cool down in a hot afternoon (it's entirely possible thanks to its low IBU and lower ABV)."

"When visiting a Dogfish Head Alehouse, I was given the recommendation to mix the Festina Peche with their 90 Minute IPA. This is perhaps the wisest thing I have ever done, and my wife greatly appreciated it. For most people that do not drink a lot of IPA, they are turned off by the ""excessive"" hop taste (Being from Seattle, I do not think there is a such thing). With mixing in the Festina Peche, it cut away at the ""excessive hop flavor"" without taking away from the essence of the IPA. It was easy on the palette yet went down like an IPA. I liked it so much I got a growler filled with 2/3 90 Minute IPA and 1/3 Festina Peche."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Crisp tart flavors push the profile over the safety line of common summer brews and I'm glad for it."
""
""
""
""
"Overall a great beer. I think peach is my favorite fruit flavor for a beer and this beer has inspired me to try some peach lambics. Just a great summertime brew! Gracias Dogfish!"
""
""
"I'm not too familiar with the Berliner Weissbier style. I'm a big fan of lambics, oud bruins and the like. I didn't find it quite as refreshing as other reviewers."

"O - Not a beer I'd seek out again. There ar eother peach flavored beers I prefer more (RJ Rockers Son of the Peach and CCB Peach Jai-Alai)."
""

""
""
""
"I poured this oddball brew into my tumbler at 45 degrees and watched a big white creamy head appear. Then I watched the big white creamy head go away! The beer was cloudy unfiltered looking and very blond. Extreme sour peach taste blows the taste buds away, but not really in a bad way. It certainly is different and I'm sure that was the intent. Pretty decent for a taste chance on a hot summer day. Make sure the beer is colder than 45."
""
""
""
""
"O: Very refreshing on a warm afternoon. Easy drinking. The peach aroma is good."
"O - good beer, but for the price and it being dfh, a little annoying"
""
""
"Lightly haze pale blonde colour, one finger of white head with some lace. Smell is heavy on sweet peaches, a bit like a fuzzy peach gummy with some lemon, malts and acidic apple notes. Taste is quite peachy and lightly tart, some fruity apple and lemon flavours, a little malty-straw points with more peach in finish. Medium carbonation, light-medium body nice mouthfeel. Not bad and fairly easy drinking but that being said one was good for me, while something I could drink I probably wont be buying much of this."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall- Well marketed to the American Summer crowd, but it's not really working for me, although Berliner weissbers aren't generally my cup of tea, so take my rating with a grain of salt. Not particularly light or refreshing, and I'm not getting much peach, although I applaud DFH for trying. Perhaps I'm spoiled by Jester King's Bonnie the Rare."

""
""
""
""
""
""
"O – This is a really good beer. It’s an awesome introduction to Berliner weissbiers. It is perfectly tart and not overwhelmingly sour at all. Very tasty, drinkable, and refreshing. Perfect for the summer."
"This pours a very bright, very light gold color with a creamy half-inch head. Peaches come through very clearly in the nose--with nothing else detectable. Flavor is very nice though! I am very happy it's not overly sweet. In fact, despite the pear flavor, there's no accompanying sweetness really. It's very well-attenuated with a nice lactic tartness. A really delightfully refreshing beer."

"Tastes of the same fruit, malt beverage of the type. Very nice flavor of peach with a tart hit and then dries. Juicy. My second try of this beverage. I like it better this time.  Fine line between fruit and vinegar if you can imagine. But I dig. "

"I poured this one into a tall pint glass. It has a pale straw color body with no head or lace to it. The smell is of nice peach and wheat. The taste is a blast of tartness first then the peach flavor comes in. It has a dry finish to it,almost like a white wine. Its mouth feel is a little rough on the tonuge with a little bit of a after taste on the tongue. Overall this is a really good beer."
""
"O: Tasty, although best enjoyed when paired with cheese and crackers (like you would with a dry white wine), rather than consumed on its own; for unpaired consumption, it is just a little too tart. But since I am a big cheese fan, I will be picking up a few more bottles, the next chance I get..."

"Review from 8/2010 notes. Poured into a Gulden Draak tulip. Pours a light orange/straw amber. Light fruit and wheat aroma. Sour up front phasing into an acidic wheat flavor. Wheat and light peach flavors in the middle. Ends tart. Interesting and somewhat refreshing, but too sour for me, although true to style"

"Fizzy yellow pour but not a regular fizzy type beer. Upon closer inspection there is some cloudiness in the appearance vs what you might see from other beers of similar color. Smell is light, citrusy and not your typical DFH beer. Great change of pace and perfect for summer sessions - low ABV, crisp, purposely slight sour, and definite peach on the backend. Should be very well respected for the combination of taste yet no compromise on ingredients."

"I can not say I am a guru of Berliner Weissbier since this is literally the only one in Texas I can get my hands on, but what I have had is plenty of sours in general. This beer is not as over the top in sourness as you see a lot. Instead it is mellow, highly refreshing, and fruity. It really almost drinks like a soda, highly addicting. The peach definately adds a nice balanced flavor to it."
"O: a great summer time brew, refreshing and perfect for beating the heat. Well rounded and lightly tart, this delicious peachiness could be just what the doctor ordered on a 90+ summer day."

"Pours a slightly hazy, golden/lime/yellow colour with fluffy white head. Tastes of peach up front, with some slight lemon and bready malts coming through in the finish. Didn't find this to be that sour overall. Very nice mouthfeel and an insane sessionable beer. Glad I have two bottles of this left."
""
"Overall: Not to familiar with the style, but this is great for summer like the bottle says. The peach juice adds some nice distinct characterisitcs to the beer."
""
""
"A refreshing, sessionable beer for a hot day."
"Dogfish Head takes a very under appreciated style from Germany and puts their own unique stamp on it; The naturally tart Berliner Weissbier style is traditionally sweetened in the bar with woodruff or raspberry syrup, so Dogfish saves you the trouble and ferments the beer with peach juice. I personally wish it was a bit more tart and sour, but the beer definitely serves it's purpose of being a perfectly refreshing summer drink. Recommended anyone who wants to try a summer seasonal that definitely separates itself from the trite myriad of summer beers."
""
""
""
"The first time I had this I didn't know it was a sour and thought it was an awful beer. It's funny what expectations can do to you senses, I thought of a summer peach wheat thing and was disappointed. Fast forward a few years I've learned what sours are, learned to love them and learned to read the description now I look forward to getting a pack or two of this beer when it's released."
""

"Taste follows the smell. Peach is heavy and tartness is pronounced. Tartness mellows toward the end and finishes more sweet peach. Mouth feel is very crisp and fruity. Very refreshing and light on the tongue. A very good fruit beer."
"Pours a cloudy, pale, pale yellow with a fizzy white head. Looks like a white beer. Aromas are funky, peachy, wheaty, grassy, herbal. Tastes are sour, grape, peach, wheat,crab apple, and super tart, especially on the finish. Body is light with extra carbonation. Finishes crisp, tart, and dry. Overall, not one I'd go back to for a third time, but it was good to go back to it and realize it wasn't as bad as I initially thought it was. It's definitely a love it or hate it beer."
""
""
""
""
"A hazy sandy color with a white head. An aroma of some peach, wheat, and hay. Flavor followed suit with some tartness, some sweetness from the peach and some funky hay/earthiness in the finish. A crisp mouthfeel. Overall, I quite enjoyed this one. I tend to not be much of a fan of Dogfish Head's offerings but I definitely was a fan of this one. Would happily drink again."
""
""
"O - This is one of the better beers of this style that I have yet to sample but I still cannot quite get behind it. Other beers simply offer more ""beer-like"" flavor in my opinion. For a lover of peaches (regardless of their beer palette) this is one they are destined to try."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel: Lighter body with fizzy tickling carbonation. Drying finish, peach tartness throughout. It's nothing over the top nor does it have much complexity but it's unique and that's what DFH does. Checked old reviews. First time I've tried since the '08 batch, which I apparently wasn't a big fan of."
""
""
"O: A very good beer, and one I'll most definitely seek out again. Given low ABV, light tart taste and nice mouth feel, I could easily see buying a 4 pack of these for a long hot summer afternoon session. My first DFH experience, and a very good one."
""
""
""
""
"12 oz bottle. Pours golden with a short lived white head and Champaign like carbonation. Aroma is of peach, wheat malt some funky yeast. Body is medium and very acidic. Taste is very sour, yeast peach and pale malt. Long, acidic finish. Tough to drink without a syrup."
"O - Great session beer for a hot day. The sweet fruit flavor would make this great with a chopped or grilled chicken salad maybe even a ricotta cheesecake. Will definitely have it again when I can."
""
"Smells like wet grass, tastes like sorrel. Know what sorrel tastes like? Yep, SweeTarts©."
""
""
"O: Tastes like alcoholic peach soda. I love peaches, but this is a little too weird for me."
"Usually not a fan of this style, but DFH saves the style for me. Pours a slightly cloudy yellow with creamy white head. Aroma of sour lemons, wheat, some peach sweetness. The peaches come out nicely in this to balance out the sour flavor but do not overpower or make it syrupy. Flavor is sweet and sour, with light body and medium high carbonation. Easy to drink, and would go nicely on a summer day."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel / Drinkability - Perfectly sour and delightfully fresh. I've had this beer a couple of times, but this is the freshest bottle I believe I've had. The peaches are truly fresh and delicious. Active carbonation all throughout."
""
""
""
"O - I must admit I went into this beer prepared not to like it. I also must admit that I was wrong. For a style that just doesnt bring much to the table, DFH did this one right. Easy drinking, very summer friendly and with a nice taste to boot. I think this will find its place in my ""damn its hot and I'm thirsty"" rotation. Well done."
""
""
""
""
"M: Light bodied and refreshing."
""
""
""

"Not exactly my favorite style, but I can appreciate this one and certainly recommend it to those looking for a lighter, different style on a summer afternoon."
""
""
"I guess I was just expecting something with a little more flavor and kick. Overall I'm glad I tried it, but wouldn't go out of my way. There are much better things to try this summer."
""
""
""
""
"O: Great beer! I am not familar with Berliner Weissbier (this is my second one) and I kind of like it. Perfect summer drink, imo."
""
""
""
""
"O/D-This beer does not get the credit it deserves. I would say I only like one of every five or six Dogfish Head beers I try. This is undoubtedly one of their best offerings in my opinion. Natural peach flavors and even some decent tartness. This is easily a top-3 DFH beer by far for me."
"All in all, not the best offering for DFH, but still a nice creative effort. I wouldn't go out of my way to track it down again, but definitely wouldn't say no to a glass!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Highly sessionable at 4.5% ABV, this is a very refreshing summer beer, that I'm glad I got to try."
""
""
"overall, not the biggest fan of this one. it isn't bad, just doesn't do an awful lot for me - somewhat ho-hum. so while there are worse things to drink, it's not one i'll be seeking out again."
""
"Overall – It was a pretty good easier drinking Berliner Weisse that is very nice for the summer months when you are looking for something sour and tart."
"O - One of the perfect summer beers. It manages to be light yet very flavorful. It really amazes me as to how much Dogfish Head packs into this beer. It is uses the peach well to make this an approachable Berliner and beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Not the best peach beer I have had but definitely a thirst quencher factoring in this scorching heat this summer has started with. Have a glass on me, Salud!"
"O: A nice and refreshing summer beer from dogfish head that's a little bit different but still very good."
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a very fine brew, one of DFHs best, imo. Refreshing and perfect for a 100+ degree day."

"This beer pleasantly surprises me. I feared the peach overwhelming the other elements of the beer, but it is pretty well balanced and the peach is present, but not dominant."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A very nice beer on a hot day and one of my first of this style. I'd like to try out some more and this is definitely a beer worth trying."
"Poured a foggy, yeasty pale gold with lots of head. Smell was slightly pungent and at the same time dry and a little fruity. Taste was very light peach flavor, dry and not bitter, with a softly sour finish. I expected more on the fruit, but it was very faint for me. Not a big sour fan, so my score is on the low side. Mouthfeel was great, but this was a one and done for me. Thanks to my local store manager I only bought a single bottle."
""
"O - a very tasty, low abv fruit beer. Definitely worth having again..."
""
""
""
""
"O- Pretty good. There's more of a lemon yogurt like tartness than peach. It's not very sweet though. I was expecting more peach sweetness. It's a good summer session beer since its relatively light and low ABV. The thing about Dogfish is that for the price I'm paying ($10 and change for a 4 pack!) it should be more memorable. Still pretty good."
"O: Overall it was pretty good. It has the light body you'd expect from a Berliner Weiss, but the beer is too ""safe"" on the palate."
""
"overall, this is a decent summer beer. refreshing, subtle in flavor, fruity, tangy, perfect for a hot day. if you're expecting something like aprihop, don't. this is very subtle, and not hoppy."
""
""
""
""
""
"I'm surprised this beer is so lowly rated. After all Sam has his face on every beer magazine and even a (now cancelled) nationally sindicated show. Doesn't that make the beer rate higher? Nonetheless the beer is still very enjoyable. It had subtle sour and subtle peach flavors. I didn't pick up much Berliner Weiss-esqu yeastiness but I found this beer thirst-quenching on a hot day."
"A summer 'go-to' beer. Can be consumed by the case. Perfect for day-drinking. Finishing up my glass before 4:30pm. A perennial classic and one of best from DFH. Cheers!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is an odd beer for me. It's not great when held up against other beers of the style but it's very enjoyable. It seems to be more of a tart pale ale than a Berliner Weisse. Very nice summer beer."
""
"Overall, a different but enjoyable beer. Not sure it is something I would drink all the time but it is refreshing in hot weather and a nice alternative to typical wheat beers."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Not as tart/sour as many of the other beers in this style, the peach really helps to balance that out. Still it is a good example of an easily accessible Berliner Weissbier. I find this beer especially easy to drink on hot summer days and it is quite refreshing."
"Taste is of wheaty malty peach. Its refreshing, light and nice tasting. One of the best fruity berliner weissbiers I have ver had. One or two is good, but I cant do much more. Nice summer brew though."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The infusion of peach flavor into a berlinerweiss works well, as the peach flavor complements the tartness very nicely."

"#BOTG 70! A new beer available to Houston (don't think we have gotten this in bottle form before) now on shelves. Poured from bottle into DFH snifter. Pours a really light yellow/orange color. Some cloudiness, but the carbonation is streaming up from the bottom. Looks really effervescent. Not much head. This is DFH's take on a berliner weiss as far as I know. Smell- PEACH! Sweet, ripe peach skins, like you had a very fresh peach sitting in the palm of your hand. Taste- nice tart, somewhat sour start, followed by the peach sweetness. Nice dry finish with tight carbonation. This beer is absolutely perfect for a summer day, and a really interesting take on the berliner-weiss style. I would expect nothing less from DFH- always an interesting interpretation and spin on things. I'll buy this a lot this summer if it stays around. Good stuff."
""
""
""
"O - It's very refreshing and drinkable but not quite off-centered enough for me to come back to this one."
""

"O: This to me is not the best beer from Dogfish Head.. It just doesn't hit the spot that I was hoping. This beer is very nice though after working outside all day."
""
""

""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- A true sour...No. A refreshing and superior alternative to the offerings from Macro Lagers...Yes!!! Another well-crafted and exceptional offering from Dogfish Head. Another purchase is in order before the season is exhausted..."
""
"Overall it's an ok beer at best. Again, I got a very sour aspect and that was about the extent of it. Makes a great summer beer: it's an easy drinker."
""
"O: one of the best and most interesting summer beers I have had."
""
""
""
"O: A refreshing beer. I could drink 100 of these on a nice summer day. Peach is about as fruity as I'd care for in a ""real"" beer, but done very well. It is a real fruit flavor and it feels like it fits in with the beer, not like more beers which feel like they've added fruit as an afterthought."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall impressions. While not quite a berliner weisse a damn good offering from DFH."
""
""
""
"love this as a summer seasonal. pours very pale yellow in color with a smallish white head, bubbles rising fast from the bottom of my tulip. smells like white wine, tart and clean, with robust peach notes. flavor is very peachy, but not sweet or anything, very pleasant and drinkable. the malt profile is very light, which makes this very drinkable. the essence of peaches is beautiful in this beer, nothing artificial about it at all. feel is very very dry in the mouth, refreshing though just the same, and effervescently carbonated. this is a very easy drinking beer i wish they would put in 6packs instead of 4packs. always looking for one or two more when i buy this. a really lovely summer beer."
""
"I did review this in 2010 and gave it a 3.73, and after tasting it this year I thought it was better than my old review stated."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - I look forward to this beer every year. The taste is great but the nose is a little too funky for me. It has great peach flavor and is great for grilling or sitting on the deck. Though I think I'll drink the last 3 out of the bottle to lose that nose."
""
""
""
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a tulip glass, 2012 edition. This pours a slightly hazy straw color with a short lived smaller white head. The smells are definitely of peaches, not much else. The feel is medium to light. The taste is pretty good, a little sour which is nice, plenty of peaches, good stuff."
""
"O- I know it's not as tart as other berliners, but I really like this beer and it is a top 5 summer day option for me."
""
""
""
""
"A solid take on the style and definitely deserves to be in the summer rotation."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall I thought that this was a good beer and I thought that it was a good example of the style, I have only had Bell's Oarsmen before so I don't have much experience with the style but this is the first one I have tried that I actually enjoyed, so that speaks for itself. This beer had good drinkability, it was crisp and refreshing, with some interesting flavors to hold my attention, I could drink a couple of these on a warm day outside. What I liked most about this beer was that it was solid all the way around and had no real weak points. What I liked least about this beer was the price, it's a little to pricey to buy a lot of and it won't stay on the shelf long. I might buy another before they are all gone but for the price I might be more interested in something a little darker or stronger, but I do recommend giving this beer a try. This was another good and solid beer from Dogfish Head, they take a lot of risks but it always results in more hits then misses, and while this isn't a beer that I just have to have, it's nice to know that there's no reason to ignore this style just because I had one mediocre experience, good job guys, this is one tasty beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall a nice take on the style. The peach is nice, and its very well done with no negatives."
"Nice, light, refreshing, with great fruit flavor, and good balance, but at a high cost. Perfect for summer but it's a beer I want more than 4 of these sessionable low abv bad boys for 8.99 which affects the score a tad."

"EDIT: This beer was noticeably different when it was issued in 2013. The sweetness was much higher, the funkiness was reduced, and the dry finish wasn't as dry anymore. Consequently I found it to be less refreshing and less interesting overall and while not bad by any means, I knocked the score down a little bit to reflect these changes."

"The beer is certainly quaffable, but does not flow into the wheat category well. Also not particularly fruity (although moreso than some). Absolutely not a Berliner Weissbier. I would drink again, and this is probably my fifth time having this beer, but I would simply tell most folks this is a fruit beer that is slightly tart, not a Berliner Weissbier."

"Overall Impression- Very refreshing Berliner Weiss! The peaches were fun in here but almost gave it too much sweetness. If it wasn't for the nice puckering/good acidity in this one, it wouldn't have been marked so highly by myself. If available in MO, I would keep a fresh 1 or 2 of these in the fridge for the ladies to enjoy (or myself)!"

"O: Good, A- or so, not excellent but certainly one to pick up when its in season."
"""Malt beverage brewed with peach concentrate."""
"O- Great beer."
"Not the greatest Berlinerweisse-style beer out there, for sure, but I find it a good example of the style, and extremely refreshing during the hot days of the summer. The peach puree blends well into the beer, adding flavor while not over-sweetening it."
"Dr: Drinkable and low abv, but also low quality. It's a bankrupt attempt at a bankrupt style. I'd avoid this one, even if you're a hardcore fan of either the brewery or the style."
"O: The smell on this beer is wonderful, but the taste is a bit off. I'd like a bit more juiciness from the peach and a bit more dry and sour. A solid beer, though."
"Overall: I'm glad I tried this one, because I was interested in it. However, I'm glad I got it on tap. I would never pay the price they charge for a 4 pack. This is a tough style to nail and although DFH usually can put down those trickier styles, this one is just a bit uninspired."
"Of all the efforts by Dogfish Head, I believe this is the most disappointing."
"Drink- Its still a new style to me. Flavorful and new. I am a big DFH fan though."
"Slightly cloudy and a very light yellow with a small head, tiny bubbles, receding into a wispy ring with a bit of lacing. Smells like peaches, tastes a little sweet but mostly like sour peaches. Its not musty like Belgian sours, which I think is the reason my girlfriend likes it too. I wish I'd tried this before they switched from fresh peaches to concentrate, but its still a great light refreshing fruity beer."
"O- First of the style for me, have yet to try the traditional style. This is fantastic and refreshing."
"Pours a light golden color, almost like straw/blonde. Wonderful inch of foam sits atop this, with tight, even bubbles. There’s a big peach nose on this, or what I’d imagine peach flowers smell like—much more delicate than peaches, but with its essence preserved. Comes across on the palate as well. Very light, carbonated, almost champagne-like mouthfeel. Refreshing and delicious."
"This is a decent beer, but not Dogfish Head's best offering. Nice to enjoy on a patio."
"O:"
"O- Have always been on the fence when I drink this style. Sometimes I like it, sometimes I'm not a fan. This wasn't bad, nice tart taste but not overpowering. Would have liked some more flavor from the peaches though. Not a bad drink, not sure if I would have to have it again."
"Overall (3.0): Maybe I’m an idiot, but I remember Festina Pêche being much, much tastier in the past. Don’t get me wrong, this is still actually relatively enjoyable, just not what I remember or was expecting. I imagine this is more like what a straight-ahead Berliner Weisse tastes like, but maybe not. Wish there was some more ripe, sweet peach action going on here."
"Try serving it in place of champagne."
"Sour mouth. Awesome beer."
"O-Didn't think I would like it but it was a nice summer beer"
"The appearance was nice with Good head and a slightly cloudy, light yellow colour. The smell I got was Citrus, Peach of coarse and a sourness. I enjoyed the flavour of this beer because there was just hints of fruit and wheat, not an overpowering taste. Sour finish, very refreshing drink on a hot day. I would say it's very good for a fruit beer, me being not a very big fan of those types."
"Overall a good beer from a great brewer. If you're like me and avoided it because it might be too fruity you should try it."
"This is a very sessionable summer beer. I wish I had picked some up at the start of summer."
"O/D - Not bad. A nice tart low ABV beer. The peach flavour is fairly light but works well to compliment the acidity and lift up the flavour. Worth a shot but I wouldn't seek it out."
"O - Overall a decent beer, either a hit or miss. If its in your local market, pick it up, it isn't half bad."
"Poured a cloudy light golden yellow color with quick disappearing head. Smells faintly of peaches... taste sour and tart with a minimal peach flavor. This beer would be way better if the peaches could have shined through just a tad bit more. Goes well with spicy food.. Overall it's not a bad beer.. but i probably wouldn't buy it again."
"O: Great summertime brew. Crisp, while still flavorful. Nice tartness that I really enjoy."
"O- Did not expect a berliner weisse style from this beer. Thought it was different but not really anything I would normally drink."
"O-i've tried this a lot. the first few times, i didn't enjoy it, but for some reason i kept trying it. i'm glad i did because i eventually started to really like this. this is a very tasty and quaffable beer. it sure is thirst quenching!"
"Notes: DFH colored a little bit outside the lines on this one, but that is what they do best. It is a very pleasant beer, and quite creative. What a great idea for a summer seasonal."
"Festina Peche started out pretty well, but then ended on a very weird and funky note. Not the good funk either, but the strange, puckering feeling of biting into a peach that just isn't quite fit for consumption yet. I know DFH has a reputation for pushing the envelope, so I don't think I should take Festina Peche as a yardstick of what a Berliner Weissbier should be."
"overall im just so so on this beer...i mean its nice but i was expecting more sour and more peach"
"Seems like a good midday pick-me-up during the dog days of summer. Low enough in alcohol to be negligible. Quenching and presumably restorative. Enough funk to make things interesting."
"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was the brazen tartness. While it was well within the guidelines of the style, this beer produced flavoring that really made the palate sing, and pucker. The lactic sourness and fruity tartness were, again, appropriate, but effectively took away from the peach character, which would have made a good beer even better, if given the chance."
"i would have never figured a berliner would have over a thousand reviews. thank you dogfish head for making that possible."
"O: I enjoy this one on hot summer nights and I'd like to see what its like aged for a year or so. It is somewhat one-demensional, but and interesting take on a style we don't get much of in the states. Its really easy to drink and I like the sessionability of it. An interesting brew.... just wish the price wasn't so high for a 4.5% beer."
"Overall I guess I don't have the fancy palate of a Gueuze or lambic drinker (one who enjoys Cantillon) to appreciate this. Still I guess it's a cheap offering to those ridiculous offerings so to all who like it enjoy!"
"O - I honestly don't have too much bad to say about this beer. An easy drinking beer, perfect for a summer evening outside. I also don't have any reason to love this beer. Strong showing from DFH, that a wheat beer fan will enjoy."
"Overall - Like a beer version of a bellini. A refreshing, unique summer beer. Will drink this again."
"Pours a slightly hazy straw color with about an inch of pure white, bubbly head. Smells of straw, faint peach, citrus, some sugar, and a slight funk. Honestly, not as much peach as I had hoped for. Tastes of wheat, straw, tart peach, and some lemon. The emphasis is on the peach, and this carries over into the tart, dry finish. Again, I had hoped for more peach, but this is still a good brew. Overall, a refreshing offering that I’d gladly have again, especially in this inescapable summer heat."
"Overall, a good beer and one I would have again."
"Overall: Once again, Dogfish Head impresses with a unique beer full of character. It is a thoroughly enjoyable summer beer and certainly an interesting interpretation of a lesser-known style. My only qualm with it is that the sourness does impede a bit on the beer's drinkability. However, I haven't had many Berliner Weissbiers so this may be on par with the style. Nevertheless, it is a great beer and definitely something worth trying if you can find it."
"I will definitely drink again, a perfect summer evening on the porch type of beer. Reminds me of a cider, but far more interesting and quite dry. A very nice effort from the boys & girls at DFH."
"This brew pours a hazy yellow-white color with a tiny head. The aroma is the weak part, it mostly smells of musty fruits. The taste is much better though, with very tart fruit being the primary flavor. It's also slightly sour, with a bit of graininess on the finish. Very nice. The mouthfeel is nice, it's well-carbonated and goes down easily. The drinkability is very good. Overall, a delicious and very unique brew, it's really not quite a Berliner Weiss, but still worth consuming en-masse."
"Overall: I was sadly disappointed with this beer, but it's nevertheless still Dogfish Head quality brewing. It's more on the sweetened side than the fruity side, and I'm always a larger fan of the latter. Very good for a hot summer day, but otherwise, makes me long to try Berliner weissbiers over in Germany someday."
"I thought this was pretty interesting, it is very true to the style, but I'm not sure this is for me."
"D: It's a poundable session beer, at a not-very-sessionable price. I could only imagine the peach is more pungent as it is super fresh. Simple beer, not bad at all."
"O: This is an extremely unique summer seasonal. It is rather mouth puckering and I feel it could benefit from being a little less tart and having more peach flavors. There is a decent complexity though. The drinkability is unfortunately low for me on this one."
"O: This isn't terrible, but it comes off very messy. Too many aspects of this beer collide to negate flavors and sensations. Some nice light juicy flavors, but they feel contaminated by the pickled flavors. Furthermore, the mouth plays cleanup by drying up the flavors quickly and entirely. The body of a crisp brew, without the crisp clean flavors. Good concept beer, but the concentrated flavors tax this too heavily."
"Served on-tap in a pint glass, the beer pours a slightly hazy, bright, pale yellow color with lots of bubbles and a slight ring of film around the glass. Very light aromas of toasted oats and the slightest hint of peach sweetness. Flavors are light and the carbonation keeps it very crisp. Semi-sour flavor, with very mild fruit highlights. The aftertaste is tangy and sour, and the finish is a little slick and a little sharp. Very interesting brew, and the fruit doesn't overpower like other fruit beers tend to do. Very light and refreshing on a hot day."
"I've never been a fan of the sour beers and this one follows suit. I'm sorry, Dogfish Head, it's just not very good."
"This is a decent Berliner weiss, with the focus on the acidity as it should be. I was expecting a lot more fruit presence. Overall though, its a touch watery and lacking in complexity. Thirst quencher for sure, but nothing out of this world."
"Drinkability: this is a tart malty beer that is perfect for a hot summer day. The mouthfeel is light, clean, and crisp with mild carbonation.  I've had this couple of times this summer and it seems to taste better the hotter the weather. "
"Well, it's better than my initial impression, now that I've had a year more experience and a broader horizon for appreciating sours and fruit beers. For the price point, quite a decent lambic (does it qualify as such?), but the carbonation and bad smell are kind of a turn-off."
"This is a very gentle sour, not very acidic or harsh at all. Makes a good introduction for a friend into the world of sours, later on they can ramp up the pucker and acidity if they feel up for it."
"O: This is my first Berliner Weissbier review so I don't have much to compare it too, but I thoroughly enjoy this. It's basically a lighter, more drinkable version of a peach lambic. I might have to buy some more before this is gone."
"Overall: This beer is definetly not for everyone, it has a nice sour taste but its not a typical sour, its as if they used green peaches to brew this. The flavor feels really artificial. Im not sure I would buy this again. Its definetly different than all the other summer ales I have tried before but not in a good way."
"Overall: Almost like a dry peach champagne. Aroma is great, and I didn't find any off-notes in the flavor. Something seemed to be missing in this one, though. The flavor profile was a tad bit one-dimensional, while the CO2 was probably a bit over the top. Definitely a good, tasty beer, though, so please give it a try to see what you think."
"T: Very smooth and sweet with a lot of peach flavor. A slight wheat taste on the finish. To me, it didn't taste like a berliner weiss as much as it did a lambic or even a cider. The mouthfeel wasn't quite as light as I've come to expect and the beer lacked that delicate tartness. That said, I still enjoyed it a lot."
"O: Well it's no Monk's Flemish Sour ale (yes i know it's a different style), where the tartness is followed by a bit more complexity, but this is still a very enjoyable beer. And it's extremely outside the box. I will probably be purchasing my own pack of this, since this was only a 12oz sample. As far as summer beers go, this was definitely refreshing, literally and figuratively."
"Overall this is very nice. I'd have many of these in one sitting if needed. $2.50 a single is ok considering the nice flavors and high drinkability."
"O: A really great of the style. It actually grows on me a lot. Light and fun. Unlike some other Berliner Weissbiers, the tartness is never overbearing. Recommended. Would drink again."
"O: Definitely not my thing, but like I said, a decent representation of the style. Had a hard time rating, because this is not a style I enjoy. I won't have another, but if you like Berliner weissbiers, might as well go for it."
"Pours a nice yellow with a large white fluffy lasting head. Aroma of sweet peaches, and nice light fruity esters fill the nose. Taste is a sweet, tart and sour combination of flavors, ansd sweet ripe peaches. Plate is a nice medium body, lightly carbonated, with a nice refreshing mouthfeel. Finish is sweet, tart and sour but not overpowering, with ripe peaches and with some light malt on the end. Overall an interesting and well done easy drinking brew."
"O- I enjoyed this beer. It was the first sour I have ever had and thought it was a good summer session beer. Very light and easy drinking."
"O: Overall, this is a beer that makes you scratch your head. Not pleased with the smell, okay appearance but with a unique, interesting sour lemon/mango taste, it is sure to please!"
"Aftertaste is all sour and slightly fruity. This is where the fruit comes out to play. If you can make it through the initial assault, you'll experience what this beer is really all about."
"One of the first DFH beers I wasn't overly impressed with. It tasted like someone poured canned peach juice into an effervescent wit bier. I've had previous iterations of this beer, and this seasons was just...off. Tasted more like a wine cooler than it did a beer. Surprisingly, two cases of this flew out of the fridge at my BBQ yesterday. I'm thinking everyone else enjoyed it far more."
"O: all in all I think this is a good beer, the body and the sourness of it balance nicely, as they battle back and forth in your mouth. Dogfish head has done it again"
"Pours a orange amber with carbonation bubbles rising to the top and very little head. You can immediately detect the peach concentrate in the nose. Taste is sweet up front and tart in the finish. The sweetness from the peach compliments the tartness of this beer nicely. Crisp and well carbonated. I find this to be a nice change of pace for summer brews, but the tartness keeps me from having too many."
"Before now, I think I placed absolute trust in anything that was made by Dogfish Head - thus, I picked it up on blind faith alone. Going to try really hard to forget this beer."
"Final thought - fun to try a bottle but 4? Only of my kids wanted peach juice. But still, lots of flavor and fun to drink. Need to try this guy on tap"
"Let me state right off the bat that I did not like this beer and that it may have been the first Berliner Weissbier I've ever had. After reading the description of the style on this site, I was not at all surprised to find that it almost perfectly described this particular beer. I have to give it reasonably high marks because, based on the description, it seemed like a very good representative of this style. I may revise this review once I've had a chance to try a few others."
"But the taste was awful. Totally sour, very off putting."
"I think I like this beer more every time I try it."
"Different beer from Dogfish Head, definitely worth a try."
"It was a good summer beer, if not at least refreshing, but I can't let the peach thing go!"
"O-I'll have to revisit this beer after I introduce my palate to a few more sour beers. Overall the beer was what they promised but I'm still not convinced they should put Peach in the name."
"There's a bottle of Lindeman's Peche Lambic in the fridge and I'm looking forward to it. I haven't got my peach fix from the Festina."
"Beer pours a very slightly hazy yellow with a vigorous head that disappears quickly. Yeasty, wheat laced aroma in the front, followed by ripe peach. Flavor starts with the maltiness of the wheat followed by a pervasive peach nectar flavor. Very tart, but very refreshing, the tartness is not overpowering in any way. I really like this beer and it is nice to get a summer seasonal that is a little different. Your don't see a ton of berliner weissbiers around and that's too bad, this beer is really refreshing on a warm day."
"O - Overall, this is one of my favorite summer seasonals. Dogfish rarely fails to please."
"O: A decent fruit beer but not too much else speaks for it. Not a real big step up from Magic Hat #9, and that's not saying much."
"Not bad. I like this a little more than I think I did last year, though maybe less than 2 years ago; but memories can be hazy."
"Not the most impressive looking beer in the world: bubbly, yellow, not much head, even less retention...smells like concentrated peach and not much else but hints of wheat...but damn that tartness just makes this beer surprising and super enjoyable. Too much wheat in a beer can sometimes hinder drinkability for me, and this beer does a great job of maintaining a wheat flavor but not letting it take over. The tart fruit is the star of the show here. Refreshing, crisp, and enjoyable - a great summer brew. Thanks DFH."
"Overall a delicious Berliner Weiss bier from Dogfish Head, it packs a lot of taste into a dangerously drinkable 4.5% beer."
"I don't know much better with style like this, but this seems to be status quo from what I gather."
"D- 3 I had much higher hopes for this brew, as I'd previously enjoyed Aprihop and some other DFH seasonals. I suppose I wouldn't have found out without trying it, but I won't buy it again. It may be more appealing to those that like wine or other fruit beers, and could be nice and refreshing for others, but it wasn't my cup of brew."
"Overall: I am not sure I am a big fan. I can see where this might have a niche market, but for the money, refreshment factor, and overall satisfaction, I'll be sticking with Bud Light Limes this summer."
"It's an interesting beer; I like sour beers and food in general, but prefer to have it balanced out with some sweetness. I'd probably really like this beer if I could add some peach syrup or one of the traditional Berliner Weisse syrups to it. As it is, it's a bit rough, although maybe I could get used to it. The price was reasonable, though, for a sour beer."
"Tartness dominates the mouthfeel but leaves a tingle dryness bouncing with flavor - bread and peach - culls a desire for more. A sharp tart bite hits up front giving way to some chewy bread notes and finishes with tart peach - fully covering the whole mouth. There is some sweet bread lingering aftertaste which is quite nice and subtle."
"Thanks to Will (futura123) for this extra."
"Active carbonation meets a rather thin body for a wheat ale. Given the low ABV%, the body size works. Overall, this is a good session fruit beer. It's tart enough to satisfy a sour craving for me, and its 4.5% ABV makes this a great summer drinking candidate. If this were available in my distribution area then I'd be buying it by the case."
"D/O- Appearance was a big turnoff from the start but overall not a bad beer. Would like to try a newer batch sometime."
"o: a pretty decent brew.. very refreshing."
"Overall: Solid beer overall. Nothing spectacular here, but nothing offensive in any way either. I would recommend giving this one a shot. Dogfish Head rarely disappoints."
"Very carbonated although not too much head, very effervescent while sipping."
"O- if sour is an iffy subject this is probably not for you. of my friends with me 3 of the 4 said they couldn't drink a whole glass because of the sour. Terrific flavor and 4.5% abv is perfect for a session. I haven't loved all the other dogfish i've tried but this is a TOTAL winner in my book."
"M: Light bodied, nicely carbonated to help clean the palate. Not much of a lasting impression with this brew, but at an ABV of 4.5%, it is very ""session-like""."
"O: Overall, a decent and refreshing beer. At $10 a 4-pack, it's a bit pricy for a low gravity sessionable beer. Still, lots of tart fruit flavors make it welcome on a hot summer day."
"O- good summer brew. The peach flavor is good but not over the top."
"summer wheat flavor with the peach flavor coming in second but getting stronger with more tastes, …overall I think it is a quality summer beer but lacks some depth and complexity. The peach again doesn't taste authentic, sour is distracting from otherwise quality beer..."
"Taste is tart and sweet with a very nice refreshing bite and the mouthfeel is light and very tasty. Delightful summer beer."
"O- Dogfish Head is usually hit or miss from me. I enjoy a lot of their stuff, but wouldn't have this again."
"O - Not a bad summer beer. Don't know if I would buy it again, I wasn't overly impressed."
"Conclusion: I've had three different ages with this beer. Fresh, last years batch over the spring, and a four year old bottle. I actually really liked it with almost a year on it. It became even tarter and more sour. Fresh is pretty nice too. But four years is just overkill for this beer. Overall, a decent summer offering from DFH thats something different."
"I love the tartness of this beer and the fruit flavor. It is not too overpowering or too sour that it isn't enjoyable. Dogfish can pull this beer off, but I am sure it is not everyone's favorite."
"Pours a soft, pale, golden yellow color with a thin, foamy white head. The aroma has characteristics of apple juice as well as fresh, tart apples, but it veers off beyond being just tart to the point of being a bit musty and sour. The flavor is more appealing, with the tart apple character being complemented by some light wheat, and the peaches add a nice, light, sweet fruitiness. The light and active carbonation further complements this light, sweet/tart flavor. Overall, the earthy wheat, apple-like acidity, and sweet peaches combine to make this beer an interesting and refreshing change-of-pace."
"First time i can say i did not fall in love with a beer from DFH. To me this is way way too sweet, maybe because they used a peach extract. I've never had this before but other told me it is much sweeter than normal, would love to try an older one to see if this is the case. Has a nice yellowish/copper color with a nice peachy smell to it, that didn't completely throw me off when i dove my nose into my dogfish snifter to smell all the fruit. Just can't see anybody drinking more than one of these at a time, i could see splitting a bottle with someone while having a dessert in place of a port. Have 2 bottles left at the house, think that is what i will use them for."
"Overall – The beer seems to fit the description of a Berliner Weissbier quite well. (based both on appearance and taste) It's the kind of beer that I wouldn't want more that one of in a sitting. I'm happy I gave it a shot but I wouldn't seek this one out again."
"O: Not terrible, but not their best work. 3.5"
"A interesting beer, worth watching how it develops over the years."
"O: Overall this is a very nice summer offering, I would like to see how this develops over months and over the years. All around a very nice Berliner Weiss. I have talked to many people on this style from Germany, and they all tell me that Berliner Weiss should be mixed with a splash of Raspberry syrup, but the addition of the peach in this brew comes close to the authentic representation of the classic style."
"Overall this is a nice light fruity change from many of the beers I am used to."
"Definitely worth a try, though."
"I do not have the experience of having had this beer in the past so this is the first batch I have tried. Overall it is a refreshing beer. It fits well with summer time foods and activities. I think it may be a beer you love or will just try and may not try again."
"Overall: A cross between a sahti and a wheat beer."
"Price = $10.99 for a six-pack at Whole Foods"
"M. Very light. Flavor transition has a snap to it, and it is almost watery in places."
"Drink it if you must, but expect something unlike you've ever tasted, and not necessarily in the good way depending on your taste."
"Overall this is a change. Very intersting brew as this is one of the two BW's I've tried. I found it refreshing and interesting however, i wouldn't really go out of my way for another."
"Light mouthfeel that is plesant to drink, especially if you like any sour brews, which I do. Great summer offering and the light abv almost makes this an excellent replacement for lemonade!"
" This is a very tasty beer for those that like peach flavor in their beer. It is refreshing and slightly sweet at first yet not like peach syrup as it begins to have a lactic sour edge and hold until the carbonation starts to seem like a spice combined with the wheat flavor which has a slight toastiness and is gently grainy. I could drink this beer anytime it is refreshing yet full of flavor with so much happening in such a relatively low alcohol wheat. I recommend this to those who enjoy peaches and wheat and sour candy."
"O: Damn good beer for summer or hot weather. Perfect balance of sourness and fruit for the style and although outside of ABV range for B.W. it is something I would definitely drink again! This would be good for someone starting in on sour beers also."
"O: Great and easy summer drinker that goes down nice and easily but has that sourness that keeps you on your toes. A nice mix-up from the usual summer beer"
"O - I enjoy this beer. Very refreshing and great for a summer day. A definate go-to summer beer for me."
"O (D) - a good, easy drinking summer beer. A bit pricey, if I recall correctly, but this is a nice and interesting and refreshing drink."
"Notes - Refreshing, its the name of the game for this beer, and it fufills it to the max. A phenomenal summer seasonal, and I'll probably end up buying a case of this next year as well."
"Worth trying!"
"Nice light feel with crisp carbonation. This one overall isn't bad. I actually remember liking it a lot more before they changed the recipe a bit to tone down the sourness of it. I liked it better two years ago but it's still solid. A few off aromas and off flavors but even with that being said, this is still a some what enjoyable."
"Maybe just not my style."
"2011 batch. Seems to have more acidity than the 2010 batch, but not as much as the 2009 batch. I really enjoyed this beer, the peach juice didn't overpower the beer for me, and the lactic acid they add in the brew kettle was very balanced overall, making it a real easy drinker. The price seems steep for a simple 4.5% ABV beer, but overall I really enjoyed this beer. Just sour enough to not make you think you're drinking a Lindemans Peche."
"Good stuff and very drinkable and fairly light."
"A nice take on a berliner wiesse but with more bready malts and sweetness than I would like, gets heavy in some areas. Tartness and crisp feel were excellent however, definitely worth a try and one of the more unique seasonals out there."
"The color when poured was a hazy wheat yellow with very little foam and some lace on the side of the glass. The smell of acidic citrus was the only aroma that was evident. The taste had a the components of a bitter/sour/acidic/semi-sweet/salty citrus flavor, but, I could'nt taste the peach. In fact, I could'nt taste anyone type of citurs. Not one of their better brews!"
"Thanks Steve!"
"O - This has good drinkability. Overall, I enjoyed this beer. I think it is a nice new twist on what most breweries put out as a summer beer. It is light, refreshing, and they didn't go overboard with the fruit. Also, with it only being 4.5% ABV I could drink these all day. I recommend giving this a try."
"D: a great summer brew. very refreshing outdoors (as well as indoors in my case). buy it by the case."
"Overall: I like this beer a lot and am kind of kicking my self for just getting into it now. I had this on draft a year ago and didn't think much of it. Either that was a bad pour or my palette has really changed."
"M - nice bit of pucking tartness with a (unexpected) semi-dry finish. Not full bodied, of course, but not thin."
"Not knowing anything about this beer, the sourness surprised me. It appealed to my love of sours showing me a style I did not know existed."
"O-I had this last year and was blown away but never reviewed it. Coming back to it a year later, with a much more expanded palate sure changes things. It still tastes interesting. Worth a try but not as good as memory led me to believe."
"Sour is the first taste that comes to mind. Its very tart, like a Sweet-Tart candy, in the front and then syrupy on the back, like a cola. The taste profile is all about the sourness of the peach and lemon flavors. The finish is ultra-dry like champagne, but it has the added sour bite in the aftertaste that makes it different. Its not at all like a traditional beer, but its also not like any beer I've ever had before, and I'm always down to try new styles and beers, especially those by Dogfish. I'm enjoying this more than I expected I would and I'm glad I bought it. Nice summery beer with the dry finish that makes you crave more."
"O: This beer's not bad but its in a style that, in my opinion, should focus more and subtlety and balance, neither of which this possess. Still, very drinkable and quite refreshing. I wouldn't hesitate to reach for it, even though its barely average for its style."
"Well done DFH, a summer beer that is super drinkable with an ABV that won't make you fall over. A pleasant surprise and a beer I will stock for the summer to enjoy on those hot days (and not so hot days)."
"O: A nice thirst quencher and a change from the typical; can’t see drinking more than one or two in a day though."
"Mouthfeel seems fine, maybe a little slicker than other berliners not as dry but good by my standard. Drinks extremely easily but I dont know if I'd have more than one just cause of its fruitiness. No ones drinks cup after cup of OJ (or at least I don't). Definitely an interesting idea by DFH but I'd prolly only buy 2 four packs for the entire summer...tops."
"O- A nice affordable and interesting twist on the Berliner Weissbier style. Definitely very peach forward, a great summer beer. This has amazing drinkablilty."
"Overall: A nice summer beer. Perhaps not the best example of the style, but not bad."
"Overall - I cracked this open at 12:30 PM after a soccer game on a 95+ degree day and man it hit the spot. I don't really care how much flavor is has/doesn't have. It is quenching and refreshing. I plan on drinking a more authentic Berliner Weisse tomorrow and will maybe change my opinion of this beer."
"O: Another interesting beer from Dogfish head. I love how they use different ingredients in their beer. This beer quenches my thirst! I great seasonal beer."
"I didn't really enjoy this one. The peach flavor comes through like peach from concentrate, the color is rather strange (an odd bright orange/yellow), and the bitterness overwhelms the taste of the beer. Perhaps the only thing I really liked was the finish, since the flavor finally blended into a tolerable taste. The labeling was really well done as well :P"
"This is a light refreshing beverage that's good for the summer, and it's probably the only beer with peaches I've ever had. I'm not really sure what to compare it to. It's got a bit more flavor but a lot less sour than a regular Berliner Weisse."
"O: DFH can't do anything simply and I applaud them for it. This is a really nice summer beer but not one I'll want to get more than one more four pack of."
"overall: This is an odd beer for me. It's my third year picking up a 4 pack or 2 in the summer, expecting it to knock my socks off. It doesn't but it's still a good albeit unusual beer."
"One of my favorite summer beers. Great sourness but not over-powering, and great peach flavor. Super sessionable and great for the dog days of summer. Oh, and this years version seems almost identical to last years. Another great job by DFH."
"Really tasty and very drinkable on a mind numbingly hot day like today."
"The appearance is a hazy orange with thin white head that fades fast but leaves sea foam lace. It looks the part for its style. The smell is dominated by peach, a tart lemony citrus, a touch of citrusy hops, and metallic notes. The taste will wake the taste buds up with a tart peach, lemon, citrus domination. Bready and grainy malts in the back. Slight peachy sweetness like a remnant that didn't ferment out. A nicely balanced, tart, sour, but refreshing, crisp, clean beer. Very different as to be expected from Dogfish head."
"O - if you don't enjoy tart things, simply don't try this beer. I bought this because my wife wanted to try it, but I wound up drinking it on this 100 degree day while she was napping. It was refreshing and good, but I don't see how I could ever crave it. Looks like a one-shot deal. I don't see how I can recommend this on hot days with weihenstephaner being such an easy find, but if you want to try I won't stop you."
"O: Very much a one-and-done type refresher for me, but man, this beats lemonade on a scorching hot day any time. The 4.5% ABV means you could drink it all day, but Festina Peche likens itself to a quenching sipper. If you;re not a fan of tart, sour flavors, you might right this brew too poorly. Pop a Pepcid and relax in the sun with this interesting neo-Berliner Weiss."
"Never had Festina Peche, nor a Berliner Weisse before so this was a new experience for me. Only just begun dipping my toes into sour styles and I found this one to be rather tart and puckering."
"Overall I have not had this style before, or a traditional Berliner Weiss say... ""from the old original country"". I would love to try one for comparison but this I think is just one of those things in craft where Sam and company have struck gold. And hell yeah it's nothing like it out of the bottle, it's fantastic on tap."
"The beer pours a pale yellow with a rapidly disappearing head. Slightly cloudy. The beer has a very sour aroma sort of like lemon meringue pie but breadier and not as lemony. If there is any peach profile to this beer it is in the aroma. Even then, one must use imagination to detect it. Taste is very tart. I can only imagine what this beer might have tasted like without the peach extract. The sour finish lingers and finishes clean. Medium high carbonation with some bite on the tongue. Body is light. Texture is acidic. This beer is interesting because it is the first of this style for me. I will drink another, but early in the evening with a light crisp salad perhaps."
"The taste is great. Yogurty and slightly sour. Fantastic control on that. A light, non-distinguished fruit tartness lays in the back. I know it's supposed to be peach, but I don't think it's that distinct. This is quite drinkable and refreshing. I could down this for a long time on a hot day. Gotta love those sours."
"O: Would be great if it was significantly more sour, but is is this is still a good beer. A bit low on the wheat for a berliner weiss. The peach presence is nice but would be much better if there was much more lacto."
"Pours a light golden orange with the smallest hint of haze. Very lively head pours tall but leaves shortly thereafter with no lacing. Nose is milky sour withsimple notes of apricot and peach. Taste is almost creamy with lacto sourness and really just straight peach. Very refreshing with lively carbonation and nice puckering acidity. I had a 2010 about a month ago and found it to be more complex and sour - i look forward to trying this with more age - i realize berliners arent ment to be aged but it seemed to work."
"Into my DFH pint glass on 6.6.11 this pours a clear and faded dirty yellow gold color under a thin film head. Certainly looks crisp and refreshing. Spritzy and tart lemon citrus aroma over a crisp wheat malt backdrop immediately fills the nose. A sharp sweet and sour lemon note hits the tip of the tongue at first and refreshingly glides over the palate with a solid tart feel into a somewhat dry and sticky lemon zesty citrus finish. Ending notes of moderately sour peach and lemon juice seem held back enough by malt character to makes this taste more like a ""Sweetart"" than a ""War Head."""
"The flavor on this is wonderful. At first I got a light peach taste, and then sour when I swishes it around. The aftertaste is a light tart taste. I enjoyed this in a glass outside on a hot summer day. It really is a perfect summer beer and I'm eager to pick up more. Not too boozy so its easy to knock back a few of these at a BBQ."
"I lost track of how many of these I actually consumed, considering that whenever I went back to the bar to get another, the full glass I had on my table was mysteriously half-full by the time I got back. Oh well, I guess my friends liked it too!"
"Overall I would say that the beer is good, I wouldn't run out and stock up on this one but I'm glad that I got the chance to try it and I can't wait to try more sours."
"Overal: I wish the fruitiness came out a bit more as it seemed a little muted for my taste but overall a very refreshing drink and at around 4.5% this is a great summer beer to relax with."
"Overall, kudos to Dogfish Head for putting out a summer beer that is outside the box. Tart, fresh and refreshing. Nice summer brew all around."
"O - Overall an extremely pleasant beer for the good weather. Works well on its own or as a session, given the uncharacteristically low ABV (4.5%) for a DFH brew."
"I didn't know quite what to expect from this one before I tried it, I didn't know whether it would be more beer or cider. It very much comes across like a cider but this is in no way a bad thing, it's extremely drinkable, it's got a big taste and balances the tart and sweet flavours nicely. Would be fantastic for those hot summer days."
"I like it a lot, but the aroma reminds me of what happens when you leave chicken stock in a walk-in cooler for too long. You get this sourness in the nose and maybe I'm just biased and influenced by my past experiences with sour chicken stock, but this reminds me too much of it to be as enjoyable as it could. That being said, I think it's incredibly well balanced and it doesn't tread too closely to being a juicy-sweet fruit beer. Very nice little number."
"O - Again I should have grabbed a bottle with a bottling date that was clearly legiable."
"O: The addition of peaches helps to balance off the sourness associated with this style, much like fruit syrups are added to other Berliner weissbiers to make them more palatable. It’s easy to drink for the style and the low alcohol content makes it very sessionable, if you can handle the light amount of sourness."
"O - Not a big fan of Wild/Sour ales, but I have tried a few (including this on numerous occasions which I feel like I enjoyed more previously). Still enjoyed this beer a bit and tried to rate in comparison with the style and not my personal tastes. Would have gotten a C+/B- for my taste - but I have had numerous sour and wild ales and this is one of my favorites"
"Overall: I think it's slightly above average. My fiancee says that she begs to differ, and claims this is one of her favorite beers. Agree to disagree, I suppose. It's not my bag, but I can definitely respect this brew, anyway."
"Thanks to Hophead101 for giving me a bottle of 2007 to try."
"O: This beer is a little bit of a disappointment in my opinion. It's not awful but it's a little bit too sour. Doesn't seem to have a good balance. I probably wouldn't revisit this beer willingly, although I wouldn't keep someone else from trying it. I'm sure some people will find this beer rather pleasant."
"O: Pretty good, I don't think I will mind drinking the rest of this 4 pack. It comes as a bit of a disappointment considering the usual quality of Dogfish Head, but I guess no one is always perfect."
"Mf/o: lots of bubbles and a prickle from the carbonation. Tart finish and overall an enjoyable beer"
"This is probably the only Dogfish Head brew I've had so far that I did not care for. It is a weissbier brewed with peach, with the option at the bar to add mango concentrate, which I opted not to do. I don't know if the tap was bad or what, but this beer was soda-fizzy, and tasted watered down. Poured hazy yellow with little to no head. Bitter hop aroma, and kind of funky. Thin, watery taste, with a little bit of fruit and stale wood. Light and fairly easily drinkable, but not too much flavor or character, which is not what I expect from Dogfish Head."
"I was a little disappointed with this brew. I usually really enjoy Dogfish, however this one was not for me. Too sweet and too sour. One of these would be all I could have. Probably won't visit this again anytime soon. I'm sure some like it, so they can have my share. As it warmed, it became more tolerable."
"Overall. Wasn't expecting that strong sourness, but it was a cool surprise. Would love to try another on a hot day while camping."
"Bottled Review - Like most beer nuts I love this brewery and I consider myself quite lucky that at anytime I could take a 3 hour road trip to DfH and have a lot of wonderful brews. But I must say that I do not enjoy this brew specifically. When I received a 4 pack from my family as a gift I was really excited to try it because it was new at the time. I poured my first one into a glass and everything looked good it smelled a little funky but that didn't bother me. It was the taste it was really not my cup of tea. To this day I can't figure out why I think this beer tastes like vomit to me. I feel really bad that I can't enjoy this brew like a lot of other people do but this is one that I can't get passed my lips anymore."
"Smells like peach candy and citrus. Tastes like lemon pulp and grass with a little bitter peach. I was expecting something like a peach lambic, but this is so much more. Not the sort of thing I'd get for leisurely drinking-it's too fancy and sweet for that. This would be a good beer to have with dessert or as an aperitif."
"The CPJ"
"D - Low alcohol content really makes the citrus-peach favors stand out; I thought it was a good fruit flavored beer; unique; good summer drink"
"Pours a pretty clear super fizzy golden color with a very small fizzy head with absolutely no lacing. Smells of peach and a little tartness and some malts. Tastes a little of peaches and a little watered down amber ale mixed together. Almost like a Lindeman's Peche with very little flavor. Mouthfeel is medium with a huge carbonation. Drinkability is high."
"Low abv and pleasant taste/mouthfeel lead to very good drinkability. I liked this more than I expected, but still wouldn't want very often."
"An interesting concept to blend peaches with this style, good but I like the traditional better. Still, a must try for it's uniqueness."
"This is the 2010 brew if you're interested. So looking at the below review I will be aging my other bottles for a few years."
"Thanks to Stan for sharing this treat. Poured from a 2004 750 ml bottle there was still a ton of carbonation and it showed with a nice finger worth of tiny white bubbles that sat at the top of the snifter for a while. The color reminded me of a peach or apricot. The aromas of peach juice and funk were still very prevalent in the nose. I have had this fresh but this aged bottle was fantastic in the flavor department. It was tart with a hint of peach sweetness coming thru to make this thing superbly drinkable. We sipped at this bottle for a good hour and enjoyed every drop. The mouthfeel was light with great carbonation for your tongue. I would not have thought to age this one that long but I will be doing a few bottles for myself. It really just mellowed down the sourness and made this a great brew"
"On tap at DFH poured into pint glass. Pours a hazy pale yellow with a thin, quickly dissipating white head. Aroma is sour citrus that overpowers what little sweet malt is there. Flavor is sour lemons and peach concentrate. Mouthfeel is thin and watery. Just couldn't get into this one."
"Pours an absolutely unique-looking, clear, light, whitish-yellow. Looks like a champagne. Nice head retention. Smells peachy and light malty. With the taste, unripened peaches mixed with some unripened grapes as well. There is nothing predominating except for the sourness. Flat feel, sour finish. I'm gonna sample this one from the bottle, because it just didn't do it at all for me on tap.."
"Cheers"
"M - Light bodied with some good carbonation."
"This is a nice and clean beer, and probably a real treat on a hot Summer day. I enjoyed, though it's one of Dogfish's lighter, less bold brews."
"D: Though I think this beer is definitely not a Berliner weisse as it is missing that essential ascorbic flavor, it is super tasty and tart. love the away the peaches come through so that they taste complete and integrated at the same time. Good drink, will have again when I see it."
"I've had it in the bottle, and I thought it was flabby and dull. On-tap, however, it was delicious. I couldn't stop drinking it and never stopped to consider drinking anything else."
"I felt like I was drinking a wine cooler, not a beer. DFH does amazing things, but this is not it. Not to diss anyone who enjoys this beer, but if there was ever a ""girly"" beer, this is it!"
"Standard bottle poured into a pint glass. Had little to no head and no lacing. The aroma was of sour peaches, smelled wonderful. It tasted sour than I expected but the more I drank the more I liked it. It was super easy to drink and is one of those beers that you crave on a hot summer day."
"This poured a very light yellow, almost like a sparkling white grape juice that is a little hazy. There is tons of carbonation. I don't get much peach in the scent as I expected, but that may not be a bad thing necessarily. The taste had a good peach flavor that gave it a sourness. It isn't a sour and didn't have the sourness I want when going that route, and it wasn't malty or hoppy. The flavor seemed a bit lost if you ask me. It isn't bad, I am just disappointed."
"D: A well made, interesting take on the Berliner Weissbier. Drinkable."
"VERY GOOD, WORTH TRYING!"
"D/M: strong carbonation tingle, sweetness really makes it a joy to drink and isn't in any way a turn off, drinks very smooth and light"
"L, S, M, and D, seem to be exactly per style. The peach flavor is nice, though I don't know if I would pick peach out if it were not on the label. I may have guessed a citrus mix. This is a carbonated, refreshing beer, but is so light I am not inclined to seek it out again. The syrupy fruity flavor just does not have enough texture to make it interesting. There is a little bit of grassy flavor at the finish, but this still drinks close to a soda than I prefer with a beer. This has a pretty accessible level of sour to it, thus is a nice introduction to sourer beer flavors. I have limited experience with this style, and I thank DFH for expanding my beer culture with it, but it will be low on my list going forward."
"The first time I tasted this I was not impressed, I am now. For its style, its a really good brew."
"This is okay, but nothing I'll ever want to revisit. One thing I'll always say about Dogfish Head is that their penchant for experimentation not only makes them one of the most interesting brewers in the business, but that sort of ""let's trying everything and anything"" sometimes produces less-than-spectacular results. C'est la vie. They're still one of the best breweries ever."
"I have to say though, that I'm a little disappointed that Dogfish Head OF ALL breweries wouldn't chose to develop the lactic quality and peach flavor naturally. Why not use lactobacillus instead of lactic acid? Why not whole peaches instead of peach concentrate? DFH has the resources! They have sourced water from Antarctica for crying out loud!!! Sam seems to take A LOT of pride in his ingredients and processes, so why the lapse with this beer?"
"Quite nice, far from traditional, and with enough complexity and flavor in some sort of harmony to make this an appealing seasonal beverage."
"Not a big fan of this beer. The finish needs some work and more flavour. I've said this before but DFH has my respect for their experimental nature only - their beers themselves just never really manage to get me into bed."
"D: if it had a bit more carbonation maybe it would have faired better. Also considering that I am drinking this beer out of season, I am worried that I have picked up a rather old bottle."
"Not a beer for me. Really, I haven't had a really pleasant Berliner Weisse from outside Germany, and this is yet another sub-par example. The peach character tries its hardest to give something to the beer, but it fails in my opinion. Not a great beer. Dogfish Head again try something different (and I love them for trying), but yet again they fall short."
"D - Super drinkable. I really like the peach flavor and the funkiness and tartness really enhances it a lot. Fantastic beer."
"It's also worth noting that while this beer is understandably sold as a summer seasonal, mine worked just as well on a crisp November afternoon. I paired it with an egg and bacon sandwich as my first beer of the day. This would be perfect if you're looking for a champagne substitute at brunch."
"D- Its drinkable, refreshing and beer. Not something i'd drink all the time but a nice change."
"This beer pours a hazy superbly pale of straw color with simply no head to be found. The aroma is as promised. There is a nice peach syrup aroma that has a slightly sour undertone. That really is the extent of the aroma, still good though. The taste is both peachy and sour, this neo-Berliner style Weissbier style seems to be fiercely not nearly as sour as I would have expected. It's still not horrible. Mouthfeel is seemingly overcarbonated. Not too bad. It's drinkable, but I really don't like it too much. It's an decent beer, but not something I'd seek out again."
"D: What a refreshing summer sipper this would be. FP is very sessionable at 4.5%, but I think the sweetness would get to me after awhile."
"D. Works great when paired with a thick soup. Would probably be a great summer beer as well."
"A girlfriend beer, yet the tartness and peach are complex enough for any enthusiast of craft beer."
"Sessionable at 4.5% if not for the tartiness that would limit me to a 4 pack, but for its intended purpose: a great summer poolside beer!"
"Poured yellow with a thick white head. Aroma had tropical fruit juice and tart esters. Very carbonated which attacked the palate nicely with layers and textures. Very sweet and fruity flavors and very sour towards the finish with a finish. The finish tasted of yeast tones. I could taste the peach a little, but definitely not over bearing. I feel in the bottled versions the peach is more evident and concentrated-like."
"however overall i did not enjoy this beer"
"D: This is like a lower carbonated Izze soda. Kudos to Dogfish Head though for trying styles that no one else would dare come near."
"Drinkability: Low ABV and easy to knock a couple back. The only thing that might keep me from downing a case is the tartness. Not sure how long I could go without it becoming a little overbearing."
"D - Light and refreshing, but the sourness leaves me to only wanting one of these at a time. Good for a change, but I was hoping for a bit more peach flavoring."
"D-Really easy drinking and refreshing with an interesting flavor profile."
"Crisp, clean, and nicely carbonated mouthfeel. Drinkable and refreshing."
"D: Pretty good beer; some of it's characteristics were a bit disappointing, but overall a decent beer. A little on the high side price-wise (8.99 for a four pack is a bit much) so I probably won't have this one again."
"Insanely drinkable, I'd drink a six pack by the pool without even thinking about it. Very refreshing and tasty, maybe the perfect summer beer. I look forward to this beer every summer."
"I love this beer. It is my summer brew."
"D- it was more of a novelty one time thing for me i cant imagine drinking this again overall it was decent i dont think i wouldve spent the 3 bucks on this brew going in if i knew what it tasted like."
"This isnt at all your typical DFH brew. Unlike many other DFH beers this one is very very light. There is very little foam and what seems to be a high level of carbonation. Also it is very dry and fruity due to the addition of peaches. This is not at all what i had expected but i should have known better because sweet fruit always produces a dry cider-like characteristic. That being said, it is a good beer and a great change of pace for the DFH regular, but its just not my cup of tea(or beer in this case)."
"Poured fairly yellow, a little fizzy but not too much head. Smells a little bit like peach (expected) but overall mostly sweet. Taste is moderately sweet, maybe a little tart (but not sour). The beer was refreshing and left a reasonable taste/feel in my mouth. The overall drinkability isn't bad however there are plenty of things i would choose over it."
"It's actually not bad...as a person who likes sour beverages, such as lemonade, I can't say that I found this displeasing at all. The tart nature was definitely there, but not to the point of being puckering. The soft wheat at the end was a nice finish."
"Awesomely sessionable."
"D- The drinkability of this beer, to me, is off the charts. Super refreshing, nice balanced flavor, and with a nice finish on it. Like said before, best summer beer EVER!!"
"Edit - The 2009 version is the bomb."
"pours a clear light yellow color with lots of carbonation and very little head looks like ginger ale to me..smell is grain,malt and a lemon zest odor..taste is tart and sour with a grain and malt then a tart fruit overall taste,, its crisp and carbonated..with very little peach taste..mouth feel is thin but it is crisp tart,and sour..this is made as a berliner should be as far as characteristics of one..its just to thin tasting for me i would like it more full bodied"
"D: So refreshing and drinkable; the perfect, light summer beer"
"First time with the style (as I'm sure is the case for many reviewing this) so not sure how to rate. For a beer that pushes the peach, I'd expect to taste it more. Pleasant tart thirst-quencher, though."
"Light bodied, highly carbonated beer cleanses the palate well. Easy drinker with light alcohol taste. If you don't mind the sourness, this can be a session beer."
"Overall I found this brew quite interesting It is now on the buy again list as well as a note to try others of the style."
"M & D: Very carbonated and the bubbles tickle my tongue. I could drink this all day."
"Good, but not great."
"D: Considering my negative opinion of most fruited beers, I wasn't sure about this one, but I rather unexpectedly ended up enjoying it quite a bit. Light and refreshing, with only a hint of peach. Considering DFH's typical in-your-face style, this one was very subdued."
"Pours a really light straw color, slightly hazy with a wheaty glow to it. Aroma of dried apricot and banana bread. Mouthfeel is light and dry, very refreshing. Flavor is of tart peach, soft almost hefeweizen-like mouthfeel. Ages amazingly well."
"Served from bottle into a Dogfish Head shaker. Poured a hazy straw yellow with a one finger pure white head that subsided to none almost instantly. There was no apparent lacing evident throughout. The aroma was comprised of malt, peach, and a bitter note. The flavor was of peach, malt, with a nice peach followthrough on the palate. It was light on the palate with low carbonation. Overall this was not that bad for the style. I have had a few from this style and hated them, but this one was quite drinkable. Maybe one day I will find one that blows me away, but this one was a good start."
"I do not enjoy pouring money down the drain, so no I don't think I'll be drinking any more of this tonight or ever. This beer has it's place however, in the same way that Smirnoff Ice and lethal injection have their place. I really was excited and wanted to enjoy this unique style but...hell no. Where is the appeal? Pour some old lemon juice on a slice of bread, squeeze it into a cup, add a tablespoon of blech! and you have Festina Peche."
"Anyways, not too much else to say. This brew is not for everyone but it suits me fine. Non-BA's in the family will usually even add an ice cube or two to this one and chug away. Lady loves the Belgian Sours and will swill this one without a problem. Festina Peche is also quite a bit cheaper than those examples if you are on a budget and want to taste something sour and refreshing."
"D: Good due to the light body and refreshing taste. Low abv helps as well. Only thing working against it is that the tartness could grow old."
"A refreshing, interesting summer brew. A nice departure from the witbiers and pale wheat ales that are standard during the season. Very nice."
"I've literally been drinking this beer all summer and marvel at its drinkability on a daily basis. I just can't get enough of this excellent session ale and it's really nice to see a Berliner Weisse get wide distribution."
"Overall, I'm not a huge fan of this beer, and it is by far the worst Dogfish Head beer that I've had. I went out on a limb and tried this Festina Peche, but better fruity beers are still out there, i.e. Sweetwater Blue and a local one I've had from R.J. Rockers. Don't think I got a bad bottle, I'm just not a fan."
"D - Very drinkable, especially at 4.5 % ABV and on a hot summer day. Pretty well-balanced between the wheat and the tartness, it's so cool to me that a large brewery like DFH would release an oddball style of beer like Berliner Weiss to the masses. Overall a very unique beer and a perfect example of the off-centered brews coming out of DFH."
"Bottle. Pours a slightly cloudy golden yellow hue that had a really nice head that quickly dissipates leaving a wispy collar around the glass. The nose is straight peach on this followed by some wheaty undertones. Initial sip gives way to the sweet subdued peach taste with a tart feel to it. Some citrus as well. Slight bitterness in the end. Very smooth drinking. A nice summertime drink. Would be nice with a touch more tart/sour. Light medium mouthfeel."
"D:All in All a very sessionable summer beer due to the low ABV, if you like these style of beers"
"very light and refreshing, this was fun and easy to drink. i could drink several and not be bored."
"Crap."
"Very drinkable and super refreshing on a hot day. This style of beer has been at the forefront of my attention this year. I am not picking up on the peach addition at all in this brew but if you let your imagination wonder there is some very minor resemblence to peach skins included in the aftertaste."
"this beer was different for sure, im glad for tasteing it but i prolly wouldnt buy it again."
"As a side note, peaches come through a lot more when it warms."
"DR- Fairly balanced and refreshing. Great summer brew."
"D- super easy to drink, however it is kinda heavily carbonated so I would find it hard to imagine putting down more than a couple of these, nice for a relaxing summer day"
"Should be much more drinkable for it being only 4.5%. Not sure what they were going for; this is light, but not refreshing. I don't think I'll be getting again."
"This is a nice refreshing beer for summer. I think this represents the style well. The peach however could be bumped up some. If in the mood for a BW, this would be a good choice."
"D. Goes down fast and easy. This is a fairly simple thirst quencher that is enjoyable on a hot summer day. Something interesting to drink from time-to-time as a nice change of pace."
"An interesting taste experience nonetheless."
"(2010 production) Poured with almost no head, and a straw-yellow like color; a bit of haze to it as well. Sour fruits (peach mostly) on the nose. Slight peach taste to it and has a small puckering effect on your mouth. This was the first of the Festina Peche's that i've had from Dogfish Head, so I don't have previous years to compare it to. I wouldn't buy this again, but I will have no trouble finishing this 4-pack."
"A really unique brew that would be great for summer parties..."
"Overall, I like this beer. It's an American take on an underappreciated style, and I think it's a good session beer for summer. I get why T drinks this all the time. She's a smart girl with great tastes in both beer and men ;)"
"D...It grows on you if very cold. Refreshing with an open mind."
"While this is my first of this style and a bit apprehensive I was fairly impressed. And though it is not something I will seek out regularly I am very happy that I gave this a try, and would very much enjoy trying a couple more."
"very very drinkable, guzzleable if cold in fact."
"might have to try mixing this with a pale and/or some 'fruitier' brew, just for fun."
"Non-clear golden color with virtually no head. You can lightly smell the tart fruit and malt. A smoother tartness on tap with light fruit and malt flavor. The peach is not in the forefront. It's blended nicely with the malts... the tartness is the main thing. DFH dialed back the tartness a bit for 2010, and I think it is perfect now. Lovely mouthfeel for summer. High drinkability since it's so light and tart.... very refreshing on a hot summer day."
"All in all, this brew disappointed. Not much going on to make this brew worth tying. I love many DFH brews, but this is not one of em. Not worth your time."
"Poured from a bottle into my favorite pint glass. Appearance was light and bright. Smell was wheat-y and peachy. Nice bright smell. The taste was light as well with a small amount of nice peach flavor. The sourness was really nice as well. My favorite was the mouthfeel. The bubbles were very tiny and smooth. Drinkability was up there as well. I'd have this again."
"Reviewed blind for the Blind Beers BIF. Here we go: It pours a hazy orange straw topped by some white foam that dies faster than the Cubs' chances for a title. The nose comprises lemon pulp, coriander, mandarin oranges, sweet corn, and a tiny bit o' flowers. The taste starts with some nice, bitingly tart lemon wedge, then moves into some green apple, cardamom, coriander, and a late sweetness like that found after a Sour Patch Kid has been in your mouth awhile. The body is light, with a moderately active carbonation and a dry, almost sticky finish. I was thinking wit for most of the tasting, but the tartness destroyed that possibility. I had forgotten about Berliner Weisses. It was interesting that I didn't get too much in the way of peaches, but there is a possibility this was a slightly vintage bottle, so that could have influenced things a bit. Good times, regardless."
"But right now it's like 100 degrees and I'm having a hell of a time thinking of anything else that would be working better."
"Overall tasty, tart and very drinkable. This will be going in to heavy rotation in my fridge for the rest of the summer."
"Dr. Very good, nice dessert. Two would be max I think."
"D - Luckily it was only a sample. I gave the rest to Soupedupdiesel."
"Very dinkable"
"D- not bad, I'm not a really big fan of it but I like the novelty and would be willing to try it again."
"This is pretty ideal concoction for the season, as everything is super crisp and light. I'm not sure why so many people wrote such awful reviews as if they were blown away by the tart and fruit aspects being this is a Berliner Weiss inspired brew. Either way, it's another hit from DFH for me."
"Good for a hot day if you are looking for an alcoholic peach alternative to unsweetened lemonade. It does not drink like a beer at all...at least in the traditional sense of hops and malt, or any beer I've ever had. Pours like a soda with a sour/tart smell. Tastes sour, with a sour finish. Some peach flavor there, but more lemony citrus than peach. To DFH's credit the front of the label lists it as a ""malt beverage with peach concentrate"". It also describes it as ""unique, tart, and refreshing"" which is mostly spot on. It also seems to follow much of the Berliner Weisse description in terms of look and taste, so I can't really knock it, I just won't drink it when I want a beer."
"After-notes: Not at all surprised to see the style, hadn't even heard of it. I had heard of the beer though, and just hadn't gotten around to drinking it. After reading the description of the style, this fits it perfectly. Now I just have to try more within the style to find out this beer's true style ratings..."
"This is a very refreshing, easy drinking beer. A perfect summertime drink!"
"This beer is a dead ringer on appearance for the style definition on the site. The head is effervescent, the color is pale straw, and it is clear. The aroma falls a bit short, but the smell of peaches does come through. Very strong when it comes to taste. The sourness from the lacto culture complements the peaches very well, and there is a grainy wheat character that backs both up. The carbonation is plentiful and appropriate adding to the light body of this beer."
"d- a sessionable sour ale for $8 a 4pk? I'll take it. I heard they changed the recipe this year, so I'll have to get a newer bottle and compare. I hope they didn't stray too far, as this is a good one."
"A great summer session beverage much like a shandy or a radler. Added to my outdoor activity menu."
"Pours a very pale yellow with tons of carbonation and a head that evaporates immediately, as is the style characteristic. The aroma is sour patch tart with a hint of peach and some grainy wheat aroma. The flavor is quite tart up front with an acidic bite that is very refreshing. It also has a very wheaty malt flavor as well as some peach and pear notes in the background. This beer is quite interesting in that it is kind of like a Berliner weisse mit schuss, but with the syrup (peach in this case) built in. I was skeptical when I heard about this at first, but it works quite well. The body is light with effervescent carbonation and a spiky mouthfeel that is quite refreshing. It is also one of the lowest ABV beers that DFH makes and is a great BBQ beer. I could drink these all day, and it is a nice change of pace from other summer wheat beers."
"D- Surprisingly drinkable for how sweet it is, but it still would be hard to have multiple of these."
"D - Ridiculously drinkable if you don't mind the tartness. Stellar summer beer but there are many that I'd buy before. Solid overall."
"D - With the low ABV, the just right level of tartness and the natural peach flavors, this downs easy, and you could probably handle a four-pack in a short evening."
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a slightly cloudy golden color with a small head. Smell is strong of peaches. Taste starts off with lots of peaches, then becomes tart and somewhat bitter. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and has average drinkability. Overall this is a good brew."
"Overall, a decent drinkable beer for a hot summer day. This is nothing mind blowing for a b-weisse. I was expecting more of a tartness. Pretty drinkable if you can get by the artificial peach flavors."
"High abv for style, and mighty good drinkability. It is however quite boring for a Berliner (based on the limited few examples I've had), if anything I would expect Dogfish to do a more exteme example. Oh well."
"Poured from a bottle into the signature Dogfish Head glass. Pours a hazy golden orange. Little head to speak of and it quickly disappears. Smell is strong citrus, little malt, underlying peaches. Taste is pleasantly sour and tart, with a strong lingering orange flavor. Very high carbonation, but it works here as it increases the refreshment. Very drinkable, but I wonder if the sweetness would be a bit much past 2 or 3. This is my last bottle of my first ever 4 pack of this beer. I will buy again this summer, and will make it a summer staple from this year forward. Good beer."
"*EDIT* just went out and bought a case of this beer. Something I rarely do. This stuff is awesome."
"D: This is really different and really good in my opinion. It's easily one of the most refreshing summer beers I've had in a while. It's an easy one to keep drinking on a hot summer day."
"Picked up a growler for a cookout - it seemed like a good choice for a refreshing summer afternoon brew. Poured a slightly hazy pale orange (very light), with an almost non-existent head - very fizzy, though. Aroma was dominated by wheat and peaches - ruh-roh, what have I done... Taste was surprisingly enjoyable (compared to the bland / fruity aroma) - wheat / grains, with some peach starchiness, with a puckering, sour finish. Mouthfeel is pretty light - that crisp, sour finish is what saved this beer for me. Pretty drinkable, but its definitely something I'd have to be in the mood for to have again - the peach sweetness gets a little old after a couple. Worth a try, though -"
"Drinkability: Not a bad summer drink, especially on a day like today when it was over 100 outside. The sweetness is too much to really have numerous bottles of this at one sitting."
"I'm a huge fan of Dogfish Head, and festina peche is one of those beers that can only be drank when in the mood."
"American sour peach beer. very interesting. nice beer just very different."
"This is the 2010 batch. Pours a very cloudy, apple-cider color. In the nose I pick up peaches and some interesting sweetness. I also pick up sour notes and maybe a bit of green apple. Wow, this is A LOT Different than the 2009 version I had not too long ago. The 2009 had a lot more sourness. The peach is MUCH more detectable here...and I'm having a hard time deciding which version I enjoyed more. Immediately, I'm getting a bit of sourness, followed quickly by strong peach and nectarine flavors. Then ending with a very subtle sour taste. I take that back, this beer really isn't even sour anymore...just mellowly tart. I must say this version may have better drinkability. The mouthfeel is quite nice and crisp. I know FOR SURE, this will get more people liking this beer (converting sour haters a bit). Interesting change in flavor Dogfish...still not sure which version I like better...But both are very good."
"Not much in the appearance to this one. The fizzy head faded out rather quickly, leaving no lace. Beer itself is a cloudy golden straw color. Not sure what's going on in the smell catagory. The only thing I got was a faint hint of malt, not much else. Taste was better, more malt and slightly sour, with a hint of peach. It's a nice light beer, great for the hot summers down here. Probably wouldn't be to bad at the beach either."
"As usual, a unique experience from DFH that must be tried. It certainly wasn't much to look at but it has a nice refreshingly sour quality to it. It's not overly fruity but it was a little like sipping a soda. I also would have rated it higher but it had a fairly salty finish which usually would come with some sort of herbal accompaniment but I couldn't quite pick anything out so it became more like a seltzer water."
"D: I enjoyed this beer- a nice variation on a wheat, the dry sweetness lent by the fruit balanced by the hops make it an easy drink to come back to."
"It's an enjoyable beer but not one I'd be inclined to drink regularly."
"D: Not my favorite everyday drinking beer, but this is a welcome change from the many strong bold flavored beers I regularly drink. I do however vaguely remember liking last year's batch better, but this is fairly delicious and worth a try."
"Drinkability: very drinkable, it's has good flavor and is low in alcohol content, it's a decent session beer"
"It makes me sad that this is the only Berliner Weissbier I can get my hands on. I've only ever had one other back when Founders had one in their repertoire. But, that was long ago and lost to the fog of beer."
"Drinkability: Pleasantly surprised that the peach was not overdone, making it cloying. Not my favorite summer beer, but refreshing nonetheless."
"This is a great summer seasonal that isn't done often enough. Why didn't I find this earlier? You gotta try this!"
"D: A solid summer refresher. I don't know how many I could have in one sitting, but one bottle sure hit the spot."
"D - I couldn't help but think this was misclassified from a lambic on flavor alone, but after research I found it actually nailed the style - that'll teach me to assume I know what I'm getting. My wife enjoyed it very much."
"Beer is thin and mildly sour. Its very drinkable and there is some nice carbonation in the mouth that accents the peach flavors well. I'm in good company when I say that this is not exactly a berleinerweiss but its a decent sour wheat with fruit. I could drink a lot of this."
"Had the luck to find it on tap at whole foods. Was not even expecting much from it except a ""drinkable"" summer drink, but it turned out great. Slightly sour, aromatic, tasty as hell, and perfect for a summer drink. Not sweet, but not at all bitter. Exceptional warm weather drink."
"Pours a pale yellow without too much head. A very sweet peach smell, with some lemon too I think. Flavour has lots of peach, but I get a mild pleasant bitterness too. Mouthfeel was a little bit thin, but still a really nice summer beer. I'd never turn this down, but I am unlikely to seek out again."
"Pours a slightly hazy pale yellow color which when poured the head disappears immediately. After the pour there is no head and no lacing. The aroma has a citrus smell with some sweet notes and a hint of peach. The taste is tart and sour up front with a light champagne type taste. At the backend a peach sweetness is present. The mouthfeel is stingy and crisp like a sparkling wine with a low to moderate carbonation. Overall on a hot summer day this would be a very good beer. The taste is light crisp and refreshing. For the style a very solid selection."
"It pours a very light gold, with NO head whatsoever. It smells a bit sour with a nice hint of the peaches. When I taste it, it is tart and makes me pucker up just a bit (in a good way). Next comes the peach flavors which are subtle and the finish is crisp. After I had the glass it made me salivate and yearn for more. I would recommend this beer to anyone to try once. Yes it is a sour beer and America needs to get used to the style. It is such an amazing style of beer."
"Mild aroma of yeast and a bit of bright lemon. Moderate carbonation and a pleasantly full mouthfeel, the taste bursts immediately with citrus, peach, and a surprising sourness. The finish leaves a lingering tart green apple flavor. Interesting and drinkable (though one was plenty) summer brew."
"I am a big fan of other Dogfish beers (the 90 minute is simply amazing) but they really need to stop making this beer all together. If you are into sweet-light beers there are many others with better flavor that you can choose from, Dogfish Black & Blue, Allagash White, or even a Leines Summer Shandy. All I feel are more drinkable."
"D - My first experience with this style, and I'm very pleased with DFH's version. I can see knocking back a four pack on a hot summer day, and DFH has packed some crazy flavor into a 4.5% ABV beer."
"very drinkable. Summer pool side beer"
"Drinkability is enjoyable for a nice light tart summer brew."
"Tastes like summer. Not the summer you went to Mexico and came back with the trots and sores on your mouth... the summer that was actually completely awesome."
"Pours a pale, cloudy yellow. Faint peachy aroma. Tart flavor hits right away. Peach, green apple and hints of lemon. Semi sour. Can feel it back in your jaw. Finishes with a little caramel and honey malt. Also noticed some bready, salty and toasted notes deep in the beer. A lot of flavors combining. Very light mouthfeel and very carbonated."
"D: Goes down easily, not filling, nice beer that really hit the spot. Light summer beer that you can sit with for a decent period of time."
"D-it's light and low alcohol, but it's not sessionable for me unless i'm out out in the sun for a long time, but I can't really see myself drinking this all day"
"D - Very drinkable and refreshing. One of the hottest days of the year and I want to keep putting them down."
"Much better on tap than in bottle"
"Tastes sour, almost mouth puckering, tart is a better word finishes with a slight peach aftertaste. This one leaves your thirst quenched and longing for more. The mouth feel is light and sparkling all in all leaving this beer one of the most unique session/hot-summer-day beer I have ever tried. I wish I could get it in a 12pk in my area. Love this beer."
"D = Low drinkability. I've now had a few of these and wish I would have had fewer. Without a doubt the worst berliner weisse I've had by a long, long shot. It si one of my favorite styles, but the DFH offering is too uneven and the best I've had wasn't good enough. I've now given them a few chances and am done."
"The mouthfeel is light with a higher level of carbonation. Drinkability is decent, it's a light, tart, refreshing beer that I can definitely relate to drinking on a hot summer day. This isn't a style that I encounter too often and it was pretty decent, but there were a few others I've tried that I liked better. Really like that they make a summer beer that is so different then all the others though."
"Taste: In your face sour apple that's definitely on the light and crisp side without the depth of complexity of a sour Belgian. The fizzy carbonation combined with the sourness really perks up your tongue and is very intense. Once acclimated to the sour bite, caramel and bread come through without even a modicum of bitterness or hop presence. Malts come through a bit more in the middle honey and caramel playing the role of sweet opposite the ever-present sour. Fresh fruits make an appearance as well, mostly peach with lemon. Finish is lemon juice that has a blunted sour character, caramel which lingers with an almost herbal undercurrent to the sour note."
"Notes: Very drinkable, mainly because it is so light and relatively devoid of any major flavor."
"O: This beer is very refreshing and is brewed to style. A very nice summertime session beer. No noticeable defects. Recommend drink very fresh!!"
"D: I'll stick to one...and honestly probably won't purchase anytime soon, but it's interesting!"
"D- this is a tough one. Casual drinkers would probably take one sip of this and spit, as would most novice craft drinkers...I think I can appreciate this style. I'd buy again, though I don't know if I will this season. Definitely an interesting experience with my first sour."
"The fizziness dances in your mouth and the light mouthfeel is very refreshing. If not for the high carbonation you could easily chug this beer and then come back for many more without much of an effect."
"D= Love this beer. My favorite summer seasonal I've ever had actually. There is a nice complexity to it but the best thing is just how refreshing this is. Lovely beer."
"pours a hazy transparent yelow color with little to no head, little to no lacing, and flat carbonation. peachy fruity smell which was expected. looks almost more like juice than beer. peachy seltzer like flavor that was very enjoyable. light body that had a fizzy sweet and tart finish and taste. thin slick texture, and average flavor duration. definitely something different than your average beer. very good, would definitely drink again."
"The body was OK, light and crisp, with the remaining carbonation providing some life across the tongue. Drinkability was OK as well, not great, not terrible. Overall, a kind of bland take on the style."
"Over all a good session sour!"
"Mouthfeel is light and has a crisp amount of carbonation."
"D- drinks extremely easy. Its very refreshing. I'm drinking this after a loooong day of fishing in the hot warmer sun."
"Bright and acidic mouthfeel, nice and puckering without being overwhelming. Smooth and crisp, but maybe a bit thin. Overall a nice and refreshing change of pace for a summer beer. The fruit is subtle, but it has a nice range of flavors throughout."
"D- Festina is something different. I give DFH credit for staying committed to this style. You can drink many of these and still let out a sour smile. I will always seek out some of these during the summer days because they can be pounded ridicuosly well"
"Drinkability: There's really not a lot to this beer. It's easy to drink, has a simple, refreshing taste to it, and it's going pretty well with the summer afternoon. It isn't great, but it isn't bad either. I'd say if you're a fan of DFH that it's worth a try, but to be honest I wouldn't go crazy trying to score a sixer of this."
"D: style wise i think i can see why the Germans mix it with sweet syrups."
"D: this is another unique beer from DFH. Nice refreshing brew, great for a hot summer day. I preferred last years version when it was more tart and less wheaty."
"d - Not a very good beer. The nose was non existent, and the taste had tart and very little peach taste. My girlfriend usually likes fruitier beers but neither of us enjoyed this one. Wouldn't try again."
"M/D: It is thin and light, very easy to drink. It works well as a summer beer, and great on a hot day out in the back yard. The first time I had this beer I really wasn't a huge fan, but am finding myself enjoying it more and appreciating the style more as well."
"The beer pours a light yellow color with a large white head. The aroma is peaches with some light tartness and some wheat. The flavor is wheat and peaches with only a little bit of tartness. Light mouthfeel and medium carbonation. Very drinkable, but I wish the beer was a little more tart."
"D: Very drinkable. Nice balance of sweet and sour with even bitter for the rest of the balance."
"Play some Allman Brothers while drinking this one...preferably somewhere sunny."
"At first I was a bit dissapointed with this beer, but then I reviewed the style (Berliner Weissbier) and found it very true to form. Not my favorite beer from Dogfish Head, but kudos to them for brewing a style that is a bit ""off-centered"". Cheers!"
"Medium-light body, with moderately high carbonation. Fairly light, and somewhat crisp. Refreshing, and pretty easy to drink, especially on a hot day. Would try again."
"Drinkability is alright, I woul enjoy some more sweetness and peach flavors, but then again this is my first for the style."
"D: Goes down real smooth - a perfect balance of sweet and sour. I can't get enough of these!"
"Not bad, enjoyable for the most part. Though it is not what I was expecting. Overall there is not a lot here. Barely any sour, tart, fruit, or otherwise. Just kind of blah."
"Pours a cloudy straw color with thin, fast fading white head, leaving a couple blobs of coarse lace. Smell: a little hay and green grass, peach / nectarine. It smells dry. Taste: wheat cracker, tart, slightly sweet, unripe peach / nectarine. Definite lactic character, but it's got a good dose of sweetness. Quite light with a tart, drying finish. Pretty straightforward but enjoyable. The fruit both complements and mitigates the tartness, so this would be a good intro to the style."
"This is the first time I've had a beer of this style. It is nice and pretty refreshing. Very fruity, but it works here, unlike some beers (outside of the usual lambics and Unibroue offerings). While it isn't so much my thing (though I might get it again), I'd definitely recommend it to others who are curious."
"I really liked this and it's okay when someone might not. I feel its worth having and it a great representation of the style."
"Dogfish Head Festina Peche poured a hazy color, with a small head that disapated quickly. It smelt and tasted very much the same, tart, and very peachy. There were no beer flavors, it was like drinking peach juice. I couldnt finish one. If you LOVE peaches you will probailly enjoy this beer, however if you do not LOVE peaches, its not very good."
"Overall-- a very pleasant and easy drinking beer. No real flaws that prevent me from ordering a 2nd glass."
"From pint glass. Poured out a hazy, light golden color, with a slight fizziness (no head) that abruptly died off. There is a citrusy aroma and a very subtle hint of peach that could very well go unnoticed. To me, this beer was reminiscent of a Shandy or a Radler. It tastes like a very light wheat beer with a little lemonade concentrate mixed in. I was looking foward to a nice summer replacement for my beloved Aprihop, but to no avail. I can see how this beer can be slammed back on a hot summer day, but so can Michelob Ultra Lime, for the same reasons. Just not what I was expecting from Dogfish Head."
"D - Not a style I am familiar with at all, but I really enjoyed this brew. Interesting flavors and I really like the level of tartness in this one. Refreshing, would be great for a hot day."
"goes down rather well. not quite sour, not quite sweet, not quite malty, not quite hoppy, but overall, not bad either."
"This was not what I was expecting overall. First time trying this beer style. Poured cloudy copper orange. Half a finger of head with short lived white foamy head. Aroma of weat, grassy barn yard, wet hay, and some fruit. Starts off bubbly in the tip of the tongue exploding into a sour mash party. I wasn't expecting the sour taiste but it lended to the fruity tones but no peach. Similar to bad pineapple. Interesting. Overall."
"Pours an almost pale, straw yellow color, with an impressive couple inches of dense white foam on top. Aromas of white peaches, chardonnay and lactic sourness. There is a slight sourness on the palate, with some wheat, some sweetness, apples and peaches. Alright, but nothing earth-shattering going on here."
"Pours a hazy golden color with a thinnish bubbly white head that disappears almost instantly. Staring into the glass this reminds me of apple cider. Smells of light sweet malts, tart and sour fruit and juicy peaches. Sweet fruits appear at first sip then fade quickly. Taste is a bit tart with the lactic piercing the tongue with lemons. Sweet and tart in the mouth, medium carbonation and body. Light highly quaffable brew. I could see myself enjoying these on a hot day."
"Clear pale straw gold in color; highly carbonated. Wheaty, slightly lactic peach aroma. Flavor is light, sour and quite tangy. Slightly funky (wonder what kind of yeast they use?). Very effervescent & awesomely refreshing. A summer favorite of mine."
"Poured into my Duvel tulip. Festina Peche is a nice straw yellow color, but I'm disappointed by the complete lack of any head formation (and thus no lace either). This is my first Berliner Weiss, and I know not to expect much in the way of a head, but I'd like something. The nose is largely of peaches, but it seems fairly muted/weak (and I haven't had a problem picking up aromas from my other beers tonight). A few sips raise my opinion of this beer greatly, as Dogfish Head absolutely nailed it with how tart they made this beer, it stops just a bit short of becoming overwhelming. The peach flavor is a fantastic balance to the sourness and really rounds out the beer well. The body is light and Festina Peche is highly carbonated (which works well with this beer). It's almost ridiculous how drinkable this beer is, especially given the sour aspect. I'd love to spend a summer afternoon leisurely working through a few of these."
"drinkability - refreshing and flavorful"
"D: I am impressed with the fact that FP delivered a taste of the Berliner weisse, and even more so with the fact that it was accomplished without bacteria. This is the best fruit beer I've had by far, and would definitely recommend it to fans of the Berliner weisse."
"D: Not a big fan of the berliner weiss style but I enjoyed this one."
"I'd like to give a fresh batch of this a try, as the sourness was very compelling. This isn't meant to age this long, but I think it held up reasonably well. Worth the mix 6 add, for sure."
"D - Well this definitely has to be one of the most drinkable styles out there, at least for me - and this is no exception. Light, lively carbonation and a great sour/tart flavor...throw in a low 4.5% alcohol level and here's a beer that you can drink all day. Think I'll be grabbing more of this in the summer when this will really shine."
"Drinkability: The first time I had this beer, I really couldn't get into it, but now I feel I can appreciate and enjoy it. I would find this quite refreshing in the summer, and with the low ABV I could easily enjoy a few, but would limit it two probably two because of the acidity."
"D: goes down easy with a little tartness...I could drink a few of these without a problem."
"Pairings: sunshine, paella, sushi, and grilled poultry."
"Overall, I think they hit their mark. I'm just left to wonder why?"
"D - Not much drinkability here. It's ok for what it is (a sour), but I wouldn't sit down and drink a sixer of this or anything."
"Fairly drinkable and refreshing, but not really something I will seek out."
"This brew is like a hybrid of a cider and a wild ale. It's sour, and then sweet, and of course back to sour again. Very tasty, but I definitely couldn't have more than one in a single sitting."
"D- HOT HOT HOT weather malt beverage- you need to be overheated and sweaty to really enjoy this thirst quencher. It's perfect for those conditions, but certainly not an everyday brew."
"A good drink for the right mood. I'm trying this one after a session in the salt water, but it has taken me six weeks to drink three out of the four pack."
"Overall I will probably buy this again. A solid Berliner that deserves a try."
"4.0 D: Overall this is a pretty simple brew, but it isn't half bad and quite refreshing though one might be enough."
"D - Excellent drinkability. This is a very refreshing and easy going beer. I just tried this for the first time recently, but I can say with certainty that this will be a frequent go to beer for the hot Southern California months ahead."
"Overall, very very easy drinking. People who only like one style, or are new to craft beer will not be shocked and appalled by this -- it is beer-like, but the sour note will throw them off. Worth trying this one if new to the style."
"Well, they can't all be winners. My wife picked this out thinking a fruit beer would be a nice thing to try, and we fuckin' hated it. It's a pretty dark gold color with lots of carbonation. The aroma has a bit of peach with lots of hops. The taste is godawful, it stings and is super sour. I almost couldn't swallow it because it was so bad, and it left an awful aftertaste. Three sips was enough before it went down the drain. Absolutely never again with this one."
"Tasty and extremely refreshing beer here. I'd love to see more American brewers give this style a chance."
"One of my favorite breweries DogFish Head rarely lets me down. Poured a hazy orange thick looking color. Smell was subdued peaches that weren't fake like out of a can with a slight sour note. Taste was clean, peachy, not overwhelming but not very complex. The wheat showed through as well as a little yeast with a tart finish. Not bad and possibly my first for this style."
"My first time drinking the Berliner Weissbier style, not quite what I was expecting, although DFH rarely does what one expects."
"pours a very light hazed straw color with a very quickly dissipating, film like head. A lot of white wine (sauv. blanc) like aromas, with light peach, sweet yeast, and apples. taste is really really tart. whew. lemon juice, green apples, faint peach. some cider qualities. very interesting. champagne carbonation mouthfeel. A little too tart for me right now, but i could drink 'em on new years as a champagne sub."
"Poured a golden wheat yellow color with a frothy white head. Decent retention. Smell was earthy then strong citrusy, lemon and very bitter peach. Taste was similar, light wheat then moving to strong citrusy taste, almost like biting into a lemon. Not a particularly balanced beer IMO, not bad but not my style."
"Drinkability: raise the drinkability also because this was so refreshing and the abv is nice and low yet it packs so much flavor. easlily went through the 4 pack."
"Drinkability - For as tart as this is, I don't think I could drink more than one or two of these at a given time. Now that I am typing this out, I know what this reminds me of taste wise. Growing up for some odd reason I use to steal the lemon juice from our fridge and try to concoct ""lemonade"" with it by adding sugar. It never turned out right and you would always drink nine tenths of the water/sugar/lemon juice mixture before getting any sweetness. Hence, for most of the time you were drinking bitter tasting water. That is what this beer tastes like. It reminds me of lemon juice and a hint of peach flavor added to it. That is the puckering effect I am remembering...from when I was a child making that drink. I am glad I was able to try this beer, but I would probably not seek it out in the future. An interesting experience indeed."
"D - Pretty sessionable for the style, would be great during the summer heat."
"D: The taste is light and fresh, so its definitely a good summer beer. However, the sour flavor lingers in the mouth and I'm not sure I would be able to drink this for an extended period of time or number of beers. It would be great with a light and fresh summer meal to balance out the strong accents of the beer."
"D: I love this style, and I think that this is one of the smoothest I have had. The peach gives it just enough sweetness. This would go great with just about any meal."
"Overall: It's not a style i'm overly familiar with and must admit to being taken aback just a little bit but i believe it's grown on me. Though unique, it would probably benefit better from warmer weather."
"Pours very clear pale yellow with almost no carbonation at all. Just slightly hazy, otherwise it looks like any pilser or macro. The smell is very non-sescript, maybe a hint of malt, thats about it. The taste is mouth puckering sour. Wow, its like chewing on a fresh lime. refreshing, but so sour. It reminds me of over-strong lemonade."
"Hey I say give it a try..."
"Drinkability: this is quite a drinkable beer. I feel like it would be out of place neither at a fashionable soirée nor a barbecue. Good stuff!"
"D - Edit: The new version (2010) sucks. Not sour, it is a peach fruit beer. Booo. Hiss. Pppbbbfff. I give it the Bronx Cheer."
"Apparently Festina Pêche is fairly true to style, and the style is not for me. I am hoping for some improvement after it warms up, but I hope in vain. Just plain bad."
"Tasted sour off the first taste, slowly tasting of sour peaches and a nice wheat body on it. Slightly watery, as most wheat beers seem to taste, but a great light beer. I think this could be very drinkable if it were not for the hefty price tag. Nice and refreshing in the end."
"Overall and interesting beer, Im glad I tried, probably won't purchase again."
"A less sour, and watery 2010 Festina Peche recieves a new score of 3.0 across the board, DFH will once again tweek this brew in 2011."
"Drinkability - You know I love peach, one of my favorite flavors but this beer is so complex and just entirely different that I'm torn. I am impressed in its complexity and characteristics however it needs to be sipped and then should be paired with food to help deal with the sugar. I would say you need heavy chocolate to compliment it. Bottom line is its a great beer but not one to have over and over again."
"D - Great, wonderful overall. A really good beer for the berliner style."
"Overall Impressions: Certainly works well for warm weather and is better very cold. Very champagne-like to drink. OK beer, but I have no need to buy it again (simply not my preference)."
"D: A tasty, tart brew. This reminded me a bit of a tart Cantillon Gueuze (but not at that level of quality). If you don't like sour tasting things, this one probably won't be for you. If you do like them, however, I'm pretty sure you'll enjoy this. This is the first ""Berliner Weissbier"" I've had, but based on the description this seems to be true to style. I'm going to try to find more beers in this style now, especially in the summer!"
"D - Good, goes down smoothly. Reminds me sort of a champagne. Tartness is very refreshing."
"Hazed pale blonde with a fine, lean white head that leaves blobs of sliding lace on the glass. The smell is super concentrated peach with a wisp of wheat malt. Tart and acidic, mouth puckering lemon juice and a touch of peach to take the edge off, not my favorite but the flavors fit the style definition to a tee. Light bodied and super carbonated. This beer is for people who like extremely bitter flavors with little to no sweetness to balance."
"Color is a pale yellow with an almost non-existent white head. Aroma is a mild sourness, not very inviting. Taste is extremely sour and tart with little discernable malt. Reminds me of Nerds or Sour patch kids. Not sure if that is what they were going for, but if it is they nailed it. Body is light to medium with somewhat high carbonation. Although this is a bit like sucking a lemon, it grew on me as I worked through it. Nevertheless, this is not my style and I will not be revisiting this beer for quite a while."
"Pale cloudy gold color with a large white head which dissipates quickly. Smell is of tart peaches and yeast. The taste is also tart peaches and yeast, with a tart aftertaste. Light bodied, decent carbonation, dry, and fairly drinkable. I have really liked everything I have had from Dogfish Head until now, but this one doesn't really do it for me."
"Overall, this may not have been one of my favorite beers the first time I had it, but it has since become one of my go to summer seasonal staples. So refreashing on a warm day and reasonably priced."
"My least favorite brew from DFH"
"Bottle courtesy of MDS- Thanks Mike! Decants hazy, cloudy yellow with a generous frothy white cap, with good sediment at the bottom of the glass.The aroma is heavily yeasty with sour lemons/limes and grapefruit and a barnyard/wet blanket sort of profile and a smidgen of apricot. The taste is full on tart yeasty peaches with white grapes, hay and a sour funk. Finishes astringent, puckering , bitter and tart, creamy yet dry. Low in alcohol and as a result, I could drink a lot of this. Excellent. Thanks Mike!"
"Drinkability: its drinkable, but more of an acquired taste. not something i'd seek out."
"If you can stand the sour, this is quite drinkable - if not, then you may end up with a drain pour. I'm trying my best to avoid doing that, but this beer is just too much for me... I kind of wish they had indicated on the label just exactly what this beer is all about. My first sip came as quite the shock."
"Very refreshing first sip. Just finished a workout so definitely appreciated. The tart flavor is overwhelming the peach but truly delicious. There is a bit of a champagne taste/feel in there just like the smell. I really wish I had saved more of this for the winter! I have one more left so if it keeps well I will get a case or more next year to hold onto through the cooler months."
"Taste: Cheek-puckering tartness. Peach comes through nicely and is a good pairing for the sour of the Berliner weissbier style. The wheat malt is only really noticeable in the aftertaste."
"This beer is not what I like to drink. To me it's more a soda beverage with some beer added to it. Very tart and smells like rubber. Very thin head disappearing quickly. I couldn't finish the bottle. I don't think I will ever wish to try this beer again."
"This would be a really nice beer if it didn't smell so bad. I don't understand it at all, because it didn't taste anything like it smelled. Oh well, I'd rather it smell funky but taste good than the other way around."
"Yet another interesting creation from dogfish head. This beer may be lacking in color (looks like miller high life) and smell (literally has none), but in my opinion it has a great, refreshing taste to it. I'm shocked its only averaging a B. it has a great tart/sour feel for it that makes it almost close to a lambic or sour, this paired with a nice peach taste and great drinkability makes it an altogether very solid beer."
"Very pale yellow color that is easily seen through. Very small head that dissipated almost immediately, not much lacing. The smell is very wheaty and citrusy. The taste is very sour lemony and peachy. It is very tarty and that overwhelms the beer. This is a decent beer but it is very unique. Very drinkable and a good buy during summer."
"I love sour things like lemons, pickles, and green apples. I love beer. I love DFH. No brainer. Hey, this beer is one I could keep in my fridge all year round, especially the summer. I've had limited Berliners, and need to add them to my brewing collection."
"D- This is definitely an interesting brew and one of my favorites from DFH thus far. Very drinkable."
"The Kings Of Hop"
"Overall its a very interesting beer. Not the best Berliner Weis I've ever had, but pretty decent too."
"D- Extremly high, you just can't help but not get this one down fast. Tart & refreshing! This would be fantastic on a hot day working in the backyard."
"Haven't had any other Berliner Weissbiers, but this one seems to hit on every note mentioned in the description. For some reason, I love what this beer is and can't wait to try more in this style."
"D: Vinegary taste is a little too dominant for me to ever want another."
"Not what I was expecting from a peach-flavored beer, but I'm not disappointed either. This is my first Berliner Weisse and only my 2nd Dogfish Head beer. I am intrigued and will seek out both the style and the brewery again."
"12oz bottle served at 47 degrees in a standard pint glass. Bottled in 2009 indicated on the bottle. Poured a slightly hazy straw color with a half inch bright white head that reduced its volume by half in less the 15 seconds before settling into a small slick with a tight band around the perimeter of the glass; no lacing on this one. Mild nose - prickly citrus and light, fruity esters. Taste consistent with nose; however, citrus is expressed more as citric acid than any definable fruit flavor, and a little bit of wheat comes out at the finish. Mouthfeel is light-bodied and very lively with a great deal of astringency that puckers the cheeks and stimulates the salivary glands before culminating in a tart, dry finish. Just starting to explore this style and I found Festina Peche to be quite drinkable, flavorful and refreshing. ABV makes it quite sessionable, but astringency can be a little overwhelming after more than a couple. Nonetheless, a great example of the style."
"My only complaint is that on moving this to large-scale production they stopped souring with natural bacteria. I say this because the sour character is slightly harsher and more one-dimensional compared with other sour beers and compared to when they first brewed this at their brewpub. It also lacks some of the aromas generated by natural bacterial souring."
"Drinkability - This is definitely an above average effort from an under appreciated category."
"Review from notes taken on: 9/10/09"
"Quenching and refreshing, that's for sure, and best to drink it on the colder side. Still nothing too remarkable here, but it delivers what it's supposed to."
"moderate carbonation and light mouthfeel make this a very freshing beer,especially after a hard day's work."
"I drank this from the bottle, and smelling inside the bottle, it's aroma was like a regular Dogfish Head beer. So I was quite taken back by my first taste. Tasted very carbonated even though it didn't have a carbonation look. It was also very sour and tasted more like a wine. I've never described my beer as dry before, but that is just the word for this beer. I actually really enjoyed this beer but near the end found myself getting a little tired of the sour taste. Still a PERFECT beer for the summer, and would be great with something grilled or marinated. It's the kind of beer I could serve my friends who prefer wine/cocktails over beer."
"Notes: A common mistake I´ve witnessed a few times with this is expecting, or demanding, it to be something that it is not. For instance I´ve seen a beer staffer at a well-know store telling another customer that this is only good as a paint stripper, and better stick to ""Son of a Peach"" as a fruit ale of choice. Different beers and different styles... This is quite a nice brew for a Berlin Weissbier, and purism aside if one thinks of the hints of peach, it is actually quite true to style. Nice, refreshing, tart, and a great addition to seasonal brew offerings on this side of the Atlantic."
"d- its a different kind that's for sure. its a beer that one wouldn't randomly pick one up and drink, but if you're in the mood for different this is certainly different. not a terrible beer. not most people's styles though, i feel. but if you like the kind, this is a good beer."
"Overall an interesting change of pace but I'm not likely to purchase again."
"There's just nothing good going on here. DFH have turned a beer sour, but there's no character behind it. Just an overly sweet lacto-bomb."
"Slightly hazy deep straw in color. Little head that dissipates quickly. Smell of frozen peach ice cream and lemon zest dominate the slight aroma this beer gives off. Taste is tart and to the point - this is just as you expect a Berliner Weiss from DFH to taste. Not up there with the greats, but pretty friggin close. Highly drinkable on a summer day, although too many and the sweetness overpowers. No need for syrup in this bad boy."
"tastes quite tart with a lemon zing and very little noticeable wheat. after a decent amount of time the wheat and yeast become slightly noticeable in the aftertaste. i am honestly not really getting any peach on this at all, which is somewhat unfortunate. the combination of lemon juice and carbonation hop along your tongue, which is an intriguing mouthfeel, but nothing out of this world. this is a light bodied brew and is well suited for the summer months."
"Pours hazy golden with a thin white head that disappears rather quickly. Nose has subtle peaches, tart citrus and wheat. Taste also has a nice sour yeast presence along with bready malts, lemon, white grapes and again a soft peach flavor. Crisp body is well carbonated. Very refreshing feel. This ended up being much better than I expected. Would be interesting to see how it ages."
"Notes: This is an interesting brew, to say the least. Dogfish Head makes off-centered beer for off-centered people, and I consider myself to be a bit off-centered. But, me and this beer must be on opposite sides of the center because I just didn't enjoy it all that much. I've only had the chance to try a couple DFH brews, with 60 minute and Palo Santo Marron being my favorites. I gotta give them respect for being so creative and quirky, as it takes some serious balls to take the kind of risks they do with such off-the-wall beers. I just wasn't feeling this little quirky creation."
"A solid, dry fruit beer, the tartness not overwhelming. A refreshing end of summer quaff."
"I poured into a pint glass to an inch of white head. It is a hazy, pale yellow. It smells kind of like an adjunct lager with a hint of peach. It tastes tart. It reminds me of green apples more than peach. It is dominated by the tartness. I could probably have another, but that would be about it. I would have to be in the mood for this style of beer to try it again."
"Notes: Had recently missed a chance to catch this on tap a few months ago so when I saw the bottle I snatched it up. I wonder if it would have presented significantly different on tap. More investigation may be required. Again here, I very much appreciate DFH willingness to explore lots of styles (and even create seemingly new ones at times!)."
"D: Like I said, very refreshing and different. Goes down easy on a warm summer day, but I think it's too sweet for me to have more than one. Still, a very interesting beer that proves yet again that DFH is always willing to push the envelope."
"D: I enjoyed this beer a lot drinking in 114 degree AZ sun. Tart, but not overly sour."
"Mouthfeel is light and spritzy, and fits the character of this beer the best it can. Drinkability is good. This fits only a hot summer day. It's refreshing acidity, spritzy mouthfeel and light body are great for a hot summer day and not much else. Very refreshing, but I feel it would be great only in small quantities."
"This is a very easy beer to drink. One comment from a taster was, ""It doesn't taste like beer. It tastes like a cocktail."""
"I give it pretty high marks for drinkability ... wish there were more of the style to compare it to."
"D: A very refreshing, easy drinking beer."
"Poured a hazy pale straw yellow color into my mason jar pint glass...I was vacationing in a cabin and these were the glasses du jour. Smelled of peaches with a hint of sour apple. Pretty tart, which I liked, but there really wasn't much beer taste. To me, the peach was more of a background flavor. I actually liked the acidy tartness that lingered after each drink. It went well with the light fizzy mouthfeel."
"I ordered this being naive to the peach theme because I don't speak the French and am a bit slow on the uptick. Mostly, just wanted a lighter beer because it's the summer, it's hot out, and the evening was just getting started. Got the glass, it looked good, but the smell was fruity and strange. Bheilman, devilish man that he is, then filled me in on the dirty little secret. Peaches my friend, peaches. Immediately revulsion filled my head, but you know what, it was pretty good. It was light and refreshing and had a fruit taste, but the beer part of this beer was still front and center. I won't run back to get this, but I enjoyed it."
"D: Extremely easy to drink, the hotter the day the better. Or the cooler. Basically, I really like this one alot, and find it tough to make it last more than 5-6 sips/gulps every time I have one...recommended."
"Other- I was really let down by this beer. I love DFH, and I love fruit beers, but something about the style or flavor, just wasnt for me. That doesnt mean another wont like it, but I dont plan on ever drinking one again."
"D: This was my first experience with the style. I must say that it was just ""above average"" on a tasting scale for me. I have nothing to compare this beer to, so maybe it is great for the style. I am not typically into sour beers, but I could see myself buying this again. I'd like to check out a few more of this style first though."
"The taste is somewhat similar, perfumy, light, thin, and dry, lemony with hints of peach and grapes. It has a light cracker-grain element that takes over in the aftertaste. Overall, it is too fruity, dry, and thin and does very little for me."
"Drinkability is real good since the alcohol content is low, the body of the beer is light and the flavor isn't overpowering. You could drink this all night and not get too tired of it or too drunk."
"First off, how many American breweries are making the Berliner-Weiss style? I'm having a hard time coming up with any. Very cool in my opinion that DFH would even try to attempt a beer like this. In the glass this bee is a hazey dul hay color with some chunks of yeast in the bottom. Massive foamy head rise quick and falls fast signalling high carbonation. The smell is yeasty with a little bit of spice and some tropical fruit. The flavor is mostly tart, slightly lactic, and nicely flavored by the peaches. Most fruit beers I find are very sweet and fruity, but this one is fairly dry and very well done. I could not put this beer down after the first sip. Quenching and quite addictive."
"This beer was ordered at the local Old Chicago. When it first came to the table the roasted golden beer had a good deal of head and reduced to wisps of lacing. The aroma of peaches, and citrus hits the nose. The taste is a surprise as it is a tarter beer then what I thought that they peach sugars would give. Overall a good change within the summer months."
"A real great summer beer that goes down easy and has a light alcohol content make this one of my favorites for an afternoon barbeque or just if you're lookin' for something light."
"D: Haven't had this style before. For that reason, a bit hard to judge it properly. Don't have something to compare it against and not entirely sure what I was looking for in the taste. Though given what I've read about the style it seems pretty close to what the style ought to be."
"Overall it's better than I expected. More sour too. In a day when sours are all the rage, I would expect this one to do better on BA. It's underrated if you ask me."
"Great beer for the summer, I enjoyed it on a gray Portland OR afternoon, but I'll remember to have one next time it is hot. ""A tart Hefeweizen"" Steffie Cheldelin"
"I love this beer for summer. It strikes a good balance between sweet, tart and drinkablility."
"Between festina and aprihop, i'm a happy clam."
"CHEERS!"
"Overall, this beer is drinkable, and the quality is up there with the best sour beers. I like the light body presented here, as well as the playful mouthfeel and bitter fruitiness."
"Dogfish Head's brews are among my favorites, especially their crowd-pleaser Indian Brown. However, the Festina Pêche, though creative and quite different, is a face-scrunching, tart experience that won't be revisited."
"I wish this were available in my state, it is the ultimate summer beer. I'm not sure why this doesn't get higher reviews."
"This is something I'm very glad to have tried and would have again, but not sure how soon. The ABV makes it drinkable, but I haven't had any experience with tart beers at all, so I'm not sure I could drink multiple. Initially I didn't like the beer, but after I took a few more sips and got used to the flavor profiles, I became more intrigued and kept drinking. It definitely has a pretty refreshing aftertaste and feel to it. If and probably when I try some again, I would like to do so in the middle of a hot afternoon."
"I don't really know what to think here. I believe that this may be my first Berliner Weiss, I like it and I am enjoying it. I would like it again, I just don't know how often. Mmmmm. Gets a solid 3.5"
"Drinkable!"
"Overall the tartness and peach flavors are done very well. This beer manages to avoid overdoing the fruit additions which cannot be said for many. Worth a shot."
"Drank this out of the bottle but shared this with a friend who poured it into a glass. Appearance was a white almost pale yellow. Smell was a burst of peach/apple with a hint of watermelon. Nothing faint about the power of the smell... Almost a little to dominating. The initial first taste of this beer is a trip if you have never tried it before. It reminds me of some type of a sour fruit juice. You get a sweet sugar peach taste mixed with a sour apple backbone... quite odd. You cant taste the alcohol at any point from start to finish. Aftertaste is a sour tart malt that doesnt seem to linger and fades quickly. Mouthful is ok if your into sour taste but may not be enjoyable for those who arent. For me, drinkability would be ok but I wouldnt drink more than a 4 pack in a session though... Overall I could see where alot of people would think this to be way to sour or tart. However, being that you cant taste the alcohol, the rating goes up higher. The taste vs price ratio was a little too much for me on this and I dont think I will be buying another 4 pack anytime soon. This is best to drink when really cold... Seems a little funky once it warms up."
"Pours a very cloudly, light pee colored yellow with a two finger head that is very fizzy, not very creamy and disappears rather quickly. No head or lacing is left after a minute, just some fizz around the very outside of the top of the beer. Small carbonation can be seen slowly rising up the beer in the glass. Smells of malts and fruits, very acidic, sour fruits. Peach can be found in the scent too. The taste is very sour of fruits, acidic ones. Some peach can be found once the sour leaves the tongue. Malty aftertaste on this one, definately reminds me of some malt liquor I have had in the past. Kind of tastes like a sour kids drink or something. Mouthfeel is a little bit heavier than water with good carbonation that helps balance out the flavor a bit, still can't get over this candy sour taste. Drinkability is not very high for me on this one due to the taste, the sourness tires me out and I would not wanna experience it too often. No other tastes in the beer make up for it."
"Not bad, not great. I would rather spend the cash on a bottle of 1809."
"This beverage really does have its place and time. Summer, for example, sharing novel beers with friends might be an ideal such setting. It's too tart to pound, or even enjoy regularly, but it's such a unique production that you really want to have it in any versatile collection...typical Dogfish excellence...this time on the weak and kinda girly side of the spectrum."
"Conclusion: Beautiful...fruit...beer..."
"drinkability is not good - i will have to push these onto someone else - not my cup of tea"
"Drinkability: I'd have to be in the mood for a beer like this, but I could only have 1 or 2 at the most."
"D: While the ABV is higher than it should be for the style I can still drink a ton of this and have at certain places. The inconsistency in the bottles really hurts this beers average IMO. Which is really a shame since this is probably most peoples first taste of the style. Nothing beats this beer on a hot day though."
"D- Very drinkable, a great beer for a hot summer day."
"Side rant: If Sam Adams is going to catch hate for using extracts in their beer instead of real fruit, I have to heap some on DFH as well. A little bit of peach in a wheat beer could have been refreshing and enjoyable. Instead this is a peach bomb that I can't believe made it out of the brewpub."
"The peach is neither sweet, not overbearing, and I like that. Just rides along in the backseat occasionally reminding you that its there."
"Taste is peachy and acidicly sour. Wonderful tasting beverage, I think the year in the cellar did this beer quite well. Refreshingly tart, I wish there were more berliner-weiss beers to compare to, but it compares favorably to 1809, although Weihenstephaner's version is better. I am enjoying this much more than I remember last year when I had it fresh. If you like sours without much sweetness, give this one a try."
"Drink a bit too sour for a good session beer hell even for a tasting but I guess it is worth a try."
"I personally find the Dogfish Head seasonals to be the weakest part of their overall lineup. But, of the four, I think I have drank this one the most as it really is a nice summer refresher. Not complex or outstanding by anymeans, this is worth trying at least once. It makes me want to try more of this particular style as it is not very common."
"Run, away from this poor effort."
"Perhaps it takes a few of these to impress it upon you but this is a very big beer, in terms of depth and flavor and purpose. There is very little sweetness in the beer, it is boatloads of sour tartness, with malt underlying and wheatiness coming in for the finish. This is the way they wanted, big, juicy, tart, refreshing, drinkable, complex. I just don't get the negative reviews- its supposed to be a bit thinner than you are used to,but the tart juice creates a big mouthfeel- its supposed to be low alcohol and tart, and to me, that makes a perfect summer seasonal."
"drinkability is great. very fresh and perfectly proportioned, this light, easy going brew has the perfect amount of sourness while not taking away from its other qualities. all this comes together into a dangerously drinkable weiss beer that is perfect for a hot summer day or for a session out at night. cheers!"
"D: I don't believe I will be able to finish off the rest of this 4-pack I bought easily. Every sip I take is one of regret, no offense to the brewery. It is something different; however, it's not a favorite of mine."
"D - I guess if I enjoyed it more, it would be good on a hot summer day. Very light and watery."
"D- This is in it's own way a summer refresher. It would be good to have on a warm summer day or when just hanging out with friends. I don't mind it but would pick something else if I had the chance."
"Its pretty cool that DFH makes a beer in the Berliner Weisse style and add a little something to make it more drinkable( the peach juice)/ Poure kinda hazy and orange with sediment floating in the bottom with almost no head. The nose is sour yet fruity with is very right for the style. I liked the dry tartness that follows each sip. The peaches are really only there to balance the acidity but in no way could you call this a sweet fruit beer. Very refreshing and with a low ABV very much the apertif for the patio party"
"Drinkability is high, can't have too much. Recommended."
"A very complex and interesting beer. I'm not much of a fan of this style beer but it doesnt mean I don't appriciate it. It was very much enjoyed."
"A very interesting beer. Pours like a macro - big and bubbly, pee-golden color, big foamy head without much retention. Like a champagne macro almost, no insult to the high life :p Smells like tart peach, like a jolly rancher. That's what the flavor is, too. A slightly sweet peach-flavored jolly rancher. The tartness isn't too extreme, and coats the mouth nicely. Very light and airy, very drinkable for the summer. I think this is actually spoiled a bit for me, as at ACBF I tried Haverhill's Berliner Weisse, and it just blew the pants off of this one. Though especially for an underrepresented style, it is quite nice."
"This is an interesting, head-turning beer from DFH (would you expect less?). It definitely isn't for everyone.  I'm not a huge fan of peaches, but I'm glad for their presence in this beer because they added some sweetness to cut through the decidedly tart edge of this berliner weiss.  Worth trying, but it is not a beer that I think I would reach for first (or purchase regularly). Don't get me wrong, it wasn't a bad, it just isn't something I would drink regularly - maybe have one occasionally just to shake things up, which is exactly what DFH did."
"Pours a pale yellow, very carbonated. I'm just not sure what they were going for here?? The label says malt beverage with peach flavors. So is it suppose to be like a Smirnoff Ice?? Or more like a fruit beer? To me its neither. Has a very watery feel. Taste of a bad sour candy. Not really any Peach flavor. Every sip is very mouth puckering. I suppose some may like this flavor, it could be ok on a real hot day. But overall this was a drainpour for me."
"Notes: Having this aged is an experience of its own. The tartness and acidity thin out over time and produce a much more complex and enjoyable beer. Also, i prefer the bottle to the tap."
"It felt very light, and watery in the mouth, but I suppose if you can get over the taste some may find it refreshing."
"As far as mouthfeel goes, the beer is pretty consistent with the style. It's light bodied with a high level of carbonation and a dry mouthfeel. It seems just a tad thin, but I can't fault it much for that. Overall, this beer is an enjoyable Berliner Weiss. I love this style and I wish that more breweries would produce it."
"Bone white in color, irregular, pockmarked head of mixed bubble sizes, dissipates down to a thin layer across the surface with virtually no lacing. Prodigiously cloudy flat yellow color, fully opaque. The nose is comprised of bitter grass, wheat germ, white mineral dust, super-sour white grapefruit to lemon pith, barely a suggestion of peach, or any other fruit for that matter, where's Waldo, where's the malts too? Light to medium-bodied, however, so sour that it hardens in the mouth halfway through the sip. Close to bone dry, as a result retains an emphasis on the desiccated white grapefruit, lemon citrus. The carbonation is finely bubbled and has a mostly upfront prickle. Once more, have to ask where the peach flavor is, at best it's like sucking on a peach pit from yesterday. Stony, pebbly, not earthy nor minerally, just sucking on stones. Lots of wheat, raw grains and grass. It is indeed refreshing but if served blindly you would not come close to guessing what it is labeled as."
"Body is light and this is very drinkable."
"I feel as though this beer is really holding back on the sourness for the style. The peach is also not as prominent as I would have suspected it to be - particularly in the aroma. Overall, a very refreshing beer and a pleasant low-gravity surprise from Dogfish Head."
"Bought a 12 ounce bottle as part of a mix-a-six. Poured the bottle into a pint glass. The color is a light straw body with minimal head to it. Festina Peche smells tart, sweet, and a combination of apple and peach in my opinion. Upon taking a sip, the first word that comes to my mind is... sour. I do enjoy sour beers from time to time, so this one works. I also taste some of that peach mentioned in the beers name. Carbonation is there as well. Mouthfeel is tart, good idea to have a glass of water after this. Drinkability is decent, could have another one. This is a good beer and would most certainly be a big step in the right direction if you were trying to ween someone off drinking a "" hard ___"" or whatever those folks at BMC put out with some sweetness to it."
"This isn't anything amazing, but it is a pretty solid, drinkable beer."
"Overall, if you're looking for an interesting take on a fairly difficult to find style, I'd say go for it. I enjoyed this beer for what it was but think that on the whole I'll stick with the gueuze when looking for a tart thirst quencher."
"Bottle Pours a clear straw color with a small white head. The head fades fairly quickly. Produces decent lacing. Has a sour fruity aroma. Has a decent carbonation. The flavor is on the sour side. Has a decent lemon, peach taste to it. Has a dry texture like a tart lemonade. A light body. The finish is strong and tart. Lingering aftertaste is not bad."
"If there is a fault to this beer, it's that it doesn't come standard in six ounce flutes. Both hard to take down and a total delight, this is a cerebral beer that lights an MRI orange and green. It's a thoughtful and thought-inducing beer that tastes like decent Champagne and over-marinated ceviche. Tart as all get out with the taste of granny smith apples, a hint of coconut, and yeah peach, it finishes grainy like any good weiss should. Truth is it's likely too sour for most anyone, reminiscent of tame Lambic. But what I love is the interaction of wheaty malt, citrusy hops, and dry white peaches. You don't drink a lot of this, but what you do is more than beer. It's a message, maybe even propaganda. One you learn from, accept, but don't have the freedom to question."
"I love a nice Berliner Weiss straight or with syrup, and this one is pretty good. It is quite dry, and not as crisp or balanced as I would want for such a low ABV session beer. This should scream out ""drink another!"" but it doesn't."
"I was not expecting to enjoy this beer as much as I did. I am a really big fan of Dogfish Head's brewery, and (most of) their beers, but generally I am not into really fruit-forward beers. For example, DFH's Black and Blue is a truly wonderful beer, but not my cup of tea because it is just too fruity. This beer is not a one-dimensional peach beer, it is instead it's own truly complex style of beer. I am not reviewing this beer while I drink it unfortunately, but I have purchased a 4 pack of these 3 of the past 4 nights (Working at the liquor store has it's benefits.) I will be back for more, and I hope that no one else gets to them before I do."
"D) Good brew. I would drink another. Just hoped for more peach."
"Bought at Total Wine & More in Glendale AZ. Appearance - liked fizz and fuzz when initially poured into hotel water glass, but head died too quickly. Two minutes later completely flat. Nice summery straw color. Smell - I'm getting playdough...or rice crispies and corn flakes mixed in the same cereal bowl. Slight lemon/lime at the finish of smell. Taste - huge lemon blast on the tongue, like somebody took my weiss beer and dunked a half lemon in it...pucker! Light-bodied, easy drinker. Should have had at lunch when was 106 degrees. Definitely refreshing, possibly a bit too tart. Drinkability - poolside in summer sun, yeah sure, why not. Do it again, maybe, but have others that prefer in similar style."
"D: This is a very easy beer to drink and to get into. Light in body, but complex in flavour it would make a great summer refresher. Reminds me a bit of kombucha, except there's booze in it."
"drinkability: a nice easy drinking sour. never had this style so it;s hard to compare. Liked it though"
"d- i'll say that i've never had a berliner weissbier, but from what i've read this is right on the money. i thought it would have more peach presence. this isn't a traditional 'beer' but i didn't really mind. i'm gonna call this a sipper as others have said, one is probably enough for me in a sitting, it's a good one, my mouth just has to get used to the sour, very interesting."
"D- At 4.5%, this beer will make a great summer refreshment with a nice amount of fruity tartness that'll be welcome on a hot day."
"I loved it as a summer sipper, but nobody else I have forced a sip upon has yet--I'll have to keep trying."
"I recommend."
"Decent beer, might be great on a very hot day."
" Seems crisp, leaves a sour aftertaste that makes me crave for water. A bit syrupy."
"Where to start. Piss, lemons and acid. This is a terrible beer. No malt backbone, and taste of lemons mixed with piss. No head and a total lack of carbonation. I have sined and actually poured the rest of it down the drain. Sorry. Next time ill pass on this poor choice."
"D- Extremely thirst-quenching and very easy to drink. Although the ABV is fairly low, I was still blown away by how refreshing this beer was."
"Drinkability: This is a beer made for drinking on a warm summer's day or evening. The lemony tartness and hints of peach sweetness refresh without cloying. Given the ABV, this is a beer you could drink for hours. I liked this beer so much when I first sampled it that I bought an entire case on the spot. My impressions have not changed and this beer is now on my permanent summer to buy list."
"(D)- Refreshing? yes. This is almost has nothing in it that tells me its a beer. Its like alcoholic fruit juice. However, it is a great example of the style it is trying to be and I salute it for that. I want to give it another try and get a much fresher bottle. Over a year of age on this did not do it justice."
"Drinkability: My first of the style and one of the few sours I have tried. The tartness is refreshing, without being overly biting. Nice."
"d: Overall, this is a pretty nice spring seasonal. Certainly something I'd revisit."
"Drinkability: Very sessionable, and this is rare for me to say that about any of Dogfish Head's concoctions, but this is a beer that can be drank anytime, anywhere. The sour taste might bother some people, but I actually think it makes this very interesting and a bit out of the box like the rest of their brews. I can definetley see having this one on the beach this summer for sure! An awesome yet strange brew that must be tried in order to appreciate. Props to DFH for keeping things unorthodox as usual, this is my new favorite summer seasonal!"
"Drinkability: Light, crisp, refreshing. The peach isn't overwhelming, and it balances out well with the wheat. Tartness is also well done."
"D - This is a superb warm-weather beer. Low enough in alcohol to be a perfect session beer, but complex and tasty enough to keep you interested. A must-try for fans of the style, fans of Dogfish Head, or someone looking for a unique summer brew!"
"THIS BEER IS NOT FOR EVERYONE, IT IS SOUR! but at least worth a try"
"D: Very tart, one of these was enough for me. It's oddly refreshing in a way, but still too much tartness for me to enjoy. Not my favorite from DFH."
"D: This is a quirky little beer from Dogfish Head. Quite refreshing on a summer afternoon. I enjoy sour flavors, peach especially, so I liked this one quite a bit. Definitely worth a try."
"The mouthfeel is again a perfect balance between sweet cloying and tart sourness. Very nice and very drinkable, excellent beer."
"This is my favorite DFH beer!"
"Overall: I liked this version of a Berliner Weiss, though I could not have more than one."
"A great example of the style and a fantastic summer beer if you like tart and sour beers. Be sure to swirl and ad the yeast from the bottom of the bottle to the glass in order to impart the yeast complexity and to temper the tartness. Leave out the dregs for a cleaner even more tart version."
"Pours a cloudy orangish-yellowish color, quite hazy and with visible carbonation that looks like seltzer bublles.. smells a bit spicey, fruity with peach obviously, a bit tart and yeasty.. Flavor is fruity and quite tart, above all. Fairly complex, actually. The spiciness and tart qualities create an interesting complexity. Mouth is light-bodied with strong carbonation and that tartness, again, like sweet tarts or such. Its quite easy to drink, especially on a hot summer day.. quite sessionale as long as you like tart fruitiness."
"Granted i had a one year old bottle, but this beer should age well, and its really not that great, if i find it fresh i will try it again, but other than that i don't expect it to be a regular for me."
"Wonderful in the heat, this is simple and refreshing, low alcohol, not a ""fruit beer", easily sessionable."
"Future outlook: Well, I dunno. I don't think Berliner Weisse is a style that I enjoy tremendously as a stand alone drink, but with it's assertive acidic flavoring, I could see it being much more enjoyable paired with some select dishes."
"A pale yellow colored beer. Has an unusual peachy and sour taste somewhat like a cider. Smells alot like a soured peach. Feels smooth to the tongue. Overall it wasn't the most pleasant tasting seasonal I've gotten from dogfish head which still remains to be aprihop."
"I can see drinking a couple of these in a session. A different but enjoyable beer from our DFH friends."
"Notes: Not as great as I remembered...but after a few minutes, most of the funk blows off and it's refreshing and crisp - like peach lemonade."
"D - I could see a stomach ache after a few of these followed by a numb mouth... citrus is all I have to say."
"Great summertime drinkability. Very refreshing. Easily drinkable all day long."
"D: Exceptional. It's low in alcohol and high in flavor."
"Very easy to drink. Very tasty. A great brew for a hot day."
"This beer pours an orange like color with a big fizzy white head. Smells of hints of peach and wheat. The taste is tart with peach flavors and ends sour. The mouthfeel has high carbonation and tingles the tastebuds. Drinkability is good as these go down easy but not great because this one just didn't do it for me. I am not a big fan of fruit beers anyway but this one was a bit of a let down."
"D. Something different for a warm weather beer. Its an ok beer."
"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass. The appearance is a hazy pale yellow. A small white head appears but immediately disappears and is gone within seconds. The smell is sour, and fruity (obviously peach), and just a little sweet. The taste is sour and sweet. It's almost like I'm not drinking a beer at all it has a mix drink kind of taste to it. Goes down pretty smooth though. I'm not huge into this beer but it's definitely not bad at all. Not something I would drink often but on a hot summer day I think this would be very refreshing and I would love to have a couple if that were the circumstance."
"D: I enjoy the taste and the mouthfeel is alright, but the drinkability is not too high. I'd like to try this with some age, as I've heard some suggest."
"Drinkability: Pretty high - drinks kind of like juice."
"Served - 12oz. bottle into a wide tumbler"
"This is the first beer of this style for me. This pretty enjoyable."
"Drinkability: I love the sour aspect of this beer. I think this nails the style. A great summer brew. Sort of like a sunset wheat with added layers of complexity. I will grab another four pack soon."
"First thing I notice was the smell musty smell like it was almost stale. The head didn't really form much at all, was really white and carbonated for a moment in its head. It was really carbonated and when I tasted it it really tasted like regurgitated beer to me at first, but the aftertaste was a really nice peach. I really didn't like this one too much it was alright and a unique beer but it really didn't taste to great, I think the peach aftertase was really the best part."
"Overall - I love really sour lambics, but I have a hard time drinking more than one of them in a session. This is like a lambic light. I might try it again if I can find a fresher bottle. (this one's kinda old, admittedly)"
"It says it uses peaches in the fermentation, but this is no alcopop or Lindemans. A tart, easy drinking beverage while vegging outside on a warm day is the right way to go with this one."
"D: I just don't like this beer. I didn't like ApriHop, either, but for very different reasons. This beer doesn't really have a fruit concentrate flavor. The fruit flavor just tastes a bit like a bad lemon, rather than cloying in any way. I love DFH for experimenting, but they shouldn't force something that just doesn't work. This is all just my opinion, of course. I definitely have no desire to trash DFH. They're good people and make some great beers. Punkin Ale is my favorite pumpkin beer. Why can't their other seasonals be that good?"
"By far, one of the best summer seasonals brewed in the US this year. This beer is a call to the entire brewing industry not to jump on every bandwagon that comes through town. Do something different."
"Festina Peche is an interesting beer. It's above average, but that's about it. Frankly, it's a little better than I expected. But, it's more of a novelty beer than anything. Constructively criticizing it really doesn't seem to be appropriate. This beer is exactly what it was intended to be...a novelty beer with a fruity twist. Taking it for what it is, it's okay. Definitely worth a try. Thanks, Josh."
"Decided to give this brew a try as I have not really had this style in the past. The brew poured to a cloudy golden color with a good sized white head that fizzed almost like champagne. That fizzy head broke down in an instance leaving no signs of foam or lace. The aroma of this brew was wheat, tart sourness, grapes and peaches. The flavor is pretty nice, I like tart/sour beers so this was good. The sourness was not as overpowering as I have had in other styles but it is a little puckering. Nice peach flavor there as well as a nice wheat backbone. Finishes somewhat dry. Not a traditional Berliner by any stretch but not a bad brew."
"Maybe not the best example of the style but quite drinkable and not overpoweringly sour."
"Pours a very light yellow in color. I can honestly say I've never drank a beer this color. Smell is peaches and some smoky/ash notes coming through. It has quite the over ripened peach smell going on. Taste is all peach. Pretty tart/sour. Tastes like spiked Bahama Mama fruit punch. This is candy in a bottle. Quite refreshing and poundable. Interesting beer. Mouthfeel is crisp, refreshing and tart. Decent summer beer."
"Mouthfeel is medium to light with a crackling carbonation. Pretty nice. This is definitely a summer beer (good thing I'm drinking it in Feb...) that would go great with some BBQ. I'd say it could be a little tarter just to make you really remember you're drinking a Berliner Weisse but it's a great take on the style."
"D- Very good if you like sour (I do!) Overall a little more body would make this beer much better."
"Thanks To Kkipple for this wonderful respite during our RIS tasting. The stark white, 2 finger head crackles a bit when you swirl the glass, wonderfull. The hazy golden color is just pretty, there is nothing else to say about it. The aroma is mostly of peaches, fresh peaches, not canned pasturized crap (surprising since they used extract not fresh peaches to brew this beer) It reminds me of summer, and the hint of tartness in the aroma sugests it would be quite refeshing on a hot day. The taste is all tartness, peaches, and wheat, oh so yummy and refreshing. The mouth feel was unremarkable but also did not detract from the beer. I could drink this all day long, and when Im a rich man, maybe I will."
"Pours a hazy yellow-golden color into a goblet, with a thin active head which immediately vanishes. Aroma is quite active with lots of tart fruit, champagne-like aroma. Mouthfeel thin with some good spiny carbonation. Taste is sour orange, tart, lemon juice up front with some crackers, bread toward the finish. I personally don't catch the peach taste others do. The contrasting flavors make for an interesting brew. Drinkability is moderate-good, as this is a beer and a style that has grown on me. I love the sweet and sour character of the brew that melts into bread as you exhale after the sip. I love this beer."
"hmm, this is a very odd beer. I have not had anything quite like it. It pours a cloudy straw color with very little head. Smells of tart tangerine. Tastes of tart tangerine/ peach, kind of like Orangina. The mouthfeel is light and somewhat astringent. I am drinking this on a cold winter day, not exactly appropriate. I could imagine this would be nice and refreshing during the summer, although a little pricey for a summer beer. I'm glad I tried this, always curious about Dogfish Head's oddball offerings."
"I purchased a bottle at BX Beer Depot in Lake Worth, FL. The beer pours very pale yellow color, as was said before, almost champagne-like. There is a very slight haze in the beer. The aroma has a bit of green apple and also again a bit of champagne. The taste is light and slightly mild at first, but then a sourness comes in quickly and really is kind of puckering and almost lemony, characteristic of a weisse. If there is a peach taste there, it is faint. As for drinkability, it is much like eating sour candy, you aren't really sure if you like it overall, you just want to keep drinking it to re-experience the sour zing."
"D: If your looking for a thin summer drink. This may be it, but not for me. I'll stick with New Glarus."
"The body is light and tart. Would like more sourness overall. Overall kind of limited. It's like they wanted to make a berliner weisse and a fruit beer and just barely got both."
"Drinkability is good. I could work through a few of these."
"Drinkability is great. With an abv of less than 5%, a light mouthfeel, and an enjoyable tart sourness"
"D- Dogfish head definitely took a few liberties on the Berliner Weisse Style. I would have preferred the carbonation on this to be much higher. The alcohol is a bit high for the style, but not bad. If you are expecting a peach wheat beer look elsewhere. If you are looking to get into sour beers this will definitely teach your palate what lactic acid tastes like."
"via duffextracold"
"Much different then expected, but it is one of my top rated active bottled beers for the Berliner Weisse style."
"Thanks Greg.. The Festina Peche has been on my wants since it came out.. I just never had the gumption to trade for it.. I truly appreciate the thoughtful extras."
"Might be very refreshing after mowing lawn or walking 18 and a great quencher. But if you want a real beer this ain't gonna cut it for ya."
"D: i would suggest only in the summer...definitely not a winter beer...very light, but too peche for me to repeat often..."
"D - The last peach beer I had was horrible so this one was a surprise hit. I can total see chilling out with one of these in the summer. Very easy to drink and very enjoyable"
"Serving type: bottle"
"This is worth a try just to taste this stle of beer. It certainly won't be for everyone, but those looking for a very drinkable tart/sour beer should love this."
"Overall: The first taste of this beer will put a very topsy turvey spin on your palate. It reminds me of a Lindemans Gueuze Cuvee Rene. I was blown a way by the first sip of this beer. I don't know know where to begin with the first sip. The mouth feel is carbonation with a heavy astringent mouth puckering hit. The finish is bitter with it lasting on the palate."
"Interesting and nicely done take on the Berliner Weisse style that uses the peach character to enhance the fresh and flavorful tartness that is present. The body seems a bit thicker than I would have thought but the crispness of the carbonation more than makes up for it. Nice stuff here."
"8/3/7/3/13 (3.4/5)"
"(rated Aug 1, 2007)"
"D - Even thought the peach taste is not there I really enjoyed it on a hot summer evening...it's perfect for that!"
"Overall a decent beer but I was hoping for a sweeter peach beer rather than something so bitter."
"Cool to find this, refreshing and fruity smell creeps out of the bottle even before the pour. Light yellow with small head. Taste is really overpowering, not in a good way. Tastes tart, fake-fruity. Like drinking an airhead candy. Acrid, tart, powerful and not enjoyable. Never thought I'd say this about a DFH brew, but this a drainpour. Undrinkable."
"Drinkability: This brew was so sharp in flavor that I hesitated to take much of a sip...I drank this selection like a brandy rather than a beer. Not recommended."
"This is a brew that I will enjoy again once the summer months come around. It's definitely something different than your regular old boring wheat/fruit combo. I recommend finding and drinking it fresh, as I found that the flavors were slightly less concentrated as when I've had it within a couple months after it has been brewed."
"This is an insanely refreshing beer. I'm half tempted to just down the bottle in a few chugs because it's that drinkable. Looking at many of the reviews it seems that many don't know what a Berliner Weisse should taste like. I haven't had any Berliner Weisse to compare to besides 1809, but this is some solid stuff indeed and deserves higher ratings than it has."
"D- Good thing I never bought the four pack, the single is enough. I'm glad I tried it, but I don't think I will be buying this again."
"D- Very drinkable but not something I would go quickly on."
"A very disappointing effort from DFH"
"I was not overly impressed with this beer. It's something that would be great on a hot day if I had easy access to this beer, however there are a lot of others that I would be inclined to choose as well."
"m&d: dry and clean mouthfeel, excellent summer time beer"
"This is a great example of the ideal summer beer. It's perfect after a long summer day or a big messy barbeque. It is a staple for days at the beach, outdoor picnics, or a summer camping trip. It would pair well with some chicken or spare ribs on the grill, and the low alcohol content allows you to enjoy a few without having to worry about it catching up with you too quickly."
"Peach sourness was noted."
"also a good stepping stone beer for those wishing to dive into other beer styles, people who enjoy sour's and witbiers and lots of other people should be into this one"
"One note--this is the only Berliner weisbier I have tried so therefore cannot rate with the style in mind. I was somewhat surprised as I expected more sourness, although for what it is this beer is quite refreshing and enjoyable."
"D: Very good. A delightful session beer for a warm day/evening."
"D= Though this is not really my cup of tea, I can appreciate the skill involved here. Another extreme (tasting) brew from Dogfish Head, but unfortunately one that did not suit my tastes."
"Not too drinkable for me. This is my first berliner weiss, and lacks the good sweetness of a belgian sour- it is just sour."
"Crisp in the mouth, but I don't see anyone wanting more than one of these. They get points for staying creative though."
"D) This beer fits the realm of being very drinkable, perfectly suited to the Berliner Weisse category, despite it's addition of peach (not quite traditional to my knowledge). The peach, however being the main character, this is suited to a nice summer beer, or in my case, perfect for an Indian summer day late in October."
"It pours a light yellow color with a huge head... 3 - 4 fingers of head, so much head I had to let it settle down to pour the rest of the beer in. But the head went down pretty quickly. The smell is more sour then peach, the peach is slight. The taste is incredibly sour up front. You get a lot more of the peach as the sour / tart finishes and then in the end you get a lot of carbonation that helps to kill some of the sour. Overall refreshing once all the sour clears. This is different and surprisingly a drinkable beer."
"D- easy enough to finish, but i dont think id like more than one of these in a sitting, and i wouldnt like them very often either."
"Might drink another, might enjoy it with the cobbler. Might put some in the cobbler. It couldn't hurt. It's not bad, just....peachy!"
"Down the drain she goes. Dogfish Head seems to hit plenty of doubles & home runs, but this is definitely blowing a 7-0 lead on two grand slams. Yuck."
"As a fan of Dogfish Head it pains me to say that I didn't like this beer very much. The aroma was pretty lacking and by that I mean that it didn't seem to have much of one, which I have to say was a little bit of a disappointment since it said peach on the label. I liked the tart and sweet flavor at first, but the more I drank of it the less I liked the sting that the tart taste brought to my mouth. It was not something I would have had two of in succession by any means. Perhaps this would have been better enjoyed in the spring on a warm afternoon."
"Anyway, if I lived anywhere I could get this regularly, especially in July, well, you know..."
"Notes: My first thought was that this tasted like a Colt 45 with a blast of sour peach flavoring but after my second they started to get a little better appreciation for this beer."
"My only complaint is that they release it a little too early (late april-early may) and there isnt any left for the hottest months!"
"Eric"
"Pours a very golden color with a rapidly diminishing head (as per style), and no lacing at all. It has a very wonderful scent, a nice crisp and bright wheat scent with wonderful tangy overtones and a great peach undertone, not dominating at all. Great taste, a very clean and refreshing wheat beer with a nice tartness and slight peach flavor, all well balanced. Good mouthfeel, slightly carbonated. This is a great drink, and I'm not even a fan of peach."
"Glad I tried it - but probably won't get again."
"I love almost all of DFH's offerings... but I would not drink this again even if someone paid me. Tastes like an alcoholic fruit juice, not a beer at all. I see a previous reviewer compared this to a watered down pink lemonade.. which is very true. It's way too sweet and sour and is tough to drink. It was hard for me to finish the bottle. I'm glad I only bought a single of this as the sweetness kills it."
"I was so put off by this beer that I took time to write this review and it is the only one I have ever posted. And, for the record Dogfish Head produces several of my favorite beers including the 60 minute IPA and the Punkin' Head."
"Very crisp and dry with refreshing acidity on the palate. The peach is really a background not ein the finish, and the brew is very tartand dry. I have not had Berliner Weiss in Germany, the only other I have tried was yesterday, the New Glarus unplugged version. This brew is similarly crisp and tart, refershing, but the NG stuff had more interesting complex aromas and flavors probably due to the yeasts used. The DFH FP is crisp and nice, quite drinkable and refershing, but fairly simple, although certainly not a run-of-the-mill brew. Good effort."
"Overall: I like Dogfish Head, this must be their one crappy beer."
"Drinkability- Quite quenching. Would have this again for sure."
"The refreshing qualities of the beer give it good drinkability despite its high sourness."
"D: Nothing I would drink in multiples or recommend."
"Somewhat drinkable, but the annoying tartness reallly decreases the drinkablility. When compared to NG's unplugged berliner weiss there is no comparison. The festina really lacks both the subtlety and complexity displayed by the NG unplugged. If you like chewing your vitamin C tablets i would recommend this brew. Thankfully I do, otherwise this would be finding the nearest drain."
"Update: I picked up a 4-pack from a different batch and it poured with a very thin fizzy head as others have experienced."
"Pours a hazy pineapple color into a tulip glass. Nice acidic, sour smell, very fruity and and slight funkiness. A very sour brew, bright taste of citric fruits and a very subtle, but noticeable peach flavor. It's lip-smackingly tart and refreshing. Very dry on the finish. Crisp. Light on the tongue. A bit sour to drink many at a time, but was very good. Another great DFH brew."
"Drinkability is alright. Not my cup of beer but worth a try. Won't drink it again."
"Drinkability: Easy to drink, a good summer beer. This is one of my current favorite beers"
"Absolutely a ""love it or hate it"" beer, I happen to love it."
"As said early down this thread, this is a hero-beer of beers for a hot day."
"T/M- Very tart initially with a very odd, thin but grainy wheat texture, very bright with moderate carbonation. Acidic with notes of lemons, orange skin, sour grape and some citrusy hop character. Very sour when cold but it grows almost rancid as it warms. Light bodied, semi sticky mouth feel and leaves a numbing feeling on the tongue. Do I really enjoy this beer? or do i hate it? Decent drinkability, i must say im a fan of sour..."
"you could give this someone having trouble bridging the gap from white wine to beer, or vice versa. Might be very nice with certain foods (grilled fish, fresh salsa?), but not something I could deem worth drinking solely on its own merits. this might be a good example of the style and be what it's ""supposed"" to be, but if that's the case the style itself could use a serious retooling. (for me it's not enough to say milwaukee's best should get an A+ as it is an A+ example of the piss beer style--the piss beer style is an F idea and so the perfect piss beer is still an F beer!) that said, there was enough to like here for me to suspect there are better examples out there and that the style is just fine."
"very sour with the peach kiss at the end. extreamley dry, not the best product from dogfish head. i dont ever want anouther one of these, this is by far the most sour beer i have ever had. the mouthfeal is like sucking on a lemon, your mouth instently puckers."
"Cloudy yellow with initial carbonation that dissipates quickly. Lemon juice aroma with peach, obvious by reading the bottle. Get ready for the peach attack, it latches on the tongue and doesn't let go. A beautifully experimental beer that seems more like a fruit juice than an alcoholic drink. Wonderful for afternoon drinking in the summer time, a real treat. Light bodied, ultra sweet, and zest make for a truly original beer."
"D- supreme drinkability, the best fruit flavored beer i've ever tasted, minus 1/2 point cuz its a real heart-burner."
"People, understand what a berliner weiss is before you start knocking down the rating of this otherwise quality beer."
"I really enjoy some of Dogfish Head's beer and some of them I feel are overdone, Festina Peche, being an example of the latter. I think there's just too much peach in this beer. In smaller amounts it would be very enjoyable but as is it tastes like peach juice at certain times."
"Obviously, I didn't like it. I can drink some of these fringe malt beverages and not hate them, but this was just sour."
"Pours a murky yellow color with a quick fading white head. Aroma is malty and grassy with just a faint hint of citrus fruit. The beer tastes very tart and tangy with lemons and peaches and a touch of wheaty malt. Very acidic and tart which masks anything else the beer may have going for it. Nice attempt at something different but this just isn't good."
"Pours an oddly fizzy pale yellow, with slight cloudiness and a decent fizzy white head that dissipates very quickly. Nose is some peach and some slight wheat. Taste is suprisingly tart with some peach juiciness and some very slight wheat. Mouthfeel is tart and very dry. Drinkability is good for the tartness, but not what it should be for a summer slammer. An ok brew, but nothing really incredible. Interesting thats for sure, reminds me a bit of calabaza blanca, with the whole tart yet refreshing kind of spritzery feel. Try some, it might be your bag, baby, yeah!"
"Don't really enjoy the style, although I'm glad I tried this. One bottle was enough for me."
"Some people like it, others don't, but give this one a try."
"This beer is dry and light, but far from watery. Tingly carbonation. Very refreshing. Not my favorite, overall, but a great summer beer. Could be enjoyed in the blistering noon heat, or in cooler summer nights. I hope to see this beer next year."
"The beer poured a hazy straw-yellow with a thin white head into a pint glass. I detected a slight peach aroma. The taste was very tart and fizzy, with peach/lemon flavors at the forefront. All together a light and refreshing weissbier, great for a hot summer's day."
"This is a curious one, a beer 'brewed with peach concentrate', a Berliner Weisse style. This is a very rare style (only two breweries in all of Berlin still produce it!) characterized bi intense tartness and it can be compared to a Flemish Sour. Poured off the tap at American Flatbread (thanks Diora!) a hazy golden yellow. Aromas are wheat, lemon and some peach notes underneath. Flavors burst forth, very crisp and tart, lemons, green grasses, lemon basil, semi-sweet, notably sour but not overly so as some Flemish are. Reminds me of sour, green apples. Light body and fairly easy to drink. Sharp but on the money. Unique summer offering in a nearly saturated market, bravo!"
"12oz single bottle purchased for $2.20 from Wine Emporium in Boston. Bottled in May 2008, consumed in July 2008. Pours a very pale colour, virtually white when held up to light - more white than a typical Belgian wit. Zero head - virtually flat. Weak aroma with a hint of peach - which I doubt I'd place if not for the name. First taste is sour initially, quickly giving way to not much of anything. Not complex nor enjoyable."
"This beer pours a cloudy pale orange color. The head is small and recedes quickly into nothing. The aroma is of peach with a hint of sourness. The taste is more balance than the aroma. It is quite sour, but mellowed out by the peach. The aftertaste vanishes quickly which is unlike any other Berliner Weiss I have had. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with a lot of carbonation. Overall, this is a decent beer. As far as Berliner Weiss go there are better ones out there, but this is still drinkable."
" I keep coming back to this seasonal from Dogfish Head and believe I will continue to do so."
"I was wrong about this beer, just as obi wan was wrong about anakin. Move along"
"A peach beer that doesn't taste like peach. I've never heard of this style, but from what I read it appears to be spot on. However, this style appears to be an acquired taste as I don't find myself wanting to pick this up again in the near future. Go get this if you are a fan of the style, or enjoy sour beers in general."
"Drinkability- It is nice a change up and very refreshing."
"Not a style I'm familiar with, but it fits the description of the style dead on, so I have to assume its a good example of the style. Light and refreshing a decent drink for summer."
"overall-An interesting beer that I did not like at first but it did grow on me. I give DFH credit for trying something different, but I do not think I will purchase this again."
"Not much to look at, no great taste, and too sweet to be refreshing. If this is a top example of this style I'll be steering clear in the future. I did try to adjust my score as the description of this style lines up pretty well with this beer."
"Mouthfeel is kind of minimal but does have some body to it, fizzy carbonation is definately a put off. Glad it was only a four pack."
"Pale and hazy lemon yellow tone. Thick white head. Lace is moderate. Nose has got a little peach and some sour apple on it as well. Tart and acidic from the start. Sour green apples come to mind. Some lemon drop nuances come and go. Sparkling carbonation. Medium body. Really not overly acidic or mouthpuckering. This is a pretty good drinker. Not much peach in the flavor, but good nonetheless. Not a style I'm very familiar with, but I like this one pretty good."
"An subpar sour beer with a low drinkability. There are better sours/summer wheats to be had than this one. Not accustomed to this coming from DFH."
"D - A good beer but to sweet and tart to drink more than 1 at a sitting."
"Pours a hazy yellow color with a white head. In the aroma, wheat like tones and a small peach tartness. In the taste, peaches, small sugary, wheaty, and a small tartness. A tart bite, and light bodied mouthfeel, and a dry wheaty aftertaste. A nice summer like beer, nice small tartness, and a nice small peachiness."
"Damn. Wasn't expecting that. I'm impressed. Skinny lil body but packs a sharp cut. Helluva tart, lemon, peach, and high pitch hard candy. Cools me down and summer humidity aint shit. Beliner-Weiss; ressurecting endangered styles and bringing comfort from the elements. Spanks good."
"I absolutely love DFH beers but this one just does not do it for me."
"overall not that bad, never had this style before, i enjoyed the tartness."
"D: I could drink about a dozen of these without a second thought though my throat my close up from all the lactic acid and sourness. A great beer for a hot day, a real peach...sorry."
"Although the beer seems to be a fine example, the acidity of it just took the drinkability way down. I recommend you try this one for yourself."
"d: great beer for the summer. pretty tasty, but like many dfh offerings, it doesn't seem to live up to expectations (or the price tag)."
"Pours a light straw yellow with one finger white head and minimal lacing. Nose- apricots and peach. Taste- tart with peach sharpness. Has a certain graininess to it. Finishes clean and minimal aftertaste other than grain. Fruit not overdone nor sweet which is appreciate. Easy drinker- high carbonation. Quite refreshing."
"D: This one's gone in record time!"
"D: This is a very tart brew. A great alternative to lemonade after a long day of working in the heat. I imagine the tartness would get a little old, but still an enjoyable brew. Another good brew from DFH."
"D: Festina Peche is a refreshingly tart summer beer. However, it's fairly intense and I couldn't see myself sessioning this brew (or drinking more than 2 in a sitting). Still, DFH has brewed yet another unique, interesting, and quality brew."
"Pours with very little head, aroma is citrusy, wheatlike. First sip and what really hits is the dominating tartness of this brew. Heavy carbonation stings the tongue, slight flavor of peach is present but overwhelmed by the tartness. Any sweetness is clobbered as well. Color is a hazy light peach skin color. An interesting brew, but I can only drink one of these and I have to move on to something else. his would probably go pretty good with some hot, spicy jerked chicken."
"D- A little rough for me I think I'll pass next time."
"Okay drinkability, refreshing and light."
"D: I enjoy one and thats about it, every couple weeks"
"Like most, my experience with the style is limited, but enough to know I've tried better German examples. And although I find DogFish Head to be a fanatically innovative brewery that often writes cheques its beer can't cash, I don't think that was the case here. I'll give them credit for this one, they pulled it off."
"very crisp and light bodied, mild and clean tasting. lots of carbonation in the mouth. there is a strong peach flavor up front but it tones down quickly into an almost empty flavor. pleasant light aftertaste."
"I'll choose to try and forget that I ever stopped at this exit, if you know that I mean."
"This beer poured absolutely no head and left no lacing in my pint glass. Large bubbles could be seen floating to the top. The color was a hazy gold. The aroma was very sour with notes of peach coming through. The peach became more apparent as the beer warmed. This brew was very tart taste-wise, but quite plain. There was some sweetness at the tail-end of each sip and there was absolutely no after-taste. It was very smooth and soft as far as mouthfeel goes, but felt heavily carbonated on the first couple of sips. I'm glad I grabbed a four pack when I had the chance, but this beer didn't do much for me. I could see this being an awesome lawnmower beer on a hot summer's day."
"D - Pretty drinkable summer beer. I'm not sure how well I could session it, but low abv and crisp flavors make it pretty drinkable."
"The sourness was much more than expected and made it hard to be a sessionable brew.Sorry, but not my cup of tea."
" I'm sorry to say this was actually a drain pour city. I'm surprised and dissapointed, abd DFH is not a company I'm ever not satisfied with. Oh well."
"T/M/D - it has a light, spritzy and surprisingly sour taste, with mellow hints of peach and citrus. This is a good beer to sip on a hot day!"
"Overall a well executed 'neo' Berliner Weisse with a pleasant and well placed peach overtone.  I've had a fair share of authentic Berliner Weisse's through the years, and this one keeps the pace with their traditional tart/sourness that have made them world renowned.  I believe DFH has done this style proud.  A beer that you'll either really like or hate.  I really likey."
"It was easy to drink, but I was also drinking more to get more glasses. If I were looking for something easy to drink on a hot day I would go for this."
"T: This is only beer I have had of this style, so I don't have a basis to compare this to. However, this beer has always struck me being very refreshing and enjoyable, though not necessarily a great ""beer"". Flavor is dominated by sour/acidic peach flavor on top of a wheat/wit like body with some lemon and earthy flavors. Finish is slightly bitter. Active carbonation over a medium body results in a very clean refreshing beer. Obviously not for everyone, but not necessarily as bad as some make it out to be"
"Overall, it is a decent beer. Certainly interesting. Not great, but refreshing on a hot day. If you like something ""different""...sort of like a Saison...then it is worth a go."
"To style, but not for me. The tartness makes it really hard to get through the pint, but I'm sure some love it."
"Very good summer brew. Not my favorite, but on a hot day this may be a darn good choice."
"I don't seek out light beers or weissbiers, but this is the most enjoyable example that I have encountered. 5 out of 5."
"D. Good on a hot summer day, but one is enough for me."
"Wow! Taste is a tart, crisp explosion of fruit that delves into the land of sourness. Tooth-squeaking tart, in need of only a bit more carbonation to be the citrusiest (sic) soda pop ever. Tangy, to say the least, but in a way that would make it just perfect, somewhere, sometime... I just can't imagine when, or where. Bone dry finish."
"Yellow color with a well developing, but then quickly diminishing foam. Nose shows some light malts, some funky character and lemon and peach aromas. Flavor is well balanced between the sourness and peach character. Goes down easy. I could see myself craving this once in awhile."
"D - Easy drinking, but maybe a little too tart to consider tipping several back on a hot summer day. Low alcohol, good and unique flavor. Despite its lackluster appearance, I would recommend trying at least one bottle of this."
"Not my thing here. Maybe I just wasn't ready for something like this, but it doesn't even taste like beer to me. I may consider trying again, but not for a while."
"On-tap at Raleigh's Flying Saucer in a DFH off-centered pint glass for me to keep. Served a hazy pale orange with a thin head that quickly diminished to nothing. Aroma was some peach and slight pale malts. The taste was an extremely sweet abundance of peach and sweet malt, almost reminiscent of over-sweetened lemonaid. A rush of sourness follows in the finish. The beer is very light and crisp with a bit of carbonation. While this beer may be decent on the back porch on a hot Summer day, it doesn't seem to do as well in a well air-conditioned bar."
"Festina Peche is one of my favorite summer beers. It is great on a hot summer afternoon. The bartender (a newer one ) didn't pour it prefectly, it had almost no head. It's color is almost light straw with a slight hue of orange. The tart aroma welcomes you before your first sip. Low carbonation but astringintly sour and tart, with a slight hint of peachy sweetness. There no hop presence but who need it with it being this tart. The tartness is reminisant of granny smith apples and grapefriut, with a big wheat base. I love this beer but I cant have more than two, because it will upset my stomach."
"Ordered a pint while taking a break from the summer heat. The body is a hazy yellow and there's a short, white head. The aroma is musty at first, with wine-like sweet peach and bread. The peach is only a slight taste on the palate, with sharp, acidic lemon and sour bread with a touch of white pepper and spice. This is a great"
"D - This beer is very different but I find it interesting and a worthwhile project. It's not for everyone but my love of Flemish Reds makes me appreciate it a bit. Not sure I could make it a regular though."
"12 oz bottle: Aroma is sour lemon and peach off the first sniff. A subtle wheat texture with a more lemon than anything into the scent. Pours a cloudy light yellow with a huge white head that lingers around forever it seems. Taste has a sour acidic taste to it. Definitely similar to the other Berliner Weisse that I've tried. Some wheat characteristics intermingled with an, oh so, light peach texture. Overall, I thought peach was going to be a more substantial contributed to this brew. As a Berliner it lives up to expectations, but I wish there was more of a peach flavor in this brew."
"The flavor opens up light and airy, with a purely summertime feel. If this isn't refreshing, I don't know what is. The carbonation is effervescent, yet mellow and finely bubbled. Lightly flavored green apple tartness with the essence of peach. The flavors intermingle effortlessly, finishing off with barely a trace of floral hops and refreshing fruity sourness. Excellent, interesting and unusual. Who makes a berliner weisse in regular production? I could drink the four pack on the back stoop in one sitting, easy."
"D - Many many great qualities... Unique and and a true gem in the otherwise predictable realm of summer seasonals... This is my favorite summer beer hands down..."
"Had this on tap at the Moan and Dove. The head of this drink diminished almost immediately when it was handed to me. Pale, murky and dull yellow were the main attributes in the drinks appearance. The aromas had a slight spice to them; an almost herby flavoring. The taste was very sour in a fruity way. Strong lemon flavors. Practically no body or carbonation; I felt I was drinking lemonade. Overall, I liked its lemon flavoring potential, but its lightness made me feel I was not drinking any alcoholic beverage."
"Mouthfeel is light to medium with a definite crisp snap to it. Drinkability is fairly good on this one. The sweetness is all that would keep me from having many over and over. The ABV is amazingly low for a DFH offering, and this is a great refreshing and drinkable summer beer."
"Flavor is quite unique. I can't say I truly enjoyed it, but the style is what it is, so I merit DFH for that. Shock-tart sourness hits the front of the palate while a champagne-like bubbliness envigorates the whole mouth. Pale malts and wheat form the base to this beer, whose body is quite thin and exceedingly well-carbonated. Finishes sour; not exactly refreshing, but it's kind of fun to drink. I probably wouldn't have Festina Peche again, but I'm glad I tried it."
"M/D - Very well carbonated with lots of energy in your mouth. A light, crisp mouthfeel. Just not a taste I like so I dont see myself drinking this one again."
"Brilliant! to quote Guinness.. A real Berliner weisse is so tart, so mouth-puckering and light, you have to have had a few and understand the stly to like it. This is why younger Berlin generation drink it ""mit schluss"" or with a splash of fruit syrup, to cut the bitterness. Dogfish has created this mix in a bottle. Nice light peach aromas, light on the hops, some lemons, yeasty weiss. Good aromas for the type. Flavor is a tart peach sour-Jolly Rancher i the mouth. Peaches, light yeast, sour peaches, slight hops, peaches..see where Im going with this. Not peachy, but tart, crisp, biting with a peach effervescence. Mouthfeel is light crisp, highly enjoyable twist on a traditional brew"
" This Nerliner Weissbier pours a cloudy pale gold with little to no visible head and lacing. There is no aroma of peaches as I'd presumed I'd smell. It does have a delightful mouthfeel tons of hidden carbonation. The taste, bland at best. The peach flavor is only at the very end as you swallow. There are none of the esters that other wheat beers usually have. I would gladly drink this as a session beer long before any BMC product, but thats out of respect for Dogfish Head and all that they represent and do for the craft beer industry, not so much for this particular beer. Overall, not impressed."
"D: ""UNDRINKABLE. I hate this beer."" Again, that is what I wrote before knowing what a Berliner Weisse beer actually was. In a sense, there is much validity in our initial reactions. I was startled and shocked by this beer. I couldn't see this coming. However, I now must consider what the brewer intended for the beer. It is pretty good. I would have another, with maybe some of that syrup added, like it says on the style guidelines. However, this is my least favorite beer style out there so far."
"They were right when the label said that this beer was tart and unique. Unique is always good in my book when it comes to beers, but this one didn't do it for me. One is more than enough for me. If you like beers with the taste of lemons, then you should give this one a try."
"This is the first beer I have had from dogfish that I did not love. I'm not even sure i would call it a beer...poured with little to no head, seamed to be a bit over carbonated, and did not have the kind of beer taste that most fruit beers have. The taste was on the tart side and was almost sour. I was also expecting more on the nose...didn't really get the peach smell i thought would be there."
"I am surprised by the lack of sweetness here, it really is much closer to sour. I can see the hefeweissen comparisons but this is more like one of those ""radler"" half-lemonade half-beer combo jobs they sell in Germany. I like the texture and crispness, particularly in this ridiculous Carolina heat, but the taste is too sour and ""un-beerlike"" for me. I can't see a sixer of this in my future."
"Not a bad summer beer, however it's drinkability suffers due to it's overwhelming sourness."
"D: A fairly drinkable beer. Peach taste is evident, but it is not overbearing, so that makes this beer fairly easy to drink. Definitely a nice representation of this style."
"Drinks pretty easy, the tartness really quenches the old thirst. Not a style I'm crazy about, the German Berliners I could stand with out the syrup, so although not really feeling or tasting peaches, I do believe they help. If there's a tastier take on the style I haven't had it yet. I am sitting on 1809, so we shall see..."
"D - Despite the very low alcohol content (4.5%), this is as far from a lawnmower beer as a DIPA or an Imperial Porter. Best enjoyed leisurely."
"The taste starts tart, unripened, fruit, peaches, sour grapes, lemon tart flavor abound with a bready malt sweetness of honey great play on the tartness actually pretty brisk highly carbonated refreshingly tart with a mild balanace making this a playful beer."
"Not too bad of a beer overall, but nothing that blew me out of the water. My first experience with this style, to my knowledge. I'd love to try some more examples of the style."
"Drinkability is moderate. Low alcohol and decent flavor makes for easy consumption. The flavor is so simple and beer is so light that I could easily drink several of these."
"D: I found this intriguing. It was quite dry but still had an interesting flavor profile. It was light yet still rather satisfying. This is one of those brews that is probably one of the more unique flavors I've had in beer but still enjoyed. Honestly, I don't think I would want to drink more than one at a time but it is good just the same."
"D: Very drinkable as it is a nice summer beer."
"Smell is tart, peachy, sour. Interesting. Taste is similar, acidic and sour, tart and a dose of peaches. This is good beer and well suited to summer weather--I would drink it all day if I could. Definately recommended."
"D- I drank this beer a lot slower then that of other styles. It was a bit on the tart side for my taste. But as far as this style went it was good."
"D - adding something sweet makes this a thirst quenching treat."
"D - Wow, I'm sad to say this is the first DFH brew that I don't like, it was hard to not make this one a drainpour. They can do better than this..."
"I know this is a weissbeer, but with the peaches and all this was a little too sour for my liking. A little too dry and the bitterness drowned out some of the fruitiness, unfortunately, but still went down reasonably smooth. Overall, I don't think I'll really go for this again."
"This is certainly a departure from what I'm used to. Interesting I guess, but I'm not all that excited about it."
"Refreshing stuff, but certainly not Dogfish's best..."
"Drinkability: Not enjoyable enough to want more. This is unfortunate because I like the idea, peach is an interesting fruit for beer. Coupled with a bit more citrus, less tartness and more wheat would have been nice."
"Not impressed by this beer. I do always have high expectations from Dogfish Head because they have great beers. But this one was a down the road pale ale with peach concentrate in it. Simply put not worth 10.99 for a 4 pack. Good thing I got a pint glass out of it."
"There really wasn't a lot about this beer making me think it was past it's prime aside from the slight paper aroma, but I would like to try a fresher one. Perhaps my lack of percieving any real peach character beyond a faint whiff in the nose is due to fruit flavors not holding up for long periods of time. An interesting beer that I'm glad to have had, but Berliner-Weisse beers won't be at the top of my ""to explore"" list."
"Taste & mouthfeel: Much more sour than the nose implies, this tastes exactly like what you would expect from a peach-flavored Berliner Weiss. Sourness is mild, and a hint of sweetness from the peach resides underneath. Light-bodied, dry in the finish, infinitely drinkable."
"D - Drinks like a Berliner Weisse with some peach flavor. Quite refreshing, actually. I was expecting more of a fruity affair, but the sourness was quite pleasant."
"Poured into an oversized wine glass with ½ fingers worth of light ruby white head that fades to absolutely zero! Cloudy yellow color and smells of grapes and peach but as soon as the head is gone I couldn't detect these smells any more. Very acidic tasting and felt like I was drinking water with lots of lemon juice in it although after the bitterness faded away I did find a extremely small hint of peach. Judging by the bottle I though I was in for a sweet peach cobbler of a beer but looking at the style category on BA it fits perfectly. I'm not quite sure how I feel about this style of beer, interesting and one I might try again?"
"Smells of tart citrus. Kind of surprising, as I expected a sweet brew. Taste has green apples, sour unripe pears, and citrus zest. Very little sweetness to it, and almost no caramel malt. A good brew, and quite unexpected. The mouthfeel, as with most Dogfish Head offerings, was nice and chewy."
"i think this beer has its place though not exactly what i expected"
"P.S. Had the wife try it, prefers fruit beers, but this one was a thumbs down for her too."
"D-Very drinkable and refreshing. A very nice American take on this underapprecited style. To me this is a wonderful summertime beer....lovely. Plus, at only 4.5% you can truly enjoy it!"
"Interesting, but not enough for more than the 4-pack I bought."
"Lightly tart, bit of an acidic punch, but not too sharp. Actually pretty creamy and smooth despite the apparent high carbonation. Very drinkable and refreshing. Surprising."
"While I would never drink this odd little ale on a regular basis (even with easy access), it's good for what it is. Dogfish Head doesn't always hit everything out of the park, and there are some errors now and then, but it's always interesting to see if what they throw against the wall sticks. Festina Peche sticks."
"Nice belgian yeasty mouthfeel. Almost a sour lambic or flemish red in it's bite. Really enjoyable and unique."
"bottled in '07. Poured into a snifter poured a bright and pale yellow. The smell is faintly tart giving off more of the tartness you would get in a wheat beer like a wit. Overall it has very refreshing qualities. The acidity seems on the lower side and the peach taste only comes through fainly. Really like a citrusy witbier that finishes with just a touch of tart sweetness."
"If the fruit inspired malt beverage is up your street, give this a try. Though I wouldn't suggest getting anything more than a single."
"Definitely not my thing. This beer has its redeeming qualities - it's true to style, and it comes close in a few departments to hitting the mark, but I had a little trouble finishing it. If sour is your thing, give it a go."
"An interesting premise and offering from a brewery that has been consistent with ""extreme"" beer styles. Unfortunately, this beer is not their best example. The beer pours with a nice head atop a straw body. The taste is what hits you with an almost lactic aftertaste. A little apricot flavors shine through but primarily it is the sourness that dominates this beer. A summer style indeed, not one for those who are not adventourous in their beer styles. This Berliner Weiss is a very acquired taste."
"D: Too sour for me. And the peach is not very apparent. I have had and enjoyed Berliner Kindl Weisses, and I was using that as a judging point. It just did not compare. I think I will give it another try this year."
"Very pale yellow, and cloudy appearance, with explosive and rapidly dissipating carbonation. Probably authentic looking, but not a look I care a whole lot for. The smell was pretty much nothing. I was expecting to get some peaches on the nose, but nada. The taste was quite a sour treat. The lemony acidity was up front and center. The fruit that was missing from the smell was much more evident in the taste. Not easy to make it out as peaches, but clearly quite a fruity beer. As light and airy as a Lambic in the mouth, and very refreshing. I am surprised that beers like this are associated with cold and dreary Berlin This would be more at home on a sultry July day in Georgia on the back porch."
"Pours to a mellon rind greenish yellow colored body. Creates an almost white head that erupts to two fingers showing a nice amount of carbonation. Nose is like smelling the skin of a fresh peach just before you take a bite. You also get noticeable hints of tartness. That same tart feel transcinds right to the front of the tongue as you take first sip. The sour feel meets up with the malt to create almost a flemish sour or wild ale effect. This one is not as harsh as some of those sour bombs are though. It is much more drinkable for my likes. A mineraly, malty hue is left on the buds for a unique mouthfeel of sour, thick and dryness. I was expecting something more sweet but this was a pleasant surprise."
"Bottle sent by DrBayern - I had been wanting to try this for a long time and finally acquired one through trade. Poured this into the closest glass I had to a ""bowl"" style glass. Looked a hazy yellowish with no head. Kind of Hoegaarden-esque. Smell was very underwhelming with some very faint perhaps peachy smells that I wouldn't have picked up if I didn't know what it was, along with an almost skunky yeast smell. Very unique to me as it was also my 1st of the style. Taste was dry very bland peachy flavor up front, followed by a noticeable tartness in the mouth and then a definite wheaty finish to it. Very different, and although drinkable, not the easiest beer to enjoy. Perhaps just the style, but this lacked almost any sweetness at all and as a result almost none of the flavors were brought out very well. Extremely mild and tart."
"All in pretty good but not the ""peach bomb"" that I was expecting."
"I could defintely drink this beer, it has a great finish, great for the summer."
"dessert brew. Sparkling, dry, and a little fruity. Good. Not great."
"D: a little too tart, especially for the middle of winter...i wouldn't mind having one or two of these on a hot summer day"
"Overall Impression: Very different, a good summer drink. Funky lemon juice."
"Too intensely tart and champagne-like on the palate, even for a lighter summer offering. Almost like a faux-lambic; artificial."
"4 pack in Ft. Oglethorpe, GA for about $8. Very nice light yellow hay color with little head. Not much in the way of smell, mostly fruit. Taste is tart starting with a peach flavor and quickly moving to a sour lemon which didn't really bother me. It was actually quite unique. Mouthfeel is fizzy which I didn't enjoy at first but it started to grown on me about halfway through. Drinkability was good but I couldn't drink many in one sitting. I'd have to say if I was going to drink a fruit infused beer it would be Pyramid Apricot Ale before this one again."
"Drinkability- A delicious, refreshing beer, another good offering from DGF."
"The beer poured a light straw color with a constant stream of bubbles and a tiny bit of foam at the top. The scent was a bit overpowering, it smelled like very syrupy peach concentrate. However, the taste was much lighter and the peach flavor is actually quite subtle. This beer is a bit tart and has a very dry finish. I thought the taste and mouthfeel was similar to a chardonnay. This is my first experience with a peach beer, but I liked this one. It's drinkability was high and the pleasant peach flavor makes it a nice spring beer, or a light beer for earlier in the day."
"When decanted carefully from the bottle, this one poured a very clear pale yellow with fizzy, white foam that formed a thin collar. It showed little stickage and there was a constant stream of bubbles rising to the surface. With the remainder of the bottle added, there was just a slight haze to the beer. The aroma was full of peach flesh sweetness backed up by noble, sulfury hops. The flavour was pretty intense, lemony sourness with a lighter peach character. There were some floral hops that were apparent for a moment up front and peach/sour really lingered. Very light bodied, approaching thin, with plenty of fizzy carbonation. The sourness really was like a punch in the face and the peach didn't cut through it that much. Still, very interesting and sort of refreshing. I'd definitely have it again - it's quite an experience."
"This beer is hard for me to compare as I have not had many in this style. Worth a try for something unique..."
"A cloudy light yellow beer has a very small white head that disappears very quickly. The aroma starts with a nice light wheat character with a light sourness in the background and a hint of lemon.A light sour tang hits your tongue first and on the finish there is a soft wheat note. Not much fruit flavor if any, but I understand that is normal for the style. Light and refreshing is what it should be and that's what it is."
"Sweet and bitter at the same time. Definitely a change of pace from the run of the mill brew here. I didn't dislike it but I don't know that I'll spend money on this one."
"This is nothing like any weissbier i've ever head; calling it that is somewhat of a misnomer. That being said, if I'm not thinking of it as a weissbier, it's pretty good. Extremely easy to drink, I'd probably enjoy it more if it wasn't so damn cold right now!"
"Served chilled in a pint glass, from a twelve ounce brown bottle.Poured out a hazy golden straw color, with tons of carbonation bubbles streaming up from the bottom of the glass. A good finger of bright white head rose up in the glass, and somewhat quickly faded. Left traces of thin lace behind. Nose was of thick, astringent peach concentrate, wheat, with some sour aromas. Taste was strong with manufactured sour peach. Loads of wheat and some yeasty notes. Finishes smooth, crisp, and clean. Plenty of carbonation. What little alcohol is in here is undetectable. Nice smooth, light bodied mouthfeel. Nice and refreshing with great drinkability. A nice change to the Dogfish line up."
"Pours a fully clouded straw. Nose is mild with a slight metallic tone to it with a slight bit of wheat yeasty funk. The flavor is where it's at here. Tart rules the day with an obvious peach influence with what seems like a fair amount of lemony goodness mixed in. Tart and smooth. Gives a very balanced flavor ride. Feel is a bit thin on the liquid with a nice biting carbonation. Overall extremely drinkable. It's a damn shame I bought a four pack of this. Geez. What ever will I do with it."
"Nothing something I could drink more than one of in a night but a nice refreshing taste for a nightcap."
"This is an ok beer. It poured a light gold, but tasted like a very, very heavy pinot. Not any hops flavor present, and the peach flavor was somewhat hidden by a high level of carbonation. Perhaps that's what the flavor profile required, but this was a little too sour for me. I guess I'm just not a fan of Berlinner Weisse beers."
"The beautiful freshness of the wheat was completely overpowered by a horrible tartiness that made this beer completely undrinkable. I actually had to ask the waiter to take it back and request another one. She then replied that most people there generally never finish it. The mouthfeel was nice, however - nice and fizzy and refreshing. But it couldn't overcome the fact that I couldn't stand the taste."
"Mouthfeel is on the lighter side but it has a good creaminess to it with plenty of carbonation. Quite a refreshing brew that I really enjoyed drinking this past summer. The low abv makes it great for the beach and a nice session. Overall, one of my favorite new Dogfish beers as of late. Well worth a try."
"12 oz., bottled on 5/31/07. It pours a radiant, cloudy, yellowed gold hue, with medium carbonation and a thin, bone-white head. Smells fruity and sour, with tart wheat, lemon, peach and maybe some banana. The flavor is quite similar - acidic, sour and tart, with no residual sweetness, and hints of dried peach and apricot, banana?, a touch of leafy hops, and a big backing of yeast and nutty wheat. The body is light and dry, with high carbonation and a fleeting finish - very appropriate, it seems, for this style, and quite refreshing. Overall a good summer beer, but don't drink it too cold as you will miss out on its nuances. The wheat is quite flavorful in this one, and the beer is very refreshing, but I think a touch of sweetness would add even more to it."
"Pours like a hazy lemonade with a one inch fizzy head that broke into a thin, patchy cap. Nose is (surprise) peaches! Also more fruity yeast notes. Taste is very tart-- like a fruity white wine with peaches thrown in. Taste is more like peaches as it warms, but the extreme tartness overpowers it. Very effervescent (I should have poured into a flute). In general, this ""malt beverage brewed with peach concentrate"" wasn't for me."
"Drinkability-- I'm working on getting up enough courage to take another ounce of the stuff. Greatly disappointed in Dogfish on this one."
"Poured into nonic pint with a think white head. The beer is pale yellow, slightly cloudy. The aroma gives a hint of the tartness to come. The taste is indeed very tart. If you aren't expecting this it could be a shock. I don't detect much peach flavor. This is a very refreshing beer that I enjoyed through the summer. It's great after finishing up working in the yard. The low ABV makes it a very sessionable beer. I had a couple left in the refrigerator that I'm enjoying now rather than keeping them longer. They've lost a bit of the check sucking tartness of the fresher botttles but still enjoyable. Will look for this again next year to enjoy during the dog days of summer."
"Not what I expected but not bad."
"D- I can see where this would be good to drink during the summer but I doubt I will have another."
"I highly recommend this beer, especially for newcomers interested in learning about the versatility of beer. Drink very cold."
"Drinkability - one of the more drinkable beers for me with any element of funk to it, but not something that I will seek out. This is supposed to be part of a 'fruit basket' line-up for my mom and sis, I'm considering either removing it or finding a peach syrup to put in their baskets as well."
"An excellent summer beer (80+ degrees here in Baltimore on 10/19/07). Not a big fan of fruit beers, but this one is very subtle and quite well done."
"Festina Peche is a very crisp and dry weissbier. If you enjoy tart beers, this one's for you. Overall, fairly enjoyable. Not sure it's something I could drink more than one of it a sitting, but it's a nice change of pace beer."
"D- This is a great and refreshing brew."
"Grabbed a four pack of this beer last night by the sheer fact that there was still some around, and I had only had the opportunity to sample it once this past summer. Pours a hazy dull yellow, with a head that quickly fades away in to nothing. Lots of air bubbles rise to the surface of this beer also. Smell is of tart fruits, I was thinking more along the lines of green apples than peaches. Taste starts off very puckering, with the tart fruit (almost lambic like) and then ends on a somewhat dry biscuity note. Mouthfeel is light, yet has a nice bite of carbonation to even things out. Can't say I am all that impressed with this beer. I am sure the fact that I am drinking this beer on a rainy cold night also does not help its case. Either way, an interesting choice for the summer months. Cheers"
"This beer is a hazed pale yellow color with a thin white head that dissapears almost immediately, leaving a rather sad, lemonade-ish drink. Minimal lacing. The aroma is mostly peachy with touches of citrus and musty malt. Lightm fruity body with tart peach and wheat flavors. Very little sweetness which would help a lot here. The finish is fruity and short, leaving a sour fruit aftertaste for a moment. Nothing worth revisiting here."
"D: Fairly unique which I appreciate in any beer. It would make a good summertime brew, but Im not sure how quaffable it is. Too hard across the palate and too sour to drink many of."
"Overall not for everybody. However, if you arent afraid to try something unique give this a shot. If I find some I will get all I can"
"I tried this beer at the Night of the Funk Belgian Beer Fest. I normally don't write reviews on beers I try at fests, but it was early in the night and I remember the details of trying. There was not a single facet of this beer that even remotely impressed me. Not much smell, taste, or anything really..."
"This is definitely different. I actually like the peach characteristics, especially the way it smells, but it's too tart for me. I really don't think I could have a second if I tried. Definitely worth a shot, though, if you are looking for something different."
"PS: Lord, this review sure sounds like Im a beer snob asshole. I guess this is why online beer reviewers get a bad rap."
"After the second pour, I notice some sediment in my glass but it isn't adversely affecting the flavour so I'm down with that. Pretty refreshing brew. It has a light body and the carbonation is medium. It finishes right where it started..sour. I like it. Thanks, John. It's different but I favour the difference."
"D. Very drinkable in hot weather. A definite chick beer."
"Wow. It definitely has peach in it. While I happened to enjoy this beer on a chilly evening, it would be perfect on a warm day. It's light and crisp and not at all watery. The colour is alarmingly yellow and pale, which made me proceed with caution at first. The smell is fruity but not too sweet, a little ester-y (like overripe fruit). The taste makes up for this: it's obviously got a peach kick to it, but it still tastes like a beer, even if the peach flavor is pretty tart and a bit syrupy. The mouthfeel is average, nothing to complain/rave about. I would recommend this as more of warm-weather drink, but if you come upon this on a cold day- enjoy it anyway."
"Honestly, if that is your style just go with one of those disgusting zima or smirnoff wine coolers."
"I have to admit I was completely unaware of what to expect, and while waiting for it to come I was wondering what Pêche meant. It presented a light golden brown, very cloudy, and smelled very strongly of lemon and orange citrus. The taste was similar to its odor, but the very first thing I noticed was the heavy carbonation. It was enjoyable, but a little fruity for my tastes; it called for a spring day and a back porch, but not the hot wings I was eating."
"D: Extreamly drinkable hot summer day beer. Clean tart finish leaves you wanting more."
"D: Not drinkable at all to me. Maybe it would have been more appropriate on a warm summer day but this is too tart and sour."
"Pours hazy and pale yellow with a smallish head. Aroma is faint wheat with some citrusy tangy aroma. The taste is mostly sour peaches. Perhaps just a touch of hops in the finish. Light wheat base. Sourness is really the dominate aspect. Light bodied and very heavily carbonated. Wouldn't want to drink very much of this. Overall it's just a bit too sour with too little real peach flavor or anything else going on to balance it."
"D: Not really my cup of tea ...er... beer, but it seems like it may be on for the style. One of these is drinkable, but I can't imagine drinking any more than that."
"Cheers"
"Overall: Thanks go out to Himerman for hooking me up. This beer is great."
"Thin bodied and highly carbonated with a dry finish this is the perfect drink for a hot summer day, very thirst quenching. And I definately appreciated the low ABV, a great beer to have with lunch"
"Pours a cloudy pale yellow color, awesome carbonation, the head was HUGE took me a few minutes to pour, some sticky lacing follows. The nose is yeasty, malty, spicy, and sour/tangy. The taste is sour/tangy for a Weissbier, but that's DFH for ya, LOL, yeasty, slightly spicy. The finish is slightly dry. Medium body. Drinkable, not a bad brew, but would not seek out again."
"Departing the 12 ounce brown bottle it appears nontranslucent pale yellow with a creamy white head that evaporates slowly and the lace forms an even coating on the glass. Nose has a pleasant fruity aroma, with hints of malt and a little yeast, quite appealing. Start has a light to moderate malt presence, with the top light to medium in feel, sweet at the front, with a pleasant bit of tanginess. Finish is moderately acidic, a touch of hops noticeable, sweet to the end with a dry and lingering aftertaste, a pleasant change from my over the top hop and alcohol laden beers."
"Pours a cloudy ultra light straw color with a shallow foamy white head that fades quickly leaving little lacing. The first wave of the smell is ""OK this is a wheat beer"" followed immediately by the significant ""...wow! this is going to be sour"". Light bodied, the mouth feel is refreshing, sour and moderately carbonated. Big taste, the sour lemon flavor is quite intense. Low ABV, this ain't exactly one to throw on a hefty summer time post many hours in the yard thirst. It's a sipper."
"The taste is different. It starts out nicely malted, but when it's mostly down, it had a nice tart bite towards the back of the mouth. It tastes lemony, but that's probably just the tartness. There's a hint of peaches and other fruity flavors. This is definitely a different kind of beer, but still good. You can't taste any alcohol, though at 4.5%, you shouldn't. It's very refreshing, great for a hot summer afternoon. It goes down easy, not too much carbonation, not heavy... it's just right. Unless you hate tart fruit flavors, this is a very drinkable beer."
"It's not stunning or amazing, but the coy crafting and complimentary components are quite crisp and considerably refreshing. It's about as drinkable as Gatorade on a hot, sweaty day, minus the electrolytes of course, but with a fetching little buzz for the effort. In short, it makes for a rather unique and worthwhile session beer."
"Drinkability - A smooth easy drinker that would do wonders in the summer. Definetly unique and worth a try."
"Dogfish Head seems to always impress me. I've had a number of their beers and while I may not like all of them, they are brewed with a desire to be different - to take beer to another level. This beer is no different & it is quite good. Cloudy & vibrant yellow in its color with very little head to speak of, this brew's aroma is reminiscent of peach lemonade. Already this is an ideal summer beer with a look and smell that exudes sunshine. Sour is the first thing that hits the tongue followed by new peach flavor - the ripe peach sweetness is missing. Mouthfeel is similar to a soda or an Italian soda, which is not bad in this instance. If it wasn't for the dominant sourness, I could drink this all summer long. A very interesting beer. Recommended."
"Poured from a 12 oz. brown bottle marked ""bottled on 6/1/2007"" into a pint glass. Appearance is a pale opaque straw-yellow, thin fizzy cap of whitish foam, quickly dissipates to moderate lacing. Aroma is light, comprised of a light yeast/breadiness, tart green apple, subtle malt undertones. Taste is also tart green apple, nice balance between apple and peachiness, fades into a light biscuity flavor, finishes dry, slightly sweet/acidic tinge. Mouthfeel is light bodied, medium levels of carbonation. Drinkability is solid, would limit to two at the most due to tartness. Would purchase again."
"Pours a slightly hazed yellow, thick tight white head forms, sparse lacing, head disappears down pretty quickly. Smell is peachy, bit of tartness, light malt, citrus, honey sweetness, kind of spritzy. Taste is very tart, nice sourness, moves into a caramel/vanilla oat middle, tart peach in the finish, very dry. Mouthfeel is light bodied with medium to high carbonation, really lively, very refreshing. Nice beer, tart peaches really linger."
"Color is a hazy yellow, with almost no head and a definite ""fizzy"" sound while it is poured, like you are pouring a soda. The nose is primarily fruity, with the scent of peach. Taste is a nice blend of tartness and fruity sweetness, although it tastes a little watery. I could see how this would be refreshing on a hot day; perhaps I'll appreciate it tomorrow a little better while I mow my lawn..."
"Poured a light cloudy yellow. The smell was light and floral with a faint peach scent. Tasted crisp but I expected much more of a peach flavor, it has some mild hop flavor and a hint of citrus. Goes down well, especially with the warm weather. I would recommend trying this, but it's definitely not my favorite DFH nor of it's class."
"D: Very refreshing and thirst quenching--it's the best of the Continental sour ales mixed with summer's finest fruit."
"D: Although I am not a big fan of anything with a peach flavor, this beer was still a little tasty, goes down easily, not filling at all, this beer seems to be what many fruit-flavored beers try to be. If I liked peaches, I would have enjoyed this beer more, but even so, it was still pretty decent."
"Overall impression: Nice different beer - I was glad to see this in a four pack. It is definitely different than anything else I have seen offered in bottles from an american brewer."
"Pours a bright yellow, thick billowy white head, fades fairly quickly. As you would expect, peach smell is predominant, along with some yeasty/malty notes. Taste is very un-beer like, i'd call it Peach juice with club soda. Mouthfeel is very fizzy and carbonated, with a little fruit syrup stickyness. Drinkability is quite good, the flavor isn't offputting, just not too memorable. A solid offering from dfh, but certainly not thier best."
"Pours a rather pale yellow with a thick but not persistent white head. Aroma is fairly strong and malty with an overtone of peach. Flavor is malty with a nice alcohol edge and sweet peachy hints, as well as some cidery peach in the aftertaste. It feels a little thin but edgy, and goes down the hatch smoothly and subtly."
"Overall, a pretty one-dimensional beer (peaches), but enjoyable. It's almost like a carbonated fruit juice."
"This one had a white-yellow color, cloudy, white head disappeared fast as lightning, never to return again .Smell is a little sour but taste is also slight sour peaches, I can almost feel the fuzziness. Mouthfeel is very juicy, nice beer and the best Ive had from DFH in a long while."
"Like other DFH beers, it doesnt make a bold statement with aroma, but with how it is their summer seasonal that make all other summer seasonals look, taste, and feel like just you normal average everyday beer. Thanks for the great beer Dogfish Head and I hope to continue to enjoy off centered ales for years to come!"
"Had this one at Ashley's in Ann Arbor, MI, on tap. Poured a light straw with cloudiness and a touch of white head on top. Nose was an interesting combination of more standard wheat beer aromas and a smooth peach in there as well. The flavor had me a little more; the peach is extremely subtle, along with a lot of wheat and some spiciness. Definitely not your standard fruit beer, which often seem to be overpowered by their single fruit flavor. This one was much more drinkable and complex. I'd have this again, for sure, even though the fruit beers have never really blown me away."
"Carbonation is high, fruit flavor restrained. Refreshing, incredible mouthfeel."
"Drinkable, but I am not running back to get another 4 pack"
"Not really familiar with this style (or sour beers in general) but I see this one as a fairly good ""novelty"" beer.I had it on a cool crisp late summer day, probbly would have appreciated it more if it was hot out. Pours and looks like a hefeweizen, cloudy straw color with a fizzy head. Most hefes have a more impressive head, but with a hard pour, this one provides an impressive enough white head. Smell is mildly malty with a hint of the peach syrup. Leaves some lacing on the glass. The peach flavor is blended in very well. This is not a style I would ordinarily appreciate, but the potential for peach syrup in a beer was done as well as I think it could be done. Some initial maltiness followed by a mild peach and slightly citrusy flavor. Neither the sourness or peach sweetness were overpowering or annoying. Mouthfeel was crisp and rich enough for a light summer beer. Drinkability for me is not high, a couple of glasses of this flavor would be enough and it is not a high alcohol beer. That is more my personal taste in beer styles than anything derogatory about this brew. For those that like fruit beens, this one is not bad."
"Drinkability: If you like sour beers, give this a try; a nice change of pace"
"Bottom line: A summer quaffer by the folks at Dogfish. I like my fruit beers a bit more in your face, personally. This isn't a bad beer, but it's not flaunting the peach enough for my taste buds."
"D: A pretty good shot at a unique, rarified style. I've had a few and this is nearly right on. It is almost too tart though which over-rides all else. Rediculously drinkable w/ a shot 'o syrup on a hot summer day. Pretty good."
"Although you probably wouldn't want to drink two or three of these, you definintely owe it to yourself to drink one!"
"Certainly an interesting attempt, but too sour. and does not taste much like a beer. I found this one hard to enjoy. Likely won't revisit this one."
"Pours a very cloudy glowing gold color with a big white fluffy head that expectedly dissipates quickly due to the higher than average acid content. Smells of apple juice, peaches and brett. There's also a kind of lagerish aroma present as well. Not sure how to describe that, but it just smells similar to a pilsener. The first sip is quite tart and very refreshing on a hot day. The peaches are more prominent now, as is the green apple flavor. The sourness is spot on, and is my favorite aspect of the beer. This is my ideal summer brew, and I'm sad that this is my last one. It's still drinking great so maybe I'll pick up another 4 pack. I wish there were more of this style on the shelves right now. Hopefully we'll soon see more american brewers take this on as time goes by."
"D: Medium: High if you like this beer, but low for me, Ill pass on this one again."
"Bottle courtesy of SS: Poured a cloudy bright yellow color beer with a big huge pure white foamy head with good retention. Aroma of tart malt with a hint of fruit sweetness. Taste is quite tart but not up to a lambic level with some light fruit sweetness. Body is about average with some great carbonation. Im not sure what to make of this one or really to expect since I know so very little of the style. I sure couldnt have tell there was peach in there and would have loved more tartness but that just me."
"I was pleased with this beer, a very nice changeup to the hoppier IPAs I usually frequent, and even a nice turn from my hefe's. I wish the peach were a little more assertive, but a very nice beer."
"Pours a murky pineapple juice color with no head or lacing. Smells a little funky with some citrus. Taste is very tart. Sour, some citrus and a bit of peach. Thin in the mouth with little carbonation. Good drinkability but I wouldnt be able to do more than one of these as a tart treat."
"Wish I'd had more of this back in June and July!"
"Pours a cloudy golden straw color with an average pure white head. The smell is of rust, concentrated lemon juice. green apples, not all that appealing. The taste is of concentrated lemon juice and soda water, extremely unripe peach, though not positive as I never had what I assume might be a green peach. Just an overall puckering taste with no relief. I really don't taste any peach, just an overpowering lemon flavor. The feel is light and very fizzy. The sourness drys the mouth and is cloying. I actually contemplated drinking a Bud to offset these flavors. This is my first try at this style but I don't enjoy it."
"Overall: Interesting to say the least, this is a unique summertime brew. Can I say TART again?"
"drinkability: meh"
"Pours a pale yellow color, like pineapple juice and slightly opaque. Little bit of foam on this one but retains a nice ring. The aroma is of malt, and tart, citrus fruits. I get lemon, pineapple, apple, peaches, a little spice and a funkiness. The taste is quite interesting to say the least. It has a tart start but a sweet peach finish. The mouthfeel is thin but that makes this refreshing. Im glad I got to try this one. I like it, Im just not sure if I would seek this out again."
"Drinkability- Even after all that sweet and sourness, I still hold the claim that this is a very easy drinker that gets better as it warms up. Finally I shy away from the hard strong brews I usually drink and have something smooth that I can enjoy in a session if necessary."
"This poured a hazy white yellow with a moderate head. The smell is of lemon and of course, the peaches. The lemon dominates in the flavor giving it a light and sweetness that finishes with noted sours hints. Original, and interesting but nothing mind-boggling here either. It's greatest feature is certainly its originality."
"The feel was rather refreshing and clean, with a light body and mild carbonation. I'm going to go out on a limb and say I was unprepared to taste this, simply because I am really a rookie to this style. I did enjoy it and hopefully will grow to appreciate it and the style more. Another impressive brew from DH."
"Pours a lightly turbid pale yellow with a thinnish white head. Aromas are all pretty subtle and are that of unmalted wheat, limestone, traces of pitted fruit and a light barnyard yeast funk. Flavors of underripe peach skin with the appropriate tartness, a light mineral background, tart wheat and a faint grass-like hop. I can certainly see how this is classified as a Berliner Weiss. Tart peach flavors are a nice complement. Light bodied, clean and zesty; a good palate cleanser. It takes me back quite a few years when Nodding Head's Berliner Weiss was flowing at the brew festivals, yet with a nice, tart addition of underripe peach. This has got to be Dogfish's lowest ABV beer, but it reads Sam all over. Good stuff."
"Very drinkable beer and well made beer."
"Pours a cloudy golden orange with little initial head. This fades to nothing very quickly and leaves no lacing. Still, a pretty beer. Smell is all peach nectar with a background of Berliner Weisse sour. Taste is similar, but a bit more sour comes through on the beginning as well as some floral bitterness. After that it is all peach nectar and some slight saltiness. Mouthfeel is a little heavier than I usually like my Berliners, and not quite sour enough either. Still, quite a refreshing and an interesting summertime quaffer"
"Lots of carbonation, too much for my liking. This is definitely a summer time beer with the light abv, tart mouthfeel, and refreshing qualities. I don think I will try this again but I am glad I did try this the one time."
"The flavors are light in this beer so it's also very easy to drink. Not the worst and not the best. At least it's creative."
"wonderful summer beer, tart and refreshing and without a huge ABV. Beers like this make DFH great. I hope it is made every year, much more enjoyable than their other seasonals imo."
"Drinkability: Superb. This beer is meant to be consumed en mass. Lots of flavor and easy drinking lead to happy times. Another great step in a new direction of beer by Dogfish Head. Crafting a session beer that is in the vain of the Belini, IMHO. Great job."
"Nice attempt from an American brewer. Its hard to classify this beer. A sour taste but easy drinking on a hot summer day. Above average but not by much. Then again, there is nothing to compare it to? I wonder if peach fruit would give it a less sour/acidic taste? Only Sam knows!"
"Cripe, Im glad I only got 2 bottles of this overpriced ($2.50 a pop) sour peach soda  geez, only 4.5%. I would have kicked myself in the sack for buying this, but Im no longer that agile."
"An interesting beer. Berliner Weiss is a strange style that takes some getting used to. I wish the peach flavors/aromas were just a touch higher, though, because I don't notice them at all."
"Cloudy pale yellow color with some very thin head that leave minimal lacing. You get a nice mild peaces smell right off the bat with this one. This is followed by some faint barnyard odors that hint at the tartness that is to come. The taste hits with the tartness right away but it's not lip puckering. It's a nice blend of wheat malt and fruit tartness that makes for a nice drinking summer beer. The peach is always there but never overpowing. Also, can that be possible, DFH at only 4.5%. This just shows that they can brew a great beer without having to go over the top big. A one of a kind beer that is worth seeking out just for it's uniqueness. I enjoyed this one tremondously."
"This is a really nice brew for the Summer season; light, refreshing, fruity, simplistic at times, it really captures the essence of a hot weather refresher. I could easily have drunk a couple pints of this on this 100°F + day."
"Draught @ DFH Rehoboth: This one pours a hazy, straw yellow color. Mine had pretty much no head on it at all. It has an interesting aroma. Sour peaches, some spice, grassiness and maybe a touch of a champagne aroma. You had better like tart offerings if you are going to drink this one. The taste is mainly tart peaches, but not overly puckering. Some spiciness along with it. A very interesting and good beer. It went well with my crabcake sandwich that I had for lunch."
"Extremely drinkable but only the bitterness might build after more than two."
"D- pretty solid, a great summer beer for quenching that sour beer need without going to the really sour lambics and geueze's very enjoyed"
"The acidity reminds me of a cider, and I am not a fan of ciders. Maybe this brew is a very good example of a Berliner Weissbier, but I do not like this style."
"This was very yummy and went down in a hurry. In fact, I had to pop back in on my way home the next day just to have one more. I'm going to try to pick up a case of these for my next bbq, even if the tartness turns off lots of people, I for one will be sucking them down like they're going out of style. And with the low ABV, should be able maintain no problem."
"It was interesting to try, but I won't get it again. It needs more peach flavor, for one, and for another... well, I don't really know. I'm not familiar with the Berliner Weiss style, so I can't comment on how authentic it is. I'd recommended giving it a try. I'd also recommend drinking it pretty cold, as I believe that might enhance its drinkability somewhat."
"I can't fault it for deviating from the style since this is the only one of this style that I have seen available. Just an interesting and refreshing fruit beer."
"Okay, I'll grant that Festina Peche lacks a bit on technical merit and isn't exactly the epitome of a Berliner Weisse, but on it's own, it's just a tasty beer and I hope to see it again next summer."
"(another view) http://jbojangles.blogspot.com/2007/07/beer-o-moment-dogfish-head-festina-pche.html"
"This one is a nice drinker with a pleasant scrub of carbonation throughout. I drank a few of the se yesterday and will do some more tonight me thinks."
"Pours a very pale gold color with very thick white head that leaves considerable lacing in the tall glass. The nose is of light wheat malts, some florals notes and a decided tartness. I don't detect much here that would identify this beer as having peach flavor if I didn't already know. The palate is quite light, refreshing and lively. Wheat malt, yeast and considerable sourness. This beer finishes very dry...and very tart. Light body and tartness make this beer quite refreshing and super easy to drink. A potential summer classic?"
"Mouthfeel is light bodied with a bit of a bite from the tartness, and the drinkability is good, with the low abv only helping in that area."
"This beer poured a hazy straw color and formed a small foamy white head that left trace lace as it subsided. A medium amount of carbonation is present. An aroma of wheat malt and peach. The flavor is of peach and wheat with a lot of tartness to it. The finish is very tart, the body fairly light with some spritz quality to it. A good session beer."
"This is a very refreshing beer and very drinkable. It pours a very cloudy pale yellow with not much head, decent carbonation, no lacing or head retention to speak of. The smell is citrus, tangy, lemon, peach. The taste is clearly peach, but it is subdued, and there are plenty of other things going on in this beer to make it interesting. You have a very tangy citrus, orange, almost spritzer taste, with peach on the top. The mouthfeel is all fizz, and summer ade. This is a very nice, light, refreshing summer beer if there was one. It is light bodied, although not watery, and has little aftertaste once the fizz in the mouth wears away. I like it. L'Chaim."
"Bottled on 06/01/2007. 12oz bottle poured into a pint glass. Pours a pale and cloudy yellow color with a white head. The aroma is a little faint with some malt and peach flavors. The flavor is very tart with bitter citrus flavors and not much in terms of peach. The mouthfeel is puckering because of the tart flavors. Overall, I am not much of a fan of this brew at all. I find the taste to be offensive and overly sour for what it is. I like sour beers (lambics and flanders red) but this one does not do anything for me."
"poors a hazy straw color with a finger and 1/2 of head that dosent stick around very long. The smell is an odd colection of straw and a bit of fruit. The taste Is allot like the smell at first, but goes into a good peache flavor, which is very tart. This is deffinatly an interesting brew, one sip i love it, next sip im not so sure. Overall a refreshing beer, and a good depature from the average summer seasonal"
"Drinkability: A peach of a thirst quencher!"
"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a shaker. This beer poured a super cloudy golden color with a very fizzy white head that slowly faded away. The aroma was grass, lemon, white grapes, and some bready wheat notes. The flavor was made up of white wine, lemon, and some light peach flavors. The mouthfeel was light and crisp with solid carbonation. This would make for an excellent summer drink on a hot afternoon. Light and refreshing. Overall, I found this to be another interesting experiment from Dogfish Head. Im not sure that I would go out of my way to find this beer again, but it was nice to get to try it."
"This is a very refreshing brew and is perfect for a hot summer day. There is not much of an actual peach flavor, but I love the sour citrus flavor it has. I would get this again in a second, another great brew by Dogfish Head."
"Drinkability - This is my first in the Berliner Weissbier style. This came based upon my positive experiences with Dogfish Head products in general and the affinity I have to lambics and Flanders Red beers. Overall, this was a great experience and one that I would revisit."
"D - Extremely thirst quenching and summery. A unique brew that is somewhere between a really mild lambic and a twangy American wheat beer."
"It's a good beer, just not what I had hoped it would be. It's not overpoweringly sour, but there's not a whole lot going on besides that. The finish is dry as hoped, but it just reminds me of apple juice."
"Pours a cloudy, almost neon yellow color. no head remains for more than a few seconds. Smell is a strong peach (big surprise right?), maybe a little grape. Taste is very tart, and heavy fruity. Limited carbonation on this one. However, it kind of reminds me of drinking a very bad bottle of champagne."
"All in all, a crazy departure from the normal DFH offerings and dang fine weissen. Not as overdone as some of their other sour/fruit offerings, and more true to one of the old world beer styles."
"Thanks to the low ABV, I could definitely put away a few of these on a hot summer day like today."
"Found a four pak of these at Jungle Jim's in Fairfield, Ohio. Yeah! Pours into a goblet a hazed pale yellow with a small white head that quickly vanishes without lacing. Aroma of fresh cut lemons and a basket of South Carolina peaches fifteen feet downwind. Light body with spritzy carbonation. Taste is citrusy sour in a fresh lemon sort of way. Faint wheat notes and some subtle peach pulp. Really nice on a hot summer day. Tempted to bring out the marmelade for this one. Nice rendition by DFH of this interesting style."
"Also, I am interested if anyone had a similar experience."
"Notes: At $9.99 a 4-pack, this is not one I'll be buying again, but I was glad to give it a try. Interesting and different."
"M&D - smooth and crisp, yet after half a pint, the beer gets kind of harsh, the acidity is a bit much and makes the last few swigs hard to handle, but the flavor acuracy and beer quality itself is good, DFH walks that thin line betwixt genious and insanity like a Wallendo, great job"
"Picked up a couple 4-packs at Jenny St. for $8.99 a piece. Pours into my Sam Adams glass a wit like bright white peach color with a thick and bubbly white head that rapidly dissipates. Aroma is wheat and peach with hints at tartness and the potential for aging. A sense of vinegar. Tastes clean, crisp, light, and tart in a purposeful and carefully crafted way. Hardly any peach flavor, more general tartness and lemon then anything else. Some wheaty cereal notes. Heavily carbonated and very drinkable. A great summer time beer. Refreshing."
"Hazy straw yellow with a fleeting smooth white head. Woody, musty aromas covering the lightly sweetened tartness of the peaches. Every time I take a whiff, I get vague memories of my childhood. It really reminds me of a place, possibly my old attic...I'm not sure, but I'm getting 80s flashbacks. Peachy sourness immediately washes over the tongue along with more wood and wheat. Funky lemon acidity. This is growing on me...I'm amazed DFH has the balls to do something like this. Dry, sour mouthfeel, relatively light in body making it easy to consume despite the funkiness of it all."
"overall: I think it was a good idea, but they just missed the mark here."
"Overall I would buy a case for a summer cook out if it was easy enough to find. I drank mine last night while studying for a state exam and passed this morning with flying colors. Thanks DFH!"
"Gave this one a second try after a week or so. Still just weird. Im going to see if I can pawn off the other two."
"Poured up a pale yellow colour with a big, white, loosley knit head that faded away in about 45 seconds. The body of the liquid is rather cloudy with some very fine debris/particulates floating about. Smell reminded me a bit of BMC, but with a mild, but certainly noticeable fruit profile. Taste, too, was close to BMC, but again, there were other characteristics present to off-set this. I found this to be quite sour, actually, and somewhat pleasant. If you like gueuze, saison, and/or flemish sour ales, you'll probably enjoy this, as well. Not a whole lot of CO2 in this one. Body is quite and rather refreshing. Finish is sour and dry at the same time. Very drinkable."
"Weihenstephan probably does a more true berliner weiss but I think the non citric spin on the fruit in this beer does a lot more for this beer's overall drinking experience. Another slam dunk by DFH IMO."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 3/4"" bright white head over the slightly cloudy light golden (yellow?) brew. Head fades gradually, with average lacing. Aroma is moderate intensity peach with sedate wheat character. Taste starts lightly sweet, and then kicks in with the controlled tartness, which is quelled at the close cleanly. Mouthfeel is smooth, esp for the style, and drinkability is excellent, slaking the thirst nicely. Fruit here is understated and adds to, doesn't dominate, the experience, the way it should be."
"Pretty drinkable stuff, definitely an easy drinking quality. Must admit this is a pleasant surprise."
"Very enjoyable summer refresher."
"A slightly sour brew tainted with the succulent taste of peaches. Upon cracked open this one it seemed to be very carbonated after a few refreshing sips the carbonation diminished and the head disappeared. As with most fruit beers, i believe its the acids from the fruit that make this happen. An excellent brew and one of the best offerings, i can only hope that this will make it back on the seasonal list for next summer!!!!"
"Dry with a sour peach aftertaste that fades to cardboard. It was good for something different but I only wanted one."
"EDIT - Nothing heralds the Summer to me better than this beer. I've been longing for this, and it is at its prime fresh. My favorite DFH beer and by god, the only beer I love straight out of the bottle. This is one tasty beverage."
"D - Seems pretty drinkable, but I have a hard time being objective on this one. The peach character is as good as I could expect it to be in any beer, but once I started drinking it I remembered that I really don't like peaches. It seems like a very well made beer, but I can't really say that I like it."
"poured from bottle in a slender glass. solid white head retention. Stayed through the beer. Smell of citrus and peach. very bright visually and through the nose. Taste the front and it is very tart peach, not too much. Back end smooths out a bit and refreshes the tongue. Sparkling feel in your mouth, almost champagne all around. A nice refreshing ale in with limited session qualities, besides abv."
"Drinkability - this is very good ale, but it is not really a sessionable beer, owing to its tartness. It is something that would be excellent to enjoy with food, but not as a session beer."
"Dogfish Head needs to rethink this one, as it has totally missed the mark."
"D - Very drinkable, the flavors are very light all around; but this beer still has a lot of depth. It reminds me of a lambic light: the sourness is there, but not too sour, the fruit is apparent but not too fruity. I will have many more of these this summer."
"Pours a hazey banana skin and straw mixed with gold. Good, egg white head that slow recedes to a nice think film. Decent bubbling mixed in with the yeast. Very ripe fruit and yeast aroma. Wouldn't think this was a wheat beer from the aroma. The peach aroma is very faint and mixed in with very tart and ripe granny smith apples. The taste is a tart yeasty, ripened fruit melange. Was hoping for a more pronounced peach flavor. That was pretty subdued. It was more like a very ripe peach pulled off the tree too early. This beer was not as refreshing as expected. But still ok to have right after a hrad day at work. But I will not buy another 4-pack of this beer."
"D- Ouch, what a chore. I am sorry, I tried to have an open mind, but again, this is just not doing it for me. I usually dig a DFH beer, but I guess I can't like everything. I am glad I only have a single of this."
"D - Truly a great summer session beer. These are flying out of my fridge."
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability: For starters this is the driest beer I've ever drank...really compliments the flavors-acidic and tart/sour-found in this brew. Pretty light on the palate with light carbonation. This is a very crisp brew. This beer could quite easily be a session beer, however that is if you can handle the tartness. As I get farther along with this brew the more used to the style I am becoming, I could see myself drinking a few of these in a row, however I have a feeling it would be a bad idea to drink too many of these. This brew has turned me onto the style and I think I'll keep an eye out for more of this style."
"The beer pours a hazy pale gold color with a thick frothy white head that quickly fades to lacing. The aroma is decent. It has a grainy pale and wheat malt scent along with a mildly tart yeast aroma. There is only a hint of the peaches. The taste is good. It has a light and refreshing pale and wheat malt flavor that is crisp and tart with a slight peach feel. It goes down easy and finishes dry and sour. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a low bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a good drinking beer. I'm so glad they didn't make this 11+ %abv or whatever. It's nice to have a session beer with some style."
"Overall, not what I was expecting. The peach definately takes a backseat, and adds to the sourness. Something different, but kind of bland."
"The beer poured a very pale, hazy gold color with a solid 1 inch head that receded quickly. The aroma was musty and yeasty with a slight hint of peach and sweet malts. Taste was sour up front and had a bit of peach flavor to go with it and the beer finished with a light malty sweet flavor. Mouthfeel was quite light on the palate. The high level of mouth puckering tartness hurt the drinkability for me. Maybe they could've added some more peach to it? The only other time I've had this style was on a trip to Bavaria a few years ago where they had Berliner Kindl on tap and it was flavored with rasberry syrup. I remember it being very tasty with a good balance between the tartness and sweetness. Either way, you've got to give DFH credit for brewing a style that many consider obscure."
"Had this in a bottle that I picked up at Capone's. I tried this side by side with the Harpoon Peche. The Harpoon is a much better product. The appearance was golden in color with a smell of sour hops. The taste was way too sour for this style in my opinion. The carbonation was flat and the mouthfeel was restricted to the sourness which overwhelmed the other tastes. I would not order another one of these."
"This is an easy drinker ( if you like tart / sour beers) which I do. Thanks to phnphilly for turning me on to this beer."
"D. I didn't care for this at first but I have started to dig it"
"Festina Peche pours a light, hazy, golden yellow with a thin, white head from a brown twelve ounce bottle. There is a peach flavor and definitely some wheat in the aroma. Peach is quite noticeable in the flavor, there is a sour component that is true to style and lends a nice touch to this beer. The body is very light and the carbonation is fairly heavy, also true to style, giving a champangne like effervesence. A nice, refreshing Dogfish take on the style."
"Overall, pretty decent beer. Would really do the job on a hot day. Allthough I don't think I liked it enough to pick it over others if I was at the store, especially when you consider price."
"This is a great beer from April to September, gotta get my hands on a few more bottles. My advice: Get This Beer!!"
"Served in a pint glass at the Old Toad, Rochester, NY. It comes out in a pint glass with a pale, cloudy, watered down wheat beer look. No head. The aroma is so faint you have to sniff really hard to get anything. Wheat, and an acidic hint. The flavor profile is extremely odd: Up front it tastes like cool, filtered water. Then at the very end there is a very tart burst of lemon zest/peach, then back to nothing. Very interesting, but I prefer a beer that isn't so delicate, faint, and fruity. Typical of the off-the-wall style of brewing that has made Dogfish Head so famous. Just not for me."

"Very drinkable, very enjoyable, perfect for the season. This will be a beer I buy up now and look forward too each summer. Well done."
"Nice light enjoyable summer brew."
"good drinkability, this one disappears from the glass pretty quickly."
"Quite easy to drink and it was quite nice after a two hour bike ride in a strong wind. Super drinkable and very much tame after some of the harsher Berliner Weiss beers that I have had. A natural summer beer."
"what can I say about this beer other than pucker up baby. pours hazy golden with no head and little carbonation. fresh citrus aroma pleasantly balances this brew. sour as they come, a true wild ale. not my favorite dogfish head but worth trying. be brave."
"Pours a cloudy light golden. Not much head,or lacing. Aroma is of sweet and sour fruit. Body is thin and carbionated. Taste reminds me of sweetarts. Remember those from your childhood? Good tasting,but a peach wine cooler is really all you have here."
"A hazy, milky orangish yellow. No head, very few bubbles. Nose is slightly peachy, some alcohol, mild bitter hops, and some barn scent. Taste is very unique; it's a nice combo of bitterness and sweet peaches, with a tangy hoppy backdrop. Very much like a Berliner Weiss with the syrup already added, yet different and fresh. Mouthfeel is pretty good, as is drinkability."
"Interesting, but not great. Drinkable, but one is enough for me."
"Fully prepared to not like this beer, because I have a general aversion to fruit beers, I thought this was a very good beer. Poured into a pint glass, it was a cloudy yellow color with a small head. It had a citrus aroma, more lemon than anything else. Very tart taste, still more lemon, but the peach also showed up. Very crisp and refreshing, a good summer beer."
"Feels fairly light in body in the mouth, and leaves you dry, clean, and crisp. Overall a very nice and welcome change from the typical summertime brews. I'll be picking up this instead the nextime I'm experiencing a heatwave."
"D- This is a bright tart crisp beer that is refreshing and a nice peach flavor in the background. I love this style and this is a really great summer beer."
"Quite refreshing, unique and easy to drink on this humid July evening. Not sure if I would drink more than a few of these in one sitting however."
"DFH does it again."
"Appears a hazy blonde color with a head consisting of a thin layer of tiny bubbles, little spotty lacing. Smells of lemons and some light peach tones. Taste is very tart, with a finish of lemons and peaches. Light in body with great carbonation dancing on the palate. Another unusual but great brew from Dogfish Head, perfect for summertime."
"I imagine this will be a love it or hate it beer. Being a fan of the Berliner Weisse style, the jaw-clenching tartness on the first sip is exactly what I'm looking for. Nice, biting lactic acidity that smooths out rather quickness with aromatic peach flavor wafting through. The peach is more of a complimentary flavor than a primary flavor in the beer, with less sweetness than you might expect. Refreshing."
"Overall: I figured there would be a lot of haters of this *fruit* beer, so I am pleased to see it's getting some decent reviews. I liked it quite a bit, it is a great summer session beer. A few refreshing, quality flavors, but not overly complex, relatively light in body. The peach juice used during brewing is well balanced with everything else and doesn't taste like generic concentrate. I am glad to see an off centered company take on this style and do a good job of it."
"Mouthfeel is thin, somewhat watery. Overall a refreshing beer I may grow to like."
"Nice, light mouthfeel. Very active carbonation. Refreshing brew for a warm summer's day. On-tap is superior to the bottles, imo. But I do enjoy the bottles, also. My wife loves this beer. She has drank more of it than I ever will. Another hit from DFH."
"Overall: This was a tasty beer, a light summer drinker for a hot day. I don't know if I could drink more than one or two in one sitting, as it was very sour/tart beer."
"Update (7/21): I had this on tap at Deep Ellum in Allston last night. On tap it came through even better than in the bottle. The tartness and sour were more bold than in the bottle, which made for an even more enjoyable drinking experience. I highly recommend this on tap, more so than in the bottle."
"Cheers!"
"Dogfish Head Festina Pêche pours a hazy straw gold with a small but lingering head. Aroma is semi-sweet peaches as well as an opposing dry light maltiness, almost grainy. Flavor starts off with a nice peachy taste that goes from almost sweet to very tart in the after taste. Although the peach flavor makes the beer seem sweet, the tartness really comes through, its almost sour. Very refreshing and perfect for a hot summer day, although I can't see this one cutting it year round."
"Not the best offering from Dogfish--it's worth a drive-by, but I wouldn't buy a four-pack of it."
"On tap at Moan and Dove in Mass., the no.1 rated bar in the country. Light and cloudy. Peach and wheat flavour. Bit of head and lace. Straight up peach flavour, above average carbonation. A bit fruit soda taste, medium or lighter mouthfeel. Drying but satisfying. Sessionable ABV appreciated"
"Overall: Props to DFH for taking the less beaten path to make something truly enjoyable and i generally hate wheat beers. Although not very ""peachy"" if you like sour candy or flavors you will love this."
"DFH does it again..."
"12 ounce bottle, with a bottled on date of 6/1/2007. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours a cloudy straw gold color with a half inch white head. It smells like wheat, tart apples and a bit of peach. The taste is very tart, I can taste apples, citrus (lemon), and some wheat and peach. Taste is stronger than it smells, and the peach isn't as strong as I thought it would be. Mouthfeel/body is light, with some zippy carbonation. Drinkability is good, it's crisp, dry and definitely sessionable. It's a nice change of pace beer, and great for summer. Hopefully DFH will make this a regular offering, I would buy this again for sure."
"Over all this is a really great summer beer. Far too many of the summer beers are boring and almost all the same. This is a great change of pace and at least in my opinion and better one."
"What a difficult style to find but so worth it when you can. Leave it to Sam to add peach as the fourth Berliner Weisse flavor after raspberry, lemon and woodruff."
"After finishing the first, I had to have another. Perfect for the summer heat. Definitely gets points for creativity..."
"This one pours a cloudy light yellow color with a medium head that falls quickly and leaves a little lacing on the glass. The aroma is very interesting and light. Smells like fresh peaches with a very small hint of sourness behind it - very soft and pleasant aroma. The flavor is much the same. Just a hint of sourness on the finish that doesn't linger long. The peach flavor is very soft and smooth, but definately there. The body is light and the drinkability is good. The sourness seems to increase as the beer warms, but never becomes too strong."
"An interesting one from DFH. Quite the thirst quencher on a hot day. Nice to see a larger American brewer taking a stab at this almost dead style. I personally would like to taste it unblended, without the peach. Well worth trying for anyone out there that is interested in the sour side of beers. Perhaps a nice introduction to lambics and Oud beers."
"This beer looks a lot like lemonade. There is a thick head and a ton of carbonation. The smell is lemongrass and orange. The peach is in there but subdued. The taste is sour and citrusy. The mouthfeel is smooth and the sourness lingers. I could drink this beer again. Another strange release from DFH."
"Exuberantly bubbled, with missiles of fine-beaded carbonation, it has all the properties of a thirst destroyer."
"D: This absolutely destroyed my palate. The sourness of the peach just absolutely made detecting other more subtle flavors difficult throughout the rest of the night. But it was fairly refreshing for a summer night."
"Bravo to DFH for producing a style that is severly under-represented. This beer (and style) really show that you can achieve a lot of flavor and complexity at a rather low gravity. I seldom buy more than a six pack of any particular seasonal, and I am already on my 3rd 4-pack of this stuff. I just can't get enough, and unfortunately there just aren't many other commercial options in this style."
"Light-bodied with moderate carbonation. Finishes with some lingering sweetness. Very refreshing."
"Pours a hazy golden straw color with a nice one finger fluffy white head that quickly dies down to a thin lacing. Stickiness is ok at first but pretty weak towards the end. Smell is a sugary apricot/peach with a crisp lemongrass blended in. Taste, wow, very tart and sour on the tongue at first...almost like a lemon or orange sour patch kid. Very different, not much alcohol taste at all which is just about the only good thing the taste has going. A nice pale malt in the aftertaste takes a while to surface, but it is enjoyable. Mouthfeel is very light bodied with a whole buncha carbonation. Drinkability lacks a bit just because of how tart it is, but it picks its self up with the lack of alcohol on the nose and tongue. Give it a try, but I wouldn't go out of your way to get one."
"Don't drink and review."
"Fortunately it tastes better than it smells. Although the taste isn't conventional at all. Tart citrus, sour peaches, and a bitter lemonade quality make this one of the odder beers I've had. The mouthfeel is extremely thin and fizzy, giving it more of a soft drink quality, but it didn't detract from the beer's uniqeness."
"12oz bottle from Florian's. Light yellow body, a tad hazy due to the little bit of yeast I accidentally got in it, and a half inch of off-white head. Smells like peach juice and very little else. It smells good, but rather one-dimensional. Tastes like peach initially, with kind of a sourness toward the finish that is reminiscent of apple or lemon. Light in body, and extremely drinkable. Wow, this is a good beer."
"Like most Americans I have never had this style before. Very tart. Definitely shows it's wheat beer heritage but I prefer Hefeweizen over this anytime. Thanks to DFH for letting me taste this without a trip to Germany but this is not one of my favorites. Nice to try once but probably won't buy it again."
"Best by 5/31/07. Pours a hazy golden yellow, fizzy white head that vanishes quickly, Nose is subdued tart fruit, peach definitely evident, slight grainy smell as well. Taste is very sour peach, mouth puckering. After a few sips, tartness becomes more manageable, and it becomes very nice tasting, with a nice peach flavor over a smooth wheat malt, finishing tart but refreshing. Definitely better tasting than I was expecting. Don't know how this stacks up to the real thing, but this is a different yet good summer beer."
"I can't imagine a food that would compliment this beer. It would wipe out any flavors food might have with it's bitterness."
"Sweet peach flavors are quickly brought down by a succulent bitter finish that is almost sour. As the style should be this isn't overly complex. However the wheat component is very staballizing. Seems like it could be slightly more carbonated. Mouth is puckering to a degree and leaves you craving your next sip. After finishing this this beer gets really acrid. Flavors of a vitamin C pill leaves a chalky unwelcome grit on the tongue."
"Light body, not a whole lot of carbonation. Very refreshing, good summer beer. Worth trying."
"Smells of tinned peaches, wheat, and grassy hops. Interesting. I loved the taste -- probably my favorite American fruit beer (though I know that's not the technical style) -- sour peach, a little honey, and crisp as can be. Mmm mmm. Haven't tried it out of the bottle yet, so I don't know how it stacks up, but that gallon disappeared with ease. The perfect summer brew, in my opinion. Thank you, DFH!"
"Poured into a pint glass, pours a yellow pale yellow with a bit of head that does not stay around long, little bubbles of carbonation fill the drink. Smell is of fresh citrus with notes of honey and malt. Taste is very bitter and sour, but not sour where it does not go down pretty smooth, has a very tarty taste as well, this beer is very unsual and one that goes down pretty nicely, overall I actually enjoyed this different tasting beverage and would have it again and again."
"dogfish head... love them or hate them. i'm a big fan. not for the unadventurous. pours a hazy, fizzy, yellow/straw with a super fizzy white head that goes away quickly. smells of yeast, some spice and a dry, tart peach. tastes very sour and tart. somewhere between a bubbly wine like beverage and a nice summer beer. makes me pucker and goes down very champagne like. great fun and easy drink. it's hard to believe this is a beer, but is a nice change of pace. i won't session this one, but it was cool to explore the lighter side of things. btw - chicks dig this one."
"Poured from a 12oz. bottle into my shaker ""pint"" glass. Appears a very cloudy light yellow color with about a finger of white foam that quickly fades leaving no noticeable lace. Smells of bready grains, lemon and peach. Taste is of sour peaches and maybe a touch of yeast and malt. A notch below medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Very crisp, dry and refreshing. Not a bad effort, but I prefer 1809. Worth a try as a good quencher in the warm weather."
"I can understand that some beer drinkers are not going to like this beer. The Berliner Weisse style is not one that would appeal to the masses. And that's too bad, because it's an excellent summer beer. But the tartness is an acquired taste for sure. Not unlike that of a Flemish sour red, like Rodenbach. It takes some getting used to. But if you're into tart beers, or you're just ready to try something different, definitely give the Festina Peche a go. Kudos to the folks at DFH for trying, and succeeding, at this under-appreciated style of beer."
"I'll pass in the future."
"Pours a very very light yellow not far from transparent a thin fizzy quick to fade white head atop,hmm odd aromas overripe stone fruit, lactic sourness and mineral.That Berliner weiss character shows thru in a genuine tartness that lingers with a hint of grass the peach flavors are slightly subdued but came on more as I drank more and made it pretty appetizing.Leave it to DFH to come up with new and creative ideas in beer this is a summer quaffer no doubt."
"12oz brown bottle with a bottled on date of 5/31/07. Pours a slightly hazy pale gold with a 2 finger head, OK longevity and decent lace. Definate yeast aromas mixed with some citrus and honey but I do not detect any peach aromas. A light wiess flavor, spritzy with a peach aftertaste. Big malt flavors though - for a weiss that is. A definate summertime beer. Quality made, but nothing special."
"12 ouncer with ""bottled on 5/31/07"" etched onto the neck. Pours very light yellowy amber, cloudy with a loose buble white head, that stay around for a short while. Minor lacing, upon a gentle swirl. Nose is brightly of fresh tropical fruits and cool mint. Sourness is a notch below ""extreme"" but it leaves no room for argument, that this is a quite sour creation, and no doubt will not be for everybody. Finishes a bit chalky, leaving a long sour legacy behind. Tasty and adventuresome creation from DFH."
"drinkability: Easily drinkable, but probably not worth the price tag...for me at least."
"Very light,acidy mouthfeel. Not a filling beer,water-like a bit like drinking lemmon juice can't get past the sourness to have any amount of drinkability. Don't belive i've had this style before almost a love or hate style. I'm still deciding. Worth a try if you want something different."
"Overall, a good thirst quencher, but not something I would want on a regular basis."
" Overall this was a wine cooler to me. Way too light and just not enough character. Had a great feel, and the low ABV makes it a nice very hot summer days treat, in fact my wife would probably love this and will have to give her a taste next time I see one, but for the price, if I wanted a wine cooler I would go for a wine cooler. I will stick to DFH's bigger and in my opinion better offerings. Speaking of which, got a red and white due up next."
"Poured a light wheaty amber. Smelled rubbery for some strange reason. The taste was of malt liquour--sort of like peach Smirnoff. It didn't feel or taste good at all. I took a four pack to a BBQ, dumped the one I tried and left 3 for the hostess on the off chance she likes strange, slightly fruity malt liquour."
"I wasn't sure if I was going to like this one and, while I didn't love it, it was certainly enjoyable and much more appealing than expected. This is a nice, different take on a summer thirst quencher, and it does the job nicely overall."
"Pours a very pale, somewhat cloudy color. Aroma is strong with hints of peach and malt. Very fruity. The taste is smooth and flavorful, not too overpowering with a strong peach essence. As a result, this beer is very drinkable. It's also quite sessionable. I like it."
"Beer...good."
"Edit: This has really grown on me, so I'm raising the numbers a little. Give this one a real chance, this is the stuff of a great summer seasonal."
"Extremely drinkable: refreshing; light, if slightly sticky moutfeel, low abv."
"UPDATE: The more I drink this stuff the more I like it. Off to the beer store yet again for another 4 pack."
"Recommended"
"An enjoyable, drinkable beer whose tart twist stands out of the crowd. The peaches are thankfully subdued and blend in well with the esters of the beer. A little expensive, but I would not mind having it again. It could just use a little more life to it (is this bottle-conditioned?) and a slightly less spritzy mouthfeel."
"An unusual style, but enjoyable. Can't say I could session these, but this would make a nice beer to search out & enjoy while available, especially if you like sour/tart. Peach fans might be disappointed, but they also may really enjoy it...its certainly no peach bomb. This would make for an interesting side for a fruit & soft cheese plate. I'd certainly drink it again, and would recommend it."
"This poured a slightly hazy/cloudy golden-straw color. Had a subtle sour smell to it at first and then opened up to the peach aromas. Good carbonation on it gave it a great mouth feel. The sourness really overpowered the peach flavor in this beer for me. You could taste some peach but again, it was very subtle. I think this is a great summer beer. The sourness was not over the top like a La Folie, but it was still prominent."
"Finishes just a slightly bit sticky which detracts from its near perfect drinkability. A summer sipping wonder without question."
"D - Good Really hit the spot on a hot Sunday afternoon. I might have agian. The flavor and so forth isn't great, but it is pleasant. A tad reminiscent of lemonade."
"An interesting and tasty beer. Paired nicely with a couple pieces of Havarti cheese."
"I received an instant bite when I took my first sip and it reminded me even more of champagne, being very tang and tart. After taste as well as the rest of the glass was much smoother. I'd say overall a descent fruit beer. But nothing that would keep me coming back."
"Extremely drinkable. One of the best fruit additions to a beer I've ever tasted. I really liked that the peach was tart and not sweet. I found it easy to see myself drinking a few of these on a summers day."
"Drinkability - Initially I thought I couldn't drink much of this but by the time I finished the beer I was ready for another one."
"It's wonderfully tart, then settles into a smooth, sweeter taste as you continue to drink it -- very refreshing indeed. It's the opposite of chewy -- ideal for a hot summer day. I am not a fan of peaches, but this won me over with a perfect balance of up-front tartness and secondary sweetness without ever seeming syrupy or too sweet."
"A refreshing beer that needs a little bit of work done. I don't know alot about the style but I was expecting something a little more German like. Something I might pick up later but don't count on it."
"Because this was my first time sampling a Berliner Weissbier, I must admit that I am not accustomed to the style. However, if this beer is in any way indicative of other beers in this category, I find find few redeeming qualities with them."
"D- This is a very drinkable summer beer. Great brew from DFH. I was excited to get to try a Berliner. I would not hesitate to have this again."
"Drinkability: The clean finish is nice. I'm sure the tartness will turn off some, but I like it!"
"A broad interpretation of the style - well, what do you expect from DFH. I do have to say, though, that they put a nice twist on the style. A nice summer brew. Wish it came in six-packs for the same price!"
"Overall: A real pleasant surprise. I wouldn't have minded having an entire case of this despite my initial reservations... This would be a great beer for a summer barbecue of mixed real beer drinkers, cheap beer drinkers and the wine cooler crowd."
"D: The tart flavor makes this beer almost too drinkable. One sip and I reflexively reach for another. A great creation from the twisted minds at DFH."
"I sampled this at the Grey Lodge the other night for their DFH tasting and picked up a few bottles the next day. The beer poured a very cloudy golden color into my DFH pint glass with a medium thickness, fluffy white head that runs away quickly. The aroma has alot going on. There a very present peach aroma running around and it is also a bit creamy. The taste is more of the same and oh so good. You first get a nice tart sensation in the mouth that is rounded out by a fresh peach taste and balanced out with an almost creamy texture. Probably due to the lactic fermentation this gets. This is a really good representation of the Berliner style. You get the tartness that is a trademark of the style but the peach flavor is really enjoyable and with a low ABV of 4.5%, this is going to be on my summer beer rotation at home for some while."
"At the brewpub I noticed that Festina Peche was not the Festina Lente yeah I know...anyway I asked Wes the bartender for a half pint on this one just b/c of the tart character and my eagerness to start drinking one of the 90 minutes through the Randall. Appearance a clouded apricot light golden tone with a large fizzy whtie head leaves behind thin lacing after dwindling away. Aromatics contain that great tart lactic character trademark of the Berliner Weissbier of Germany but in this case also an evident nose of Peaches with a light herbal quality detected as well. Flavors definitely pucker the lips a great eye opening tartness dives into my senses leaving behind a clean dryness after the rush lets up fruity peach notes are not syrupy or cloying very well blended into the design of this beer I'm guessing with Dogfish real peaches here great and refreshing with tartness and funky citrus wheat mix as well. Mouthfeel is light and spritzy carbonation really tickles the throat with the fine bubbled flow as stated the finish is definitely dry once the tart lactic character fades very nice stuff. Drinkablity quite refreshing and interesting but I preferred the half pint although I would not have had any problmes definitely the drinkable type of funky tart beers not that ones that start to turn the stomach acidic a true session beer."
"D- I had this beer thinking that I had grabbed lightning in a bottle by have it at the pub, but I think this going to be a regular beer for DFH now. If you are not crazy about fruit beers, try this one; it changed my view on them."
"Edit 3/10-just read on the email letter from the brewery that this will be released this spring. So much for a 1 off-sorry."
"Note their sign called this a: Neo Berliner Weisse style beer."
