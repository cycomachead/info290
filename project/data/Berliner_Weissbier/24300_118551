What was aroused was the lees and the yeast. I got a finger-and-a-half of foamy, bone-white head out of my inverted Glug and it evinced decent retention before falling to wisps, leaving nice lacing in its wake. Nose was earthy, very evocative of my neighbor's garden just before she begins planting seeds. Color was a hazy-cloudy Yellow-Gold (SRM = 4 -5). The lack of clarity meant that The Golden Trio (tm) of Midas, Croesus and Mammon were disinterested. More for me! Mouthfeel was thin-to-medium. Whoa! Did somebody substitute lemon juice for my beer?!? Holy f**kin' tart, Batman! Shazam!  I CAN't unpucker my lips and I am supposed to play the trumpet tonight! My duck face is not of my own free will.

This beer has nice drinkability, it's smooth, a little refreshing, a little acidic, a little crisp, not filling and the taste did a nice job at holding my attention, but I think the acidity would prevent me from drinking more than one.  What I like the most about this beer was that it was just a nice true example of the style.  What I liked the least about this beer was the appearance, I wish the head and lacing were better.  I would buy this beer again and I would recommend it to anyone who likes sour beer and especially if you like the style.  All in all i was happy with this beer, it just what I was in the mood for and i think it's nice that more breweries are making this style.  This is one of the better Evil Twin beers i've had and I think it's above average for the style.  Good job guys this is a tasty and refreshing beer, keep up the hard work.","StoutHunter","Mar 12, 2015"

3.82,-2.6,3,3.5,4,4,4,"12 ounce can into tulip glass, canned on 7/17/2014. Pours hazy golden straw color with a 1 finger fairly dense white head with poor retention, that reduces to nothing very quickly. No lacing on the glass, and a light amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of tart lemon, green apple, pear, white grape, hay, straw, grass, white vinegar, wheat, bread, musty funk, and yeast earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance and complexity of fruity/funky/lactic yeast and pale malt notes; with solid strength. Taste of tart lemon, green apple, pear, white grape, hay, straw, grass, white vinegar, wheat, bread, musty funk, and yeast earthiness. Fair amount of fruity/acidic tartness on the finish; with lingering notes of tart lemon, green apple, pear, white grape, hay, straw, grass, white vinegar, wheat, bread, musty funk, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a short bit. Very nice complexity and robustness of fruity/funky/lactic yeast and pale malt flavors; with a great malt/tartness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and light-medium bodied; with a very smooth, crisp, and fairly acidic mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with zero warming present after the finish as expected of 4%. Overall this is a very nice Berliner weisse style. All around good robustness and complexity of fruity/funky/lactic yeast and pale malt flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Oct 13, 2014"

3.85,-1.8,3.25,3.75,4,4,3.75,"Overall, this is your typical Berliner Weissbier.  It actually is nice because it sheds things down to the bare bones.  There is no gimmick, and there is no hook.  The beer presents itself solely, offering a serious take on a rare style.  Despite the grapey, fruity, and tart suggestions from the nose, you get hit with that bright, bittering pucker in the flavoring that you might not be expecting.  This acts to both surprise and cleanse the palate, making way for this beer, and nothing but this beer.  Nomader Weisse supports a pleasant philosophy; one of sharpness, cleanliness, and relaxation.  This is a philosophy that is easy to get behind, and you can, hopefully, truly see where they’re coming from once you sample this beverage.  They hit the style well, and make the decision to revisit this beer an easy one.","TheBrewo","Sep 26, 2014"

Light bodied with moderate carbonation despite the lackluster head. A good lemony Berliner weissbier that left me wishing for a bit more wheat character. Refreshing and moderate tart. Not my style, but a pleasant, refreshing summer beer.","LiquidAmber","Aug 15, 2014"

The palate doesn't differ a lot from the aroma - moderate lacto, some spiciness, some bicycle tire. It's hard to get past that note of rubber.
