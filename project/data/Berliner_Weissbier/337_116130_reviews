"Pours a pale hazy gold with a white head.  Smells like green apples, lemon zest, and hay.  Taste is funky and tart.  Mouthfeel is dry and refreshing, fairly crisp, although slightly undercardbed for the style."

"Overall: A great quencher for hot Houston summers. Very glad to find more breweries moving towards lower alcohol with full flavors."

"O. This beer is very refreshing and I crushed the 22oz before realizing it. Wish this had more carbonation but that is a minor gripe"

"Slightly cloudy straw colored pour with a small white head. Aroma is light yeast and lemon. Initial taste has a really nice sour edge with a bit of lemon. Very light bodied with a bit of grain coming out towards the end. Finishes crisp and sour to the point of almost being more of a sour."

"Nice stab at the style, I enjoyed it!"

"There was only one of these in the fridge at the local grocery store and the label was partly ripped off, so I kinda bought it blind. But St Arnold always does a good job and I'm certainly not disappointed, even tho that first blast of sour was a bit of a shock! Good job again tho, St Arnold."

"a cool little berliner right here, very delicate, lightly flavored, and one of the more enjoyable saint arnold beers ive had recently. its real pale in color, white laced straw color, some yeasty haze, and a nose of light lemon lacto and plain wheat malt. rather simple, but thats what i want in hot weather, something to just open up and drink, and this is certainly one of those. i wish it hard a little more sourness to it, more acidity and tartness, especially to tidy up the finish and add that refreshment factor, but the body is super minimal and the carbonation is there, so it still drinks real easy, but its not quite as quenching as others. quick finish with a lemon taste to it, like a wedge in a wheat beer, the lacto character isnt very developed. a more approachable berliner than many, good for those who are unsure if they like these sorts of beers. i have no idea what a bottle costs, because this was shared with me, but if it was 5 or 6 bucks a bottle, it would be in my fridge all summer long. any more than that, and you have better options out there."
"Pours yellow/golden colored. Thick head that quickly dissipates with little to no lacing. Seems highly carbonated. Sour fruity aroma with funky smell on the end. Crisp fruity taste. Highly carbonated. Strong funky taste on the end. This is my first experience with this type of beer. It is very light and refreshing. I am impressed so far."

"I poured this into a standard pint glass. It's a crystal-clear pale gold color, with a slight head. The nose is a grainy malt, slightly sweet. Flavor does offer appropriate lactic sourness, but not much else. It's all grainy sourness, and not very interesting."

"Solid beer but I don't know if I will revisit it much."
"Overall: A solid offering from Saint Arnold, and I'm glad we have a cheap, locally available berliner. This could probably benefit from some fruit syrup though."
""
""
"Modest tartness leads into a grainy, almost lager-feeling middle and is followed by a cruising sour finish. Its light mouthfeel helps accentuate the mild sourness from the lacto. Its not going to blow away anyone looking for a sour fix, but it is pretty true to the style and is very refreshing. I could take down a bottle of this with much rapidity. Im glad Saint Arnold made this and look forward to crushing more of these over the summer."

"Pours out a slightly hazed golden straw color with a solid head. Smells tart, lactic, and grainy. Taste is dry, tart, refreshing, lightly grainy, crackery. Taste is lightly sweet upfront, but overall perfectly balanced with tartness and dryness. Cracker-like cereal. Bright wheat. Clean yeast. Seriously, the cleanest beer that St. Arnold could ever hope to produce. Mouthfeel has a surprising weight of body, considering the 3.7%. I'mimpressed. This is not the best Berliner weisse, but certainly my favorite St. Arnold beer (I'm usually not a fan of theirs). I want to drink this all the damned time. I'd be curious to have this ""mit schuss."""

"O: a great shot at an excellent beer style, although the recipe could do with some tweaking here and there, it still makes for a great sessionable wheat beer and probably even better for a year round offering."
""
"Overall: Can't believe I'll be able to have this year-round. This will probably be in my fridge this summer as much as H&G Zoe, which says a lot. Great beer St. Arnold!"

"Overall: This is my first Berliner Weisse, so I have nothing to compare it against, however judging from how much I liked this beer, I plan to seek out this style specifically. I really, really dig this beer."

"It's nice to finally have really available Berliner in Houston, even if I was limited to only two bottles at a certain store in downtown."
""
""
"First impressions are indeed good. If available I will always be grabbing a ton of bottles. This will be perfect for the summer, but also enough character that I can enjoy anytime. If all you want is a sourness and acidity to dominate this is not for you. Otherwise, grab this by the case."
