Seriously, the cleanest beer that St. Arnold could ever hope to produce. Mouthfeel has a surprising weight of body, considering the 3.7%. I'mimpressed. This is not the best Berliner weisse, but certainly my favorite St. Arnold beer (I'm usually not a fan of theirs). I want to drink this all the damned time.

This will be perfect for the summer, but also enough character that I can enjoy anytime. If all you want is a sourness and acidity to dominate this is not for you. Otherwise, grab this by the case.","champ103","Beers"
