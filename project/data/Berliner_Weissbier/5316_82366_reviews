"Scored a six pack of bombers from a friend that aged them for 2+ years (drink by date of 9/12) because he didn't like them but didn't want to throw them away...needless to say, this beer has aged very well!!!"

"Poured from 650 ml bomber into a Liefmans Goudenband glass (my preferred all purpose beer tasting glass)."
"O: This bottle is over a year old, but I've heard of Berliners lasting up to a couple of years. At least the ones that actually use Brett. This did not hold up, but even still I doubt it was very good in the first place. Not tart enough and seriously lacking substance all around."

"Atmosphere is okay. No real head or lacing. Nose is light tropical fruit and bread. Yeasty, with a little tart and sweet fruit. Overall, this is an okay quaff."
""
"Mouthfeel is light and crisp. I like this beer. I see why it might be a summer style. I find it refreshing and good."
""
"Where to start? The malt seems a little too biscuity and not crisp enough, and the beer flavors in the background are quite watery. Not nearly sour enough either, just a light lemon squeeze is all I am getting. Its more like an unsweetened radler and less like a berliner. I'll easily finish my bomber, but even at the modest price of $5, I wont be going back for more. A shame too, because I would loooove to have an affordable , decently sour berliner available here."

"Fruity smell, fizzy, tart finish, pretty crisp for sure. Not sure what occasion this seasonal Beer is for. A wedding? New Years? I am sure this one has a cult following but I am far away for sure. Think Champagne gone bad or some incomplete cider. I would pour it for friends just for fun to see their reaction."

"Tart and slightly woody. Plenty of suds as you sip. Quite drinkable, but not much complexity. I have to admit that it does seem to suggest adding something fruity and flavorful, or maybe mix it 50/50 with a Saison that needs some spritz, or a Hefeweizen that's on the sweet side. From the 22 oz bottle bought at Bottleworks in San Diego."
""
""
"And, typical of the style, it's not all that good a beer to drink straight. It's not sour enough to be interesting, and doesn't offer much else. Would like to try this with woodruff syrup, though."
"Sourcing: Purchased at HEB in Texas for $4.19 plus tax for a twenty-two ounce bottle."
"Amazing price point for a bomber and comes through with some nice character."

"A pretty good go at the style, fun to drink though I wish it popped a bit more on the palate ... crispness and tartness. All in all a decent example of the style."
"O: I don't mind fluffing this beer, I really enjoy it as a session able sour drinker. The thing that makes it really outstanding is the price. 5 bucks a bottle for a 22oz sour that is well made and refreshing and sessionable. Gets my vote, one of my favorite Full Sails."

"Pouring a hazy, murky orange with a thin, white head that falls off to a ring leaving little lacing, this looks like any other BW. The nose is EXTREMELY grainy and wheaty, smelling almost wholly of wheat with a hint of sulfur and some grape notes. The palate opens moderately tart with a yogurty, lactic tartness, with plenty of wheat and grain husk. Extremely disjointed and utterly lacking in structure, this is a very poor example of the style. A touch of sulfur is present. Light in body and crisply carbonated this beer has a drying, yogurty lactic finish. Meh"
""
""
"This ale has a nice crystal clear body with medium carbonation and a thick white head that quickly thins into a layer of bubbles surrounded by some thick lacing. The aroma is filled with malts and grass tones with a nice touch of citrus fruits. It does smell light and refreshing. It’s light bodied and refreshing and very sour and that’s about all I get, maybe some granny smith apples and very, very mild wheat. It does go down well and is pretty refreshing."

"overall not the best berliner weiss, but serviceable. wouldnt buy another."
""
"This is a medium to lighter bodied brew with a modest amount of carbonation. It is surprisingly malty and lacking in tartness for the style. There is no alcohol inclusion which is fitting but just not enough positive things to say about this. This was quite a let down and had some things both going on and missing about it to make it not worth seeking out. I am glad I got a chance to try this but I would not drink it again...and it pains me to say that. The price point is nice on this bottle, it just isnt fitting for thr style."

"Pours a clear gold with a foamy beige head that settles to sparse wisps of film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace slowly drip into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is of malt, wheat, and grain aromas. Taste is much the same with wheat and sour lemon-like flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of acidity on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer but the smell is lacking any indication of sourness and what sourness is coming across in the flavor is fairly subdued."

"D - like any good berliner weisse, this is a drinkable beer that one doesn't think before reaching for another sip - it's reflexively drinkable, though I would be more interested in a beer that was less objectionable: more tart and perhaps more funky with a little brett character, yet this is a berliner weisse for the masses and one can't fault a beer with that label"

"Sample I got fizzed like the dickens, but not for too long once I got some into a mug. Aroma has a strong fruity, yeasty overtone with a tart apple note and a woody hint of hops. It pours a slightly hazy solar yellow with a thick, if not too persistent, fluffy white head. Flavor is quite tart, mainly fruity with a hint of malt - drinks more like a cider than a beer, still crisp and refreshing. Texture has average body and fizz. OK, not Full Sail’s best, but a decent effort."

"D/O: Easy to drink, this beer tastes like a slightly malty soft drink rather than a real sour ale. It is saved by its smell, which seems respectable from top to bottom."
"Appearance is golden light supporting a thin crisp head that dissipates quickly leaving no lace. Smell is light on the nose with malt, wheat and lemon citrus. Taste has the malt, wheat and a sour lemon that chases to the end. Mouthfeel is light with good carbonation. certainly wakes the mouth up with that punch of tart."
""
"Pours a nice clean/clear golden light yellow color, nice carbonation, with a nice one-finger foamy white head, not much sticky lacing left behind at all. The nose is mostly malty, slight hop note, citrusy. The taste is pretty tart, malty, with a slight hoppiness. Medium body. Overall, considering it is over 2 months old (Thanks Fucking SLS) I believe it is not fair to really judge this one, but I would not buy it again, and I have to get in the fucking business to start checking out fuckn' labels in the State Liquor Stores, their such FUCKING ASSHOLES!"

"Perhaps this is a true connoisseur's beer. I won't know till later. ;)"
""
"Overall, not a great weissbier, just okay."
""
"Overall: this beer has some flaws, but it has a good tartness and a decent feel."
"Overall, it's an OK berliner weisse - a little on the sweet side."
""
""
"O/D-Couldn't pass up on a cheap Berliner. Full Sail did a great job on this unique style. At under $5 a bomber, this was a decent deal too. I thought this was pretty awesome. Underrated."
""
""
"O - a refreshing summer beer. I could drink this all day long."
""
""
""
"A decent beer, but very one dimensional overall, a bit disappointing."
""
"O- Great blend of fruit flavors in this beer with a really nice tartness. This would be a great introductory sour beer. The body of this beer is super light, great on a really hot day, but on any other day the body could be underwhelming."
"22 oz bottle from ""Lifesource"" Salem. $4.79. Clear golden brew with a weird yet nice sort of peach color tinge to it ( might be my eyes), large thick,frothy white head. Yeasty aromas.. mainly dough slight barnyard and malts...mostly bread-like. Taste is slightly acetic/tart....then fades off with some bready malt in the back..aftertaste is rice vinegar. Mouthfeel is OK its highly drinkable when its hot and muggy like right now. I wonder if this would go good with some cordial/syrups? As it is its acceptable"
""
""
"O - This is a refreshing and tasty Berliner Weiss. I really enjoyed this brew."
""
""
"Sour slightly in the flavor. Lemon, peach, apricot, and other summer fruits. It's crisp, refreshing, a great lawnmower beer. Lots of carbonation dances and clears the palate and finishes very dry. Overall it's not bad, but it's not blowing up my skirt."
""
"Overall: I found it to be both pleasant and quite refreshing, which was what I was looking for in this beer."
"I can't positively say how close this is to the Berliner Kindl that I used to drink back in the mid-80s when living in Berlin, but it's seems like a faithful stab at the style to the best of my recollection. Perhaps about more sour than the Kindl, but definitely hitting the style description as listed in BA. A nice alternative to a traditional German hefeweizen."

"OK, this is a little too clean for a Berliner weiss, but it's a tasty summer beer nevertheless. The aroma is soft and bready with a toasted edge. Light caramel and more fresh-baked bread malts fill the flavor. There's a mild sour tang and it's pleasant enough, but this beer is too clean to be a true example of the style. Of course, you can just call it the American wheat version of a Berliner weiss and enjoy it for what it is."
""
"Decent overall, though I'm a firm believer that Berliners should be fruited. Funky Buddha has spoiled me."
"Drinkability is fine, it's a guzzler, very refreshing, just not one to instill much reflection."
""
"I really like this style, but this one didn't do it for me. Not bad, but not great. Taste is flat and empty compared to others I've had."
"Hazy weisse dark straw color as expected. Very quick head, but well carbonated. Hard to tell this is a Berliner by the aroma, very light tart note. Same with the flavor, very mild for a Berliner, it's hard to even describe it as sour or tart, maybe a bit tangy, but that's it. I did notice some unusual salty and sweet notes as it warmed up, which were interesting. Overall a drinkable beer but a disappointed Berliner for me."
"Pours a pale straw with good amount of white head and good retention. Sour nose with wheat malt and hint of apple. Taste follows with sourness and apple flavor, apple is less appealing than in the nose. Mouthfeel is light and smooth, sour is welcome on this hot summer night. Overall a good attempt at a Berliner Weiss."
"O- Something quite interesting. I would drink it on occasion, not a session beer or one i would seek out."
"- It's a solid beer for sure, and I like the tartness to it. It's not soured by any means, but contains that nice lemon-like zingy flare with a nice grainy wheat edge. Good representation of the style, though I would love to see it unfiltered and ready for a dash of syrup perhaps?"
"O: Flavors are pretty good, though light, making this very drinkable. I'm not getting any citrus. I easily went through the entire 22oz myself. Pairs well with food, too (Indian in my case)."

"22oz bottle $4.49. Bright yellow with a couple bubbles. Smell is a mix of cardboard and wheat. Flavor is the most subtle tarness, wheat, hint of lacto? Surely not. Extremely easy to drink but as far as the style this is disappointing overall. Oh well, at least it was cheap."
"Overall, I like this. It's not as good as other berliner weisses out there, but at least it's a good prologue to the Anchorage Galaxy White IPA I'm about to indulge in. This is quite sessionable, and it's the only Full Sail I find myself liking. Cheers!"
"The bartender confirmed that the beer has not sold well at beermongers and has not been a popular beer with his customers. I can see why. I've been a big fan of FS beers over the years, especially the brewmaster reserve series. This is easily the worst beer I can ever recall having from FS."
""
""
"O: The appearance of this beer is quite dark for the style when compared with other offerings. Doesn't really taste authentic to the style - a little too full bodied and malty. Enjoyable but not as light and refreshing as others in the style (and expectation). Easy to drink and definitely sessionable."
""
"O: I could easy drink this beer all day long. It is a nice sessionable beer for the summer months. This beer is quite refreshing but the lemony flavors almost make it seem like fruit syrup has already been added to the beer."
"Easy drinking, fairly refreshing. However, it's average for the style and rather boring."
""
""
"Super easy-to-drink offering that offers a simple flavor profile with a very refreshing, crisp mouthfeel. I could drink this all the time."

"Poured into a Seattle Beer Week pint glass. Pours a light orange straw amber. Minimal head, but a ring around the glass with slight slippery lacing. Aroma of biscuit malt, light citrus and a lactic hint. Flavor starts with tart lemony wheat and develops into a light biscuit malt, wheat and lemon. The tartness is dominant, and other flavors are subdued. Light bodied, but nice mouth feel with sharp active carbonation. A refreshing, understated weissbier with a balanced amount of lactic tartness."
""
"One finger white rapidly dissipating head over straw gold clear body, champagne like effervescence quickly leading to some clinging bubbles on side of glass, and a few small bubbles rising from bottom of etched glass. The lacto is fairly prevalent in the nose, wet hay and a bit of sourness. Taste is a bit more tart than sour though the finish will make you pucker up, lemony, clean light wheat, no hops to speak of. Mouthfeel well on the light side of medium, about right for style, decent effervescence. Could have used some more conditioning but at this price point certainly a good value. Worth a try."
"o - Overall a pretty nice berlinerweiss; cool to see them doing things like this. The nose is definitely a bit funky, while the taste has more sour citrus and lemon. Wheat is present throughout, and it is easy to drink. Would have it again."

"Cheers!"
"4/3.5/3/3.5/3.5"
"Pours a delicate light yellow with the slightest diaphanous overcast. Fleeting foam atypical of the style. Smells of wheat, co2, lemon must, hay and some hints of lactic acid. Light and crisp smelling. Lightly tart with a wheaty sweetness and finishing corn flavors. The tartness is upfront and surprisingly transient. The finish is longer than I had anticipated with grain and grass with a hint of dry tartness (like I just swallowed some plain yogurt). A little heavy for the style with moderate carb and a wet finish. Clocking in at 4%, this is on the low end for US Berliner's, but the high end for Berlin. I like this version, although I'm guessing it isn't natural lacto, nor is there any Brett, so the beer really does merit a ""best by"". Nonetheless, I'm not put out by the offering. Certainly worth the $5 I paid."
""
""
"O: Not the most complex Berliner in the world, but it is very much to style in ABV and taste. Plus at less than $4 a bomber, the price is right for those who want to get into this style, which for some reason is much more expensive than it should be."
