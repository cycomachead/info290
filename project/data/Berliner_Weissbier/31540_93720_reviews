"Verdict: A very nice Berliner Weissbier from de Garde, easy to see how it serves as a great base for all the fruited variants. On it's own though, it's refreshing and simple, very crushable, would make for a great summer stand by."

"Smells like canned corn and beets. Faded as it warmed. Not much carbonation and the flavor is mealy and much the same as the aroma. Meh. Pass."
""
"Starts lemon and other citrus flavors.  Little bit of citrus though.  Nice tartness.  However it is very light and watery."

"The body was light and crisp, with a finish drier than the Sahara desert. Drinkability was so excellent, I didn't even mind the usually despise 22oz format bottle. Overall, a great beer. A must try."

"I've only recently learned about de Garde (which is apparently only an hour south from where I live,) and I haven't had a chance to make it down yet.   I was pleasantly surprised when I walked into Hondo's and found this in the cooler."

"This is a really well priced beer (at least here in Portland) but it's sadly not a real standout to me, especially considering the ratings that I'm seeing up here."

"Overall:  this is a good sour beer.  It is surprisingly refreshing for how sour it is.  Like it."

"Bottle that froze during shipping and the cap popped a little. Because beer was frozen, only lost about a third. A bit flat but I can taste the promise."

"As good as the nose is, the palate is a whole different beast. This is thoroughly unconventional, lacking in the clean, bready lactic sourness of the traditional berlinerweisses and in its stead, it has a potent and inspired juicy, fruit tartness with a blend of preserved lemons, pineapple, heavily soured yogurt (if you've had yogurt in a tropical country in the summer, you know what I mean), moderate funk - a little bit of earth and mushroom are present - along with a hint of bread. The mid-palate continues the exploration of fruit as an expression in a Berlinerweiss, with semi-ripe white grapes, a blend of sourness, stone fruit and some citrus. Light in body, moderately carbonated, this beer has a long, tart finish, moderately yogurty and mostly fruity. While this beer is not a pure berlinerweiss, it is an inspired and an enjoyable beer. Highly recommended."

"Wow. For the abv there is tons of flavor. The tartness is unmistakeable. Just plain BU is awesome and crushable."

"Really has a nice lemon acidic thing going on up front then finishes with a good depth of flavor and crispy sourness. A bit more sour than most other of the style but also much cleaner without that grainy soggy wheat flavor."

"This is a light bodied brew with a modest to moderate amount of fizzy feel and carbonation. Overall this is a pretty solid berliner that I would love to drink again if the opportunity presented itself. My only gripe is that my idealistic berliner is one that I could crush glass after glass of in the summertime. This one has some serious bite to it and while sour heads might rejoice, I am left wishing the second pour didnt feel so much like a chore."

"you have to be a real fan of sour and farmhouse ales to like this one. if those are up your alley, this is a really good beer. almost kambucha-esque the way it smells like vinegar but tastes sour and fruity. very unique and different. this brewery came out of nowhere and I have enjoyed everything they make. not a beer for the masses though."

"O: I could drink quite a bit of this, especially if it's dialed in a little bit so that the taste becomes cleaner. Still, at 2.1%, there's a lot of flavor here."
"Couple of thoughts about this beer. I'm not a big sour fan, so maybe that's part of the problem, but I really felt the sour component in this beer was completely over the top. I'm assuming there is a considerable amount of lactic acid in this beer, as it struck me as the kind of beer that would give me an upset stomach pretty quickly were I to try to drink a bunch of it (the bartender indicated he liked the beer quite a bit, but admitted it was hard to imagine drinking very much of this - he agreed that drinking a lot of this would probably give a lot of people a stomach ache.). De Garde seems to be well thought of, so I'll definitely give some of their other beers a try, but IMHO this was not an exceptionally impressive effort on their part."

"Overall - Rough acidity. Unpleasant. Good fruitiness though."

"o. very imperessed. I would like morwe of this."

"First Beer I've had from this brewery, can't wait to see what they do next."

"Overall- at 2%ishthe i could drink this all day and all night and all day and... You get the point. Besides the color really a deliteful beer. I look forward to try more from De Garde."

"Drinkability is high if you like it super tart, which I do. Nice to see such a big flavor, low alcohol session ale, basically the definition of drinkability."
