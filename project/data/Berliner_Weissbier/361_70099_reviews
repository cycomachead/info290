"Verdict: A nice berliner from Bend Brewing, perhaps a bit too sour for my tastes, but the hibiscus is showcased well, decently balanced, but I'd like to see a bit more pomegranate in this. All in all, this is quite a refreshing and enjoyable beer, definitely would be a go to if I was local for summer sessions."

"Pour is darker amber, lightly hazed, tons of bubbly white head that sits forever.  Nose is very little grain, heavy lacto, a bit of dusty brett, lots of lemon, a bit sugary.  Flavor is also too sweet, again virtually no grain, not as lacto/brett heavy, but becomes even sweeter lemon and candied sugar.  Body isn't super light, carb is pretty spot on, gets a little juicy."
"this is excellent and real unique beer, i think the pomegranate comes through more in this neon pink colored berliner weisse than in any other beer made with the fruit i have had. the hibiscus is an accent flavor and aroma, rather than something perfumy and overbearing. the two actually go quite well together, and this beer is very sour. its got a puckery tart nose, lactic acid and lemon notes for sure, and then the fruit and flowers over the top of it. the sourness is really developed in the taste too, insanely tart in the finish especially. refreshing, but my one real critique of this thing is that it cant hold a head and that its carbonation is super light, it just doesnt feel like a berliner for that reason, ive said before, i really prefer my wild ales to be effervescent. not that its flat, but it just doesnt sing like it could and give life to the unique flavors. great fruit flavor though, and a really interesting finish. this is a beer unlike most others, and probably my favorite fruited berliner i can recall."

"Pours a hazy light red with a foamy bone head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace slowly drip into the remainig beer on the drink down. Smell is slightly sour with malt, grain, fruit, and hibiscus aromas. Taste is much the same with fruit and hibiscus flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of acidity on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer that is tasty, light, and easy to drink."
"Overall: This beer is the business! I want more Ching Ching! It is more of a sour beer than a Berlinner Weisse, but I have no complaints about the overall picture in reguards to Ching Ching. This beer was brewed with pomegranates and hibiscus, I didnt feel that either of those elements translated into the nose or flavor profile of the beer, but I do not really care at all because it that great of a beer. My advice to Bend Brewing Company is dont change a thing with this beer."

"dark ruby red pour with a nice head. smell is slightly tart cherries.... taste borders between a berliner weiss and an american fruit sour. tartness much more than sour and id give the nod to the berliner weiss side but its awesome and drinkable. i would drink this beer every day if available to me. light body with medium carbonation. terrific."

"Slight chill haze, delightful light rose color, with a huge three-finger puff of white head that settled to a thick cottony layer and held there, leaving sheets of lacing on the glass. An easy swirl kept the head going. Aroma was lacto, some light grains, pomegranate seeds and wildflowers. A little bit soapy, but that's probably not the beer's fault...it has been sitting in the fridge for several months. That said, the tartness really held up here in the taste, and there was quite a bit of puckering on the first sip, light but sour fruit notes--pomegranate, lemon, cranberry, raspberry--saliva-inducing acidity, tangy, dry grassiness, with a rock candy sweetness in the background. I'm really glad the flavor didn't fade on this one. Light-medium body, crisp, tart mouthfeel, super tasty and super drinkable. Lots of fruit character without being syrupy or cloying. Very nice overall. Cheers!"

"The body was crisply medium light, with a much appreciated very dry finish. Drinkability was excellent. Overall, a very, very good brew. A must try if you see it, and certainly worth some effort to get."

"pours a hazy orange with a medium white head. Aroma brings out fresh tart oranges, mangoes, and wheat. Flavor is very fruity and moderately tart, with tart oranges, mangoes and pomegranate, and light wheat. Super fruity, quite tart and extremely refreshing. Great depth to this and very flavorful. Very good."

"Overall - This suffered from being late in a tasting but it's clean and tasty."

"I'd be hard pressed to find a better berliner and I love Night Shift. Second bottle I've had. The pink color looks amazing. You can detect the fruit and tartness on the nose almost like a flavored lemonade. The body is just so quenching and easy to drink. This tastes like pomegranate juice with a squeeze of lime. This beer won gold for a reason."

"Clear orange amber with a thin pinkish head that falls off to a ring rather quickly. The nose is a riot. Hibiscus floral notes, fruity pomegranate, lactic tartness, some pomegranate seeds bitterness, and a mild bread note. The palate opens fruity, floral with the hibiscus  flavors - rose, juice- working really well with pomegranate and the sourness. There is a sharpness to the palate, clearly lactic but with a touch of white wine vinegar as well. Sharp lactic sourness, like really sharp yogurt on the finish with minimal wheat flavors. Fruity as well. Touch of seed bitterness. Light in body moderately carbonated, this is crisp and incredibly refreshing. Among the better Berliners I've had recently."

"Incredibly tasty fruited berliner."

"O- A very nice sour beer exploding with big fruit flavors especially berry fruits. Such an easy drinker despite the pretty intense sourness."
""
""
"O- This hits all the right points to be a very good beer. Kudos to Bend for turning out a complicated style like this."
""
"O: So, I confess that I thought this was a sour ale, and not a BW at first, and it's funny how reading the label drastically changed my perception of this. It's a great beer that showcases the pomegranate and hibiscus well. Even nicer that I get touches of raspberries even if they aren't actually present in the beer. I dare say you won't be disappointed."

"What a great beer. I sat near the window and watched the wind bring in autumn the leaves sailing down the street. In one hand my glass held the nectar the nectar that sours strive to be. Ching Ching it wasn't the empty can rolling down the road it was the incredible beer that was in my hand. I smiled at the beer and it kissed my palate."

"Overall: Impressive."
"O - Light and tart. Fruity and pleasant."
"One finger pinkish white head, fairly big bubbles, ultra-quick dissipation on top of lovely rouge colored hazy body (this beer just won't drop clear, I know this frustrated Tonya on v. 1), very little visible carbonation, just a few bubbles clinging to side of tulip glass, and once those were gone it was pretty flat. The floral notes from hops and hibiscus were prominent in the nose along with huge dose of pomegranate syrup. Taste is features the fruit up front, more tart than sour (to they make pomegranate sweet tarts?), and the hibiscus dried out the finish. Not a lot of effervescence present in the fairly light mouthfeel. Pretty refreshing, a fairly unique tasting experience. Not for pomegranate player-haters, a real sipper, refreshing."
"An okay beer. The flavours are pleasant but it lacks depth."
"Overall is really good an excellent summer offering. Glad I have another one of these."
"I expect fruit infused beers to still have an authentic 'beer like' character. While I found this interesting, it reminded me more of a wine cooler and less of a fruit beer, and I am a fan of Berliner Weisse and a variety of fruit ales. Sorry, I really wanted to like it."
