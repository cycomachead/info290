"- Overall a fantastic stone fruited light sour. For me, a perfect balance of juicy fruit and sourness. Not the most complex, but that is consistent with the style."

"Far too sour for a Berliner Weiss. Berliners should be tart, not palate-destroyingly sour."

"O- My new favourite beer from De Garde. Everything that Apricot Bu was, but even more delicious."

"Hands down the best apricot sour we had at our intensive tasting of the style."

"A fellow beard shared this with me and the rest of the house after I did the same with a different bottle at the De Garde tasting room. The apricot seemed to be there a bit more than the peach, but both were so there. Stellar stuff, the best of the day which is saying a lot. We also joked that a beardless man has probably never stepped in the place. Virtually true, I'm sure. :D Cheers,"

"The palate opens with a pleasant fruity tartness and flavor, glorious in how bright it is. Focused heavily on the apricot, it approaches Fou'foune in intensity. Semi-ripe peach character is present on the mid-palate with a mild peachy, vanilla like character. Yogurt and buttermilk are present towards the finish. The palate is just a shade green, but that's driven by how driven it is by the apricot flavors - I occasionally get a mild sulfury note from stone fruit, especially if I eat too much too soon, and this beer has those characteristics. Light in body, crisply (but not overly so) carbonated, this beer is a treat on the palate. Highly recommended. Given my love for apricots, I think I just might prefer this over the also excellent Berry Bu that preceded it."
"Much lighter than I was expecting. Easy drinking summer shandy. Nice fresh fruit flavor."

"Nice but subtle stone fruit. A bit acetic. Bitter pit flavor on the finish."

"A lot going on in this beer.  I get a lot of tropical fruit up front on the palate (mostly peach i would say), but the beer dries out quickly, and the finish is dry and lightly sour.  This was very easy to drink, and I appreciated the dialed down sour and easy drinkability.  Very nice beeer."
