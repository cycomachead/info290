"Overall, this beer is fairly sour, but not so much as to be distracting. This really reminds me of an adult lemonade, perfect for quenching your thirst on a hot day. The kiwi gives the base berliner an added level of complexity and really improves the overall flavor of the beer."
"The aroma on this is interesting, but ultimately, slightly off putting. Still a very good beer."

"Pours a milky, clouded pale yellow with a finger of quickly fading white head.  Lemony nose, slightly sour and yogurt, with some light tropical notes.  Fairly sour flavor, some kiwi fruit, green and lemony, wheat and light yeast.  Medium thick, highly carbonated body with a puckering, milky finish."

"Overall - Smells pretty bad, but the kiwi sourness is nice.  Simple beer."

"The beer is a simple and well crafted ""one two"" punch of kiwi fruit and tart Berliner."
"O- Solid, not mindblowing but actually a pretty good expression of what I imagine kiwi in a sour beer to be. Better than Upland Kiwi for sure. [4]"
