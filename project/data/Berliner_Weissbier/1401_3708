There is also a residual yeasty character at the finish that lingers between quaffs. Mouthfeel is light in body with a pleasant citrus astringency and an assertive carbonation.

But, I am a big fan of sour, so I might be slightly upwardly biased toward this beer. The beer poured a clear yellow with very little head. There wasn't a whole lot in the aroma, but what little there was faintly fruity with just a touch of malt sweetness. The flavor though was entirely different. There was a great light fruitiness, just a little wheat, and lots of sour. The best part was that no matter how long you held the beer in your mouth, the sour flavor seemed to stick around. The finish leaves a sourness in the bottom of your jaw that makes you salivate.

The bubbly head soon declines to minor lace hinting of its claim as the ""champagne of the north"". The aroma is sour, slightly candyish and bready also suggesting this claim. Tart, but smooth honeyish undertones, and slightly woody and vegetal, the result of a complex fermentation involving both top-fermenting and lactic strains of yeast. No hops detected although hop extract is used in moderation, a most enjoyable finish that is lengthy and complex: there's a crisp, green apple quality with tastes of yeastand bone-dry white wine. The tartness persists throughout, but is always softened by underlying honeyed tones. A refreshing taste of brewing history and well worth the search.","karst","Nov 06, 2006"

It was very crisp with good carbonation. I added the shot of juice to it and the character changed dramatically. The tartness of the beer balanced very well with the sweetness of the raspberry juice.

I have seen different methods for pouring the beer and the sauce, generally with the sauce going in first, followed by the beer. I prefer it poured with a thick head and the sauce over.

High carbonation and acidity seems to increase perception of mouthfeel. All in all, Ive never had a beer quite like this before, and might never have the chance again. I enjoyed it. It was definitely an experience to remember. I dont think Id buy a case of the stuff, but it might be nice to sample on occasion. I mixed the last few gulps with a few drops of raspberry liqueur now that was tasty! Still very sour, but the little sugar helped balance out some of the acidity. Thats the way to drink it.

I ordered with an apple syrup flavor also. The blend was very smooth, sweet and sour mix, like a beery soft drink. I could see the flavored version being a favorite quencher in lieu of a heavier beer or an overly fruity lambic. Mouthfeel (w/ syrup) is medium and satisfying. Drinkability (w/ syrup) is very good.

Smell consisted of lemon aromas, some slight yeast, sour like, almost on the border of geuze/lambic with the sour aromas. Taste was a little weird. Huge lemon flavors rush towards the palate with some tart flavors mixing in as well. Finishes on the clean side to my surprise. A little spritzy as well. I have to try a few of these to see if I like this beer or not. A really ""out there"" style.","necoadam","0"

A bone white, very compact head, with tight little bubbles of carbonation. Flavor was almost non-existant with just a slight fruitiness to it. No real grain flavor but I detected a little oxidation so I'm not sure of the freshness, but it was well within the drink by date on the bottle. Crisp spritzy mouthfeel that ended with a sour/tart bite. Not that impressed, but its probably better when fresh and I will seek out others within the style.","Longstaff","Jul 02, 2004"

There is a hint of complexity in the nose, some herbal grassiness perhaps. This is very dry, and not nearly as sour as I was hoping. It is quite soft up front, but has a sharp sourness in the finish that is reminiscent of fresh lemonade. Though light bodied, there is a certain amount of creamy fullness to this beer. Certainly this is nice and refreshing, but lacks a certain complexity that I like and can be found in Schultheiss' version.","Gueuzedude","May 23, 2004"

It tastes of medium bitnerness with a heavy wheat flavor, like an excellent American wheat but not really like most Belgian whites that I have had. Weisse is very light and drinkable, though and I will probably have another on account of its smoothness.","chugamugofsud","Apr 22, 2004"

The beer poured a pale golden color with a small fizzy head that went down to a mm size above the beer. Lots of bubbles raced to the top and they continued to do that for almost the whole time. The smell was quite sour and a bit wheaty. The taste was not near as sour as the smell. I still noticed the sourness but it wasn't like a gueze. The body was extremely light and airy. That left for an odd sensation of lightness combined with a sour aspect, I have never really experienced that. There was a slighly wheaty undertone to this beer as well. I actually really enjoyed it and would recommene everybody to try this once. Personally I don't see how the syrup would help this beer at all. It is so light that it seems like syrup would oversweeten it imo. The only true drawback to this beer is the price $3.29 for 11.2 oz. Is that normal!? Seemed a little outrageous (esp for a 2.5% abv beer). Still, I am glad i had it.","granger10","Apr 05, 2004"

Pours a very pale yellow with a white foamy head that stuck around for a while. Did not get much lace though. Could not find much of a smell. The taste is primarily one sensation, sour. This stuff will make you pucker. I could say however that it was refreshing. This would be good to revisit in the summer. Even though it was so sour, I found it to be drinkable. The syrup was a nice touch, but I could have this plain. This was a very interesting experience.

Its kind of hard for me to say what I think about this beer since its not really the conventional beer. Also, I have only tried it once and with the syrup so I couldn't tell you how it tastes straight from the bottle. The taste of it the way I had was sour and obviously fruity. It basically tasted like candy and not like a beer. I do, however like sour drinks and can't knock the taste. It was good for the experience but I'll have to try it without the syrup next time.","wsouloa","Feb 13, 2004"

Not much smell, picked up some malt as it warms. Taste,sour. Not bitter, more like a lemon. It almost makes you pucker up you lips. On a hot day, you would think you're drinking lemonaide. After you get past the initial sour shock, it's not hard to drink. At the low ABV, this could be a good hot day, drink more then a few, beer.","57andcounting","Jan 17, 2004"

Hazy straw color. My first true sour wheat style (although I've had some wheats that turned out that way unintentionally). Lemony, mouth-puckering sour! Like wheat beer dosed with ascorbic acid, or sweet-tart candy. But I like it! Perfect for afternoon lounging on the patio - very refreshing. Despite the sourness, it finished quite clean and dry, and was most drinkable.

The beer is very light in color and looks almost like an american lager. I tried it first without the raspberry and found it very tart and sour with a hint of citrus and apple. Not really refreshing in anyway for me. Next we added the syrup and mixed it up. About 2 oz. seemed like the right amount. The combination of tartness and sweetness is a nice blend. This time I taste green apples. This is a most unusual drink and is worth trying once. It is also served with a green syrup made with the herb woodruff.
