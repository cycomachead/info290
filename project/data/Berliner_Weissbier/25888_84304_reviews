"The beer pours very cloudy, was a little turbid but not in a bad way. I felt like it was more like that and it had a kind of creamy/heavy mouth feel because they used real peaches in the brew so there was pulp in it. Smelled like peaches (surprise). It was more sour than any other berliner weisse I've ever had and it lacked a funkyness characteristic that i get when I drink 1809 so I don't know if I would really call this a Berliner but I would compare it more to Pizza Boy Peach Funker which is an American Wild because of the sourness and mouth feel. If you see this it is definitely worth a try, not the best peach sour I've had but it is a solid beer."

"Overall a nice, light, drinkable Berliner."

"O: This one was recommended by several people, so I finally caved, as I am not a huge fan of anything sour. It was not at all what I was expecting. The tart lacto was much more subdued than is normal for the style. The buttered popcorn and candied peach really complemented each other nicely I thought. Will definitely buy this one again at some point."

"This was a pretty interesting beer, I've never had a peach beer or berliner weiss that tasted like this. If you like peaches and cream, I'd say seek this out."

"while I enjoyed the beer I did not get as much peach as I would have liked.  perhaps the overcarbonation removed some of the peach, but overall I enjoyed the beer"

"Hazy golden orange body pours into a chalice with great effervescent head, fine speckled bubbles left behind as it settles down a bit.  Aroma has pungent acidity, chalky yeast notes, and earthy peach pits with a bit of flesh evident of actual fruit.  Flavor just think very tart and refreshing peach tea tannin notes with peach pit notes and dry acidity lactic fruit yogurt (maybe a Chobani).  Dries the palate from every direction, I popped some Nexium earlier and I'm glad that I did.  Effervescent well done carbonation levels carries this lively tart lower abv ale across my palate nicely, light to medium bodied with a bone dry finish.  Overall impressed with the use of fruit so subtle where they used loads of real peaches in a classic German berliner weisse."

"Had really high hopes for this but it was kind of a let down.  Didn't pick up any peach flavor.  More traditional style with less sourness and more wheat favors in the for front.  Not terrible, but didn't meet expectations."
""
""
""
""
""
"The peach flavors are spectacular. The base Berliner Weiss is fairly tame, but I suppose it's just there to set the stage for the peach. Definitely worth a try."
"It's mild and delicate and done just right. A bit off to style, but it's delightful and the peach is true and real. I'll take another."

"Overall, seemed an accurate to style and very tasty and refreshing beer. Well done."

"Nice label, bottled 8/14 poured 10/14. Pours a thin bubbly head, dots of lacing that slide quickly back into the beer. Color is what you would expect; blonde, hazy pinkish hues just like a ripe peach. Smells like a ripe peach too, no guessing here this beer is what it claims to be. First sip is undeniable refreshing, fresh peaches, medium low sourness, sweetness from the peaches, soft and drinkable. Great beer, not a lot of depth but I could drink this all night long on a warm summer evening ."

"Pour is pale hazed yellow with a white head.  Nose is a little green, tons of dusty brett, with sugary sweetness.  Taste is a little less green, a bit of an off plastic note, lots of sweetness, faint sugary candied peach in back.  Syrupy body, light carb, prickly finish."

"Hazy yellow body with a bubbly, white head. Sweet peach aroma. Juicy with a strong sour finish. Light bodied with moderate carbonation. Pretty good."

"I served this on a wonderful spring Easter Sunday with the sun ashining and 70*F. Now, I started out drinking IPA's before this Berliner. And might I say this Berliner started out like a sour mess so I put it away. Trying it again I thought its pretty tasty and came to a conclusion that this style cannot be mixed with others or at least drink this first IMO. I appreciate the effort of hundreds of pounds of Michigan peaches added to this. But to be fair I really didn't get a lot of peach. Anyway, tasty nonetheless."

"Overall: Really awesome Berliner Weisse, the only thing I can think of is just a little bit more peach flavor might make it stand out from other great examples of the style."

"A light poppy ale that would be very refreshing in warm weather. Pretty good although I have had better BWs, but it's nice to see more breweries experimenting with the style. Worth trying if you can get it at a decent price."

"yet another Berliner that is slightly off the authenticity track, but tastes darn good. on tap at hops and pie right now, this beer reminds me more of festina peche from dogfish than the true berliners. hazy pale yellow color, soda bubbles, sweet and fruity nose with plenty of yeast to balance the sweet. more funk than tart or sour, but a clean, low acid feel to it. the flavor features prominent peach, fresh and ripe, a nice use of the fruit. wheat malt is in abundance, and there is a tartness, but its subtle, and its after the swallow. I like the lightness and brightness of this, the feel really works. aggressive carbonation cuts the sweet of the fruit and aids the funky finish, but I expect quite a bit more lactic tartness is my Berliner Weiss than this. still, another fun and tasty brew from perennial, who seems to be really exploding into the Colorado market lately. good for them, good for us."

"Overall: Not bad, but the strange aftertaste keeps this one from being really good. If It were cheaper, I'd recommend giving it a try, but at it's price point I would pass on it in the future."

"Overally, a very good take on the style, and one that can be used for people who don't necessarily prefer sours but are interested in trying more or learning to like them. In fact, this bottle was shared with several people who would say they weren't fans of sour beer, but each one of them liked this beer. It's a crossover, a mind-opener, if you will."

"Overall quite different than most peach beers and even Berliner Weisse's I've had but there's not much peach to this and I've had better Berliners."

"Perhaps not as tart as some of the originals but this one is very drinkable and with the peach character I am not reaching for some sort of syrup to be able to quaff it back. Very well done."
""
""
""
"O: There was a pleasant tartness to this beer but not quite the light sourness that I expected for the style - though that is fine and I found the addition of the peaches to be a really nice touch. Very easy ti drink, enjoyable, and refreshing."
"O: This beer is nice and peachy but is easy to drink because it is hardly sour and this masks ut any sweetness from the peaches."

"Overall quite nice, surprised how well the blend of peach flavors and sour Berliner Weiss flavors went together, a very nice beer, but a little lacking on the sour aroma. The peach came through very well, and the Berliner Weiss eventually came through on the flavor nicely."
"O - Overall I was floored by this beer. So peachy and Berliner it is just so balanced and tasty I need to get more of this."
""
""
"Overall - Wish it were sour... Good peach aroma though."
""

"Peach Berlinerweisse is best served cold as it is crisp and refreshing. I like to drink it with dinner during the ever more frequent heatwaves in the mid-west (July 2012 108 degrees in StL) This beer is light and tasty, very peachy!"

"Lighter body, decent carbonation, juicy and thin on the tongue. Pretty solid fruit-based Berliner but there's some much better examples out there right now (ie - Funky Buddha)."
"O- this was okay, nothing offensive but it just didn't do much for me, much better examples of the style out there"
""
"One of the worst beers I've had in a while and a huge letdown after how much I loved Perennial at FOBAB. This tastes like a light lager and I've never had a berliner before that was this bad. Not remotely tart. Just a bad all around beer. Hopefully it was just a bad bottle and/or Perennial will start bottling their better stuff soon."
"O: This is a pleasant and sufficiently peachy berliner. Very nice."
""
"The first offering I've had from this brewery. Really solid overall but the price tag ($20) is a bit much for this Berlinerweisse. It'd be my go to if it was more affordable though. Definitely worth trying."
"o - Overall a pretty decent berliner. The nose has some peach but is pretty average; isn't sour at all and not much funk. The taste has more of both, though still light, and is pretty nice, and the mouthfeel is spot on for the style. A good beer that I would have again based on the actual beer itself, but would never buy again for that price. Hard to justify paying ~$20-21 for a bottle of a decent berliner when there are better beers out there for cheaper. Would pass at this price but maybe try it again if I saw it on tap for a decent price."
""
""
"O: Light and easy drinking, definitely some peach there, but a little light for what I was hoping for. Would have liked a touch more tartness as well."
""
"its enjoyable, but not what I was hoping for. I paid $20 for this bottle in NYC and am disappointed that it was this much of a let down from the price."
""
""
"Just like RisGoop, I've had this before on-tap, but the experience was kinda iffy on my part, so I'm glad to have a second chance. It pours a lightly hazy wan straw topped by a finger of off-white foam. The nose comprises light white grape, cinnamon, and light wheat. The taste holds notes of light peach, white grape, lemon juice, and light wheat. Not really much tartness at all, which is a decent disappointment considering the style in question. The body straddles the line between discord and rhy--I mean, heavy light and light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a sorta/kinda dry finish. Overall, this is a mediocre Berliner, with little-to-no tartness and the same amount of peach, really. It's not overly offensive, necessarily, but there's nothing about it that makes me want to drink it ever again."
"O: This is a very light, but rather refreshing beer whose delicate and simplistic flavor profile would probably be better enjoyed on a hot summer day. That said I remember having this at GTMW and don't recall it being an overly exciting beer on that summer day either."
"Poured into glass. Appearance is pale and bubbly with white head. Reminds me of pouring a glass of champagne. The nose is fruity with pithy peach, lemon, and dry notes of wheat bread. The taste is relatively tart up front with plenty of fruit in the middle. This is light and refreshing, probably better served on a hot summery day outdoors. The peach doesn't make a huge appearance, but overall, a solid version of the style."

"D - Had this at Great Taste and loved it. Strange that the peach seemed stronger on draft without the nutmeg I am getting now."
"This is a light bodied brew with a moderate amount of carbonation. It is light and easy drinking and an overall nice interpretation of the style. I really enjoyed the natural peach flavoring here that at times seemed to add it's own level of tartness to the already present lacto that was lemon-like. Overall solid balance with enough sweet cereal grain inclusion to keep this one very easy drinking. I would partake in this again."
"Its just Ok, A bit underwhelming for the premium they are charging."
""
"O - This is a really good beer, although it really bends the definition of Berliner Weiss style."
""
""
""
""
""
"This beer is really, really, really drinkable. Very light and smooth, and at 4.2% you could drink it for days. Excellent for these last summer days."
"O- Umm...very refreshing beer. Not very educated on Berlinerweiss's but I thought it would be more sour/tart. It is still a nice refreshing light beer that has some fruit and sour notes."
"Overall this is a super beer. Ridiculously drinkable due to the low ABV, balanced fruit and sour flavor profile and just overall delicious flavor. A great balance of fruit and sour session ale."
""
""
"Pretty good offering by the guys at Perennial. I like what they are accomplishing over there."
"Crisp clean lactic tartness in the taste, bright and quenching. Fruity peach note is tart with no sweetness, sort of in the background. Less fruity and sour than Festina Peche. Very light bodied, dry finish, clean aftertaste with a hint of fruit. Overall it's highly drinkable and a great beer to quench thirst in the summer heat. Hope to see this on draft around town before summer is over."
""
""
"D - This is a nice take on the style by Perennial - I haven't had one with fruit before and really enjoyed it. Tart, refreshing, flavorful, low abv? Yes, please."
