Some lactic acidity and tart lemons with a super funky and ripe brett. Makes ne think of vitamins and dog food. Tastes better than the nose, lots of tart lemons and lactic acid with that odd funk in the background. Prickly carbonation with a little bit of lip smacking. Easy drinking aside from that odd funk.

The taste of the beer is in fact a lot like a fresh lemonade, makes the taste buds tingle and almost makes the lips pucker. The mouthfeel is decently carbonated with a very light body. Overall this beer is pretty good, I liked it better once the Raspberry syrup was added but that's because I am not a big sour beer fan. Still worth a try.","Knapp85","Nov 09, 2012"

3.88,4.9,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Light body, solid carbonation, goes down super easy. Totally sessionable. Tarter and funkier than most American Berliners I’ve tried. Recommended, but only to those who don’t mind a little funky foot cheese wafting all up in their grills.","tobelerone","Aug 03, 2012"
3.73,0.8,3.5,3,4,4,4,"Pretty mild on the tartness and slightly acidic on the back of the tounge. The taste seems to fade out towards the end. Light bodied and boldly carbed up. The low ABV makes it easy for a few, i hope to find some six packs some day.","BARFLYB","Jul 22, 2012"

3.46,-6.5,3.5,2.5,4,3.5,3.5,"Poured from a bottle into a Just Kidding (Jester King) snifter. Pours a very pale, yet at the same time opaque, straw color with a minimal head that recedes/disappears entirely, very quickly. The smell is, well, strange. I'm not going to use the "f" word because I hate it's usage in describing a beer in any capacity. In fact, I don't know how to describe it. It's just...and off smell. It smells the way no beer oughta smell. This beer isn't sour, but it's super tart...like a Sweet Tart or something. It has a touch of sweetness to it as well. The finish is tart, with a sort of graininess to it. It's actually pretty clean and crisp, all things considered. One of this beer's more endearing qualities. Overall, I can see this being refreshing as hell on a scorching summer day where I typically don't even have the desire to consume beer. Otherwise, I can't see myself reaching for one of these. More a product of my own personal taste than because of the beer's quality.","Retail1LO","May 13, 2012"

3.38,-8.6,4,3.5,3.5,3,3,"Thanks to yourefragile for sharing this bottle. Served in a mini gueuze tumbler. Pours a nice straw color with a fizzy white head that recedes like a soda. Thin collar for a bit. The nose has a light bit of lactic acidity and lemon alongside a moderate wheat character. Flavor is fairly wheaty with mild acidity. Not much fruit there. No off character. Body is light and crisp with a touch of acidity and a nice wheat-driven dryness. Pretty good, but nothing over the top.","Thorpe429","Apr 29, 2012"
3.98,7.6,4,3.5,4,4,4.5," The taste is very full with nice fruity zesty and lactic tanginess which seems like a slight tangy green apple mixed with the sweet tart of kumquat with some wheat elements which are earthy, but not quite funky with a light tinge of sour which seems to liven the overall flavor as it becomes dry in the final tastes. Overall I thought this was a nice take on the style. This is not over the top sour wheat but nice and balanced in a traditional berliner style I really enjoyed.","Slatetank","Apr 22, 2012"

3.82,3.2,3.5,4,4,3.5,3.5,"This is not a bad take on the style. It is light bodied and has a short lived effervescent level of carbonation that while initially is active, it gets swirled out of solution quite easily. It fits the bill for the style with some unique character to it that I feel is reminiscent of sour mashing and brett included in this. The sheer amount of yeast and wheat protein stuck in solution hinders that crisp snap I look for in the finish of a berliner. That gripe aside, I enjoyed this and will have no issue polishing off another glass.","stakem","Dec 15, 2011"

Round Guys, this is a giant leap forward to set yourselves up for being a killer brewer of this style. Absolutely well done - I cannot wait for either some growler fills or bottles of this eventually. I kept going back to the booth for this beer until it ran dry.","ShanePB","0"
