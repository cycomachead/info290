"Nice and tart, delicious with raspberry syrup!"

"Poured a clear, golden hue with a small amount of white head (not to style as I understand, perhaps a bit more carbonation would be nice). Hint of lactic sourness on the nose, not much else. not a strong aroma. Lactic sourness on the palate right up front, some hints of white grape, and some bright lemon notes. Crisp and tangy. Effervescent with a nice, dry finish. Nice beer. One of my first Berliner-style beers. I am sure that there are some whoppers out there, but this was a nice taste of the style for a good price. Berliner-style might be making it to the homebrew queue."

"This is my session beers of choice. Clean. Crisp. And refreshing."

"O- Love this style right now. This one isn't bad, but not the best I've had. However, it was much cheaper than most Berliners I've had."
""
"It's soft and fluffy on the tongue but not exactly crisp.  The acidity hits nicely but it a touch brief."

"Overall a good beer and one of their better new beers. Surprised ratings are so low on this one; a little simple but executed well and refreshing; would like to have it again. Reminds me slightly as a sour gose. Worth checking out."

"The flavor has tangy yeast with light toasted wheat flavor and mild acidity in the feel with wheat present in the taste with slight lemony juiciness and dry taste with slight tanginess in the finish. Overall a pretty easy drinking berliner-not exceptional but decent wheat beer in general terms."

"Clean and easy take. Just tart enough. Typically solid Ithaca ""sour."""

"First impressions, mild cloudiness to the eye, a  crisp and clean slight citrus aroma, and to the taste a well balanced wheat with a level of sour not to overpowering and flavor hints of apple, lime, and orange.  On a hot summer day this is a refreshing beer that you can drink a few without getting"

"Overall - At my surprise, this is the first time ive had this style?? Not overly impressed with the mild sour/bitterness. Seems like its awfully light and mild for the style. Im going to seek out this style to compare to this one."

"Overall: I really enjoyed this one and think it is one of Ithaca's better beers. Super sessionable. It tastes like a good pilsner mixed with a Berliner Weiss. Nice, light, and refreshing."

"This is a decent Berliner-weisse. Seems to be kind of a grainy tone to things though. The sour and tart seems mild and is in no way abrasive. Naturally, I could deal with a sharper amount of it all. It does seem to be more pronounced as it warms up. Aas it is, it's a pretty decent example of the style."
""
"O: This beer is very easy to drink and has some refreshing properties. It is a good representation of the style."
""
""
"Overall: A nice berliner weisse. Could be more tart and sour, but still enjoyable."
""
""
"O: OK, mild, refreshing, not a ton of flavor. Wouldn't turn it down, wouldn't seek it out."
"O - Very drinkable session beer especially on a hot day. Nothing really stands out as being exceptional either for the style or in general. Probably a good beer for someone who is not really into beer as it is not all that sour with pretty mild favors."

"Pale golden straw color pours with an effervescent white head, nice looking Berliner Weiss here folks. Even fine speckled lacing looks great poured into a flared chalice. Aromatics bring out tart lemon notes, slightly chalky yeast components, and some yogurt like lactic notes combined complexity into a refreshing summer release from Ithaca brewing company. Clean bright tartness, refreshing chalky yeast component, lacks any off putting phenolics which is a good thing. Lemon, tartness would work perfect with some cilantro spiced pico de gallo mahi mahi fish tacos. Mouthfeel finishes dry like the backend of the sour scale of a Warhead/sour patch kid candy, carbonation is moderate rolling cleanses the palate with the nice bone dry finish. Overall a quality version of an under served style, more summer refreshers slightly sour and funky works for my palate."

"O: I really wanted to like this beer. I love Berliner Weisse beers and wasa excited to see a low-cost prevalently available beer of this style. Unfortunately, it just didnt hit the mark, significantly less carbonation than most Berliners and barely any sour notes. Tasted like a fairly plain wheat beer :("

"Standard weisse flavors of light wheat, tangy lacto tartness, lemon, and there's some more added phenolics. Not as grassy as the nose, but those herbaceous qualities are there. Thin-bodied, with a good combo of carbonation rustle and esophagus tartness sting. More acidic feeling than it is sour. Likeable."
"Just not all that good, it was kind of boring."

"Pours a clear, but pale straw with a small, quickly dissipating head. Looks like ginger ale, just what I'm craving on this warm, sunny day. Smells incredibly fresh and clean, with light citrus notes, especially lemon and maybe even a subtle hint of the ginger ale that is fitting from the appearance. Taste is not what I would expect, much lighter and more tart. There's no banana or clove, but tons of citrus, ginger, lemongrass, along with green apple, a slightly herbaceous (grassy) note toward the end, with long, smooth tones of wheat present throughout that gets more pronounced toward the end. The finish is packed with wheat with the lingering taste of lemon, clean, and refreshing. Mouth-feel is lighter than I typically expect from a weisse, but welcome--very light, crisp, and refreshing. I'm realizing this is a Berliner weisse (my first in a long while), which is distinct from the hefeweizens (most hailing from southern Germany, such as the area around Munich) and Belgian witbiers upon which I had been basing my expectations. Perfect summer beer!"

"The beer pours a pale yellow, like mildly dehydrated piss, forming an eggshell white head of soda-like bubbles that quickly fizzle to a scrim. In body, the beer is supremely clean and clear with a mellow trickle of carbonation bubbles moving through the beer. The clarity is honestly a little odd for the styleâ€¦ Where is all the wheat? On the nose, the beer smells tart lemon, yogurt and granola, and a smooth, wheat bread smell on the back of the sniff. This is a very clean and crisp smell. On the tongue, the beer tastes refreshingly tart with a balancing, bready sweetness that moves in with the middle of the sip, yet the finish is elegantly dry and refined. There might be a touch of salinity if I really dig into the flavors, but really this beer is a simple tart and sweet, which is exactly what it should be. In flavor, it begins as tart lemon juice, which moves into greek yogurt flavors that become rich with just a touch of salinity, and then some sweet, fruity green apple. The finish is a lovely blend of wheat dough with hints of wheat flakes and just a touch of lemon juice. In the mouth, the beer feels light in body, with a crisp, effervescent carbonation, a clean and crisp mouthfeel, and a tremendous drinkability. When the beer leaves, the mouth is left slightly wet from acidty, yet clean and refreshed, making this beer awesome for summer thirst quenching. Overall, I like this beer. It is an excellent six-pack Berliner Weisse. Simple flavors mesh together for just enough to interest the sip, while mouthfeel makes the beer very crushable. This is a great day drinker, and would probably pair very well with a syrup (if you go that way). This is a great sessioning Berliner Weisse. People need to make more six-pack Berliners."

"Pours a light straw with a bit of haze and a fat head of white foam. Looks very inviting. The nose is citric and has a bit of lemon on it. Also has a delightful bit of faint cracker. It's a touch funky but not too much. Taste is light and has a bit of cracker on the tongue. The fruit is tart and the lactic sourness makes you pucker a bit. Simple, refreshing. Plentiful and active carbonation gives it s sprtizy feel. I think Ithaca has made a wonderful Berliner here. As it drinks it's dry and even a touch woody. Very simple and easy to drink."
