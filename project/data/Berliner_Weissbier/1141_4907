Served from bottle into a Mikkeller taster flute. Poured a deep ruby red with a half finger pink head that subsided to a minimal amount quickly. Maintained nice lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, raspberry, fruit, funk, earth, and tart. The flavor was of sweet malt, raspberry, strawberry, funk, subtle earth, tart, and sour. It had a light feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was a pretty good brew. If I am honest I have to say that this was one of the best Berliners that I’ve had to-date. The raspberry boomed through on each sip and kept me begging for more. The tart and sour aspect worked really well with the fruity sweetness. This made for a unique and down-right tasty combination if I am honest. A really well done brew that I’m glad I got to experience!","thagr81us","Oct 29, 2012"

Nose is bright, with fresh raspberries, wheat and some lactic notes. Taste is tart initially, with lactic notes coating the mouth before revealing the raspberries. Some light acetic acid makes a brief appearance. Light green apple and a good body provided by an abundance of wheat. Body has a good weight to it. High carbonation which bubbles away leaving the raspberries and some slight tartness hanging around on the palate. Had to swirl this down just a bit to get it to a slightly better carbonation (personal preference), but it was great as is. A solid fruit beer, perfect all around for summer imbibing. I could enjoy this quite often given the opportunity.","liamt07","Jul 17, 2011"

When Luk gave it to me as an extra, I decided to hold off for a bit to try it knowing I would probably enjoy it. I am very happy I was not let down. I can only hope this beings to be imported to the United States (I believe it is only available in Canada as of now). If so, I would buy as much of this as I could. Fantastic.","SpdKilz","Jul 11, 2011"

4.53,5.8,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Listed as 5.9 abv, this beer pours a super vibrant red with shades of pink and appears more red than Gambrinus or any other beer with raspberries that I've seen. The smell and taste are the same in terms of fruit foward raspberries as it almost seems you're drinking carbonated sour raspberry juice most of the time. There is some hearty wheat in the nose as well, while the lactic sourness is very refreshing when combined with the perfectly ripened raspberry flavor. I don't normally like to compare within a review, but this beer is basically what I had expected Bottleworks XII to be. Instead it is simple, but simply delicious.","sarro","Jun 08, 2010"
4.57,6.8,4.5,5,4.5,4,4.5,"Overall: One of my favorite DDC beers. Raspberries are my favorite fruit and this beer really lets them shine. While certainly tart, it still is a world-class brew and is worth driving 2+ hours round trip to the brewery to get.","papat444","Jul 05, 2009"

4.6,7.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,"Brilliant red body with a pinkish thin head. Huge raspberry nose. It smells exactly like real raspberries. Taste is killer. Perfect raspberries right up front and super strong. Again, real pure raspberry taste. Very tart and delicious. Thin bodied. Phenomenal drinkability.","drseamus","Aug 23, 2008"

4.24,-0.9,2.5,3.5,4.5,4.5,5,"Taste: Whoh, this stuff is tang-tastic! Lip-smacking, like pure, unsweetened cranberry juice. May not be for everyone, but I seriously believe that it's impossible to make a Beer more refreshing than this. Light, wheaty body, and a dry mead aftertaste. This stuff is kick ass.","Goldorak","Beers"

4.73,10.5,5,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,"I'm thinking of making the drive from So. NH to Montreal just to have this brew!  This is an interpretation of the Berliner Weisse style done avec fruit (strawberry, raspberry, or blueberry), with this lovely example being enhanced by the raspberry.  Strikingly beautiful rose red color with pinkish head.  Tart?? Can I hear ya say "Hell Ya"!!  Freshly picked raspberries run bone-dry through the finish. This isn't for the faint of heart, a definate no-no for non-BA women drinkers looking for one of them funky-ass sweet fruit brews.","beerboy21","0"
