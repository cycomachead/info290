"A fine Berliner Weiss."
""
"Normally, I'm not a fan of sour or fruit beers.  My husband ordered this at a local gastro pub and decided he didn't like it.  As someone who hates to see beer go to waste, I decided to finish it up for him.  Surprisingly, I actually liked this beer quite a bit.  Open the first taste, you get a bit of dry sourness but then it turns into a round, juicy flavor that I rather enjoyed.  I might need to rethink sour beers now."

"Drinkability â€“ A sour cidery beer without much blueberry flavor."

"Not something I expected at all. Very sour and I am not a fan of sours. But I thought the blueberry taste would make it a sweeter more palatable beer."

"Not my favorite berliner weiss style...very sweet.  Tastes like smarties"
"I commend Evil Twin for getting an authentic, fairly strong blueberry flavor into a beer but for me it seems like there is a divide between the fruit and the Berliner and they don't ever find a complete marriage."

"Lots of peeps be all like, ""Waaaaa! Not enough Blueberry, blah blah blah"". Well too bad. Chock full of tart blueberry flavor bub, super tasty. Pretty pink color too that make all the ladies go ""Ohhhh!!! Look at that manly man drinking a pink beer! Waz his phone number?!"" Almost drinks like a cider with that yummy lacto funk. 10/10 would drink again."

"Pour is a dark copper with a ruby hue and a lot of off white head.  Nose is fleshy and meaty blueberry followed by a dirty malt, a lot of sugars, and a hint of lime. Taste is hot, fake meaty blueberry, dirty malts and grain, a hint of acetic acid, moderate acidity, and sugary finish.  Body is messy, medium body, prickly finish."

"O - Glad I gave this one a try, but I was hoping for much more blueberry than I got. I would definitely recommend it for anyone that enjoys the style, though."
"Nice looking body, orange, pink, amber tones with a soapy, white head. Aroma is tart fruit, unripened blueberries, grassy wheat. Taste is on point. Tart, puckering sourness, lots of fruity flavors, an earthy wheat finish. Body is sticky, puckering, tart, lingering finish. A great take on the style, I'm a fan."

"Smelled tart sweet and slight like blueberries. Taste at first was very tart whith a solid sweet/tart blueberry taste to it. At first it was a little less tart than I hoped for until. I poured the rest of the bottle into my cup with all the yeast at the bottom. That kicked it up a notch and was much more mouth puckering tarty with sour blueberry tones. Solid Berliner and would like to drink again."

"Super drinkability, if this wasn't so bloody expensive, I'd drink this all summer. Not 100% married to the style, but this is a damn good beer"
"This is my first experience with this style of beer and I'm not quite sure what to expect. It poured a hazy purple amber color with a fizzy white head and almost no lacing. The aroma was a funky blend of lemon, blueberries, and yeast. Mouth was light and refreshing. There is no coating effect and the flavor (aside from the bite) only lasts as long as the sip. The flavor is quite tart and acidic. Lots of lemon; even more so than the blueberries (of which there are an abundance of). Virtually no alcohol bite and absolutely no malt. This is different; not sure its my cup of tea but refreshing and interesting none the less."

"22 ounce bottle into tulip glass, no bottle dating. Pours slightly hazy deep orange copper color with a 1-2 finger fairly dense light pink head with solid retention, that reduces to ring of lacing. Slight spotty lacing clings on the glass, with some light streaming carbonation. Aromas of tart blueberry, lemon, cherry, green apple, hay, straw, vinegar, musty funk, wheat, bread, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good complexity and balance of fruity/funky yeast, blueberry, and moderate malt notes; with good strength. Taste of tart blueberry, lemon, cherry, green apple, hay, straw, vinegar, musty funk, wheat, bread, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Good amount of fruity tartness on the finish; with lingering notes of blueberry, lemon, cherry, green apple, hay, straw, vinegar, musty funk, wheat, bread, herbal, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice complexity and balance of fruity/funky yeast, blueberry, and moderate malt flavors; with a great sweetness/tartness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth, crisp, and moderately acidic mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish as expected for 4.5%. Overall this is an excellent Berliner weissbier. All around great balance, complexity, and robustness of fruity/funky yeast, blueberry, and moderate malt flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A very enjoyable offering."

"very nice beer, easy to drink but a little on the expensive side"

"D: This was an ok berliner weisse, but no blueberry was noticeable. It was more like a subpar gueuze, with an uninteresting scent and taste and body. The finish was a bit harsh too, so must be sipped. Age may help, but this was really not worth buying in the first place."

"Pours a blueberry almost blood orange hue with a creamy three finger and some considerable clingy lacing very nice looking,the smell is like blueberry pie with a nice sourness aswell,the feel is medium bodied with smooth carbonation and has tastes of sour blueberries,tart wheat and finished like a sour ribena just full of blueberries and overall yes I love this and would buy again."

"O: The blueberries add a great little contrast. Don't turn your nose up at it or write it off as a gimmick. This is a seriously tasty and refreshing quaff. I dare these guys to six-pack this in the summer."
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall this beer was above average but pretty one note. Very puckering with nothing to balance the flavors at all. Not the best sour beer I've had."
""
""
""
"O: this is my first berliner weissbier so i don't have much reference to compare it except for sours and goses from which i've already had Westbrook's Gose and this feels much more subtle in terms of tartiness. Not sure if i would call it a summer beer, but i can imagine being a great entree beer for a night of seafood and shrimp cocktails."

"Bottle from Gator Beverage. Pours pinkish purplish red, hazy, with a on finger pink fluffy and spritzy head. Aroma of, good lord what the hell is this? Straight vinegar and maybe some nail polish remover. Really awful honestly. Flavor is some blueberry up front, sourness, very light flavor and rather watered down, finishes with some metallic blueberry skin. Lingering wheaty sourness on the palate. Meh. Extremely light bodied with very high carbonation. This has no redeeming qualities. Drainpour city."
""

"Overall - One of my favorite styles and this beer is a great reflection of what the style should be. However, was hoping for stronger berry flavors on the taste and aroma."

"O: It's not that it's offensive or anything. But this doesn't even approach some of the truly good Berliners or sours around. I'm feeling let down by this one. Not tart enough, nor enough fruit."
""
"I haven't had too many Berliners to say if this is to style or not but I enjoyed it. Didn't get much blueberry but has a nice lactic feel and sourness. I'd drink this again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a very good, fruited version of a Berliner. This one is somewhere in between a Berliner and a fruited lambic as far as flavor and tartness goes. It's worth a try, even if a little expensive for what you're getting."
"hard to believe i waited so long to try this, what a great blueberry sour. pink and cloudy in color without much head, true to limbic in looks. the nose is really lactic and tart, more acid than berries over a wheat malt base. it seems vinegary from the nose, and the flavor follows that, sour all the way into my jaw, i really love the flavor. the blueberries come out a lot more in the finish than at first, even after the swallow, and they blend well with a biscuity cookie malt finish. sour as they come, this is a puckery beer to say the least. i would like a little more blueberry through the beer, but i understand most of their flavor is sugars that are fermented out in the brew. brightly carbonated this beer really pops. maybe too acidic to drink a lot of, but splitting a bomber with a friend is a good dose. cool beer from evil twin with a great comical label."

"O: An unbalance sour with a decent amount of berry flavors. I enjoy the assertive tartness even it gets a bit out hand."
""
"Pours a cloudy, orange/pink color. 1/3 inch head of an slightly pink color. Good retention and good lacing. Smells of fruits, floral, hint of tartness, slight pale malt, slight sweet malt, and some astringency. Fits the style of a Berliner Weissbier. Mouth feel is tart, dry, sharp, and crisp. There is an average carbonation level. Tastes of citrus, slight sweet malt, sour notes, hint of hop, and a hint of pale malt. Overall, very good beer. Good appearance, aroma, body, and complexity."
"At 4.5%, it is quaffable, balanced and refreshing."
""
"Overall this is an enjoyable beer with a real nice wheat base to it. Blueberry is authentic and doesnt come across to fake or sweet."

"I feel as though it is more than appropriate that Evil Twin's Justin BlÃ¥bÃ¦r elicits the same sort of affecting, charming, fraught, aggressive and occasionally wonderfully dumbfounded impressions that I imagine could also very well be evoked by the dating of Selena Gomez."

""

"Overall, this might be my favorite BW style that has fruit added within the brewing process (rather than as a syrup afterwards). I like the fact that it is fruity, but maintains that tart, biting mouthfeel that wakes up your palate. It's probably also my favorite beer out of the few I've had from Evil Twin."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I wouldn't know Justin Timberlake from the Back Street Boys (nor do I want to) but this is one enjoyable beer"
""
""
""

"I once had Blabaer fever, and this beer cured my ails. Meaning, I no longer have any interest in tracking this one down after having it. It pours a hazy orange and is full of quickly disappearing foam. There's some blueberry-ish sentiment that settles and floats at the bottom, which trust me...doesn't make much scientific sense to me either. The nose is pretty flat in my opinion...some lemon acidity and a touch of that berliner wiesse. It's pretty tart and sour up front, with just a touch of those blueberries present on the medium part of the swallow...and they disappear quickly. I really wish there was just a bit more of that fruit component in the flavor. The beer finishes with a dry biscuit and puckery end. Mouthfeel, it's nicely carbonated and light. I guess I just expected a bit more in terms of blueberry. It's a pleasant beer and not too funky or lactic, but nothing outstanding either."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
" The flavor has a distinct fruity taste with a lot of wildyeast and lactic tanginess with more fruit tartness coming forward with subtle wheat backing up the bacteria in the flavor with mild fruit skin and low acid in the middle. The lemon and berry cohesive taste is impressive...I find myself going back for additional tastes as there is a mix of sweetness left on the palate after the initial tangy almost sour flavor subsides. This is a great beer and very quenching at the same time I was pleased to have the chance to try this bottle and would recommend it to anyone who enjoys berliner weissbier... a very drinkable, quaffable and satisfyingly great sour wheat."
"The beer pours a hazy fire orange with hints of pinkish hues topped by an inch of fluffy white foam that settles into a sparse blanketing within a minute. The nose has huge bready notes, hints of tart fruit, citrus, and...dog spittle. The taste leaves a more distinct blueberry impression than the nose, but the heavy yeast presence is truly the highlight of this beer. It has a light-medium body that's characterized as being bready, semi-dry, tart, fruity and finishes with a potent funkiness that lingers. I definitely think this beer would be a really tasty berliner w/o the fruit, but the blueberry really takes this beer into a new category of deliciousness. Good price/availability, I will likely get again."
""
""
""
""
"Pours cloudy a bit. Nose is very mild on blueberries. Flavor is kind of a sour blueberry thing. The blueberries are definitely dominant, and any berliner weisse character that might otherwise be here is blown out by the fruit. It's always nice to pick up a new berliner weisse. I wouldn't mind one with a bit more punch on it though."
""
""
"There's not a whole lot going on here but its very drinkable and quite enjoyable overall. I could definitely see this as my go to berliner."
""
""
"O: A refreshing and quaffable Berliner with a great dose of blueberry. Not the most dominating blueberry beer out there, but this is quite good."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This is a berliner weisse alright, continuing to remind me why it's one of my favorite sour styles. So very refreshing. Thrilled to finally get a chance to try this one, although I have to admit I might be more thrilled to have that amazing label included in my collection."
""
""
"Overall - I don't get much blueberry but it's a tasty berliner."
""
"I was pleasantly surprised with Justin Blabaer. Tasty but not overpowering, the berries were nicely balanced here."
"Hazy pinkish color with a ton of bubbly whitish-pink head. No real collar or lacing, but not typical for this style anyway. Taste is a nice refreshing tartness, some blueberry and a touch of lemon and some barnyard funk. High carbonation, and light body. Really great brew!"
""
""
"Light body and pleasantly carbonated. Very refreshing."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: despite the poor bottle art (which turned me away from this beer a few times) I finally caved for the try and was very pleasantly surprised. An excellent sour for beginners, has all the complex flavors Berliner Weisses promise but in subtle tones. Would buy again."
"O- This is the first time I've actually wanted a sour beer to be more sour. The fruit in it is very nice but I feel it could be accented with more lactic acid. Just seems to be lacking character. Easy to drink though and I could see myself knocking back plenty on a hot summer day. One could say it's an entry level sour."
""
""
""
"The flavor follows with tart and sourness in the front and then it moves onto a grainy malt flavor. There is a hint of blueberry and sweetness with a clean flavor aftertaste. Its a decent beer, but could use a bit more of an interesting punch. Lots of carbonation to keep the beer light and refreshing."
""
""
"Pours a hazed cherry brown hue with a thin pinkish head that dissipates quickly with a couple sips. A lot of barrel funk on the nose, cabernet, dried hay, lemon zest, and a faint hint of bready malt. A lot of fruit up front, seems like it's going to be sweeter than I hoped, then the sour funk seeps in - has moments of an Oude Bruin, but remains much more tart throughout finishing with a dry and bitter mouthfeel. Would definitely satisfy any lover of sour/wild ales!"
""
""
"O - Very tasty and a treat to drink."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A very fun beer for sour beer lovers."

"The beer pours like watery pink grapefruit juice with pink and pale yellow notes, and a lot of murkiness. The beer pours with a small head of fizzing soda bubbles that burst away into nothing. In body, this beer is like swamp water; murky, opaque, and possessing a couple of floating particles. On the nose, the beer is initially yeasty--like a bread doughâ€”but then the fresh fruit breaks through on the nose with mashed blueberries, slight apple skin, and citric lemon and lemongrass with a touch of blueberry pie that is just delicious to smell. On the tongue, the beer tastes lip-smackingly tart with a little balancing sweetness from the wheat malt and the blueberry fruit. Citric acid is huge in this beer and puts a nice pucker on the lips. This beer is puckering and tart, but the balance is enough that it is not painful, and gives the beer some wonderfully refreshing qualities. In the mouth, the beer feels light in body with a crisp mouthfeel that gives way to a little bit of oiliness on the finish. Carbonation tingles nicely over the tongue at a rate on the plus side of medium, and the mouth is left full of acid-canceling saliva. In flavor, the beer is very light with its blueberry character. The beer begins as sharp citric lemon juice, slowly moving into lemon grass with a touch of yogurt, which is rounded out by sweet blueberry pie with some nice wheat flake flavors moving into the finish. The finish is lighter but refreshing with a last burst of fruity lemon and blueberry. The aftertaste is sweet with wheat malt and a touch of yogurt. Overall, this is an American Weisse/Fruited Weisse/Miami Weisse that is closer to the original Berliner Weisse style. It has some great wheat and lacto flavors, along with some lovely nuances from the blueberries. This is a great beer to put back during the summerâ€¦ Unfortunately is was just released by me, and it is distinctly the fall nowâ€¦ Crisp, refreshing, sessionable, and delicious. A great weisse to try."
"At the low ABV and easy drinkable quality, this is a very accessible yet easy drinking blueberry sour. Blueberries contain just the right tart level and acidity to make them a perfect addition to sour beers, and I really wish more people were doing things with it rather than usually going for cherries or currants. Good stuff - definitely one of the more memorable beers I've had from Evil Twin in a while - and trust me, it's not just because of the label!!"
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured into my Reissdorf stange. Appearance is purplish-pink with a dense white head and smells of grapes, lemon zest and funk. Upfront, the taste is intensely tart, but quickly evens out into a bright, funky, floral berliner with a bunch of fresh blueberries in the finish. Nicely carbonated. Quite enjoyable!!! I would definitely not regret buying this again."
""
""
"Decent beer. Would drink again but don't know if it's worth buying."
""
""
""
""
"After the bottle is forcefully discarded, what remains in the beer is outstanding. The beer doesn't get in the fruit's way and the fruit doesn't get in the ale's way and this creates a harmonious blend and is still well-infused."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O: A pretty good Berliner. I honestly thought it tasted more like a straight-up fruit beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall a nice berliner weisse. Good balance of flavors and decent complexity. I bet the barrel aged version is really nice, im sure the barrel character adds a lot."
""
""
""
"Poured into snifter. Pours a reddish purple with a bit of haze. Not much head with a vigorous pour, no retention. The nose starts with a fresh tart wave of blueberry followed by lemon zest, wheat, and some acidic notes towards the end. The taste starts just like the nose with ripe blueberries paired with wheat and lemon. The combination of flavors are seamlessly integrated and makes for an extremely refreshing drink. There is tartness present mid palate, nothing overwhelming. A nice note of citrusy zest on the finish. Mouthfeel is light and moderately carbonated. Overall, a delicious Berliner that is very refreshing."

"O: This beer isn't as sour and tart compared to some of the other beers in this style, which makes it very easy to drink. This would probably make for a good introduction to a Berliner Weissbier for someone who is trying the style for the first time."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"The beer is hazy and grapefruit hued with a thin, off white head. The aroma offers light blueberries, pie crust, subtle funk. Light in body with zesty carbonation. Simple and straightforward. Mild but present blueberry character with a delicate blend of funk and fruit sweetness. Solid."
""
""
""
"overall this is great and stupid easy to drink."
"O: The nose is lacking a bit but aside from that, it's a nice example of a fruited berliner. Quite refreshing and easy to drink. Love the label. It's quite hilarious. That alone is worth the price of admission"
""
""
""
""
""
"Count me a belabaer--I mean a believer. Nice pinkish, cloudy color with lots of head. An amazing aroma of sweetness, sourness, strawberries, and especially blueberries. An in-your-face blueberry explosion of sweet alcohol. Fine mouthfeel that supports but does not overpower the flavors. Just a superbly done and tasty beer from start to finish. Yum."

"O: A good Berliner Weisse overall. Simple, but tart, a little sour, and refreshing. I would like a little more depth, but what's there is good."
""
"The mouthfeel is a little thinner than I expected/prefer for the style. Slightly tart and funky with a subtle blueberry/vinous dark fruit character lingering into a slightly acetic, dry finish. Blueberries are there but not as prominent as in the nose. Tastes more organic than cloyingly sweet or artificial. A nice touch of fresh berry along with lactic funk, bready yeast, citrus zest and acidity. A light and refreshing fruited Berliner that stays true to style without becoming overly sweet."
""
""
"Overall: I like this beer a lot. It's drinkable, refreshing & tasty. Awesome label, too."
""
"Poured into an 8oz. Torst glass. Slightly cloudy orange-lavender color, with a full, fluffy white head that receded to a thin layer of bubbles, leaving a few random dots of lacing on the glass; Champagne-like carbonation. Aroma of crackery wheat malts, light scent of freshly picked blueberries, lacto, pithy funk. Nice tartness in the taste that really hits the comfortable middle ground between ""not tart enough"" and ""too tart."" So, it's obvious but not puckering. Blueberry skin--not juicy or overpowering at all--lemony pith, toasted wheat, hints of yogurt and/or cheese rind. Light-medium body, great drinkability. Overall very nice."
""
""
""
"No head really on a murky pink, really grapefruit meat colored body. No lacing. Aroma is of musty strawberry, blueberry and lemon citrus. The nose is strong and tart overall. Flavor is as tart as you would expect for the style with more of what was encountered in the aroma with citrus, blueberry and strawberry on a wheat base. Perfect degree of tartness. Medium body and moderate carbonation. Flavorful beer, I am very interested in trying the original Evil Twin version for comparison."
""
"O - Lots of blueberries, a touch of barrel and tartness. A god awful label."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - I love the label, the appearance, and the nose...but the blueberries are severely lacking in the taste. Even still, it's all kind of delicious and drinkable. So pumped I was able to find this on a shelf."

"M: Lighter side of medium."
""
""
"Prickly and zesty, this one is! Nice carbonation pop giving my palate a work-over. Easy and delicate - drinkable to the max. Mild blueberry flavor, and not sweet at that. Tart, slightly acidic, and a bit drying. Light funk flavor profile that scratches where I itch. Easy beer to like here. Nice work. I want more, and my wife loved it as well!"
"The hazy, pinkish-red liquid that comes out of the bottle is intriguing, and not just because of the ridiculous name and bottle. The beer smells strongly of blueberries and lacks any type of head, really. Lingering behind in the aroma is some tartness and blueberry pie crust. In the taste there's not as much blueberry as I was expecting, which was a pleasant surprise actually. The smell had me a little worried. There's just enough sweetness and a nice tartness that's mellowed out by the berries. Nice light malt backbone true to the Berliner style and good carbonation. All in all, this was a pleasant surprise and a very solid Berliner Weisse."

"O - Overall I was expecting this to be almost a drain pour because the nose was so screwy. Still, not an epic fail"
""
""
"Overall: Despite the gimmicky name and label, this is an excellent beer. The addition of the blueberries compliment and add to the base beer perfectly. I definitely recommend trying this."
"Pours a murky light orange-red with a foamy reddish-white head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace slowly drip into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is of malt, blueberry, and other fruity aromas. Taste is much the same with only slightly sour blueberry flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of acidity on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer but the blueberry presence is fairly subdued all around."

"Poured into a Warsteiner pokal. Pours a medium caramel amber with a white head with pinkish tones that dissipates moderately quickly to a thick film, no lacing. Aroma is raspberry juice (?!?) and not much else, similar to a light lambic. Flavor follows, with very light biscuit malt, berry juice, faint wheat, finishes dry with some light Berliner weissbier tartness and more clearly identifiable blueberry. Light bodied with active carbonation. A nice light, refreshing fruit beer; it is not as tart and lactic as a traditional Berliner, which is actually fine with me, but might bother traditionalists (who would aviod this just from the label, I suspect). Fun to drink and crazy presention, but one of the things I like about Evil Twin is that they sometimes have weird names and presentations, but most of the time the beer is unusual and great to drink. This is one of those. Odd that the initial berry aroma and taste is closer to raspberries than blueberries."

"Maybe Iâ€™ll have it again at a Sunday brunch. Outside of that, Iâ€™ll stick with something heartier."
"Light purple pink in color. Little head. No lacing. Smells like a Berliner Weiss. Mild lactic quality. Mild sulfur and a hint of fruity blueberry. Taste is more if the same. Weak blueberry, wheat. A slight lactic tartness. Light sweetness balanced with a mild sweetness. Lighter bodied. Light tartness. Good carbonation."

"O - Solid Berliner but not mind blowing. Certainly worth trying and I appreciate that the blueberry flavor, while light, is not artificial tasting like many blueberry beers."
""
"Very good Berliner. Not very sour or tart, but solid Berliner characteristics and enough blueberry to notice it."
""
"O: Refreshing; inviting; great Berliner Weiss with blueberries; a great Evil Twin / Westbrook / CBX collaboration!"

"O- A nice blueberry beer, well balanced. Worth price, would like to pick anything bottle."

"D - It's a well-crafted Berliner with a nice accent of blueberry to it. A tad expensive for what it is, but eminently drinkable and enjoyable. Looking forward to trying the wine barrel-aged version."

"O/D-Great name and label but boy, the beer is no slouch either. Not just a gimmick, this is one of the best Berliners I have had. Love the blueberry flavor. Must try."

"O â€“ This is an awesome Berliner weissbier. It fits all the characteristics of a good Berliner, plus it has a nearly perfectly-done blueberry character. This is how I wish all fruit beers would be. You have a well-done base beer that is made better by the subtle addition of fresh fruit. Really tasty and extremely drinkable. I would recommend this to any beer drinker, but especially Berliner weissbier fans. Bonus points for the awesome label."
"Tart blueberry taste, some crisp lactic sourness, clean finish with a little bit of residual fruit skins. Moderate carbonation, a little bit gassy. A quick swirl brings back a finger of foam right away. Minerally wheat, crisp, fruity. Blueberry is distinctive and a clear common thread from the color, to the aroma, and the taste (even the lulzy goofball label). I was sold when I saw Westbrook on the label, and this one is legit."

"Easy drinking, tart and refreshing. The blueberries were a nice touch to balance everything out. A really nice Berliner."
"O: Really awesome berry aroma here. The carbonation is a bit overly frothy and there could be more acidity though."
"I would have liked a bit more on the blueberry end; as is, this is a pretty standard berliner with a touch of berry added. Pretty good beer."
""

"Poured a cloudy pink with minimal head and lace but lots of carbonation. A strong blueberry aroma with some tart and sour notes as well. I find the beer to have a good balance between sharp sourness and lively carbonation and both funky and tart blueberries, although I must add the blueberries give off a touch of sweetness at times. Easy to drink with a light body, I've not had too many beers of this style but this one is a keeper."
"Verdict: Very nice Berliner from Evil Twin, one of the better examples of a Berliner with fruit. The Blueberry comes across nicely, a great summer beer."

"O- my first of the style, very fruity and refreshing, just enough tartness to make it go down fast"

"Foggy, glowing reddish peach color with a very small, fleeting white head. Smell is plenty of blueberry juice tartness and freshly cracked grain. Increased fruity tartness in the mouth, but far from any sort of artificial or cloying characteristics. Blueberries, gentle acidity, and a long, fresh grainy finish. Dry, clean, mineral, and puckering in the mouth. Seems to me like the base beer would hold up as a good Berliner on its own. Pretty simple, but it stays away from being a one note wonder with a pleasant complimentary grainy wheat component. Nicely done...wish it wasn't so damn expensive."
"O: Pretty awesome. More would be very welcome."

"o - i'll be honest, i got this because it made me laugh when i first heard about it and as a label collector, this one is a MUST have. that being said, who would've guessed that the contents would be so spot on. really well done for my tastes. thanks to evil twin for killing it on the inside and on the outside on this one."
""
"O: Overall I found this beer to be pretty light and refreshing - as a big fan of the Berliner Weissbier, I would gladly have this one again. Blueberry is a good seasonal fruit for the addition to the style."
""
""
"Light bodied and lively carbonated but not quite effervescent. This is one of the most blueberry forward brews I have had in a long time. It is downright crushable as far as drinkability goes. As far as berliners go, this one at times feels a bit watery. However, it is a perfect summertime offering that (i am nitpicking here) could use a bit more tartness. Regardless, I enjoyed the grain backing and how clean this was. I want more..."
""
""
"This is an incredible beer. It's vibrant, bright and exciting. The blueberries zip around the palate and the wheat helps to balance this juiciness, stopping it from becoming overly fruity. The tartness in the back is gentle and gradual, not too sharp. It's so refreshing. I wish I could drink this all summer. I need to buy more."

"O: Im not hugely into the style, but this is almost certainly the best one Ive had. Im still waiting for one with the big sourness that I hear about. Anyways, Id def drink this one again, which is actually a pretty high compliment for me when talking about a Berliner Weisse."

"o - Overall this is certainly a good berliner, and one of the better Evil Twin beers that I've had. I think the nose is fantastic; super sour, super fresh, and some light funk adding complexity. It might sound like I didn't like the taste which is not the case; the taste is good, it's just that after the nose this beer had I was hoping for it to be a little more flavorful. Easy to drink, definitely worth checking out if you can get a bottle, and I'd certainly have it again."
"Overall, this was a really great Berliner. Very easy to drink with the right amount of tartness."

"O- I was really impressed by this. I had this just a few days after Hunahpu Day, where I tried a lot of great Berliners from Funky Buddha, and this beer is definitely on par with a lot of the best Florida Berliners. I had only had big stouts from Evil Twin before, so it was also cool to see Jeppe do such a different style and to totally nail it. This is a great beer, definitely seek this out."
