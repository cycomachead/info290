"D - Not the most complex beer, but enjoyable and easy to drink. Appreciate the sub-5% ABV too, as there are too many of these 6%+ Berliners popping up. Probably more appropriate for the summertime."

"Serving type: bottle."

"Overall this beer was solid for the style. Delivered on the sour and passionfruit front. Would order again."
"Overall - Nice berliner.  The passionfruit aroma belied a much more intense beer that never materialized."
"A mild and interesting fruited sour beer.  Rough around the edges but a starter beer for those just getting into sours, as the casual drinker can easily pick out the fruit, handle the sour and begin to search out the funk and yeast involved."

"Not bad.  Not wild in a good way. Little lactic acid and bad yeast."

"AMAZING!"

"Pour is clear pale golden yellow with lots of tight white head. Nose has some rich rounded honey grains and doughy malt. The fruits are more red tropical punch and more clean grain. Taste is a bit sweeter and no off flavor. Grains arenâ€™t nearly as strong but there, notes of honey, a fuller body than you would normally see on a Berliner. Sugary fruitiness and tropical punch, faint citrus and low acidity. Slightly sour and high carbonation."

"Disappears from your glass. Excellent balance between passionfruit and sour."

"Everything is in proportion here and works well together. Lightly sour, a little fruit sweetness and finishes clean and refreshing. Similar to a grapefruit mimosa without the overload of sweetness nor presence of high alcohol."

"light golden color, slight head. smell of slightly tart fruit with wheat overtones. taste is incredibly smooth and balanced.  fruit is pronounced and there's just the right amount of sour kick. finish is lasting with tartness and makes the beer truly stand out. great job guys!"

"The sourness of the passion fruit melds well with the sourness of the lactic acid."
