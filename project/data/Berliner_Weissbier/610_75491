3.51,-18.9,3,3.25,3.5,4.5,3.5,"Hazy pale straw topped with a minimal, wispy white head that vanishes, leaving the beer looking rather still. Smells like big-time acetic, lactic lemon. Flavor is sour...like, Warheads sour. Lactic, acidic, crisp lemon juice tartness that obscures whatever other flavors might be trying to poke through. Don't get me wrong, this was fun to try, I enjoyed it like I do overly spicy food; it's just one great big sour kick in the teeth without any grainy wheat for depth. Light, crisp, puckering. Too intensely acidic and one dimensional for the style and I can't imagine drinking more than maybe 10 oz. Expensive too, which in addition to the crushing sourness makes the whole thing seem more of a novelty than a truly sessionable Berliner.","wedge","Aug 04, 2014"

Aroma is indicative that this will be tart, vinegar, and I could almost swear a note of tartar sauce but that could be the power of suggestion. The flavor is extremely sour, lemons and vinegar. It didn't taste bad but I have never had a berliner that was this sour, most of the berliner weisse beers I have tasted are only mildly tart. If you are looking for a palate crushing sour than look no further but I felt this deviated a little too far from the style.","ArrogantB","May 15, 2014"

I'm not a huge sour fan, but I've enjoyed the German versions of this style, because the sour component generally doesn't smack you over the head. This clearly does. I guess this beer is remarkable for the level of flavor you get in a 4% beer, but I just wish there was a bit more to this beer than sour, sour, sour... The couple next to me at BS were drinking a flight of left over sour beers from puckerfest, and I was surprised they hadn't gotten a sample glass of the tartare. The guy told me that he was a huge sour fan, while his wife (GF?) said she was a fan, but not to the extent her husband was. So I happily gave them my glass. The woman indicated that the beer was too sour for her, while the gentleman indicated that he enjoyed it, but that it was on the boundary of just how much sour he could tolerate. Don't believe I'll be ordering this one again.","John_M","Jul 25, 2013"

The nose has a sharp citric acidity to it, with just a little bit of grainy wheat appreciable as well. The flavor follows through on that blueprint. The beer is highlighted by a bright lemon tartness, which is just kept in balance by the flavor of the wheat. There's a little bit of a body contribution from the wheat, and it's the only thing that keeps the beer from coming across as watery, meaning the beer is perfectly light bodied. The effervescent carbonation lends credence to the style's nickname of "the champagne of the north".

This sourness of this beer rivals, if not exceeds, the most sour of gueuzes and will satisfy those who seek that kind of experience. However, to me it's too sour for the style: like drinking apple cider vinegar cut with Perrier. Still, it had a wonderful mouthfeel like a stellar Berliner Weiss should. In small doses, this is an excellent experience. As for a full glass... maybe a little too much.","JimsArcade","Sep 30, 2012"

Fans of sours will absolutely love this brew. I surprisingly did not enjoy this as much as I thought I would. This is really a take on the style that exceeds the upper limits of how tart a berliner should be. It is worth trying but I cant see myself drinking more than a glass of this at a time. If the style was changed to american wild, id increase my rating across the board but for a berliner this one is brutal.

Some pear, apple, white wine characteristics. Some tart lemon spritz in here as well. Integrated and bold nose, wonderful to get into. Tartare is one of the more tart forward berliners out there, this is eye opening. Lemon, apple, lacto, wheat, pale malt, white wine, sour patch kids. Flavors are well integrated, body is light, lactic sourness, very lightly carbed, hardly at all.

A lot of lemon as well. Taste is WOW... way more sour than I was expecting. Definitely the most sour berliner I've ever had. Sour lemon flavors with white wine vinegar and sour white grapes. A lot of wheat and funky lacto acidic flavors. Puckering. Mouthfeel was very light, puckering, and refreshing. Drinkability was very high. Overall, my favorite beer of the night.

Simply sour and acidic with citrus bite and mildly acetic taste with earthy jolt of sour and light nutty finish of wood.
