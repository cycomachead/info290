Hey, I realize that I am not the handsomest of guys, but do you have to take off so quickly? Color was a pale lemon-yellow with NE-quality clarity. I have urinated darker water than this. Nose had a faint lager/corn adjunct sweetness, but it was all pretty mild. Mouthfeel was thin and watery with only the barest of taste in the mouth. I am glad it was nearing my bedtime as this was a major snooze-a-thon. Holy boring, Batman! Finish was equally band and ho-hum, making for a less-than-scintillating experience. That said, I do not feel that I should dun it too badly. I knew what I was buying, but I had never seen it before, either in CAN or bottle, and I have certainly had much worse, including from the style.

Poured into a pils style glass. Extremely pale body; barely yellow at all. Lots of carbonation but no head. Looks like sparkling water. Smells like rice. Tastes way too watered down to have any real flavor. Body was paper thin and merely just liquid. There is absolutely nothing behind this beer.

What I could pick up was maybe a hay, or wheat smell. Again very very faint, and hardly there at all. The taste was very light and non descript, but that is about what one would expect from a light lager. A light grain, just enough of a taste to know I was not drinking water would be the best way to describe it. Decent feel, again just the cold well carbonated. Crisp, and a clean finish, no aftertaste. Overall this was totally forgettable, as I imagined it would be. Their version of Bud Light I imagine and if thats the case, it is spot on.

The beer pours an expected crystal-clear, fizzy brew with fleeting head retention. After the aromas, the flavors offer little of anything. Very faint pils malts and rice, but those are short lived.

Nose is all malt what there is of it, crisp and clean, start is sweet, thinly malted, top is light to moderate in feel. Finish is sternly acidic, hops sparse and the aftertaste desert dry, drinkable if youre into light beers and I must say a tad better than most.","Gusler","Mar 06, 2004"

2.13,-3.6,2.5,2,2,2,2.5,"A bland, watery light beer is all that's here. Nothing too foul, but nothing that would warrant a second purchase either.","Beastdog75","Aug 29, 2003"
1.86,-15.8,1,2.5,1.5,2,2,"Pours to large soapy bubbles that dissapear. Color is water and light straw. Aroma is carbonated water, malt, adjunct grains and a weak dose of pungent hops. Taste is mostly carbonated water with a splash of malt, cereal and hops. Bitter finish that sours and turns into a metallic, stomach-acid aftertaste. Probably better suited for pairing with food to mask the aftertaste.","EagleTalon","Aug 27, 2003"
2.3,4.1,2,2,3,2,1.5,"This brew poured a medium head of fine to medium sized white bubbles that quickly disappeared. Its body was a straw yellow and was very carbonated. It had a very mild malt aroma and a skunky cheap macro swill flavor of weak hops.","TheDM","Jun 25, 2003"
1.62,-26.7,1.5,2,1.5,1.5,1.5,"When I took my first taste of this brew, I knew instantly that I was not going to like this one. It poured a small white creamy head with small bubbles. There was fair lacing with this brew. The body was straw yellow in hue. It had a mild malt aroma and it was bitter tasting from start to finish. This brew was light and watery tasting.","hotstuff","Jun 25, 2003"
2.35,6.3,2,2,2.5,2.5,2.5,"In defense of this beer I must say that it is better than many American lights, although that may not be saying much. Still, if one must drink a light beer, this may be one of the better ones. The label copy notes ""only 95 calories", so its clear that the caloric content is of more importance to the target audience than the taste.","Pegasus","Feb 16, 2003"
2.39,8.1,2,3,2,2.5,2.5,"Pours a crystal clear, very light straw gold body. It's topped by a full, foamy, bright-white head head, but unfortunately it drops almost immediately! It keeps a thin foamy collar but hardly any surface covering, and leaves no lace. The aroma is nice with a softly sweet graininess. Exceptionally clean. The body is light and gently crisp in the mouth - quite appropriate for a light beer. The flavor, however, expresses less character than the nose might lead you to believe. There's just a mild touch of grainy maltiness, and it's much less sweet than might be expected. It doesn't really finish as much as it just ends. In fact, the entire flavor is just like a short dry finish. Disappointing.","NeroFiddled","Jan 09, 2003"
1.85,-16.3,2,2,1.5,2.5,2,"What would be the politically correct term for this beer? Japanese American Light Crap? Please this beer is horrible, and now it is brewed in the US like that would make any difference other than someone cutting costs to line their pockets.","Jason","Aug 05, 2002"
