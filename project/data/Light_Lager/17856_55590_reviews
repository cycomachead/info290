"Was about to brew a lighter blonde ale in this srm 3 range, so I picked up a bunch of different varieties for inspiration. This was my favorite, surprisingly. It was one of the lighter offerings, but it had that something different that kept me going back to it. It pours light gold with a .5"" head that dissipates rather quickly but has nice lacing and a brisk, spritzy inner-carb... tastes like a decent macro lager with a nice funky yeast-kick. It's a weird almost cloying sour/sweet funk to it that makes it original and interesting. Let's face it - this style is hard to make interesting, but that yeast funkiness going on doesn't taste like a paulaner, but it does kinda remind of that original-funk quality that's nice and it does set this apart in a usually boring/bland category. It might be slightly under-rated here. Slightly. A good summer beer. Beef it up with a bit of grain of paradise bite and you'd have yourself a winner. And get rid of the twist offs - pls. don't like buying bottles I can't recycle for homebrews."

"Bright golden color with a bit of haziness from some light sediment. A quarter inch head of off white foam is on top,but quickly fades. Brussels lacing. Aroma is of light malt,rice, and perhaps some faint bittering hops. Flavor is light malt,rice, and some faint Saaz hops. This beer is daily light in body and fairly crisp."

"Not usually a fan of lagers but this one has a good flavor with a touch of hops on the back of your tounge. Smells of a wheat beer. Maintains a smooth flavor even as the bottle warmed unlike a real hoppy beer... Pairs good with a beef dish like steak..."
""
"Pours a clear, straw color. 3/4 inch head of a white color. Good retention and decent lacing. Smells of pale malt, hint of wheat, rice, and a hint of hops. Fits the style of a Light Lager. Mouth feel is smooth and crisp, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of rice, pale malt, hint of hop, and a hint of sweet malt. Overall, decent appearance, aroma, and blend for a Light Lager, but the bottle clearly states Blonde Ale, and is therefore a poor American Blonde Ale."

"Overall: Not offensive, but I've had this style before and it comes off as sweetened cereal. Honey Bunches of Oats?"
"O: For such a light beer, it still has decent flavor that is certainly better than BMC. Again, if you know someone looking to get into craft beers, but are scared of the heavy flavors, this is a good start."

"This isn't bad for what it is. It's probably brewed for the macro-lager, and it's better than most in that class. It's not a bad ""lawn-mower"" beer."

"a cloudy yellow with a slight bit of foam around the edge of the glass. smells of pilsner malt, lemongrass, very sweet. the flavor is much like the smell..very basic with a slight bit of pilsner taste to it.. has a very bready aftertaste. light-medium in body, low carbonation for the style. nothing impressive here.. good starter beer for those who only drink pbr, miller, and bud (taking into consideration unless you're at least 50 you don't bother with coors anymore, and that would be coors original not light)"
""
"O: Pleasant drink, good alternative to the BMC, but still a bit plain."
""
""
""
"O: Not totally disappointing but nothing I would grab again."

"This blonde doesn't get down and dirty but I am sure you could make up for that by doing it all night long. Hopefully the horns won't wear off, but I think I might get tired of it and want something with more character."

"O: Easy to drink and enjoyable, this is a very sessionable beer that you could drink all day long - this tastes more like a blonde ale than a light lager."

"Not as horrible as the label looks or the beer sounds. Pours a clear brilliant golden color with a bright white head, forms thin speckled lacing as it dwindles. Aroma has light biscuit malts with a light herbal hop in the back end, nothing overtly sweet or offensive here. Flavor has a creamy malts sweetness, with massive cereal notes and a bit of cooked veggie. Light herbal hops in the back end with some dry yeast cake chalkiness. Mouthfeel is light bodied with ample carbonation, a bit fizzy and a bit yellow nothing markedly better than anything mainstream or worse than anything out there that is super craft. Overall, it was bearable but nothing really exciting or well executed as a honey blonde lager."
"Affordable and inoffensive, this lager is a serviceable beer. Could be paired with just about anything, and would go just fine along with greasy bar food or lighter seafood dishes."
"O - a good tasting beer that's easy to drink."
""
"I love this beer. It is a extremley refreshing lager. There is the perfect amount of hop presence and mouthfeel."
"Drinkability is very good on this beer. It has a high ABV and a much better taste than most light lagers. If someone is looking to slug beers all day long, but not compromise taste, this is a great choice!"

"Overall: Another Horny Goat offering that I don't mind drinking but likely won't purchase again. Not bad, just so many better options."
"Overall: this has an overall fake flavor about it. This one comes across as just another macro type beer for the masses. Skip this one."
"O: Overall not a bad tasting beer, certainly not a Belgian style or yeasty, but as a stand alone entry level light sippin tweener will suffice for one or two. Bought as a part of a sampler pack. average all around."
"It's really pretty smooth, and it's got more flavor (especially hops) than I was anticipating. So for that, I give it credit. It's not an award winner, but it is gone in 2 minutes, and that certainly aids in it's overall impression."
"Pours a pale yellow color, quite a bit of foamy white head. Smells lemony sweet. I enjoyed this beer. But won't go out of my way to get one from the store. But if on sale, and If you looking for something to slam it would be good for you to go for it man."
"Pours a pale yellow color, quite a bit of foamy white head. Smells lemony sweet. Nice light bodied beer with a good clean taste. I enjoyed this beer. Very drinkable, I'll buy this beer again if I see it."
"overall, this is a decent beer but not one that i will get again"
"The look of this beer is like a lager, yellow. The aroma smells like bananas, maybe a hint of apples. It tastes like a light lager. There isnt much of a honey taste in this beer. The mouthfeel is very light. It tastes like there really isnt any flavor there. This is how light lager is suppose to be. But even with a light flavor, you need balance. When the beer is on the tounge it doesnt taste smooth."
"Eh. Poured with decent white head and some lace. Color is a clear amber. Aroma is heavy banana, crackers, biscuit malt. Flavor is similar to aroma. Body is ok and so is carbonation. Finish is like flavor too. The banana thing is too much. Not a session beer."
"This is a very simple but well made beer and is extremely drinkable and would likely be pleasant for most. I'm a fan of much bigger beers and of extreme beers. Yet, this one, as simple as it is, was quite pleasant and appealing."
"D - I'll never have it again. The Horny Blonde isn't their worst beer but it's not worth having. If, for some reason, you find yourself in a predicament where it's the only option, it wont kill you. Of course, after a few, in the morning you may wish it had."
