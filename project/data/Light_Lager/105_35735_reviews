"   Overall, I will give Miller Chill - Miller Brewing Co. a 3.25. It was better than I had anticipated."
""
""
""
""

"Overall: less of a beer really so much as a low alcohol spritzer. Certainly not my type of beer nor my favourite, but I think this would be decent for those that would normally drink a shandy or a sweet ready-to-drink."
""
""
""
"As a guy that likes all beer and will give it all a go, This stuff is ok. Kind of like Bud light lime. Not bad."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Refreshing, light beer. Nothing more, nothing less. Pretty good for the style."

"Final Grade: 3.18, a C+. Miller Chill is fine for what it is - a mass-produced, lime-flavoured light lager. This style of beer has never been my bag, but I am willing to grant that this is a surprisingly tolerable example, and I will have no trouble finishing the other 5 bottles. I like this more than Bud Light Lime, although to be fair I haven't actually had any of that stuff in at least 3 years. I doubt I'll buy this again, but I'd have no problem drinking one if offered, and anyone in the market for a tolerable light beer should give this one a look."

"This beer was a real good beer. You can taste the lime in the beer. It is smooth, and it is not too strong of a taste. The lime taste I think is a really good taste with this beer. I have only had it in a bottle but I would like to try it on tap if I could find a bar with it on tap."

"Miller Chill brewed by Miller Brewing Co. This brew has 100 calories and ABV of 4.1. This brew pours out a light amber color with a thin white head. The head to this brew goes away fast. There is a lot of carbonation to this brew but no head. The smell is lime and that is about it. It really dose not smell like beer. The taste is lime and some other flavor that I can't put my finger on. This brew is not bad but not good either. It is smooth with lime but it light and it has a funky aftertaste. For the aftertaste this brew loose out. The mouthfeel is decent at first and clean. But this brew has a funky aftertaste. Miller Chill is drinkable. Overall I'm giving this brew a 2.50 out of 5."

"Another bland macro-lager with artificial lime flavouring"

"Sampled 9/1/13. Don't believe I ever had one of these. Chilled down to 36 degrees in my beer cooler and poured into a pilsner glass. Pours a pale straw-yellow in color with about a 2-finger white foamy head that doesn't last too long. Not much lacing was seen with each sip. Lots of streaming bubbles were seen raising form the bottom of the glass. The aroma is of grains (probably corn) and lime. The taste was pretty much the same. Very light body and on the water-down side. Guess that would account for the lover alcohol content. Overall it was OK. Nothing special but different."

"I won't knock this to death because it is better than Bud Light lime and much better than Big Rock Lime. Still, it's a below average attempt at a light lime lager. If you can find Moosehead Light Lime, get that over this. You'll be thankful."

"A poorly made beer. The citrus does not marry well with the lager underneath. Grainy, salty, it's a bit tough to put down. If you are looking for a beer in this category, steer towards Bud Light Lime. It is a much better crafted beer that drinks much more easily."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Eh. I was refreshing but otherwise unremarkable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: It was a pretty boring and bland experience. Wasn't horrible but not something I would ever buy again. If someone really insisted on me drinking one I'd do it but wouldn't really enjoy it."

"O: This is one of my ""go to"" beers when I want something cheap, available at the gas station on the way, and easy to drink at the beach or park in the summer. If you recognize it for what it's meant to be, a light lager with flavoring that's packaged for convenience and brewed for refreshment, not taste, it's decent."
""
""
"If fruit in your beer is your thing, then this isn't so bad. It tastes artificial like a less sweet version of powdered Kool-aid. It didn't give me indigestion like Bud Light Lime did. I will admit that this is a pretty refreshing, extremely light beer. Good for a really hot day, but not much else."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I'm not a person that cares for fruit flavors added to my beer. That being said, as a light lager this isn't bad but there are better choices out there."

"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a 14 oz ""pint"" glass. Pours a transparent straw color with an initial white head of about 1.5 fingers, but it is gone very quickly. Smells only of artificial lime flavoring. Tastes of adjunct light beer with lime flavoring added. Carbonation a little heavy, but to be expected for a light adjunct beer. However, extremely drinkable and could throw many of these without noticing. Overall, definitely a below average beer, but more tolerable than most light lagers."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Appearance is a light golden yellow color with a crisp but easily dissipating head. Smell is faint of lime and adjuncts. Taste is also light with the lime and adjuncts with sparse hops leaving a minor bitterness in the aftertaste. Mouthfeel is light with crisp carbonation. I suspect it could be quite refreshing on a hot summer day."

"Way too much carbonation, and the body is pretty watery."

"O: I suppose if I compare this beer to something like Bud Light Lime, it is decent. On the other hand, if I compare it to anything else, then it is seriously lacking. In the end, Miller Chill is pretty awful. Something to be avoided."
""
""
""
"The added lime does bring some much needed character to the flavor and it's very easy to drink. It's refreshing for the summer, but that's it."
""
""
""
""
""
"Better than the lemon version"

"RJT"
"D - Take everything you thought you knew about macro-lagers, and add some gross, artificial fruit flavor. Yuck."
"Not the worst thing to drink on a hot summer day, but not for fans of beers with, you know, somewhat of a taste to them."
"Pours a light straw color with decent carbonation and bright white head that fades to nothing. Smell is of lime and grass. The taste just doesn't work, the lime tastes weird and the only good thing about it is that it's refreshing. Very light body and decent carbonation on the mouthfeel. This is slightly better than but light lime but still not something I will ever buy again."
"Overall Drinkability - Decent for the style. Might be a little better than Bud Light Lime. But they're both such bad beers in general it's not worth splitting hairs over."
"There really isn't anything too ""beer-y"" about this beer. No real malt profile, no hop presence. It pretty much fails as a beer, and supposedly Miller has toyed with the recipe since its rival Bud Lime seems to be fairing better in sales (from various sources I've read). I guess this is easy to drink on a hot day, but there are definitely more exciting choices out there for hot-weather brews."
"I don't know why bother, you shouldn't"
"In these days of flavorful, chewy rich high hopped and malted microwbrews, such liquids as Miller Chill seem to have no purpose anymore. Looking as light as carbonated soda water, with a non-existent smell, and almost non-existent taste, you might as well place an order for lime-flavored alka selter soda water. Pabst Blue Ribbon has more definitive flavor. Bud light more hops. Seagrams' malt beveridge at least has flavor. The slightly metallic wheatiness of this highly carbonated liquid, was so distant from the ideal, I wonder it could even be called ""beer"". Even in the world of summer and light beers, I'd say this was low in its category, and I wouldn't even give it the purposeful quality of ""thirst quenching quaffable"". Bring on the genuine ginger ale! Or simply bring me a soda pop, please!!!"
"This was not a pleasant experience. I think that Miller tried to hard and put in little effort to change the Miller style into a beer that is far below quality and what I believe they could be capable of. It looks like a light beer but taste worse. Almost like sun warmed water that was later chilled and then a warm lime added. I actually like the concept of this beer, but nothing after that. ""Plain ol Jane"" gold in color with a beige-ish 1 finger head. A boring mouth feel with a lingering after taste. Just all in all a poor quality product"
"Pours pale straw yellow under a very short-lived head. A hint of lime in the aroma and taste, alongside the merest hint of anything remotely beerish. To be enjoyed in context? Done this one, movin' on."
"I am amazed at so many words people have put into reviews to describe this. It's a terrible lite beer with a sticky, syrupy lime taste that is clearly more artificial then a coke. Not at one point when drinking it did any flavor hit me that would remind me of anything that'd register as ""beer"". Avoid forever if you have ever tasted self respect and enjoyed it."
"There is no redemption for this beer, salt and beer is something that's as bad as it sounds. Putting lime in Bud Light would be a hundred times better then this. Avoid."
"Almost no head, weak gold body. Aroma of fake lime and grass. Taste is sour lime pop with a cardboard beer finish, then a cloying rice sweetness. I would rather drink a Bud Light Lime than this, but that is really not saying too much. Would not recommend this to anybody."
"I like the idea of creating something the will refresh a person in the Summer time. However adding lime to a pale lager isn't always the answer. I guess that Miller did a lot of spying on Corona Extra and found out that the Lime might help them compete with the Corona drinker. I'm not partial to either one really so for me to say it was a good choice would be a bias. This beer tastes much like Sprite or 7-up."
"I am not really a fan of this beer it is too sweet for my liking."
"This pours a light and pale yellow, overly carbonated with a slight bright white head. The smell is of fake lime juice and Miller Lite. How creative. Oh man, possibly the worst beer I've ever had. I don't know why they'd attempt this. It drinks light with a lot of carbonation and leaves too much of the fake lime flavor behind. This beer is offensively bad. It's hard to look at let alone drink. It reminds me of when this first came out during my sophomore year in college. The Miller Lite girls were at the liquor store and having a tasting. They gave my roommate a free case. We ended up having a party that night and we couldn't give the bottles away. No one wanted to touch it, for a reason."
" If you like lime in your beer then I guess this is a beer for you, if not just give it a try to say you at least tried it."
"D: This is just awful. Normally I can stand a bad light lager, but the addition of lime flavoring to this just made it even worse."
"Drinkability - Easy to drink and fresh but why bother? The poor taste/smell/mouthfeel keeps that from amounting to anything."
"D - On a summer day I wouldn't have a big problem grabbing one of these at a tailgate or something, but it's a pretty lame beer otherwise."
"D- Fizzy water with lime. Pretty gross."
"For some New Years Eve afternoon entertainment, BeerFM's Andy & I decided to open this bottle that had been in the back of my fridge since July. May 31 on the bottle. Pours a flat light green which fizzled out quickly. Aroma & taste very synthetic a la lime pledge or pinesol. Not terrible on a hot summer day but certainly not something the D train would pull out of the station to get on my own."
"D - Overall, I prefer this one to Big Rock's attempt at a lime beer, but the synthetic lime is a little too much for my liking. If you want lime in your beer, I suggest you get yourself a real lime and go from there."
"Mouthfeel / Drinkability: The body of the beer is watery and overly carbonated. Truly terrible I was nearly sick watching others at the beer drink this crap up. Yuck!~"
"Pours a light clear straw color with a quickly dissipating head and no lacing. Smells like creamed corn with lemon juice. Tastes like sweet corn with a twist of that fake lemon juice from the packets at cheap ass restaurants. Mouthfeel is very thin and bubbly. Half decent drinkability."
"Drinkability - the fresher taste that the lemon taste adds makes this light beer more tolerable, but still not at all complex enough to make it very interesting."
"D: Blech. The flavor is just too sickly sweet and artificial to be enjoyable."
"Overall- have i said that it tastes like sugary lime juice? For me drinkable (i love lime), but no real beer flavors, I could drink a 12 pack of these no problem. But post-college, I dont really see a situation where I would want too."
"Tastes like sugar. That's really all I get in the mouthfeel, sugar and water. If that's what you're into, check it out."
"Pale straw in colour with loads of visible carbonation. Fluffy white head quickly fizzles away, leaving a thin cap of bubbles behind. Some lacing. Smells like lime flavoured carbonated water. Tastes like lime flavoured carbonated water. It's even less beery than the Bud Light Lime, if you can believe it, and the lime isn't quite as intense either. Thin and spritzy, though not as aggressively bubbly as BL Lime. Would you be surprised if I told you it drank like lime flavoured carbonated water? The lime flavoured carbonated water is so much cheaper though."
"Why am I even reviewing this? I don't know. A friend offered me this after basketball, it was cold and I thought I'd take a chance since a lime beer sounded refreshing. It was a pale yellow, some head that dissipated quickly with a tiny bit of lacing. Smells mildly of lime, and I don't get much else. Taste is almost like carbonated water with a little bit of lime. Not much lime though, which disappointed me. I would have been happier with carbonated water with some lime juice. This wasn't as bad as it was nothingness."
"D- I'll let this and bud light lime fight it out."
"Bottle: Poured a super light yellow color lager with a small pure white bubbly head with minimal retention. Aroma of light lime notes with corn and other adjunct. Taste is also dominated by lime juice with light corn malt body. Not as bad as I had expected just quite bland with limited lime taste."
"Pours a piss yellow colour, with alot of fizz but little head. Smelled mainly of lime, with a bit of raw adjunct corn. Tasted like a bad wobbly pop. I think this was meant as a vodka cooler, but they added something resembling beer by accident. Very fizzy mouthfeel, and very gassy. Will definitely make you bloat. Drinkable? Well, it's bad, but it's not terrible. It's a decent party drink to serve. Women seemed to especially love it. As for myself, I'd never order it. But, if given to me, I'd take it. It's not horrible, just dull."
"Overall: Not nearly as good as Bud Light Lime...or chopping up your own lime..."
"Not sure why I bother reviewing these horrable macros... Guess thats what happens when your bored at your in-laws!"
"For getting smashed ONLY."
"Interesting to see a BMC product on Canadian shelves these days that's actually made in its Yankee homeland, and not contract brewed on this side of the border. In this case, however, Miller Chill's plainly pandering and generally offensive nature has me tempted to decry American hegemony."
"Pours a light yellow color, nice carbonation, small white head, with some sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, with some hops, slight caramel. The taste is slightly sweet, malty, slight hop note. Light body. Not drinkable, would not buy again."
"Notes: Not a fan of the lime flavor. Too sweet and off tasting. Others may like it and think it slightly improves the Macro lager, but I think it makes it worse."
"Cheers!"
"nice graphics on the bottle. I still love the conan skit with max the drummer doing a miller chill commercial in japan. classic. the beer has a fine appearance, decent body, and good carbonation. the taste, however, is far from my liking. If i wanted a hint of lime in a beer I would order a corona at mexican restaurant. how could this possible have a large market?"
"Sometimes when I'm reviewing a macro, I wonder if I would rate it better if it had a micro label on it. In Miller Chill's case, I don't really have that reservation. WIth that said, I could see this as a decent drink on a hot day if it were ICE cold. In fact, never drink this thing anytime of year unless it is frigid."
"D: I took while walking in the sun and i got very thirsty when i finished it."
"Overall- Meh. I would only drink this again if it was free or if I was parched on a summer day."
"Poured from a clear 12 oz. bottle. Has a very pale yellow color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is mild, some notes of lime. Taste is rather weak, some flavoring of limes, not much else. Feels light in the mouth and has decent drinkability. This probably should have been classified as a light lager. Overall nothing special about this one."
"(D)- This beer made me think prohibition was a good idea."
"I can't say that there was anything good about this beer except that I didn't pay for it."
"Overall, the drinkability of this beer is the best part. There isn't much flavor, so you could drink these for a while. Just tried them cuz they had a november 20th drink-by date and were 2.50 for a 12-pack. That's about all I'd pay for them in the future, though."
"To wrap it up, this is worth splitting a six pack of with five other friends, but only because of the shared laughter that will follow. Everyone can have one, get a good laugh, maybe pour half of it out and move on."
"Terrible taste. Like mixing a lemon juice with light beer and then adding a teaspoon of salt. Smell is unremarkable, weak head, not impressed with the mouthfeel, like drinking cold water. This is a weak attemept at ""tampering"" with beer. If anything is added to beer it should be left up to the drinker, not prepackaged by the manufacturer. Just a bad idea with a bad result. ECH."
"Overall a good beer that's very drinkable, goes down nicely.I've had no problems pounding a few of these back on a hot summers day."
"This is my girlfriend's staple beer. i tried everything i could to get her to drink beers with me, and this is the only one she likes. ive had a couple and its alright. i can taste the lime, but i would drink it every day. it does drink down smoothly, though. i wouldnt say it is a bad beer, just not my personal taste. but better than i expected it to be"
"D-no, do not ever buy this beer, i cant think of a single reason to drink or like this stuff, its not appealing to the eye, the nose or the overall drinking experience."
"D: A little flavorful, goes down easily and is not too filling since there isn't much of anything to this beer other than the lime flavor, very mild kick, for those that drink the macros regularly this is a good beer to try for something light and different, but overall it's a beer that tries not to taste like beer."
"I was offered a bottle of this at a party, and thought 'I may never have a chance to try this again'. Pours a clear, bright straw color with a fluffy white head. Smells of salt and lime. The taste is simply revolting, salt overpowers the flavor, and it's not something I like in my beer. Couldn't finish this one, and I will never try another lime flavored beer, which is probably for the best."
"This beer is disgusting and I cannot understand why anyone would want to brew it or drink it. I am angry about this beer."
"D- its different, cant compare it to anything and it doesnt taste horrible. good summer drinker."
"D - Well, not really."
"MF/D: Over-fizzled, uber light body, not the worst. Avoid."
"Not the best lime n salt beer but will do for the cheap price. And by the way this low in cals and carbs!"
"A friend had left this in the fridge from this past weekend, so I was curious to give it a shot. It is what it is and it's barely fits into the category of beer. Not impressed."
"Overall I can drink this beer. I enjoy sipping well made beers and I enjoy pounding BMC beers. I can pound these all night. Like I said don't drink this beer thinking it's going to blow you away."
"D dont do it on of the few beers i poured down the drain. i drink light lagers and drink them with a smily but just not this one"
"Drank out of a clear bottle with no freshness date. The label on the bottle neck says 100 calories. Bottle describes it as Light Beer with Natural Flavors. I am not sure what the natural flavors are. It seems like this is Millers beer to attract the Corona crowd. Trying to please the masses. Not to terrible."
"I wasnt impressed with this, but it wasnt awful, just not impressive. Bud Light Lime is better for the money I think."
"D: It goes down OK but the lime flavor is not good at all in this beer."
"Drinkability - Hopefully I won't touch this one again. Dreadful."
"D: Fairly drinkable given what it is, but I wouldn't ever choose to have this again."
"D: Not horrible, but not really beer either. I suppose if I only saw a cooler full of this and natty light or keystone light, that would be the only time I'd try this again."
"This beer is clearly confused - it's neither one thing nor the other. The slight lemon and miniscule salt are the only flavours, and they're not pleasant. It's not sweet enough to be a chick beer, it's not refreshing enough to pass as a Corona substitute and it's too watery to be a proper beer. This is a weak, ridiculous travesty of a beer, it completely lacks flavour and it is about as undrinkable as you can get. Avoid!"
"This was just like any other bmc, but it had a nice lime flavor to cover up some of the deficiencies. If I have to drink a macro, it is either this or Fosters. I think this is a nice adition to the boring line-up at the bar. The best thing about this beer is the drinkability and none offfensive taste."
"I have to be honest I had high hopes for this beer, but in the end I couldn't even finish one bottle and had to dump half of it out. I think it was a good idea by SAB Miller, but in the end it was poorly executed in the formula. Back to the drawing board Miller!"
"Yuck. Again, another god-awful idea from MillerCoors."
"D: Absolutely brutal. I wish I had more hands so I could give this beer four thumbs down."
"Mouthfeel is overyly fizzy and thin. Overall this is a cheap beer and can be quite tasty on a hot day."
"Lawnmower beer at best. Even that may be pushing it but really it would just be about the same as drinking a cold Sprite on a hot day so thats the only way I can imagine justifying this one."
"Junk."
"Drinkabilty: What the hell where they thinking? I cannot believe that the people at miller actually thought this was a good idea. I have tasted the other ""lime"" *cough* Bud** cough** beer and that kicks the shit out of this one."
"drinkability: very easy. only good for long hot days."
"M/D: the feel is highly carbonated and watered down showing that there isn't much substance to the beer. I highly recommend avoiding this beer since it is hard to stomach it especially after smelling it."
"If you took Miller lite and left it in a pothole in the road for a week mixing with some leaves and such, then salted it, this is what it would taste like. Avoid. Don't even try for the fun of it."
"One awful aspect of this beverage (I REFUSE TO CALL IT BEER) is that it gives you some nasty ass shits. ONCE again, nastier than my ex girlfriend."
"Not much taste to it, watery light beer with lime and salt added to it"
"It is okay beer to drink for a football game.. This is about the only beer that I will drink if I have to drink an Adjunct Lager"
"one thing i did think of, for those who like tomato juice and beer, that this might be a good hangover remedy combined with some bloody mary mix or spicy hot V-8."
"D- Definitely drinkable for this style. A lime in the bottle definitely improves it though."
" One word: Why?"
"Aroma of cooked veggies and cardboard. Quaff of spunky corn and grits. I also think someone dropped a rotten lime in the mash tun. Wet cardboard in the ""finish"". This is some major league crappola. Someone at the brewery washed their socks in this brew. This stuff wouldn't even make a decent marinade - pretty freakin' worthless"
"Mouthfeel: It's pretty much like wet air. The thinnest mouthfeel that I've ever experienced in a beer."
"Cool 16oz aluminum bottle. On its own Miller lite has barely any flavor. The addition of salt enhances what maltiness this has, and the lime accentuates the taste further without dominating. Its a light beer with some actual flavor. Mouthfeel is flat but this is the only disappointment."
"The motto for this situation is ""don't fruit the beer"". As a coffee enthusiast, I know that when coffee company flavor their coffees, they are covering up the bad qualities of their coffee. (arabica vs. robusta) I can only imagine this concept leaking into the brewing world. Miller brews an inferior beer but markets the addition of the lime flavor as being exotic. This beer may have an impact on the Corona and lime community but I'm not touching this one again."
"I'll give it to Miller, at least they're trying something different. Although if your version of different is lapping up yesterdays suds from a from the floor of a holding cell in Guantanamo. then this beer is for you. Tastes like Miller Lite with salt and lime pop rocks."
"D: I won't be having this beer again."
"D: Overall, was way to carbonated to enjoy, like lime seltzer water and not one I found refreshing or desiring of another serving. A big pass on this by all means, one try for the curious, save your money on a six pack."
"It is fairly drinkable as it is wet and goes down quick. A better alternative to the Coronas and what not. Not the worst choice for a July picnic."
"D- Even though this doesn't come across as much of a beer, I don't really mind it for what it is. Much better suited for the party crowd and best on a summer afternoon, I'm sure I could have a few of these but then I'd move on to real beer!"
"Drinkability - I've had a few of these and they certainly go down easy. This is not what I look for when I want a beer, though. Among the least beer-like beer I've encountered. Good replacement for an alco-pop if you find Smirnoff Ice too sweet."
"I give this a big thumbs down, the Bud Light Lime is a much better choice for someone looking for a drinkable beer."
"Drinkability: Well its crisp and lemony and light, it fits the bill for this category. Its good enough to keep drinking, but I don't buy this shit voluntarily"
"Usually I'm a pretty big fan of Miller's beers.. this one not so much. I just hate the fact that they try to get into a certain 'market' in this case the Corona/beach market. This one was tough to finish. Much worse than the Bud Lime, nothing very good about it. Nice on a scorcher on the beach maybe?"
"Never again."
"D- 3.0- I bought this for 5.99 a 12 pack, its the right price for a late summer session oddball beer. it's not a regular session beer, but I would buy it for a party or for others to try and drink - its cheap and interesting to try once if this review sounds interesting, but not my style for sure...."
"Its on sale in the late summer, early fall likely because the sales hasn't been done well, but that's good, since its cheap, i can buy a fair volume."
"Couldn't finish donated the rest to the nats flying around the table. Even the miller girls couldn't inspire me to drink it."
"12 oz. bottle. Pours light yellow with little, to no head. Smells like dough, sweat, solvent, puke, and a splash of lime. The smell alone should have been a deterrent. Probably better not to pour out of bottle and sniff. Initial flavor was sweet with a salty finish and lime throughout. Light on the palate."
"Taste is very close to a Corona with a lime; light, easy to take a few but overall near tasteless except for the lemony notes."
" ~ For a light brew I have to admit this Miller product isn't bad. I don't think I'd ever order one for myself while patronizing a local watering home but I wouldn't turn one down at a backyard barbecue."
"In short, I was hoping to find a lighter beer that would go reasonably well with chips n salsa, but alas this strange brew is just not very good with anything."
"I can't and wont drink this again."
"Wow, this stuff is not very good. I figured I'd give it a try, kind of like wanting to watch a train wreck. Tastes pretty artificial. Easy to pound on a hot summer day but that's about it. Color is kind of yellow with a green tint. Artificial color to go with the artificial lime."
"More artificial tasting lime trying to spice up boring beer. It's just not working. Like the Bud Lime, it's only upside is that it's easy to drink on a hot day. But make sure the beer stays damn cold, or just pound it quickly. It becomes undrinkable when it warms."
"D- Easy to drink, not too bad actually."
"I guess this is good for a hot summer day but I would rather have lime koolaid."
"Poured a pale straw yellow with a decent white head that dissipated quickly. The aroma was a lime, citruis scent with a touch of cereal grains. The taste was like a lot of citruis and cereal. It was very sweet and overpowered any type of taste of beer. I felt like I was drinking a soda pop more than beer. Very watery with not much texture. I was disappointed, hoping to get a beer that would be satisfying on a hot day and did not get it."
"Okay well, I really don't think this is much of a beer, but I give it originality and a good marketing campaign. This really is more of a Summer treat, I doubt to much is sold during the Winter months. I just like to have this on rare occasion when the weather is really hot, but for the most part I prefer a good APA in that situation. I still recommend trying at least one."
"D: Not going to be served at any of my gatherings. Only trying this one on curiosity and did not buy it and don't recommend spending money on this stuff."
"Quite superior to it's counterpart Bud Light Lime, especially in flavor and mouthfeel."
"Like I said, you can't compare this with the great pilsners of Europe but it does work well with spicy Mexican food."
"Why not? Pours a very clear, haystack color with lots of carbonation and minimal head. Smells of light grains and citrus lime. Taste is very watery, light grains, lime, slightly salty, just strange. Not really up my alley. Id rather have a Miller Lite to be honest. Mouthfeel is very thin, and lots of carbonation like a Coca Cola or the like. Strange aftertaste."
"Crystal clear, pale golden color. First beer I think I have ever seen that actually reminds me of urine-REALLY! Sizeable head. Low aroma-faint hint of lime but nothing really there. Moderate ""snap"" of flavor. Somewhat cirtusy tasting with a hint of saltiness. Ok body for style-not overly watery but not much more. This is ok for the most part. I cant trash it as it isnt all that bad IMHO. Does an ok job for what it is trying to be. I could throw a few down on a hot summers day though certainly not my first choice."
"D - As I mentioned above, I really enjoy this beer as a party beer. I could spend a whole night drinking this stuff because of its lightness and fruitiness. Though overall, it doesn't get a very high mark from me, I love this beer because it quenches my thirst, is very very refreshing, and does its job at parties and on hot summer days."
"I should probably wear skirt if I ever try this again. Let's hope that never happens."
"The beer pours a very pale yellow color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is decent. It has a faint pilsner malt scent along with the essence of lime and salt; kind of refreshing. The taste is average at best. It has a lime flavor that almost resembles Zima or some other malternative. It's refreshing, but it holds little resemblence to beer. The mouthfeel isn't that good as well. It's a low bodied beer with loads of carbonation. This beer doesn't deserve the hype. It's watery beer with lime essence; big deal."
"Drinkability is nonexistant. I guess it works after a night of heavy drinking, but as a warm-up beer even, this beer just doesn't cut it."
"AVOID. ...unless free, then try for your own purposes..."
"Overall a poor beer."
"This is simply terrible ""beer"" and the idea that people are buying it baffles me. It really is offensive tasting. Not flavorless and boring like one might say about miller lite, but it is simply offensive to the mouth."
"Do yourself a favor - order a soda. This is absolutely disgusting."
"Mouthfeel is sort of like a flat lemon/lime soda. A little bit of carbonation can be felt, but it is mostly a thin syrupy feel. I forced myself to finish this, but I am going to do what I can to never have this again."
"the first time i had this was in Vegas. i was living overseas and have never herd of it. i was surprise at the taste i have never had before. it has a lime taste like some Mexican beers. it is a good summer beer its very light. this is not my favorite beer but not my least favorite"
"You know, I thought that adding a little lime and salt might make Miller a bit more bearable. Well, I guess I was wrong. This stuff pours the traditional clear yellow color with a fizzy white head that quickly dissipates. The nose is grainy with a hint of tartness from the lime. The flavor is similar. Very light and mostly bad artificial lime. Even the saltyness taste fake. A watery overcarbonated body lowers the drinkability even more. Not highly recommended."
"I am honestly perplexed how this beer is selling so well. I would take a Zima, even a freaking Tequiza, over this."
"Try this beer if you're at a wedding with an open bar and you've eaten too much food to simultaneously digest the regional stout. Otherwise pass."
"squeeze the juice out of a key lime and put some salt all around and !voila! - the flavor becomes strikingly similar to Tecate my fave cheap beer."
"Golden in color pours with a thick head that lasts for a few seconds. Smells like lime and beer which is what is advertised. The taste is not bad but is watery with a highly carbonated bite at the end. I had one of these first on a hot day in August and had about 3 before the feeling subsided. I tried to give it another shot and still feel the same."
"Verdict: A gimmicky product. Miller Chill isn't the greatest sin ever committed by a major brewing company, but it definitely doesn't help the cause of beer advocacy. It has more in common with Smirnoff Ice than it does with good beer."
"Happy to say I only bought the one."
"Come on Miller, if I wanted lime water I'd shake up a Seven Up and dilute it with water! This seems to be Miller knock off of Tequiza. A pathetic light golden brew with a weak white head. Smells like a watered down virgin margarita. Tastes the same. If you have a Mexican themed party go for it but then again, I would be drinking margaritas."
"Poured a very clear light yellow color with a short and thin white head that had some lacing down the glass. It smelled like some hints of light malt and minimal amount of hops underneath a very big fake citrius and salty aroma. The taste was awful. I couldn't finish it. It was salty and skunky tasting, only beer so far I couldn't finish. It had a sour and bitter and skunky mouthfeel which made it so undrinkable I couldn't finish it. Don't get this, I didn't, it was given to me."
"D: I would recommend leaving this one alone. But, on the outside chance you were a Zima fan, than this is your beer."
"Nice pour looked great in glass, actually was sharing a couple with my 63 year old mother. She loved it and has not been a big drinker her whole life intil recently she can bond with my 22 year old sister but thats another story. Poured it into a glass and it didn't look to bad. It was all down hill fom there. I was very disapointed and couldn't finish my whole bottle. VERY surprising afeter all the hypr. Taste was just not good."
"But this shit suck. I've had a lime with my high life and I like that, but this shit fucking blows, pass on this one."
"Sweet light malt almost completely covered by the lime flavor and some grapiness. Weird watery Zima-like taste on the finish. Tastes like a really light beer with some lime juice and sweetener added."
"It was sour and bitter and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. If you want a Mexican-style beer, get a Mexican beer!"
"Quite a few of my friends absolutly love this beer so i had to try it. One of my friends bought it for me while out. We were at a club so I drank it straight from the bottle. I was taken aback by the immediate taste of it. These same friends worship Corona (also not a fan) but I failed to see the similarities. Heavy lime where there was flavor. Also malt. I drank about half and couldn't stomach the rest. Too sweet for my taste."
"I do think it tastes better in the bottle, so don't pour it up unless you want to see it (and there's not much to see). I really expected more of a Tequiza-style absolute nastiness, but this is impressively palatable. Go figure."
"Not that I'm a fan of Carona and lime, but I'd rather have that any day over this."
"will not be trying again....left me with a bad taste in my mouth"
"Very weak, light yellow pour with short lived bleached white head. Smell is mostly sweet lime, and slightly margarita like. Taste is watery, salty, sweet, a little of lime. Nothing great, but barely drinkable. I probably like this better than miller light, but who cares... Better than some stuff of the serious crap I've had, but not by a whole lot. As one rater stated, it really does taste like a mix of beer and Sprite. Erin says tastes ""limey"""
"D: First thought to enter my mind after trying this was, WHY! This is a lame gimmick beer that, now that Ive tried it, I will not be having again."
"Sparkling light beer? Lame, but maybe. Chelada style? I know cheladas, and this is no chelada. I've rehydrated myself on cheladas in Playa del Carmen and they tasted nothing like this. If they did, I'd have let myself dry up and die, a dessicated gringo. I felt compelled to try it. I've done so. The rest goes down the drain."
"12 ounce bottle, single bottle bought for $1.39. Served in a Sam Adams BL glass, the beer pours a clear pale straw gold color with about a half inch white head. Head retention and lacing are below average. It smells like lime/lime soda. It doesn't smell bad at all, but then it doesn't really have any kind of ""beer"" smell either. But there aren't any offensive aromas either. Taste is similar to the aroma. It tastes like watered down lime soda, and it doesn't have much beer taste to it at all. It tastes more like a malt beverage/alcopop than it tastes like beer. It doesn't taste awful, but it doesn't taste good either. Mouthfeel is light and thin, it also has above average carbonation. Drinkability isn't very good, but I can get through a bottle of this so it isn't too awful. But then again, it's not exactly enjoyable. I don't like drinking it, but it's not bad enough to make me want to vomit. Compared to this, a Bud or a Milwaukee's Best sounds good. Luckily I only bought a single bottle of this, I couldn't imagine trying to drink a 6 pack of this stuff."
"12 oz. glass bottle- color of clear pale yellow, with a thin stark white head - nose of cilantro, line zest, hay , grass , grainy and slight bitterness  taste of lime juice ,and grain - body is light, acidic , and with high carbonation  aftertaste of lime peel , slight hint of hoppy bitterness"
"And I'm going to rinse and slip an Imperial Stout down my gullet and forget this episode ever happened."
"It should only be tried very chilled, almost frozen. This way you will not be able to taste it. It should be a sin to call this a chelada style beer. I have tasted perfume by accident once (you know, when you spray it the wrong way, directly to your face, add some fizz to it, and bamm!!! You get Miller chill."
"Final Note: my sister-in-law brought this over to my mom-in-laws on Christmas Eve and there were 4 bottles left (from a 12 pack) at the end of the night. I'm glad I only took 1 bottle!"
"Miller Chill is designed to be consumed cold and during the hot summer months  at the beach/pool side or lawnmower beer."
"The 100th beer I have reviewed is also the worst beer I have had the displeasure of drinking. Could be refreshing for those who don't mind the taste. The definition of a beer for people who don't like beer, I hope never to drink it again."
"probably the worst beer ive had in a long time bah leave bad mexican beer production to corona the taste is mostly bad light beer trying to be covered up with salt and lime not good stick with drinking smaller quantitys of well made beer. The tase isnt horrible but the aftertaste is what makes you want break the cardnal rule of always finishing your beer you really want to toss it in the trash."
"Not at all drinkable -- just a weird mix of tastes and a bad smell."
"It was cheap. It was there. I decided to buy a bottle. I wasted my money. It poured a very light straw colour with a head that persists. Its still lingering about 3 - 4 mins since I poured it in the glass. It has a fair bit of lacing down the side sof the glass too. It smells like lime cordial and tastes like salty lime cordial with a fizz and a hint of beer. I think that its pretty much like the bottom of a canoe this beer. Very very close to water with fizz. No body really and apart from the lime flavour there isn't much else in it. It might make a good beer for adding to a marinade. It already had the hint of lime in it. Definitely not for drinking."
"Beer should not taste like this"
"D- Though this is an abomination to beer it really doesn't taste bad to me. Its probably my favorite from the Miller lineup and is much better than Miller Lite. It is, however, very artificial and screams Macro Lager. I don't buy this one myself-but my friends like it and I'll drink a few of theirs."
"D - This isn't even refreshing. I wasn't expecting much but it's actually gross. I will drink most macro stuff if I don't have a choice but I WOULD NOT drink this ever again. Period."
"I guess this beer is what it is. A cheap alternative to Corona that you dont need to put a lime in."
"My wife's cousin brought some of this to Thanksgiving. I'll try anything once. I drank it straight out of the bottle. It really didn't taste anything at all like beer. It tasted like a funky lime soda with some salt in it. The salt made my stomach queasy and I couldn't finish the bottle. Not recommended!"
"I sure won't be stocking it."
"This is a decent light beer with a distinct lime taste. You don't taste the salt so much as the sweetness. Similar to Miller Lite, except with a noticeable sweeter finish. I would definitely recommend this beer for parties and gatherings with friends, for watching games on t.v. with light appetizers. At $5.99 for a six-pack, it's worth a try if you like other Miller beers. It's alot different than what I've tasted and unique in the sense that the lime flavor is very pronounced without actually adding a lime to it. It has a low alcohol percentage and only 110 calories for a 12 oz. serving, so you could drink alot of this and enjoy without feeling too full or bloated, although I certainly wouldn't want this for a session beer."
"Come on you beer snobs, this is a great beer. Sure not good in the technical term, but good in the laid back saturday night out with friends beer. I love the lime in this one, although the salt taste is evident and does get more of an aftertaste the more that you drink it. Sure it is not as classy or manly as some of the other beers in your convience store, but none can beat it's drinkablility so kudos to Miller for thinking outside the box"
"Definately easy to drink though - a good choice for a stinking hot summers day and a pool party with fine women, as I'm sure the girls will dig it. People that might usually head for pre-mixed spirit beverages will probably love this."
"Finish: Well...I'm glad its finished."
"D: Definitely a one-trick pony with the lime, it got boring before even one serving. I can see this being a session beer for non-beer drinkers. Probably designed to compete with Smirnoff Ice et al in that market."
"drinkability - Not that good. Was offered this to try it. Nothing special at all on this beer. Would rather have a Carona."
"Not sure what Chelada is and the beer is not good enough to warrant researching further. The beer is a pale yellow-gold color with a thin bone white head. Very little lacing is apparent. Aroma of lime hard candy and mild malt. Light-bodied with a flavor similar to any lemon-lime carbonated beverage. Only the barest hint of any hops or malt flavor. The finish is carbonated and citrusy. Pretty worthless overall."
"Very pale colored beer with an with an extremely faint aroma of artificial fruit.Taste is water,salt and lime.I am a big fan of macro lagers but there is absolutely nothing enjoyable about this beer.This is the first and last time for this awful stuff!!"
"Overall, it's not beer - more of a malternative. But surprisingly, it is drinkable. I have had worse beers, and this is better than most macros."
"Overall I was not impressed with this beer, it was a bit overpowering as far as a beer goes, way too much of a lime flavor to it. Reminded me of a Zima or Tequiza. The aftertaste left a little to be desired. I could drink this beer if it were the only thing around, but all in all it was not the worst I have had but definately the last thing I would grab."
"My friend means well, but has no idea what a good beer tastes like. He is a Natural Light drinker. When he wasn't looking, I went outside and dumped the rest out of my glass that I couldn't bare to finnish. I quickly grabbed one of my Sierra Nevada Pale Ales and opened it before he could offer me another one. I can't believe that this drink actually made it through the marketing process."
"Is this really a beer? I guess I'll treat it as such. Appearance is not good. Pale transparent yellow with minimal and quickly-disappearing head. I've smelled this smell before. It smells like when you have a party and wake up at 11:30 the next morning to clean up all the beer and booze bottles and you discover a Corona that's still 1/4 full with a lime that's been marinating in it overnight. That's what this beer smells like. I think that's how it tastes, too. It tastes like a light beer with some margarita mix in it. Then again, I think that is what's trying to be created here. So... Congratulations Miller Brewing. You created a ""beer"" that girls who don't like beer can drink."
"I've decided not to judge Miller Chill by the usual 'beer rules'. If I did so, the scores would fall significantly right across the board. Keeping in mind the target the brewery was aiming at, they didn't do a bad job. It goes without saying, but Chill needs to stay chilled or things fall apart in a hurry."
"I decided to try this with an open mind and also because it was free. One of the more heinous substances I have ever put in my mouth. Clear golden yellow pour with fizzy head. This tastes more like a Sierra Mist or Fresca that has gone bad rather than just a bad Miller beer product. Has an extreme artificial, chemical taste to it. The ""brewmaster"" who came up with this should be flogged."
"Presentation: Packaged in a twelve-ounce green glass bottle with a twist-off crown, served in a standard pint tap glass."
"Drinkability: Ugh. A horrendous mix between a Zima and a Corona, it doesn't sit well and is a bit of a stomach churner."
"Glad you could come up w/ a style for this , my buddy left this thing in my fridge; i will give it this it looks the part, a pale straw-urine color that an exotic beer should be, a faint white head that dissapeared w/ minimal lacing; the smell was a comb. of lime peel & rice, i steeled myself what came next;it comes off ok but goes downhill from there can almost taste some malts but it's overwhelmed by the lime & overpowering( prob. artificially) sweetness, like sucrolose maybe,either way not good for the beer; yeah, a little too much sugar on the palate; gave it a 2.5 'cuz it's drinkable up to a little over half way & i'm done..."
"Pours a pale yellow. No head or lacing involved. Smelled like lime and the sweetness that is to follow. Taste is a sweet lime flavoring and salty, like advertised. Absolutely no hops, no malt. It had the carbonation of a not quite fresh soda. Bubbly in the mouth. Not very drinkable and nothing like a beer."
" If you MUST have a macro summer beer, this would be it. i was not impressed, but this is a better version of Zema."
"D- Out by the pool on a hot day, would be great. Otherwise, I would not be able to stand it. Made my stomach feel funny too after a few of them. Not like a beer that I am accustomed to."
"Pours a medium light off gold color, very clear as a light beer is. No head retention at all, no lacing either. Has a light hint of lime aroma, very low carbonation, bubbles are present, but has a flat taste to it. Mouthfeel is thin and watery. Bland in the flavor department, slight citric flavor, with a hint of a sour tang, possibly the ""salt"" but not sure. The after taste is more that of a weak margarita than of any kind of beer. This was not a pleasant session with this beer."
"I'm pretty sure the only reason I bought this is because of the novelty of drinking something that shouldn't be drank. The lime and salt made me think I was drinking a nasty margarita or a diluted tequila shot. I really can't say that it was bad, but it certainly isn't something I would drink frequently or even keep on hand for a friend who liked it. It nearly gave me a stomach ache because of it's outlandish flavor and bi-polar identity. one is enough, thanks."
"Pours your standard macro straw color with little head. Has a funky fake lime smell. That funky fake lime carries on over to the taste with some salt. The carbonation is pretty high felling. On a beach or Jimmy Buffet concert is probably the only time that I would ever have this again."
"weak showing here even from miller. i find it funny miller did a comercial, their round table promotions, with burt reynolds, jimm johnston ect. and they agree not to fruit the beer, ie corona, yet they make a miller lime flavored to compete with crona, and well it's about equally bad so i guess in that respect it suceedes"
"this is pretty much extra light miller lite with fake lime and salt flavors. i've never heard of chelada before but if it really does exist, this is probably a disgrace to its style. it's not even real beer, it's just another corny malt beverage for people who don't like beer, but who think drinking some new and trendy 'chelada' will make them look cool. seriously how many people have this in their fridge at home? nah it's a beer to order when you go out. when you're sick of corona with lime (which is 1,000 times better). the flavor additives are the worst. other brewers have flavored beers of course like thirsty dog raspberry or sea dog blueberry but at least they are constructed with a decent beer behind the fruit flavor. sorry to slam ya, miller, cuz i grew up on high life, but keep it real. you're breaking a very big man-law here. VERY big."
"Drinkability: For me I would not want to have this again. I got one just to try, for the experience. This is a novelty ""beer", more likely to have an audience with female drinkers. Gone in a year, IMO. If you want a salty, limey drink, get a margarita."
"The first time I had this, I had a headache. I took aspirin, which helped me twofold: 1. My headache went away. 2. I had a good excuse to not finish this without being rude to the host."
"Overall: Unpleasant, even served too cold."
"OK the Miller Rep brought this into our store trying to sell it in. We tried it and..Miller Chill? More like Miller Swill. The lime taste just didn't taste right at all. I felt like I was drinking a Smirnoff or something similar. They made a bad beer worse. With Corona adding a lime does actually make it taste a bit better but this was not a good thing. The mouthfeel was thin and highly carbonated. Drinkability is none."
"Probably one of the ten worst beers Ive ever had."
"This one was pretty bad, but it wasn't nearly as awful as expected. If they could get a more natural lime flavour into the mix and maybe get some actual malt or hop flavour to compliment the abundance of lime, this one could be on the path to something at least decent/average but as it stands now it's just not that good."
"Mouthfeel is extremely light and arid with lots of carbonation. Carbonated water is not a bad comparison at all. I can see this being refreshing, but I can think of many many more tasty beers that are equally refreshing. I bought this single because I couldn't help but try it, but for me there's not many redeeming qualities to Miller Chill. No thanks, I think it's best to avoid this one."
"IMO in you have to adulterate a beer like I did to enjoy it than something is wrong. That being said, I enjoyed it much more with the additional lime and on the rocks. Truer to its origin perhaps?"
"Light bodied, but highly carbonated. It's like drinking soda. I can see this being highly drinkable, but I will never get another one for myself. It's not bad, it's just lackluster. Nothing about it draws me in."
"I recommend it if you want something that you can drink on a hot day and also drink about 12 of them without getting even a slight buzz."
"Feels the same on the palate as a regular Miller so no surprise. I could only drink one, because the lime taste is way too much and just turned me off totally."
"Obviously, even free I would not be interested in drinking this beer ever again."
"overall, this is not a very good beer, way too sweet, no bitterness"
"I'm going against the grain here. Nothing pretentious here, just an honest review. Let's review this for what it is: a light, refreshing, different tasting ""beer"". This isn't a big bold beer in any sense so I'm not goint to review it as such. It actually doesn't really taste much like beer at all. It has a nice lime flavor that reminds me of a hard 7UP. It is very refreshing and goes down very smooth. You can easily down several of these without thinking about it. While it's obviously not on the same level as most micro offerings, it accomplishes what it set out to do. I would much rather drink this than Bud Light or Miller Lite any day. On a hot afternoon, it doesn't get a lot better than this. Obviously, it's not a great beer, but I don't think it tries to be."
"As much as I wanted to hate this beer, it was not as bad as I thought it would be. In fact, it was actually quite refreshing (albeit overly sweet). I would definitely recommend this if you are looking for a light beer on a hot summer day or if you are a sorority girl seeking a quick buzz."
"I had to give into curiousity and give it a try just once so I got a six pack. It is a light beer that drinks easily (why else would you ever want to drink it) with a hint of salt and lime. I can't help but wonder why you would want those two ingredients in a beer. Not mimpressed at all and probably wont buy it again."
"Avoid Miller Chill. For your benefit and for mine, just avoid it. It will be best for all of us."
"D - This is a beer that I would never try again. My father-in-law mentioned wanting to get it because it was cheaper than Corona, but I held my tongue. He didn't mind it too much, and another buyer in the store said his wife loved ""Chiller", which I guess is the hip new name for it amongst those that enjoy it. I've had other light beers, and this is among the worst for me. I think if the lime tasted more natural and they toned down the saltiness, it wouldn't be so bad, but it definitely couldn't be compared to a Corona."
"I'm not quite sure I understand this brew and what Miller was going for. 12 oz. bottle that has a strong lime smell and almost no signs of any hops. Taste is very interesting: never had I had a beer that was more part something else and less part beer. Even the weakest beers have more than 50% beer taste, but not Miller Chill. This brew was almost 75% tangy lime juice water and 25% light beer. Not exactly disgusting, but not what I would call beer. I agree with the assertion that Chill is a ""beer for people who don't like beer."" Be warned, looks very appealing, but is not good in terms of being a beer."
"I have never before disposed of an unconsumed six pack. Beers I don't dig hang around until someone comes to visit. I can't think of anyone I dislike enough to inflict this particular beer on, so I trashed it."
"My wife ordered this, took a couple sips, and said she couldn't finish it. In the interest of science, I finished it. Pretty clear without much color. Medium head that quickly disappeared. Tangy lime aroma, but smelled artificial. The taste was worse. I think there was supposed to be some lime, but all I could tell was it tasted a little tangy. Not even very refreshing. I'm not sure why anyone would intentionally drink this beer."
"This is truly a ""beer"" soda pop malt beverage designed to deliver alcohol. Not recommended. Just get a Corona with a twist and you're better off."
"Does anyone remember ABs beer tequiza from from the late 90's? This tastes almost exactly like that. Mix 7up, a squirt of imitation lime, a miller light, some water and dash of salt and you get Miller chill. Honestly.... I dont hate it. Its not great, but its surprisingly drinkable."
"Everyone on this website is going to be mad at me for this review. However, this site tells people to review a beer for what it is. I think Miller Chill is exactly what it advertizes. It is a refreshing, crisp, and light beer. I'm not saying its great, but it is basically Miller trying to create a beer that will take sales away from St. Louis's #1 ""Mexican"" beer. Personally, I would drink one of these over a Corona any day."
"Stay away."
"Wanted to try this one before the summer ended, even tho' I had my reservations that this would be a Tequiza throwback. Pleasantly surprised however with the smell & taste. The appearance is underwhelming--straw yellow, watery, thin, foamy head that dissipates quickly. But the salty smell of lime and hops redeems it, and the taste follows with a nice kick. There is a slight sour aftertaste, but this is definitely a better-than-expected beer. Could easily drink a lot of these on a hot summer day or a cool summer night."
"12oz green bottle. VERY very light yellow translucent body (almost the color of water - really one of the lightest beers I've ever seen) with a thin white film. Smells prodominantly fruity - like natural lime flavor with a fair bit of salt too. Tastes sweet, like lime flavoring with a little salt in the background. Kind of reminds me of Sprite or Sierra Mist. Extremely light in body with a lot of carbonation. Relatively refreshing, though I have to say the Jason was spot-on about this being borderline malternative. Not horrible (though the salt flavor could be toned down a bit), but definitely not something I'll be drinking of my own volition or on my own dime anytime soon."
"Overall, it's a decent brew...worth trying..."
"I am prefacing this with the fact that this is not a wonderful, complex beer. BUT, it is a good beer for the masses. I had one at a picnic this evening and succumbed to my curiosity. The color is typical macro lager, the smell is sweet and limey. The taste...well it kind of tastes like a lime Zima. It's very light and limey and very carbonated. I thought that it tasted almost nearly unlike beer BUT I don't really think lambics taste much like beer either. So it is what it is. It ain't purty and it ain't complex and it ain't smart, but it's the kind of cute girl at the bar that's fun to hang out with."
"Not bad, not bad at all, quite quaffable."
"The feel is nothing, it's thin and watery, and I think they wanted it that way. Still, no points here. I must say, overall it's not a horrible summery drink. It's light enough and just fruity enough to be thirst-quenching during the summer. They call it ""Corona with the lime already included"" but I'd have to say this is a step above. Not great, but certainly not awful."
"Pours a light golden color with a puny little white head with no body. The smell is probably the worst thing about this. It smelt like a wet mop.(seriously, you know how an old mop or dish rag smells like? that's it!) Taste is god awful too carbonated, and the lime is really weak tasting. About as bad as a corona with lime, or at least comparable. Not much for mouth feel, besides the bubbly annoyance of carbonation. I won't mention drinkability because it's not worth it. Not impressed at all."
"It's actually pretty drinkable all things considered. It's not how I want my beer to taste at all but if you were blind-tasting it among sodas and fruity drinks, you'd probably think it was pretty good. I won't ever be buying this beer but might go for one in the future at say a barbecue if all that's offered is Corona and this."
"Drinkability - trendy as I'm seeing many fruit-enhanced beers this spring/summer. It's no less refreshing than a shandy, it may even prevent scurvy! There's a marketing angle they let get away. Much too pricy at a buck a bottle."
"Stay away!"
"Not many beer attributes. I agree with assessment ""beer for people who don't like beer""."
"Chalk this up at a border-line malternative, a beer for people that don't like beer. It actually tastes like a really bad diet soda. Even if this does stick around for more than several years and not deemed a fad anymore it will simply live on as a sub-par product for the ignorant uneducated consumer. Hell, with the amount of soda that is sold in the US this one will probably be here for a long long time but this will be the last visit here as this is a big fat thumbs down."
"The substance poured a very, very pale blonde color (as I described it to a friend, it appears like a pint glass of water that someone soaked a corn chip in for a few minutes) and displayed a surprisingly thin, soapy head of bright white. The nose (no, that term is too high-brow for this beer)  the smell was of pale rice grain and corn with an entire package of Spree candy dumped in. Okay, upon the initial tasting, this beer comes across less like a beer and more like a malt liquor product like Zima, really. After a couple more attempts, it dawns on me  this is a simply a Miller Lite with Hawaiian Punch added. I detect no lime, although there is a cheap candy-like fruit thing going on, and definitely no salt. For this, Im actually thankful. The mouthfeel is extremely thin, like carbonated water, and the finish was clean and spritzy  more of a citrus soda in this regard than anything else I can think of at the moment. Over all, maybe the Miller folks have nailed what they were trying to create - a Chelada - which is basically a way to make a Mexican beer taste better, if that is possible. I know full well Im not the demographic theyre trying to reach with this one, but man  I dont even think I could do this for an occasional lawnmower beer. Definitely not my cup of tea (Id have certainly preferred a cup of tea!) but if youre into this sort of thing, knock yourself out."
"Low and behold, the marketing got to me. The bottle looks great wet and cold. I grabbed a 12 pack at the local Kroger along with a 12 pack of Sierra Nevada Pale ale. They were 12.99 each. All I can say is screw you Miller. I compared my stand by pale ale with Miller Chill and it became evident that Miller makes a defective product. Nothing of quality is evident. No lime, hops, no malt, no anything. I want my money back. Anyone considering Miller Swill (ooops) Chill should try Sierra Nevada Pale ale instead for real beer enjoyment."
"Overall this beer is not a bad attempt by a major brewer. There are some interesting qualities but it should not be confused with a beer that is meant to inspire invigorating conversation. It is a beer to quench thirst."
"I tried a bottle of this recently and I thought I should review it. Poured into a plactic cup. The color was light and almost transparent. It lacked smell. Seriously, it had no smell. The beer tasted like lemon lime soda. It had no beer taste at all. I would consider this more a malt beverage than a beer. The mouthfeel was full of carbonation. Drinkability? I don't know how to answer that. Some people might like it. Others might not."
"I'll give a new macro a try, just out of curiosity, but normally I don't bother with a rating. I'm making an exception here, because I want to do my part to see that this monstrosity gets the low rating it deserves. Poured a pale straw typical of a light beer. Aroma was an odd, sweet soda-pop. Flavor was dominated by a sweet, Kool-Aid lemon-lime flavor, with a strange, metallic aftertaste that I suppose was intended to be the salt flavor, but was more like putting a quarter in your mouth. If there was any beer flavor in this beverage, I couldn't find it. Stock this next to the Zima."
"Never again."
"To be fair, I've never liked to add a lime to Corona, so maybe some personal taste bias is coming in here. However, it is a mass-produced macro with very little personality no matter how you look at it. It unfortunately lacks anything to distinguish itself."
"D: Seems like an alcoholic version of a limeade, interesting and easy to drink, it was quite refreshing, but weird. It was certainly better than Miller's regular products."
"Pours a pale yellow. Fluffy white head, with some retention,and a bit of lacing. Aroma is weak lime. Body is light and carbionated. Taste is a light ale flavored with lime,and citrus. Crisp, and refreshing, very drinkable on a hot day! I'd have it again."
"pours a clear pale yellow with a two finger frothy white head that fades quickly to to just cover the beer and minimal lacing. the smell of lime was weak and candy like. taste is same, weak flavor, grainy, very dry, mouthfeel light, crisp, lots of carbonation. the citrus tartness is not there i would rather add fresh lime to my own beer of choice. don't think i would buy this beer again."
"Pours a clear pale yellow with a white head that is initially impressive but completely vanishes without lacing in about a minute. Aroma of lime soda atop rice husks. Faint fizzy light beer taste dominated by artificial lime soda notes. Fortunately, there is not enough taste for it to be truly horrid. Strong selzer water feel makes for about as much drinkability as most common light lagers but the lime spike doesn't justify the premium price."
"Very light,watery with a fizzy tang. Drinkable like a glass of water or soda. Not drinkable as far as beer goes. Ordered this at the Mexician restaraunt thougt it might go with the food there, was wrong, wish i ordered a Bohemia instead. Had to order a Bohemia to get the taste of the Chill out of my mouth. Did nothing with the food didn't even help to wash it down. Just another gimmick beer even the wife said it tasted nasty. Not a beer i would drink again just wanted to see what all the hype was about. As usual a big dissapointment. Drink this beer at you own risk."
"Overall: This one is supposed to be like a Corona with a twist of lime? Laughable. A complete waste, OK as far as malt beverages like Zima or Smirnoff Ice go, but an utter failure as a beer. Avoid."
"So much talk about this beer, I had to see for myself what to make of it. I don't usually dislike American macro-beers the way many BA's do, but this one proves to be a challenge to the taste. Aromas start off with a very standard Miller-ish aroma, but quickly release moderate citrus notes and cereal-grain aroma swirled around light maltiness. looks very pale golden, with brilliant clarity, fizzy head retention, and brilliant clarify. Tastes do the same thing as aromas--start off very Miller-ish, leaving a little longer lag into a sweet Sprite / 7up taste with even sweeter adjuncts and cereal grains. The sweetness seems to be more overpowering than even the lime flavor additions or salt additions. In fact, the salt character would go largely unnoticed if not for the lable. The texture really suffers with a water, sugar-water feel, prickly carbonation and flat texture. Finishes with an emphasis on the sweet grains and fading lime flavor. I would like to say that this experiment was welcomed and an introductory to a little-known style, however I don't feel that this beer represents the style or beer community best. I don't see this one staying on the shelves long."
"Drinkability- I am drinking this beer never again."
"Miller Chill was a pale yellow color with good clarity. It had a white head that had decent retention and managed to leave a little lacing behind. The aroma was lime and some grain. The taste was mostly lime with a dry somewhat salty finish. It was light bodied and fairly high carbonation. Drinkability was below average. It is something interesting to try, but one of these was enough for me."
"Thanks to Pegasus for the karma point."
"D. Not a beer to drink. I don't even think most macro lovers will enjoy this brew."
"A drinkable beer, but not great. Paired with average American-Mexican food it's good. If you like Corona with lime but don;t like packing or cutting the limes, this one might be for you."
"Anyhow. Avoid this."
"Originally reviewed May 1, 2007. From a 12 Oz Bottle. A sniff from the neck yields a saccharin rotting corn and lime rinds. Appears to be a rather clear pour. Flavor begins with stale corn and swiftly slides into a repugnant fake lime juice. I think the salt provides illusion of body for a beer that would typical come across as water. Tastes like I put a lime in a Corona and let it sit in the hot sun for an afternoon. Skanky, sleazy and over-advertised."
"I think that Miller has achieved their goal of being compared to some of the Mexican imports, but overall I am unimpressed."
""
"Truly awful. I cant believe there is a market for this beer. A year from now will Miller Chill be on the market? Ill bet it is not. This is much worse than I ever thought it could be. I almost sprang for a six-pack a few weeks ago thank god I didnt. One bottle is way more than I can handle. Avoid."
"Clear light golden color with a fizzy head that disappears quickly. The aroma is pretty much lime with just the barest hint of light malt, but pleasant all the same. The taste is light lime, just a bit of bready malt, a touch of salt and maybe just a touch of hops in the finish. Altogether, not really much like beer, but not sweet either, the touch of salt is interesting and not overdone to give a bit of a margarita flavor. It is not a margarita, however - much lighter and a bit watered down. It is not corona and lime either regardless of the ads, but altogether it could be very refreshing on a hot summer day and it would be easy to get several of these down ice cold."
"Overall, a very interesting beer, head-and-shoulders better than Miller Lite, on which I'm assuming it's based. Make it cheaper, put it in a can, and you'd have a winner."
"I was quite hesistant when I tried this, because it is a Miller product and was warned that it wasn't great. However, I was pleasantly surprised. I drank out of the bottle because all the cups were used, so I couldn't get a good grasp on the appearance. Not a very noticable smell either, sort of lime, but not strong. The taste was very refreshing on a warm summer afternoon though. It quenched my thirst, but it didn't taste quite like beer. It sort of is a non-sweet, not-too-salty, limey but not quite, margarita flavored water. Went down smooth and I was actually impressed."
"D - It really tasted like a Corona with a couple limes in it. Too much lime though."
"Overall this was a decent novelty beer and went well with the chips at the bar but I would not bring home a six pack of this, nor buy another bottle anytime soon. give it a try if its around just for giggles."
"I must admit, I normally not a Miller drinker, but as a true BA, I feel it's important to forget the brewer and evaluate the beer for what it is. This is truly a non-beer drinkers brew. The verdict here is that this brew is noting bad, and if you want something that tastes more like a refreshing drink like Fresca, this is your brew. I prefer a brew that tastes more like ""beer", but that's just me."
"I bought these expecting the worse but I can actually say this is drinkable if you look at it for what it is. On hot summer days this really hits the spot."
"I'm very disappointed in this beer. I generally enjoy Miller products, but this is just bad. A very poor compitetor for Mexican beer. Someone should get fired for this mistake."
"I'd drink these on a hot day if they were free and cold. But I refuse to call them beer, cerveza, or whatever other word one may use for the product of malt, hops, yeast, and water."
"This stuff is getting some attention here on BA (a lot of media push), it's summertime, it's hot, so what the hell - I picked it up to see what Miller is trying to pull. To their credit, they at LEAST put this product in a green bottle so it won't skunk out like some of their other product. Other than that - this is just like the crappy beer they normally produce with some lime juice added. And even the juice isn't really good. All these big guys are trying to cash in now on the public's move away from their mediocre product and they appear to think that all they have to do is add some spice or fruit, mix the crap up, slap some kind of shiny label on it and somebody will buy it. Some might, but I won't. And, oh yeah, this stuff is seriously over-priced."
"Straight up pour gives a five finger white head that fades quickly to a thin layer leaving some lace. Crystal clear pale amber color. Light-medium carbonation and light bodied. Lime nose. Flavor is a slightly tart lime drink, the lime hides any malt or hops, clean finish. Good lawnmower beer but don't drink this expecting anything like a beer. $1.50 for a 12oz bottle from Capital Convenience Concord, NH."
"'nuff said from me."
"Overall, I commend Miller for going outside the box on this one, and it does live up to the hype - however fizzy and without the polarizing hot sauce. I would choose this over any corona or other such."
"Probably the best way to sum this beer/chelada up is the response of a friend of mine. He tasted it, swished it around in his mouth and simply said, ""It's kind of like Sprite."" 'Nuff said."
"This is what you think it is, and it's pretty bad even for that. I hope I'm strong enough to pour out what's left in the fridge."
"This, however, is vile. Take a pretty nasty beer, add some salt and old Roses lime juice, add some marketing, and you have Chill. It's thin and watery, the smell is off-putting, and the taste is worse than Tequiza. I suspect it's marketed for cheesy Texas lake/ country dance warehouse chicks and their tattooed boyfriends who can't afford Corona (another nasty beer)."
"Poured into a pint glass. Big bubbles forming a very minimally dense head. Prickly looking foam. Very light color. Much like miller light. The smell is that of miller light with a decent amount of bitter lime zest. The taste, again, much like miller light but with a tangy-sweet citrus (lime) burst. It doesn't taste horribly artificial, but it is a big part of the flavor. I found this quite quenching (to my surprise) after a long week and a humid and hot friday evening. Will I buy it again? no. Will I finish the 6'er without any quams? probably."
"I have to stock this now, because my neighbor who raids my beer fridge likes it and I'd rather him not drink all my good stuff. If you're into fads, and think you look cool with the green bottle, this is the beer for you. I can put away about six of these at a party and wonder where the buzz is. Absolutely no color, no head, the lime is there in the nose mixed with corn, but where the heck is the salt? I added a lime to see what the results would be, ala Corona...please don't make that mistake. I'll stock it, I'll drink it once in a while, but I think I'd rather have Corona if I'm going to drink lime-flavored piss. At least I feel like I won't get scurvy if I'm drinking real lime."
"Nein!!! Nein, nein, nein!!! Aroma is like a lime chuckles candy. Color is like an albino cadaver. Body is thiner than a wasteoid in africa. Do you think I like this beer? Ha. What's the point? a gimmick. That failed. Although I cant say I taste the salt as billed, that's a good thing. Might make a good embalming fluid, but I'd like to wait until after the big day. Still have a fake lime aftertaste in my mouth. Reminds me of lime scented cleaning solvent."
"D - I really wanted to like this. I'll always throw a lime in a high life (the poor man's corona) when grilling on a hot day (i'm in college, folks...don't judge) so this should have been a shoe-in...the processed / phenolic / artifical tastes just destroy this for me. Again, it may have been a skunked bottle, they are green glass, so I will edit this review when I try another - they only came in 12 packs so I have quite a few to get through / give away."
"Drinkability is there. Its ok, rather refreshing on a hot day. The abv allows for another. Note; the green bottle fits thisone."
"D - I could session this on a hot day by the pool, or after a long run. I wanted to hate this, but I actually sort of like it!"
"Didn't find too much redeeming about this one. Tastes pretty much like you poured lime concentrate into a Miller Lite. There is absolutely no subtlety to the lime flavor either it is just way too overpowering. A subtle lime flavor would have been welcomed but they punch you in the face with this one. The mouthfeel was very chewy too, especially for a Miller. Because of the aforementioned problems, it was not especially drinkable either. I got through it fine, but have absolutely no desire to ever do so again. If you want lime in your beer, get a good Mexican beer and drop it in."
"Appears a light pale golden forms a large white head that quickly dwindles down to scattered lacing that evenly coats the pint glass. Aromatics present with lime peels and corn, rice, and other cooked veggies smell relatively clean overall. Flavor barrage of lime juice sweetness and salted edges drying the sides of the palate, touch of light beer in the background with the mild malt sweetness no real offness just more of an iced margarita type of thing going on. Mouthfeel is highly carbonated light bodied extremely light almost watery feel to it but yet non offensive to me. Drinkability is great for a couple especially after mowing the grass not something I would drink in number a really cloying beer after a couple."
"This was not as bad as I thought, but nothing special, just a curiosity...would be real nice on a blistering hot day..(as it is here)..served nice and cold!"
"Sorry, I just can't drink it. I want to, I want to give it a good try but I can't finish this bottle. This isn't beer. Just plain awful."
"Poured from the bottle into a frosted mug, beer is a standard light lager in appearance, light clear golden color with a frothy white head. Smell is of lime, not much else is discernable - smells like a light lager. Taste is also of lime, very sweet and more like a malt beverage than a beer. Decently refreshing. The mouthfeel is light and has a frothy carbonation. A decently drinkable beer, I could see this being good on a hot day."
"Overall, I did not feel that Miller Chill was very drinkable. I first had a six pack in Florida during spring break, and now tried it after it came out nationally. Personally I do not enjoy lime in my beer, and I was not to fond of the salt either. Drinking it could be compared to drinking a lot of soda."
"This tastes like Coors Light mixed 40/60 with Zima. Refreshing in a soda kinda-way, easy to drink when ice-cold on a hot day, but I could only have two, and I'd have to cap it off with a pale ale. It doesn't satisfy like a ""real"" beer does, but it's a decent alternative."
"My expectations were pretty low. I loved the cool green packaging, but the Miller name and the ""lime flavoring"" piece made me pessimistic about the taste. I had anticipated ""Mike's Hard Lime"" or something similarly repulsive. And the soda-like appearance, frothy head and bubbles made me wonder. There wasn't much in the nose except a hint of the lime, but the taste was actually something more than I expected. Reminded me of a Corona with a lime and salty corn chips. The taste was like summer in the backyard. And the definite (albeit light) beer background in the taste brought a unique balance to the whole thing--malty, fruity, sweet, salty, bubbly... and watery too. Still, I was intrigued. A bit put-off by the salty taste, but that really isn't very strong. And I could see how it could actually help make it more drinkable. In short, would be a fun ""deck BBQ"" beer in the summer... at least with food."
"Its a bit gimmicky and certainly no the most flavorful summer seasonal out there, but other than that I dont really have any complaints. I might get bored with this one before I finished a six-pack, but it was more than worth a try"
"Notes: Beers like this piss me off because not only does it try to completely disguise any actual beer-like flavors, but the fruit flavor used to cover any would-be beer flavor is nasty and artificial."
"This isn't just Miller with lime and salt...there is something else in there I can't really identify that makes it almost undrinkable to me."
"Overall impression: This isn't as bad as I expected, the lime flavor doesn't seem too fake. Overall it tastes like a very light margarita.. I'd rather have a real Chelada if I was going to have anything like this, but this is drinkable."
"D: I guess this could be fine if you can past the fact that this is really soda masquerading as beer. Not much redeeming here. Recommendation to avoid."
"I will say right up front, that I think this product was mis-labeled. It has a very slight beer taste, but to me it seems more like a malt-ernative. Somehow, I still seem to like it. Who needs to jam a lime into an overrated Mexican beer, when you can now get the same refreshment from Milwaukee. Great beach brew, or maybe to compliment Taco night."
"Notes: This is something I would be happy to gobble down on a hot day on the links. Not one I'd seek out."
"D: Hmmm, it's really hard to call this one. I don't think i'll buy it again, but it is a worthy change up from what is usually refered to as new product from Miller. Worth a try."
"Overall, I could give this higher points, but I just truly cannot enjoy this beer. The only beer aspect of it is its slight grain taste and beer-like appearance, but otherwise its more like a light malt beverage. I'd rather buy a lime for 25cents and throw it in a macro, as least I would get some fresh produce flavor in my mouth."
"Well I could drink this again if I was desperate and the only other choice was a Tequiza. Not quite as drinkable as beer with real lime juice in it."
"Tastes of hints of lime and corn, some salt in the finish. A refreshing beer, good for a hot summer picnic. meant to be a premium light, that's what they told me anyway."
"Ok - this is a margarita gone bad. Some vague malt (and adjuncts) might be there...but, is this really beer?"
"Overall, i suppose they created what they wanted to. It is a light beer with refreshing qualities and lime flavors that can be quite refreshing out in the hot sun, or to wane kids off of soda, and get them on this easy drinking beer. But with that said, i think i would rather this than a regular miller lite cuz it is a bit different. But to say it is a good beer, i think is broadening the phrase good beer."
"Slighlty more interesting than regular miller lite, but still will not make my fridge rotation."
"Please note that I wrote ""For what it is""!!!"
"Say what you will about Tequiza, I don't think it's horrible. It's certainly not good, but it's not horible, either--I could easily see myself drinking it at a picnic or something like that. With Tequiza, AB just added some lime flavoring to a light beer. Here, Miller seems more concerned with actually emulating the flavor of a very bad margarita. And they succeed."
"Advertised as ""light beer with natural flavor", Miller Chill is kind of like Miller Lite with lime and salt added. I can only assume that it's intended to compete with margaritas, Tequiza, Mike's Hard Lemonade/Margarita, and the other malternatives that fill the same niche. However, it pretty much tastes exactly like light beer with salt and lime, and that's not particularly pleasant. It's not bad, it's just that there's not enough malt base to balance the salt and mild tang of the lime. I found it interesting, but watery, and wished I had a regular beer instead. It might be worth trying just to see if you like, or hell, even just to try it - I'm guessing the marketing boys are betting on that! But I'd also imagine it might seem really good straight out of the ice with some Jimmy Buffet playing during a long fishing trip under the hot sun."
"As I said, review a beer for what it is meant to be, and as an ""American take on a mexican classic", this definitely is that!"
"12oz green bottle poured into a pint glass. Pours a pale straw colored yellow with a big white fizzy head that leaves a decent amount of lacing around the edge of the glass. The aroma is just a touch of grain with a big whiff of artificially flavored lime (almost like a lime soda). The taste features malt that is soon completely entrenched with a strong artificially produced lime flavor. In short, this beer tastes just like a Miller Lite with some Sprite mixed in. Maybe if the lime flavors appeared to be more natural, I would enjoy it a little better. It is just hard to enjoy a beer that tastes like it is mixed with soda."
"im a big fan of the old corona with lime, even if im known to be a guinness man. anyways, my friend had a 12 pack of this and said extended an invitation to me for a few since he knew i was into the corona lime deal. anyways i had a few, and it didnt taste too limey or salty to me, but rather fruity. it tasted just like a fruit roll up to me. very easy to drink, i pounded them quick because it was hot and i was thirsty. nothing i would seek out though, corona with lime is much, much better if thats your thing. i wont recommend this to anyone."
"How hard is it to put lime and salt into a beer? It's easy and it tastes a whole lot better than this. I had this while three sheets to the wind a couple weeks ago and it just tasted like Smirnoff Ice or something. I decided to have one sober and it sure is awful."
"So Im out cutting the lawn last Sunday and its a fairly hot and humid day for late April. My father-in-law brings over a 6er of this stuff thinkin Ill like it I guess. He realizes Im a beer geek/fanatic but unfortunately doesnt realize the difference between ""good"" beer and ""gimmick"" beer. So I swilled a couple cold ones down to quench my thirst and it definitely served its purpose; but I guess ice water or iced tea would have had the same results. Anyway it was light, crisp, limey, quite thin and watery and all and all not much different than a Corona with a lime stuffed in the bottle. Nothing overtly offensive here, just another gimmicky mass produced swill they can make more dumb-ass commercials about."
"DM"
"Miller Chill pours a pale yellow with a white head from a green twelve ounce bottle that declares that it is light lager flavored with lime and salt. It smells like an overly sweet sprite. Tastes kind of like sprite or maybe fresca if it were mixed with watery beer. Barely recognizable as beer, more malt beverage like. For those who like zima but not beer. It's still arguably better than Tequiza though."
"This beer has a great concept of not having to add lime or salt into a Mexican style beer. Chill has a strong lime taste, which tastes stale. The beer goes down smoothly and goes down as easy as most light beers. I recommend drinking it at around 45 degrees to bring out the best of its characteristics."
"Not a bad beer FOR WHAT IT IS TRYING TO BE. Yeah this sucks compared to an awesome RIS or a nice belgian. This is a beer designed to appeal to the masses without a bitter or nasty flavor. It tastes like salt and lime, almost like sprite. There is an ever so tiny beer flavor to it. I downed a couple of these at a bar as it was the best they had available. Not a beer for beer snobs, but it didn't bother me at all."
"""I did this for advocacy."""
