I am not sure why they call this an light amber when it is yellow in color. The scent is more malty. The taste is evenly balanced....nothing spectacular. The mouthfeel is lighter in body with good carbonation. Overall this is ok.","WoodBrew","Feb 26, 2014"

Not overly interesting but I was not really expecting that for the style, I could have more than one of these and it light be good for a summer outdoor event.","dbrauneis","Beers"

2.47,-6.8,2,2.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,"Pours a very pale amber color with a quickly diminishing head. The scent already eludes that the taste is going to be that of a cheap beer. There is at least some flavor of so wheat and malts but it is very comparable to that of Miller Lite or Bud Light. Drinks rather fast with no real texture or volume to the beer. This is one you can skip.","Lemke10","Dec 15, 2010"

2.68,1.1,3,2.5,2.5,3,3,"D - It's an easy to drink beer because it isn't offensive unless you're easily offended by a superbly plain beer. Watery flavor and a passive aroma just add to this. Easy sessioner but you could find better to fill your gut with.","BeerFMAndy","Aug 22, 2009"
2.83,6.8,3.5,3,2.5,3,3,"Pours a golden red, with more red than gold hue showing through. Smell is biscuit malt with a bread aroma. The taste is at first dull and then your tongue is met with a biscuit malt flavor. There are no detectable hops or other spices. The mouthfeel is thin and watery with an upper medium level of carbonation. As it is only 4.13% ABV and a lighter beer it could be very sessionable, however I would look elsewhere due to the lack of taste.","pmccallum86","Aug 18, 2009"
2.85,7.5,3,3,3,2.5,2.5,"D: A little tasty, goes down ok, not too filling, mild kick, kind of different representation of style, it's listed as an "Amber Light Beer" on the label and while it's not like a typical fizzy yellow light beer, it's still not very good.","TheManiacalOne","Aug 15, 2009"

3.07,15.8,2.5,3,3,3,3.5,"Tastes pretty oxidized, but still drinkable. It most definitely tastes better than the Dixie lager. This is a pretty mild mannered beer that might be halfway decent if it was'nt like biting into some cardboard. Carbonation is high and there is a little bit of detectable hop bitterness. Fairly forgettable beer, but at 96 calories, I would give this a leg up on Michalob Ultra and the like.","twiggamortis420","Beers"
2.58,-2.6,3,2.5,2.5,3,2.5,"This beer poured a golden amber color with a one finger pillowy white head that receded rapidly, decent lacing. Nose is very grainy with notes of corn and pale malts and a bit of sweetness. Taste is bready and grainy. The sweetness in the nose filters to the taste as well but not well balanced. It sort of sneaks up on you. Mouthfeel is pretty carbonated, light and on the watery side. The beer goes down easily, but not balanced well. It was fun to try, but not one that I will pick up again.","Jayli","0"
3.21,21.1,1.5,3,3.5,4,3," ~ This is a light amber brew. I don't think I've ever actually had one before. I do like the beer but there's something holding it back. I will recommend it to others just because of the style.","cdkrenz","Sep 04, 2008"
3.01,13.6,4,3,3,2.5,3,"Well what can I say, it has more flavor than BMC, but it is lacking in other areas as well. For a light beer at 92 calories I suppose it's pretty tasty.","roadhouse","Aug 07, 2008"

2.66,0.4,3.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,3,"The new labels are definitely an improvement on the old labels (seen above). It's too bad that Dixie beer is still being brewed in Minnesota. It will be nice when the brewery is able to resume full operations down in the Crescent City where they belong.

3.3,24.5,3,3,3.5,3,3.5,"The feel is a bit watery, but that's kind of appropriate for style. Pleasant enough. An okay barley lager. Not amber at all though.","williamherbert","May 10, 2008"
2.69,1.5,3.5,2,2.5,2,4,"12oz twist-off bottle poured into a pint glass. Pours a light orangish amber color with an off-white head. The aroma is sweet bready malt and a hint of caramel. There is not much flavor going on in the taste, but it certainly is a thirst quencher that could be consumed in large quantities. The mouthfeel is very thin and highly carbonated, very reminiscent of your typical macro lager. Overall, Dixie Jazz is what it is, a pretty flavorless lager that does not offend the masses, but will not satisfy most beer geeks.","cjgator3","Mar 20, 2008"

2.33,-12.1,3.5,3,2,2,2,"Rather like carbonated water, there is hardly any "beer" going on here. "Only 92 calories..." Whatever...They might as well add - and hardly any flavor. They need to "jazz" it up a bit...","jwc215","Nov 04, 2007"

Taste is bland and unexciting, but really, expectations shouldn't be all that high; malt, grain, slight spice, a touch of hops. Mouthfeel was like water. Drinkability is nearly non-existant. Very boring.","Frozensoul327","May 21, 2005"

2.21,-16.6,3.5,2.5,2,2,2,"The beer pours a nice amber color with a 1/2" offwhite head that fades to lacing. The aroma is average. It has a weak malty scent that boasts of pale malts, adjuncts, and light crystal malts. It has a sweet aroma with a musty character; not very appealing. The taste is awful. It is like drinking a glass of water with half a Killians dumped into it. It has little beer flavor. It goes down like water and finishes dry and metallic. The mouthfeel is terrible. It is an extremely low bodied beer with good carbonation. This beer was made for easy drinking. The problem is, it's too weak to be enjoyable. It doesn't even taste like beer.

It also blew the regular Dixie Beer to Hell, man that stuff was horrid. On to the negatives: It was not as good as the Crimson or Blackened Voodoo. While more flavorful and fuller bodied than most light beers, it was still a light beer and you can only squeeze so much out of that. Faint malt flavor and aroma was about all it had going for it.","Dogbrick","0"
