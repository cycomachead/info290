Not horrible, not great, pretty much right down the middle with perhaps a bit stronger nose (mild skunk) than expected.  Thin on the palate, straw color, and limited aftertaste.  Amstel is also my preferred golf course beer; it’s available from the drinks cart at most courses, isn’t terrible, and you can drink 6 of them without losing your putting stroke.","Baltimore_Adam","Dec 22, 2014"

Carbonation level is very heavy with a very watery mouthfeel, yet this same trait makes this beer as easy to drink as a diet soda. Unimpressive but inoffensive, and a less offensive flavor then most american light lagers. This is a beer whose whole is better than the sum of its parts.","Aaron_Ramson","Aug 09, 2013"

2.32,-4.1,2,2.5,2.25,2.5,2.25,"not the worst wash on the market, but another generic macro euro lager type, this one falling on the sweeter side, with an extract malt vibe and a general lack of anything fresh or interesting. more carbonation would make this passable, and its not bad from the bottle, but a little air exposure in the glass and the beer goes flat. a little bitterness in the aftertaste, but hard to credit hops for that. its a little filling as well, which is odd for a beer this low in abv, it doesn't even work to catch a quick buzz. its not horribly off in flavor, which I guess is redeeming in some sense, but this is a pretty beat brew, and one to avoid if you are looking for quality lager.","StonedTrippin","Jul 06, 2013"

Ends up looking like a decent lager though to be honest. It’s got that metallic brown / corn presence that you’ll find in new castle, stella and the like. I have no idea what this comes from but it’s there across the board. Not off-putting really. Perfectly drinkable. I would never seek this out though.

There is plenty to enjoy about its drinkability. The feel it leaves is so light and fizzy, that the ability to drink more than one is pretty much guaranteed.

To date, Amstel Light (all 95 calories per 12 oz serving worth), is the best most beerlike light beer I have had. I include cheater Sam Adams Light (they stretch the definition of ""light"" with like 125 calories vs I think 150 for a regular bottle of Boston Lager) in that statement. Appearance is kind of odd because on the one hand it has a nice deep brown color, but on the other it is obviously a little watery looking, the result being that dark brown color is nearly transparent. It does manage to maintain a surprisingly stable head for a light beer. Smell is pleasant, you know hoppy, a bit of malt, a bit of yeast, basically what a normal beer is supposed to smell like. Taste is quite good. Some sweet malt, balanced presence of hops that are of decent quality, if not too exciting. A little yeast is in there too, and obviously this is a very clean tasting beer. Mouthfeel IS a bit on the watery side, but not to the point where you actually think you are drinking water whenever you take a sip without looking right at the glass. Drinkability is excellent since not only does this beer taste pretty good, but it obviously does not weight you down, plus you're packing on fewer calories and not getting as drunk either. Is this going to fool you into thinking you just drank an oatmeal stout, an extra bitter, or a dopplebock? Of course not. It is still a bit on the watery side in fact. But it does a better job of hiding the fact that its a light beer than any other I've tried yet. And that slighty watery liquid at least has some real beer flavor present, if not as much richness as even I would like. Take it from me, you are not likely to find a better light beer in a regular bar.

The grist is probably all barley malt.  Although light beer is my arch nemesis, the Dutch managed to eek in flavor in Amstel light.","marc77","Jun 05, 2002"
1.69,-30.2,3,1.5,1,2.5,2.5,"Eurotrash. This beer looked fine and inviting, pale copper color, thin white head, that vanished. Then the awful skunky smell, metallic, bitter, harsh taste. Just bitter taste watery, and acidic, then nothing on the finish.  I may have had a bad can, but this beer is lousy and sadly overrated. I can't agree with the ""beer drinkers light beer slogan"". It will be hard for me to try anything else from Amstel, despite the favorable reviews. I can't believe people ask for this.","StevieW","May 30, 2002"
3.09,27.7,3,4,3,2.5,2.5,"Not bad for what it is, and better than most for style.  Aroma is quite pleasant.  It has flavor with a nice European quality, just not enough.  All light beers are too heavily carbonated for my taste and this is not an exception.  It's a light beer, and understanding that I'd rather drink this than most any other, certainly any U.S. made one that I have tasted.","garymuchow","May 28, 2002"
2.28,-5.8,3,2.5,2,2,2.5,"They advertise this as the beer drinkers light beer. I don't know what they are talking about.  This beer starts promising, with a nice amber glow, and moderate head. It quickly falls short. The flavor is bland, and somewhat spritzy.  I just doens' t have much flavor!","psugrad98","May 27, 2002"
2.3,-5,2,2,2,3,3,"I am not much into light beers.  I found this beer to be better than Heineken, which I am not a fan of due in large part to the skunky smell.  That smell isn't as prevelant in this beer which makes it easier to drink.  Would still tend to look for a different light beer than this one, however.","Wildman","May 23, 2002"
1.77,-26.9,3,1,2,1.5,2,"I was disappointed with this beer.  I guess I bought in to the TV adds, so Amstel, you got my $9.99 for this 12/pk, but don’t look for any more.  Skunky smell hits you before the beer ever reaches the mouth.  Then the skunk smell carries over to the taste, and I swear if I didn’t pour it myself, I would have thought I was drinking an aged Schlitz.","BobLuvBeer","May 14, 2002"
1.48,-38.8,2,1.5,1.5,2,1,"First thing you notice when you lean in for a sniff is that it's kind of skunky. If you can keep your nose close enough long enough, you start to notice a little maltiness and hops peek out of that skunk's ass. Then the skunk high-tails it into the flavor. After a few sips you get used to ol' Mr. Skunk and don't notice him as much and you realize that the commercials are right: it doesn't really taste as bland as most light beers. It's got some definite malt presence with some citrusy notes but it also has that unpleasantness (separate from the skunk) that Heinekin also has, but I can't place it exactly. Basically, I wish it was a light beer so it wouldn't be so damn hard to drink fast because it becomes near undrinkable when it starts to approach anything resembling warm.","aracauna","May 09, 2002"
2.97,22.7,2.5,3,3,3,3,"This is usually the best choice of wedding beer swill.  I like it in relation to the AB's and Coors products.  it is overpriced and has a slight skunk overtone.  But for a light beer it does have flavor.  And that is what is usually lacking in this style any flavor at all.   This past weekend a friend brought a twelve for the sailboat cruise and I found it quite drinkable.  I would not be a regular customer, but will buy it as the ""non-beer snob"" alternative for my parties at the shore....  My wife along with my friends without taste will drink it.....","frank4sail","May 08, 2002"
1.81,-25.2,2,1,1.5,3.5,2.5,"Notes: Not much of a beer to hoot about, just an other ""run of the mill"" light lager. At around $20-24 a case ... you are better off buying a domestic light lager for around half the price. Great marketing and riding with the imported lager trend have made this less than decent brew a big seller in the US.","Jason","Apr 30, 2002"
2.5,3.3,2.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,"One of the better tasting light beers, but still nothing too spectacular. If you are going to be drinking cheap light beer, you might as well go buy a case of Nattie or Beast for a few bucks less. Also, it seems every other case has a few skunky brews in it.","IrishRedRock","Apr 14, 2002"
2.18,-9.9,2.5,2,2,2.5,2.5,"I’ve never understood the popularity of this beer.  If you want a light beer, why bother with an import that is always partially skunked, and not very good in any event.  I am mystified when I see a male drinking this beer.  The only message you are sending is that you are vain, worried about your “shape,” and not real bright: my feeling is if you’ve got a tool, you damn well better build a shed over it.  If you are worried about the calories, get a Guinness, and get a life. Brown bottle, bad euro/skunk taste and aroma.","jackndan","Apr 12, 2002"
2.7,11.6,3,3,2.5,3,2.5,"Golden in color, very light taste, not as watered down as Coor's for sure! If I was weighing close to 300lbs, I would choose this over the other light's that I have tried.","WilliamPhilaPa","Mar 24, 2002"
2.88,19,3,2.5,3,3,3,"A very average beer, but good as far as light beers go.  Some light malt taste is there, albeit very light and there are some discernable hops on the finish.  Very drinkable, but for the same amount of money, you can buy so much better.","proc","Mar 18, 2002"
2.4,-0.8,3,3,2,2,2.5,"This was a gift from a friend since I never had it, I see why now - way too light and watery.  After a taste, a shot of dark rum dressed it right up and made a very drinkable drink.","jdhilt","Jan 12, 2002"
