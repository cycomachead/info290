"a little to watered down for my liking"
"Category is American light. When judging by bjcp style guidelines color and smell are rated high. I would never drink this beer by choice but when judged by style and not taste alone it scores a respectable score. These bring the total score up. Again do not mistake a high score for a good beer. Two categories scored high by style does not a good beer make."
""
"Pours a light golden color with a very thin lace of head. Smells like the standard adjunct lager with fermented corn. Pretty smooth going down, mainly because the lack of carbonation. Not much flavor here, but more than Bud Select 55. There's a little corny aftertaste but doesn't last long. For a super light lager it's not too bad."
""
"When did beer try to market itself as a health drink? This is so empty and flavorless it's not even worth existing; drink beer or drink water."

"By the way, out of the can it's pretty nasty but if you pour it into a glass (or a mason jar) some esters are released and you get a nice almost wit-smelling aroma and a better overall flavor profile. I assume most folks are drinking this straight from the bottle/can. Try pouring it for better results."

"Just way to watered down to consider an enjoyable beer, something to drink to get drunk and stay thin"

"If you like water with a hint of coloring, this ""beer"" is for you. If you'd like to get drunk off of this ""beer"" be prepared to drink a case and hit the head often."

"It's so watery and unflavorful that I wouldn't recommend it to anybody. If you want a decent light beer, try a Sam Adams Light and leave this stuff in the discount cart for people who don't care how a beer tastes."

"Pours an almost clear yellow with no head. The smell was very metallic even though it was from a bottle. The taste was a lot of rice and some metal. Not very appetizing."

"I guess this is what happens when you strip a beer down to 64 calories and carbonate the hell out of it. Most of the flavor to me honestly is seltzer carbonation and the rest is as if you diluted another light beer half and half with water and added corn. This beer lacks flavor like nothing I have experienced so far, but then again I also got a single of Bud-55. The thing that makes no sense to me is I don't think many people would drink this without getting buzzed in mind. At 2.8% you would consume many of these to get a buzz and the calorie drop is cancelled out, do people forget how to do math after seeing the excessive marketing for such beers."

"This, surprisingly, isn't horrible... BUT pretty damn close. And, unlike a few other beers I've had recently this is drinkable if only just. Not refreshing by any stretch of the imagination as I found myself yearning for the bottom of the glass to approach. I'll sum this up with this: Sometimes you have to have a bad beer to enjoy a the good ones. That's exactly what this experiment was for me, I will spend the rest of my days ensuring I never drink this one again. It's really the only reason you should have for consuming this as well."

"Opinions vary, but this is the best light beer I have tasted (my wife has bought them all, Bud55, Miller Lite [my old favorite light], Mic Ultra [ok, I do love Mic Ultra Amber - but hard to find in MN], etc.) and Miller 64 has become a staple in our refrigerator). It is light, fresh, crisp, and tastes like, well, it tastes like beer. It has a low alcohol content, so is refreshing on a hot day, or out on a bike ride, tastes great with pizza."
"I'm comparing to Coors Light, Bud 55, etc.."

"Obviously this beer is intended to be something to down on a hot summer day or for someone who is perhaps trying to cut down their drinking without switching to NA beer. Miller 64 is what it is - It possesses good carbonation, a fine straw color when poured and holds it own against the other macro brands."

"Beer flavored water. Not bad, just not worth writing home about. If there is no flavor then it can't be bad. I keep this around for my light beer visitors and decided to crack a few. Haven't had aal light in a long time, now I remember why. Also it provides no buzz after five cans. 2.8 abv ""lager"" ??? At least it's union made which is the only sociallly redeaming thing this about this fizzy yellow water sort of kind of beer like beverage."

"It's technically well made, there is just nothing to work with. It's like the beer version of the fat-free muffin. You're just taking away the whole point by insisting on a product with next to no calories."

"I wish you could give this less than 1. I understand that we are to keep in mind the style when rating but this tastes like the brewery workers drank some Miller Light, filtered it through their own kidneys, stored it in their bladders for a while, then...well you get the picture. Seriously, this is bad beer."
""

"Overall – Well, it looked OK. Unless you just want to look at it, this beer is one to definitely avoid, as its taste was pretty atrocious."
""
""
"Well, swimsuit season's coming up, so we've gotta watch those calories, eh, guys? Anyway, this stuff pours a clear pale straw topped by a finger of white froth. The nose comprises sweet corn, light funky wheat, and a touch of hard water. The taste brings in more of the same, with more hardness to the water and a slightly sharper funkiness from the now-grassier wheat. The body is rather light, with a light moderate carbonation and a watery feel. Overall, a pretty limp, sad beer, one that certainly isn't much of a poster child for the ""fewer calories but all the flavor"" camp. Give me the calories..."
""
""
""
""
"Okay, this is a light beer, and I suppose that I should review it in that light. However, it is also nearly tasteless. It is watery, pale yellow in color...moderately carbonated, and nearly completely devoid of any smell or flavor. Some spritzy carbonic bite, but nothing that tastes like beer. Not worth drinking if you want to taste your beverage."
""
""
"This is the worst beer I have ever had. Miller took their concocted piss water and added even more water to it. Stale flavor and smell, mouthfeel of lukewarm water, and a miserable sickly pale color. The only reason I could imagine drinking this is because of the low calories, but if that is the issue, eat a salad once in a while. Weighing in at 2.8 ABV, you'd have to bong a case of these things just to get a slight buzz, which would offset the low calories. As will everything under the Miller label, this is just downright awful. I actually heard there was a scene in the movie Zero Dark Thirty when they interrogated a guy by making him drink one of these. After one sip, he begged to be water boarded. This beer is pure torture."

"O- Not good. It scored some refreshment points, But It's lack of taste or flavor can't be overlooked."
""
""
""
""

"Yeah, needless to say, I won't be having this one again. It's just so flavorless and empty. If you're going to drink a beer, then drink a beer. With this stuff, what's the point?"

"Effervescent carbonation, moderately light in body; extremely watery overall. I won’t say this is the worst light beer I’ve had, because it wasn’t. It wasn’t unpleasant, it just wasn’t there at all, really, and I had a hard time seeing the point of drinking something like this. The ABV is so low it won’t have an intoxicating effect, if that’s what’s desired, and by the time it does you’d have drunk enough of these that you could have had a better beer. Certainly not my thing; I’d rather not drink anything and save the calories altogether."

"Compared to other beers in this category, I think it's decent. There's no point in comparing this to a craft IPA, for instance, that's not the goal of the beer. When compared to other major ""diet"" beers, I have to say this ranks high because it achieves a goal of not offending me. Other diet beer, or non-diet beers even such as Budweiser Platinum and Rolling Rock offend me and they're not even trying to go lo-cal. There is no reason to drink those beers. This on the other hand serves a purpose and doesn't give me a sour face, so I'm rating this with that in mind."

"Pale, fizzy straw yellow in look. Scent is pale, watery with only a faint whiff of stale light beer. Taste is again very light, somewhat undiscernable from a regular light beer once youve had 1 or 2, stale tasting, light corn. Thin and watery. Compared to Bud 55, this atleast tastes like light beer, and still, thats not a great thing."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I actually have a hard time thinking of this beverage as ""beer""! Typical ""Light"" beer look and scent. Very little taste to speak of...beer-flavored water??? One possible use would be as a spacer for a night a tasting higher ABV selections!"
""
"Seltzer water/CO2 bitter tang up front. Light corny maltiness follows. Hint of honey sweetness. Not much there. Slight cardboard bite as mineral water bitterness takes over the finish. Light bodied, with a fizzy, seltzery feel. Not much taste in this! Not offensive, but not worth drinking."
"I will say this. It's not as bad as I thought it would be. It didn't have those awful apple-like or metallic notes that often accompany macro lagers. It is a bit sweet and it is way over carbonated, but otherwise it's just a very thinned out version of MGD. I picked this up on a day that I had to drive and was attending a cook out. It was good to swig in the hot sun and I was able to drive home."
""
""
""
""
"This is what is suppose to be a very lightly flavored low calorie beer. Nothing I'd seek out, but could put one away if thirsty enough - just wouldn't spend my own money on it."
""
""
"GROSS! This is the worst beer I've ever had in my life. Even Corona Light is miles ahead of Miller 64 in taste. My favorite thing Miller has even done is Pabst Blue Ribbon, but this sir is a poor ripoff of what a beer should be! For cheap beers, I'll stick to Pabst Blue Ribbon, Miller Light, Coors, Coors Light, and Narraganset. Miller 64 will never touch my lips again! NEVER!!!"

"Overall: Compared to the other light lagers that i have had this was the least appealing. I had several before reviewing so as to give it a fair chance but this is not a satisfying drink."
""
""
""
"Poured from a 12 oz. can. Has a very pale yellow color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of corn, somewhat musty. WTF? I would describe the taste as soon as I find one. The is by far the weakest beer I have ever tried, I am struggling to find any flavor profile other than water. Feels like water in the mouth and overall most NA beers I have had taste more like beer than this one."

"O: Despite its light, almost non-beer stature in individual scoring, I still like this as a refreshing drink. It's one of those classically easy-to-drink lagers that go good with a lawn barbecue or a good college football tailgate -- in settings where beer isn't necessarily the culinary focus, but having a couple refreshing easy-to-drink beers with friends is key. It's an American tradition... it would do many of us good to remember why we started drinking beer in the first place ;)"

"I'm not even sure how this has as high ratings as it does, it might have to do with the fact they dye the beer to make it darker than it actually is. I would definitely choose this over miller lite buts thats like deciding between animal blood and urine. There is no head, no smell, its extremely light but if your a fatty and you think this will help keep the pounds off then feel free to drink this yellow dye"

"Miller 64 is a lawnmower beer for sure. Obviously for those who are conscious about their carb intake but still have a hankerin for beer. I say....quality over quantity. Anyway...the beer pours yellow clear with good carbonation that forms a head...which dissipates over time. The smell and taste are typical...grain slight hop. Mouthfeel is nothing to describe really...more like water than beer. Overall its water with beer flavoring."
"I enjoy good, flavorful beer. I also can not see my toes. Considering that the good stuff is usually upwards of 200 calories, I can stand to drink a light beer or two. My wife hardly drinks at all anymore but when we go to parties we'll buy a 12 pack and she'll only drink two so we always have this in the fridge. This beer is not offensive, just not much there. Pale yellow with average mouthfeel. No smell to speak of. Tastes like nothing really. I guess 6 of these would be pretty refreshing and then by that point I guess you don't really care what it tastes like. Oh well. Just finished a 5 mile run and was feeling healthy so I tried one. I'll probably drink some more, but not because I want to. My gut says I need to. Like having sex in a canoe, indeed."
"(D)- Very light and crisp with a refreshing finish. Easy to drink, but with this lack of really any flavor, I will gladly pass"
"To sum up, drink if dehydrated. Otherwise, be afraid. Be very afraid."
"This is my cheap, low calorie go to beer. Overall, nothing too impressive. Good for a break between better and more alcoholic beers. This is a good replacement for water. Next to no taste and is fairly carbonated. The only good part of the beer is that it is cheap and cold. Still, better than Bud Light."
"Overall, I would never drink it again, ever."
"Pours very pale gold with maybe a half inch of white head. Head exits rapidly. Smell is maybe a touch of corny grains. Really hard to smell anything at all. Taste is beer water. Take a standard Miller Genuine Draft and dump half the glass. Fill to the top with sparkling water and this is what you would get. O.K. maybe just pout out 40%. Yes you could drink this every waking hour and still function pretty well but why would you? Much better to cut back to one good beer per day if calories or abv. is an issue."
"A very light straw color with lots of bubbles. No smell here at all, hmm. No taste either, just fizzy water, and maybe some grain. Mouthfeel is extremely light with lots of bubbles, very smooth. The beer is very drinkable and there is nothing that taste bad about it. If you plan on getting hammered and want to save the calories then this beer will do the trick."
"O/D-I guess I understand the concept behind this beer concerning the calories and what not. Nevertheless, this beer sucks. You would have to drink about seventy if your trying to get drunk, and by that point, the calories will probably add up. Boo."
"I certainly don't hate it like I do a lot of other light lagers. It is slightly respectable in its attempt to market itself as a 64 calorie beer. But it is so low alcohol it seems its only use is to swig when you are hot."
"These types of further dumbed-down beers remind me of one thing - when you pour too much water into a cask-strength whiskey. At least then, you could fix it by just topping up with more whiskey. No such luck here, I'm afraid."
"Overall - To be fair I must consider what this is - a 64 calorie lite beer. In comparison with other beers of this specific style I really can't knock it. In fact it's fairly refreshing after being in the heat, and I like being able to throw back a few of these quickly and not be buzzed or bloated - it's exactly what I want from a 64 calorie lite beer."
"Miller Genuine Draft Light 64 has a thick, but quickly dissipating, white head and a clear, straw appearance, with some lacing left behind. The aroma is a lighter version of regular MGD: corn & barley, plus sweetness. Taste is also similar to Miller High Life or the Genuine Draft: corn, sweetness, and that odd cooked vegetable flavor, but MGD 64 is like the regular ones with water added to half the glass. The mouthfeel is light and extremely watery, and MGD Light 64 finishes dull, veggie, and dry. Overall, this is poor, and I would recommend that you avoid it. RJT"
"Give it a try if you want a low alcohol, low calorie, light beer that is refreshing and easy to drink."
"O:Not a great beer in any way. Has good color but fails to impress in the other three categories. Not a beer that you would ever want to brag about or spend lots of money on"
"This is a little better than Bud Select 55. Either way though this brew is weak. Far too light for anyone to enjoy on a quality level. This beer doesn't serve much of a purpose other than for economic reasons. Topping off at 2.8% ABV they should almost consider making this beer an NA brew."
"D: This is as close to water as a ""beer"" gets. It is altogether unoffensive but only because it is so weak."
"D: Great drinkability."
"D- So boring, like fizzy water with a touch of corn. yawn."
"Pours a clean/clear pale yellow color, some carbonation, little fizzy white head, with some sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, very slight hop note, with some rice/corn thrown in. Light Body. Not Drinkable, not much of a beer. Would not buy again."
"Drinkability: I can stomach this beer because it has some flavor; it is still a boring beer, though. In the realm of light beer's though, this brew is better than most."
"Hey, you can't expect too much from something like this but it gets the job done - Low cal/drinkable/doesn't stink."
"D: Practically like drinking slightly sweet soda water. So you could imagine it's drinkable."
"D: Actually very drinkable. Not in the delicious beer sense, but in the aforementioned mineral water/thirst quenching sense. I drink these now and then when I don't want to get drunk while slamming beers during a football game."
"Its drinkable in the same way water is but if i want a beer im definitely not reaching for this."
"Miller Genuine Draft was admittedly popular with me when I was younger. This just showed my inexperience in different types of beer. After experimenting with other beers I realized this a piss poor beer. The appearance is nearly clear looking. The smell is twangingly awful. The taste is borderline wretched. The taste it leaves in your mouth is harsh. It immediately makes you want to wash out your mouth with soap. It was hard for me to drink just one. Almost painful to drink this beer. I'm not ashamed to say that I didn't finish the six pack I got and gladly did not care about losing the money I spent on this beer. Highly dislike and definitly deserves to be put in one of the circles of hell from Dante's Inferno."
"D: I don't get the point of this beer. Sure, the 64 calories thing is cool, but you could just carbonate some tap water and have the same flavor with zero calories."
"Poured out of a clear bottle into a chilled glass, this beer produced a half finger head that disappeared before I could get a good look at it. No thin ring, no lacing. The color is light amber rating a 3 on the SRM chart. Bad smell, like that of a can of mushrooms that has just been opened...bad. I didn't know if I wanted to taste is, but I did. Bland, mushroom taste, with a little corn and rice. I guess I should expect much taste for 64 calories. Feels like water in my mouth, but a little dry. I will avoid this beer, as there are better light beers out there. Maybe this beer is just old, I don't know as there is no date on the bottle."
"Pours a nasty looking off straw color with high carbonation, virtually no head or lacing. Smells like air... well, it does not really release any smell. Tastes like piss. A quite terrible taste. Mouthfeel was just plain bad. High drinkability."
"They should have named this beer Miller Ghost because it's just not there faint smell, faint taste, very pale yellow color, and a soapy head that just vanishes. It was like drinking water that you have to have an ID to buy. It doesn't even have the redeeming quality of taking the edge of because of the low Abv percentage. MGD 64 might be a good brew to have if you wanted a couple of beers and were driving, but I like to keep it on the safe side and refrain all together. If you want to drink a beer then not be able to tell you drank one then go ahead and pick this one up otherwise just avoid"
"d 4 i really don't mind this stuff and think it has its place, like when you're outdoors or want another beer to cap things off but want to overdo."
"I'd probably take it in an either/or for life over my favorite (Old Stock Ale) for reasons outlined above."
"Why people drink these are beyond me, after a triple, this went down in three seconds."
"Pours a two finger white head that fades quickly to a thin layer leaving traces of lace. Crystal clear pale straw color, like looking through colored water. Light-medium carbonation and very light bodied. Faint corn nose. Flavor is lacking, mostly hints of corn, no hops, no malt. Who drinks this stuff?? $1.25 for a 12oz bottle from Beverage Warehouse Winooski, VT."
"If you're desperate to get a cheap, mild buzz but don't want to ingest too many calories, go sniff some glue."
"If you're trying to watch your weight, this might be a worthwhile item to keep in inventory. But be forewarned: if you have any other beer in the house, this one will probably collect dust while you deplete your stash of alternatives."
"MGD 64 has a slight corn malt smell to it. The pour results in a vigorous head that dissipates to a thin film. It is a pale yellow. The mouthfeel is very light bodied and a big, lively carbonation. It has a corny sweetness to it, but no big ""beer forward"" attributes. It does, however, have more flavor to it than Michelob Ultra. That really isn't saying too much though. Not recommended."
"D- There is nothing all the great about that beer other than it is very easy to drink several. nothing to be proud of, but it is somewhat better than some other light lagers."
"Drinkability - I don't think I've had a more friendly beer in my life. The beer isn't strong and goes down easy. Low calories, IBU, and cost. That being said while it is friendly, its not great."
"This is not a personal favorite but it works well if you're on a budget. Also, being a low calorie beer, it can be nice if you're trying to lose weight by cutting cals or carbs. Ultimately, this really isn't a good choice. There are plenty of other alternatives if you're just looking for a beer with a low calorie count."
"D- Decent drinkability, pretty good for a light beer. Could see myself pounding these down, and for the price, it's not a bad idea."
"Taste follows with light grain initially, becoming a vacuous void after just a second or so as the dryness of the beverage becomes apparent. Grainy in feel helps make this beer somewhat drinkable and much better from a glass than my one prior experience directly from a can. Touch of lemon on the finish. Better than the masses say, yet what's the point??"
"Overall: I really don't see the point to this low-calorie beer craze. People! It's only beer! Treat yourself to something nice! You deserve it! Don't feel guilty!"
"Drinkability: For the style this is above average and I have graded to that standard. It is nice, light, and sweet. A good beer to drink with activities especially on a hot day. It certainly will not get you drunk. Surprisingly good for what it is."
"Overall not much to report here. Barely beer, but refreshing."
"Got to try it for free at my grandparents, so hey, free beer. There are better light beer alternatives out there, but if you're really trying to squeeze your calorie budget it is the (2nd) lightest beer in that aspect."
"This one's badge/patch may now be in jeopardy."
"D: This is a excellent low-carb beer that I will drink again"
"Note: Again I know that this is a macro and light on top of it but because it is striving to be a really light beer it is actually not bad for that particular market. I expected it to be a lot worse."
"Drinkability all depends. If you can't afford the calories but still want to drink a 2.8% beer....have at it I guess."
"~Cheers?"
"Frankly a horrifying brew. I guess it can be considered beer only by the strictest of definitions. Very little taste and not enough alcohol to matter. I guess I understand the diet beer concept, but I see absolutely no point to drinking this at all. If you are trying to save calories, drink water maybe?"
"D= very drinkable but so is water. If you have the need to be on this near-excuse for a beer then you'll develop a tolerance for many sessions."
"Pours a pale yelllow with a thin white head. Smells like nothing. Better than smelling bad I suppose. Tastes of carbonated mineral water, very little malt or sweetness to be found. The finish has just a touch of bitterness, likely because there is no malt to counteract any hops at all. Mouthfeel is that of water, basically, high carbonation. Drinkability is better, the beer is so light and unoffensive I can see how this would be a hit with people who do not like beer. If you are looking for diet carbonated water, this beer is clearly the better choice than the rival Michelob ultra, IMO it tastes better (that isnt saying much) and is less expensive, as well as less calories."
"D- Drinkable but nothing special."
"Drinkability - I wouldn't say that this is a good beer by any means but it doesn't suck so I guess that's something."
"Drinkability: Simply dreadful. Why, it's nothing more than a lightly spritzy corn tonic."
"This is pretty much intolerable, possibly used to say you're drinking beer, but not actually interested in taste or trying not to get buzzed at a party. This was given to me at a miller sponsered event that I won, while the Redwings game was fun, i'm actually sad I was exposed to the beers offered."
"So much for a slimmer waist line."
"Okay, a somewhat positive review of a ""beer""?"
"Was a clear yellow color very light in nature with a very small head. The smell was of really nothing mabye corn. The taste has the faintest little bite at the end, can't really tell what, maybe hops. The mouthfeel is light and slightly carbonated, you barely feel like you are drinking anything. Overall there is nothing awful about the beer, but it really isn't beer it nothing, i get the point but why bother."
"Overall.... this is for the women looking to preserve their figures and not get fat from drinking tasty beer. I will never drink this again unless Bart gets me another one by pure accident."
"Drinkability is not impressive to me. If your looking for flavor its not here, but if your looking for something that can be downed in large quantities then I think this would be for you. Just nothing impressive."
"Pale yellow colored beer with a rapidly fading foamy head.I don't really get much on aroma.The taste is faint graininess.I know this isn't the most tastiest flavorful beer,but it fits well in the light lager category.I would buy again and recommend for summer outings."
"D-Overall a good drinkable light beer, perfect for tailgates and bbqs on a hot day, i wont buy a whole lot of it but its a nice standby for outtings/parties. a decent light beer."
"Overall- If you are watching your waste or a girl this is the beer for you. But in my opinion I will stick to my heavier beers but I won't bash anyone that chooses to drink this because we all have are own opinions on what is good"
"Mouthfeel is thin and watery. That's all that can be said about this."
"Also, if you must drink this... get it in the can and put the cans in your freezer before opening them. Then at least it is icy when it goes down, because there is no taste to hide. Drinking it out of the glass is less enjoyable than chugging from the can."
"D: Hard to argue that this beer would be bad after mowing your lawn on a hot day. As long as that lawn was the size of a football field and you had absolutely nothing else to drink."
"Proof that alcohol counts when brewing beer. It actually tastes worse than many non-alcoholic brews."
"Too light and too carbonated for my taste - no thanks."
"T/M - Mouthfeel is thin and watery and the taste is rather corny and bland. Nothing much here but it is only 64 calories."
"Drinkability- I have to be fair and say that the drinkability has to be higher then the other categories because to be honest what would you rate water and thats basically what this, this beer has been actually really taking off because basically people just want to be able to drink and not feel bad about calories and gaining weight but really just not worth, personally if im gonna resort to drinking this id rather have a diet soda to be honest, not gross but blah"
"MGD 64 should of came up with a more honest name for their product, hmmmm let me think ""Miller Genuine Draft Water Flavored Beer 64"" ! Yea that sounds more like it!"
"I goes down like water, but if I had too many I'd pee the bed."
"Seriously though, If you only want 64 calories of beer, drink 2 oz of World Wide Stout."
"I would recommend drinking less of a better quality beer to achieve the same means."
"D - Drinikability is average or a shade lower. The beer is easy enough to drink but the lack of aroma, flavor, and complexity on any level just takes away from the enjoyment too much. I guess you could say I'm surprised at the amount of flavor MB was able to wring out of the 64 brew but it still just comes up short in my book. Worth a try just for the experience."
"Overall it's not something I'm going to drink on a regular basis but, it's in heavy rotation where I come from. So I swallow one every now and then."
"Trying to lose weight and still have a few beers on a hot day. As good as any other Macro swill I guess, better than Budweiser. Good for lawn cutting day, and slamming it down at the beach where you don't want a heavy brew and high ABV. Can't really seriously rate this any deeper than this, but it does serve a purpose with 64 calories and low carbs."
"I came into this travesty with an open mind, but even bad beer tastes like beer in some way. MGD 64 doesn't even try to taste like beer."
"Drinkability- It's drinkable in that you can throw back 15 without getting that drunk, but that actually hurts the drinkability, since you cant get drunk enough quick enough to not care about horrid taste."
"Drinkablity - No thank you. Not again. Be careful what you drink at Memorial Day get togethers."
"D: Light beyond light, thin beyond thin. You might as well drink water since you'll get the same flavour profile. Miller's answer to the pallid nature of Michelob Ultra I guess."
"Overall- Quite watery and wimpy. Not that offensive in taste, but not worthwhile."
"One of the easiest beers to drink...ever. It goes down like nothing, because it kinda is nothing. Its whole marketing campaign paints as a healthy, low-calorie beer. Unfortunately this leads to not much taste, although what is there is average, not awful. Pretty unremarkable beer, but not a bad choice if you are health conscious or wanting a great many because it does go down really easy. I guess if you are health conscious you wouldn't drink all that much. Haha"
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- At least the texture is nice... a tad sharp and prickly for the first millisecond but then it's quick and tight, staying frothy and active while in the mouth. As with Yeungling Light, which I tried for the first time last week, this could be phenomenally satisfying in the dead of Summer's heat, quenching one's thirst while playing beach volleyball or something. Just don't expect *anything* in the way of taste, they left that part out."
"Thin, weak corn water."
"D - This is a very drinkable beer. it was designed to be a refreshing, non-intimidating beer. There are those who will be offended by this flavor. I don't mind it. I guess I am one of the few people that can appreciate a super cheap, light, mass produced macro, as well as something like Ruination, or Old Rasputin."
"Well, this is light but I'm trying to figure out where the beer part went. Better to review it just to remind you of what good beer tastes like."
"64 calories for every MGD 64 you drink. Or 0 calories for all the MGD 64's you don't drink. If you're drinking a beer solely because it only has 64 calories, just don't drink beer then. If you want a real beer, try something else. Beer bellies are sexy anyways."
"Ah, a new classic... mega-bubbly, thinly yellow body that reminds me of liquid corn... head dissolves to soapsuds almost immediately... malty, almost with the sweetness of malt liquor--lacking in substance... thin, fuzzy palate... approximates water in its consistency--drinkable, yes.... watery cornflake and thinning malt leaves the tastebudswanting of flavor... MGD brags of its 64 calories--and rightfully so--but that would be the ONLY benefit to fisting this thin, whistle-wetting too-easy-drinking lawn mower companion... this review could be subttitled ""Ballad of a Thin Beer," in honor of Bob...."
"Conclusion: Here's the thing...this is not a beer I would typically ever drink...but that being said, the 64 calories that are in this when you want something other than soda to wash down a meal and (like me) you're trying to lose weight, have to be taken into account. I'll keep my Belgian Strong Darks and my English Bitters, but once in the while this mite work...it's got half the calories of normal beer (and yes, half the alc) but there's really nothing repugnant here...there's just nothing much there period"
"Comes out of the tap a typical clear straw-yellow, but it does at least have a fine-bubbled head. Aroma is weak, though crisp and malty - not at all promising. Flavor is very thin, like beer that has been cut with water. Texture is so watery, one might as well be drinking water - there is just a teeny bit of tingle, not near enough to feel like beer. Fuhgeddaboutit."
"When you try these low calorie beers, what else can you possibly expect? It is what it is, and you can't expect anything more. It's as watery as anyone would expect but the good news is that you can look like a superhero after you slam down about 15 of these in 2 hours."
"Ok it sucks!!! but I feel better giving this beer its props for being exactly what I thought it would be....light and bubbly, just the way I like my strippers!"
"10% less drinkability."
"I was able to finish it. But, I was thirsty, and could finish seltzer water, I guess. There is something ""beer-ish"". Better than some other light beers. Not as good as Sam Adams light, as it lacks character and is just vaguely ""beer"". Pretty ""inoffensive", but boring. Actually - I found it less offensive and easier to drink than the regular MGD."
"Okay this one maybe a diet beer if I ever felt the need to loose weight. Overall it was not as watered down as I thought it was. Although it was still very watered down. I guess it could be a good beer for getting really drunk, if you are a fat person."
"Drinkability is average for the style -- no off flavors, and not much flavor at all."
"Overall though, a good choice for a light beer. Would rather have this than Bud Light or Coors Light, for instance."
"As a matter of curiosity, I tried this while at the in-laws. Beer pours a very pale straw golden color with a wispy head. Not unpleasant to look at. The aroma is very light with a distinct cooked corn characteristic. Essentially void of flavor. What is present is generic malt and corn. A ghost of bitterness but practically none. Light on the palate. If you are into beer with flavor, I would not recommend this."
" ~ For a cheap sessionable brew this is not the one. Go for a High Life Light instead."
"Drinkability is pretty decent. I will say if you are watching your calorie intake, this may be the way to go. Actually one of Miller's better offerings."
"Drinkability: For me, low calorie, low alcohol, low flavor beers aren't drinkable. Why even bother? It did help wash down some home-made chex mix pretty quickly. Not worth buying."
"No good for me, sorry MGD 64."
"Its like a light beer in a can, but it tastes like its straight from the tap! True, but only if the tap is connected to the urinal in the men's room. Pours very light yellow with the same big head. Faint aroma, more metal and corn than the corn syrup nightmare of the regular MGD. Corn-syrup flavor, but with lots of mineral water. Yum."
"this is a new low in the ultra mega light beer world. putrid."
"POurs a clean pale yellow color, with a small white head. In the aroma, very faint, small, sweet malt and a touch of skunky saaz-like hops. In the taste, a small maltiness, but really no flavor at all. A clean and light (or LITE) bodied mouthfeel, with a small dry to a clean aftertaste. Seriously, what was the point. Brewed for the masses and for the people who really don't like beer."
"Miller Genuine Draft Light 64 is as inoffensive to drink as it is offensive to the craft beer drinker's sensibilities. So, BMC, how low can you go? It seems to me that they've now sunk more than low enough with the release of this glorified seltzer water."
"Drank (as opposed to tasted) on 11/10/08."
"Cheers"
"D: Very drinkable and refreshing. This, along with appearance would be its strengths."
"Sad thing was, with my mexican food I actually drank this beer fairly fast... it wasn't offensive. Just lacked almost everything."
"They ruined a great light beer and made it this. Shame on miller."
"Poured into a pint glass, barely yellow with a foamy white, surprisingly decent sized head. At first. Smelled nothing like beer to me, though; more like dirty dishwater. So imagine my surprise when I discovered it tasted more like *clean* dishwater. Thin, watery (with apologies to water), and not worth finishing."
"Is this really what American macro beer has come to? Beer that doesn't even taste like beer? What the hell's the point?"
"I had to try this beer because of all the hype surrounding it. As far as super-diet beers go, I prefer Beck's lightest offering over this. I really wouldn't even be satisfied with this as a lawnmower beer, but for what it's supposed to be I would suppose it hits the mark. Just not for me. I'm not one to promote binge drinking, but since I had to buy a 12 pack to try it, I may see how many it takes to catch a buzz if I drink quick, as the ABV is not listed. It's got to be around 3-3.5%, though."
"I have generally preferred the Miller products over Anheuser-Busch and Coors products, so this review will be relative to comparable products released by similar companies. This beer pours with an abundance of carbonation above a thinly-straw color; lighter than Lite, but not as pale as Michelob Ultra. The lack of protiens and meaninful dextrins leaves the beer a touch fizzy and lacking in head retention past the initial medium formation. Aromas are as part-grain, part-malt as any other light lagers, impressive with the low calorie sacrifices. Flavors are much the same with good cleanliness, no apparent off-flavors, but no meaninful complexity either. Texutres also recognize the fair malt base, but the grain astringency keeps the beer from gaining points on mouthfeel. Finishes with the same part-grain, part-malt flavor that is evident throughout. Fleeting aftertaste and waters quickly. Not a beer that I would go to often, but when I need to quench a thirst, not think about the beer, or don't appreciate paying $5.50 for an average Pale Ale at the local sports bar during the game."
"Miller Genuine Draft Light 64 pours a pale yellow with a thick white head from a clear twelve ounce bottle. The aroma is mildly grainy, typical industrial lager smell. The flavor is mild, sweet grain is present, just barely and that's about it. This one is particularly light and lacking in flavor."
"I am not lying when I say that MGD 64 resembles bottled water. Not a horrible beer in the sense of tasting bad, but definitely a bad beer in terms of lack of taste. I will pass on this offering in the future."
"The drinkability on this beer is very high because it is easy to take down. It is almost too easy too drink as I have a feeling I know a couple of people who could drink a case of these and not feel a thing."
"This beer is a product of board room meetings trying to identify target markets. That target market is me, a beer drinker who wants to eat healthy and keep drinking beer without getting fat. 64 calories is what you get and should be the name of the beer. I enjoy Miller High Life and consider it to be a great value but this beer doesn't come close. It has been filtered and filtered again until nothing was left but water, alcohol, and 64 calories. This website says it is 4.7% alcohol. I'm finding that hard to believe, it can't be more than 2.3%. I'd buy it again if it gave me a buzz, but it doesn't."
"D- Full marks here because quite frankly I could drink this all night! Very refreshing and the perfect summer beer. It's light, crisp and doesn't leave any heavy tastes on the palate. Plus a person doesn't have to feel guilty about putting back several, with the low calorie count and all. A great alternative to a soda!"
"Tastes like Pellegrino, mixed with a splash of beer, with a funky (and not the good kind) aftertaste. Skip it, unless it's left at your party, and even then, skip it."
"Pours pale and fizzy from the can. Initially, this gave off a hydrogen sulfide rotten egg sort of smell that was off putting, but not quite offensive enough to be awful. This smell gave way to an odor that reminded me of playdough. I've never had that before in a beer. It is faint, so not truly offensive, but weird. I've had two cans of this stuff in the last week and these aromas have been present both times, so it is not some freaky set of circumstances. The taste initally was slightly sweet and grainy, with an emphasis on slightly. Ultimately, the taste is dominated by carbonation bite. The mouthfeel is what you expect in a light beer. If you are looking for something big, obviously this isn't it. While it is drinkable, even if one grants consideration for the light beer style guidelines, it just fails to impress."
"Even the gal said this is no good; she's going back to Coors light. Oh my, still have work to do."
"Anyway, worth taking a dive into if your looking for a cheap light beer to stock the fridge with."
"(ok, maybe that's a stretch, ... but I couldn't resist :-)"
"(thanks to Wikipedia!)"
"Personally I think it needs at least 5 more calories to add some flavor and then they could call it Miler Genuine Draft 69...then they'd be on to something."
"One thing this beers has going for it is there is really no flavor. That is about it though. A clear yellow color with the usual bad fizzy head. No flavor or aroma besides the old grainy malts and grassy hops. A light fizzy body finishes me off. This one goes down the drain."
"Poured a light yellow with a fair amount of foam that dissapated with in a few seconds. The smell and aroma was very weak. The taste was also weak and had sort of a watery bitterness while drinking it. Not much difference between this Light Lager and the others. They all seem to be the same. Drank this swill because I was visiting a friend and couldn't be a snob by turning him down!"
""
"This beer was left at my home by one of my wife's friends (who is watching calories). I say why drink beer if you are watching your calories, but that is another story. On to the beer, poured into a pint glass (even though the bottle is clear). Straw color with almost no white head, no lacing. This beer smells of some corn and grainy malt. The taste has a corn flavor, carbonation leaves an odd aftertaste. This beer is too watered down for its own good. Not impressed, but wasn't expecting much."
"This is the only beer that I've ever reviewed that I didn't pour into a glass. The bottle's clear so screw it. I can see the clear golden yellow appearance and thin white head. Maybe I could smell it better if poured into a glass seeing that I don't smell much here. It smells better than some other macro light beers that I've smelled. Although it smells as if lesser fermentables were used in the brewing... I've smelled worse. Pretty clean non-bitter taste. One of the better macro light beers out there, but not a very good BEER beer."
"D - This is fairly typical of the style...not very satisfying or very tasty."
"Had this in the can and didn't bother pouring it. Smell is heavyish, not airy like most light macros but there really is nothing there but some adjuncts like corn and maybe some barley. The mouthfeel is fine and slick, very smooth. That is because this stuff has almost flavor whatsoever. It isn't even bad, it is non-descript. Just nothing to note of, and the only reason I drank this is because my cheap beer buddy is on a diet. I should've just had a glass of water."
"Very weak beer-like flavor. Not much else to add. A bit fizzy and light bodied. I would think it is extremely low calorie. This is a quantity over quality beer but at its price point I can think of a couple of other macro lagers I would pick up instead of this one."
"right there in the Mich Lt/Bud Lt mold. High on carbonation. decent appearance for a light beer. To much corn in the taste..there's a twangy fruit...but I think it's just sour corn. Head is whispy and leaves quickly. Crisp finish makes it quite drinkable although this beer is truly unremarkable. Haven't had shiner lt....but to me Mich Lt has a slight edge on the lt macro catagory. avoid unless it's -8.99 or unless you just want to feel like you're saving calories."
"Drinkability - Bad beer that lacks character. I'm kind of offended that this beer is being marketed in my hometown (Madison, WI) - I think we're a little better than that."
"This tastes about like every other macro out there. Easy-to-drink out in the heat but not much of an experience. Enjoy if your short on options."
"D - If you drink it glacially cold, you can get away with drinking this beer at a dive bar. Otherwise, avoid at all costs."
"oh yeah, when i thought that i could lose weight by drinking ""lite"" beers instead of cutting out the processed food, this was a staple. i used to be loyal to mgd before i knew what good beer was, and this is just a smaller version of mgd. some corn adjunct flavors and aromas are detectable if you try really hard. pale, colorless, tasteless, fizzy crap, but it was cheap. oh, those 30-packs and a frozen glass...why didn't i just drink vodka if i didn't want to taste anything?"
"Yea, this is just about as average as you can get. Did the Michelob Golden Draft Lite taste test and they are just about even. What did I expect? You know, I just wish the days of cases of 24 returnables for $7.50 was still around. You found a lot of friends that would drink a lot of average beer without one snide remark."
"Pours an albino golden hue with pristine clairity; generating a one and half finger soapy head. Holds a very thin cap for most of the glass and surprisingly, it even leaves sticky waves of lacing. Clean-ish nose, some rice and other cereal adjuncts are the only noticable aromas. Scrubbed pale lager malt and tannic adjunct taste-very light with no hop flavor anywhere. A suggestion of hop extract bitterness balances the very delicate flavor and the aftertaste dries away to blankness almost instantly. Crisp and sharp carbonation and seltzery body- quite effervescent. The drinkability could be called excellent since a few seconds after taking a sip you could easily forget you were having a beer. A good attmept at tasting like nothing."
"Drinkability- It's okay, as long as you don't tip the glass to your mouth expecting to taste beer."
"overall this is an ok beer, not something i would buy again though"
"try with mexican beer, enchiladas, tacos de trompo and green sauce chicharron; 45% recommended."
"D- There is no malt flavor and no real hop flavor. It is not to interesting and I would rather drink water."
"I guess the best thing you could say about this beer is that it has a little more favor than Miller Light. Of course, that's not hard to do since Miller Light is basically bottled water with some alcohol in it. One should only drink this beer in high school when they want the girls to think they're a rebel because they don't drink light beers."
"For a light beer, this isnt too bad. Clear morning urine color with plenty of carbonation and a thin white film. Mild aroma of sweet grain and corn. Tastes slightly of corn and cereal grains with a minimal amount of hop bittering. Mouthfeel is light and sweet. Finish is crisp from the carbonation and mildly acidic. Drinkability is better than most in the category. Not repulsive in any way some many macro lights are. Just not much going on."
"D- big gulps are key here..."
"Dog-gone good for a light brew in my humble opinion."
"The lighter version of MGD and it shows. Very similar except the corn flavors and grainy bitterness are mellowed down. Body is light but more crisp than I would have expected. There's a bit less smoothness to this than the Miller/Bud/Coors Lights but that might not be such a bad thing. Corn flavors are obvious and some bitterness from either the grains or hops, I'm not sure. Finish is a bit acidic to go with the crispness. I actually prefer this to most of the other macro lights, but it's still not a good beer."
"At least is not the worst beer I have ever tried. And this light version is better than the regular one, yes, I do not know why, but it is a rare event. With this, I actually had a good chat, a little annoying the beer, but was not trying to make me puke like the previous one I had from this brewery."
"This review is for Miller ""Genuine Draft Light", not for Miller ""Genuine Draft Light 64", Two different brews, two different ABV%."
"After pizza diner drinking Guinness and Hacker Pschorr Weiss beer I had to grab something for Fireside Chat with my family at a small store. Well it turned out AOK. This beer will not win many awards but I found it to be very refreshing and easy to drink without the feeling I was not actually drinking beer. Decent light beer . I must admit. Actually, damn close to Amstel light in quality."
"poured a pale yellow color with adequate long-lasting white head. Smell is very minimal with only some slight sweetness noted. Taste follows the smell being very light, but refreshing. Finish is refreshing, but lacks any malt or hop taste. Good spacer."
"As far as light American macrobrew beers go, I would rate this beer as decent. This beer pours a light yellow color with no head and has a cereal grain scent. The taste is light and refreshing. Great cold on a hot day where you don't want too much alcohol or too much aftertaste."
"Drinability: No taste and no soul but such a drinkable beer. Great for tailgating"
"Better than it's full flavored brother. Pours out to a medium golden color with decent carbonation, and a short lived white foamy head. Notes of alcohol, hops and corn were observed on the inital aroma, although a bread like scent was also noted half way through. Flavor is mostly water and corn, but I can see how this could been a good beer on a hot summer day, if it was really cold and there was nothing else. Finished weakly, with the lingering taste of zinc or steel, with a touch of alcohol. Not a terrible brew, but not wonderful either. Worth a try."
"The mouthfeel was thin, but the beer did have decent zippy carbonation. Drinkablity is a tougher call, it is easy drinking and better than Bud or Miller lite, but still a yawner."
"The beer leaves the 12-ounce clear bottle a light yellow color with a modest frothy bright white head with the residual lace a thin sheet. Nose is malt, fresh and crisp, the start sweet with a light grain profile and the top skinny in feel. Finish is brisk in its acidity, the hops light and the aftertaste dry."
"One of the most common beers on the market today. First of all the the thing that kills me has occasionally made me cry, being here in Germany any one can imagine all the delectable brews on the menu. Saying this it only makes me think down on alot of beer drinkers or should I say haven't got a clue about beer and drink what ever they had laying around the trailer. On the other hand this is a wonderful beer that will produce a good taste, tenderize or put a zip on any meal that you are cooking. I actually sent my wife to the store to buy it because I didn't want anyone actually seeing me buy it. All this aside the beer can chicken that this produces is mouth watering, the bratwurst are to die for and don't get me started on the beer battering. The 3 bucks a six pack keeps me coming back for more. Oh ya, it foams alot when I poor it in the pan and even more when I poor it in the flour for the batter and I allways get my gasmask out to keep the smell out of my nose I would never punish my senses like that so I am not sure of the taste or the mouthfeel."
"First off I hate the bottles these beers come in. Clear bottle where you see a beer that turns you off. Very straw yellow, when poured color remains very straw/piss yellow with no head just glass lacing on the top. The smell is very strong of grain and corn, not very lager smelling. Taste is very watered down with a hop taste in the rear. Very light and dull in the mouth, drinkable because it is so light, but will never be in my fridge."
"Straw yellow color, with a white head that quickly dissipates. Smells very grainy with a little malt. Taste is almost vacant. After having a couple spiced winter brews tonight,this stuff is closer to water than beer. I can sense a little corn and malt, but not much. Not offensive, but not good by any means."
"Typical American beer. Pours a light, golden colour and has a snow white head. Delicate lacing and has the smell of most American beer; light to moderate yeasty/ bready smell. A wee bit sweeter than most other American beers and far more palatable than Bud light, if I may be perimetted to say the ""B" word. MGD light goes down easy and is a great inexpensive brew to enjoy in breaks while doing lawn work. I have found the above to hold true with most products from Miller Brewing Company. One thing I particularly like about this brew is that is has a light cracker/biscuit after taste. I had originally given this one 3.0 in all categories, but after some time of drinking it, it has grown on me a little and I notice a few more things about it that I didn't the first go 'round."
"Notes: Is what it is. Tasty? No. Cheap? Quite. Drastically lower in calories than, say, your standard pale ale or pilsener? Not really (110 to 150)."
"Finishes dry, with no aftertaste."
"Drinkability/notes: Not particularly good, but OK if free, as in free beer."
"MGD Light is pretty much a substitute for water. Compared to Miller Lite and High Life Light, I'd probably choose this if I had to settle for a Light beer from Miller. Certainly, less offensive from a taste stand point than Bud Light, of course that's not saying much. This beer might serve a purpose on a hot day after mowing the lawn (cliche?) or putting out the flames from some hot buffalo wings or other spicy food. But water works just as well."
"Same as any other light beer i can remember having. Pointless to drink really. Real pale color, no taste except for water. The regular beer is terrible, so imagine what the light tastes like. There are worse light beers i guess, but whats that really saying anyways?"
"Served on tap at a hotel bar with only the Buds in competition. Bland. The appearance was light yellow with not remarkable quality other than general clarity. White, thin with no staying power and a little light lacing. I kept trying to grasp the taste, but there just wasn't anything there. Watery and thin with no aroma to give it a lift. There just wasn't enough of any impression to give a sense of this beer. To say something positive - it beats Bud."
"Very carbonated...if you want an evening of beer burps try this. My distributor had cases of cans of this for 9 bucks so I bought one for a party figuring in a best case scenario Id only get 6 of them if that. I was happy when the night was said and done I had only 5 to bring home with me. Smell is very musty with a scent comparable to other brews that rely heavily on corn. Taste is just that of a heavily watered MGD; this is not a smooth drinking brew. After this one I only have four left. I wonder if the dog will drink it? Only one way to find out...(j/k)"
"Another, ""let's make a lite version for the stupid public"" beer. Watered down Genuine Draft is all this crap is. If you are that calorie conscience, drink a regular draft on the threadmill. Or better yet, there's always four roses."
"All in all, a very weak light beer. Miller Lite attempts to retain some flavor.  This stuff tastes almost exactly like Genuine Draft with even more water in it."
"This beer truly has a funny aftertaste.  Is it brewed with Hi Karate cologne left over from the 70s?  I have tried this on several occasions, and it never improves.  Note to self:  Quit trying this on any occasion.  Overtones of corn with the funky aftertaste just mentioned."
"A neighbor gave me one, while I was locked out of my house today. It was pretty good. Golden straw color, not much smell. Decent taste, pretty sweet and watery, not too much flavor. Some graininess on the finish, really have to concentrate to taste anything. But it's way better than a budweiser."
"Light, lighter, lightest?  No, but its close.  Very pale, very clear, lots of bubbles.  Its got that Miller corn taste, which I very much prefer over A-B.  As the warm weather comes on, it'll probably be the beer I drink when the temperature hits 92 degrees plus, cannot imagine drinking it at any temperature less than that."
"Basically, if someone has a gun at your head forcing you to choose a light beer....this should be your choice.  Otherwise...you should know better."
"never liked it"
"Water, water, water - WATER - this is why I got divorced"
"Notes: A little better in the bottle than the can, either way it is about them same. A beer that must beer served cold. Not a beer to brag about drinking the night before."
"Better than Miller Lite, not that this says much.  Still, the hops are there and taste like real hops.  Thin and bland, as one would expect.  Not bad as a back yard cooling off sort of beer."
