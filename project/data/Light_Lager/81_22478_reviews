"Lots of hate on here for this... But compared to other light beers, I actually like it. It's surprisingly crisp and clean. Probably mostly water haha. But not bad if you are driving!"

"Not bad, not good. Somewhere in the middle."

"A lot more crisp than regular Heineken"
"This is a great LIGHT beer and that is why I am giving it such a high score. If you have ever tried a lot of different light beers then you know this stuff is pretty friggin' awesome! It's not much different from an original Heineken just a tad bit lighter in taste. I love this beer because I can cut the calories and keep the taste."
"Slight skunky smell but typical of what you'd expect from Heineken.  Definitely better than the 56 overall rating though....tastes like slightly watered down Heineken. Typical light beer but good on a warm day playing golf."
"O:  Not outstanding but one of the better light beers that I have had"
""
""
"Not great. Not much to say"
"Someone left a whole case of this swill on my back porch. One day I ran out of beer, I say beer cause Heineken light is NOT beer, anyway I ran out of real beer & had to drink one of these. I can not believe Heineken sells this junk. This is the worst beer I ever had, tastes like water with a 3. Abv? I compare this to boxed wine, it's horrible. No hope at all, no flavor at all, you might as well drink carbonated water because Heineken light is only carbonated water has no flavor no alcohol completely and absolutely the worst beer I ever drank in my life!!"

"Did the job while not taking too many calories from reg Heinekens"

"Watered down version of the regular. Ok for light beer, but not good."

"Funny story about this one. My wife and I were summer vacationing in Delaware. I'm a craft beer drinker she is not. Being that it was scorching hot, she wanted to buy a 12 pack of Heineken for the week because it was cheap. I reluctantly agreed. She went inside the store and mistakenly bought Heineken Light. (She must have been in a rush) When we got back home we noticed this and drove back to the liquor store to exchange it. The bad news was that in Delaware it is state law that all alcohol purchases are non refundable/exchangeable.Long story short, we got stuck with Heineken Light all week. What else to say about this beer? It is watery and devoid of flavor. Never again!"

"Pours to a thin white head with minimal lacing. color is pale golden. Aroma is light grains and grassy hops. Flavor is a weak grain and hop concoction that finishes clean. Mouthfeel is light and effervescent. Not bad for a light beer."

"This does suck quite a bit, but not as badly as I'd thought it would."
"Overall: Not as skunky as Heineken, not as watery as the low ABV suggests. Beer ingredients are masked by metallic notes."

"Surprisingly disgusting, given that this brewery does make a number of good lagers (mostly unavailable in the U.S.)."
""
""
"This is a quality light lager.  while AAL light lagers are very cheap and not really good, (Coors Light is the only one I'll drink) This one is just spectacular. I can smell hops. The taste is really hoppy too, and light. Not really light on flavor, as it still has plenty of hoppy flavor and a hint of malt. Don't know why this is rated so bad. This honestly i have had 5 with barbecue chicken, and i am not really drunk or full. 3.3% ABV makes this perfect for me. Perfect session beer. The reason i liked coors was the fact it was  low in alcohol and didnt fill me up. this does the same thing while retaining a good amount of flavor. Would drink this a lot."

"For the style this beer is very good. It is watery, but what do you expect for 99 calories and 3.2% alcohol? This is a light style lager. If you want a stout or IPA then drink that instead. If you want a low abv light lager then this is pretty nice. I could drink this all day when fishing out in the hot sun. If you can get past the wateriness it is a good beer."

"Pours pale yellow in color with a 1-finger frizzy white head that didn't last long. Some light spotty lacing was seen with each sip, but not much. Lots of bubbles rising from the bottom and sides of the glass due to the above average carbonation. The aroma is close to their regular Heineken, which is slightly 'skunky' as is like most brews in green bottles. (Right Mario Esposito?) , which is of grains with a hint of sweet corn. Not much else. The taste like just like a watered-down Heineken but actually not as heavily-bodied as a regular Heiny."

"Pours a crystal clear pale yellow color with a smallish bone white head that shows little retention. Light sweet bready malty pilsner aroma with a whole lot of skunk. The flavor is a light bready grainy maltiness with a hint of hop bitterness and again a bit of mercaptan. Light body with a spritzy level of carbonation and a slick watery mouthfeel. I can't get away from the skunky aroma to find much to like about this beer, probably a poor example to be a classic style imho."

"I actually like this better than regular Heineken. its cleaner, fresher tasting, more carbonated, and less filling. no metallic or adjuncts really either, just better. still crap though, sudsy white head on yellow liquid. smell of fresh pils malts and generic ale yeast. watery and soft, but not devoid of flavor. malt forward, balancing hops only, a good slammer beer, golf beer, boat beer etc, but with very little redeeming qualities outside of these contexts. good bubbles, refreshing when freezing, and affordable enough. it has a role, and its better than the other light beers, especially the imports. I can get behind this a little bit, also seems to be handled better than the regular, which eliminated the skunky odor and taste I associate with the parent beer here."
""
""
"Taste is similar to other light lagers but does have a bit of fruitiness that helps it stand out, also has a hint of earthiness. Mouthfeel is very light with high carbonation, what you would expect."

"Light bodied beer. Tastes like a pilsner that is less bitter than average. I thought it was pretty good with a pleasing light carbonated taste. Not too much complex flavor, but that is how these beers are; has somewhat unusual aftertaste. Be sure to get a 12 pack so the light doesn't skunk the beer..."
""
""
""
"Not bad for a light beer, has some flavor to it actually. If I was forced to drink a light beer I'd probably go with this one."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Decent amount of flavor considering this is actually lighter/has less alcohol than most light beers even - if you gotta go light this may be one of the better choices."
""
"Overall: Drank this because it was offered to me at my best friend's house or I wouldn't have ordered it. Not a fan of light beers and very few have caught my attention. This definitely isn't one of them. Salud."

"O- This was my only choice at a friend's house today. Otherwise, I may never have drank this beer. I did not finish the entire serving but it was easy to read."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Very easy to drink on. Would be great for the summer."
""
""
""
"O: This beer isn't that bad for a light lager because it tastes a lot like a regular Heineken but just is a little lighter-bodied."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Overall, it was slightly better than expected for the beer having a "" light "" lable on it. Realistically, It's just another Euro Lage, although far better than a lot of light and regular adjuncts. I'd have again if handed one."
"Overall, let's move on, nothing to see here. Much better out there even in this style for sure!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This beer did not do a lot for me. I bought the second 6 because the first were so ordinary that i thought that they were old. It just left me wanting more. Granted it is a light beer but there are others out there that do a better job of quenching your thirst and have more flavor."

"Well we all know that Heineken is a good go-to beer and the Heineken Light is not the exception. This is a good interpretation of a Light Lager beer, it remains with body and taste even though it is light. It is much alike like its bigger brother the Regular Lager, it tastes a bit bitter with many hops but it is very smooth at the same time. It is very refreshing and the aftertaste is a bit on the dry side. Overall a good beer to drink while at a picnic or BBQ outing."
""
"The beer Pours a light yellow with fizzy head... doesnt stick around long. Smells like a light beer. Tastes like a light beer. Mouthfeel is like water. Overall on par with miller and bud light.. dont think Ill be having any more of this stuff any time soon."

"Clear yellow body with an inch of white head that settles slowly. Some patchy lacing, looks ok for a light beer. Nose and taste are both super skunky, sharp and pungent, with some grainy malt and a hint of flowery hops underneath. Some adjunct taste of cereal grains or rice, perhaps. But it’s that classic green bottle Heinie skunk all the way that dominates. Light bodied with ample carbonation and a crisp and refreshing mouthfeel. Super drinkable if you like drinking skunk flavored, watery beverages. Something about the skunkiness ignites a wave of nostalgia in me, bringing me back to my youthful experiences with lousy euro lagers, so I don’t hate this as much as most, but I still wouldn’t buy it..or drink it again. On offer at a barbeque so I gave it a shot. Still not the worst of the worst."
""
""
"O: Easy to drink and sessionable but not one of my favorite styles of beer or a particular beer that I want to come back and have again."
"Overall – It is very much a “watered-down” version of Heineken. Nothing too spectacular."
""
""
""
"Smells almost putrid, but hey, it levels off after that, becoming inoffensive (mostly), and, well light. Good, I suppose, if you can't get a glass of water to go with your real beer."

"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was how easily it goes down. If you’re looking for a light brew with mild flavoring, this is something you might be interested in. The beer lacks any real flavoring, but comes forth with basic malts and a light airy background. It is not as offensive as many others like it, but is also not something I would regularly stock in my fridge."
""

"This lacks flavor. It's drinkable and refreshing but musty and forgettable. I'll pass in the future."

"O: This is about as bad a beer as I've ever had. I left some room in the rankings for something truly awful but don't let that fool you - you're better off drinking almost anything other than this."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I'm really not impressed with this light lager. I think this may be a style that I should just avoid in the future, as it has no appeal to me."

"Pours a very pale, clear yellow that has a fast disappearing head even if you pour the beer way too quickly. Scent is that cheap grains which are musty to my nose. Taste is weak, very weak. This is barely a step up from water. This is basically water with a hint of beer. It amazes me how this stuff even sells on a regular basis. This is one of those beers that it should be ok for minors to buy due to its weakness. I'm glad it was free because at full price $12 was $12 too much."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Taste is light pilsener. Nothing special, pretty bubbly, mostly like flavored water. Very light on the mouth. Overall a fairly average/below average light beer."

""

"Overall: I am not a light beer drinker. This is what was offered. I did not particularly enjoy this but a light beer is a light beer. No damage done. I'd certainly reach for this beer over the mainstream light beers."
""
""
""
""
""
"Take Heineken 6 pack. Add equal parts water to the beer. Voila! 12 pack of Heinecken light."

"Beer pours a clear and very yellow, looks like light beer.... about a finger worth of head after a hard pour that dissipated very quickly. No lacing. Smell was grainy and skunky... not much good here. Smells like Euro light beer. Taste is just like the smell... corny and grainy, but oddly the shunkiness is not here... Tastes like average Euro Light. Mouthfeel is crisp, but nor as carbonated as I was expecting. Pretty average. Overall it is not the worst Euro Light I've ever had.... but not worth running after... Decent"
"over, as light beer beer goes this is okay, which is not saying much at all. it doesn't trigger the gag reflex or anything but i can't think of a good enough reason for ever drinking it again."
"I hope that keg was old, because if it was fresh, then may God have mercy on the brewers who made this garbage. I believe this is the first beer I've ever had that I simply could not finish nor find anything positive about."
"At the end of the day, it's not good, but it's not offensive either. I've had worse."
"O: Not a light lager that I would reach for. Lacks in taste and the skunk flavor is too overpowering."
"This beer pours a copper color, with actually a larger head. The smell can only be described as a skunk spraying, just horrible. The taste is light, a tad matly, just a little bit of a skunk flavor. It actually isnt too difficult to drink, and its a bit heavier for a light beer. Overall for a light beer, this so far takes the cake, much better then other light lagers, I could actually go for another."
"Part of an elite group of beers that might actually make me quit drinking beers."
"Poured a 2"" head which recedes medium quick. Clear light straw yellow in color. Smells with hints of skunking and wee little grass and malt. Taste is watery but a touch sweet and a hint of malt. Finish is light and disappears fast. So folks, why is this such a huge seller? It's because it's so watery and inoffensive you'd give it to your children were it not for having alcohol content."
"As an avid homebrewer and drinker of many types of beer, I can honestly say that, for a Light beer, I find this to be very refreshing... especially on a hot summer day barbecuing in the backyard. I never was a big fan of Heineken unless I was getting them for 50 cents a bottle in Las Vegas, but I must say that I can easily put a few of these down. This is a decent Light beer, and cost me $6.49/6 at Total Wine. I'm about to go get another one after writing this review! I guess the key word here is ""refreshing'. It all comes down to what you are in the mood for. If you're having some company over for the day go out and buy a case or two of this brew and drop it in a large bucket of ice. I'm sure nobody will complain."
"Overall: I have nothing against light beers, but this one really does taste like water. Refreshing yes, but not what I am going to go for when I want a beer. Still sadly better then the original version."
"RJT"
"O - My friend from the Netherlands would be pissed to see this review, but thankfully he's not on BA. Seriously though, Miller 64 has more flavor than this. I could put these down before, during, and after a marathon. You could also use this to hydrate after a long day of drinking...or mask your scent while hunting. I will hand it to Heineken though, they do a fantastic job on marketing and design."
"Pours a pale yellow color, some carbonation, little fizzy white head, with some minimal sticky lacing left behind. The nose is grainy/ricy. The taste is the same as the nose. Light Body. Again another lame attempt for a beer. What a waste of a bottle."
"This brew was one of my early beers I had, I actually stole a bottom from a friends parents fridge hoping they wouldn't notice. As far as I know they never noticed. Anyway the beer was decent at the time but since then I've had much better. The beer looks much like regular Heineken and smells the too. the taste is just a little more watered down."
"D - Fairly drinkable and not offensive in any way. As a direct comparison, I much preferred the now defunct Rock Green Light."
"Pours almost clear piss coloured yellow hints. Lots of carbonation but very little head. Served ice cold. Smells like nothing. Maybe a touch of some malts but really not much. Tastes like water with some light maltiness but not much. Okay mouthfeel. Overly carbonated for my tastes. But fairly drinkable as a light lager"
"This is a good dollar beer night beer. Couldn't wait to get home and get something hoppy with a little flavor to it!"
"The beer pours a pale gold color with a thick fizzy white head that quickly fades to lacing. The aroma is average. It has a light pilsner malt and German hop scent. It's light and watered down; like a weaker version of the original. The taste is average as well. It has a light, pilsner malt flavor with a touch of hops and a dry finish. It's easy drinking and attractive to people who like light beers. The mouthfeel is decent. It is a low bodied beer with good carbonation. This is a average light lager. It's quaffable, yet devoid of much malt character."
"D- I can't drink it at all. Poured it down the drain."
"Taste is also very bland, dry and boring. Mouthfeel is very light and dry, it's easy drinking for a buzz but not a good beer at all. It's got such a low abv though it's hardly even worth drinking."
"D: This is a great brew to drink if you are looking to pound a case and have to use the bathroom every other beer, other wise for this light lager style, there are many domestic and imports that rise high above."
"I like this better than other light beers, but ultimately I could still only drink one of these."
"This is one of the few light beers that I will actually drink. The beer is very very clear in color, almost colorless. The Smell is light and sweet, there is practically zero head when I poured into a glass. It is however very refreshing and great for social getherings. Serve well chilled, as the colder this ber is, the better it is."
"Pours straw out of a keg with a thin, bright white head. Aroma is of grass and a little cereal. Palate is extremely thin and watery. taste is non existent. It was the only beer available at my friend's Birthday party. I poured out the glass into the sink after the first sip. Do not try it at home!"
"I'm not going to spend more characters than I have to describing a very average, very clean, refreshing enough light beer with a touch of hop flavor. Grainy, watery, decent carbonation, a hop or two, overall boringly inoffensive. Deserves a better score than most people are giving it."
"Good three finger head of soap suds like bubbles, but the color is very light, a 3 on the SRM beer color chart. Lace is thick and clinging. Faint smell of straw and wet wheat. Flavor is light and very bland, not much taste here at all, maybe a little corn flavor. Much like water with a little fizz in my mouth. Not worth the price, in fact I would not take one if it was available with other free beer."
"D: OK, it is not the worst Euro Light I've ever had.... but not worth running after... Decent"
"Not the worst, but among them."
"Taste is skunk. Feel is skunk. There's quite the theme here. There's some prickly carbonation that thankfully carries much of the flavor away. Some slight grain, but not all that much. This is a bad beer. There's not that much going on, but what is there I really don't like."
"A super wimpy beer! Pours a thin straw yellow color with a thin white head and a tiny little bit of lacing. Smells of grain and corn and a little malt. Tastes like grain and corn and a little bitterness. Mouthfeel is thin and watery. Drinkability is decent, it is a wussy beer!"
"Never had heineken light until now. everyones reviews were spot on, so i wont waste my time typing something that doesnt deserve a critical review, and at 3% abv, i feel like im drinking skunk smelling water. basically, i drank it to add it to my bottle collection and the remaining will be used for beer pong when the buddies come over"
"Fairly generic lager. There isn't anything special about the pour. Looks golden and fairly clear. I cannot discern anything from the smell of the beer. You couldn't tell it was beer. The taste is actually not terrbile. Granted there isn't much there but I've had much worse. Mouthfeel is typical for the style; some carbonation but generally smooth since the ABV is so low. It is drinkable and not the worst choice you could make. I'd choose something with more flavor, even as a light lager."
"i find it humorous that this is getting slammed but for a light lager it does ok. it still retains a good bit of flavor. this was a typical golf course beer that we had after shooting 18, and it was decent and if it was between this and the massive amounts of budweiser, i would take this hands down."
"Final thoughts: I poured this thing down the drain after half a glass. Avoid this beer!! ...unless you are offered one at a party and dont want to seem rude."
"Pretty good for a lighter beer. I think it is a little too heavily carbonated, and seems a little like an alcoholic sprite. The carbonation definitely overrides any truly distinctive flavor in the beer. Despite this, i do think heineken is more refreshing than most beers, and i never turn one down"
"Overall I will pass, while it is not as horrible tasting as some of the others, its blandness does me in."
"The beer pours a very light yellow with a white head. The aroma is straight skunk. I know this is not how the brewer intended the beer to smell, but when you choose a light green bottle for your beer, you should be held responsible if it skunks. The flavor is not as skunky and has notes of corn and grass. Thin mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"D - I wouldn't buy this again, it's closer to water than it is to beer."
"As a light beer, it's very drinkable. I wouldn't choose it over other cheaper light beers, but I could easily finish 6."
"Better than an American light beer maybe, but still not one I'd want to try again."
"My pour produced a finger-and-a-half of fluffy bone-white head with decent retention. Color was a light lemon-yellow with NE-quality clarity. Nose was slightly sulfuric underlain by a slight lager sweetness. Mouthfeel was thin and watery, a real drawback of the style. It had a light lager seetness on the tongue. Finish was mild and unobtrusive. It really begets the question, ""Why?"" It was inoffensive, but it was also pretty tasteless and bland. Why bother?"
"Drinkability- Its drinkability really depends on your tastes. If you just finished mowing the lawn and discovered your sink is broken, this serves as an acceptable substitute for water. If your goal is to get drunk without ingesting too many calories or without tasting what goes into your mouth, this serves as an ideal beer. If, however, your goal is to explore and enjoy a delicious beer, this is not the beer for you."
"D- Drinkable. I could see anyone having maybe a six pack of this in a couple hours. Nothing really could hold one back from drinking a lot of these because the alcohol content is low."
"It is worth drinking if only to understand how far beer has come."
"Ultimately, this is a good beer to use for cooking (fondue, beer bread, etc.), but avoid drinking this is you have other options."
"Drinkability- It is very drinkable because it has little flavoring to it, and is not that expensive"
"Overall: I don't know why you would bother picking this over regular Heineken, which is pretty tame to begin with."
"Unfortunately this beer is not even as good as Heineken. Very watery and boring. Easy to drink on a hot summer day, but with so many other great craft offerings that are light and easy to drink as well, this one will not even be on my radar any more."
"Pours an almost clear straw yellow with lots of fizz activity rising to the top and immediately dissipating. Not any head to speak of, other than a very thin ring of white bubble clusters around the perimeter of the glass. Smells rather bourgeois with just enough malt to be described as a beer. Taste is even less so, almost tastes like beer flavored soda water. Mouthfeel is about the same. It is rather drinkable because there is nothing offensive about any of its components."
"Picked up one of the 5 Liter mini-kegs for the Champions League game today, all hail Lionel Messi! Poured from the mini keg into a nice tall German glass. Very golden in color like jewelry with a nice foamy head that has good retention and leaves light lace. Nose is slightly malty/grainy and that's it but better than some light beers I have had. Taste is also a bit malty and better flavored than many light beers I have had. Mouthfeel is light but creamy with appropriate carbonation. A coat of light malt stays on the tongue. Sessionable with a good price, one of the better light beers I have had."
"Just another lager for the masses."
"Once poured in my ""bayern pilsener"" glass. Look: Golden glass crystal color, creamy foamy head with medium lenght, never had a light beer with good head; Smell: Sweet grains, smoked malt and herbal hops; Taste: Sweet grains again, cereal and spring water, the ingredients from the smell disappear; Mouthfeel: Watery, slightly bitter, very soft body and medium carbonation; Drinkability: A like beer that liked the smell but with nothing more to highlight, because the taste and mouthfeel doesn's impress."
"I will make this short and sweet...This beer is skunky and bland. You can not use green bottles and expect the beer not to have that skunky taste. It smells aweful to boot. On top of all of this, it is only 3.30% which is total suck. I went to Amsterdam and I do not recall the Dutch actually drinking this beer. IF you want to step away from the super shwag such as Budweiser and Miller, and take it to that next level, skip this and try something from Samuel Adams, Flying Fish, or Long Trail. Heineken brings the suck!!!"
"Overall, Heineken light is hard for me to rate, because it certainly isn't terrible considering it is a light lager, but it isn't good either. Although I may not have encountered many, I'm sure the Light Lager could be done better. With that said, this beer tastes a bit like real beer and wasn't too offensive."
"Taste: Bland and unoffensive. What most consumers look for in light beers. Tiniest hint of hop spice. I just wish there was a little more substance to this beer."
"Notes: It lacked the skunked flavor of a green bottle, but maybe thats a bad thing, atleast that way it has some flavor. This literally tastes like water. With some increased taste it wouldn't be bad, but sadly even Amstel Light beats this."
"Poured from a green 12 oz. bottle. Has a light golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is a bit skunky, some malts. Taste is crisp, malts and slightly sweet. Feels light in the mouth and is highly drinkable. Overall this is not a bad selection at all as far as light beers go."
"i can barely drink regular heineken let alone Heineken Light. its basically flavored water and yellow die in a bottle, also due to its light colored green bottle you tend to get one that is skunked at least once a day at the bar. there is no good smell to it and it tends to make you sick if you try to put them down to quickly, i personally suggest that you steer clear of this beer if you can."
"My roommate picked it up and I've had it before but I figured might as well review it...There are some macros I can still drink, Heineken is one, Heineken Light is not. Mostly there's no point. 3.3%...it's like skunky carbonated water. Yeah it's drinkable, but why would you want to drink it??"
"its honestly not worth the price in comparison to a macro/micro that actually brings something to the table"
"D: Of course it's drinkable (meaning you could slam a lot of these), but really, would you want to? And anyway, if you're looking for a beer to slam down, why pay extra for an import? Bud light comes in 24-packs at a much cheaper price."
"D - I could drink 100 of these, easy. But I wouldn't enjoy it. Experience is about 1 degree above water."
"From the 1 pt. 8 fl. oz. bottle with a number on the back that reads 911952850001. Sampled on September 6, 2009. The pour is golden yellow with a bubbly white head that fizzles down to nothing quickly. Green light struck bottle aroma overpowers the weak scents of barley and hops. Thin mouthfeel. The taste has a mixture of weak hops and malts but nothing great."
"Drinkability: Provided you have your lil' heart set on purchasing Heineken Light, to ensure you circumvent the Euro-skunk, buying this in a can is really the only way to go."
"Pours a straw light yellow color. The smell is of really nothiness, and some rice or corn grains. The taste is of corn and rice grains, the taste is very light and watery. The mouthfeel is crisp and clean. Overall you could drink a lot of these, however, it is very close to being too watery and you would get bored very very quick."
"d- it is very drinkable for what it is, very light, crisp, i could drink alot of this, just wouldn't drink this for the taste."
"This is carbonated water masquerading as a beer. I think Perrier has more malt flavor than this. I hope this does not have more than 10 calories...no flavor, barely any alcohol...what's the point? It's like going to a strip club where they all have to wear those little pasties over the nipples. Bad, bad, bad beer."
"Among light beers, this is no worse than average, and perhaps a bit better, but then, this is a low standard to start with. Overall, the flavor profile seemed true to the standard Heineken lager, only watered-down. I suspect you could achieve the same effect by letting a couple of ice cubes melt in a glass of Heineken. Neither offensive nor enjoyable. Just wet."
"D = Never again, at least not from this ripoff delivery system."
"It's drinkable, smooth and crisp. I think that's what the brewers were going for."
"drinkability takes a severe hit with the smell and taste being rank but I'm sure brewery fresh and cold as hell wouldn't be oh so bad"
"Mouthfeel / Drinkability: The mouthfeel of the beer is light excuse me its watery. The carbonation is active but not stinging. This beer is a throw back beer but not in a good way. Beer for people who dont like beer?"
"Ok people, read the label, This is a LIGHT BEER! Would you complain of a double IPA not having enough malt? Would you downgrade a wheat beer for not using enough hops? Of all the light beers out there this is one of the best. Although I rarely drink light beers, I think it's only fair to judge them for what they are. This tastes pretty much like regular Heineken, but with less taste. Big surprise. But it's very drinkable and has a lot more taste than most light beers other than maybe Sam Adams light and Amstel light. For a 99 calorie beer, I think it's very well done."
"D: I'd rather drink something else that's light rather than this one. It just didn't spark with me."
"The feel of this beer is a lot light any light beer with its easy drinking but light on the flavor that is a great beer. If light beer is what you're into then this would be a good choice."
"D- Not really, I finished my can because I was parched and needed some liquid but I would not willingly buy this for myself, or bring it to a party. I need to try a heineken in amsterdam to see if there is a difference, because I get the feeling they just send the U.S. the dregs of the heineken line-up."
"Well it has one saving quality. its pretty easy going down. That is about all that makes this beer still exist. It smells and tastes like a skunky nightmare. This is the antithesis of a good beer. A very subtle malt and hop character, but honestly i dont get anything from this beer. I wonder who goes out and purchases this beer to keep in their home. I wouldn't want to be their friend, and you shouldn't either. It is really heineken light, and i mean heineken is light and terrible to begin with. Why make it worse. This is the most terrible eurotrash macro i have come across."
"A pale yellow pour with a thin fizzy white head,lots of carbonation. Aroma of light floral hops,corn,skunk weed. Flavor is very light,some corn a dash of that skunk,some sweetness,rice maybe. Crisp clean mouthfeel and finish,drinkable but nothing special in any way"
"D- Obviously made to be a session beer, that is supposed to be a ""quality light lager."" It is what it is. Like most people on here I would prefer to be drinking something ""more refined"" or whatnot, but this is a slightly above average light lager. For what it's going for, can't complain."
"This light beer pours a faint shade of yellow, is crystal clear and has only a bit of head that dissipates quickly down to a thin ring. Nose is ricey, low on any malt aroma and only slightly hinting at hops. Taste is disappointing in comparison to ""regular"" Heineken and they can officially drop the term Premium. Unfortunately the taste buts this beer down with the macro light beers and this beer has an unusual off-taste that reminds me of stale burnt rice. Body is, well, light and the carbonation is good but overall I would not drink this beer again."
"D - This actually tasted like a lighter version of regular Heineken. For a light lager it wasn't too bad."
"Again, this has slid a long way in my book, but still a beer I can enjoy when none of the good stuff is available."
"One of the most bland beers I've ever had."
"This is not what beer is supposed to taste like. it's a shame that so many think it is. This is headache material, and hardly merits scrutiny. Time to invite some macro fans over to finish it off..."
"I'm a fan of the regular Heineken and I gotta say this brew let me down. Pale color and a quickly dissipating head set this beer off to a bad start and the smell is nothing spectacular. Had about three of these before I gave the rest away. Better luck just sticking to the real thing here. Won't be buying another case of this brew any time soon."
"D 3.0 - I like the taste more than expected, but to low on ABV to make it worth it for me to pursue...."
"""lighter in taste""... oy, that's a marketing ploy? Head settles to a pencil-thin mustache, ulike the lager... pingish aroma, eys--but softer, more subtle tha the original... actually a benefit when considering it offensive effect... a softer, less aggressive action early, with the same faux finish late... again, actually more beneficial to the drinker... a bit more straight in its flavor profile, with nothing out of line... even less on the offensive than the original... thins to water at the finish... how to spin this politely... at a hot summer party, this beer would work... I still wouldn't want it, though..."
"No much going on - nuttin' really offensive either. This could make for a lawnmower session beer, but that's about it."
"Drinkability suffers due to the lack of taste, and whatever taste is there is bad. Stay away from this one."
"1.5/5"
"Skunky Heineken aroma. Yellow beer, fizzy head. Same sweet rice/malt flavor with some saaz flavors. I gave this a 2.5 in the flavor department, because this is possibly the only light beer that tastes just like its big brother, so its got that going for it."
"I saw a bumper sticker here in Marin that said: ""don't eat yellow snow, don't drink yellow beer"" -words to live by!"
"This Heineken Light out of the bottle poured an unimpressive light yellow with very little head. The aroma is of a slight graininess and maybe some hops but not a lot. The usual green bottle skunky aroma was also in effect. Taste wise there was nothing redeemable about this beer. My first impression was of a grainy wet cardboard taste, but not in a good way. The beer did end rather dry without much fuss though. Drinkability wise while I could drink a few of these I would wonder why anyone would want to."
"This is the light version of their famous flagship beer. Out of a bottle it was a pale yellow color with a white head. Poor retention and poor lacing. The aroma was standard macro lager with some metallic hints and a little mustiness. The flavors were similar with a strong aftertaste of corn mash. The body was light and watery with an over-carbonated mouthfeel. Basically, this one just sucked on each level. It's one saving grace is that it is in fact easy to drink as lights tend to be but why you would have one let alone multiples I don't know."
"drinkability: very easy and smooth when you need a light try this"
"Drinkability is bad. I will never try this or anything with the Heineken label again."
"D: Drinkability was better then expected and had no problem finishing. Honestly not that bad overall, and certainly didn't come off as a light beer."
"Not really unpleasant, Heineken Light is just not that tasty. It is a good example of a diet beer and has only a shadow of the flavor and drinkability of Heineken."
"D_not a bad brew as there are no real off flavours, but really not much going on here. I would rather have a mild or a bitter."
"I'll only drink this when I have too, and again to me it's a better choice than Bud  Coors light."
"Drink: well, it's kinda like beer soda. Pardon me, it's just like beer soda. I could, and actually have, pound a twelver in 3-4 hours, which is what you have to do to catch a buzz. I believe I'm done with this stuff."
"In a nutshell this is nothing more than watered down Heineken. Aroma is an extremely weak version of the regular, appearance is similar except slightly more pale with horrible carbonation and no head or lacing. Mouthfeel is thin and watery, flavor is closer to water than beer, there is a trace of the trademark euro lager flavor but very weak. I knew this would be a bad beer but not this bad. I really like Heineken but this is sad."
"This is a decent macro. If I am at a bar and I want to pound something, Id prefer this beer to bud light. It has a decent aroma compared to heineken. It has a pale yellow color. Good flavor for a macro light beer. Its drinkability is comparable to water. A good beer for getting wasted on."
"D: I wouldn't go out and buy it. If it has to be Heineken I drink, make it a regular please."
"D: Honestly, I have no problems drinking this, and I'd probably take this over Heineken regular. But to the beer fan, there is really nothing in terms of flavour profile to make me come back. Good for what it is, but I'm not going to buy this again with the multitude of brews on the market in SoCal."
"Another mass-produced light beer dud. Just as perfection is a rarity here, a complete failure is tough to achieve too. If you can find flavor here, you can swallow it down. Not horrific, but close."
"Overall - Hard to get past the skunkiness, not impressed."
"They were giving away samples at some bar (naturally the sample giver was a hot chick) to promote their Heiney Lite special. I've should've known this beer would suck when the ""in"" crowd said it was great. Very light, clearish yellow body with little head. A grassy, medicinal, and very WEAK aroma passes for the smell. Not much of anything in the taste except some minor hop bitterness on the back to let you know you're drinking a beer, not a diet soda (then again, soda has actual flavor in it). Very slick and watery, with no drinkability - if its carbs and fat grams you're watching, save the ""import price"" money and get a Mich Ultra."
"D: Not flavorful at all, goes down easily because of the lack of substance, not filling at all, no kick, there are a lot of better light beers out there."
"Drinkability - This is pretty bland, even by macro-light standards. Not worth paying a premium for this ""premium."""
"Like most beers in this category. Heineken does a better job on marketing than brewing. This is a super-light weight coming in at just one tenth above gas station beer. Not much of an aroma. Some bitter hops and grainy yeasts as well. The taste is no different. Watery body and soda pop like carbonation. I can't beleive what this sells for at the store."
"Not as overcarbonated as lots of macro beers tend to be. Drinkable as far as the palate, but not desirable in any way."
"Tasted 1/6/08"
"This tastes a lot litke the regular just less of it. Appearance pale yellow in color with one finger head that disapeared very quickly. Smell not much faint hop thats about it. Taste very watery way a little hop presence in the finish and the aftertaste was a bit skunky. Mouthfeel very thin with high carbonation. Drinkability if you have no other choice."
"Avoid."
"If I'm in need of a thirst quenching and nothing else, I'll stick with water or iced tea. If my thirst quenching has to be beer, I will look for a witbier or a hefe. If I'm looking to keep weight off, I will moderate the amount of beer I drink but stick to real beer. There seems to be no real point to consuming this."
"Very light yellow with a quick fading bright white head. SMell is of light watery malt. Fairly thin, with a corn like taste as well. Very little taste and aftertaste, but this is what you expect of a light beer, and overall, besides being watered down, the flavor is perhaps better than regular heineken."
"pours a very pale straw color with alot of skunkiness to the nose, that and water thats about it. it really doens't even look like beer, but the skunkiness is profound enough to tell otherwise. the taste or lack there of is basically water water water then followed by a little alcohol and skunkiness, then more water. mouthfeel is weak. the drinkability is highest part about this beer, oddly only cause it is so weak of a beer, i could probably dominate 40 of these before i feel it, scary thought."
"This beer is just watered down Heineken. I wouldn't even use this for cooking or beer batter. Get real Heineken or a Stella instead. Don't fall for the marketing jive."
"Wow this beer is terrible. Poured into a Sam Adams pint glass it pours a very pale yellow with only a slight fading head. There is almost no smell or taste. A very slight corny taste with a touch of skunky pilsner-like hops. The mouthfeel is much like an american macro lager, but a bit wimpy. I can't believe someone left 5 of these in my fridge..."
"This beer for me was essentially Heineken with less a bit less taste. Very light on the color and aroma. Color was pale straw yellow with a faint hint of hops in the aroma. The body was weak, typical of Heineken, and the Light had even less of a finish to it. On the positive note, I think this was pretty close taste wise for me to full out Heineken so if they were going for that they got it right. So if you like Heineken, but for some reason crave a light beer experience, this should work for you."
"Hazy very light straw color. Head reduces but hangs around a little while. Not much smell, what I detect is wet cardboard. Taste is like taking one part macro lager and adding 5 parts or so mineral water, nothing to detect really. It was free, never had this before and never will again. There is however no skunkiness or sulfur to deal with, if it mattered that would be a good thing."
"It's actually very drinkable. In fact if I was really thirsty I would happily drop one of these in a few big gulps."
"Pours a clean, pale yellow color, with a white head. In the aroma, sweet and small skunky malt. In the taste, small sweet malt, but quite bland. A small bite, but mostly smooth mouthfeel, with a clean, small dry aftertaste. Kind of skunky, but a clean, small sweet malt."
"This is one overhyped beer. It pours a golden yellow with a short white head that is pretty thin. It smells really faint. Nothing to it really. It has an aroma of some light malt and maybe some hops but I can't detect anything else. It tastes the same. Light in taste of light grains and some hops but not much of either. It has a nice mouthfeel though and it is pretty drinkable as it is pretty low in alcohol content and taste. Not really a good beer and I would not recommend it at all."
"I am a big fan of this beer. I have never really liked Heineken too much. A little too many hops and skunky taste for me. However, Heineken Light has that great smoothness and mouthfeel of Heineken, without the skunk taste. I definitely hitthis drink up at any Heineken event from now on."
"When I first drank this beer I went in expecting it to taste absolutely horrible. Well...half right. I don't really like Heineken to begin with. Hence it was not a stretch to really care too much about this beer either. However, if you like this beer, then you might actually like it. If fizzy light beer is your thing, this is actually not a bad choice."
"Okay, I have to admit, I do like the commercials. But the beer, on the other hand, exactly what youd expect. Not much of anything. Eerily similar to that Becks premier light. Light and fizzy. No smell. Damn near no taste either. Just as much like club soda or tonic water as it is beer. If your looking for low-carb or low-alcohol, try something like michelob ultra, aspen edge, or even old milwaukee n-a."
"After reading the previous reviews on this beer it's obvious to me how many rookie beer drinkers we have registered here. This beer is obviously a EUROPEAN LIGHT beer. Unlike most of the fake mass produced American beers with light on the label and 4-5% Alc. European beers are also light on alcohol. This one is perfect for what it is brewed for. Not everyone is an alky that drinks to get drunk. I love this beer as I can drink several and enjoy them without waking up dying with a hangover. If your out to get drunk then by all means this is not your beer. If your looking for a great tasting easy to drink light beer that won't bloat you or scramble your brain, then this is the beer. I love it and I've drank more beers in more countries than the average American. I've also drank more beer than some small countries. Rather than read some punks review how about try it yourself and rate it honestly for what it is and not what you want it to be. Word!"
"overall, this beer is meant to be consumed out by the pool on a hot summer day, and with its low abv its good for that, but if im going for a macro, ill look elsewhere"
"that's the best I can do here."
"Someone left a few in my fridge so I figured I'd review it. I'm going back onto my,"don't drink and review macro's"" ban!!!"
"Could drink a serious amount of these if you were thirsty, very light to say the least"
"D= after drinking it all day and night, I was actually upset when they ran out-- definite hot-weather lightweight session beer."
"Pours a very pale color with a very thin head (almost nothing there). Aroma is slightly skunk with the familiarity of Heineken (except supposedly lighter). Taste is very, very light and almost bland. Almost nothing there to taste, hence the typical light lager. Not a bad effort but definitely not something I'd be buying again. I just wanted to try mainly."
"Drinkability- If you have limited options it is at least worth a try."
"I went into the first one with eager anticipation...and then left it, and the rest of the six, untouched for over a month in the fridge. THe beer pours with virtually no head....no retention....little sweet corn nose....THE MOST WATERED DOWN OVERPRICED BEER EVER! I'd love to give details...but water and corn kinda sums it up! Hints...and I mean HINTS of pale malt....a grainy finish and aftertaste filled by pure swill adjuncts lingering like flies on a dead carp. This beer is terrible....I'd rather drink Falls City for 4.99 a 12 ...same beer only you save 8 bucks! There is NO such thing as a great light beer....maybe Mar's....but how anyone would drink this over Miller Lite is mindboggling! Terrible beer!"
"This is just slightly better than Beck's Premier Light, which is to say lousy. This beer is roughly 92% beer-flavor-free. With virtually no beer aroma or flavor, all that remains is a light bit of grain smell, and fairly abundant skunky aroma and flavor. This beer is very light in color, as it is just faintly yellow. To describe it with another comparison; this beer is significantly worse than its original."
"God, I can not believe that my 1st review on Beer Advocate is this, but oh well. It is ok, not bad and not good. My father drinks it so while I was home I had one. Taste better that some light beers. If given a choice of Heineken Light and another light beer I would choose this. It can be had for 11$ for a 12 pack. (WV)"
"...which brings us to why I chose this beer in the first place. Well, this is my 100th review, and after drinking all those brews, I wanted something lighter in calories and tasting like water. Yeah, right! Anyone watching their chick-flick ads knows who this is targeted to. There's nothing ""premium"" about this except the price tag."
"I got it cause it was 1 dollar for a single."
"D: I know, I know. But it was there and I have to review every beer I drink. Not that this beer is undrinkable, I'm sure I could knock quite a few back. Its just not very good and lacks and real character."
"Heineken took a long time to finally introduce a light beer and this product, like many other lights, is nothing more than a watery version of the original. I have never been very fond of regular Heineken, so I am even less fond of Heineken Light. I didnt expect much going in and my expectations were met when I gave this beer a try. This product is very light and offers little taste. It also has the same skunky attributes commonly associated with the parent beer. The taste of corn/cereal grains and skunky hops dominate and the beer is a little too sweet. If I had to write down a list of taste characteristics before I had ever tried this beer, my predictions would have been very accurate. It is basically a glass of watered- down Heineken. It has a clean, crisp look and taste, but there is little else positive to say about this product."
"The taste is not awful, in fact it's not much of anything. A little bready, a little sour, but nothing egregious. If anything it's got a less skunky taste than a regular Heiny. Mouthfeel is still weak, but really you can drink several of these without even realizing it. It's one of the better ""light"" beers on the market. But that's not saying too much, I guess."
"I wouldnt have again.It is nasty and not worth to have again."
"The scores may be the same, but I feel a need to pick a winner of MacSmack XIII. Heineken Premium Light Lager is the winner for a fair reason and for an unfair reason. The first is that the head is brighter and slightly more attractive. The second is that it tastes (and probably is) slightly fresher. I take the blame for PBR Light's less than perfectly fresh state. However, in my defense, if the breweries would date their bottles, it wouldn't have happened. Anyone looking for a drinkable light lager should give both of these beers a look."
"Overall impression: Meh. Not horrible, but I don't understand why this beer exists in the first place."
"I had this beer on the golf course , around sunset. I don't know what it looks like because i had it in a bottle , but i think i can guess. The smell was like a lighter heiny , some light grains , bit of haller hop , some alcohol , and the signature skunk. Taste was of mild graint malt mixed with the regular heiniken taste , but lighter. Bitterness seemed a bit more pronounced in the finish. Overall , it had a more refreshing quality , but it was very thin a i would not buy it. It did however get the job done , and as almost any beer would , it made my evening a little bit better."
"Not a great beer, but a good alternative to other flavorless or overly adjuncted light beers out there."
"From the 12 oz bottle into the pint glass, pours a light golden color with few bubbles beneath a thin white head that fades rapidly leaving only a tiny bit of lacing. Nose is of faint citrus and is faintly sweet. Taste is malty up front with a dry malty finish. Nothing to write home about here. Mouth is watery, bubbly, clean, and overall satisfying. Drinkability is OK; this is a decent light Euro lager, but theres little point to it. Avoid."
"Pours a pale straw with a tiny head that fizzles out to nothing regardless of the fact that there is decent carbonation present. Smells slightly sulphury, but definately not skunked. Some grain. Faint. Slight malt and apple cider notes in the nose. Flavor is malty with bready and slightly nutty flavors. I pick up a bit of tea-like hops in there as well. All of that said, this is of course watered down. Gets a touch boozy when warmer. Mouthfeel is light and stings the tongue with bubbles. Refreshing AND it has some flavor. Not bad."
"Had this for the first time tonight. Pale, yellow look with an ok head. A malty kind of smell; reminded me of a pilsner. Tasted malty at first but then tasted more like a macro beer. A light mouthfeel; tasted like all the other light beers (Coors light, Millier lite, etc.) Pretty drinkable beer; could drink it all night if you wanted to (my friends seemed to enjoy it). But, I would stick to the domestic light beers; they taste the same and don't cost as much."
"Dnot terrible, In fact, it goes down pretty easily and might be good for yard work or by the pool."
"For a light beer, it's not bad.. For a beer, it's for girls in black dresses in clubs."
"Very light to the tongue and bone dry, yet very smooth. Grains and hops are present from begining to end. Finishs dry. A weird smoothness about this one. I just hope that this atrocity to beer will not be at any of the parties I go too."
"D - Just OK, overall bland and not much to want to come back to."
"Cheers."
"D: Drain-pour for me. Not quite as bad as Ed's Chili Beer, but bad enough to never want another."
"I won't buy again."
"This needs to go away fast. Heineken drinkers aren't crying out for anything lighter, and Amstel Light drinkers aren't looking for anything Heineken-ier."
"This was a lot better than I thought it would be, but it still wasn't worth it. Inoffensive, if nothing else."
"I had this one with a group of guys following a round of golf. It wouldnt have been my choice, but it was all that was being served. It serves up about what is expected from a light beer. It sports a pale straw color with a fizzy head. The aroma is almost nonexistent, with only a faint whiff of grassiness and hops. Theres virtually no flavor, and the beer is exceptionally dry. Watery body and empty finish. This beer is simply forgettable."
"When I popped the cap, I wasn't expecting much. It poured yellow as yellow can be, but had very good head retention, especially for a light lager! The smell was all malt and grain, but not offensive. The taste is the high part of this beer. I honestly think it is a more refined, cleaner version of the Heineken Lager. It actually tastes better than their trademark beer! Bottle is bit cooler too. Mouthfeel is very surprising for a light beer; in fact too good...something has got to be going on here...Drinkability you ask? Probably the best example of a light lager I've had yet. Props to Heineken. It doesn't have the hop strain that gets skunked, a different- not as stale tasting A-strain yeast, and just better all around than their other offering."
"It was as drinkable as below-average tap water - watered-down more than most of its style. I can't see the point of drinking this, except if it is someone who does not like beer, but wants to order a beer for social reasons. If you like beer - don't bother..."
"Someone brought these to a party recently. At the end of the night (after all the ""good"" beers were gone) I decided to give it a try. Pleasantly surprised. I'm not a big fan of Heineken anyway; but this wasn't too bad. It had a nice color (pale yellow) in the glass and a rich head that seemed to last forever. Not much in the smell department (I was expecting ""skunk"" and got none of that) but the taste was surprisingly good (mild, of course, since this is a Heineken afterall). Reminded me of a ""beer flavored beverage," instead of real beer itself. But it was almost as good as Amstel, though not as true to traditional flavor as Beck's Premier Light. Still, not a bad party beer--and the lower ABV means you can drink more of them."
"Presentation: Packaged in a tall, narrow green glass bottle, which is taller and thinner than the standard Heineken bottle. Perhaps this is a bit of visual psychology for the weight-conscious. Served in a Pilsener glass."
"Heineken Premium Light Lager pours a golden color with a thick white head from a green twelve ounce bottle. The aroma is skunky and corn dominated. Very light flavor, corn toward the end. Nothing to particularly recommend this over any other light swill."
"not recommended"
"Please, do yourself a favor and don't even try this."
"Sinkability  This was a very sinkable beer."
"Okay here we go a brew that is a light version of Heine is that possible well let's just say I'm not sure. Appears a light golden pale hue with a bright white head leaves behind nice scattered lacing. Aroma has more skunky Euro hops sorry folks those are the facts on this beer they promote a nice skuny grassy hop character with a minimal citrus profile just enjoy and now your enjoying something high end, right? Taste has lighter crisp version of Heineken I could see this going over here with crisp hop character it finishes a tad bitter for American flavor but it's actually not that bad grassy citrus hop profile with light creamy biscuit malt tones go figure. Mouthfeel as the label reveals it's light bodied higher artificial carbonation not the end of the world. Drinkability well not that bad I could crave this in another life possibly, but once again pretty unoffensive what can I say."
"Taste is very clean, very crisp with a thin mouthfeel. Almost like drinking grain flavored water. Virtually no lingering after taste. I suppose the Heineken drinker who is looking for something light would like this. This bottle was left at my house, and I can't see myself ever buying it as I like fuller flavored beers. But if someone is looking for a brew that is clean and crisp, leaves no lingering taste on the palate, then this is probably it."
"Avoid."
"Beermail me for the punchline if you have never heard that one."
"I feel this beer is only for Heineken fans."
"Overall a waste of 10 bucks --"
"A buddy of mine stopped by with a sixer of this so I figured I would give it a shot. Not much smell or taste to it. Very bland. A bit corny and skunky...kinda like bad city water in some places I've been. Too carbonated for my liking. I could only finish one and won't be having another. If I want a light beer I'll grab a SA light instead."
"I enjoy the full version of Heineken but the light just isn't all that good. If you are into a watered down beer, this may be the thing for you. I would say that it is a lot like a Coors Light. They have some really good commercials on TV but I did not like my sample that I tatsed at the World Beer Festival in Raleigh, NC April 2006. If you like Heineken, stick with the regular and skip the premium light."
"Doesn't taste like Heineken. Fairly bland lager taste. The mouthfeel is richer than most light beers I have tried. I certainly wouldn't look for if, but it is about on par with Miller Lite, if you are out there with a very limited selection of watery, bland beers. Appearance is less than average, the ubiquitous yellow lager color, small head that fades quickly, little smell, almost no lacing. I would like to try one without the cryogenically frosted beer mug I was given, but I'm sure the flavor would not be that much better in a non-frosted glass. Ok for a session if you are counting calories and there is nothing memorable to tempt you with."
"Had this from some family who came with it. Pours increadibly light colored and a small fizzy head that really fades quickly. Not really too carbonated. Smell has that floral medicinal quality I associate with regular Heineken but its fainter. Taste is also similar but fainter. Malt is really lacking and there is no sweetness or carbonation to give this beer life. Finish has a slight hoppiness but that's about it. Unfortunate that some people buy this."
"There. I tried it. No thanks. On the rare occasion that Im in the mood for a light beer, I will NOT be picking up anymore of this. There are far better light beers out there, most of which cost less too."
"Pours pale straw with crystal clarity. Dense, foamy head of two and a half fingers shows good retention and leaves nice sticky lacing. Light aroma of cereal adjuncts and pale malt, but skunked hops dominate. The taste is sweet and corny with a pale malt flavor trying to pull through. A pleasently mild euro hop flavor comes through in the aftertaste, but this overcompensation for a lack of malt flavor puts the flavor out of balance. Smooth, light body with even carbonation. That distinctive ""skunk"" taste is the only real character in this beer, so the drinkability is good if you're fond of that light-struck flavor."
"Overall...a marco larger aimed at the college crowd who think the green bottle is cool....i'll pass unless it is free."
"The taste is more of the same, albeit to a lesser degree. It's really remarkable what they (Heineken's crack team of brewers) have done here when you think about it: they spent two decades extracting every last taste molecule out of regular Heineken. I wouldn't have thought it would take that long, but I do congratulate them on the thoroughness of their acheivement."
"I'd rather drink this than regular Heineken or any other light beer on the market. But since I have come to terms with my beer gut, I will stick to the good stuff."
"just an average drinkable beer. very very light, crisp taste. however you can taste that it is a quality made light beer. this sint a bud light we are talking about here. deep, complex taste no, cheap crap no. again would reccomend for dieters mainly."
"What gives? What will it take? For a Major Brewer to come up with a Light Lager That really really tastes like real BEER!"
"I am not sure if it is lighter in color than regular Heineken because I had it in a bottle. It is bland with a very watery almost club soda type mouthfeel. I would call this a ""n/h"" beer for non-hopped. There would be no suprise to find out that they removed the hop flavor from this beer after brewing in the way non-alcoholic beers are made. Yet this is one of the few ""light"" beers that tastes very close to its non-light offering. A true swill nonetheless."
"-SS"
"I've had better import light lagers. I've had worse, too. Pours out to a medium yellow color with a short lived head of foam. Minor notes of lace. Aromas of light malt and mild hops, some cereal notes. Taste was fair; some sweet malt and grain, touches of watery hops. Mouthfeel is mediocre; not to be confused with thirst-quenching. Drinkability is fair. Possibly the best pick at a boring bar, but nothing special."
"Cheers!"
"Well there's not much that wasn't expected here. Heineken light in the green bottle is light-struck (""skunked"") just like the regular version. It pretty much tastes like regular Heineken that's been watered-down, yet it still retains most of the alcohol. Gone are the nice, malts and herbal hops. It is, however, very refreshing. Very refreshing! - kind of like water. And, it has enough hop flavor and bitterness that it tastes much more like ""beer"" than the American ""light"" beers. There are better light beers available (Sam Adam's, for example), but in comparison to the likes of Bud Light, Miller Lite, Amstel Light, and Corona Light I'd take this one."
"Among light beers, this is no worse than average, and perhaps a bit better, but then, this is a low standard to start with. Overall, the flavor profile seemed true to the standard Heineken lager, only watered-down. I suspect you could achieve the same effect by letting a couple of ice cubes melt in a glass of Heineken. Neither offensive nor enjoyable. Just wet."
"D- A watery beer, this is a beer for people that really don't want to drink beer or think that drinking regular beer will make them fat ... its not all of the fast food and junk food that made them fat right? When will this low-carb beer fad die a quick death?"
"Poured a pale yellow color with modest white head. Smell is so minimal as to be virtually non-existent. Taste is also so very light as to be almost nothing. Mouth fell is nothing. This beer is almost completely tasteless. At least there is nothing offensive about it."
"Ehhh. Not recommended."
"That being said, this just makes Heineken even worse. I just despise it."
"Well, the Heineken Light finished well with the baked catfish after three bottles of them. I know it will be well received this summer by the thirsty masses in the Hamptons, the Cape, and Mystic as the marketing effort gets going."
"Overall, better than i thought, but not good. But as a financial aspect, i think they should have made this years ago as i'm sure they will make millions. But as for the beer, i'll pass."
"For real beer this isn't good, but for a light beer this is a great deal better than anything made in the USA. It won't make you throw out your Pilsner but if you had no other choice except light beer this would be the one I would pick. I can't trash this it is far better than Bud Light or Michelob Ultra."
"I may be one of the first in Maine to try Heineken Light, as I was told that it isn't supposed to be released (retail) until April 1. But I saw a case on the beer delivery truck, and talked the store owner into getting it for me. Bad idea. Tastes a lot like Becks Light - a good hoppiness but a chemical aftertaste. The aroma makes one think that they used artificial hop flavoring ; artificial."
"Side note: The women I was with absolutely loved this, so it will probably be a hit money wise. Beer wise, it is a step back. Was this really necessary? Also, the bottle is a little different than the regular Heineken. Its not as squat and fat, but a little more slender and hipper. I can see where the packaging would appeal to women and hipster/trendy folk."
"I'm sure that Heineken Light will thrill plenty of college kids and I'm sure its light nature allows plenty of trips to the fridge, but if you're a beer drinker, beware."
"In short, this beer doesn't add anything to the light macro lager field. It had the same slightly metallic, chemical taste of Coors Light--it tastes more like Coors Light than like Bud Light or Miller Lite, which provides a frame of reference. It doesn't taste much like Heineken. I give 'em credit for spelling out ""light"" rather than using ""lite."" So drinking this beer promotes literacy, but that's about it."
"Classic Heineken skunkiness followed by a watery, thin mouthfeel and a bland aftertaste. Woo-hoo! Sure am glad they bothered to make this beer. That's sarcasm, folks. Maybe this would be a halfway decent lawnmower beer if it wasn't a ""light"" beer and had some oomph behind it, but alas...another bad import in GREEN GLASS."
