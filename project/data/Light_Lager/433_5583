3,18.1,3,3,3,3,3,"Poured a 2" white head. Very light clear straw yellow color. Smells like grass and some sort of mild hops. Very mild taste of corn with a mild acidic zing to the finish.

1.63,-35.8,2,1.5,1.5,1.5,2,"Overall: Not much of a difference between the Golden and the Light, save the gas and the simplicity of its taste profile; drinkable in vast quantities, but preferably in pong/asshole/regatta/flipcup engagements...","dacrza1","Nov 12, 2010"
2.4,-5.5,3,3,2,3,2,"I decided to try a calibration beforehand and drank a regular CANadian before having its Light version. My pour created a fluffy two fingers' worth of bone-white head with low retention. It fizzled and bubbled with CO2, but ultimately fell harder than a drunken sod in the dark on Sunday morning. The color was a lighter, paler yellow than its leaded counterpart. Nose was pretty much the same - a sweetish, cereal-laden lagerish smell that I have grown accustomed to. Boooring! Mouthfeel was actually fuller, more effervescent than regular, but the taste was definitely lessened by whatever process is used to create a light version of a beer. This was almost bland and watery, like a broken pencil - pointless. Ho freakin' hum! The finish was equally snooze-worthy.","woodychandler","Apr 15, 2010"
2.6,2.4,2.5,2.5,2,2.5,4,"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a very pale yellow color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is very mild, slight hints of corn. Taste is crisp, basically flavorless, not really getting much of anything here. Feels watery in the mouth and is very drinkable due to it's lightness. Overall there is not much to this beer at all.","tone77","Feb 21, 2010"

SInce I am trying to lose weight I have been drinking more and more light beers and this one is actually pretty good as far as light beers go. The pour tends to be more golden yellow with a lot of foamy white head and excitable carbonation. The aroma is of barley, malts and a little grass. The mouthfeel is a tad heavier than many lights and in the medium range. The taste is has a nice balance of malts and a chaser of hops but not overpowering.","puboflyons","Aug 28, 2009"

Flavor is quite light ( as to be expected) a bit of pale malt,some other dry grain,a bit of noticable hops,smooth drinker,with little to no aftertaste,not bad for a light beer, I would buy this again if I were into the light beer thing.","WakeandBake","Apr 10, 2009"

3,18.1,3,3,3,3,3,"Pours a typical light yellow color with a decent amount of foam. Aroma is pretty bland at first though I detect hints of corn adjunct and some sweetness. Taste is much of the same, sweet and yet some bitterness on the tongue. Nothing too impressive or offensive at the same time. Tastes like Molson Canadian, except lighter of course. I would give it a fair rating.","Brad007","Aug 17, 2007"
2.23,-12.2,2.5,2,2.5,2,2,"D: Not very tasty, goes down ok, not filling at all, which isn’t surprising. There isn’t anything about this beer that would make me want to buy it.

2.93,15.4,3,2.5,3,2.5,3.5,"Molson delivers a pretty basic light lager in their Canadian Light. The golden body is a little bit darker than most, which is nice, and the head is a creamy bright white but it dissipates quickly as expected. The nose offers a bit of yeasty fruitiness and some sweet malt along with some floral hops - nice! In the mouth it offers a dextrinous medium-light body and a gently zesty carbonation. The malt is just slightly grainy; and it leans towards sweetness but never really gets there. It's surprisingly rich for a light beer, and actually offers more flavor than some of the standard price-point beers out there. The balance is nice, and the transition is smooth from malt into lingering floral and spicy hops amidst a mild bitterness in the finish. Hmmmm... actually pretty good in comparison to most light beers. Well done!","NeroFiddled","Aug 13, 2006"
2.01,-20.9,3,2,2,1.5,2,"MacSmack VII is a classic case of the relative merits of a lack of flavor (this beer) versus more, but worse flavor (its competitor).

2.86,12.6,3,2,3,4,3,"Pours a very pale straw hue, with excellent clarity. The bubbly white head reaches only one finger in height, but holds well. Little to no lacing. Faint grain adjunct smell, mostly clean. The taste is equally bland; some grain adjuncts and slight hop bite that leaves a bitter aftertaste worth mentioning. Thin body and high carbonation make up a crisp mouthfeel. The flavor is not bad for a light lager, and it is fairly balanced, but its so thin that eventually the alcohol is percived and detracts from its drinkability.","PBRstreetgang","Nov 11, 2005"
1.43,-43.7,2,1.5,1,1.5,2,"Pours a white, five finger-head that vanishes almost instantly leaving no lace. Clear, very pale amber color. No noticeable carbonation and very light bodied. Nose may be a faint sweet hay. Starts with no hops or malts finish is almost like water. Even a bad lawn mower beer. The Canadians can brew a decent light - Keith's but this isn't it. $1.45 for a 340ml from Colonial Spirits Acton, Ma.","jdhilt","Jul 12, 2005"

Very faint malt smells with even fainter hop smells. Picking up some corn and rice smells as well. Taste is OK for a "lite". Some subtle sweet malt with a bit of hops.

It has a smooth taste with a clean, yet dry finish. It has no malt complexity at all, but is low in carbs. The mouthfeel is above average. It is a low bodied beer with good carbonation.
