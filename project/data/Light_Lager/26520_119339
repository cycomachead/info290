I found it nearly tasteless fizzy water with a hop bitterness at the end... which didn't work, because it had nothing to balance it out.  If their goal was to brew a light "American Style" lager that tasted like the ones that the macro guys make, they nailed it.","Jsmick","Aug 30, 2014"

Overall, this beer is certainly best served cold. I had mine slightly warmer and didn't really like it. Had it on the cold side and found it refreshing. This has a definite American Lager flavor to it, so don't expect something similar to what the brewery typically puts out.","jneiswender","Jul 28, 2014"

Moderate bitterness that lingered, slight citrus up front followed by malt and grassy character -- pretty nice. Light-to-medium bodied, carbonation a little on the low side, some dryness. Overall, refreshing and nicely balanced. I liked it and am happy to have the rest of a 12-pack to go through.","DrJay","Jul 25, 2014"

It has some decent big doughy cracker straw like grains, mostly on the taste, hops are a bit on the too light side even for a light lager, the lagering portion also seems a bit off as it has that mild minerality note, not quite like a sulfur or phosphorus, but something there. Doesn't quite seem up to a typical Jack's Abby lager.","jlindros","Jul 06, 2014"

This is basically a "gateway beer" from BMC to craft, but unlike other such beers, this one isn't really trying to push you toward anything else. Hard to find fault with this, and easy to imagine putting away quite a bit of it.","Pahn","Jul 06, 2014"

This is all about being a 12pk pounder. It's a bold decision for them, especially to go to market with volume in a 12pk format. This is a brewery that had still been bottling 500ml exclusively not even a year ago. I think they timed it perfectly though. They seem to be at a point where they can comfortably field the volume as long as demand doesn't soar. The red, white, and blue packaging will surely encourage some impulse buys and make for great display pieces as it goes to market around the Fourth of July. Next up: mix 12 pack? Might not be a bad choice.","ryan1788a5","Jul 05, 2014"
