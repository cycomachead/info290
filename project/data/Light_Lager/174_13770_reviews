"Green bottle, pouring a barely golden clear color with half finger white head. Aroma of skunks, a bit of hay and hops. Flavor followed pretty closely. While this was mostly just water flavor, it had an unpleasant skunk flavor and rather dirty, rough lager finish. Light mouthfeel for sure, but I wouldn't choose this even on the hottest of days."

"Lots of carbonation, super easy to drink beer, not offensive, just nothing going on beyond a faint impression of a light adjunct beer and lots of water. Definitely has a place, its less than 4%, it doesn't taste like shit, its worthy when you need to cleanse the palate, or its super hot, or you want a beer but you have to drive your kid somewhere soon."
"The pour is a faint golden color with a two-finger white head that dies down quickly and there is no lacing to be seen on the glass. The nose is a bit of grainy husks and some light grass. The taste is really off and astringent. My goodness is that bad. Peels over to the feel and is just wrong. Does not taste good and has a horrible feel; this is just a bad beer and I'm glad it's retired."
"Pours an almost competely clear yellow color with a small head. The smell is very faint, maybe a hint of grain. The taste is very light, there is a sweet malt taste with a very little hop bite. The mouthfeel is crisp and clean with a lot of carbonation. Overall there is nothing to stop you from drinking this beer, however, the is really nothing to it either. The faint taste would grade it above other mass produced light beers."
"Sometimes a plain beer is all I want. This one is one of the better ones out there. There is no bad aftertaste...and it has a nice mouthfeel. It actually has an average taste for a mass prodcued beer that isn't trying to break any rules...go for one."
"Pours very light and clear. Not too much in the aroma area. Lots of carbonation. Taste is actually pretty good I think for a Light beer, very drinkable. Does come though as a bit bland in the mouth. Not a bad beer to drink after a hot day working in the yard but that is about it."
"The appearance is ok, with a pale straw yellow color and no real head or lacing. Smell is ok, a bit skunky and a bit of hops coming through. Taste is pretty good, some hops and a bit of sweet malt. The skunkiness is gone. Mouthfeel is too light, but not awful. Drinkability is good."
"Drinkability: Best club soda I've had in quite some time!"
"Doesn't have much of a head to cover the clear, straw yellow color. Light grainy/bitter smell. Flavor has a bit of yeasty grains with a very faint hoppiness. Not the worst malt selection. Light body and very fizzy. I suppose it is well marketed like most of the others. Drink it cold. Drink it very cold."
"Wow - probably the most tasteless ""beer"" I've ever had."
"Again, it is what it is!!!"
"Although very bland, even in comparison to other light beers I've come across, Latrobe's light offering does score for being what it strives to be: a relatively inexpensive, low-calorie, low-carb, light offering... For the more health and weight conscious drinkers out there, this might be a good choice, but if you're looking for flavor and style, just pass this one up."
"Ever had schwepps seltzer water? That's exactly what it tastes like. And mostly what it smells like. On one hand, that means it's no thinner than any other crappy light beer (yes, it earned itself a 1.5 on the mouthfeel category because it's no worse than 5 incredibly well-selling, but awful beverages). But for someone who doesn't care what their beer tastes like so long as it has some measure of alcohol and lets themselves keep their weight down, it serves as an easy to choke down party beverage."
"Why I tried this I will never know, I hate American pale lagers and especially light ones. Virtually no taste, subtlety, or character. Bland. I guess this was an attempt to keep up with the Michelob Ultra's of the world. Only 83 calories. I would rather have a hefeweizen packed with 200 calories than tasteless 83 calorie swill anyday. At first I thought I was actually drinking a no alcohol beer, but I found out it was 3.7 % abv. Avoid."
"The strangest thing, though, is that it just tastes like it was brewed from nothing that normally is used to make beer. I have no idea what substance this was concocted with, but it just doesn't turn out right. Completely unpalatable."
"D - Not very good even for light lagers."
"Drinkability- Very easy to drink and hardly any aftertaste."
"Rock Green Light pours a darker golden color than I would have expected from a green twelve ounce bottle. There is a thick white head that laces the glass as it fades. The aroma is adjunct. Tastes mostly of adjunct, maybe a little hop or malt toward the beginning, but not much."
"I have always been a fan of the ""Rock"" Lager as a refreshing drinking beer with a unique flavor (compared to other mass produced varieties). So I tried one of these lights to see how it held up. Not well. A light golden color with a ridiculous arrangement of gigantic bubbles where a head should be. The bubbles burst away quickly and you see a steady, light carbonation. The aroma is pretty much missing in action, maybe a touch of mustiness. Although the 83 calories is impressive, the taste value took a big hit as well. I don't sense much of the old Rolling Rock flavor here, just a hint of rice, no corn. Very watery, fizzy. I would look elsewhere for a light beer if I really needed one (which I don't)."
"Rerated 3/15/2007: Sharp and clear golden yellow beer with virtually no head. Big cooked starchy, grainy aroma, like a grain silo in the heat of summer. Very thin body, virtually no flavor ... just a bit of vegetable and malted grain. Not much here. Maybe not as bad as my original, but pretty bad. Original rating: Poured stark yellow, extremely still with zero head. Starchy aroma. Literally, this tastes like water with a bit of grass in it. Awful."
"Yes even these super mainstream beers need to be reviewed. Plain yellow body with off white head. Nose is a slight stink that is faint to pick anything up. Enters the mouth and you just keep searching for a distinguishable flavor. So you wait and do get a slight yeasty hue on the end twords the finish. Very crisp overall. Makes a refreshing summer water-like beer style. Good beer for someone who doesnt usually like beer.?"
"D- C'mon, don't do it to yourself. The only reason I had this is because a friend had some and didn't want it and I took one to write this review. Horrible."
"Sample at AleFest Dayton: Still trying to figure out why I wasted a ticket on this. Weak straw color with a minimal white head that dissipates quickly. Next to no lacing. Metallic smell. Light-bodied with hardly any flavor or substance. The finish is watery but is the only place where there is even a suggestion of hops. Worthless."
"Pours a straw yellow color, with a nice thick head, which dissapates ultra fast. Nose is filled with nasty adjuncts, and a bit of veggies. Very thin body, Taste is adjuncts, grain huck, followed by mettalic notes. This beer is not a good example of the light beer style. Just too hard to drink. I don't recommend this one."
"Another leftover from the family gathering. Very pale in color with a thinner head and faint lacing. Aroma is grainy and husky with a bit of sweetness in it as well. Taste is not as watery as most low carb beers but that might not be a good thing here. DMS, cooked veggies, sulfur seems to make up most of the flavor. Still, its watery. A bit of hop extract in the finish. Not quite as boring as some in its style but still not enjoyable."
"Another Green Light please... yeah whatever. If you are extremely thirsty and this is all there is to drink.... still pass! This one is worse than its parent Rolling Rock. Its a bitter skunk of a beer that tastes like its been open in the sun for a day and thrown in the freezer to get cold. It smells kind of bland w/ a egg type smell. I think I may buy another 6 pack of this to use as gifts to my enemies!"
"With that said it was easy to pound one down if I didn't think, or taste it."
"It tastes of artificial, chemical corn to me, looks like garbage pale white beer, smells like watered down budweiser, feels like any uberlight beer, totally undrinkable."
"Overall if think this is the best of the ultra light beers. Aspen Edge and Mich Ultra light gives me a belly ache(water). Not this. I mean come on....who in the hell wants a belly ache from a beer!!??? I mean, what's the point. Yes...a watery beer but....it goes down easiely with just enough flavor. I give it a C-....but that's just me. In my opinion...Miller lite over this."
"There is very little to note about the taste of Rock Green Light, which shouldnt come as a surprise to anyone. The taste features a little bit of graininess, corn meal, and crispness, with a sweet profile that is almost completely devoid of any hop flavor. There is almost no finish at all, and the weak, funky aftertaste of grain with metallic notes lingers for a while after drinking."
"I have recently gone on a low-carb diet and had to limit my consumption of real beer to one night a week. While this stuff isn't great, it helps stave off cravings for good beer."
"One of the few choices at a recent Labor Day party, I decided that Id give it a try. Fizzy yellow color with considerable carbonation and a slight head. Not much aroma at allmaybe a bit of corn and cereal grains, but very faint. No noticeable hop quality in any respect. Its a hollow, watery, unsatisfying beer. This was one very light, very unremarkable experience. Like a lot of light beers, theres nothing particularly bad to say, since theres no notable flavor at all."
"Heavily pushed recently and although I haven't like a single RR I decided to try it anyway. I was somewhat suprised, it was quite tolerable. Light crystaline yellow pour with a hole filled thick head that faded quickly. Smelled like corn on the nose and didn't wreak or smell soured. Barely any taste, perhaps a bit sweet, no notable aftertaste.... somewhat dry. Thin but not too thin. Nothing offensive though. If you're going for negligable calories, this is about as good as you can get."
"D- Very easy to drink, like sparkling water. But who wants to drink that all night?"
"As far as low-carb beers go this one is, better. Much better than Michelob Ultra in fact. Now, there is nothing for taste though, but it is missing the artifical tastes I find in other low-carb light beers. It tastes like it looks. A few ounces of beer added to about 9 ounces of water. It really does taste like a slightly alocholic seltzer water. Past that, it is pretty drinkable, meaning you can drink many of these. If you are an avid drinker, you could easily pound a 12-pack without thinking twice. I find this beer to be great for woman drinkers, because well, they stole most of my 6-pack that I had bought, and well I didn't complain."
"The mouthfeel is thin and watery. Huge carbonation. One of these was plenty to make up my mind."
"Drinkability: The carbonation is about the only thing keeping you from downing the whole bottle in one shot. Yeah sure, its drinkable when youre thirsty, but so is water. Only thing really good I can say about this beer is that its probably the best of the low-carb fad brews, beating out Aspen Edge and Mich. Ultra. but that doesnt really say anything."
"It also doesn't make the Mister throw tantrums."
"I agree pretty much with Riversider. It is a very pale fizzy water without much taste. At least, it got a very smooth mouthfeel to change from stronger beers. I know Rolling Rock is not the best quality products availables on the market, but I still like to have one of them once in a time."
"Fizzy water with a slight hint of a bad beer taste. Nothing like regular Rolling Rock. Not much of a head. Not much of anything. I would not drink this beer again. Rolling Rock failed in their low carb offering. You would be better off with a Diet Coke!"
"Well, this one is a little better than I thought it would be. It pours the expected golden yellow color with a fastly dissipating white head. The smell is nice considering the style of beer. Smells better than a Budweiser, if thats saying much. The initial taste when the beer first hits your palate is impressive, and reminds me much of a german pilsener. This is of course quickly washed away with a watery, fizzy, extra bland flavor. No body whatsoever. Considering my experiences, this must be impossible to avoid when making a low-carb beer. Atleast this one is better than Michelob ultra, Martens, and Beck's Premier Light. Pretty good for a low carb beer, but not much at all in the world's totem pole of beers."
"PS: I didnt finish my bottle. I just couldnt do it hell I needed an IPA to kill the aftertaste."
"Looks clear and lightly straw. High carbonation with a fizzy head that fell remarkibly fast...a lot like 7-up. Aromas are almost non-existent. Faintly of malt, corn, and light strikeness. Taste is just there. It tastes like a watered down Bud Light, but without the metalic taste. Finish is very clean and crisp. Aftertaste is nill. Body and mouthfeel is the same as alka-selzer. A very drinkable beer in the same way that carbonated water is. I'm not certain that there is even any alcohol in it."
"all in all, to me its the best of the low carb stuff out there and second best light beer."
"poured a very pale amber color with white head. Smell is minimal and slightly sweet. There is very little taste , but at least its not offensive. Mouthfeel is virtually not there. The perfect beer to drink if you are thirsty but there's no water available"
"Rock Green Light is proof of the mind control that is perpetrated on the populous by the fad diet crowd. It is amazing that Latrobe sells quite a bit of this stuff - I see stacks of it in every store I enter."
"I guess this is supposed to be a lawnmower beer for those people watching their carbs. Poured out to a weak yellow color with medium high carbonation and no head to speak of as it fizzed away before I got a chance to take a good look at it. No smell. Really, I didn't smell a thing. Maybe water. Taste was similar, with a touch of hops. Finished like seltzer water. I don't get this beer. I guess it'd be refreshing for some. Me, I found it one sided and kind of boring. Good for those on the atkins though. I must say, if the world was filled with only low carb beers, this would probably be my choice. Still, that's a dreaded day I hope we never come to."
"I do not like Michelob Ultra. I do not like Rolling Rock Green Light. I will not drink them (anymore) on a flight. I will not drink them (anymore) while flying a kite. I will not drink them (anymore) day or night."
"Whatever it is, it would probably be drinkable ice cold on a really hot day with the air conditioner out and nothing else available."
"Not good! this beer is mostly flavorless. I do detect a hint of limey-skunk aftertaste. while is isnt as bad as corona, it has a distinct unpleasent aroma and aftertaste. As far as low carb beers go this isnt that bad, but it isnt good either, just average."
"On tap at Old Chicago as part of Spring mini tour. I can appreciate a Rolling Rock on occasion, but never understood the need for Rolling Rock light. Now there is a Rolling Rock Light Light?! This tastes like Rolling Rock diluted with water. Still maintains the typical green bottle taste, but not much else. I'll take the extra carbs, and some actual taste next time please."
"Who in the world drinks this stuff more than once? Rock Red Light would be a much more appropriate name and is how I'll think of this beer from now on, if I even think of it at all. If you find yourself considering a purchase, picture a big, blinking red light and for the love of good beer, stop before you do something that you'll regret."
"I do purchase Rolling Rock. It's not outstanding by any means but a change of pace from the Big Three. I can't beleive anything this bad comes from the ""Glass lined tanks of old Latrobe""."
"For a low carbohydrate light beer, Rock Green Light actually has some pleasing characteristics, what little taste is there I find likable."
"Ok...I am embarassed to even write a review on this beer, but if it saves one person from spending their money on it than I have done my job. Have you ever tasted what you would call a ""watered down beer?""...well, that phrase is never more true than with Rolling Rock Green Light. It taste like sparkling water. No head...no smell...no taste...no color...nothing. It would serve to cool the mouth on a hot day and that is about it. Might as well drink water out of the tap."
"I have friends that leave beer in my fridge that I would never think of buying, so I figure that if it is there, I should give it my opinion. The beer pours a pale yellow/gold color, but it is actually darker than I would have expected for a low carb beer. Still, it is not anything to write home about. There is no head to speak of, and not much of a ring around the top of the beer. The nose on this beer is awful. I don't know what it is, but it smells like sweet vomit to me. I am not looking forward to drinking this offering. I'm not a fan of the original, so the low carb option can't be any better. Ok...Here we go...The taste is a watered down sweetness. It tastes better than it smells, but that is not saying much. I don't like it. There is more flavor in this one than in Mich. Ultra, but I would rather the flavor of this beer be absent. The beer is thin and the carbonation is burning on my tounge. I don't know if I can even finish this one, so drinkability shouldn't be much of a question. Having tried the Mich Ultra, I would have to say that, even though it is more like water, the Mich Ultra is a beter offering."
"Conlusion: If you want a really cheap low carb brew, try this one. I would probably go with the Aspen Edge, but this one is prettty close."
"Tastless seltzer water-like mouthfeel and flavor. Nothing there to talk about. Non-alcoholic brews are tastier than this swill."
"Probably the worst tasting low carb beer of them all. I'm not a fan of the whole low carb craze, but I try and judge beers for their style and not my personal tastes. That said, this beer sucks ass. Bland has can be and it has an odd bite in the finish. Just steer clear."
"Drinkability/notes: I dislike bashing any beer, but this one is a beer in name only. The concept of a low carbohydrate beer is, in my opinion, ridiculous. As several have said, eat a little less junk food and drink a real beer."
"24 ounce can. Crystal clear golden hue, thin pure white head, some decent patchy lacing left at the end of the drink, decent will be the only positive adjective for this beverage. An also crystal clear aroma  dish soap, absolutely horrible, a smell that worsens as it gets closer to your senses. Up front, watery thin, spritzy, minimal flavoring. Intensely carbonated; maybe some hop detection, yet that's stretching the boundaries; combined with your typical macro-beer offerings, almost has some perfume-like tastings. The ingredients of this beverage? I do not want to know what they put in this. Should eventually end up close to the Top a certain BA Ranking chart; one to avoid at all costs, the Green Light puts a bad label on the Rock."
"This is drinkable like water and probably about as alcoholic. Makes ODouls taste good in comparison."
"Very pale yellow, plastic wrap clear with a glowing sense in the late afternoon. Marginal head, mostly a ring with some slight lacing properties sticking to the glass in strings. Mouthfeel is abysmal in heft but the carbonation is more subdued than Michelob Ultra. Some Listerine aromatics interfere with the skeletal malt, corn syrup in neutrality but very hidden. Smell balances as much as hops, and the finish is like a disappearing act -- completely void. Not as fizzy in the stomach as some. Well, the aroma is worst, but there's not a lot good happening here."
"As close to soda a beer is going to get. I would have to say It's more akin to Ginger Ale than beer. I have never had a beer as colorless as this, even moreso than Sleeman. The taste was almost of water, ubt there was a faint hint of corn. No woth a penny in my book."
"wow. this is perhaps the worst beer i've ever sampled. not because of poor flavour or even poor craftsmanship necessarily, but because it's almost mot beer. it's more like liquid air, and is the closest beverage to water that i've ever tried that's not actually water. pours a damn near clear yellow. i could easily see (with detail) everything on the other side of the glass. smell? huh? did i miss something. no characteristics to speak of here. i couldn't give the taste a 1.0 because it wasn't awful, it simply didn't taste like anything. liquid nothing. blah. stay away."
"Appearance: Fizzy yellow beer color (less yellow and fizzy than Michelob Ultra) thin highly carbonated white head specks of lacing form after dwindling in seconds after the pour. Aroma: Grainy sweetness relatively clean but overall comes off bland not a hop profile to be found. Taste: Slight sweet grains and corn adjuncts empty flavor not much going on makes a light beer to compete in the Atkin's crazy world. Mouthfeel: Thin and spritzy extremely carbonated. Drinkability: Rather have an H2O."
"If I was fat and faced with drinking this or having a heart attack, I'd rather die. Merely a skeleton of what beer is supposed to be. The mental image I get from what this beer would look like as a person is something akin to Eddie, on the covers of the Iron Maiden albums. Emaciated, papery skin stretched taut against a ghoulish coutenance, framed with a head of greasy, grave-grown hair. Absolutely ghastly."
"Don't let the Atkins hype poison your brain. There's just no excuse for drinking crap like this, obesity included."
"This is some great tasting water. And it made my teeth feel clean and fresh! For anyone expecting a beer, forget it. I have never ever tasted a product so devoid of any beer character as this (and Mich Ultra). I've tasted NA's that are better than this. Ok, do I have to give a legit review? Here goes: Pale. Poor head that fades. No Taste. Feels like Seltzer water. Finish reminiscent of baking soda. Feels like water in the tummy."
"Over all I would say that the beer was a nice try by Latrobe, I dont think you could make a beer taste good while trying to cut some of its most important properties. For me, it will be the Guinness diet  Draft has 125 calories and 10 grams of carbs and is a real beer!"
"Labtrobe's entry into the ""low carb"" market amazingly retains the DMS character they're known for, while almost completely eliminating everything else. It's a great looking glass of beer (it even leaves some lace), and it's effortless to consume (just like water...), but it's almost entirely devoid of any flavor. In fact, it seems like watered-down Rolling Rock Light. But there are no flaws in it other than what they intended (they wanted the DMS, light body, and lack of flavor), so it can't score all the way at rock bottom. In fact, for a low-carb beer it's pretty good in comparison. But for the amount of carbohydrates you're saving, it's just not worth it; go for the regular Rolling Rock but have one less potato chip, and you'll still be way ahead of the game!"
"This is still a bit more drinkable than say, Michelob Ultra, but beers like these are not worthy of a real beer drinkers attention. Ignore this beer with extreme prejudice."
"Drinkability is peak if it's hot out and you need a quencher, but I wouldn't choose this one for any seasonal parties this winter, except maybe for shock value, heh heh."
"Wow, what a bad beer. I drink a ton of Rolling Rock. When the bartender said it was all warm and I could have the Green Light for free till a RR hit a lower temp I said sure. What a mistake. Try watering down RR and adding some nasty solvent to it. On the plus side you may well lose weight drinking this beer since its so nasty you can't drink very many. If you want low carb go Mich Ultra."
"Its drinkable if you lost your tongue in some horrible work accident."
"This pours out to a decent looking, bright yellow. Actually much brighter than I expected a light beer to be. However, this is where the positives end. The aroma is that of overcooked veggies and cooked cereal. The taste reminds me of soda water with some beer flavoring. Essentially, next to nothing taste-wise. I know people want to hang on the low-carb diet fad, but eat healthy and drink good beer. This isn't worth the time or effort to drink."
"Oh my what a beer. Pours the lightest colour i have ever seen on a beer. The nose is almost non existant and smells of well water. The taste is well quite frankly there is no taste.. The taste consists of a whisper of beer flavour with the carbonation of tonic water. The finish dissapears almost instantly . Squeeze a lemon in it and and you have spritzy lemon beer water. I thought Ultra was insipid, but this stuff goes to a new depth of lack of flavour.. Should be marketed as a malternative- no beer here"
"Well, as I just could not resist buying this Light beer, I most certainly got what I paid for a Light Beer, the pour is a transpicuous gold color with the head a creamy white and modest in size, lace a nice thin sealing sheet. Nose is crisp and clean, start is lightly sweet with the top cadaverous in feel. Finish is brisk in its carbonation, hops are quite light, the aftertaste dry, just what you would expect from a Light Beer, nothing, but hell I was thirsty, and it was only a $1.19."
"My god what were they thinking in latrobe when they created this brew??? I really cant find anything good about this beer, it pours out to an extremely pale yellow and one can definetly smell the adjuncts in it. As for the taste, or lack there of, it is horrible, I will not hesitate to say that this is officially the worst beer I have ever had."
"Very pale golden color with a crisp white head. Decent sized head that fades rapidly to nothing. Large carbonation tries to sustain the head, but is fighting a losing battle. Smell is a little sweet and very clean. Taste, almost non existent, a touch of malt with a lingering sweetness on the aftertaste. Mouthfeel like carbonated water, drinkability: well, it goes down better than many municipal water supplies, but isn't all that enjoyable. But a great summer thirst quencher. I'd almost call it a near-beer, but it does have some alcohol, although it doesn't show in the taste. Not offensive, but why bother? A beer for people who don't like the taste of beer."
"Pours a pale golden straw color with a surprisingly thick and creamy white head that quickly dissipates into a nice amount of lace. The use of adjuncts is very apparent in the nose with a bit of a cooked veggie aroma. Very light and thin in body. Taste is sweet corn and cereal-like grain husks followed by some metallic notes. This was my first and last time to have this beer. This makes regular Rolling Rock seem outstanding."
"but this Light is an embarrassment, please remove it from your stable. OK, colour is nice, light golden, very limited head with some minor glass cling. The body is thin and the taste is well balanced but frail. This brew has no personality, it saddens me."
"   its only good point was that it made me hunger for a R R"
"Light of lights. Why bother with this when tap water will do? If I am ever this desperate for alcohol again I will drink Listerene. Very light color, no taste. You could brush your teeth, or shave with this ""beer""."
"I have to go with psugrad98 on this one.  While it is readily available here in Pennsylvania, that does not exactly mean I would go out of my way to get it.  It is pale, has little aroma, and tastes just like it looks and smells...Proceed with caution."
"Why, Why, Why, Why, Why, Why would I even try this beer?  Give every beer a chance and remember to never do anything this foolosh again."
"Notes: Is this really a beer? If you're looking for a beer that tastes like creamed corn, has no malt or hop flavour, then sticks you with a nasty-ass aftertaste ... you can have the other 5 beers in my six-pack."
