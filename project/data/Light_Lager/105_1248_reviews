"When I realized I was willing to drive all over the place to find it I understood finally that this is my favorite beer. If you are looking for a light beer that has a full-body feel and taste then this is the beer for you. All other light beers end up tasting like water with some beer in it by comparison. With that said, compared to Miller Lite, you'll be having an extra (approx.)thirty calories, but considering the trade off, it is well worth it. This is easily Miller's best (""light"") beer. Well done!"

"I have drank this beer since my college days of the late 1990's. I still drink and enjoy it today. Can only find it sold at certain stores, in certain geographical locations. Dissappointed when I can not find it in a store, which happens more often than not."

"Shatters my expectations, I guess. Pretty drinkable and there are not terribly disgusting off flavors, though it does come off a little too metallic for me to recommend it as a good lawnmower beer."
"drinkability: dear. god. no."
"D- Very watery and bland with nasty metallic notes."
"Pours a light straw color with a thin white head and no lacing. Smells of sweet corn and some grain. Tastes like both with some random bits of bitterness. Mouthfeel is thin and nasty. Drinkability is decent."
"Well hey, for a $6.99 12 pack, it was worth the flyer. Good for beer pong."
"Drinkability: A not-so-light light beer at 123 calories. Follow the lager drinking rules of ""drink it cold, drink it fast", as it starts to become a bit grating as it warms."
"Taste, more aluminum and corn, but I must say, its better than a lot of light beers I've had. A decent yeast or fruity strain to it. If Miller Light is triple hopped, than this is too I guess, because there is a faint hop aspect to it. Leaves a decent mouthfeel presence, and is very drinkable if you're into that kind of I drank 12 beers vibe."
"Drinkability is totally middle of the road for the style as well - high marks for actually tasting some nice malt and hops in the flavor, but the vegetable notes are a bit weird and offputting."
"I last had Southpaw in my fraternity house in college. We had bought a big box for our pledges to drink (shocking I know). Now, we had a strict anti-hazing policy, and my policy as pledge master was that I wouldn't make the pledges do anything I wouldn't do myself. I took one sip of the Southpaw, apologized, and went to get them Newcastle on my own dime to make it up to them. Maybe our batch was skunked, but I never bothered with Southpaw again to find out."
"D - Not my first choice by any means, but Southpaw Light is actually fairly decent for the style. This tastes more like a macro than a light, which counts for something."
"I would choose southpaw light over most any other American light beer, but I don't know when the next time i will choose this beer categorize will be. Perhaps never!"
"Found this beer in Morristown TN. Fares pretty well compared to other light beers on the market, however I doubt if it is all that light. The flavors end up quite sweet with a blend of pilsner malts and cereal grains. Although indicating the beer is 'double-hopped' the beer only has a mild increase in hop bitterness and brings a grassy flavor that also becomes a bit metallic. Sulfer flavors and vegitable flavors are there but don't really kill the beer. Aromas reveal the same character but cleaner with the sweetness. Textures a a bit weighted for light beers and do deter a bit. Finishes pretty clean with a sweet, vegitable note. Pretty average throughout with a mild distraction here and there."
"This is not readily available in my neck of the woods, so I wont be drinking it regularly. But, if I happen to end up out east, I might drink a few, as it isnt bad at all"
"The ""recession refreshin'"" perfect cheap beer hunt continues..."
"CLIFSNOTES: A cheap light and 'thin' beer."
"Better and flavor than some in the style. A slightly above average light lager."
"A good thirst quencher on a hot day even if a bit thin. Inexpensive (at least in Ga.) and as light beers go better than the average."
"A decent golden color, this beer has the typical sweet corn smell of American macro light brews. Taste-wise, this beer isn't awful. It taste much like it smells: Sweet and corny. A moderate carbonation gives it a clean soda like crispness that makes it somewhat refreshing. Considering the cost and quality comparison to other major American light beers, Southpaw is to me the way to go if you must."
"Doesn't look like a light beer; Appears dark golden and a has a bubbly white head with some lacing. Super corn smell. It doesn't taste bad. I mostly noticed corn and slight hoppiness. Sticky aftertaste. Moderate carbonation and slightly watery going down. It's a drinkable cheap beer."
"This was a typical semi-bitter pale colored lager. The head was thin and quickly dissipated. Nothing special but definitely drinkable. Tastes like Miller with a bit more refinement. I would have this beer on a hot Summer day after cutting the grass. Refreshing in the heat."
"Drink-Ability: Hey what can I say I used to drink the crap out of the beer for the simple fact it was 8.99 for a case in my hometown. This is definitely a cheap crappy bear but it did its job real well back in my high school years. But I dont recommend going out and just buying this one."
"Drinkabilty: there's no thinking involved. It's just a bit boring. Also it's definitely not as AWFUL as I've heard. It's just not that good."
"I tend to agree that this beer is not the caliber that our current offerings are, but don't discount it because it's brewed by Plankroad and owned by Miller."
"D - Very drinkable. I could see downing a 6pk of these so easily that it's honestly not funny. Crisp and refreshing as most light beers are. Definitley a good choice for family get-togethers and such."
"Not really a review of this, more of a nostalgic remembrance. At Auburn this was my friends and mine drink of choice. Went down clean, cold, and with a 5.0% kick for under $3 a six pack which is all we wanted. Not the best tasting stuff, but not bah tasting either. Actually I would have to say it was pretty much just devoid of taste. My brother in law always called it ""that left handed kangaroo beer."" I've on occasion been tempted to pick up a sixer for sentimental reasons."
"Mouthfeel/drinkability: It was watery with little flavor, but finished clean. Moderate carbonation. Kinda made my stomach fell like I drank alot of water....not so fun."
"I had this in the beer oasis which is known as Mobile, AL. Very cheap, I thought it might make for a decent all night drinker. Very watery, I'm surprised this is even 120 calories or whatever and 5% abv b/c it takes like pure water. Slight corn sweetness, I can see how this is a Miller product but really, really water. Clean tasting, makes good for drinking games but that's about it. The Yuengling I had after finishing a sixer of this stuff was amazing and super flavorful which shows how little flavor this had."
"I haven't seen this beer around Texas or Louisiana, so I picked it up while on vacation in Mississippi. I'm surprised this isn't available everywhere since it is a Miller product. Appearance is yellow with a weak, fizzy head. Smell is of corn, lightly sweet and somewhat stinky. Taste is pure adjunct, with a light sweetness and hint of metalic flavor. This is okay, I guess about average for the typical light beer. I bought this to sample, and I won't buy it again."
"The only up side to this is that a case of this brew is only $11, and the high ABV. Personally I would rather spend the extra $7 on a good beer, but maybe thats just me?"
"-abv: 5.0% high for a light macro brew"
"overall- a college beer that was made for beer funnels and boat races(flip cup)! Don't drink otherwise!!"
"Yo, this stuff rocks."
"Anyway, I guess it has a tiny bit more to it then sayCoors Light. It has a nice ABV for a light-lager, and the price is definitely right ($5 a 12 pack). Southpaw Light has sort of a PBR taste to it when you drink it out of the can (you make the call if thats good or bad). I actually prefer it out of the can, the experience is enhanced I guess when you cut out some of the corny-sweet aromas."
"How.. how.. how is this beer rated as high as it is? My God this stuff is terrible. It's cheap, and that's about all it has goin for it. Tastes so bitter, smells horrible, this beer will hurt your feelings. Had it on tap at my friends house because it was only $53 a keg, and for good reason. Total piss."
"Tasted better in the Carolina's..."
"My bros used to drink this crap, but I always stayed away from it. I figured I may as well try it though for shits and giggles. There is no real solid smell to it, other than water and faint hops. Had a carbo head, but bubbled down soon after pouring. The taste was very watery, almost like bottled water, with beer flavoring added. Not a choice for me, but I guess someone likes it if they are still selling it."
"a fuller and (slightly) more flavourful brew than your standard macro light beer. not much more to say about this one. nothing daring about it. it's certainly easy to drink and, given the subpar choices when i had this one (bud light and miller light were the only other options), i'd always choose a southpaw, but it's certainly never gonna knock any good beer out of my fridge."
"123 Cal. & 5% ABV (per bottle label)"
"extremely easy to drink, but then again so is water. this had really no taste, which makes it heads and shoulders better than some other lights that are skunky as hell. it says 5% alcohol, which seems high for a light, but there is certainly no extra flavor"
"Light gold in color, modest white head that vanishes quickly, little or no lace.  Sweet aroma with faint malt notes.  Tasting yields a burst of sweet flavors, then a burst of hops toward the finish.  Southpaw is not really bad, but there is nothing memorable about it.  Another beer that my non-beer drinking friends like."
"This beer is horrible. I've tried it several times because several of my friends drink this stuff all the time, but I can't finish it. I've tried it sober, I've tried it drunk and I've tried it in between and I've never liked it."
"Another product produced under Miller's Plank Road Brewery label.  Advertised as ""double hopped.""  It was more hoppy, relatively speaking for an American light beer.  I has a typical ""Miller"" character, and I made the connection even before I knew Plank Road was a Miller alter-ego.  As light beers go, this is probably one of the better."
