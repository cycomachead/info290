Great beer for college kids looking for $7 deal for a 12 pack. utterly disgusted to call this a beer. Being a DIPA lover, this is not my style. This beer is good for someone who needs a cheap beer...fast...and make sure to get tums for the morning. This guy does not sit well","MIchelle318","Feb 14, 2013"

Water has more character, and is more refreshing...transparency exploded exponentially, this is a ghost of a shade of a whisper of a beer...soggy, corny, utterly vapid....body is lightness to the max, finish is nothing, taste doesn't count...a waste...why drink this? Why? If anyone has the answer, please don't hesitate to inform me...I live to learn...","feloniousmonk","Dec 19, 2003"
1.88,-14.9,2.5,2,2,1.5,1.5,"Very much like it's regular counterpart, this is still a clear gold color, with not much of a white head. The same corny sweetness of High Life regular, only with a ligher, more diluted flavor. It is still bad beer, that makes my stomache queasy every time I think about it (due to their ad featuring a man gorging on deviled eggs, and having to switch to light beer so he can choke down more food). One of the less quality light macros out there.","TastyTaste","Dec 05, 2003"

2.49,12.7,3.5,2,2,3,3.5,"Pours to a sudsy white head and unbelievable (for a cheap ass beer) retention and lacing. Aroma is sweet corn adjunct and carbonated water. Mouthfeel is bubbly, watery. Flavor is a very light typical American light beer taste but with the added bonus of a bit of extra bittersweet bite. Finishes clean and slightly bittersweet. Not offensive, just very lacking in most aspects, except for appearance and drinkability, which were better than expected.","EagleTalon","Jul 14, 2003"

The taste is watery with some corn sweetness and a slight hop bite. All in all this is about as low as I am willing to go anymore. There must be worse beers out there, but I hope I never run across them","brakspear","Jun 08, 2003"
1.53,-30.8,1.5,1,1,2,3,"OKAY so its macro-swill, but its the low cal version of the best macro-swill available. High Life Light is thin and watery but actually sort of has a flavor. Well okay, so its isn't so much a flavor as it is a lack of bad taste. In fact its more like a lack of taste. F+ beer. I've had worse, much worse in fact but I'm not proud of it.","Jables","Beers"
3.92,77.4,3,3.5,4,4,4.5,"What can I say, this beer gets a lot of bad reviews, but I was impressed. Kinda of a drinkable, cornish flavor. Went down smooth. Like I said, hints of corn all over it, almost too much, but besides that, a really decent beer. I would reccomend this beer to the people that are curious to try new beers, but to a veteran, this beer could be bad.","adamboeckman","0"
2.16,-2.3,3,2,2,2,2.5,"Basically a more watered down and flavorless version of High Life, if that's possible. Pale yellow in appearance with a white head. Aroma consists of some malt and alcohol. Thin mouthfeel. Bland taste consists of grain, corn adjunct, a feint hop bitterness and light alcohol. High Life Light is somewhat similar to Miller Lite in flavor. Nothing special here.","Winter","Oct 25, 2002"
2.6,17.6,2.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,3,"I tried this as i was on a beer diet and only would allow myself light beers. As i had been drinking High Life for sometime, i tried the light version. It's similar, but lacks the sweet flavor that many find attractive in the regular version. It's not too high in alcohol, as i didn't start feeling the ""high life"" with this one until i had nearly 6 under my belt. Nevertheless, it's an interesting brew, and worthy of a try.","Frozensoul327","Oct 25, 2002"
2.15,-2.7,2,2,2,2.5,2.5,"the champagne of water. this is closer to aquafina than beer, so i guess you know what i am gettin at. basically all the flavor of high life is drowned out. you can't really taste anything, so it goes down.","ElGuapo","Oct 17, 2002"
1.8,-18.6,2,2,1.5,2,2,"Never see commercials for this for a good reason. I don't think anyone drinks it and it has a shelf life of 10+ years. Do an experiment. Make a mark on a bottle at your local beer store. Go back in a month, no 3 months. It will still be there. It is light colored and has no taste. Please Miller, just deep six it.","bewareOFpenguin","Aug 23, 2002"
2.5,13.1,2,2,3,2,2.5,"Well, they actually did a decent job of retaining most of the taste of Miller High Life.  It does a better job there than MGD Light matching up with regular MGD.  High Life Light is still a light beer, but its not awful.","Beastdog75","Jul 09, 2002"

1.53,-30.8,2,1.5,1.5,1.5,1.5,"O.K.  Why bother.  I don't care for regular High Life and this contributed to my High Life dislike.  Very watery with a chemical-type aftertaste.  I know High Life and its cousins are near and dear to some, but folks, this is not a good beer.","proc","Mar 31, 2002"
2.63,19,3,2.5,2.5,2.5,3,"Nice fresh appearance with moderate head. First taste of of grain and maltiness.  Very ordinary, but well suited for guzzling on holidays with friends.  Miller constantly makes a brew better than the other macros.  This one is no exception.","psugrad98","Dec 16, 2001"
1.18,-46.6,1.5,1,1,1.5,1.5,"The color and carbonation are the best points for this beer.  Begins with a solid foamy head that disappears very quickly, with a bit of lace throughout.  Hoppy aroma along with an odd chemical smell that I am hard pressed to describe.  Overall, very little taste, other than the hoppiness, its just like carbonated water.","Pegasus","Beers"
1.66,-24.9,3,2,1,2,2,"Rather light aroma that is mostly hops at first, then fades to nothing.  Medium foamy head that dissipates but leaves rings in the glass.  Yellow-gold color. The taste is largely the bitterness of the hops and the carbonation (if that has flavor).  Otherwise pretty watery with a slight quenching finish.","garymuchow","0"
