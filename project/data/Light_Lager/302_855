I drank this can at well above the Rocky Mountain level of cold that it is intended to be served at and it still wasn't a chore to imbibe (just try that with most light beer).

I've never had it before. So I pour... Very clear hay yellow color with a quickly-dissolving soap bubble head. Now it looks like diluted apple juice. Smells earthy and corn-like. Smells like just about every other macrobrewed light beer ever. But the taste is a little different. Surprising. Tastes like cereal? Cherrios, Corn Flakes... King Vitamin? This may smell like every other light beer but the taste is pleasantly surprising. Slightly sweet, grainy, and Grape Nuts good. I like it. It's still a watery beer that you'd drink mass quantities of around a campfire with your jerkoff friends but it's not bad. All beers need love. I'll cherish the time that I have with the other 29 Genny Lights.","berserker256","Jan 31, 2010"

Mouthfeel was really thin and watery with a better, cleaner taste than Leaded. Maybe producing a Light version of a beer CAN be a good thing... Finish was likewise less sharp and more pleasant that Leaded. I would drink this over Leaded, but I would still like to grab a Genny Cream and see how it stands up.","woodychandler","Aug 13, 2009"

The pale, watery, corny presence is accompanied by some real flavor- flavor that is noticeably missing from some of the other super cheap beers like Natty light, etc. A bit sour and salty, really light mouthfeel, with some real (gasp) malt flavor.

Although it is not as gross as I remembered, it's a far cry from the ales of Dogfish or the Lagers of Germany. It is, however, and adjunct laden, watery mess that is par for the course for it's style. Sweet aromas of cereal grains, raw barley, and metalic hops. The malt profile is timid to the taste, along side of the hop flavors and bitterness. Leaves some sulfer compounds (burned match, cooked corn) and a tart, green apple flavor on the mouth. Quite dry and bitey to the feel and lingers into the terse finish. I guess it's fine if you are fishing with your dad in 1984, but you won't find it in my cellar.","BEERchitect","Oct 19, 2007"

The taste is not bad, probably the best light brew I have (especially with the cost factored in) with the exception of Sam Adams Light. The crisp taste, adequately carbonation and toasted flavors make it quite smooth. It is nothing overly exciting but for me it is a ok brew when you are trying to save a few bucks or drink with friends that more or less enjoy macro brews.

The smell is a killer, slightly reminds me of a urinal. The taste, while crappy when comparing to a non light beer, is still better than just about all other macro lights. There is a strong corn and vegetable taste, but nothing too overpowering. It starts out strong then leaves a subpar grainy aftertaste on the pallette. The mouthfeel is flat, but predictable as there are virtually no bubbles in the glass after the first minute or so. As far as drinkability goes, I'd save it for the hot summer days, the ballpark and the cheap 30 pack for the party.","barrettds","Jan 30, 2006"

Not too many bubbles can be seen rising to the surface; and the mouthfeel backs that up. It's carbonation is fairly restrained for the style, and it's more soft and smooth in the mouth than crisp. Some corn-like, sweetish malt (DMS, perhaps?) greets you in the nose and carries over into the flavor. Bitterness is kept to a minimum, and only a hint of hop flavor is found in the finish. A dull residual maltiness and touch of bitterness linger in the mouth and throat along with a touch of soapiness. It's not particularily off-putting, but I'd like to see it a little crisper.

Here's my take: Upon opening the twist-off cap, the loud ""Pfffst!!!"" foreshadowed the sudsy, gassy pour. I was immediately met with the faint smells of ""Canadian beer skunk"" (I know, Rochester is in New York, but they're neighbors) as well as faint grain and alcohol aromas. Skunky, rubbery flavor with a lot of water. There's a huge hole in the flavor of this beer. The fizzy mouthfeel is too thin and off-putting--much like Michelob Ultra (yuck).
