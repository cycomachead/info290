This style of beer has never been my bag, but I am willing to grant that this is a surprisingly tolerable example, and I will have no trouble finishing the other 5 bottles. I like this more than Bud Light Lime, although to be fair I haven't actually had any of that stuff in at least 3 years. I doubt I'll buy this again, but I'd have no problem drinking one if offered, and anyone in the market for a tolerable light beer should give this one a look.","thehyperduck","Sep 20, 2014"

2.49,27.7,3,2.75,2.25,2.5,2.5,"Miller Chill brewed by Miller Brewing Co. This brew has 100 calories and ABV of 4.1. This brew pours out a light amber color with a thin white head. The head to this brew goes away fast. There is a lot of carbonation to this brew but no head. The smell is lime and that is about it. It really dose not smell like beer. The taste is lime and some other flavor that I can't put my finger on. This brew is not bad but not good either. It is smooth with lime but it light and it has a funky aftertaste. For the aftertaste this brew loose out. The mouthfeel is decent at first and clean. But this brew has a funky aftertaste. Miller Chill is drinkable. Overall I'm giving this brew a 2.50 out of 5.","nicholas2121","Jun 08, 2014"

Pours a pale straw-yellow in color with about a 2-finger white foamy head that doesn't last too long. Not much lacing was seen with each sip. Lots of streaming bubbles were seen raising form the bottom of the glass. The aroma is of grains (probably corn) and lime. The taste was pretty much the same. Very light body and on the water-down side. Guess that would account for the lover alcohol content. Overall it was OK. Nothing special but different.","BeerWithMike","Sep 03, 2013"

Pabst Blue Ribbon has more definitive flavor. Bud light more hops. Seagrams' malt beveridge at least has flavor. The slightly metallic wheatiness of this highly carbonated liquid, was so distant from the ideal, I wonder it could even be called "beer". Even in the world of summer and light beers, I'd say this was low in its category, and I wouldn't even give it the purposeful quality of "thirst quenching quaffable". Bring on the genuine ginger ale!

Tastes do the same thing as aromas--start off very Miller-ish, leaving a little longer lag into a sweet Sprite / 7up taste with even sweeter adjuncts and cereal grains. The sweetness seems to be more overpowering than even the lime flavor additions or salt additions. In fact, the salt character would go largely unnoticed if not for the lable. The texture really suffers with a water, sugar-water feel, prickly carbonation and flat texture. Finishes with an emphasis on the sweet grains and fading lime flavor.

There wasn't much in the nose except a hint of the lime, but the taste was actually something more than I expected. Reminded me of a Corona with a lime and salty corn chips. The taste was like summer in the backyard. And the definite (albeit light) beer background in the taste brought a unique balance to the whole thing--malty, fruity, sweet, salty, bubbly... and watery too. Still, I was intrigued. A bit put-off by the salty taste, but that really isn't very strong. And I could see how it could actually help make it more drinkable.

However, it pretty much tastes exactly like light beer with salt and lime, and that's not particularly pleasant. It's not bad, it's just that there's not enough malt base to balance the salt and mild tang of the lime. I found it interesting, but watery, and wished I had a regular beer instead. It might be worth trying just to see if you like, or hell, even just to try it - I'm guessing the marketing boys are betting on that!
