"Pretty horrifying but if you've already had a lot to drink, I suppose it goes down easily enough."
"Good cheap swill.  I've ingested lots of it, but never stopped to ""feel"" it, sorry. Almost identical to Miller Lite, fwiw (also made by Miller)"
""
"O-  Blech."
"Anything lower than a negative 1?"
"Bought a six pack and went to the beach. Poured on a pilsner glass. Looked like a watery yellow, pretty nasty. Smelled like corn and rice. Taste was the worst. Defenitely worst beer ive had in my life. I could give it a 0 but I cant. Just barely had 1 and gave the rest to some random guy at the beach. DONT DRINK THIS ""BEER"""
"Rock bottom. It's about as bad as Naty Lite."

"Pours a nice golden color with moderate carbonation and a lace of head. So far so good. Smells like all the other putrid adjunct lagers. Goes down kinda harsh, highly carbonated, dry and a little bitter. One of the worst adjunct lagers let alone light lagers...avoid"

"Have you guys ever seen that movie with the dude who gets all mad and turns into a more jacked up dude that's kinda green? Yea? Well drinking Milwaukee's Best (Beast) is kinda like that but less green. Seriously I've never been to Milwaukee, but if this is what their beer is like it's probably a great place. Smooth, really, really crisp - balanced and well hopped. I'd say the abv is a little low for my purposes but when you're out with the boys it gets the job done. UNLEASH THE BEAST."

"Mild lager. Decent taste. Has its pros and cons. Overall, not a terrible beer for the money. Got a 12 pack for $6. BA is terrible though. Definitely would want more than a 4.20% All these reviews about it being watery, I can understand seeing as how it's got a ""Light"" flavor, but it is tolerable."

"O - It's a shitty light beer that has been in my fridge for three months. It was time to make room for better product. I will drink the other 7 after I am drunk sometime and need a water to sober up."

"A real cult classic, one for the whole family, the feel good hit of the summer. Or something."

"For a really cheap beer, I thought it was actually better than I thought it was going to be. The first time I tried this was on a hot summers day after work in 2012. The special at the bar was "" short pitcher of ""the beast"" for 3 dollars. The flavor of the beer was ok, but nothing special. The look of the beer actually varied from a dark brownish color to a light yellowish color. For a daily special at a bar it wasn't a terrible bargain or price, but as of rating it was."
""
"O - Overall, Probably the best out of the "" Milwaukee "" series. I'd have at a party."

"Spelunky. Spelunky. Spelunky. Spelunky. God, am I garbage here... Anyway, this stuff pours a clear pale sallow topped by a finger of white foam. The nose comprises light flowers, mild grass, and a decent amount of soap. The taste brings in more of the same, along with some decidedly funky wheat. The end result is an odd melange of metallic, sour, and bitter. Suffice it to say, it doesn't taste good at all. The body is pretty light, with a moderate carbonation and a watery feel. Overall, a depressing offering, one I don't hope to tangle with again any time soon."

"Man back in the day you could score these so cheap, like $29.99 a keg at Discount Liquors in Milwaukee. Mouthfeel is just some sweetness, metallic corn insides. Probably ok for beer pong if you're young and dumb. I've had worse beers, but not too many. This beers main sin is that it lacks any substance. I'd recommend only if you need a palate cleanser. Even on a hot day, there's plenty of flavorful yet light options out there."
"Overall: It is a light beer and not one of the better ones out there. The price is good about $7 for a 12 pack so if you want something to quench your thirst with a lititle bit of a beer bite this will do it."

"O: Peasantly surprised by this beer. I have been on the hunt for a go to light beer and this one is not disappointing. Solid taste and mouthfeel for a light beer. If you are looking for a light beer that does not taste too light for an American adjunct light lager give this one a try. Above average for the style."

"Not much of an appearance with about a 1"" head that quickly disappears. Smells like watered down...water beer. Taste like a normal american pilsner which lacks much flavor or imagination. Really crisp and tastes pretty much how it smells and looks. Let's face it, this is a drinking game beer so leave it for the tailgates or beer pong. Unless of course it's free, then the ""free beer"" rule applies. Not super offensive but not very good. I could live the rest of my days without ever drinking this again. ""Free Beer"" rule does not apply here."

"This generic American beer by Miller is terrible!! And this is coming from a Natty Light fan! I decided to give this beer a try as it's in the same price range as Natural Light... and it SUCKED!!! I got a 24 pack box of cans as I didn't have a whole lot of money but wanted a couple days worth of beer, big mistake!! This beer is SWILL! It tastes like beer flavored water! Even for a cheap beer I was expecting better. The buzz even after 4-5 beers was really weak! I will never again buy this brand of beer EVER!"

"Was probably the beer of choice when I was in college just because it is very cheap. It is that cheap for a reason because it is not very good. Poor taste and potent aftertaste but you can drink a lot of them, making it very popular for the college atmosphere. Therefore, goes down very easily but too watered down and has not much of a taste to it. Not too pure and not that smooth but you can drink a lot of them."

"Pretty much what I expected from this one."
"If you enjoy BMC light beers, save your money and buy this -- the price is quite lower and the quality is identical to other light ""premium"" brands. I'd drink this on a hot day, but wouldn't pay for it."
"This is truly a horrific beer. I'd like to know what Milwaukee's Worst is if this is the Best. Tough to swallow without gagging a little bit. I suppose if it were the end of the world and this is all I could find, I would scarf it down quickly. Can only be used as a party/get drunk quick beer. No way can you sip and enjoy something like this."
"For the price I suppose it serves a purpose, but it's certainly not a craft beer, nor would it have much appeal to those with a refined beer palate. A frathouse special to be sure."
"Pours a light clear yellow, fizzy head dies down to nothing. Very light pale grain/malt flavor, just a flash of ghost hop bitterness. When ice cold, it goes down fairly fast though the flavor is almost nonexistant. Mouthfeel is light bodied, crisp, soda water like. Overall, good beer if you don't like beer."
"How disappointing...I held out hope that you would pull through in the end but didn't. Beer is super thin, watery, has a late bitterness, mild pilsen sweetness up front, midpalate vegetalness, at least there isn't an aftertaste. I don't think I'll ever bother having this again but I imagine this is exactly what they want, flavored water. I don't really like it overall but at least I drank one. Now I know and knowing is half the battle."
"Ya... it hurts to think that i did this to my body back in the 90's. Heck, it hurts to think that i did this to my body last night. Never again."
"It is piss gold. Tastes like corn with crap. Carbonated like a soda and overall just should never touch my tongue again."
"Pours a light pale yellow color, some carbonation, little fizzy white head, with minimal sticky lacing left behind. The nose is kinda malty, grainy. The taste is slightly sweet, grainy/ricy. Light Body. Not Drinkable. Would make a thirst quencher though."
"D- Easy as water, but boring as it gets."
"This is definately not a beer to pour into a glass, I only did it for the review. Just drink it from the can, but if I'm low on cash I prefer this to bud or coors anyday."
"Thin bodied, a lot of carbonation, has a dry finish, and does not have one impressive quality. This is swill at its worst. Avoid this beer."
"D: Good if you plan on throwing a party with beer pong or if you're too thirsty to care about how it tastes. Otherwise, don't bother."
"Pours a nasty looking straw yellow, white head, and no lacing. Smells of grain and booze. Tastes of some sort of grain and nasty bitterness. Mouthfeel is thin and rocky and has high carbonation. Drinkability is not very good. Not a very good beer at all. Stay away from it if you can."
"D/O- This guy mysteriously ended up in the fridge one day and has been sitting there for a good 6 to 9 months. Haven't a clue where it came from. Glad it's gone now...taking up too much space."
"overall another that i would never go near again."
"D- It's a light lager. It's better than most, but this still isn't much of anything i enjoyed."
"So go ahead, shottie these all through the night with your friends, but don't expect an actual good beer just to drink for the sake of enjoying beer while sessioning or otherwise. This is a social beer, plain and simple and there's nothing wrong with that."
"For the style, this is what it should be."
"Taste: What I said of the smell is also true of the taste. Sweet cereal grains, almost nonexistent hops."
"Poured from a 12 oz. can. Has a pale yellow color with a small head. Smell is of corn, some malts. Taste is basically missing in action. Beer flavored water. Feels light in the mouth and has good drinkability. Overall not the worst light beer I have had, but nothing special."
"Overall, just because the smell isn't miserable, and the taste doesn't commit any crimes either, I'll bump this up a little bit on the drinkability scale."
"Overall: Honestly, this is not offensive. It's just very...tame. Will continue to give you gas the morning after..."
"D: Goes down like water simply because there isn't enough taste to savor and it's best to do it quickly before the stench overwhelms. I finally reviewed my father's sentimental favorite, and it came off just as expected."
"Notes: Beer flavored water anyone? The same as most light lagers/adjuncts."
"D: No taste (Or at least a very slight and undesirable taste) and goes down like water. Horrendous."
"Drinkability: The unpleasantness of the taste makes this a beer you either have to chug or not drink at all."
"A golden yellow, rather fizzy beer with no real head to speak of. No aroma, except for maybe stale malts that are hardly noticeable. A very slight taste of hops and malt. More like carbonated water with a little bit of alcohol. It does the job to say the least..."
"Drinkability- Extremely light on the stomach, so I could see someone going through several of these with ease. With that said this is not a beer i will ever pick up for myself but my dad seems to enjoy them, well by enjoy i mean its cheap and it gets you drunk. I'm glad I found a world of far better beers to enjoy."
"The drinkability is what gets me and many others...out of the can anyway. It's not bitter as many of the bad cheapos are. It's even borderline refreshing. The Milwaukee's Best brand seems to be a cult following and its drinkers are almost proud to be so. Count me in as a follower."
"I can't believe my friends convinced me to drink this."
"The beer pours and extremely light gold. A thin, bubbly head quickly fades into nothing with barely any lacing. The smell is the average sickly-sweet scent of corn malts that are too weak to even cover up what little alcohol is here. The taste is not terrible. It's got that harsh, shitty malts & hops Beast taste, but toned down, so it is pretty tolerable. The mouthfeel is thin, but it goes well with the rest of the beer. And, as with all light beers, the drinkability is the best part."
"This beer is too damn drinkable. This beer is my closet indulgence that I love to drink on a hot day, while mowing the lawn, or with friends on summer days when planning to imbibe many. I love my micros, but this is the cheap macro that I always fall back on for an enjoyable drinking experience. I always have it on hand and probably always will."
"Carbonated water is the main flavor here with a bit of sweet corny grains making up the remainder. Surprisingly, it does have a noticeable hop bitterness and clean finish to it. It falls a bit short of average for a light lager, mainly due to the lack of discernable flavor."
"Light yellow colored beer with a rapidly fading head.Aroma and taste are light adjuncts.Smooth and when ice cold is really a hell of a beer.The perfect summer outing beer.Highly recommended for outdoor activities of all kinds.This is something that I always have and always will purchase."
"A finger of fluffy, bone-white head with low retention. Nose was lightly sweet with some cereal in the background. Color was a golden-yellow with NE-quality clarity. Mouthfeel was medium with a light sweetness on the tongue. Finish was kind of thin without much taste to recount. It was yet another ho-hum offering in a CAN. Come on! There have to be some good beers in a CAN out there. I just seem to have exhausted the string."
"Milwaukee's Best light was light golden color with good clarity. It had a bubbly white head that somehow managed to stick around a little while and left a little lacing behind. The smell was light and a little grainy. The taste was very light and with a dry, sort of grainy finish. The mouthfeel was light and watery with plenty of carbonation. Drinkabity was below average. It's just another tasteless light beer. The only thing it has going for it is the price."
"Pours a light yellow color with an okay head. The smell is of corn and a small malt. The taste is of grain and some malt. It is very light but it is there. The mouthfeel is moderate carbonation. The overall drinkability of the beer is pretty low. It is much like all macros."
"This is my least favorite beer; however it amazes me to see how popular it is. Seems like the cheap price is the catch so I have dubbed it ""Trailer Trash Beer"" not that I have anything against Trailer Parks (I grew up in one). If you drink enough of these you will forget how really awful they are like ugly women becoming beautiful when you're drunk. Still it has this appeal like a prostitute; Down and Dirty!"
"I like it."
"Laughing as I bump a few scores allowed to warm a slight bit and the flavor did improve. The astringency was gone. Still doesnt taste good but I will bump a little. The drinkability improved when the beer was slightly warmed up."
"D--I only have 1, and I'm only having one. This one is going down nicely, so I'm seeing the drinkablilty side of this. I'm wondering about the next day after-effects if I'd settle into a serious session."
"Water is the mouthfeel....water, with some bubbles."
"D- It IS better than some of the other ultra cheap macros out there, but lets be serious, I wouldn't buy it again."
"A pale yellow color with a big fizzy white head that faded very quickly,no lacing. Aroma of corn,cardboard,and sweet baby vomit.Flavor at first is almost nonexistant,but as it warms a couple of degrees it takes on an odd sweet metallic taste,thin body and stinky finish. I can drink this if I am dying from thirst but save your money and buy some real beer eh."
"Overall, I wouldn't ever buy this or recommend it to anyone. I can see this as being a college beer pong beer, but that is about it."
"Pours a clear, pale, yellow with little head and no retention - slight lacing. Smells of an adjunct lager. Fits the style. Slightly sweeter than Milwaukee's Best Ice. Low carbonation and tastes mostly of adjunct in a weak lager. Overall, not worth recommending."
"This one blows its bigger brother away, probably because the rank taste and odor is supplanted by water. Lighter yellow pour, bubbly white head. Sweeter, beer-like aroma. Malt? Hops? Really? taste is not awful, kind of crisp and mineral water, but with actual beer taste. And its not ass!"
" Be kind to yourself, drink somethin' else!"
"This just another low flavor, high popularity brew. Very blow average as far as macro-lagers go. You can find better beers in the same price range than this one. Fizzy rice-water taste to start with, little head retention (should you even want to pour this type of beer into a glass), and no aroma to speak of. Sorry, but this one's no good."
"D - Poor. This is watery as hell, and flavorless to boot. Shame...I like the Ice version of Milwaukee's Best."
"♦"
"The college kids beer of choice! A cheap source of beer but this hovers somewhere between a foul beer and a glass of water. Very pale, corn, grain, musty dirty malty taste... there really isn't much else to say. I think everyone knows what this beer tastes like. Or has a pretty good idea."
"Appearance is watered down tinkle yellow. The head pillows up real big and nice then dies off almost as fast. The smell is nearly non-existant, taste is surprisingly less offensive than the other ultra-cheap beers. I found this much more tolerable than that of Natural Light and Busch Light and even PBR! (back off fanboys, that trash is uber-swill!!). There is a tad of metallic aftertaste but it doesn't last long enough to bother. Mouthfeel is surprisingly smooth given the overall lack of flavor. Drinkability seems a bit high as it's so watered down and non-offensive. I could probably crush a 6-pack of tallboys and then get started on some real beer with no problem."
"This isnt terrible, it just isnt good. I'll be spending my money on something else from now on!"
"Pale straw color and crystal clear body with a tiny glaze of cap. Smell is sweet and corny. Taste is similar but fairly weak and easy to ignore. Mouthfeel is likewise unmemorable. It is clean and relatively smooth. Good in hot weather or if you want to tie one on at a frat party."
"Taste is almost non existent. I must say, you could conceivably drink a few of these as they go down like water."
"Poured a 12oz can into my ""United We Stand"" pint glass. This is my standard go to glass for really cheap beer. The appearance is definitely off for the style. While its the normal straw yellow, there is absolutely no head. Even with a vigorous pour, I couldn't get much more than just a thin layer of white bubbles at the top that quickly disappeared. The aroma is a bit sour. There is a odd off smell to it that is kind of muddled with a bit off corn aroma with what reminds me of soy sauce. The taste is bland. There is really nothing over or under whelming in the flavor profile. The mouthfeel is really thin for the style with no hint of sharp carbonation. This beer is really just nothing, which is the worst part about it. I would rather have a beer that is just flat out horrible than this. I can honestly say that I will never drink another."
"I thought the beast was bad, but Milwaukee's Best takes the cake. A very pale yellow with a poor white head. The nose is of corn, rice and a few other things tht don't belong in beer. Taste is really bitter for a light beer. At least make you beer tasteless guys. The body is watery and I will probably never drink this again."
"There is nothing better than mowing the lawn on the hottest summber day and then slamming an ice cold MBL. There is nothing worse than snowblowing the driveway and having to choke down a MBL at any temperature. Don't ask me why it tase good in hot weather but that is the nature of the beast."
"Like others have said before me, this isn't a beer that was meant to be savored. It's a beer to drink to get smashed. Immediately after tasting this memories of keg parties from my college years came back...yes, it was exactly the same stuff. It's cheap, doesn't really taste great, but if someone was going to have 50+ friends and strangers in their house, would they spend major bucks for craft beer in a keg? (That would be pretty cool though)"
"It looks like nasty, tastes nasty, but has alot of memories as it was what I drank at parties in college. This is you standard light lager, it tastes like lightly watered hops, medium carbonation. Overall I won't be drinking this again, however I can't say it was any worse then any other light beer."
"Let me start of by saying this review won't help anybody. The ""Beast"" is what it is. This isn't the beer you bring to your girlfriends parents house to impress her dad. This beer requires everyone to turn of the beer snob and get blacked out, try to hook-up and then try to piece it all together the next morning. If you have to drink a light beer, this is as good as any. I am a little older and pretty much only drink dank beers now but I am not above drinking Beast in July with my old buddies. Go Flyers"
"D - Yet again I'm drinking this only because of beer pong this weekend and unless your playing drinking games its not worth it"
"D - This is not a good beer, even for a session or lawnmower beer. Drinking a couple one night did not make me feel good."
"Two ice cold cans poured into a small pitcher for an ""Anything but a cup"" themed party. Crystal clear light golden color, 3 fingers of fluffy white head that actually lasted a good while and left some good lacing--very surprised actually. Basically no smell or taste, very unoffensive which is generally what these beers aim for. Mouthfeel is very light and dry, good drinkability for those that, like me, are willing to lower their standards in the name of inebriation. Good for getting you drunk, not really anything to savor (except the surprisingly nice appearance), but it certainly gets the job done."
"Pale gold and stinky. Right off the bat we must mention that this beer has only one purpose. Drinking mass quantities at extremely low prices. This is the ultimate college campus beer. And considering its purpose it's not that bad. It's pale, no head, doesn't smell good, watery, tastes like nothing with a touch of maltyness, blah blah blah. That doesn't matter. It's ten bucks a 30 pack. 98 calories and 3.5 carbs a piece. with a decent 4.5% alcohol. It's tolerable enough. 18-23 years-olds across America Should love this beer. I did a dozen years ago. I miss those days."
"D- Drinkable as water- nothing bad, but nothing good to this one."
"Not much smell. Heck, not much taste either. While I can say the taste that this beer does has is not really objectionable, there's really not much there. It's just this side of water. Although I suppose it's drinkable if you were thirsty, but you could do much better."
"not the greatest beer ever and probably not in the top 1000 but it is a beer with exceptional drinkability. The appearance and smell are pretty poor but the mouthfeel and drinkability help a little. its a very cheap beer usually costing about 14-15 bucks. not good for sipping, only for college parties where you wanna get a cheap buzz."
"Went down really easy, could easily drink a 12 pack if somebody wanted to"
"I would never drink this beer again. The only reason why I have to is because my roommate looked at my profile on this site and saw that I haven't review Milwaukee's Best Light. There is a reason why I waited almost 2 years to drink this beer. It's shit. One of the shittest out there."
"Overall a lower-tiered light macro."
""
"overall this is an ok beer, decent drinkability because its so cheap and ice cold its dulled so much that its drinkable, maybe a lawn mowing beer"
"Drinkability: One could drink many of these if he did not desire flavor and complexity. I found it rather tasteless and boring."
"Drink-Ability: One of those cheap beers that has no purpose except to get you Crunk."
"Ya know overall I'd say one of the better cheap light's, I would still say suck up the extra 35 calories and go with regular Mil's Best."
"Clear golden green yellow body that has lots of bubbles from the carbonation. Head is short and white and has faded by the end of this sentence. Stinky wheat on the nose. Very clean and crisp as it enters the mouth. Super east to drink but lacks any flavor points that make it stand out from any other bmc product. Actually stands up well to slightly more costly mainstream bmc products for the price."
"Overall, this beer is a joke. The awful taste trumps any average appearance. No taste here, just swill, and not even refreshing at that. I'd rather drink Mich Ultra, at least it tastes like clean water instead of lead infested water. This beer almost makes me like poker less. Almost. Yet I know if anybody drinks this stuff at the table, they might as well hand me their wallet."
"Milwaukee's Best Light pours a typical macro yellow with a white head from a sixteen ounce can. Smells like cooked vegetables and corn. Taste is surprisingly sweet up front fading into corn. Not very good by any standard. I would rather pay a little more and get a decent lawnmower beer. This is really beer for frat boys only."
"i could drink this if i wanted to be cheap and get drunk."
"Clear medium straw with a medium, white, quickly diminishing head. Smells of corn and weak grain. Tastes like fizzy water with some adjunct beer flavor and a metallic finish. It has a thin body, watery texture and soda-like carbonation. Its really cheap and tastes it, but at least it wasnt that offensive... well, other than that they try to pass this off as beer."
"Beast light....what can you say? Pours a golden yellow with a medium sized head. Smells like cool urine with a hint of sweat. Taste almost instantly induces vomiting. Typical pilsner beer but worse. Doesn't go down smoothly at all. But is the most affordable beer out there and by that token it has some merit. Only drink this if you hate yourself and you want to stop enjoying the beer drinking experience."
"The beast lite is obviously not going to be to great of a beer. And it really looks like carbonated water. But once you move past that you realize that this isn't the worst beer in the world. Quite crisp with a smooth carbonation level. Won't fill you up at all. A slight sweetness comes and goes rather quickly. Refreshing but boring. Not terrible."
"Poured a pale yellow colow with large white puffy head that rapidly disappeared. Smell is slight anf barely noticeable, with maybe a slight sweetness and light beer aroma present. Taste follows through with a very light flavor, with little malt or hops present. Finishes refreshing, but little else. OK as a spacer."
"Note to Miller: Just because it's ""Brewed for a Refreshing, Smooth Taste"" does not mean that it is actually refreshing and/or smooth."
"It gains a point for drinkability only because it IS so easy to drink, and as a nod of respect to legions of college students that may subsist on this beer and others of a similar ilk. Though, to them I say: ""For God's sake, your metabolism is running high at this point in your life. Live a little and at least opt for the non-lite version!"""
"Notes  Make to be drunk quickly and from the can while not filling you up. It works, I used to drink a lot but its just not worth it. There are better light lagers, even the cheap stuff. Good only for drinking games."
"What can I say, for the price, $8/case this is not a bad beer. It tastes best in the summertime after working in the yard but overall it's not as bad as some of the other reviews. The color is a light gold with a mild smell and not much of a head when poured into a glass. I prefer the darker micro brews but when drinking the lighter lower cal beers the biggest difference between the hometown Bud Light and this beer is price, about half as much as Bud Light."
"Drinkability: Extremely light on the palate, so I could see someone going through several of these with ease. I find most of these macro lagers to be pretty indistinguishable. I'm glad I found a world of far better beers to enjoy. So long, Beast!"
"Can provided amid a bunch of stuff given to me for volunteering at 2005 GABF. Uhm, thanks guys, I really appreciate the opportunity. Stamp on the bottom reads 01026 E11862. Pours a two finger white and soda-like head over a clear pale straw orange liquid. The head settles stickily and is fed by a few streamers. Smells noticably malty sweet and with floral hop aroma. It's weak, but much stronger than I was expecting. The sweet is fairly non-descript. Corn and wet cardboard. The hops are light, like a Hallertauer. Tastes watery with a very mild sweet, pizza crust (imagine a really thin and cardboardy crust that's got no toppings), and a noticable hop flavor in the tongue. The hops come on stronger in the back of the throat during the aftertaste. Carbonation is only md-heavy, but still contributes a bit of sting to the flavor. Especially in the aftertaste, where it comes across as iron. thin body but with some dextrinous cling. Simple and much better than I was anticipating. I'd never buy this beer for my fridge, but I wouldn't turn one down. Judged to style, not my preferences."
"If they called this ""Alcoholic tonic water"" I'd buy it. Since they call it ""Beer", I won't. This has to be the king of Crush-the-can-on-your-forehead beers. It's basically a watery version of every American Macro ever made. Has a bit of residual sweetness, but of the cereal grain variety. It's faint flavors allow off flavors to shine: oxidized, metalic, papery, powdery... Other than the mild buzz, there is no pleasure in drinking this."
"Pours a crystal clear, extra pale straw. Three finger head that winds down in about two minutes. Good lacing and retention for a light lager. Grainy alcohol and tonic water smell. This beer tastes like club soda and rubbing alcohol, with weak pale malt in the background. Mild astringent aftertaste, but finishes mostly clean. No detectable hop taste or aroma. The lack of flavor leaves nothing to mask the alcohol, so it is made highly carbonated and light in body in an attempt to smoothen the mouthfeel. But flavor should never take a backseat to drinkability, even in a lighter style,"
"Anyways, this beer is not very good. I got it out of the keg. It's a really cheap beer that us college students can afford. Nonetheless, it poured a little darker than most light macro lagers. The smell was the same though. A little skunky, a little bit of that typical macro lager smell. The taste was pretty bad. I couldn't taste any hops or any barley. It just had that typical macro lager taste. I'll drink more of these in the future at parties I'm sure of, but I would not recommend buying this beer at a bar or at the store to sit down and enjoy."
"Okay, this one never should have been consumed, especially in large quantities. After enjoying some nice IPAs and pilsners, the guys got together to start playing beer pong with the Beast. Man, this may one the worst tasting beers at the time. All corn and grains with the tastes and smell, very overwhelming. Do not mix this after just finishing an IPA, it's like toothpaste and orange juice mix. I'm not dogging this because it's so cheap, it's just terrible. Drink Natty Light instead for the price."
"This is a beer for college students or raging alcholics that cannot differentiate between Beast Light and Iodine. Probably one of the worst, yet cheapest beers out there. The only good use this beer can be put to is drinking games like beer pong or flipcup, and to be honest even that is an overstatement. It has a very stale taste. I really do not even know how else to describe it other then awful."
"Overall: Would not recommand to anyone, not even college kids. Back in the day if someone made a brew this bad we beat them to death with their own shoes. You have to be drunk already to drink this stuff. Dull your senses before use."
"Now, if I must drink from the Milwaukee's Best family, this is going to be it. Pours out to a light golden color with medium carbonation and a short lived white head. Notes of corn, malt and hops are present in the aroma, but since it's a light beer, all aromas are quite light. Flavor is doable, but not by any standards great. Watery mix of corn and hops, this beer leaves quite a bit to be desired. Finished weak. No aftertaste to speak of. Worth a try, if you're daring and broke."
"Notes: Wow this is awful, at least it tastes than better it smells. I probably only had 1/3 of the can, and my stomach hurts."
"At the final bell, both beers are still standing, but are bloodied and bowed. In a hard fought contest, I have to give the edge to Milwaukee's Best Light simply because flavor trumps all else for me. MBL suffers in the appearance and mouthfeel categories, but makes up for it in the smell and taste arena. Let's face it, neither one is very drinkable and I'm glad that this thing has come to an end. Now please excuse me while I go eat something to try to make it up to my taste buds."
"Not much to distinguish it. Watery enough to quench a thirst. Not enough character to enhance a meal. Best left in the can and used (judiciously) when doing yard work or when that brother-in-law you hate stops by for a cold one."
"Went to a party tonight...this was what was served...popped about 10...if you rate this against the bottom of the barrel price beers it's above average..the best thing about it is it doesn't taste horrible (A ringing endorsement huh)..it has very little smell, body, or taste but it doesn't offend you...Like I told the wife just now..I had about 10 but don't feel affected much and would much rather have 3 good bock's instead. If I was looking for a beer that I could drink a ton of without it actually tasting bad this would be ok....A really watered down low taste beer that like I said doesn't offend, but lacks everything that is good about beer."
"Had this beer at my nieghbors place, and I must say it's crap. Has the smallest amount of flavor possible in a beer, and that flavor is mainly old corn. This truly is a sad excuse for a beer. No color, head, smell, or taste. The college kids can keep this one."
"The only thing that's actually a plus (besides the price) is the drinkability of the beer. Extreemly light and crisp."
"Overall-Beast light manages to be leaps and bounds better than Beast, I have no explanation for that. It is not a good beer by any means but when you are low on funds this beer is suprisingly acceptable and even somewhat refreshing on a hot day. It doesn't have much flavor even compared to Bud Light, Miller Lite, or Coors Light but at least it had some as opposed to Natural Light, which was like water. You know what your in for when ya get it, enjoy."
"Drinkability: Better than others in it's class because of it's complete lack of taste. A really miserable beer."
"Pours a very pale straw gold body beneath a full head of bright white foam that holds surprisingly well for the style and leaves some very nice, thin lace about the glass. Plumes of tiny bubbles race towards the surface indicating that it's fairly well carbonated. A generic beer aroma greets you in the nose with some mild, sweetish adjunct-laden malt, a spritz of hops, and a delicate waft of yeasty sulphur. The body is light and its fine-bubbled carbonation lends a gentle zest to the tongue. The flavor is limited, even for a light beer, but it's very well-balanced. It finishes almost without notice, leaving behind a trace amount of generic beer flavor that fades quickly. It's refreshing, but not very satisfying, and there are much better light beers available."
"Appearance: Fizzy yellow with a big overcarbonated white head dwindles quickly leaves behind specks of lacing. Aroma: Mild sweetness predominantly corn in there with a touch of grassiness possibly hops. Taste: A bit harsh offness grainy and not appetising in anyway, mild sweetness astringent corn adjuncts and weird grassy bitterness. Mouthfeel: Light bodied meant for chugging contests. Drinkability: Yes you can drink a case if you really wanted one of the worst hangovers of your life, and besides it looks the same on the way in as does going out."
"Beast is a beer for frat boys and people looking to get drunk for cheap. I won't go into specifics, tastes bad, smells bad, is bad. If your looking to get drunk on a budget or need to get massive groups of people drunk though, this is definatley the go-to beer. Otherwise, steer clear of this piss."
"My uncle invited my wife and I over for a barbeque and he had 3 choices of beer, (bud, Mil Best Ice, and Mil Best Light) Since I wanted to expand my pallete of beers tasted I went for the Milwaukee's Best Light. The apperance was light straw yellow and had a little fizzle for a head but not much. The smell was of light grain and corn. The taste while very watered down, wasn't putrid or sickening, but about what I expected. Felt flat but very refreshing in the mouth, drikable on a hot day like this one, it also went good washing down a few brats."
"F."
"I have probably had 100's of cans of this stuff in my lifetime, but don't cry for me. It is yellow and plain looking, with a white head. Taste is very weak, with no flavors except for corn, skunk, and cereal. It is cheap and plentiful, and it served it's purpose."
"Very clear light gold color, looked flat,few bubbles no head,a little whiff of malt and hop at the beginning, turned to a sour corn smell quickly.Thin adjunct malt taste,just a hint of sweetness all which evaporate quickly. Gave it a couple points because it had no aftertaste rather than a bad aftertaste. it sure says a lot about this nation that this beer is so popular"
"I'm going to break convention, and review this beer even though I have been to this site more than once. (shuddup man, BEAST rulez! I give it a 5.0 ! ) Take note, I am currently a college senior and I have been waltzing in craft brew wonderland for nearly a year. I now routinely buy $30 cases of interesting micros and actually find it painful to consume this and other $8/ case $35/ keg beers with my drunken cohorts on the weekends. Anyways, Beast is nothing special. Pours a very thin white head off the kegerator in my living room. Roomates insit upon it, even though I have swindled an occasional keg of Boston Ale or other closeout special in there. Light yellow color, stale grain nose, abdundant carbonation. Not as watery as other super cheap macro lights and certainly drinkable when served cold. Allow it to warm on a table while playing drinking games, and it becomes 'open your gullet and suck' drinkable. What can one say? There's a market for this beer, and it is enjoyed by many. I wish I could enlighten some of these folks and show them the pleasures of a weizenbock or an imperial stout, but alas, beer appreciation is something that one arrives at on his own accord. Cheers to all, and enjoy your drink, whethter it be a plastic cup of Beast light or a goblet of Westvleteren 12."
"Once in a while a random can of cheap beer appears in my fridge, whose origns remain unknown. This can of Beast Light is an example of such. It poured a bright, clean pale yellow. The small head fizzled away in no time. Very bubbly. A harsh, rather astringent smell of stale hops was present. The taste was of weak weak hops, and a hint of watered-down malt base. The beer finished rather dry, with no aftertaste, which was a bit of a relief. I can only imagine what the aftertaste might have been. Mouthfeel was a bit like club soda...the artificial carbonation was on prominent display. This beer's great for college parties and keggers, and I suppose it's one of the least terrible macro light beers. But I wouldn't recommend it if you like to enjoy what you drink."
"Notes: At $7.99 a 30 pack what do you expect, cured my thrist on a hot day but then I had to switch to an other beer."
"Taste is nothing special but decent for the price. If you are into this kind of stuff, i suggest it. It is affordible and drinkible - a recipie for disaster!"
"you can drink it, and people do cuz they can afford it. it is better than coors and anh-busch shit, but it is still cheap american light beer. you can put them down for a night, but i'd highly recommend to have a few good beers first"
"The stuff is drinkable and can be refreshing I suppose, but there are better light beers out there (if you have to drink a light).  I'm a college guy, and even I won't make a regular habit out of this stuff."
"Two Thumbs down!!"
"Update 11/2005: Uh, there is now an ad campaign for Beast Light. It's kind of entertaining, but it does push a misguided macho agenda, IMO. So, if you live in the universe of this commercial, you'd better have quick reflexes as you pour yourself a Duvel or Chimay at your buddy's Super Bowl party lest you be crushed by a giant can of the Beast for being less than a ""real man""."
"This reminded me of rancid water.  I am not kidding.  It had a very unsetlling metallic taste that on the finish reminded me of dirty water.  This one isn't good.  For girl's dorms, soriority house and for old ladies named Mabel."
"Ah, Beast light. ""Classic Taste at its best""....Not really, but around here it is the cheapest 30 case around, so I have spent more money on this than any other beer. It gets us all as wasted as we want to be for a minimum price. It's extremely carbonated, and has often been known to make people run around naked and pee on things. Not a great beer, but hey, you get what you pay for. Regardless, I am having one right now."
"back in my youthful days this was the swill of choice because it was cheap and went down like silk and got us where we wanted to go. of course now, i don't drink it. but i picked up a single to review and can honestly say this one of the few lagers where the light version is much better than the ""heavy"" version. smells pretty disgusting (adjuncts) but the taste is pretty tame and really doesn't offend too much. pretty watered down but i'd say it's a better light beer than most others."
"I find it difficult to say much of substance about Milwaukee's Best Light.  Nothing distinguishes it as being terrible or excellent.  I suppose that mediocre will do.  Rather bubbly at the start, though the head will disappear within a minute or two.  Cheap and perfectly suitable for making a lager and lime and a reasonable choice to offer to friends who are not connoisseurs of fine beers."
