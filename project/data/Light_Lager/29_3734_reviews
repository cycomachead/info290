"It is beer and rather shitty at that."
""
"Overall- This beer is for yardwork, fishing or heavy session drinking.  with that said it ain't bad for those events."
""
""
""
"My favorite light macro. Doesn't say a lot."
"Awfullly bland.  No taste at all. Might as well drink carbonated water."
""
"This is really not that bad. It tastes like water but I don't mind that, sometimes I just need a beer that doesn't have a strong flavor. I like the bottle design too. This is overall not a bad choice, definitely better than Bud Light."
""
"My go to beer when looking for low carbs"
"I don't know why this beer gets knocked all the time, if you want a low carb/light beer with a decent taste and a higher than 3% volume this is it."
""
""
""
""
""
"Not as bad as some of these reviews would indicate. I'm not a ABI or MillerCoors fan at all but when I'm at someone's house for a barbecue and its hot and humid as hell this isn't a bad choice. Time and place I suppose."
"This is the beer I go to when I just want to get a cold, refreshing buzz without the bitterness of full flavor beer or the alcohol kick of liquor. Not much going for it in terms of character. I drink carbonated water daily and this simply feels like a hoppy, alcoholic version of that. I would say that it's deceptively strong for its watered down taste."
""
"I am a fan of domestic light beer, and this is my goto.  The bros insist waitresses card me when I order, claiming you can't order Ultra unless you are under 21.  But I can't help myself, this is what I like.  I can drink these all night with no damage.  If you like flavor or a buzz, stay away - this aint THAT brew.  This is for guys like me who harvest flavor from the enchiladas, and seek refreshment from my brew."

"Unbiased, this was honestly the worst experience I have ever had drinking beer in my life. I'd rather pour this down the drain than finish one. Probably the worst beer I have ever had."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a near translucent yellow with little to no head. The scent had a bit of rice on it but nothing much. The taste was terribly mild with only some rice in the beginning. Not a fan."
""
""
"Might be the worst beer to date. No taste. Better off drinking a glass of water"
""
""
""
"awful beer, cheap price, cheap taste"
"My mom drinks this swill. No thanks"
"Super light but clean.  Perfect for a hot day on the golf course."
"Watered down bud light is the taste of this urine"
""
"My favorite light domestic beer."
"Horrible, thanks but no thanks"
""
""
""
"Overall, I like the taste andcontent.  Seems to be a bit pricy to have around for a regular beer."
""
""
""
"Great light beer to enjoy without the calories. Smooth with lower alcohol content than other beers.  Just a good beer to have onhand."
"I can actually enjoy a bud light or miller lite.. And i do more often then most on this website I'm sure.. Was left 10 from 18 pack I got from are room neighbor while on vacation at the beach.. We ran outa bud and started on these.. This has got to be the worst beer in ever tasted.. When people say that bud or miller light have no taste I roll my eyes a little because they maintain some kind of beer flavor.. This stuff is pure water no sweetness no bitterness nothing I tasted more from the side of can.. Which makes it even more nasty since it makes this water taste like metal.. Worst beer in ever had."
""
""
"Most ""watered down"" beer I've ever had."
"Looks great, but not a lot of taste very watery but very drinkable and pretty much everyone will drink it."
"very clean and refersing very l;ight"
"no taste at all. I don't understand why they still make this."
""
""
""
"This is what you drink when you've been drinking so much beer that your belly is starting to show it.  It's also relatively inexpensive.  It's not fantastic.  You're not going to sing alabanzas.  But it's not bad for a light beer."
"Pours a nice golden color but no head whatsoever and very light carbonation. Smells like every other adjunct lager. A lot of carbonation going down and more flavor than most like beers. So far my second favorite light lager after Busch light.....if i had to choice. Favorite...using the term lightly that is."
""
"Not very bad, not very good."
"Very light with a faint taste"
""
"Ice  cold not bad. Tastes sweet."

"This used to be one of my favourite beers when I didn't like the bitterness, I went back to taste it again, well, definitely is not something precious, but I don't think that is so bad as the scores here, it might just be for different kind of drinkers, yes, it's actually too soft and almost like drinking water, but there are some people who like this kind of beer, so if you like it go for it."

"Wow, this place is loaded with snobs. Beer enthusiasts are getting bad raps because of haters that crap on everything that isn't 100 ibus. Beer is beer, folks are getting snobbier than the wineos at my restaurant. It's a cheap, clean beer meant to be drank out of a can, on the golf course, around a fire, or just when you dont feel like sinking 12-16 bucks on a six pack. It is what it is beer snobs."

"I am not sure why people dislike it so much. For 20 bottles it was 12$. Great buy. It is a great beer to relax and drink with. It does the trick but it has decent quality and taste when you compare it to other light beers in the same price range. It has a sweet taste that doesn't linger."

"Look, I love beer. So if I'm offered one I will probably take it. But I would buy natural ice before I bought this stuff. Hey, at least nattie ice will give you a buzz with the 5.9% abv. I once drank 30 mich ultras during a canoe trip and wasn't even drunk at the end.  If you want to have something in your hand, but don't want taste or to get drunk...this is the beer for you."

"Overall - I'm usually a bit of a snob. But for a light beer, this one has some character.  Its not offensive - and even though Coors Light and Miller Lite taste better, this is better than Bud Light by a mile. Give it a fair shot, you might even like it."

"if ""pooft"" was a beer style, this would be the beer that epitomized the style. I could have sworn I was drinkiing something akin to kiwi or grape seltzer water (not sure why I was getting fruity smells and tastes from this beer, but I was). I guess if you technically stretch the definition of beer far enough, it could conceivably be possible to include this beverage, but I'm not sure why you'd want to. Should be marketed as some sort of wine cooler thing because beer it really ain't. This beer is proof that if you spend enough time building a brand, people will buy almost anything. Lucky for me this can was a freebie which I attempted to consume for the purposes of doing a review. I finished slightly more than half, I thought that was doing pretty good."

"I'm diabetic with high triglycerides...not supposed to drink beer or whiskey, on both counts. From more healthy days, WAY back, my top three beers were Warsteiner, Becks, and Michelob Light. I'm not supposed to drink ANY beer, but I sneak one every month or so. So far, the only beer that doesn't impact my physical conditions (on a ONE beer serving only basis) is Michelob Ultra. Admittedly, it doesn't have the qualities of a Warsteiner or a Becks (which would now yield me ""Alley Oop"" ankles, on one serving) but it does compare favorably (for me) to Michelob Light, my favorite American beer. Ultra is not one of my top three beers, but if I want to avoid painful swelling in my ankles & lower legs while enjoying a single beer a month...it is my ONLY beer and I am truly grateful for it. It is enjoyable, and that's what it's now all about, for me!"
"O - I hadn't had a Michelob Ultra in a long time and now I remember why. I did some investigation among the party guests who were drinking a fair amount of the stuff and got the typical ""I don't like the stuff you drink"" answer. Oh well, to each his own."

"I don't review beers too often...but somehow I came across this on BA and memories of drinking the worst beer I've ever had were conjured up. It was a few years ago when this beer was released. A few friends of mine gathered at a local pub. The Michelob Girls showed up with free shirts and beer in buckets full of ice. They gave us all free bottles to try, and the funny thing is...after tasting the Michelob Ultra, we all ended up tossing the free Michelob and buying our own real beer. Avoid this if you enjoy beer with substance, flavor and soul."

"After lengthy test of human endurance, man prefers to be rewarded with this magnificent brew. Cans are the prefered container due to their low weight for packing on a cycling, sailing, or skiing adventure. The slender size makes the cans perfect for packing into ones jeans. Optimally cans can be inserted through the front zipper stashed in the jeans above the ski boots. The cans are often purchased by the ""30"" as they are assorted into a beautiful suitcase. In ones hands delicate fingers wrap effortlessly to ensure a tight grip. The feeling of holding a slender tall yet athletic can can only be compared to the exhilarating feel of yachting on the mediterranean after a grueling cycle through the dolomites. The taste is world renowned. Some have compared the taste to that of a very young yet well fed flamingo, oh how delicious they are. After consumption the body feels a great pleasure which has no equal. The smell brings ill prepared man to his knees for it is unrivaled. As the beer slides down a man's throat he oft not forget how powerful each day he breathes earths air can be."

"A decent beer for the style. I enjoyed my bottle for what it was, and it did help pouring in the glass instead of drinking from a bottle as is typically done with this style."

"A Low Carbohydrate beer regarded by Yuppies as a Reward. Has a very pale yellow appearance which culminates in a flavor profile of some light malt meets corn, and a slightly watery note of virtually no hops to balance out the water flavor. Tastes to me like seltzer water with a very slight hint of Michelob Light, itself no beer of character. With the slightest hint of a floral grain note. I'd much rather drink a sip of a real lager beer or ale which is decent than this horrid swill if I had to watch carbs and calories. To me, this is punishment, not a reward after a hard workout. I regard this as a beer insult even to low end BMC swill. So, you have a low rating. For many of us, this would take a dozen to not make you want more. So, horrid value for the money. So, please look elsewhere for a light lager and drink fewer and be happier. Ultra Swill I call this."

"Pours a clear super light yellow with a foamy off-white head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Small streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is watery with some malt, grain, corn, and vegetal aromas. Taste is much the same with watery and bland sweet grain, corn, and vegetal flavors on the finish. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a horrible beer that is barely drinkable with it's sweet and vegetal aromas and flavors."

"Pours a straw-yellow like cider with a very small white fizzy head that doesn't last long. Some very light spotty lacing was seen but very little. High carbonation hence all the tiny bubbles every where. The aroma is not too much really, just a light grain. The taste was almost like seltzer water with really no flavor. Slight metallic taste as well for some reason."

"O = a sad remnant of the low-carb craze that spawned this beer, if you could even call it a beer. fizzy, flavorless, and devoid of character."
"i drank three of these things over a month period and tried to give the brew as fair a shake as possible in terms of a review. each time, all i taste is lemon water and about halfway into each one, it took a lot of energy not to drain pour it. just awful. not a good session beer, not good for a barbecue, not good for anything that a good cold glass of water can't give you equally (minus the alcohol)."
""
"This beer is what it is. Its an extremely light light beer. Drink enough of them, you'll get drunk. Eventually. I first started drinking it because my friend was a fitness guru and was strict about his calorie intake. And yet to this day, it is my go-to light beer. When I want to get drunk, I'm going for this. If I'm going to just enjoy a beer with a full meal, I'm going with a quality non-light beer. To me, Ultra is in a class above Miller Lite, Coors Light, and Bud Light. Honestly, this beer is best enjoyed on a hot day or golfing or if you are trying to lose weight but don't want to throw your entire day's worth of calories out with a couple beers. I do think this beer gets a bit of a bad reputation by people that just discard it as a ""chick beer"" or ""beer-flavored water"". If you're drinking it, you have to realize that it is what it is. If you want mountains of flavor, this isn't the beer for you. However for a light beer I do think this one has a great taste. If you are debating whether to try it or not because you're afraid your manhood will be questioned, just try it for yourself and form your own opinion."

"I can think of a few reasons why beer drinkers might reach for a Michelob Ultra. It's a fine choice for beer drinkers who are counting calories and carbohydrates. Its crispness and wateriness are welcome characteristics on very hot afternoons. The thinness of its malt profile minimizes the nasty ""skunk"" flavors of American macro-lagers, making Ultra comparatively enjoyable. Indeed, I'd reach for a Michelob Ultra before any of the ""big three"" (Coors, Miller, Budweiser) or their light counterparts."

Drank about half of it while watching the sox game and the rest went warm. Eventually dumped it out and got a glass of water, which was much more satisfying and had just about as much flavor.

"This is nowhere near the worst beer out there, even in the light beer category. I found it pleasant enough to consume, and pretty terrible to smell. Most people who drink this probably don't pour it into a glass, so smell isn't something they are thinking about. I would not be buying this again, however, if I was in the situation of drinking light beer I know I'd be safe with this one."

"Clear nearly transparent yellow colored brew. White fizzy short lived head. Aroma of dry cereal grains, namely corn and rice with some malt. There is a small note of grass. In the flavor, grain driven sweetness with a flash of mildly bitter hop that was a surprise. The flavor is quite light and goes away quickly. Watery, over carbonated body. Not the greatest beer here. My friend saw me drinking a bottle of this and grabbed it out of my hand and threw it into the back yard. I'd consider him a good friend and an even better person."

"*Sigh* Am I one of ""those"" guys? Who hates every light beer? I hope not. I hope there's one thing out there that tickles my fancy enough that I don't cringe when hearing its name. This is now one of the former. Here is what this beer gives you: 90-something calories. The refreshing taste of ice cold water beer. Is that what they are going for? Probably. And that sucks. As a beverage, I guess it isn't half bad. It's meant, I suppose, to be drunk out of the bottle but I refuse. As a beer, it's bad. It's almost a non-beer. Don't recommend it. Get drunk on low-calorie liquor if that's what you want."

"Overall: Maybe the worst light beer I have tried. It barely had any taste."

"O - I'd say Mich Ultra is actually a better beer than the typical BMC fare, if only because it is so devoid of flavor that it avoids all the bad flavors. Definitely more drinkable on tap than Bud (for my tastes)."
""
""
"O: Yeah overall, this is disgusting. Someone brought a case over to a barberque at my place and I've been struggling on how to deal with them besides pouring them down the toilet. Been using them as a base to cook chili, pretty much the only thing they're good for. Not recommended and should be discontinued."
"Really not going to snob out on this beer. It really is designed for those who are watching their weight or have other health concerns. That said, is it a thin-tasting macro lager that doesn't leave the taste buds satisfied? Of course! But, is it undrinkable? Of course not. Less of a fullness that the ordinary American Adjunct Lager but decent for what it is."

"The only instances in which I've been able to tolerate - I didn't say condone! - Michelob Ultra have been at a ballpark where the beer selection is so poor as to make a bad 'light' beer preferable to bad standard-strength brands. It is after all, among its few positive qualities, one of the most bland things I've ever tried. Summed up in two words: adult pop."
""
"Overall – It is very light and moderately refreshing and hence it fits many of the categories that a light beer should. It doesn’t have a great flavor profile however with some slightly off flavors (especially toward the end of the taste). Light- yes, but super tasty – no."

"Overall: I've drank this a few times now. I'm Canadian and where I'm from this beer was unavailable till a couple months maybe a year ago. I'd had it in the states before this and found it appalling. Much to my dismay it reared it ugly head in our neck of the woods. I drink it when I'm offered it at parties and get togethers and could see it being sessionable but I don't really enjoy the experience."
"O: Easy to drink but definitely not a beer that I will be getting again - limited selection at the airport lead to trying this one... It is too thin and too watery to really be enjoyable."

"Michelob ultra's Biggest competition is obviously Budweiser select. Both beers come in at right under 100 cal, and are intended to win over the weight-conscious crowd. I personally am trying to drop about 40 pounds, and so I tend to buy these watered-down diet adjunct beers on occasion. Michelob ultra is the best of these kinds of beers. It taste like a light beer, but it's an ultra light. Not great, but not horrible."
"Ordered this from Applebee's, draft, 16 oz glass. Appearance is extremely light, pale straw colored yellow; clear as water and almost as light. Lots of bubbles continue to rise from the bottom to the surface; the head is almost non existant, no lacing but a soap like bubblineess. Smell is sweet corn and malts. Taste is sour and tart, light and watery, no discernible taste of hops or grains. I assume what I am tasting are the adjuncts; rice and corn. Mouthfeel is similar to soda water. This is a beer that you drink when you don't want to take any sort of enjoyment from the beer drinking experience, but then again no one drinks this for its taste. It's ""diet"" beer, but the low alcohol and crappy flavor nullify the fact that its lower calorie because you would have to drink several of these just to get a buzz, thereby equaling the calories you'd consume from drinking a quality beer. Basically It's what you drink when tap water isn't quite alcoholic enough for you."

"there is worse tasting beers out there, but only because this can scarcely be considered beer. it doesnt taste much like anything. it pours lighter than piss, about as clear as my tap water, with soda carbonation yet zero head. the nose is offensive old apple juice and malt extract watered down way past a reasonable level. the taste is nonexistant, less taste than any other beer ive ever put in my mouth, its downright absent. no body at all, too many bubbles, what is the point of this? if you want to cut carbs, dont drink beer at all, or skip the cereal in the morning, but dont shave away the elements that makes a beer a beer, this is an assualt on brewing, and something i never want to see in my fridge again. damn my old man, who thinks he can get skinny on this shit!"

"I like this beer when its like 100 degrees out. Or when I need to cleanse my palate. Other than that, I don't understand this beer, but its not bad. Just watered down. Which is bad. Hmmm. Its somewhere between bad and watered down."

"For a low carb beer with 90 something calories it isn't a horrible choice for cats on a diet. I like to drink them during the week because they don't jack you up and your not killing yourself with late night carbs. That being said I would never order one at a restaurant and short of the principle listed above would probably never drink one other than that."

"I appreciate good beer, giving dogfish head 90 minutes IPA a 5/5, but i'm dissapointed to see such low reviews for Mic Ultra. Exactly what did the reviewers expect? This is as advertised: a very light, low carb beer for an active summer (or other season) day when the drinker does not want to feel weighted down/bloated but wants to enjoy a beer. No, this is not the finest craft beer on the planet, but it does not pretend to be. It does not sell itself beyond its label."
""
"Overall - This really isn't a beer.. I've never seen a beer that was such a light shade of yellow. The taste is extremely light and the mouthfeel is like a seltzer/soda. Not sure why I picked this one up.. curiosity got the better of me."
""
""
""
""
"My advice? Stay away, unless you carb watchers are desperate for a beer-flavored beverage."
"This is that beer. It's about as interesting as drinking a box of styrofoam chips. If you want to drink something low calorie at least go for some Clausthaler Amber. This beers angle just makes no sense to me. It is drinkable, and easy, but for flavor and experiences why would I even bother to have this again?"
""

"Certainly of the most flavorless beers around, very watery. But still easier drinking/slightly more enjoyable than your light Coors, Busch, Bud, etc."
""

"This poured with nearly no head and a pale yellow color. Virtually without scent it has actually has alight easy drinking taste. Lets face this is an alcohol delivery system for people who want less carbs and calories. I must admit that if I intend to get intoxicated and not be filled up this is the easiest drinking beer I can think of."
"Overall: Refreshing and good after getting hot and thirsty. Easy to drink. If you want something with flavor you need to try something else."
""
""
""
""
"Not quite sure exactly what the purpose is of this beer. Yes it's one of the best selling in the world and yes, it probably makes A-B boat loads of money but literally it's like drinking nothing. No texture, no taste, no smell, no flavor, nothing. Just yellow'ish, watery, hop swill. I shall forever pass on it."

"Poured this Light Lager from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. Poured a pale yellow color, produced a small amount of head, poor retention and left only a small amount of lace on the glass. The aroma consists of cooked corn and cereal. Light in body, this brew has very little grain flavor, it tastes more of water then it does beer. There is only a ever so slight amount of hop bitterness. Dry finish. Overall one of the most boring,non flavorful beers that i have ever tried."

"This is a light bodied brew with a moderate amount of carbonation. It is pretty much void of any real character which I guess is fitting for the style. If you want a beer that tastes as little like beer as possible, by all means go tank a case of this and throw a couple limes in the neck of the bottle just for shits. Not recommended."
"overall, complete waste of time. the only thing it has going for it is that it's not actively repulsive. this one was offered to me and i accepted having never had it. don't waste your time."

"The main question on my own mind is why AB would even bother trying to bring this into the bloated Canadian light beer market. Maybe to siphon off some Coors drinkers? I guess that could happen - but these beers are all so indistinguishable from one another that I would think MU is just as likely to steal sales from Bud Light as it is from Coors. Like the beer itself, it seems like a pointless endeavour."

"Superior light beer? In my part of California it sure comes at a premium price. For those looking for low calorie, low carb beer, this works well. It is well made, but just lacks any real character. This really seems like a beer aimed at people who don't like beer. AB's other beers in this category have a lot more going for them, even the ""value"" brands."

"This beer is mostly for people looking to lose weight and still want to drink. The color is light yellow. Not much to it. One thing that surprised me about this beer is its taste. It's really really smooth. I put 6 of these away with ease. The after taste of this beer is what I really enjoyed. It's not harsh at all. Very smooth all the way through. For those watching their weight i suggest you give this a try."

"I had this beer over the weekend at a parry. Poured a pale straw yellow with a fizzy head that died almost immediately. Aroma was non-existant. Taste was minimal corn and adjunct with a slight bitter finish. This was my first and last time to drink this beer."

"Pours from the 12oz bottle a rather acceptable golden hue with a foamy head that settles into a medium collar. Carbonation is lively, but not over-active. Aroma is of sweet, wet grass clippings. 1st sip is of club soda mixed with a splash of light beer. Mouthfeel is light and watery with a lively fizz from the bubbles...again, like club soda. Drinkability is high, but then so is that of...club soda. Overall, this beer was given to me for free and I still feel like I got ripped off. If you're that concerned about you calorie & carb intake, have a Diet Coke instead. Oh well, it was good for adding another rating."

"I really hate to rate a beer this low, I actually feel bad about it. But honestly this beer is just this bad. The beer came in a glass and it was so light I legitimately thought it was seltzer water! The lack of aroma and taste only make it worse. I have never in my life seen a beer with this much carbonation either. Once again, I hate to rate a beer this bad, but this beer is just ridiculous. Had a cute girl I was hitting on not bought this for me, I would have just poured it into the sewer."

"Overall, well... It's not quite a drain pour, but it certainly isn't something I'd ever want to drink again. I'll give this beer some credit though for at least having some flavor and aromas, even though they aren't all that pleasant."
"On the only reason to drink this swill : It has virtualy no carbs! I had this at my son's home; he specificaly bought it because he just started the Atkins Diet. Although, at 4.2 it is not low alchohol."
"The beer is clear piss yellow and have a massive carbonated head. The smell has a slight corn smell with a tiny bit of grain. The taste is terrible. I just get nothing at all from this beer. I dont get how anybody can drink this stuff. I had to use like 10 limes to kill the flavor and make it a little drinkable. I just dont know what to even say about this beer, but it is beyond horrible. I just feel that it offers nothing at all and it is one of the worst beers I have ever had."
"Drink- When my stone IPA ran out, I had no choice at a friends house. I let him drink my beer, but Ill try not to have to drink this again"
"O) How does my aunt drink this..."
"O: While the flavor wasn't really good, it wasn't offensive. I suppose that counts as some sort of moral victory."
"I would avoid drinking this beer in the future. Very bad beer."
"I call this beer MC ULTRA, after the u.s. government’s brainwashing experiments in the 70s (codename: MK ULTRA). In part because I figure you must be brainwashed to drink this! There’s no aroma, no flavor, really, there’s nothing to this beer. As blasphemous as this sounds you’d be better off mixing a craft beer with sparkling water if you wanted a low-calorie alternative with flavor. Otherwise it’s just not worth it. Don’t drink it!"
"The aroma had just a light scent of grain and the faintest whiff of hops. The flavor was the same, just a bit weaker. The body was very thin, even considering the style. The beer was easily drinkable, but so is water. Overall, this is a decent example of the style. It would probably make a decent electrolyte replacement beverage after some hard work or play. But as a beer, why bother? It has all the peeing with none of the fun."
"Poured a 2"" white soap suds head which faded really fast. Clear straw yellow color. Faintest little grass smell. Taste is kind of like dirty seltzer water. So THIS is 95 calories? You're better off drinking plain clean water than this seltzer water out of a dirty glass."
"O - If you are actually drinking this beer while dieting, I'm sure it would be fine for you, but if you are looking for a tastey sessionable light lager, this is something very worthy of a session, but very much lacking in the flavor department."
"It pours a light straw color with a very quickly fading bright white head with lots of bubbles. The smell is of grass and grain. It is very smooth, watery with the taste of grass and grain. The mouthfeel is decent with lots of nice bubbles, very light body and very smooth. A very drinkable beer, but just no flavor. If you're spending the day on a boat then this beer works, otherwise leave it alone."
"You can't get much lighter then a Mic Ultra. The color is quite clear and the foam fades away quite quickly. The smell and taste are not too spectacular/there isn't much of either. I would take a Bud Light over this however Ultras or not bad on a hot summer day. They don't fill you up or weigh you down. If you ever get that ""uggh, I just drank a fat beer"" feeling, you won't get that here. It goes down and feels like water in your belly."
"O: Mass produced garbage. I am glad it was a free sample. Not the best, but hey, it's still beer."
"O: Basically a water with few ingredients thrown in. Its only saving grace is that it is refreshing, but only because it is essentially water."
"O: Its just slightly more engaging than drinking water. If you had a choice, this isnt the worst example of the light lager style, but it doesnt have anything going for it. Its a run of the mill average beer in the mix with huge macro beers that ussually will run marketing circles around it. But, its better than the big macro lights, but not by much."
"If you want a light beer... Drink Miller Lite. Weak light beer. Boring by all means."
"Garbage at best. Ugly Champagne bubbly color with 1 finger same color head that receded quickly leaving no film to speak of. It looked like a light beer, drank like a light beer and tasted like water with a side of bland bread. It had a boring and long lasting bad mouth feel that was even unpleasant to think about even today."
"Basically seltzer water, thin and watery with a prickly, rough carbonation. This is one of the sorriest excuses for beer I've ever tasted, and the complete lack of flavor is enough to make Bud Light seem like Dark Lord. If you're on a diet, drink water, not this."
"The next cheap beer available this last week at the beach. This one compliments of my brother-in-law and his wife. Can poured into a glass (not sure why I bothered). I thought the Bud I recently had was the palest beer out there, but this one is even paler. Looks like honey-water. No head at all. Nose is weak with grains and butter. The mouth is crisp - its only redeeming quality. The flavor, if you can call it that, is muted with flavors of hay, faint citrus. I dropped a lime in the last half of this bad boy to help my finishing it. I'd rather have water."
"I'm not going to bother keeping these things around anymore."
"Overall, this is a boring barely beer."
"If you're trying to cut your carbs, you might as well just buy a case of bottled water. Pours a very pale color between straw and clear, with some carbonation, and a thin layer of bubbles on top. Not much in the nose; some faint stale grain noticeable. Same on the tongue, with barely any noticeable taste, other than stale grain, skunk, and what could be conceived as a hop. Extremely light and watery, and goes down the same. To be avoided."
"As they say - it is what it is - a low calorie light lager. I thought a lot of the calories in beer were from the alcohol - but this beer will make you think the calories were in the flavor - because this beer has no taste. Way too much carbonation and little substance. Don't reach for this beer unless you are on a diet - even then you may just want to have water instead."
"Overall - Just a very bland beer. I didn't find anything offensive about it really, it just provided nothing to speak of."
"d - could probably drink quite a few of these and not even notice, but that's the point isn't it? if this were my only option for booze i'd just stay sober."
"Overall, unless you completely dislike the taste of beer, avoid this gimmicky, unsatisfying, overpriced garbage in a can. The only good thing I can say about it is that there is no repulsive flavor which is not hard to accomplish when there is no flavor at all."
"D- Not my beer."
"O - Epic fail. I've never been a fan of ""light"" beer. The only time I ever drank a steady supply of it was because we were playing drinking games in college, and you could plow through an 18 pack and still drink more after the game. I would usually opt for Coors Light, but really any light beer would work. This one is a big step below even those beers. The only thing going for this beer is that it is ""low carb"" however, I've never seen anyone just drink one or two of these. People finish the 12 pack, which really doesn't make it a low carb beer."
"RJT"
"D-how drinkable is water? you can drink a lot of it with out being grossed out but it isn't enjoyable."
"Drinkability: I'd actually prefer water. Although water does not have an alcohol content, it also does not have calories. If you're watching your calories and trying to get drunk, Miller light seems like a better option."
"Man, if only I knew when I was younger how bad this beer was I wouldn't have ordered it one my first venture to a local bar when I turned 21. Had a Guinness prior to this and this brew wasn't going to overcome that by any means. It was like drinking Seltzer after the Guinness."
"This is one of those beers that I've had once and did not have it again. It really has not taste or enticing aroma. The look of it is also not impressive. I do not condone drinking this beer unless you are a true weakling. Drink a real beer instead."
"The CPJ"
"Serving type: bottle"
"Horrific beer."
"Avoid unless you're a poor college student. Even then, I'd drink soda ahead of this one."
"D: I used to actually drink a lot of these, before I respected beer. They aren't even refreshing to me any more, I'm really having to choke this down. This doesn't really deserve the label ""beer."""
"OK, I suppose, as a cold beer-like refreshment with a meal or to quench one's thirst. Poor substitute for a real beer."
"Absolutely the worst beer I've ever had. It can hardly be called beer. The taste is like if someone took half a bottle of water and added another half bottle of bud light to it. The only upside would be the drinkability. I would rather drink a non-alcoholic beer than this."
"D: Well damn, you could swallow it like water, but it's not very flavorful. It has some alcohol content but very little. It's pretty disgusting overall. I would definitely pass on it."
"D - Wouldn't be too tough to drink several of these, but there are better tasting light beers out there."
"the mouthfeel is extremely light and due to the lack of flavor its really not all that appealing or drinkable, unless you want an off tasting carbonated water"
"Pours a clean pale yellow with a small white head. It actually looks watery. In the aroma, sweet corn and faint ints of a standard macro lager. In the taste, sweet pear like and a watered down version of a mass produced lager. A smooth and light bodied mouthfeel, with a small dry hint of fruit. Sweet and watery. If you are worried about calories, don't drink."
"D- Not very. Most of Michelob products I have to give higher drinkability than I want to towards the overall average but this is like bad tonic water. Nothing enjoyable about it."
"Mouthfeel/drinkability- light body and decent carbonation however the aftertaste and taste in general make this beer nearly undrinkable."
"D- Hey it a beer to go to town on... I can respect that."
"AVOID"
"Thought I would revisit this long lost aquaintence, and was of course disappointed in myself. Clear as water, watery pale yellow color. Can't believed I never noticed how colorless this was. Thin white ring around edge of glass. Aroma smells like cantaloupe rhine. Moderate carbonation. Very light all the way through, light rhiney taste for maybe a second or too, not really much flavor. Some flavor in the middle but not much other than that. Now I know why these were so easy to bong, as close to water as you can get."
"Mouthfeel / Drinkability: This is the most watery beer I have ever sampled. No taste, no smell, stinging carbonated water so you know this has got to be some drinkable beer. Yummy!"
"D: I would rather drink tap water. This beer is completely futile. It doesn't taste bad - it doesn't taste like anything. Why waste money on a product that has nothing to offer? To create the perception that you're taking care of your physique and/or being responsible by choosing low calorie, faddish, flavorless macro swill? I'll pass."
"Pours a pale yellow straw color with a thin white head and a little lacing. Smells of corn and some grain, maybe a little malt. Tastes of sweetness from the malts, and clean crisp from a lack of anything else other than water. Mouthfeel is really thin. Drinkability is okay."
"The mass market is full of light beers, and this Michelob Ultra fits in with most of them. Not many calories, not much taste. This bottle has a born on date and I am well within the freshness date so I can't attribute any of the beer characteristics to being old. The pour resulted in a little head that was gone in seconds, leaving a ring with light lacing. The color is light amber, rating a 2 on the SRM chart. So far this is the lightest colored beer I have rated. Not much to smell, a little malt and yeast, maybe some corn. Tastes like sweet malt, and corn, but very little flavor at all. Mouthfeel is like water, it guess that is because it is mostly water, leaves my mouth feeling dry. Because I drink a beer for the flavor and this one doesn't have much of one, I will stay far away from this brew."
"Pours foamy then dissipates. Smells of chemistry class and despair. Tastes like lack of self-esteem. Eats hope. I do wish it were able to clean drains. What to do with the other five bottles otherwise? Somehow salty. Perhaps we can start rumors about ingredients. ""What's that you say is in the soylent, Charlton? ... No, the green one."""
"Pours with the tiniest bit of yellow color. Smells of faint grain and a bit of cardboard. Taste is a bit more grain, and by grain, I probably mean the flavor and complexity of plain white rice. Feel is very, very light and overly carbonated. Drinks like carbonated water and tastes a bit worse. That about sums it up."
"This is a terrible beer."
"D - Yeah it is drinkable. But why would you have a bunch of these? I'll take one good craft beer over a few of these anytime."
"as far as light lagers go, there are much better choices out there. as my grandfather liked his beer, a raw egg or some salt would make this beer better. i think flying dog said it best, good people drink good beer, and this is far from good beer..."
"drinkability: the beers best quality, if you can drink water you can drink this beer."
"D: I was obliged to score this one highly, because this is almost as drinkable as beer gets...very easy to swig and swallow. Still, I don't *want* to drink it. This beer is worth a try, just to marvel at its accomplished nothingness. Not recommended."
"Served from tap into a Magic Hat shaker. Pours golden yellow with a minimal amount of white head. There was no lacing evident at all on this one. The aroma was comprised of malt and a nutty note. The flavor was of malt, wheat, nutty, and water. It was light on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this brew was just blah... Short reply would be to say that this one sucks, unless of course you are trying to sober up (which I was)."
"F-!!!"
"Drank this from bottle at many bars, restuarants and college parties. no sustainable head, pale gold color with a terrible white head.. The aroma is light, not super skunky as this is mostly water. The taste is all water. Nothing worth ever drinking."
"Pours a clean, pale straw color with minimal plume of white head despite many bubbles. Smell is almost non-existant, faint dried hay and slight corn. Taste is rather non existant too except for the light touch of boiled corn on the finnish. Extremely light, very watery and highly carbonated. The only positive i can say is that the off flavors were kept to a minimum, but so were all of the flavors."
"Poured a clear, bubbly deep straw/light gold color with a short lived fizzy white head. Dissipated and left with a clear yellow tinted liquid. A light metallic nose and a touch of corn. Not much else can be discerned. Very fizzy. I'm not sure of where the drinkability comes into play here; it's too carbonated for me. The light body doesn't support it well. Flavor (or what little bit of corniness) dies quickly. I did not find this drinkable. In fact, I ended up pouring it out after a few sips."
"All in all this beer has an unfairly low rating on here in my opinion. Even though I'd never choose this beer, it's not a drain pour. It's just BARELY beer."
"Ethereal, mildness incarnate, generally inoffensive, and a hair below table water in thirst quenching effectiveness. I'm surprised that I got carded when I ordered this, for multiple reasons, none of them all that good. One of the spokes of that boundary and cliff edge pushing wheel that the big boys of beer can ill afford to not pursue, apparently."
"Overall: Bud Light's actually better."
"This is nothing but carbonated water with a little alcohol mixed in. I really don't even consider this beer a 'social' beer. It's a disappointment. Michelob does have several other selections that are respectable. I consider this one to have one of the worst taste's of any beer I've tried."
"D: If your objective is to look cool you failed. If your objective is to get drunk you failed. If your objective is to look like you are on a diet than you have succeeded. It is not drinkable and will leave you feeling empty and lonely as people start calling you a fag."
"Crystal clear and very pale yellow. A fizzy white cap disappeared almost instantly. Very faint cereal grain aroma, slight fruit, minerals, otherwise the smell is nearly nonexistent. Not much in the way of bitterness, light apple and grain, metallic finish. Very light bodied, slipping into the watery category by the finish. Quite dry with coarse carbonation. Can't say that I enjoyed this at all."
"D: I suppose if you were really thirsty this might be okay, since it's a close relative to soda. Otherwise, avoid."
"[Drinkability]: It's so bland and watery that I couldn't finish drinking the whole beer."
"Not the worst beer I've ever had but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone."
"D- Its easy to drink but I dont really see why anyone would. It can hardly get you drunk, it has no real taste, no color, no smell, no purpose. I guess this is for people who need to have something in their hand while at the bar with their friends."
"D: I guess you could call this drinkable, but by no means would I ever want a session or pong game with it. I suppose if you were dieting and needed a session beer, it would do."
"D - Normal people like this stuff. Plus, this is a really safe choice; they wouldn't spend that much on advertising if it wasn't one of the best beers."
"I'm not sure if this is a positive review or a negative, but I keep it in the house all the time now."
"Avoid this beer at all costs. It's really disgusting. And I have no idea why people buy it since it's not even cheap."
"D: Very easy to drink, low ABV plus only 95 calories and low in carbs... But why.... my quest for a good light beer continues...."
"I wasn't expecting a lot from this. Usually light beer is pretty bad. I was pleasantly surprised, but it left me unsatisfied. I like to end with a really good beer, so this is definitely a starter beer for me."
"D: I don't see what's so ""Ultra"" about this beer, considering it tastes worse than original Michelob. And original Michelob was already at the bottom of my list."
"There is nothing to this beer at all. Someone could switch your drink with club soda and you wouldn't even know it if you were drinking this swill. It is clean and crisp tasting, but it's hard to screw up H2O. I had two of these and doubt I ever will again because really, there's just no point. I went from drinking Bud Light to drinking this and the BL seemed complex in comparison. It's THAT bland. It is easy to drink though, which is why I gave it a 2 for that, but only a 2 because it's not *fun* to drink."
"I have to say this was much better than I had anticipated. There is actually some flavor which I expected none. I doubt I will drink this ever again but I would take it over many other light lagers."
"(d)-Yeah. I gave it a 4,and heres why bitches. Try drinking another light beer in this calorie category AND THEN go pick it up again. I'll drink the 6 pack...but I'd rather let myself have 3 calorie packed delights. (4/5)"
"Michelob Ultra is a Light Beer brewed by Anheuser-Busch. This brew has an ABV of 4.20%  Michelob Ultra is an average everyday Ultra Light Beer. Michelob Ultra pours out a light amber color with a small white head. The smell is light with some grams and malts. The taste is light like water really no taste at all. But like I said before it is a Light beer. If you do not like light beers , this is not for you. Would rather have a Michelob or Budweiser over this. Overall  this is an ok brew, I'm giving it a 3 out of 5."
"Poured into my evertrusty Zatec fluted glass. 2 fingers of head initially, died into nothing in less than 30 seconds. Smells of grass, and beer that was nicked from your dad when you were 14. Looks like pisswater. Tastes like watered down Budweiser mixed with skunk piss. Finish dissolves after less than 10 seconds. I would drink this with a hotdog at a party and not think twice about drinking 17 more. Why not just drink some Fiji?"
"What can I saw that hasn't already been said. I tried this beer to just try it. I wanted to go jogging, this stuff is water. I don't even understand why this is made. Sure it's low in carbs and everything, but it's all empty calories. It's not healthy for you, wake up. This beer is sold based on marketing alone."
"Drinkability: Tastes and feels like sweet seltzer water. On the plus side, I actually could finish it."
"Light bready texture in consistency with a return of a spritzy lemon flavor. Reminds me in a way of lemon flavored seltzer. Thin and watery feel yet quite quaffable with no negative flavors. Surely better directly from the bottle removing the look and aroma from the equation where it's smooth and pleasant. Better than Coors Light by a long shot yet there's nothing really there either."
"Born on date Jan 20 10. I am not bothering to pour this brew in to a glass. No real scent. I am drinking this cold right out of the freezer on a 65 degree spring day. Its hitting the spot. Certainly has a watery mouthfeel. A small amount of cereal and rice flavors. Slighty sweet. Nothing to special here. Will I drink some more? Yea. Not bad stuff."
"Notes: Not all that good, even when compared to other mass produced beers this doesn't stand out. Not really worth going after."
"Pours a light yellow color, nice carbonation, small white head, with some sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, with some hops, slight caramel. The taste is slightly sweet, malty, slight hop note. Light body. Not drinkable, would not buy again."
"If I want a light refreshing beer it's going ot be an Ultra. It's simply the leat offensive of the light beers. Extremely light taste but very smooth with no bitterness. Nicely carbonated. These go down way easy and are refreshng when they are ice cold. Good summer beer when it's brutally hot out and you want to cool off. This beer has it's place."
"SUMMARY: WHY BOTHER? Just drink water."
"I like this one as a light overall beer. It's one I can just sit around and drink. The overall beer factor of this is it's not going to compare very well with beers on here. But it's a good light beer that's american made for the masses that you can put em down."
"Michelob Ultra is one of my top beers officially. Thanks michelob!"
"D - Surprisingly filling. I didn't want to drink anything else after the pint. The dryness and light flavor increase drinkability. The prickly carbonation does not."
"I seriously can't recommend this one. No flavor whatsoever, hardly any hops. A complete waste of money. Thank god that I did not have to pay for it with mine."
"Pours a nice golden color, little bit of fast-fading lace, its not bad for a backyard bbq, or a football game type beverage, easy to drink. Worth trying for said occasions, price is maybe a little above average for this type of beer but, I like it better than Bud ice, or Milwaukee's Best."
"Appearance has a light straw color with a quickly dissipating crisp head. Smell has a faint grainy sweetness. Taste, having light grain and hops this must be the most diluted beer I've ever had. Mouthfeel is light with good carbonation. Not a terrible beer, but goes down real quick and smooth, would be exellent on a hot day."
"D: I liked with the clam chowder."
"While I will agree this beer isn't the greatest to have, but it has its place in the world of beer. Very light, pale, almost no head, little lacing. Light in flavor, not impressive, just a good beer to drink if you don't care about quality and just want to get a buzz without collecting a lot of carbs/calories. I like this beer, but it does kind of suck."
"Pours a pale yellow color with a thin white head which disappears right away. There is almost no smell to this, maybe some cooked corn, and that's about it. Taste? What taste? Light cooked corn and mostly just water. Feels thin and watery, fair carbonation, very dry and bland. I had this one at New Years Eve, and am willing to try most beers at least once, but will not have this again."
"Remember this is a light beer. Pours very pale amber with a foamy white head. Aroma is minimal and somewhat corny. Taste is very light with a champale-like body. Even in a light beer category this is weak. Nothing bad in this beer, just hard to call it a beer. A fine brew for those who don't like the taste of beer. Very champagne like."
"D: don't drink this if you want a beer--this is for the low calorie seeker only."
"All of the characteristics of this beer were just average. Nothing special, just a lower calorie version of an American Light Lager. The only edge this beer has is in drinkability, because you can have a bunch of them and not have a calorie overload."
"D Well good since it is very close to water. In fact, I would take a nice glass of ice water over this beer. I mean it, I would rather have water and then, later crack open a beer with some taste. 4.0"
"Overall I wouldn't turn down one if it was free. Like I said previously there are certainly more offensive beers out there. But like many I just can't see the point of a beer like this. I know that a lot of people drink it to watch their weight. But honestly if I was watching mine, I'd rather not drink at all than have this."
"Bottle: Poured a super light yellow color lager with a thin bubbly head that disappeared very quickly. Aroma of very light adjunct and water. Taste is lighter then Coors light which I didn't' though was possible with light adjunct and very little else to note. Body is closer to Perrier then any other beer I drank before. One of the blandest beer I have drank in my life."
"Poured from a 12 oz. can. Has a very pale yellow color with a small head. Very mild aroma, some hints of corn. Really no taste to speak of. Beer flavored water. Feels light in the mouth. Drinkability is not bad. Overall I would say this is a sorry excuse for beer, but since I need to take of a few pounds, I guess there is a purpose for it."
"Drinkability: A beer for those who don’t like calories and don’t like flavor. Bland, watered down, incredible light, with too much carbonation."
"Overall: The mouth feel is crisp and clean. The body of the beer is super light and the finish is nil. This beer doesn't have much going for it. The beer fits well in the guidelines for its style and that is only the reason why it got this rating."
"As with many macros in a CAN, it pours with a decent finger-and-a-half of bone-white head with decent retention. The really striking aspect of this ""beer"" is its color - Holy Urine, Batman, my stream this morning was darker than this! It was an ULTRA-pale lemon-yellow with ULTRA NE-quality clarity. Hell, I could see through walls with this one! The nose had a slight cereal quality, but that was after repeated sniffs, trying to discern even something worth mentioning. ULTRA ho-hum! Mouthfeel was light, airy, ULTRA smooth, almost like I was not even drinking water, no, air, no, beer. Oh that's right, I was supposed to be drinking beer. Well, you could not prove it by this concoction. ULTRA boring. Finish was ULTRA non-existent. Wow. Give this a wide berth unless ULTRA boredom is your bag."
"This was a 5 second drink then about a 2/3 glass drainpour. I normally no matter how much I dislike a beer will drink it. This one I just couldn't. Bleh....gross!"
"Ordered at Uncle Julio's. Poured starw coloured with thin head, no smell and soda water 0.1% hop taste. Surprisingly, not even a hint of malt. Waterlike with high carbonation. If you want a session without any stopping or guilt, this could be a possible choice."
"AVOID"
"Well, they didn't give a glass, so I had to drink it from the bottle. So appearance gets an automatic F, right? Smells like ass, too. Tastes like sweet cornflakes left out in the sun for a week. I mean, goddamn, this is bad. I finished it, though, since I had to get my six bucks worth."
"Overall, not something I would ever buy. Light and thin. This is just a fancy way of saying a light beer is light."
"A very pale yellow pour with a thin fizzy white head , no lacing. Aroma of light sweet corn , faint grain and very littlke else . Flavor is very light , some light malt , raw grain and carbonated water . No hop flavor at all , no bitterness, prickly mouthfeel from too much carbonation , light body , no aftertaste . Drinkable but not very good , nothing offensive , just not at all what I look for in a beer like aroma and flavor ."
"I'm not sure what the Ultra refers to, cuz this beast is just awful. Looks like a watered down glass of some other super-pale beer. Smells like nothing else really, just Michelob Ultra. Tastes like cup of water that's been filtered through a bag of rotten grains. I wouldn't wish this on my worst enemies."
"Drinkability is the highlight here. Could easily down a 12 of these."
"Perhaps the worst ""beer"" I've consumed since Chelada. I mean, I'm not a hater on these styles necessarily, but come'on!! Draw the line somewhere! Miller/Bud/Coors have all created beers that are light and low in calories! How far do we have to go?"
"D: Easy to drink, in a volume sense, but I would rather have as little of this as possible. Skip the 95 calories of slightly flavored water and just have a nice refreshing glass of pure H20."
"I drank this to find out weather the rest in my pantry are worth saving for my next party. No reason not to keep it."
"It is a ver very hot humid day today, so it went down easy and fast, but this is not anything I'd sit and sip (or even cook with). Why buy this crap?"
"If you could imagine boiling corn and rice in the same pot then straining it and adding sugary seltzer to the water the corn and rice boiled in you would come close to this. however this is an utlra light beer coming in at 95 calories and is useful when trying to loose weight. Like I have been doing for the past few months and it has paid off considerably and it is easy to drink. However, it doesn't taste like much of anything but is an alternative to drinking a high abv, high calorie beer when trying to work out and loose weight. This is the best ultra light beer I have had to date"
"Pours a see through yellow white color. The smell is of nothing, there is a hint of some type of grain. The taste is of nothing, but a barely there grain. The taste is watery, but at least not offensive. The mouthfeel is overly carbonated. Overall there is not much to this beer, it is pretty simple and weak all over, yet there is nothing offensive about it. It is really nothing to speak of."
"Perversely I have given this a very high drinkability rating because I think if I was after a beer to drink by the bucket until I was rotten drunk then this would be right up there. As it tastes of nothing it would be very hard to get sick of it."
"Poured very light yellow in color. Had a white head that basicly diappeared in a few seconds. No lacing at all. After pouring you never even realized it had a head in the beginning. Smelled like nothing. Maybe some grain or corn, but really smelt like nothing. Tasted like a watered down Busch. Had that AB slight sweet flavor Very very light in the flavor area. Felt like water in the mouth. Maybe to much over carbonation. I guess I expected to much from Michelob. Wont drink again."
"Cheers!"
"D - The dump I took while writing this sentence [from notes] had 10x more character than this crappy beer. For the masses that want to ""work out while drinking a beer"" as their ads imply, its drinkable. For any self-respecting, beer-loving person, it's unacceptable. Poured out the rest after the review was done."
"The pour left no head and it had a very dilute apple juice appearance to it. There was minimal lacing at first but nothing on the way down the glass. The smell was faintly like water from a summer warmed hose. Nothing really discernible but really had a slight smell of rubber to it. The taste and mouthfeel were terrifyin and I doubt it would have been much better without my previously mentioned experience."
"Pours pale, very thin white head. Utterly transparent. Smells of grain husks and corn. Why do I get corn on this thing? To be so thin on calories it could at least have the decency to smell like nothing. Taste's of air, with perhaps a hint of water. Where's that gross corn I smelled? I was kinda looking forward to some gross corn. It's slightly flat too. Good one?"
"I tried this beer because it happened to be the ""Beer of the Month"" at my regular bar. The waitress warned me that it was like water, but I tried it anyway and she was right. Simply put, I did not enjoy this beer and probably won't ever get it again."
"drinkability well the only time this is even close to drinkable is if you've been involved in some sort of sporting activity and are about dead tired..."
"Ew. With all the IPA's and Stouts I have had over the years, this tastes so bland! I poured this into my trusty drinking mug, and it looks tepid and bland. Bland yellow color, no head at all, and has no character to it whatsover. This beer is made for the ones who have to drive the drunkards home, because with even 3 of these, they will not get a buzz. This stuff has no character to it whatsover! Would rather drink 211, at least I know I will have something going on after a couple. Yuk...."
"What the hell am I drinking? My boss left this in my hotel fridge so I thought I would give it a spin. Note to self, don't drink left over beer from my boss ever again."
" I don't think this should be allowed to be called beer. It should be considered carbonated water with a bit of yellow color."
"Mouthfeel is lighter than water some how. The carbonation is super-charged and gritty."
"Pale, almost clear yellow with a slight skim of foam around the edges. Smells very faintly of creamed corn and nothing else. This beverage takes flavorless to new levels. Very similar to sparkling water. Watered down grain and faint artificial sweetness. Very light effervescent mouthfeel, finishes squeaky clean. My buddy left a few of these in the fridge and I just couldn't resist. I think this beer is for those that want a diet beer without all that ""beer flavor"" getting in the way."
"at least this makes anything from their 'craft' series taste 'great'....but of course that's conditional as it gets!"
"As a runner, weightlifter, and beer drinker I am the target market for this stuff and you couldn't pay me to drink it. So who's buying this crap?"
"Poured a very light golden color with a very little head that quickly disappeared. This was probably the lightest beer i've seen in a while. The smell was very little. I managed to get a bit of a grain smell with just a quick hint that it was a beer. Tasted a bit grainy with a light metallic taste. Mouthfull was very carbonated that left a dry finish. In my opinion this ultra light has very characteristics. Only beer I found in my sisters fridge, so i thought i'd give it a taste."
"Pours a very very pale straw watery color. Decent carbonation and no head. Smells like pee, with a little bit of sweet malt. Taste is not as bad as some other mainstream beers. It is somewhat sweet and that's about it, no real flavors that stand out, kind of malty, but maybe its more rice flavored. Of course if you add lots of lime juice and a little vodka it can be a decent mixed drink, good while mowing the lawn, but I would prefer something else."
"Overall: It was an unremarkable, bland beer that did not bring much flavor - Low ABV, carbonated watery taste, and there are better light beers out there. As someone else said, drinking it seemed to ask the question ""what's the point"""
"Trash. Good if you want to count calories but why buy something as cheap as this when you can settle for a pint of Guinness every now and then? There are plenty of beers that are light in alcohol and full of flavor. Avoid this crap."
"Overall: Carbonation is standard for the style. As for drinkability, since I didn't find the taste horrible I can't put the drinkability very far down seeing as how drinking a case of this may be possible in an hour or two. If you care about calories more than flavor go for it."
"Not much, but some. In my opinion it is one of the better mass prodcued beers."
"D - 2.0 - I guess it's ""good"" if you like this sorta thing for light beer. But it's shy on taste, mouthfeel and ABV - so it's leaves thinking - what's the point?"
"Drank Dec. 27. From bottle into shaker glass. Very little color, very little flavor. Looked at the last sip or two and wondered if it was water or beer waiting for me. Low carb, low everything. Overpriced in the premium beer market. Almost as bad as Bud Light. I prefer Miller Lite over this anyday. Bad beer, and does not deserve the Michelob name attached to it."
"Future outlook: Nah...not unless I'm looking to turn back the clock to college times and get drunk on alcoholic water."
"I understand carb and calorie counting, but I'd rather become a Belgian Monk :) then to drink this god-awful swill. The anti-beer for any self-respecting BA. Ugh."
"A drinkable beer who's major advantage is a low carbohydrate count. Will not fill you up no matter how much you drink. It is average in almost every category for its type(appearance, smell, taste.) Better than many lite beers but not overly impressive. Head does not last. It is best drank ice cold on a hot summer day."
"I don't think I hate this brew as much as the rest of you. It's not at the top of my list but could be worse. Color and appearance is pretty average for the style. Flavor is where you can start the bitching. I think someone before me said it is kinda like a ginger ale. I can taste that now that i think about it. Nothing too special here just a below average brew."
"This is another one of those beers that is nice to have on a hot summer day when it's ice cold. I drink it often because it prevents me from having to keep going to the bathroom to take shots, which can be embarrassing if I'm trying to socialize. When I'm by myself at my house I would never."
"Not a hint of hops aroma, and even the corn character was barely noticable. Flavor was one with the aroma, more noticeable for what was not there than what was, left a slightly dry, alcoholic aftertaste with an astringent bitter edge to it. I suppose this stuff is really quite drinkable because there's so little to it, and as long as it is ice-cold your taste buds will stay numb. If it's warm, toss it back like a grenade that lands in your foxhole with the pin out, or fall on it to save your friends."
"Pours a clear, pale yellow with slight head and absolutely no retention. Also, of course, there's no lacing. Smells of what you would expect - adjunct in a lager. I guess it fits this great style. Smooth and crisp is the best I can say about this beer. Tastes, bland (watered down), mostly adjunct in lager. Overall, not very good at all."
"Poured a 12oz bottle into my New Belgium globe. This beer pours the most translucent shad of yellow I have ever seen pour out of a beer bottle. It really looks like yellow, bubbly water. The only thing that I can give it credit for is the fact that the pour produced a huge, 3 finger white head. When looked down from the top of the glass, it really looks like a pretty beer. The smell is really watery with just a hint of corn. The taste is, well, canned corn water. The mouthfeel is non-existent. Just like water. If you like drinking water, stick with the tap, if you like drinking beer, move on to something else. Either way, avoid this beer."
"Do I even need to say anything? Well I have to have two hundred fifty characters, so I guess I will. In all seriousness, this is made for a female to look good in the bar with. A trendy, I'm drinking a beer like the guys kinda thing. Not saying women don't drink beer, but most usally have this kind of thing in hand."
"Wife came home with a 6-pack. Looks, smells, and tastes like a watered-down Budweiser. To recap: clear yellow pour. Sickening corn syrup nose. Watery, beer-like taste with straw and sugar. Upside: you can drink a ton since it is as close to water as you can get. Downside: you have to drink a ton of this to like it. A travesty."
"Pours a very light watery golden yellow with thin fizzy white head that quickly dissapears. Aroma consists mostly of corn and frat house hallways. Very watered down with extremely bland corn flavor. Very light and nasty the whole way through. Disgusting!"
"This was not a bad tasting beer. In fact this is a good beer for people who don't like beer."
"These were free at the time, but I must say, as a beer lover, I switched to coffee after two of these."
"I had this at a friend's house. The friend, one of my very best, is very concerned about calories, so this is all he had. This does not really look, taste, smell, or feel like a real beer. The color is exceptionally pale. A slight malt meets your nose, but dies after a sip or two. I honestly couldn't really taste this beverage, but I admit I've hardened my taste buds over the years of sucking down lots of strong Italian espresso and bitter pale ales. The texture is like carbonated water, and so it is a thirst quencher. Michelob is producing some nice beers these days, but this one is good only for being polite to a close friend with calorie sensitivity."
"My ""Marge"" likes this beer and drinks it regularly and she is a bona-fide expert on European Weisse beers."
"I know big brewery light beers get a bad rap, especially here,this one is not bad for the style, which is very light lager. Pours with a decent head, light in taste, and goes down way too smooth, its easy to drink a bunch of these things real quick. Not impressive, and not worth the price, but if you limited to Coors Light, Bud Light, Miller Lite, and this, I would go for this"
"drinkability: very easy. only good for long hot days. lawnmower beer"
"D- if you're looking for something to quench your thirst on a hot summer day, look no further. if you're looking for even an inch more than that, then by damn, keep looking."
"D: as i said above, the first mouthful I thought not bad (It was a knock off drink, I was thirsty), but by the end I thought 'how boring?'...absolutely nothing of interest to entice me back."
"The one redeeming quality of this beer is that it makes excellent beertails. You want something with no flavor to compete with the liquor. I like to add a shot of Butterscotch Schnapps for ""Butter Beer", or a blackberry or other fruit schnapps in the fall. Yummy!"
"I'm not sure what the point of this product is. It really is a water with a slight bit of beer taste, and at 4% ABV, its almost pointless to drink. No smell, looks terrible in the glass and no taste. But, it is cheap and I must say it's super drinkable. Good for drinking large quantities of beer at one time I guess?"
"Overall: Terrible"
"Nothing special..."
"I was recently over a co-workers house who really isn't into good beers. The choice I had was Mich Ultra or nothing so I swallowed my pride, made some snide remark about watching my figure and reluctantly accepted the Mich Ultra. It was a Friday afternoon after a long work week so just about anything would have hit the spot. The fact that people voluntarily drink this stuff is surprising. There is nothing to it, it's like water with a hint of beer flavoring. I drank it straight from the bottle so I can't comment on the appearance, there was no smell, taste, mouthfeel or anything else for that matte. I actually think Budweiser might stack up next to this."
"What did I rate Michelob Light? Seems like the same thing with a new advertising catch. I guess it's not horrible for what it is. Just tastes like so many other domestic light beers, really watered down with whatever flavor it has being t his corny, grainy, dusty flavor. This one however is extra watered down."
"Big ol' foamy white head quickly formed and quickly faded when I poured this into my glass. No lacing, no retention, no surprise. Lightly floral aromas with vinegar hints. So light in color it looks almost like water! Despite several sips it tastes much like water too - I can discern almost no flavor! Barely a beer. High carbonation makes it hard to imagine going through several too, not that I can imagine why one would do so. The high carbonation also causes it to go flat quickly. I really want to fail this beer but I can't quite because it actually is better than most macro lights and it is so neutral as to be inoffensive."
"Avoid!"
"With the St. Louis temperature being about 100 degrees on the day that I reviewed this, it was easy to imagine killing an ice cold 6 pack of these, especially if there weren't any flavorful beers around."
"No food pairing suggestions on this weak effort."
"Got this at a wedding because, well, I was tired of drinking the other non-starters they were offering (e.g., Bud Light and Corona). It was cold. It had bubbles. Very watery and virtually tasteless. The color (obviously added) led one to believe there was something to this beer. Nope. Nothing. There was a mild (roasted?) malt flavor and an annoying banana flavor (hops?) that built up over time until they became rather disgusting and rendered the last inch or so undrinkable. The Corona with lime I had reluctantly ordered before seemed so much better."
"Drinkable, but so is water. Fizziness is the only thing slowing a quaffer down here."
"As far as light lagers go, this is one of the better ones out there. Sure, it's already tasteless and watery, but this brew is at least a little more interesting and flavorful."
"D: I'd never pick this up on purpose. No taste, no aromas, nothing going on. Like seltzer water with a splash of beer flavor."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- This begins a bit prickly, but doesn't go wild like others I've tried. It thins out and goes watery after a few seconds in the mouth, which doesn't surprise me. This is the easiest and most enjoyable light beer to drink out of a glass, even after a half hour coming closer to cellar temperature this never became difficult. Craziness."
"I had the choice of this or Corona Light at a recent cook-out. I guess I made the wrong choice. I drank it from the bottle so I can't say anything about how it looked. But my other senses told me enough. This is crap. The only taste I could make out was a metallic chloriney tinge - Chemical soup. This is a beer for people who don't like beer. Why bother ?"
"At least I know better than to try this again. It's a shame really. Why even make, or especially drink, this beer regularly? I don't know how people do it. This is extremely rare except for in extreme circumstances, but I didn't even finish this beer. Poured it out. That was the best part about this experience... getting rid of it."
"Drinkability: There's a slight, but noticeable ickiness to the taste, I'd really prefer it to simply taste like nothing. Maybe I can understand why they're trying to jazz it up with those various flavorings."
"Not a complex beer, not too flavorful, but honestly not as bad as I expected. Great for people who look to beer as a thirst quencher, or drink it in social situations, and/or have very bland tastes in general."
"Wow, a low carb light beer. My dreams are finally answered. This brew is a very pale yellow and has a weak white head. The smell is of old garbage water. The taste is nothing special. Very close to water with some grains and yeast. The body is again light and unappealing. Not very drinkable at all. Like with most of these, I'll have a water."
"D - This is a really sad attempt, just not even close to beer. I guess if you want to cut grease from ribs it works, but not for any real beer taste - Avoid this at all costs. I wish this could have proved me wrong but nothing ultra about this, just ultra lame."
"Drinkable as a glass of water with a slice of lemon in it. But not a very good beer."
"Don't get me wrong-I like this brew, but it has few redeeming qualities, and as the reviews show, most if not all agree."
"Watery, almost odor-free, ('cept for the mentioned metallic whang and some funky sulphur deal). Undrinkable except in a survival/ beer bong/ gift recipient situation. Someone should take a flogging over this ridiculous excuse for beer. Awful."
"O- It's basically what I expected. It's a good thing I got this one for free."
"I was at a restaurant with a very limited beer selection and thought I'd give this a try. This was the first and last time I'll drink this ""beer""."
"I'm not sure what the ""ultra"" stands for.. I'm thinking it must be for ultra gross, because that's pretty much all this beer is. It's a poor example of a light lager.. flavorless, colorless, odorless, and most of all - tasteless. Avoid this beer at all costs. Save yourself the calories and drink water instead."
"Tried this just to try, would never order this again. Something my wife sister might drink , she hates beer."
" The quality seems to diminsih with every passong minute. Overall: don't bother."
"Not a good beer, but it was free so I shouldn't complain too much about it."
"Some people left this behind at my house so I figured that I would at least try it. This is my first time ever tasting this stuff. Pours an extremely pale, extremely clear, straw color with big soda-like carbonation bubbles. Very small head that fizzles out quickly. Aroma is of light grains, adjuncts, corn, and a slightly ""off-smell."" Whoa, the taste is REALLY bad. This beer brings out a new level of skunkiness. Tastes extremely watery with an intense skunkiness in the finish. Mouthfeel is very watery and carbonated. This is one of the few ""drain-pours"" that I have had."
"Easy to drink. I really don't have much else to say. It was cold. It wasn't spoiled."
"12 ounce bottle, ""born on date"" of 1/3/08. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours a very pale clear yellow color with a half inch white head. Head retention is low, lacing is OK. Aroma is corn, grain, and a little bit of sweet malt. It tastes the same as it smells, sweet and grainy. No offensive aromas or flavors. Mouthfeel/body is light, it has a lot of carbonation and it's watery. Drinkability is average, it isn't hard to drink and it goes down almost as easy as water does. I could down a few of these on a hot day. It's not what I'd call a good beer, but it's not horrible either. For the style it's not bad."
"Extremely light yellow color beer. Almost like water with lemon juice squirted in it... Very short lived head. An extremely subtle grain smell, and taste is one of the lightest of any beer I've ever had. Not bad tasting, but closer to water than beer as far as the taste. Still, I'd rather drink this over some other beers, actually."
"For the quenching aspect it works, and it's not the worst macro I've tasted (in terms of offending the palate), but there really is no flavor to mention, and I won't be rushing out to purchase this anytime soon."
"I'd tank this beer lower if I didn't see it for what it is. In its own right it's what it needs to be. However, I just can't look myself in the mirror and give this dog anything higher than a D..."
"I'm not sure what is ultra about this beer other than the lack of taste and body. I suggest you save yourself and have water instead; it's cheaper with less calories."
"A lot of people are going to think I am crazy, but I like this beer. A part of the reason is that I am straddling the line between beer geek (in training) and weight lifter (not huge yet). So having this at social gatherings at bars is almost necessary for me. If I wanted just to lose weight, I probably wouldn't drink this as there are much better light beers. Now, it is a very light, watery gold draft w/ a quickly dieing head that greets me (the barwecnch didn't even bother tilting the glass, but why bother with this beer). But I find that it has a nice, smooth but crisp body w/ the adjuncts making a nice taste (smell this and you are going to pick up water and corn). Since it is very low in calories and carbs and alcohol, this is redrinkable. In fact, you might have to drink many of them to catch a buzz."
"drinkability - Not a good beer at all, very watery. This is a light beer, didn't know that until I saw BA label it as that. Had this when I went to eat, decided to get something I normally don't."
"Enjoy your bubbly, watery ""beer", peasant."
"All in all this one tastes like a diet beer, very watered down, and yes I am aware of the purpose of a 3.2 state describing a weak tasting beer. It reallly tastes watered down. Really watered down, the only saving grace on this one is the fact that the only option they have is an amber."
"Little head or retention for that part. The only thing I can same about this is that it did feel crisp, thats why I gave a 2 for mouthfeel. Not bitter, but then again not much of anything. This is as light as it gets. For someone that wants to drink beer with their friends but is watching their weight, and does not not beer much anyways, this is the beer for you. light as it gets. Nothing more, nothing less. Gives you bloatedness while tasting like water."
"This beer is for the weak stomached, or if you're trying to see how many you can drink. It pours a pale golden yellow with a short white head. It doesn't have much of a smell except that stale beer smell - light hops and malts watered down to almost nothing. The taste is the same as well. It tastes watered down with some light hops and light malts in there to get the most out of the beer. I'd give it a decent rating on the drinkablility because it is closer to water than to most beer."
"The worst. This is the only beer I feel comfortable ranting about. For people who drink it, I understand what you're looking for, and my advice is this: Take a shot of cheap vodka, chug a glass of water and do some jumping jacks instead. Aside from the 1's, I gave it a 2 for drinkability because I would be comfortable chugging this if offered one, that way I could immediately order something different. This is just my opinion, and it's OK if this is your beer, but I would suggest Mic Light instead."
"Leave it."
"The first time I drank one was from a bottle after a four hour drive on a hot day, and I found it to be light and refreshing. Now I see it for what it is - a truly crap beer, cheap but still poor value. Admittedly there are no off smells or tastes, but frankly there are almost no smells or tastes at all. My girlfriend suggested adding a slice of lemon, and I agree with her - it needs something. Or better still, buy a good beer instead!"
"Pours an extremely pale golden with a bright white head that fades immediately to almost nothing. Smell is lightly sour and vaguely citrusy and grainy- sorta like a poor quality Orangina knock-off that's been watered down. There is an underlying cereal sweetness. The taste is unbelievably light, an initial graininess and then....nothing. It just fades off in a burst of effervescence that tastes vaguely of slightly sweetened club soda. That being said, as weak as this is, I prefer its inoffensiveness to the cooked corn taste to so many other American macro lagers. This one is barely a beer, but I could see sucking one down while mowing the yard- but only if I were out of water."
"Another ""fun"" reviewer... to say I am ""sessioning"" this is to say one is taste-testing a chicken nugget...sad when a beer's advertisiements actually DO approximate what to expect from the taste...sparkling translucent effervescent yellow body with a hint of head--champagne from a distance...light hints of bread and dough, classic cereal....a bit of chemical cleanliness? Light watery body that bubbles around the tongue--fleeting in presence...the beechwood aging appellationwould best apply here...refreshing is the commercial (and euphemistic) word for anything this ""ultra""...no surprises: a beer that somehow manages a measly amount of carbs and sacrifices a ton of character possibilities for a chance to be consumed in mass quantities by club-hopping hipsters (or so notes the commercials)...and I'm strangely okay with that, from this distance...then again, I like chicken nuggets..."
"D - Well, if you're looking for something that makes it seem as if you're drinking beer without all of the malt and hops getting in the way, then this is your beer. Refreshing, but only as much as a nice glass of water would be. Above average drinkability for the style, thanks to the merciful lack of taste."
"I've had this numerous times and just now getting to reviewing it. Pours a decent amber color with little to no head and practically no lacing. Really has no smell to it at all. The taste is ok when nice and cold but as it warms up, like most macros it begins to suffer. Overall it's an average to below average beer but certainly not the worst I've ever had"
"Drinkability- Low carb? Come on! Is this what we've reduced ourselves to. Macro-Beer was already reduced down in flavor and calories a hundred times before this drink came around. America Macros supposedly made good beer before WW2 and then they marketed after the women, so what does that tell you?(No offense to any women on this site that like good beer)"
"I tried it because one of my friends had it in her fridge and I wanted to rate it for myself. To be honest, the low score is not because it tastes bad. It doesn't. It is just not beer and doesn't deserve credit just because it tastes like seltzer as opposed to a bad tasting beer, that tried to make an interesting taste."
"Mich Ultra has an average look, very pale straw coloring with some carbonation. Almost no head and little lacing. It has almost no scent to it and very little taste. It's very bland. It goes down easily, but only because it's nearly water. It would be all right for quenching your thirst after mowing your lawn, but so would a cool glass of H2O."
"D: Not very tasty because theres simply a lack of any flavor, goes down easy for the same reason, not filling at all, even among macros there isnt much that would make me pick this beer. The fact that its so light seems to be the only thing that it has going for it."
"Really doesn't have much to offer for a beer lover. If you like pale, flavorless beers and you care about carbs then this one it right up your alley."
"But AB was trying to make a Low-Carb beer, and they achieved this goal. They didn't attempt at flavor or complex nature. Remember that when reviewing this beer. Because I love tons of quality brews, but since I'm a fitness addict, during the week when I want a brew, I don't need something with a Metric ton of calories. But something tells me a large percentage of the people truly bashing this beer for its caloric content, etc. have guts hanging over their beltlines... just a thought."
"If you feel like drinking a case and not getting full or putting on weight, this is probably the way to go"
"Pours a very pale straw color with better head than I expected. About 1cm of creamy head that stood up above the rim for a while, then faded to a thin layer that clings to the glass. Smells a lot like the inside of an empty soda water bottle, like plastic. Tastes... like nothing. I've had vodka/water with more flavor than this. Mouthfeel is mildy fizzy and very watery. I would say this is a boring beer, but I'm not sure it's even beer. As far as I can tell, they didn't use any malt or hops. If it was possible to brew beer without using yeast or water, I imagine they would have skipped those too."
"I dont know why everyone rips on this beer, it certainly doesnt deserve such a low rating there are way worse beers out there than this. Its on scale with bud light, miller lite etc, i like it better than bud light. A light watery generic beer, not that bad though."
"Pure unadulterated crap. No body, subtlety, nor taste. Diet beer. Anheuser-Busch is a marketing genius that has weight-conscious females drinking this crap because its ""low-carb"". This is the worst of what America has to offer. Color is sickly light yellow and almost no aroma. Mouthfeel is basically just carbonation. The head on this stuff lasts just shy of 2 seconds."
"D: Not a good beer, if you want a light beer, drink Guinness, it was not hard to drink this beer, but won't have again unless free."
"D: Under no circumstances should anyone, ever, drink this beer. Stick with Michelob and forget this thing even exists."
"I'm pretty sure that this was mislabeled. This is seltzer water, not beer. I give it a 1.5 for smell, because water doesn't smell bad. It gets a 1.5 on drinkability because water is very ""slam-able."" It isn't very cheap, it doesn't taste good (nor like beer), and you shouldn't drink beer if you are on a low-carb diet. There is absolutely no reason that this should ever be bought, by anybody. Good thing is was free to me. Pass on this, and go with Busch (or Budweiser, PBR, Coors) instead, if you have to drink a ""lite"" macro."
"If you are goingt to drink this beer because of low carbs,you should not drink anything at all.It makes you think is there a real different between having a good beer with 100 to 120 carbs or punish your self with this beer for some carbs???"
"And the taste... where to begin? No, really, where? There's almost no flavor here. It's a little sour and a touch bitter but overall it's just fizzy. There's not much else to say other than people who drink this probably don't like beer in general. I suppose you could drink a hundred of them if you really wanted to, but why put yourself through that? Another bland, mass-market lager."
"Next time I will pass, even if it is free. I am not slamming it, it just is not my style. To each their own."
"Pours a straw golden pale empty nothingness. Not much of a head to speak of and what is there is gone soon after. Smells like water with a splash of beer. Kinda of muted all around. Taste is halfway decent for macro lagers. I like it better than the few others I've had. Mouthfeel is very light and empty. Only a slighty dirty, grainy mouthfeel can describe it. Drinkability is fairly low although it's supposed to be light and easy to drink. I'd much rather buy some Yuengling and enjoy that for about the same price than drink this for an evening."
"What can I really say about this, looks bad, smells like air and tastes like flavored water. At a concert it is all you can get, so its what you are left with. Pale yellow carbonated water that has to be drank freezing or it is completly untolerable, please look somewhere else."
"this is, hands down, the worst ""beer"" i have ever had. the pinnacle of american macro lagers as far as tasteless swill goes. it is utterly devoid of any aroma and taste. spritzy, though! and only 64 calories! low carbs! why even drink ""beer"" if you're going to reduce yourself to this? nothing is the only thing i can say about this one. congrats to the brewers at a-b, you absolutely cannot top this...years of taking flavor and aroma out of beer, all that expertise has culminated in this. take a bow, please."
"This is more like bottled carbonated water than beer. Thin, watery, very little color, very little head, no lacing, very little aroma, very little taste. Mind you, it's not unpleasant, it's not awful and it's not skunked. There's just not much here. For one dollar a bottle, you could get much more -- and you should."
"D: not that easy after drinking a few of them"
"I'm glad I'm not watching my carb intake and I don't have to drink this."
"Pours a pale yellow color with no head or lacing. The smell is nothing, nada, zilch. I gave it a 1.5 because it didn't smell bad. The taste is the same, nothing. You can drink this beer while working out. I thought I might have tasted something but I cannot find it again amid the high carbonation. The feel is watery, bubbly. This is yellow soda water, nothing else. If you are looking for a beer, you do not want this."
"I give them big points for producing what they intend and getting it all the way down under with negligible loss in quality. It's clean and wet, not much else to it but importantly to me there are not any faults other than perhaps too fizzy."
"Had a good head at the start then almost totally dissapeared into nothing. The color is strange being that it is absolutely crystal clear very light yellow. Scattered bubbling carbonation is seen with spooty traces of foamy lace. It looks like yellow tinted water basically. If I am going to drink Macro-produced beer this and Coors light is always the usual choice. It doesnt taste that bad and goes down real easy, plus it has like 95 calories a can.The mouthfeel is overly carbonated making it real filling. Dry refreshing finish with almost no bitterness or hop character at all. It's basically a bubbling malt beverage with a low ABV. Has a light sweet rice or corn with a faint wheat taste. The only thing this cheap beer is good for is impressing people with how many cans you can finish off. The aroma has a faint malt aroma with no hops but has the typical lager smell. Good beer for a cookout, but not worthy of a session beer."
"Not a beer that I would recommend."
"I would recommend this beer to those who like Michelob Light and water."
"D - If you are thirsty, this is as good as water. This is no real beer though. For someone just looking to get drunk with as little interference from the tastebuds as possible, this is you weapon of choice. I'll never drink this again."
"Appearance: An ultra-clear yellow. Like a thimble of urine poured into a liter of water. The only thing that saves this from a 1 is that it has a head. Nose is incredibly faint grains. Taste is mild corn, and nothing else. Mouthfeel is thin and watery. Drinkability is similar to that of water."
"Overall: A true ultra-light: light taste, light body, light enjoyability. A terrible excuse for a beer; even thinner than a Coors Light. Avoid."
"I though I would see this beer in museums by now, but long after the Atkins diet fad, I still see people drink this stuff. Speaking of Atkins, how is eating a pound of bacon healthier than eating one apple? I'm not going to buy into something like that, and neither should you. The only reasons to drink this are to add to your beers reviewed list and to remind you this is ""beer"" to the lowest common denomenator."
"As the joke goes, light beers are like doing gymnastics on the beach - flippin' close to water."
"Drinkability: One could drink many of these if he did not desire flavor and complexity. I found it rather tasteless and boring."
"At first glance this beer's appearance isnt as bad as other light macros but, as they say, looks can be deceiving. Hardly any aromas to speak of. Maybe some mild metallic and corny husk. This beer literally tastes like seltzer with a bit of malt flavoring added. It's just awful. It's about as light as a beer can get. This is what people who don't really like beer drink or chicks who think they are watching their weight. Big time pass on this."
"Decided to review this after it was left in my fridge after New Years Eve. Poured a lighter than pale yellow with a thin-carbon filled head. Similar to a soft drink. It smells bready with little substance. This is continued into the taste... bready with little taste and heavy carbonation. The carbonation dominates the mouthfeel. If you can drink carbonated water, this is drinkable. Poured this one out after 1/3 of the glass. No thank you."
"I am not a lager drinker normally, but got this purely because of this site, so I could review it. I must be getting sad in my old age!"
"However, you are all overlooking the actual best usage for the beer. It does make a good marinade for shellfish. We've also used it before as the base of steaming shrimp and crabs. Cheap, easy, and doesn't pain me to use because I don't want to drink it."
"I really dont know why people wouild spend money on this stuff. if you are that weight and health conscious, just drink water out of the tap, and forget about paying for the dark bottle and Michelob label."
"Poured out with the faintest of light golden color, crystal clear, and bubbly, zero head retention. The nose gave me nothing, a tiny amount of grain perhaps. This drank like acrid spring water, more like ""hmmm, what's that off flavor in my water"" than ""hmmm, where's the flavor in my beer?"" Strangely enough, it went from no taste to foul tasting after finishing off the bottle. This beer is yet another testament to why people shouldn't go on the Atkins diet. I can't help but believe that if I drank this for a few hours straight, there would be no discernable difference between the liquid going into my body and the liquid coming out."
"An all around average beer. I don't see why everyone rated this quite as low as it is. There was actually a bit of head and lacing with this beer so I can't knock the appearance. The taste is relatively bland and watered down, but there is some dry malt taste and a bit of spice to keep it fresh. Mouthfeel is thin for my liking."
"Very uneventful light body that is fizzy, watery and made for the masses that don't mind this style...where's the alcohol?"
"If you are looking for a light beer with at least some flavor, Miller High Life Light might be more up your alley (with similar calorie content as this)."
"Are they sure this is beer?? I thought it was just carbonated corn starch and water. I just hope people that drink this (like my future mother in law) can try to find a light beer that isn't insulting to the name. Like Sam Adams Light maybe."
"D- When they say light beer, they aren't kidding. Light color, no smell, light taste. Avoid at all cost. I am almost more dissappointed when I hear someone order this than if they order Bud Light. It may seem gimmicky but I don't think this one will go away anytime soon."
"The drinkability is really not very good, even free I am not going to finish it, but 3/4 gives me enough to work with here. Stay away. MK"
"Crisp feeling on the palate, goes down easy. Better than some 'Lite' beers, but still not my type."
"Its not repulsive, but you might as well just drink sparkling water."
"Cheers!"
"If you are looking for a ""good"" beer, this is not it. If you are hoping to save a few calories (and especially carbs), this can't be beat. Smell is kind of funky, the taste is quite waterish and it will take about 4 before you feel any buzz whatsoever. Essentially this beer is good for what it was created to be...a low carb macro-brew."
"Even for a light beer, Michelob Ultra is pretty underwhelming. Light yellow in appearance, with a simple smell, and near non-existant taste. Carbonated, watered-down beer. Towards the end, it's hard to finish. Would be fine if you were desperate or having a burger or hot dog at a BBQ and trying to avoid the calories, but Sam Adams Light, Amstel Light or even Bud Light would be a better choice."
"I hope to never drink this again, only did this one because it was free."
"Overall, a good substitute if your tap water is contaminated."
"Drinkability comes from the lack of any non-water flavor to speak of...quite possibly, the worst macro brew that I have ever imbibed."
"Michelob Ultra is horridly pathetic. Honestly, Bud Light has more taste and thicker mouthfeel, and thats saying something. Appearance leaves a lot to be desired. Thinnest of thin heads. Poured yellowiest of fizzy yellow lagers. Smell is in the distance, as the taste. What little taste there is, is of warm corn. Mouthfeel is also thin as a sheet of paper. The upside?!!?! You can drink it like water! Go ahead; it wont make ya choke up! No beer characteristics to be afraid of! In fact, I was questioning myself as to if there was any alcohol in this beer."
"It has a very pale yellow color with a small, fizzy head. The smell is hard to desrcibe because it doesn't really smell like anything. The taste slightly resembles a lager, but for the most part it tastes like water. Mouthfeel was also rather water-like. I gave it a 2 on drinkability because you could easily drink alot because it is so light."
"Clear pale straw with a fizzy, white, soda-like, rapidly-diminishing head. Smells of weak grain, light doughy yeast and light metal. The taste is so mild its ridiculous, but its not offensive. It has a thin body, watery, soda-like texture and very lively carbonation. Sure, its refreshing I guess, but so is water. A why-bother kind of beer."
"M/D- This beer was very light(hence how it is marketed), almost water like in body with high carbonation. I could see how you might drink this on a hot day to cool down, but not too much for the pure enjoyment factor."
"Why bother with this one..."
"In a word, no. Not again, anyway."
"Cheers2Beers"
"The last time I saw something this color was in the urinal. Not much to the pour with corn in the nose. Taste was watered-down to get to be ""Ultra"". This beer gives the Michelob Premium brand a bad name...if it's possible. I'd rather drink water and this was my first and last Ultra....and it gave me a headache to boot. Thanks, Augie."
"Michelob Ultra came served on tap in a pint glass, it was a typical macro yellow with no head. Smells and tastes like corn. It's just not very good. Drinkable at ice cold temperatures, preferably on a hot day. In other words, lawnmower beer. Not recommended."
"WTF?!?!?! This is a good working definition of what a beer shouldnt be. But think of how many calories I saved!"
"This is the worst beer of all time. Avoid if possible!! No hops, all water, no flavor. Makes you wanna vomit. Michelob dry was good, and not available any longer, this watered down mess is the residual of carb nutheads gone wild! Not recommended whatsoever!"
"The color of this beer was very light and had a very light aroma that smelled faintly of malt and adjuncts. The taste wasn't very much of anything to be honest and was nothing more than crisp. The mouthfeel was like carbonated water and was of a medium/high carbonation. I'm not trying to be hard on this beer, but it's hard to consider a beer drinkable when there isn't much taste to it. If you are that concerned about calories, than just drink water. In summary, irregardless of personal biases, I felt that this beer was less than impressive when it comes to taste and quality."
"This is water. There is no color to it, there is no aroma, there is nothing. It's called ULTRA LIGHT for a reason. There is an ULTRA LOW amount of beer quality in this beer. If you want a low carb beer go for miller lite."
"D- Well it's drinkable in the way that water is drinkable. Seriously I could get away with drinking this while I was working out. Perhaps hydration is the one value to gain from Mich Ultra. This is seriously the worst beer I've ever had in my life. I can't even think of what is second on that list now, its memory has been clouded by this beverage."
"Poured perhaps the palest pale , very clear , with bubbles quickly rising but no head. Smell is very clean , some light corn and adjunct aroma , not much , bit of grain. Taste is crisp , carbonated , extremely light , and clean. Not much flavors to describe really. Mouthfeel is bubbly and crisp. A drinkable beer , its just that i don't want to drink it , if that makes sense. Much better beer out there , don't waste your cash. Unless you don't like flavor in beer or are an extreme calorie counter."
"Drinkability: Looks like water, tastes like water, it must be water. This might even be cheaper than water in some places."
"This ultra-lite beer is kind of like catching a 400 lb Marlin on 4 lb test. It looks good for an instant then it's long gone. Deep yellow color. Has a little bit of lacing. Smell is faint sweet hops. Taste is alot of carbonation with some hints of beer flavor. Kind of a beer flavored soda water. Once again as most AB products, I believe this is designed to be dranken ice cold on a blustery summer day. If this were the case right now, I could drink a case of these."
"I can't really smell this. It is light and watery, but for its style, it isn't bad. For beer, it is terrible, but comparing it to other American Macro Lager offerings, not bad. I tried to keep that in mind when making my review. I was at a movie theater, so the cup was frost-colored plastic. Still, from what I could see, it was very light colored and pale. It retained a thin head for a long time. As it warmed, the malts became more defined. It tasted slightly fruity. There was no identifiable hops taste. Given the choice between this and city water, which tastes like a swimming pool, I'd drink this. (That was my choice.)"
"I had five of these left in my fridge by a friend, I didn't purchase them so I thought I would review this beer. Poured into a 20 oz. pint glass, the color is lite yellow, emphasis on the word lite. There is alot of carbonation in the glass as well. There is an aroma there in the first scent, but I can not place it, it is very faint. Taste, is very similar to water, no taste at all. In the mouth it feels like water, with carbonation added with coloring to make it look like beer. It is very easy to be negative toward this beer, because of the brewery it comes from. It is valiant effort to make a beer low carb, but they left the taste at the door. This beer fits the description of Monty Python's line from the Bruce sketch, American beer is like making love in a canoe..."
"I could go through every category and describe this beer but that would be a waste of time. I guess it's ok if you're looking to cut some calories or carbs, but for the beer enthusiast it offers very little that you couldn't get from a bud, miller, or coors light, which are equally as bland, they just sport a smaller price tag. Save your money."
"Heineken, Bud, Bud Light, Bud Select, and Michelob Ultra."
"All in all, this is the second best beer to give to your girlfriend to drink if she refuses to drink beer, behind Labatt Blue Light. Take it for what it is, it certainly it is not the beer drinkers light beer."
"poured a very pale yellow color with moderate white puffy head that quickly disappeared. Smell is minimal with only a slight sweetness noted. Taste is very light and non-offensive, really not much to describe evcept for a slight swweetness. Finish is refreshing but not hops found. If you need to drinka low caerb beer, this one is OK."
"drinkability - I couyldn't even finish one of these."
"Pours a slightly yellowed clear color with a 2 finger head that falls to nothing over top. Very active carbonation bubbles from the bottom of hte pint glass. Nose is faint whisps of grain and corn sweetness, but very faint. Flavor is just as faint as the nose. Hints of adjunct sweetness and very light grainyness. Feel is watery with an active carbonation. Drinkable beer, but for all the wrong reasons. Not something I would keep around. This takes the light lager to a new level of bad."
"The pain of the fizz mixed with the horrible flavor made me dump this out drinking less than half of it. This is an incredibly bad beer, and not in the usual macro ""tastes like nothing"" sense. This actually tastes like feet."
"Very nice look, little head but very clear & yellow as desired for style. The aroma is awful, though - it has a very odd chemical-corn smell and a hint of sulfur. The flavor is OK for style, which isn't saying much but I'm gonna rate this one by style, what the hey? Its crisp & clean, bland, easy to drink. A very faint sweetness at the end and a touch of bitterness as well that rapidly subsides are the only things I can pick up. Mouthfeel is light, OK for style, and the beer is somewhat drinkable. Not a great beer, not even that great of an American Macro. To me, the biggest tragedy is I""ve been on low-carb for a while, it works, its great, but its ""low carb"" NOT no-carb and its much better to drink a hefty good beer with more carbs than this crap, unless you drink 6 beers every night (which I don't). I cut carbs in sweets and some starches, NOT in beer."
"This is one of the worst beer i even drinking, his taste is like a budweiser family beers, the same poor flavor, made whit rice, and ""choicest hops", printed in its label, its appearance is good, only with a accentuated hops smelling, i dont recommended for nothing, less for a thirst quencher."
"Bring on the Natty Ice, Ill take that hangover over this swill anytime."
"Mouthfeel is thin like water with brash carbonation that attacks the entire mouth. Seems way overcarbonated to me. Had this brew for free as it was in the work fridge. Nothing I'd ever seek out on my own. Boring, boring, boring...not much more to be said."
"Speaking of running - this is the ""beer"" you pour in your water bottle before you take off on a half-marathon. Or at least that's what the advertising would have you believe. Sooner than later the carb-craze will die, and MicUltra will be one of the casualties. No sad farewell. Just chuckles years down the line when asked ""hey, remember when there was low-carb beer?"""
"Born on date: 29 Jul 05.as if it mattered."
"I actually heard someone at a bar who had just tasted it say ""wow this is really good"". And then I shot him in the ass."
"Tried at the local sports bar. It's not bad...in the same way that water isn't bad. Nearly completely clear except for vague yellowing. Well overcarbonated, with slight bit of fizz for a head and slight lacing. Aromas are extremely light and grainy. Tastes very light of cereal grains: rice, corn, and maybe a little barley. Has a light metalic or rust flavor, but slight. Body is very thin and light. Carbonation masks any flavor or texture in the body or aftertaste. Finishes grainy and suddenly. Just slight of crisp or dry. No alcohol and light hop character. Very lackluster."
"If Mich wants to make a beer for active people they should try adding gatorade or at least something that would give a more pleasant flavor and aroma than the insoles of my running shoes."
"Drinkability is good for this beer though, it's easy to chug. This is a good beer for beer pong, flip cup, or any other drinking game. As far as sitting down and actually enjoying a good tasting beer, I would not recommend this one."
"This is not beer. Ersatz beer is more accurate. How this can be marketed as beer is beyond me. Watery with absolutely no head, no color, and no taste. How AB keeps gaining market share with this is unbelievable. You want low carbs? Eat one less potato chip and have a real beer."
"Pours a white, five finger head that vanishes within a minute leaving no lace . Clear, very pale amber color. Very light carbonation and very light bodied. Nose is faintly hoppy and malty. Starts on the sweet side but tastes like flavored water. Finish is like drinking water - nothing there. $1.49 for a 12oz bottle from Concord Farm, Concord, NH."
"This is a very pale beer, very light yellow color. Virtually no head retention or lacing, reminds me of club soda. Taste and smell are very light,added carbonation makes for a pleasent mouthfeel. It succeeds in its style of a very light, low-carb beer you can drink without becoming intoxicated quickly. This is an excellent choice for those willing to exchange taste for drinkability."
"Very light beer, with the attitude of a very light beer. There is very little smell, taste, feel or appearance to this beer, but thats what its for. It pours light yellow, with a slight malt smell. Tastes very watery and very plain with very little alcohol. Plus side is that if your looking for a beer with little kick, some alcohol, but fewer cards and calories, this beer has it."
"I could drink glass after glass of this, and I don't find anything wrong with the flavor, however, this does not qualify to be a beer by any means. It is the closest to water that you will ever get, except that you get drunk eventually. Michelob ultra symbolizes all that is wrong with the beer industry."
" Although not bad in any way, I don't see the reason for making, or buying this stuff."
"Tasted: 06/17/05"
"Lacking in taste, this beer is fast to drink, if you can avoid the day old frat house smell. Again, better to just leave it in the bottle to reduce the aroma. I guess it's better than drinking warm scotch, but not by mutch."
"Of all the light beers I drank at a recent wedding this was the easiest to get through. It look like colored water with no lacing left by the head of white bubbles. There was some taste to this beer of cook grain. This beer only survives past water due to the high carbonation level. I see beer farts in my future. I would drink this if I had to have a light beer, but most likely I would have a scotch on the rocks."
"Notes: Not really a fan of the whole attempt to get carbs out of beer. So you save 40 calories or so, go run for 3 minutes every beer you pound down. You lose too much flavor, which may be a good thing with some of the mass produced beers."
"Okay, it was the lesser of two evils. However, this was not so bad today . . . hanging out at the Wachovia Open in Charlotte during the third round. Beautiful day to enjoy a beer, so what the heck. Typical light beer qualities. Very easy to down, especially in 85 degree heat. Not a bad memory in the least."
"to say this beer is watered down is an understatment. i guess this beer would be good for someone on the low carb diet, other than that i see no real use for it other than ocassional because although the taste is nearly nothing it still has more taste than bud light, but that does not say much."
"This was beer?! Had this been a blind tasting, I would have thought someone snuck in a sample from the local urology lab. It looked like someone had accidentally spilled a drop of yellow food coloring in a glass of tap water. There was no aroma (since when does tap water have an aroma other than chlorine?). The mouthfeel was a cross between a very old Alka Seltzer tablet and a flat Tab. It primarily tasted like stagnant pond water with a slight suggestion of a hop or an open, month-old near-beer. But other than that, it was pretty good..."
"I dont know what to say about this that hasnt already been said. No taste at all, whith little to no smell. Carbonation is really high and it taste like club soda. I think there trying to faze out this product with the new bud select. The sad thing is I could most likely drink about 10 of them cause its so close to water."
"I think the best way to describe this beer is - selzer. You know the unsugared, but slightly flavored kind. Just a little bitter, just a little flavor and a bunch of suds in your mouth. Perhaps the least flavor I've ever tasted in a beer (and would probably rank below several brands of selzer water)."
"D- If I rated this solely on the BJCP style guidelines it would have been a high rating for its class but I just don't get any malt or hops or even adjunct flavors because it is so light. It is refreshing to drink but its not my choice when I want to drink ""beer""."
"Drinkability: I'm going to have to give the others away. I had a freebie from the Bud distributor when this came out. I thought it sucked. Now I don't think it sucks, I kknow. The number one thing I had heard, and an opinion I also formed is that regular beer drinkers (and I'm not just talking BA here but BMC guy) do not like this, but the casual beer drinker (especially one up for the low carb fad) loves it. I have seen this first hand."
"The problem with this ""beer"" is that, if you have it after you've had any other sort of beer, you can't taste it. After having Stoudt's American Pale Ale, I wanted to see exactly if Mich Ultra would be ok. I didn't expect seltzer water. In a pint glass, set next to my beer, it looked like someone put a drop of gold coloring in Sprite. The taste, nonexistent."
"Ummm well, new low carb beer. Poured this into a glass, looks like what you would expect from an adjunct beer, a very light golden color, with little head, and very bubbly. The nose is well, hard to describe, maybe mineral water with some very subtle graininess. The taste is like the nose, mineral water and some slight grains. Mouthfeel very bubbly, agian like sparkling mineral water. Drinkability could theoretically be a five, but at 95 calories a bottle, I would rather drink san pellegrino mineral water. Low carb and most lite beer is garbage. Just drink one real beer instead of two of these no taste beers, and you will be consuming almost the same amount of calories. America, eat less french fries and drink more beer, real beer!!!"
"Good grief, just drink water and save your money  NO calories or carbs that way. This carbonated seltzer water with a beer name has to be the weakest stuff Ive ever had. Doesnt have a *bad* taste, but should no taste, aroma, mouth feel actually count as a beer? Still, I finished it, so its not getting a bottom of the barrel score."
"I had no problem downing this ""beer"". Hell, it was like drinking water and I do that all day. However, as beers go, this is simply taking advantage of those people out there fearful of carbs and lacking much beer appreciation. As for me, I came, I drank, I won't have it again. Any BA seeing me holding one in the future has my permission to beat me to a bloody pulp. I deserve it."
"I hate it when our company sends completely beer-ignorant employees out to pick up drinks for an event. Last time they sent me, I came back with over $130 worth of Unibroues, Chimay, Stone Brewing, Hobgoblin, Weihenstephan, Fuller's, etc."
"Overall-I don't hate this nearly as much as I thought I would, not a bad choice for those just starting on beer but the market it's intended for is idiotic. You should definitley choose others over this (i.e. non-light beer) but this does carry decent quality I guess."
"if any of you who are beer advocates like this beer, then you should be ashamed. so light that you can see through it, no head, no taste, no nothing. you dont even save yourself calories or whatever if you were to drink a real beer. it should be taken off of the isle forever"
"I tried this one just out of curiosity. It was born on December 2, 2004. It poured a pale, pale yellow with a slight white head that seemed to vanish instantly. The smell is... of... um... not much, maybe some malt and a touch of hops, but that's it. The taste is very light and left a strange aftertaste that words cannot quite describe. The mouthfeel is very, very thin and a bit too carbonated. It's like drinking seltzer water. I'll make it a point to never drink this one again. It is the polar opposite of what I usually drink."
"Again scores are in comparison to style, not all beers."
"What else can you expect: Low carb, light beer. Not a whole lot to else to say. Looks watered down yellow color, no head to speak of. Tastes watered down too. A friend knew we were trying the low carb diet and was ""nice"" enough to bring this back from a trip to the States, because it is way better than other low-carb beers. Thanks alot. Please get this out of my fridge - it is not beer."
"I have better lacing and head retention when I pour a can of Sprite. The only differance is that I would drink the Sprite! PS, I only looked to see if this ""beer"" was listed because I was certain it wouldn't have been. I have to go drink a 90 Minute now and forget about the horrors I have witnessed here today."
"not much smell or coloring...i was very dissappointed with this beer."
"On the plus side, it is somewhat thirst-quenching. But then so is water."
"Drinkability- See taste above. Better than I expected. Not much flavor though. Did the job at hand though. Quenching my thirst at 90 plus degree temperatures."
"Drinkability: Fizz stale beer flavor water! Whoo hoo! I'll have another and a swift boot to the head please!"
"Final Thought: I apologized to my taste buds, and I'm not joking about this!"
"I was at my friend's house and look to see what beer they have and all they got is a case of this. What the hell I'll give it a try. The pour leaves a super light pale appearance with a medium head that goes down after a few seconds. Smell is odd and not too good. There's a corn and mud smell to it. Amazingly the taste is nothing. I don't know how they do it, water has more taste. Maybe I should give higher ratings because this is probably a good beer to the crowd A-B is making it for (people who don't like beer or flavor), but to me this sucked. I guess it was somewhat crisp and washed down my lunch but that's about it. Probably good for drinking games as well."
"The original owner of this beverage said the following when she handed over the bottle: ""I don't like beer and I only drink this because it tastes less like beer than any beer I've ever had. It has to be ice-cold though or I won't touch it"". That says it all, don't you think? The plain truth is that Michelob Ultra isn't beer at all, but anti-beer. For that, it deserves every bit of hostility thrown its way. And more."
"Embarrassingly, I've tried this shit. What a pitiful excuse for a ""beer"". Low carb beer? It's worse than decaf coffee. It's worse than sugar-free candy. It's even worse than non-alcoholic beer. It's like seltzer water that got left for 20 years in a septic tank. Nasty shit. Atkins people are going to be the death of modern society."
"Not really much to say about this stuff. It's pretty popular with girls..."
"Here's a piece of advice. If you're on the low-carb kick and you still want some kind of brew, do yourself a favour and pick up some Aspen Edge from Coors. It's still beer flavoured water, but it has alot more flavour than this stuff has."
"While this beer would be extremely drinkable by the sheer fact that it would do down like water, I couldn't see being able to drink this often, or more than in a setting anyway, if that. And, yes, this beer was proof that my favorite kind of beer is free and cold."
"Here are some characteristics -- carbonated, watery crap flavored like bad beer."
"Pours like a typical pilsner but lighter. Reminds me of piss after I have put down a few juggs of water. Slight color, lots of carbonation. I guess they took out carbs and added water and carbonation in its place. Imagine Keystone Light mixed 50/50 with water without the aluminum can taste. If you can imagine that, you hit this beer right on. Who would pay for this? I'd rather drink half of any other beer than drink a full one of this if I was truely in it for watching my carb intake. Does anybody else realize that alcohol is one of the simplest sugars...worse on you than sugar. Hmm, don't ever buy this, or even drink it when offered. I once had this on ice...yes poured over ice, horrid."
" Here's my plan. I shit on the roof of my car and then buff it all over the damn thing. If anyone asks, I tell them it's Shine-ola and I'm the only supplier. If all goes as planned, two months later I'm rich. Ya gotta love stupid people. Anheuser and Busch do."
"This beer poured a pale-pale yellow, very watered downed yellow in color. It was crystal clear and super carbonated, tons of dancing bubbles (probably one of the most carbonated beers that I have come across to date). After a semi-vigorous pour it produced a fairly thick foam, between 1 and 2 inches high. It was not to dense, more on the light and airy side (cloud like). It was pure white in color, and had a lasting power that was fairly decent; it finally fell to nothing around half glass. There was some lace present in the beginning but it ran down the sides and disappeared faster then the head. The aroma was on the light side, hints of grains, husks (corn) and a light malt, more sweet then malty. All and all the aroma was nothing outstanding but was crisp, light and airy, like the head that was produced. The taste was allot like the aromas, light, airy, and on the sweet side. Flavors of sweet light malt dominated along with a grainy husky corn presence all through the mouth from first sip on the lips and tongue to it made its way down the back of the throat. There was a slight aftertaste of some sweetness and grains, but it quickly faded. It was very light in body. Over all impression of this beer, it is a good beer compared to most of its competitors, nothing much as far as aromas and tastes. It leaves nothing to make you want to come back for more. But I can say it is a crisp, clean, refreshing beer that on a hot day did its job. I swiped this one from my dads case that we keep for him for my house because he helps out so much, and I can honestly say, his stash is safe from me, I will not be raiding it."
"Never again."
"Color is almost totally lacking, just a hint of pale yellow. Some white foam, but quickly disappears. The aroma is mild: fruity, apple is hinted at, and the initial taste is harsh. A hint of malt, almost no hops  or flavor. Like a friend of mine said, why would anyone drink this when there are pilsners available? The flavor is more than limited, it is almost undetectable. This will definitely be my last Ultra."
"Would make a good fix if you ran out of soda water for scotch and soda."
"Well at the father in laws house and of course they are on the Atkins craze, so I decided to have one. Pours a very straw, very light light yellow, almost more clear than yellow with a carbonation head that fizzles down like carbonated beverages. The smell is very faint and clean, slight corn and grain. The taste is very light, it did feel crisp in the mouth but little flavor that said drink me. I would not drink this again ever, I just wish this low carb craze will go away. Here is the crazy thing, this sells for 5 bucks a sixer, for a buck more you can get great lagers."
"Got a sixer of this just for something to do. Pours ultra pale, like watered down bud light. Taste is non-existent. I'm not a big fan of this low-carb fad that's sweeping the beer industry, but if you are gonna hop on that bandwagon, grab some Aspen Edge, it's smoother and less offensive.."
"Drinkability- I wouldn't drink this again, but it wasn't so terrible as to make me loath Michelob Ultra. Its just too light to have any personality."
"I hope that this low-carb thing doesnt become any bigger, and I hope it dies like all bad ideas should"
"Well, maybe not no taste. A bit of corn/rice adjunct and carbonation, but even less than bud light. No bitterness, no hops, no real beer taste. Here's my theory on how they actually make Michelob Ultra... they take a vat of carbonated water, add yellow food coloring, through in some corn husks and let it soak just long enough to get that taste, bottle it, label it low carb and it's on its way to the health conscious women of America."
"Why waste money on a 6 pack of this when you can just get bottled water. Seriously sad beer. I will give it credit that it has no off flavors like some macros; its very quaffable, but still. I kept taking sip after sip and huge sniffs of the nose writing this review and all I had written for 10 minutes was carbonated water"
"*This is truly the worst lager I've ever had*"
"This beer is like sex in a canoe-it's fu**ing near water. Pours a pale, pale yellow, (almost clear) with little to no head. I have had bottled water with more taste than this garbage. No smell to speak of, mouthfeel is non existent. I can only give a higher mark for drinkability simply because the stuff goes down so easy, but so does water. Ultra is a fitting name for this beer, it ultra SUCKS."
"Not nearly as bad as I thought it was going to be."
"Just got back from drinking some great brews in Oregon and decided I need to cleanse the palate with a Michelob Ultra left in my fridge. It cleaned me out alright; about halfway through my stomach started rumbling and I was running to sit on the john as my bowels purged themselves. For all purposes, there is no smell and this beer has a salty flavor to it. It feels like it fizzes when it hits my tongue. Only good thing is if I really had to or really wanted to I coud probably drink a lot of these."
"Anyway, among the really good beers that I have been drinking for the past hour now, I had to try the infamous Mic Ultra. Of all the beers in the world, this one should be casted away to some island. Even Crazy Ed's Cave Creek is better than this because it's original. This is a joke. It has a super pale transparent yellow colour with no head. The smell was non-exsistant as was the taste. Obviously cutting carbs means cutting taste and quality."
"Consider this research for academic purposes. I've come up with my own marketing slogans, though: ""The Beer to Have When you Aren't Drinking Beer!", not to mention ""Lose the Carbs AND the Taste!"". Needless to say, now that I've encountered the enemy, I'll never have this one again...if I go on a diet, I'll give up beer first."
"It took me a long time to admit publicly that I like the BeeGees. Admitting to buying and drinking Michelob Ultra is just as difficult for me. But I will continue, until Sam Adams comes out with a 2.6 carb beer (hopefully better than their current light offering)."
"It is drinkable as in like a glass of water."
"How bad can cheap ass beer get?? You got your answer right here with michelob Ultra. I love the commercials AB puts out for this beer. People pumping iron and ""rewarding themselves"" by drinking this crap. HA! How can this stuff ever be considered a reward? It's just carbonated water! Tastes like water. Smells like water with a shot of rubbing alcohol in it. Feels like water with carbonation added. Hey it is water! Sometimes I really wonder how much it costs AB to make this stuff. Water costs close to nothing and ow much can CO2 cost, so I guess this beer cost AB practically nothing except for the cost of all those commercials."
"This is highly drinkable, but so is water."
"This might be the lightest beer that I have seen. Looks like water with a splash of yellow. Very small head that doesn't last. I smell almost nothing. Maybe a hint of something sweet like corn syrup. No hops and no malt. The taste is much like the smell. Nothing. I have heard a lot of people bitch about other light beers, but this one really deserves it. It is almost like they have stripped this beer down to nothing. There is nothing else they can take away."
"Drinkability  I cant believe Im writing this, but this beer isnt half bad."
"I thought the phrase ""beer flavored seltzer water"" was a beer snob exaggeration until I tried Michelob Ultra. It indeed tastes like seltzer water with a light beer flavoring, which is in no way an exaggeration. I don't even know what to write about; there's barely any taste to the beer whatsoever. The aftertaste is bready. That's about it. I'll have this again when I run out of water."
"Not recommended unless you do not like the flavor of beer.."
"Wow, I can't believe I drank this. At least I didn't pay for it. A guy I know brought it to our New Years Eve party. Yes I know that was days ago, I just couldn't bring myself to review this. Partly shame, partly that I want to forget the experience. Poured a very clear, very light yellowish color. Like someone put a drop or two of yellow food coloring in water. Those of you who couldn't smell this, be glad, the smell was horrid. Smelled like rotten egg. Very very gross. Made me want to put it back in search of something that I could stomach. Thankfully it didn't taste like it smelled. To be honest it tasted fairly close to Bud Light. Like a watered down rice beer. No hops to speak of. Light in the mouth. No bite. Just like drinking water as far as the mouthfeel went. Drinkability? They wish. I'll never drink this again. It took me a few hours to get over the smell of it. I suppose if you're on the Adkins diet and you are adamant that the beer is what caused the gut, then this could be the beer for you, however, as I observed, this is not the beer for me. I went right back to the Bully! Porter I brought and tried to drown my tastebuds in something they'd enjoy. I also appologized to them for hours."
"Palest yellow I have ever seen, not appetizing in the least. The head has some retention, probably because it is so light, gravity has no effect on it. There is absolutely no aroma at all. I practically snorted some just to be able to say something about it, but to no avail. The taste just sucks. Subtle husky grain and C02 bitterness. I swear this is club soda or seltzer water. Goddamn, this is a miracle of science to be able to make something with 4%alcohol look and taste like carbonated water."
"It's easy to bash this beer but it really does taste like water to me. Sparkling water with some beer essence in there somewhere. I have no other description to add to taste or mouthfeel but sparkling water. Very drinkable though. You could give this beer a 1 if it was the least bit offensive but it doesn't do much one way or the other. ""Goes down easy!"" But why would you want it to?"
"I can feel the unsightly flab melting away as I type this. This is the beer for people who believe what they see on TV. It's a macro trend that is all in all...crap. Miller Lite at least has some flavor to it, and not much more on the carb scale. If you're watching the carbs, drink Captain and Diet Coke, but skip this one."
"Drinkability: Ick. I can't believe I drank this, but my family had ordered it, and I thought I should see just how bad it was."
"Ultra is ultra bad! If you're watching your weight I suggest frinking slim-fast. Hell, mix slim-fast with gin for a Martini! It'll taste better!!"
"This is the least flavor of a beer that I've ever had. It has a tiny bit of that nuttiness that regular Michelob has, but it's so faint that you really have to be looking for it to notice it. It does have a little bit of a citrusy character to it that almost gives it character, but really it tastes kind of like city water."
"On the pour a lucent pale gold color, the head modest in size and white in color, the texture frothy and the lace a very thin sheet. Nose is crisp and clean, the start slightly sweet, top cadaverous. Finish stinging in its acidity, hops scarce, dry and a totally forgettable beer."
"This isn't beer as it pours the colour of carbonated seltzer water. The aroma is of water, and carbonation, as is the taste. NO hops, NO malts, NO ""beer flavor"". Mouthfeel is that of water, but the drinkability is non-existant! The fact that this stuff sells so well, just shows how many people are slaves to marketing. If you are on ATKINS just drink water, don't spend $17 a case for this junk...or hey, if you really like beer, go with Amstel light! That has only 95 calories and 5 carbs, and it actually has...get this...beer flavor to it!"
"Do you like water? of course you do. If you are ooking for a buzz, but like the taste of water, then MU is what you like. My gf likes it for the atkins aspect- but I still don't. I mean tis is water w/ abv, basically. don't drink it if you hafta, but if you like water, by all measn go for it"
"Ugh.... I don't know why I waste my time, but I have to be a completist! haha.... anyway, if you like this beer, do not read this review. In fact, you should leave the site. This is not beer in the true sense of the word. This is swill of the worst kind. Not only does it look bad, smell bad and taste bad, you have to PAY for this! What? Pay for water? What an outrage! Ah, well...I am glad it's over. No taste whatsoever to leave behind, so I guess that can be construed as a good thing.... otherwise, get thee behind me, any and all A-B products!"
"My Wife bught me a 12 pack, with the idea this would be a good beer to drink while trying to cut carbs. You know, the Atkins thing. Anyway probably good while on that diet, but for a lover of full bodied, hopped, micros and home brews, this one tasted like carbonated water. I really had to try to get some flavor here. I could do the same thing by putting a tablespoon of homebrew in an empty bottle, and fill it up with water, carbonate it, and there you go. Lots cheaper too."
"hmmm, did i have a bottle of 'perri-air', as seen in spaceballs, or was that a beer? it's questionable. this brew is light as hell, probably the lightest beer i've ever had. there are quite simply no characteristics here. it looks somewhat like a beer, but if it weren't for that i might not have known what u was drinking, as i couldn't detect a dominant smell or taste. the drinkability goes up because it's really like having a glass of water, but overall this just isn't a good brew. blah."
"This was actually not as bad as I had expected. The appearance was that of a regular light beer with less of a head that dissapeared when you blinked. The smell was the same of any other light beer. The taste was much better than I expected from this. It tasted good to me today. However there was a bit of a watery taste to it. The mouth feel left a lot to be desired, very watery. I could drink a lot of these in one setting. I guess that is what it is made for. However, just because I could drink a lot of these in one setting doesn't mean I will."
"Taste. If the colour was light the flavour was lighter. It tasted as if someone cut a Michelob light with tonic water. This is the white wine spritzer of beer. No real malt and the hops are there only if you really think about it.. Also seems overly carbonated. I guess you could say its got drinkability since its like drinking water. Actually I would prefer water to this stuff. Low Carbs be damned give me some flavour!!!"
"This has to be one of the worst beers that I have ever tried. I kept asking myself ""why, why, why."" The color was extremely light and not enticing, much like the aroma. No hop aroma what so ever and a taste that is almost non-existant. A very watered down beer. I had to put some hops in the beer to give it at least a decent aroma to help me finish the beer."
"The beer pours a pale, almost clear, gold color; very light. The head laces nicely. The nose smells like regular Michelob, but noticably lighter. The taste is very watery, but still maintaining the lager flavor. It goes down very smooth and finishes crisp. It's a gusler, no doubt and a bonafied ""chick"" beer. I guess if you enjoy macro-brewed lagers like Michelob, this is a beer you would be excited about. It's the old philosophy of less calories, larger consumption. I don't worry myself with calorie counts. What's the point? If a beer tastes good drink it. Like anything else in life; Use in moderation."
"Local bar has 50 cent macro draft specials, and I decided to try this finally (before getting a bottle of Dead Guy Ale). Light lemony yellow color is almost clear. The smell is sort of a faintly skunked psuedo-beer aroma. The taste is slightly metallic, like bad well water. The mouthfeel is exceptionally harsh, and the drinkability is very poor. I actually returned about 2/3 of the glass and asked for my Dead Guy. The ownwer knows me, and said 'I told you, you wouldn't like that beer'. They didn't charge me for it. That just got the <beer girl> a bigger tip. Anybody that would warn me against macro crap, then not charge me for it when I started coughing like Bill the Cat is OK in my book. But this beer definitely is not. A disgrace to the Michelob label."
"Not too bad for a low carb (4g) beer. Taste was pretty good, didn't smell great though. The appearance was pretty decent, Michelob invested a lot in their new formula with the type of barley they use. Also like the cover, always liked Michelob's design for the bottles."
"There has to be something wrong with this beer... it's skunked right? That is the major response that I hear working at an outdoor summer concert venue when poured, after trying this beer just now I can honestly say I understand what they mean. In all reality this beer is not beer it's a bastardized marketing concept by a conglomerate of a big business in the brewing industry of a USA mass produced, dumb down American light lagers. Marketed as the ""low carbohydrate"" light beer to pair with the ongoing trend of the Atkins diet, so if you ask me this beer is going to die just the same as all trends do and mark my words if this ever becomes a staple of the brewing industry of this country I may just find my way to another place. Smooth and refreshing lager beer this is false advertisement, but here goes my description pours quite a few shades short of golden with a highly carbonated artificial fizzy white head leaving no lace, sad looking. Aroma very mild hop aroma some sweetness and light cooked veggie tones with an nonexisting aroma might as well be carbonated water. Taste offensive in all regards tries to pass of shitty piss water as a ""lager beer"" with a harsh nonrefreshing cooked veggie psuedo hop profile that I could only pray would taste like water instead of it's current form. Mouthfeel is of over carbonated seltza water with the drinkability of urine."
"This beer poured a large white frothy head with small bubbles that fully diminished. There was a lot of fizzy carbonation in this beer. The body was clear and the hue was pale yellow. The aroma was skunky and there was virtually no flavor to this beer. The mouthfeel was very watery and thin."
"Low in carbs? Easy when you get 10 oz. in the serving. Not that it was any great loss. Overall, this was not a bad beer, at least not any worse than the run-of-the-mill macro lager - long on cooked cereal flavors. It really struck me as not being a beer at all. It is a mere echo of a beer, and could be called a ""lightly beer-flavored malt beverage," in the class with Zima and hard lemonade. If the low-carb bandwagon runs out of steam, they could market it as ""the beer for people who don't like the taste of beer."""
"There's not much I can say about this ""beer", as there was not much of anything present besides carbonation. Tasted like someone mixed 3 parts seltzer and 1 part Bud Light. Maybe they should have put it in a green bottle and called it Heineken Ultra. At least I could talk about the skunky flavor. For purposes of a review, I can't say the smell and taste were awful and give them 1's because they weren't awful, they were non-existent."
"This brew poured a large head of fine white bubbles and a weak watery urine yellow colored body. It has a very mild hop aroma, good lacing and a watery and thin rice beer flavor. No thanks, glad to get this one rated and off my list. This brew was a drain pour. Never again!"
"ok, so i compete in muay thai which means i really have to watch my weight. so i cant always enjoy that high alcohol stout or porter. sometimes you have to take one for the team, so i figured id try this. low calories and really low carbs, whoopdie doo. i didnt pour it out, i figured it wouldnt be impressive and would just be a waste of a glass. basically this stuff taste like seltzer water. its fizzy and has really no flavor at all. i mean, it dosnt even taste like a light beer. i cant describe it, because there isnt anything there. maybe ill just stick to good beer and do more sit ups. blah."
"someone had these on a recent camping trip, and i couldn't resist trying it. pours a very fizzy clear, clear yellow with an instantaneously disappearing head. no aroma to speak of. taste is watery corn-beer, like someone took a coors light and cut it with club soda. palatable if ice cold, forget it if it gets above 40 degrees. i can't even imagine people who like light beer liking this crap. what an f'n disgrace."
"Edit: I had to lower the drinkability factor by a point. This this crap not be drunk!"
"Why was I drinking this? My uncle insisted. I think I finished the bottle because it was empty, but my stomach didn't believe it."
"Very, very pale yellow with way too many bubbles. White head initally but this is a memory after the pour. Slight musty nose. Watery slightly sour musty malt taste. Tastes like overcarbonated light beer that has been filtered through a dirty old sock!"
"I decided to give this a try at a work get together where I wouldn't be stuck buying a whole six pack of the stuff. It poured a very pale straw color and formed a white foamy head that left trace lace as it quickly subsided. A small amount of carbonation is present. An aroma of grain with an almost chemical aspect to it. A flavor of grain. The finish is just too tart/bitter/etc. to really recommend this beer at all."
"Pours an absolutely crystal-clear, and exceptionally-pale straw colored body. Streams of standard-sized, fast-rising bubbles are quite noticeable and help to support it's good-sized, foamy, bright-white head. Its retention is surprisingly good and it leaves a very nice ring of lace at the outset, and then some decent lace throughout the glass. The aroma leaves something to be desired with a thin huskiness that detracts from it's very lightly grainy malt note. The body is light; and the creamy head lends a bit of softness to the crisp and effervescent carbonation that follows. As it releases it's gas it becomes even softer, and somewhat creamy in the mouth; but it's a trade-off because the carbonation actually helps to enhance the flavor that's there. The flavor is limited, but what else could be expected of a beer that's labelled as a ""low carbohydrate light beer"". There's some thin grainy malt present, and it's surprisingly well-balanced by a subtle interwoven bitterness, yet it seems lacking. It finishes almost without notice. Still, it's clean and refreshing. It might make a good beer at an outdoor sporting event in the summer, but other than that I don't think it has enough character to keep it interesting throughout even one bottle."
"Taste. Let's see. You know if you throw about an eighth of the required mix into an iced tea or lemonade and it tastes like funny water. That is what Ultra is. Ultra low watery flavor. A bit of grain, no hops, really no flavor. Much less flavor than flavored vitamin waters. For that reason, I can not give it good drinkability because it does not even strike me as a beer. It is not drinkable as far as flavored water goes. Wow, I can not believe people buy this stuff so much."
"Settled in at the tap corner of the local Cold Cheeseburgers and Bad Beer bar for a burger and a beer. So what tap pull is right beside my left arm? Mic Ultra. Happy hour discounts. Gotta try it, right? Big mistake. This is bad branding at its best. The Ultra label has got to mean something special, but not in this case. Ultra pale with almost no color whatsoever. No real aroma. No taste - which is a good thing considering that it's an A-B. No head. No lace. This is just Ultra bad."
"What the??? Is this really beer? I thought it was beer flavored water. I'd much rather drink water flavored water than waste my time on this ""beer."" Beers like this take the fun out of drinking. I drink beer because I like beer, not because I want to get drunk. This is not a beer made for people who like beer. Again: Yuck!"
"Bottom Line: Not the worst beer I’ve ever had (that remains Koch’s Golden Anniversary), but why drink it?"
"clear, pale, pale, pale yellow....thin foamy head. hints of lace. hints of adjuncts in the aroma. tastes of...um...nothing. seltzer water body. mineral water soul. there is some slight graininess to give it a ghostly like ""light beeriness"". crisp and clean. it's drinkable, but why would you want to drink this ""beer"" again? i swear i will NEVER drink this again as long as i live. worse than i expected...a shameful concoction."
"Good Lord, who's idea was this? Michelob light is decent, but this...damn. There is no color, no flavor, no head, no good. I can't believe that this beer is actually being touted as ""Keeping the Flavor"". I try to find some good in all the beers I review, but this one is impossible. Skip it, and if you ARE trying to keep the calories and carbs down, go for Miller Lite, as it's nearly the same levels, cheaper, and tastes better."
"""Lose the carbs. Not the taste."" What taste? Michelob Ultra has practically no taste except for its finish. Color is an extremely pale yellow with a thin white head. Aroma barely exists, except for some malt and alcohol. Extremely thin and watered-down mouthfeel. The taste was kind of like seltzer with the slightest malt flavor in the finish. Despite the low carbs, if I had to resort to a Lite beer I'd rather have Sam Adams Light. Even Miller Lite tastes better than this and that's not saying much. A boring and bland ""Diet-Beer"" that will initially sell as people are sucked into the hype of drinking a ""healthy"" alcoholic beverage."
"I've got nothing new to add to what's been said already. The only reason I didn't give it lower scores on taste and smell is because that it contains nothing patently offensive. It's just bland, tasteless, and odorless for the most part. It got a slightly higher drinkability score because (go figure) it goes down like water. I can't imagine that anyone who spends much time on this site will find this product worth his or her time."
"Incredibly pale golden color, strongly resembles seltzer water; quite lively carbonation with a decent snow-white head, good broken lace. Aroma is quite clean, perhaps because there is almost nothing there, just some faint malt. Taste begins with a little sting of carbonation and a washed out corn grits flavor, even that disappears quickly. There is perhaps a ghost of hop bitterness at the finish. A remarkably insubstantial beer."
"Michelob Ultra can best be described as watered down Michelob Light, which is in turn watered down Michelob. They all share the base flavor, which is something, considering that other lite beers often share no taste in common with their regular versions (e.g., Bud Light and Bud). Michelob Ultra pours to give one of the lightest golden beers I have ever seen; it hardly looks like beer. There is a faint aroma of malt. The taste is extremely thin: imagine a glass of club soda with a shot of beer added. There is almost no hop taste. The mouthfeel is extremely thin, not bad, but just like water. The drinkability is minimal (there is not a horrible taste, but just an almost complete lack of reason to want to drink this beer)."
"Somebody HELP ME!"
"Crystal clear pale yellow with alomost no head. Not much for aroma and the taste was barely there. But if you are looking for a beer to pound for a party this could be what you are looking for."
"There is a reason why 1.0 on our score here equals awful. This beer offers almost nothing that I can constructively critique. There is no aroma whatsoever, aside from some remnants of fermentation I suppose. However, there is some hint of flavor at the very onset of the sip. But that quickly dissippates into a bitter and bordering on nasty taste. That is not even including the after-taste. I know beer makers have to try to remain on the cutting edge, but the only thing that is being cut, after drinking this brew, is wind."
"Virtually no head; faint, dilute yellow color; zero aroma; almost no taste (possibly hints of cooked veggies); no hops. Curiosity let me down."
"Pale light yellow color, fizzy white head, not much aroma(chemical), like seltzer water, clean but no flavor, sad AB has to resort to this, I guess this one is for Ultra fitness freaks that shave their chest. I gave this one the lowest rating, I would much rather drink water, it really sucks."
"Resorted to this at a Holiday party when all the decent beer was gone. It was in a big galvanized tub of ice and was exceedingly cold which was probably a blessing. I drink macro-swill so infrequently that I am truly shocked when I encounter one. This beer comes from a marketing company that pretends that it makes beer. No color, no head, no mouthfeel, no taste....no point to it at all. Avoid it at all cost...even if it's free."
"Had the misfourtune of tasting this swill. A light beer drinking friend offered me a bottle, and not being one to turn away free beer regardless of how bad it is I agreed. Wish I never agreed! One word comes to mind when consuming this ""beer"" water! No head to speak of, no hop presence not anything! While this beer deserved ones across the board I gave it's drinkability a 1.5 simply because I can see how these could be drank rather quickly. Something that might appeal to the college crowd, or to someone looking for a quick buzz."
"This is either one of the worst beers I have ever tasted, or one of the best seltzer waters. Maybe I would try it again if I had a stubborn stain on my clothes. Keep drinking it to lose weight people!"
"Light clouded yelow color. Has a sour taste, but other than that, it has no taste. I am an athletic guy who has no need to watch carbs. If I did, i would drink this, because after 2 sips, you want to stop drinking, period. I guess that's the point of this crap."
"Happy Drinking Folks!"
"The only upside of it would be it would be refreshing it you had just mowed the lawn and wanted a very light chugging beer, but then, you shouldn't be drinking beer and should be drinking watet.  This should not be called beer."
"I have a feeling that this stuff is probably going to be the next ""beer fad"" (see dry beer, ice beer, etc.).  This stuff isn't repulsive, but the taste just isn't there.  Easy to chug, but that would ruin its dietary purpose, wouldn't it?  Verdict: just another watery light beer."
"I was actually dumbfounded about how bad this was is this a gimmick or will it stick around?"
"As can be expected, the color is straw, the head is non-existant, and the taste is corn."
"Ive had seltzer water with more character than Michelob Ultra."
"Michelob, its not my idea of ultra. It reminds me of a Pabst NA I used to drink. That means this beer is drinkable but....most likely with the ladies or folks who really watch those calories and are willing to make do. The carbonation is very high. It births a very fizzy, short lived head with no lace or film. The color is gold but looks flat and watery soon. Truth is, don't let the beer sit and go do something else, because it does flatten-out very quickly."
"This is not a beer. This is barely even a malt beverage. It has the color and carbonation of champagne, a winey/cheap champagne nose, a mouthfeel similar to mineral water and virtually no taste. It even feels like water as it settles into in my stomach. That's just not right. When you can actually smell the alcohol in a low alcohol beer (4.1%abv, 3.2%abw, same as the OK and UT requirements for convenience store brew) IT AIN'T FRIGGIN' BEER! It is so devoid of taste that it will actually help sales of beers like Sam Adams Light. Lite beer drinkers will eschew this tasteless Ultra crap en masse and ask the barkeep for a light beer with flavor. Then they will taste the Sam Light and howl uncontrollably and cause some poor guy to get a dart planted in his buttocks..."
"Whew, very pale slighly greenish color, only Beck's Light is paler in my experience.  Terrible head, gone in 10 seconds.  Not much of a sense of aroma to all, a little bit of grassy pea pod sense.  Gassy as all get out, fizzy from beginning to the stomach.  Vague quianine water flavor, slight artificial lemon, slight metallics.  Very unidimensional from front to back.  To me, this ""brew"" is an abomination, though it might make a good base for a cheap-ass punch at a frat party.  Sorry, can't recommend, even within style."
"Notes: Can beer get any lighter than this? Is this the base product for the production of malternative. This is light beer, so light there is nothing there. People who seek this beer out are people with boring beer palates. There are better light beers out there, even then what is the point? I compare this beer with baked fat free light nacho chips … its like eating air, what’s the point? Don’t even bother with this one as it is the most lackluster, boring, gimmicky brew of its time."
"This one was pale. It actually looked like it was 50% beer, 50% water. The only thing it smelled like to me was raw string beans. Hmmm... The foam hung in there for a little bit, maybe 30 seconds, and it kinda looked like it would form a rocky, white head. I was wrong, and it fell flat to nearly nothing a few seconds later. The taste of the beer is mainly cereal. No real hops to speak of here. I noticed an ever so tiny bit of sweetness in the finish. A minute bit of bittering hops would have this beer binish dry, which wouldn't be as bad. I'm glad I tried it, but by no means would I ever stock my fridge with this."
"This could be the clearest beer I have ever drank. More reminiscent of champagne in the glass. Pours out to a nearly crystal clear light yellow with a funny cooked veggie aroma. Taste is lightly sweet with virutally no aftertaste. No hops or malt presence at all. Tastes very, very similar to Miller Lite.  Very watered down with no body whatsoever."
"I agreed with my roomate/buddy (who is currently passed out on the couch) to fairly review all the AB products that he loves, as long he buys, or they are freebies. Here it goes.....Transparent faint yellow color, yeilds an overly bubbly head that leaves in a hurry. Smell is mostly grainy, and metallic. The only beer flavor is a faint sour stale finish and aftertaste like the stale beers you would sneak out of your dad's supply in high school. Excessively thin, even for a light beer. Can't get over the metallic/grainy whiff, easy to down, but not enjoyable at all....The biggest impression is the overall lack of any positive beerlike flavors....I used to drink Michelob light, before I knew what good beer was. This is a decent marketing job, but a lousy beer."
"Even for a light beer (which should always be judged on a different scale since they will never compare with a good non-light style) this is just terrible. I had some degree of hope since they put it out under the Michelob name, and not Budweiser, but this is as bad as beer gets. Unless your dietician is against any form of beer because of high carbs and they'll let ya slide with this.. stay away from it!"
"Michelob Ultra, ""the ultra low carbohydrate” beer from A-B.  It’s in a standard Michelob 12 ounce bottle, but with an over the top color scheme (that we’ll be seeing on a NASCAR any day now).  Can’t figure out why A-B is using Michelob for this and not Bud, but the Michelob name has lost all credibility with me anyhow.  The beer is about as you’d expect, pale looking macro-lager, adjuncty aroma with a more pronounced chemical smell.  Aggressive carbonation, if it had any flavor it was wiped away by those scrubbing bubbles.  Marketing came up with this one, and it tastes like it."
