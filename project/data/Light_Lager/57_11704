Only 3.7% it could be a marathon beer for a hot sunny day tailgating, and it's not has horrible as the reviews entail on this website. Aroma has a sharp chemical/slightly metallic smell with creamed corn and cooked canned vegetables all day. A bit of grain, husk, and corn resides in this beer. Flavor reveals a clean grainy, creamed corn flavor with minimal hop flavor going on. Overall a one dimensional canned beer from Mexico that has fulfilled some highlighted qualities like cold refreshing, macro lager status with a hint of cheap.

2.52,15.1,2,2.5,2.5,2,3,"Poured moderately yellow with no head. Smell was just light, sweet malt. Taste was like corn, sweet malt, and a hint of bitterness just to keep it real, because that's how Tecate Light rolls. It really wasn't that bad for a light beer, and it definitely wasn't offensive at all. No off flavors and went down like water. Thanks, Tecate light sample hander-outers.","JDV","Jan 19, 2008"
2.19,0,3,1.5,2,1.5,3.5,"D - Honestly, I'm on my honeymoon, so I'm inclined to be much more happy with this beer than I would be back home in Springpatch. But, it's a serviceable brew for beach-quaffing, and it's doing the job (despite the very low alcohol content :(....). Not a bad beach brew by any means, but it's not something to seek out in the states.","pmcadamis","Jan 04, 2008"

2.97,35.6,2.5,3,3,3,3,"For what it is it is. Nothing but a light beer made to kill thirst and help you avoid heatstroke. There is some actual taste to it and at this alcohol level you are unlikely to be getting drunk from a mug of it. A good substitute for water should you find yourself in Mexico or wanting something with a Mexican meal with a low alcohol punch.","Zorro","May 30, 2006"

4.05,84.9,4,4,4.5,3.5,3.5,"Light Mexican beer, its flavor is good, its aroma accentuated a little in spite of its lightness, its presentation is magnifies, very tends to be sold in my country, by his low carb, easy to digest and to taste, it is obtained anywhere, is not expensive, his appearance had the distinctive color of pilsener beer, drink directly from the aluminum can is good","tesguino","Aug 15, 2005"
3.58,63.5,4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"Well, I cannot say much in favor about a light beer, no matter what brand it is. BUt this at least does not taste awfull. Just a little of water tasting. BUt if you want to hang with your friends and not get drunk, then here you are. The flavor is a little close to Tecte regular, but you can get the light angle.","nekronos","Jun 01, 2005"

2.55,16.4,2.5,2.5,2.5,2,3,"reviewed 4-2-04 and taken from notes. Very light gold almost yellow. Full head which is white and full carbonation. Cut straw in nose and leans toward neutrality. Flavor is of the same cut straw and body is chalky, not right for style. All in all, not a bad attempt at a light beer.","jimbotrost","Feb 25, 2004"

2.32,5.9,2,2.5,2.5,2,2,"Tecate Light I believe is only found in Mexico. I had this when down in Puerto Vallarta with some friends. I had this in hot weather so in that case it hit the spot, very cold and crisp. It poured a light yellow with no head to speak of, minimul to no lacing. Smell is of light citrus and waterdowned hops. The taste has a minimul blast of hops and alot duller than regular version. Feels flat but crisp in mouth. Drinkable in the sultry sun of Mexico but on any given day this is not the beer for me.","beertaster13","0"
