If you are looking for a light beer that has a full-body feel and taste then this is the beer for you. All other light beers end up tasting like water with some beer in it by comparison. With that said, compared to Miller Lite, you'll be having an extra (approx.)thirty calories, but considering the trade off, it is well worth it. This is easily Miller's best ("light") beer. Well done!","jime","Nov 29, 2012"

If Miller Light is triple hopped, than this is too I guess, because there is a faint hop aspect to it.

Now, we had a strict anti-hazing policy, and my policy as pledge master was that I wouldn't make the pledges do anything I wouldn't do myself. I took one sip of the Southpaw, apologized, and went to get them Newcastle on my own dime to make it up to them. Maybe our batch was skunked, but I never bothered with Southpaw again to find out.","LittleLeity","Oct 21, 2008"

2.68,15.5,3,2.5,2.5,3,3,"Found this beer in Morristown TN. Fares pretty well compared to other light beers on the market, however I doubt if it is all that light. The flavors end up quite sweet with a blend of pilsner malts and cereal grains. Although indicating the beer is 'double-hopped' the beer only has a mild increase in hop bitterness and brings a grassy flavor that also becomes a bit metallic. Sulfer flavors and vegitable flavors are there but don't really kill the beer. Aromas reveal the same character but cleaner with the sweetness. Textures a a bit weighted for light beers and do deter a bit. Finishes pretty clean with a sweet, vegitable note. Pretty average throughout with a mild distraction here and there.","BEERchitect","Jun 04, 2008"

It taste much like it smells: Sweet and corny. A moderate carbonation gives it a clean soda like crispness that makes it somewhat refreshing. Considering the cost and quality comparison to other major American light beers, Southpaw is to me the way to go if you must.","ShredVicious","Nov 25, 2006"

Went down clean, cold, and with a 5.0% kick for under $3 a six pack which is all we wanted. Not the best tasting stuff, but not bah tasting either. Actually I would have to say it was pretty much just devoid of taste. My brother in law always called it "that left handed kangaroo beer."

Clean tasting, makes good for drinking games but that's about it.

Southpaw Light has sort of a PBR taste to it when you drink it out of the can (you make the call if thatÂ’s good or bad).
