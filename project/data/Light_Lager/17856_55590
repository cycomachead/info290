3.39,10.4,3.25,3.5,3.5,3,3.25,"Was about to brew a lighter blonde ale in this srm 3 range, so I picked up a bunch of different varieties for inspiration. This was my favorite, surprisingly. It was one of the lighter offerings, but it had that something different that kept me going back to it. It pours light gold with a .5"" head that dissipates rather quickly but has nice lacing and a brisk, spritzy inner-carb... tastes like a decent macro lager with a nice funky yeast-kick. It's a weird almost cloying sour/sweet funk to it that makes it original and interesting. Let's face it - this style is hard to make interesting, but that yeast funkiness going on doesn't taste like a paulaner, but it does kinda remind of that original-funk quality that's nice and it does set this apart in a usually boring/bland category. It might be slightly under-rated here. Slightly. A good summer beer. Beef it up with a bit of grain of paradise bite and you'd have yourself a winner. And get rid of the twist offs - pls. don't like buying bottles I can't recycle for homebrews.","witster18","May 26, 2014"

Aroma is of light malt,rice, and perhaps some faint bittering hops. Flavor is light malt,rice, and some faint Saaz hops. This beer is daily light in body and fairly crisp.","Franziskaner","Apr 21, 2014"

Fits the style of a Light Lager. Mouth feel is smooth and crisp, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of rice, pale malt, hint of hop, and a hint of sweet malt. Overall, decent appearance, aroma, and blend for a Light Lager, but the bottle clearly states Blonde Ale, and is therefore a poor American Blonde Ale.","Tone","Jul 25, 2013"

3.18,3.6,4,3.5,3,3,3,"Not as horrible as the label looks or the beer sounds. Pours a clear brilliant golden color with a bright white head, forms thin speckled lacing as it dwindles. Aroma has light biscuit malts with a light herbal hop in the back end, nothing overtly sweet or offensive here. Flavor has a creamy malts sweetness, with massive cereal notes and a bit of cooked veggie. Light herbal hops in the back end with some dry yeast cake chalkiness. Mouthfeel is light bodied with ample carbonation, a bit fizzy and a bit yellow nothing markedly better than anything mainstream or worse than anything out there that is super craft. Overall, it was bearable but nothing really exciting or well executed as a honey blonde lager.","WVbeergeek","May 17, 2012"
