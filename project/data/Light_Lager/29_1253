4.29,99.5,4,4.25,4.25,4.25,4.5,"Michelob Light brewed by Anheuser-Busch, with an ABV of 4.3% This brew pours out a nice amber color with a small white head. The smell is rich with grains and malts. There is a hit of hops in the smell of this brew.  The taste is light, but is bold with flavor.  Michelob Light has a nice balance to it, there is nothing overpowering in it.  The mouthfeel is light, rich and smooth. I really like the taste of this light brew,  Michelob Light has flavor for being a light beer.   There is nothing bad about this brew. Overall I'm giving Michelob Light a 4.5 out of 5. Michelob Light is not a bad light beer, I would buy this brew again.","nicholas2121","Mar 05, 2015"

3.69,71.6,,,,,,"Overall (3.69) : As I sit here with a Golden Light and a regular Light next to each other (I stopped my review and pulled a MGL from the fridge), the Michelob Light tastes much better and has better flavor. Where the Golden Light has grassy straw and corn, Michelob Light has rice, barley, and faint hop. It's not as easy drinking or unoffensive as Michelob Golden Light, nor is it near as cheap, but I have to say the regular Light is the superior beer.","The-Adjunct-Hippie","Dec 05, 2014"

3.54,64.7,3.5,3.25,3.75,3.5,3.5,"Pours a lighter golden color with a very thin white head that settles just to around the sides of the glass. Very little spotty lacing is seen but not much really. The aroma isn't much, just of some grassy grain for the most part with a hint of sweet corn. The taste is about the same with a slight sweet finish. Much more flavor and tastes better than their more popular ""Michelob Ultra"" which I didn't care much for. Medium carbonation. Overall, not bad and close to the flavor from 20 years ago that I remember.","BeerWithMike","Jul 09, 2014"

Mouthfeel was medium with a lemony taste on the tongue along with an attendant bite or snap. Dang, this is pretty good! Finish had more of a biscuit taste, but the lemon was still there. It reminded me of Archway Lemon Snap cookies. Completely unexpected! The only knock on this was its watery mouthfeel.

Tasted better than Bud Light I can tell you that, and without the nasty headache. Didn't care much for the flavor overall though. It did surprise me with just a little hoppy bite at the end. Maybe a hint of what it could be were it not produced for the masses. Clean mouthfeel. Just enough carbonation to give it a bite, kinda crisp.

Mouthfeel compares to that of other watery drinks. Drinkability is the high point of this alchoholic substance. Due to it's lack of substantial consistency or flavor, it could honestly be consumed in mass quantities. Just like water.
