"I just threw up in my mouth thinking of this beer... I wouldn't drink this beer with your mouth"

"One of these lightest & worst beers I have ever tasted."
""
"Probably the worst beer I've ever had. Give me alcoholic bitter water over this."
"Pours a surprising dark copper color, but no head whatsoever. Smells like pretty much all other adjunct lagers. Goes down real smooth, only because there is no flavor or hops, a tad dry though. If you want to drink a lot of beer with no taste this is the beer for you."
"Looks great, but not a lot of taste but very drinkable and pretty much everyone will drink it."

"It pretty much tastes like water but I suppose that is what you get with a 55 calorie beer.  It is a good bargain for people that like the taste of beer."

"Overall (1.87) -  Bud 55 is truly a light beer cut in half. 2.4% ABV, 55 calories. As a beer it is not a shining example. For a quick refresher or something light with lunch, it goes well. It's guaranteed to not offend, and it drinks easy. It has its place, although it's not as good as Miller 64."

"This beer pours the color of watered down urine. Side poured from a bottle into a pint glass. Has a nasty, soapy head that goes from huge to nonexistent very quickly. Smells like metal shavings. Tastes like it looks, I wish it tasted like it smelled. Mouthfeel is highly carbonated, almost nonexistent. Overall, a terrible attempt at making beer drinking a healthy past time. Just like turkey bacon sucks, so does this beer."
""
"Will never ever ever seek out. Was only tasted because it was a freebie."
""
""
"This tastes like some sort of slightly alcoholic, grainy water. It is the most tasteless beer I have ever encountered. If you want to avoid carbs and calories, and also like lower alcohol levels, and also do not care AT ALL about taste, than this is your beer. If you care about taste, this is simply not on the table."

"This doesn't offend me with bad flavors but it offends me because there is nothing here in flavor or body. I suppose that might be a result of stripping almost all calories out of the brew but it is not good in any way. Just a strangely unique yet terrible mouthfeel as well, it feels as if the beer was never on the palate after a sip."

"Nope. Was given to me for free and I drank it after work. Would have gotten the same experience out of tap water. No color, rice smell, and very little to come by in the way of taste. It didn't make me wretch like some people on this site would say, but I would never buy this beer, nor would I recommend."

"I doubt it would ever be in my fridge."

"O-What i expected is what I got. This beer is great for many that want to have a beer and be able to drink beer all night. It would be great at a party, and to drink on a summer day while I was grilling."

"O: This is a perfectly marketed beer. It is low in calories and alcohol content. It won't offend anyone's taste buds because there isn't any taste to be offended by. It is a beer to enjoy on a hot summer day by those who are watching calories. My suggestion... drink water instead."
""
""
"O: Slightly skunky but not that shocking since it is packaged in a clear glass bottle. The beer was not offensive but that is because there was not much too it to offend - very little flavor or smell to this beer. I probably would not grab another of these but I can see why some people could go for this when they are looking for low alcohol and low calorie options."
""
""
""
"This beer is for those who want to watch their calorie intake. While it is watered down, it is refreshing in the summer heat or after a work out. Beer-wise though there is not much I can praise it for. This beer is easy to drink (like water). Definitely not worth the money purchasing this."
"Pairs nicely with veggie dogs."
"This beer is one of the worst beers on planet earth and I am embarrassed for the makers. It is like drinking heartburn and having no ware to go to throw up. An abundant disaster by the makers of Budweiser. Would rather drink Wisconsin Club than this tragedy on a bad day."

"This beer made Jon Spencer Blues Explosion ""Flava"" pop in my head ""Who gots tha flava?"" Not bud 55."
"There is no need to seek the aroma, or any such nonsense. Obviously that is not the point; if you are buying this you know what you are getting, and this is a great ultra light beer."

"Overall- While expecting the worst, it really was not much different than the standard light beer (maybe just a little less flavor). If you are really concerned about calories (well you probably aren’t if you reviewing big beers on BA), then this may be a good option, but if like me you want something with a bit more robust flavor, then leave it on its own."

"Pale yellow with no head. No discernible smell. Tastes grainy and slightly chalky. No bitterness, but a slight sourness (not in a good way). It almost tastes rancid. There is a bit of body, surprisingly. Not much, and not enough to be good, but it isn't the worst I've had. Overall, if I want beer, I'll pass on this. If I want low cal, I'll get a Michelob Ultra, and if I want a cheap Big Brew beer to get drunk on, I'll find some Coors Light. This beer has no place in my rotation."
""
""
"Overall: If you don't think of this as beer, it's a refreshing, mildly alcoholic, low calorie refreshment. If you do think of it as beer, it's a bland, tasteless excuse for a beer. I guess it depends on what you're looking for."

"Pale fizzy yellow. Almost non existant scent and taste save for some faint kiss of cooked corn. Bubbly and uber light. Lifeless and uninspired, the weakest alcoholic beverage I have ever sampled. But when faced with this or other BMC Light products, maybe its almost better to not have anything to smell or taste or digest."
""
"Overall: This is a poor excuse for a light beer. A lot of light beers are at least somewhat refreshing but this doesn't do that. I won't be having this again."

"O: Not very flavorful, goes down quite easily and is not filling at all since there isn’t very much to this beer, extremely mild kick, it’s a watered-down version of a beer that didn’t have much to it to begin with."

"Well, this is a very light beer so mission accomplished but this lacks any kind of flavor and the apple-like off notes dominate both the smell and the flavor. Pass."

"Been watching my caloric intake so I saw this the other day and figured let's try it just to see how bad it is and also to see it filled a void that I had for my beer cravings. This is literally watered down Bud Select. Pours a fizzy yellow golden color with a highly carbonated quickly fleeting head, leaves sparse speckled lacing on the sides of my glass. Aroma has cooked vegetable, corn, generic beer nose, no actual hop component with a bit of metallic character going on. The first sip has a watery non discrete grainy quality with some more of the cooked corn rough husk quality, no herbal no hops just generic mass produced beer flavor. Ferments out to only 2.4% alcohol this is a glorified non alcoholic beer. Labeled as premium light beer, I'm just surprised that it's only 55 calories the only other drink other than water that I've had on a regular basis has been Gatorade G2 at 45 calories. Mouthfeel is light bodied with high carbonation pretty rough just because of the graininess light flavors and high carbonation."
""
""
""
""
"2.4% alcohol, so go knock yourself out with a six-pack, but if if you really want to try a decent light beer go get a Sam Adams Light. This Bud Select 55 does nothing for me."

"I gave this beer high rating because it does what it's supposed to do. It's not supposed to be a strong smelling, dark, tasteful beer. And that's what i want sometimes. When it's hot out and I want a cold beer to go down fast, this is the one. It's light and yes the taste is very weak. But it's kind of like wanting a cold glass of ice water on a hot day, but it's still a beer. It can't be denied, there is a reason Budweiser is the top selling beer, a lot of people do like it."

"If the beer world is slowly seeing the emergence of craft beer into a dominant force, maybe AB thinks there's a shift in the opposite direction as well, ultra light beers. I've had much worse products than this one, but artistically this beer is like Thomas Kincaid. This may be good business for AB and macro brewers, but it is not driven from a deep and abiding love for beer."

"poured from can into a pint glass. body is a clear pale straw color with half a finger of white bubbly head that disappears rather quickly. smell and taste were almost none. was able to pick up on faint grains and a metallic tonic water flavor. beer goes down pretty clean with no hops flavor and too much carbonation. like drinking a glass of tonic, maybe i should of addded vodka and a lime."
"Slightly astringent grainy malt and mineral water bitterness up front. Watered down faint cereal malt flavors mid-palate. Not even a hint of sweetness. Mineral water bitterness into the finish. Light bodied with a very lively, soda-like feel. Watery and almost tasteless. I'd rather have 4 oz. of a good beer if I were watching my beer calories..."
"Light straw, lots of bubbles and small head that fades to nothing. No smell, maybe straw. Taste is of carbonated water, some straw, corn. Mouthfeel is very light, highly carbonated. There is just no flavor here, but I guess that it can't be avoided with 55 calories."
"This to me is one of the worst beers of all time. I grabbed this because it was on sale for 3 dollars (that should have screamed to me that it was terrible) and I poured it into a regular pint glass. The beer poured a boring piss yellow and the smell was just a tiny bit of something and water. The taste was not there, you get a little malt, but other than that not much at all. The mouthfeel is like highly carbonated water. I couldnt stand it so it went down the drain, as well as the other 5. Dont buy this beer, it is terrible."
"I think Coors Light might still be a more watery beer, but while Coors just lacks flavor for the most part, Bud Select 55 is almost a chore to drink. It felt like it took me a half hour to finish the bottle. I think the unpleasant mouthfeel really hindered this beer. This is definitely not recommended, even to people who like light beers."
"Pours clear pale gold with about one inch of bone white head, no lacing. Aroma is a hint of grain. Taste is clean crisp malt water. A tiny amount of bitterness is found from time to time. Mouthfeel was like a lower cabonated sparkling water. Some dryness in the finish. If they had a seperate style class for ultralight beer this would fare a bit better."
"O - The ads say it's the ""lightest beer in the world"". They aren't lying. I strongly suggest sacrificing an additional 40-60 calories and go with a BMC light lager instead."
"O: it's a good idea for people who like la croix but want a beer like flavor. Good for if u want a beer with dinner while on a diet. But that's it."
"RJT"
"Ok, let me first say when you see this beer it is obvious what you are going to get. Half the calories, half the alcohol, half the taste. This beer is perfect for those times when you are entertaining friends and want to be sociable without getting drunk. It is far better than most NA brews and better than MGD 64. I am actually impressed a bit by this beer. I drink it on a hot summer day when I don't want too get drunk."
"My pour yielded a one finger head of the whitest foam I have seen in a long time, and I am glad I took a good look because it was gone very quickly, leaving very little lace very little cling. Color is a 2 on the SRM beer color chart. Smell is a light aroma of cooked corn and wheat. Taste is much like the smell, but less of it. Sweet corn and wheat, maybe a slight touch of grapefruit, can I say bland. Mouthfeel equals fizzy water. I guess if you want to drink a lot and pee a lot in a night of fun with friends and still be sober to drive, this would be the beer for you."
"Picked a bottle of this at Liquor Barn, it's one of those brews that I know I'll never buy a 6 pack of, but want to try for some stupid reason. 12 ounce bottle. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours a clear light gold color with about a 1/4 inch white head that went away very quickly. There isn't any lacing left on the glass. Aroma is a bit of sweet malt, and not much else. It doesn't smell bad, but it doesn't exactly smell appealing either. The taste is pretty much just like the aroma. It tastes like a bit of sweet malt, but there aren't any offensive flavors. Mouthfeel/body is light and watery, but that's to be expected for this style of beer. It's really not hard to drink at all. I was expecting the worst when I tried this brew, but I was pleasantly surprised. I hate to admit this, but if someone gave me a bottle of this, I'd drink it (not that I'll ever buy this again). I've certainly drank worse beers. I'm not saying this is good, but for a 55 calorie light lager, it's a lot better than I thought it was going to be."
"the best thing i can say about it is it looks like beer in the bottle. pours light gold color white head that quickly went flat and no lace. very weak cooked corn smell. its hard to describe the taste because there was none. watery weak mouthfeel and not enough alcohol to make to worth the price. don't waste your money if your looking for beer. its not."
"O - if you think this is going to make you lose weight you probably love it but I'm not on a diet."
"Poured from a 12 oz. can. Has a aple golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is mild, some notes of beer. Taste is also mild, a touch of malt, not much going on. Feels light in the mouth and overall, while not the worst light beer I have tried, there is nothing to seperate it from this unremarkable herd."
"Had to try it just to see what the hype was all about. I'm still impressed that this hasn't been retired by the brewery. It's one thing to have a light beer, and it's another thing to have a Light Light Beer. Honestly, I'm struggling to see the purpose to this. If Americans are getting too fat to enjoy a good beer from time to time then they shouldn't be having beer at all. This beer is a waster of money, time, ingredients, and everything else that is put into making this. I'd rather see this removed from the shelves and Crystal Pepsi put in it's place."
"D- Easy to drink, in that it's almost water. Not easy to drink in that it doesn't taste that great."
"Overally, is this a beer or some kind of water? I guess it was easy to drink, but that was because it was basically water. Would I drink it again? No."
"Select 55 was pale yellow in color with good clarity. It had a fizzy white head that disappeared instantly. The smell was very light and clean with a bit of cereal grain. The taste was water with a touch of grain thrown in. The mouthfeel was as close to water as you can get with light carbonation. Drinkability was poor. This is the wateriest beer that I have ever tried."
"Here is why I said the above. This beer has an awful taste that only get worse when it gets warmer. There is no flavor to discuss. I understand this is seems like I am ""slamming"" this beer. I really am not! There isn't anything to write about with this beer. The mouth feel is almost chalky leaving your mouth dry. The flavor is a a generic American style bud, but with less taste. I would recommend you try another beer if you are looking for a lot cal beer."
"D- This is a very easy beer to slam back! It's light flavor and heavy carbonation would be killer as a patio beer, but I think it would be more effort than it's worth, having to use the toilet often and not getting the desired buzz effect. I'll stick to a standard macro before this but if I'm having a heavy meal, this might be a compromise. A notch below Bud Select but a notch above MGD 64!"
"D - Not good. How do you make a terrible beer even worse? You make Budweiser Select 55."
"Pours a clean pale yellow color, some carbonation, with a fizzy little white head, some sticky lacing left behind. The nose is grainy/ricy, slight spice. The taste is watery at best, not much going on here. Light Body. Not Drinkable, a waste of money on this one."
"i saw this one in the in laws fridge and had forgotten to bring anything with me that day so i just went with it. poured it into a pint glass and a light golden amber comes through right away. again nothing really crazy here an exactly what i had expected. short lived head and lively carbonation were common place. aroma is light grain, muted and touched by very light hop notes that seem to provide something, but again so light it is really hard to detect. crisp, clean, super light and had virtually no aftertaste. not a terrible beer just a non existent one. too light and overly carbonated but i have had much worse."
"D- Harsh and fizzy, watery, boring, and unpleasant."
"D: I would highly recommend against it. It's all around bad."
"D - I guess you could session this is you wanted. I would take almost any other light beer over it, though."
"Drink is a zero but that's not an option so I'll up it to a full 1.0."
"Another one I drank as part of losing a bet. Clear bottle poured into straight pint glass. I honestly try to find something positive about every beer I try, but even I couldn't find one nice thing to say about this puppy. Clear, urine color. No grain or hop scents. Almost zero flavor. The same amount of body as a glass of water. Water has a higher level of drinkability because it's not pretending it's not water. Only drink if you lose a bet."
"First - the obligatory BA disclaimer - this was left in the fridge and was simply taking up space more worthily occupied by some (any) other brew. I decided I might as well give it a chance. Poured a very light gold. Some vague sweetness in the aroma. Flavor - well, there's the rub - there is none, or, at least almost none. I think I could pretty well replicate this beer by taking a Bud Light, and mixing it with three parts club soda. I am at a loss to understand why anyone, even a light beer fan, would bother to drink this. It is wet. That is about it."
"A relative was ""nice"" enough to leave a bottle of this in the fridge for me. Why not? Many reasons, I find out. First, it pours without almost no color and can't hold a head or produce lacing with the hardest of pours. Smells like a tiny bit of grain and tastes the same. No off flavors, but that's not enough to keep it from getting the ""awful"" mark. Feel is quite light and overly carbonated. Drinks quickly, but there's absolutely no reason to take a second sip."
"Only drinkable for wimps and people who want to join in beer drinking with people who drink actual beer."
"Drinkability - As far as light lagers go, this is a very drinkable beer. It definitely is lacking in complexity, but helps you maintain a buzz after sampling other more ""diverse"" beers."
"The taste of Select 55 is decent (i.e. non-offensive) and they go down nice and easy. It's light and pleasantly carbonated with just enough alcohol to take the edge off after a 10 hour work day. 55 is also perfect for camping or the beach when you literally could down a case of these throughout the day and not get hammered or sick. No it's not an objectively great beer, but it's perfect for what it is and therefore one of my ""favorite"" daily drinkers."
"Overall: Not a world-class beer by any means. Yet I find some surprisingly pleasant qualities with this. It smells ok, tastes ok, and is very easy to drink, which I think is the point of this beer. On these grounds, I give Budweiser Select 55 a thumbs up as a decent, albeit not great, beer."
"On to the chug to end this nightmare..."
"drinkability: Sure for the few calories, why not or not."
"An Ultimate Lawnmover Beer .. to have a couple or few before and after mowing the lawn !"
"Got this one for free out of a buddy's fridge. Had just gotten back from the Foothills Baltic Porter release and needed to sober up some, this was my first choice. Served from bottle into a Corona Extra shaker. Poured golden yellow with a one finger white head that died a very swift death. There was no lacing evident throughout. The aroma was comprised of malt, wheat, and URINE!? The flavor was of water, grain, and malt; mostly water however. It was light on the palate with low carbonation. Overall my question is, where did the flavor go??? However, I am glad that the urine I picked up on in the aroma stayed in the aroma and didn't hit my palate. This one was nice for sobering up, but that's about it..."
"A friend left one lonely can in my fridge after a get together this past weekend. I figured I'd pop it open last night and finish it off. Poured into a pils glass. Very light yellow body, with moderate carbonation. Small fizzy head. Smell was nonexistent. Taste also was pretty much absent. Barely more flavor than water. Mouthfeel had some bubbles to it, and it was an easy beer to drink, which is what AB is looking for. But at 2.4% abv, what's the point? Since it's basically a non-alcoholic beer, you'd be better off drinking a lemonade. At least that has some flavor and ""low calories""."
"From the 12 fl. oz. can marked 07MAY10-WF09. Sampled on August 8, 2010. The pour is mainly yellow with a slight golden hue and a short-lived fizzy white head. The aroma is full of rice adjuncts but also there is a thin hoppy coating as well as a very fine pine-like scent. The body is not as watered down as many light beers I have had but I would not call it medium by any stretch of the imagination. There is a weak maltiness in the mix and a clean hopped shadow but nothing pounces out. Looking at this beer in an objective fashion it is very typical of light macros but not offensive."
"Overall/notes - I'm moving and under a lot of stress, so my cousin gave me two of these as a sort of pick-me-up. In all honesty, I'm not going to make some sarcastic remark about it. After all, this is a beer with 55 calories. How does one review that? It accomplishes what it sets out to do: have the lightest beer possible. That, however, doesn't absolve it of all of the numerous faults it has. Just not a good beer and not even worth the can it comes in."
"Serving type: Draft - 16oz for $ 7.50 -- baseball price"
"It's easy drinking, extremely light and lacks any real flavor. Great if you are looking to drink something that resembles beer, but this is not what is beer is about. This is 12 ounces of liquid to rehyrate with in between tasty beers."
"I'm actually quite surprised - the only way that this is truly offensive is in its concept - as for its execution, it is just a very, very mild lager - no skunk factor whatsoever. Just like your go-to grocery store bottled water. However, that defence falls short - this is supposed to be BEER!"
"Crystal clear and a darker yellow (almost gold) than I expected. A fizzy white cap disappeared shortly after the pour, leaving nothing on the sides of the glass. Light grainy aroma, faint apple, slightly vegetal - not much to talk about really. Low bitterness, minerals, cereal grains, metallic and watery finish. Thin bodied, sharp carbonation, super dry. Sort of tastes like carbonated water with a little bit of flavour added. Not much point here, as I expected - time to move along."
"D - You would probably have to drink 3 or 4 fairly quickly to feel the effects. Not worth it to me, but maybe for some."
"If you like paying excessively high prices for bottled water, this beer is for you."
"The only thing I can say about this beer that is good is that its good for barbeques and partys where you don't want to get drunk but you do want something to drink."
"Appearance seems no different than any other macro with light golden body and a thin crisp dissapating head. Smell is clean that has a light aroma of grainy adjuncts. Taste of light grain that is definably watered down that ends dry. Mouthfeel is light with good carbonation. I'd have to say that amongst the ultra's that I've tried so far, this aint to bad."
"I'd prefer this over BL, BL Lime, and Sunset Wheat."
"This is not good, even for a macro light lager. Why bother... might as well drink tonic water...in fact, I probably would prefer to, would be less cardboardy."
"it has good drinkable but taste is so light that if your looking for some sort of beer flavor but if you want a light beer this is not for you get a real light beer this is not a good beer and should be avoided"
"One thing Select 55 is, is thirst-quenching. Due to the lack of any flavor or body, I suppose one could hang out after a long jog or ride while wearing spandex with their ""buddies"" and quench their thirst with these. Other than that, there is really no place for this beer in a mans fridge."
"Budweiser Select 55 is a Light Beer brewed by Anheuser-Busch. This brew has an ABV of 2.40% Select 55  is the Lighter of Budweiser select. This brew pours out a nice light amber color with a smell white head. The smell is light with a hit of grains and malts.  This is just a water down beer. No taste at all. You pick up hits of beer taste. The drinkability is ok, it is smooth and clean. This beer is like drinking Busch NA. Over all I would not buy this unless you like Light Light Beers. Not the greatest Anheuser-Busch brew I had.  Overall I'm giving this brew a 2 out 5"
"Do yourself a favor, and at the bar or package store, select a different brew."
"12oz clear bottle purchased (cheaply) at the local Hannaford's. Pours a crystal clear very light straw yellow with an initial white head that dissipates almost immediately. Smells mostly like cooked corn with hints of malt in the background. Tastes very light. Cooked corn (DMS) and slight hints at bready malt character toward the finish is all I'm getting. Extremely light-bodied with moderate carbonation. Pretty drinkable, no surprise since this basically comes off as beer-flavored carbonated water. Dull and lifeless, albeit somewhat refreshing."
"Drinkability: Yeesh. The stuff they have the nerve to slap the word ""premium"" onto... Steer clear of this one, friends. Bud 55 is an awful beverage for those that feel Bud Light is simply too rich and filling."
"It is the most watered down beer i have ever tryed.i like the regular bud select.but a 55cal beer?they need a new catagory supper light beer.with miller having really light beer it was only a matter of time before bud and coors will come out with one to.who counts calories so much they will drink this stuff.thank the beer gods for sam adams light"
"D- Yeah though a bong this would go down smooth."
"Poured a clear nearly colorless into a pint glass. A thin white head that disappeared instantly, more like a soda water head than a beer head. Smelled like a soda water also, hell tasted like soda water too! No flavor, no texture, no reason to drink it!"
"This beer pours a clear golden color. The head is one inch in height, and recedes within ten seconds into absolutely no lacing. I don't think I have ever viewed a beer with this little lacing. I mean usually there is at least a tiny ring of bubbles around the edge of the glass, but not in this beer. It really doesn't look like a beer. The aroma seems to have gone where ever the head did. That is to say it smells like water....upon closer inspection there is a little something there making it smell more like tainted water. Truly awful. It would be better if it just didn't have a smell. The taste is like carbonated water. The mouthfeel is the thinnest I have every encountered in a beer which makes sense being that this beer is only 55 calories, and a mere 2.4% ABV. I can handle the thin body, but this beers under carbonation is a huge detractor. I never thought I'd say a beer brewed by Anheuser-Busch is under carbonated, but this beer truly is. There is some carbonation to it, but not enough for a light lager. Overall, this is a really bad beer. I will never drink this again."
"D: After a couple of drinks I'm bored. Really what's the point anymore. Drainpour. This beer is so light it makes Michelob Ultra look like Yeti."
"NOTES: If someone is so concerned about the calories in beer that they can't even drink a typical light beer, they probably shouldn't be drinking beer. Just drink water instead of this stuff."
"D - If drinkability is characteristic of a beer's ease of consumption, sho' nuff. If I was struck blind, and asked someone for a glass of water, they could fool me with this. Thought I might accuse them of having peed in my glass."
"With this, I wrap up my reviewing days."
"Pours a clear, pale gold color. 1/4 inch head of a white color. Poor retention and poor lacing. Smells of pale malt, slight yeast, metallic, very slight citrus, and grain. Fits the style of a Light Lager. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp with an average carbonation level. Tastes of metallic, yeast, pale malt, and grain. Overall, almost no body, definitely drinkable, but so is water?"
"(d)If I could get past the taste I could probably drink Bud's supply of this brew, and I'd be sober enough to remember just how horrible each one was. (2/5)"
"Avoid like the plague. This is just overkill and the very reason why AB/InBev is cannibalizing itself in the name of profits. They just don't understand that it's not calories but rather carbs. Waste of money."
"The two fingers' worth of rocky, bone-white head were reminiscent of the blowing, drifting snow out my back window. The head held up so poorly that I wished that the snow could take its cue from the beer. CAN nothing cheer me up today? The color was a pretty deep-gold with NE-quality clarity, like a ray of sunshine on this snow-white afternoon. That was nice. Nose had a faint lager-sweetness, but only faint. Mouthfeel was thin and watery with only a light sweet taste on the tongue. Finish was equally watery and did not leave me with much of any taste, pleasant or not. It was really a bland beer, overall, and while not worthy of outright avoidance, I would not seek it out unless you are on a CANQuest."
" Like I said, I could drink this by the keg. I'm going to be using Bud Select 55 instead of water on some of my longer endurance rides this spring."
"Drinkability: This goes down like water, as it should. The drinkability is extremely high even though its not tasty, it goes down easy and the low ABV helps."
"I had to laugh when I saw this in my favorite beer store as it was a new item. So, it beats Miller 64 by 9 calories? I thought I would give it a try. It looked to be okay, but it's aroma was mostly of corn and faint wheat. The taste was better than I expected, though it lacked any after effects, other than mild carbonation."
"I was hoping to find a clean beer that was void of both meaningful flavor and flaws. Looks like I was right about the meaningful flavor omition...."
"I don't know what to say aside from I'm glad it was free. To say it looks like a light lager would be inaccurate. It was lighter and more clear than any other beer I've seen. I can't say I smelled anything. Is that possible? As for the flavor, it honestly tastes like a 50-50 mix of Bud Light and water. Guess what? The mouthfeel was watery and thin. Drinkability is where this beer takes off. It's low calorie, has no awful bitterness that most adjunct lagers have, and it's low ABV makes it extremely sessionable. I imagine you'd have to drink a case to get a buzz which would counteract the low calorie effect. I guess you win some and you lose some."
"Had this at a New Years Eve get together. Pours a pale yellow color with a thin white head which faded immediately. Almost no aroma, some cooked rice is about it. Same for the flavor. Not much going on here either. Feels thin and watery, carbonation is ok. This was a boring beer to drink."
"Drinkability is, well, like seltzer. Sure I could chug this like water, but why would I want to? At only 2+ % ABV, it's not even worth the effort as an alcohol delivery device."
"Verdict: If you want a buzz without too many calories, Bud Light already exists. If you don't like the taste of beer, there are plenty of alternatives out there. If you want to cut the flavor, calorie count, and alcohol content off a Bud Light in half, potable tap water is available in almost all American households. So why the hell does this exist?"
"D- it would be impressive if you finish the first bottle."
""
"Budweiser Select 55 pours a pale yellow color from a twelve ounce can. The aroma is mildly grainy, I can't particularly detect any hops or malt. The taste is predictably mild, a touch grainy and that's about it. Watery is probably the best description for this one. Okay for what it is, just not what most of the people on this site are looking for."
"Pale yellow gold with a head that's gone in 30 seconds. Now it looks like apple juice. It smells like an empty glass of beer. What I mean is, it smells like a glass that contained a skunked Heineken, that beer was drank, then the glass was left on the counter overnight. That's what this beer smells like. The taste? Jesus. Water. This tastes like cornade (Lemonade but made with corn). Water mouthfeel. Flat. terrible. I hope these horrible beers go away. What's the point? If people don't like beer they should drink something else."
"overall, i will not be buying this one very bland"
"Bud Select 55 pours a light pale yellow. The skunky aroma covers up anything else that might be there. The flavor is sulfery and slightly grainy. More proof that a clear bottle is a bad idea. This beer is about as close to water as it gets. Not worth it, if you're dieting, go for mixed drinks or go without."
".... and in my humble opinion, trying to cut back on calories and/or losing weight is no excuse for making or drinking a beverage this flavorless."
"Had to buy this just to say I've had it. Poured from the bottle into a pilsner glass, beer is as it appears in the clear glass bottle; a very light golden yellow with lots of fizzy bubbles on the glass and comprising a large, foamy white head. The nose is virtually non-existent, what is there reminds me slightly of vomit. If AB was going for the absolute closest to water you can get and still call it a beer, they've hit the nail on the head. Goes down just like carbonated water with only a very slight whisper of Budweiser at the finish. Overall a very drinkable beer because again, how drinkable is water? Very! I'm sure this will get beat up bad just because it is an AB product, but honestly... could I get some beer with my beer???"
"Pale yellow. Fizzy carbonation. Almost no smell. No tase at all. None. Tastes wet with some bubbles. This beer is completely pointless. I'm not one of those snobs who thinks there is no place for a mass produced yellow beer. Sometimes you want a simple cheap lager that you can down all day. But even I can't defend this. If they got it down to 55 calories, what is it made of? It's not even that drinkable because it is so boring. It's like drinking a case of bottled water. You probably could, but why? If this is what you have to drink in order to drink beer, you don't like beer."
"At less than 4% you'd be bloated from drinking this before even feeling a slight buzz, but I suppose, as water, it's drinkable."
"D: great for drinking games since it's as easy to chug as water and won't get you drunk. other than that you have no reason to drink this."
"D: I could drink this all day long which should be reason for a score of 5. However, the fact that I would not be buzzed combined with the illusion that I'm drinking dirty water lowers the drinkabilty score to 1."
"Overall - Just an awful beer. I'd rather have a beer belly than resort to this crap ever again. Not to mention the ""Drunkability"" was an F-. I drank 4 of these in a 2 hour time period, no buzz, nada. All I felt was a full belly of club soda with maybe a shot of real beer. Please, unless you are a light weight don't even waste your time on this terrible excuse for a beer. YUCK!"
"Very thin and watery flavor. I won't have another one."
"Its as drinkable as a cold glass of tap water, so I guess ok, but why bother."
"Drinkability depends how you look at it. The sessionability is ridiculous so in that regard yes it's drinkable. On the other han I like to consider the flavor profile and whether it brings me back for another sip. In that regard, this is easily the most boring beer I've ever had. I've found more enjoyment and flavor in nonalcoholic beer. Just really a bad gimic beer and it's sad to think that this will pass as beer to the masses."
"D- To be honest this is a very drinkable beer because it doesn't taste like anything. And because of that it is the best out of all the BMC Flagship beers...haha."
"Clear urine yellow with a fizzy white head that burns off quickly. The nose on this beer is not offensive because there is none. Very light tasting, almost like a non-alcoholic beer with a sourness in the finish. Watery with seltzery carbonation. Another low alcohol diet beer with no flavor. Why bother?"
"So there it is. Not particularly good, but particularly easy to ignore. Bubbly as all hell. Simple to drink, but who drinks lame beer to not get a buzz at 2.4%? I don't get it much. One scenario could be if you have to show up at a party with bad beer you can drink a number of these and then drive home a-ok. Though normally, if you want something fizzy and low in calories reach for a Diet Pepsi Max or a Coke Zero, those are pretty good."
"Even though this is the lightest malted barley beverage on the face of the earth I couldn't drink more than one. In a lifetime. At least not without monetary compensation. I must still take my hat off to Bud. Their marketing department is awesome. If they can get people to buy this they should use thair powers for good and maybe bring peace to the Middle East or get Lindsey Lohan to eat a damn sandwich. It does, however, get the extra 1/2 point because you could probably replace water with this stuff and still maintain life. Hell, it's more sanitary than most people's tap water."
"I call this beer the pacifier beer. When you want a real beer, but you just can't have it - stick this in your mouth and you'll shut up for a while."
"i pray this beer never makes it out of the test markets - and i should be flogged for buying a sixer just to review it"
