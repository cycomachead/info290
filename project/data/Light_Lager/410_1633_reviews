"After drinking beer for over 40 years, this is my go to."
""
"This beer bring back memories. this was our go to at the ski lodge when my college buddies and i went snowboarding. 3 dollars for a pounder. Not a bad brew, refreshing, clean, and somewhat tasty."
""
"Overall- Well, this is off my list of beers to try.  At least I get the beer credit for drinking one.  I will not drink this again."
""
"Can you make a worse beer, I doubt it.  Take the worst of the macros, water it down and make it more unappealing, that's IC Light."

"I.C. Light brewed by Pittsburgh Brewing Co. This brew has an ABV of  4.15%  The brew pours out a nice amber color with a small white head. I.C. Light is a filtered brew you can see right though it. This brew looks like most American light brews. The smell has some grains and malts. You do pick up on some corn in this brew. There is nothing bad about this brew so far now for the taste.  The taste at first is bitter but it goes down smooth. But there is something in there at first.  This brew ok, it is not bad but it is not good.  I would put this light brew right in the middle. The mouthfeel is ok with a clean finish. But the first taste is bitter sweet. Overall I'm giving this brew a 3 out 5. Not the best, but not the worst I've had."

"DATE REVIEWED: August 2, 2014... GLASSWARE: ballpark see-through plastic... OCCASION: perfect night for a ballgame and some beers with brother Jer in State College...APPEARANCE: thick, white creamy head; yellow body with some cascading bubbles...meh... AROMA: vague hints of water hose, hay and malt liquor ping....with a hint of beer pong ball... PALATE: light bodied, with a retreating aftertaste--has peanut-rinsing potential... TASTE: middling malts mingle with water to produce...mostly water, with a warming fuzz not appropriate to its ABV...not much else can be deduced... OVERALL: I went cheaper at the Spikes game and got four more ounces for a dollar less than the Robin Hood IPA...and not surprisingly, I regretted the change.. this beer needs to be chased with an activity that involves strong-tasting fare; otherwise, I wouldn't drink this unless visiting Pittsburgh where the locals embrace its quirks and flaws...."

"O- this isn't terrible, I actually prefer it over BMC light beers. Actually has a bit of flavor, but not much"

"O: This is a really good light lager. It was 93 cents for a 12oz bottle. If I could find this in a case locally it would probably be my go to cheap beer."
""

""
""
" The flavor is not bad yet it does lack any real resemblance to beer since you basically get the fizziness yet a light sweetness is present on the palate with very light fruity tinge. The overall impression is nothing special to enjoy or appreciate even in the realm of light beers -it is basically a palate cleanser, would pair well with extremely spicy wings or greasy fair-food maybe."

"O: There is a minimal amount of flavor to this beer but it is not offensive - feels like it is a good beer for hydrating on a hot summer afternoon while working in the yard."

"""The beer you reach for when Iron City is just to heavy and calorie-laden..."" This stuff pours a clear straw topped by a finger of relatively short-lived lightly off-white foam. The nose comprises corn, funky wheat, and hard water. The taste brings in more of the same, with the hard water and funky wheat really combining for some ""fun"" on the tongue. The body is pretty light, with a light moderate carbonation and a watery feel. Overall, a meek, character-less beer, prolly exactly what they were aiming for. Some people..."
"Much better than bud or coors light. Like Miller but would buy instead since it is a smaller brewer. Alright light beer."

"Overall - More flavorful the average light beer with a better look as well. If you want a light beer this is one to have from time to time."

"Pale beer with a thin, soapy head that fades over 30 seconds or so. Faint, grassy aroma with a bit of fruitiness. Dry, grass flavor and not much else. Has a bit of a sugary aftertaste. IC Light isn't offensive to the palate, but it doesn't offer much either. Still, I think it tastes better than some of the more popular light lagers. I'd drink it again if it were offered to me, but it's not something I'd go out of my way to have."

"This is my first IC Light since leaving PA in '07. I can see why I drank so many of them back in the day. It's cheap, sessionable, and unoffensive."
"Not bad for a light beer. Good Summer beer for backyard activities."
"O: I purchased a 6 pack for $4.50. Not a bad deal. A good light lager especilly for that price. I would definitely take this over any BMC macro produced light lagers."
"It's Sunday evening and I need a bottle of healing after my hockey game. Had an Iron City Lite in the fridge....so why not. This beer is a typical light beer, decent flavor. The color is golden clear with thin white head and has a modest lace. There is only a weak grain nose. The taste is typical of this beer style. Mouthfeel is decent....perfect for any lawn mowing issues. Session...easily....but would prefer others...no question."
"Poured this onto a glass and was assuming it'd look like a light lager. It has very little to offer the consumer. This beer goes down fairly quickly at least. As it warms it kind of starts to have an odd aroma. Drink these fast if you have too. This reminded me a lot of Miller Lite."
"Nothing special here, pretty plain and nothing beyond ordinary."
"D-this is one of the better light beers i've had but its still not a great, or good, or decent beer. i'd rather see this in kegs at parties than BMC products tho."
"This was probably one of the better macros out there, not something I would buy though."
"Pretty easy to drink, but I always counter that factor--which is evidently so important to the average beer drinker--with what is, in my opinion, more important: whether or not I actually want to drink it."
"Notes: All in all, if you are looking for a low cal beer that is very drinkable give this a try. It is every bit as good as its BMC counter parts and it is independent."
"Eh, it's a light beer. What else can I say? I'm not a fan of light beers but I'm always searching (albeit fruitlessly) for a light beer other than Sam Light that I can tolerate. There just ain't no thing but if you're getting sick of BMC light beers, try this."
"I didn't like this beer at all, and while it may be drinkable, I don't jnow why anyone would want to."
"D- Easy to drink, good for parties"
"An aggressive pour produced a finger of bone-white head with low retention. Nose was very light and slightly sweet. The color was a pale straw-yellow with NE-quality clarity. The mouthfeel was somewhat thin with a mild sweetness on the tongue. Finish was equally thin with that same sweetness that just seemed to linger. Overall, it was a pretty boring beer. Oh well. Stick to Arn!"
"Overall another crappy light american lager. Yawn. I'm glad my buddy thought of me and brought this home. I'm just sad he didn't grab mesomething good."
"It poured a light yellow with no lace and first impression was water but the bubbles make it ginger ale. Not much scent, a little musty macro cheap beer scent. Smells like any other. Mouth was thin, with a corn grain aftertaste but nothing like a cheap macro. Actually just a slight hop bite too. Taste? Well, thin and any light, but the difference is, this one is pretty clean. Corn husk is light enough, minor alcohol in the middle, and slightly bitter hops. Hmmm. Yes, this is better than before, as it no longer has the slight skunk of old. I'd say this is much better than almost all the macro lights I've had. Just enough to be more than water, a lot less skunk than other light beers, I'd say, when I want a light, I'd get this."
"Overall a decent light adjunct lager. Good local alternative."
"drinkability is decent. for a light lager, this is mediocre at best, but still refreshing on a hot day."
"Overall, I may be bias being from Pittsburgh, but I think this beer is better than the BMCs. Not a good beer, but a beer that I can live with for tailgating and the like."
"The drink is light-bodied and an easy drinker when served at near-freezing and virtually-flavorless, but at ""cellar"" temperature or any warmer, IC Light is pretty much pisswater awful."
"D: I have not had a lot of Lite beers.... That being said this one had more than I was expecting from a Lite Beer.... Tasty, nicely balanced, goes down easily, and not very filling at all.... Check this one out."
"Nice bottle, good revamped label design. I had a feeling this one was going to pour a clear yellow and alas, it did, with a small white head. Decent nose i must say, a bit fruity, light but nothing foul at all, damn fresh and pretty inviting. Clean flavor of an American macro, decent balance is achieved. Light in body, very very drinkable. Not bad!"
"Drinkability is off the charts. Great for pre-gaming, or for that matter, during the game. Whatever sport you enjoy."
"Drinkability: If I drink light beer at a barbeque or someone's having a party with such a brew, it's not too bad. I'd never really buy it myself, but there are worse light beers out there. Very easy to drink and wash food down, and it's nice they actually have the calories and nutritional information on the can too, since many light beers don't."
"I don't think this can gave I.C. Light its best showing. I've had it on tap around Pittsburg tasting much better than this dated can did tonight."
" Drinkability: very easy to drink drank about 10 watching the super bowl , but i dont think i would go out and buy another case any time soon"
"Decent for a light beer, but nothing more."
"I'll be honest there is not much to write about when it comes to this beer. It was amazingly plain. It had a rough white head over very pale transparent body. The aroma was very weak but smelled of malt and was little bit crisp. I noticed the mouthfeel before I notice the flavor it was very watery and thin with some carbonation to it and that was about it. The flavor was beany and grassy but not bitter at all. Overall it was beer flavored water. I will say it was refreshing at the time because I was parched."
"This is a below average beer that is consistent for style."
"The beer was very light colored almost clear. The head did not last very long at all. I was pretty sure this beer would suck anyway since I'm not much on light beer. I will have to say though it was pretty darn good. A great summertime refresher brew. The taste was clean and fresh. I would certainly buy this beer again."
"I expected to be disgusted by some DMS (cooked vegetable aroma and flavor)-riden mess, but this was a decent macro light beer, all things considered. Yeah, it was pretty watery, but the mouthfeel wasn't unpleasantly dry, bitter, or astringent light most other light beers. Instead this matched a slight lemon flavor with mild bready malts. Not a lot going on, but it's a light beer, what more do you?"
"Pours a near flat, very light straw color. It has almost no scent at all, beyond a very mild sweet, sugary aroma. Almost no taste, it was nearly like drinking water. It was very smooth, though, I have to give it that. While not a great beer, this would be great after working outside during the summer."
"Drinkability: A fairly empty beer experience, though, surprisingly, it was a bit more tolerable than the standard Iron City."
"D: A little tasty, goes down easily, not filling at all, mild kick, it's very similar to your typical ""fizzy yellow beer"" but this one at least has a little bit more flavor."
"D: I recommend for Steeler tailgate parties in the dead of winter or in the Summer for the Pirates"
"I am not too much into light beers but I thoguht I would try it for the sake of doing. Just like any other bland light beer. Pours a sloppy yellow with minimal head. Taste like regular Iron City with water added and flavor subtracted. Drink at a BBQ on a hot summer day."
"D: An all day session beer for Penguins, Pirates, or Steelers games. It is what it is, and I love it for that."
"Light mouthfeel,not watery like a lot of light macros, has a grainyness tastes like beer even has a bite to it. My choice for sessioning a light macro, blows away BMC lite beers. Rated this beer compaired to other light beers out there. Can't belive more people don't drink this one."
"Somewhat refreshing, got a single bottle for 50 cents so my money wasnt completely wasted."
"Ok I must admit I am pushing a local beer....But listen up y'all this beer is noted for starting the whole light beer trend. It was out WAY before low carb diets were the rage. It has a ""full flavor"" taste but yet is low in calories and carbs and contains just about the normal ABV as a regular beer. It is very smooth going down finishes clean and tastes great with wings, on a hot summer day or when I am parked in front of the TV watching my fave team play some football(and I'm sure you can guess who it is if you looked to see where the beer is made) AND THANK YOU for keeping it local!!! Try it peoples!!!!"
"I.C. Light pours a light golden yellow with a white head from a brown twelve ounce bottle. Aroma is mostly adjunct. Light body, highly carbonated, minimal taste. The taste is heavy on adjunct. Typical for the style I guess. No real off tastes, not bad compared to the competitors."
"This isn't that great but its very drinkable and its tradition. I was very upset when the Miller Lite guy came to my section but the Iron City guy didn't. I had to get up to go buy this one. Oddly enough-a bottle of DFH 60 min. IPA is $5.75 and a bottle of BMC or Iron City is $6...so if you are ever at a Pirates game hit up the Beers of the Burgh stand."
"0.7 grams Protein"
"I.C. Light is the clear winner of Macro Smackdown XII. Simply put, it's a drinkable light lager that I was able to get some enjoyment out of; in contradistinction to Lone Star Light, which isn't and which I wasn't. Pittsburgh's favorite light lager is one of the best beers of that style that I've had in quite some time."
"This was from a 12 ounce aluminum bottle. IC Light pours a clear light gold with a small white head which goes away quick. It smells like grain, corn and some sweet malt. The taste is mostly malty and grainy, with a small metallic taste too. It starts off a bit sweet and finishes a bit sour. The mouthfeel is light and watery. With that being said the drinkability is decent as the beer is non-offensive and it does go down smooth. Yeah, there are plenty of better choices out there but it's not bad on a hot summer day watching a ball game at PNC Park."
"D- Meh."
"Pours a light golden color with a small head...little aroma, maybe a slight floral scent. Very mild, watered-down taste...but goes down pretty well. No pungent aftertaste or anything...it's enjoyable for what it is. This is my pick for cheapest case if I need something in a pinch to please people. It makes a good football-party beer if you're watching the game with a large group of beer guzzlers (especially Steelers fans)."
"Maybe it was the ""first-beer-of-the-day"" syndrome (the first beer you have that day never tastes bad) but I really didnt think this was a bad brew at all. What I really liked was that IC light didnt seem to have that typical overcarbonated, burning-mouth sensation that a lot of other Lights have. It also has that interesting grass/hay/etc taste that all light beers have, like you are chewing on a mouthful of something that has been freshly cut from the ground. Goes down smooth and easy. Not bad at all."
"IC-Light is the baby-food version of Iron City. It tastes like rusty rinse. If you're not a true beer drinker and just like some cold watery beverage without a sweet taste, then this is your ""beer."" Actually, it has less nasties to it than the original standard Iron City, and in that regard it is better than at least one beer in the world."
"Don't ever try it. If you want to try a Pittsburgh macro, I recommend standard Iron City over this."
"This is your classic cheap beer, made for the weekend warrior. Not much more to this beer than a glass of water, but like coors light anyone can choke this stuff down. It has very little colore. ui also has very little taste. It did not stimulate my palate much at all, it had little head when poured and quickly lost any trace of that."
"The smell has an interesting, fruity quality that's almost like sour apple. Highly carbonated with a taste that starts out fairly plain, like a stereotypical light beer, then finishes with a somewhat citrus-like aftertaste. The unique finish gives it more character than some light beers I've tried, but nothing special. It's fine for beer pong or if you're just looking for a cold one, but if you really want something satisfying I wouldn't recommend it."
"Slightly dark straw color with a small, thin white head. Aroma of cooked corn and some citrus fruits. Taste was sweeter at first with a touch of grassy adjunct, but it wasn't too strong. Watery middle and the finish had a cranberry like tartness to it. Very dry at the end. This was watery but what do you expect, and the adjuncts were not too strong. Still, I just didn't really care for it too much. Decent for what it is."
"Very light yellow and a small white head, that fell to a stubborn ring. Lots of active carbonation even after a few minutes. Not bad looking at all for a light lager. Smell was nondescript, consisting a watery corn, harsh odors that must be hops and a saccharine hit. Taste is rather malty for the style (or has a sweetener been added?) Watery mouthfeel, an abrupt finish, though it does dry out a bit. Really, nothing terrible, but not particularly memorable either. If someone has it at a football party, pop a can. It won't hurt you."
"The beer pours a pale yellow color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is below average. It has a very faint pale malt scent with loads of adjuncts and a dry, musty lager yeast aroma. The taste is terrible. It has very watery, pale malt flavor with lots of adjuncts present. It has no hop character. It's almost like drinking seltzer water with a slight malt flavor. The mouthfeel is average. It is a low bodied beer with good carbonation. This is a below average light lager. It has little flavor and almost no malt aroma. It's one and done for me."
"Presentation: Packaged in a twelve ounce aluminum bottle, served in a Pilsener glass."
"Soft mouthfeel and definitely light. Mid-level carbonation. Dry finish. The drinkability is OK and I would prefer this over IC if forced to choose."
"Drinkability: I was rather surprised by this beer. Picked up a couple of these following the dont-knock-it-til-you-try-it rule. Glad I tried it, because it was not what I was expecting. There was something kind of good about this beer, and something kind of wrong. Definitely more character than most light beers, so thats a plus. But nothing at all great. Doubt Ill buy one of these again unless its the only alternative to one of the BMC usual suspects. Then I'd definitely ""grab an Arn""."
" Just a note; ABV is 4.15% according to Pittsburgs web site."
"There are worse choices you could make...just don't pick this one when you want to enjoy a good beer."
"You know what? This ain't a bad beer. Poured out to a decent and average golden color, with a small head. Medium carbonation. Odors of corn and sweet alcohol. Not bad for a cheap beer. Flavor is acceptable, not offensive, but not great either. Just needs more character. Finished very smooth and crisp. This could be a good session beer. One well made macro IMO. Recommended."
"Well, this one poured a pale yellow color with minimal head. The smell was of faint malt and some sweetness. The taste was light (go figure) and had hints of malt, corn and rice. The mouthfeel was thin and overly carbonated. As for dinkability, I developed a HUGE headache after drinking just one of these, maybe someone is trying to tell me something. But if you like light beers, give it a shot."
"Pours a one-fingered bubbly, white head that goes very quickly and leaves some lace. Clear pale yellow color. Light carbonation and very light bodied. Nose is hoppy with adjuncts. Starts with a sweet citrus flavor, watery, finish is boring but this has more flavor than a Bud Light. The ABV is 4.15%. 79¢ for a 12oz bottle from Liquor Barn Lexington, KY."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: A heavy mouthfeel for a light lager, but easily quaffable. Not a bad, might actually be a good thirstquencher on a fishing trip."
"like most macro types, this ones basically like iron city, but watered down...alot. thus, it's better than most other macro lights, as iron city is better than most macros. this one pours a light golden colour with lots of carbonated fizz and virtually no smell or flavour. pretty standard stuff. a bit fuller than other light beers, but barely. if you've got to choose from amongst this stuff, stick with regular old iron city."
"Pours golden pale straw hue with a white short lived head with no lacing to spare for my enjoyment. Aroma slightly sweet cooked veggie adjunct origin with a mild flowery hop aroma. Taste light refreshing sweetness here not the smoothest beer here, but better than a lot of other mass produced light lagers out there in my opinion a little partial since I was born in Pittsburgh. Only complaint is the slightly metallic tone in the finish of the beer light bodied and highly carbonated easy going lawnmower beer, not meant to think about and breakdown just to enjoy on a hot day in the sun."
"Hard to beleieve this beer has been replaced by ""The SIlver Bullet"" in the Pittsburgh market. Truly a shame that advertising means more than taste these days. I was not expecting much from this beer, but it delivered a drinkable beer that has an element of actual enjoyment and refreshment from a regional american light lager."
"The colour is a medium/light golden hue and the head of cource is very thin. Carbonation is limited and the body is very weak. The taste is acceptable for a light but is still lacking presence. Just a basic hohum brew that belongs in someone's fridge...but not mine."
"Maybe it is because I lived most of my life in the burgh, but I really like IC Light. Sure it isn't anything to write home about but it is refreshing and a good mediator beer. Keeps you from getting totally wasted in the burgh which is easy to do because beer is so cheap. I will have an Iron anyday of the week."
"I always said, ""Light Beer if for people who don't like beer, but like to pee a lot"".  This is no exception.  This beer is very light yellow, and extremelly clear.  Almost no noticeable smell.  Taste is also almost non existent. Slight taste of malt and cooked rice. Mouthfeel is crisp and higly carbonated, like drinking alka-seltzer. Again, drink cold."
