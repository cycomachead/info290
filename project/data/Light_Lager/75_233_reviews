"Aroma is skunky and white bread. The flavor is similar to the aroma. Not much of anything to this."

"I would only drink it again if i was getting paid"

"worse than extra. just bad"
"Tastes like watered down Corona."
"I like corona but the light version just isn't what you think it would be."
"Horrible, why does anybody drink this stuff, I don't even consider it beer"
"Summer easy drinking beer. With a lime."

"Not much of a difference between this & the extra."
""
"Better get an extra lemon for this one... If Corona Extra is a drunk Mexican's piss in a bottle, then Corona Light is the same drunk Mexican's piss in a bottle, but taken after he started to sober up."
"Awful you're a beer drinker? Skip definitely skip"

"Not bad on a boat after snorkeling. Basically water with a touch of beer flavor."

"Worse than Corona, which is hard to do."

"Not a great beer, but great if you are sitting in the sun and an IPA stonker would give you an instant hangover."

"A refreshing light beer. Not a bad beer"

"It is what it is. Refreshing on summer days in the sun though."

"Despise the fame, Corona beers are not good and Corona Light is one of the worst. You have to put lemon and salt in order to make it drinkable. It gives a horrible after taste flavor."

"If your going to drink a light beer your better off finding a cheap domestic brew. This stuff is over priced and tasted like skunk piss. Terrible beer with a wierd buzz"

"Final Grade: 1.95, a regrettable D-. I have reviewed many American-style adjunct lagers, and while there are definitely a lot of stinkers in that category, there are plenty of cheap, serviceable options as well. I often find that the BA aggregate average overstates the crappiness of these types of beers, but Corona Light is one instance where it is spot on. This is inexcusably, offensively bad, and just a fetid excuse for a light beer all around. I would not pay money for this again, and I doubt I'd accept it as a freebie, either. Light beer fans can easily find something that costs less and doesn't smell like roadkill."
""
""
""
"Great summertime, outdoors, BBQ'ing by the lake beer. Not as good as Sam Adams Light but still quite drinkable."
"Overall a big surprise for a light beer. One of the best I have had. No fruit, salt, or anything else added."

"Pretty bad. If you had tabasco and a lot of lime juice it is.....still pretty bad."
""
""
""
"Overall (2.37) : Surprisingly better than Corona Extra, if only for the fact that there's less Corona ""flavor"". I have Corona Extra still here on my desk (I couldn't bare to finish it for fear of illness), and comparing the two side by side it's easy to say that Corona Light is a more palatable drink. That being said, it's still rather terrible."

"Overall: Corona light is an inoffensive macro light lager. When I first had it, not realizing it was the light version, thought something like ""wow, Corona doesn't taste as crappy as I remember it, in fact it tastes like nothing at all!"". I mean, you can't really rail on this beer for being flavorless, it's nothing like the nauseating Keystone Light, but then again it's pretty expensive for what it is. As far as light beers go, you could do worse. I've used it for carmelizing onions and they turned out pretty well, so maybe there's a use for it after all."

"Pours pretty much like the regular Corona which is a pale straw-yellow. A very thin white head is seen and it's gone! No lacing is seen either. The aroma is just of some grass for the most part. Nothing special. The taste is well...isn't as good as a regular Corona by any means and is of some grass with a slight weak 'watered-down' finish. Nothing to get excited over by any means and glad I just bought a single bottle for a $1.00, which that is probably over-priced."

"Its wide distribution, clear bottles and mass market strategy makes this beer easily attainable in the US, Mexico and in some other regions. A skunky smell and taste is typical and has become characteristical to the beer. Light malt taste, bitter aftertaste and high carbonation represent this beer's experience in my mind - reminds me of eating stale-ish popcorn. I do find it enjoyable in certain occasions, like lying in a beach in Mexico, but by no means is this something I typically go after."

"Pretty much no head on this beer and is clear yellow. Doesn't smell like much of anything, but I'd definitely take this over Bud Light, Coors Light, etc. Nice light beer to have during the summer at parties. If you want quantity > quality, this low-calorie beer is a great option."
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Obviously, Grupo Modelo knows what they are doing. If there was not a demand for this product it would not be marketed. Quite frankly, is the beer an Anchor Steam, Samuel Adams, Defiant, Theakston Old Peculiar, Dogfish Head, or Delirium Tremens?... absolutely not. But it holds a place in the refreshing and enjoyable beer market that is quite successful."

"In all honesty, the beer is fairly clean- but then again so is water. Perhaps enjoyable for its thirst quenching properties in the presence of crashing waves and not air conditioning- it might be what beer drinkers drink to sober up. But its not exactly what true beer enthusiasts crave when wanting beer."

"DATE TASTED: September 1, 2013 ... GLASSWARE: Warsteiner pokal... OCCASION: celebrating the last Sunday before school begins...APPEARANCE: wateresque in density; champagne-like bubbles cascade swiftly; thin, liquid white head...not bad... AROMA: funky off-kilter cardboard (!) and some lemony zest--odd without the lime...otherwise, flat and malty...PALATE: soft, spritzy and extremely drinkable as a light ought to be...little aftertaste...TASTE: not much apart from the soft malts--more likely, corn and rice... OVERALL: a tickling rinse of sunshine that, in the right context, is pleasing if only because it is fleeting, and the repetition is encouraged by the beer's absent character...out of context, minimal calories that could still be better spent eating a Dorito or two..."

"All-in-all, dreadful. Just a mess of off aromas and flavors which do not blend well together."
""
"The appearance of Corona Light was a pale yellow coloring. It smelled a bit different and maybe a little musty and tasted a little watery. I thought that it went better when I tried a lime with it instead. I think that it has a bland taste but a nice appearance overall."
""
"I recently had a bottle of Corona Light this weekend. It had a clear yellow appearance but did not smell very pleasant. In fact, it smelled almost musty. The taste was similarly musty but and very watery. It felt very light in my mouth and did not have any body at all. Overall I would rate this beer a 1.75. I was not impressed. It wasn't terrible with a Mexican food pairing but it still did not do much to help the poor taste."

"O- I think the review speaks for itself. Quite a change to go from my normal craft beer rotation to having a glass of my wife's corona light. But it has its purpose- hot weather, on the beach, not wanting to get full, and abundance of limes and salt, and few other options available."

"I've never been one to decline a free beer. If I am at a buddy's house and there is only American adjunct lager available, I will drink it. My sister offered me a corona light at her house (she was on a diet at the time). It has a classic urine type appearance to it as most beers in this category have. It initially had a skunky smell to it with maybe a smell of water logged socks sitting in my backpack for a week would have thrown in. The taste is something awful. It's obviously very watered down but it tastes just as it smells. I cringed the first few sips then politely told my sister I couldn't stomach it any longer. I drank about half of the 12 ounce bottle. This is without a doubt the worst tasting beer I've ever had in my life and I've had all of the classic bad ones (PBR, Natural Light, Bud, Miller High Life, etc.). This beer is an entirely new kind of awful."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Over All: I thought the beer to be a bit lacking in flavor and not really thirst quenching. It was a lot more carbonation than flavor happening for me. Not a refreshing drink."
""
""
""
""
""
"Thin and watery body; ample carbonation; mouthfeel still manages to lack crispness and a clean refreshing quality. All the limes in the world cant save this one, I'm afraid. Light layers may not be very good as a group to begin with but this one comes close to the very bottom of the heap."

"O: There’s a big problem when a lime is almost necessary to make a beer drinkable. I couldn’t find myself to finish it. There’s not much to say here, I’m just thankful we have great counterparts out there. I wouldn’t recommend or buy."

""
""
""
""

""
""
""
""
"Final Thoughts: Halfway through drinking the glass I added a lemon wedge. It improved the taste a tad, but really doesn't make a difference to the score. This is my first time having a Corona Light and it goes right up there with the blandest beers I've tasted."
""
""
""
"O: This is better than Cornona Extra. Because light beers are supposed to be light."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - It's in a clear bottle. It's from Mexico. It is craptacular."
""
""
""
"If you're gonna waste your time, just get the regular Corona. Don't bother with the Light. It's already light. It doesn't need to be lighter. Any lighter and it's just going to float away."
""
""
"O: Not a great beer or even a good one, I guess this is best drunk (if ever) in the hot sun at the beach for hydration - though I think I would personally prefer water. I hate the clear glass bottle as I'm sure that does not help with the skunky notes."
"O: This beer is easy to drink and wasn’t horrible but doesn’t have much of a taste. The clear bottle might high have something to do with the skunky nature."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a clear light orange with an off-white head that fades to a film on top of the beer. No lacing on this one. Smell is of grain, corn flakes, water, and metal. Taste is the same with an emphasis on the watery quality. This beer has an extremely low level of carbonation with a very thin and watery mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty horrible beer with no real redeeming qualities. Definitely one of the worst Mexican beers I have had so far."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"just an unacceptable brew by almost every count. i say almost because on cinco de mayo at 10:30 in the morning on a mild hangover when its 90 degrees out and its the only beer at the party, its tolerable in small doses. clear bottle shows watery less than yellow, some chemically white bubbles. smells like corn syrup, preservative, and dead beer. ugh. flavor isnt actually awful in the context of these adjunct light bogus semibrews. bit of malt, balanced. very light on the mouthfeel and sodapop carbonation. definitely refreshing, but it tastes so much worse than even some of the lowliest craft offerings. overall it would take a near miracle to get me to drink one of these again. with corona extra being one of the lightest beers out, who needs this even weaker version? yikes"

"I had this at the airport in Cancun just before I leave. Bright yellow colour with lots of bubbles in the glass and a one finger head that quickly went off leaving light lacing on the surface. Sweet aroma of limes and a bitter-ish taste that leaves a corn aftertaste. Watery mouthfeel, almost too much actually. Light carbonation.Not a significant difference on taste than the normal Corona"

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - It's tough to imagine a beer that's lighter on the flavour front than Corona Extra, but this certainly achieves that feat. If you're looking for something that's mildy more flavoured than water, then this is your optimal choice."
""
""
""
""
""

"Has a light and domestic taste."

"Overall- The beer as a whole package is dreadful. It smells like skunk, and even if it didn't, there would only be corn. And I am not sure the flavors of the beer would be any better. Obviously this beer should be avoided at all cost, unless you are looking for the tick."

"Overall: This is not a beer, I refuse to acknowledge this being classified as a beer. That is not to say that it does not have an appeal, I can see why it is so popular. There is nothing off putting about its taste, and it is quite refreshing on a hot day, especially with a lime wedge. But after really analyzing the taste, I can not acknowledge this beverage being a beer, it has less than the bear essentials for being classified as such. Therefore I refuse to give it anything above the minimum score."

"D/O- Below average thirst quencher/get hammered beer. ""Nasty"" compared to what I like to drink, yes, but nothing that is so gross that you need to pour out the bulk of, which I've done with others. Easy tick of the #1 ""Bottom of the List"" beer....here's to never having this beer again :p"

"Overall Drinkability - Water with a few drops of stale coffee dripped into it, filtered with old cardboard. Just imagine what Budweiser would taste like if it was diluted with 3 parts water. Had to squeeze in an orange wedge just to finish it."
"AVOID THIS BEER!"
"O: TIP: I added about 5 lime slices to the bottle and my rating instantaneously jumped up to a ""B."" Wait a minute... isn't that just straight up lime juice? I friggin love lime juice!"
"Mouthfeel/Overall: Mouthfeel is extremely light and watery with prickly carbonation. Not real smooth going down. Overall, what I expected. At least it was not skunked to the level of some I have had in the past. In an reasonably normal state (sans skunkiness), this beer is not as bad as most would make it out to be. Still, it is certainly not good, or even decent."
"I had never had this and decided it was tine. Drank from bottle during Happy Hour on Taco Tuesday at Mi Pueblo. Never again. I took a sip and nearly gagged. I gave it to my friend who doesn't care about craft beer. He took a sip and he nearly gagged as well. two sips and then left the bottle."
"I understand the ratings on this site based on comparisons with non-light beers, but for a light, this has been my beer of choice for several years. I actually like the grainy scent and taste. By the way, I normally go for hop-heavy beers, so go figure???"
"Like water, this is a brew for quenching thirst, not savoring!"
"If you're in the mood for a light beer, there are better ones available."
"Overall, this can be a good refreshing beer for hot summer days with low alcohol content but if you're looking for something tastier and stronger then look somewhere else."
"Pours a golden yellow with a very thin lacing of head that quickly fades. There's noticeable bubbles. Smell is incredibly faint; grainy nothing else. Taste is also very faint; grains and corn. Mouthfeel is crisp and clean, maybe a little over carbonated."
"Overall, this is your typical American adjunct lager. Tons off strange flavors that aren't really appealing on any levels, but it's cheap and easily drank on a hot day. Oh well, to each his own."
"Overall not for me, maybe a good chick beer but that's about it."
"Corona Light as in most Mexican beers taste best in the summer with a lime...however, judging Corona Light solomente...its just another no frills cerveza! The beer poors golden clear with good carbonation that give a white foamy head for a brief time. The smell and taste are enhanced with grain. The hops help somewhat with the taste so that it is not bread water. Mouthfeel is easy especially on hot days...enjoy!"
"O - If you're on the beach and have a lime then it's not bad, it is what it is."
"O: Not sure which is worse, this or regular Corona. Not sure it really matters, either."
"Overall, this is purely a marketing gimmick. Nobody would elect to drink this beer because of the taste (nobody with taste anyways). Considering Corna Extra is fairly light already, I can't recommend this beer for any reason."
"m-much like any other light lager"
"o - Call me crazy, but I actually thought this was slightly better than Corona Extra. Extra had a little bit mroe skunkiness to it in the taste, so this one is getting the nod. Still not a good beer, and I suggest going for most anything else."
"i would drink again when its free again but otherwise I would rather spend the same amount on water thats nicer."
"I have to disagree with most of the reviews here: this isn't terrible. For one, it's a light beer that actually has some semblance of flavor. On the other hand, that flavor is cheap and tastes like corn sugar. It's also thin. It's not terrible...but it's bad enough to not be worth trying."
"To improve on the whole experience, added a squeezed lime wedge to the bottle. Much better, now it tastes ad smells like lime, and pretty much nothing else."
"Like I wrote in my CAN review, this seems like a product of the Department of Redundancy Department. Corona and Light just seems like doubling down. My pour created a finger of very fizzy bone-white head that was bubbling its way out of existence almost as quickly as I could pour. Color was a pale lemon-yellow with NE-plus quality clarity. I could see into the future through this one and it was not pretty! Nose was pretty cereal-adjunct laden and there was no disguising it. Pheh! Mouthfeel was fizzy with a mere modicum of watery taste on the tongue. Blah! Finish was dry and refreshing, but water would have the same effect and this was effin' close to water! Why, oh why, do I do this to myself."
"Overall- Very watery. Though it is slightly better than I remember it, but still don’t envision a scenario where I would drink it again. This beer sucks, even within the style. But where ever they film the commercials, I wan't to go to there!"
"Not quite a finger of head, and it lasted about as long as it took to pour it. Minor lace and very little cling. Color is a 3 on the SRM beer color chart. Smell is very faint, with aromas of wet corn, and malt. Taste is hardly there, tastes of wet roasted corn, rice, and malt, with just a trace of lime. Mouthfeel was water, with a little fizz. Not something I would buy again, unless I was in Mexico and there wasn't any other beer available."
"Serving type: bottle"
"Light bodied but again, not as pale or light as the reviews make it out to be. The flavornis pretty bad with faint hop bitterness followed by an odd metallic flavor along with hints of grainy adjuncts. Lots of corn flavor. I hate putting fruit in beer but adding a lime actually improves this beer giving it a sweet citrus flavor. That bein said you shouldn't have to add fruit to a beer to improve it's taste. Pretty bad but not entirely offensive and easy to drink in hot weather. The scores are really terrible for this beer but I'm not sure they're entirely warranted."
"O: Not good. Not the worst beer I've ever had in my life, but a beer that I dont need to consume ever again."
"D: Fantastic after a few nice ones, and the cooler starts to get low."
"O-I've heard that Corona intentionally skunks their beer by using the clear bottles, because apparently some people like this??! Maybe this tastes good fresh; and maybe it tastes better with the lime. But regardless, there are far better options. Hey if you want a good summer beer that's refreshing, take some Goose Island 312 and add 50% water, and you'd have a similar beer but maybe it'd taste half way decent!"
"It may be refreshing on a hot day, but that's it."
"RJT"
"Overall, I think I shaved 10 years of my life with this brew, skunked batch of awful. Seriously though clear bottles are now a turn off when it comes to beer, only redeeming quality is it's not bad to observe from a safe distance"
"Pours a clean pale yellow color with a small white to no head at all. In the aroma, small skunkiness to a light, sweet European lager smell. In the taste, watery European pale lager to nothing. A small bite and light bodied mouthfeel, with a small dryness to clean aftertaste. Watery, no real taste. ICKY!"
"O - Would it refresh on a hot beach? Yes. Will it quench the desire for a remotely flavorful beer? Most definitely not. While it's certainly not good, it's definitely not the world's worst beer. I never have the ""Light"" version but the Corona's I drink very few and far between always have a lime."
"My theory on how Corona is made...many agree with me: 10000 Mexicans each drink a bottle of cheap tequila and then pee into a large vat. Then the contents of the vat are bottled up and shipped to your local dive bar!"
"This beer is the WORST commercial light beer is America, completely imperfect, very thin, very boring, and skunked. Why would Grupo Modelo make a beer that is lighter than an already light beer. Almost worthy of a drain pour (of course I'm not going to do that)."
"Now, on the bad part. Grainy, slightly bitter, typical, or is it, flavours you get with a Light beer though most I have tried didn't offend; this one does. Messy, unbalanced, vegetal like madness thrown in. Yuck. Terrible beer that I don't need to go on about.."
"I will drink this again when it is free again, which will likely be in an hour or so."
"Corona light is the same but about 2 times worse."
"D- Decent."
"I cant drink this beer! This just might be the worst beer that Ive ever had!"
"I don't understand how or why people buy, let alone drink this. Corona Extra is at least understandable to me. It's a summertime thing, it can be refreshing, yadda yadda yadda. This, the Light version, horrible. It's the palest beer imaginable. It's the clearest yellow they could manage and has a light white head. It smells of nothing other than skunked beer. There's literally nothing to it. The flavor too, it's skunk light. It isn't even worthy of a lime. It's also one of the lightest, most watery beers around. It isn't drinkable whatsoever. You might as well order soda water."
"As pale as yellow can get. Almost a clear yellow with a faint fizzy white head that disappears in the blink of an eye. Smells like cooked cream corn. There's more taste than I expected but that's not a good thing. It's a musty grainy flavor. Yuck! Mouthfeel is very thin and thier is very little after taste. THank goodness. If you have to add a lime to make it drinkable then I declare it undrinkable."
"This beer is a grade A piece of junk. But it's also a great beer to utilize for a big night of drinking games. It's simple, totally barf worthy, and probably cheap as shit - I dunno. I still don't like it, and I never will. The only thing I do like is their commercials. That Christmas one is a classic - honestly, a palm tree with Xmas lights? That's gold, and this is piss."
"This was my step dad's go to beer many moons ago when I was growing up, more so Extra than Light but Corona was his quality beer. Budweiser was his regular offering, btw. Again light pale golden clear bodied lager, low in alcohol. No lime wedge squeezed and shoved down the neck of the bottle for me. A good old fashioned pour into a fluted pils glass. Very pale yellow, quickly fleeting white head really no lace is left behind. Sorry looking beer, let's go for a few sniffs...cooked veggies/corn/rice with a solvent green/skunked/grassiness. Wow, this is the worst fuckin' beer I've ever tasted, it's got off flavors coming at the palate from every direction. I though cold temp would make this beer more suitable, this is unbearable. At first sip it was terrible, second sip no better not as rough. The off flavors begin to actually justify themselves and if served cold enough without a lime you may be able to drink the whole bottle. I'm starting to get a headache half way through, and I have drank mass produced swill beer my whole life, wtf? My head is now tingling like a just huffed on chemicals. This beer tastes wrotten with skunked/strong carbonation cooked vegetables not much sweetness or fruitiness pretty clean finish. Mouthfeel is watery/carbonation is crazy high like I just dropped an alka seltzer in it. Drinkability overall is a never again verdict, I will never dance with this devil again."
"Final Thoughts: This beer isn't the worst beer out there, but it's close. It's like it does the absolute bare minimum to stop you from saying it's without merit, and in some ways that's even more irritating. The other question is, why would you drink this when the already ludicrously light standard Corona would likely be available wherever this is sold. I think with some lime, this beer would rank around a D to D- but stand alone, it's a big ol' F, which I can't say I didn't expect."
"People hate on this beer, but I think it's perfect to have outside on the beach or by a pool. I could down a 6-pack with no problem and not be bloated and sick beyond belief. I think this is what it is made for."
"Presented in a nice clear bottle with a decent yellow color. Beer is skunky and smells terrible. Tastes like dirty water and leaves no taste in your mouth because it has none. As far as drinkability is concerned, you could pound a few if you are not a conoisseur or you just dont care about beer taste."
"D: How do people pay a dollar per bottle of this junk? In all honesty, I would drink Natty Light over this. They taste about the same, but Natty is cheaper. On a side note, I hate corona from my days at Beers of the World, due to the countless bottles I had to sort that contained moldy limes."
"Flavor. There is none to be found. It's not like Rolling Rock though, where there's little flavor yet it's at least refreshing. This is just not at all enjoyable. I wasn't expecting much, but jeez, I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. Very fake with a typical faint adjuct smell and taste with a very, very pale yellow color. Essentially no head. Nothing positive to speak of."
"Pours a transparent golden color with a lot of carbonation and really not much of a white head. The nose is a bit skunky with some really, really light grain. The taste is just about nothing. Lightly-skunked hops and some faint grain husks. Very light with high carbonation. This tastes bad."
"D- Undrinkable, thin and water with a rotten egg and skunk taste. I see why people put lime in this. I'm not sure the lime could even salvage it."
"Not very tastey."
"Drinkability? What's that?"
"Hey it is what it is - really really cheap beer meant to be drunk ice cold on a hot day. Really it's just filtered and purified water in an average attractive bottle with a convenient long neck for wedging a lime slice into it. Yeah, I'll drink this given the right circumstances, I'll even enjoy it, but it's certainly not a beer lovers beer."
"Drinkability: Unclean and unpleasant. I certainly couldn't fault anyone for chucking a lime into this, or even the adding salt thing I occasionally people engaging in, 'cause this beer needs some help."
"Final Thougts: AVOID!!!! nuff said."
"D-Maybe more drinkable the the Extra. Maybe not. Either way i'll try in most instances to stay away from Corona. If I needed to choose I'll take a crappy American born Light before this. Like the Extra, needs a lime to make it taste alright."
"D: It's fine, for a light lager. Better than Bud or Coors Light - a dubious honor to be sure. For the semi-premium price, there's no reason to bother at all. Still, if someone brings this over, I'm not too good to drink the leftovers."
"Light bodied, fair carbonation, and just plain terrible. I will try most anything once, but I will not be giving this another chance."
"Drinkability - It was the only cold beer in the house. I think that I would have enjoyed this beer more if I didn't actually think about these 5 categories and how short it falls of the mark in any of them."
"Overall, i enjoy having these.. while in Mexico. I find it heavily carbonated and slightly overrated. The taste has no distinguishable characteristics, no hints of flavor, just carbonation. Even less taste than the extra. With lime, on a beach in mexico, I can enjoy it. But as an import, especially any time outside of the summer, this is not my beer of choice."
"A pale straw yellow body with a foamy white cap that rose and settled to a very thin layer. The aroma is light. Toasted corn, metal and sulphur. Corn and artificial grain up front on the palate with a sweeping brush of metallic nastiness. This is crisp and clean and completely devoid of true flavor. Light body with little to no aftertaste. This is tough get down, had to add a lime halfway through to at least give me a little something to grasp on to."
"And since it has that marketing term ""light"" on the label, I will follow Madison Ave. down that aisle and state that it's slightly more drinkable than American lights. A bit more heft, but nothing special."
"D- A definite negative recommendation even among light lagers. there's just nothing that one could positively point to as solid about this one. The smell and flavor are just too artificial and blatantly adjuncty to allow this to be decent."
"I may be in the minority, but I'd prefer Corona Light over ole Corona Extra. I find the light to be more drinkable while keeping similar smell and taste (although slightly more watery.) It's a beer I go back to on occasion but only because my friends swear by it."
"Overall: The body of the beer is super light and the finish is light also. The beer has a really dank dark basement flavor that is hard to swallow. A drain pour."
"Not as bad as I expected or remembered. Here's the problem: light beers suck. Taking that into consideration, this ain't that bad. Most light beers or macros for that matter have a strong off taste: sickening corn or rice sweetness and no hops. This too has no hops (except maybe a slight slight bittering finish). But the sweet grainy off flavor that you find in say Heineken or even Bud Light is absent here. Not too bad. Not really beer, but not offensive either. It is what it is. But next time you're at a BBQ and offered one, don't sweat it... it won't kill you. It won't even be that bad either."
"D - I wouldn't want another, bad aftertaste."
"Drinkability, meh..."
"wow i hope somebody from corona doesn't read my review... lol.. thankfully for them i am such a small minority.. if someone really likes beer they don't drink this.. that's the plain and simple truth..."
"Oured from 12 oz. bottle into standard pint glass. Pale yellow with no head. No lacing. Barely an smell. Barely any taste--like sudsy water. Mouthfeel isn't unpleasant--slightly foamy. Not terrific, just not unpleasant. As for drinkability, standard Corona rules apply--that is to say, on a sunny day on the beach, if you drop a lime into this, I'm sure it is refreshing. Otherwise, don't drink it."
"Drinkability: Even for the style, this one is just bad. There is a very chemical taste to this that does not mix with the straw. Way better options out there."
"Drinkability - This was passable in a category having a very low bar."
"Poured from a clear 12 oz. bottle. Has a pale yellow color with a small head. Smell is mild, some corn. Taste is, well, I am still searching for it. Really not much of anything here. Feels light in the mouth and has decent drinkability. Overall not the worst light beer I have had, but nothing special."
"Really doesn't taste like beer. No excuse to drink this unless it is over 85 degrees."
"and I thought Corona was a light beer all ready, no mater where you find yourself you will have better options then this"
"Overall: Corona Extra is better."
"Please see my review for Corona Extra, because these beers are almost identical. Which is a good thing for people watching their waist. I wish more beers could make a light edition this close to their flagship. Actually, I wish soda companies could do that, because Diet Coke is just gross. But the bottom line is, Corona is not a great beer, but they are perfect for that nice sunny day."
"Very clear in appearance not impressed at all. The sell is skunk with a little malt. The taste is bout the same. I would defintely not run out to buy this beer if it hadn't been free I would have wasted my money trying it. The mouthfeel is thin and wispy though it has a very nice drinkability because it does go down rather smooth. It is surley not something I would rave about!!"
"D- None. Period."
"Pours a light yellow color, nice carbonation, small white head, with some sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, with some hops, slight caramel. The taste is slightly sweet, malty, slight hop note. Light body. Not drinkable, would not buy again."
"I like this beer a lot actually, despite giving it a low rating. It delivers on refreshment, espically in the summer. I like it with a lime, and appreciate it's low calorie and alcohol content. I can throw a few of these back without much thought, but definitely suggest having them with lime."
"Disgusting, skunky, flat, no alcohol... drink perrier instead!"
"I'm drunk...so I decided to pour a Corona Light that my parents have into a pint glass. The beer is literally ""SEE THROUGH"" with no cloudiness. I could honestly drive my motor vehicle with a Corona Light windshield and probably see better than I do now. This beer could possibly have an eye prescription body to it. Tastes like it needs lime... I gave this a 5.0 for drinkability because I could drink these all night without thinking ugly girls are beautiful."
"D: Not flavorful at all, goes down easily because it's so light, not filling at all, extremely mild kick, even within a lackluster style this beer falls very short and is just not good unless you want to drink a beer that has almost no chance to get you drunk."
"Okay, I'll admit I can drink a Corona anytime, from the bottle and with a lime. Never really had the light before but am not impressed (not that I thought I would be). I just can't drink this. Not good."
"is this beer? really? this is lacking is everything except carbonation and coldness. the only thing i like about this is the lime in the bottle. at least the lime has some colour to it. the smell is non existent and the clear bottles surely do not help preserve any hops that could have been put in."
"Drinkability: I tried to be fair above -- this is certainly not a good beer, but it's also not the nightmare that its score suggests. That said, I don't see myself ever drinking this again; almost anything else would be a better choice even on a hot day, this beer's preferred setting."
"I had this free at a family Christmas party, but not something I would buy myself."
"Gross. This beer really bothers me. It is worse than Corona Extra, that much I know from a side by side, but this beer has a terrible grainy flavor and has the consistency of water. Never again."
"Corona's watered down cousin. They call it pi$$ water and that is basically how it smells. This is one of the ones the colder it is the better to numb your tongue. I can stand them on a boiling hot day, other than that I would rather drink almost anything. It's one of the beers i started drinking with but now it is just blech at best."
"This is worse than the corona extra."
"This beer is a light yellow with a very thin, glass-clinging head, no discernible smell, body, or finish. Immensely thin, there is a beer component to it in that it does have a sharp, crisp finish, despite the lack of the malt body. It is also relatively balanced, also despite the lack of body."
"I will accept just about any beer for free. This one pushes the envelope."
"Much worse than your typical macro lager piss beer."
"If you can call it beer. Tastes more like sawdust mixed with tonic water."
"If you like light lagers i guess you would like this but i just can't stomach it."
"It has a darker golden color as opposed to most in the category with a one finger head. The smell is of corn and is weak, more of an alcohol smell. The taste is more flavorful than most beers in this category, the taste is of grain and some malt. Nothing complex or exciting though. The mouthfeel is a little rough, a little overly carbonated. You good drink a couple of these but no more, better than the average light beer but no a great beer."
"Drinkability: For what it is, I feel this is a decent Light Lager. It's certainly nothing special, but not the worst thing I've ever had."
"Yellow pale color, a little bit lighter than the original Corona. Medium head formation and almost no lace retention. Almost no aromas of hops and a little bit of malts. Some taste of malts and hops but with less bitterness than regular Corona. Finishes dry with the same aftertaste of Corona, almost no difference."
"Its yellow and fizzy -- earth shattering news I know. Smells like nothing, lemon, lime or whatever fruit you decide to mash into the bottle opening. Taste (without fruit addition) is a barely there sweetness, you know you're not drinking water but almost. This feels very light bodied although there is a crispness to the mouthfeel which is pleasant. Its average for light beers drinkability wise but I'd rather drink this at a party than crystal light."
"Drinkability: Pretty bad for a light lager. Easy enough to drink, if you can get past the taste. Had with a lime on a warm summer BBQ, it can work though."
"If the look of this beer were any closer to urine, it might make me uncomfortable. The smell is non-existent, especially because of the lime someone jammed into my bottle (if I wanted something your pinkie touched, I'd drink the inside of your ear...). The taste was tolerable with a lime, otherwise this tastes like dirty tap water. The mouthfeel is not unlike tap water, as well. The only upside to this is the slightly above terrible drinkability, because of how watery it is."
"The only reason you would want to drink this is if it were the last beer on earth and you had no way of brewing your own. But, fermenting your own urine may just produce a better product."
"But seriously, why bother ?"
"D: It is what it is, light lager-looking beer, used just for refreshment. Not the greatest but not the worst I've every had."
"d- i'm judging this for what it is, which is a super light, very easy to drink summer beverage, you know what your getting when you pick up a corona light."
"Mouthfeel / Drinkability: Ok the body is thin and watery. Is this a second running of Corona Extra? Oddly enough I find this version much improved over Corona Extra. Did the can remove the skunk profile? This is a throw back beer. I couldnt drink alot of this as it would bore the shit out of me. Not terrible but I dont think I will repeat."
"The mouth feel is pretty light as well as the drinkability. This beer is low in ABV so there is no real presence of alcohol or strong flavor that will hinder the feel of this beer."
"D: If I haven't gotten the point across, stick with Extra. Corona Light isn't as enjoyable in the sun and summer. The lime takes away some of the problems though."
"Final thoughts: Lighter version of extra. If you wanna drink it, get a lime. It helps with the unpleasent taste. Drink on hot days. Cinco de Mayo"
"This beer pours a clear pale straw color. The head is a half inch in height, and recedes quickly into sparse lacing. The aroma is of air and faint corn sweetness. The taste is like the aroma with the addition of a nasty funky taste. The mouthfeel is light bodied with a watery texture, and too much carbonation. Overall, this is not a good light lager. I will never drink this again."
" The smell is carbonated, like mineral water; in the drinkability, is easy to drink."
"...the lime was added after a few sips for a lime free review."
"D- This one is pretty hard to drink because of the offensive off-flavors in the taste. If definitely needs a lime or something to help mask the offensive flavors I'm picking up. I'd definitely avoid this one."
"A clear pale yellow color with s very thin fizzy head,that quickly diminishes to nothing. Almost no aroma,faint grain and cheep rubbing alcohol. Flavor is almost nonexistant too, kind og a light fake fruit,some washed out grain and a hint of baby vomit,tossing in a lime wedge helped out a little.Thin watery body,lots of carbonation. A very low quality product at any price !"
"I used to drink this stuff when I was younger and thought it was great. Since then I have learned a ton about beer and taste. I finally was offered one of these recently, so heck, I took a free beer. This is the most unappealing beer I have ever poured. It pours straw yellow with no head. Smells dominated by corn. Taste is watery and that's about it. The mouthfeel is really thin and over carbonated. The best feature of this beer is its drinkability, when its warm out and you cant find water, this is the next best choice."
"It's not the worst I've had, honestly, but I'm not buying it just to have something. Quality over quantity, and this one is the latter."
"D 4.0 - pretty enjoyable for light beer in taste & drinkability. These go on sale a lot, the calories and ABV are respectable for a light session beer. I wouldn't turn one down as they have kinda grown on me due to my buddy across the street."
"Pours an extremely very pale colored body, with a big white creamy head, somewhat lasting. Very malty aroma, some nuttiness. Vegetably, aroma, maybe corn. Crisp fruity, vegetably taste. Some nuttiness. Lager-like, but not as tasty as some others. Maybe corn or something. Has some taste, but not a good taste. Bleh, not good."
"I guess it's what it is. Corona got a C-. This doesn't get quite that much. It's carbonation is its best point I guess. If it's a hot day and you have one of these icy cold in the fridge, and you need something to drink, then drink it. But if you have a diet Coke or something, get it instead. It's not that the Corona light is excessively disgusting or anything. It's just that it's like drinking carbonated water. It has virtually no flavor at all, and what smell it has is vaguely unpleasant. All in all, it's not something to be thrown away if you already have it, or if someone hands it to you, just down it to be polite. But don't buy it. Diet Coke has a better flavor."
"Look, it's not good. Honestly, it doesn't taste like a whole lot. Which is sort of the problem. I'd almost prefer if it was just bad, instead of just not being anything."
"This is one of the best light beers going. I don't understand why a basic light beer from Mexico gets such a low score. Not every beer is from Belgium and full of strong heavy flavor. But to me, that is a great thing. I like to drink different beers at different times and this beer is a great easy drinking light beer with low alcohol so you can have a few and enjoy the sunshine. Lighten up Francis, it's just beer."
"North of 49, they actually have to label the ABV on even this kind of stuff, and it's 3.7%, as if it really matters. Anyways, not overly offensive, plain, and not good for much, unless you're hemorrhaging fluids on vacation somewhere, and still want to appear to be drinking."
"A great under-the-bleachers taste, with a faint, Charlie Brown-green bread flavor that lingers in the back of the mouth for a few seconds. Me and my gal- bimbo, limbo, spam- we both paused the relish on this one. She had another, and so did I."
"I wanted to rip into this beer for being the swamp water I'd heard it described as. Really though, it's just an average crappy beer to avoid. Nothing worth expounding over."
"A wan straw-yellow, it pours with a minimal white head that does not hang around. Aroma was weak, and the de rigueur lime on the glass mostly masked it. Flavor was typically lagerish, malty but lacking crispness. It didn't taste watery like most ""lite"" beers, but flavor was still uninspiring. Texture was not thin or watery; however, it was rather lifeless. Definitely one to pass up."
"4/3/4/2/7 (2.0/5)"
"I ask you, Grupo Modelo, why? Why brew an even weaker version of your famous beer? Less flavor, less aroma, less alcohol. Pours nearly clear. There is no aroma, as all I smell is minerals, which I attribute to the bottle. The taste is a travesty of stale water. This beer sucks."
"Pours watery and pale yellow. Aroma of skunk, nothing else. When it hits my mouth I'm slapped with strong carbonation, a skunky taste, very weak actual beer taste. I find myself wondering if most of the people who drink this have even even tasted a real beer. Probably not. This is basically a spoiled soft drink with alcohol content. Quite possibly the worst beer I've ever tasted in my entire life and way more expensive than other beers on this level of crappiness- this beer deserves the terrible rating. I needed a lime just to finish this beer."
"Notes: Did this brew come from the second running or pressings of the mash? On second thought maybe one should put the lime in this brew to mask the astringent off flavors."
"I'd rather drink most other macros than this, but its still a cheapass macro so not awful straight out of a bottle at a party with a bunch of people"
"d - a good beer to drink if you plan on spilling a lot, would be more drinkable if it didn't taste so bad"
"D: It is what it is, a fair light lager, certainly not the worst beer I've ever had. There's nothing here that makes me want to have another one, especially at $7.99 a sixer, when there's so much good beer to be had that's less expensive, fine to try on a $1.25 single."
"the mouthfeel is fine, and if you had a need to drink mass quantities of beer frat boys/girls this one is better than the other light beers you drink...but I do here it has about the same amount of calories as regular corona, no need for me to do the research as I wont have another...."
"drinkability: I guess it good be good for long beach days"
"I can't say I didn't enjoy this brew, but I can certainly say I did have a good time drinking it. This is a sociable beer when conversation and interaction with non beer drinkers dominate the entertainment."
"D: not on your life, well deserving of a 1.0 rating and a dumper."
" ~ I must sadly admit this to be a novelty brew. It's been given the label of a tropical and festive drink. Unfortunately, the brewery should spend more time on what's in the bottle instaed of so much on advertisements."
"Pale yellow color with not really much to it. No reason for a Corona Light. Drink half a Corona, fill it back up with water and you've got Corona Light. Kind of like a diet Corona and believe me a Corona doesn't need less flavor. Throw a lime in it and fire down tacos or fajitas and I'm sure the beer will be fine."
"Paler than the gringo drinking it on the beach. Head, what's head? Faint smell of corn, mmm. Taste is on par with tap water. Mouthfeel is similar, maybe lighter than water. Drinkable only if you're making progress with the cute Mexican girl next to you. If you enjoy wearing lipstick, riding dolphins, shaving your legs, poodles, synchronized swimming and/or Oprah, look no further than this little bottle of fabulousness!"
"d - this is just terrible. It looks refreshing on a cold day, but I couldn't finish it."
"I do not see how this beer can receive a better rating that Natural Light, but I guess that is just my opinion...This beer is by no means a good beer, but I will admit that its drinkability is better than other light lagers. Especially when you live in Florida and live on a college budget, Corona is sometimes an alternative"
"Corona is pretty light and watery as is, so I just had to see what this one was about. Seethru light yellow with a big head that died instantly; minimal carbonation. Smell is weak and airy, some grainy adjunct smell that isn't even quasi-citrusy like regualr Corona. Goes down extra smooth/slick because it is so light, unfortunately there isn't much taste rather than some citric hops and a mild backbite that lets you know you're drinking (this is without the lime, although it couldn't hurt at this point). I don't see the point in drinking this swill."
"D: How does anyone in their right mind spend money on this? There are plenty of macros out there that beat this stuff hands down for 2/3 the price."
"Pours an extremely clear, extremely pale yellow color. Lots of carbonation bubbles. Not much of a head. Smells slightly husky, other than that not much of anything. Same with the taste...slightly husky, very mild grains, no hoppiness at all. Very bland and watery with an off taste in the finish. Extremely carbonated, pretty crisp. I guess it's fairly drinkable if I had nothing else around...not by choice."
"Obviously, it's meant for people who are on a diet and want to put a lime in it without the flavor of beer (or much flavor at all). Less offensive than Corona Extra, though."
"I will never drink this again. Ever. Not even if you pay me or tempt me with better. Save your money and don't fall for the stupid ""party and relax!"" commercials."
"I am not gonna review this beer like the others.... Basically this beer tastes like tainted water. No hints of malt or hops just course flavors with no body. Its almost like this beer was brewed with all adjunct sugars and not an once of barley was used. The regular corona is light enough and this beer, in my opinion, is overkill."
"Not one of my greatest moments, but I did this for you guys. I suppose it's fine for a customer to pay $25 a case if it makes them happy, but if they really want to feel happy while wasting their money, I would recommend recreational drugs to them."
"Yes it's crap, and yes it's in a clear bottle. Say what you will (and you'd probably be correct) but this beer has it's place. Drop in a lime wedge (yeah, I said it) and relax with one or ten. This is the type of beer I would never buy, but I would never turn down if the mood is right and it were offered to me."
"A thin, pale swill. It smells like cheap, off-brand breakfast cereal, reminiscent of imitation Cheerios you'd buy at a discount store. There's little to no hops or malt flavor. Corona is defined mostly by a watery metal taste, like mineral water or seltzer. The only way to make this beer remotely drinkable is to shove a lime (or several) down its neck, add a little salt, and serve it so intensely cold that you freeze your taste buds and spare them the experience. It is not worth it."
"An overall uneventful light beer. No real suprises here."
"M/D - Thin, watery. Barely passable as beer."
"Yea look it's your average beer, with mexican theme, and a lime. woo. I guess the only thing to say is that this beer is easily located with friends who dont explore their beverage tastes houses, but when given the choice of Corona Light and anything else they have, I'll take it."
"Pale yellow color. Looks much better in the bottle. Does this little brother of Corona stand a better chance at greatness. No. The smell is skunky and grainy. I'm not sure it has a taste until you add a lime. Then, it taste like lime. The body is light and not refreshing like the commercials suggest. Not very drinkable in my book. This stuff is like $15 a 12 pack. Ridiculous. But good marketing."
"Listen,just because one was once ignorant to what good beer is really like does not mean that we have to embrace our past mistakes. I look back and I feel I always knew this beer was bad. I look back and yes I am glad I now know what a good brew is and all those still drinking this beer are left in the dark. End of Story."
"Not that anyone here needs to be told this, but avoid this beer at all costs."
"Notes: Highly unrecommended by me... My lowest rating yet..."
"I placed the term ""beer"" in quotes for this because this was absolutely revolting in my opinion. This is the ONLY beer (aside from Corona Extra and Blue Moon) that I simply could not finish. I had to give it away."
"If you're looking for water with a kick, you can consider this drinkable. Certainly not filling."
"I wanted to see what all the fuss was about this beer. I was not impressed. Not a very good tasting beer at all. Too bitter! A slight hint of rice. No head to speak of. Now I know why they put the lime slice on the bottle. I would not recommend this beer due the taste and price."
"I would not turn this beer down if it were the last beer on earth, but it is one of the last beers as far as mexican beers goes that I would pick as last. I do not drink this beer on a regualar basis, but I would rather have a beer that is not lite like this one."
"Drinkability: probably one of the worst beers I have had and actually reviewed. No flavor especially with no lime in the glass. There are some lite beers with at least some flavor on the market."
"I actually like the lighter version of Corona better than the regular... Taste is slightly better in my opinion and goes down a lot smoother... taste is crisp and clean that was well accentuated with a lime on a hot summer day... wouldn't mind kicking back on the beach with one of these enjoying a hot day in the sand... Although I wouldn't run out to buy a sixer, wouldn't turn this one down if I was offered... find it ridiculous that some bars or nightclubs can actually charge $6 a bottle on a Saturday night... This is a good social brew... cop a twelve-pack and entertain some guests, but nothing exotic or over the top... Overall, not a bad beer..."
"drinkability - Light, easy drinking beer, because its like water."
"My last review was on hot summer day and it was fine, in fact at the moment I couldn't think of a beer I'd rather have. Yeaterday, a relatively cool day, it didn't hit the spot as closly as before but it wasn't bad at all, it was a damn good thirst quencher but not nearly as nice as the Hoegaarden I followed it with."
"Very bright yellow with golden touch in the color. Smell is less skunky that its big brother, but just because this is a little bit lighter beer. Taste is OK, like corona extra, but a bit watered down. Not bad. Mouth is carbonated highly and leaves a tingle on your tongue. Drinkable beer and not bad at all."
"This beer, just like Corona Extra, is undrinkable without a lime. The clear urine color with a short white head is not very appealing and reminds me of when you get a drug test and have to pee in a cup. The aroma is always skunked. It just smells of sour and skunk. The taste is no better with the taste of really skunked beer. The first time I had it, I thought it was just the one, but then after a few more tries, it turns out it is just the same. Why people like this I will never understand. Don't try it, not worth your money."
"Good summer beer for BBQing especially, but that is about all it has going for it"
"Bleagh, half the bottle finished. I can pour the rest out."
"From notes: I poured this beverage into a pint glass and was startled at its clarity. It is remarkably transparent with no head formation and active carbonation being the predominant character. The nose is quite assertive with strong suggestions of butene thiol followed by an arrangement of white corn mash and the ocean. I found the mouthfeel to be loose and flowing with no real changes in viscosity on any particular sector of my palate. As light as this beer is, plenty of exotic flavors of vegetables and processed wood products are present. In my humble opinion, this particular beer could improve from an adjustment in the malts and perhaps a brewing and packaging process that could better protect from UV light exposure. However, for those who do enjoy the extra flavor imparted from light, this would be a recommended lower alcohol, lower calorie lager."
"As much as I would like to avoid Corona Special, I would much rather stay out of the way of this beer. Typically flat with a bland taste, no head/lacing, and an aroma I wouldn't even list as a 'ball park beer.' If you're worried about having a 'light' beer, try a standard American pilsner. If you want south of the border, go for the Negro Modelo. Same company and so much better."
"But do we have to respect it if it doesn't respect us?"
"Notes : Is there just one clear bottle beer that is good?"
"Ugh."
"Light, somewhat skunky aroma. Light yellow color. Taste is really bad. Makes me wanna vomit. Hate to give a beer a bad review but I honestly don't see how anyone can enjoy this crap. Now I see why the lemon is always involved. You can't possibly make this crap taste good though."
"D: While being very close to its ""full caloried"" brethren, it is a pretty drinkable beer. But, despite its easy-going nature, I did not really like the beer as a whole."
"Final Statment: I tried this for one simple reason, I wanted to see how it was possible to take out more beer flavour than regular Corona. I mean, isn't regular Corona itself a ""light"" beer? Give me a break. People who drink this should be put on their own planet."
" I really only decided to review it straight up so you can be prepared when limes and lemons go extinct. Your welcome."
"We need to drink beers like this to keep our perspective. And as a lesson on why clear glass containers are dumb ideas for beer. Poured with a very short lived white head. No lace. Bright yellow. Highly carbonated. Aroma is hugely bitter, but only a little from hops. This is certainly light struck. Very thin. The bitterness from the struck quality lingers much too long. Headache in a bottle, I'm sure."
"¡Salud!"
"This brewer is keeping the lime growers in business!"
"D - Thirst quenching on a hot Mexican beach. But so is water."
"This beers for you, my pea-brained beauty."
"D: Way over priced, way over hyped. This is a beer that struggles to be average."
"D - I'm not going to blast this beer. It's decent ... with a lime ... on a hot day ... in college. Extremely overpriced. Makes you resent paying for someone's marketing degree."
"hey...wanna look like you're drinking a ""premium imported beer"" at the meat market dance club? wanna save some calories? wanna be cool? drink corona light! it's like tasteless corona, but even more so! thank god for modern science! i didn't think this was possible! plus, the bartender will put a lime wedge in your bottle. hey, you look cool, don't ya! man, now you're living. feliz navidad, bitches!"
"D - Slightly above Mich Ultra in terms of flavor, but is severely lacking in beer-like qualities."
"Simply not a quality brew. This one should only be used to wash down something spicy but non flavorful. A decent beer on a super hot day to appease your thirst, but not to be recommended for much else."
"Aftertaste is mildly astringent, which is discomforting as there is almost no flavor to begin with. It's a little bit like drinking coffee through pre-brewed grounds; there's some 'beer' characteristics but it's not the real thing. These are among the lowest scores I've ever doled out in a review."
"overall this is not a very good beer and i will not get it again"
"little bitter and less blonde than the extra, good for womens and gringos, a novelty in my city, this beer is only for the us market and now in the mountains city; try with mexican food, poor in a pint glass, god for this season 6 or 10 for the thirst, 3° degrees is the perfect temperature; drinkability over the average; i recommend 65%."
"12 oz. bottle- color of straw yellow , with a minimal white head  faint nose of skunk , bubblegum , yellow sweet corn , slight oatie-ness , and metallic  taste of lime zest (the bad kind) , watery , sweet corn , and sour funk - body is watery , acidic , abrasive , and with medium carbonation aftertaste of abrasive lime peel , and a horrible bitterness"
"Ok, really this is the lat macro review for the night, two in one night was bad enough. Pours a light yellow with a big fizzy head that fades away immediatly leaving essentially yellow seltzer. Smell is bjust not good. Smells very musty and almost moldy breadish. The taste was not much better. I skipped out on the lime, in retrospect probably should have taken one. Big carbonation and really light texture made it go down like water, cold water, when it warmed, wow, that was just not cool. Overall why am I doing this? Oh yeah to better appreciate my good brew in a day or two."
"I would recommend this beer only with the lime and do not pour it in a glass! It needs to filter through the lime as it does in the bottle. I have said this beofre, but it is true, not as good as Corona Extra!"
"Skunky aroma, hits you right when you pop the top. What can I say? This is already a very light beer and this is the lighter version. Some grainy flavors but there really isnt much there. There isnt even any lively carbonation. Thin, light and unpleasant. A lime would help."
"Why bother. Have a water with lime."
"Sorry, but I don't have too much productive criticism. There really isnt any need to buy a light version of Corona. Chances are if youre drinking any Corona, youre gulping it in between breaths as you inhale a 3,000 calorie burrito. Bottom line, suck up the extra couple calories and get the Corona Extra. Your tongue will thank you."
"- Backdated tasting (correction of beer name): I tried this beer on 29AUG03, but incorrectly reviewed it as ""Corona Extra"". My review of Corona Extra has been corrected to reflect my actual first tasting of that beer, which took place in August 2006. -"
"Adding a lime wedge is a common practice with Corona and there is a good reason for this: It adds some flavor to this weak, lifeless product. Corona Lights only redeeming quality might be the fact that it is easy to drink and thirst quenching. Its watery body makes it this way and other than accepting a free bottle from a friend, I cannot think of any reason to drink Corona Light. It is one of lamest beer products on the market today."
"D- This beer had very little characteristics of beer with no malt flavor and no hop depth. It was not offensive just bland and fizzy."
"This is a light beer but not as watery tasting as american light beers and the lime and salt make it something a little special."
"Nothing impressive about this beer at all, except that it's as drinkable as a bottle of water. I guess a really cold one would help you cool off on a hot day, but I can think of plenty of other beers that would also do that while tasting like something."
"This stuff actually goes down pretty easily, but there's absolutely nothing about it to make you want to drink another one. There's better light beers out there than this..."
"Corona Light pours a pale yellow with a white head from a clear twelve ounce bottle. Smells like fizzy, yellow beer, adjunct in other words. Not much to the taste, corn, and a somewhat tart finish. Some skunk is also noticeable. Lime optional (review is no lime)."
"This is truly the lightest flavored beer I have ever tasted. Believe it or not, I actually gave it a very fair shot, poured in into a glass (it was purchased fresh), no lime. The beer pours a very thin, urine looking color. The smell and taste are almost nonexistent. The only thing I really taste in this brew is a slight grain with a little carbonation. Absolutely no hops, malt, or anything else you look for in a beer exists. The only thing I taste w/o the lime is a very sour, bitter taste that is not pleasant. I really don't understand what the heck the point of brewing a light version of Corona there is. The regular Corona is already very light as it is. That said, on a typical hot summer's day in Texas, with at least two limes stuffed inside, and if the beer is ICE cold, it might actually be decent to wash down some chips and salsa. Other than that, avoid. If you want a decent tasting, refreshing Mexican brew that is still light, try Modelo Especial."
"This beer is piss. I think some mexican pissed in a bottle and then sold it as beer. This is gross shit. DO NOT DRINK IT UNLESS YOU SUCK AT LIFE!!!!"
" Eric"
"Medium piss yellow with a medium-large, white, fizzy, soda-like, rapidly diminishing head. The smell is of rather unpleasant cooked vegetables and lightly sweet grainy malt. More of the same in the taste except a little more corny and a touch of citrus. The mouthfeel (blech!) Is not good at all. Thin in so meany ways and bitter & chalky in all the wrong ways. Wow does this beer suck. I can totally understand why its served with lime, since it needs something to cover up its nasty taste. Yes, there are cheapos out there that are as bad or worse than this beer, but charging what they do around here for this stuff is just disgraceful! Avoid! Avoid! Avoid!"
"Drinkability - Absolutely terrible. And this is a relatively high priced beer."
"Pours out to a straw yellow with no head. There are large bubbles that hug the side of the glass under the beer. Has the consistency of a soda. The smell is rather faint of cheap grain. Can't smell any of the hops. The largest contributor to the smell is the smell of the alcohol. The taste is very bland, with almost no hint of grain, though there is a faint aftertaste of hops. It tastes like hops flavored water. The carbonation is enough to keep the mouthfeel from being utterly boring, but even then, it comes out very watery. This is not a very drinkable beer as it comes somewhere in between beer and water. I would like to have one or the other, not a mix of both."
"pours out of the clear bottle a very bright straw yellow colour....extremely carbonated producing that infamous ""fizzy yellow"" beer effect. not much head or lace...just a bit for looks. the light euro skunk aroma gives way to a ghostly hint of graininess. not much there. the flavour is almost nonexistent...really...grainy flavoured water is about the best i can come up with. granted the mouthfeel is pretty velvety smooth behind the watery mouthfeel....but man this has to be the lightest tasting light beer on the planet. i can see why a lime is probably going to do this beer some good for those who chose to drink it that way. i'm thankful only one bottle was left for me to sample. but god did we have a hell of a party..."
"Not much of a nose to this which I thank the gods for. The taste is reminiscent of a late night college fraternity party. I would stay away from this beer unless you were stranded on a deserted island without any water in sight and then I still might think about it."
"drinkability: I guess it is easy to drink, but I have no reason to want to."
"for joe schmo...this might work..but for those who are looking for some flavor...not your cup of tea...get a Negra Modello instead."
"Skunky water very light pee yellow, no malt flavor like its regular counterpart. no hops no real nothin, better that bud lite but not much. If its real real cold it will quench your thirst. If this were the only beer available I would always be the designated driver."
"Overall Corona is not ultra horrible. I dont care for limes in my beer but it can help mask the skunkiness. There are a lot of options out there in this cerveza style beers, that taste better and are less expensive. Props to the marketing genuises over there though for turning a not so great product into millions of dollars, you have to admire and hate that all at the same time."
"Drinkability - Avoid at all costs."
"Fizzy mouthfeel that reminds me of seltzer water. Adjunct special with hints of corn, grains and rice cakes. This feels watery and too thin on the palate. Because this beer is so light and airy, it's thirst quenching. It's the just the quality part of the beer that needs some work."
"Corona Light failed to win the crown in Macro Smackdown VII and thereby betrayed its very name. Really, though, the only one betrayed in this entire sorry mess is me. So ends another exercise in endurance and palate abuse. No wonder the length of time between MacSmacks is getting longer and longer."
"Pours a crystal clear straw color. Fizzy one finger head forms and quickly dies out over an abundance of streaming carbonation. Thin cap of foam remains intact for a while but produces only specs of lacing. Light struck aroma, otherwise very clean. Tastes like more rice and corn are used to ferment than malted barley. Little to no hops present, and while the adjuncts used give a faux-sweetness and sour bitterness- they do not balance out the flavor. Highly carbonated and light-bodied, but the adjunct flavor an skunk taste destroy any chance of a clean mouthfeel or decent drinkability. Finish is harsh with astringency. Thin, watery flavor may appeal to a higher climate, but the taste is to light even for the style."
"The beer pours a pale translucent gold with a frothy white head that suprisingly held and laced a little. The Corn in this beer smells stronger than in the regular version but it tastes exactly like the regular version has been watered down. The carbonation i this one feels less harsh than in the regular version which is nice. Overal it is pretty easy to drink when you consider what it is."
"Drinkability: This is as light as a feather, so you could suck about a million of them down in an hour if you wanted to. But who the hell would want to? Blah. Actually, if it's cold enough, this is pretty refreshing, especially with a lime in it."
"I'm all for supporting the little guy and independent companies, but when it comes to a really light refreshing beer I haven't found anything that compares to one of these. I'll keep looking."
"Enough said. I couldn't finish this bottle if I tried."
"Keep the lime and pour the beer out."
"Not worth anyones time unless you have a lime grove in your backyard and you arent making money from said limes."
"Notes: Honestly, I don't know why I decided to try and review this beer. First I thought, just for kicks, it can't be that bad (from all reviews I read), but this BREW really pissed me off."
"Ignore this beer. Even regular Corona is miles above it."
"At a recent party I was greeted with a cooler of alcopops and corona light. I assume that I chose the lesser of two evils. Corona Light is barely a beerlight and watery, thin, very fizzy head. No aroma. Literally no tasteGood spring water has as much character. I suppose it was better than the alcohol flavored kool-aid, but its not much of a beer. There's actually quite a few NA beers that I've enjoyed more than this."
"Want a light mexican beer that you can buy for a cheap price in any store, buy Corona light. Put a lime in it and drink it fast. Very little smell, very little head, very little taste. The taste is plain and simple, maybe slight corn or other slight grains, but nothing too impressive."
"it's bitter without flavor, without aftertaste except for the taste of tinfoil. atrocious.. i'll take coors or sam adams light over this any day. this has no redeeming value other than to get you drunk."
"Drinkability - Now this is where it comes in handy. If you wanna get drunk semi-quick, go for it. At only around 3% alcohol though, where's the point? You might as well be drinking a 40 of cheap malt liquor."
"Dont get me wrong, this beer does not stand out as a great beer, but amongst its peers, it fairs quite well."
"Not so good, Al."
"It's like corona, but lighter, and less flavour. Yes, that's right, less flavour. Skunked, grainy, astringent and nasty. Watery taste, but a crisp and clean mouthfeel. Don't really see the point of making a Corona Light, but what the heck. Horrible beer, ok soda."
"General comments: General availability and low carbs would make this a ""common beer"". To hold this beer to the same criteria of a Trappist Westvleteren or a Stone Russian Stout would be like comparing a Yugo with a '69 Mustang. For a ""social drinking beer"" turning one's nose up because it is a ""just a Corona"" would be like needing a ride, and refusing one from a Yugo in lieu of waiting on the '69 Mustang to drive by to pick you up with a 25 year-old female blond in the drivers seat."
"The color of it is nice, but that's really the only positive thing I can say about it."
"Pours a clear urine-yellow, with a pathetic thin soapy head that dissolves like a cider. 'Aroma' of faint hops, dish soap, a skunk, quite unpleasent. Taste, hmmm... not as bad as I was expecting... but still very bad. Watery hops, slight apples, club soda, even some alcohol burn, which at 3.8% is ridiculous. This has a thin, watery, aggressively fizzy mouthfeel that has to be tasted to be believed. If I wanted another one of these, I'd just piss in a glass and chill it. I'm sure my urine has a higher ABV than this anyways..."
"What a disgrace of a beer. Takes all of the corny skunk off flavors of a bottle of corona, and somehow waters it down. Did I put fruit in it? Hell no, I'll save that for next time i make jello. Why would you buy it? For the Taste? There are cheaper beers that are 10x better. Image? Probably, you psuedo-beer knurd."
"Overall-like Corona, only even more watery and bland, and therefore worse. No reason at all to drink such a beer, as with Corona, any beer that needs flavor added is not a good beer, especially if that beer happens to be ""Light"" this beer makes Bud Light look heavenly."
"This would be a good outside beer, as it quenches a thirst quite nicely, but unfortunately, at $12-$13 at the grocery store ($9 at my Total Wine), it's a bit pricy. That's the biggest offense, the price. This is nowhere near as bad as some would have you think, but it's not worth what they charge for it. If you want the same thing out of a cheap light beer, High Life Light isn't awful, and if you want good Mexican beer, pick up some Dos Equis or Negra Modelo."
"I had some of this at the end of a party at a friends house, at least the guy used to be a friend until he served me this crap. I wasn't ready to let the night end and I wanted another drink, in retrospect I should have checked the cabinet in the bathroom for a bottle of Listerine. This beer has absolutely no redeeming qualities to it. Usually thin beers are at least easy to drink, but this stuff makes bile climb up your throat. I choose sobriety over this muck."
"Consumed in October 2004 in Cancun, Mexico from a bottle. Blech!!! I tried two of these just to make sure the first wasn't as bad as I thought it was. Poured a light straw yellow with no head or straw. At first it tasted like regular Corona. But after the taste settled in...UGH! Drank it quickly and had another just to make sure my taste buds were responding properly. Same deal. Maybe a paint thinner taste too it? Pretty watery too. Tough to finish. Geez, am I glad I couldn't find Tecate Light."
"My recommendation: Don't drink this beer unless you're smashed and probably won't rememeber doing so in the morning. It is totally incomprehensible to me that people are throwing down 12-13 bucks for a 12 pack of these urine bottles."
"Bottle: Poured what must be the lightest yellow corn lager in the world without any head and a strong skunky aroma. Wow, truly one of the worst beer I had the misfortune of drinking and let me tell you that I had my fair share of bad experience. No much more that I can say about this"
"Holy %$#@*!!! I had just suffered through a Silver Bullet at a low budget party and thought the only thing worse was a Mick Ultra. When the bullets were gone the Corona Light was unleashed. Dear God! No wonder the Mexicans are flocking to America. Can anyone tell me what the hell is in those bottles. Carbonated urine? No quality control at the Corona brewery. That's because there's no quality anything in a Corona Light to begin with. There is no hint of beer at all. It just tastes like fizzy polluted water. And why Light? A regular Corona already tastes like piss. This is one really shitty brew that doesn't even deserve this review. It's awful."
"Somehow, I can handle this beer. I'll never use my own money on it but some friends seem to have it as their only option on a regular basis. It doesn't have much of anything to it. It doesn't taste horrible but it is way too watered down, which is probably good. If someone offers it to you, it won't make you retch like a Coors or something, but it won't satisfy much, either."
"Drinkability: It will be a long time before I have another; its been a long time since I've had one and I was just curious to see how it stacks up."
"My first 1.0 beer. I use the term beer loosely because other than the bottle, this bears no relationship to beer, even regular Corona. If you put a lime in it, you have lime water. Otherwise, there is no discernible beer aroma or taste. It isn't water though either, which you might want to drink on a hot day. This is just weak, adulterated water with some hint of an off taste that is not good. I drank this so as not to insult a friend. Never, ever again."
"This is the most tasteless beer I have ever tasted. It poured a light yellow. It is impossible to articulate what it tasted or smelled like, because neither of these qualities was present. I will never buy this beer, because for the same price, I could purchase a pretty good beer like a SNPA or one of the good micro-brewed beers of New England."
"Pale pale yellow with sizzling carbonation that amounts to no head or lacing. Small vegetal citrus aroma is so faint that I accidentally stuck my nose in the beer trying to smell something. A taste starts with a harsh bite of carbonation, a garbage tea runs thinly over the tongue, quickly turning astringent and finishing with an empty sugar-substitute type sweetness. Actually painful to drink because of its harshness and horrible finish. It is beers like this that give beer a bad name. Shame, shame."
"Now it was drinkable enough for a cheap lager, but stood up as a lesson in contrast. Does the ""Light"" mean you're light in the head or in the wallet to buy this stuff? I could list a couple of similar-priced macro-brewed beers better than this rancid tap water."
"Every time I drink this stuff I swear it will be the last time. To say it is bad is an understatement. this beer tastes like watered down urine. With no disrespect to Mexico, they say don't drink the water there, this beer is brewed there, do you think they import bottled water to brew? the alcohol content is the only think keeping people from dying from food poisoning."
"It's more like what happens when a mexican drinks a fifth of cheap tequila and pisses in a bottle. There you have it. I have unlocked the secret to how Corona and Corona Light is made."
"My wife had one too. She looked at me and wordlessly dumped hers down the drain. Mine quickly joined its mate. Corona Light is an unmitigated drain pour, pure and simple. If anyone ever sees me putting one to my lips again, wake me up. If I'm awake, you have my permission to belt my upside my head for my transgression."
"...for sheer bland neutrality it's a hit!"
"Wow, this is not that bad for what it is. The colour is ""piss-yellow"" and if you pour this stuff into a glass (not recommended) the head is a light white colour that dies super fast. The aromas are of corn pops, stale lightly bready malts, and slight citrius-like hops. The taste is not that bad, especially when you add the ""lime"" into the bottle. Actually this beer is so flavorless, and water-like, that 5 or 6 limes are needed to get the job done. The taste is of slightly sweet lime water, with a hint of lightly grainy malts and citrus-like hops in the background. The mouthfeel is watery, so if it is a hot day out, and you are sweating, this stuff may rehydrate you. The drinkability is definately good as far as these flavorless light beers go, and even though I am not a big fan of this style of beer, this is a good example of the style, as it is a very light lager, with little flavor, that you can quaff for extended periods of time..."
"This beer is like a bad dream, more expensive than Guinness and tastes worse than a bottle of warm piss. There can be no justification for drinking this crap. If you want a watered down beer, grab a Coors Light for half the price. If you want to spend $14+ on a twelve pack, grab some Sam Adams. If you need to stick a lime in your bottle to enjoy beer, hike up your panties and go grab a coke. And lastly, if for some reason unbeknownst to normal people you like drinking crappy, piss beer, at least drink crappy, AMERICAN piss beer. Go grab a 30 pack of Milwaukee's Best for $9.49, that's the American way."
"Easter, see my friend's nephew come walking in with a six pack of Mackeson Stout. Pretty cool. Upon handing it over, I see that it is a six pack of corona light. Seems that someone gave him this six pack and he just waited to be able to pass it off on someone, which was me. Put it in the fridge figuring one of my Bud luving friends would drink it. Fast forward two nights later, eating chips/salsa, figured that a Double Bastard would not go to good with the salsa, I popped a CL. How bad it could it be I thought. I drank warm Utica Clubs after two nights with the Grateful Dead, this can't be that bad. Man was I wrong. This stuff is the worst. Words can't explain how bad this is. Two sips and it was tossed."
"This beer, in my humble opinion, is hot garbage. Pours a piss yellow, almost indistinguishable from water, with an extremely light, quick disappearing head. Smell is of skunked beer. In regards to taste, where is the beer? Tastes like water. No hops taste, extremely light, almost non existent malt. Garbage."
"ok so yea, i drank some of this at a party. i know i know, blasphemy, but whatever, no matter how high my beer ego is, i will never deny a free beer, no matter how bad it is. this shit pours out pale yellow, clear and crappy with a bad head. smells of cheapness...skunky and corny. in the mouth it is thin, but crisp and when ice cold it is somewhat refreshing. on the tastebuds? corny. ive never had a beer with such a huge corn flavor. like drinking corn flakes. no hops at all so basically your in for a watered down one dimensional corn show. drinkable? yes, in the way that water or something underwhelming and flavorless is drinkable. just dont think of it as a beer, but more a less a palate cleanser."
"Not drinkable by a longshot, a definite pour and brush my teeth beer."
"I've been avoiding this beer for years . . . but I was in the hottub, and this was what was in the cooler. Bottled in a clear bottle, so that you can appreciate how nearly colorless this beer is. Aroma and flavor - corn malt and skunk. Adding a wedge of lime resulted in limey skunk, perhaps a slight improvement. Momma always said ""if you can't say something nice, then don't say anything at all."" So here goes: it makes regular Corona look good."
"This is hands down the worst beer I have ever laid my hands on. Almost pours watery with hints of yellow. Is this water mixed with lime, no that would be to good. The smell is of slight skunk and nothing else present. Taste is downright awful, water is better than this, and water is flavorless. Feels of course dull and flat in the mouth. Drinkable if you like water, but even then just drink water. How this is even on the market is amazing to me, Corona is ten times better than the light version, but that in itself isn't to impressive as Corona is below average as well."
"Not actively horrible, but not much point to it either. How the heck did I end up drinking this anyway? Be careful who you hang out with, I guess."
"This is a joke. Had one of these a few weeks ago just to prove a point to someone. This is by far the lamest excuse for beer I have ever had in my life. Regular Corona is a joke in itself, but this is not even right. Ths beer has nothing to speak of...NOTHING. No flavor, no color, no redeeming qualities whatsoever. $25 per case for this? I'll piss in your cup for free, and you may taste some actual beer in that. Do not drink this ever."
"It has more or less the same quality of corona extra, but with a definite hole in the flavor like the forgot one thing. Not like most lite beers witch taste like watered down versions of themselves. this beer was definitely missing some key thing what was it I cant really put my finger on it maybe I will never know!!"
"Had this at the same party as had the Corona for my Corona review. I figured why not go all the way down to the dregs.. well i did. Corona Light is to Corona as tang is to orange juice. How this is even made is beyond me.. The colour is actually a little lighter than the beyond pale corona. The smell some how manages to include, metal, rotting vegetables, sulfer, and chemical cleanser. Yummy. The taste is blech!!!! Watery, with an aftertaste that makes you want to scrap your tongue. Maybe they eat such hot peppers in Mexico to numb the tongue for this stuff. The mouthfeel is nasty and the drinkablity is half a bottle, I had to do a Tequila shot just to rid my mouth of the taste. It is amazing to me that this beer and its brother Corona. Are the Number ONE selling imports in America..A store i go to sells 250 cases yes cases every 2 weeks. If Shaefer is the beer to have when you are having more than one, this stuff is the beer to have if you want less than one."
"I feel as if I should laugh while drinking this. ""Hahahahahaha! They call this beer? Hahahahahahaha! This is not beer."" Pretty much, Corona Extra with 80 gallons more water added in the mash. Pale, pale yellow colour with a few bubbles. By a few bubbles, I mean 27. Yes, I counted. This is the closest thing I got for a head with this nonbeer beer. No smell. Unless you consider water a scent. Then it has a Lake Ontario smell. Very watery, with pollution. No taste. At least the Extra had taste, though it was a skunked taste. This has nothing. Tap water mouthfeel. Drinkable like water. I actually gave it higher points than the Extra. I had one bottle that wasn't skunked, and that's what I used to rate. Since the bottle wasn't skunked, I could actually drink it!!! But that was luck. I got a good(relatively speaking) bottle and that's what I used to rate. If that bottle was like the rest, the score would be a straight one."
"My dad brought two of these over, can't say I know why. I didn't notice any skunkiness, that's probably a good sign. The lightest light beer I've seen, a little sweet. I wish I could try this with a lime, maybe that would make it even better. A little expensive, but better tasting than it's cheaper light beer counterparts."
"A fizzy very light fizzy beer. No head. Aroma is slightly skunky malts. Very light flavor, there is a very very slight maltyness. No noticeable hops. But even thought it has little or no flavor, at least what is there is not offensive. Sort of like water with some malts and alcohol. About all one can say. Mouthfeel is thin. Finish is neutral. Aftertaste is very slightly bitter. Also pissed that this stuff cost some larrge frelling $$."
"Despite the fact it's like drinking water, it's actually not too bad. There aren't really any off flavors that make this beer a turn off. It just doesn't have any flavor. Toss a lime in it, kick back on a beach and this could be a nice thirst quenching substitute to water."
"Yuck! This ""beer"" is so thin I find it hard to call it a beer. The color is so light you can read a book through it. The aroma reminds me of nothing: it is nothing. Suprisingly, even less taste than Corona. I can't believe that I had this at a friends house who thought he was buying good beer. Ah, the power of advertising!"
"Bottle. As much as I had heard about this beer I was absolutely not impressed with it at all. I am not sure what all the hype is when it comes to this beer. It had an aftertaste to it that I did not enjoy and it definitely lingered for quite some time. It was watery and fizzy. For me, this definitely was not an enjoyable drink."
"How can they have a Corona LIGHT? Isn't Corono Extra weak enough. I think they used sewer water from Mexico to make this beer. Has a corn smell and taste to it. Sick! A lime definitely needs to be added to mask these horrible flavors. It still doesn't taste tolerable, even with the lime. Life is too short to drink crap like this."
"The lime makes this beer slightly more drinkable, but it does less for this beer than it does Corona Extra, for some reason. It's scary that this beer can make Extra look somewhat good. All I can say is: stay away."
"corona light. LIGHT? is this really necessary? is corona extra really too heavy a beer? this is beer is honestly the closest thing that i have tasted to water that is not the actual thing. pours an ever so light piss yellow. no head. no smell. no real flavour unless you dump a lime in there. sadly, because there are no real characteristics to this brew, the drinkability rating goes up as it truly is like drinking water."
"Served in a clear glass 12 oz. bottle, this beer pours light piss yellow in color. Smells like a skunked beer. Taste like a skunked beer. Hum, must be a skunked beer. I don't like and don't really want to have. I wish my girlfriend didn't like it."
" I would have rated this lower but there is a beer I have had that is actually worse but I paid half as much for it as this costs."
"The only thing I like about this review is the glass that I am drinking it out of."
"Pours a pale golden color with minimal head. Soon after the pour, there is no visible signs of carbonation outide of the few rather large bubbles on the bottom of the glass. The aroma is a bit of corn with a wisp of alcohol and some fresh-mown grass notes. The taste is light and grainy, with a touch of salt. Finish is a hint of bitterness inside a metallic note. The aftertatse is almost non-existent. the mouthfeel is very thin and watery, yet hearsh from the large bubbles of carbonation. The drinkability is poor, as it doesn't taste great and it is pretty harsh on the tongue. Uh, thanks for this one Bill."
"Pours a clear straw golden color with a small white head that quickly and utterly vanishes, no lace to speak of, lots of spritzy carbonation. Aroma of sweet corn as well as some skunkiness, no doubt due to the clear glass bottle. Taste begins with sharp, stinging carbonation of the sort found in seltzer water, followed by weak sour malt, finishes very dry and with a metallic hop bitterness. Mouthfeel is coarse and somewhat harsh. This is not a beer that I plan on having again. Caveat emptor."
"I tried this with hesitation, and after tasting it, the hesitation was justified. Poured like yellow water. The taste is watered down and weak. What taste is there is just bad. There is a lingering aftertaste. I won't touch this again even if it's free."
"What's worse than a corona? Corona light. When I first saw this around a few years ago I couldn't believe it. How does one water down a corona more? A better question would be: why? If you don't load up this beer with limes, you won't be able to drink it. I certainly was not."
"(source: A friend of a friend left at our house.)"
"Appearance: Pours a clear, bright, straw/golden color with very little patches of white lace. On the nose the aroma of light sweetness and grain. On the palate the flavors consisted of light grainy husky flavors, light mild bitterness and on a good note it was crisp and quenches your thirst. Light bodied and mouthfeel is dry and slightly tingly. Really just not interesting at all, and usually skunked. This was sadly a left-over in my fridge that someone had brought over."
"Truly awful. The Corona Extra was bad enough, but to water it down even further?? Yuck! My wife likes these better than Corona Extra so I actually have to buy them. Skunky smell, no taste, feels like soda water in my mouth. Just plain not drinkable for me."
"A month ago i saw Corona light and knowing that the ""light"" beers are always worst than the ""original"" beers i hesitated to taste it. Finally when i tasted it i was quite satisfied due to the fact that now i'll know what beer to vote for the ""worst beer in the world"" title."
"I now have the rather unpleasant distinction of having tried every beer in the ""Corona"" family, and my life is not really the better for it. This is easily the worst of the bunch, and you could not squeeze enough limes in the bottle to get me to try it again. There are absolutely no redeeming qualities in this beer (and I use the term lightly). The only positive thing I could possibly say about Corona Light is that it is not Bud Light."
"If not for the sulfur, this beer would have little else in the way of taste to offer anyone."
"As everyone else has mentioned, watered down is the flavor.  Very light golden color, hinting at no flavor.  The carbonation is of the forced air variety, not true carbonation.  The lime is a necessity.  The corona extra has much more flavor."
"Just avoid Corona at all costs, move on to any number of better beers."
"This beer is just water that looks like beer. Very faint flavors of corn graininess. Moderate carbonation. I guess it's better than drinking the water in mexico. Does go down smoothly though. If it was 100 degrees and I was stupid enough to drink an alcoholic beverage, I would consider this.  Only slightly drinkable because of its similarity to water."
"As close to non-beer or water as possible.  You'd be better off drinking a hay-water mix to get your hay fever rockin.  This beer did absolutely nothing for me.   Since I like water, but love beer, I generously rate this concoction a 1.5..."
"What kind of anorexic, psychopath thought up this beer?  Why would a beer that is so lacking in body, taste, and quality put out a LIGHT beer: the original beer is a light beer.  This “beer” is an insult to water, and a waste of corn. Terrible, twice terrible.  Hell, you have to add a lime to it just to make it awful; “as with all in this line of” panther piss.  If you catch me with one of these again, please take me out of my misery: maybe a fan of this beer can make me a lethal cocktail of Henie and Lowenbrau."
"Corna Light is almost the same as Corona Extra. It's easy to drink but forgettable, only worse because it's more watered down."
"My ex-boss' yuppie wife brings this to parties, stuffs a lime wedge in its neck, and sings its praises 'til the end of the earth. That's fine - saves me the cost of hiring a clown to entertain the kids. At least she has the courtesy to finish the damned things up before she leaves."
"I am thoroughly convinced that this is one of the worst tasting beers that you can buy.  Smells skunked (what a surprise!).  Tastes skunked and isn't really even palatable.  Any beer that needs a lime to mask the flavor is seriously struggling.  I would rather drink just about anything than drink this."
