One day I ran out of beer, I say beer cause Heineken light is NOT beer, anyway I ran out of real beer & had to drink one of these. I can not believe Heineken sells this junk. This is the worst beer I ever had, tastes like water with a 3. Abv? I compare this to boxed wine, it's horrible. No hope at all, no flavor at all, you might as well drink carbonated water because Heineken light is only carbonated water has no flavor no alcohol completely and absolutely the worst beer I ever drank in my life!!","Marleypoo","Jan 25, 2015"

Being that it was scorching hot, she wanted to buy a 12 pack of Heineken for the week because it was cheap. I reluctantly agreed. She went inside the store and mistakenly bought Heineken Light. (She must have been in a rush) When we got back home we noticed this and drove back to the liquor store to exchange it. The bad news was that in Delaware it is state law that all alcohol purchases are non refundable/exchangeable.Long story short, we got stuck with Heineken Light all week. What else to say about this beer? It is watery and devoid of flavor. Never again!","Gajo74","Dec 14, 2014"

The taste is really hoppy too, and light. Not really light on flavor, as it still has plenty of hoppy flavor and a hint of malt. Don't know why this is rated so bad. This honestly i have had 5 with barbecue chicken, and i am not really drunk or full. 3.3% ABV makes this perfect for me. Perfect session beer. The reason i liked coors was the fact it was  low in alcohol and didnt fill me up. this does the same thing while retaining a good amount of flavor.

Lots of bubbles rising from the bottom and sides of the glass due to the above average carbonation.

The flavor is a light bready grainy maltiness with a hint of hop bitterness and again a bit of mercaptan. Light body with a spritzy level of carbonation and a slick watery mouthfeel. I can't get away from the skunky aroma to find much to like about this beer, probably a poor example to be a classic style imho.","johnnnniee","Sep 29, 2013"

I can get behind this a little bit, also seems to be handled better than the regular, which eliminated the skunky odor and taste I associate with the parent beer here.","StonedTrippin","Aug 13, 2013"

Nose and taste are both super skunky, sharp and pungent, with some grainy malt and a hint of flowery hops underneath. Some adjunct taste of cereal grains or rice, perhaps. But it’s that classic green bottle Heinie skunk all the way that dominates. Light bodied with ample carbonation and a crisp and refreshing mouthfeel. Super drinkable if you like drinking skunk flavored, watery beverages. Something about the skunkiness ignites a wave of nostalgia in me, bringing me back to my youthful experiences with lousy euro lagers, so I don’t hate this as much as most, but I still wouldn’t buy it..or drink it again. On offer at a barbeque so I gave it a shot. Still not the worst of the worst.","tobelerone","Jun 11, 2012"

Appears a light golden pale hue with a bright white head leaves behind nice scattered lacing. Aroma has more skunky Euro hops sorry folks those are the facts on this beer they promote a nice skuny grassy hop character with a minimal citrus profile just enjoy and now your enjoying something high end, right? Taste has lighter crisp version of Heineken I could see this going over here with crisp hop character it finishes a tad bitter for American flavor but it's actually not that bad grassy citrus hop profile with light creamy biscuit malt tones go figure. Mouthfeel as the label reveals it's light bodied higher artificial carbonation not the end of the world. Drinkability well not that bad I could crave this in another life possibly, but once again pretty unoffensive what can I say.","WVbeergeek","Jun 21, 2006"

I suppose the Heineken drinker who is looking for something light would like this. This bottle was left at my house, and I can't see myself ever buying it as I like fuller flavored beers. But if someone is looking for a brew that is clean and crisp, leaves no lingering taste on the palate, then this is probably it.","LarryV","Jun 19, 2006"

I would say that it is a lot like a Coors Light. They have some really good commercials on TV but I did not like my sample that I tatsed at the World Beer Festival in Raleigh, NC April 2006. If you like Heineken, stick with the regular and skip the premium light.","matracy68","May 27, 2006"
3.2,37.9,2.5,2.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Doesn't taste like Heineken. Fairly bland lager taste. The mouthfeel is richer than most light beers I have tried. I certainly wouldn't look for if, but it is about on par with Miller Lite, if you are out there with a very limited selection of watery, bland beers. Appearance is less than average, the ubiquitous yellow lager color, small head that fades quickly, little smell, almost no lacing. I would like to try one without the cryogenically frosted beer mug I was given, but I'm sure the flavor would not be that much better in a non-frosted glass. Ok for a session if you are counting calories and there is nothing memorable to tempt you with.","JayQue","May 19, 2006"
2.31,-0.4,1.5,3,2.5,2,1.5,"Had this from some family who came with it. Pours increadibly light colored and a small fizzy head that really fades quickly. Not really too carbonated. Smell has that floral medicinal quality I associate with regular Heineken but its fainter. Taste is also similar but fainter. Malt is really lacking and there is no sweetness or carbonation to give this beer life. Finish has a slight hoppiness but that's about it. Unfortunate that some people buy this.","granger10","May 13, 2006"

2.9,25,4.5,2,3.5,3.5,2,"Pours pale straw with crystal clarity. Dense, foamy head of two and a half fingers shows good retention and leaves nice sticky lacing. Light aroma of cereal adjuncts and pale malt, but skunked hops dominate. The taste is sweet and corny with a pale malt flavor trying to pull through. A pleasently mild euro hop flavor comes through in the aftertaste, but this overcompensation for a lack of malt flavor puts the flavor out of balance. Smooth, light body with even carbonation. That distinctive ""skunk"" taste is the only real character in this beer, so the drinkability is good if you're fond of that light-struck flavor.","PBRstreetgang","Apr 23, 2006"

I would call this a ""n/h"" beer for non-hopped. There would be no suprise to find out that they removed the hop flavor from this beer after brewing in the way non-alcoholic beers are made. Yet this is one of the few ""light"" beers that tastes very close to its non-light offering. A true swill nonetheless.","jvdineen","Apr 10, 2006"

It pretty much tastes like regular Heineken that's been watered-down, yet it still retains most of the alcohol. Gone are the nice, malts and herbal hops. It is, however, very refreshing. Very refreshing! - kind of like water. And, it has enough hop flavor and bitterness that it tastes much more like ""beer"" than the American ""light"" beers. There are better light beers available (Sam Adam's, for example), but in comparison to the likes of Bud Light, Miller Lite, Amstel Light, and Corona Light I'd take this one.","NeroFiddled","Apr 06, 2006"
