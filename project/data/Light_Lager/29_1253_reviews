"Yeah about this beer... Mass brewed says it all"
"For a light beer, this one at least has taste.  For its style, it is good.  Nice for a hot day."

"Michelob Light brewed by Anheuser-Busch, with an ABV of 4.3% This brew pours out a nice amber color with a small white head. The smell is rich with grains and malts. There is a hit of hops in the smell of this brew.  The taste is light, but is bold with flavor.  Michelob Light has a nice balance to it, there is nothing overpowering in it.  The mouthfeel is light, rich and smooth. I really like the taste of this light brew,  Michelob Light has flavor for being a light beer.   There is nothing bad about this brew. Overall I'm giving Michelob Light a 4.5 out of 5. Michelob Light is not a bad light beer, I would buy this brew again."

"Favorite light beer.  Light & refreshing while still maintaining a good malt profile."

"Looks great, but not a lot of taste but very drinkable and pretty much everyone will drink it."

"At the Cabot Lodge happy hour...not as bad as you'd think!"

"Overall (3.69) : As I sit here with a Golden Light and a regular Light next to each other (I stopped my review and pulled a MGL from the fridge), the Michelob Light tastes much better and has better flavor. Where the Golden Light has grassy straw and corn, Michelob Light has rice, barley, and faint hop. It's not as easy drinking or unoffensive as Michelob Golden Light, nor is it near as cheap, but I have to say the regular Light is the superior beer."

"Pours a lighter golden color with a very thin white head that settles just to around the sides of the glass. Very little spotty lacing is seen but not much really. The aroma isn't much, just of some grassy grain for the most part with a hint of sweet corn. The taste is about the same with a slight sweet finish. Much more flavor and tastes better than their more popular ""Michelob Ultra"" which I didn't care much for. Medium carbonation. Overall, not bad and close to the flavor from 20 years ago that I remember."

"O: Not flavorful at all, goes down easily and not too filling since there isn’t much to the beer, very mild kick, not the best representation of style, even for a light beer this one isn’t very good."

"Overall: This was refreshing on a hot day. It's what my dad drinks, and I stole one out of curiosity. It's definitely not something I'll purchase on my own dollar, but it was pleasantly surprising (which is of course, relative in the world of American light beer)."

"Overall – Higher in sweetness but lower in refreshment for a beer of the “light” category. A little too much corn and papery taste combined with the off feel make this brew one to likely avoid."

"Overall: A bit disappointing. Compared to the Michelob Ultra this is a bit weaker. The Ultra had a bit more beer flavor and appearance. This was really low flavor and did not make me want to come back for more."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The taste is fresh with grains and a crisp, quick light hop finish. It is really what I would expect from the style so I would call it average for the style. Nothing crafty here. Just plain old thirst quenching stuff."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I think this beer has an above average taste that doesn't bite but is full bodied and flavorable. I perfer a glass bottle over the can or tap. To me it is a much richer beer than it's brouther Ultra that taste much closer to water. My only problem is it seems that Michelob Light is fading out of the picture. I am having difficulty finding my favorite beer in the market place. I guess that is why this is known as Dad's beer but the yuppie beer Ultra just does't measure up for me."

"Well, this achieved what they set out to achieve. It's light bodied, very lightly flavored, and you can work through quite a few of them. It's unoffensive, highly drinkable, but ultimately forgettable."

"I cannot believe that this beer is not as popular as other light American beers. Its much better than Bud Light, Coors Light, and Miller Light. Super drinkable, real malt and hop flavor, and some lacing make this light lager my go to light beer. Don't waste your time with Michelob Ultra. Michelob Light is much better."

"O: It's good for one thing: when for whatever reason, you're pounding beers like a madman and don't want to seem as hoi polloi as the typically redneck Bud Light drinkers. That's it. People, I drink this stuff so you don't have to, so just get some real beer instead. Might I suggest some Sierra Nevada Pale Ale?"
""
"I'm not sure why, but this is my favorite Bud product. It doesn't taste offensive, actually quite smooth with very little intense flavors or hops. Appears a little darker than normal light lagers but that seems to be a good thing. not a beer for playing drinking games, but I more closely relate this as ""your dad's"" beer. not complex but gets the job done. ""free beer"" rule applies here."

"Pours to a thick white head that falls to a thin layer, no lacing. Pale yellow. Aroma is a weak combo of CO2, faint hops, grains and a whiff of decomposed veggies. Flavor is weak and bland--you can taste the malt and hops and know that they are good, but they are just too faint to enjoy. Mouthfeel is over-carbonated but not exactly watery either. Overall, a waste of money and space in the fridge."

"O - Wasn't expecting much and it was drinkable, not terrible for what it is"
"Not a good beer. Not a bad beer. Rather unmemorable, which isn't a good thing."
"clear and yellow with a white head and collar,smell was corn rice and bread and malts..had a sweet corn and malt start a little hop taste with bread and grain finish..crisp and carbonated easy to drink it went well with the wings..not a failure but an average beer that is really not to bad on a 100 degree day"
"Pours between a pale straw color and water, with much carbonation and a small white head that disappears quickly. Stale hops and skunk on the nose. Not much in the flavor department other than what was received in the nose. Light, thin, and watery. Goes down easy. To be avoided."
"Every time I review a BMC product I really try to look deep for the good qualities and rate it for what it is. Unfortunately, even for a light beer this stuff is not good. The only good side is that you can drink a lot of these but due to the lack of flavor, would you really want to? Sorry AB, you have failed once again."
"O- A decent light lager I guess. Nothing remarkable, and generally light in every regard. In that sense, mission accomplished."
"RJT"
"It is not too bad in the looks department. It has a nice white head and spread out lace. The body is a pale straw gold color. The aroma is faint but what is there does smell corny. The body is watery with some carbonation tickle. This beer has a very light American Pilsner taste. It is a little bit sweet, corny and with a faint saaz tone. For a light beer it is not too bad."
"i used to drink michelob light in my college days (""the cockpit"" in 5points- columbia sc). i drank it mainly because it was their cheap beer. the unique bottle it came in and the price were the best things about it. dont get me wrong michelob aint bad... its just an average american beer from one of the big boxes. i honestly dont think i could tell the difference in a blind taste test between bud, coors, michelob or any of the other light american lagers. its not to say that i dont like them, i mean, if you got some drinkin to do they're a welcomed old friend- my pallet has grown a bit over the years and if i'm drinkin beer for taste, i'm not going with an american light beer. all of that said- michelob isn't a bad product. if you got one for me ill gladly drink it."
"Drinkability- Enjoyed 3 back to back all poured into this interesting pilsner glass. The drinkability is unreal on these as well as they go down easier than ever. Loving the beer from Saint Louis lately!"
"The feel of this beer is light and drinkable for even the occasional beer drinker this goes down with little effort."
"Pours a hazy yellow color, some carbonation, nice little one-finger white head, with some minimal sticky lacing left behind. The nose is kinda malty, with some funkyness. The taste is slightly sweet, malty. Light Body. Not Drinkable, this one is just like the rest of the macros out there, not worth of buying again."
"D- Drinkable like water. Bland and boring."
"As expected, light bodied, thin and watery, with decent carbonation. This is not a beer I would seek out again."
"Drinkability - Like I said... goes down smooth! it was what I expected from a Michelob Light. Could definitely throw back a few of these at a backyard barbecue."
"Pours a thin yellowish straw color with a thick rocky white head and no lacing. Smells of corn and some grain, hops are nowhere to be found. Tastes quite awful. Like corn on the cob in a biscuit. Mouthfeel is super thin and the drinkability is fairly decent for something that tastes like horse piss."
"The Crack & Glug proceeded as usual, with a short moment of panic as the creamy, bone-white head began to approach the lip of the glass. Fortunately, I know what to do in such situations and backed off of my pour. Great head retention, BTW. Color was a light lemon-yellow with NE-quality clarity. Nose was light with a citrusy spiciness that was truly unexpected. It was like lemon zest with a mild biscuitiness. Mouthfeel was medium with a lemony taste on the tongue along with an attendant bite or snap. Dang, this is pretty good! Finish had more of a biscuit taste, but the lemon was still there. It reminded me of Archway Lemon Snap cookies. Completely unexpected! The only knock on this was its watery mouthfeel. I would bring this in the cooler for those who are into Light beers, but I am not a calorie counter, plus I am betting that this is sold at the ""Premium"" price range and I would not want a case at those prices."
"What knob pays more than $1 per beer for this stuff? $6.99 at Walmart. Not drinkable."
"Poured this brew in my glass and watched as the thin head went south in twenty seconds. Little lacing, little cling. Color is amber, a little darker than most light beers, rating a 4 on the SRM chart. Smells like corn, rice, and wheat...slightly sweet. Tastes of barley, wheat, corn and rice, with a slight hop finish. Watery in my mouth, too much carbonation, bites at my tongue. I could probably drink a bushel full and not get much of a buzz. Another light beer that is just lacking in everything to be worth paying for, none the less drinking. Most likely my first and last."
"Pours with about a quarter of the color density of straw with the thinest of thin white heads. Nose brings forth light grain and cardboard. Taste brings the same. Almost so light it's hard to find even those flavors. Feel is way overly carbonated and drinks poorly. Light, cardboard-soaked seltzer water."
"D - A pretty poor drinkability score -I gave it my honest review -it is basically tasteless, a waste of time -avoid"
"d- light mouthfeel and average taste makes this beer have good drinkablity"
"Bottle: Poured a golden color lager with a fizzy pure white head with minimal retention and no lacing. Aroma of sweet malt with light corn notes is bland and not that enjoyable. Taste is also a bland mix between some sweet malt with light adjunct notes (I know the label states all-malt lager but I have a hard time believing this). Body is light with good carbonation. Bland lager and not something that need to be revisited."
"[bottle - 12 oz] Not a bad light beer. Has a sickly pale yellow color with mild carbonation. Light aroma with some mild grass and corn hints. Weak taste of hops, grass, corn and some dry malts. Very watery. No head. Not a beer I would get again I do not think."
"Bottle: Poured a golden color lager with a fizzy pure white head with minimal retention and no lacing. Aroma of sweet malt with light corn notes is bland and not that enjoyable. Taste is also a bland mix between some sweet malt with light adjunct notes (I know the label states all-malt lager but I have a hard time believing this). Body is light with good carbonation. Bland lager and not something that need to be revisited."
"Bland, watery, and boring. This beer is extremely light. The flavor is of corn and water. Pours a pale yellow without a head. This is water with a hint of skunky grain. Worse than bud light. They actually made a light version of water with gold hue and has only 123 calories!!!"
"Appears a pale fizzy yellow lager with decent scattered thin lacing lining the glass. Aroma has semi sweet pale malts with some actual herbal hop notes going on. It's a light American lager brewed by the big boys but it's not horrible. Again decent hop action going on because you can actually detect some hops even if it's a subdued version of what I've come to know as a hop profile. Easy going more flavorful than the average BMC, nice golf outing brew for a hot summer day. Mouthfeel is light with carbonation that tickles the back of the throat a bit much, fizzy yellow lager has it's place. Not something I'll be buying but it's a welcome leftover in my fridge after a get together the other night, again better than the average AB brews that most people drink like kool-aid."
"D- A drinkable macro that gets the job done but still has the stale light beer flavor. Good and all and all above other beers of its nature."
"Notes: As far as light beers and Macro-like beers, it is decent. However I don't know if the slight improvement is worth the increase in price."
"Possibly my favorite light beer. It is what it is. If putting a dozen beers down in one sitting is the goal, then this is my beer."
"Cheers!"
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a pale yellow color with a small head. Smell is mild, some malts. Taste is greatly missing for the most part. Water with some hints of beer. Feels watery in the mouth. Drinkability is fairly good since it is so light. Overall not a lot going for this beer."
"Pale yellow with bland aroma. Little or no head, just not a good light offering from a ""premium"" label. Michelob is not the brand it was 30 or more years ago, sad to say. There is not much to this beer - no malt or hop presence at all in my opinion. Save a few $$$ if you want to got this route and just have a Miller Lite. This is not a premium light lager."
"Drinkability: Satisfactory! Michelob Light is an acceptable light lager that isn't entirely devoid of flavor or woefully watery."
"Well to start... yeah its a macro/cheap beer in a can. Very similar to all the other bud lights/miller lites/natural lights/keystone etc., but I find this one to have a tad more of a hop flavor. Even keeps its head as you drink it, can't say that about much of the other ones, and even a tiny bit of lacing showing it has some substance to it. Clearly a lawnmower/party beer, but its quite refreshing and a lot more tolerable and most of the other cheap beers, plus it's the same price... one of my favorite cheap beers."
"D - Easy to drink but unfortunately not that enjoyable. It is clear that you have to sacrifice taste in order to watch calories, and Michelob Ultra is a good example of this."
"Drinkability: This isn't the worst beer I've ever tried, but I don't think I'll be getting it again."
"The taste is of light grain, some malt sweetness, and a decent hop bitterness. Overall, pretty flavourful for a light lager and one of best of the style that I've tried."
"I poured this average bland brew into my tumbler at 50 degrees. I would not normally waste my time rating a domestic beer but my wife drinks these and said why not? So. The beer poured a nice blond color, clear and sparkling. The head was white with tinly little bubbles that did not last long at all.The smell was breadty and yeasty. The taste was crisp and clean for sure. Good chick beer. I would drink this beer on a really hot summer day."
"Taste is better than expected for the style and the body actually has some semblance of legs to stand on. Bit buttery even on the finish with a short lived malt close. Carbonation is good, enough to lift the beer a bit, yet not the pucker I got from the Ultra. Drinkability is good; low ABV, low calories. Not a whole lot of flavor, yet this easily outstrips most competitors and many a big brother. Better than BMC's regular offerings."
"Um...not sure what to say about this. Not much of a beer. Not much in the way of flavor, not much in the way of anything. Piss color, no nose, very subtle candy malt flavor. And that's about it. No real point in drinking it - if you're looking for a light beer, get something better (Yuengling, Sam Adams Light) or cheaper (BMC?). No point going here."
"Overall: if you're going to drink something in this category, you're drinking crap beer. Why spend the extra money for Michelob when you can get much the same undesirable traits from Keystone or Natty for much less, and without much of a difference in taste? Poor value; the next time I pay for cheap American beer (which won't be for a long while) I'll just go for the cheap stuff."
"Somehow I find myself rating every American-style pale lager the same. That saddens me. There is, once again, no taste other than water, grains, and slight metallic hop flavors. Doesn't smell that great, the looks are nothing special. It's a light beer. Zero points for originality and would not buy or drink."
"Not as full bodied as the regular, but still respectable for a lite. Not much to the nose more grainy than Michelob. Light yellow pour medium creamy white head. More filling than most commercial counterparts. Flavor has that typical watery weak malt affect."
"Pours a five-finger white head that quickly fades to a ring leaving no lace. Crystal clear pale amber color. Very light carbonation and light bodied. Grassy nose. Flavor is sweet grass, clean finish. Very one dimensional, who drinks this stuff? $1.75 for a 12oz bottle from Barb's Beer Emporium Concord, NH."
"D - For a light beer, it's ok. I am a beer snob. But, for this style of beer and the fact that it is a mass produced, it is better than I expected."
"One of the best lights behind sam adams and amstel"
"D - Only if there is no other possible choice. And I'm pretty resourceful."
"This isn't terrible but I just don't see the point. For whatever reason I find this one to be even more watery than a lot of other light beer swill. However, that's almost like saying Aquafina is more watery than Poland Spring. Very pale yellow color with some straw or hay taste. Nothing offensive just nothing really to it."
"D: Definitely one of the better versions of this style that I've come across, much better than AB's other lights that I have had - Bud Light and Michelob Ultra. Soft and easy to drink, if it was a couple dollars cheaper, I'd be inclined to buy a sixer of it. To the craft beer drinker, you really don't get much, but it would be easy to drink a sixer over the course of a hot summer day."
"Another crappy beer from AB. Amazing. Who would have thunk it."
"This one was also free at our hotel at Disneyland,very pale straw yellow that you could see right through,little white head and no lacing.Wet grass and grains with a good whiff of corn is what comes to the nose,taste is the same with the corn coming thru,very lite body and bubbly like eno in water,went down like water,not much for my liking."
"D: Very high, I could drink at least a six-pack of these in a sitting. Very smooth, well balanced,"
"You get what you expect here. For a Macro brew, you can get it down, but not much more enjoyment than that."
""
"Clear, pale yellow body supports a decent white foamy head with moderate retention--not bad for a light beer. I'm not impressed with the smell, with a faint malty aroma peeking through, light grassy, but nothing else. OK taste, a decent bit of malt for a light beer, but on the whole not impressive. Smooth mouthfeel with fairly good carbonation and duration assist Mick Light, and it's far from the worst light beer I've ever had. But it's not a beer that interests me, that piques my interest with some fairly well done aspect or interesting twist in the slightest. That's about what I expected. Beats nothing in dire straits, but falls far short of actually good beer."
"In summary, there are so many other beers out there with different characters and more to offer in terms of flavor, character, mouthfeel etc, I could easily forego my daily beer ration if my only choice was Michelob light."
"Pours a clear yellow with lots of carbonation and a fizzy white head. Smells like grassy hops and pale malt. The taste is super light. Possibly a slight malt presence? Body is soda like and has a bit of a bite to it. I don't mind lagers with no flavor, but they probably shouln't give me the bitter beer face. Not too drinkable due to the bite. Oh well, at leat I'm not going to get fat off of this one."
"Reading the commercial description made me laugh when I saw super-premium light beer. Never knew there was such a thing. This beer sucks like most American light pale lagers. No taste, too much carbonation, etc. Not really that offensive, just lacking everything from taste to aroma."
"Don't bother with this."
"I'd avoid if at all possible."
"D= if you're into this for the night, stranded at some non-beer-literate party or pub, you'll survive it in-session. I usually keep some MGB on stock at home, as inexpensive backups or for US-macro-only fans. This one has less in the flavor but overall makes a nicely reasonable compromise for those who ""know real beer."""
"Overall, it's much better than miller lite, bud light, etc. I'll buy it again when I want something light and simple (like when I'm with friends who have no interest in discussing the character of their beer, which is both frequent and OK)."
"This beer is OK. It is like many of the other macro brewed light lagers out there. It is a very pale yellow color with a short white head. The smell is of very light malt and very light hops. The taste is the same. Very light malt and very light hops that are just watered down. The aftertaste is kind of dry and it doesn't really do much for my beer needs, but that is what these light lagers tend to do. Not really worth it, even if you are gonna rollerblade on your ""power lunch"". The good thing is that it is pretty drinkable and I could drink a bunch of these."
"Overall drinkability is very east cause it is like fizzy water. What tiny bit of beer flavor I detected was not bad, but that kinda sucks for me cause I like having flavor in my beer. Oh well."
"Wow, I haven't killed a soldier in awhile. This one definitely went down the drain after four sips. Thank god it was free. Pours a pale yellow. Smells crisp, light, and sweet (to its credit I guess). Tastes awful, like theres nothing but adjuncts and sugar. Very grainy. Thin mouthfeel, high carbonation. If it were cold and stayed cold I could probably finish it, but this is basically re-labeled Bud Light to me..."
"D - Like most beers in this style they are theoretically fairly drinkable. But I'd rather not drink beer."
"D: Very pleasant. Much better than your typical AB beer. Nothing impressive, but one of the best efforts I've seem from AB."
"D- An easy drinker, almost as easy as water. But no flavor whatsoever."
"While you won't find utopia in a beer like this, you will find a better consistency than many other light lagers. This is pretty close to Sam Adams Light in my opinion as both are all-malt, have decent flavors and still considered to be ""light"" beers. I think again that A-B has made a good choice with the Michelob line (sans the ""Ultra"" stuff)."
"This brew pours a clear straw color. The head is one inch in height and lasts about a minute before it recedes into this lacing. This is one of the better looking light beers I have seen. The aroma is of cereal with a touch of caramel, but is very faint. The taste is just like the aroma. The mouthfeel is light bodied, with high carbonation. However, it does have a somewhat silky texture. Overall, this is one of the better light beers I have had. I wouldn't buy it again, because light beer isn't my thing. However, if I were at a party with only macros to choose from, and if I were in the right mood (i.e. I really felt like having a beer) I would drink this again."
"What can I really say about this, looks bad, smells like air and tastes like flavored water. At a concert it is all you can get, so its what you are left with. Pale yellow carbonated water that has to be drank freezing or it is completly untolerable, please look somewhere else."
"It's not offensive, that is unless you find the lack of flavor to be offensive to the name of beer. There's a low pale malt flavor masked by a slight sweetness and dusty-grain like flavor. The aroma hints of sour grains and the drinkability isnt bad if you're thirtsy. Really though, there isn't much reason to try this."
"For a AB product this isn't bad and for an AB light beer this is outstanding when compared to the rest of the pack. This isn't going to make me swear off Pilsner but if I had to drink a light beer this is easily the best of the bunch except for maybe Sam Adams light."
"Michelob light is a brew i go for when im with friends and we are picking out a keg of light beer to use at a party , for beer olympics and such. It pours clear and very pale, with alot of carbonation building the foamy bright white head. The aroma is of some lightly bready grains, and possibly a hint at noble hop. The flavor is of course light, but with more malt flavor than most light beers in its class. Some lightly sweet hay like grain , and just enough balancing bitterness that is a bit spicy. Light body and fairly carbonated feel. It goes down with ease and id choose it over many other light beers. Good bottles to."
"This would make a decent session beer, if you make sure to drink it nice and cold."
"Why would anyone drink this? You want a session beer? There are better beers out there for sessioning. You want cheap? There are better cheap beers out there. You want to watch your weight? Try exercising once in a while, stop eating shit, and stick with the truly flavorful beers."
"Overall impression: Certainly not an exciting beer, but I do appreciate seeing an all malt light lager. Won't be seeking it out, but it seems like a better trend than the alco-pops and adjunt filled light lagers."
"pours a light golden color out of the new/old bottle, not much of a difference from the old mich light, but there is a hint of more maltiness. smells like nothing, water at the most tastes lacking to say the least, slight malt and hop note, but not much of anything else, mouthfeel is average, drinkability is high just cause you could drink it all day long and nothing would happen to you."
"Taste is pretty similar to any other macro light lager with a slightly stonger malt presence and more noticeable grassy hops. Definitely decent as far as this category goes, yet still nothing special. I would like to see how the Amber Bock is as All Malt."
"Characteristically there's nothing to say except light gold, bubbly, and a thin corn-like sweetness. This is better than most other massprolts because A. it doesn't have off tastes and B. you really can drink a twelve and feel fine in the morn. Very light on taste but highly drinkable especially compared to others in this style. Underrated here! In a close race with Lite for massprolight supremacy."
"Example: I could bring a case of this over to my bro-in-law's house, knock it off with him during a Yankee game and feel no pain in the morning."
"ALL-MALT: Light amber body (just slightly darker hue than the old one) with an inch of white head that dissipates somewhat quickly but leaves some lacing. Smells sweet and grainy. Tastes sweet with bready and biscuity notes with a hint of DMS. Still the flavor is somewhat weak and watery. Light bodied, but not quite as watery as the old one IMO. Not a great leap from the old version, though it does taste better and is more palletable. Far and away the best macro lager out there now (unless you count Sam Adams) IMHO."
"At first, I might have mistaken this for a pale lager, as it pours a surprisingly good head into my recently bought Kronenbourg 1664 glass. Faint smells of adjuncts stop as I tilt the glass into my mouth, and taste Uncle Ben's rice, with a small trace of bitterness. A bit watery, but firm for a light beer. Not a harsh beer to drink, but nothing really happening either. I guess what I'm trying to say is it's not bad for a light beer. And that's with adjuncts!"
"I have to give credit to AB here, they've brought Mich Light back from swill into a passable no-frills."
"Creamy and thicker than expected. Leaves a bitter feel, but actually not too bad considering type. Relatively inoffensive for a macro. Could do a lot worse. Not too bad for a lower-tier brew."
"Not worth trying."
"Your typical macro. I got this pint at Prime Time Sports Grill. It poured not head with very fast retention and little (if any lace). The color was a pale gold, if that is a color. The smell was typical macro. The taste was typical macro. By typical macro I mean that it was blah, not good, but not bad. Decent brew. Don't drink and review."
"Drink-Ability: Not the best light beer out there, just tastes like it was over filtered or something."
"Our fireworks team did a show last night for the local high school. When we were returning the equipment to the team directors barn around midnight he wandered down from his house and brought us a bottle of this beer down as a token of thanks for a show that was well received by the football fans. This really hit the spot. Occasions like this fit this style of beer well. Every beer has its place and this one serves in that aspect really well."
"D - I wouldn't regularly pick this up, but when it is free and it is the only beer option it will do the job."
"I suppose for mass produced light beer, Michelob Light is not really all that bad when there isn't any choice when being out with friends at a bar, boiling alley or a ballgame. I suppose the host of our family reunion did okay when selecting this, he could have done much worse."
"Anheuser-Busch is known the world over for their commitment to quality and it shows. In addition to Bud Light (the best selling light beer on earth), Michelob Light proves that they really know how to make a light beer work."
"What's the difference between this and water? Water doesn't give you a headache."
"Decent mouthfeel and decent drinkability"
"The smell is bland and a little skunky, I think they need to clean out their lines. The taste is nothing great at all and is bitter, stale hops and adjunts? Really is sad this is one of the better offerings from the largest brewer in the world."
"Michelob Light was served to me with absolutely no head. Its appearance was typical of macro lagers, yellow. The smell was typical as well, adjunct. Tastes like corn. Fairly typical and nothing to particularly recommend it. Okay for lawnmower beer, frat parties, and other appropriate occasions only."
"D: Might be nice with spicy food, but water will serve the same purpose. Save your money for a beer with some flavor -- this one simply has none."
"Drinkability: Could conceivably drink about a dozen, but the question is, do I want to? The lack of enjoyment derived from this beer is the biggest knock against its drinkability."
"Its one of the palest beers I've ever had. Pours with a small white head that disappears very quickly. Smell is all malt adjunct (mostly corn). Taste? I don't think it has any. Tastes like a piece of wonder bread was stuck in seltzer water for a while then served as beer. Why buy this when you could get something good? Or getting something equally bad for half the price? I'm never having this again."
"Mind you, the only reason I paid any money for this beer tonight was so I could finish this craxz beer club I'm in where I get a nice $50 gift certificate after completing my list. As you can tell, I'm near the end. Not the worse since it's on draft, this beer is just so nearly not as good after I've reviewed 250+ beers in the past year or so. Either your tastes really change or the comparison is so obvious now. Not worth even drinking after a mowing the lawn on a hot day. In 40 degree weather, it's even worse."
"Pours light yellow with a tinge of amber and has a medium-sized, white, quickly diminishing head. Only the slightest film and light, spotty lacing. The smell is lightly floral and grainy. The taste is well for a light macro, not horrible. Crisp and light with the slightest hint of nut. Its not terrible, but its just too bland and watered down for me to really take much pleasure in drinking one of these, but it is easy-drinking."
"a beer from anheuser family, the best of all is its Bottle in elegant extruded aluminum; no comments about its drinkability, little aromatic of hops, adjoincts, rice over the flavor off course; good for american and mexican cuisine; snack; monday night; not try with german cuisine; 70% recommended."
"Overall a good try at a light American lager. I tad better than Miller Lite no doubt. Just cost more than the latter. I actually enjoyed this beer."
"Hanging out at my brother's house before going to the brewpub downtown, I figured I'd try one of his Mich Lights. Pale, almost clear golden color with a whisp of a fizzy head. Slightly sour aroma of cheap adjunct malt. Palate actually has a bit of flavor to it - cheap malt and a bit of smokiness. I don't think you could pick up any hop flavor with an electronic sniffer. Light body is slightly foamy. Not terrible, but certainly not a pleasurable drinking experience."
"Sample out of one of the fancy new aluminum bottle / cans, brought back from a recent trip to the States. Definatley a unique package, metallic blue, tall and thin 16 oz. After the rather stunning package, it is a very basic BMC macro product. Pours out a yellow color, foam comes and goes leaving a glass of yellow colored water. It has a light aroma of some grain or grass. Not much taste, again, typical of what you expect from a light beer. The mouthfeel is fizzy and over carbonated. Nothing special, would not search out again based on the taste, but it is a cool looking can."
"Lackluster and tasteless. Looks light yellow and brightly clear. Overly carbonated and lacks head retention or lacing. Tastes low malty or sweet. Grainy and cornlike. Slightly metalic and astringent. Tastes similar to smell. Hard on the toung and palate because of the carbonation. Thin and scrubbed to the palate. No malt or hop flavor or balance to mention. Light and powdery finish with a grainy, metalic aftertaste. Aside from all of its poor qualities, it's not offensive; but neither is water. All of it's beer-like qualities disolve as soon as it hits the palate."
"Appearance is that translucent pale straw we have come to associate with Lite beers. Way too much carbonation diminishes the aroma (straw, barley, dextrose and not much else) and the taste. Foam appears and disappears without leaving anything to remember them by. Initial taste is of water, a hint of malt and a soupcon of hops. Finish is non-existent  the beer just goes down your throat and thats it. Not worth a repeat."
"12 oz., ""born on"" 5/2/05 - served chilled in a pint glass. Pours a thin, watery yellow that is crystal clear with lots and lots of streams of bubbles rising to the surface and a 1/2 inch white head that doesn't leave much lacing. Smell is of adjuncts and metal, with the same for the flavor but with a trace of hops. Very light with your average macro drinkability."
"Michelob Light is the clear loser of Macro Smackdown V. That's not to say that Miller High Life Light is any great shakes, but this beer just rolled over and quit (flavor-wise). A more pathetic showing I have rarely seen. The new canottle/bottcan didn't do squat. Gosh, and I really expected it to. Stay away from Mich Light. Stay very... very... far away."
"sampled their new aluminum bottle shaped can. Poured a light amber color with white head. Taste in very light with a background sweetness. Mouth is not unpleasant and is a good thirst-quencher. A good example of a lawn-mower beer. An easy drinking beer."
"Another US macro review. It is a very typical BMC macro product. It has a light aroma and not much taste, but just enough to make you remember that you're drinking a macro. The mouthfeel is foamy and overall, it is another yellow fizzy macro. The last time I had a Michelob, it was a regular one and it was better than its light version. Not a problem to find out lots of better beers."
"A weak follow up to it's half decent full flavored brother. Not much to speak of here. Light golden color, with a decent head, but as with most other AB products, it dissipated in less than 15 seconds. Medium carbonation, and odors of corn and malt were detected over the slight aroma of alcohol. Flavor was decent, but not anything great, with overtones of hops, barely and corn. Finished slightly sweet, with a kind of floral note. Nothing special here. They need to go back to the unique bottle, then I might buy this stuff once in a while... Then again, maybe I wouldn't then anyway."
"Poured from a sharp looking aluminum bottle. Does this count as a bottle, since it is can material? Who knows. Clear straw color, barely any head visible. Smell? What smell? Barely grainy, and I mean barely. Taste is also lightly grainy. No decent malt presence, no hops to speak of. What a weak POS beer. Skip it."
"Still one of my favorite light beers! If i want an agreeable light beer that most people can drink, that will still give me some sence of forfillment, this is it. Much more flavor than most other light beers. Not as flavorfull as most lagers or sam adams light, it is still far superior to the bud light, coors light genre or beers."
"Easy to drink, just like cold and refreshing carbonated water. A typical fizzy, tasteless, American macro light and nothing more."
"This stuff is not a bad choice for getting loaded in the ice shanty (or whereever it is that you get loaded). Lots better than Bud Light, the Michelobs should probably be Anheuser-Busch's flagship beer."
"12oz. bottle: I cant believe that I used to drink this all the time. As for Macro lagers go, it isnt half bad. It doesnt have a very strong aroma, but it isnt unpleasant in the least. The taste is about the same. There is a bit of it there, but it doesnt offend. On the plus side, it is smooth and easy to drink. I miss the old bottle. Whatever happened to tradition!!!"
"Noble hop flavor? Wretched."
"Well, wife-zilla was turning 50, so I had to supply some *better* stuff than Bud lite for her family. No way could I get good stuff without them complaining. Well, the Mic lite was acceptable, its just doesnt have a lot of flavor. It pours ok with a minimal head, no aroma to speak of. No one got sick from it, so I guess thats the highlight of this stuff."
"Very plae and clear. Does form a nice, long-lasting head that is quit respectable. Smell is very lacking, so I gave it a rock-bottom score. Very light in taste, slightly sweet, with hops doing very little as well. A little bitter, leaving virtually no aftertaste. The beer has so little taste that it's easy to drink, but you have to wonder why you would want to."
"As light macros go, this one isn't horrible...yet there's no reason to recommend it, either. However, if you're ever in an all-BMC situation, this is one of your better options."
"Reflection: If you have to drink a light beer try Sam Adams or Amstel but if you had any sense at all you would be drinking Guinness for only a few more calories."
"Have some damn pride."
"Overall- I'm surprised many don't like this brew a lot, I found a lot of flavor in its taste, a nice refreshing light beer that is leaps and bounds above its competitors. For a good light beer you can't go wrong."
"Not a very drinkable beer..Ive had Non-alcoholic beer that taste better."
"With so many quality lagers available to purchase, I cannot fathom why anyone would choose this dreck. No flavor, no redeeming qualities at all unless it is ice-cold and you have nothing else to drink."
"The beer upon its exit from the 12-ounce brown bottle sets in the glass a limpid pale gold color with a modest semi-creamy bright white head and after its demise, the lace forms a velum like sheet on the glass. Nose is sweet malt, fresh and crisp, start sweet and light grain profile, top slender in its feel to the palate. Finish is benignly acidic, the hops sparing in their spiciness, quite dry aftertaste."
"I've had much worse light beers than this one, but that still is not saying much! It poured a straw yellow color with a small fizzy head that faded quickly into nothingness. The smell was lightly malty with a dirt like smell to it as well. The taste was a little heavier than most light beers and had a decent malt profile and not much of a grainy flavor at all. Decent mouthfeel for a light beer as well. Not good enough to buy but I'd drink it if it were available for free."
"Tasted: 06/16/04"
"Pours an unattractive pale yellow with alot of bubbles rishing through the glass. Head isn't to bad but goes down to a fizzle. Smell is of roasted corn and grain, clean to the nose. Taste is very clean and fresh, grain notes are the steady taste, sweetness lingers but the hop pizazz just wasn't there, almost a flat tingle. Light bodied lager goes down easy but so much better out there why settle for this?"
"michelob light was an above average light beer. It went down very smooth and I enjoyed it. However I was expecting more taste, the bottle says brewed with imported hops but to tell you the truth this beer tasted very similar to the less pricey Michelob Golden Draft Light sold here in minnesota. It was very easy to down the 12 pack I bought. If you are ever in Minnesota or Its border states save some money and buy Mich Gold Light"
"The beer pours a very pale yellow color with a frothy white head that fades to lacing. The aroma is decent. It boasts of mostly pale malts and lager yeast, but is also fresh smelling. The taste is decent also. It is watery and weak with a slight malt flavor. It refreshes on the way down and finishes clean. It has a slight bitter skunkiness, but it is very small. The mouthfeel is good. This is a low bodied beer with good carbonation. This beer drinks well despite all of it's limitations. This is the light macro beer for me. Cheers!"
"From what I could tell of the color, it was in a can after all, it was a very pale yellow with quite a bit of carbonation. Produces a lot of foam while cruising around in a golf cart. Smelled about like what I expected, kinda grainy with just a hint of alcohol in the nose. Tasted better than Bud Light I can tell you that, and without the nasty headache. Didn't care much for the flavor overall though. It did surprise me with just a little hoppy bite at the end. Maybe a hint of what it could be were it not produced for the masses. Clean mouthfeel. Just enough carbonation to give it a bite, kinda crisp. I'll take this over Bud, with that being said, I won't drink this often. It is however, a work of art when compared to Michelob Ultra."
"Final Thoughts: I consume a lot of this product without really thinking about it. In reality, this is just a mediocre beer that is over priced, IMO. At around $5-6 a six pack, better stuff can be had in this price range. When you think about it A-B touts the Michelob line as their high end beers when they really aren't that big of an upgrade in product, but significantly higher in price. Still, I'll probably keep buying it out of habit."
"This is a very light straw colored beer with some head and no noticable aroma. The taste is a significant disappointment (there was none), but not bad when compared to its style (competing against water, perrier, and low cal tonic water). Mouthfeel compares to that of other watery drinks. Drinkability is the high point of this alchoholic substance. Due to it's lack of substantial consistency or flavor, it could honestly be consumed in mass quantities. Just like water. If you consider yourself a lover of beer, I would steer clear of this offering. If you like to drink heavily for the purpose of mass consumption and drunkeness without becoming full or consuming mass calories, this is what you need."
"Well, I never really thought beer could taste like air. This one takes the cake for that one. It had no real distinctive taste at all really. Just a small shot of malt, which was weak at best. The rest was a heavy air/water taste. The only real redeeming quality of this ""beer"" is the apperance. It had a pale straw color with an impressive head that lasted a little while. Why is the drinkability so high? I could drink this if I needed some refreshment after lifting or throwing. If I was an alcoholic, I would substitute this for water."
"Pale yellow appearance with quickly dissipating head. No aroma to speak of, taste was lightly malty with slight hop flavor. This beer is a good choice with food but is not much by itself. This beer was my gentle introduction to beer drinking 24 years ago. It is not bad for a light beer."
"12 oz. bottle. Very pale yellow in color with a small head that doesn't last for more than 15 seconds or so. The smell is syrupy sweet. The taste is crisp and clean but not much there. Very carbonated. Tastes like corn and has no real body to it at all. The aftertaste just seems like something fizzy. Of all the light beers that I have had, this one isn't that good."
"Even though I really liked Michelob and Michelob Ultra, I really cannot say that I liked this beer that much at all. It has a very watered down taste, and in reality doesn't even taste like beer to me at all. I flat out just did not enjoy this at all, and would not recommend it unless it is the only thing available."
"All imported hops? What hops? There might be one or two in here. And imported from WHERE? I've tossed imported mulch in my garden, but that doesn't mean I want my hops grown in a peat bog. A little more information would be delightful here."
"Michelob is a pretty beer. Light in color allowing you to see the carbonation bubble to a thick rich-looking head. The smell was almost non-existant. Almost watery. That's where the taste comes in. watery. I don't know what they did, but I found no trace of hops anywhere on my palet."
"This beer is what it is -- a macrobrew devoid of any distinct flavor or character, but good when it's had ice cold on a hot summer day. I'll drink it if the Sam Adam's Light is all gone."
"Light gold color, medium head. VERY light bodied beer. Very little taste or flavor. Some malt and hops. Mouthfeel is full. Finish is clean. Aftertaste is very slightly bitter, slightly lemony. Nothing bad about this beer, nothing very good about it either. At least there is some taste to this light beer. It is light and refreshing, but wish it had some more flavor."
"""born"" on August 6, 2003"
"Notes: 130 calories -- about 20-30 less than almost *any* 5% ABV beer."
"This is better than most macros. Even though I costs a bit more I would still get it if I were going to drink a light lager for the night over other macros. Not much in taste but that's better than the others. Pretty smooth and creamy which is kind of surprising. A little better that others in it's field, but that still doesn't mean it's good."
"An acceptable session beer for thirst quenching and the ensuing socializing."
"Mouthfeel is paper thin. Drinkability is good for a light beer. If you have to drink or serve light, go for Sam Adams, Special Export or Leinies Amber."
"I too had thisone at Easter for it was the chioce at the time. It appeard clear, straw in color with a bit high on carbonation. The head was fizzy and short-lived. Lace was little. The body was watery but not as much as ""ultra"". The brew was smooth and drinkable if very cold.It will quench a hot days thirst. The taste offered no real hop or malt notice, just a grain & grassy taste and mouthfeel. Overall ok if choice is slim."
"No real hops detected. Exactly what I thought it would be - Fizzy grain water."
"I just can't stand A-B products. That awful taste is simply present in each and everyone of their beers. This is no different. Despite the standard yellow color and white head that's gone very quickly, there's always that same mouthfeel and bad flavor. This is probably OK if you can stand any of the A-B products. I just can't stomach the flavor. Someday I'll be able to describe because I'll likley keep sampling their stuff 'til I figure it out."
"Drinkability: Overall, not that bad, certainly easy to drink. Substantially lacking in character but inoffensive."
"Sickly pale yellow hue, tiny artificial-looking white head, poor retention, no lace. Adjunct filled nose, sweet, sticky, notes of grain. Similar sticky-creamy sweet taste, adjunct influenced, grainy at spots. No imported hops of note. Thin mouthfeel, highly carbonated, not too watery... rather clean. The finish is a tad sticky. Boring. Not worth a damn, I got two free bottles and after I drank them I had a headache. This light beer is not offensive but not enjoyable either."
"Surprisingly good for an Anheuser Busch light beer. Light straw in color with artificial, quickly rising bubbles. Moderate lace and head. Light hop aroma backed by slight sweet smell of cooked grains. Light in flavor with nice bitterness offset by malt and grain sweetness. Finishes slightly dry. Sweetens up a little as it warms, but not too much as compared to other macros by Busch."
"This light brew leaves you wanting."
"First, let me say I don't consider ""light"" beer to be real beer. I tried this with reservations, but a friend of mine swears by it. Michelob Light pours extremely light yellow. Forget a head or any other good looks. Taste is watered down swill. Very chemical like twang. I had trouble finishing this. I was actually pissed off that a beer this expensive is so awfull."
"Had a can of this and a can of Labatt Blue Light at a Bluejackets game. Back and forth I went between the two, back and forth, Labatt and Michelob, Michelob and Labatt. There literally was no difference. Both had next to no aroma or flavor. Both sucked sour frog ass. Taste tests between two crappy beers are not fun. At least they were free."
"Mich Light: even my macro swilling friends had to admit that this was one poor looking beer.  Weak yellow color, so much so that I had a macro swiller claiming that it was not a bad thing if a beer looked like urine.  Must I review it?  Ok, yellow, no head, no body, no hops, no taste, no nothing!  Better than bud, but who gives a rodents rump?"
"My verdict?  A slightly more tasty version of Bud Light that is quite drinkable, but I don't see the point in paying ""premium"" prices for a light beer.  Kind of refreshing on a hot day, I would suppose, and probably a good swill beer to have around if the guys are over."
"I used to drink these all the time. From '97-'01 it was probably my beer of choice...revisited it this weekend. Pours a nearly clear to yellow color. Thin wispy white head..smelled alot of the same grainy smells as the other AB products, but less offensive. It had some beer like qualities, faint hops, and a decent crisp finish, but way to watery. Might be an ok choice at dinner with nothing else to choose from.... certainly better than bud light."
"Okay, I am not a fan of light beers.  This is obviously better than than their Bud Light and Natural Light, but still nothing to write home about.  Very little body, taste or character to it.  When will somebody get the light beers right?"
"Again, light beer just doesn't make sense and Michelight isn't any different."
"If there is such a thing, yesterday (a warm, sunny day) seemed the best time to try a light beer.  I was outdoors, at a fair, and gave Michelob Light a try.  I'm sorry that I did.  Over-carbonated, with absolutely no taste, the beer was repulsive."
"Despite being an A-B product, I really can't complain with this one. It is probably one of the best light beers around. Everyone likes the bottle too. I like it at dinner."
"Nothing about this beer really distinguishes it.  I had it while partaking in several bowls of chili the other day.  Refreshing, with a  very, very light hop taste (but moreso than most lights).  I can find nothing bad to say about it and nothing outstanding.  I actually think this is better tasting than regular Michelob."
"I normally don't review macros, but 100 reviews is within striking distance, so I'll throw this one in.  I had one last night at my brother's.  I'm taking care of his cat and it's the only thing they had in their fridge.   It's not terrible, but I deserve better for scooping out the kitty litter."
"I rate this compared to ""good"" beers...compared to most light beers this one isn't bad...I'm not sure if they use rice in this one but it definitely has a different flavor..I'm guessing they do use rice..A bit more flavor than most light beers but at 130 plus calories I would hope so...As light beers go this is pretty decent, and on a hot summer day I could handle a few of these, but compared to ""good beers"" it just doesn't rate."
"Not too bad for a light beer...actually quite refreshing for a hot day...very pale in color and ultra light and clean in taste...it seems you could drink these forever without getting filled up"
"Notes: Such a clean beer, almost too clean. There are worse light beers out there but this one leaves you wondering ""How much stuff was filtered out of this beer?"""
"A pale shadow of the full-weight Michelob (which isn't all that great to start with).  Starts sweet, but finishes with a grainy, adjunct character.  Hops had a synthetic flavor."
