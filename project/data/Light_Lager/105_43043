This beer lacks flavor like nothing I have experienced so far, but then again I also got a single of Bud-55. The thing that makes no sense to me is I don't think many people would drink this without getting buzzed in mind.

The nose comprises sweet corn, light funky wheat, and a touch of hard water. The taste brings in more of the same, with more hardness to the water and a slightly sharper funkiness from the now-grassier wheat. The body is rather light, with a light moderate carbonation and a watery feel. Overall, a pretty limp, sad beer, one that certainly isn't much of a poster child for the "fewer calories but all the flavor" camp. Give me the calories...","TMoney2591","Apr 03, 2013"

Stale flavor and smell, mouthfeel of lukewarm water, and a miserable sickly pale color. The only reason I could imagine drinking this is because of the low calories, but if that is the issue, eat a salad once in a while. Weighing in at 2.8 ABV, you'd have to bong a case of these things just to get a slight buzz, which would offset the low calories. As will everything under the Miller label, this is just downright awful. I actually heard there was a scene in the movie Zero Dark Thirty when they interrogated a guy by making him drink one of these. After one sip, he begged to be water boarded. This beer is pure torture.","orcsinspace","Mar 07, 2013"

The ABV is so low it won’t have an intoxicating effect, if that’s what’s desired, and by the time it does you’d have drunk enough of these that you could have had a better beer.

Other diet beer, or non-diet beers even such as Budweiser Platinum and Rolling Rock offend me and they're not even trying to go lo-cal. There is no reason to drink those beers.

I can see the clear golden yellow appearance and thin white head. Maybe I could smell it better if poured into a glass seeing that I don't smell much here. It smells better than some other macro light beers that I've smelled. Although it smells as if lesser fermentables were used in the brewing... I've smelled worse. Pretty clean non-bitter taste. One of the better macro light beers out there, but not a very good BEER beer.","berserker256","Apr 01, 2008"

That is because this stuff has almost flavor whatsoever. It isn't even bad, it is non-descript. Just nothing to note of, and the only reason I drank this is because my cheap beer buddy is on a diet.

Scrubbed pale lager malt and tannic adjunct taste-very light with no hop flavor anywhere. A suggestion of hop extract bitterness balances the very delicate flavor and the aftertaste dries away to blankness almost instantly. Crisp and sharp carbonation and seltzery body- quite effervescent. The drinkability could be called excellent since a few seconds after taking a sip you could easily forget you were having a beer.

Flavor is mostly water and corn, but I can see how this could been a good beer on a hot summer day, if it was really cold and there was nothing else.

First of all the the thing that kills me has occasionally made me cry, being here in Germany any one can imagine all the delectable brews on the menu. Saying this it only makes me think down on alot of beer drinkers or should I say haven't got a clue about beer and drink what ever they had laying around the trailer. On the other hand this is a wonderful beer that will produce a good taste, tenderize or put a zip on any meal that you are cooking. I actually sent my wife to the store to buy it because I didn't want anyone actually seeing me buy it. All this aside the beer can chicken that this produces is mouth watering, the bratwurst are to die for and don't get me started on the beer battering. The 3 bucks a six pack keeps me coming back for more. Oh ya, it foams alot when I poor it in the pan and even more when I poor it in the flour for the batter and I allways get my gasmask out to keep the smell out of my nose I would never punish my senses like that so I am not sure of the taste or the mouthfeel.","paulaner","Jul 23, 2004"

A wee bit sweeter than most other American beers and far more palatable than Bud light, if I may be perimetted to say the "B" word. MGD light goes down easy and is a great inexpensive brew to enjoy in breaks while doing lawn work. I have found the above to hold true with most products from Miller Brewing Company. One thing I particularly like about this brew is that is has a light cracker/biscuit after taste. I had originally given this one 3.0 in all categories, but after some time of drinking it, it has grown on me a little and I notice a few more things about it that I didn't the first go 'round.","SilentSabre","Aug 26, 2003"
