"Pours a lighter to medium amber in color with a thin white cap that settles down to just a ring around the glass. Not much lacing is seen, just a couple of very light spots. The aroma isn't really all that much, just a hint of roasted malts and caramel. Pretty much is said for the taste. Actually isn't all that bad and probbaly the best of the 'Ultra' Micks. Lighter-bodied with decent carbonation. It's drinkable but that is about all I am going to go with."
"Feel: Exceptionally light and watery body. Crisp, medium carbonation."
"There's nothing offensive about this, it's a slightly flavored beer with low alcohol and a very thin feel. I detect a touch of barley malt, caramel, and roasted nut swimming in a pool of water. If I want to drink light and get a buzz and a bit of flavor this would be a go to."

"Not even good for a knock back after mowing the lawn on a hot summers afternoon. Does this mean I'll have to pour the rest of the 12 pack down the drain. #$@%"

"this beer had a slight carbonated feel to it. Not especially strong taste wise and I consider this a party beer where quantity wins out. I would definitely drink it again especially on a hot southern summer day. Appearance was of good color and it had a nice aroma that was not off the mark from its taste."
"Overall – Don’t expect too much here. But really should you really be expecting tons with a “ultra” low cal beer?"

"The look was typical of a Michelob beer which is ok, poor was a light white head that was gone as quickly as it came the color was a bit pale compared to that of other amber beer taste was over powered by carbonation but after wasn't bad. not to much to say about this beer other than it would be a good crisp beer on a hot day with a decent taste. I would buy it again for that reason only."

"Light golden amber in color, clean and clear, moderate cap of bone white froth - so far so good. Scent pale and non-existent, only positive is no off-notes. Same with taste, pale and faint, hint of malt that is neither sweet or toasted, no off notes. Light bodied, bubbly. Nothing much going on here, but id take it over any other BMC Light product as it didnt have much in the way of off-notes."
""
""
""
"Over all: Been there, done that. Moving on now."
""
"This is an incredibly light beer with little flavor. It's crisp and very easy to drink as is expected. The off notes are enough to ruin this one. I won't buy it again."
""
"O: This is a great light beer. From now on, it is my go to light beer. While it does have less flavor than other light beers like Bud, Miller, and Coors light, the flavor that is there is far superior."

"Not as tasty as the original Michelob Ultra. In fact, you cannot taste any malt or barley at all in this. It really just tastes like water and weak hops. The flavor is not too offensives, but it doesn't have the fresh, clean flavor of Michelob Ultra. It tastes a little stale."
""
""
""
""

"I would not suggest drinking this unless there were no other options available. Not the worst beer in the world, but not good."

"12 oz bottle. Pours amber with some white head and a soda like carbonation and not much lacing. Nose is similar to lemonade. Body is thin and watery. Taste includes some sweetness followed by an abrupt dryness, there is a slight hint of hops. Nice sinkhole beer."

"This is perfect for filler. Nothing to love or hate."
"I guess this is better than regular Michelob Ultra, but there really isn't anything here that would make it worth drinking again."
"Interesting sidenote: I offered a taste to someone who only drinks light, just as a test, not telling her what it was. She usually hates the beers I drink, but she liked this one."
"O-very crisp beer, but if you don't focus on the taste, you'll quickly forget it has one. there are no real negative qualities other than an overall lack of flavor, but it is very, very easy to drink."
"D: Better than most of the light crap out there but in no way a worthy beer."
"Taste was thin, even though I wasn't expecting it to be chewy by any means. Light corn and caramel taste, thin seems to be the operative word in this review. But its a light beer, and for the weird dichotomy of drinking beer and counting calories, this is one of the dare I say superior choices in such a conundrum. I don't see why they can't have hops in the beer though, I mean, those aren't going to add caloricly speaking, I think."
"As far as the new ""ultra light"" beers go (ie. Bud Select, MGD 64, Select 55, ect...) this is probably one of the better ones I've had."
"Cheers"
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a light brown color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is mild, some faint malts. Taste is also mild, some malts, a touch of bitterness, nothing special but not the worst light beer I have tasted. Feels light in the mouth and has average drinkability. Overall not that bad as far as light beers go."
"D- Better than a lot of macro light beers, refreshing summertime beer, but nothing to write home about."
"Pours a nice amber color, nice carbonation, with a nice one-finger plus white head, with some nice sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, very light hop note, with some funky corn/rice notes. The taste is sweet, malty, but with the classic macro taste. Light body. Not Drinkable, started off pretty good, but still not worth buying again."
"A suggestion: Drink this beer while munching on some peanuts (allergens, or lack thereof, provided). It compliments them so well. Not really sure why...but just try it. I'm not a health freak and I like my beers heavy and calorie-laden. But on the off-chance that I go work out and need to re-hydrate afterward, I'll definitely reach for a Mich Ultra Amber...or five."
"D: I like this beer way better than the regular ultra or the fruity flavored ultras. If I were forced to choose a low calorie beer, this would be the one."
"Pours a moderate amber brown with a slight off white head. Leaves behind a tad bit of lacing. Nose brings forth some amber malt and grain husks. Taste is pretty weak. Really not much going on here. Feel is light; too light. Drinks okay and is one of the better $4.99 six packs around, but nothing too special."
"Overall what can you say, I knew what this one was going to be going in and my opinion was about dead on. Not the worst by far, nut nothing really interesting either."
"drinkability: ehh, its not tough to drink, but i'd choose others over this."
"Adjunct flavors begin to rear their ugly head in the flavor and are mildly offset by a watery caramel presence. Carbonation level is high and the mouthfeel is expectedly thin. Really not much flavor at all, but it is probably better than three-quarters of light lagers. Grainy cardboard comes out as it warms up and goes progressively downhill from there."
"Update 5/23/10 - They've reformulated this to lower the calories further. It's been reduced from 114 calories to 95 and the alcohol was cut from 5% to 3.2%. Unfortunately this came at the expense of taste. It's pretty watery tasting now. Not much different than regular Mich Ultra. While I was pleasantly surprised with the original formula, this new one is really bad."
"I can't stand Michelob Ultra, but I really do enjoy the amber version. I'm so tired of most light beers, so this is a nice change of pace. It's a very light beer with decent taste. I buy this pretty often, and I suggest it to my friends. I don't want to try the other flavored Ultras though, they scare me."
"Unfortunately, not even as good as your typical BMC swill."
"Poured into a 12oz glass and was in no danger of spilling a drop. Theres virtually no head, and anything that did form, was gone after I blinked. I wouldn't call the color amber...if anything is was a slightly darker shade of normal FYB. Smell was tinny and metallic with some sort of malt-like smell. This tasted awful, like stagnant carbonated water. Has the feel too of water...I'd rather drink water. You can chug this, which is the only reason it didn't get a 1....but why would you want to?!?!?! Maybe my girlfriends dad will drink the rest of the sixer...."
"D: Just another lawn mowing beer."
"drinkability is ok - if you are watching your carbs this might be the beer for you"
"From bottle to shaker Aug 13, 2009. Pours a light clear amber with minimal head, diminishing. Well, let's just say it is what it is: a very light beer with a bit more pizzaz and flavor than regular ultra. A clear choice over its bland sister if these are the only two you have to choose from. Other than that - well I just would not purchase."
"d- pretty drinkable, it's tastier than i thought, but by no means 'tasty' by my normal standards, i would drink again as a light lager, it's much better than the light adjuncts."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: The body of the beer is carbonated wateryness. The beers drinkability rates a 3 based on the ease of drinking the beer. Honestly it would bore me too much to have more than one of these in a week."
"Saw this and was intrigued, I've had watery brew before (ultra), but amber watery brew may be different. Plus the temps are climbing and a good refresher is always needed. First off looking at the carbs it actually has about 50% more than Ultra, hmmm interesting. Smells like an amber brew, not outstandingly but it's there. Pours to an light amber color with a nice head. Taste is thin but does have hints of an amber brew with a slight maltiness and a mild twang of hops. Carbonation isn't too high but due to the lack of backbone does override the flavor. This is definitely not a connoisseur's beer. But I doubt any connoisseur is going to buy a self proclaimed low carb brew. It is what it is. I rate it what it proclaims to be, not even next to one of my red ale homebrews. For wicked hot weather working outside, this would be tough to top. Although at 5% AC I wouldn't be wielding a chainsaw."
"Cheers."
"Why drink this when you can go for a regular amber ale? If you like your beer as close to water as possible, this may be for you. I can't be too sure."
"D: Very drinkable since there was very little taste and it was very light feeling."
"I've had a lot worse lite beers, and this really isn't that bad. Not great mind you, not particularly good either, but not bad, drinkable, and okay. The beer certainly looks good with an amber color, loads of efforvescence and carbonation. The carbonation is prodigious. There is a fairly creamy head that laces and retains well. I'm surprised by that. The nose on the beer is better than most adjunct lagers. There is a dextrin sweetness, some sweet maltiness that is hard to pin down with specificity, a slight earthy and musty aroma too. The beer is creamy, ultra light, watery, sweet, with no real flavor. I can see why people drink this. You could down lots of these because there is just not much body, taste, character, or hop presence in the beer. It is a carbonated, malty beverage that is largely inoffensive. That's about all you can say. The ""amber"" in the name is in reference to the color of the beer and nothing more."
"Dad handed me a bottle, so what are you gonna do. The beer is a clear golden color with a compact white head that gives up the ghost quickly. Minimal lacing. Faint grainy malt aroma. Light seltzer water body with light grain and malt flavors. The finish is absolutely flavorless unless you call bubbles a flavor. Truly a beer for people who do not like beer."
"After drinking it I realized why it's discontinued, but mostly I was confused why was it even bottled and sold to the public. Not a good beer at all. Very light tasting, which is not what you expect or want in an amber at all. A weird aftertaste, no good feel, just a poor beer all around."
"drinkability: very easy. better than alot of low carb beers."
"D 4.5 - this is a very solid session light beer, great price, great on calories, and great on ABV @ 5.0%. This beats all other light American Lagers - HANDS DOWN! If you like light beers with more character, than this is your beer! Try it. It is my first pick if I am on a session of light beers with hig ABV but still have some decent taste."
"After drinking a few Michelob Ultra's I was ready to be disappointed here. I was pleasantly surprised. This one had a decent appearance and what is this... taste! There's some good flavors going on here and it's enjoyable and flavorabble to drink. Granted it can be a lot better, but its cheap, tastes good, what else can you want?"
"So uh yeah. If you're thirsty, this is not offensive. But it is really lacking taste. I've had water with more taste than this."
"Who would have guessed this was a light beer? It's not as obviously watered down like others, but one bottle will do me just fine."
"Notes: Overall it has a simple clean flavor with a light body that's easy drinking. Also I would say that it is a little bit better than the regular Michelob Ultra."
"The taste was very mild. Watered down. It was smooth, but simply for the fact that there was not that much taste."
"Drinkability - Who are they fooling? This is Michelob Ultra with a little added coloring agent. Don't waste your time or money."
"However, it is definitley a step up from the regular, and if I had to choose between the two, this one would get my vote for sure!"
"Overall, this is a nearly inoffensive beer. DMS and adjust lager aroma pull this down from what might otherwise pass as a bland mild. The appearance is a reddish amber with no head retention and like I said, the aroma, well, stinks like cheap beer. The taste has a caramel note with pale biscuit undertones. This pairing of real beer flavors almost makes up for the aroma, but still can't qualify it as ""good beer."" Easy enough to drink and I wouldn't turn a free one down, but I'd never order this."
"Drinkability: Not recommended."
"Michelob Ultra Amber is very lacking in taste, very light in body, and very dull and lifeless overall. I actually like some of the Michelob specialty brews and I was hoping that Ultra Amber would be a decent beer. But unfortunately, this is a light beer in the truest sense, with little body and taste and little or nothing in its composition that is noteworthy or memorable."
"Nonetheless, not bad for a big American Macro., just pour a few ounces at a time into your glass to keep ahead of your consumption."
"I really didn't enjoy the original Michelob Ultra, but had hopes that the Amber would come with more flavor. The color was an improvement over the original Ultra which I found odd even for a macro. No real smell and no real head. Taste may actually me less than the original Ultra. There is a slight sweetnes to this that is not present in the original. I can see the value of this for mass consumption (read getting drunk) but still not as flavorful as I expected."
"I tried this in hopes that the amberness would over power the macroness. Once again I was wrong, very very wrong. The color is a cross between yellow and amber. It has, or once had a fizzy off white head. The nose is of artificial sugars and ricey malts. The taste is also very artificial and cloying. Not much of a hop or malt base to it. A decent body is not too carbonated. I guess I could drink this if a gun was to my head."
"AB-- I was hoping for more in your premium brand!"
"For a light lager, I found this to be very drinkable. Granted, it's definitely not my style (see my other reviews), but I have to give them credit for trying to add a little character to an otherwise bland style."
"My fiancee had a few laying around after a party so I decided to try it. This brew tastes more like a product of chemicals mixed together than from fresh ingredients. Not really sure why people buy this but I guess to each their own."
" The bigger malt flavor is appreciated...this would be an o.k choice if you find yourself at a Frat party."
"Crap. Only tried a bottle of this so I could rate it. Why doesnt Anheuser-Busch consolidate their pale lager offerings since they all suck? Stuff is nasty. Had a chemical metallic taste that made it undrinkable. Avoid like the plague. If you are weight-conscious you can do much better than this."
"Well where should I begin. Im not that much of a technical reviewer so here it goes. somewhat technical but not like some people. ok so here it goes. this beer is just somewhat darker than mich ultra or budweiser or (fill in the blank ricey pisswater beer here). same quickly disappearing head as most macros with no lacing whatsoever. the taste...well is there any?? the taste is kinda lilke amber bock mixed with mich ultra to create a beer with a little more flavor than reguar mich ultra but not as much as amber bock or mich lager. what can I say I bought this to switch things up (as in the realm of my budget beers) normally I try to stay away from all macros period favoring Paulaner Salvator Dopplebock or a classic Sam Adams Boston Lager. Final verdict on Mich Ultra Amber: This beer sucks!!!"
"D - Steer clear of this one, it has NO flavor!"
"Amber colored beer with quickly fading foam head.Aroma and taste are your typical corn or cooked veggies macro that has been waterd down to make it a light beer.With that being said it was fresh and enjoyable.I would definetly prefer this to any micro on a hot day or family barbeque.It is just as advertised a light low calories beer!!"
"Almost a little confused when I took notes for the review. I kinda liked it, but kinda didn't like it..if thats possible. Might try it this summer, out on a lawnchair, in the sun."
"For what it is worth, this beer really accompished what it is inteaded to do, This beer has a some what decent taste to it, of all the Michelob products, I would have to say this one is the second most impressive beer they offer. good job on offering a ultra light beer with some taste."
"The bottle is pretty much the same color as the beer w/ a cheesy clear decal. Don't bother pouring into a glass, but if you do, hold the dark, amber beer to the light and watch it pass through like a glass w/ coke and ice. I am generous with the taste rating, as if you compared this to most dark beers it would finish last in a contest. But, the little taste of anything it offers (there is some malt in there) is smooth and leaves no aftertaste. Honestly, a decent choice for dollar draft night or if you're watching the game and want a few. Its best aspect is the very low cal and fat content, so if you're like me and on a diet a couple of these every now and then don't hurt at all."
"Probably won't buy again, go with Amber Bock instead."
"I haven't yet figured out the various scores, but given the way the percentages are assigned, I wouldn't be surprised if the beer that I like less well (this one) ends up being the winner of Macro Smackdown XXI. Yet another reason why my ideal would be for taste to be at least 50%, mouthfeel to be... oh never mind. Bottom line: Schell Light is the better beer no matter what the final scores say."
"D: This beer isn't horrible compared to other light beers. This is one I bought just to try. I doubt I'll buy it again."
"this was a decent beer, poured a golden color, and tasted like all of the common american pale lagers out there. A very bland beer to some aspect, but if your looking for somthing a little cheap and quick buzz. then this would be your best bet. I would expect better from anheuser busch, but they did ok in this realm."
"Drinkability would be better if it was completely flat instead of fizzy, then you could more easily chug it on a hot day like the alcohol-delivery malt-based beverage that it is. This is the beer industry's answer to ""craft"" beer: it looks like craft beer but tastes like nothing. Kind of like Trelane's fireplace that gave off no heat. That didn't fool the Enterprise crew, and this ""beer"" shouldn't fool you."
"Middle of the road light beer....Certainly not at the level of the SA light but this ""amber"" does have more taste than the regular ultra. But, it is still not as flavorful as I was hoping for. Would consider buying again..."
"if i were slumming, i would spend my non-money on something that delivers what it says it does, like Mickey's or PBR. If i wanted a darker lager, then Id go with Honey Brown. If you don't want carbs, dont drink beer."
"I won't go into a detailed review...it's a low carb beer that actually tastes like a beer. Amazing."
"I don't much like this beer."
"Next time, water or tea for me."
"Overall, a pretty weak beer. I won't be drinking many of these in the future."
"Typical of the Macro styles of today."
"drinkability isn't bad, it goes down like water. hmmm... i don't know what to think... it really does taste more like beer than most light beer, but in a really watered down way, as opposed to most light beer, which tastes like watered down crap beer. so i gues it gets a thumbs up for trying."
"I have seen Light beers with better appearence i mean with a darker color...smell is'nt something to be crazy about...it taste different from the regular Michelob ultra it have a little bit of sweetnes in the flavor ,like a far honey flavor good for a hot sunday."
"Overall a low carb beer. That's it. Maybe a little flavor thrown in, but thats it. It is what it is."
"For a light beer, this actually has a decent amount of flavor. I guess if I was going to consider a light beer I may choose this one. It's actually tolerable. Personally, I don't drink light beers because I'm not trying to watch my weight, and if I was, I wouldn't be drinking beer at all. If you must, try this one."
"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, beer is a clear, amber-copper color with small amounts of carbonation rising from the bottom of the glass to the thin head on top. Smell is primarily quite grainy, corn, amber malts only slightly. There is almost no taste to this beer, a slight grainy malt taste and a minute amount of hops. Beer is very light in body as expected and has an average amount of carbonation. This is a drinkable beer, but just because you can do something doesn't necessarily mean you should."
"I would recommend this beer to those who like Michelob Ultra,, but want more flavor. Beston draft!"
"I'm not one to taste, chew and enjoy light beers, but I try them, and every now and then, I find one passable. This was not that beer. It was way light, amber touch, almost water. Smell was a little like a generic beer, with a little sharpness from the slight hops, there really wasn't anything else. Mouth, beer. Generic. Average. Went down like a beer, this is Coors. Taste? Slight hops, hint that this is an amber, but water, water, Coors again. While not totally tasteless, I even have enjoyed NA's more than this , with Kaliber being a good amber NA that TASTES like an amber beer, not water."
"D-I'd much rather drink a budweiser not very good to drink."
"Not a good beer. Too carbonated. Has the body of 'water'. Hint of caramel is quickly destroyed by a carbonation bitter bite that destroys everything. Tastes flat and thin and in my opinion. Stick with Sam Adam's light and pay the extra 2.50 because that 2.50 gets you a much better six-pack of light beer. Not overtly horrible because it's so close to caramel water,..but definately not recommended! Even Miller lite has more body....which makes me wonder how they got this color?"
"I tried this one...not really because I wanted too...it was just handed to me. Rather flat tasting, no real flavor..just a little caramelization...slight bitter from that...other than that...no real flavor...I was hoping it would be as good as the amber boch offering ab has...but..no where near as flavorful..was very dissapointed...since i have tried a few of the new seasonals they offer on draft and like them...will not buy this one."
"One of the better light beers I've had. Appearance is a light amber with a very thin head that dissipates very quickly. Not much of a smell other than standard swill beer, but the taste is slightly sweet with a better kick than most light beers. A little grainy, but not that bad. I'd suggest this over Bud Light and Coors Light in a heartbeat."
"The new look of light beer! Hooray! It still sucks..."
"D- Only marginally better than regular Ultra but that isn't saying much. If the odd sweetness wasn't there, it would be easier to drink more of it but I could hardly finish this one without gagging. If you must drink a light beer, try something else."
"D- Wouldn't do it too much. Diet beer is gross."
"Even for a light macro, this one is just a half-hearted attempt (at best) to put some flavor in an ""ultra"" light that falls short. I don't need to lose weight, but even if I did I wouldn't drink this one. It has no real flavor or character. A neighbor offered this one to me- figured I would give it a try - glad I didn't spend money on it."
"Michelob Ultra Amber was a clear amber color with a medium sized white head that managed to stick around for a couple of minutes. The nose was not bad, but was extremely light. The taste was light as well, a little sweet upfront, a slight twang, and a dry finish. The mouthfeel was very watery with a fairly high amount of carbonation. Overall this beer sucks. The only thing that it has going for it is the initial appearance, and then it was all downhill after that."
"the drinkability was rather good, not because of the great taste, it just went down rather easily"
"Thin and watery, no better than it's ultra brother."
"Is this a light beer designed to make it look like you are drinking a decent beer? I guess that makes it ""drinkable"" to the AB crowd."
"Michelob Ultra Amber pours a dark honey color with a white head from a brown twelve ounce bottle. Smells like adjunct, mild in general. Very watery mouthfeel, some metallic notes at the end. This stuff hardly tastes like anything. I think I'd rather drink water. Not recommended."
"Overall: A lot better than I expected. Not good, but not bad, either."
"Overall, it may wake up Michelob Ultra drinkers taste buds, but not many others."
"When the bartender poured it into a 12oz. mug, the beer was a clear amber color with at least a 1 finger head of white foam. It was probably the way they poured it, but it was still very nice to see that. The head of foam had good retention and left plenty of white sticky lace around the mug. I kept trying to get an aroma out, but there really wasn't anything there except for maybe a slight and I mean slight aroma of watered down hops. I was actually quite surprised by the taste. There still wasn't much there, but this beer had way more taste than their regular Ultra. This beer had the taste of water, little sweet malt, and a light taste of some rice and corn. The mouthfeel was very light and with a slight taste of something, I just don't know what it was. It was probably the corn and rice. Drinkability? For me, No! If it was really cheap and there was nothing else there, then maybe. I'm just glad that it had more taste and color than regular Ultra."
"An average light beer. They miss-use the Amber in the name to quite an extent. This beer would be pale yellow, if the additional coloring was not added. Try one of these just for the review."
"Ran out of beer at Dad's, he had some of this left over. Cringing I grabbed on for the experience and he laughed at me. This looked fine except it was watery and the bubbles made the head look like soda. It smelled like a light lager with a touch of extra toasty malt, but it still had that stale cooked corn smell. The taste was sex in a canoe. Carbonated water with a splash of coloring and flavor additives. You could drink this but it doesn't mean you should."
"Drinkability: Sure you can drink this, but why? Got this on sale on a whim, because I have a need to at least try everything once. This beer was made for yuppie people to go ""Hey look at me! I'm drinking a dark beer!"" Well, woopty do. Either this is watered down Amber Bock or Ultra with food coloring."
"Eh... as macros go it ain't to bad. Sort of like Budweiser with food coloring, but nothing I'd buy again unless I was given it for free."
"overall, a decent beer to bring a case of to your friends block party this summer..."
"Overall: The best thing you can say about this beer is that it might get people to try something different. And if that somehow leads them down the road to beer advocacy, then that's a good thing. Other than that, though, there's nothing special about this at all. It's better than your standard macro light lager, but not by a lot."
"I promise you my wife just had to buy this tonight. What the heck, it looked actually pretty good. Very clear and crisp with lots of carbonation and thin lacing. And then down hill . . . a little taste of grassy hops that made it difficult to finish even the smallest portion. After just making a pretty good Fat Tire amber clone in my homebrew, this one may look better, but that's all."
"I'm kind of torn on this one. It's a low carb brew that enters the realm of something different than just ""beer flavor"". For that, I give 'em mad props, for atleast trying it. Sure, it's not some super-dee-duper awesome brew or anything, but for what it is, I think it's ok. It's refreshing and goes down easy, which is what a very light beer should be. Ofcourse, I think they did this one a bit too conservatively, so it really doesn't have a chance to ""offend"" anyone. Overall, it's an ok brew. Something I'll enjoy plenty of during the summer months."
"light amber in appearance, with a strange orange tinge, makes it look like liquid rust for some reason. Small bubbly white head. Quite a fruity/sweet malty aroma, not that bad considering the source. In taste it is sweet, highly carbonated, slight beer taste, very soda-like in mant aspects reminds me of the cans of ""Bass Shandy"" i used to get as a kid back in the UK..but that was 0.5% this is 5% really? Light water filled mouthfeel. To be honest this wasnt quite as bad as I expected..if it were hot outside and iwas working this would be ok."
"Drinkability is slightly better than your average macro light, but still has a ways to go before I would want to drink more."
"As far as Macro's go this one ain't half bad. The color is a light amber with just a hint of red. The smell is very slightly spiced. The taste is like a light beer but with a touch of spices. The mouthfeel is where this one is seperated from the other mass produced beers. There is no harsh bitterness. It is a fairly smooth beer. The drinkability is very good. This beer is brewed to be a light session beer and it certainly is that. I could session these all night."
"Final Thought: Better than most light beers, so it is worth a shot to all you ""yuppies"" that think drinking this non-beer matters in the calorie count."
"Pours pale amber/orange with good clarity. A soapy/fizzy off-white head of three-fingers shows very poor retention and scarce-spotty lacing. Cereal adjunct and light toasted amber malt nose - weak overall with no detectable hops. The flavor is similar; semi-sweet corn/rice flavor upfront, then faint malt character comes on and fades in the same instant. Nil aftertaste. Highly carbonated and thin bodied turns out overly crisp; but still not enough to hide the off-flavor. The finish is mostly clean but the taste seems forced and fake. This seems to be an attempt to produce both light and malty flavor simultaneously and it ends up failing to achive either."
"Mouthfeel is light and fizzy, the touch of sweet increases drinkability over the regular Ultra. Very easy to toss back and actually enjoyable after a long day of laying ceramic tile."
"Got a case of this stuff for my wife...I hope she enjoys it because there AIN'T MUCH THERE! Tough sell on this one ."
"For a light, macro made beer, this is not bad. Pours to a medium orange brownish/gold color with a head of white foam that did have staying power. Some lacing. Medium level of carbonation. Aromas of grass and mildly sweet malts. Taste was fair enough; traces of hops dance over a bland, yet sweetened malty character. Oddly, not too bad. Mouthfeel was like having carbonated water sloshing about in my mouth. Could be nice on a wicked hot summer day, but on a early spring day in Detroit, it doesn't do much. Drinkability is north of average. This is better than it's original sister, but not an amazing beer by any stretch. Try it if you like... don't expect a world of flavor, maybe just a town of taste."
"...stressing... for a macro brew light beer."
"D- oh yeah, i'm drinking this again...not."
"I really don't see why people are so critical of this beer. I know it kind of sucks but for what it is and what it's supposed to be, it's not that bad. Definitely has an amber color to it with a glowing white head and steady carbonation rising to the top. Looks a little too fizzy. Minimal lacing. Smells somewhat grainy and adjuncty. Flavor is better with stronger caramel malty notes and a bready texture. Still rather thin and bubbly from the carbonation. I couldn't drink too many of these but they are much more flavorful than most light lagers and this one still is quite clean. It has its place."
"Nice amber color to it. Fair sized white head with non-stop pearling. It looks pretty good. Aroma is a tad sweet and thin. Not much going on. Taste is the same a sweet start with a light bitter middle and a dry finish and yes watery on the tongue. Overall ok, nothing I would buy but for freeit was ok."
"At the end of the day, it's still a lite beer though, and I'd rather not drink it. But still, it wasn't bad. Wasn't bad at all."
"That something, strangely enough, is a Killians. All the things they could have made this taste like, and they go for a Michelob/Killians mix. A bit dissapointing really."
"Bottom line: just because it's ""Amber"" doesn't mean it's good."

"I was over at a buddy's house checking out new kegerator...and this is what he had hooked up. Poured a pale amber color slight red hues. Thin cap that dissipated quickly. He keeps his kegerator at 38 degrees, so the smell wasn't much. But had a slightly better than your basic macro corn and filler smell. But more of the same. The taste was full of carbonation, very watery, not much sweetness and a very slight hopiness at the end. This is a good beer if you are going for quantity not quality when you need to entertain."
"Mouthfeel is light with the same stingy carbonation that I mentioned in the flavor. This beer is just utterly lacking in any redeeming qualities. I can't even finish the rest of my glass, it's not drinkable in the least. I don't understand why this even exists. One of the worst beers to ever touch my lips. I'm not sure what is worse, the radio ad campaign or the beer itself. Seriously avoid at all costs, this is not worth your time or money."
"Poured out a brownish and bubbly amber , not much of a head. Bottle looks kinda kewl , wish the beer inside it was better. Smell is very light grain and adjunct. Taste is similar to regular ultra , not much taste at all. It is a little smoother and has a tiny bit of malt presence that regular ultra doesn't. Didn't taste any hop flavors. Slightly sweet aftertaste that quickly vanishes. This is drinkable( chuggable) but its just not got any flavor. I wouldn't buy it but i would grab it before a bud light or mich ultra reg. at a party."
"I was eating potatoes chips with onion dip so it didn't taste that bad after potato chips. Better than a soda and with less sugar."
"Hanging at a bar in Weirton what are you going to order to drink? Well I went with the beer that at least I could get a review on, even if it's an Ultra low carb amber. Appears Caramel amber with a white frothy head leaves scattered thin lace. Aroma is slightly toasted malt touch of caramel mild creamy note touch of generic hop profile. Taste is ultra light on flavor with a weird sweetness and clean low hop bitterness. Mouthfeel is once again ultra light airy with artificial infused carbonation. Drinkability well, I can't taste my beer it's alright I was just giving it a shot but more of the same shite from the big boys."
"This seltzer water somehow had a 5% abv, it was made to give a buzz to the <active people> w/o having to actually drink anything. Thank God it was a freebie, I can't imagine paying hard earned cash for this crap."
"I'll see if maybe later, I can come up with more constructive critiques and comments-- once I'm back from the E.R."
"My fiancee tried this as well, she indicated that she needed a stout to wash the taste of this beer out of her mouth."
"It was the only thing that the sports bar offered that I had not already tried. I should have gone with something else--anything else. The beer lacks optomism, comming straight from the bottle. lightly browned, thin, fizzy carbonation...it looks like watered down cola. Aromas are faint but do resemble true malt, caramel, and nuts. Flavors don't hold the same promise as the aroma: grainy, husky, and vegetable flavors persist without the malt backbone to balance or mask the negative characters. Watery from the very first sip and never firms up. Finishes thin, grain, and husk like. Even for an American light beer, this is bad."
"Cheers!"
"Humor is great but why do they think Neanderthals are the only ones that drink beer? This reminds me of low-carb pasta ... why eat something that tastes like utter crap because you are trying to watch you weight? Live for today ... don't drink low-carb or light beer."
"Just another gimmick beer from A-B. Color is actually quite pretty but that is where the positives end. Nice light mahogany brown color, good clarity, fleeting but substantial head with a hard pour. But don't let the color fool you, there is little to no flavor here. As a homebrewer I can tell you that it is quite easy to influence the color of a beer without hitting the taste. It would not take much more than a pound of specially malted barley to color a large batch of beer. Homebrewers use these darker roasted malts in higher percentage to gain a roasted or caramel depth to ales and lagers. While quite clean tasting, I can barely perceive a toasted malt character or breadiness to this beer. Wearing a blindfold I would have a hard time distinguishing this from any light beer. Smell is sweet, and slightly alcoholic with a yeasty touch. Very little hop bitterness or aroma. Looks good poured in a glass so if you are shooting to impress someone with drinking darker beer, and can't stand something like a Sam Adams Boston Lager, choose this."
"Razor thin body with soda-like carbonation and a watery mouthfeel. Gross."
"In terms of light beers only Sam Adams light comes to mind as being an altogether hands down better beer."
"Overall this does have some taste, but i think i will pass on this for now on (i am just a sucker for trying new macro shit). I'm used to other crap beers' taste, so i'll just stick with that if i have too- but i wouldnt knock anyone for buying this over mich. light, bl, ml, or cl."
"Over-all, this beer should do ok for them. I would Never order an Ultra, but thisone I could see myself ordering if the choice was slim and thisone stood out."
"Purchased a six pack the other day out of couriosity. Pours a light amber copper color with a nice head that quickly dissipates. No lacing. Some faint caramel malt aroma. Taste is slightly malty, similar to their Amber Bock just watered down. At least there is some taste as opposed to Mich Ultra. Mouthfeel is a little thin and watery. At 5% ABV, some taste and 114 calories, AB may have a winner on their hands as far a light beers go. I think I will let the wife have the other 5 though."
"I would like to thank my beer guy for giving me a case for free. However, even my guests dont want them for free because the people who drink Mich. Ultra typically drink it because they dont like the taste of beer. So, they drink that (which doesnt have much of a beer taste at all). The people who typically drink amber beers and others beers like it want a real amber or dark beer, not fizzy water. I think that they missed the mark on this one. I understand what they are trying to do, but I dont think that they did it very well. Again thanks for the free beers Mr. Beer Delivery Guy, but.no. Dont get me wrong, I love beer, especially the free kind, but next time.give me something different please."
"I problely won't buy again."
"This is a another attemp to bring a different type of light beer to the masses. This beer has a little more flavor than most light beers. Good amber color, the carbonation is just right, slight malt taste but as usual with the typical weak waterdown flavor of a light beer. It is one of the better light beers out there but when you compare it to a another amber light like Sam Adams it falls way short . The best thing you can say about this beer it is easy to drink ."
"Pours copper with a very small off-white head which fades quick and leaves no lacing. Light caramel malts in the aroma..no hop profile whatsoever. Thin is the understatement of the year here. The flavors don't blend well and it's too weak to have the word ""amber"" attached to it. A beer aimed for the masses, this misses it's mark and joins the ranks of other ""Ultra"" beers."""
"Drinkability: Easy to drink... just like water! Still, it's not offensive, and I'd rather have it and a fair amount fewer calories than a bad beer with a lot of calories. But I'd rather have a good beer, no doubt about it."
"From a retail standpoint, I'm sure that this beer will sell, it does apeal to the Ultra drinker."
"Drinkability: I could drink a lot of these, say on a boat or in the sun playing softball as a thirst quencher if that's what was served but I wouldn't choose it over almost any other options."
