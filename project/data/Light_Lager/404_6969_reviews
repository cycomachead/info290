"It's light in body, sure, but crisp and decently clean considering.  It bites, even going almost bubbly, but it isn't all that far off from smooth."

"This is the only light beer I've had that I couldn't tell was light. All but impossible to find in Seattle,  oh how I wish it weren't so. If it were in every corner store I'd be drinking a pack every other night.  Good job Dixie!"

"The Dixie Jazz is a smooth easy drinking beer. It poured a clear yellow color with thin white head that is not leaving a lacing. I am not sure why they call this an light amber when it is yellow in color. The scent is more malty. The taste is evenly balanced....nothing spectacular. The mouthfeel is lighter in body with good carbonation. Overall this is ok."

"O: Tastes more like a AAL than a Light Lager which is can be read as a positive in my opinion since the majority of Light Lagers have minimal amounts of taste and a watery body. Not overly interesting but I was not really expecting that for the style, I could have more than one of these and it light be good for a summer outdoor event."

"Erp. I don't know what this particular offering was like when originally brewed in Cajun country, but I can't imagine that it would have been worse than this dreck. A sugary mess, one for which I lack the cajones to recommend to annny-one."

"Overall, refreshing beer! Seek it out today. If I was focused on finding a good light beer, I would commit to a six pack."

"One more surprising note... this beer actually improves as it gets warmer. This is not normally the M.O. for a macro style beer (which normally improves with being cold), but that's how I see it."
"The body was thin, as it should be for the style, but I dinged it a bit for having a sticky finish that was mildly unpleasant. Drinkability was kind of blandly meh. Overall, this would probably make an OK lawnmower beer, but that's about it. Even at that, you could make a better choice."

"O: This beer isn’t bad for the style and has some body from the malts but the taste isn’t very interesting, especially with the flavors of corn adjuncts."

"O - This is what happens when ticking goes bad I finished the bottle only because I paid bar prices for it otherwise it would've been a drain pour its horrible do yourself a favor and stay away from this beer"
"By no means are these flavors bold and hearty--at 92 calories a bottle, there's no way this brew could keep up with the massive sugar-driven fares of, say, Imperials--but they are well-balanced and nicely nuanced. Budweiser could learn a thing or two from beers like this."
"The flavor is sweet but is mainly bean like. The body is a red-amber color. The aroma is sweet but reminds me of grass. The head poured tan at about a finger and a half that goes away fast. Other than the bean flavor it is a very mild flavored beer. The body is thin and fizzy."
"Overall, this is only a step up from the mass produced ""light beer"". I would like to see what this brewery could do with a true amber or lager."
"Pours a very pale amber color with a quickly diminishing head. The scent already eludes that the taste is going to be that of a cheap beer. There is at least some flavor of so wheat and malts but it is very comparable to that of Miller Lite or Bud Light. Drinks rather fast with no real texture or volume to the beer. This is one you can skip."
"D: Just an average beer. It's easy to drink, but not much is going on. Overall it's nothing special."
"D: This is an OK beer. The lightness makes it an easy drinker. It does have more flavor than other beers of its ilk."
"The beer pours a very clear yellow color with a white head. The aroma is strong buttery popcorn. The flavor is very thin with some corn, honey and butter. Light body and medium carbonation. There is not much going on in this beer. This is one to avoid."
"D. Not saying that I would never drink one again, but I won't go seek this one out."
"Pours a copperish color with a small white bubbly head. The aroma is of caramel malt and a little roasted malt. The taste is of caramel malt and a small hint of bananas. The mouthfeel is dry and crisp. The drinkability is good, you could have it as a session beer, nothing to make you dislike this beer, but nothing to completely keep you interested."
"Drinkability: I have graded for the style and as a American Adjunct Lager, I would take this over most. It is nice and light and sweet and has good flavoring. I could have six. A very decent beer. Outside of the style, I think this is a B-."
"D - This is an okay amber lager. I've certainly had better."
"D - This is an okay amber lager. I've certainly had better."
"D - It's an easy to drink beer because it isn't offensive unless you're easily offended by a superbly plain beer. Watery flavor and a passive aroma just add to this. Easy sessioner but you could find better to fill your gut with."
"Pours a golden red, with more red than gold hue showing through. Smell is biscuit malt with a bread aroma. The taste is at first dull and then your tongue is met with a biscuit malt flavor. There are no detectable hops or other spices. The mouthfeel is thin and watery with an upper medium level of carbonation. As it is only 4.13% ABV and a lighter beer it could be very sessionable, however I would look elsewhere due to the lack of taste."
"D: A little tasty, goes down ok, not too filling, mild kick, kind of different representation of style, it's listed as an ""Amber Light Beer"" on the label and while it's not like a typical fizzy yellow light beer, it's still not very good."
"Light bodied, reasonably smooth, drinkable ice cold. Not too bad for what it is - a semi-light mainstream lager."
"Drinkability: I believe it was Louis Armstrong that once said: ""If you have to ask what an instantly forgettable, bland light lager is, you'll never know."" Something like that."
"I can't finish this one and feel like I need to brush my teeth. Pass on this one."
"Still,not six pack worthy for me.Yet, if one has a BBQ with the friends and family then it's a decent beer to have around."
"D - I got about a third of the way through the bottle before I gave up. The taste was just too bad for me to keep drinking. Perhaps if it was really cold I could have half a bottle."
"Overall for a lite beer, I have to admit it was not terrible. I could do this one again in a pinch."
"One finger of white foam on top of a clear light amber body. Carbonation is pretty good. Very light smell and taste. No corn adjunct flavors, decent malt presence, little bit of bitterness but no real hop flavor. Overall a decent craft version of a predominately macro style."
"Pass on this one."
"Drinkability: This beer would be best cold as a thirst quencher on a hot day, otherwise not much for drinkability for this one."
"D - A beer that now that I have had it, I can say I don't want to have it ever again. A lawnmower beer sure, but there are beeter ones out there that also would do that job but with some flavor."
"Tastes pretty oxidized, but still drinkable. It most definitely tastes better than the Dixie lager. This is a pretty mild mannered beer that might be halfway decent if it was'nt like biting into some cardboard. Carbonation is high and there is a little bit of detectable hop bitterness. Fairly forgettable beer, but at 96 calories, I would give this a leg up on Michalob Ultra and the like."
"This beer poured a golden amber color with a one finger pillowy white head that receded rapidly, decent lacing. Nose is very grainy with notes of corn and pale malts and a bit of sweetness. Taste is bready and grainy. The sweetness in the nose filters to the taste as well but not well balanced. It sort of sneaks up on you. Mouthfeel is pretty carbonated, light and on the watery side. The beer goes down easily, but not balanced well. It was fun to try, but not one that I will pick up again."
" ~ This is a light amber brew. I don't think I've ever actually had one before. I do like the beer but there's something holding it back. I will recommend it to others just because of the style."
"Well what can I say, it has more flavor than BMC, but it is lacking in other areas as well. For a light beer at 92 calories I suppose it's pretty tasty."
"I must admit that this one aint good. I wanted to like it, but failed miserably."
"D: Although this isn't an exceptionally flavorful beer, it does go down easy. Would make a good session beer for a hot crayfish day."
"D - Shitty beer really."
"The new labels are definitely an improvement on the old labels (seen above). It's too bad that Dixie beer is still being brewed in Minnesota. It will be nice when the brewery is able to resume full operations down in the Crescent City where they belong. Bottom line: a great name but an average to slightly below-average beer."
"The feel is a bit watery, but that's kind of appropriate for style. Pleasant enough. An okay barley lager. Not amber at all though."
"12oz twist-off bottle poured into a pint glass. Pours a light orangish amber color with an off-white head. The aroma is sweet bready malt and a hint of caramel. There is not much flavor going on in the taste, but it certainly is a thirst quencher that could be consumed in large quantities. The mouthfeel is very thin and highly carbonated, very reminiscent of your typical macro lager. Overall, Dixie Jazz is what it is, a pretty flavorless lager that does not offend the masses, but will not satisfy most beer geeks."
"Nothing special at all. Been saving blackened voodoo for last. hope that was wise."
"Dixie Jazz pours a golden yellow with a white head from a brown twelve ounce bottle. There is a very mild malt aroma. There is kind of a grainy flavor, nothing especially interesting going on with this one. Kind of a dull bitter aftertaste that isn't particularly pleasant skicks around. I'd pass."
"There was a fairly decent, creamy feel to it at least, but overall this beer needs more of everything."
"Verdict: Starts out ok but then goes downhill in taste and mouthfeel. Would give it points for not being a typical light lager but it's not enough to pull it up."
"D: Overall a very sweet, fruity beer with some citrus and lots of carbonatation. a tweener or micro with training wheels."
"Overall, not so good. reminds me of a low carb beer. I'd say pass on this one."
"Pours a slightly fogged orange amber. A crème head forms and falls. Nose seems not that clean. Flavor matches with a not so smooth ride. Just seems to lack balance or a smooth flavor. Feel is nice, but who cares. This is one that you wouldnt miss much if you passed on it."
"Rather like carbonated water, there is hardly any ""beer"" going on here. ""Only 92 calories..."" Whatever...They might as well add - and hardly any flavor. They need to ""jazz"" it up a bit..."
"Drinks a bit slow, too much cornyness. Very run of the mill, If you find it cheap & during summer you may like this better than I did"
"Overall impression: This is a very mediocre beer - not much in the way of flavor. I'll be drinking the rest of this six pack out of the bottle, and not thinking about it too much."
"Pours out to a darker orange amber color with a ""Dr. Pepper"" head of foam that dissipated very quickly. Aromas of malts and sweet corn and gran. Not bad. Taste is bland and unexciting, but really, expectations shouldn't be all that high; malt, grain, slight spice, a touch of hops. Mouthfeel was like water. Drinkability is nearly non-existant. Very boring."
"Moderate to light body, not worth drinking again. Maybe a good one for bud light fans. In fact, I know who I can unload the other five bottles to now!"
"The beer pours a nice amber color with a 1/2"" offwhite head that fades to lacing. The aroma is average. It has a weak malty scent that boasts of pale malts, adjuncts, and light crystal malts. It has a sweet aroma with a musty character; not very appealing. The taste is awful. It is like drinking a glass of water with half a Killians dumped into it. It has little beer flavor. It goes down like water and finishes dry and metallic. The mouthfeel is terrible. It is an extremely low bodied beer with good carbonation. This beer was made for easy drinking. The problem is, it's too weak to be enjoyable. It doesn't even taste like beer. Two thumbs down."
"from the bottle poured amber wit off white head. aroma malts, caramel, molasses, grapes, apple, raisins just plain fruity. flavor weak caramel, metallic, hints of sour grapes, apples and some other strange flvor that I can not pin point. it did have a smooth mouth feel."
" Im not sure whats Jazzy about this brew, they should of named it Storm Surge. It would of fit better!"
" I would not recommend even trying this one stay away!!."
"Comments: Not too good. I liked the appearance  nice color and the head lasted for the entire beer. Smell was horrid. Taste wasnt too bad, once the metallic taste went away. Yet another lesson from schoolteacher and biruchan. Hmmmwhere did they come up with their lesson plan?"
"This was a much prettier beer than I expected it to be. Copper/amber colored with a medium head that disappeared fast. It also blew the regular Dixie Beer to Hell, man that stuff was horrid. On to the negatives: It was not as good as the Crimson or Blackened Voodoo. While more flavorful and fuller bodied than most light beers, it was still a light beer and you can only squeeze so much out of that. Faint malt flavor and aroma was about all it had going for it."
