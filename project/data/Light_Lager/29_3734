I could have sworn I was drinkiing something akin to kiwi or grape seltzer water (not sure why I was getting fruity smells and tastes from this beer, but I was). I guess if you technically stretch the definition of beer far enough, it could conceivably be possible to include this beverage, but I'm not sure why you'd want to. Should be marketed as some sort of wine cooler thing because beer it really ain't. This beer is proof that if you spend enough time building a brand, people will buy almost anything. Lucky for me this can was a freebie which I attempted to consume for the purposes of doing a review. I finished slightly more than half, I thought that was doing pretty good.","AlCaponeJunior","Jun 16, 2014"

From more healthy days, WAY back, my top three beers were Warsteiner, Becks, and Michelob Light. I'm not supposed to drink ANY beer, but I sneak one every month or so. So far, the only beer that doesn't impact my physical conditions (on a ONE beer serving only basis) is Michelob Ultra. Admittedly, it doesn't have the qualities of a Warsteiner or a Becks (which would now yield me "Alley Oop" ankles, on one serving) but it does compare favorably (for me) to Michelob Light, my favorite American beer. Ultra is not one of my top three beers, but if I want to avoid painful swelling in my ankles & lower legs while enjoying a single beer a month...it is my ONLY beer and I am truly grateful for it. It is enjoyable, and that's what it's now all about, for me!","JamesD71","May 04, 2014"

They gave us all free bottles to try, and the funny thing is...after tasting the Michelob Ultra, we all ended up tossing the free Michelob and buying our own real beer.

Optimally cans can be inserted through the front zipper stashed in the jeans above the ski boots. The cans are often purchased by the "30" as they are assorted into a beautiful suitcase. In ones hands delicate fingers wrap effortlessly to ensure a tight grip. The feeling of holding a slender tall yet athletic can can only be compared to the exhilarating feel of yachting on the mediterranean after a grueling cycle through the dolomites. The taste is world renowned. Some have compared the taste to that of a very young yet well fed flamingo, oh how delicious they are. After consumption the body feels a great pleasure which has no equal. The smell brings ill prepared man to his knees for it is unrivaled.

Has a very pale yellow appearance which culminates in a flavor profile of some light malt meets corn, and a slightly watery note of virtually no hops to balance out the water flavor. Tastes to me like seltzer water with a very slight hint of Michelob Light, itself no beer of character. With the slightest hint of a floral grain note. I'd much rather drink a sip of a real lager beer or ale which is decent than this horrid swill if I had to watch carbs and calories. To me, this is punishment, not a reward after a hard workout. I regard this as a beer insult even to low end BMC swill. So, you have a low rating. For many of us, this would take a dozen to not make you want more. So, horrid value for the money.

If I'm going to just enjoy a beer with a full meal, I'm going with a quality non-light beer. To me, Ultra is in a class above Miller Lite, Coors Light, and Bud Light. Honestly, this beer is best enjoyed on a hot day or golfing or if you are trying to lose weight but don't want to throw your entire day's worth of calories out with a couple beers. I do think this beer gets a bit of a bad reputation by people that just discard it as a "chick beer" or "beer-flavored water". If you're drinking it, you have to realize that it is what it is. If you want mountains of flavor, this isn't the beer for you. However for a light beer I do think this one has a great taste. If you are debating whether to try it or not because you're afraid your manhood will be questioned, just try it for yourself and form your own opinion.","SDVargo","Oct 28, 2013"

Its crispness and wateriness are welcome characteristics on very hot afternoons. The thinness of its malt profile minimizes the nasty "skunk" flavors of American macro-lagers, making Ultra comparatively enjoyable. Indeed, I'd reach for a Michelob Ultra before any of the "big three" (Coors, Miller, Budweiser) or their light counterparts.","GMB","Oct 11, 2013"

Lots of bubbles continue to rise from the bottom to the surface; the head is almost non existant, no lacing but a soap like bubblineess. Smell is sweet corn and malts. Taste is sour and tart, light and watery, no discernible taste of hops or grains. I assume what I am tasting are the adjuncts; rice and corn. Mouthfeel is similar to soda water. This is a beer that you drink when you don't want to take any sort of enjoyment from the beer drinking experience, but then again no one drinks this for its taste. It's "diet" beer, but the low alcohol and crappy flavor nullify the fact that its lower calorie because you would have to drink several of these just to get a buzz, thereby equaling the calories you'd consume from drinking a quality beer. Basically It's what you drink when tap water isn't quite alcoholic enough for you.","Aaron_Ramson","Dec 14, 2012"

Aroma is of sweet, wet grass clippings. 1st sip is of club soda mixed with a splash of light beer. Mouthfeel is light and watery with a lively fizz from the bubbles...again, like club soda. Drinkability is high, but then so is that of...club soda. Overall, this beer was given to me for free and I still feel like I got ripped off. If you're that concerned about you calorie & carb intake, have a Diet Coke instead. Oh well, it was good for adding another rating.","CJfromPhilly","Mar 05, 2012"

After a semi-vigorous pour it produced a fairly thick foam, between 1 and 2 inches high. It was not to dense, more on the light and airy side (cloud like). It was pure white in color, and had a lasting power that was fairly decent; it finally fell to nothing around half glass. There was some lace present in the beginning but it ran down the sides and disappeared faster then the head. The aroma was on the light side, hints of grains, husks (corn) and a light malt, more sweet then malty. All and all the aroma was nothing outstanding but was crisp, light and airy, like the head that was produced. The taste was allot like the aromas, light, airy, and on the sweet side. Flavors of sweet light malt dominated along with a grainy husky corn presence all through the mouth from first sip on the lips and tongue to it made its way down the back of the throat. There was a slight aftertaste of some sweetness and grains, but it quickly faded. It was very light in body. Over all impression of this beer, it is a good beer compared to most of its competitors, nothing much as far as aromas and tastes. It leaves nothing to make you want to come back for more. But I can say it is a crisp, clean, refreshing beer that on a hot day did its job.

The aroma leaves something to be desired with a thin huskiness that detracts from it's very lightly grainy malt note. The body is light; and the creamy head lends a bit of softness to the crisp and effervescent carbonation that follows. As it releases it's gas it becomes even softer, and somewhat creamy in the mouth; but it's a trade-off because the carbonation actually helps to enhance the flavor that's there. The flavor is limited, but what else could be expected of a beer that's labelled as a "low carbohydrate light beer". There's some thin grainy malt present, and it's surprisingly well-balanced by a subtle interwoven bitterness, yet it seems lacking. It finishes almost without notice.

1.7,-8.1,1,1,2,2,2,"This could be the clearest beer I have ever drank. More reminiscent of champagne in the glass. Pours out to a nearly crystal clear light yellow with a funny cooked veggie aroma. Taste is lightly sweet with virutally no aftertaste. No hops or malt presence at all. Tastes very, very similar to Miller Lite.  Very watered down with no body whatsoever.","proc","Sep 30, 2002"
2.11,14.1,2.5,1.5,2,2,3,"I agreed with my roomate/buddy (who is currently passed out on the couch) to fairly review all the AB products that he loves, as long he buys, or they are freebies. Here it goes.....Transparent faint yellow color, yeilds an overly bubbly head that leaves in a hurry. Smell is mostly grainy, and metallic. The only beer flavor is a faint sour stale finish and aftertaste like the stale beers you would sneak out of your dad's supply in high school. Excessively thin, even for a light beer. Can't get over the metallic/grainy whiff, easy to down, but not enjoyable at all....The biggest impression is the overall lack of any positive beerlike flavors....I used to drink Michelob light, before I knew what good beer was. This is a decent marketing job, but a lousy beer.","StevieW","Jul 01, 2002"
1.33,-28.1,2,1.5,1,1.5,1.5,"Even for a light beer (which should always be judged on a different scale since they will never compare with a good non-light style) this is just terrible. I had some degree of hope since they put it out under the Michelob name, and not Budweiser, but this is as bad as beer gets. Unless your dietician is against any form of beer because of high carbs and they'll let ya slide with this.. stay away from it!","mikes2923","May 22, 2002"
1.38,-25.4,2,1.5,1,1,2,"Michelob Ultra, "the ultra low carbohydrate” beer from A-B.  It’s in a standard Michelob 12 ounce bottle, but with an over the top color scheme (that we’ll be seeing on a NASCAR any day now).  Can’t figure out why A-B is using Michelob for this and not Bud, but the Michelob name has lost all credibility with me anyhow.  The beer is about as you’d expect, pale looking macro-lager, adjuncty aroma with a more pronounced chemical smell.  Aggressive carbonation, if it had any flavor it was wiped away by those scrubbing bubbles.  Marketing came up with this one, and it tastes like it.","jackndan","May 18, 2002"
