" The smell actually tells you a lot about this beer as it has some malt sweetness which could have adjunct or not it isn't obvious but it is sweet and the flavor is gentle with the carbonation whisking it away and leaving the mouth dry with a slight tangy yeast tinge. Overall pleasant but not memorable, pretty average yet not offensive it is a palate cleanser if there ever was one."

"The downside to diabetes is not being able to drink beers I loved. Red Stripe was a favorite, and chock full of carbs. Red Stripe Light still delivers some of that Jamaican flavor, while cutting the carbs down to ten per bottle. It has a better flavor than most American light beers. If you like RS regular and can no longer drink it, give the Light a try. Now if they could come up with a low-carb Dunkel. Sigh."

"The taste was leaning towards hoppy and had a semi-bitter dry finish: I found it refreshing and just what I needed at the time. This is not the srot of beer I'd normally buy, but it was sunny, hot and I was in Jamaica!"

"Overall, not really for me but pretty average for the style."

"Does anyone really drink this for real?"

"Light bodied with light carbonation. More watery than anything else. Not worth the effort to even try it."

"Pours a clean pale yellow with a white head. In the aroma, quite lager like and a sweet buttery smell. In the taste, A small sweet note of butter, but really a lack of flavor. A small bite and a medium to lighter bodied mouthfeel, with a note of dryness and quite clean aftertaste. So no flavor or aftertaste, but a little buttery note, HOORAY, BEER!"

"Not sure why, but I felt compelled to try this tonight. It pours a clear pale straw topped by a finger of lightly dirty-white foam. The nose is nearly nonexistent, with only a vague powdered-sugar-like sweetness and a mild cornmeal finding their ways to my 'strils. The taste holds notes of hard water, rocks, very light and vague vegetable matter, and a tiny touch of sweetness. Man, this stuff is more like weird-tasting water than a beer. The body is pretty damn light, with a light moderate carbonation and an unsurprisingly watery feel. Overall, a pretty sad beer. ...I got nuthin else..."
"O: Not very flavorful, goes down easily since there isnâ€™t much to the beer, likewise not filling at all, extremely mild kick, decent representation of style, there are definitely other beers in the style that I would choose first."
"Poured a 2"" bight white soap suds head. Clear very light straw yellow color. Smells mildly of sour corn. Taste is basically water with an after taste of grain and a slight acidic zing. Honestly, it's not the worst light beer I've had, but like pretty much all the rest it's not much more than water."
"O: Not a lot to go on. Very drinkable in large quantities, but would prefer a lager with more heft."
"O: Overall this light, low alcohol lager is probably pretty good in Jamaica, it's not too bad on a 100 degree day in Nebraska. However, this is a mediocre (at best) easily forgettable beer. And I get about one less in a 12 pack."
"I think it would be interesting to compare this to Rolling Rock, which I had earlier tonight and struggled to find words for the ultra-light flavor."
"overall. its a light lager. i dont like this kind of beer, but to be fair, i know what it is that this beer is trying to be, and it does it pretty well."
"D - I was glad when they repaired the taps because this stuff just wasn't hitting the spot. Worth a try if you like light lagers, but I would recommend the regular Red Stripe over their toned down watery version."
"D- Skunky makes it fail on top of thin watery crap beer taste."
"A session beer, both by definition and by drinkability. Light and crisp and mindless. Good drunk beer."
"D: not bad, would probably drink again if i wanted a decent light beer"
"D: Might be better on a very hot sumer day, probably even better in Jamaica."
"From the 11.2 fl. oz. stubby bottle. Sampled on December 28, 2010. The pour is straw yellow with busy carbonation leading up to a one-inch fizzy white head that simmers down after a bit. The aroma pulls together grass and malts with a hint of hoppiness and accompanying adjuncts. The bidy is thin to medium which is not unusual with a light beer. The taste is also grassy and malty. For a light beer it is fairly drinkable."
"Taste is pretty basic and utilitarian, wet grain and mild sweetness suggesting apple and corn again. Feels fizzy, yet dry and clean. Super easy to drink without thinking about it. Pretty average lager with no off flavors."
"I will say that this is better than a lot of light lagers out there. However, it's still not enough to make me want to drink it again."
"The beer pours a pale gold color with a fizzy white head that quickly fades to spotty lacing. The aroma is average. It has a light, pilsner malt scent along with little hop character and a dry lager yeast aroma. The taste is decent. It has a smooth, pilsner malt flavor that goes down quick and easy with a bone dry finish. It doesn't taste much different from the original. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a low bodied beer with good carbonation. This is a refreshing light lager. Again, if you like the original, this isn't much different and you can sleep better knowing it's better for you."
"D: If you're going to drink a light lager, this might actually not be an awful way to go. By no means amazing, but there are definitely worse options."
"Clean grains and a high carbonation just about sum this one up. A brief flash of drying bitterness on the finish, but I am not even sure that is from hops. It's thirst quenching and is actually a pretty well brewed lager to be so clean, I dont really detect any flaws here. Not to say I really like it, but I dont dislike the beer."
"d- okay, gulpable.. just flavorless. my aunt picked up a sixer becase red stripe regular is a refreshing summer beer, and why not try the light.. not is the optimal word."
"With the low 3.6% abv. there is no taste of alcohol at all in here, so they're really easy to down. The problem I have with it is that it's not really very beer-like."
"Overall: Stick with regular Red Stripe."
"D: Great for warm weather, a crisp beer. Typical for a light beer, but this one does stand above many others."
"Red Stripe Light was a very light golden color with good clarity. It has a white fizzy head that quickly dissipated with no lacing. It had a ""light beer"" smell to it. It tasted fairly close to the regular, just lighter in taste and body. The finish was dry and crisp. Mouthfeel was light body with prickly carbonation. Drinkability was above average. Overall it was not bad for a light beer, quite refreshing, but the original is better."
"Cheers!"
"Clear yellow pour, looks like any light beer; this stuff is downright horrible (worse than other light beers - bud, coors, miller, etc). Fain maltiness and a horrible sickly metallic taste. Very watery. I like a good light lager on a hot day at a BBQ, but this stuff is awful. Probably better in Jamaica with the regular version."
"Why? Why the hell not? I'm going to clear the air here and say that I am a sucker for a stubby bottle, cute little bastards get me every time. Oh and if it would have come in that weird 10.5oz clear bottle seen over there, well buddy I wouldn't have purchased it. Well, I don't know about that 10.5 oz is one odd size, and I like odd sized bottles too. I don't think I like them the way I like stubby bottles though, there is just this sort of romantic feeling I get from a stubby bottle. I can't quite grasp why this is not the standard, the design seems so much more ""drinky"" if I may, so much more conducive to drinking beer than the long neck. I don't know why I feel this way, it's a psychological thing really and there is nothing in this world I can do to explain it. I am very lucky though, a new brewery in Iowa (Peace Tree Brewing) is bottling exclusively in stubbys. The cool thing about Peace Tree is that I love their beer, which basically means that I'll not be swayed by the undeniable charm of the Red Stripe bottle again. Arevaderche Jamaican Lager, hola Hop Wrangler. On with the rating now, this beer pours a very pale yellow color with a nice medium sized tight head. I swear to you that the first thing I detect in the aroma of this beer is chicken, crock pot roasted chicken. It's a pretty specific smell, and one that I am very familiar with. When I come home from work to find the aroma of the chicken I was forced to wake up a whole ten minutes early that morning to throw into a cooking device my Aunt Nancy & Uncle Don gave me, this is a joyous smell. But it serves very little if any place in the world of beer. I guess this is one of those things that makes me realize how damned inexperienced of a brewer I am. Oh my beers suffer from all the usual problems, a bit tart here, a little vegetal there, maybe a bit too many hops for this style, or a damned thin mouth feel. But never in my life have I come across any sort of process or technical flaw that would make my beer smell like a roasted chicken. Just damned fascinating. Along with the chicken we've got some complimentary aromas, some corn and some herbal hoppiness. The flavor for all it's short comings is so much of a relief as compared to the aroma that I'm happy as CAN BE to be drinking as opposed to smelling this. The beer is basically dry, and very light on flavor but has some bright maltiness, a little corn, and some distinct noble hoppiness. This is very refreshing, but it is also very light. I have no problem with beers being light, in fact I am very for it, but this one certainly falls under that sacrificing flavor for levity thing very strongly. People are purchasing this for nine dollars a six pack, that is really happening. Surreal. This reminds me that I need to roast a chicken."
"Very drinkable due to overall lack of flavor. I was sitting in the hot sun at the beach and this was the beer they had on special. Maybe they were trying to get rid of it."
"Poured from a brown 11.2 oz. bottle. Has a pale yellow color with a small head. Smell is of corn and malts. Taste is crisp, some grains, a tad more flavor than other light beers. Feels light in the mouth and has good drinkability. Overall not the worst light beer I have had, but nothing great."
"Another pale fizzy lager, this one is a light straw golde color with heavy streaming carbonation. White head forms thick at first and dwindles quickly down to nothing. Thin speckled lacing not much an eye candy appeal here. Aroma has a grainy cooked vegetable grassy tone to it. Slightly metallic tone going on as well it's really hard to describe because there's not much there. Flavor is light crisp malt sweetness with some harsh grassy herbal tones blended with a metallic finish. Mouthfeel is ligt on the palate but carbonation is really heav for some reason, definitely force carbonated. Drinkabilit overall is an average light lager, it's hard to complain about I know it would be refreshing if in the caribbean, but I'd much rather stick to the original."
"Meh. Unless you consider yourself a fan of light lagers, I'd avoid. Not bad. Average at best."
"D- Overall, Red Stripe Light is about what I expected it to be. A pretty typical Macro Light Lager that really doesn't stand out against any other in the style. Not horribe, not great either. Probably wouldn't purchase again."
"Smell is mostly of grains, although it does have a very slight hint of citrusy hop aroma. Taste is pretty much exactly the same. Almost identical to the american macros, but with a tiny bit more of a hop presence that for me makes it slightly more enjoyable. Very light bodied, almost feels like carbonated water."
"Now, I did enjoy this beer, it is a good light beer. Not a excellent beer, but still a decent summer brew. I would buy this over Corona."
"Drinkability: Hooray Beer-lite! While it probably has a place served up on a hot, sunny beach somewhere, it's just not too terribly enjoyable here in Georgia during the waning days of Winter."
"Had it on the beach at Sandals Negril. It was much easier to drink in the heat than the the more typical Red Stripe. Its a very light tasting beer with little or no aftertaste. Would prefer it to American light beers and would definitely purchase again if only they sold it in the states."
"Available at our resort, so I ended up with a couple of these rather than the regular Red Stripe. Crystal clear, very pale yellow with a bright white cap that didn't last long. Light aroma, cereal grains mostly. Very low bitterness, mild sweetness with a hint of esters. Bordering on watery, but it still had something of a body and texture. Medium to high carbonation seemed to be a little too much. Not much here, so pretty easy to drink. I liked the regular stuff a lot more, so it didn't seem to make sense to keep going back for more of this."
"To my surprise, I like this one. It's a light beer from Jamaica, so it's exactly what you'll expect and is a nice thirst quencher for those hot Jamaican afternoons."
"Aviable on tap on Jamaica--it si not nearly as good as the regular Red Stripe. However, it is okay for a light lager. It isn't nearly as watery as most light lagers and it still tastes relatively close to the original. It is just a weaker version of the real deal,"
"Drank this on the beach in Jamaica. Tasted much better then your average light beer, but not nearly as good as it's bigger brother, regular red stripe. Clear pour, very little head, very little odor. Smooth and a bit watery but refreshing and does the job its made to do. I could, and did, drink several in one sitting. Better on a hot day in Jamaica than Dragon Stout for sure."
"and the Red Stripe Light they had on tap did not cheer me up much. The regular Red Stripe was warm and I wanted a cold beer. The color was a sickly yellow with a thin head. It's not that the aroma was awful, but more that there was simply no aroma. The taste was corn and rice, no malts or hops. While it looked carbonated (big bubbles and all) the mouthfeel was flat. I could see being able to drink this beer, but the closest comparison I can think of is carbonated tap water."
"Not much to it, but it's par for the course with light beers, and I might even prefer it to the standard American macros."
