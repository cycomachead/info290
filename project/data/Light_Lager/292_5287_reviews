"Apparently I'm an outlier for not calling this the worst beer on the planet. Honestly, I thought it was plenty smooth, inoffensive, and went fine with my Japanese food. I'd rather have this than a large bunch of the awful ""craft"" out there."

"Typical mass produced beer. AB-Inbev owns this now and it is brewed in USA. Light flavor, gold color, average skunklike flavor"

"This beer had a moderate sweet taste that disappeared quickly. There was also a low level of carbonation. If I have another I will want it really cold and only to quench a thirst. Clearly not a session beer."

"Half finger head on a clear straw to bright golden colored body. aroma is minimal with grains and some sweet corn. Flavor is the same but I am happy there are no off putting flavors although little flavor is there at all. Light body and moderate to high carbonation. Easy to drink, not flavorful but nothing really to turn you off. Basically slightly bitter water."

"O: Very easy to drink and very sessionable. This is probably one of the less offensive light lagers as it at least still has some taste to it. Would not be on the top of the list of beers to have again."
""

"I am not sure if I will try this once again. Too pricey here."
""

"Poured from a brown 22 oz. bottle. Has a very pale yellow color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is mild, a touch of corn. Taste is downright weak, maybe a hint of malt, very water like. Feels light in the mouth and overall was lacking in flavor, even for this style."

"Really wasn't much to speak of, lots of water, more bitterness than it should have given the lack of much substance to the beer. Prickly carbonation. Pretty clean overall except the bitterness, must be a decent use of rice to this beer."

"My initial pour netted me two-plus fingers of foamy, bone-white head with extremely limited retention. Hey, I realize that I am not the handsomest of guys, but do you have to take off so quickly? Color was a pale lemon-yellow with NE-quality clarity. I have urinated darker water than this. Nose had a faint lager/corn adjunct sweetness, but it was all pretty mild. Mouthfeel was thin and watery with only the barest of taste in the mouth. I am glad it was nearing my bedtime as this was a major snooze-a-thon. Holy boring, Batman! Finish was equally band and ho-hum, making for a less-than-scintillating experience. That said, I do not feel that I should dun it too badly. I knew what I was buying, but I had never seen it before, either in CAN or bottle, and I have certainly had much worse, including from the style. Hey, it beats a cup of tea before retirement, I promise you. Don't avoid it if it is one of the few options open to you - it could be the lesser of several evils."

"Overall: Very drinkable beer but why would you pay money for a beer with no flavor. Only drank this one because I needed the cap for my bar top"
"She suggested Asahi, which will be in another review!"
"Pours a pale yellow color, some carbonation, little foamy white head, with some sticky lacing left behind. The nose is sweet, grainy, with some rice notes. The taste is sweet, kinda malty, grainy/ricy/skunky. Light Body. Would not drink this one again."
"O: I liked this one better than Sapporo light. Nicer flavor with a bit less reliance on the pure rice flavor."
"D: Very good."
"Yet another contender in the made-with-the-purpose-of-getting-you-drunk category. Because we need more of those…"
"Overall Drinkability - Disappointing. Will try re-rating with a fresher bottle, but not sure it will help."
"I'd stay away"
"Went out to dinner on Friday with my wife to a nice sushi place in Roslindale. After looking at the beer menu, went with Kirin Light mainly because I've never had one before. Poured into a pils style glass. Extremely pale body; barely yellow at all. Lots of carbonation but no head. Looks like sparkling water. Smells like rice. Tastes way too watered down to have any real flavor. Body was paper thin and merely just liquid. There is absolutely nothing behind this beer. When they say ""light", they mean they removed everything. I think a Coors would taste better. I'd never order a Japanese light beer again after this poor showing."
"Pours a rather typical and uninspiring clear straw yellow with not much of a white head. Aroma is weak and watery, barely like beer at all. Flavor is malty, on the thin side, all too typical of light beers. Texture has only a little fizz to it. Still I’m glad I gave it a fair shake. [Insert joke about light beer here.]"
"D: Only if hard up and dry."
"I haven't had a lot of light macros, but this one is definitely better than the average run-of-the-mill light. It's quite clean, and non-offensive."
"Bitter and rough, watery and light-bodied (expected). Highly effervescent, almost fizzy. You could drink this, but I wouldn't suggest it."
"D- Do you want to drink a case at once? You can!"
"M/D: Watery, so it goes down easy. The ease of drinking is a detriment in this case, because its not really worth having."
"Drinkability: A light beer, of course, but one that's at least clean-tasting and fairly refreshing. There's a lot of true horrors in the land of lagers, but, thankfully, this wasn't of them."
"It was slightly carbonated water. A bit of bitterness that may of been thrown in there as a last ditch effort for some type of flavour. Mouthfeel and taste hit the BACK of the tongue like you are scraping it with your toothbrush in the morning. Unfortunately won't forget that beer for a while. At least the Hibachi was good."
"Taste is on the mild side, even for a light lager with a few hints of stale grains...much like seltzer water and the rice additions only accentuate the effect. If you want a light beer with the least amount of flavor, this one is a good choice."
"Like most of the Oriental beers I've had, this poured a very pale yellow, with little head or lacing, a touch of carbonation, a grainy aroma and taste and a short dry finish. All that said, it was okay when paired with a Spicy Seafood Noodle soup, but I could have done much better. At least it wasn't fattening."
"D - Just stay away, Kirin regular isn't half as bad as this light crap"
"D: Very drinkable, it was like fizzy water with a bit of rice."
"I can't say this had any special aromas of tastes...grains, some corn, and lighter grassiness. It did go down fast on the hot day, but then again so did the glass of water."
"Drinkability: I could drink these things all day, but that's only because they're so thin and tasteless. Wouldn't go out and buy this ever again (not even at a restaurant), but would drink it only if it were a hot day and some cold ones were around. Seriously, this beer isn't even worth a try."
"D - Pretty bad. This is a far cry from the ""real"" Kirin Ichiban...if you are trying to save calories, eat a little less rice beneath your sashimi and stick with the real stuff."
"D: Drinkability overall was average, per style. Certainly had no problem putting this down and at 95 calories and being a light beer I would ponder to say this is one of the better light beers (with exception of sam adams) that ive tasted, and I could drink a couple of these without hesitation."
"This reminds me of lightly sweetened carbonated water much more than a beer - even a macro light. Sad. A neighbor of mine likes this. She can keep it. I'll pass."
"pours with a big soapy foam head .. tastes abit tart, slightly metallic, and cheap low grade make yo mama cry wholesale corn ... smell is low, 2 non pigeon ... driankable but there are soooo many better (non budweiser made) light lagers out there.. and what is the deal with sushi??"
"Chock one up for another crappy light beer. Pretty much a watered down version of Kirin Ichiban. Pours a pathetic, thin, yellow tinged seltzer water. Smell of maybe dried corn and rice if you put your nose right up to it. Tastes like watered down ricecakes. One more light beer for the drain."
"Pours a light yellow color into the pint glass with almost no head. Very thin lacing, mouthfeel and palate. Pretty standard light beer. Looks like nothing, smells like nothing and tastes like nothing. Its certainly not offensive but its hard to say its good. Its carbonated water with a dash of alcohol. Not recommended at all...although I wonder how it would go along with sushi...probably not worth trying."
"D - Pretty decent, overall. I'd actually prefer this over 99% of other bmcs. I do like the Ichiban a little better, but I'd have to say I'd take this over any other light beer."
"Drinkability- With the canned corn aroma and severe lack of taste, it's not the most drinkable stuff in the universe. It ain't horrible tho."
"Went out to the hibachi steakhouse last night and they had the last two on the menu that I had not tried, this being one of them. Poured a dull straw yellow with a big white fizzy head. Lots of visible carbonation, but the fizzy yellow water type, no lace. The smell was very faint, if there at all. What I could pick up was maybe a hay, or wheat smell. Again very very faint, and hardly there at all. The taste was very light and non descript, but that is about what one would expect from a light lager. A light grain, just enough of a taste to know I was not drinking water would be the best way to describe it. Decent feel, again just the cold well carbonated. Crisp, and a clean finish, no aftertaste. Overall this was totally forgettable, as I imagined it would be. Their version of Bud Light I imagine and if thats the case, it is spot on. Nothing to see here, move along people."
"Kirin Light Beer pours a light golden yellow with a thick white head from a brown twelve ounce bottle. The aroma is grainy. The taste is also grainy, with a touch of corn flavor jumping out at me. There's nothing offensive here, but really not much going on either. A decent choice if you want a light lager."
"My girlfriend says that this beer smells like wet-dog. She makes me laugh. Actually the beer smells quite grainy for a light lager, and with an earthy hop character that hinges on the pungent side. The good news is that that's the worst of it. The beer pours an expected crystal-clear, fizzy brew with fleeting head retention. After the aromas, the flavors offer little of anything. Very faint pils malts and rice, but those are short lived. The hops only encorage a balance and are equally as fleeting. The feel is quite watery and carbonated. The beer simply offers little character or interest."
"D - Not the worst light lager, but certainly not the best. Nothing really jumped out at me."
"Taste is really bad. Sour and unpleasant. Mineral watery in character and lightly vegetal. Mouth is watery. No crispness. Limp, yet fizzy. Blick. This is foul. Run, don't walk."
"Kirin Light is bad. It's even worse than some low-alcohol beer and I have a hard time thinking of them as beer at all. My advice can be boiled down to one word that can be found on the reviewing drop-down menu next to the number 1.0. And that word is... avoid."
"Poured a pale yellow color with modest white head. Smell is very minimal with only a slight sweet note to be found. Taste is very light, but also refreshing, and moderately enjoyable. Finish is more of a refreshing taste, but offers nothing out of the ordinary. Expensive spacer."
"Wow this is pale yellow, or moderatly hydrated man piss. White head that leaves no lace. Smells of boiled rice and taste of almost nothing. My mouth thinks I am drinking soda water, at least I can drink it quickly."
"The closest beer I recall that tastes almost exactly like water. Although this may increase its drinkability score, no other positive qualities could be found. Appeared almost like water with a few squeezes of lemon. No head or carbonation. First time I have had a Japanese beer and I hope this will not deter me from trying a few others."
"The beer escapes the bottle a very light translucent yellow with a moderate in size bright white head that is frothy in texture, and the lace a very thin sheet to conceal the glass. Nose is all malt what there is of it, crisp and clean, start is sweet, thinly malted, top is light to moderate in feel. Finish is sternly acidic, hops sparse and the aftertaste desert dry, drinkable if youre into light beers and I must say a tad better than most."
"Drinkability - for hot weather, sure. I think I'd choose a cheaper alternative, but it'll drink."
"A bland, watery light beer is all that's here. Nothing too foul, but nothing that would warrant a second purchase either."
"Pours to large soapy bubbles that dissapear. Color is water and light straw. Aroma is carbonated water, malt, adjunct grains and a weak dose of pungent hops. Taste is mostly carbonated water with a splash of malt, cereal and hops. Bitter finish that sours and turns into a metallic, stomach-acid aftertaste. Probably better suited for pairing with food to mask the aftertaste."
"This brew poured a medium head of fine to medium sized white bubbles that quickly disappeared. Its body was a straw yellow and was very carbonated. It had a very mild malt aroma and a skunky cheap macro swill flavor of weak hops."
"When I took my first taste of this brew, I knew instantly that I was not going to like this one. It poured a small white creamy head with small bubbles. There was fair lacing with this brew. The body was straw yellow in hue. It had a mild malt aroma and it was bitter tasting from start to finish. This brew was light and watery tasting."
"In defense of this beer I must say that it is better than many American lights, although that may not be saying much. Still, if one must drink a light beer, this may be one of the better ones. The label copy notes ""only 95 calories", so its clear that the caloric content is of more importance to the target audience than the taste."
"Pours a crystal clear, very light straw gold body. It's topped by a full, foamy, bright-white head head, but unfortunately it drops almost immediately! It keeps a thin foamy collar but hardly any surface covering, and leaves no lace. The aroma is nice with a softly sweet graininess. Exceptionally clean. The body is light and gently crisp in the mouth - quite appropriate for a light beer. The flavor, however, expresses less character than the nose might lead you to believe. There's just a mild touch of grainy maltiness, and it's much less sweet than might be expected. It doesn't really finish as much as it just ends. In fact, the entire flavor is just like a short dry finish. Disappointing."
"What would be the politically correct term for this beer? Japanese American Light Crap? Please this beer is horrible, and now it is brewed in the US like that would make any difference other than someone cutting costs to line their pockets."
