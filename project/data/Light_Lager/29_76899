There is more smell than most lagers, mostly grain and small flecks of citrus. No hops to speak of. Taste is much of the same, malted grain flavor, no alcohol on the palate, no hoppy bitterness. Fair for this style of beer. Feel is a bit odd. Feels much like tonic water, thin, wispy with loads of cola carbonation.

I like that it has significantly more spike then regular bud light considering bud light just seems to go thru you FAST. It's also relatively cheap and I really like the blue bottle. Honestly I feel like the people who don't like this beer obviously don't like to drink very cheap. This is a good beer for those wanting to get tipsy on a relatively low price and for the money conscience people like me. Now I will admit it's not the best tasting beer in the world but considering it only takes me two bottles to really start feeling something and that I don't have to pay too much for it. I say it is well worth it for the most part. I like stronger beers and this would be a beer I'd buy if I didn't want to spend that much money. Now for those you just HAVE to have a wonderful tasting fountain of beer this wouldn't be the beer of choice but considering I get tipsy after relatively little cash spent. I'd say it is a great beer for the money conscience people out there who only want to feel good after a hard day at work. I do like how I don't really smell the beer that much unless I stick my nose in it either which is why I give a high review on smell although","Stevenmann57","Jun 12, 2014"

1.26,-43,2,1,1,2,1.5,"If nothing else, it came in a pretty cobalt blue bottle, so I may see if the art department at work can use it. Otherwise, what were they thinking? Blue allows more light penetration than any other color of glass. I had two fingers of bone-white fizzing head initially until it fizzed its way to wispiness. Color was a pale lemon-yellow (SRM = > 2, < 4) with NE-plus quality clarity, enabling me to see into the future. It looks like snow! Those of us south of US 30 are expected to get 6"" to 8"" or perhaps more. The nose had an odd Minhas-like chemical smell, like plastics and dry cleaning fluid. Fuh! Mouthfeel was thin and watery and the taste was reminiscent of the time I had trench mouth as a kid (thanks, summer camp creeps) and had to gargle with diluted hydrogen peroxide. Finish was bland. Rubbish! I am experiencing buyer's remorse.","woodychandler","May 08, 2014"

Most American style light lagers have an abv of 4.2. This is more like an ICE Beer. Bud Light Platinum pours out of the can a nice amber color with a small white head. The smell is that of american style lager but sweeter. An you can smell the alcohol in this brew. Right off the bat you taste the 6.0 abv- but it is smooth and crisp. The fact of the matter is it drinks like a light beer,but it has a kick. This brew has more to it than Bud Light, but it not as much as Budweiser. It is right in middle of the two. I like how it is smooth ,but the alcohol taste brings this brew down. Overall, I'm giving this brew a 4 out 5. I would get this brew again.","nicholas2121","Mar 20, 2014"

Easy to drink. 6% might seem invasive for a Bud Light drinker, but this has a good sensibility to its strength. Has some body to work with, if not, too wooly and/or oily for an adjunct lager. Dial down the carbonation, or maybe just distribute it a bit, and you have a decent feel, strangely enough. Put-together like a science experiment, it really could be a solid go-to for pale lager drinkers.","thecheapies","Jan 23, 2014"

1.61,-27.1,3,2,1,2,1.75,"Budweiser Light Platinum (2013) - At 6% ABV a Sam Adam's Light grade beer is expected if not more. With some 130 calories I'm saying to myself this has to have more flavor than Bud Light regular. On both counts I was wrong. A thick foamy head reduces too mild lacing. Very active carbonation. Think wheat aromas abound. Crystal clear yellow body with very wet mouthfeel. On the front of the palette there is very little taste to be had. Faint wheat and grass taste if that. Lots of water mid-palette. Very weak malt flavor. Back palette there is very faint hops and rice. I think weak Natty Ice. This is Bud Light alright and not much more. Actually it's horrible when you really think about it because as far as light beers go this has more calories than it should. Since a Guinness has less calories I'm at a loss why I'd even think to buy this over regular Bud Light since it's cheaper or Guinness since it's better tasting. Hell I could get Third Shift or Sam's Light for around the same price. If ABV is your thing-- Natural Ice or Milwaukee's Best has more taste, higher ABV, and is cheaper. So again-- what's the point. With Bud Black Crown I get it-- pay better for good Bud. But with this I don't get it. Pay more for a potent Bud Light with more calories? It's an ill place and no purpose beer. I rarely say this but 1 out of 5 stars. Pretend it's not even on the shelf.","digitalflood","Aug 25, 2013"

I have no interest in ever consuming one of these again. it had the profound effect of bringing me from craving a beer badly to instantly not wanting to drink anymore, they should treat alcoholics with this wash, might turn them off too. id honestly rather drink any dirty 40 from the gas station than have another one of these. steer clear.","StonedTrippin","Aug 25, 2013"

Chasing hot wings and pizza with BMC products seems to be a lasting trend here in America, which is unfortunate. Bud Platinum, however, offers no drinkability. This beer is a headache waiting to happen, and can only be tolerated at refrigerator temperatures. Why increase the abv on a mediocre (at best) beer? Because it sells. Stupid.

One should never be a big enough snob to turn down a new and free beer.While I would never purchase this it was inoffensive and I could see a lot of Bud regulars buying it for the cool looks and higher alcohol. I should also add that ""Bud Light"" and the beer being 6% is intriguing. I was able to drink two and could easily drink a few more but that does not make a beer good IMO.","Haydn-Juby","May 26, 2013"

Appearance wise, it has the typical, inoffensive pale golden color of a light lager. The smell was somewhat sweet and malty, if very faintly so. The taste is what killed it for me. Light malt-liquour is what comes to mind. Sweet, cloying, yet watery; no dimension or complexity, not even a discernible taste of malts or hops. Over carbonated and thin. I realise that ajunct light lagers have their place in the market and some are even drinkable, but this is a truly awful beer that would appeal to NO ONE. The taste would be a turn off to most light beer drinkers, I would assume. If someone is looking for a higher ABV beer to get drunk on, but doesn't want to stray from the recognised Budweiser name, then I suppose that would be the only market buying this stuff repeatedly. As for me, one bottle was plenty enough, and a second tasting holds zero appeal at all.","Aaron_Ramson","Jan 17, 2013"

There are a lot of tiny bubbles visible in this beer. The beer smells of grain husks, bread, and some alcohol. The taste is bready and sweet with some alcohol. The hops are very subtle. It tastes like a malt liquor with a ligher body. The body is light with strong carbonation. The carbonation is high enough to prevent any sort of aftertaste. The finish is crisp. The beer drinks very easy. Surprisingly, I find this beer to be decent for what it is. It seems like AB-Inbev is just trying to cleverly package a malt liquor and boost the sales using the Bud Light label. A light beer this is not.","acevenom","Jan 05, 2013"

Everything about it really drew me in from the blue bottle to the higher abv to the rampant commercials featuring my favorite songs. I was excited by the price and was hoping for a good beer available in six packs for the price of your average light beer. I would argue that this is a better drink than your typical Bud Light, but not remarkably so. It still has a watery, metallic taste to it, despite a slight sweetness. It’s the same yellowing-golden color as Bud Light and has a slightly thicker head which dissipates with such speed most might miss it, it also leaves no lacing. So Platinum pales in comparison to most high-class bottled beers, but the role that it fulfills as a step above your average light beer for college parties, I’d say it gets the job done. I also found that it sold very well initially, as the three liquor stores I frequent were almost always sold out of it by the weekend and the owners mentioned its popularity among everyone from young drinkers to middle-age, blue collar drinkers. The crossing of demographics is an important part of Ab’s success in much of its drinks. Finally, I will never tire of its cool blue bottle.","FratyardVines","Dec 04, 2012"

OK, not an outstanding aroma, but at least it doesn’t smell like water. It pours a rather typical clear, wan straw yellow with not much head. Flavor is nothing special - but as I said, better than what I expected from a mega-brewed light beer. Crisp, malty with a hint of fruit. Texture is fairly fizzy, smooth, average body.

If given the choice between this and bud light, I'll take the bud light. Actually, I can't think of anything I would choose this over (except maybe Wild Blue). Unless you're just looking to get drunk with a few less bottles, don't waste your money on this one.","jburns4","Jan 29, 2012"

The beer loses that ""Crisp clean"" aroma and taste that cheap adjunct lagers depend on, which makes the beers immensely less refreshing, which is supposed to be its top selling point.","greenmonstah","Jan 29, 2012"

The average Joey Suitcase thinks 6% ABV is robust. It’s not, Sally. Overall, BLP is a novelty and two years from now this beer will be no more than a memory a la Anheuser World Select. Remember that dandy? BLP is forgettable and while not terrible it is… um… what was I talking about?","bditty187","Jan 20, 2012"

Very white in color. Brew itself was a very light pale yellow. Smelled very light. Just notes of sweetness. Maybe a little fruity. Tasted a little on the sweet side. Also notes of fruit. Maybe apple. Actually tasted good. This brew is suppose to be 6%. No alcohol could be detected. Felt good in the mouth. I thought the carbonation was about right. Ill buy a sixer when this brew hits the stores. Id love to drink a sixer to see if its actually 6%.","youngleo","Jan 09, 2012"
