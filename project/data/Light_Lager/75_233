I have reviewed many American-style adjunct lagers, and while there are definitely a lot of stinkers in that category, there are plenty of cheap, serviceable options as well. I often find that the BA aggregate average overstates the crappiness of these types of beers, but Corona Light is one instance where it is spot on. This is inexcusably, offensively bad, and just a fetid excuse for a light beer all around. I would not pay money for this again, and I doubt I'd accept it as a freebie, either.

When I first had it, not realizing it was the light version, thought something like ""wow, Corona doesn't taste as crappy as I remember it, in fact it tastes like nothing at all!"". I mean, you can't really rail on this beer for being flavorless, it's nothing like the nauseating Keystone Light, but then again it's pretty expensive for what it is. As far as light beers go, you could do worse. I've used it for carmelizing onions and they turned out pretty well, so maybe there's a use for it after all.","enjambed","Jul 21, 2014"

Nothing to get excited over by any means and glad I just bought a single bottle for a $1.00, which that is probably over-priced.","BeerWithMike","Jun 19, 2014"

OVERALL: a tickling rinse of sunshine that, in the right context, is pleasing if only because it is fleeting, and the repetition is encouraged by the beer's absent character...out of context, minimal calories that could still be better spent eating a Dorito or two...","dacrza1","Sep 18, 2013"

My sister offered me a corona light at her house (she was on a diet at the time). It has a classic urine type appearance to it as most beers in this category have. It initially had a skunky smell to it with maybe a smell of water logged socks sitting in my backpack for a week would have thrown in. The taste is something awful. It's obviously very watered down but it tastes just as it smells. I cringed the first few sips then politely told my sister I couldn't stomach it any longer. I drank about half of the 12 ounce bottle. This is without a doubt the worst tasting beer I've ever had in my life and I've had all of the classic bad ones (PBR, Natural Light, Bud, Miller High Life, etc.). This beer is an entirely new kind of awful.","49ersandBeer","Nov 11, 2012"

As light as this beer is, plenty of exotic flavors of vegetables and processed wood products are present. In my humble opinion, this particular beer could improve from an adjustment in the malts and perhaps a brewing and packaging process that could better protect from UV light exposure. However, for those who do enjoy the extra flavor imparted from light, this would be a recommended lower alcohol, lower calorie lager.","NachlamSie","Sep 09, 2007"
