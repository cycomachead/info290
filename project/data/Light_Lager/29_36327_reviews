"My wife picked this up for herself.   I tried one.  Worst thing I've ever tasted. First sip tasted like slightly fruited seltzer water.  Then the fruit went away (quickly) and I was left with a tingle as if I just drank plain seltzer or Club soda. Vile stuff!  I don't drink those flavored sparkling waters or Vitamin water etc, but I imagine this is what they taste like. I would have rated this 1 but gave a little extra for at least having a tiny bit or fruit aroma. Barely."

"Light fruity beers are not for everyone. Personally, I can't stand hoppy bitter beers and that seems to be the trend with craft brewers in the US. I prefer lighter sweeter beers. Michelob's Pomegranate Rasberry beer has been my favorite staple beer for years! I love this beer! It's light, sweet and refreshing. Perfect for hot summer days. If I am camping or at a friend's BBQ and plan to be drinking for hours on end, this is the beer I bring. Most hard core beer snobs will cringe at this, but I love to add orange juice and make a beermosa with this beer. Like I said, this beer isn't for everyone and I expect many to turn their nose up at any beer than is light and sweet, but if this is the style your taste buds prefer you will enjoy it."
"Pours a very light straw yellow in color with a very small fizzy white head. No lacing is seen to mention. The aroma is better than the taste and is of some sweet fruits. The taste is well...really bad! Like drinking a lightly flavored club soda or seltzer water. Way to much carbonation, and even more than other Bud products. Overall, I will not be drinking this one again!"

"O-okay beer that was not too sweet, and would be good for a hot summer day"
""
"O: Not overly offensive but not something that I would ever pick up again - the flavors and aromas are a little too artificial for me. Best served ice cold because the flavors did not improve as this beer warmed up during the drinking."

"This is my favorite summertime beer. My friends and I always take a cooler full to the beach! I have had such a hard time finding it this year. I have heard people say they are going to be discontinuing it...I will be devastated! DON'T TAKE OUR FAVORITE SUMMER BEER AWAY! We LOVE IT!!! :-)"
"Out of all of the other beers produced by the big 3 brewers I like Michelob the best, however this beer does not have any balance the flavors just do not work together at all. It tastes like they just added fruit flavorings to a beer. This is not something I would try again."

"This is what it advertises to be. It's very light and has a fruity flavor. The carbonation is the worst part. It's even worse than the most carbonated soda. I'll won't ever be picking this up again."
"Once more, the harder that I poured, the quicker the fizzy, bone-white head seemed to dissipate. Color was a pale yellow with NE-quality clarity and a good bit of carbonation in evidence. Nose was a bit too perfume-like for my taste, certainly of raspberry, but much too sweet, almost like chemically-engineered esters than anything natural. Mouthfeel was thin and watery with a fizziness like pop and a really sweet flavor, again more like pop than beer. It has usually been my experience that raspberries impart a tartness in beer, not the sweetness that this had. Maybe it could be blamed on the pomegranate, but it was just a beer for people who really don't like beer. Finish was still much too sweet for my liking."

"I like this one better than the dragonfruit-peach, but it really isn't too close to beer either. These fruit-flavored Michelob Ultras really are for non-beer drinkers."
"This is definitely a mistake I will not make again!!"
"HORRIBLE weak SWILL,DON'T EVEN THINK I CAN USE THIS SLOP FOR A MARINADE!!Always have liked Mick but will NEVER buy it again :Very sad that they have stooped so low,this is just plain undrinkable,lol,Pitiful and sad...Specially since it sells for a premium price! I've learned my lesson the hard way:("

"Overall: A decent beer that is barely beer enough to not be a wine cooler. Not a fruit drink, but not the first thing I would go for. Of this series, it is probably my least favorite as well."
"Just like the ULTRA Dragon Fruit Peach, this does not taste like beer, but rather a fruity soda of some sort. So if this is what you look for in a beer, you might enjoy this. Pomegranate is a unique flavor for a beer which is why I gave this a shot. It has an extremely light color and will not fill you up while it refreshes you on a hot summer afternoon."
"This was “beer” one of three from a 12 pack sampler at a friend’s house. I only drank half of each beer. I can’t imagine anyone who actually likes beer drinking more than that."
"I had this quote in my notes, which I must have said: ""Doesn't age (aka 2 hours) on my deck very well."" Quite true. It certainly got worse as the open bottle sat around in the sun for awhile, though rest assured, I reviewed this under the optimal conditions of it being at its ideal serving temperature, i.e. just above freezing."
"Beer is sweet and thin with a grainy / acidic aftertaste. It is basically soda at this point with a beer-y late palate and aftertaste. It is about as far from beer as you can get in aroma and taste and still call it beer. Who is this marketed to? Children?"
"We decided we needed a liquid to bridge the gap between the hops and stouts of our tasting. This was the answer. I guess it doesn't look horrible. Berlinner Weiss sort of color, hazy pale gold with a bizarrely attractive and retentive white head. Aroma is effed. Childhood nightmares of coughing attacks and Robitussin return. Flavor is less offensive but we're still trafficking in cough syrup with a raspberry aftertase Um, whatevs."
"12 ounce bottle, picked up a single of this at Liquor Barn. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours a clear straw gold color with about a half inch white head. Pretty much no head retention at all, but there's a decent bit of lacing on the glass. Aroma is sweet and fruity, it smells like candied pomegranates and raspberries. There aren't any ""beer-like"" aromas, but it does have a nice fruity smell. The brew tastes like slightly watered down pomegranates and raspberries. Mouthfeel/body is light and watery, it has moderate carbonation, it's smooth and it's easy enough to drink. It's an OK fruity drink, but it seems more like a malt beverage than a beer. As much as I hate to say it, I liked it a lot more than I thought I was going to."
"O/D-No dice. Simply not gonna work here. I like the two fruits they chose but this beer kinda blows."
"I am not quite sure what they were trying to dockers. I'm assuming appeal to the female maybe. I know plenty of girls who would hate this. Maybe it's their way of completing with the flavored malt beverages out there. Either way this isn't worth buying. It's still the same boring pale beer now with some watered down added flavors. Blah!"
"thankfully the last one of the night as they were just not good beers, more like wine coolers then beers for me, again just not good."
"D- Like a soda but less sweet. Tonic water with artificial flavoring and waaaay too much carbonation. Not offensive, but almost."
"D: This isn't offensive, at least, but it would be cheaper to just buy a bottle of flavored soda or tonic water."
"The beer pours a clear, very light yellow color with a white head. The aroma is raspberries and bready malt, without much else. The flavor is pomegranate, raspberries, corn, bread and water. Not only is the beer very watery feeling, it tastes like a glass of water with a splash of fruit juice added to it. Medium carbonation and a thin, watery mouthfeel."
"Over all, it tastes good, but it's a girly flavored drink... not a real manly beer, even for snotty connoisseurs."
"More alcoholic juice than beer. It's light, tastes and smells fruity, and goes down fairly easy, but you don't want to have too many or you will get sick to the stomach. It does not go well with food either. But its light and tastes OK. Good for those who don't like actual beer, but like to pretend they do, I guess."
"D- Drinkable beer. Better than the other flavors they came out with. Still this is not really beer I think just some watered down raspberry flavor with some artifical sweetness added to it."
"My wife was drinking one of these in the backyard last night, so I figured I would give it a try. Pretty nice golden color, with a decent enough white head. This was the best feature of this beer (in fact, I think it was appropriate for the style, allowing me to score it above 3.0 if I so choose). Not much else to say here; lots of fake raspberry flavor, very sugary, almost like a sickly sweet soda. Nothing good going on here."
"Much better than the regular Michelob Ultra - the ""fruitiness"" of it covers the nastiness of that. The body, also, is a bit different for a light beer. Thought it was going to be too fizzy or too sweet, but wasn't...really wasn't much of anything but some mild fruitiness with a decent smoothness."
"Pretty sucky. But drinkable."
"Fizzy yellowy brown in color. Smell is a mellow blend of pomegranate and raspberry. Taste is thankfully not as cloyingly sweet as the lime version. Some notes of pale malts. Drink while its ice cold or the flavors become somewhat medicinal."
"From 355 ml. bottle no. 09070BM33. Sampled on January 10, 2010. The pour is a light yellow color with upwardly mobile carbonation. The white head is thin and short-lived. The aroma is too overpowered by the pomegranate and raspberry add-ins to be able to distinguish anything remotely close to malts or hops. Thin mouthfeel, which is average for a light beer. But it also has this honey-like texture as well. The taste is so entrenched in pomegranate and raspberry that it ends up coming off more like a wine cooler than a beer. Oh well, I guess they'll try any combination once."
"definitely marketed towards women and maybe the female fitness crowd."
"The mouthfeel is as close to water as you can get without actually being water. Very light and lightly sweetened with a good dose of carbonation which does make it kind of refreshing and easy to drink. One word of warning however. Do not let this beer get anywhere near room temperature or it gets really awful. If you do want to try it, get it as cold as you can."
"I ended up giving the rest of it to my Mom who was moderately amused by it. Hmm..."
" ~ This was left at my place after a cookout a few weeks back. I'm glad to have had the chance to try it but I won't be sampling this brew again anytime soon."
"Notes: There isn't much to say about this. It is pretty much michelob ultra with just some kind of flavoring agent added that takes what little flavor it had to begin with and covers it up completely. You'd be better off with a raspberry wine cooler."
"I actually had hopes for this one b/c I like pomegranate water and was thinking it would taste like this but w/ alcohol. Dead wrong. It's not even a chick beer as the girl I bought it for drank twice as me (two sips to my one) before dumping it down the sink. It is a straw gold bodied beer that is thin and watery and designed to go down nice and easy with sweet razz/pom taste. Instead, it is a little sour and sharp and tastes like a diet cherry 7Up that was left on the counter for awhile. This is really not palatable at all."
"Bottle pour into shaker Aug. 14, 2009. Pours mostly pale yellow with very thin white head. At least there was some aroma to this - basically a water light beer with flavor added. Not too bad after 18 holes of golf on a hot summer day. Not much here,but it was better than regular Ultra or B. Light."
"I disregarded the fact that this was a Michelob, as most people who reviewed it did not and thus decided it was going to be bad before consuming it. It's not that terrible, very drinkable, but shouldn't be considered beer."
"A better version of Michelob Ultra, but the bar is set pretty low"
"D: If you miss Zima, this might be for you.... But if you want beer forget about it..."
"Drinkability - this beer is simply stupid. i cannot imagine who would voluntarily purchase this. This is the most yuppie concoction ever produced. Pomegranate beer....I have officially seen it all. I have never thrown a six pack away, but I am throwing bottles away as we speak. You've been warned, it's really that bad."
"Not a great marriage of fruit flavors and beer, especially since neither are actually well-represented here. It's not horrible but it's not impressive either."
"Pours a huge foamy white head, quickly diminishing, with a very clear pale yellow colored body. Very strong raspberry and cherry (pomegranate?) aromas, very enticing. Some malts too, but very sweet smelling. Mmmm, cherries. Very cherry taste, some bitter raspberry, and dryness on the end. Somewhat cloying sweetness. Very fruity tasting, but simple, very cherry, and some raspberry. Refreshing, but very sweet."
"Holy chick beer. I'm really trying to take the purpose of this beer into consideration when reviewing it. It's fruity crap for people who don't like beer and therefore they should be drinking a Mike's Hard Lemonade or rum and Coke. Nevertheless, it's a pale pee color with a large white head that disappears very quickly. It looks like apple juice with a periodic bubble escaping to the surface. Smells like fruit. I drink a POM pomegranate juice from time to time and I eat raspberries and I suppose those odors are present. Along with a faint, faint stink of lreally light beer trying to poke through. It doesn't taste bad it just doesn't taste anything like beer. In fact, I pick up on just about no beer qualities whatsoever. Nonexistant malt, hops, or anything you'd find in real beer. It's water-thin and very lightly carbonated. Overall it's closer to a fruit juice than a beer. It's easy to drink, though. This is children's beer if there ever was such a thing. There's two more types of Ultra in the variety 12 pack that I got..."
"not beer. is this non-alcoholic? there is not an alcohol flavor to be had. there is nary a typical beer flavor also, so it goes without saying. i would put this in plastic bottles and have them iced for after a basketball game. thirst quenching, but far from scratching my itch for an actual beer."
"Overall: I have nothing to say about this beverage. If you have nothing nice to say don't say anything at all."
"d: I admit that this doesn't taste absolutely horrible, it just doesn't taste like beer at all."
"Drinkable? How can you deny it? Drinkable as beer...NFW."
"Pale yellow colored beer with a rapidly fading head like the kind you would have with soda.Aroma is raspberry.Taste is fruit dominated by the raspberry.It goes down easy and with very little carbonation.Overall I liked it but it's nothing that's going to knock your socks off!!"
""
"overall: this stuff sucks, no way about it please do not pay money for it, im trying someone elses out of curiosity but please dont waste you money"
"Overall, not as bad as I was hoping. It's definitely bad, but I've had worse. Nice try, Dyan. I'll have to see about getting you some Amnesia IPA."
"And I do believe that their original regular Ultra certainly does have a place on the great beer shelf of life."
"Pours a extremely pale golden color. A fluffy two finger tall head perches itself for longer than expected ,and then leaves lots of lacing(probably from the sugary additives). This nose is sweet,not in a good way. Very artificial and reminiscent of sugary pixi-stix,good when your an adolescent,not good when they combine it with beer. The flavors are much the same. Quite offensive in my opinion,reminds me of watered down Clearly Canadian. Very thin and watery,though the carbonation is somewhat acceptable. The finish is of sticky artificial sweetener and candy corn. This is horrible...no wonder my girlfriend loves it."
"This is more like a soda than a beer and should be avoided."
"Picked this one up cause I'm a sucker for novelty. Out of the bottle this beer was a pale gold color with a fizzy white head that was short lived. It did, however, retain a pure white soap-skim ring that laced tiny bubbles moderately. The aroma was sweet and all raspberry extract. The flavors were at first sweet, the fruit extracts hit me as decent but then it all went south. Stale grain and stale corn. No pomegranate flavor can be pulled out of the raspberry syrup that is stomping all over it. Hops and malt are quashed too. Mouthfeel is very fizzy and a little rough, the body light. To its only credit it is crisp but the aftertaste is unpleasant and metallic so even that's hard to enjoy. I always hate to fail a beer but this one deserves it."
"D: Nope, I ain't drinking any more!"
"D: I somehow managed to choke this down, I would NEVER buy it again and I might ask for my money back. I honestly didn't hate regular Michelob Ultra, which isn't great in its own regrad, but this is a wine cooler trying to be a beer and it just fails miserably."
"not what i consider drinkable... as soon as i finished a bottle, i wased it down with a different beer or some soda, just to get that artifical taste out of my mouth."
"Appearance is of the fizzy yellow beer vein, with a quickly fleeting head. Light specks of lacing left behind. Aroma tart raspberries of the artificial kind at that, smells like candy wheres the beer. Straight up carbonation in flavor with a raspberry syrupy flow, pretty much unbearable. Definitely brought into my home by friends, fizzy thin cloying mouthfeel no thanks. Drinkability this is the worst of the three at least the two citrus based versions were refreshing and no worse than a chill, Bud Light lime, or a Corona with a lime."
"12 oz. bottle. Basically, I think this beer was made for 12 year old girls. Not that I'm mad about that... A friend's girl brought this to our last tasting. I had to try it. Poured a transparent yellow, fizzy white head. It basically tasted like fruity gas-water. Aroma and flavor was raspberry (all artificial). Very, very light on the palate, fizzy. I guess if I were in the desert and had to chose between this and camel piss...I'd chose this. Maybe"
"Drinkability- It is a great beer for people who want to say they drink beer but don't or a training wheel beer."
"Clear bottle as pictured, part of a make your own sixpack from a local grocery. Pours a clear, pale yellow body alive with active carbonation. Tiny white head quickly vanishes without lacing. Aroma is some kind of berry Pez candy, not a bad smell except for a beverage masquerading as a beer. Very light bodied, very thin actually. Seltzer water carbonation rules the palate, lightly flavored a liquid Pez candy or Jolly Rancher aspect. The artificial fruitiness isn't sickingly sweet, to its credit,but that's about the only thing to recommend it. This might make a good beginner beer for someone who has never had an alcoholic beverage, making me think this is marketed for underage drinkers. Give me some fruit syrup and seltzer water and I could produce something very similar in taste. This Ultra is very forgettable. A waste of money at any price."
"It's fairly refreshing and not undrinkable, but it ain't beer. Suffice it to say that I wouldn't recommend this to any beer lover."
"I can see where some people (who don't like the taste of beer) would drink this. But I really can't believe it's on this site. Not good at all unless you're looking for alcoholic fruit punch."
"D - Not as bad as I anticipated, actually. This is probably my favorite of the Michelob Ultra fruity beer series. This, along with Lime Cactus and Tuscan Orange or Apricot or whatever is much better than the regular Michelob Ultra, which is tasteless IMO."
"Drinkability: Their Tuscan Orange was acceptable, but this, however, was so intensely artificial in flavor as to be unpleasant."
"Apart from the ""lime in the Corona"" this is my first of the fruit beers. Should have been a little wary when all the girls went crazy for it. Poured about a half-inch head, faded in 15 seconds. Some lacing that lasted a bit. Very light. Could definitely smell the pom. rasberry fruits. Didn't taste like a beer at all. Rather, it resembled a good fruit drink gone a little sour. Was extremely easy to drink, but don't plan on going with what's easy in the future."
"Drinkability... no. Just... no. Avoid it."
"This brew is delicious! I'll be drinking many more this summer. It's just as tasty as other fruit beers, but not as heavy!"
"Pours a three finger white head that vanishes in a minute and leaves no lace. Clear ugly greenish amber color. strong carbonation and light bodied. Sweet raspberry nose. Flavor is sweet raspberry, squeaky clean finish. Good session beer for the non-beer drinker, nothing here for the serious beer drinker. Brewed on Mar 5, 2008, $1.50 for a 12oz bottle from Capitol Convenience Concord, NH."
"Not recommended, though...."
"This was free at a recent marathon runner's expo. Normally, the best tasting beer is free beer, but that does not really apply to this beer. Poured a pale, translucent gold with a smallish wispy head. Head quickly disappears. Pomegranate raspberry highlights the nose and taste of this brew, both vying for your attention. Really light, ultra light on taste. Mostly just overcarbonation and alcohol is all you notice. Would drink again if free, but doubtful that I'd ever purposely purchase this one."
"Overall, I'm not going to knock this just because it is a lite fruit beer from michelob. As far as advertising what it is and focused on people who would normally buy this, i think they did a decent job (though they say ultra but it has over 100 calories and 6 grams of carbs...sounds more like a solid light beer :) I wouldnt want to drink more than one of these at a time, but the light flavor and the mild fruity sweetness and lack of bitterness makes this an easy chugger after cutting the grass. Not one i would stamp my approval on, but not one i would really cut down."
"Not sure what to make of this one. It's not undrinkable, but it's pretty far from being good. It's more a beer with no real reason for existing. One can only wonder what Mic was shooting for here."
"Presentation: Packaged in a twelve-ounce clear glass bottle with a twist-off crown, served in a standard pint tap glass."
"I didn't expect to love Ultra Pomegranate Raspberry, but I did expect it to be drinkable. Live and learn. According to one of their press releases, the brewery's target is females, ages 21-49. It's hard to imagine anyone liking this abomination, no matter their sex, age or degree of dementia."
"hates them right back...."
"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, beer is similar to a standard light lager in appearance; a clear straw colored beer with a bubbly, white head. The smell is nothing like a beer, very sweet and Kool-Aid like. The taste is exactly like the smell, very sweet and no apparent beer about it. Very fruity, actually tastes pretty good but nothing like a beer. The mouthfeel is very light with a fizzy carbonation and slightly dry finish. A drinkable ""beer", would be good on a hot day but nothing a true beer drinker would be impressed with."
"The fruit flavoring wasn't overpowering, which, frankly, was surprising. I'm not sure what they were going for here. If I wanted a fruit flavored alcoholic drink with carbonation, this wouldn't be my choice, and if I specifically want a beer with fruit characteristics, this wouldn't be my choice either."
"...so after a great day at a brewery and hanging out with friends, the pool looked great! but before the cooling process could begin I spyed a lady friend drinking one of these and grabbed one. 'oh yeah' Pours a light straw colour with some light lacing from the small head..'oh yeah'..Has some nice fruity aroma's that don't smell too artificial..'oh yeah'.. Taste is what you would expect from a fruit flavoured mass marketed drink, but as with the aroma, doesn't taste to fake- just muddled.. Overall, better than i thought it would be but still lacks anything a real beer drinker would want! ...'oh yeah'"
"Comes in a clear bottle, but since theres no beer in here  no light struck worries."
"D - If you like pomegranate juice or raspberry juice then this is for you. Otherwise, if you like beer taste look for something else."
"Thanks to Pegasus for not making me buy this karma point."
"D- This beer is very light with very little flavor. The fruit flavors were very chemical and dry and there were no real qualities I look for in beer. I think I would rather drink water but it wasn't a drain pour."
"Michelob Ultra Pemegranate Raspberry comes in a clear twelve ounce bottle and pours a light golden color that seems to have a pinkish tint to it. The white head quickly falls to being very thin. It smells like Kool Aid. It tastes a bit like Kool Aid too (I can mostly taste raspberry, but there might be some pomegranate too), except it's not very sweet, followed by some adjunct flavor. A light wine cooler equivalent. I actually think it's better than most wine coolers I've had, but it's not very good for beer."
"It is what it is, and it's not too bad. Pretty decent actually. I would buy more of this for what it's worth to share with friends who maybe want something really light and refreshing. A spritzer of a beer if ever there was one."
"Very light bodied, a bit watery, but could work as a hot weather cooler if you like the taste."
"D: Average, but considering it came from AB, it's a step in the right direction. They're exploring new territory, which I commend, but why do this beer in a ""light"" format? Go full flavor and you'll have peoples attention. Worth trying. I could take it or leave it."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: It's light bodied. It doesn't taste good. That alone makes it incredibly hard to drink. I'm not a big fan of fruit/vegetable beers and this is no exception. But there are a few out there that are much better than this. Overall, it's not good. I find it hard to call it a beer."
"Exactly like the other few Ultras that have added flavors, just a different flavor. Very wine-cooler-esque, with a fizzy complexion, anti-head retention, and dominant fruit flavors. The flavors again, improve the brew, but does not improve the beer-like qualities -- just makes it a bit more enjoyable to drink. A bit tart from the pomegranete and raspberry flavoring, but sweetened to balance. Still light and watery on the palate with a void aftertaste."
"Definitely a session beer on a hot summer day. Good to pair against a spinach salad with strawberries. A surprisingly average effort for such a light beer. Something to keep on hand to try and convert the malternative crowd."
