"If you want your beer to taste like water this is the one to get."
"Yuengling Premium Light Beer brewed by Yuengling Brewery, with an ABV of 3.50%  This brew pours out a nice amber color with a nice white head. The smell is nice with grains and malts. You pick up a hit of hops in this brew.  Now for the taste,  it is light, but bold with flavor. There is a lot going on in this light brew.  The mouthfeel is nice, clean, and refreshing.  There is nothing overpowering in Yuengling Premium Light Beer.  This brew has a nice balance to it.  Overall I'm going Yuengling Premium Light Beer a 4.25 out 5 I would buy this brew again."

"DATE TASTED: December 7, 2013... GLASSWARE: Michelob pilsner...OCCASION: Championship Saturday in the NCAA... APPEARANCE: typical straw-gold body of effervescence; white,, thin head that smears atop the bubbles; streaky lacing... AROMA: high-pitched oat and corn, with some fragrant bubblegum hops--inoffensive... PALATE: smooth, mega-drinkable; gassy, bubbly and brief in its substance...TASTE: astringently malty, thin, with a profile of a sweetened light beer; not memorable or substantial...OVERALL: as Yuenglings go, on the bottom rung; Solo cup filler, but much less a party staple than the original lager..."

"Overall â€“ Well for a light beer, it is kind of run of the mill to slightly above so. Crisper and somewhat refreshing, but lacking of substantial flavor and any real degree of complexity."

"Medium hop bitterness and a clean aftertaste. As far as light lagers this holds up. Nothing to write home about but nothing wrong."

"This beer poured out as a clear looking yellow color with a fizzy white head on top. The lacing was light not much retention. The smell was sweet, a little grainy some lager yeast in there too. The taste had some corn flavors in there, sweet grains and a faint bitterness in the finish. The mouthfeel was light, nicely carbonated and very easy to drink. Overall I was glad I got to try this one as I haven't seen this one around much. I feel this one is better than the light lager."

"Overall one of the few light beers out there that has a light yeast taste and for that I do really like it. It is easy on the palates and when your looking for a a go to or a fail safe this just might be it. Salud!"

"overall: light pilsner, nothing to knock, yet nothing spectacular, very good casual drinkability."
"O: This is a beer that I will buy again"
"Once more, we have an example of Greg Koch's ""fizzy yellow beer"" and I poured it into a Sam Adams ""Perfect Pint"" glass. The glass really helped with head retention and I had a little over a finger of creamy, bone-white head. Color was a pale lemon yellow with NE-quality clarity. Nose smelled heavily of cereal adjuncts. Blah! Mouthfeel was somewhat thin and the taste was fairly bland. I was definitely not impressed. Finish was likewise bland, watery and dull. This is one of my least favorite styles, even less than AMLs and AALs, both staples of The CANQuest (TM) and this was a pretty light example."
"I'll say this, at least it retains a level of flavor on par with the regular version. And its miles better than something like a Bud Light. I guess if you have to have a light beer, I can't think of a better one. But it's still a light beer. Easy enough to drink but not very good."
"Pale yellow colored beer with a rapidly fading head.Aroma and taste are light and fresh.Goes down just like water.Pefect for summer outings or in the fall watching football.Overall a good light beer.I would recommend and will probably be buying it again shortly in the future."
"My preference in beers tends toward the British Isles, especially Scotch Ales, so malt is what I crave. I've been forced to drink crap like Bud Light because that's what one of my drinking buddies likes (this is WV, and exposure to real beers is at a minimum), but that's just me being sociable. You don't have to force me to drink Yuengling Light, for when I want lower ABV, so I can spend an afternoon putzing around on the deck, this beer more than adequately fits the bill. Regular Yuengling's is my fav American macro, and the light comes in neatly behind."
"very light bodied, a typical mass production lager."
"Amazing light beer and value. Another workmanlike, good beer from Yuengling."
"D- Easy to drink, just boring and bland."
"Pours a very light straw color with a bit of a white head. Th nose brigs some grain, grass, and a bit of corn. Taste is moderately sweet with grass and grain elements. Light feel with fairly high carbonation. His goes down easy and does not have any real off flavors, it is simply quite light."
"This is nothing that I'd pay for, but I've ""enjoyed"" worse beer from many a brewer in the past, so I'd probably drink this if someone shoved it into my hand : )"
"Overall: Very boring & lifeless. Flavored water with an off-putting taste. Pass!"
"Drinks alright, nothing to get excited about, but nothing too nasty either. I could do 1 or 2 on a Summer's day if pressed..."
"It is clear, cold, carbonated, and beats BMCs typical offerings soundly. In my area, south central PA, you can get the stuff for about $13 a case on sale. When the weather turns colder, I'll be happy to turn back to heavier stuff, but right now in this 100 degree heat it is working for me."
"D: Drinks pretty good, but with a lager as good as Premium Beer available year round (and not much higher in abv) I'd go for that every time."
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of, well, nothing. Taste is also missing for the most part, some gentle notes of malt and corn. Feels light in the mouth and is very drinkable, good for beer games. Overall this is a very mediocre light beer."
"Had to try this PA beer. ""Lager"" is a staple around here so this distant cousin should be OK, right? Appearance was light and fizzy, somewhat yellow. Smell was almost nonexistant as was the taste. Then again it's light. Mouthfeel was thin as you'd expect. Drinkability was high and this would be a perfect summer yardwork beverage. The 3.5% would make it easy to drink all day and still be able to mow or play volleyball. Would choose this over a mass produced brew just for the PA factor."
"Compared to most light lagers this one drinks like a dream, a really great tasting light drinking beer. It's a lawnmower beer that you don't have to think about it's for hydrating and satisfying the beer craving. Appears a pale golden color with a light fizzy white head forms ample scattered lacing. Aroma has a light cereal note semi sweet with a touch of grassy hops in the background. Clean tasting flavor from front to back with a wimsy light malt biscuit background and a touch of grassy hops, I drank a good bit of this at my father in law's 50th birthday last year. It was hot outside and it just kept going down so smooth. Mouthfeel is light bodied carbonation a little too much pretty unnatural, crisp overall mouthfeel no metallic harshness. Drinkability is up there with the most drinkable brews in number, not that this one will fill your tastebuds with satisfaction as a starter beer these would make great training wheels."
"This is an interesting light beer. Bout what you would expect from nomal light beers when it comes to appearance. The smell was practically non existant. The taste however is pretty good with a little bitterness from the hops. Mouthfeel is light for sure which makes for a average drinkability."
" Very clear, yellow in color. Plenty of foam. No real nose other than a generic beer smell. Which is better than an offensive smell I suppose. Tastes like it smells. Very boring but safe light malt flavour. Watery mouthfeel. Good amount of carbontion. More drinkable than alot of macro lights but far from great."
"Taste is Very plain and bland. It's not bad and a bit sweet but it's really plain and Nondescript. It has light and smooth mouthfeel and it's pretty damn easy to drink esp with such a low abv"
"Interested to try this after trying the regular ""Premium Beer."" Pours pale straw with light cloudiness and over an inch of fizzy white head. Lots of bubbles coming up, but hardly any head retention. Smells of corn and a bit of plastic. Not too bad of a smell but sadly lacking all of the straw/grassy quality of the regular beer. Tastes of corn, grains, some plastic, though at least it does carry a more pronounced bitterness than most big name light lagers. Light bodied, fizzy but also nicely prickly on the mouthfeel. For a light lager this is okay."
"For the style I think this beer is a good representation, but necessarily a ""good beer."""
"M/D - Mouthfeel is light, the beer gets out of the way and falls down your throat. About what I would expect. This would certainly be a go-to for pizza or a session when I had to drive soon."
"This is very, very light and easy to drink, but there is hardly any flavor at all."
"Pours a medium yellow..minimal head. Smell is faintly malty..a tad skunky. Taste is light syrupy malt. Mouthfeel is smooth and it goes down smoothly..to be expected for a light brew. Probably a good lawnmower beer, Definitely a brew to have with something salty."
"Average light beer. Period. It's pretty typical for this style, can't think of much to say about it that could be improved upon. As compared to Miller and Bud Light beers, the taste is a little ""thin."" I didn't taste much flavor of any kind behind it, and it seems a little more watery than other beers I've tried in this category. Not good, but not bad either."
"d. Went well with a big italian meal. I had a few of these, and they hit the spot. Low alcohal helps the drinkability, and overall I've had much worse."
"D: Easy to drink? Not so much. I hated the ""taste"" (I think water has a lot more flavor) and I would never have a second one. It is not the styles fault...this was just a bad job. While I am wary about trying this again, I wonder if there was something wrong with the bottle, because I cannot explain why this beer gets such high ratings on BA."
"D: If you must drink a light, this is tastier than anything from BMC, especially Miller Lite which this beer would be closest too. Still, IC Light in aluminum bottles seems like a bit tastier, which doesn't say much. I love the Y, but I'll have none of these light beers."
"It looks like 'America's Oldest Brewery' claims the Macro Smackdown XXI crown. That doesn't mean that it's great beer, just that it had 'bupkis' for competition. As a low calorie rehydrator... okay. Just don't kid yourself that you're drinking real beer."
"Glad I only had one sample - that's more than enough. Even for a light beer, it doesn't work very well."
"Overall an uneventful light lager."
"Medium straw with a small, white, foamy, slowly diminishing head. Some light lacing. Smells of light grain and cereal with a light floral aroma and some very light brown sugar. Tastes of light grain and cooked veggie. It has a thin body, lightly slick texture and moderate carbonation. A step up from most macro lights, but nothing special."
"Cheers!"
"Not a bad light lager. Poured out to a clear and clean golden color with a nice long lived foamy head. No notes of lacing. Aromas of bread and mild hops were nice, but a bit bland. Something was missing. Taste was middle of the road; some malt, some grain, and some water. No suprises here. Mouthfeel was ok, but could've benefited from better carbonation. Drinkability is fair. I'd go for regular Yuenling first. Thanks to MaltyGoodness for the sample."
"I am truely amazed to find a lighter version of Yuengling's Premium. with a little bit Less malt . And not too bitter . The smell is spring fresh with no skunk to ruin your day. and blindfolded I dont think you could tell the difference in the taste from the Premium. {I am becoming quite a fan of Yuengling as one might tell]"
". It turns out that ""Premium"" is a euphamism for ""Macro"". That's what this is, Yuengling Brewery doing a Macro style beer, as opposed to Traditional, which is well traditional (That's Amber American Lager, it was a style which was a much bigger pre-prohibition staple in America). Anyway the color is a sort of clear-gold. Not nearly as deep as say Urquell but noticably more amber than most macros. Compared to the Traditional its lighter and clearer. Smell is pretty boring. A little sweet grain and a lot of hops. The hops are kind of hard to describe. I guess I'd call them metallic or typical macro if I found them objectionable, but I don't. They're pretty bitter, but leave no unpleasant aftertaste. They're clean and surprisingly strong for the style, but still not too interesting. I guess the best way to describe them would be typical macro hops if typical macro hops were't disgusting. They are balanced by light malts that are slightly sweet. Mouthfeel is all about carbonation. Maybe this would feel thin if not for all those bubbles, but I honestly can't tell you. I could taste the beer fine, but carbonation was all the mouthfeel I could get. Drinkability is fine. You could definately drink these all night. The hops don't get in my way, the taste isn't bad, nothing is wrong with this except that no store or bar exists that carries this unless they carry the Traditional Lager as well, so why bother? This is obviously what Yuengling brewed to catch the Budweiser crowd."
"The beer pours a pale gold color with a thick frothy white head that quickly fades to lacing. The aroma is average. It has a light pale malt scent that is slightly sweet and dry with lager yeast aroma. The taste is average as well. It has a very light pale malt flavor with some adjuncts. It is watery, but has more flavor than most light lagers. It goes down easy and finishes dry and a bit musty. The mouthfeel is decent. It is a low bodied beer with good carbonation. This is an average light lager and quite possibly the weakest offering from Yuengling"
"Piured a clear amber color with large puffy white head. There is littel aroma except for a generic beer smell. Taste is very light with no note of hops. Mouth feel is average. Easy to drink, good beer for a hot summer afternoon when you are having more than one"
"This poured very light and was a pale golden color. Small thin head turned into a film after a sip or two. Very clear. The aroma is very light and has a slight musty graininess. ThereÂ’s a perfumey, dank smell that here, the same that I get from other Yuengling products. The taste is light, tangy and has a clean finish. The body is light, of course, but is more sweeter than most other light beers. For a light beer, this isnÂ’t all that bad. It has some of the same characteristics as their regular beer, but lighter. Easy to drink, I enjoyed it."
"It has an extremely light feeling, almost watery, this definatley contributes to it's drinkability. It has a very clea, crisp taste to it, as well, which definatly helps. Has a light, bread like aroma, with a hint of malt and hops for flavor, noting really dominat. This is a watery light beer, whihc makes it rather drinable and it's only stron seeling point. Enjoy"
"Yuenglings answer to a BMC light beer. Drunk straight from the can, I have to knock a point for appearance. Aromas are of light breads and faint, old hops and they are more subdued in the can version of this beer than they are in the bottled version. The taste is similar to the aroma and is not very complex at all. As a light beer this is OK, but the watery mouthfeel makes the drinkability a low score!"
"Bought it for the wife and decided to have one of the six,pours a clear straw color with a decent head,the aroma is very iron-like with some grainy notes.The taste is crisp and very clean with a light malty biscuit flavor to it,very clean beer.Hey this is one of the better ""light"" bers out there not real good but would have at a family gathering over AB products any time."
"A crystal-clear, light-straw colored body is topped by a decent sized head of creamy bright white foam. The retention is limited and it drops in size rather quickly; but surprisingly leaves some nice lace as it goes. The nose offers very little more than a generic ""beer"" character. The body is light and crisp on the tongue. Not unlike the aroma, the flavor offers very little. There's a delicate touch of malt and a backing bitterness, but nothing really stands out. It finishes as short and dry as it begins. It's not a bad light beer in comparison to many others, however, as it's clean and straightforward without any ""odd"" notes to it. It's simply watered down Yuengling Premium and that's fine. But for the 10 or so calories, I'd rather have the extra flavor in the standard version."
"Poured a crystal clear bright yellow with a fairly fizzy white head that lasted for an adequate time on the surface. No lacing. Very tough to pick out any aroma (note the strange looks from the wife's relatives while I smell my beer...). What small amount of aroma I could get was mostly a raw, grainy smell. Taste was better than expected. Very clean and crisp. Flavor is on the subdued side, with only a slightly hoppy bitterness kicking in at the end. Mouthfeel is tolerable for a light beer. Drinkability is average, too. Not a bad offering from Yuengling."
"This is in contention with Coors Light and Stroh's Light as the most watery beer I have had. Of course I am no fan of light beers in the first place, but I would take Yuengling Light Lager (the light version of Yuengling Traditional Lager) over this. I can't recommend Yuengling Premium Light."
"In the world of watered-down light beers, this one stands out.  There is a decent hop presence to this beer.  While not a powerhouse, it stands up tall and along with Sam Adams Light, proves that a light can be decent (notice I said decent and not good).  Nice offering.  Yuengling keeps impressing me."
"Pale yellow to gold color and very clear. White head.  Malt/hop and very fresh smelling nose.  Fine white lace in the glass.A great look (which is rare in a light beer).  A persistant white sheen stays on the surface of the brew.  Crisp clean taste with a sturdy malt base.  The hop finish gives just enough bitterness to leave your mouth wanting more.  This is a great domestic light beer.  The mouth is solid and smooth for a light beer also..."
"The light version of Yuengling Premium.  Less malt than it should have. Slightly bitter, but highly drinkable.  Smell is clean and fresh.  It is sometimes almost undistinguishible from the Premium.  This is also good on draught."
