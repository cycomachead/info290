"this has just a hint of the European flavor also"
"Typical flavorless adjunct lager. Could be mistaken for any light flavorless beer."

"Great on a hot day or at the beach not much else."

"Watery yellow fizzy beer, not great"

"This is the first time I had this beer since my trip to Puerto Rico about a decade ago. I remember drinking little 10 oz. cans on the beach. Anyway, poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a pale yellow color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is mild, some hints of grains. Taste is light and really bland. Some corn, not much else. Feels light in the mouth and overall, nothing offensive, and fine on a hot day, but greatly lacking in flavor."
"Great light beer to drink all day/erry day in Rincon!"
"I am fairly certain I could make this beer.  All I need is water and some light syrup.  There really is nothing there.  But.....I love it.  I am usually sitting on a beach in Puerto Rico or being dragged into the ocean to die by the undertow when I am drinking it (the ocean water is a little higher quality than the beer).....but it is perfect.  This beer should never be exported from the island.  Craving my next Medalla"

"It's water with corn and a touch of alcohol. Nothing to it. One can easily tear through 18 of these and binge on delicious fried foods next to the beach..not saying I did...but one could..."

"Light? Absolutely. It shouldn't, however, feel like soda with nothing to the body whatsoever."

"Bight straw colored with lots of carbonation bubbles inside. The white head quickly dissipates almost entirely and only covers about half of the top of the beer. Aroma is of corn and sweaty gym socks. The flavor is primarily corn with a hint of Saaz bittering hops with a somewhat salty aftertaste. Mouth is thin and quaffable. A hot weather beverage."

"It is what it is...Cheap and drinkable. Much like a Corona in Mexico."

"This Light Lager is A-Okay! This is much better than it's American counterparts."

"Actually not terrible, better than bud or coors lite by miles. If ice cold, pairs great with local cuisine like mofongo."

"Had a can from Puerto Rico, thanks Josh. Light pale adjunct lager. Drinkable, but also very comparable to seltzer in taste. Pretty bland and also not as bad as I thought. I could drink this in 100 degree heat if I did not have filtered and bottled water."

"O- This beer is light with almost no flavor. No hops or malt at all but it is also perfectly clean. No sulfur or off-flavors. Just fizzy water."
""
"Flavor is quite dry with a short almost cottony finish. Offers a hint of grain on the feel but is otherwise a bit astringent. Overall the 'dry' nature of this beer was a bit of a surprise, tasting a bit like a light version of an ice beer. But alas, the Cruise Ship awaits.."
"This is the signature puertorican beer. It is made in Mayaguez, and most of the Medalla fans are obviously in that area. College students love it because it is cheap. The color is golden yellow, almost no head when poured into a glass. It smells of grains, pretty unappealing if you ask me. The taste is too carbonated and leaves the hard palate with a dry/uncomfortable feeling. Overall it is a good beer if you like light beers, don't hesitate to give it a try."

"To be fair the can does state “sabor con menos calarias y carbohidratos.” So if there’s no calories or carbs, what’s left? Drink one and find out."
""
"Overall: this beer is very refreshing probably because it tastes like water. No real flavor but nothing bad tasting either"

"O- it's almost water, so on this humid day in puerto Rico, I'll take it."
""

"If I want a light adjunct lager, I'm ordering Coors Light because it tastes the most like water. And honestly I'd much rather have water than any of the above."
""
"Certainly an ok light lager...one that beats most of the big boys out there."
"The wee 10 fl. oz. CAN made me wonder what caused the delay, but the Crack & Glug went off without a hitch. I initially had two fingers of foamy, bone-white head but the retention was not there and it faded into memory pretty quickly. Color was a pale lemon-yellow with NE-quality clarity and lots of CO2 bubbles. Nose smelled of cereal adjuncts and my ""Ho Hum"" meter energized itself. Nothing new here folks, just keep moving. Mouthfeel was medium with a light, lager flavor on the tongue. Finish was semi-dry and definitely refreshing on a humid afternoon. I do not know what more I CAN say about this one. Whoops! I almost missed a bet by not noting that it was my first Puerto RiCAN beer on The CANQuest (TM)."
"O – This is slightly better then BMC’s. It is perhaps a great beer for Puerto Rico and its hot days. Serves cold this makes a nice brew for the island but don’t expect much. That being said I have enjoyed drinking it countless times in the island. You are not going to find any craft choices here so go for it."
"The CPJ"
"The mouthfeel was light bodied with a zippy carbonation. I have used the word ""light"" several times here and it is a good description but not an insult. This is fine beer for hot weather and better than many mass market light lagers."
"For a Light Lager, it's got a crisp, light taste. It's inexpensive, good at a variety of temperatures and needs no garnish. And for a canned beer, it's probably one of the best ones I've ever tasted. It's a puertorrican staple, and probably one of the best beers in the caribbean region."
"Served in a mug with lime, which I tossed to keep the original flavor of the beer. Head was a little better than a finger of foam with lace that was broken, but average cling. Color was a dark yellow, about a 3 on the SRM beer color strip. Smell of burnt corn, boiled oats, and lemon peel. Taste was sharp, with flavors of oatmeal, wheat, malt, citrus, and pepper. Mouthfeel was mildly creamy, with good tingle. Had this beer while I was vacationing in Puerto Rico. Not looking for another in the states, but I will drink it locally."
"O: Pretty good for the style, I like it more than the light lagers from BMC. The slight sweetness helps out."
"Typcial light lager. Refreshing when cold but has undesirable flavors when warming. Drank easy at the street festival."
"The beer selection is pretty thin on the island, with the big 3 American labels and Heineken getting the most play. As long as you're visiting, why not drink something local and get a couple of respect points from the barkeep and waitstaff for supporting their hometown player?"
"Very drinkable brew. For a light beer, this is pretty darn good. I would drink it again if I could get it."
"Taste: Hmm. Clean and inoffensive and in-anything. Then again, so is water. Mouthfeel is fizzy and seltzer like. While I would drink this lying fatly on a beach in Puerto Rico, I can't really think of another time or place I'd want one. Rather boring to be honest, but what were you expecting?"
"Poured a golden straw color, perfectly clear, complete with a foamy white head of 2"". It took a little bit to dissipate, but left some trails of lacing and retained as a thin ring. Even this is impressive for a light lager! Hints of corn sweetness and touch of metallic twang. Sweet and light, just as expected. It is not off-putting by any means. In fact, it has a pleasant sweet and lightly bitter taste, very clean finish, and drinks very much like water. Decently carbonated, although it could use just a touch more crispness. Otherwise, quite drinkable and great for this Florida weather, especially after a long run as I just did. Thanks again BJ!"
"O: one of the better light beers ive had."
"D: This beer is everywhere in PR. It almost seems to be a constant in a sometimes disorderly world. It's simple, refreshing, and seems to always be the perfect beer for this time and place."
"On a technical note: Appearance is a dull, hazy yellow. Fairly well carbonated with a small head. Aroma is essentially non-existant; taste is dull, no crispness, just carbonation."
"Overall: Yet another example of what I call ""Mexi-lager," or in this case, ""Rico-lager."" Definitely drinkable on a hot day; in Puerto Rico it was plentiful and cheap. I came to appreciate this beer over my week-long trip in PR, since the only other readily available choice was Heineken. In its context, not a terrible beer, but now that I'm back in the states with thousands of other options, I won't seek this one out again."
"Better yet try Old Harbor brewpub in San Juan if you can as they have some local variety."
"Not a good beer, but a huge part of my college days."
"This is fairly easy to drink once you can get past the skunkiness, but otherwise it is below average."
"I just returned from Puerto Rico. I have to say, I love PR and I was having such a good time that I could've been drinking moose piss and would've considered it good. Medalla very similar to an american lager. Pours a brown color with a grainy malty taste. Great cold on a hot Puerto Rican day. If you visit PR this is a right of passage. An average beer for a great place. Pretty much 1$ at every bar. I had so many of these things in my pockets and hands from people buying em for me i didnt know what to do with all of em."
"A standard light beer that rides the fence of malt and grain. A brilliantly clear beer fails to hold onto any head, retention, or carbonation because of light protiens and maltiness. Aroma and flavor show a part-grain, part-malt flavor and feel that ultimately falls on the wettened grain side of the fence. Light malt flavor and body makes the beer a bit astringent and begins to show vegital and sulfer notes as the beer warms, creating a harsh environment for light beers. Finishes clean and mostly crisp and with a soft herbal hop and grassy note. Par for the course when considering light beers."
"Just got back from San Juan, PR. The island is littered with ads for Medalla Light. At 95% of places, that's the house beer (Coors Light here and there). So, if you're there for a few days, you're bound to have one. They range from 85 cents in a drugstore, to $1.50 for happy hour, to $4 at some nice restaurants. It's yellow, it's fizzy, and it tastes pretty average. But, it goes down pretty smooth. By the pool on a hot afternoon, or at a bar on a warm evening, if you are in Puerto Rico, you're not drinking a stout. You are drinking the ubiquitous Medalla Light. You just learn to like it there."
"when poured it was an average light yellow lager.. very fine head to none and high carbiantion.. taste was crsip and little freshing.. nothing overpowring in floavr .. just tasted right .. drinkailty is high and you can pound these on the hot beach by the blue ocean.. cheers"
"Drinkability: Extremely drinkable if you like watery, tasteless beer. This one goes down with very little effort, but with little satisfaction. I'm glad I got to try it....once."
"On the the spectrum of light lagers, I'd rank it fairly close to the top."
"Perfect for the heat on the beach on the island, not sure how it would be anywhere else. Very drinkable as long as it is served cold."
"It initially did not look too bad (like it may have had a chance), but that could have been due to the high temperature of the island and the excitement of trying a new beer. Soon after trying it, I decided Rum was the way to go. From what I saw of Puerto Rico, it is not a beer friendly place."
"Drinkability: Hey you're in PR... this is the beer... you can get it fresh... mine was on 7/15 with a best by date of 10/18. It's cold and crisp and great when you need something smooth and not complex. Viva Puerto Rico!"
"I asked for this. She knows wherever she travels, I want a beer from that country, and she delivered. I still love her of course, but I absolutely hate this beer."
"D- Average, goes down well. Very popular on the island and easy to down some prior to moving on to some Don Q cocktails."
"D-As far as light beers go, at least this one had some taste and it wasnt that bad either. It is hot sticky and humid in PR so a 10oz can or bottle of this hits the spot."
"Drinkability- Good, it was pretty versatile. It went well with the local food and when served cold it was very refreshing and did not lose any of it good traits like some beers do."
"Boque 4 life!"
"This beer is a light lager beer that doesn't taste like a light lager,doesn't look a light lager but is a light lager ...this beer is sold everwhere in Puerto Rico(macro) and you can get for a buck...it have a nice smell and a very good taste for a island where it can be at 90 degrees in winter,i have taste it in cans,bottles and on-tap, i prefer it on tap but is hard to find...."
"D: Overall pretty good beer and especially if found on-tap"
"The mouth is well carbonated and a trifle slick. This is an easy enough drinker. It seems well matched to the locale. Its light enough to drink in the heat, but has much more substance than Bud or Miller Lite."
"Drank from the can and on tap, but thought it tasted better out of the can. Had it while on vacation in Rio Grande, PR. Pours a standard macro light lager yellow with a small white head. Taste was similar to a Miller Lite, with corn and rice malt flavors and absolutely no hop presence. For what it is, it tastes pretty good, and it is refreshing in the hot and humid weather. Definitely prefer this to a Coors Light and high above a Bud Light, about the same as a Miller Lite for me. Worth a try if you are in Puerto Rico, but certainly don't go searching for it. Drinkability is good because you can't get enough cold beverages when it is that hot out."
"This is a clean beer, with extremely low bitterness. A little corny, but not in a bad way. (relative here, please).Tastes just like Coors Light IMO."
"In Puerto Rico's climate, you can't do better than a tasty light beer that you can drink all day without getting too plastered."
"While in PR, do what the locals do, drink Medalla Light. The color was the standard light straw yellow with very little foam when poured. The taste was just OK, nothing to write home about. A standard lager light. A possible quincher on hot days to cool yourself off. Can't find anything of interest to write about this beer, just that if your visiting Puerto Rico, try it!"
"This is the standard local beer in Puerto Rico. It comes in 10 oz. cans but this review is for the 12 oz. bottles. Bottle says it's a little over 3 carbos per bottle, which makes it a pretty low-card brew. It must be drunk very cold to avoid off tastes, and is pretty tasty if done so. It is in the US Light Lager category--not a favorite of mine, but acceptable in hot weather. Also pretty cheap, around $1 each in bars outside of the pricy areas of PR."
