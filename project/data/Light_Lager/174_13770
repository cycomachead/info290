So I tried one of these lights to see how it held up. Not well. A light golden color with a ridiculous arrangement of gigantic bubbles where a head should be. The bubbles burst away quickly and you see a steady, light carbonation. The aroma is pretty much missing in action, maybe a touch of mustiness. Although the 83 calories is impressive, the taste value took a big hit as well. I don't sense much of the old Rolling Rock flavor here, just a hint of rice, no corn. Very watery, fizzy. I would look elsewhere for a light beer if I really needed one (which I don't).","Durge","Jul 06, 2007"

Very thin body, virtually no flavor ... just a bit of vegetable and malted grain. Not much here. Maybe not as bad as my original, but pretty bad. Original rating: Poured stark yellow, extremely still with zero head. Starchy aroma. Literally, this tastes like water with a bit of grass in it. Awful.","Braudog","Mar 15, 2007"

2.03,5.2,2.5,2,2,2,2,"There is very little to note about the taste of Rock Green Light, which shouldnt come as a surprise to anyone. The taste features a little bit of graininess, corn meal, and crispness, with a sweet profile that is almost completely devoid of any hop flavor. There is almost no finish at all, and the weak, funky aftertaste of grain with metallic notes lingers for a while after drinking.","Rootdog316","Sep 09, 2005"

Not much aroma at allmaybe a bit of corn and cereal grains, but very faint. No noticeable hop quality in any respect. Its a hollow, watery, unsatisfying beer. This was one very light, very unremarkable experience. Like a lot of light beers, theres nothing particularly bad to say, since theres no notable flavor at all.","Suds","Sep 06, 2005"
2.25,16.6,2.5,2.5,2,2,2.5,"Heavily pushed recently and although I haven't like a single RR I decided to try it anyway. I was somewhat suprised, it was quite tolerable. Light crystaline yellow pour with a hole filled thick head that faded quickly. Smelled like corn on the nose and didn't wreak or smell soured. Barely any taste, perhaps a bit sweet, no notable aftertaste.... somewhat dry. Thin but not too thin. Nothing offensive though.

Now, there is nothing for taste though, but it is missing the artifical tastes I find in other low-carb light beers. It tastes like it looks. A few ounces of beer added to about 9 ounces of water. It really does taste like a slightly alocholic seltzer water. Past that, it is pretty drinkable, meaning you can drink many of these. If you are an avid drinker, you could easily pound a 12-pack without thinking twice. I find this beer to be great for woman drinkers, because well, they stole most of my 6-pack that I had bought, and well I didn't complain.","hackaxle","Aug 14, 2005"

2.04,5.7,2,3,2,1,1.5,"Well, this one is a little better than I thought it would be. It pours the expected golden yellow color with a fastly dissipating white head. The smell is nice considering the style of beer. Smells better than a Budweiser, if thats saying much. The initial taste when the beer first hits your palate is impressive, and reminds me much of a german pilsener. This is of course quickly washed away with a watery, fizzy, extra bland flavor. No body whatsoever. Considering my experiences, this must be impossible to avoid when making a low-carb beer. Atleast this one is better than Michelob ultra, Martens, and Beck's Premier Light. Pretty good for a low carb beer, but not much at all in the world's totem pole of beers.","jasonpeckins32","Jul 13, 2005"

Maybe water. Taste was similar, with a touch of hops. Finished like seltzer water. I don't get this beer. I guess it'd be refreshing for some. Me, I found it one sided and kind of boring.

The beer pours a pale yellow/gold color, but it is actually darker than I would have expected for a low carb beer. Still, it is not anything to write home about. There is no head to speak of, and not much of a ring around the top of the beer. The nose on this beer is awful. I don't know what it is, but it smells like sweet vomit to me. I am not looking forward to drinking this offering. I'm not a fan of the original, so the low carb option can't be any better. Ok...Here we go...The taste is a watered down sweetness. It tastes better than it smells, but that is not saying much. I don't like it. There is more flavor in this one than in Mich. Ultra, but I would rather the flavor of this beer be absent. The beer is thin and the carbonation is burning on my tounge. I don't know if I can even finish this one, so drinkability shouldn't be much of a question. Having tried the Mich Ultra, I would have to say that, even though it is more like water, the Mich Ultra is a beter offering.","kmpitz2","Aug 21, 2004"

An also crystal clear aroma  dish soap, absolutely horrible, a smell that worsens as it gets closer to your senses. Up front, watery thin, spritzy, minimal flavoring. Intensely carbonated; maybe some hop detection, yet that's stretching the boundaries; combined with your typical macro-beer offerings, almost has some perfume-like tastings. The ingredients of this beverage? I do not want to know what they put in this.

Some Listerine aromatics interfere with the skeletal malt, corn syrup in neutrality but very hidden. Smell balances as much as hops, and the finish is like a disappearing act -- completely void.

It's a great looking glass of beer (it even leaves some lace), and it's effortless to consume (just like water...), but it's almost entirely devoid of any flavor. In fact, it seems like watered-down Rolling Rock Light. But there are no flaws in it other than what they intended (they wanted the DMS, light body, and lack of flavor), so it can't score all the way at rock bottom. In fact, for a low-carb beer it's pretty good in comparison. But for the amount of carbohydrates you're saving, it's just not worth it; go for the regular Rolling Rock but have one less potato chip, and you'll still be way ahead of the game!","NeroFiddled","Jan 10, 2004"

Mouthfeel like carbonated water, drinkability: well, it goes down better than many municipal water supplies, but isn't all that enjoyable. But a great summer thirst quencher. I'd almost call it a near-beer, but it does have some alcohol, although it doesn't show in the taste. Not offensive, but why bother?
