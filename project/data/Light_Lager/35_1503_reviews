"um I guess best light beer"
"My ""go-to"" light beer (actually the only light beer I like)"
""
""
"By far the best light beer I've ever had. I knew I could count on Sam Adams to succeed in making a light beer that has all the full flavor of a normal brew."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"not bad for a light beer but it is definitely not my go to beer. if i were to diet this would be a good choice."
"Great ""light"" beer.  One of the better from the line."
""
""
""
"This beer is pretty good."
""
""
"O:  Really nice light beer.  Will go with this over any other light beer that I have tried."
"I wish all ""light"" beers tasted this good... If forced to go light, this is the choice..."
""
"I don't like Sam, but this is a light beer that is close enough to the non-light version, that it deserves credit in that respect."
""
"A good tasting light beer.  Not tons of flavor but very smooth."
"Drinkable if nothing else is around."
""
""
""
"Comparing this against light beers like coors light and Bud light, other Light beers. This stuff is way better. Decent flavor at a decent price. refreshing on a hot day"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This would be my go to lite beer."
""
""
""
""
"Very good and easy to drink. I've come to expect nothing less from Samuel Adams."

"Overall (3.73) : This beer can be enjoyable no matter where you're at. It has enough flavor to compete with full flavored lagers, but trims the fat in all the right places. So many light beers taste like corn or nothing. This one has malt character and faint hop. I'm not going all the way to say it's the best beer in the world, but it just may be the best tasting light lager I've tried yet."
""
""
"Hands down new favorite lite beer"

"The best light beer on the market."
""

""
""
""
""

""

"O: Definitely tastier than the majority of mass produced light lagers available in the US - especially those from the larger brewers. Nothing special but easy to drink, would probably be a good beer for on the boat or at the beach."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Surprisingly true to the original taste for a Light beer. Crisp, distinctive flavor, a step above all other mass produced commercial light American lagers."

"When I first drank this beer (2003) back when I first discovered craft beer, I thought it to be an excellent light beer, but also a good beer all on its own without the ""light"" label. I was looking for a low alcohol session beer and thought to give SA Light a try again. This time around I was disappointed. It looks great with its amber color and thick head. To me it leaves a hard water dry aftertaste. That is all I seem to get from its flavor profile. For what I got and for what I paid ($9.19 a six-pack) I won't be purchasing this beer again. This is the first SA beer that I can say I did not care for."

"Has good malty flavor. Very malt forward a little watery but for a light beer it has a ton of flavor. It tastes a lot like a Boston lager just a little weaker. I would recommend a beer like this to anyone coming for a BMc background. It is very good overall but for a light beer it is world class."

"Overall, a great choice if you're looking for a light alternative."
"Pours a light amber in color with almost a 1-finger head with a white head at first which settles down to a thin head. Much darker in color than other ""Light"" beers. Some spotty lacing was seen which each sip. The aroma is of pale malts but that's about it. The taste was the same but didn't have a bitter or unpleasant aftertaste. Carbonation was slightly above average as is most light beers but not bad at all."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

" Its not bad at all. I cant say that I like its aftertaste very much at all, but overall, the beer really is ok...especially for anyone who wants to indulge the fantasy of a “diet beer”."
""
""
""
""
""

"O: This beer is pretty good compared to the other light lagers that I tried as it seems a little maltier and less watery."

"This beer is a real heart breaker. I thought it would be more flavorful but it really isnt much better than any other light beer. It looked like a decent beer when poured. Not much on the nose and the taste was pure watered down light beer. I didnt buy it again simply because the beer store has other light beers that are cheaper and basically taste the same. Nice try though SA but to sell it the price needs to be closer to that of an AALL"

"This is a good beer, a very good light beer. Still it leaves something to be desired on the malt end of the flavor spectrum (Hey the calories had to come from somewhere). The hops are very noticeable but not overpowering. I would recommend that if you're interested you try this beer because I think you'll like it."

"While I would normally stay away from lighter versions of original lagers, this manages to be a bit thinner without being a light beer in the same context as Bud Light, Miller Lite, etc. It's really not all that light, and while the ABV is quite low, it does not lose sight of the hop flavor one bit and still manages to be a nicely balanced beer just like the original. If you're looking for a session beer, or just don't want a beer that's so heavy, you really can't go wrong with this one."
"The taste is remarkably full for a light lager with a decent sweetness and slightly dry finish. As far as lights go this is quite nice."
""
""
"Overall: I have to confess that I abhor light beers in general, because they have almost no beer flavor (or flavor at all, I’m looking at you MBC!!!). I personally believe that light beers are beers for people who care more about their appearance than they do their beer and/or don’t like the flavor of beer and therefore drink the light beers because they have practically no flavor. That being said, Samuel Adams’ Light beer was pretty good. It had some beer flavor, not as much as I think that it should, but some, and it sure as hell didn’t look like a glass of urine like all of the other major light beers do."

"I give this a 3 overall because it's a light beer that's actually passable. While it's far from my favorite beer, I'm surprised that I like it at all being a light beer so that gets a few extra points."
"Overall, more flavor than most light beer. At least there's some malt character. But the grainy flavor and notes of adjuncts are offputting."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall – A tastier version of a light beer with more hop and malt characteristic for the “light” lager style. While nothing to pine over it is rather refreshing."

"Overall for a light beer it's not bad at all. I was turned on to it by a friend who told me that SA uses it to train their beer tasters and it is used in to train beer judges for competitions. It is a very neutral tasting beer and additions can be made to it to help judges or tasters identify off tastes or maltiness or hoppiness. Plus for me it was a gateway beer to widen my wife's taste for beer. She is an AB Budweiser girl all the way and she really likes this beer. She started drinking Grolsch this week. The recovery is going slow but soon she will drink real beer! So for those of you looking to introduce a hardened BMC drinker into the wonderful world of craft beer this is a good beer to start with. And hey it's definitely a drinkable session beer that's relatively low in calories and cheap and if you are down to your last beer you can grab one from your girl and not have to choke down a bud lite or (shudders) Natty Light from a can."

"Overall, not what I expected at all. This isn't as good as I remember from trying it on draft which I thought was a decent version, just lighter than regular Sam. This is more macro lager and bleh like. Not as light as most macros, and much more flavor, but some unhappy flavors."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Amber color with a white head, with decent retention and lacing. Smells and tastes like toasted and biscuit malt, with light hop bitterness. Light bodied with average carbonation. Not bad for a Light Lager."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Half finger head on a clear golden amber body with minimal lacing. Sweet corn, caramel, toasted malts. Flavors are clean and crisp with caramel malts but there is a earthy and toasted flavor that tastes more like a bad macro brewed beer. Light to medium body and moderate to high carbonation. Actually this is a pretty bad light beer. I would rather have a coors light than this one. The flavor is sour and not very palatable. Wouldn't have this again."
""
""
"The beer pours a very clear and clean amber with a slight rose tint. The body is superbly clean and translucent, as it should be for the style, with lots of nice carbonation bubbles, and a light scrim head of eggshell white bubbles that sit at the top of the beer. Lacing is slick and thin, running right back to the beer and not waiting around for awhile on the glass. On the nose, the beer smells of sweet caramel malts with a light grassy touch stepping through from the Noble hops. Cereal grain scents can be detected in the sweet caramel, but the smell is very clean and light, as a light lager should be. It’s actually quite nice to smell in comparison with other light beers. On the tongue, the beer tastes sweet clean and light. The beer begins with the sweet caramel malts from the smell and a water-neutral taste that sits separate from the malt, but slowly the taste opens into to grainy cereal and biscuit notes with light grassy side notes. The finish has this weird minty medicinal flavor in it that seems to have been there throughout the sip, but is more prevalent in the aftertaste, although there are also light grain notes. On the mouth this beer is properly thin and watery, with a nice little trundle of carbonation greeting the tongue. The mouth is left supremely clean with only a slight hint of saliva to ask for more beer. The beer is actually quite quenching of thirst. Overall this is a good beer for what it is; in fact it may be the best beer in its style. It is highly drinkable and has some noticeable and interesting flavors with minimal complexity. I could drink a lot of these easily. My only complaint is the weird minty-medicinal taste that seems to be hiding behind everything else. Overall, this beer is a success for what the Boston Beer Company was trying to do with it. If you want a light lager, drink this."
""
""
""
"Pours an orangy gold color that is clear. White head disappears completely almost immediately. Has a bit of moldy somewhat buttery sweet smell. Beer does not look very lively. Taste is balanced, but bland. Dry body with light carbonation. Bit of a buttery aftertaste. Is drinkable and smooth but certainly not impressive. May have to try again, almost suspicious that I got a subpar batch. Bottle says it's fresh but I've come to expect more from Sam Adams even for a light beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"That said, Sam Adams light is far and away the best light beer on the mass market. It's got a watery mouthfeel, but it has more flavor than nearly every american adjunct full-bodied beer. My father in law drinks Budweiser, and I had him try a sip of Sam Adams Light. He said it was too strong for him. That's how flavorful this beer is. It's probably the best light beer you can buy, but it's essentially just good beer with extra water added. it's sold at the same price as the good stuff."

""
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall this is a very drinkable light beer; it has more taste than most light beers; 4.0 ABV; I'd have it again when after a light beer. One down side is its price compared to other lights."

"If I saw this sitting around -- like I did today -- I'd drink it. I really enjoy it, especially considering I don't normally like light beers. But for the price, I wouldn't be able to justify paying upwards of $10 for a 6-pack of this beer. Still, pretty good."

"For a light beer, this is definitely one of the better ones but honestly, it isn't very ""light"" as far as calories are concerned. This beer kind of falls into a hole for me because I could pick up Yuengling Light that has decent flavor and less calories if I really wanted to drink light beer. If I wanted Sam Adams I would just as soon have a Boston Lager."

"The beer pours into the shaker pint a dark amber color, trending toward yellowish. A healthy cap of foam sits above. The aroma is of starchy grain and grassy hops. The noble hops are showcased well here. The beer nimbly dances across the palate through its carbonation and light body. The malt flavor nicely emerges as the temperature increases. Not a very assertive beer, but a well made light beer."
""
""
""
"Overall, I cannot see buying Sam Adams Light when Yuengling costs half as much."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours amber with a cap of white foam. Brilliant clarity. Smells of sweet malts and hints of tea - very, very similar to standard Boston Lager. Flavors of grain and light malts with a bit of corny character - but pleasant. Thin with hi carb and lightly dry finish. Nice beer and well worth a try for those watching their calories."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

""

"Biscuit malt comes through in the aroma more than it did for Boston Lager. The beer smells grainy and the hop aroma is not strong. The beer tastes mildly sweet and watery. It's a little fuller than most light lagers, but still watery. The hop bitterness is minimal. The body is light to full with moderate carbonation. The beer is smooth and the finish is dry. The drinkiability is high because it is easy to drink. Overall, this is a good beer for the style, but as a beer it is merely above average. Thus, the price for this beer is not justified. If you are looking to buy light lagers, you could easily spring for cheaper offerings because the quality of this beer does not justify the price tag."

"Now this is unusual for me, the first 'light' beer I have ever really truly liked! Pours out a standard transparent amber in color with a sticky two fingered head with a mild level of lacing left behind. Smells of toasted malts and raw cereal grains, tastes of light toasted malts as well combined with actual grainy flavor in a light beer makes me one happy camper! Texture is light but flows well in the mouth without being too watery, finishes crisply. Much better than other light beers I have tried."
""
""
""
""
""

""
"Eh for what it tries to be it works. It's a cut about normal light beers, but I'd still reach for a Berliner Weiss or APA when I wanted something lower in alcohol."

"I suppose this ought to be rated fairly well for standing out in this dismal category. Quite drinkable, but I would never go out of my way to drink another one unless it was in a back yard ice chest with a load of Corona."

"Overall, and keeping in mind that this is a light beer, it's surprisingly good. It certainly wouldn't keep up with, say, a Dogfish Head, but it wasn't intended to. Sam Adams set out to provide the world with a flavorful light beer, and they did succeed; it's certainly in the top five of the light beers I've tried, and is leagues beyond any Anheuser-Busch light beer. This is not to say that the beer is without its flaws, for it does move too far in the direction of bread and grain flavors, and could use a bit more fruit and sugar (which, yes, would probably add calories) to help soften the flavor profile. But for a light beer, it's delicious: exactly the sort of fare I'd want with lunch after working outside on a hot day."

"O-a good light beer, but overall not one I would normally drink"
""
"I've always heard good things about Sam Adams Light. A lot of people say that its one of the best options in the realm of ""Light Lagers"". I completely disagree. From what other Sam Adams beers that I have had, their Octoberfest and Latitude 48, I have been pretty impressed. But I found Sam Adams Light quite disheartening. While their was a discernibly more malty taste to it as compared to other light lagers, it was not a pleasant maltiness. The taste comes off as a glass of tonic water with a little bit of ""quality beer"" poured in to top it off. While you can taste that Sam Adams used good ingredients in this offering, it just doesn't transfer to a good experience. When it comes to light lagers I would much rather have a generic BMC."

"Overall: Its tough to rate this beer. It isn't that great, but for the STYLE its downright superb! I have to give it a middling rating, but it was actually better than I expected and has to be one of the best light beers I've had yet."

"O: does the trick for what its worth - it fits the style, and at a decent price"
"No other need to drink another light lager after this. That is if you actually like the taste of beer. With better carbonation and a little drier taste, this would be a good beer."
"Overall, I wondered why my dad raved about this growing up, and I can see why. He mainly drank Natural Light at the time, and this is a big upgrade and a solid beer overall."
"Really not bad for a light beer but still nothing I would regularly buy."
"For a light beer, this one is pretty dark. I'm not a dark beer drinker but love Sam Adams beers so had to give this one a try. If I'm looking for a light beer but don't want to sacrifice too much taste I will go for this one. Smooth feel, great taste, has typical Sam Adas flavor."
"Overall: It came in a sampler pack...2 bottles of 6 varieties. Glad I got this one out of the way, it just leaves me longing for the OG Samuel Adams Lager (or better yet, Samuel Adams Ale)."
"I'd have it again."
"O- Pretty good for a light beer, although give me a Boston Lager over this any day of the week"
"Pours light amber with a decent white head. Smells too grainy. Grassy, malty, faint caramel, pleasant taste. Clean, slightly drying finish. Surprisingly hefty, creamy mouthfeel for a light beer, and in the end, a perfectly respectable light beer. If you're gonna go light, I guess you should go for a Sam Adams."
"This beer delivers what it claims to. Not a singing endorsement and for a company that says ""this is no light beer"" and who admits that calories aren't light, well I'm not going to rush out to buy more."
"This is a nice looking light beer. The aroma is light but pleasant, like honeydew melons and apples. Taste follows, but doesn't have a lot to add. Mouthfeel drops off from the Boston Lager. I remember this as being the most flavorful light beer I had ever tasted, but it has been a long time since light beer has passed these lips. I find myself taking huge gulps of it just to taste anything at all. I give it extra points for being a light beer, which probably means I'm giving it a better review than the full flavored Sam Adams. But as it has the same calories as a Guinness Draft, I'll stick with the Guinness."
"Samuel Adams Light Lager isnt bad....not preferred...but not bad. The color is a nice amber with thin white head that isnt leaving alot of lace. The smell is caramel malt with sublte spice and grain undertones. The taste is primarily malt with some hop at the end that helps the beer clear the pallet instead of lingering. The mouthfeel is fine, nice and smooth....very drinkable. Definitely can session this one without issue."
"D: Pretty darn good for a “light” beer – far better than most. Good look, fair nose, a bit much sweetness, and rather too much carbonation. Significantly better than the average – “regular” non-light – macro swill. About the same calories though with less abv. Rated to “light” style, this is nice."
"You know if Sam Adams is going to do a light beer, it was going to be good and this didn’t disappoint. I would call it a WNBA’s Sam Adams Boston Lager."
"Dr: You could easily down it if only you could get past the wretched ""flavours"". A huge disappointment from Sam Adams."
"Pours a clear honey orange color with a 1 inch fizzy off-white head that fades to an oily film. Small legs of lace drip back into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is of toasted grains, malt, and some honey notes. Taste is of toasted grains, bready malt, slight honey, and some mild citrus zest. Very little bitterness on the palate after each sip. A good level of carbonation makes for a crisp and fizzy mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good light beer - probably the best light beer I have ever had really."
"Overall: Impressive for a light beer. Refreshing, very summer appropriate, and a good way to try and get the standard light beer drinker into craft. I wouldn't turn one down, though I wouldn't seek it out either. Only got this due to it being included in the Summer Sampler 12 pack."
"Overall: A pretty good take on a light lager that is fuller than some regular lagers."
"Taste = no thanks. Too sweet, tastes cheap, odd, off, etc. Is it light beer you seek? Try a great German or Czech pils, or perhaps an English session beer. Although I respect Sam Adams, this beer is a macro lager engineered for the masses. I won't be having this again."
"Overall, it's a great light lager. It's better flavor-wise than any other on the market."
"That said, this is quite good for the style. I would be hard pressed to show a more drinkable light beer for a lover of more robust beers. It looks a bit maltier in color than most wimpy beers, and it has a more complex taste than most. I bought a summer sampler with a $5 meat rebate, so they were cheap, and my guests didn't drink much. More for me, and I am not unhappy that I have to drink the three Lights - they are good."
"D/O- An above average (read: better tasting) ""light"" beer but i believe there to be better examples of the style, although not many. Very sessionable...lower ABV than most of the ""big boys"". Who knows...could be a gateway beer for some. Graded to style."
"O: Definitely better than average for the style, doesn't have the adjunct character of most of the others. Refreshing and pleasant, definitely worth a try."
"Poured into a pint glass this brew has a lighter straw color with a good 1 finger white head. The brew settles and looks very thin with moderate carbonation. The aroma is yeasty with malts most notable. The taste is full of bready malt and some slight sweetness from caramel malts. This is a thin beer with high carbonation for the viscosity. All in all for a 'light' beer it stands up."
"o - Overall a pretty good light beers. Not as good as some of their other offerings but better than most light beers. Would give it another shot, though I wouldn't seek it out."
"Definitely opens alot with warmth, it's still a mostly bland light beer when it comes down to it, but easily better than the majority of light lagers."
"O: Head of the class for the light lager category, no doubt. I think I'd still prefer the better adjunct lagers (Schlitz, PBR) than this light, however. The flavor profile simply makes you wish you'd had a regular Sam Adams brew. There are times for a lighter beer, and PBR will still be my go-to for those occasions."
"Pours a clear deep golden color with a stingy white head that dissolves almost instantly leaving a small ring on top. Smells of bready malt, honey, and toffee with hints of floral and earthy hops. Taste is slightly sweet with that grainy malt flavor. A Little bit of floral earthy hop flavors. Light bodies with a moderate level of carbonation and a sweet watery mouthfeel. This is definitely not my favorite style, but if I had to drink it this would be the one I would choose. There's enough flavor and maltiness in here to make this an interesting lawnmower beer and its certainly better than the competitors in the style."
"O: Would definitely buy this one again."
"Pours out a clear red amber that with a thick white head that maintains very good lacing and retention. The nose has some sweet malts to it, but very little hops. The taste starts out with a sweet caramel taste followed by some grains and a very weak watered down floral and citrus hops to finish off the taste. A lot of the taste reminds me of Boston Lager, but the flavor is so watered down that it ruins the taste of it. The mouthfeel is light and very watery which makes it easy to drink, but overall this is probably the best light beer I ever tasted. I would recommend this to anyone that likes a light beer, even though I personally don't care much for this style."
"D- as far as this style goes (adjunct lagers included here), it's the only one i've ever had with any quality of flavor so that's awesome."
"Well, I am probably never going to be a fan of light body and light taste, but this one seemed to be done pretty well all things saying. I will admit that the beer feels ""slightly"" bigger than the 4 abv rating gives it so there you have it."
"Generally what I'm looking for in a macro/light lager is a beer that does not taste bad and I can drink a lot of it. This certainly does not taste bad. However, it does have a bit more heft than some others. I guess that makes this my go-to beer when I want something dumbed-down but I'm only having two or three. The problem is that I'm just not in that situation very often."
"Overall, it's not bad except for that unfortunate aftertaste. I'd be willing to drink this again. If I taste it again and get a different aftertaste, I will re-review."
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. This light lager poured a clear amber color and produced a nice white head. The head retention is average and the lacing was a bit below average. The aroma had soft hints of grain and a slight amount of hops. The taste of the beer was light in body, it had a sweet malt flavor and a ever so slight hint of caramel and citrus. In context of other so called ""light beers"" on the market, this has to be the best that I have had to date. This beer has flavor, character and aroma. Like Papa Johns says Better ingredients, better beer!"
"O: Not bad for a light beer, but it isn't too interesting. A better choice than most light lagers, but I prefer the regular Sam Adams a lot more."
"Not interesting."
"It's a light beer, but it's Sam Adams, so it's still somewhat okay. Poured a clear, golden brown with a finger or two of white head that receded rather quickly to a thin layer of bubbles. Pale malts in the aroma with trace scents of caramel and toasty bread. More of the same in the taste: pale malts, lightly toasted, very subdued hoppiness, though it's still present, light caramel. A bit watered down--this is a light beer--light bodied, yet still decently flavorful for the style. Drinkable, I suppose, if you're on a diet."
"O: A pleasant enough beer for what it is but it is still just a light beer--albeit a light beer with some flavor"
"I would suggest to you that you would have a much greater beer experience if you drank the Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier which is a World Class hefe for 210 calories in 12 oz. If you can't afford the extra 90 calories you probably shouldn't be drinking beer in the first place."
"O: If this weren't a light beer it would be average. However keeping in mind that this is a ""light"" beer and not a ""full flavored"" beer. This is very, very good, finally there is a light beer that tastes like beer and not just some piss yellow watery crap that is passed of as ""premium"" beer. Thank you Jim Koch and the Boston Beer Company for making a light beer that is beer."
"This is certainly not flavorful enough to be a good beer, and not light enough to be a good light lager."
"Taste also begins sweet, prickly hops in the middle on through the close, again making me think saaz. Mouthfeel is smooth, although body is light in the middle, with easy drinkability. What do you want, it's a light beer, and as far as they go, not bad."
"If you're gonna drink light beer, this is an excellent choice, tastes light, but it also tastes like something."
"O: I'm not sure if i've had a better light beer, for the style you can't go wrong here."
"One of the best light beers I've ever tasted."
"12 oz. bottle poured into a tumbler. best before september. Pours a pretty light bronze color with two fingers of foam and lots of carbonation. Malt and yeast on the nose with some hop bitterness. Smells pretty close to bud light. Taste is reminiscent as well but with more roasted malt flavor. Not a lot but enough to make it much more enjoyable than bud light. Mouthfeel is surprisingly flat. Finish is brief and clean. Roasted malt lingers for just a second with some sweetness and then vanishes. Nothing fancy. I don't know if this is what they were going for but they built a nice session beer if you're used to sessioning a 12 pack of bud light or something similar."
"This beer looks and smells nice. Flavor is very lacking but no bad tastes of note. An easy drinker, dry aftertast but horribly boring. If I want something this lacking in flavor a nd easy to drink, I'd save $1-2 a 6-pack and buy a BMC of preference."
"Clear, light amber with a quickly dissipating cap of beige foam. Hence, not much in the way of lacing was present, though a few stray bubbles did top the beer for a while. Sweet caramel, marshmallow aroma with some fruity and spicy notes. Medium to low bitterness, nicely balanced by more caramel, same hop profile as the aroma. The malt did disappear towards the end of each sip, leaving some lingering spicy hops and metallic character behind. Medium to light bodied, average carbonation, slight dryness, decent texture overall. A pretty good beer and quite a good light lager. It has way more flavour than similar offerings from the big brewers."
"Overall this is the best light beer I've had. If you want to drink a light beer, this is the one to drink."
"This is a refreshing light beer. Although i still holds true to the watered-down taste, it has more flavor then the major light beer brands. It has a typical beer smell with nothing worth noting. All in all it is an average beer compared to full bodied beers, but good compared other light beers."
"This was a bit of a surprise, I expected a very bland beer, and what I got was a halfway decent beer. This is easily the best light beer I have tried. While not going to change styles over this, if you want a light beer that actually has flavor, give this one a try."
"O: This tastes okay and is beyond quaffable."
"This beer is a great alternative to the light adjuncts out there. I wouldn't buy this regularly but in a spot this works for me."
"PRETTY GOOD, IN A PINCH!"
"O- A solid light lager that does not really drink like a light lager. Has some nice flavor for a light lager, but has a little sourness and skunkiness to it."
"Overall: Not something I would drink on a regular basis, but this was indeed a bold move by Boston Beer Company, and this is actually a good beer. Want to take some craft beer to a cookout and not get hassled by your BMC drinking friends? Get this. They might even enjoy it. This is a good summer beer if nothing else."
"It's hard to get excited about a Light Lager, but this is a pretty good version of the style comparatively."
"Pouts a transparent amber color with a light one finger white head. The head has decent retention and leaves a little alcing in my glass. The aroma is of bready malt and light malts. Taste is grainy and bready with a light herbal hops. Mouthfeel is thin with light fluffy carbonation. Overall, this isn't a very impressive beer, but when you consider the competition it looks a lot better. It certainly blows the socks off bud light."
"D - This is the most beer like ""light"" beer that I have ever encountered. There is genuine malt character here and enough hops to balance it out. It isn't complex enough to warrant deep examination, but it is quite drinkable. It does make you wonder just how light this beer actually is."
"O-i admit, i hate hate hate BMC light beers to the max. its not the lack of taste to me, but they honestly make me sick. i can get sicker quicker off of BMC light beers than craft beers even though their ABV is lower. this light lager lacks that gross quality other light lagers seem to have. it still is not a beer i will be enjoying on any occasion, even if i'm drinking for volume."
"Not a bad take on the style. This does make me miss the old lightship ale which was way more flavorful"
"O (D) - well, for a light lager, this is exceptional. Reviewing to style, this is a great beer. I don't like it very much, but it's simply much better than other similar beers that I've had."
"Drinkability was great especially on a hot day. Easy to tell this is a lighter version of the Boston Lager. Great beer for summer grilling. Light, crisp, but still get a good taste of the malts that is synonamous with the Boston Lager."
"O-a step in the wrong direction from boston lager,,to watered down with not alot of flavor..always like boston lager.. its a light beer thats just not for me"
"Found a couple of bottles of this one in one of the Samuel Adams mixed 12 packs. Admittedly, especially for a light beer, this one ain't bad. Poured a light golden color with a nice white head. Not a whole lot going on here, other than an easy drinkability, but there is some light hoppiness and a nice malt undertone."
"Overall: pretty good, especially for a light lager, but it has its missteps. Still, working within the limitations of the style, Sam Adams has done a pretty good job here."
"Final Notes: For a light beer, this is where it's at. It's a little more caloric than the other options when it comes to light beer, but it's a lot more flavorful. However, it is still a light beer, and as such, don't set the bar too high for it. Decent, though."
"OA: Not bad, but not fantastic either. There's nothing that stands out about Sam Adams Light, but nothing puts it off either."
"12oz bottle with a Best Before Date notched at Aug. Pours a translucent light amber color with a thin layer of head. Aroma is biscuits and floral. Some grape aroma and a bit tart. Some caramel flavor along with a biscuity taste. Definitely tastes watered down. Slight tart aftertaste of the grapes. To quote every athlete ever ""It is what it is."" And what this Is is a decent beer. Nothing I would go out of my way to buy but it is probably the best Light beer I have ever had. I feel it is a bit of a ripoff to put it in the Summer Mix Pack but it does fit in well. Overall, it's not bad but I hope I don't ever have to drink it by default."
"O - As far as light lagers go, this is at the head of its class. I can't think of another in its class that matches its flavor. If your going to worry about calories, it might as well taste good."
"D/O: Definitely a better alternative to BMC, but I honestly wouldn't notice much of a difference at all if I was drunk and throwing them back"
"I would recommend this beer for when you are cooking on the grill, and while eating dinner (like a steak)."
"Overall: this is a lite beer? Guaranteed that if you held a taste-testing contest no one would get that it was a lite beer. Sam Adams sure has more better choices (well, mostly) than this one, but you can't go wrong with this beer."
"Hoping it would be along the lines of a Boston Lager or something but to my surprise there was basically no hops! I have had it since and still no hops! To me it's like they made the stuff out of all malts and not much else. So with that I feel the balance is is little off. I would still choose this over most light beers though."
"O: Definitely not what most of us think of when it comes to a light lager, but this is still a good choice."
"Looks like a full flavor beer but with a head that pretty much goes away as you get through the beer. You can smell the spicy perfume like Noble hops with a sweet malt small. You can definitely tell its a light beer from the first sip but by no means a Coors, Budweiser or Miller. The slight spicy hop is the very first thing that you taste then with a bready sweet malt ending with a flash of citrus from the hops. You can also taste the yeast mixing quite nicely with the malt and fruitiness from the hops. Extremely well crafted you can tell they put a lot of time into making this a flavorful light beer and making sure all the flavors meld together amazingly. I always notice the yeast taste more in light beers. Whats funny is that this is more flavorful then not the light version of the Big 3 but the full flavored versions of Bud Miller and Coors.... and this is a light beer! Their light beers compared to this are pure water. This is kind of watered down in the body which makes it extremely easy to drink but the flavors hit you and are impossible not to notice. Definitely not a favorite style of mine but wow this is delicious for a light beer."
"Drinkability - If I had to have a light beer I suppose I'd choose this. Glad they have somewhat stopped including this in the variety packs and including a new beer instead."
"The light beer I would have no problem drinking any time. Quite tasty."
"Pretty easy-drinking, nothing really offensive but not strong, either. I guess there are worse alternatives, but I can't say I'd go for this one. And honestly, if faced with this vs. other light beers at a bar, I'd probably just save a little money & go for the cheaper ones."
"Drinkability is awesome. Great taste and the refreshing style of a light beer. Definitely the best I have had and you can read more about my opinion above."
"Light body with lots of carbonation in the mouth. Some bitterness stays with you. I guess compared to other light lagers, this has a little more flavor to it. More drinkable than the other options they had."
"Drinkability is for the style amazing."
"Drinkability is quite high. The mildness, pleasant flavor, and manageable ABVs make this a great party choice."
"Overall, this is the best light lager out there but that's really not saying much. Probably the easiest step for someone to take who's looking to go from BMC to craft. For those of us who have already gone off the deep end, this is a reminder of simpler days."
"Pours a light amber color. Has a nice head to it. Has a hoppy beer scent to it just like Sam Adams lager does. It has a darker taste which is odd for a light beer almost that of Yeungling. It is the best tasting light beer I've ever had. It goes down smooth as well. The color scent taste ratio blows other light beers out of the water. I recommend this beer to everyone."
"Usually drank out of the 12oz bottle. Poured a clear amber color with a two finger white head. The aroma was malty and floral. The flavor was a malt base with a citrus finish. Light body and mild carbonation. This is actually one of the better light beers I've had. Better than Sam Adams Lager IMO."
"The mouthfeel and drinkability are both quite good, this beer goes down easily. But, as a light beer, that's kind of what it's supposed to do! Just a nice, inoffensive, easy drinking beer that can really hit the spot. Nothing stellar, but it's a nice brew that lives above the ""light"" label."
"overall a very solid offering and a light beer that can be counted on to do what it does."
"D- Very drinkable. Smooth and refreshing with good flavors."
"Verdict: Light beers never venturing far into my drinker's repertoire, I have to say that this is one of the best light lagers one can get for their money. It does a good job at being light without sacrificing quality or content. It's not too watery and has plenty of flavor, much more than, say Bud Light. In the end, I wouldn't go for more knowing that a Sam Adams Boston Lager costs about the same and is far more fulfilling, but if you feel like a light beer for whatever reason, there is no shame in picking one of these up. B- (3.45)"
"D- I liked this to an extent, and I like that it's a four percenter, my favorite kind."
"D: Goes down very easily, somewhat tasty, not filling, minor kick, and a good representation of the style. I've not had a light lager before and although I wouldn't seek this out, this is a great alternative to the macro selection generally available out at the bars."
"Better than other light lagers such as Bud Light, but still not too much going on here. One of the weakest offerings from Boston Beer Company."
"Seems like a decent session beer if you wanted something a notch above BMC. Otherwise, I think Sam Adams has plenty better options."
"For Sam I'm not impressed. Light beer shouldn't even be a category."
"D: I'm no expert on the style since most light lagers I see are of the BMC variety, but this one is actually drinkable and is something I wouldn't mind having again (in the right situation)."
"I usually despise all light beers, but on a whim at the local casino, the drink lady brought me one of these by mistake. I stared at it for a while before I finally decided I'd actually try it. I am a huge Sam Adams fan and this is one of the few Sam beers I have not tried. It was slightly better than an average light beer, with a weak aroma, non-existent taste, and no trace of head, with way too much carbonation. While it could be worse, it could have been better."
"If you like Coors Light and you're tired of getting made fun of for drinking it, give yourself a better name and you really don't have to sacrifice the taste all that much from Coors Light. At least you're drinking a Sam's, right?"
"D - Overall, this is enjoyable for a light beer, but it does not stand up at all against other Samuel Adams beers. Still, if I have to have light beer arond, I'd prefer this one."
"I was at the airport and it was the choice between this and Hieneken in a bottle. I wasn't thrilled about either but since I hadn't tried this I thought I would. It was pretty much exactly as advertised: a light version of sam adams. It did have the malty character but in a very watery way. The color was certainly darker than a typical bud or becks but not as dark as a regular sam. aroma was light but present. Flavor, as mentioned had a decent malt presence but a little watery. I had two of them in the early afternoon and was able to easily navigate through the rest of my day."
"Amber brew with a nose of honey, caramel and grassy hops. Light crisp body. I can not say the brew does not have flavors, but they are barely noticeable (some earthy hops and honey.). Slightly dry short finish. Better than most light beers but still it is just barely drinkable."
"There arent to many beers that I would give a perfect score to but this is one of them. I wish this was a standard for an American Lager. I really enjoy the malt aroma from this beer. The color is gorgeous, a hint of yellow with light amber hue to it. There is a very nice malt and hop balance here. Light enough to make it drinkable and yet flavorful enough to keep you wanting more! Great beer!"
"Pours a nice copper color with a good white head, that left decent lacing on the glass as it fell. this beer smells like a light beer, but one that has been kicked up a notch. It doesn't smell too light, and it also has some hop presence and some caramel notes. The taste is good, I mean you cant expect a lot of complex flavors from a light beer, but this was definitely surprising. It had a good sweetness to it, and also you could actually taste some hops. The mouthfeel was good because It had a light body with medium carbonation, but it was not watery like almost all other light beers. I would say that the drinkability was excellent. I really could drink these all night long. This is the best light beer I have tried, and it showed me that there really is a good light beer out there. I think Sam Adams really achieved what they were going for with this beer, which was making a light beer that didn't completely suck. I was scared to try this at first, but I really think its a quality beer. Good job. Cheers."
"D - high caliber light beer, lacking much of the flavor that I need to keep coming back to it; I think my description sums it up best ""Sam Adams's attempt to break into the light beer market should be recognized as a success, but as with most light beers, the emphasis is on volume. Sacrificing the much needed taste and quality."""
"Sam Adams Light pours a copper color, with a decent head that stayed around. There is a very mellow smell. The taste is also mellow, light, as the name implies. Not too much to say about this one. Overall this is a nice beer, very mellow but deffently the best light beer I ever had."
"For a light beer, I have to admit this is one of the best offerings available. I actually has taste that makes you believe it can't be a light. After trying watered down piss offered by just about everyone... Triple Hops this... silver that... low carb blah blah blah... it is nice to finally find a light beer you could enjoy while knowing you were at least attempting to keep your diet in line."
"Pours a light copper with a nice white head and a bit of lacing on the way down. Visible carbonation bubbles rising throughout. Smells fairly light, but brings a decent amount of light grain with hints of caramel. Some like Noble hops as well. The taste is slightly sweet and grainy and brings a fairly crisp hop bite. Light body with good carbonation. Certainly one of the better light lagers out there, if not the best."
"Sammy Adams never seems to let me down, and this light offering of theirs is no exception. You can't expect a bold mixture of flavors from a light beer, but you also can't expect the exceptional drinkability you'll discover in the first sip of this delightful brew. This is most definitely my go-to beer for nights dedicated to quantity of alcohol over quality, and the quality of a decent beer is still more than present in this heavily drinkable offering from Samuel. Try this if boldly flavored beers scare you away, if you naturally enjoy light beers, or if you are new to drinking beer."
"Okay in the drinkability category."
"D- very drinkable."
"Appearance has a mid amber tone with a crisp thick head that dissipates quickly leaving nil lace. Smell is grainy with light citrus and hop. Taste has full flavor for a light lager, having the same flavor as the Boston lager, but just lighter. Mouthfeel is light with good body. Nothing bad about this light, I'd buy again."
"This light beer from Sam Adams definetly has a lighter taste than the Boston Lager or Boston Ale, but it is still very well made. At 4% alcohol it still is a tasty beer and delivers the lighter contents without sacrificing taste. If you are a Bud Light/ Miller Lite drinker, give this a try!"
"Awesome session beer, in my opinion. It's a light beer, but it isn't watery and has good flavor, and that's about all you can ask for."
"Light, clear coppery golden with a slight fizzy head that quickly burns off. Light husky grain and faint noble hop notes in the nose. The fact that is doesn't have off flavors puts it a cut above other ""lite/light"" diet brews. The flavor is purely watered down Boston lager. Thin bodied with seltzery carbonation. This is probably the best diet beer I will ever have, whatever that is good for."
"This was good for a light beer, a lot better than your typical macros."
"I can't praise this beer enough, or stress it's drinkability, especially for beginning drinkers. It's also a great beer to have if you're the driver for the night because of the somewhat modest ABV; all the characteristics of a great non-light beer but you can enjoy one of two more because it won't impair you as fast as most other ""real"" beers will. Happy Drinking!"
"D: Easy drinker, lots of flavor for a light beer. Miles ahead of the other light beers I've had over the years."
"If only these were as cheap as the bottom of the barrel lights this would be my shitface maker."
"Boston Beer Company advertises this as a ""light"" beer that doesn't taste ""light"". I agree that but that doesn't make it more than an average beer. A good session beer but I'd rather run off the extra calories and just drink a Boston Lager."
"Drinkability: It is not bad for what it is and would be a nice beer for the bmc buddies or drinking while eating pizza."
"And hey, I've been living in Boston 20 years, I'd like to cheer for the locals, I just can't cheer for Sam Adams Light."
"Drinkability- I'm pretty conflicted on this one. On one hand it went down fast and was pleasant to drink. On the other hand the only reason I can see to drink light beers is to save on the calories and this doesn't do it. For the same number of calories,, I'll take a more full flavored beer."
"This is a really easy drinking beer that's light and refreshing. It's not loaded with flavor, but it's still really satisfying."
"Taste is nothing like a light beer. It's malty and rich but a bit watery. Mouthfeel is creamy and sharp. Overall a great light beer"
"I am not a fan of light beer, however, if you are going to drink one Sam Adams Light would be the one for me."
"Its a great light beer, that being said its still a light beer. It looks great when poured but I was dissapointed with the smell and taste. I'd drink it again if it came in a variety pack but I wouldn't go out of my way to get it. Overall I wasn't impressed but I can see why some enjoy it."
"A very good beer for its style, but not my favorite SA offering. Definitely a good session beer that won't make you feel too guilty."
"I will drink it, if I were wealthy."
"Wow what a head, very tight rich head of about 4 inches when poured into my chilled clear beer mug. Fine lacing right to the last sip. The color is much darker than I would have expected for a light lager. A beautiful 16 on the SRM chart. Nice sweet malt smell, nothing overpowering. Nothing overpowering about the taste, just crisp and refreshing. I would drink this beer again, one of my top choices for a light beer."
"One of my favorite beers that you can find anywhere. Nothing distinguishable about the taste, but it has the perfect amount of carbonation and does not taste watered at all. I love almost all sam adams, and this beer does it for any time of the year."
"Pours a clear amber color with visible carbobation and about a one finger frothy head, which gives way to minimal lacing. The aroma is faint with a toasty malt backbone with hints of citrus. The taste is of two row malt toastiness with hints of banana and ctirus and a small hop bite to it. The motuhfeel is moderately carbonated and slightly watery. Overall for a light beer it has great taste and flavor. You can easily drink a sixer of these and want more, for a light I would go here first."
"D - Crisp and refreshing, could easily kill a sixer without feeling too bad about it. Definitely the best light beer out there, but that's kinda a ""valley of the blind"" scenario. Still enjoyable for what it is."
"Taste, there is taste here people! Most malt and hop feel in anything this side of Sprecher's diet beer. I guess if this is the route you need to go, SA is highly recommended."
"Drinkability: Very good for the style and one of my favorites in the style. This does have elements of the taste I associate with Sam Adams. That being said, I am likely to go to other beer styles first and would pass it over if it were not in the variety pack."
"The beer has a nice amber orange color to it. also has a nice white head about 1"" then disapears to a really thin white lace. A nice malty smell. It has a very nice malty taste at first then a little hop flavor on the back of the tongue. I would say it is very drinkable, and would take it over most light beers."
"Standard brown bottle with a brewery freshness date of August poured into a SA perfect pint glass. Sam Adams light appears a clear light orange color with about a finger of head that is composed mostly of bubbles that rise to the surface from the etching in the bottom of the sensory glass. The aroma has a very light grainy sweetness and a touch of hops. Taste includes the grainy sweetness upfront as indicated by the aroma and through the medium light body has a slight bitterness in the finish. Moderate level of carbonation and a slightly noticable alcohol character in the back of the throat for only 4%. There is a lingering presence of light levels of diacetyl mixed with the grain left in the mouth after each sip tasting quite buttery. Overall not bad, I guess if I was forced into drinking a light lager this would be the one to have."
"Drinkability: For a light beer I'll give it this - it's very drinkable, it quenches the thirst well, and it went very well with Chinese food. I'm rather impressed for a light beer - I can see why it is the highest rated one and I would not hesitate to reach for it if I had to pick a light beer."
"If you're been searching for a light beer that you can actually taste, then Sam Adams Light is the way to go. Cheers!"
"Initially, I was a little hesitant about trying this beer because I am not a big fan of light beer. But because this is from the Boston Beer Company, I decided to give it a whirl. Boy, I am glad I did. Overall, a nice brew, much better than any other light beer I have ever tasted. I would consider this the ""King of Light Beers."" I would definitely have another one."
"D: The overall drinkablity of this beer is high, easy to drink and is not heavy. Would I buy this> no. A nice beer to try, but not one I would get,> I typically do not get light beers. But this one did have a high flavor content for a light beer. If you are in search of a light beer this is the one."
"Not dissapointed but deffinatly not the best by Sam Adams."
"D: This is a beer that just makes me happy that someone made it. Infinitely more drinkable than your typical ""lite"" in that it's interesting enough to want more than one of."
"Overall it's not bad. Certainly not typical of most light beers. This is probably the only light beer I have had that I would have again if offered."
"D Very, very good (and part of the point I am sure) 4.5"
"Beer is thin and a little watery with a grainy aftertaste. Its mildly sweet on the front but overall its a little muted. I guess its a pretty good LIGHT LAGER but its not a very palatable beer. I'd rather be drinking almost any pilsner to this. What a shame."
"D: Not the most flavorful beer, but hey, it's a light beer. It is watery compared to Boston Lager, but a whole lot better than any other light beer I've had. It's refreshing and enjoyable and I'm sure we'll cross paths again."
"D- If we are to truly call this a light lager, yeah it's at the top of the category. This isn't a beer I am all that crazy about, but it this beer is something like the world thinnest fat person. As a light lager, yeah it's awesome. In the broad scope of beer? I'll pass on it."
"I am not a light beer drinker but I'd tolerate having to stick to these if it was what was on offer."
"Drinkability- I could drink a kegs worth no problem LOL. It is very easy to drink for mass consumption. I only have two of these so the other one will probably be saved to drink tomorrow when it is even hotter out."
"D- Great, will return to this one! I was leery as it is a light beer, but it had a better mouthfeel than most light beers I've experienced"
"I wanted the Latitude 48, so I had to get the whole Summer Styles box. Oh well, I guess I'll suck it up and drink the extraneous bottles. Tee hee. This one pours a clear pale straw, tending toward more of an amber in the bulb, topped by about a finger of white micro-foam. The nose comprises light wheat, light corn, puffed rice, and some very faint hop florals. The taste holds notes of caramel, light toffee, a mild bitterness, and a vague extra bolt of sweetness (which is rather short-lived). Honestly, not as bad as I imagined. The body is light (...do I even need to say it here?...), with an active carbonation and a dry finish. Overall, a pretty solidly decent light beer...a first for me, for sure."
"[Drinkability]: Fairly good, but doesn't impress me."
"Having enjoyed my fair share of Sam Adams when the selection is a little thin at bars or restaurants, I was not surprised to find that Light is also a pleasant beer to have around when a light beer is necessary."
"D: Quite drinkable, easily best light beer I've encountered."
"This beer proves that light beer doesn't have to taste like a light beer. I've said it before, Sam Adams knows what they're doing."
"Sure do wish all light beers were this good!"
"Not their best, but certainly tasty for a light beer."
"Mouthfeel is very light and watery, just as it should be. Very drinkable and refreshing. Actually quite a good beer for what it is intended to be."
"On a hot summer day it would certainly beat the best of BMC and is worth your time if it looks like a long day of drinking in the heat. Goes down easy."
"Okay. I wouldn't go out of my way to get one of these. But it's drinkable. Pours a dark amber. Darker than I thought it would be. The head was about a finger, and faded almost immediately. Smell is malt with a hint of fruit. Maybe citrus? Taste is almost all malt. None of the fruit you get from the scent. Fizzier than what I normally like. Well, if it's cold, I suppose it's okay. But there are a lot of nicer beers out there. For a light it was pretty good. Way darker than I thought it would be and more flavor than I expected."
"D: Very smooth and clearly the best Light Lager out there."
"Maybe a slight bump over a BMC brewed light, but still not much better."
"Drinkability- It was an ok beer. It was really good for a light beer. I usually don't like light beers, they are too weak for me. A cold one of these might be nice though, especially on a hot day."
"Drinkability - Nice and smooth better then other light beers i have had."
"Not a beer I would seek out, but as part of the summer 12 pack, someone had to drink it."
"Pours a clear golden, with a white head that holds up decently. Smell is sweet grains, better than most all light beers. Taste starts off sweet and malty, and finishes with a touch of bitterness. Mouthfeel is nice and smooth. Easily drinkable, a solid brew. Recommended for those seeking a tasty light lager."
"Solid maltiness with minimal hops. Overall, a very refreshing, flavorful and quaffable brew. Stellar for the style."
"T: The taste follows the sweet malt presence in the smell. It is subdued a little from what I was expecting in the aroma and there is a watered down mouthfeel. Not surprising since it is a light beer. Some hops make a slight appearance in the finish. Overall this is better than the rest of the light beers on the market. It still falls short though of being a great beer."
"An ok selection I suppose. If I was to compare it to traditional, domestic light lagers it would potentially stack up well, but I feel that would not be accurate somehow."
"This is probably the best light lager I have ever had. Easy to drink, enough flavor to make it enjoyable. If it wasn't for the fact that it says ""light"" on the bottle, I never would have guessed."
"All categories rated against the other light lagers I have had."
"Notes - Eh, it's a light lager. For the style, it's better than average, though, so I have to give BBC some credit. I admit, I just finished washing my car in really muggy weather, and it's very refreshing. Then again, so would a glass of water, and that would have zero calories."
"Winner."
"There are an awful lot of crappy light lagers out there. By comparison this one is actually quite flavorful with a generous dose of hop bitterness. That said; the flavor doesn't hold a candle to their standard offering. If I wasn't grading to style the scores would be much lower."
"Overall: Probably my favorite light lager. Definitely more malted and hopped than larger commercial light beers."
"Overall I've had this brew before and this time I wasn't impressed.. Very bland.. Before this beer actually stood out and was impressive for a light lager.."
"D - exceptional for a light lager. has a nice look, some taste, and a great body. great beer for hot days or dieters. overal enjoyable."
"I find this to be not that drinkable, far too heavy for a light beer, and far too sweet. After about 2/3 of the glass I've had enough. It's not that it tastes bad, but it doesn't make me come back for more. Perhaps it's just not refreshing enough, and that's what I'm looking for in a light lager."
"D- meh, not the most exciting beer in the world but certainly not offensive. just sort of bland and reminiscent of a macro lager."
"Poured a nice amber with minimal lace. Mild smell of sweet malts and mild hops. Similar to the regular Boston lager - well balanced in flavor but a watered down version. While yes, this is more flavorful than many other light beers, after having zero light beers for a very long time, it tastes weak in comparision. But the sweet/caramel malts are there, the crisp apple lager taste, some hops as well. If I had to choose amongst light beers I'd probably choose this one. But if I could choose any beer, I'd probably not choose light. Its worth the calories."
"If I drank more light beer I would choose this one."
"Pours a nice golden color with about a one finger head that leaves a little trail. The aroma is malty with a lot of citrusy lemon flavor in it. Also pretty grainy with a hint of caramel. Cant smell any hops. The taste goes down smooth, its lemony at first with some malt in the back round and grain as its going down. Light yet flavorful. In all honesty I hate light beers, but this is without question the best light beer ive ever had. Its a truely enjoyable light beer, which is something I cant say for any other light beers. nice mouthfeel and drinkability."
"D: easy, THE easiest to drink and best tasting light lager I have ever had."
"In no way does this match up with Sam Adams' other brews, but it is undoubtedly the most complex light beer I've ever tasted. Personally I wouldn't go with it on most occasions, but if you want something with taste that isn't too heavy this would be a solid choice."
"Drinkability - As light beer it is a no-brainer that it goes down easy and has a lighter abv so it can be drank all night. In short this is quite possibly the best light beer ever made"
"D- I can find nothing wrong with this. Would make an excellent session beer. It is not something I will be seeking out, but I would never turn one down."
"Drinkability and mouthfeel: A lot of this beer reminds me of the main lager of the brewery but just made to fit in the light beer category. Judged against other light beers, it stands up very well."
"Smell is faint hops and light amber malts. Some grassy hop notes. Nothing special. Taste is of course light , carbonation takes over but you get some decent lager yeast flavoring and light hops. Mouthfeel is average, it's slightly creamy but still too thin for my tastes. Drinkability is great. If I was a macro drinker this would probably be the perfect gateway beer into craft. I will definitely drink this again."
"Nice appearance with a pale copper color and generous white head. Nose is a little light on aroma, but has some toasty grains in there. On the palate it is noticeably watery, but surprisingly has some hop flavor and bitterness to go with the light toasty malt. I see a resemblance to the Boston Lager, though I'm not sure how much they intended to be there. Easy drinking, of course."
"Drinkablity for this one is actually exceptional due to the lightness and the fact that I don't want to dump it down the drain after the first sip. Strickly comparing it to other light beers, this is outstanding! Not a lot of complex flavors but no offensive flavors either. Well done!"
"D-This is a very easy drinking full flavored light beer, and while there's not a ton of things going on, there's a lot more here than you usual watery, light beer."
"Drinkability: Highly drinkable and tasteful for a light beer. Pretty average for a beer in general, but great for a light beer. Sam Adams impresses me yet again."
"Drinkability: As a beer overall, this one is fairly average. As a light beer, however, this stands out in almost every way in comparison to others. I could also see this going well with most foods."
"(D)- Very sessionable. A beer I would definitely have all the time in my fridge if I was a light beer drinker since this have more flavor than any of the style I have had so far. Fantastic for the style."
"Not exactly a full-flavored beer by any stretch, nevertheless at 4% it's not a bad lawnmower beer, or lunchtime table beer. Obviously a better light beer than you'd get from the big boys."
"Drinkability was excellent. Perfect for getting your beer thirst quenched after weeks of hop bombs and huge stouts."
"Had this for lunch at a local restaurant. Poured into a pilsner glass. Pours a dark copper with a thick white head on top. Decent retention; left some sticky lace. Scents of grains, honey, and fresh bread. Light hop scent. The body is crisp and effervescent. Almost a little too much carbonation. Decent enough though. Great bready sweet flavors that finish with a slight bitter pop. I was impressed with this. The standard for light lagers I think. I'd have this again for sure."
"Amber appearance with light white foamy head. Lighlty metallic and bit grainy, but largely the same to me as ""Sam Heavy"". Nice light body that goes down very easy. Excellent mix of malt and hops, and a faint bit of caramel. The true definition of light, except I actually prefer this over the heavy alternative. Completely drinkable, light and easy going down."
"pours a light copper with a one finger white head. light floral aromas. the taste is very light and bready with biscuit tones. faint malt and caramel throughout. very grainy with a creamy mouthfeel. a bit watery but compared to most light lagers, decent flavor. crisp and refreshing, just very very light and too boring for me."
"Incredibly smooth. Full of flavor, mildly sweet, very low bitterness. Absolutely impeccable. This is what a light lager should be."
"I stock this one in my fridge along with Peanut Butter and Jelly."
"Overall - I really like this for being a light beer. It's very clean and refreshing without being bland and tasteless. No bad grain flavors, not off-tasting phenolic flavors. Just nice, clean and refreshing."
"It is a decent light beer. It stays true to Sam Adams the original. There are a lot of beers that the light version tastes nothing like the original this not that beer. It seems to be just that a watered down version of the original. The mouthfeel is thinner. The reddish amber is just a little lighter as with the flavor except the flavor of hops. They stayed the same. Except the flavor of hops the stayed about the same. It is what is supposed to be."
"Samuel Adams Light is an exceptional ""light"" beer. This brew hardly belongs in the light beer category. This is a surprisingly flavorful and refreshing beer if you haven't had the pleasure of enjoying a bottle of it (I've yet to find it on tap)."
"D - not high when compared to other light beers, but very high for any other beer"
"This beer is amazing for a light beer. I tried to score it as compared to other light beers and I am definitely not a light beer fan. Compared to my favorite IPA style - well you can't it isn't fair. I will say it has more real beer flavor that regular Bud, Coors etc. It looks real, tastes real and smells real. Most light beers are more akin to club soda than beer. It will never be on my favorite list, but when trying to go light it is a winner."
"Sam Adams beers are generally decent, but I must have either gotten a skunked one, or this beer just really sucks. Nose was grainy, taste was like wet burlap, and the finish was something I could not get washed out of my mouth quickly enough. Very disappointing."
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a golden color with a small head. Smell is mild, some malts. Taste is crisp with malts, actually some flavor here. Feels light in the mouth and has good drinkability. Overall I found myself saying ""this is a light beer? "". For this beer style, this one is darn good."
"Notes - This is in no way what anyone thinks is a light beer. Sure at only 119 calories that might make it lighter. At 4% this beer was made to session. Just a good beer in my book. Might as well have another while I'm at it."
"NOTES: BJCP Light American Lager"
"There is a tie between this and Michelob Amber Ultra for my favorite light beer. Both still have a hint of flavor and far exceed any of the other macro lights (lites)."
"I could drink quite a few of these, but this is far from my favorite style."
"D: Not bad for a light beer, but doesn't hold its own against the regulars offered by Sam Adams."
"When poured , gave a beautiful golden color, with a nice white frothy top, that did not cling to the glass. It smelled to me like a Sam Adams beer(to me they seem to all smell fairly similar). A very smooth drink from begining to end. I also found barely any after taste. I really enjoyed this beer, and would recommend to any light beer drinker."
"Bottle to glass. Honey color, head faded pretty quickly. Smell was Ok, very light malt and citrus. Taste was very lean, not much going on. Got some malt after it warmed to about 60-65 F. Thought this might be a good beer to just keep around when I wanted something on the light side but not really feeling this one."
"If I were to turn to drinking Light Beers (which I cannot imagine) this would be a decent choice."
"Serving type: bottle"
"Clear, sparking copper color, with a thin white head. Nicely carbonated. Minimal malty aroma. Taste is light and clean; maltier than other light beers I've tried. Got a little hint of hops, although certainly nothing powerful. Almost no aftertaste, and very easy drinking. A nice option when watching your calories."
"D: As soon as I poured this, I was impressed with the color. Incredibly colorful for a light beer. If light beer is your thing, which for me it is not, then this would be a caseworthy choice."
" ~ Again, for a light beer this good. I certainly recommend this brew to all interested in finally trying a light beer that's worth the time and money."
"I bet this is a big seller, and I'm certainly not gonna knock Sam Adams just because it's readily available. I got this one in a summer variety pack, and I've enjoyed most of the beers out of that. Truth is, however, I'd prefer they leave this one out; furthermore, it's tough for me to contemplate a time when I'd pick Sam Adams Light over ANY beer. Maybe over the worst of the worst (read: Milwaukee's Best Light or King Cobra), but even then it might still be a decision."
"Flavor is very light and delicate, but tasty. Toasty and caramel malts are followed up by a very mild floral hop bitterness and flavor. To me this is like a light amber lager. It is pretty good for a lower calorie beer and would make a fine choice for converting some BMC friends."
"D- This is a great ""light"" beer but just an ok beer overall."
"Pours a nice dark orangish amber with a small white head that fades fast. The smell is not very strong, some hops and malt there, sweet notes, underwhelming, but pleasant. The taste starts somewhat sweet with a malty flavor, finishes with smaller doughy notes, could use a bigger hop kick. The mouthfeel is light, highly carbonated, crisp but missing some balance. This is an easy drinker, not much flavor but still enjoyable. I can see why this is a better light beer option."
"strange. the world of light beers are largely a massive oxymoronic reality...i think this and yuengling lager light are the most interesting semi-macro lights out there. this is sweeter than the big Y"
"D: As light beer goes, this is about as a good as it gets. Its flavor is leagues beyond the watery mainstays of this style. If I had to drink a Light beer, this would be my only pick."
"Rated as much as posible within its style as a LIGHT beer, and being that I think this is superior to most ""lights"" pushes its score up some as oppossed to be rated as a beer that isnn't light."
"D - very drinkable although I feel like I would get sick of the sour taste after awhile."
"D- Moderate to through the roof. Not my style of beer. But a shining light in the dark underbelly that is the light lager. Kudos to Jim for not cutting corners on this brew."
"D) For a ""light"" beer I would definitely drink another as long as it came in a glass - I don't want the stigma of ""light beer drinker"" advertised by the bottle."
"12oz. bottle served in a standard pint. Poured a translucent amber with a 1.5 inch off-white head that quickly reduced its volume to half its size before settling into a quarter inch consistent cap; copious tiny bubble present in solution. Simple nose - cereal grains, some caramel notes and a hint of skunk. Taste follows nose. Mouthfeel was light-bodied and effervescent; just shy of being prickly. Easy drinking, but nothing too special; however; compared to other light lagers its not bad."
"This is probably one of the best light beers I have ever had. It's essentially an excellent, lower-calorie replica of the original Boston Lager. The beer retains much of the non-light version's characteristics without being diluted too much. I found the hoppiness to be less distinct. Perhaps the graininess was added to compensate? If you're looking for an excellent light beer, I highly suggest getting this one. It's not as good as the regular Sam Adams brews, but I rate it so highly because it's an excellent light lager."
"O- This beer isnt very bad for a 'light' beer. It doesn't taste like a rice/corn beer. Never thought I would say this but its just a good light beer."
"I was pleasantly surprised by this. I don't know if I like it enough to buy it again (except during summer in the variety pack), but it is the best of its style I've had."
"This was so much more than I expected for a light beer. Picked it up in the Sam Adams summer mix pack. Poured into a Sam Adams Perfect Pint glass. It had a very nice amber color to it, with some semi-stick lacing to it that lasts most of the drink. Had a white fizzy head, the middle dissapeares about 1/3rd through the drink and the edges stay through the entire drink, oh yeah and good clarity like most Sam Adams products. Based on the appearance alone you can't tell it's a light beer. The smell was ok, smells much less ""cheap"" than the average light beer. Has a bit of a grainy smell and a little bit of yeast type aroma, not strong though. You can taste the malt with slight bitter aftertaste, again not too string. I wasn't a big fan of the mouthfeel, I found the carbination bite a bit strong for my liking, not quite as strong as a tonic, but it doesn't last long. Despite the my carbination complaint, I found it very drinkable and refreshing. Overall I'd have to be honest that I was impressed."
"Not sure what competition this thing won, but its not a bad beer. But against beers that aren't aiming for ""light", I have a hard time thinking this beer would be competitive."
"Maybe a new catergory for beer? Not light but not regular, kind of welterweight?"
"12 oz Brown Bottle obtained at Shaw's Supermarket Derry, NH. crystal clear amber color with a half inch of off white head that dissipated fairly quickly leaving an eighth of an inch of head to sit on top of the brew. tinges of caramel and toffee graces the nose with a citrusy smell, and a tinge of the supporting hops. tastes of caramel, toffee, cracker like undertone with an orange or lemon zest. light mouthfeel. good drinkability not too light where it tastes like water."
"D: For a light beer, this has alot of character to it. It's by far the best light beer I've tried. Goes down so easy, it's scary."
"D- deceptive for a light beer, id put it above Amstel as one of th emost drinkable lights around"
"Overall, this went down very easy with the food served. A palate cleanser or hot weather beer for sure. Not something I grab to savor, but very easy to down these. If you find your middle is getting a bit thick, and want to cut calories and still drink a volume of beer, this might be the way to go."
"Having said that, SAL does not fill you up, and you can metabolize a couple bottles very easily, whereas with regular beer you'll be working them off for a few hours."
"D- I'd reach for another over Bud, Miller, or Coors... but would rather be enjoying something not accompanied by the word ""light"""
"Drinkability/Final thoughts - Well I'm not big on lite beers, I was however curious about this one. This lite beer is extremely easy to toss back, 2-3 pints even, on any given day. It's not rich, or robust, and at times can be a little boring, but Id say this is one of the best lite beers you can get for your money. The appearance was lacking a bit, but the smooth caramel flavors make up for it. Sam Adams Light is definitely the best lite beer that Ive had, and I say go for a try. Cheers!"
"Overall, way more flavor than I could ever expect from a light beer. A solid offering that really isn't just the light alternative to Boston Lager, but a good brew in its own right. It should not be criticized for being light."
"D - I could definitely knock back a few of these on a hot summer day."
"This beer is my safety-net beer."
"A bit of a surprise I must say..."
"One of the only light beers I'd ever purchase with a clear conscience. A great beer to initiate the light BMC drinker into the realm of craft brews, although it's not THAT far of a step off the curb."
"Another beer from Sam Adams that I wasn't too impressed with several years ago, but my opinion has changed. For a light beer it has a lot of flavor, and if the ABV number is right, would still be quite poundable."
"I would recommend Sam Adams light to anyone who is watching their calories or people who enjoy lights but doesn't want to drink garbage like Bud or miller light. 5 more flavors to go!"
"The idea that these guys offer a light beer is comical, but I guess the market needs another one, so here goes... pours an orange-copper body that boasts a thick, two-finger head that does not look light.... sweet, malty bouquet; bright and a bit punchy, but still leaves a beer drinker a bit wanting.... body is sturdy, but not heavy--in fact, its lack of hops melows the mouthfeel to an actual light beer approximation--highly drinkable...the obvious absence of hops creates a vacuum--I know this isn;t supposed to be a less caloric version of the lager, but the malt doesn't bite either... pleasant, with prerequisite thinness and smoothness... did Samuel Adams have to use the silver label as a joke or a jab? as a light, I'd defer to these guys on name alone... the beer is meant for sudsing whatever carbs and grilled proteins you're eating anyway..."
"d- this beer was a pleasant surprise, this may be my new go to light beer, very drinkable, it's lightyears away from the usual adjunct light beers."
"I rarely drink light beers, but this one is definitely something I can tolerate and reminds me of a miller light with a little more taste."
"Very nice for a light lager!"
"D - This is an easy party beer. Quite drinkable."
"Definitely not good. The only brew by Sam Adams that might be worse is the Hefe. Maybe I got a bad batch or something. I'll try to get another and update review later. Whew."
"Drinkability is good and if I wanted a staple stock-the-fridge beer that wasn't quite as calorie-laden as my usual heavy-hitters, this would likely be my choice."
"It's drinkable, but no more so than most other lights."
"D - This light is one hell of a light beer. Despite some minor flaws, as a light beer, this is good and very drinkable. The color surprised me too. Nice solid beer!"
"D: Goes down easy but I'm not sure I am in love with the after taste that I got."
"MF&D - Light and crisp. Not very big on flavor, but its quite drinkable."
"Drinkability- Just enough flavor and body to be somewhat interesting and refreshing. Not my cup of tea, but a great gateway beer for neophytes testing the non-macrolager styles. Better than other ""light"" beers."
"I would recommend this beer be the first you try, if your new to Samuel Adams family of beers"
"This beer poured a nice copper, vaguely amber color with little head that rapidly dies and leaves no lacing. The nose has hints of apricot and noble hops but it is dominantly malty - it smells like a marzen. The taste begins with a rush first of carbonation with preceding almost any flavor, followed by the malt and then a modest assertion of the Noble hops. The finish is short, a little awkward, and has a slight sourness to it. This beer rates high on the drinkability scale, if only for its 4.0% ABV."
"Highly drinkable, but that's not out of the ordinary for this style, given its ABV I wouldn't categorize it as an above average smooth drink."
"D- Great beer. and a def 6er for this one.."
"D: Easy drinker, and enjoyable, this is a pretty great beer for what it is. I'll be buying this again."
"drinkability is good if you want a light american lager this is your beer"
"Overall, a notch better than other light lagers. This would be one of my choices (along with Yuengling light) as a go-to light lager."
"I love Sam Adams as you probably know if you read my previous reviews and this is no exception. I like this beer a lot and I am not really into light beers. It's like the diet pepsi of beers."
"Very light body. Thin and watery texture. It would be easy to pound these, but it just doesn't taste very good. Gets bumped up to a 3.5 because it doesn't give that awful light lager recoil feel."
"Obviously better than other light beers, but since I view this as a pointless category, I compare this versus the grand spectrum of pale lagers."
"-RR"
"D - I guess if I ever went on a diet this beer would be up for consideration. Glad to try but doubt I will ever buy it."
"Drinkability: this has to be the best light beer on the market today. It has a nice flavor and is easy to consume."
"Drinkability... definitely not a drain pour, but I'd rather have something with more flavor. Choice between this and ""Lite"" Or Bud Light, this wins, but I prolly wont buy it again unless I really do have no smell due to sinus."
"Overall - This is a good beer. I drink it quite frequently when I want something ""light"". I'm not sure it belongs in the same category as other light lagers though."
"Poured a bottle into glass at 45 degree angle and finished pour in the center. Nice head for a light beer. Suprised by the lacing left by this beer. Smell had some fruity tones to it. The mouthfeel was very smooth and the drinkability was very high. This is a solid light beer and should be compared only to other light beers. The appearance was also impressive with a nice copper color."
"D 4.5 - This stuff is one of the best light beers I have had to date. A nice surprise indeed!"
"The head was thin but at least it was there, which is usually hard to find for a light beer. The color was alot darker than most light beers that I've seen. The taste was exceptional for a light beer and the mouthfeel was pretty smooth for the most part. Overall I think it is a great light beer."
"This is a pretty decent beer even looking beyond its status as a light. A light beer that tastes like beer? Well, this is the first I've had, though I'd like to try some light micros to compare. To say this is by far the thickest, maltiest light beer I've ever seen or tasted isn't necessarily saying much since my experience with lights has only been the domestic swill some friends of mine like. But this one has a decent malt and hops taste and smell, the subtle toasty, nutty accents one wouldn't expect to find in a light, and a decent mouth feel. As lights go, I'll stick with this one until someone points me to something better."
"Well, as light beers go, you could do a lot worse, though that's damning with faint praise. At least any prominent adjunct character is refreshingly absent, a departure from the usual light beer fare. If you have to drink light, this one would go down ably enough. I might not seek it out, but I'll take it before just about anything else in the style."
"Light mouthfeel with medium carbonation. A little watered down but that shouldn't come as a surprise. Pretty tasty for a light beer and I have to say I actually wouldn't mind having a few of these in a sitting. Highly drinkable, nothing outstanding but I'm pretty sure there's no other light like it."
"D- Excellent! This ""light"" beer is in a class of it's own"
"Z"
"Pours copper clear. Nice rocky cream-colored head. Mild hop aroma, hint of malt. Not offensive. Smooth, easily drinkable, low alcohol light beer. This light beer does not trade micro-trademarks for appearance, aroma or taste. Certainly a session beer at 4% abv. Recommended for just about any occasion."
"D: Very drinkable. Yes, it may be a bit ""heavier"" than other light beers, but, that's because there's still a little body in this beer, which to me, makes it even that much more drinkable. Yes Budweiser may pitch their ""drinkability", but if the taste is poor - as is with Budweiser - it doesn't matter how light the beer is...I wouldn't be able to finish it. So, Sam light is far more drinkable to me."
"Better then most light beers."
"Pours a clear, pale yellow. 1 inch head with good retention and good lacing. Smells of sweet malt and cleanliness of a lager. Fits the style rather nicely. Has a high carbonation level. Smooth and crisp mouth feel. Tastes of a sweet malt and strong lager. Overall, one of the better light lagers I've ever had."
"Decent flavor and nose, both with a little more complexity than you would expect from a light. Does feel light and diluted, but then again. . . it is a light beer, so what do you expect. For a light beer, it's a real contender; just considering it as a member of the beer universe, still pretty solid. Overall, good quaff. If you feel compelled to drink a light beer, this is probably the way to go."
"I have had a few light beers and this rates best among the several that I have had. The taste does not differ much from the reular Sam Adams lager and therefore is quite easy to switch from one to the other without even noticing."
"Pours a light amber with a small white head. Aroma of light fruits, wheat malt. Hops are prevalent and well balanced Initial taste is of caramel malt and as the beer warms and becomes it much more fruity and light and crisp. Although this is not technically a lighter version of the Boston Lager, it sure tastes like it! A little less fruity, weaker palate. But certainly the best light beer I've ever had and it is so close to the SABL that they're practically interchangeable. I applaud SA for making a light beer that actually has flavor and no adjuncts!! Tasty and refreshing."
"Reviewed on: 10-28-2008 12:55:30"
"Very Good for a light beer probably one of the better light beers out there. Very close to sam adams boston lager a littel less alcohol content though which was the only downside that i see in this one. I think i would definitely buy this beer again."
"6/4/7/4/12 (3.3/5)"
"Tasted on July 31, 2007. A light beer with the color of most other lager style beers. Medium amber with a small head. Aroma is light caramel malts, wheat and grains. For a light beer with a ABV of barely 4% the flavor is huge. Malty and hoppy with a crisp bite. You could put this head to head with many non loght beers and it would blow them out of the water. It is the best light beer I have ever had."
"Taste is a lighter body version of the Boston lager you can taste the malt with some yeast. I was surprised that this beer was pretty good. It is one of the few fuller body light beer that I have tried and enjoyed."
"Light beer is kinda like diet soda. Overall, it sucks, but if it's the only thing that's offered, you take it and smile. Sam Adams is definitely the best light beer I've tried. The diet taste is minimal. If you must do ligth beer, this is the one to choose."
"Best American Light Beer. Dark golden in color and sparklingly clear, this beer's carbonation is lively on the tongue and fizzy and crisp in the finish. The flavor is a bit thin, but the beer has a nice, well-balanced hope and malt flavor. Most importantly, it's not rice beer like most other American Lights and American Standards. I like it and will order it again... if I ever go on a low cal diet."
"I don't really know how to go about rating this beer. Compared to other pale, fizzy, watery lagers it's spectacular. But in the full spectrum of beer it's below average, like most light beers. The taste pleasantly surprised me with a full mouthfeel that lacked the super watery, fizzy feeling that most American light beers have. The malty nose wasn't bad either, but nothing to write home about. Had a much better, more refined taste than pretty much every other pale light lager I've ever tasted. It's a bit sweet, malty, carbonated. Better than the competition in its bracket, but obviously falls short when compared to other, higher quality non-light beers."
"This is better than a Bud Light, Milller Lite, and a Coors Light. Pours clear gold with a nice white head. Faint sweet nose of barley and goldings. It does have more caramel and hops in the taste, which sets it above its peers. Not worth the price, but I'll drink it if someone else put it in the cooler."
"Compaired to other light beers, this one surpasses them all in every catagory."
"Got this sort of to complete my Sam Adams brewing tries (although I've still yet to sample the Triple Bock, which I hear is awful, or Utopia). This is not one of their best. Pours a nice amber color with a finger of head that dissolves fast and leaves no lacing. A touch of film on top. Nose is grainy malt, with an almost macro lager aroma. Flavor is very mild. A touch of quiet malt. Maybe a real subtle hop hint. Not a lot going on here, especially from a usually solid brewer. Carbonation is busy on a slightly thin body. Overall, I'm not impressed. I'll give it a bit of a break cause it's a light lager, and it's honestly probably one of the best I've had. That being said, it's the worst SA beer I've tried (and yes, truly, worse than the Cranberry Lambic)."
"D - I guess if I am ever in the mood for a Light Beer, or ever at WOW again and this is the best thing that they have (really it is), then the Sam Adams Light would add some taste to a bland style"
"Pours out a nice orangy amber with a fairly thick off-white head. Aroma is rather weak, lager-crisp and not particularly inspiring. Flavor is typical of a lager, fairly malty and a bit watery with a wan hoppy undertone. Texture is smooth and a little tingly. Definitely not Sam Adam's best - but better than other light beers I have tried."
"That is all."
"Light brown in color, not much head which diminished quickly, not much aroma but hoppy floral scent, very slight bitter, tastes like a light domestic beer but better..somehow, light body, slightly oily. Again, good for a light beer, but if you can handle regular beer, go with that instead for better taste."
"The choice is up to you."
"D - This is probably the best beer of its style, however, its still not going to be something I purchase very often."
"Now compared to all the other Macro brew lite beers out there, this one wins hands down. But it does have more calories than most light beers. Is it really a light then? No matter, this is better than any Macro and I would choose it anytime over the best they had to offer."
"Rumors had it this is one of the best Light beers available. I had to see for myself. Out of the bottle it poured a classic, clear, copper color with a two finger tan head. The retention was decent and the lacing moderate. The aroma was a little macro for my preference but still a good mix of clean lager malt and hoppy bitterness. The flavors were well balanced too, just enough of everything with hints of sweetness and a crisp finish. The aftertaste, however, was a little metallic. But for a light beer the flavors are surprisingly full and malty. The carbonation was a little high obviously being used to ""fill in"" the beer but the mouthfeel was still relatively smooth. The body was light and a bit watery but again, that's the style so I have to forgive it. Generally, this is a good beer, which is impressive for a Light so I have to give it high marks. If you gotta go light, go this way."
"I picked up this brew for 2 reasons, the first being the usual reason you might consider a light beer, the second being that it was recommended by someone whose beer opinion I respect. What a great all around beer -- ""light"" or not. The flavor and drinkability of the Sam Light make this a great session beer. Back in 2002 I see that Todd says this is a beer he wouldn't normally buy, but I'm pretty impressed with it all around and may have just found a new regular for the fridge."
"drinkability: very easy. My go to football beer when it's really hot or if I'm eating alot of food."
"Probably don't need another review of this beer, so I'm just going to say that it's my default light beer and what I order when I'm not in the mood to be creative. There are certainly lighter beers out there, but this is just an easy light lager."
"For a true ""light"" beer you can't do a lot better than this for stuff that's widely available in the ""macro micro"" space. One of my favorite SA offerings."
"I love this beer. I love it for what it is, which is a moderately complex and enjoyable beer, with a high degree of drinkability. It's not even fair to compare it to other light beers. That's like comparing the Lexus hybrid to a Prius. This beer is an enjoyable and interesting experience. I always like it out of my frosty fluted pilsner. Give it a try!"
"Ive had it a million times it's nothing special but for a light beer this is not a light beer. Confused? It's still got a dark amber coloring. Full tasting in the mouth for a light beer. A GOOD malty flavor with a faint carmel highlights that I used to love in the Octoberfest. Worthy of drinking everynight your out on the town or a cookout when your not doing keg stands or crushing Coors light. I don't know what the reason is that no one has tried to make light beers similar since this came out but cheers to Boston Beer co. for pulling it off. Seriously compared to ""light beers"" what's the problem"
"Had this one the same evening as regular Sam Adams. Not much difference, honestly. The appearance was fine, an amber color with decent head, but no aroma to speak of. Even less than the Boston Lager, if that's possible. Tasted of metallic, bitter malt, but the metallic bitter part was the most prominent component of the flavor. Not a very pleasant flavor, and it got more and more boring as I worked my way through the bottle. Not impressive at all."
"D- Easy to drink but I think this one is like a watered down Boston Lager. I prefer the regular."
"It looks and tastes like some kind of bock/lager hybrid but its actually just another light beer."
"Taste & mouthfeel: Soft malty sweetness with a bit of toast and leafy hops. Becomes dry and crisp rather quickly, with a light (but not watery) texture. There's a touch of noble hops in the dry finish, but it's not particularly bitter on the whole. Pretty damn good for a light lager. Can't say I'd buy this with any regularity, but it's great for what it is."
"For a light lager I guess this is decent, but as a beer I wasn't impressed at all. On the commercials it claims this beer won awards at beer shows even though there wasn't a light beer category.. I wonder what categories it won in? Anywho, it's way too light bodied and the taste is severely lacking. It's drinkable yeah, but it needs some taste. Also, for being light, it has a calorie count comparable to most regular beers."
"D - You could pound these back all day. Eventually, you'll harken back to real beer, but it's not this beer's fault."
"How light should a Light Beer be? The very fact that on the label Boston Beer Co. brags that Sam Adams Light took a medal at 'a major German beer tasting competition' even though 'there was no light beer category' begs the aforesaid question. That's arbitrary though, I suppose, as the focus should be more on flavor and drinkability where I'd say it has friends in Heineken, Beck's, and the like."
"D-This is my grab one and drink it from the bottle beer, easy for me to just pick up drink and forget for a little while that im a compete beer snob"
"However, this brew amazed me, and I think in the pantheon of light beers should rate far higher than it is here. This is LIGHT BEER folks, not regular, give it its due. It has a firm, almost nutty taste, no skunk and a smooth mouth feel. It pours a rich colour into the glass, rather like my beloved Yuengling, and frankly tastes like an old recipe lager. It is light in alcohol, only 4%, which makes it a great afternoon beer - its flavourful character will hold its own with anything from pasta to burgers."
"D-I was still tasting this beer when I realized it was almost gone. This drinks quickly and quietly, without fanfare, but I still think it's a great ""gateway beer"" to lead the masses away from macros to Brewtupia."
"Pours a nice clean/clear brown color, nice carbonation, nice two-finger off-white head, which leaves some nice sticky lacing behind. The nose is malty, with some slight hops. The taste is malty, slightly hoppy. Light body. Drinkable, not worth buying again though. Not into light brew's."
"Not a great beer, but it is one of the best light beers you can find. Nicely done for the style."
"Overall: good stuff that has it's place"
"Well, this is impossible not to praise. Beats all other widely available light beers hands down. Thing is, it is a very tasty brew REGARDLESS of it being a light beer. Easy drinking, delicious, cheaper than craft beer, and really really refreshing."
"Not a bad light beer at all. Amber in color topped with just a thin white head. The head fizzles pretty quickly and little to no lace is left on the glass. Not really a whole lot like a regular Boston Ale or Lager. This had a watery, slightly sour taste and just a bit of a hoppy flavor. Not really for me but if I feel like a light beer or you are looking for a good light beer definitely give this one a shot."
"medium amber in color with a with a two finger white head that quickly fades away with a small amount of sticky lace. strong smell of corn and corn husk but after a while turning to a slightly metalic smell. taste is smooth and malty and it has some flavor to it. carbonation was a little weak. not a beer i would buy again."
"This is definitely the best light beer that I have had and it really packs a lot of flavor. If the label didn't say it was light, then I would have never guessed it to be a light beer."
"All in all, it is possibly the best light ever."
"Pours a light golden amber with a one-finger white head that showed great life with lots of bubbles rushing to the top. This looks great compared to most light beers. Nothing too special in the smell with wheat, light hops and some other grainy smells. The taste was a fuller version of the aroma with some decent wheat and light hop flavors. The mouthfeel is crisp and clean and not very watery at all. This is one of the better light lagers I've tasted and very drinkable."
"The light beer that sets the bar for others in the style. Light beer drinkers should also see New Belgium's Skinny Dip -- 110 calories and 4.2% alcohol, vs. Sam Adams Light at 124 calories and only 4.0% alcohol."
"Overall, the beer is what it is -- just a better-tasting, more balanced version of a Light beer. If ever I was forced to drink a light beer, I'd definitely choose this over any of the macro water beer, but it's certainly no replacement for a fuller beer."
"Probably one of the best ""lights"" on the market, I've had this a while back and as luck would find due one of these snuck into my Sammy's variety pack. Light malty aroma nothing wrong here, pours a nice light copper small head little left on the glass. Mouthfeel is fuller than most but still thin considering. Good taste, I prefer more but this is a light. If you are a worried beer drinker this may be for you, If you enjoy beer, spend your cash on the real thing."
"Drinkability: I'm reviewing this as a light beer and as such it is the best I've ever had. Nice and refreshing. But if your main reason for drinking a light beer is calories, and not taste, take note of the 128 calorie count."
"Drinkability: A great beer to have after a long day of work, or after cutting the grass in the summer warmth. Nice session-able beer that I could easily drink all night if warranted. Certainly it's the best ""light"" beer I've ever had. Nice job, Mr. Koch."
"Easy to drink and enjoyable. It may be light beer, but it's actually pretty good."
"Pours a light amber color, very clear. Decent head that goes away pretty quickly. Minimal lacing. Smells of biscuity malts and a slight hop spice. A light beer that actually smells like beer! Taste is also great for a ""light beer."" Biscuity malts followed by a hop spice, some vanilla notes...almost like a watered down Boston Lager. Really terrific for a light beer, I must say. It doesnt have the usual off flavors that accompany the rest. Crisp, clean, and actually some flavor in there. Mouthfeel is light and fizzy. Clean finish. Very drinkable."
"Amber colored beer with a rapidly fading head.Aroma is mainly malty.Taste is toffee and bread.I have never seen a light beer with this dark of a color nor have I ever had a light beer with this much flavor.This is something both macro and micro beer drinkers could agree on.I could drink these all day.Highly recommend!!"
"The beer poured with an extremely thin head with some patchy lacing. Clear, light amber color overall. Aromas had a slight roasty hint to a generally bready and malty smell. Taste mirrored the aromas with a slight fruity and hoppy taste. Lightly grassy and pretty sweet for a light lager. Great carbonation, in general; very, very refreshing, light and crisp. Overall, I am not a light beer drinker, but this is pretty darn good for one."
"Here's the first light beer which I can say with confidence that I like. No off-flavors and just enough of the original goodness to keep on going."
"In many ways, this reminded me of a drier blonde ale. Though it is certainly the best beer with the word ""light"" on the label, I wouldn't call it the best light beer because it isn't really a light beer. While it might impress the initiated as a ""light beer," an average light beer drinker would find this brew contradictory to the idea behind a light lager in the first place."
"overall, a good alternative to a regular ""mass marketed"" beer, but not one that i'd pick unless i was outside on a hot summer day. not the best sam adams offering IMO."
"Pours orange yellow, Head goes quickly. Smells of Oranges and grain and a little malt. Very refreshing taste never would know this was a Light beer. This is a very drinkable beer one leads to another. Pricey but a nice smooth drink. I never drink light beers but gave this a try because its Sam Adams and find it to be very good!"
"D: An average if not slightly above average drinkability factor, wouldn't know this to be a light beer. The beer drank progressively better as it got along but still wouldn't invest in a six pack."
"If I were dieting on a hot summer day, this might not be a bad choice, but otherwise I'll pass."
"D - Good if you are counting your calories (will have to reject your man card and need to prescribe gravy shots) and better than other light beers. This would be a great example if not for the overcarbonation."
"As stated a couple times earlier in my review. It is not really your typical light beer. Of course it doesn't have the body or full flavor of other non-light beers, but for a light beer, it was surprising at how 'not light' it was."
"D: Honestly I think this one is better out of the bottle as it does a bit of a better job hiding the flaws in this beer, but still in terms of style this is about the best beer I've ever had. Good if you are counting carbs I suppose..."
"it is hot and humed hear today and i hade a couple of them that my cousan gave me, i usaly like a beer that is extream with flavor, this beer was thirst quenching, it poored real nice, with just the right amount of head and keept me wanting more, this is a great beer for the dog days of summer"
"D- Nothing like any light beer I have ever had. If anything this is like a watered down Sam Adams. I suppose I'm one of those people that finds people that drink diet soda to be retards and that thought reflects with this brew. However if someone offered me this brew(opposed to offering me a diet soda) I would gladly accept. If you are one of those people that drinks diet soda, perhaps this is the beer for you."
"I was really skeptical, but all that worry for nothing. Similar to the Boston Lager, but less hoppy and lighter in color. Nothing too complex, but hit the nail on the head for trying to make a light beer with some character. Really crisp, a fuzz dry vs. being a typical watery light beer. I was pleasantly surprised at this one. Very light and refreshing. Simplicity at it's finest."
"Could throw these back all day."
"Drinkability is average. If I'm in the market for a light beer I may try this again."
"Def best tasting light beer. Not something I would willingly purchase-but if a light is what you desire-this is the one."
"Well done Boston Beer Co."
"Very nice one from SA."
"D - Very good session beer good for BBQ or a hot afternoon, not my choice of beers but if choosing a light beer this is my choice."
"Crisp and goes down easy...way easy to chug!"
"A perfect beer to cut carbs/calories while still maintaining flavor. I'm sure it's not as ""light"" as the major brands (calorie wise), but it's rather tasty all things considered."
"Poured into a pint glass. 2 fingers of head float atop an amber body. Good retention, little lacing. Aroma is of fresh cut grain and a little bit of caramel sweetness. Flavor is like a lighter Boston Lager: bready and sweet but a tad watery. Mouthfeel is thinnish but satisfying. Really easy to drink."
"I enjoy this beer, it does have a hearty flavor to it, but it is a light beer. Not bad, and I do respect the different styles. This one is going into my good beer phaze. Enjoy the SA samle back. drink up and enjoy this beer, I had people ell my that notheing"
"Salud!"
"Wow, this light beer actually has some flavor. Aromas of grain, faint hops and some syrupy malts. Taste is very similar. Very grainy. A light hop presence keeps it drinkable. Decent body. Light with good carbonation. Perhaps the most drinkable light beer around. Nice job Sam Adams, just a little expensive for what you get."
"Notes: If I didn't know that this was a light lager, I would have rated it as an American Amber or a regular all-malt lager. This is a great beer that has the potential to ease the average BMC drinker into the realm of craft brews. However, it has all of the calories (and taste, plus more) of a normal American style lager, which I think puts it outside of the realm of light beers. This would be a great alternative to regular Budweiser and other domestic macro lagers because of the sheer fact that it actually has taste, and is very very drinkable... even for the ""only-drink-to-get-get-drunk"" crowd. Also, this is the only light beer that I consider to be actual beer."
"This beer is drinkable. But only because it is so light and neutral. A great representation of its style."
"overall for a light beer this is amazing, theres flavor and some body, my light lager of choice...if I ever decide i need one"
"As most Sam Adams beers this flows with drinkability. Pours almost a light amber color. The head is crisp and tasty with lasting affect. Stronger and more tasty thatn most light beers which can not impress those non beer drinkers. But for those who like beer this is a light beer with some muscle. Drinkable in any atmosphere."
"The taste is pretty malty with some caramel sweetness and a slight bitterness that shows up mostly in the finish. Good taster this light beer though I'm not a fancier of light beers in general."
" A decent party choice and a really good choice after long, hot day."
"Pours a clear solid orange with clumpy sudsy head. Not much retention or lacing. Smell: Clean, toasted malts and a touch of noble hops. Taste: Toasted and some caramel malt, noble hops. Mouthfeel: Light bodied, active carbonation, finishes with a kiss of bitterness and a hard water feel. The best light beer (or beer labeled as light) around, but I remember this being a bit better, did it change?"
"Poured into my pint glass and received almost no head on top of a light copper body that was pretty seethru, but still not invisible like other light beers. I couldn't pick up anything in the smell except some hops and faint earthiness - could've been me. The beer has a nice hoppy taste and some sweet juiciness in it, like apples. A light, thin body that goes down extra smooth but leaves its mark with the hop backbite and the little bit of sweetness. I will take this light beer over anything from other macro/""macro micros"" anyday, but still not my first choice."
"Pours a dark straw color with a small, quarter inch head, quite a lot better looking than any other lite lager I've seen. Aroma of lightly toasted bread, mild spice, green apple and sweet cornbread. On the palate, you can tell it's all malt, starts off with a solid Munich malt profile, lightly toasty but it leaves too quickly. Noble hop character provides a good floral note and gives it interest. This is certainly leaps and bounds above any other Lite Lager on the market, and applaud BBC for making it."
" Sure, the 4.0% ABV is there, but you're going to drink this because it's low calorie, better than the alternatives in it's class, and yes, it can be quite satisfying on a hot day when any other light beer just don't cut it. Unfortunately, it's not like that outside right now, so I'll enjoy the rest of these in my six pack, knowing that I gave it a whirl. It's a very basic beer with a very basic taste: consider yourself warned!"
"Won't convert me to liking light lagers, but if I had to drink one this would probably be it since the flavors are more pronounced than your typical light beer yet delicate at the same time."
"This beer is a nice clear orange with a small head. Very little lacing remains in the glass. Smell is grain like, a little richer than your average light brew. Taste is richer too. The hops are noticable and the beer has a nice flavor. Mouthfeel is fairly smooth with drinkability good as is typical with lighter brews."
"This would make a great introductory brew for most macro lovers."
"Goes down easy though, like a light beer should."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, mild kick, this beer is exactly what you would expect, a lighter version of Sam Adams Boston Lager, but still has enough substance to make it the best ""light beer"" out there."
"Pours a copper color with a short white head that laces a litle bit down the glass. Has a light malty aroma and some hops, but not alot. It had a kind of watery taste but a nice amount of malt and hop taste for a light beer. Has a nice mouthfeel - very smooth. The drinkability is good for a light beer. It is definately one of the better light beers out there and worth a try if you like light beers."
"For a ""light"" macro, this is awesome...I love it! Perfect for indoctrinating people to the wonderful world of craft beer."
"Ultimately, this isn't worth turning down, and is genuinely better than macros I've had. Not an award-winner, but surprisingly decent."
"Pours a copper color with a nice lace of head. The smell has virtually no aromas of corn or rice, but rather malty aromas. The taste has a very caramel malt flavor to it with bitterness being minimal. Mouthfeel is smooth and crisp. This is hands down the best light lager I've ever had. It's gonna be pretty hard to beat this."
"D: This is a sixer over poker kinda beer. Drink away boys and girls!"
"It's gonna be hard to get to the 250 character minimum on this one. Why? Well, it's so one-dimensional, and that dimension is: Light. One of the best -named beers of all time, basically. I will say that the tongue yields some pleasant nuttiness that is not unenjoyable. And I have reached the word count."
"D--The only reason I would drink light beer is if I needed save my life and I needed to be weaned off of beer. In that case I may choose death. That said, I looked up similar data on light beers found by others. Seems to be that you would do just as good getting a nice lager than a Sams Light because they have roughly the same number of calories. I can't believe people that there are a group of people who think they are loosing weight by drinking SA Light!"
"Pours a nice amber color with good head and good lacing. Nice scent, good and malty with slightly bitter traces. Great taste for a light lager, very clean and refreshing, but not at all weak like most 'light' beers. It has an excellent bit of hoppiness you won't find in the other light lagers produced in any quantity. Goes down nice and smooth. If I were to actually drink light beers in any amount, it would be this one."
"D: Best light beer I've ever had, but that's not saying much for this style, don't think I'll buy it again, but was nice to try to see if a light lager could actually have flavour."
"Drinkability: Low alcohol, just enough flavor, I could session with this for long hours with no problem. While this is probably just an average craft beer; when compared to other beers that call themselves light (or lite) beer (the typical BMC offerings) this is by far better."
"Smooth light bodied mouthfeel and very drinkable. There's a ton of better beers out there but if feel the need to drink a light beer, then this is the one to get."
"I´m reviewing this beer based on what it is, a light beer. Comparing color and taste, it´s seriouslly above other light beers. I´ve heard people say they would prefer bud or miller lite. I´m not a beer expert yet, but I don´t think there is any comparison. I trully think this is a light beer that doesn´t really taste like light beer (watered down beer)."
"Had this on tap at Chili's... Not bad for $2.99 at a 16-ounce size, but definitely not my favorite lite beer... was never a big fan of Sam Adams, and the only brew from the company which ever caught my fancy was the Cream Stout... this one doesn't do it for me for a lite beer... personally would prefer a Miller or Coors, but I'm sure those in the Boston area might be a little warmer towards a home-town favorite... Drinkability was average, and the taste, which wasn't awful just wasn't too impressive... somewhat bitter which really didn't do it for me... Not recommended... Better lite beers to choose from..."
"I am judging this light beer compaired to other light beers and compaired to them this beer is fantastic. I picked up a 12pk because I decided to only have the higher calorie stuff on weekends. Served in a pilsner glass formed and retained a nice head. Color was much darker than your average light beer but the taste was amazing it had flavor unlike most light beers. all in all if you are trying to watch what you eat this is a good beer to unwind with at the end of the day"
"The good folks at Sam Adams, through their advertising, get you to drink the Kool-Aid and think this may be something better than light beer, but its really not (""Won best beer, and there wasnt even a category for light beer""). If I was forced to drink light, which I sometimes am, I would choose this, but its probably along the same lines, calorie wise, as Guiness, but twelve steps up from Coors light, etc."
"Comment: This is a surprising light brew. It is more like a dilute ale than any macro light. Well done and one that I could recommend to my Coors and Bud light friends."
"While this is by no means my favorite beer, this is by far the best widely available light beer I've tried. The look, smell, & taste are totally decent when the style is considered. The carbonation is a light heavy, but that is the case for most light beers. Overall, an easy drinking light beer that can be paired with just about anything, I'd imagined. Recommended."
"tastes really malty has a dark color for light beer and i really wouldnt want to sit down and just drink one for the taste. my second to least favorite sam adams style. good for a light beer but if you want a good sam adams go elsewhere but an above average light beer thats for sure."
"D- Definitely my default beer of choice. SA Light is available practically everywhere, at a reasonable price ($5.99 / 6-pack). So you get a good quality ""light"" beer (not so light calorie-wise), for under a buck a beer."
"Mouthfeel and drinkability are on par for the style- its meant to be a light palate beer and it satisfies that."
"Good stuff."
"Drinkability- if I ever get a feeling to drink a light beer, this would be the beer for sure. If you stack it up to the Big Commercial Light beers (includin amstel) I would say that Sam Adams Light is the winner."
"Had more of a meduim bodied feel than a light. A good bit more than most light beers. Was a bit of a letdown. Expected just a bit more taste and aroma even for a light,afterall it's still a Sam Adams. Could have a few,just a teaser for me,makes me crave the real thing Boston Lager."
"Pours a super clear light copper hue with a one finger head that quickly dies down to an almost non-existant layer. No stickiness to be seen, not a whole lot goin' on with this beer in terms of looks. Smell is a bit metallic with a small amount of caramel malt and a hint of noble hops. A weak floral aroma seems to appear in the nose as well. Yeah, this is definitely a light beer. Watered down caramel malt and corn with a tiny hop aftertaste, nothing more, nothing less. Good fluffy light mouthfeel with a bunch of carbonation. If I had to choose a light beer, this would be it. Good flavor for the style, but clearly weak in the overall spectrum."
"Drinkability: It has alot to offer, relatively, for a little light lager."
"If I were to eliminate personall taste completely and judge based on style I'd rank this beer much higher. In my opinion this is the best mass marketed light beer out there, it actually tastes like beer!"
"Drinkabilty- Not so bad. I'm not a fan of light beers but as light beers go this was the best of the bunch that I've had."
"Notes; This beer can be a regular lager for other brand. Very nice label."
"In any event, it pours a mildly attractive reddish color. Nice malt backbone, some grain/yeast notes ... tastes like a real beer. One of the best of the ""light"" beers out there."
"A good entry in the light category. It's nothing overly special, but it's worth a try."
"Could drink several of these because it is about as light as a Michelob Ultra as far as ultra light brews go"
"No other light lager can come close to this one. This beer is perfection for the style as far as I'm concerned. Not many craft beer companies have even made light lagers. However, it's too bad that many macros cannot come close to matching a beer as good as this. It's not thin or watery, there are no adjuncts and it doesn't taste like a typical light lager. Could down a few of these on a warm day when I didn't feel like drinking heavier beers."
"Damn, a light beer that tastes like a real beer. At first it reminds me of the cheap amber lagers like Yuengling, but it doesn't have that annoying sweetness. This is just a nice clean, lager with a bit a pale grains, caramel malt and slight lager tang. I can't really pull any hops of it, which is a shame, but this is by far the best light beer I've ever had."
"The drinkability of this beer is amazing. Not paying attention, I easily finished a whole one while writing this review."
"D - Probably just passable for a drinkable beer, but very good for a 'light' beer. I would have given it a higher taste rating, but it is just missing something. Maybe the calories I am used to, but more likely hops and the lack of adjunct flavor. If I had to choose between all lights, though, this would probably be the best bet."
"Overall: This is one kickass Light. I follow the rules and judge within the beer's respective category. That's why my score is so high. If I was comparing this to a Vienna, then it would score low, but for a Light, it is phenominal. It is very drinkable, while still pretty tasty. This would be perfect for football games and hot summer days. There is one catch....it's not that light. It's pretty much got the same calories and carbs as a regular Bud. Don't drink this if you are on some kind of diet (that what Mic Ultra is for). This stuff is just lighter than the other Sam Offerings."
"D: A little ethereal but, for a light beer, is pleasant enough to consume."
"Not something I that would buy normally. I mean it really isn't a light beer, and I really don't buy light beers. But it still is very enjoyable."
"I hate to do this for a light beer, but I have never tasted anything like it in the category. It pours amber- who ever heard of that for a light beer? It has great a great malted barley flavor that finishes clean and light. It fools you into thinking that you are drinking a much more substantial beer. There is a great depth of flavor and crispness which almost never go hand-in-hand. Light beers are considered a joke, but don't laugh at this one- just smile."
"Poured into pilsner glass. Poured amber not piss yellow like most light beers. Actually has malty flavor that is very smooth with no aftertaste. If I was ranking this just against other light beers, this would have gotten much higher rating, but Im rating it among all beers. Definitely not a lighter version of the Boston Lager, tastes totally different."
"Body is a little thin, but it is a light beer so it is expected. Actually it was really good for a light beer."
""
"okay, no one here honestly enjoys light beers but this one has to be the best I have tried for one main reason . . . flavor. almost like its big brother, a touch of toasted malts. very drinkable and refreshing. great lawnmower beer or at a ballgame. what a light beer"
"I like Sam Adams Boston Lager. This tastes like a three-quarters stregnth Sam Adams. It may be slightly watered down but it's better than any LIGHT beer I've ever tasted. It's kind of hard to understand why it's considered a light beer. This beer is better than most regular beers. The color is more dark and gold than any typical type dometic beer. It smells better. It tastes better... Shit. It abides by Reinheitsgebot for Christ's sake. I guess the ingredients have a lot to do with it. No corn or rice, Budweiser. Just good pure beer."
"I have no idea what the calorie or carb count of this brew is, and I don't care. It's damn good beer."
"Very light mouthfeel, crisp and easy drinking. It's an easy beer to spend the day with."
"12 ounce bottle. Served in the ""new"" Sam Adams Lager pint glass, the beer pours a gold/amber color with an inch white head. It's darker than any other light beer I've ever seen. The beer smells like grain, honey and caramel. It's a sweet smelling beer. It tastes the same way, but there's also a little bit of a metallic taste. Even then, there's still more flavor compared to most (if not all) light beers. Mouthfeel is light, but it's also crisp and clean. Drinkability is good too, it's not hard to drink at all. Overall, this is by far the best ""light"" beer I've ever had. I don't drink light beer too often, but if I made it a point to get one this would be the one to buy."
"This is a GREAT beer. Sam Adams is the primiere brewer in America. They have really saved the classic beer taste from the Mega-Brewers. I always drink Sam Adams Lager if it is on tap. Sometimes (when I am feeling ""not so fresh"") I will drink the Light version...it has the same great color and taste as its big brother. I have only found a few places with it on tap."
"For the style, it absolutely mangles the competition. But it can't escape that beer-flavored-water vibe that light beers will probably always be cursed with. There's just no reason to drink light beer. There are better session beers if you want to keep it low-alcohol. And if I wanted to lose some pounds, I'd get off my ass and exercise and keep drinking the kick-ass high-calorie beers. This is not an area of my life I want to compromise, but Jim Koch gets my support for offering light-beeraholics something that actually provides a modicum of flavor."
"Drinkability: at 4.00%, definitely a session brew. Sam Adams Light has a lot more to it than any other light lagers that have chanced to get down my gullet. This is a fine golf course brew that has good flavor and doesn't interfere with your play. I'd have this again, no problem."
"Auburn color and crystal clear, with a thin white head (big-celled foam) which dissipates too quickly. The aroma is faint but malty, and the flavor's the same. Very drinkable for the style. I normally wouldn't try it but a friend left it at my house after a poker game. Waste not want not."
"D: Light beer? Yeah right! Pour this brew into a glass and don't tell a guy who only drinks Bud Light what this stuff is, and I would be willing to bet he would go ""This stuff looks dark and tastes kind of strong"". The only thing that makes this brew similar to other light beers is the fairly low ABV. After that, all similarities to any other light American beer stop there. All of that being said, I am normally not a light beer drinker, but this one is actually something that is fairly enjoyable. For the style, I would say it's nearly the perfect brew. On a hot day, the thinner mouthfeel and milder flavors of this brew are actually very good."
"Don't believe the hype! After the commercials and wearing the Sam Adams label, I really expected better from this beer. While I know this beer is not made with adjuncts, it had an unpleasant corny/grainy taste that I assoicated with some of the Mexican imports, like Sol. It was not horrible, with more color than other light beers, but if I were to pick-up a light beer, I'd be much happier drinking a Miller Lite than with a Sam Light."
"Note: I rated this high because as far as light beers go I think that this is the best that I've ever had (which isn't saying much), but I wouldn't drink this if a (decent) non-light alternative were available to me (I wouldn't be drinking it now but four of them came in my summer sampler case)."
"overall for a light beer this is amazing, theres flavor and some body, my light lager of choice...if I ever decide i need one, I got this in a beers of summer sample pack"
"Pours a light amber with a creamy head and scattered lacing patterns. I smell toasty, caramel malts, faint noble hops and a touch of alcohol, which is odd. Some graininess pops up as well. Flavor is metallic, grainy and with too much caramel. Like drinking a popcorn ball. Has a Sweet 'n' Low feel to the sweetness. Mouthfeel is extremely light, seemingly lighter than most light beers as the carbonation is so meek. I'll finish this, I guess. If I want a light beer, I'll stick with Shiner Light, which is actually pretty decent."
"Drinkability- Overall a very drinkable beer."
"this is a small version of the boston lager, identical in every way, just smaller. in the glass next to the boston lager i couldn't see any difference in the appearance. same nose, just not as strong. floral, vegetal hop aromatics and hints of caramel. some breadiness in there as well. taste is almost bone dry. more lightly hopped than it's counterpart, but the same kind of hops. finish is crisp and shorter than the aforementioned. at this abv drinkability is good. hands down the best beer i've ever had with the word ""light"" in the name."
"I will usually pass on a light beer but it came in the varity pack. Actually looks very good coming out of the bottle. Smell is a promising too, a little malty. Taste is an unmistakably that of a light beer with lots of water. Not much there kind of blah. That being said its tolerable. Much better than bud light and miller lite but I wouldnt choose it over the rest of the stuff in the Sam Adams Summer Style case."
"D- malty light beer, though it enjoyable there just really isn't a spot for this brew. If your convinced you need light beer stop here first (really doesn't taste much like a light brew)"
"As the folks at Sam Adams say, ""this is the best tasting lite beer on the market."" However, as many here know, the bar for taste in the lite beer market isn't that high. Indeed, at times it can be like running a foot race against first graders. That said, the beer pours nice, though as expected, the head on this thing isn't strong enough to defend itself against the slightest hint of oxygen. The taste is decent and easily better than any lite I have endured. When faced with a gut, I'd give it another pour."
"It is also very nice to look at in a glass when poured. It has a thick amber color that resembles most full bodies beers."
"A very drinkable beer, good job Jim Koch!"
"Cheers!"
"D - If you must drink light beers, then this is the way to go. But seriously, just drink regular SA. You won't get fat off the extra fifty or so calories and your mouth will thank you,"
"Overall: While I'm not a fan of the light beers any more, (ah youth) I do enjoy this one. One should note, though, that it is a light beer in name only. The color, ingredients, taste, and mouthfeel (not to mention calories I bet) are not typical of the style at all, which is in reality a good thing. I usually try to keep some of this around for my non-BA friends when they visit, and it tends to get good reviews. I'd recommend it to anyone, BA or non-BA. Like with most light beers you won't be offended, but at least this one has some taste to it."
"Sam Adams Light pours an orange color, much darker than most regular lagers and it has an off white head from a brown twelve ounce bottle. The aroma is mild and malty. Light, crisp and malty. Best light beer I've tasted, but I'm not sure how light it really is, most companies would consider this a darker lager."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: Very light bodied beer. 4% ABV lends itself well to drinkability. Overall, this is easily the best light beer on the market. I'm not a huge fan of light beers, but this is my preference out of the bunch. It really is a pretty good beer."
"M -"
"Don't drink and review."
"Other light beers don't even touch Sammy's Light and there's a reason it doesn't participate in Light Beer competitions. Jim Koch spent a lot of time developing such a great Light Beer and he definitely did it right."
"Drinkability: It's not an amazing lager, but it's much better than any other light beers, so if it's important for a beer to be light, this is the only choice. I like this quite a bit more than Boston Larger."
"this is one of my absolute favorite beers. Pours a nice amber hue with a decent head. Smell is like fresh bread, very malty with a slight hopiness. Taste is similar, very sweet maltiness with a breadish taste. The alcohol is hard to detect, which isn't too hard to believe considering its only 4% ABV. I could easily drink this beer on a hot summer day or a cold winter evening, all day long, i truly think its a great beer."
"Poured a pale yellow color with moderate white head. Smell is very light. Taste is also very faint overall. Beer doesn't have bad qualities about the beer, but little flavor that Sam Adams Lager has for a mass-market beer. A decent alternative if necessary"
"Clear, light amber in color. Head builds up to a nice size, but then fizzles out quickly. Light hops in aroma, definitely not enough. Taste is more substantial then in other light beers, but flavor is not there. It is light in taste, yet with some presence. I guess if there was nothing else, I wouldn't mind drinking it."
"Poured from a 12oz. bottle into my pint glass and appears a very rich clear amber color with a finger of tight, eggshell colored foam. Smells of honey, nuts and toasted malt. Tastes of sweet, toasty, bready malted grains, with a touch of nutiness. Excellent body for a light beer with medium carbonation. A fantastic light lager. I could session this forever and a day. The absolute mother of all light beers. Highly recommended."
"Overall impression: This seems to be a light beer in name only. Color, flavor, and everything else are in the range of a standard amber lager. Enjoyable - and maybe the name will get more people on to quality beer."
"I was surprised by this light beer from the Sam Adams company. It actually is not a bad light as others I have tatsed. It poured with good color and very minimal lacing (which is surprising) and malty nose. it had an almost clensing mouth feel and finished crisp. Not a bad beer to mow the lawn to as it does taste better than the mass produced light beer swill."
"D - I could drink a few of these, best light beer I have tasted."
"Poured this 12 oz longneck into a standard pint glass. Beer was light copper in color with a minimal head that quickly faded to a slight covering. There was lively carbonation rising to the surface throughout the life of this beer. The only aroma I detected was that of light grain. The initial taste of this beer was obstructed by the very high carbonation, but this quickly subsided, and a very delicate and pleasant grainy flavor came through. This was coupled with a slight caramel flavor, and if its really looked for, there is a slight bitterness to the finish. In the mouth, this beer is light-bodied and has high carbonation. It is highly drinkable and very refreshing, but if you are looking to experience the nice flavors of this beer, I wouldn't drink anything but water or swill before it. Overall, a very good light beer made with quality ingredients."
"Drinkability- Pretty good. I don't like light beers that much, but this one ALMOST tastes like beer. Let's face it. You can't make a silk purse out of a sow's ear."
"This beer poured a clear copper  golden color with a nice head which quickly left. The smell is malty but faint. The taste is sweet with some slight caramel characteristics. The mouthfeel is a bit thin. This is a very drinkable beer  probably the best light beer Ive encountered thus far."
"Very drinkable. Great to session."
"For the beer enthusiast, this is a good light lager to try. You're not going to get any outstanding characteristics or bursts of flavors, but you are going to get a relatively flavorful light lager that's made with 100% two-row barley malt, rather than adjuncts. I don't normally drink this style of beer, but if I did, this would be my choice."
"I understand what they are aiming for in this beer, and the reason I score it so low is because it is so highly carbonated that it almost hurts when it hits your tongue. It made it almost undrinkable to me. That and it still has that ""cheap beer"" feel regardless of being all-natural or whatever they claim. It looks nice in a glass though, at least for a light lager."
"This is a drinkable beer, but not a very compelling one. It is average or below average in almost every respect. Still it is very sessionable, and would be a good thirst quencher on a hot day."
"Overall, I just don't like this beer. Lack of hops and an unpleasant aftertaste pretty much finished this off for me. I had tried it some time ago and didn't like it, then decided to give it another go. Unfortunately, first impression was accurate."
"Nothing offensive about the beer, but little flavor."
"D- This beer is smooth and light but it has much more flavor than any other beer in this style that I have tasted."
"Sam Adams Light was a light amber color with an off-white head. The head was medium in size with decent retention. The aroma was light with some sweet malt, a little hops and a touch toasty. The taste was sweet malt with a hint hops and a dry finish. The body was medium-light with medium carbonation. Drinkabilty was good for a light beer. This is the best light beer I have tried so far."
"The bottle is very professional looking. nice and sleek, the bottle's graphics has changed since the picture on this site. Very appealing just as the bottle. Once poured, it's even more amazing. The first thought is ""this is a light beer??"" as it looks like a regular Sam Adams w/ a dark color, copper and carbonated w/ a nice head that fades quickly, mild lacing. Smell is average, I'm actually not picking up a lot from it. Taste is not as much as I had hoped, maybe the appearance got me excited. I am picking up some corn type of flavors. Maybe a slight sweetness in there as well. Mouthfeel is nothing special, some carbonation, thats it. It's ok, one of the better light beers, but still not great. I would bring this to a get together of non-appreciative beer drinkers, those that wouldn't appeal to some of the better beers out there."
"Notes: Although this won't make it to my fridge to often, I won't turn a nose to this well brewed beer. If I want something on the lighter side a good German pils will do it for me every time but Sam Adams is usually more available and a decent tasting brew."
"D- This is a fine light lager. Nothing comes close in the category. Not lawnmower type but good for a night out with many brews. I would reach for a lighter style first if that's what I wanted like a kolsch or helles but this will work."
"Drinkability: I'd take this light beer over others I imagine, but at the same time, why not just have a regular Sam Adams lager? More hops, more body, more taste, and probably not a lot more calories a bottle."
"Another brew with a ton of reviews. My 2 cents - great for the summer at a restaurant eating outside. This tasting was in an indoor event and it involved multiple appetizers crossing quite a few taste spectrums. Good choice for the evening but not one that pick up for enjoyment during the week."
"Overall, good for a ""light"" beer. I always think ""light"" as the body of the beer, so I'm not sure if thats what Boston Beer was going for or the whole calorie thing. Either way, I am never in the mood for anything called light but I would pick this up for guests who I know would rather have something along these lines."
"Scores reflective of light beer style."
"Amber in color with a very thin light tan head. Smells hoppy with some malt. Tastes somewhat sweet with some hops too. Slight hints of roast. Not too strong in flavor, but by far the most flavorful low calorie beer I've ever had. Light medium body. In the right situation, I can see myself having this. It's a decent beer."
"If seeking giant flavor and a healthy dose of hops, then stay clear of light beer. If your plan is to consume, a lot fairly soon, then this is for you."
"Real good for a light beer and no adjuncts either which is a huge plus. Suprisingly only 10-20 more calories than most of the others...not that I care."
"Cheers to SA for once again a great light beer, most likely the best!"
"This is far and away the best american macro light out there. A: Deep golden with a nice level of carbonation and head esp. for a light beer S: Light maltiness, with some very mild citrus hints and a touch of hopped bitterness all on the mild side. T: Very close to the aroma with understated flavors of what the nose hints at. More body than you would expect from a light lager without being filling M: Good viscosity with enough feel to coat one's mouth without affecting the drinkability which is very good. To put it simply, this is a beer drinker's light beer with enough taste to satisfy without resorting to levels of heaviness that would exclude it from being classified a light lager. Another nicely done product from Sam A."
"Okay, I don't often imbibe in ""light"" beers, but I wanted to see how Sam Adams stacks up. Pours a nice golden color...darker and richer than it's macro cousins. Huge, fluffy white head and a lot of lacing in the pint glass. Nose is quite malty...but wait, Ido smell some hops in here, I believe. Palate is definitely on the light side, but not completely tasteless. Malty and easy going, with just enough hop character to keep it interesting. Mouthfeel is light and the finish, dry. A light beer that actually has a flavor profile, albeit slight. Definitely beats the macro competition in the light lager category."
"Notes- light beers are not my thing; and honestly this beer borders on whether it is actually a light beer. However, none of the awful chemical adjucts that are added to lights are present in this beer. So one has to say this is the standard of what semi light beers should aspire too."
"In the world of light beers, this is a good one. It drinks like a decent brew, but with fewer calories, if you are intersted in that sort of thing. It pours clean with a foamy just off white head. The taste is straight forward, a little malt, a decent amount of hops, but basically a watered down experience. If you are looking to go light, this is a great choice. If you're looking for refreshing beer, you could do a lot worse."
"Pours a clear amber color with a white creamy head that quickly forms into a thin lace. This is a light beer? Amazing, this is the darkest light beer I have ever seen. Aroma is malty with a slight amount of hops as well. Taste is much like the smell in that it is malty with a mild hop flavor. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy. Decent brew but excellent light lager. Good job by Boston Beer Company in making such a good light beer. At 4% abv this would make a decent session beer."
"The darkest, tastiest, heaviest Light beer that I have ever had. Great stuff from SamAs and a beer that could well push boundaries and open up new frontiers for many a fledgling craft beer drinker; it has to be applauded for that alone. Well crafted and cleverly constructed."
"Overall, a pretty decent beer, for a light lager. Still, this is not a stand-alone brew: it goes great with food."
"Unbelievable light beer. This beer is in a class of its own. Sets the bar for all other light beers. Light copper color with a white head. Good hoppy aroma, sweet maltiness, and traces of wheat and corn. Taste is outstanding considering it is a light beer. Nice carbonation, with a nice crisp finish. Good body. Very drinkable. Every other beer maker is now playing catch up with this beer."
"I don't understand how this beer gets a ""not recommended"" status and a low average rating when it is obviously one of the best light lagers in the world. I don't think people take any account for style which is too bad since this beer deserves a bit more respect."
"Perfectly clear and amber in color. Minimal white head over the brew. The rich hop smell is slightly sweet. Flavors are slightly sour but incredibly smooth. Settles onto the tongue with plenty of character. Finish is smooth with only a mild aftertaste."
"Eric"
"If light beers are your thing, this is one of the better ones. Give it a shot."
"Certainly one of the best light beers on the market that I've tried. If you're trying to cut down on the calories, this is definitely a viable option rather than cutting out beer completely."
"D - Good drinkability. Far cry above normal domestic light lager. Pretty decent other than that one off flavor.."
"What can you say? It is, afterall, a LIGHT beer. When the finest brewers in the universe attempt to make something LIGHT it's gonna get screwed up. BUT - if light is what you want then this is one of the very few (2) that is worth a drink...If taste is what you want don't drink LIGHT."
"A fine balanced Light Lager you have here. For me a pleasant surprise on the flavor of this light lager!"
"Overall it is the best light beer that I have ever encountered. Unfortunately that isn't saying a whole lot."
"One of the better light beers I've had -- it has flavor and body. Could definitely drink a lot of these with ease if it weren't for this inexplicable and indescribable nasty smell and taste. When you start, usually it's fine but with some sips it's a bit nasty. But then every sip begins to have this nasty aftertaste. I'd probably ignore this one unless someone offered it to me for free. Basically, if you really want a light beer, try this one. Otherwise, no need to bother..."
"Goldish color with a thin head, which fizzled out quickly. If there is anything bad about this light beer it is the smell, it is quite repulsive. Luckily, it tastes much better and can be very refreshing. It is best served very cold and is a great beer to drink while watching a baseball game. When I settle down for the Met's game, this is a perfect partner."
"Drinkability - since it is a light beer, you can drink more, right?"
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Though the carbonation is certainly more than adequate, it is borderline aggressive... the bubbles are knife-edged and sharp texturally. But more is better with this beer, and I enjoy the light but full mouthfeel. A bit gassy in the stomach, and after one I'm not thinking about following it up with another."
"Overall, a decent beer, and a very good light beer. Not one I would get often though- much rather get the lager."
"This is not bad for a light beer. Had one at the Norfolk Tides game at Harbor Park. Nice copper color, a fairly good head, good lacing in the plastic cup. Decent smell and taste not too far off from Traditional Lager. The mouthfeel was a bit weak and watery. Given the choice, I prefer the higher calorie version but this would make a good session beer. No bad aftertaste or anything that I would find annoying over an evening."
"This is a drinkable beer. However, since in terms of calories it isn't really a light beer, I really would not opt for this beer again. For 40 more calories I'd go for the Boston Lager."
"This is a very good light beer. It truly is a lighter version of Sam Adams Boston Lager, in the way it drinks and tastes. There is a nice caramelly maltiness with a little hop bite. The body is thin, but it is decently full-bodied for a light beer. While I could drink this beer all night, the thiness gets tiresome, the metallic after taste starts to catch up."
"Overall this beer is excellent especialy for a light beer. I rated other beers that aren't as good as this higher. I thnk for what this is going for, I believe a vienna lager type beer, it could do a little bit better. But then again, it is a light beer."
""
"Goes down pretty easy."
"Overall: Avoid it and drink the original."
"Appearance is light copper amber hued with a nicely formed off white foam head leaves even lacing down my pint. Aroma contains a touch of caramel in the malts with herbal hops showing up in the scent as well. Taste has a smooth mild sweetness, touch of caramel toasty nut from the the specialty malts finishes mildly bitter with herbal hops. Mouthfeel is lighter bodied evenly carbonated not watery but light. Drinkability is very smooth and refreshing with ample flavor one of the best tasting light beers available in the US market."
"Good for a light beer but not good for a beer. Pours a very clear amber with a small white head. Aromas are mostly of grains, with minimal hops. The taste is quite sweet up front, and that sweetness lingers in spite of the emergence of more malt notes. There's a slight bitter snap combined with some fizzy carbonation, but nothing terribly tasty or interesting. As expected, this is a very mild beer -- slight flavor, light-medium body, pretty drinkable. But this beer is actually pretty caloric... why not absorb a few more calories, drink one less beer over an evening, and get something that has more taste. Forget Sam Light... get a real beer."
"darker and fuller bodied than a regular light beer. more tastey than the regular light beer. easier to drink than a regular light beer. why? because its not really a light beer. i guess the light means its lighter in alc. because as far as calories go is in the same ballpark as regular brews. but for what it is, its clean, suprisingly malty, balanced and def. a solid brew. a great bbq/summer beer."
"D- Shit yeah, I'll drink this again."
"Excellent light beer. Can Sam Adams do any wrong? (Well, yes...see my review for their Cranberry Lambic). Sam Adams light is average in appearance & smell -- pours a light amber color, with a nice hint of malt in the smell. For a light beer, the taste is surprising. It has a bit of a kick, with a nice mixture of malt and hops. With a mild but still prominent carbonation, SA Light is easy to drink and makes an excellent session beer. For my money, this is definitely the best commonplace choice out there for a light beer."
"Extremely high drinkability due to it being a great tasting light beer. Good choice for a light beer overall."
"Very drinkable if you want to drink a lot."
"Conclusion- Ok, its not a bad beer, I didn't hate it. But I'm not really that concerned about beer as a source of calories anyway. I don't drink enough where it really matters, and like I already said this isn't very low in calories for a light beer anyway. And while it tastes ok, there are a lot of beers I'd rather drink (regular Sam included), so its probably going to be a while before I have another of these. I mean if someone just handed me one I'd drink it and be glad, but I could say that of an MGD as well."
"This beer pours an orange copper color with a slight tan creamy head. Smells of oat malt, honey, lime and banana. Tastes like Is this a light beer? Wow! Oat and barley malt with a nice nip of hops, smooth burnt caramel and a buttery, sour citrus finish. The mouth feel is medium-light with lots of carbonation. I seriously have trouble believing that this is a light beer."
" An interesting experiment but not really too enlightening. It hasn't raised my opinion of light beers too much. I can drink it without hating myself but I still wouldn't choose it over regular Sam's or any other half decent beer."
"Overall...don't waste your money..buy MGD Light if you want a nice light lager with a decent taste, aroma and mouthfeel. Why do they go on TV with commercials about this being a ""new era"" light beer when it's lame???? ""Years of testing""...my ass. I guess they think John Q. Public is an idiot. Are we???"
"Drinkability - This is where it stands out. This tastes so good that I would take it over any other light beer I want. I could easily down this, and will probably do so next gathering I'm at."
"The key thing to remember here is that this is a light beer so one must take it for what it is. It pours out a slightly golden color with hints of brown. A decent head can be created but it does not hold to well. The smell however might be the best part of the beer. There is a good smell of hops and sweetness that is quite refreshing. The taste however is not as full as the smell. It is a little watery but you do get the taste of hops that far surpasses other light beers. It feels a little watery in your mouth and it could use a little more carbonation. Overall it is a very drinkable beer. I would much rather take this on a hot summer day over any other light beer"
"was at a friends house for dinner they are not beer drinkers per say (they like light beers) so I was surprised when he asked if I wanted a sam adams. brings it out and it was a light, didnt want to offend him, I took the bottle poured into my glass, had to do a double take, this cant be light I thought to myself color is all wrong but the bottle dont lie.( piston Fans). poured a light brown with biege head. aroma caramel, hops, malts a hint of floral. flavor it did have some not alot got malts and hops with a touch of caramel. for a light this was pretty good"
"Recommended by my brother, the homebrewer and fan of somewhat decent beer. I must disagree. Pours a golden/amber hue with almost no head. Nose is nice and hints of good things to come - some roasted light malt and a touch of hops. Flavor is that of a very weak McMicro amber ale. A thin body holds a palate of some subtle roasted malt, just the beginning of a floral hop profile, and not much else. I'll say this - you could drink it all day long. If faced with a choice between this and Bud Light, Sam Adams is the winner. Otherwise, I wouldn't seek it out."
"Disappointing. I expected better from Sam Adams."
"Considering the lack of satisfaction, I felt bloated."
"12 oz. with purchase by Nov. notched on the side. Pours a clear amber with a fizzy 1 finger head. Smells of caramel/toasted malts, metal, and a touch of hops. On the palate it's molasses, caramel, other darker malts, and some citric hops with a thin to medium body. The blurb on the back says they spent 2 years and made 23 recipes to get the final version. Maybe mine was a bad bottle but I don't think they got it quite right as it seemed a bit off."
"Okay, so some say it's really not a bad beer. I say it's not good either. It has a bit more flavor and color than your typical AMerican macro, but not much. Corporate beer, and that's all she wrote."
"It makes for a nice light lager, unless you interpret light beer as being much less in calories...it really isn't, so this beer should have good flavors, albeit on the light flavored side. A clean and crisp aroma brings out light malt and bread sweetness without being grainy or vegital. Looks a bit over carbonated, but with a nice light straw color and crystal clear. Little lacing and head retention, but nothing to brag about. Flavors, again, are clean and crisp with light malt sweetness and mild bread-like flavors. Yeastiness comes through a bit. Body is short of light, but pleasant with a mild creaminess and bit too much fizz. Finishes very crisp with a little residual malty sweetness. Never bitter or bite-ey. A good beer to chase a slice of pizza down."
"Sam Adams Light, with three fewer letters than the regular Samuel Adams. This brew pours an amazing clear golden-amber color. Not amazing in that it appears to be a huge overpowering brew, but amazing for the style it is. The head is small and white, but lingers around forever, leaving nice lacing. The aroma is matly with hints of caramel. It is very aromatic for a light lager. The taste is kind of a let down. It is still better than every other light lager I have had, but still too light for my likings. The mouthfeel is a light bodied with ample carbonation. Overall, this is a damr good light beer, but a mediocre beer in general. Still, hats off to the folks at BBC for pioneering a decent tasting light beer."
"This beer is an amber color with an off-white foamy head. Plenty of carbonation in this beer. Aroma of light malt. Taste has a good malt character, but is a little watery, as might be expected. Mouthfeel is light, but not as bad as most other beers. I'd have to say this is probably the best light beer, but then again, I can't say for sure since I don't usually drink light beer."
"Bottle was one of many provided to me for volunteering for the 2005 GABF. Thanks much. Drink before Feb 2006. Pours a half finger dirty white head over a crystal clear light rust liquid. Looks good. Smells very mild. Malt sweet is caramel and biscuity and I get no hops. Taste is thin light malty with anice hop floral that rises in the aftertaste. Honey-like, which I think of as Hallertauer. Malts are gently swet and a hint of caramel Mild, but sharp carbonation on my taste buds. Light body, but overall this beer is well done for the style."
"I consumed this a few hours after playing some basketball. With it, I ate a some ""premium"" nuts (what else to go with a premium light beer?), i.e. macadamias, hazelnuts, pecans, brazil nuts, and almonds. The beer is dark for a ""light"" beer--almost on the coppery side of golden. Aroma reminded me of keg parties that serve cheap beer, meaning it smelled slightly corny--just like any other light beer. No hops were discernable in the taste or smell, but there was a nice malt flavor with a tiny bit of caramel. It went well with the nuts and made for a nice post-exercise snack. Very drinkable--It was gone before I knew it."
"I always avoid light beers, horrible flavor and not worth wasting my money, would rather drink water, but I heard good things about this one so I gave it a try. Right out of the bottle I know this is something special--doesn't look at all like the pale fizzy yellow drinks the other people at the bar are drinking---this is a nice caramel orange with a finger of foamy white head, and some good lacing evident right away. Nose was faint, a grainy malt with a subtle spicy hoppiness. Taste is a very nice clean malt, slight caramel flavor, and a crisp hop finish. Very nice, very assertive flavor for a light beer, better tasting than most macros, let alone lights. Mouthfeel is obviously a little thin, but there's a nice carbonation level and this is a crisp refreshing beer. Sam Adams really does it again, making an amazing light beer. The bottle label says ""tastes unlike any light beer"" and that couldn't be more true. I'll be looking for this in the future in lieus of BMC crap."
"The color made me wonder if this really was a light beer, but the nose lacked in depth. My eyes fooled my tastebuds, because at first sip, I was surprised at the watered down quality of the beer. As light beers go, it IS the best I have tasted. However, I unfortunately do not quite enjoy this class of beer."
"Pours a nice gold color with a fizzy white head that dissipates quickly. Smell is mostly sweet malt with also a few hops in the background. Taste is very light and sweet with some spicy hops in the finish. Mouthfeel is a little watery but hey, this is a light beer after all. Very easily to drink. Probably the best light beer I've had, and I like it better than a lot of the normal macros."
"Taste is mainly malt with a bit of hops at the finish. Not as good as it's big brother, Sam Adams Boston Lager, but possibly the best light beer around and better than some ""regular"" lagers. If you have to have ""light"" beer, this should be first choice."
"Nice dark amber color with a full head and nice lacing.By looking at this you wouldn't think this was a light.The smell is pretty strong,full of a hop spice aroma.This looks better than it tastes,but it is a light beer,and may be the best american light beer.I don't drink light beers,but if I did I would reach for this.This is the tops for a light."
"Drinkability: Probably the most impressive mass-produced, bottled light beer Ive had. Very good body for a light beer. Refreshing, with enough character to keep a more seasoned palate happy."
"Pours amber gold, fairly clear with a one and a half finger head. Lacing and retention are good for a light lager. The smell is sweet, apple esters and traces of grain, similiar to watered down malt liquor. The supposed two row malt and 100% noble hops only become detectable in the taste, which is semi-sweet, with a pleasent drying hops. Light to medium in body, low carbonated, and finishes clean. This is a smooth and drinkable beer with good taste, but not the best example of a light lager."
"Body is thin. Drinkable? Yup. Would I buy it again. Only as part of a mixed 12 pack like I got it this time."
"I had never been a big Sam Adams Lager drinker. I've enjoyed most of the seasonals over the years and I do enjoy a couple of the Brewmaster Collection six's like the Hefe and the Pale; but when the Boston Beer Co came out with Sam Adams Light, I was hooked. A rich, malty taste with a slight bitter tinge on the finish, this is a great beer! I use a pint glass (from the overly enourmous collection in my bar) and relish in the nice head and excellent amber hue. After the first few, I admit....I do sometimes switch over and drink the next few from the bottle. You don't get to smell it too much from the bottle, but hey you just smelled the the last three you drank...enjoy!"
"As a drinkable beer, I need more complexity. As a light beer, this has to be one of the best. A very well made beer, and I would be willing to bet, not real well received among the light beer crowd. It has way too much going on for the beertards to enjoy. I like it!"
"The beer is drinkable for what it is: a light lager. Certainly more so than any other light beer I've had in the style. This is probably my favorite light beer but it still falls short in taste and body from what I like in a beer. It looks the part, but falls short on the taste. Within the style, however, there are few that are better."
"Drinkability: Well it ought to be drinkable. It is easily drank, but not good enough to want to over and over."
"12oz bottle. Pours a very light copper with a fluffy white head, leaves a bubbly lacing down my glass. Aroma is light caramel malts, slight hint of coppery pennies, breakfast cereal. Flavor is mildly citric with an accent on orange, sweet caramel malt, peppery finish. Light to medium body with more carbonation than I would like. For a light beer, this has alot of character and is more interesting than any other offering I have tried with the same prefix."
"Comments - Given that this is a light beer, it is not too bad. Worth a try."
"Light eh? Couldnt tell from the pour  good lookin shade of amber with an ivory head. Had some actual malt aroma followed up with a tasty quaff. Nice to have a *light* brew made from 100% malt and hops. Very drinkable in the summer heat  I just dont know how often I would buy it, too many even tastier treats out there. But for a *light* brew, top notch !!"
"What the hell else could ask for in a light beer?"
"It is a very nice golden colored beer. However, it has absolutely no head no matter how I pour it. This is the only beer my Dad buys, so it's what I drink when I go over to his place. Never ever could smell anything. It seems to have very little body or mouthfeel - to me it is like drinking water. It is refreshing when nothing else is around and it is better than Miller or Budweiser, but that isn't saying much. For a light beer this is good."
"As light beers go, this is a pretty good beer. Pours a deep golden color with a minimal head. Aroma is mostly malt with a slight metallic tinge. Not aggressively carbonated. Taste is smooth, crisp, malty with a hint of hoppiness. I don't normally buy light beers, but on a hot, humid day, this beer does indeed hit the spot. Heads and tails above the macro lights."
"12oz. bottle that I got in the 12 pack sampler. This is the only way I would buy a light beer. Poured a light golden amber color with little foam that faded away very fast after you poured it. There was not much of a smell, except for the faint smell of malt. The only taste this beer had, was a watered down malt taste. It was a little better than other light beers. The mouthfeel was light, carbonated and watery. This is a good light beer compared to other macro light beers. I think they took a good beer and watered the hell out of it."
"Bought this beer in a summer variety pack. I guess even though they call it a ""light beer"" it really is not even light. The appearance is a nice orange, nice mild aroma. I like the taste and could drink a few of these in a sitting, but would probably apt for something else. The light in the name is deceptive it is not really a light beer."
"I like many of Sam Adams beers... this, however is not one of them. Presented itself quite well, with a decent darker golden color with a head that was respectable. Odors of malt and hops were present, as was an odd earthy scent that I was not familiar with. Smelled like sulfur went on a date with pinesap, and this was the bastard child. Odd lingering smell. Taste was by far a let down. I've had macros with more palatable flavor. Notes of hops were detected, but it totally lacked any complexity once so ever ( this is a light beer, so I had low expectations, but this brew didn't even meet those). Finished with a touch of malt on the aftertaste and notes of corn. I'd drink it again, but I certainly wouldn't be excited about it. Worth a try."
"Overall, pretty decent for a ""light"" beer. Ide much rather have this then bud light or something, but i wont seek this out in the future. Simply put, its the best of the worst (style)."
"Carbonation is a tad too prickly but the body is the right lightness for the style. This is definitely my favorite light beer, and if I ever feel like going on a diet, I'll turn to Sam Adams."
"Overall-a terrific light lager, to me it's a dubbed down Sam Adams but to any light beer drinker it should be heaven. Sam Adams' normal lager is great, and so is the light and if we are reviewing the beers to style as we should be this is tops. Great job!!"
"In my experience so far, Sam Adams Light is the king of light lagers. Why? (1) You can taste it, (2) it tastes good and (3) there are indications that this is indeed a beer, i.e. malt and hops not corn and rice. While it's probably best to man up and drink a real beer, if you gotta go light try this."
"This brew pours dull golden amber color with a fair sized white head that actually has some retention and lacing. Malt like aroma characteristics dominate the brew, slight roast like scent. The taste is similar to the aroma, with a nice malt character that lends itself to a sweet like taste. Has an ever so slight hop finish that actually balances this brew nicely. Over all this is a good brew, one that I would get out when hanging with friends that are macro drinkers. Also I have gotten this brew when I have looked to cut down on the calorie intake. It does not taste or have the character of normal light beer; this one is a good brew."
"Overall: The best American version of the light lagers out there. Yet another quality product for Sam Adams. A whole other level of complexity above the likes of Bud Select and Ultra."
"Pours an amber color with a nice 2 inch head that leaves no lacing. Nose is of spices and malts. Taste is malty with a hint of cereal and with a funny aftertaste initially. Mouthfeel has adequate fullness but it is not overly lively on the palate. Overall drinkability is OK, pretty good for a light beer. If I have to drink a light beer in the future this will definitely be the one to have."
"Mouthfeel is borderline medium bodied with much more maltiness than standard light lagers. This makes a good lawnmowing beer...which I am about to go do. Not something I'd ever pick up as ""light"" beer is pointless to me. However it was nice enough to try out of the mixed 12 pack."
"Well, after seeing the new commercials and hearing how this beer won an award in D-land, I ordered one bottle recently at 'bones. Clear copper after I poured it into my galss, I got my light white head, but I looked away for a second and it was gone, leaving just a thin film on top. There was no to low aroma. Medium mouthfeel. Tastewise, I got medium grainyness, some breadiness, and some citrus in the finish."
"Pours a rusty bronze color with almost no head and very little visible carbonation. Compared to its light lager peers, this beer has plenty more color and potential. Although faint in the nose, I notice some good malt scents, but not much more. For being a light beer, it really does taste pretty darned good. It has an initial sweet hop flavor and washes away very cleanly. Quite refreshing, and I must admit one of the best tasting light beers I've had in a long time. The mouthfeel is good, I think I'm detecting more carbonation from my palate than I do my eyes. Overall, this is a good beer, and an outstanding light beer."
"Note: The ratings I gave this one may appear a little out of sync with my written review. This is because for the ratings I decided to judge to beer relative to its style, and for the written review I simply gave a more objective assessment."
"Pours an amber color at 45 degrees from my fridge to my tulip glass. The head that is there quickly dissipates to nothing except a slight edge layer. Clean brew though. Aroma is of sweet brown malts and a slightly wheat aroma that comes through along with some sort of berry or fruit (plums maybe or something else)...also some sugary sweetness pops through along with the fruit. Light watery brown malts are on display here on the sip. Some light hops pop through as well, but nothing to note really. Sweet caramel and fruit comes through as well for a nice crisp refreshing flavor, and a grainy finish. Lots of carbonation takes this one over with a very watery finish. Overall, it doesn't sound like it, but I like this light brew. It is probably the best tasting light beer brewed from what I can tell...I can drink 100 of them I bet!!! haha"
"Thanks to clvand0 for sharing this with me. The beer pours a brilliant copper color with a finger of head over top that falls to coat the beer. The nose is slightly caramel and slightly grainey. Not bad. The flavor is actually rather robust, with the sweet caramel and slight butteryness being very prominent. The feel is a light moderate, with a very tight carbonation. Overall, this could easily be passed for a regular lager from any number of brewpubs that I have visited. Its very clean, rather full flavored and quite refreshing. Not your typical light beer here folks."
"It appears amber. No foam or lace, etc. It is quite tasty for a light beer. Problem is -it ain't too light. I think the amber color gives the nose a slight marzen-like essence. Nothing special. If I have to drink a light beer, this is probably a pretty good choice. Mouthfeel is nothing. Drinkability is high. These things are low ABV, you can have a few."
"Two of these came in a holiday 12-pack, so I feel compelled to at least try it. Actually, I put it in the fridge to get it out of the floor, then I drank it just to make room in the fridge. Pours an amber color with a moderate head and leaves very little lacing on the glass. The aroma is mild, but there is a bit of maltiness and graininess with a little of noble hops. The flavor was very weak, as I expected. Not much flavor there. Much more flavor than your standard light beer though, so I have to give them some credit. Hints of malt and a crisp finish. Not too bad for a light beer."
"Wait a minute I thought the bottle said light beer. This beer pretty dark for a light beer. The appearance is a clear amber color with a sticky lace for a head. Smells earthy with some malty grain and noble hops. The mouthfeel is very clean and light. The two row malts dominate the flovor but is balanced out by the hop flavor. Very easy to drink. To sum this beer up; There is nothing complex to this beer. It taste very clean. Sam Adams seems to use quality ingredients for the beer. Hence, the two-row malts and noble hops. Sam Adams light does not remind of a light lager. More like an average American amber lager. A step above Yuengling, but not quite a Boston lager."
"Light body(which I imagine was what they were aiming for, but definately not for me)"
"I think I could drink this again and I wouldn't be ashamed to serve it to others. Not the first beer I would grab but certainly not one I'd turn away."
"Wowzzzer. Actually half decent for a light beer. Not quite unlike the regular Sam lager, but certainly not the same beast. Lighter, yes, so much lighter... Did I mention that I do not enjoy light beers? No? Well I don't. This one is better than most though, thus the high ratings. Perhaps too high of ratings, but I go by style."
"I have always been a big Sam Adams fan but this Light Beer did not really hit the spot for me. It has a different flavor, and it just does not sit well with me, give me the calories and the flavor :) I am generally not a Light Beer drinker but I got this in a Variety pack so I of course tried it. It is a decent beer, and if calories are more important than flavor here is a good choice for you."
"This is a light-to-medium body beer. It doesn't have overt bitterness. It's very drinkable - something of a ""session beer"" as a result. I think this beer is fine, despite the general bias against light lagers on BA - it's certainly better than most I've had."
"If the legal definition of ""light"" is 1/3 less calories than a brewer's regular beer, Sam's 120+ cals may be joined by 150, 160 calorie ""light"" craft beers in the future!"
"This is basically a thinner version of the Boston Lager. The same general grain and hops tastes are there, they're just a little weaker. The appearance is the same, except the color is a touch lighter and the head isn't quite as thick. As a light beer, it's great. A dumbed-down Samuel Adams is still better than the full versions of Budweiser, MGD, Coors and most other macrobrews. Still, there really isn't a reason to get this instead of the full Boston Lager."
"12 ounce bottle. Pours a clear, light amber with little head. The aroma is grain with a little hops. The taste is a thin malt flavor with some hops in the finish. The mouthfeel is not as weak and watery as most light beers, but still not impressive. Nice drinkability because it's crisp and refreshing,and there are no unpleasant flavors. Not bad for the style, but the style is not a very interesting one."
"Pours out an light amber color with a quickly dissipating 1 finger head.Smells grainy nothing special.Taste is ok for a light beer,malt and hops are barely evident though.Very thin feel no body to it.Drinkability is good, id rather have a few of these compared to the other light beers im stuck with at local bars."
"Came in the Holiday Sampler pack. It's not bad, yet not great. It has a crisp dryness that I do like. Pours a nice golden with a fluffy head. Not much going on in the aroma department. Taste is nice, a crispness, and a slight malt flavor. It's not bad, but not good.. it's just average."
"Single 12oz from my Sam Adams Holiday Pack. This beer pours out an almost perfect shade of amber, like youd see a mosquito trapped in on TV. Not much of a head, even when getting aggressive with the pour. The small one that does appear fades rapidly into a thin film on top. Suprisingly (it being a light beer and all) I catch a whiff of a nice aroma with the glass still several feet away from my head. Closer inspection of the nose reveals the malts with aromas of dry toast and hints of toffee with a nice little bitter hop crusting. The taste is initially husky, with a slight allusion to toffee, I think I detect a small unfortunate trace of veggie. It finishes very slick and clean with a somewhat robust, yet vague bitterness. The mouthfeel is very light, which would be appealing to some people and is not misplaced. I will say for its style this is probably among the cream of the crop, and is more flavorful than the full-bodied version of some brewers product. A great beer to suck down while youre cooking your meal and preparing to drink some beer that will demand more of your attention."
"Very similar to the Boston Lager: if you like the flagship of the Sam Adams line, you'll probably like this. Vastly better than any of the mass-produced lights out there, but still it lacks good beery character."
"I really don't think this is a light beer, maybe only in comparison to SA's Boston Lager. The color is entirely too dark for a light beer, and the aroma actually contains malt smell. Taste is initially full and grainy, with a nice lightly malty finish. Thankfully no hint of adjunct tastes are present. This is a very easy-to-drink beer that blows anything else labeled ""light"" out of the water. I would pick this up when I just want a ""easy"" beer to kick back with."
"From the winter sampler pack, because when I think of winter, I think light beer. Pours a golden orange with minimal (ie no) head. Nose is of sweet malt with little or no hop aroma. Nothing too amazing here but at least I could smell something! Taste is like a Boston lager only without the hops and a small addition of malt. Finishes sweet. Watery mouthfeel. For me it's not too pleasurable to drink. But if for some reason I could only drink beer with ""light"" on the label this would probably be it."
"Pleasantly malty & biscuity. Straight forward & clean, ending dry with some grassy / herbal hop flavours. Light bodied, prickly carbonation. A light beer that actually tastes like something."
"Darker golden color, good sized white foam head on the top. Weak grain malt scent, not very appealing. Tastes like watery cherios with a slight hint of hops. Thin mouth. Drink the two that come with your holiday sampler and then go for the keystone light if you want a light beer. Yuck."
"The aroma is much like an American macro-vinegary smell that comes from the addition of adjucts. The taste is a little better, but there is not much there. Kind of watered down with very little malt or hop taste. This is much better than any other light I have tasted, but, I stick to the real thing."
"Pours out a very light copper with a tiny little head that almost instantly disappears. Very clear appearance. Weak aroma that faintly reminds of Boston Lager if you concentrate extremely hard. Otherwise, not much there. Taste is pretty typical of the style - overcarbonated, riddled with adjunct off-flavors, and not particularly good. However, to compare this against others in the style, it is actually a bright point. The slightly higher than average score I've awarded this offering is to mark that it is slightly better than the average BMC Light. That said, this is definitely in the same class as a BMC Light... Mouthfeel is thin and overcarbonated. Drinkability is comparable with that of other offerings in the style. This is not a beer I consider ""good"" in any way, but when compared against other offerings in the style, its not terrible. I'd say it might make a bridge with the macro crowd to hopefully eventually open someone up to the world of better beer. This however would have to be the very first step, and a long road would be ahead before anyone tried a truly class-act!"
"A unique take on a light beer after the cliche marco light offering. If I was faced with only light beers as an option, I would go with the Sam Adams Light. Not the most flavorful beer, but the malt profile in this beer is re assuring."
"(Received as part of the current holiday 12-pack. I probably wouldn't have found myself with one, otherwise.)"
"Judging this beer solely as a light lager... WOW! This would give a lot of ""full"" lagers a run for their money. It has a malty backbone and decent hop character. I have never had a light beer that I have liked, including the much loved Amstel. I am not a light beer drinker, but if I was this would be my beer."
"-Oelergud"
"Pours golden-amber with a large white head. This lacks the hoppy aroma of Boston Lager, there is a little hop aroma in there, but not much. Taste is not bad, really. Much like a watered-down SA Boston Lager (surprise!) Malt and grain flavors up front, a little hop bitterness on the finish (very little!) Mouthfeel is light-beer watery. This is probably a better choice than any other Light beer, and also better than many non-light macros! I'd drink it over a Bud or Coors any day!"
"Ho-hum, another light beer. Who came up with that idea, anyhow? Like some of the other reviewers, I got this beer as part of the Winter Classics collection, and I wish Boston Beer would drop this and the Cranberry Lambic from the group, and give us four sixpacks of the remaining brews. Sam Adams Light is drinkable, but nothing to write home about. Honey-orange color; light, frothy head that dies in 30 seconds. Smells faintly ""cardboardy"". Taste is bland, neither hoppy nor malty. Leaves a slightly greasy aftertaste. Not awful, but I wouldn't buy it on its own merits."
"Pours a not-so-light amber color. Smells like a macro (corn I believe). Tastes not at all like your daddy's light beer swill. It's actually not that bad, surprisingly. This might be a good choice for those buds who refuse to drink anything other than Coors Light."
"I'm not a light beer drinker but I could see this as being more drinkable than the watered down, tasteless Macro lights anyday. For a light beer, Sam Adams has managed to pull off a decent entry to the market and I may consider it if I can't find a decent Kolsch during the hot summer months."
"Overall- not a very good beer. Too sweet! I could drink it if I HAD too but I would never purchase this beer!"
"This is not discernibly better than many a macro version."
"Sam Adams Light reminds me why I don't drink light beer. It doesn't have enough 'beerness' to capture my fancy and, besides, diet beer just strikes me as wrong. Acceptable if no real beer is available."
"Char"
"Mouth and Drinkability also average."
"Smell of malt with a hint of hops. Taste is good, as light beers go. Its a light version af Sam Adams Boston lager. A bit less hoppier and not as heavy. Clean, clear and refreshing. A great summer beer. I always keep some in my fridge during the warm months. It is very easy drinking and leaves a nice aftertaste. As light beers go this is the best I have had, but I have not had that many."
"Just as it was meant to be, just a lighter version of SA Boston Lager. The smell is crisp and malty. Taste is slightly sweet, yet 'light'. Its a little bit weaker and easier to drink. I get a six pack every now and then meaning its a little above average."
"Off white head settling over clear and gently carbonated light amber liquid. Light sweet malt nose with grassy elements within, I can't detect any hop whatsoever. Smooth weak maltiness, somewhat watery taste going on. Finishes bland and without much character...thank God I don't have to drink this on a regular basis. It is what is is...light."
"Final Thought: It's damn good from a light beer standpoint, but it's pretty average from a beer standpoint!"
"Weirdly, compared to other lights, this isn't quite as drinkable since it has the malty taste. Still, if someone had this or macros in the fridge I'd could drink them for a night."
"Like Sam Adams non-light, it pours well out of the bottle with not too much head. The light amber color is a good sign that it is different than most light beers and had some body in its aroma. The taste comes close to what the brewer is trying to imitate but something is missing. It doesn't quite have the character I want in a beer. While not bad for a beer and quite good for a light beer, it didn't do anything to make me declare it a beer that will make it into my regular purchases. After finishing off the six-pack, I didn't anticipate buying it again on my next trip to the store."
"drinkers should just be thankfull for watery domestics. I mean, honestly, I don't know very many light beer drinkers who give two shits about taste."
"This was better than most light beers I have tried."
"As far as light beers go, this is pretty good, but I don't see the point, other than marketing. Give me regular Sam Adams anyday."
"Well yeah, it's a light. It came in the brewmaster's collection, so what the hell. Pours a dark(er than a macro light) yellow with a thick white head that recedes to a decent amount of lace. Taste... eh... on first sip you don't get much of anything, little bit of malt but thats it. But then you realize, wait a second, no adjunct taste! And it becomes that much better. So I suppose, if I HAD to drink a light beer for some reason, this would be the one."
"bronz colored with a white head that disappears quickly. not a bad looking beer and it's gonna get rated a little higher here since it's a light beer and not the color of my pee after i've had 6 beers. smells grainy and slightly floral. tastes grainy and pretty sweet, a little caramel maltiness and hops as well. pretty watery mouthfeel, with a lot of carbonation. overall best ""light"" beer i've had but nothing really special as far as quality beer."
"I am definately not a light beer drinker but I have to give credit where it is due. People tend to give light beers a bad rap right off the bat, and in almost all cases they are right to do so. This beer on the other hand should be treated like a light lager is supposed to be. Granted there is no complexity or pizzaz to this, but this style of beer isn't supposed to have it. If a beer should be reviewed with style in mind, I think it is a very good beer. Just try to look at other beers in this category and this one will look pretty tasty. The color and aroma are very nice and there is a crisp refreshing taste."
"Well, this might be the best ""light"" beer that I have had so far in my life, but that still isn't saying all that much. Pours a bronzish golden color with a moderate to weak white head. Taste is grainy sweet, cereal grains are most noticeable. Hop undertones and low carbonation makes the cereal really stand out. Crisp and smooth, which is what all light beer drinkers want. It's still a little watery but not as watery as most light beers. But, my only problem with this is that it's not really that light in calories and carbs. I don't really care personally, but it seems like false advertising or something. I bet it has more carbs and calories than Guiness and most irish stouts."
"A little bit of hops, a little bit of malt, a lot bit of water = an average light beer - right? Wrong! This one really has the edge in taste. The texture of the grains stand out, and the finish is not weak. This isn't the cheapest light beer - but it seems to be one of the best. This compares favorably with Sam's Boston Lager."
"I suppose this stuff was acceptable."
"""Never a Sam Light", my ass. As far as light beers go, it's not bad, but it's not something I'd actively seek out. If I wanted light beer, maybe I'd have this one, but well...I'd probably give up beer first."
"One of the best light beers but not something I'd buy."
"Probably the best light beer on the market today. Pours a very dark brown with a nice frothy head that resides after about a minute, lacing is fair. The smell is that of boston lager, rather skunky with hints of hops and malts. The taste is ligh but still malty and refreshing. Feels crisp in the mouth. Drinkable if you like the light beers, still go for the original Boston Lager."
"Overall a step up from the macros in amount and quality of flavor, but I still wonder why anyone would buy this. I guess if you want to drink a ton of beer, like the taste a bit, and are not willing to exercise, then this would be a good choice. So far I am sticking to non-lights."
"Pours a light copper with a quickly fading head. Aroma is a non-descript blend of caramel and some light herbal notes. Flavor begins slightly sweet, then somewhat acidic with some bread a herbal notes at the end. Mouthfeels is watery with low to medium carbonation. I find it hard to find much to say about this beer... it's just... well... boring."
"Real drinkable, if forced to drink light beer choose this."
"With Light Beers dominating the conventional beer market, it's understandable that Boston Beer Co. would want to enter into the fray. And the like nationals, this beer is watered down, bland and non-descript. It will probably sell to the masses nicely. Personally, I preferred Sam's old Lightship."
"I was given a Christmas sampler from Sam Adams this year, so I found myself with 2 Lights to drink. It has a pale golden color, though it is slightly darker than many other light beers. The aroma slightly sweet, but it is barley there. It has a light body and an ever so slight bitterness. It is fuller in body and hoppier than most other lights, but definitely not worth drinking"
"Dark straw body with a cottony white head. Smells of sweet cereal malts, with modest hops. Taste is pretty unremarkable--mostly subdued malt, accented by mild hops. I have to admit that this is way better than any other light beer I've ever had, but it's still a little lean and thin. If I want a 4% ""light"" beer, I'll stick to the Utah micros."
"i got this one in a mixed 12-pack and felt compelled to try it. pours an amber color with very very high clarity. head is way too fizzy. the beer's texture is just awful. super high carbonation and fizziness just ruins this for me. yeah there's a slight touch of carmelly malt flavor but it's not enough to mask the metallic finish and over-carbonated body. i understand that it's a light beer but i would actually prefer a pils style -- this one just didn't work and tasted way off balance. i'd recommend it maybe if someone only drank lite beers and wanted to taste a bit more malt, but c'mon -- that's not enough of a raison d'etre."
"Well, it is a light beer. But comparing to other light beers I must say it's quite good for a light beer. I like the apperance that it has on it. An amber color compared to others which have a very pale yellow. You can tell that this beer actually uses hops and malts in their beer, even though it's light. Smell was lightly hoppy and a touch of grain in there. Taste was...well light. Kinda watery compared to other beers out there. But it did have some taste to it. You can taste the malts at least. Hey, I got this beer for free, I won't complain, but I certainly wouldn't go out of my way to find this beer."
"Beef Notes: The times I buy this will be few and far between, but it's not a bad beer. I'll gladly drink it if it's given to me. It would probably be quite refreshing in the summer as well."
"What a below average beer (see numbers)! Pours a straw yellow with a quickly dissapearing head. Smell is sweet with no hop aroma. the flavors are pale, stale and boring. Some slight maltiness in the mouthfeel, but overall left me with nothing. No aftertaste to speak of, slightly dry finish. No body to this beer either. As a beer, it beats out the macros, barely. As a light beer, its about the same as Amstel?!?"
"Drinkability&Notes: Kicks the tail feathers out of any other light beer I've had. That being said, though, I'm not sure I'd buy a whole case of these, but would definitely buy this if it was available in a pub before I would any other light. Quite nice, and my scores are putting this beer vs. the macro lights."
"No question an above average light lager. I tasted this blind as a panelist at the Beverage Tasting Institute here in Chicago. This was a mystery brew, and was used as a warm up to a morning of tasting and reviewing stouts and porters. There were 4 tasters and all of us pegged this for pretty much what it is. Albiet, we never would has guessed it to be a light beer. Most of us thought it to be a flavorful, malty session brew-I though it to be a Goose Island Product, flavorful, lighter in style and priced right. It was kind of marzen/Vienna in style-a simple yet well made malt driven brew. Much suprise when we removed the bag! All of us had to admit that this was an above average ""light beer."" Sometimes the label will fool us, and I bet I would have reviewed this lower had I seen it before tasting? Thanks BTI for another bit of beer education!!"
"You could definitely pound the hell out of these all night too, which might save you from the macros if it's cheap enough."
"John"
"Pours out a clear light copper color with a large white head. Aroma is fairly weak. there is a sort of sweat socks type aroma with perhaps a minor skunkiness. Taste is mainly of a sweetish creamy malt. Some slight caramel tastes, not much else here. Decent mouthfeel for a ""light"" beer, creamy. Fairly drinkable, but pretty boring."
"The beer pours a nice golden color with a thick white head. The aroma is yeasty. It has the scent of pale malts and that musty lager aroma. The taste is light. There is a slight malt flavor. I would have to say that this has more taste than most light beers. The mouthfeel is good. It has a low body and good carbonation. This is a good light beer; a real good drinker with some flavor."
"Boston Beer Co. has a done a good job of combining two disparate concepts ""light beer"" and ""craft beer"". It's not a terrible product. It has it's flaws but it is not something to be mistaken for a crappy beer. Pours to a white head that dissipates (oh well). Amber-gold color and lots of carbonation. Aroma is of sweet malt and grassy hops. Flavor is watery and malty with a grassy noble hop tang on the back end. Mouthfeel is best described as ""mineral water""--kind of thin but chalky/astringent. Finishes dry and malty. Easy to drink and not worry about getting too A good beer to have when watching calories and alcohol intake...and you care about taste. This would be my beer of choice of all ""light"" beers."
"Notes: I don't give a rat's ass about whether a beer is light or not... or a brewer macro or not; this is not a bad tasting lager; at 124 calories and 4% ABV, though, the appellation ""light"" is a tad misleading -- almost every 4% beer will weigh in at about 130 calories... including the vastly superior Pilsner Urquell."
"Drinkability/Notes: Sure, it's light, but it's just not flavorful enough to warrant a repeat, IMHO. While I have been greatly impressed with the quality and consistency of Sam Adams products, this, I'm afraid, is mediocre even for a light beer. I'll pass."
"Please remove this from the variety packs BBC, put the Boston Ale back in. Maybe this would belong in the Summer pack, but I couldn't think of a worse winter beer than a light."
"Now here is a light beer that looks, tastes, and smells like real beer! Pleasant amber color and hoppy aroma. Although calorie wise it is on par with Bud or regular Coors, it is much more beer than either. Almost as smooth and rich a regular Sam Adams. A regular in my fridge."
"Sam Adams light is definitely the best light lager beer out on the market today. Although I really am not too crazy at all about regular Sam Adams Boston Lager, this is really pretty good especially for a light beer. Recommended to anyone who wants a few beers and watch the calories at the same time who enjoy a damn good tasting beer."
"pale amber color with a thin white head. slight hints of malt and hops in the aroma. has a dry mouthfeel with a nice malty finish. this has gotta make the ""big 3 drinkers"" go insane when they see it in a glass, as it's not the standard pale yellowy color that one would expect with a light beer and this actually has some taste to it. gotta be the best light beer on the market to date."
"notes: i see they're pitching it towards the college tools who drink what they're told to drink. hmm...what a paradox?"
"Drinkability: Easy-drinking and quite palatable. Not as exciting as their flagship brew, but still respectable."
"I am torn here. I love Sam Adams beers but hate light beers. I understand why they have brewed this beer and don't hold it against them. It is better than most light beers I have sampled. A mediocre brew that was brewed to be that way although I appreciate the lack of adjuncts. Note to Jim Koch: Don't put this in the Winter Classics pack! I have been buying your Winter Classics for 9 years now and this is not a winter beer. Put it in all the other 12-packs but leave the winter pack be. Put your Scotch Ale in there instead. (or better yet, bring back Honey porter...)"
"I tasted this on two occasions,once side by side with Miller Lite and Bud Light the second time with MGD and Coors. With the lights it stood easily on top, much darker color, much bolder aroma, and definitely a better taste. With the regular beers , this tasted very ordinary.I guess light is just light, there are beers that taste good for a light, but not lights that taste great as a beer"
"Compared to anything that I have ever tried in the light beer category, this wins hands down. Tastes like a full-flavored beer with a little water added. While other lights taste like water with a hint of beer flavor and alcohol. Very worth buying, and drinking on a regular basis."
"This is by far the best light beer I have had. I liked the maltiness, rather than the hoppiness of it. It was a darker shade than most lighter beers, but then again, it's Sam Adams. The head lasted a few minutes and was light colored. I got it at Red Lobster, which sucks anyways, so it was a highlight of the meal. I am defaintley going to recomend this one to all my bros and biotches. Gotta keep the scene alive!!!"
"I'd would make this a ""keep in the back of the fridge for when the guys come over"" type of beer. It is a tolerable beer (for the most part) by swillers and BAs. Good beer to bridge the gap."
"I understand the market for a light beer from Sam Adams...but I wasn't impressed with it. I bought a six pack when it first came out and I really had a hard time finishing all six. Better than average light beers out there but...why? Taste wasn't that good and that caused drinkability to suffer. I'll stick with the ""lighter"" SA beers(Vienna, Summer Ale, etc)"
"Medium gold color, small head. Aroma is grassy and sweet. Light malts, some hoppyness. Has the feel of a light beer, but has some flavor to it. Not bad for a light beer, but as a regular beer it's a little weak. It is, after all, a LIGHT Beer. Mouthfeel is a little thin. Finish is clean and crisp. Aftertaste is slightly bitter. Nice beer for a light."
"I'm not a light beer drinker, but I don't mind having a few Sam Adams Lights every once in a while."
"Would I have it again? Sure. Just not all the time."
"This is simply one of the best light beers out there, even though it is really a borderline light beer (with high calorie content, that is). Too bad it isn't somewhat cheaper, as it would have a constant presence in my fridge. My hunch is that it was designed and marketed for the beautiful people who visit the gyms and are watching their wastlines. Poor sods."
"A small, off-white, coarse head on a clear, darkish amber beer. Interesting color for a light beer. Smell is lagery, sweetish, a little nutty. Good. Lotsa nuts in the front, fruit and malt in the middle. Major nuttiness again in the finish. This is very, very good for a light beer."
"For a light beer, it does the commercials justice. On the other hand, I'm inclined to regard it in the same manner I do every other non-light beer. It certainly raises the bar (about a mile and a half) for light beers, but it probably won't find its way into my fridge until it can compete price-wise with other lights."
"Flavor is a touch watered down, although still fairly flavorful. Clean malts, with some mild german hopping taking up the back, providing a crisp finish. Somewhat grainy. Body is very light, with moderate to high carbonation. Not bad, certainly not something I'll make a habit of, but great for a light beer."
"As far as light beers goes, it's easily one of the most flavorful, but I'd almost rather drink a macro light simply because you're not taunted by how good it could be."
"By far my favorite light beer pours a orange/gold color with light to mediium head,aroma is slightly bready like malt aroma.Taste has a good hop flavor for a light beer with a good malty smack in the finish.Good mouthfeel for a light beer as well,and can drink many of these without feeling full.Its a light beer take it for what it is."
"I was not impressed with this offering from the Boston Beer Company. Light a fizzy, this brew did not pack much flavor at all. Now of course, it is cleary better then most mass produced swill, but as for a person who enjoys beer, there are TONS more beer that are light, but offer much more in the way of flavor. This one had some malt and hops, that provided some bittering flavor, but this really tasted like someone watered down a Boston Lager. This beer is obviously valuable to some, but it really is not in the same category as their other beers and ales. Just my opinion."
"This brew poured a medium head of finely sized white bubbles and a transparent light amber brown body. The head faded away fairly quickly and left no lacing. It has a very mild unnoticeable aroma. Its flavor is a bit on the fizzy side and that of mild hops. It was fairly smooth with a bit of a foretaste and a mild lingering hop aftertaste."
"I used to drink this years ago when it was called Lightship. This is probably the best light beer you can get right now. Basically a lighter version of their Boston lager. Color is almost the same as the B.L. Medium copper with minimal head. Aroma still not bad even after being watered down, some malt and hops there. Crisp and refreshing with some decent flavor for a light."
"Mouthfeel, as expected, is thin. Drinkability may be fairly high, but ""taste-ablity"" isn't."
"Pours a medium amber color, topped by a white head that displays pretty good retention. Sweet grainy aroma is fairly one dimensional. The taste is actually fairly malty, without the stronger sweetness seen in the Boston lager. Something resembling bitterness on the finish, but it quickly disappears. Mouthfeel is decent for a near-macro. Drinakbility is also pretty good, although the overall mild flavor doesn't prod me to drink more. I'd have to say it's my second favorite light lager behind Saranac. And it didn't make me scream like an idiot."
"12 oz bottle. Poured a darker amber than would be expected from a light beer. Very good head that stuck around, and some fine lacing that also lasted till the end. Aroma was very light malt and no hops. Taste was the same, light and slightly sweet. Not to fizzy, and very smooth. Enjoyable, but I still prefer something more substantial."
"""Mmmm Beer..."" Homer Simpson"
"Pours darker than most light beers. A light amber would be a good description. The head came and went within a blink of the eye. This brew also left no lacing around the glass. The aroma was a bit sweet with malt and little to none on the hops. The flavor was a watered down version of its big brother. A sweet malty start with a bit of a bite at the end with hops. Compare to other light beers this one is much better. So as a light beer .A bit above average"
"12 oz brown bottle, pours a pale amber with little head. Its darker than you would expect with a light beer. I don't know that it's really light at all in fact. As opposed to most micro's, yes...as opposed to most macros, certainly not. If you must get a light beer, I say definitely get this one. The taste has decent balance...tilted to the malty side, but there is hop presence. Dry aftertaste, but a very drinkable beer. If you just want a beer...skip it. If you want a light beer, it would be hard to beat it."
"There was no lacing on the sides of my glass with this particular beer. I could not determine what the aroma was in this beer. It had a watery taste to it. There was no bitterness or aftertaste noted with this beer. I was not impressed at all with this beer."
"A bit of a pale amber in color. Fizzy, with a head that dissipates rapidly. The carbonation leaves this beer quickly, as it almost flat after the head goes away. The aroma is rather bland and thin. I only get a little bit of malts, no hops to speak of. The taste has a little body to it. Really tastes like a watered down Sam Adams. Comparing it to most ""light"" beers, it is better. There is no compelling reason to buy this. I would say that it is best as probably a ""chick"" beer. Came in with the holiday gift pack: a present."
"This light beer beats the shit out of the other US macro shit light beers. This isn't watered down, it has flavor and it has character. If this were a regular beer it would be an average beer. It pours out amber with a medium off white head. Lots of carbonation giving this a crisp mouthfeel. Aroma is of strong malt charteristics with some hop backround, taste is pretty much the same. Drinkability is good. Got this at a friends party, he got this to try and convert all the other light beer drinkers to try something new. Some liked it some did not. It was a good way of trying to convert people to drink a better tasting beer. This is a good light beer but I won't go out of my way to by a sixer."
"Deep Gold in color with a nice white fizzy head. Light, slightly rye-bready herbal malt. Floral hop aroma with a light sweet malt fragrance. Fairly high in metallic and light citrus hops. Malty for a Light. IMHO, the best Light beer to date that I've tried."
"Alright, I had to try itonly because it was mixed in the Winter Sampler pack and if I threw it out it would be alcohol abuse. I was surprised, it was actually a decent light beer, much better that any other light American beer that Ive had. Pours a light copper color topped off with a 1/2-inch white head that slowly fades away leaving a thin lace on the glass. The aroma had a moderate amount of toasted malt and hops with just a slight sweetness of caramel. The taste is very similar to the aroma. Even though, Im not much of a light beer drinker, I will definitely keep this one in mind."
"Believe this to be the best light that I have ever tasted."
"Pours a copper color with a thin, patchy head that keeps very well, does not look like any light beer I've come across, appears dark in color for a light beer. As the bottle states - two row malt and cascading hops, these seem to be very well balanced, the taste of malt, grain and a bit chalky is followed by just a bit of a watery taste, clearly the best light beer I've sampled, probably a good marketing tactic for future converts!"
"This beer poured a clear golden with a fair head that lasted for some time. It may be said that it is better than the macro beers, but I don't know for sure if that is true. The aroma was mild at best. The taste and mouthfeel were equally non memorable. I bought this to eat with a salad and red beans and rice. It completmented the meal without taking the lead. I guess that is what I wanted from this beer."
"There's not really any advantage to pouring it from the bottle to a glass, but I secretly enjoy drinking from the bottle now and then. Better to do it with a beer that won't blossom when poured into the appropriate glass."
"Honestly, I'm concerned that this beer became overheated in the delivery truck. I'm a longtime fan of Boston Beer and this is the most disappointed I've ever been with them."
"It pours with decient head which goes down in seconds. It is amber in color but lacks richness. Faint smell of hopps followed by a watery taste that is common to American lagers that are produced in mass quantity. The finish is the worst part of the beer, intruducing flavors that I am conviced are derived from rice or corn insead of malts and hopps."
"Rather pleasing hoppy aroma, especially for a light, with a light malt backing. Amber. Clear. Medium fizzy head with left fairly quickly. Light overall taste,as would be expected, but some nice hop characteristics, with malt backing, again. Short finish, but not unpleasant. Fairly thin, but some fullness from the amount of carbonation. Certainly better that any light I've ever had. Has a sweetwater smell and taste of NA's, yet not too much. Could maybe even settle for this if I had too."
"WEll luckilly I am aallowed one ""proper"" beer a week..I suppose this stuff is slightly better than most lights so looks like I will be sticking to this."
"Pours a reddish gold with an average head that fades rather quickly to a ""cling ring"". Floral hop aroma stands out. Decent hop bite and surprisingly well balanced. Probably the best light beer I've tried so far. Doesn't taste as watered down as all of the other offerings out there. Better than average for a light, but go for the extra calories, you really aren't saving that much."
"Surprisingly dark amber color with a soft, cottony head that stretches into fine lace with some irregularities. The nose is unusual. There is a suggestion of toasty, caramelized malts, but they come across weakly in combination with elements of overripe, lemons. On the palate it is indeed light, finishing within seconds, leaving a pleasant, clear aftertaste of brown bread and water. I find no flaw with this beer in terms of how it was executed. Stylistically, it seems to strain to pull all of the flavor elements together. Can rich, Anglo beer flavor work in a light format? Probably never as well as northern European Pilsner."
"The pour a typical limpid golden amber color, the head masterful in size and frothy in texture, with the left over lace a nice clinging sheet. Nose is all malt, crisp, clean and fresh, quite pleasant overall. Start is lightly sweet with plenty of malt, the top skeletal, the finish is biting in its acidity, the hops apropos to the style, very dry aftertaste, drinkable and something for the days this summer when it is 115 degrees outside."
"Perhaps BBC has created a new niche of beers. How favorably the public responds to it should be interesting."
"Pours a bright, clear amber color with solid carbonation, small white lace. On the nose the aroma is fairly clean, slight grain. On the palate the flavors are all mild, light grain notes, slight sweetness, slight fizzy mouthfeel, light caramel maybe, and soft hop citrus flavors as well. This is hands down the best light beer I have ever tasted, but I havent tasted many."
"Poured a head that dissapeared within seconds to nothing.The color is an orange-red.A mild hop aroma.With a weird smell of pond water or the smell the outside after it rains.A very crisp mouthfeel with a fizzy taste.A slight hop taste with a wheaty finish.A light bodied beer with very little malt texture.The taste is really bad overall.I really cant believe Sam Adams would lower themselves in putting out a ""Light"" beer that tastes as bad as this.It really lowered my perception of Sam Adams."
"OK - enough complaining: The fact is this really surprised me. This beer didn't suck. It was the last thing left cold in the fridge. So rather than wait - I went ahead and tried it. This beer is a lighter beer for sure. And it may compare to a lot of other lights in color and nose and calories. But that is where is stops. Most light beers in the U.S. are watered down beers that also kill the flavor. Boston Beer Company has compensated for that by adding hops to this one. This is more like a lager in taste but has a watery mouthfeel that is characteristic of a light beer. If you are a beer fan and you like most of us have to count calories periodically - this is a good compromise beer. I would burst into flame the minute I drank a Bud or Miller Lite."
"This beer poured into the glass a clear golden/amber color. To be honest, the color surprised me, it was darker then I thought it would be, like Coors light, Miller light, etc. No head except for a small skin on the top, white in color. Again surprised when I saw lace left behind. The aroma was light with some grains and hops (floral). The taste was also light. It had hints of sweet malt, grains and hops at the end. A well carbonated creamy beer in the middle and dry and crisp at the end. For this type of beer, I say “good job”"
"a very hard beer to rate. would i prefer just about any other BBC brew to SA light? yes. is this 10 times better than any other light beer i've ever had? yes. that said, it's an excellent light beer as light beers go. there's actually a bit of flavour and colour here. very smooth going down. i'd like to see the boston ale (or better yet, bring back the scotch ale...one of the best sam's ever) back in the winter classics 12 pk instead of SA light, but i certainly won't mind having to drink this one."
"If you like Sam Adams, save yourself the calories and try it. If you don't like SA, this won't win you over."
"For a ""light"" beer, this beer does a far better job than others in the category of actually tasting like I feel beer should. Not something I would drink a lot or seek out, (the sample was included in a Winter sampler 12 pack) but if you know someone who drinks light beer and would like to expand their palate, you couldn't go wrong showing them this beer."
"Musty cardboard nose (oxidation). Light clear amber color with a slight white head. No detectable hop flavor and very little malt base. Slightly more mouth that other light beers. Overall not to usual SA standards. I expected some hop taste.. this was just watery."
"Better than drinking watery light beers...but id rather take the extra calories and have a Boston Lager."
"Goldem amber with moderage head and fizziness. Crisp malteness highlights the first taste, with a slight dose of dry hoppiness to round out the brew. Not quite the beer I've expected. Sam Adams tried to keep the full figured Reinheitsgebot thing going but still keeping a lower cal beer. I think there are better lighter beers out there. And at 128 callories, this really isn't that light!"
"OK, a tough one to call. Pours with a big head that dissipates quickly. A bit of malty smell which is an accomplishment for a lite beer. Slightly citrus and metallic taste with some malty flavor. Has some character compared to other lite beers. I give it slightly higher marks for being good in it's style. It is not a 3.5 beer vs. others out of this style. As they say lite beers are like making love in a canoe - f***ing close to water. The two from the Winter Classics variety pack will be it for me. This beer sort of marked a change in philosophy for Sammy and I don't like the way it is going."
"Pours to a light copper color with a white head that quickly dissipates. The nose is of light caramel malt and floral hops. The taste is a caramel malt sweetness, with little hop flavor and bitterness. It is light in body and smooth. Overall it is a very drinkable beer. It is a very nice surprise in comparison to your typical Americal Light Lagers. If I were to choose an American Light Lager to drink, this would be the one."

"Decent clear amber color, 1/8 inch head settles to a skim in 25 seconds. Slight hop to the very reserved aroma. Watery flavor, malt is decent and slightly brown sugar but quickly fades from the flavor. The hops are nice and ""English"" pollen-like floral (not like macro extract cop-outs in quick and cheap impression). This beer has a good finish but its the mid mouth ""pause"" between malt and hop that just doesn't cut it or identify it as a good beer. I guess its the best ""botique"" Light I've had so far (Amstel, Saranac, Leinenkugel's Amber Light) but, ehhh...why?"
"A light beer with flavor!! See it can be done. Definitely the best I have ever had in the style. Full of flavor for a lite, and even when compared to regular macros."
"I am not a big light beer guy. If i have a light beer it is Amstel. But behold, America answers the call. This is the first American light beer i can drink. It is amlost as goo as regular Samy's, but you can tell it is lighter. First it won't fill up as quickly. Second it is a little lighter in color. This is as close as America will come to a truely Europian light beer. Ladies also drink alot of it too, whwich is a big plus. This is a truely though a manly beer, just take of the light an you are good to go."
"This beer pours a dark amber with a amble amount of head that goes dowm pretty fast, leaving no trace of head. There is also no noticable lace. The auroma contians no noticable smells. The taste is is very good for a light beer. I would have no trouble drinking a six pack of this beer but dont think i will be buying this beer again."
"Not a bad brew this Sam Adams Light, I will have to keep this one in mind the next time Im doing the lights."
"A good beer for people that believe the hype. So it has more flavor than your typical American light, who cares? BBC didn't think they could join the market share scrum without a beer that had the word ""light"" in its name, but it all weighs the same to me. What decent beer is the next victim when the ad campaign does its job and production of light takes priority? Sam has replaced the old-timey knit shirt and vest for a dark-blue suit and red power tie. So long old friend."
"This beer is light amber in the glass, darker than any ""light"" beer I've ever seen, with a two finger off-white head that quickly disappears. Almost no smell at all. Malt flavor dominates, hops are muted but evident and there's a slightly metallic quality to the finish. Very smooth and easy to drink. Kudos to SA for producing an adjunct-free light beer, but as has been pointed out many times before, the caloric difference between ""light"" beers and regular versions of lighter styles is minimal so why bother."
"cheers."
"Pours a golden amber color with a thin white head. Very dark for a light beer. Aroma is sweet malts and grains with some floral notes. Very malty flavor, especially for a light beer, and is crisp and refreshing in the mouth. This is one of the best light beers Ive had the pleasure to drink."
"I really don't think it's fair to say this is only a ""lighter"" version of SA Boston Lager. After trying the two back to back, there is quite a difference between the flavor charcteristics of each. Light is obviously much more bland compared to the regular. But between Miller Lite and Coors Light, the better tasting Sam Adams Light definitely gets my vote."
"Nice amber color with a quick lived head and a thin lace. The aroma is sweet with malt. The flavor is light, smooth, malty sweet, crisp, and grainy with a touch of hops and caramel flavor. The body is light not watery. Overall, this is a good light beer."
"Now, for my opinion. I'll never buy this again and I can't ever see myself in the situation where this is the best on the list. Surely if they have SA Light, they will at least have regular SA lager....so I would choose the lager. Why does SA make this stuff? Well, it's not for us BA's. Obviously trying to please everyone. Can't say I wouldn't do the same if it were my business, but I'd like to think that I would not. Cheers!"
"Pure transparent amber color with a white head that's nearly gone in no time. Only a thin lace stays. Unexpectedly big aroma for a light, sharply sweet malt with a little hop character. As for the flavor, more big yet soft malty sweetness. A pretty big dose of it for a light beer, but still far from powerful. It's got a metallic sweetness to it as well, which I don't like. Hops appear in a lingering tingly bitterness that roams about the tongue. More sweet grain in the finish. As expected, it's pretty much a watered-down version of Boston Lager, but it is a bit different, the malt is much sweeter, and just too metallic. It almost has a corn sweetness, but I don't really want to get into that territory, I'm not saying they used adjuncts. Definitely good for a light beer, but the key phrase there is ""for a light beer"". I'd much rather have a Boston Lager. However, for the macroswillers/light beer drinkers, this could be a turning point."
"Aside note observation: Once the shockingly great taste subsides and you revisit this beer in the future you will be disappointed. It really is not that good once you know what to expect. You notice how thin it is, you notice the overly leafy, tea-like taste, and you notice the obviously low alcohol content. You notice the flaws"
"Just like the Boston lager, with a less prevalent taste, but the taste kicks in at the end. A good beer for when you don't want to get full. But still not as good as some of the other Sam Adams varieties. not bad if you just want a good beer but don't want to be filled up, or excessively drunk, still a better alternative than bud light."
"Very pleasantly surprised with this beer.  Its a light and its good!  I usually can not stand a light beer and I can see myself drinking this again when I don't fell like getting filled up.  It pours little head which disappates in a few minutes, leaving no lace on the glass.  Carbonated rather heavily with big fluffy bubbles.  Nerofiddled noted its slightly sweet carmel flavor.  I agree, it is the primary taste of this brew.  Has secondary mellow malt flavors. If any thing is THE beer drinker's light beer (if such a think exsists as I think that is an oxymoron) this, not Amstel is."
"Crystal clear, rich amber in color, with a big bubbled off-white head that drops quickly and soon dissolves to nothing. Not a great appearance, but at least the head didn't immediately disappear like a Coors Light. The aroma offers a lightly sweet caramel maltiness and very subdued hops. The body is surprisingly firm for a light beer - medium/light - and it's not watery at all. It starts off with a fairly crisp carbonation but loses quite a bit as the beer warms. Fortunately, that allows some more of the flavor to come through, displaying a surprising amount of sweet caramel maltiness. The bitterness and hop flavor are understandably well-heeled. It finishes lightly sweet at first, but quickly dries out with a light touch of hop - similar to many other lights, and even somewhat reminiscent of a non-alcoholic beer. Much better than I'd expected! My new favorite light beer."
"This beer is almost a copper color.  Very clear.  Interesting tone for a light beer.  A thin head recedes to a thin film quickly and then sticks around for a while.  Decent maltiness and noble hop aroma on the nose.  The mouthfeel is almost too carbonated for me to give it a good rating in the drinkablility category.  Pretty big body for a light beer though.  Maybe a little better than medium.  The taste is a notch above most macro brewed light beers.  But it's not that much better.  The noble hops make their presence known only with a slight spiciness.  The malt backing is o.k.  For a light beer, this is decent.  Still not enough taste in it to make it very enjoyable."
":)"
"As a producer of better-than-average beers, Sammy takes a risk in jumping into the light beer market segment.  They can set the standard for light beers, proving that taste and ""light"" are not mutually exclusive terms, or they can produce yet another dumbed-down beer to appeal to the widest audience possible.  I was hoping for the former, but looks like we got the latter.  Not to say that this was as bad as most lights, but I expected more.  Light golden color, some sweet grain in the nose.  Flavor was a little course with grain flavors, and the hopping, while I could tell it was Sammy's, was too light to punch up this beer, leaving it weak and flaccid.  If the choice is this or some other light beer, I'll take this.  But if I have any other decent choice, I'll pass."
"  There is too much carbonation here for me to even enjoy the flavor of Sam's Light, but it redeems itself in the sense that it is a lite beer that tastes a little better than a typical American Lager."
"Bright golden color with a low head that virtually disappears.  Suprising nice light hop and light malt aroma balance.  Light malt flavor with a decent balanced flavor - certainly not as hoppy as SA Boston Lager.  I found the taste and finish to be a bit metallic (tin?).  Light bodied but creamy compared to the BudMilCor light beers."
"I do not concern myself with the caloric content of beer, so the fact that this is a light beer would not cause me to buy it again.  However, this is a really good beer and one that I will drink again.  It also might serve to gently introduce friends to the universe of better beer."
"Pours a light amber with a little white head.  Tastes maltier & hoppier than any light beer I have tried, not a bad beer.  I am sure it would be a good session beer.  If you put aside all bias towards or against BBC, you have to admit it's not bad."
"I think that this beer is a worthy option for light beer drinkers. It is my personal opinion that The Boston Beer Company actually deserves some respect. They carried through with consistency and quality that they are known for rather than just dismissing this as a light beer that doesn't need to be contended with. I value that brand of integrity."
"dark, deep golden color.  thin head that died quickly and left no lace.  light toasted caramel malt aromas with a light hop balance.  tastes ok....more flavor than any other light beer i've ever had, not to mention more flavor than most domestic ""heavy"" lagers.  decent mouthfeel and drinkability.  not a beer to overanalyze,  just to enjoy and thank the beer gods that someone came up with a light beer worth drinking.  not worth the price though.   i hope SA gets their cut of the light beer drinking market and maybe will change a few minds about what beer can and should be."
"Was prepared to jump on the anti-BBC bandwagon, seeing the comercials and all. Has a nice copper color with a whispy white head. Does have taste, almost like a good summer beer. I am not a big of lights, but will not turn down an offer of one of these. Buying one however is another matter...."
"But it is a great pick for thirst-quenching without coming across as too heavy. Big thumbs-up here..."
"Crystal clear copper hue, covered by a fluffy two fingered ivory white head that manages lace. Much more enticing in appearance versus the typical insipid light. Light caramel sweetness and a hint of toasty malt in aroma, along with a very mild floral hop nose.  Bland, but above average characterwise aromawise for a light.  Unfortunately, flavorwise this brew falls prey to the typical dearth in flavor of a typical light, and is both thin in body and malt character.  Sweetness is caramel malt derived, and hints of dry, toasty malt provide character a bit above the norm for a light.  Hop bitterness is above the norm and provides a crisp, quenching feel.  Paltry Mittelfruh hop flavor eeks its way in, but isn't assertive enough to prevent overall blandness.  Very well attenuated and dry overall, w/ a slightly watery mouthfeel.  Finishes dry, w/ trace biscuity malt briefly lingering.  SA Light tastes like a Boston Lager diluted with Seltzer water. Although perhaps the most flavorful light I've tasted, it's still very much a lackluster beer."
"Still...I challenge anyone to find me a better tasting light beer...."
"Notes: This is a light beer that is sure to revolutionize the perception of light beers! Okay, no it's not ... and it's not even really a light beer. Sam Adams Light is full of flavour, colour and aroma at 128 calories (no different than most non-light beers) per 12oz serving. It's also made from two-row barley and 100% noble hops -- unlike other light beers that are chuck full of adjuncts and sometimes other icky things. In the light category, this is at the top, hence my rating, but as a beer this is something that I would not normally buy."
"Unlike other Light beers, it's better than bad! However at 124 calories, it's not as light as Miller Lt. or Amstel Lt. (96 & 95 cals). It's pretty dark for a Light beer, a nice dark gold. Average head, and sweet aroma with some hops noticable. Malty and grainy in taste, the hops are there, too. Good job, Jim!"
"This pours a very pleasantly surprising clear copper color, with a better than expected white head. Smell had the characteristic Sam Adams ""2 row barley malt"" and decent hops as well. Very much in the Boston Lager tradition. Taste was creamy, smooth, and very enjoyable. Enough barley, and crisp dry finish to make this taste like a beer. Easily the best light beer I have had. A pleasant surprise and another winning product for the Boston Beer Co."
" Jim Koch did it again and as usual, has yet to disappoint"
"Good looking brew. Dark Amber in color. Very nice head & ok on lace. I don't know other light beers so I can't compair fairly.It is drinkable with alittle hop smell. But...To me its no Boston Lager, it falls short on finish with no hop kick and leaves mouth with a foam-like feel. Its ok for someone who dosn't know Sam Adams. We that do, its alittle light, then again, thats its purpose."
"wow! a light beer with some flavor. it goes down nice and smooth, and doesn't have that typical light beer watered-down taste. i can see why it is such a hit. it is not fantastic, but there is probably not a better american light beer out there. It has more flavor than your average light, which doesn't mean much, but what can you really expect."
"Anyway, it was good. Extremely smooth for a light beer and very easy to drink. And the taste beats any other American light beer I have had to date. Very faint hops in both smell and aftertaste. A very nice light beer, and its quite easy to drink 2 or 30 of them. Woooooooooooooooooooooooooooo"
"Better than average light beer. A little more flavor than is the norm for lighter fare and a much nicer color. Hint of caramel aftertaste as well. I still wouldn't classify it as a ""revolution""."
"Pours with an attractive amber color and a respectable white head.  Faint hop aroma.  I expected more from the taste, however.  With very little body, the beer lacked a satisfying fullness.  Granted, this is better than all other light beer's I've had, but it doesn't live up to the standards of the brand."
"Copper amber body. Lots of carbonation. Large white head of micro bubbles which quickly settles to half-inch. Decent lacing. Both floral and citrus notes in aroma. Some of the Sam Lager spicyness. A little too fizzy, which pushes back the taste. Could use more malt backbone, but then it probably wouldn't be a light beer. Far superior to any of the major light beers, and better than my memory of other micro lights (Harpoon, Mr. Mike's, New Amsterdam). I don't really remember Lightship, so I can't compare them. And better than a lot of Sam knockoffs over the years.  One ugly label, though."
"Finally got to try Sam Adams Light here in Chicago at a local bar, (not in stores just yet), and while admittedly it was better than your average light beer, actually better than 95% of the light beers. It has good flavor, and body for a light beer. The only light beer I would rank higher would be Leinenkugel's Amber Light."
"Much better than your average light beer.  I like the fact that it does not taste like sam adams lager or boston ale.  Really sweet I was up all night after drinking it."
"The best light beer out there.  Pours to a very Sammy Lager looking copper color.  Light taste of caramel malt with a slight hop finish.  Unlike other lights, you can actually taste some malt and hops.  As another reveiwer said, no much in terms of body, but if you are drinking a light beer, you aren't looking for body.  I've been told national rollout of this will be in August.  Better than Amstel, or the lights from the imports."
"As a beer, it’s a good beer, as a light beer it is great."
"Not deserving of the Sam Adams label. The only thing really poor was the way it felt in my mouth. It almost felt soapy.. odd. For a light beer though it was one of the better ones I've had."
"This basically tastes like SA's Boston lager with water added. Substantial malt character and pleasant aroma. Better than other light beers but tough to recommend on its own terms. Will drink again if offered, might be nice at a summer BBQ. Would work as a compromise brew with someone who'd pick something like Amstel if left to her/his own devices."
"For a light its drinkable and is much better than a Bud light.  Deep coppery color with some carbonation. Still the best of the  lights is Alexander Keith's Light Ale."
"My first taste of this light was disapointing.  As this brew warmed in my glass the flavors came out and I was quite impressed.  This is what a light beer should taste like.  Just the copper color of this light beer is enough to try it.  This isn't your nascar swilling light.  A definite brew for that summer bbq or tailgate."
"THIS SURPRISED ME!!!!!!!!!!!  I hate light beers, or is it lite?  This has a wonderful flavor and mouth feel for a light beer.  This could be a great lawnmower beer for next summer."
"One of the darkest light beers I have ever seen, one of the maltiest light beers I have ever tasted also."
