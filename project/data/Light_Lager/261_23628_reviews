"O - wouldn't buy again, but not bad for a light"
"I may have to re-try this one. I see all the favorable reviews. I thought it tasted awful. Did I just get a bad or outdated sixer or what? I've tried a lot of beers and this one is the worst."
"Says review optional. It is not"
"Similar tastes to grey lady. Nice and crisp."
""
"I swear this tastes like some Belgian Ale offshoot. For a low cal low ABV it is delishous for sure. Very citrusy and thin but expected for a light beer. No weird aftertaste, finish is crisp. Overall a good light lager that blows away the BMC crowd but only negative is very expensive. 12 Pak cans 16.99 at Total Wine."
"Can poured into tulip thanks to Cisco rep who happened to be eating at Beachwood BBQ Seal Beach. Pours slightly hazy gold with thin white cap. Aroma is cereal grain and floral hop. Flavor is slightly more hoppy but is uninspired. Light bodied with a thin mouthfeel, crisp finish, and moderate to high carbonation. Overall, not memorable, even as a BMC replacement light beer."

"You know it's a solid birthday when you spend it at a beer distributor's trade show, right?  Here at the Cisco table, we've got Sankaty Light.  It pours a clear straw topped by a finger or so of lightly off-white foam.  The nose comprises light white bread, mild flowers, mild grass, and a kiss of what seems to me to be tangelo rind.  The taste brings in more of the same, the lightness in the name and the smell underlined here on my tongue.  In addition, the bread from earlier appears to have taken on a slight sweetness, though it's not much to speak of.  The body is appropriately light, with a light moderate carbonation and a kinda watery feel.  Overall, this isn't a bad beer by any stretch, especially considering how overwhelmingly underwhelming the light lager style has become over the years, but it's overt mildness borders far too much on boring for its own good.  I could see myself drinking another at some point in the future, but it's unlikely I'll have paid for it."

"All things are relative and this light lager pours with nice body, significant aroma and great taste...for a light lager. The body is clean pale straw with a sizable bright white head. The aroma is lemony with nice cereal malts and a Pilsner like scent. The taste is crisp, light and lemony with tea leaf malts, cereal grains and an almost wheat like body. This is a hugely sessionable lager with significant personality and very well done....for a light lager."

"Sankaty is in most actuality a Vienna Lager but in the shell of a light lager. As a Vienna-style beer, the ale sorely misses its mark in body and hops. But as a unique American light lager, it's marketing might just be ingenious."
""
"O: Great drinkable lager, more flavor then your run of the mill domestic lager but still very accessible to non-craft beer drinkers. Add that it is comes in a can and is 3.8% ABV and this is a perfect pool/beach beer."
"Pours a hazy golden-yellow with a foamy off-white head that settles to a partial film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, citrus zest, and grass aromas. Taste is much the same with citrus zest and grass flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp but somewhat thin mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that is refreshing and tasty for what it is."

"Overall this is an okay American lager."
"The Sankaty Light Lager is a decent american style lager. The beer poured a pale yellow clear color with white head that is leaving some lace. There isnt much to the scent...maybe some wet grain and mild malt. The taste is well balance with subtle hint of lemony citrus. The mouthfeel is lighter in body with good carbonation. Overall it is a decent lager and would be best drank on warm summer days."

"Overall: Really hoppy and light. Is this right? Nice hop profile and simplistic."
"O: Very simple and straightforward, just a clean, hoppy session lager. A no-frills 'just drink it' sort of beer. A nice lawnmower beer, and there's nothing wrong with that."

"O - Combine all of the above with a 3.7 ABV and I could easily drink a 12-pack over the course of a hot weekend. I wish I could, but the price tag is a little steep to allow for this on a regular basis. Very enjoyable, but since I normally limit myself to a beer a night, this one doesn't really fit into my regular rotation."

"Had this poured from a can into a pint glass. My ratings are in comparison to other light lagers, not beers in general (I think that this is how most reviews on this site are supposed to be, but it's easy to compare lagers to other lagers when you've had a bunch of different varieties, as opposed to comparing something like milk stouts where maybe you've only had a handful). I think this is one of the few light lagers that I actually enjoy drinking. Very refreshing and not too heavy, crisp and fruity, excellent on a summer day. Smell is bolder and fruitier than most lagers as well. Solid offering from the incredibly consistent Cisco."

"Sankaty Light is a light beer that would make Coors Light cringe (not Coors Light drinkers, mind you, I bet they'd prefer it). It offers big flavour in a low-calorie serving and a level of quality that you simply can't find in macro, commercial brands. It is a reminder that lower alcohol beers are still real beers nonetheless; they have maltiness and bitterness just like any others. Good on Cisco for sticking up for the little guys!"

"Clean and refreshing. Nice lager!"
""
"Overall: a good light lager. For a beer of this ABV, it's quite tasty and drinkable."
""
""
"Watery and thin feel, to be expected I guess. Clean and malty with some expressive noble hop character. Wisps of bready biscuit and herbal tea. Little sweetness, more of a dry coarse finish. Not a bad lager, certainly has more flavor than most light beers on the market."
""
""
""
"Overall: Aroma and appearance are appropriate to style, but the flavor was slightly watery and could have benefited from a more dextrinious wort"
""

"Poured on-tap and served in a tumbler pint, the beer is a crisp, yellow-gold coloring with a tall, white, foamy head. Buttery and roasted aromas on a crisp nose. Smooth, buttery flavors with a roasted grain backbone. Roasty aftertaste with a smooth finish. Tasty and light, with a low ABV making it extremely sessionable."
"Notes: This is a great summer beer light bodied for a warm day and very drinkable. Cheers."
"Pours a clear light gold with a white head that settles to a dense 1/4 inch cap, leaving slight sheets of lacing. Mild aromas of doughy malt, grassy hops, and sweet grain. Not bad for a Light beer. Taste is similarly impressive, with more bready malt, sweet toasted grain, and faintly herbal hops. Not watered-down in the least, and easily the most full-flavored Light Beer I've had (edging Sam Adams only slightly). Mouthfeel is very crisp and drinkable, with a medium-thin body and excellent carbonation. Overall a superb Light Lager, probably the best on the shelves."

"The Crack & Gllug was up to spec and I managed to produce a finger of bone-white head with limited retention in this oppressive heat and humidity. Color was a beautiful sunshine-yellow with NE-quality clarity and plenty of fizzy bubbles. Take that, Greg Koch! Nose smelled like all-malt (no adjuncts) and grassy hops and my heart began to go pitty-pat. I CANnot tell you the pain that I have endured at times in this madness, and especially from this style, AALs and AMLs. This actually smelled like real beer, even in a Light Lager version. Mouthfeel was actually pretty big, very foamy with big bubbles and the taste was of light malt and light grassy hops. Zounds! Finish was semi-dry and I was ready for another sip. I CANnot remember the last time that I thought that way of a beer of this style. Now, all of that said, I am not going to pack the cooler full of such CANs, however. I do not care how good it may be, I am not into Light beers. I probably could stand to lose some weight, but not by cutting back on flavorful beer. If you are accompanying me to the beach or elsewhere, I will happily put some in the cooler for you, but that's it."

"Thanks to woodychandler for this beer. Poured from a 12 oz. can. Has a golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of malts and grains. Taste is crisp, malts, a touch of hops, more flavor than just about any light lagers. Feels light in the mouth and overall is a cut above for this style."

"O: Very refreshing, very easy to drink, and very enjoyable... The low ABV makes this beer very sessionable and the lighter flavor and mouthfeel make this a great summer beer."

"To me this beer basically sucked as a “beer experience” as I don’t see the point of a micro-brewery creating competition for Coors Light, Bud Light and Amstel Light; this was on par with a macro brewed light beer, and while the flavor was above average I just don’t understand why this beer exists. If you like this style then go for a Budweiser or another beer that you can find in a 7-11 or any gas station across America. This may seem like a harsh review, but it based on principal more than flavor. Perhaps this is helping Cisco fund it’s other beers as that’s the only reason I can think of for producing this drink."

"While my score isn't that high, it just comes down to reviewing to style in this case. Still, this isn't not bad at all!"
""
""
"The body is nice and light with good carbonation. I can't help to compare this to the big boys. Yes, this is a light lager but there's a heck of a lot more flavor to it. Not a world class beer, but one I'm sure I'll enjoy around campfires in the summer."
"Tastes like the smell but with a good dose of bittering hop. More grainy than I like. The body is rich for the style--carbonation is low. One of the best light beers I've ever had, but it's still a light beer."
"The first time I had this was in Sconset during an unexpected, and much needed, weekend of relaxation with close friends."

"Lightly sweet grainy nose with subtle noble hopping. The grain flavors are rather husky, almost a bit stale, but it ends up with a touch of citrus and a very dry finish. Pretty refreshing actually; the attenuation seems to be key here. A tangier hop presence than you might expect, and a much tastier experience than your average light lager delivers."
"This was a surprisingly flavorful and very quaffable Light Lager and seems like it would make a super sessionable selection for the spring and summer months. This beer was a great choice to put in cans."

"12 Oz Bottle - Oct 7, 2007. Aroma is a gentle, light sudsy barley kernel and toasted almond. Subtle, soapy and with leaf. Pours a heavily opalescent pale gold, straw inflected, with rocky white head above. Flavor has three nice movements, first a bubbly fresh plain, clean malt, mingled with some Cascade hops and general resin and sugar. Then a faint whiff of bready yeast, doughy and creamy. Good middle body. Finishes off with a long, unexpected draw of hops, in good tones of Cascade and other west coasters. All around I was impressed by the body, drinkability and flavor of this beer. The hops are very enjoyable, the yeast character desirable and helping and the smack and body full and refreshing. Good stuff!"

"Overall, it's a good light lager--definitely better than anything Anheuser-Busch manufactures--but could use a bit more liveliness."
"Golden/yellow with a large amount of head but it drops quickly and leaves nothing. The nose contains hay and grass. A lot of freshly ground pale malt as well. Flavor is grainy malt almost like eating malt out of the bag. Finishes grassy with some subtle lemon. Bitterness is light but gets extremely dry after a while. Smooth drinking beer. Crisp and refreshing at first but it makes me want to keep drinking it to stop the dryness."
"D - Not impressed. In the least. One of the worst craft beers I've tried. I never thought I'd drink something this poor from Cisco, which has become one of the best breweries in the New England in just a couple years. This is BAD, though. Enough to turn me away from the brewery as a whole, for quite a while. There's no reason a brewery of this quality should produce a beer this bad."
"This is a light beer? Wow. I'm pleasantly surprised. Blows away most micro lights including the much touted Sam Adams Light. I'd buy a case of this as a summer brew. I highly recommend this, and at 3.8 percent ABV it's highly sessionable."
"O: This tastes okay and is very easy to drink."
"O: Very drinkable overall and sadly have never seen this in the Pittsburgh area and so thanks to Okey for bringing this one to my attention."
"I received a biker pour, so only ended up with a thin skim of whitish bubbles topping my pale gold beer. It had a bit of haze and the head left some fine, spotty lacing on the glass. It had a grainy, cereal flavour, fairly sweet, with mild bitterness and a hint of toasted malts. It was also slightly fruity and there was slight citrus to the flavour and aroma. The nose had a grassy, fruity quality with fresh grain character and hints of spice. Light bodied, but not thin, medium to high carbonation, off-dry, decent texture. This was decent for a light beer, much more flavour than you get from a typical BMC light beer. It may have helped that this tasted really fresh as well."
"Sampled on May 29, 2011. It has a straw yellow pour with a bit of a fizzy, white head that settles down in typical light lager fashion. Lots of sweet malts, corn, and grain on the nose. The body is better than many lights. The taste has this vague bitterness with a weird mixture of sweetness and grains. A decent enough light lager."
"I suppose it is pretty nice for a light lager. The plastic hint off-flavor bothers me at first but it seems to fade with time."
"D: The beer is very easy to quaff because it isn't very filling and has a low amount of alcohol."
"Thinner in flavor, but watery. Flavors continue throughout the drinking process. It is ok, and very different from others in the style. Pizza beer, maybe grilling beer, but that is about it. Not bad, but why go here? Buy a single, not a 4 pack/6-pack."
"D: Very drinkable, the flavors were not overwhelming and neither was the alcohol. The flavors mixed well and it was a decent light lager."
"pours a not quite clear golden color just over a one finger head that faded to a thin cover over the beer and a fair amount of lace. smells like a pilner and has a better taste than any light beer i have tried but did leave a little after taste. light body which i expected and carbonation was good. easy to drink and on the dry side. but a little high priced at 10.99 for a light beer."
"Ordered a pint at Pour Judgment in Newport out of curiosity. Man I was disappointed. This beer was all Ringwood character with a bit of diacetyl and oxidation. There was a mild bitter kick, but this beer was also a touch acidic and without much actual malt character. I'd avoid this in the future."
"In summary, I'd be willing to buy the brand again but not at an $11 price tag when a brand like Prima Pils can be purchased at a lower price. The romance associated with a connection to the glamour of the Nantucket name doesn't automatically command a higher price unless the product is a superior one."
"Looks good... smells like feet... tastes like fish... nice and fizzy... tastes like socks... I give up on Cisco. Either their beer erupts uncontrollably from the bottle, is over-hopped, is over-yeasted or tastes like fish that have rotted in somebody's running shoes. With all that money on Nantucket you'd think they could produce a decent beer. Feh."
"I give an average rating to this one, but I see where they're going with it. I likes it better as I got to the bottom of the glass, in fact. Still, though, the only thing light about the beer is the feel, which is fine, but the flavor is quite strong and maybe too bitter for such a light feel. Strong taste of salt air and steamed clams, and I'm actually not just saying that because it's brewed in Nantucket. It really tastes that way. Probably would be delicious with steamers, but I don't have any to hand."
"Drinkability: If I was at a BBQ, and was planning on drinking a few, I would gladly consume a few of these!"
"Very drinkable,nice beer."
"On tap the the Corner Tavern in Boston. Served in a sharp looking glass, looked to be more than a pint. Thin white head. Slight peppery smell. Overall nice flavor, not very hoppy, but with enough malt to satisfy. I found it to a bit thin, but since it's a Light beer, I would assume such. Very low abv made this brew extremely easy to drink. Could easily be a nice session beer. One of the better ""light"" beers I've had in a while."
"D: Easy to drink with some character. Accessible, but basic. A good BBQ beer, or for sporting events in the hot summer sun. An easy cross-over beer for friends who drink macros."
"The appearance is a yellow tone with a two finger sized white head. It had a smell of yeast and light sweetness. The taste was light and easy, nice to go along with the warmer spring weather here in new england. Mouthfeel is basic, not complex, but solid for the style. Due to abv and consistency, it would work well as a session beer."
"Beer was served a darker hazy straw color, with a filmy white head. Decent head retention and a slight bit of lacing. There wasn't much to the nose other yeast - perhaps some slight hops but I really had to look for it. Taste is definitely heavy on the yeast. There was a biscuity flavoring to the beer though on the finish you could pick up some hops. Light on the tongue, decent carbonation. It goes down easily, though I felt this beer fell a little flat."
"Notes from: 3/17/07"
"This is a really good light beer. The color is light, but not as light as a Bud. Just more amber than golden. There is not much of a scent to it. What really counts is the taste, which is very good. And the fair amount of carbonation makes the beer feel tight and refreshing. The combination makes this beer very drinkable."
"Served in a standard pint. This one was a gusher; glass was 98% foam, 2% beer. Four inch bright white, volcanic head that formed lots of jagged peaks and crags as the eruption slowly subsided. Lots of sticky lacing on this one. Brew is a translucent golden-yellow. Nose is clean and mild; only a faint wheat scent is detectable. Taste is also clean; more light wheat with a nice well-rounded balance of citrus and hops with a slight bitterness at the finish. Mouthfeel was nicely balanced between body and carbonation when served in my pint; however, a pull straight from the bottle revealed way too much carbonation. Good drinkability; very flavorful and refreshing for a 3.8% abv."
"expected a light lager, but WOW it was a nice thick lager! Great thick head that stuck, nice aroma, extra flavs not typical of a light lager thats for sure. thick pour for a lager too! Refreshing, and delicious when I was expecting mediocrity. I may have found a new favorite Lager"
"Pours a clear light golden color, rapidly diminishing soapy white head, clingy lacing left in the glass. Smell is clean, malty, slightly bready, some citric hops. Taste is crisp, grainy, faint lemon rind, mildly bitter hop presence. Really crisp and refreshing, but does not skimp on flavor. This is a light beer? Can't believe I ignored this one for so long, considering how much Cisco I've drank these last couple years. Drinkability is off the charts here..3.80%?!?! Love it."
"This summery offering poured a yellowish amber with a fair white head and good lacing. It smells like wonder bread and it sort of tastes like white bread with a touch of citrusy hops. A little peppery. Nice for a light beer. Refreshing and not too watery. Very easy drinking, of course. Better than most any light beer I would say but not something I would go out of my way for if I was looking for flavor."
"D: Very smooth drinkability and nice flavor. Would make a good lawnmower beer though flavor is nothing outstanding it still good for what it is."
"Poured a light amber, a bit clouded, and with a good head to it. Definitely had strong citrus undertones. Im not a big fan of White beers but this seemed pretty balanced. It reminded me a lot of Harpoons UFO. This beer was nice  Id buy it again but wouldnt go hunting for it. Ill try it as a summer beer next time."
"Pours a clouded gold with no head. Nose is subdued citrus with a grain quality to it. There isn't much to the nose though. It is rather light. Flavor is a slight bit hoppy and a fair bit earthy. Overall kind of toned down from something that seems like it could be a whole lot more. Feel is standard stuff. Overall it is drinkable, sure. I wouldn't say it is overly interesting, and definitely not worth the price. Nice, but not worth walking more than seven feet out of your way for."
"Overall- A very pleasent lager. A good, sitting at the bar during the summer, beer."
"I also have this in my fridge at home, and it's nice to have on a warm work night watching the game. Pours, and tastes just as good from the bottle, as it does from the tap. Not easy to find in it's four pack, but worth picking up if you see it."
"D: Tasty, goes down very easily, not filling at all, could use a bit more of a kick, but its perfect when you want something light. Its well-worth drinking on a hot day and youre not looking to get too hammered."
"Drinkability: very easy to suck this down as it is light and has a mellow lemony flavor. For a lite beer, this is much better than any macro lite beer you may try."
"Good to try, maybe have on draft. Prolly wont drink again because not my pref style."
"The beer poured a slight hazy yellowish straw color with a clean white head. A light lace was left down the pint glass. The inviting presentation gives way to an equally impressive taste. This beer smells floral with malt sweetness. There is a nice pale malt smell mixed with some fruit and citrus. You can certainly pick up the hop under tones. Good carbonation and mouth feel. Rather light but not watery it certainly has a good balance of flavors. Nice pale malt balanced out with the mild tone of hops. The hops leave a nice bitter tone in the back of my mouth. This is a smooth and very drinkable beer. No freshness date to be found on the bottle but it tasted perfect. This one is a very easy drinking session brew. I am glad I found this one and I am looking forward to enjoying more Cisco brewery products."
"Poured a pale cloudy gold with a small head that dropped quickly. Mild honey and malt aroma, with a hint of floral hops. Taste is light and lemony, hopped but not overly so. A very easy drinking beer, and a nice alternative to macro, if it's available."
"good drinkability, might be a little better in the summer months. not lager-like though."
"This beer may come the world's smallest tap handle. The darkest ""light"" beer when it comes to a rich amber color. Much better than Sam Light. A well balanced from Nantucket. Incredibly drinkable. Since it came out of a tap I'm not sure how ""light"" it is for calorie crunchers. Refreshing and perfect for summer."
"Overall a very drinkable blonde ale. Light and refreshing. An excellent summer beer."
"Clean & crisp, very flavorful for a light beer. Plenty of nose hops some fruity esters mostly pear. Light straw colored. Very drinkable, refreshing. Small batch brewer's flaws usually stick out in lighter offerings. Hats off to Cisco for producing a real winner."
"Pours a two-finger white head that fades to a thin layer leaving some lace. Nearly clear light amber color. Good carbonation and light-medium bodied. Skunky nose. Starts mellow but hops increase to finish with some bitterness. Not your usual light. $1.50 for a 12 oz bottle from Capital Convenience Concord, NH."
"A cloudy golden-straw color with an agreeable, frothy head describes the appearance of this brew. Theres a rustic, malt and yeast smell thats framed by a mild floral hoppiness. Also present is a faint citric, grapefruit aroma. In all, the smells pretty agreeable, its just a little faint. The taste is pretty sweet, with a nice malt foundation. Hops take over by the finish, though, which is solidly bitter and dry. Despite being a light-bodied brew, this one has a creamy texture to the mouthfeel. It doesnt have the clean taste that I expected, given the style description, but its a very agreeable beer. Very nice flavor, and well balanced. I enjoyed it more than I expected that I would."
"The beer pours a hazy gold color with a thick frothy white head and a ton of yeast floaties. The aroma is decent. It has a nice pale malt scent that seems a bit earthy (maybe the yeast) along with a mild hop aroma. The taste is average. It has a light pale malt flavor that is overpowered with citrus hops. It goes down slow, because of it's bitterness and finishes dry and a bit earthy. I like the use of hops, but I think this is a little too much. The mouthfeel is decent. It is a low bodied beer with adequate/good carbonation. This is an average beer at best. Please leave the light lagers for the big three. This is one for the scrap heap."
"Bought this as a single, due to the previous review. It pours an off golden color, a little cloudy. small to no head consistent with lighter beers. It smelled like a domstic light beer to me, but after sampling, it had more taste and mouthfeel that I thought. The drinkability of this beer is ok. Has a very faint taste, a bit fruity, with a tad of a bitter afterataste. I'm not a huge fan of the ""lighter"" beers, so this beer was just ok to medicore. As the previous reviewer stated, it does taste a bit towards the Sam light spectrum."
