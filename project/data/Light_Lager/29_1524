1.92,14.3,2.25,2,1.75,2,2,"I'm going to try to give this an objective review. Why? I don't know. Maybe it's out of a sense of duty, given the connection I have to this beer through my college experience. Well here goes.... Picked up a single 16 oz. can at the corner gas station. Pours in to a Craft Beer Exchange pint glass with a thin, fizzy head that dissipates almost instantaneously. The exceptionally pale, translucent, yellow beer affords a good look at the bubbles streaming to the surface. Without them, it would appear completely lifeless and stale. I was going to talk about the aroma, but there is none. I accidentally dipped my nose in to the beer while trying to get close enough to detect...anything. Traces of pale malts and a vague ""beer"" smell. That's about it. The taste? Almost nothing there either. It is so mild and nondescript that I would hesitate to label the flavor. Perhaps a faint aftertaste of creamed corn. With a watery mouthfeel, average carbonation and an exceedingly thin body, it makes you wonder why. Why would anyone voluntarily buy this? Why even bother? I guess the answer is found in my college dorm days. My roommate's dad worked for Anheuser-Busch, and the college was located just outside of St Louis. So, if you use your imagination, I'm sure you can envision that this was NOT a good combination for a freshman living out of state. I managed to wallpaper the entire ceiling of our room with the case labels. But, as cheap as each 30-pack was, it exacted a much higher price in the form of poor judgment, embarrassment,  and legal fees for my drunken escapades. The moral of the story? Drink this beer only if it's free. But be prepared to be completely uninspired, possibly nauseated, and maybe even arrested.","JohnnyI","Mar 08, 2015"

Cracking open the top and listening to the hiss of the carbonation, I'm immediately transported to a land of verdant, rolling hops and ice cold mountain streams.  Indeed, this is a beer meant for kings and gods, that much is apparent from the outset.  A routine pour reveals a beer steeped in ineffable majesty.  The cascading, golden lager results in sumptuous suds, with a head that literally begs for a deep, long drag from the dry gulch of the thirsty everyman. Beer meant for men, and not much else needs to be said.  Brewers can do it right, or do it wrong, and Natural Light hits a slam dunk every time.  I love this beer more than I love pizza.","mickeyswasp97","Feb 13, 2015"

I could barely finish the can and could not drink another until I had 4 16oz of PBR. It was that bad. The color really looks like faint yellow piss, what head the swill has flattens in seconds, the immediate taste is watery beer and the lingering flavors are of aluminum and morning breath.

Defiantly not the worst beer I have ever drink but sure leaves room for improvement.","ArchimedesSox","Sep 22, 2014"

2.5,48.8,,,,,,"I purchased it in the cans and put in the fridge for the nephews who like it (they ""pick things up and put them dowen"") since it's low calorie and they're on the younger side of beer appreciation. I had one cold from the fridge and found it quite inoffensive. In fact so devoid of anything that it was quite refreshing, like Busch, or water, and I can see how it would be a good session beer, and why it's popular with the frats. No smell, no taste except a quick crisp carbonation that quickly dissipates, no odd aftertaste (I'm talking about you Narragansett) , just an easy 4.2% ABV beer. It's like stretching out for the real game, or coming in the the home stretch after.  No offense.  No foul. Lots of descriptive reviews here making up offenses, but really it is almost as inoffensive as Ultra Light, where you suspect it is take calories out of your body, like some kind of flavor vacuum. In fact I'm so content with its neutrality I'm upping my rating to a true beige medium of 2.5.","familyguy2010","Sep 19, 2014"

Immediately after being let up by the smell and appearance, I was put down by the taste, but then brought right back around by the feel. A very peculiar experience for me, but overall this was a very decent beer (especially for the price).","JosefBerger","May 23, 2014"

Actually a decent amount of lacing was seen. The aroma is of grains and a hint of sweet corn, The taste is right up from the with corn first followed by the grain. Lots of carbonation that is excepted, and common with Bud products. Actually, the taste wasn't that bad and with no bitter aftertaste.","BeerWithMike","May 13, 2014"

Probably the blandest looking beer that I have ever seen. The smell...corn adjnuct. That's it. Literally, THAT is it. At least it smelled like something though I guess. The taste is of the lightest rice I have ever tasted, And perhaps some rotten asparagus?. Terrible. The mouthfeel is just a bunch of fizziness. The mouthfeel actually completely lacks flavors of any sort, Although with this beer, It isn't a bad thing! I'll give it a two simply for getting rid of those flavors!. Overall, This is THE blandest beer that I have ever had. WHY buy this? PBR is just as cheap and actually is pretty good.

4.05,141.1,3.5,3.5,4,4,5,"Being a blue collar worker in this weak economy I have been dealing with stress and having to budget like never before! This cheap beer takes care of both of those things. We all know it's one of the most lower end American beers you can buy, but I have drank several generic brands and this one does the job best for me when I want a good buzz at an affordable price. I typically prefer the 6 pack 16oz cans but sometimes stock up on the 30 pack lol. The smell is light, the flavor while watery is still good and makes it easy to drink. I have been drinking this beer for almost 3 years now and it makes me feel good after I've had my share lol. It doesn't give me a hang over or head ache either. Like I said I am more about affordability then quality right now and don't consider my self a beer connoisseur. I'm happy with my Natty Light, sitting on the couch with my girl, watching netflix. Call me cheap, I don't care. Natty Light rocks!","AstroMike","Feb 11, 2012"

So -- yes, if you want a tasty, crafty beer, stay away from Natural Light. But if you want a beer that is light -- meaning, one meant for playing 36 holes of golf or sitting on the deck, looking at the Betties while still making meaningful conversation -- then Natty Light is a good choice. I would rank it higher than Miller Lite on taste alone -- and it's cheaper. So if you play a lot of golf or entertain a lot of Betties, this beer is for you.","IJReilly","Dec 15, 2009"

It smells of corn, rice, and filler. It has a faint bitter/skunk taste, not from hops. This isn't because I got a skunk case--it's part of the beer's flavor. Honestly, its very watered down which makes it easy to drink, but the taste just isn't there so its difficult to enjoy.
