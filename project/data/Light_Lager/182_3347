To that question I would say it is a superior product.  Because it is yuengling it has a better color than the flavor would suggest.  Has a pleasant and present flavor (not a given in this style).  Smooth if not interesting.  Very good beer if you want something really light and pretty cheap.  Maybe too much for lawn mower beer but perfect for a summer cookout with the boys that goes all day and night.","BigH75","Mar 20, 2015"

There is some flovor at first but it goes away fast. The after taste is like water. I was hoping for more this brew but it is not there. Yuengling Light Lager is a good drinking brew nothing bad at all. I just thought there would be more flavor. But I guess it is smooth because of it's low abv.

Between this and other light beers I suppose I would still pick this over Bud, Miller, Coors, etc. But one point of disappointment that I need to raise is the exceptionally low alcohol content. With an ABV of only 3.2, it's a failure. Seems like the brewery's idea for Yeungling Light is to water down the regular beer while still charging the same price for traditional pager. I'm not going to get skinny drinking this, I'm just going to have to pay for more drinks to get a buzz.","dtreindl","Jan 12, 2014"

It has flavors of bread, grain, malt, and just a touch of hops, and it is somewhat more bitter than most run of the mill light beers. Where I live this sells for $5.99/6 pack (bottles) and is actually a bit less than Coors Light and some other light beers. While not particularly good, this light beer is very drinkable and a somewhat better choice than other cheap beer options. Also, with its low ABV, it makes for a decent session beer for someone with a low budget.","DeFaz","Jun 30, 2013"

3.05,7.8,3,3,3,3.5,3,"12 ounce bottle. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours a clear light amber color with a half inch off-white head. The head didn't stay around for too long, and there's a small amount of lacing. Aroma is sweet malt and corn, not much to this brew at all. It's not a bad aroma, but not great either. Taste is the same as the aroma, it's all sweet malt and corn. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, it's smooth, a bit slick and goes down easy enough. I'd have to say for the style of beer this is, it's average. I've certainly had a lot worse. It's not offensive at all, and for the most part I think it's more enjoyable than most light beers I've had in the past. Not that I would make a point to seek this out, but it's really not bad.

There was no lacing evident throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, nutty, and floral. The flavor was of sweet malt, nutty, floral, and water. It had a light feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this was a fairly average brew. While there wasn't a whole lot going on here, it really wasn't bad either.

After a recent band practice at my home, I found a couple bottle of the Light Lager left by my sax player. So, watching the game the other night---POP. First sip out of the bottle was a shock---watery. Really watery. So I poured the brew into a pint glass. Hey, looks like Lager---nice color. Drank it down and this is my view on this beer: Take a reg Lager---add 1/4 cup of water=Light Lager. I wasn't fond of this beer. Watery taste, watery mouthfeel. Not a beer I would ever want to drink again. Stick to the real deal Lager.","DJED69","Apr 07, 2011"

As a version of their standards that satisfies the calorie-conscious ('99 Calories', says so on the label), I'd say it isn't bad at all.

A nice inch of ecru foam on top fades becomes a cap leaving sqiggles. Smell is fairly simple, wait im being to nice, this actually smells like hay and faded barley with a hint of corn. Taste is a step up though. If you had a yuengling this is the same just toned down a notch, or they put less corn in it or something. Feel is light like the name implies and the carb is crisp out of da can. I would not go out of my way for this but a good one to go for if your in a pinch, or if your extremely broke at the time, hence, why I purchased this.","BARFLYB","Mar 20, 2011"

Faint malt, caramel, and lemon grass flavors. It's a light beer so it's light on flavor but at least it's a light beer with flavor. Very light in body with a nice dry finish.

Has a bit of the smell of Yuengling regular, a quite noticeable sweetness. Taste is where things go wrong. Too much carbonation up front, like seltzer water. Behind it there is not much taste, just a watered-down version of the 'normal' beer. The flavor is pushed to the background. I'll admit that this is different than the BMC lights - it doesn't have the skunky and metallic flavors - but that doesn't make it better.","biteme398","Dec 22, 2010"
3.61,27.6,4,3,3.5,2.5,5,"As is virtually always the case with light beer, this tastes very much like the full calorie version with extra water. Since the full calorie version is a very good (though admittedly somewhat simple) beer, and there's no such thing as a light Bock or IPA or even a light Hefe Weisse (at least not that I know of), this is naturally one of the best light beers I've ever had. Ok, really THE best. There are years between my rating this and the former champ (Amstel), so I'm not sure if my number rating will reflect that. Anyway, its like Yuengling Traditional only lighter and waterier. Color is still brown, though paler than the Traditional. Head is basically nonexistent. Smell is slightly malty, just barely detectable hops, and generally cleaner than the Traditional since it comes in a brown bottle instead of a green one. The taste still demonstrates a recognizable malt character (its actually maltier than many a full calorie macro like Miller), the hops are the same tasty combo of Cascade and Cluster found in Traditional (thanks for clearing that up Alstrom Bros), though obviously weaker. Mouthfeel is slightly on the watery side, though compared to other light beers its unusually substantial. Drinkablity is as good as possible for anything that contains alcohol. The taste may not produce a symphony in your mouth, but its clean, pleasant, and very substantial for a light. Combined with its light easy drinking nature, you definitely have something you could drink all day. This gets an A+ for light beer, maybe an A- for a cheap American brew you can buy anywhere (if you live on the east coast like me), maybe a B- when rated among all beers. Yes I've got a sentimental bias in favor of Yuengling products, but this is still exceptional for a light beer.","casualbeerman","Dec 22, 2010"

Pours a dark golden color, thin head.. looks pretty good for a light beer. No aroma to this one. Very light bodied, slight lacing on glass. Watery mouthfeel to say the least, but there's a slight hoppiness in there and definitely has at least SOME taste. Extremely drinkable and goes down easily, especially with the lower ABV. As a beer overall this wouldn't rank very high, but in the 'light beer' spectrum this one is pretty good.

I would love to be able to recommend a low-calorie, low-carb counterpart, but this just did not have the Ooomph to cause me to do so. There was a light sweetness on the tongue. The finish was pleasant, which a lot of Light beers CANnot say, and even a little dry, but overall it was a lesser experience. Tood bad.

It has a sweet taste to it, sweeter than the Traditional Lager and Premium, but the sweet taste is almost artificial. I think the best way to describe it is to go from drinking regular coke to diet coke and not enjoying the difference.

Lots of visible carbonation and very clear consistency. At least the tone has a decent reddish tint. Smell was full of grains and not really much else, slight hint at a caramel or sugar sweetness but very slight and only as it warmed. The taste was a little musty. Grain, corn, and grass flavors were the big players here, slight amount of caramel trying to come through but never really made it. The feel was very smooth, decent body, not as light as some others. Overall it had a bit more of a flavor profile then some of the others did, but still needs a little work. I actually liked this slightly better then the premium lager, go figure.

Taste is more of the smell with much less character than their regular lager with a bit too light for myn taste. finish is also light with little of anything to be found.

3.2,13.1,3,3,3,3,4,"The color is a dull gold with a big head that dissipates quickly but leaves a little froth all the way down. It smells of faint barley. The taste isn't bad for a light beer. There is a little malt presence, not hops but no corn, rice or adjuncts either. It honestly feels about what an all malt lager fells like rather than a light beer. Overall its easy to drink and one of the best light beers out there.","MSchae1017","Jan 05, 2006"
3.28,15.9,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,3,"Poured a yellowish amber color with small head of foam that dissipated very fast and left no rings or lace whatsoever. The only good part was all those carboantion bubbles in the pilsner glass. The only aroma was that of faint malts and hops and nothing else. The taste was very crisp and clean with a slight malty aftertaste to it. I thought the mouthfeel was kind of watery and light, but not as watery like most macro light beers. Overall this was an above average light beer with more taste and better mouthfeel than most light beers. If you want a light beer and can't find Sam Adams light, then this would make a nice substitute.","AltBock","Dec 08, 2005"
3.6,27.2,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"My first offering from Yuengling. Poured out to a deep yellow / orange color with a small white foamy head that calmed down to a thin layer of bubbles over the surface of the beer. Medium level of carbonation. Aromas of brewery fresh ingredients was very enjoyable; malt, hops and grain were all light but notable. Taste was a definite step up from your typical light lager; flavors of lightly roasted malt, rich grain and some tea like lingering taste went very well together. Mouthfeel was pretty good, with the carbonation adding some crisp, zesty character. Good drinkability. I would have this over any other light beer out there today. Recommended for Light beer lovers. Special thanks to OldFrothingSlosh for the sample.","Frozensoul327","Dec 05, 2005"

1.42,-49.8,2,2.5,1,1,1,"Drinkability - I don't want this again, ever. I could use it as a session beer, but at 2.75 abv, I might as well put a drop of Kirschwasser in a big glass of water. That would taste like water and get the same alcohol in my system. Since the carbonation numbs your mouth, it could be eaten with bad food. Some one could serve it at their dinner party to conceal the fact that their cooking tastes terrible. Other than that, this is best left on the shelves.","mrasskicktastic","Aug 08, 2005"

Aroma is nearly void, so I can't rate it as awful. Some faint grainess is barely noticed. Mouthfeel is very light bodied, with lots of crisp carbonation. Taste is watery and fizzy. Slight notes of caramel malt are easily balanced by subdued hops bitterness.

The imported swills included Corona and Konigsburg. Instead of leaving and embarrasing my family, I took this as an opportunity to try some beers I had not had in over two years. I wish I had just left. I drank this straight out of the bottle, so I had no real sense of its appearance, but if the smell and taste were any indication, it would be weak. There was no aroma to speak of and taste was bland at best. In simplest term, this brew is worthless.","longpondbeerman","May 28, 2004"

The taste is average also. It is light, dry, and musty with a very watery grainy malt make-up. It goes down easy, but lacks any real flavor. The mouthfeel is decent. It is an extremely low bodied beer with good carbonation. This is an average light beer. There is nothing special here. I found this to be dryer than most.

Mouthfeel: Watery thin spritzy carbonation, can't believe they produce this beer.

2.46,-13.1,3,2,2.5,2,3,"This beer poured a caramel/amber color into the glass and was crystal clear and well carbonated. The head that was formed when vigorously poured was off white in color and lasted only a second then quickly fell to nothing not even a ring on the edges. No lace was resent. The aroma that came from the glass to be honest was a weaker version of the regular lager. I nosed light toasted malts, and some citrus hops. Again faint in the nose. The tastes that came over my tongue were light as well, some malts (sweet and roasted), light caramel, grains/husks, hops, and some bready dough as it finished. The aftertaste was light and wisps of corn and malt came forth as it warmed. The body was light. I am not a fan of the lager and choose not to drink it, the light is actually better and more easily drinkable. Not the greatest beer, but in a class of light beers this one stands above the rest.","Jarod","Nov 12, 2003"
