Then the fruit went away (quickly) and I was left with a tingle as if I just drank plain seltzer or Club soda. Vile stuff!  I don't drink those flavored sparkling waters or Vitamin water etc, but I imagine this is what they taste like. I would have rated this 1 but gave a little extra for at least having a tiny bit or fruit aroma. Barely.","TommyTheHat","Aug 16, 2014"

I prefer lighter sweeter beers. Michelob's Pomegranate Rasberry beer has been my favorite staple beer for years! I love this beer! It's light, sweet and refreshing. Perfect for hot summer days. If I am camping or at a friend's BBQ and plan to be drinking for hours on end, this is the beer I bring. Most hard core beer snobs will cringe at this, but I love to add orange juice and make a beermosa with this beer. Like I said, this beer isn't for everyone and I expect many to turn their nose up at any beer than is light and sweet, but if this is the style your taste buds prefer you will enjoy it.","Anni","May 25, 2014"

Nose was a bit too perfume-like for my taste, certainly of raspberry, but much too sweet, almost like chemically-engineered esters than anything natural. Mouthfeel was thin and watery with a fizziness like pop and a really sweet flavor, again more like pop than beer. It has usually been my experience that raspberries impart a tartness in beer, not the sweetness that this had. Maybe it could be blamed on the pomegranate, but it was just a beer for people who really don't like beer. Finish was still much too sweet for my liking.","woodychandler","Jul 24, 2012"

There aren't any ""beer-like"" aromas, but it does have a nice fruity smell. The brew tastes like slightly watered down pomegranates and raspberries. Mouthfeel/body is light and watery, it has moderate carbonation, it's smooth and it's easy enough to drink. It's an OK fruity drink, but it seems more like a malt beverage than a beer.

It's fruity crap for people who don't like beer and therefore they should be drinking a Mike's Hard Lemonade or rum and Coke. Nevertheless, it's a pale pee color with a large white head that disappears very quickly. It looks like apple juice with a periodic bubble escaping to the surface. Smells like fruit. I drink a POM pomegranate juice from time to time and I eat raspberries and I suppose those odors are present. Along with a faint, faint stink of lreally light beer trying to poke through. It doesn't taste bad it just doesn't taste anything like beer. In fact, I pick up on just about no beer qualities whatsoever. Nonexistant malt, hops, or anything you'd find in real beer. It's water-thin and very lightly carbonated. Overall it's closer to a fruit juice than a beer. It's easy to drink, though. This is children's beer if there ever was such a thing.

The flavors were at first sweet, the fruit extracts hit me as decent but then it all went south. Stale grain and stale corn. No pomegranate flavor can be pulled out of the raspberry syrup that is stomping all over it. Hops and malt are quashed too. Mouthfeel is very fizzy and a little rough, the body light.

Seltzer water carbonation rules the palate, lightly flavored a liquid Pez candy or Jolly Rancher aspect. The artificial fruitiness isn't sickingly sweet, to its credit,but that's about the only thing to recommend it. This might make a good beginner beer for someone who has never had an alcoholic beverage, making me think this is marketed for underage drinkers. Give me some fruit syrup and seltzer water and I could produce something very similar in taste. This Ultra is very forgettable. A waste of money at any price.","merlin48","Jun 22, 2008"
