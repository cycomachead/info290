This is literally watered down Bud Select. Pours a fizzy yellow golden color with a highly carbonated quickly fleeting head, leaves sparse speckled lacing on the sides of my glass. Aroma has cooked vegetable, corn, generic beer nose, no actual hop component with a bit of metallic character going on. The first sip has a watery non discrete grainy quality with some more of the cooked corn rough husk quality, no herbal no hops just generic mass produced beer flavor. Ferments out to only 2.4% alcohol this is a glorified non alcoholic beer. Labeled as premium light beer, I'm just surprised that it's only 55 calories the only other drink other than water that I've had on a regular basis has been Gatorade G2 at 45 calories.

It tastes like a bit of sweet malt, but there aren't any offensive flavors. Mouthfeel/body is light and watery, but that's to be expected for this style of beer. It's really not hard to drink at all. I was expecting the worst when I tried this brew, but I was pleasantly surprised. I hate to admit this, but if someone gave me a bottle of this, I'd drink it (not that I'll ever buy this again).

2.47,56.3,3,1,2.5,2.5,4,"Had to buy this just to say I've had it. Poured from the bottle into a pilsner glass, beer is as it appears in the clear glass bottle; a very light golden yellow with lots of fizzy bubbles on the glass and comprising a large, foamy white head. The nose is virtually non-existent, what is there reminds me slightly of vomit. If AB was going for the absolute closest to water you can get and still call it a beer, they've hit the nail on the head. Goes down just like carbonated water with only a very slight whisper of Budweiser at the finish. Overall a very drinkable beer because again, how drinkable is water? Very! I'm sure this will get beat up bad just because it is an AB product, but honestly... could I get some beer with my beer???","gmfessen","Nov 08, 2009"
1.51,-4.4,2.5,1.5,1.5,1,1.5,"Pale yellow. Fizzy carbonation. Almost no smell. No tase at all. None. Tastes wet with some bubbles. This beer is completely pointless. I'm not one of those snobs who thinks there is no place for a mass produced yellow beer. Sometimes you want a simple cheap lager that you can down all day. But even I can't defend this. If they got it down to 55 calories, what is it made of? It's not even that drinkable because it is so boring. It's like drinking a case of bottled water. You probably could, but why? If this is what you have to drink in order to drink beer, you don't like beer.","lester619","Nov 04, 2009"

1.28,-19,1.5,1,1.5,1.5,1,"D: I could drink this all day long which should be reason for a score of 5. However, the fact that I would not be buzzed combined with the illusion that I'm drinking dirty water lowers the drinkabilty score to 1.","TCgoalie","Nov 02, 2009"
1.03,-34.8,1.5,1,1,1,1,"Overall - Just an awful beer. I'd rather have a beer belly than resort to this crap ever again. Not to mention the "Drunkability" was an F-. I drank 4 of these in a 2 hour time period, no buzz, nada. All I felt was a full belly of club soda with maybe a shot of real beer. Please, unless you are a light weight don't even waste your time on this terrible excuse for a beer. YUCK!","Beerman420","Beers"

1.88,19,2.5,2,1.5,2.5,2,"Drinkability depends how you look at it. The sessionability is ridiculous so in that regard yes it's drinkable. On the other han I like to consider the flavor profile and whether it brings me back for another sip. In that regard, this is easily the most boring beer I've ever had. I've found more enjoyment and flavor in nonalcoholic beer. Just really a bad gimic beer and it's sad to think that this will pass as beer to the masses.","Goliath","Sep 20, 2009"

Very light tasting, almost like a non-alcoholic beer with a sourness in the finish. Watery with seltzery carbonation. Another low alcohol diet beer with no flavor.

3.15,99.4,2.5,2.5,3.5,2,4,"So there it is. Not particularly good, but particularly easy to ignore. Bubbly as all hell. Simple to drink, but who drinks lame beer to not get a buzz at 2.4%? I don't get it much. One scenario could be if you have to show up at a party with bad beer you can drink a number of these and then drive home a-ok. Though normally, if you want something fizzy and low in calories reach for a Diet Pepsi Max or a Coke Zero, those are pretty good.","vacax","Sep 11, 2009"

I must still take my hat off to Bud. Their marketing department is awesome. If they can get people to buy this they should use thair powers for good and maybe bring peace to the Middle East or get Lindsey Lohan to eat a damn sandwich. It does, however, get the extra 1/2 point because you could probably replace water with this stuff and still maintain life. Hell, it's more sanitary than most people's tap water.","RomaniIteDomum","Sep 08, 2009"
