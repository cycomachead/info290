"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a light golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell has some faint malts, not much else. Taste is malts, grains, some crackers, more flavor than most light beers. Feels light in the mouth and overall not bad for a light beer."

"O: This beer is really easy to drink and quite flavorful when compared to other beers in the style, especially since you cannot taste any adjunct malts."

"""Abita Light: For when you want a light beer, but don't wanna look bad amongst the craft beer glitterati."" I'd use it. Anyway, this stuff pours a clear straw topped by a finger of relatively short-lived white foam. The nose comprises light biscuit and a hint of what may or may not be grass and flowers. It's all decidedly evanescent. The taste brings in more of the same, with a slightly sweeter biscuit character and a flower component that's almost completely detectable. The body is a hefty light, with a light moderate carbonation and a wet feel. Overall, an okay little thing, better than other light lagers out there (however much that says), but still nothing to write home about."
"O - Abita's Light beer is definitely steps above your normal light macros. While I'm not a huge light beer fan (I try to grade to style as much as I can), this one is definitely worth it if you want an easy-drinking, low-calorie, lawnmower beer. For what it is and strives to be, it does a fantastic job."

"For a light beer, I don't think it gets much better."

"M: a bit watery"
"Taste has a pleasant hop flavor that is pretty damn nice, floral almost. Graininess is there, but oh so faint. This beer tastes light a light macro, without the grimacing 'twang' usually associated with such. Its quite good for a light lager, but it really does not have much actual flavor. If you were a light beer drinker and money was no object, this beer is for you. Personally, I dont think the price difference between this and a rack of 'stones is close enough to justify purchasing on a regular basis if pounding light beers is what youre into."
"12oz bottle. Pours golden hue with a lasting white head and soda like carbonation. Nose is light herbal hops and sweet biscuit malt. Light, very crisp body. Light hops, sweet malt combine on the palate. Light finish. Not a bad brew for a light beer, but it is still a light beer."
"Abita Light pours to a pale golden color with a medium sized spritzy head formation and a faint touch of malt in the nose. There is a very light amount of malt in the palate, along with a faint hint of the creamy nutty flavor found in Abita Amber. The beer is fairly clean overall and benefits from the lack of adjunct flavors. Unfortunately, the flavors here are too light for my taste. In the finish, a very subtle kiss of hops is barely perceptible. The beer finishes on the watery side."
"Overall: My new favorite in the style and I do like this beer. This is way better than BMC and Sam Adams. This does have way more flavor than most in this style and would be one to reach for in hotter weather. I tried scoring this to style, so as a beer overall, take off roughly .5 in each category."
"Pours a golden yellow color with a thick white head and a little lacing. Smells of barley and maybe pale malts. Tastes of malts, a strange hop bitterness that flows away quickly, and some bread. Mouthfeel is medium and drinkability is okay."
"Pale yellow in color with a fizzy white head. Head has good retention. Kind of a musty smell. I may even smell some grassy and spicy hops which is nice for the style. Pale malts and grains in the flavor. Hint of a spicy hop bitterness but it is faint. Weird dry aftertaste. Hey a light lager with flavor, it can be done. Light bodied with good lively carbonation. For a light lager this is a pretty good one. Sam Adams is my favorite but I wouldn't turn this down."
"RJT"
"D: Overall a pretty good light beer.... another good beer from Abita."
"D: As far as light lagers go, I wouldn't say this is especially drinkable. Don't get me wrong, this is easy to drink, but most macros would be even easier ot throw back."
"Overall it was on the watery side, but that's to be expected for a light beer. Much better than a Bud Light, and to me a very above average light beer."
"Not much here - could be mixed in with so many other light lagers. Could be a quick thirst-quencher in the heat, but so could so many others. It's 119 calories, if you are watching (which isn't particularly ""light", compared to some other light beers), but is light on everything else. If ""light"" is your choice, I still think Sam Adams has the most character of the style."
"Drinkability: easy to quaff. This beer has a bit of flavor that puts it above some others."
"Nothing more than you're typical american lager, very disappointing."
"Wow, for a light lager this is very tasty! Has a light maltiness and a light hop bit to it. Way better than any BMC light lagers. Really clean finish a good amount of carbonation, very smooth drinker."
"Pours a clear, golden color. 1/3 inch head of a white color. Good retention and decent lacing. Smells of grain, pale malt, yeast, and slight citrus. Mouth feel is smooth and crisp with a high carbonation level. Tastes of yeast, pale malt, grain, and slight citrus. Overall, another light lager that is slightly better than average."
"Drinkability: Water-like refreshment. Thirst: quenched! Above average for a light lager, but, even the best light lager is still a light lager."
"Overall-one of the better light beers out there."
"I was skeptical at first (with all light branded beers), but this on is darn good. Recommended for summer session drinking."
"Not much to say in terms of atmosphere. Pretty typical light beer look (pale, heavy carbonation, and no lacing). Nose is decent for light. Non-distinct flavor, but not bad. And feel is non-offensive. Decent quaff. . . given the style."
"These go down extremely easy and I can see this maybe being good to have for a tailgating party but not much else. I have to say if you found yourself in such a situation and everyone around you has Coors and Bud Light, etc, Abita Light might be a pleasant surprise. It is definitely more enjoyable than your typical light macro but sadly this is still just another example of an Abita beer that seems geared more towards people who don't drink craft. For a light beer, not too bad...but for beer in general, this is nothing I would drink unless I found it left over from a party..."
"Appearance is extremely light gold with a thin, white head. Smell is yeast & sweet corn. It has a strong yeast flavor with a hint of some kind of grains. There's a sort of odd metallic aftertaste. Mouthfeel is crisp but it ends with a smoothness. The Abita Light is OK for its style, but it's really no different from most macro lights--little flavor and not distinctive."
"D: goes down easy; but man I want a better beer"
"Better than most light beers, but not my style."
"The aroma is faint with some corn malt. The appearance is straw gold with a thin head. The flavor is like the aroma and metallic. The palate is surprisingly smooth for a light. As light beers go this is certainly drinkable but it hardly has much tastes."
"I'm sure there are those down Louisiana way who are counting their calories and who would rather drink locally than follow the herd and drink the infinitely nastier national brands. More power to them."
"Mouthfeel was good and the body was light. As with the Andy Gator, this beer is best served cold and keen for a humid summer day, a BBQ or hot tubing. A good alternative to the rice/corn macros."
"Taste: light body, extremely crisp mouth feel, grainy taste with almost nothing else, just hints of hops"
"This brew pours a slightly hazy bright yellow with thin bright white head which quickly dissipates into nothing. No lacing at all as the brew is sipped down. Practically no aroma - perhaps a barely detectable hint of malt but no noticeable hop profile. Very light and almost effervescent on the palate - very crisp. Flavor is light malt with well balanced bitterness. Finishes very clean and somewhat dry. This isn't the best beer by any standards but it does have much more flavor than the average macro light brew. Superior quaffibility - great for picnics and barbeques or perhaps after mowing the grass on a hot summer day. Good beer for the style."
"Pours out a slightly hazy pale gold with not much of a head. Really subtle, faint aroma here with a touch of grain and some malt sweetness. Refreshing not smelling any adjuncts. Flavor is all light, honey sweetness with just a touch of a weird rubber quality (may be past its prime). Faint floral hops are in the background. Nice. Mouthfeel is light, but not too spritzy. Extremely quaffable with no offensive quality to it really. Light on flavor, but what's there is really nice. Up there with Shiner Light in terms of awesome light beers."
"Appears a fizzy light beer ultra pale lighter than apple juice golden straw color with a bright white vibrant head forming. Lacing that is left behind is thin and rare between sips. Aromatics light biscuit and two row cereal notes refreshing but no real hop character going on. Flavor fizzy pale lager with some creamy cereal grain sweetness and spring water mineral zing to the finish really crisp clean and smooth as in carbonated mineral water. Mouthfeel is light and airy pretty much light fizzy carbonation and sweetness sticks to the sides of the palate after each finish, no hop burps either. Drinkability is much like any other macro yet I have much more integrity drinking something out of Louisiana that is really pushing the craft industry forward as well as catering to the masses."
"Gold colored beer with a head that is gone in seconds.Taste is a light watery corn taste.Look this is by no means the greatest tasting beer, it is what it is..a light lager.It's gonna win no rewards but it seems like a decent beer to have on a hot summer day.I would drink again,mostly at a summer outing of some sorts."
"The first half of the beer took a little getting used to, then the second half smoothed out."
"D- Its ok to drink it and you can drink plenty of it because its not a heavy beer. the taste is not so overwhelming because it is a light beer. You can drink plenty of them but i say drink only one just to get a taste of it then do away with the rest because they just are not worth it."
"Decent refreshing beer, EH."
"D-Overall this is a damn nice light lager....I would say it is one of the top two or three light lagers I have had. Scores are relative to the style category."
"Pours a pale yellow color, with a small, quickly dissipating head, and no lacing (poured from a bottle into a pint glass). This beer has almost no aroma whatsoever, with a slightly malty taste. The taste is better than most light beers on the market today, and slightly stronger, too. Malty taste to it, with a slight taste of hops. Very light feel in the mouth, with a good amount of carbonation. Considering the style, not too bad, but not a beer I plan on drinking again."
"I don't know why I even tried this since I don't like light beers. I do, however, like most of Abita's beers. Actually, not bad for a light beer, but I prefer something with more taste. Golden color, quickly dissipating head, not much lacing on glass, and little aroma. I guess if you have to have a light beer, this is as good as any, but that isn't much of an endorsement, is it?"
"Part of a sampler. Poured from a 12oz bottle with bottled on date on the back label. It was a clear light golden color. It had a small head that quickly went away. The smell was the typical light beer smell and didn't impress. It was a tad more skunky than Lite or Bud Light. The taste was pretty much on par with those beers as well. It had a slightly stronger finish than them but otherwise same shit different glass. Wouldn't seek out but if stuck in bar and forced to choose between the usual macros and this I'd probably go with this for variety. (2.5, NA, Tie, N)"
"Pours to a thin white head and a bit of lace. Pale yellow color with slight haze and strong carbonation. Aroma is very weak malt and slight noble hops. Flavor is lacking a punch but not bad for an all-malt light beer with 119 calories. It is slightly sweet and has a nice carbonic bite. Finishes clean (no real aftertaste). This is what pale lo-cal light beer should be."
"Abita Light: Clear, golden, bright white head that drops shortly. Very minor lacing. Malty and fruity in the nose and the mouth. Much more flavorful than your average light beer. In fact, it's more flavorful than some American macro lagers. A little bit sweeter, but that's not the point. It appears to be all-grain, or at least close to it. Mild hop flavor and supporting bitterness. Well-balanced! Really nice! One of the best light beers I've ever had, but that leads me to ask, how light is it? There's a lot going on in this beer considering it's ""light", so just how many calories does it have? And what about carbs? Honestly, I don't care myself, but it's good enough that I have to ask. Well done!"
"The mouth benefits from crackling carbonation. This is an easy drinker, better than the big 3s offerings. Went well with my oysters!"
"Overall a decent light beer. Better than a macro, but not on par with Sam Light."
"Pours a pale yellow with a small head. Smell is virtually nonexistent...maybe a little grassy hint, but not much. A very light, watered-down, taste with no real kicker; I can't really come up with a suitable reason to drink this beer. While it goes down very smoothly, there's nothing at all that stands out about this selection from Abita."
"Overall, a beer that poses as a microbrew but has no true distinction from most commercial light beers."
"This beer was not bad for a light beer. Suprisingly drinkable, give it a try."
"Aroma- what aroma? None to speak of. Flavor- light malts, light hops, very inoffensive, but it really was lacking in both. It went down smoothly, clena and refreshing, and it was superior to the Bud Light that predominated the festivities, but I tried it- moving on!"
"Clear pale gold with a small, white, foamy head that slowly diminishes to wisps of film. Some light lacing. Smells of grain with some very light grassy hops and a corny funk. Hmmm. The taste is crisp and... rather corny. Man, I expected more from Abita than a very macro-like light beer. However, it does finish remarkably clean and is quite refreshing. So as far as light beers go, its not actually all that bad. Not terrible, but nothing all that good either."
"Pours a light straw color with a thin white cap. Smell was almost non existent with lightly sweetness and grain. Flavor was more of the same, lightly sweet, with a slight more than expected bitterness. Not much else besides that. Carbonation was high with light body. Refreshing beer."
"Overall, i dont like what abita and some other micro breweries are doing by making a light beer (instead they can make an ipa) but i totally understand what they are doing, and that's fine. This is never one i get a six pack for, but for what it is, it ain't bad."
"Considering the range of light beers from microbreweries, this isn't a bad one, though there's little that stands out about it."
"Very pale yellow with a flufy head. A little honey sweetness in the aroma. Light flavor with some honey. A slight spiciness made this seem like a lightly flavored hefeweizen almost. Light bodied with medium carbonation. I was a little skeptical with this, but I was very pleasantly surprised. This would make a pretty nice beer to enjoy a few in the summer heat by the pool."
"The beer pours a pale gold color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is average. It has a grainy pale malt scent along with a dry, musty lager yeast aroma. The taste is average as well. It has a light and grainy pale malt flavor that goes down easy and finishes slightly dry and musty. It tastes better than some macro brews, but that's not saying much. Micro breweries shouldn't waste their time with these beers unless they're going to add something special to the taste ala Sam Adams. The mouthfeel is decent. It is a low bodied beer with good carbonation. This is an easy drinker, but I still don't get the point here. If I wanted a light lager, I'd drink Michelob Ultra. It's one and done for me."
"Now I cannot get through a macro light like coors or miller, just awful, so really this isn't bad for the style. Not the most drinkable....light beers are just not drinkable to me, this doesn't taste as dishwatery as the others though. Not something I need to drink, but in the future when my gut crosses the border of another state I will revisit."
"What's up with that? N'othin' much...that I know of...if lightness in texture, body, and everything is your aim, this is your ticket. But because of that, count me out."
"Notes: very overcarbonated and almost tasteless brew"
"Perhaps the only light beer not to get worse as you drink it. Poured a perfctly clear yellow in color. Slight head that vanished altogether. No nose, but it's not supposed to have one either. Flavor is slightly malty with bits of maize hinting around the edges. Not much to this beer but definitely one of the more drinkable light lagers I have ever drank. Mouthfeel is light and crisp. Thanks to BigLove for this beer."
"thanks to biglove . from the bottle, poured a light golden with a small white head. aroma, malts, hops, corn, hints of yeast. flavor, not to bad for a light beer got some malts and yeast, and hops. had a nice clean finish. would be good on a hot day."
"<Mumbling incoherently> I actually think I could drink this beer. Pretty darn tasty, if I do say so myself, taking style into consideration. Recommended, especially if you're looking for a light beer. Well made."
"Twist off bottle provided by BigLove, ala BIF20. Thanks for the opportunity! Freshness date is ""2" and ""25", consumed in mid-July 2005. Pours a pure white 'soda pop' head of big bubbles that quickly burst to leave a headless yellow liquid with a couple of carb streamers. Smells of tiny Saaz hops with some hay beneath. Malt sweet is present, but without a defined grain. Tastes...thin. Well, it's a light lager, what else is to be expected. Malt sweet is present, as is a tinge of honey and muskmelon (some people call it canteloupe...it's the melon with yellow skin and orange meat). Hops are Saaz tiny and have almost a corona character about them. Hop bitterness is mild, but hard to really tell due to excessive carbonation. Light body and so heavily carbonated that the salty and acrid bubbles that form on my tongue are part of the taste profile. I'm going to swirl to release some gas and have another go at the final half of the glass. Okay, now it's pretty much a flat version of the earlier beer. The sweetness stands a bit stronger and the hop flavor has faded a bit. Although the hop flavor is not as intense, I find it much more floral and pleasant without the excessive carbonation. Scores from my review are juding it to style of Light Lager."
"Puchased as part of variety pack.poured a slightly cloudy amber color with large white head. Smell is very light with very slight hops. Taste is refreshing and offensive. Mouthfeel matches with little that impresses. Easy to drink on a hot summer afternoon."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1/2"" bright white head above the almost clear, light yellow/gold brew. Head is down to a small layer of bubbles pretty quick, with average lacing. Aroma is pale malt sweetness, and more intense than you usually find in a light beer. Taste is dominated by that pale malt sweetness, tempered by some light bitterness. Little to no aftertaste. Mouthfeel is smooth, but watery, and drinkability is great, although not unexpected for the style. All in all, a nice brew to style. The style doesn't leave much room for excessive flavor or other superlatives, but it's good for what it is. Highest ratings for a light lager that I've given."
"I should note that the spouse has lost interest in her quest for an easy drinking lager. She's a doppelbock, dunkel weizen, eisbock lady these days. She merely nodded and said, ""Not bad"" when I offered her this beer."
"Notes  I am reviewing this as a light beer, not in line with my opinion of beers in said style."
"it leaves a sweet corny aftertaste that is not all that pleasant. it's a noble effort, and i would much rather pop a sammy light. still wondering why this beer is top rated."
"The final bottle of Confederate BIF from Biglove, Abita Light was poured from the stubby brown bottle into a Pilsner glass, in which it looked pale golden, clear, and fizzy. The aroma was very mild and mostly grains and malt with some lemony yeastiness. The flavor was much better than most light beers. Had a malty, honey-lemony-sour taste, and a slight hop bite. Definitely did not have that watered down, somethings missing taste that I was expecting. Refreshing."
"Comments  I know this style is poo-pooed by most, and Im certainly not a big fan of light American lagers. Having said that, this is one of the better examples that Ive had. I owe a big thanks to BigLove for sending me this gem."
"This is very good for a light lager, I'm assuming this is because it isn't an adjunct light lager or at the very least adjuncts don't play a large role in the making of Abita Light. Smell is clean and grainy, with a touch of sweetness. Color is yellow, but less watery than most lights. Head is about what is expected for the style. Taste is grainy, no adjunct tastes here. This is very crisp and smooth. I would pick this as a good lawnmower beer."
"Grainy smell and flavor. Very crisp. Better than many common non-light lagers."
"Abita has entered the light beer world, and they've done a good job. Brown twist-off bottle, freshness date notched on the back label. Freshness wasn't an issue as I had it in New Orleans the same month it was released. I was told they had been testing recipes for a light beer for two years. Its color is perhaps a bit more amber than most light lagers, and that reflects in the taste. It's richer and more full than your average light beer. Only 119 calories, but in a blind taste test I don't believe most beer drinkers would think it was a light. Abita uses no adjuncts. I'm looking forward to my next trip there so I can do the brewery tour again and ask some more questions about this beer, but I think Abita is going to be very successful with it."
