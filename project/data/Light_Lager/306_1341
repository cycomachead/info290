If anyone at the party complains about the beer, let them know there is more room in the ice chest and point them towards the nearest store. Great for beer pong. If someone slops it on the table, no one is going to cry. If the morning after a party you go around your home and find a bunch of open, half drank cans, it's no big loss. Flat keystone light makes great snail bait in the garden. SEE! , your friends are getting a slight buzz AND you're saving your tomatos from pests. Another plus is that aluminum cans are profitable right now at recycle stations in most states AND my dog loves beer. I'm not going to waste quality suds on the mutt, but keystone light?

There is a mild bubblegum, corn and hop bitterness as it finishes with a touch of metal but over all its just water. It drinks amazingly easy with little carbonation, like water. It's not overly offensive so I don't feel I can score it lower than a 2, it's just water and very little beer.","KYGunner","Jan 18, 2015"

1.98,10.6,2,1.5,2,3,2,"Overall (2.12) - It may be the worst beer in my fridge but it's not the worst beer of all time. It gets a pretty bad rep but it has a few redeeming qualities. For a light beer it drinks smooth. It's not tasty, but I'll take that lack of taste over some of the over-hopped IPA "crafts" I've had.I think I bought this 12 pack of cans for around $8 if I remember right. If anything, the price is right. So you've got price and drink-ability as the positives, with pretty much everything else weighing it down. If Keystone Light is for you, rock it. But don't stop here. To do so would be a grave injustice.","The-Adjunct-Hippie","Aug 09, 2014"

It is the easiest of easy drinking beers. Keystone Light is the quintessential cheap light beer. If you want a cheap easy drinking light beer then this is the ultimate of that type.

3,67.6,3,3,3,3,3," If I'm low on funds and just want something light, Keystone Light is my personal choice. For under $20 here in northeast Ohio, I really dig that price when I'm in a light beer mood. As I've said in my Budweiser review, while I venture out into more exciting territories in the world of craft brew, I have the old standby. This just so happens to be my light standby.","Caveworm","Mar 10, 2014"

This is not a very enjoyable beer to drink (slightly over carbonated) and definitely not one that I would grab again - or have another during a session. I actually remember this being slightly better from my college days but that was a long time ago and I likely had forgotten some of the badness. Also, just to note that the flavor actual gets worse as it warms up so I recommend drinking it extremely cold and quickly.","dbrauneis","Jun 27, 2013"

That being said, if you are a strict light beer drinker, you might as well save some money and pick this up instead of Coors or Bud Light - flavourless swill is flavourless swill, so there's no reason to spend any more than necessary. Why Keystone Light and Busch Light aren't massively outselling their more expensive counterparts will always leave me befuddled. Ah well, a fool and his money and all that. Unfortunately, I'm the fool in this instance.","thehyperduck","Nov 18, 2012"

It is light yellow, minimal to no head. Smells like any other macro light lager, it tastes like Coors Light only a bit stronger with more hops. Overall a cheap beer to get the job done.","freditoj","Sep 30, 2012"

At the same time, incredibly easy to drink, those that say it is like water are not entirely wrong. Very watery, but at the same time, Very Cheap.

I give credit to keystone for brewing such a marketable, high selling beer. You must see that the reason this beer sells so well, is clearly not the taste, aroma, look or mouthfeel... its marketing, and easy drinking. You can give this beer to any college girl in america, and she'll probably drink it. Enough said, marketing campaign finished. Shameful but profitable.

It previously smashed most AALs (except Olympia, Hamm's and Old Milwaukee) in numerous head-to-head challenges (conducted in my apartment), so I wonder if it can hold up to its legacy? First off, the looks: The can is blue with silver and white accents. There are mountains embedded in the graphics, but they don't turn blue, so I cannot tell how cold the beer is. I imagine the beer inside the can is very pale yellow and fizzy, with a soda-like head. Of course, I would not actually pour one of these bad boys into a glass, that would feel like sacrilege. Sniffing around the can, I don't smell much except a faint floral jasmine rice note. The flavor is quite light, offering little more than a generally beery grain impression, light minerals and a hint of the aformentioned floral/rice note. Alcohol and bitterness are not perceived; crispness is. The feel is light, refreshing and has a sparkling mineral water sensibility about it. I still like this beer quite a bit.

No complexity at all here, I'm surprised at how much of an aroma there is, considering how flavorless I know this beer is. Even though there is an aroma, it's not a good one, it's sour, sweet and adjuncty. Wow, thats a bad taste, very sour, and the adjuncts are just through the roof. Frankly all I get out of this beer is adjuncts and carbonation, maybe a tiny bit of malt. That can taste really comes through too, and beats you over the head with grossness.

I can't tear Keystone Light apart, because it has flavors that were designed to be completely unoffensive and in tact with the most amount of people as possible.
