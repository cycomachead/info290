The aroma isn't really all that much, just a hint of roasted malts and caramel. Pretty much is said for the taste. Actually isn't all that bad and probbaly the best of the 'Ultra' Micks.

Pours to an light amber color with a nice head. Taste is thin but does have hints of an amber brew with a slight maltiness and a mild twang of hops. Carbonation isn't too high but due to the lack of backbone does override the flavor. This is definitely not a connoisseur's beer.

The flavor is similar; semi-sweet corn/rice flavor upfront, then faint malt character comes on and fades in the same instant. Nil aftertaste. Highly carbonated and thin bodied turns out overly crisp; but still not enough to hide the off-flavor. The finish is mostly clean but the taste seems forced and fake.

Mouthfeel was like having carbonated water sloshing about in my mouth. Could be nice on a wicked hot summer day, but on a early spring day in Detroit, it doesn't do much.

Nice light mahogany brown color, good clarity, fleeting but substantial head with a hard pour. But don't let the color fool you, there is little to no flavor here. As a homebrewer I can tell you that it is quite easy to influence the color of a beer without hitting the taste. It would not take much more than a pound of specially malted barley to color a large batch of beer. Homebrewers use these darker roasted malts in higher percentage to gain a roasted or caramel depth to ales and lagers. While quite clean tasting, I can barely perceive a toasted malt character or breadiness to this beer. Wearing a blindfold I would have a hard time distinguishing this from any light beer. Smell is sweet, and slightly alcoholic with a yeasty touch. Very little hop bitterness or aroma. Looks good poured in a glass so if you are shooting to impress someone with drinking darker beer, and can't stand something like a Sam Adams Boston Lager, choose this.","ahking","Feb 19, 2006"
