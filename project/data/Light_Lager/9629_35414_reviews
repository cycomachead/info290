"O-  This beer has a very light flavor and is a very clean lager.  There is not much Pils malt flavor compared to other competing flavors."
"it is a easy drinker but a full bodied beer"

"Was a gift from a employee of mine. Short's mix pack. Worst one but not that bad. I enjoy a lager after a long day."

"O - If they were trying for a crappy adjunct lager, they nailed it. It represents the style well. I just do not care for the style."

"A simple beer that can be appreciated by craft and BMC drinkers."

"I could drink this beer all day. Sometimes I'm in the mood for something that's not an in-your-face IPA or stout, and this is easy to drink, with a nice malty flavor and just the right amount of carbonation. Don't be fooled by ""light"" in the name, it is a full-bodied beer."

"Overall - fun alternative to the Big lagers, but nothing special"

"O: This beer seemed to be fuller in body compared to the light lagers made by macro breweries, but didn't have any offensive flavors in the taste or aftertaste."

"Drinkability: This is a very drinkable beer in the sense that you could pound a six pack without any problems. If you are at a tailgate and are wanting to drink several beers throughout the day, this would be an excellent craft alternative to BL, ML, and other domestic lagers. Not a beer that I would pick up when looking for a unique sensory experience."

"Overall: Great option when you don't want something too filling, but light and refreshing--great with a good burger; tried this as my first drink on my 21st birthday--not a ton of flavor though"

"The body is light but with some depth and feel to it. It's crisp and it's fairly smooth considering. it's clean for the most part but with a slight slickness coming into the end."

"O- The flavor got me! I really enjoyed it. This is a good beer for active summer activities. A unique take on a light lager."

"O - If the goal was to make an alternative to the Bud Lights of the world, I'd prefer more of a attempt at flavor."
""

"O- Given the style, it's pretty solid. I'd choose it over the usual suspects, given a decent pricing point. Probably a great lawn mower beer. That said, I'm not going to seek it out. Having seen it on tap lists before, I'd be confident in ordering it when I really want something on the lighter side."

"The beer is pale yellow with a half-inch of white head. The aroma offers corn, grain, adjuncts. The flavor follows suit. Light in body with moderate carbonation. For what it is, this is a solid beer. Nothing offensive, per se but also not something I new to try again. Aptly named."

"12 ounce bottle into lager glass, bottled on 6/19/2013. Pours lightly hazy pale golden straw color with a small fairly dense white head with decent retention, that reduces to a thin lace cap that lingers. Light spotty lacing clings down the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of cracker, bread, pear, apple, grape, floral, grass, and yeast earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance of malt, yeast, and light hops; with solid strength. Taste of pear, apple, grape, cracker, bread, floral, grass, and yeast earthiness. Lingering notes of light fruits, cracker, bread, grass, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a short bit. Nice and pleasant balance of malt and yeast ester flavors; with solid robustness and no cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and light bodied; with a very smooth and lightly crisp mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is well hidden with zero warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very solid craft brewed light lager. Nice balance of flavors with solid robustness; and very smooth to drink. A pleasantly enjoyable offering."

"Overall I thought this was an ok beer and very good example of the style, it was very true to style and it had all the aspects that I look for in the style, so far I would say there's hasn't been a Light Lager that I enjoy drinking more than this one. This beer had great drinkability, it was very smooth, clean, not filling, but the flavors didn't do the best job at holding my attention, but this style never does and as a session and all day drinking beer goes this is a good example of it and I think drinking a six pack through out the day wouldn't be a problem. What I liked the most about this beer was the how true to style it was, Short's didn't do anything crazy with this one, it's just a quality Light Lager the way it should be. What I liked the least about this beer was the appearance, I thought it was a little hazy for the style. I would buy this beer again when in the mood for the style and if I had a choice between this and all the other popular Light Lagers I would take this one for sure. I would recommend this to anyone who likes the style and it might make for a good brew to ease someone into to the Short's lineup. All in all I was happy with this beer, I love good craft beer as much as the next person but there's always a time and a place for a Light Lager and if I'm going to drink one I would prefer a quality one and that's exactly what this beer is. Good Job Shorts."

"Overall: this beer isn't super tastey. But it is extremely drinkable and pleasant for a light lager. Easily the best light lager I have had but I can't give it perfect ratings just because there is certainly room for improvement, although I don't know where in a light lager"
