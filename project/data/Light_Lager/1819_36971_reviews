"Would buy again, but probably would go for one of their other offerings first."

"Pours a pretty golden honey in color with about a half-finger of a white head. Some spotty lacing is seen that sticks to the glass. The aroma is of wheat with a touch of honey. The taste is even more flavorful with more of a honey taste. Crisp and smooth actually with a slight tangy finish. No bitter aftertaste. This is a good brew."

"Overall - not bad, like a macro, good lawn mower beer. This is my first in a sampler platter, hope it gets better :)"

"Mouthfeel is overcarbonated, obviously light-bodied, crisp and clean."

"Light bodied with ample carbonation. Not offensive, but not a lot to like either. I will pass on this in the future."

"O - This is an okay light lager. It is certainly better than most mass produced light lagers."

"If it finished smoother, I think this one could garner some more positive attention than what has been seen so far."
"Served as part of the eight beer sampler at Granite City in St. Louis Park. Color was light yellow and no foam by the time it arrived. No lacing. Not sure if there was a smell, it was light and mostly grainy if it was anything. Taste was crisp. Mild grain. Clean. Smooth. Perhaps a step above a BMC adjunct. Drinkable enough. Light mouthfeel and clean finish. Okay and average in all regards. It's advertised as their 'mildest' offering and that's exactly right."

"Overall - It's a typical ""Hot Summer Afternoon"" beer, one that you would drink after doing some yard work or when just grilling out with friends. It's not by any means great, in fact I'd say this beer is fairly bad, but you could do worse...not that you'd want to."
"The Northern Lights Lager had a bit of a bite to it. The beer pours a clear golden yellow with thin white head that dissipates quickly and did not lace. The scent included hop and subtle sweet malt. The taste I thought carried a bit to it. There was some sweetness...but not for very long, the hop really took over and left a sligth aftertaste. I thought the mouthfeel was light body, failry easy to drink. I preferred there IPA for a session to this however."
"Cooked vegetables in the flavor, red flag of DMS. Mellow and buttery, buttered corn and husky grains. Pretty bland with enough off flavors to dump the last bit of the glass. Not recommended, even for the dumb label. This is junk."
"D: Nothing special, however, it's quite enjoyable.  A good beer for this time of year, kicking back and watching some football on the weekends.  They go down easily, and can be enjoyed by a wide range of people.  "
"Finish: Little sweet caramel malts"
"Clear pale golden color with one finger of head that quickly settled to a film. Light lacing is left on the glass. Aroma consists of dry, cracker malt and some grassy hops. Very low bitterness which is not really surprising. The malt is dry and gives some decent flavor for a light lager. Just a little grassiness from the hops. Light bodied with lower carbonation than what is typically found in this style. Not as prickly and easier to drink. A nice beer but at this price I would prefer one of their other offerings."
"Body is light and highly carbonated, as it is supposed to be. Drinkable, nothing inherently wrong with it other than the lack of flavor."
"Pours a clear, pale yellow color. One inch head of a white color. Great retention and great lacing. Smells of yeast, pale malt, grain, slight citrus, and slight pale hop. Fits the style of a Light Lager. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp with an average carbonation level. Tastes of grain, pale malt, yeast, and slight sweet malt. Overall, a clean beer but rather average light lager."
"Drinkability is ok. I can see kicking back a few of these during a ball game with some friends fairly easily. They would even enjoy it."
"D- This was a drinkable beer. I think it drinks more like a german pilsner than a light lager but hey I'm not the one who makes up the signs at the brewpub. Nothing great but it's a good starter beer for the night or an inbetween beer to help cleanse the palate."
"Overall: This beer is slightly better than Pabst but nothing special. As with almost all the beers I've had from Granite City Food & Brewery in Kansas city MO. This beer is hardly carbonated & unbalanced."
"Overall it was a good light beer."
"Pours a clear corn yellow with a little to no head that bubbles down to nothing in less than a minute. Tastes a bit watery and has hints of adjuct corn and rice, finishes very clean with little to no traces of what came before it. Was cool to try a growler for the first time though."
"I was feeling pretty thirsty and figured this was worth a try during happy hour. I was pleasantly surprised, though, not that much. It is a light lager, but it resembles a nice all-malt lager. The malt profile is mellow and smooth with a lightly roasted barley taste and a bit of sweetness. Bold it aint, but it does a good enough job at having personality for a light lager."
"no medal: Tallgrass Light (Raccoon River)"
"Overall: Northern Light Lager is a very appropriate moniker for this brew. Run-of-the-mill pale lager that obviously fills the BMC macro gap for those that need it, I didnt."
"I would not drink this again. I didn't find any diference in this and your typical light macro. Give it to a buddy that will only touch Miller Light."
"The taste is all malt and corn and the strongest flavor of the beer. There is a bite to it from the hops that gives it a sweet and sour flavor to it. Much sweeter then you would see from a macro light lager. There really was no body to the beer and was lightly carbonated. I guess this was the beer to try if you like macros. Then why not just order a Bud Light?"
"Tasted On-Tap 05/11/05 at the Cedar Rapids, IA location."
"I never saw this coming, a chain brewpub featuring a light lager! Can you believe that?!?!? (end sarcasm) Clear gold color with a failry sizable head. Smell is clean, slightly malty, grassy in a way. Taste is very bland, good for the stomach ulcer crowd, maybe a little more flavorfull than BMC, but maybe not. Very well carbonated, and drinkable enough. Granite City sure let me down..."
"Drinkability: High points as this was the purpose of the beer. I can understand why they would brew this. They get one to have this and the BMC drinker likes it, and hopefully will try one of the other beers. My Bud Light drinking friend did have one, and then ordered another Bud Light bottle. Idiot."
"Pours a very clear, yellow with very little head or carbonation. A light, somewhat sweet taste, difficult to pick out any hops on this one. Watered down, but then again there is ""light"" in the name. Probably some marketing to get some crossover macro drinkers. Slightly above average."
"This light ale has a prominent buttery sweet aroma and flavor with almost no bitter quality and a bit of a watery body.  Not a bad go at the becoming-more-popular-every-day micro-brewed light beer."
