4.08,49.5,4,4,4,4.25,4.25,"Yuengling Premium Light Beer brewed by Yuengling Brewery, with an ABV of 3.50%  This brew pours out a nice amber color with a nice white head. The smell is nice with grains and malts. You pick up a hit of hops in this brew.  Now for the taste,  it is light, but bold with flavor. There is a lot going on in this light brew.  The mouthfeel is nice, clean, and refreshing.  There is nothing overpowering in Yuengling Premium Light Beer.  This brew has a nice balance to it.  Overall I'm going Yuengling Premium Light Beer a 4.25 out 5 I would buy this brew again.","nicholas2121","Dec 12, 2014"

PALATE: smooth, mega-drinkable; gassy, bubbly and brief in its substance...TASTE: astringently malty, thin, with a profile of a sweetened light beer; not memorable or substantial...OVERALL: as Yuenglings go, on the bottom rung; Solo cup filler, but much less a party staple than the original lager...","dacrza1","Sep 01, 2014"

The glass really helped with head retention and I had a little over a finger of creamy, bone-white head. Color was a pale lemon yellow with NE-quality clarity. Nose smelled heavily of cereal adjuncts. Blah! Mouthfeel was somewhat thin and the taste was fairly bland. I was definitely not impressed. Finish was likewise bland, watery and dull. This is one of my least favorite styles, even less than AMLs and AALs, both staples of The CANQuest (TM) and this was a pretty light example.","woodychandler","Jun 05, 2011"

You don't have to force me to drink Yuengling Light, for when I want lower ABV, so I can spend an afternoon putzing around on the deck, this beer more than adequately fits the bill.

Clean tasting flavor from front to back with a wimsy light malt biscuit background and a touch of grassy hops, I drank a good bit of this at my father in law's 50th birthday last year. It was hot outside and it just kept going down so smooth. Mouthfeel is light bodied carbonation a little too much pretty unnatural, crisp overall mouthfeel no metallic harshness.

3.08,12.8,3,2.5,3,3,4,". It turns out that "Premium" is a euphamism for "Macro". That's what this is, Yuengling Brewery doing a Macro style beer, as opposed to Traditional, which is well traditional (That's Amber American Lager, it was a style which was a much bigger pre-prohibition staple in America). Anyway the color is a sort of clear-gold. Not nearly as deep as say Urquell but noticably more amber than most macros. Compared to the Traditional its lighter and clearer. Smell is pretty boring. A little sweet grain and a lot of hops. The hops are kind of hard to describe. I guess I'd call them metallic or typical macro if I found them objectionable, but I don't. They're pretty bitter, but leave no unpleasant aftertaste. They're clean and surprisingly strong for the style, but still not too interesting. I guess the best way to describe them would be typical macro hops if typical macro hops were't disgusting. They are balanced by light malts that are slightly sweet. Mouthfeel is all about carbonation. Maybe this would feel thin if not for all those bubbles, but I honestly can't tell you. I could taste the beer fine, but carbonation was all the mouthfeel I could get. Drinkability is fine. You could definately drink these all night. The hops don't get in my way, the taste isn't bad, nothing is wrong with this except that no store or bar exists that carries this unless they carry the Traditional Lager as well, so why bother? This is obviously what Yuengling brewed to catch the Budweiser crowd.","casualbeerman","Mar 27, 2005"

The body is light and crisp on the tongue. Not unlike the aroma, the flavor offers very little. There's a delicate touch of malt and a backing bitterness, but nothing really stands out. It finishes as short and dry as it begins. It's not a bad light beer in comparison to many others, however, as it's clean and straightforward without any "odd" notes to it. It's simply watered down Yuengling Premium and that's fine. But for the 10 or so calories, I'd rather have the extra flavor in the standard version.","NeroFiddled","Mar 17, 2003"
