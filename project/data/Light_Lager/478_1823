No, it's not what I'd buy, and after a year and a half in Rochester, this was the first time I tried it, so that tells you something right there.  But if you go to a friend's house and they offer you beer, you drink it, and you don't make a big deal about the extreme inferiority of the beer compared to what you usually drink.  So my 2.whatever rating is an "outlier" - fine.  Okay, justified?","StrangerTides","Jan 25, 2015"

APPEARANCE: clear, golden body that releases sparse bubbles; off-white hand sloughs off to an uneven quarter-inch; soapy lacing... AROMA: some fragrant hops suggest a somewhat sophisticated premium lager; however, doughy malts make clear the beer's style... PALATE: reasonably, light, oily and watery consistency; highly drinkable and cleansing; as beers go, quite weak...TASTE: light hops tease faintly as flowers; malts suggest some beefy dough, but as expected, a lukewarm offering...OVERALL: perfect for a day of mindless drinking only, this is too weak to pair with food and not worth sessioning...","dacrza1","Jan 18, 2015"

Let's give it a whirl. This brew has a sweet Euro lager smell of spritzy hops. Pours to a pale yellow with a thin white head. Taste is consistent with the Euro lager smell. Very sweet and light with only a slight twinge of earthy hops evident. Mouthfeel is very thin but it isn't watery per se and that should be in line for a light lager. For the price you can get this for its a macro bargain and not at all offensive. It's not bold but it is quite drinkable. This is a lawnmower beer extraordinaire.","mooseisloose","Apr 27, 2010"

Almost no flavor whatsoever, and very little aftertaste. The body is thin. For the style I'm sure this is a typical example (thus my middle of the road score), but I'd hace to say there should be some flavor, otherwise it is pointless to drink this, it might just be that this beer is a good example of what is inherently wrong with the style of beer (made solely to easily get people drunk).","redmosquito","Mar 21, 2005"

The appearance is less than spectacular, a neutral yellowish water, with little head and no lace. The smell is very metallic, with some watery hops and malt in the back, but not much. The taste is kind of off, with metallic hints as well, and the first slight hints of skunkage. I'd normally use that as a reason not to review a beer, but I dont think this one gets much better. The mouthfeel is rather unpleasant I thought. Too much carbonation, and it left a kind of slimy feeling at the front of my tongue, and a bit of a chalky feel at the back. But its cheap, and its not entirely undrinkable. If you're gonna buy Labatt though, go with regular Blue. Its much better than the Light.","FranklinPCombs","Nov 08, 2004"

The head that was produced was pure white in color and was fairly full and cloud like. But this fell to a lifeless liquid in the glass with only a shadow y image of its former cloud self. To my surprise there was some lace left on the sides of the glass from the brief foam. The aromas were faint, I nosed some light overly sweet malt, grains (corn), 1 flower, and a metallic overtone. The tastes were as faint as the aromas, I got a watery sweet malt taste, more corn grains then I care to have, and a brief stab of citrus before it went dry. The aftertaste was  well  nothing. Light bodied. Overall impression was not that impressive. The can said light and they were right, light aroma, light flavor and a light impression of a beer. To be honest it filled the beer gap for me at 11:00 at night at my buddys house while talking. It was hot, I was thirsty, I got a beer, and it kind of quenched my thirst. I guess it did its job.

This is one poorly made beer that just over did it on the water and left out beer. Appears yellow and very fizzy (artificial carbonation), with a very thin head even when I poured it straight into the glass with no tilt. The bubbles are still rising from the bottom of the glass much like seltzer water, which also explains the mouthfeel of this beer. In the taste it is a very nasty watered down flavor that isn't sweet and isn't bitter it's just straight gross and unappetizing.
