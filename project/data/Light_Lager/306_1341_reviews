"From a distance looks like it would be like any other cheap beer. Simply put, it's not. This is by far the WORST beer I've ever had. Not worth buying, not worth drinking."
""
""
""
"It looks almost clear when you pour it and it is extremely watery and tasteless."
""
""
"My go to light beer."
"O- this is one of the most watery beers I've ever had, it simply has no flavor.  It's certainly a stretch to call this beer"
""
"Works for beer pong (but that's about it)"
""
"No words to describe this swill."
""
"Good to shotgun and that's about it."
""
""
"It smells, looks like, tastes, and feels just like Coors Light, but at half the cost! If you are having dozens of people over for a summer party, why not? If anyone at the party complains about the beer, let them know there is more room in the ice chest and point them towards the nearest store. Great for beer pong. If someone slops it on the table, no one is going to cry. If the morning after a party you go around your home and find a bunch of open, half drank cans, it's no big loss. Flat keystone light makes great snail bait in the garden. SEE! , your friends are getting a slight buzz AND you're saving your tomatos from pests. Another plus is that aluminum cans are profitable right now at recycle stations in most states AND my dog loves beer. I'm not going to waste quality suds on the mutt, but keystone light? Drink up Fido!"
""
"another watered down useless beer"
""
"it is worse than keystone ice and same thing, unless im playing beer pong im not drinking it."
""
""
""
""
""
"tastes exactly like seltzer water"
"Great party beer. Got me through college."
""
""
"Very Smooth. Great for all occasions."

"In Monty Python 's Live at the Hollywood Bowl there's a joke about bad beer being like sex in a canoe.....it's Fu@$ing close to water. That joke came to mind as I drank this. There is a mild bubblegum, corn and hop bitterness as it finishes with a touch of metal but over all its just water. It drinks amazingly easy with little carbonation, like water. It's not overly offensive so I don't feel I can score it lower than a 2, it's just water and very little beer."
"Not bad for a I have to drive somewhere beer. You can have a few of these and be more sober than when you started."
"PS. Daughter worked for Coors Market Development about 20 years ago.  Her insider info helped me pay off her college education."
"V - Really good value, stuff runs at like 12 bucks for a 30 pack."
""
""
"I would rate this beer a negative number if I could. Enough said."
""
""
"for when you absolutely must have alcohol, but have very little money."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I ended up with the last 2 beers in my 30 pack tasted light it had set out all night"

"Easy drinking smooth, simple, light beer. I personally like Keystone light. Its very crisp and refreshing. Rating it on what it is, an american light beer, its one of the best you can get."
""
""
""
"Seems to taste better when sipped from their camo wrapped cans."
""
"The best thing about this awful beer is its advertising.  Keith Stone is a riot.  Otherwise, forget it.  It's not worth drinking."

"I have tried most  of the macros. It gets a 3 if i enjoy it enough that i will buy it again, and if it isn't Something i would buy it gets a two. This is kind of bad"

"Overall (2.12) - It may be the worst beer in my fridge but it's not the worst beer of all time. It gets a pretty bad rep but it has a few redeeming qualities. For a light beer it drinks smooth. It's not tasty, but I'll take that lack of taste over some of the over-hopped IPA ""crafts"" I've had.I think I bought this 12 pack of cans for around $8 if I remember right. If anything, the price is right. So you've got price and drink-ability as the positives, with pretty much everything else weighing it down. If Keystone Light is for you, rock it. But don't stop here. To do so would be a grave injustice."
""
""
""
""
""
"The perfect chuggable light beer. This has got to be the smoothest, easiest to drink beer out there. It is also one of the cheapest. It is not harsh in anyway at all. It is the easiest of easy drinking beers. Keystone Light is the quintessential cheap light beer. If you want a cheap easy drinking light beer then this is the ultimate of that type. Enjoy."

"This beer was ok for a cheap beer. You could tell that it was a cheap beer when drinking it. I have had a lot worse cheap beers, so compaired to some that I have had this one was ok. If you do not want to spend a lot of money on beer then this is the beer for you."

" If I'm low on funds and just want something light, Keystone Light is my personal choice. For under $20 here in northeast Ohio, I really dig that price when I'm in a light beer mood. As I've said in my Budweiser review, while I venture out into more exciting territories in the world of craft brew, I have the old standby. This just so happens to be my light standby."

"Keystone Light is a brew made by Coors. Pours a light yellow color. With a small white head. The cam says always smooth and I will give it that. This brew is smooth. There is nothing bad about this brew. In my opinion this brew is better than Coors Light, this beer has more to it. I would get this over Coors light any day."

"O: Its not bad, nothing makes it stand out from other AALs I prefer others more then this one though."
""
"The taste was miserable, as was mouthfeel. I likened it to drinking an onion, and that may be generous. While the Steel Reserve I drank a few nights ago was almost undrinkable, Keystone is by far the worst beer I have ever had the displeasure of drinking. While Natty Light is not a good beer, it's better than this."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a clear straw yellow with a very small white head. Some light spotty lacing was seen but not a lot. Above average carbonation as would be expected. The aroma with very weak and is just some grassy grains. The taste is about the same and pretty 'watery' as would be expected for this one. Has a slightly dry finish. Overall, it wasn't too bad for a cheaper brew."
""
"Smells like coors"
""
""
"Drank this for a half a year as my go to beer. If you buy Coors Light over this you are an idiot and wasting your money it's nearly exactly the same. It's not like busch vs. bud where they use corn vs.rice, this is identical to coors light. That being said it's not remarkable and seems like it takes more keystone light to get me drunk than other lights at the same ABV"

"Overall – Nothing really good about it. Even for a light beer this one is a weak overall due to the sour and rather off flavors of the brew."
""
"Overall: Keystone light is not offensive. It has its place on college campus and with someone on budget. Keystone light worth the money saved on not buy higher e quality product like bud light , coor light or miller lite. Nope! The quality of coors light , bud light and miller lite way better then the cost saving of keystone light. I will not hate on keystone Light! It goes down smooth is what they say when it is watered down !"

"This is a typical economy-brand AAL. Not much going on with the beer. Inoffensive in the taste but there isn't really much for taste to begin with. It goes down smooth though and is cheap. To be honest, I couldn't tell the difference between this and regular Coors light. Since this is cheaper, I would probably go with this if your buying in this ""style"" of beer. Though, to be honest, even at these prices, its not really worth drinking in the first place."

"Well, this beer is cheap. for cheap beer it does have one good quality. It is pretty smooth. The marketing boys took about the only decent quality it has and markets the crap out of it. It is very liught yellow and very fizzy. it smells skunky and is pretty smooth going down."

"O: While the appearance is spot on for the style, the aroma and the taste border on the slightly offensive. This is not a very enjoyable beer to drink (slightly over carbonated) and definitely not one that I would grab again - or have another during a session. I actually remember this being slightly better from my college days but that was a long time ago and I likely had forgotten some of the badness. Also, just to note that the flavor actual gets worse as it warms up so I recommend drinking it extremely cold and quickly."

"Nothing too special here. Just a good beer at a great price. This is much better than big brother Coors Light. This actually has some flavor. Great for a hot day at the beach or river. Good for BBQs or after mowing the lawn...etc. As light beers go this is one of the better ones. Plus, Keith Stone is just cool lol."

"Final Grade: 2.49, a D+. Keystone Light is a totally forgettable light lager that I doubt I'll ever pick up again. That being said, if you are a strict light beer drinker, you might as well save some money and pick this up instead of Coors or Bud Light - flavourless swill is flavourless swill, so there's no reason to spend any more than necessary. Why Keystone Light and Busch Light aren't massively outselling their more expensive counterparts will always leave me befuddled. Ah well, a fool and his money and all that. Unfortunately, I'm the fool in this instance."

"If you are a in college/broke or both Keystone Light is a very good choice to get hammered for a very cheap price. At 1 dollar a can you can't go wrong with this beer. It is light yellow, minimal to no head. Smells like any other macro light lager, it tastes like Coors Light only a bit stronger with more hops. Overall a cheap beer to get the job done."

""

"O: It is what it is. A marketable, cheap and effective college beer. I drink this occasionally as a lawn mower beer. Its drinkability is what makes it so successful. Not something to seek out if you are a beer snob. If you're looking for a cheap drink, go for it."
""

"Beer flavored water. I kind of hated this beer. It's innocuous enough, but it's like a lot of America lagers, especially light lagers. There just isn't much to it. And I get it; it's not supposed to be Earth-shattering. I get that it's just a water-downed beverage to suck down on a hot day. Still, why would anyone buy this if other choices were available? That ... I do not get."

"Poured from a can into a lager glass. Pours a dark yellow with a two finger head. Decent head for the type of brew, But the appearance is nothing special. Smells of cooked corn and various other vegetables, and perhaps a little bit of rice. Average for the type of beer. The taste completely follows the smell, And brings nothing new to the table. The mouthfeel is actually above average for an AAL, The amount of carbonation goes very nicely with the taste, The mouthfeel is more comparable to an MGD or something of the like"

"Tried after Busch light at an anniversary party. This one I actually poured into a plastic cup. Light yellow fizzy beer with bubbles rising steadily. Smell was nigh on nothing. Taste was of light club soda and a little beerishness. Mouthfell also falls flat. Not recommended, ever."

"I have to say, as a University of Colorado Student, I must admit that I'm a bit biased, perhaps. Appearance: Don't really know, I suppose from beer pong I can say very light, practically no head near water. At the same time, incredibly easy to drink, those that say it is like water are not entirely wrong. Very watery, but at the same time, Very Cheap. If you are in the mood for some Beer Pong, go for it. Even in this modern age, very cheap and honestly Coors light is probably worse so go for it."

"no head at all on this bad boy. Looks like water mixed with 0.01 parts beer and has constitency of water. Drinks worse than water. no taste at all. no malts, no hops, no nothing. well, maybe some corn. i'd rather have a vodka and milk than this shit. notgood."

"O: I refuse to hate on this beer as others have, i tried my best, like a highschool teacher grading a student's regents, but i cant really say there is much to this beer besides being a frat house, beer pong swill. I give credit to keystone for brewing such a marketable, high selling beer. You must see that the reason this beer sells so well, is clearly not the taste, aroma, look or mouthfeel... its marketing, and easy drinking. You can give this beer to any college girl in america, and she'll probably drink it. Enough said, marketing campaign finished. Shameful but profitable. I cant respect it, but i can understand it."
""
""
""
"O - Again, much like the other macros, good for a shotgun party, beer pong, frat house, etc. The commercials are still humorous."
""
""
""
""
""
"Not much of an appearance with about a 1"" head that quickly disappears. Smells like watered down...water beer. Taste like a normal american pilsner which lacks much flavor or imagination. Really crisp and tastes pretty much how it smells and looks. Let's face it, this is a drinking game beer so leave it for the tailgates or beer pong. Unless of course it's free, then the ""free beer"" rule applies. I stay as far away from this as possible."
""
""
"Tastes the same, but with such little intensity of flavor that it is SLAMMABLE, especially considering the refreshing pop of the super-carbonation. The bigger the gulp the more enjoyable (this theory applies all the way to the 12oz-shotgun level. No small sips.)"
"O - If you're in the need of a beer for a case race or shot-gunning you've found what you're looking for....but other than that, meh."

"there's nothing too this one at all, I can't think of a reason for anyone too try this beer"
""
""
""
""

"O- Not much to this beer. Better than some macros but there is alot better out there. No real reason to drink this unless you like a smooth watery taste"
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I really don't mean to give this beer a clubbing, but holy hell was this the worst beer I have ever had. Watery taste, horrible smell, and little carbonation. At least it's cheap, but honestly, there are beers 10x better for jut 50 cents more. Save yourself."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"OVERALL: Definitely drinkable - that's what it's for. Beer pong enthusiasts and broke undergrads will enjoy this is as a refrigerator staple, but it won't impress the discerning drinker. Thee are worse light beers out there, but that doesn't change the fact that this is an unpleasant brew with few redeeming characteristics. I can't complain about the price, but I'd discourage friends from picking this up."
""
""
""
""
""
"Simply put, this beer sucks but it gets the job done but not really. This beer would pour out of the tap with absolutely no head. People may ask you if your drinking apple juice because there is almost no carbonation. This beer is a very clear with a slight yellow tint, close to pee colored and has almost no smell to it, closer to the smell of stale beer if anything. This is an extremely light beer almost tastes like somebody put water in it, in fact the only reason you could have your brew taste like that is if you did add water to it."

"Overall, it's rather nondescript, but it's unoffensive. The good news is there's no metallic off flavors that are so prevalent among macros."
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability - I'll admit it's smooth. But it tastes abysmal. Unfortunately I have eight more of these to drink."
"Overall- The really offender of this adjunct light is the smell. If you have the wits about you to hold your nose while taking a drink, consider it. Otherwise it is a typical adjunct light beer."
"Water with a slight beer flavoring. It has no head and no lacing and only a slight aroma of rice. It's a beer best kept for college students who do not have to money to buy anything else. It has no characteristics of a real beer. I'm using it to cleanse my palate in between reviews of more worthy beers."
"i was looking forward to enjoying a nice delicious beer but unfortunately this was the only beer my room mate had. after taking the first sip i could already tell how bad it was. throughout the entire beer, it tasted like an ass of a cheap beer (example: budweiser and busch). i recommend staying away from this beer at all cost."
"D/O: Reviewed to style. Here it is, review #400. ""If you're drinking light beer it isn't for the taste...Keystone Light has the least amount of taste in a Light beer...therefore Keystone Light is the best Light beer."" I've said this, over and over defending my late teen/early twenties go-to. This is the beer that tastes most like water, great for drinking all day, preferably in the summer sun."
"Overall – I guess you get what you pay for. Its very very light tasting. (and looking) I guess if you were trying to drink all day long, this beer would work nicely - it's very watery."
"It pours a pale yellow color, not very heavy at all nor does it have a good taste. Has a bad after taste and gives me headaches the next day."
"I'm convinced that for the low end light beers, Keystone Light is a solid choice. It's Coors Light's little brother."
"I didn't enjoy this beer at all, it really has nothing to offer."
"This is slightly worse than Coors Light, but I'm giving it the same overall score because it's slightly cheaper. If you're going to drink bad beer (WHY?), you might as well punish yourself with this because it's not significantly worse than Coors Light."
"I was pretty damn stoked when my local Publix started stocking this again. I haven't had it since high school, errr, college. It previously smashed most AALs (except Olympia, Hamm's and Old Milwaukee) in numerous head-to-head challenges (conducted in my apartment), so I wonder if it can hold up to its legacy? First off, the looks: The can is blue with silver and white accents. There are mountains embedded in the graphics, but they don't turn blue, so I cannot tell how cold the beer is. I imagine the beer inside the can is very pale yellow and fizzy, with a soda-like head. Of course, I would not actually pour one of these bad boys into a glass, that would feel like sacrilege. Sniffing around the can, I don't smell much except a faint floral jasmine rice note. The flavor is quite light, offering little more than a generally beery grain impression, light minerals and a hint of the aformentioned floral/rice note. Alcohol and bitterness are not perceived; crispness is. The feel is light, refreshing and has a sparkling mineral water sensibility about it. I still like this beer quite a bit. The best AAL I've had in a while, probably since Blatz."
"This stuff is crap. No flavor or feel. What's the point?"
"Taste is really watery, but has a bit of corn sweetness and is very smooth. Body is very light with lots of carbonation. Drinks very easily. Beer pong?"
"I could not resist. I typically only drink good or at least mediocre beer for beer pong, but I made the exception for both this and Natural Light. I will admit, if I had to drink one of the two, I would drink this again. That is not to say it was even decent. It was simply more than what I was expecting. If I have a choice however, I will never touch the stuff again."
"This beer has a sticky, sweet corn taste that is very unpleasant. The medium to fast carbonation also leaves a terrible lingering stickiness on the pallate. This stuff makes Coor's Light taste like the holy grail of beers...enough said."
"O: this beer is pretty much just water that happens to get you drunk. if I rated drinkability I would give it a 6 out of 5."
"Pours a clean pale yellow, with a white head. In the aroma, a small sweetness and almost skunky. In the taste, sweet malt and a small hop, but overly watery. A small carbonation like bite and light bodied mouthfeel, with a small dryness in the aftertaste. Standard domestic, thin, watery, and lack of flavor. I wish I could make a joke about Keith Stone, but I cannot."
"The watteriest of the value brands. When times are hard, this may be one of your only options. I would recommend a Busch or Natty above this. Zero head forms to trap zero smell and taste. Do not dirty a glass and just drink this from the can... quickly."
"Coors Light's twin. Its all in the packaging....right?? The color is yellow and clear with good carbonation that results in a white foam head that dissapates quickly. Smell and taste are primarily grain with attempted balnace of hops, etc. The beer is easy drinking and light."
"Overall: This one drinks like a non-alcohol beer with its sweetness. It is actually somewhat surprising that it is 4.2%. Not horrible for the style, but I would certainly choose lots of beers over this."
"It is what it is and it gets the job done. The job being inebriation."
"O: It is what it is. Gatorade for the alcoholic."
"O - Besides a complete lack of aroma (yeah, it's ice cold. we did it a favor) it's not a terrible brew. It'll quench a big thirst but it's certainly a recipe for a big hangover."
"Overall I can't think of a more boring beer than this one, at least the bad tasting ones try to achieve something more than just water. I completely hate this lack of attempt at anything except for being ""smooth"" (which means like water I guess)."
"Overall Drinkability - EXCELLENT for what it's supposed to do. But I'm having a conflict of interest simply rating it in style. It would get all 5's that way, and I just think that's shameful. I'll just have to make a blend of the beer rating and the style rating."
"Edit: A ""D-"" is still better than an ""F"!"
"this beer is easy drinking if you can get past the god-awful notes in the nose and flavor. Other than that it is unimpressive and not even worth a try. Its one high point is price, I guess."
"I tried this beer on May 10, 2011 after purchasing from one of my local LCBO outlets. The beer poured a translucent medium gold colour with almost no head. The aroma was sour grains, and skunk. The mouthfeel was watery with medium carbonation. The flavour was weak grains and an acidic aftertaste."
"Taste corn and grain mingled with metal and a stinging carbonation, finishes dry. Goes down easy, but why bother? This is smooth but unimpressive."
"Overall I'd recommend it for frat boys on a desert island, but not for craft beer enthusiasts."
"O: Not a terrible beverage. I like this a lot better than other drinks, just not other beers. It is a shame to be called a beer, but much more delicious than say a Coca-Cola, Dr. Pepper, or Pepsi."
"There is no reason to get this beer at any price."
"Overall-This is a good beer to drink if you're out to get drunk or just something to drink after working outside during hot summer months, not the best beer out there but not the worst."
"Needless to say, I promptly reimbursed my roommate the 55 cents the can cost and threw the remaining 3/4 down the drain. You deserve better than to expose yourself to this heap of rubbish. That is, if you consider yourself a beer drinker."
"the CPJ"
"D: Not much flavor, goes down very easily since there isn't much to it and not filling for the same reason, this is one of the lighter of the light beers for whatever that might be worth, overall though it’s not something I would choose right away even amongst the very inexpensive beers."
"O) One light lager that doesn't get much worse as it warms."
"Overall- The beer's motto is ""Always Smooth"" and yes, this is true! But I cannot find myself drinking this beer even on a floating trip! I have a feeling many people buy 18/30 packs of this beer for Beer Pong or binge drinking. True, this would be a perfect beer for this occasion but nothing I will be picking up anytime soon."
"Pours a huge two finger white head that I can hear fizzing away, and I'm sitting three feet away from it. The head looks nice, it has small bubbles, but it will be gone in seconds, and...now it's gone. Zero lacing on this beer, the body is piss yellow, completely see through, it looks like yellow water. This beer looks awful, but what can I expect, right? The only thing I can say that is ok about the appearance is the moderate carbonation. Sweet malt adjunct on the smell, no hops, there is also a metallic, can smell. No complexity at all here, I'm surprised at how much of an aroma there is, considering how flavorless I know this beer is. Even though there is an aroma, it's not a good one, it's sour, sweet and adjuncty. Wow, thats a bad taste, very sour, and the adjuncts are just through the roof. Frankly all I get out of this beer is adjuncts and carbonation, maybe a tiny bit of malt. That can taste really comes through too, and beats you over the head with grossness. I don't remember this beer being this gross, but wowzers, more flavor than I thought there would be really, bad flavor! I'm considering giving this a 1 for taste, but it's just barely making a 1.5. The mouthfeel is really the only redeeming part of this beer, sure it's thin as all hell, but the carbonation is where it should be. Drinkability is obviously really high, but that's not enough to save this beer. Overall, a bad beer, not the worst beer I've ever had, but it's getting close, probably in the top 5."
"Honestly, if you're looking for a cheap beer that actually resembles a real beer, try a Stroh's in the blue can. At least with that one you know you're not just drinking bad-tasting water."
"I'll try to review this beer with it's style in mind. Yellow fizzy pour in my Pilsner glass. Good deal of carbonation. Basically no smell whatsoever. Taste is a slight corn flavor. Not much going on here. We all know this ain't no craft beer. It is drinkable and priced right. Made for parties and guzzling. It's Coors light in a different can."
"I would not recommend this beer to anyone."
"Although, I will say that it is carbonated. And slightly alcoholic. Blegh."
"O - I didn't make a bitter beer face."
"12 oz can, straight out of the can. Pretty much tastes like flavored water. At least it isn't quite as objectionable as Coors Light, which is probably just a slightly different recipe. Another great use for America's corn: Keystone Light. Have it with some chips and there's some more corn down. Slightly more corn to go. We used to shotgun this beer, so I guess you could say it is highly drinkable. It also works well in beer bongs, much better than, say, Dark Lord. Enough said--avoid unless it's free and you're thirsty."
"Pours a very pale yellow, fizzy white head, no retention. Nose is astrigent, grain and corn. Taste is watery, almost no flavour besides the grain. Weak and light mouthfeel, fizzy. Overall a terribly cheap beer, made with nothing valuable besides water which it almost resembles. Terrible."
"Quite possibly the saddest attempt of a beer I've ever had. Really poor quality, I know guys who still drink this willingly and it makes me wanna rip my hair out. It's almost crystal clear in color, no flavor besides maybe a slight hint of barley. This is not a beer to sit back and enjoy it's more like something that your going to chug at a kegger in college and puke up a few hours later."
"Why would I review such an unprestigous beer? I went to college. Looks, smells, and tastes like water. Only valuable to those on a budget. Was a nostalgic trip down memory lane. Please do NOT buy this beer unless you plan to ignore taste and quality and shoot straight for imbibing alcohol."
"This stuff is no good. You could probably drink about a million of them if you wanted though."
"Its a cheap, crappy, party beer."
"D-Easy to drink a lot of this beer, great tailgate or house party beer, other than that dont waste your time."
"Since the mouthfeels are essentially identical in terms of heft (as in 'a lack of'), I'll have to use carbonation to distinguish them. They're both lightly fizzy, but this beer is a fraction harsher. Less smooth, one might say."
"The smell of this one is a watered down sewer like smell of water mixed with various grains. The taste of this one was not all that bad tasting mostly of h2o and a little grass. It is extremely easy to drink due to it's water like nature. I used to love this beer because to me it tastes slightly like power aid."
"My favorite light lager. Brings back memories. Still terrible thought."
"This beer pours a terrible yellowish color. It has the appearance of watered down beer. The taste is so light and unappealing that I could not finish more than two sips. The beer is heavily carbonated and has a horrendously skunky aroma. The head was non existent and thats not a bad thing. I would recommend avoiding."
"The number of cans of this beer I have had numbers in the thousands. I will never drink another single beer more in my life than this one. For that reason, they must be doing something right and I have to give it a 4.0. This is a legend of a beer that will be around colleges for a very long time."
"Pours a pale yellow color, nice carbonation, nice little white head, with some sticky lacing left behind. The nose is kinda malty, very slight hop note, grainy. The taste is kinda malty, kinda sweet, ricy. Light Body. Not Drinkable, another disappointment beer."
"Final thought - This beer is only for when you have no beer money, want to watch your figure and don't want to get smashed but be able to drink all day"
"M/D: Very light, somewhat high carbonation. Overall, it is, what it is. Cheap light beer. Honestly, from what the keg prices were I don't blame them for getting this over the other less than stellar options."
"RJT"
"D- This is not bad but I don't like the flavor or lack there of at times. Low ABV means I could pound this all night. Not that I would really want to."
"D- Like water with metallic tones. Nasty stuff."
"This beer is not intended for consumption by anyone 21 years or OVER."
"Pours a urine-colored body and smells really like nothing which should touch a human's lips. Its really a sad excuse for beer. Unfortunately this swill is consumed greatly by mostly underage college students. I think if you are looking for a light beer go with Yuengling light or Sam Adams light."
"Would rather drink water. Do not need to drink this again."
"But I could really pound these down while eating jalapeno stuffed olives. Which is exactly what I just did."
"I want to cut the can open to see the ""special liner."" Great commercials though!"
"Pours clear, Smells clear, tastes clear. I spilt Sam Adams on my shirt the other day and have a stain. Spilt this, and its now whiter than any other shirt. Taste like piss water. Has no head. and no color... Still my favorite party/power hour beer.."
"Finish: this is the best part of this beer the end!"
"As much as I wanted to claim to the contrary, due in no small part to years of enduring those inane TV commercials, I can't say that this isn't smooth and drinkable - it is indeed that. What it isn't, of course, is worth imbibing if you're looking for flavour rather than a somewhat beer-adjacent stomach filler."
"avoid if possible"
"this is made for the college kids wanting to pound back a case in a night. great for beers games and what not because it literally drinks like water. but IMHO, one of the worst of all the BMC light lagers."
"Drinkability: Hell, I'd take it over pabst. Easy to put down at college parties, however, on your own it is a different story."
"welcome to college beer. This is cheap, this tastes like water, this smells like nothing, and you can drink a ton of these. this is not a beer for a tasting experience. This is a beer for partying and getting really drunk on a budget. It has become my go-to have no money and need to play party games beer."
"A two finger head from the pour, but it quickly bubbled down to a wispy ring of non clinging lace. Color is a 2-3 on the SRM beer color chart. Smell, not much of anything, some hints of molded corn and watered rice, with a off smell of decay. Flavors that present themselves are those of slight citrus zest, corn mash, and light malt. Feels like soda water in my mouth. The only saving grace for this beer is it is cheep and it will give you a buzz. Keep this in the back until all are drunk and then they won't care."
"if you have to go with a light lager, spend the money for simple times or a silver bullet. just saying"
"drinkability - yes i could pound these all day long but i do not want to drink this or ever buy this beer"
" i got one swallow in... by comparison, BL Lime got two swallows to verify it was awful..."
"Pours a clear golden color with plenty of visible carbonation. I'll give it a few points here as it has pretty much nailed the light straw color with a short-lasting white head thing. Nose is grain and vegetables, mostly corn with a bit of squash. Taste is very, very light but all that's really there is a bit of grain and faint corn. Light body with pretty high carbonation. Gross."
"D- You know, for a light lager, this isn't too bad, which is what I found with standard Keystone as well. If I'm ever looking for a light beer, I'll definitely consider getting this again...good to have around for company, or on a hot day. It's not offensive and unlike Coors light, this actually fringes on the definition of a beer."
"Pours a nasty looking straw yellow color with a thick soapy white head and almost no lacing to speak of. Smells of corn and grain and a big waste of time and money. Mouthfeel is less than average and is too thin to be worth a damn. Drinkability is poor as well. Another poor BMC beer."
"I like this beer about as much as I like MGD64, which is to say that I will pray that every can of this spontaneously combusts. Always Smooth Keysmooth Lighsmooth Smooth Beer for Smooth People Smooth is a terrible product. It delivers on its promise of being smooth. It will get you drunk. Those two things are why people purchase this dreck. Rating this as a beer, even against the light lager style, it doesn't measure up. Beers like this make me want to get my bitter beer face on in a hurry. My bitter beer face, mind you, is a huge smile. Sorry, Keith Always Smooth Stone Smooth."
"After a long day on the tractor this bad boy really hits the spot. Goes down real good just like grandpa's moonshine used to. The hops are deliteful and I taste notes of barley. Not the most expensive beer but on a hot summers day this is like the Corona of the trailer court. All in all I really enjoy this beer. Real easy to get 10 down in an afternoon. Not much flavor to it, but that is why its so easy to drink."
"For a light lager it is better than a lot of others however Yuengling is probably still the best."
"Budweiser might be the professional level king of beers, but this old grizzled war veteran of gettin hammered is collegiate level king of beer. To get the most out of this you gotta have it at room temperature, then pour into a big ole Solo party cup and start playin for a good ole time. If rated below a B you must have not had a good time at college, sorry you missed out."
"16 oz can cold..ice cold from fridge. Aroma hardly noticable through the can hole..thats probably a good thing. Appearance..the cans OK i guess..has the ""mountains"". Taste..OK strange yet likeable sour apple in the background..guess its from the corn..little grainy..OK OK average mouthfeel for the category Overall not a bad light beer..better than most but still need to drink ICE COLD>"
"Ok, this is not a Sam Adams nor is it a Sierra Nevada. It is a cheap college kid beer and should be reviewed like one. $14 for 30 of them is a pretty good deal if all you wanna do is get nice and sloppy. That's all this beer is for. You wouldn't drink a Keystone Light with dinner (well, maybe if you watch NASCAR you would). Anyways, this is one of the better college kid beers out there. It's light enough to drink one after another and not get full. After a while you wouldn't even notice a difference in taste between this and any other 4.2% light beers anyways. In my humble opinion it is a sin to get inebriated off of high quality micro-brews and other respectable well crafted beers. If you wanna have a good night and save some money drink this. If you want something that will complement the flavors of the herb crusted sauteed salmon on your plate, drink something else."
"O: Could be much worse, but the beer fails because of its complete lack of personality."
"Overall its a beer for college/high school/rednecks that don't have much disposable income. This is not a beer drinkers beer, but a partier's beer. Its good at what its made to do, nothing more."
"Overall: typical commercial light beer a little more affordable than the rest. and The Keith Stone commercials are pretty funny.. HOLD MY STONES... LMAO"
"Not a bad light beer especially for the price. It pours to a light golden color very similar to coors light. The smell is of malts more than anything. The taste is not to bad with a really light mouthfeel almost like water but it is really easy to drink which to makes it a decent light beer."
"Yeah its cheap. Good for pong with people you're not actually friends with (because they bought keystone)"
"D-Designed to be imbibed in mass quantities. I guess it does its job. Feel awful giving it a 4 drinkability but you could conceivably drink this as a substitute for water."
"One of the worst beers quality wise I have ever had."
"Bought it on sale at Kroger's (a local grocery store). $1 per 24-ounce can. Not quite worth it when you consider that Sam Adams is only about a buck-fifty more. *Shrug* Light beer."
"Overall I could see why this is is the top ten worst beers, wow. .79 could have been spent on gum."
"Not much to say. Microbrewed. Just giving the review strictly based on the numbers."
"My buddies and I had to pick up a case for some beer pong. It pours a crisp and carbonated pale straw yellow with a heaping white foamy head. The smell is very similar to Coors Light, no hops or malt or alcohol, or anything traditionally beer related. The taste isn't the worst in the world, again just like Coors Light. I think it tastes less skunky than an original Budweiser. The mouthfeel actually is very good for the style. It's very light and very crisp and fresh. It has excellent carbonation. For a beer that doesn't taste that great it's extremely drinkable. It's probably the most drinkable of the macros. It's pretty watery and you can pound these for quite awhile before you feel the effects. This is my party go to macros, excellent for drinking games or mass consumption."
"My least favorite beer in the universe. Even worse tasting than Natty Ice. If you need a 30 rack on an extreme budget, take keystone. Otherwise, avoid it. Light carbonation, extremely watery, and no true taste. This is a cheap beer whose sole purpose is to get people drunk"
"This is what $12.99 a 30-pack gets you. I want to dislike this beer, but it serves its purpose well. Keystone Light is a great choice when you want affordable light beer in large quantities and may or may not want to get drunk."
"Verdict: Keystone Light is everything you would expect it to be. We're pretty much at the bottom of the barrel of ""not offensive"" beer here; this is as low as you can go without having unpleasant flavors."
"Not too drinkable, but had no trouble choking one down. Certainly not the worst of this genre I've had, but you could've told me this was non-sweetened apple juice & I would've believed you..."
"There is nothing impressive about Keystone Light, but it is a great beer for drinking games and that sort of thing. Not to mention the incredible low price, which is nice for poor college students. There is really no flavor to this beer, and it is very easy to drink. The only reason anyone would want to drink Keystone is to simply get drunk. If that's what you're looking for, then Keystone is your beer."
"Well, I have spoken...Good day and good night!"
"D- Not the worst light lager. Not a recommendation though."
"This is not a bad beer. It's the quintessential backyard BBQ beer, but for cheap. It's got a nice flavor for what it is, and I'm sure it would make an amazing session beer. Good on Coors for producing a cheaper (but almost equally good) alternative to their flagship product, Coors Light. Not saying it's an English Stout, but it is the best bargain beer I've tried. Cheers."
"D - It's sure drinkable alright, but nothing I'd drink on a regular basis, as I'm not a fan of the Adjunct Lagers that have that pronounced sweet corn/apple flavor & smell. Not bad though, for the price it's good, still I'll look elsewhere before having this brew again."
"The absence of some of the more off-putting grainy flavors other adjunct or light lagers have is a plus to me. Drinkability is high, because it goes down like carbonated water."
"It's a party beer. If you are going to drink this, do so only for drinking games or sporting events, and even at sporting events, you can find something better for the same price."
"Drinkability: Typical of an american macro. Good for the beach or hot summer days as simple refreshment."
"Drinkability - High drinkability. With it's almost non-present smell and taste, this beer could easily be drunk one after another, hence its appeal at college parties."
"Drinkability- Taste is very poor, drank at college parties cause of its cheap price other than to get drunk I would not buy this beer"
"Very drinkable but not very enjoyable."
"D - This would be this beers one redeeming quality. Because it is so light and has so little taste and smell I can drink this like water and keep drinking it."
"im gonna say this much, it gets points on taste because i love water and this is water. drink one dipa after every four keystones and you are golden. this beer is the ramen noodles of beer. i wanted to add something to it to just give it a little flavor. whatever, 75 dollars for 165 of these is a good deal but it lacks all flavor."
"I am in college and this is one of the most popular beers. I can see why because it's cheap and you can drink it all night. The only reason one should buy this beer is if they want to get a lot of people drunk for a low cost. That is about all it is good for."
"while this isn't something i would normally drink, it's probably much better than other low-tier macro beers. for being Coors Light's little brother (or distant, poorer cousin), i think it has more flavor and is much easier to drink. i almost got through a quarter of the glass before i poured it out. it's just that good."
"Drinkability: It really is insulting to even call this a beer. It seems apparent that the main reason people drink this is just to get drunk and because it's cheap. I suppose if getting drunk is your thing then this might be the beer for you. But if you're thinking for a respectable beer, I don't even need to tell you that you should stay away."
"Overall impression: the only reason I drink this is because it's ridiculously cheap. Even for the light beer category, this is fairly awful."
"Overall: Good. Cheap. Party beer. Nothing more."
"I didn't know it could get worse than coors light. Apparently... it can. This straw yellow beer smells like burnt corn. It tastes like an earwax flavored soda. Mouthfeel is about as thin as alley mcbeal. I rather drink water than Keystone light. I'm glad I'm out of college."
"Its not terrible at all but the question I ask myself is ""Would I choose and drink this over other beers, even other easily available beers?"". The answer is probably not... Just not a lot of flavor or endearing qualities... As I said, not terrible, but not something I'll have again more than likely..."
"D: I guess I have to say ""good," because it really is like drinking (gross) water. I must admit, would drink this over Bud or BL, and such, but hopefully I will never have to come to that point. If you have a dollar in your pocket...save it, buy a scratch ticket, whatever, don't buy this. Well, unless you are dying of thirst."
"~Cheers"
"You wont lose much from your wallet though!"
"I wouldn't even define this as sessionable, I'd call it a marathon beer. Beer pong, asshole, kings, whatever drinking game you choose this is the perfect accompaniment. Certainly not going for quality here, though I do feel it surpasses most macros, but if your looking for quantity for the duration this is the way to go."
"Notes: Pretty much what you expect from a really cheap beer. Like drinking water with a hint of beer."
"Wish I still had a Torpedo IPA left."
"Poured from a 24 ounce can into a pint glass. No head or even carbonation to speak of. Pale clear yellow color. Basically flavorless. If I stretch my palate I can detect a little sweetness from corn and some metalic flavors. Very watery in the mouth. Another mass produced beer to be mass consumed."
"d non drinkable."
"I'll deviate from this rule long enough to say that this is probably the worst beer I've ever tasted. It is light yet virtually undrinkable, and after choking one down I actually would have drank a Bud Light to wash the taste out of my mouth. If I urinated into an empty Keystone Light can and put it in the fridge overnight I would have myself a far more drinkable beverage than Keystone Light."
"The feel is all water and you can't drink a lot of this no matter what."
"Notes: As I have said in my other reviews, light lagers taste so similar to me. That being said I think Keystone Light fills Coors niche as a more bargain brand. It looks considerably more pale and has a much fizzier head than Bud/Miller/Coors Light. Smell, mouthfeel, and drinkability are the same. However, it tastes slightly more watered down. However, it'll have a special place in my drinking heart, since it is my go to cheap beer. I will refrain from giving it higher scores because of this, but at the end of the day would drink my Stones over a Bud Light."
"Well, its drinkable. Not better beer but you can actually do worse."
"Poured from a 24 oz. can. Has a very pale yellow color with a 1/2 inch head. Not much in the way of aroma, maybe some corn. Taste is lacking, basicallly water with some hints of beer. Feels like water in the mouth. Drinkability is good, in the same manner as water or iced tea. Overall there is not much to recommend about this one."
"This beer pours an uninspiring clear pale yellow with a thin white head that disappears fairly quickly. Aroma is crisp, malty and rather weak. Flavor is malty and insipid, hardly there at all. The texture is quite thin and a little watery. It is hardly like drinking beer at all."
"Drinkability- Good if you're just looking for a way to get wasted on the cheap, horrific if you in any way care about what's passing through your mouth."
"D: The mouthfeel, along with a very cold temperature, is what makes this beer somewhat palatable."
"Got this one from a friend of mine. With friends like this...never mind. Clear gold color with a thin head which disappears quickly. The smell...ugh! Some grain and not much else.Taste is mostly water, slightly bitter water at that with no real malt sweetness. could this cause the dreaded bitter beer face? Mouthfeel is thin and watery with fair carbonation. As far drinkability goes, I'll get my friend for this one. Next time I will pass, even if it is free like this one was."
"This stuff is drunk by horny college underclassmen like piss water...save up and buy something with some flavour and a bit of class!"
"I've been seeing billboards for this stuff all over town so I had to give it a try to see what all the fuss is about. Can't say much in favor of my experience other than it was indeed pretty light which I guess was their goal. No smell, taste or mouthfeel to speak of, all very bland and generic. Drinkability was ok because I might as well have been drinking water."
"It really isn't all that drinkable. I would rather have a glass of water. I did actually drink a second one straight out of the can, and it was more drinkable that way. I think that the smell of this one just really turns me off. This beer really would only be good for filling a beer bong at a college party."
"I boiled off the water while steaming corn on the cob recently and the syrup that cooked onto the bottom of the pan smelled very similar to Keystone...which should give you some indication of what it is really made up of."
"D: Its like drinking mineral water goes down very smooth"
"Obviously, I understand what makes this beer appealing to college students, but I'd rather have one decent craft beer over an entire case of this (but I guess that's why I'm a BA)."
"To say it safely, there are much, much better options out there for quality, but then again, you get what you pay for. A 30-pack for 12 dollars only gets you so much, and doing anything with this beer other than straight pounding it is to do yourself an incredible diservice to your beer-loving palate. At a college party, this stuff is unavoidable, but serves its purpose as a highly poundable, flavorless piss."
"From a 24oz. can. Appearance is pale yellow in color with a crisp head that dissapates quickly. Smell has a light corn adjunct aroma. Taste has not much to speak of, very light grain and hops with a slight sweetness. Mouthfeel is light with a good amount of carbonation. If your looking for a thirst quencher on a hot day and no more it would be a good one, it's watered down but clean."
"Lifeless, pale, weak and watery. The can lent an unappealing chemical taste to the beer. The mouthfeel was exceptionally thin. I can't think of anything appealing about this beer."
"I don't want to sound too overly snobbish here...but the light beers that come out of Coors Brewery that I have tasted are extremely light. It's beer for those who just don't like beer, I'd say, and who don't understand that beer is more complex - well, should be more complex to the palate than wine. I've droned on enough. Summary: I'd drink it again, ice cold, at a party or cook out, but not if there was something - anything - else available...I don't hate this beer, I just personally prefer a much more robust flavor."
"A friend had this on-tap in his kegerator and I couldn't resist giving this a try. I was also out of Kellerweise. Last time I drank this it was in an unfinished basement in college. This experience, frankly (and thanks to Kuklickx), wasn't terribly different. I found the key to this beer was to taste it as little as possible. Letting sit on my tongue for a split second before gulping left just a cream soda and white bread taste. When I let it linger, it tasted like a chemical spill. It was sharp and acrid with a dirty water background. Stick to chugging, you don't want to taste this."
"It's difficult to understand how anyone could view this as beer, but it passes government regulations for the definition of the product and, unlike water, has 104 calories, 5.0 grams carbohydrates, and 0.7 grams protein, not to mention 4.2% alcohol by volume. Honestly, I can't even really call this drinkable, as there's nothing there to make one want to drink more. When I eat something delicious, I want more; when I drink something delicious, I want more. This I don't even notice as I drink it, so there's nothing there to make me want more. It fails even in the Light Lager category of beer. Absolutely pathetic."
"Tonic water with hint of grain and a hint of alcohol anyone? MAYBE if I were into beer pong...but I'm not...and even then there are better cheap light lagers out there..."
"If Keystone Premium is awful, then how can anyone expect the Light version to be any better. This beer is watery and not much else good can be said about it. Others have said it better than I can. Mouthfeel is weak, taste is atrocious, and poured appearance is without obvious merit. Drinkability? You got to be kidding."
"Yet another offering to the masses of college students. It is a punishment to drink this stuff if there is no party around you. Obviously this beer fulfills its role perfectly. It is meant to be cheap and get you drunk. It does that. Taste is not a factor for those who just want to get drunk on the cheap."
"Pours a yellow almost clear color with carbonation very clearly shown. There is almost no head at all. The smell is of corn and that smell is very faint at best. The taste is of barely corn, it is very watery. The mouthfeel is like a pepsi it is very fizzy. Overall you couldn't drink a lot of these, it is filling and watery."
"T/M - The mouthfeel is for the most part watered down and the taste has some weak hops in the background. Really it tases like a macro light, no more or no less."
"Overall: The mouth feel of the beer is dry and lightly carbonated. The body of the beer is water, uh I mean very light. The finish, what finish. Okay my opinion now. It is bang on for what the beer is suppose to be. I think that this beer is good for two things drinking and peeing."
"In the depressing settings where one finds themself left with choices such as keystone light, it may be helpful to reflect upon the path that has led to such dismal circumstances. Beers such as this fall into a category where rating them is sort of a challenge. Essentially, all you can ask is ""well, what did you expect?"".. it smells like foam, however something can smell like foam I have no idea but the only thing that makes sense in the smell is generic beer foam. I suppose you're really just smelling adjucts. It has the generic adjuct taste of corn or whatever garbage is being used and a thin, watery body. Perhaps you could say there is a slight extra sour/bitter taste that gives it a modest hue of unique character when compared to the other light adjuct lagers from coors et al. Again, the best thing this beer could be used for is a catalyst for reflection upon one's own life choices, because if you are drinking this by choice then you have made some terrible, terrible mistakes."
"Although this beer seemed slightly refreshing and had a manageable taste to begin with, As it warms the taste grows more and more burdensome. I think ill leave this one to hunting trips and already drunk college party goers."
"D= very drinkable for its intended mass-swill purpose."
"In a half-drunken haze I bought 30 of these from Walmart. I thought it was a good deal at the time but on further thought I don't really think so. Having this fine fellow out of a beveled beer mug. It pours flat. It's pale yellow, which is fine by me, but the zero head and no apparent carbonation makes it look kinda gross. It smells shockingly sweet, corny, and of fusel alcohol. The mouthfeel is a bit slick, and corny/grainy flavors wash over the tongue. There's a bit of an after taste that reminds me of putting a penny in my mouth. If this was a malt liquor I'd be a big fan, but at 4.2 percent ABV what am I getting? Thanks a bundle Coors... fuck you by the way."
"What CAN I review next? This was another find at my local sixer, but it was not much of a find. It was another fizzy yellow beer with a big white head with low retention. The nose was virtually nonexistent. The mouthfeel was thin and watery without much flavor, either. The finish made me wish that I had some actual beer, rather than the swill that seems to fill cans. Boooring!"
"Final Thoughts: This is my party beer. For as cheap as it is, a very draikable good beer. Not my typical style but inexpensive and easy to drink. Not to mention, it tastes good. My favorite light beer."
"Just had this beer at a party the other night. I found that I actually couldn't taste it. Opened the can and smelled a little bit of sweetness, and some rice. Poured, there was just some foam that settled within 5 seconds, and left a liquid that appeared close to urine in appearance. The can actually said beer on it, and I'm glad I saw that, because honestly without it, I wouldn't have known."
"What can you say really? You basically know what you're getting into when you reach for one of these, which is a night of getting hammered. More or less a sorry excuse for a beer, but must admit being in college, and at $14 for a 30 it serves it's purpose. Nothing to enjoy, just something to play beirut with and get drunk."
"Note: I was reminded recently how important it is to review a beer with in it's style to ensure fair and proper scoring."
"I'm a college student, no matter how bad this beer adds up to a true beer, it is a great deal for its price. Compared to other cheap light beer this stuff is great. However, not a overall good beer."
"Ice cold is where it's at on this beer. Then it's like drinking a bottle of water after just walking through the desert. I must admit that I do find this beer to be refreshing when cold. It does have a clean crisp feel with a nice bite that I attribute to heavy carbonation rather then hops. Drink this beer only in the shop while looking at a dismantled vehicle. This is shop beer to be drank quick for a light buzz and that's all."
"its no surprise that all the categories fall sub-par, but this beer has a purpose and that's to get you pie-faced, and honestly i believe its a better (and cheaper) alternative than bud-light"
" Avoid if you can."
"Keystone Lite is really just a beer for beer pong. I drink them every so often, just because I typically can't afford anything nicer, and it's not like it hurts to drink it. It's relatively refreshing, lacks most flavor, and has a nice low alcohol content to it."
"Pours an extremely pale body with strong carbonation, small head and no retention and no lacing. Smells and tastes very weak, watery with low malt and small amount of hops and grain. Strong carbonation, but not horribly strong carbonation. Overall Not the worst, but not good or even okay."
"Let's face it: the only reason anyone (myself included0 drinks this beer is to get sloppy drunk. That being said, the drinkability is pretty damn good because the taste is not necessarily bad but because the taste almost doesn't exist. The beer just goes down nice and easy with no flavor at all. The other aspects are completely unremarkable."
"The color/smell is non-existant. The Taste is bad...very copper tasting...the mouthfeel is the highlight, never a good sign for a beer."
"This is hands down the worst beer I have ever had. I've had it a few times at parties and could barely down it. I feel like this makes Natty Light look like jesus. The color is poor yellow and it smells like corn and urine. It takes like carbonation. It has a very smooth mouthfeel but the taste is just so bad. I would never, ever spend my own money on this. I probably won't even drink this if it's offered for free. I don't like bashing beer, but this is the worst I've had."
"When my friends throw parties, this is the kind of keg they get. It's cheap, and for good reason. It's the typical BMC light lager. Looks like tinted water. Smells like beer mixed with water. Tastes like water-diluted beer. It's over-carbonated as well. The best thing about it is it's not hard to take a few of these down (so long as you drink it quickly). It's a great beer pong beer: cheap and not too alcoholic."
"I guess it's time to give an officially review to the local college favorite. It poured a yellow-tinged clear color with a single-finger head that didn't last long and a ton of visible carbonation. The smell is corn adjunct. The taste is watery and mercifully unflavorful. All there is is a bit of sweet corniness and a bit of a metallic taste. The mouthfeel is watery and highly carbonated, but not entirely unpleasant if the beer is cold enough. Thankfully for poor college kids everywhere this beer is very drinkable, and you may find yourself drinking half a case of this without noticing."
"Well BeerAdvocate is telling me I need to type more but there isn't much more to say about this beer. Only drink it if 1.) You are dirt poor or 2.) Are a college student. The later of the two applies to myself. Don't be temped by the sub $6 price for a 12 pack or the ""specially lined can"" whatever the f*** that means. Save your money, put it in your 401K or something, just don't buy Keystone.... I hope that's enough text for you BeerAdvocate"
"Good for: beer pong, beer games - if you are really really cheap that is..."
"It may be cheap, but geez, it's not enjoyable trying to gag this stuff down. But man-up I will, it will not hit the sink on my watch."
"The beer pours a pale gold color with a 1/2"" fizzy white head that quickly fades to no lacing. The aroma is below average. It has a faint pilsner malt scent along with some adjuncts and a dry lager yeast aroma. The taste is less than average as well. It has a watery, pilsner malt flavor that's devoid of any real beer character. It goes down extremely smooth and finishes dry with very little malt taste. The mouthfeel is average. It is a low bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is an easy drinking beer, but it's nothing special, even by light lager standards."
"The price? like $10 30, or as SUNY Oswego students say, a ""30 rack," so I assume that this swill will be a popular brew for years to come."
"Drink: Another beer pong beer for the records."
"Conclusion: NOTHING here...it's got massive drinkability, but so does water...and this has about as much character...it's thirst quenching...and...thirst quenching..."
"Poured from a 12oz - specially lined can. This brew pours a light yellow with next to no head. Nose is faint and grainy like corn. Taste is light, only slightly malty and a touch sweet. No hops to speak of. Finishes clean and relatively dry. Body is very light and carbonation level is fair. All in all this is not a very good lager but I imagine one could drink a number of then on a hot day."
"This beer really has no taste at all to me, so I guess its really not a bad tasting beer. I guess that does make it a decent party beer because you could drink a case of these no problem."
"One awful aspect of this beverage (I REFUSE TO CALL IT BEER) is that it gives you some nasty ass shits. ONCE again, nastier than my ex girlfriend."
"Once when poured into a glass it was a very pale yellow with white foam and no lace. The smell of nothing was there. The taste of nothing was also there. But, what a nice inexpensive beer to have on a hot day after chopping a couple of cord of wood. Great summer sipper, and that's about all it's worth!"
"Yep, this is a college brew where those who drink it will care less what it tastes like as long as it gets you loaded, which is why they sell this stuff. Right? Good beer? No. Will I buy it again? Only for deer camp."
"Really the only time I will ever drink this is when hanging out with my college buddies who haven't gotten past their ""cheap beer"" phase. I don't want to be rude after all."
"Sadly, I have tried every type of Keystone, and this this the best one out there. Pours nearly clear, with tons of foam; which, coincidentally will look exactly like your pee after consuming a few of these. The aroma is metal, though that could be the can. Taste is metal and veggie, yum. Official beer of Delta Tau Delta at the U of A."
"The taste is bland with a faint, stale rice element and a hint of faint grain in the aftertaste plus a very faint ""Sprite"" quality. The feel is rough, thin, and watery. Unlike Coors Light, which is almost mediocre and actually better than regular Coors to me, this stuff is dreadful."
"D- Avoid at all costs. This is terrible beer. Only good for college students while playing beer pong. Or people with terrible taste in beer."
"Drank this one from the can. Very typical mass-produced light lager. Pale, straw yellow in appearance, smells of grains, hops, metal and skunk. Tastes very bland, some grains and metal flavor in there; very watery, lightly carbonated. Terrible aftertaste, yuck. Would not recommend unless you're looking for a cheap way to get drunk. No flavor or refreshment to be found here."
"Pale yellow colored beer with a rapidly fading head.Aroma and taste are your usual macro lights.No rare hops or exotic malts but guess what?? It's not suppose to it's a light lager.It is refreshing, light and perfect for those summer outdoor gatherings or Sunday football games.I recommend and will buy again!!"
"drinkability: well theres usually a lot of it around, its cheap, however i cant drink that much because its still so awful though"
"It had a very thin white head to start that just went away and left some lace. The body is very transparent and pale yellow. There is a lot of bubbles though. It smells of vinegar and fruit juice. It has bland taste for the most part. It is more corny and adjunct than anything. It is like a lot of beer of this style fruity and malt liquor like. It has a very thin and carbonated mouthfeel."
"D - Really for youth parties, where mass consumption for a cheap price is the main goal. I don't hate it by any means, and I'll probably have more in the near future. After each can/cup you are just left with a lot more to be desired."
"D: Not as bad as many bargain basement beers, but that's not saying much."
"D-Life is too short...I've had much worse in my day, but I won't be buying this one again. Do any of you ever get the urge to try a lower-end brew once in a while? I did tonight."
"Overall, I would never recommend this to anyone. Please save yourself the pain and buy some real beer."
"drinkability: lawnmower beer"
"Very pale brew with a short lived foamy head. Smells of corn and some alcohol, it has a sweet and malty taste. Mouthfeel is very smooth, agrees with their slogan. This is a very drinkable cheap macro, great for beerpong etc. Great price to boot!"
"Wiseman Justin reporting...."
"Pale watery yellow with a slimy white head that fizzles into nothing immediately. Aroma is almost nonexistent. Metallic and corny. Flavor is lightly fruity, like artificial banana flavoring. Weaker than puppy piss but not offensive really. Almost preferable to the blatant adjunct juice flavor of most macros, if for nothing else than something a bit different. Thin and fizzy. Easy to put away several cans, I guess."
"Drinkability is low. Although it's low alcohol and arguably sessionable, it's just plain terrible. I could do without this beer."
"Pours a clear, pale straw yellow with a tall white head. Aroma is of barley and cereal grains. Not much flavor, slight hints of cereal grains. Moderate aftertaste of cereal grains. Very watery texture with a lot of carbonation. Not a great beer for enjoyment, except on a hot day."
"In my college days I must have had thousands of this beer. For a cheap beer this is the way to go. I'd rank it ahead of Bud and Coors, and it's about half the price. It tastes like water and goes down easy so great for drinking games and beer pong. It is what it is, cheap, easy to drink beer."
"There isn't really much taste to speak of here. It's like drinking dirty water. Mouthfeel is thin and mediocre. Easy to drink but no real reason to."
"D- Drinkable, yes. Session beer, hell no. For me, this is the easiest of the cheap beers to drink because the taste is not as offensive to my tongue as say...Budweiser. This is where I say ""Please excuse me, I am a college student."" While I would certainly take a Surly Furious over this any day, sometimes I do like to indulge a bit and join in on the beer pong. When I'm looking for dirt cheap beer that I can actually drink (which is not very often) Keystone is where I go."
"You can drink as much as you want without the taste of beer, only metal, in your mouth."
"I don't know why I pick this up every so often...maybe because it was my first beer and I like to go back to my roots. Unless you just want to get drunk....STAY AWAY!!"
"T: Quite grassy, kinda metallic. The flavour doesn't last long, which I suppose is a good thing. Kinda weird. Carbonation is something like Perrier that is beginning to go flat. Not very good at all."
"Drinkability: Watery and thin, it would be an acceptable lawnmower beer if it weren't for all the really unpleasant aromas and tastes."
"D: Drink it rue enough, but why."
"Very light-bodied, clear golden color. Not much head or lacing with this. It's a cheap light beer... Taste is quite watery and tiny. Almost thought I was drinking some of the can with it. Fine for when you're already drunk (if that's your thing) and a perfect beerpong beer. Other than that I'll pass. Don't women like to wash their hair in beer every once in a while to add body to it? Keystone can be used for that too."
"Sampled out of the can during a round of golf. I first must admit that I despise light beer to begin with, but this was the offering that my buddy brought. Weak aroma, light pale straw color, watery mouthfeel, and a watery flavor. The flavor is extremely weak but not horrible. Overall junk that shall never pass over these lips again."
"A side note, it is much better to drink out of a can then in a glass. Out of the can it turns WARM instantly."
"It is what it is..."
"Coors entry into the cheap beer field, I guess. It's on par with the Milwaukee's Best Light/ Old Milwakee Light/ etc. $12..99 for a 30 pack... give it to unwanted houseguests type of thing. Clear gold fizzy fluid with no head. Smells like an Iowa cornfield and/or a freshly mowed lawn. Tastes hopless with an extremely faint hint of sweetness maybe provided by malted barely. Thin and watery. Earthy. Mediocre. Exactly what one would expect from a 30 pack of beer for $12.99."
"D - Since there's not much here to offend the palate, it is quite drinkable--if you don't want anything to get in the way of the alcohol."
"Poured frsh from the old ""college keg"" this ill-reputed libation does muster a big white bubbly head with a little lace and a yellow gold color. Smells pretty weak with cereal and some citrus suggestion. Although this is obviously whimpy stuff by nature, it has a slight creaminess to it that I don't usually note in other light beers. But the flavor is a bit of the usual bready cardboard. Tolerable but only if you accept light beers at all in the first place."
"D- I was given one of these and reviewed it at the beginning of a party keeping in mind that it's a cheap mass consumption beer. A good beer for certain drinking games (i.e. pong and flip-cup) as it is easy to drink quickly and only costs $12.99 a rack (30-pack). Would I buy it any other time than for parties? Hell NO!!!"
"Unless you enjoy drinking air or partying, I'd avoid this in favor of other beers. This is definitely for the cheapest at heart and the ones who want the party never to stop."
"I understand what it is and what it's for, but anyone considering buying this should just shell out the extra 4 bucks for a rack of coors or bud."
"This is an old time favorite over at the CU frat houses. Seriously, they really love this stuff over there. And why not, its only like $10 a keg right? No, you could not pay me to drink this stuff. Even if one can get past the piss color appearance, there is a bitter grainy aroma to look over. Then the stale yeasty taste and over carbonated body really does the job. If you want something you can drink all night and never taste, go for it CU."
"Prost!"
"This super cheapo macro pours straw yellow with snow white head and zero lacing.It smells like malts and slightly sweet,but thats about it.The taste is white rice,corn,really watery and a little dry on the finish and too much carbonation,as easy as water to drink.I would not recommened this,period."
""
"Not bad for a cheap beer. Mass produced colloge beer. Color is light yellow with little aroma head is weak at best but over all you get what you pay for. Watered down a little for my taste. Taste won't stay with you long. nor will the head. Good beer to drink with the guys."
"Overall, it's what you expect from it. It's not a good 'beer' but is refreshing. I honestly don't find anything really offensive about it as there is not much flavor to not like. I don't see why i would buy coors light over this as they taste the same, and this one is over half the price."
"Well that's about all there is to it, just fizzy water with a little beer flavoring. Lacking flavor it's still a drinkable beer good for chugging or for parties with the in-laws. I won't kick the remaining 'stones out of my fridge but will stick with my regular daily driver."
"Decent beer for the price. I'm not saying that I wouldn't drink it, but I'd rather go elsewhere because this beer fills you up quick! You'll be too full to get drunk! One thing I noticed though is this beer is excellent with food! If you buy a 30 pack you definitely aren't wasting your money for 10 bucks!"
"It is basically light on smell and taste and a bit overdone on the carbonation. But it is a not a bad beer to have if you're having more than one."
"Not the greatest beer in the world bur for the price it is very drinkable. At this price you can not expect a fine import taste but Coors does quote well brewing a beer at this price point. Since the apperance and smell are below average, I recommend drinking it from the can."
"By throwing Keystone Light into the mix of my beer drinking regimen, I am able to save money, go light which means my liver won't roll over, and I can merily drink on a regular and responsible basis without jeopardizing my health and appeal to the opposite sex."
"12 ounce can, 55 cents. Pretty much bought the single can just to review it on BA. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours a clear straw gold color with about a half inch white head. Aroma is grain, sweet malt, and corn. It doesn't smell great, but on the other hand it doesn't smell awful either. Taste is the same as the aroma (it's slightly better), and it has a lightly sweet taste. The sweet taste lingers around, but not for too long. No bitter beer face with Keystone Light! Mouthfeel/body is light, watery, and has a little above average carbonation. However, it is easy to drink. It's smooth and not hard to drink a few of these at a time. For a macro light lager, it's not bad. If you want something cheap to drink, then this isn't a bad choice."
"the great party beer. beer pong, quarters, flip cup. it works great for shotguns and beerbongs. this is strictly party beer i dont touch unless im under these circumstances."
"D- As mentioned by others, KL is best when you are playing beirut or some other fun and crazy game."
"this beer is only good if you are in college and looking for a cheap keg. It is a very light beer with very little taste. Rumor has it that it is the bottom of the barrel of Coors Light. I would believe it considering there is absolutely no head at all when poured."
"Yellowy, thin, watery, no real flavor. Not unpleasant, a touch of dryness. I can recall the drinking experience of this beer so well it's frightening."
"This happens to be a cheap beer, very cheap, infact this is the beer my neighbor buys as a 30 pack in order to get drunk, it is an okay beer for the cost. You could pick up a 30 pack of this for the cost of an 18 pack of miller lite. I cannot really give this beer any decent review because of the bland taste of it, but I have had beer that is much worse that also cost much more."
"Thin and water in the mouth with little 'feel' to speak of. Moderate carbonation and I suppose somewhat refreshing; mostly unpleasant though. It also gets worse as it warms. Really only tolerable if its extremely cold."
"Scott"
"All four watered down beers flexed whatever muscles they had. I'm really glad this torment is over, as this was a boring tasting invite. The reason I sampled these beers is so you don't have to. You can check my previous reviews if you're interested. Good night everyone!"
"This beer is just plain awful. Marketed as a Party Beer is not actually a good thing. It is only a party beer because it is so damn cheap. It pours a pale yellow color with a white head. The smell is of cheap macro beer - light malt and hop aroma. The same goes for the taste. The problem with this beer is how unsmooth it is. Very unsmooth. With little carbonation, it feels flat, which is something a beer of this stature does not need. Everytime I have this, I regret it. Do not drink this beer."
"A cheap, unappealing light beer offeered by the Coors Brewing Company... Just by-pass this one and go for Coors Light instead... This has a distinct ""sweetness"" which lingers on the palate after the first couple of beers. Although this could make for a decent session beer, there are much better ones out there to enjoy. It's really not a spectacular sample, and I wouldn't drink this unless I had to... If you are a fan of light beers, you could try this one if you'd like, but you're better off spending your money on something more well-known and better tasting."
"its drinkability is good depending on what you're drinking for. If your looking to shotgun and go all out on beer at a party than this is perfect, it has no extreme flavors. But if you're looking to drink as an actual drink you might as well drink club soda."
"Taste. Somewhere between bad and non-existent. Tastes very slightly of malt, with almost no discernible hops. No aftertaste. This beer tasted best ice cold - the colder it is, the less flavor it has."
"overall, i've had worse, but it probably sits middle of the road for the category... which in itself sucks."
"This beer is not good. Should be one of the many macro beers one should avoid."
"Drinkability- Not much. Just a cheap beer."
"The taste has a bit of hop bitterness but it has no appreciable base, no malt that I can detect, and actualll\y, what flavour *is* there is pretty bad. Yuck. Another drain pour for me."
"Could drink a bunch, very light"
"drinkability - its funny because this was always the beer i chose to shotgun because of its lightness and wateryness. I guess you could call that drinkability, but I'm not going to."
"D= Extremely easy to put down."
"One of the worst beers if not the worst I've had, although highly recommended for college guys looking to get drunk quick."
"This drink is great if you want a cheap beer to simply drink w/ out wanting to have to worry about true ""taste"" or price."
"Everyone recognizes Keystone as the cheap, college beer of choice. Pours out straw color and very carbonated into a pint glass. Smells strongly of corn and biscuit, with almost no hint of hop-smell. Unlike many light beers, the taste isn't too watered down; instead, it's replaced with the corn taste, which I do not enjoy, but I suppose someone does. The corn is followed by the bitter hops and over-carbonation. Carbonated, but drinkable because, like most light beers, it's designed to be not that filling. Overall, I understand why Coors would keep making this, but probably not the beer-lover's choice of beer. Unless you're in college, seriously strapped for cash, or feel like having an elaborate drinking competition, I wouldn't recommend Keystone Light."
"D - A basic light lager, forgettable, but a decent example. So it may be ""Always Smooth", but mostly flavorless in my opinion."
"Pours a super-light yellow color with no head. Seems overcarbonated. Aroma is sweet and smells of corn adjunct. Nothing impressive here. Taste is lacking. Very thin and watery with only a slight hint of corn. Lame. No mouthfeel whatsoever. I think I can understand why this beer is rated so low."
"Overall not recommended. Too much corn sweetness for my taste. Just not good."
"D: The horrible taste mentioned made it a drain pour, I couldn't finish it, a rarity for me. It also gave me a bad headache after one. This beer sucks and I don't plan on ever drinking it again."
"Not terrible, not offensive, but not that good either."
"A good choice for those who like easily drinkable beer, who don't want to drink anything complex, strong, or overly flavorful, or are entering a drinking competition. Best served cold so as to mask its lack of real flavor and character. Even for a light beer, you can certainly do better."
"D: It is super easy to drink this beer so that is why the score is as high as it is, I know I'll have this again as I am still in college but as soon as I am gone so will this beer from my life."
"Due entirely to its horrifying head, Keystone Light comes up the loser in the sixteenth version of this venerated series. Don't kid yourself, though. Neither one of these light lagers should have been brewed in the first place. The fact that it's a 2005 GABF bronze medalist makes me wonder if there were only three entrants that year."
"Better than average drinkability for a LIGHT beer and not a regular beer. Of the American light beers from the big three Coors Light is the one that I have always found most tolerable. I am VERY convinced that this beer is nothing but Coors Light with a different label."
"I dont mind this one every once in a while."
"D - Tastes like carbonated water, but if I really just wanted to get drunk (especially when it's hot outside) I could handle this. I don't know why I liked this so much in school...oh wait. I know. It was CHEAP."
"D- Don't even think about this tasting this one. If you'll be drinking it fast enough to not taste it, then by all means go ahead."
"Drinkability- Suprisingly drinkable, if you want cheap beer."
"You can literally drink this beer with everything, as there is not a single flavor that could possibly interfere. The Light Lager category doesn't do much for me, at least there's a level of complexity and layers of character to European lagers and pilsner-style beer. Don't bother with this one unless you've got thirty friends and twelve dollars between them."
"I guess this might make a good palate cleanser between beer tastings :-). This is absolutely the blandest beer I've ever had."
"overall- cheap beer that's better than busch or anything else in it's price range, but it still sucks. if you're gonna get keystone, at least get keystone ice to get that extra .5% ABV"
"Drinkability: Well, this is a light beer. Nothing terrible tasting, but lacking any flavor at all. If that's what you're going for, I suppose it's good. Mouthfeel is weird and foamy."
"The only redeeming purpose of this beer is the fact you could guzzel can after can, otherwise this seems like a close to exact replication of Coors Light. Except worst."
"This is the first time Ive had a Keystone brand beer since I can remember. It was offered by a friend during a recent visit to his home. Honestly, its an absolutely tasteless beer. Theres absolutely no smell, and just a shadow of a grass taste. Nothing really resembles a traditional beer flavor. Theres really no unpleasantness, its just a completely empty and hollow beer. Very watery body with a normal amount of carbonation. The head is initially fizzy, then non-existent (like a soda-pop). This just isnt for me."
"It crazy when I can buy a thirty pack of these Stones for less than I can buy a thirty pack of bottled waters. Although bottled water is pretty close to what this beer is. The color has to be the lightest shade of yellow possible as well. Its carbonated yellow water that someone through some alcohol into, because I have a hard time believing someone actually brews this."
"If you have ever wanted to get drunk whilst drinking water here is your chance. And this is the most unbelievably cheap beer in history. I think it might be cheaper than Natty which I didn't know was possible. You can pick up a nice 30 stones for a cool 11 bucks. 11 bucks???? They're practically giving it away, if you are in college why are you not drinking this? You'll never go broke again."
"overall this is a cheap beer and should be enjoyed as such, not as bad as other cheapo's"
"Overall: The thinnest, most insubstantial and least beer-like beer Ive ever tasted. There may be WORSE out there, but nothing more absolutely un-beer-like. Absolutely avoid."
"This is a college drinking beer for sure... If you want to drink a ton and not get filled up or get sick from a metal like taste, this is your beer. There is hardly anything too it. although it pretty much is a crap beer, doesn't taste like much of anything and it goes down smooth and since there isn't any aftertaste you can drink them all night long."
"This beer is terrible. No need to go into specifics. I don't even want to discuss the taste and appearance and etc. Its bad. The cheapest beer ever made. Good for college parties i guess. but if i have a choice in what i am drinking, i would never choose this."
"D: This is the definition of a session beer. Light, goes down easy, and won't normally give you a hangover unless you really deserve one. If you are looking for a flavorful beer, don't look here."
"Mouthfeel is very thin and very watery. It really leaves a bad aftertaste, too. Not really drinkable,at all."
"Just a mediocre macro beer."
"Drink-Ability: Ya Right, theres no way. This one is going into my DONT EVER DRINK AGAIN pile!"
"D: horrible. There's no way anyone can actually enjoy this one."
"Not much to be said about this really, pretty watery and tastes awful. The smell should pretty much discourage anyone from drinking this. The only upside is that its about 18 bucks for a 30 pack. This beer is only meant for college, specifically beer pong and other drinking games."
"Overall I'd recommend this beer over coors light for the price because the taste is just about the same and 'Stone Light is much cheaper. The only other time I'd recommend it is when quantity drinking or maybe to someone who isn't really a beer fan."
"No head, No smell, little taste. That about sums it up. Its good for those college parties when youve just finished finals on friday and headed home on sunday evening. I've had worse macros, and Key isnt offensive. It's just not good. No bitterness to by found at all. The only taste is a unidentifiable grain. Im guessing a mix of rice and corn, but i cant put my finger on it. I could easily finish the 30 rack on a saturday afternoon/evening. Only real purpose is to get drunk at a college party. (to be honest thats what i bought this one for; rugby championship/ halloween weekend)"
"Good for tailgaiting, beer pong, and such, which still admittedly happens."
"From when I first had it to now, I'd say the first beer takes like water with a dash of urine. The good thing about it is it's cheap, and if your in college, there's a great chance that it's not out-of-date beer."
"The beer is thin in: color, taste, head, all of the above. It is like yellow water with a touch of alcohol in it. There is no class in drinking this beer, but there are a lot of classes drinking it. $10 for a 30-rack... what of it?"
"Overall for the price it's not terrible compared to other low priced lagers but I see no reason to buy this beer."
"Keystone light is a very clear light straw colored beer. It had a white head for about 10 seconds. Barely and aroma at all. The taste was about the same as the aroma; not much there. This is petty much just a can of water with a little color and off-flavor added."
"Yum, rejected Coors Light. You get what you pay for, and in my case that was nothing. A 'friend' offered one of these to me, I drank it because honestly there was nothing else available. Its a pale yellow, I wouldn't even call it ""golden"". Tastes a bit like beer flavored water. You know, like those fruit flavored waters, only with beer instead of fruit. It does go down easy though, especially if you have a cold or something and can no longer taste."
"Cheers!"
"So put it in perspective. It's not like this beer is *good*, but when looking at the cheap end of the isle, I don't really look at anything else except PBR. Or maybe Stroh's."
"Drinkability - Might not be a bad replacement for water on a hot day. Hits the marks of the (admittedly uninspiring) standards for American light lager.  No real character to speak of. Relatively low price."
"Yuck...why am I drinking this? Oh yeah, because it's in my fridge and I'm half in the can from the delicious Ubu I just finished and don't want to waste any good beer when I'm ready to go to sleep as it is. What can I say about Keystone Light? Maybe if we added an ""assfeel"" category to beer reviews it would be a more accurate review. Let's just say this beer sucks, on the way down, and on the way out. (pleas note: this is left over from a camping trip and did not end up in my fridge willingly)."
"Keystone Light pours a pale straw color with a fluffy white head from a sixteen ounce can. There is very little aroma, no off smells, but not much of anything really. Wow, this tastes bad, really bad, worse than I expected, I was just thinking it would be typical macro swill with a watered down flavor. This is just plain bad. Avoid!!!"
"The first thing I noticed about this beer was the fact that it has absolutely no head whatsoever. It looks like yellow water, and tasts similar to that effect. However, I rather enjoy this beer due to its price point and the fact that contrary to popular belief it has just as much alcohol as coors/bud/miller light so that's not where the price relief comes from. The mouthfeel of this beer is... different. Very empty feeling, not much to discuss there. The smell is non-existent, seriously. No smell. Taste is pretty decent for something of this price, and I can imagine stocking my fridge with it for a good cheap ""want a beer"" type of beer, but my heart still lies with Nimbus Monkeyshine. But this beer brings me back to that first year of college... mmmm college party beer."
"If too much water is added while making the Silver Bullet, Coors must put that swill into a Keystone Light can. Carbonated water at best. I gave drinkability a 2.0 only because I have had worse. I had to give appearance and taste a 1.0 because the B.A. site doesn't have any zeros. And when I say zero I mean it! This has absolutely no color or smell. This is basically a mineral water. Thank God that my sampling came in an aluminum can. The can added some flavor. No hop, barley or malt whatsoever. When will society come to it's senses and stop the insanity! To spend even one penny of your hard earned money on this crap, which in turn helps finance one of the Big Three, is truly senseless."
"This is basically coor's light, but a little bit lighter. Most people can't tell the difference if you try to get them to differentiate. This beer is water. I think people only drink it because it's cheap. I had a girl try my miller then her keystone and she was like mine tastes all diluted. If you are playing a drinking game that will require you to drink a crap load of beer, then keystone would be a good pick. It's very easy to chug because it's basically just water. This beer also has NO color whatsoever. A very fainy smell as well. Don't order this beer if you are in the mood to just have a beer with a meal. This is a drinking game/save money on beer type beer. If you are looking only to save money though, I'd go with other beers. There are even cheaper beers that taste even better than keystone."
"'Avoid' is certainly the proper rating for this beer."
"Cheap beer, 30 pack cans here are $10.99. While I would not order this at a bar with dinner, it is good to drink when you have friend over playing XBox 360."
"The only reason to buy this beer is if you are a poor college student looking to imbibe mass quantities of beer, which I am. Obviously, this beer warrants no comparisons to any quality craft brew. It's probably the cheapest beers available, available at my local package store for $13 for a 30 pack. You're not supposed to taste this beer, you're supposed to drink it as fast as you can. Avoid tasting it at all costs, because what little flavor this beer posesses is not a very agreeable taste. If you're just looking to get drunk and are on a budget, this is the beer for you. On a side note, this is the only beer that has induced me to vomit."
"Damn! I just spilled this shit beer all over my computer! I'll be mad if this crappy beer ruins my computer. Now, if it were arrogant bastard, duvel, or perhaps a good scotch ale it would be understandable."
"Drinkability - Avoid at all costs. However, this beer is usually the top choice at parties because of its ultra-low price."
"O.When I was younger I thought that this it was not to bad in a pinch, but now IMHO it's best to leave this one to the college frats and softball teams to cheap to pitch in for Coors light."
"Of course I had this beer in a can, and when it's ICE cold, it's actually not too terrible; the cold overpowers any of the bad taste. Something I would drink fast for a buzz at a party, or after physical activities. It's a light yellow, much like urine, which one could argue is eerily similar to its taste. When warm it's nasty, and anytime you drink it it's watered down like crazy. What smell? There really is no smell, except out of a keg it has that crayon smell to it, and just cheap beer. The only reason it has a 2 drinkability is out of sheer frequency of drinking it, so I have become accustomed to it now. I mean seriously, what else are you going to drink at a college party? Cheap Beer- Keystone Light is the epitomy."
"Notes: You are either buying this because it is on sale... or because it is on sale. There is no way any self respecting lover of beer should be buying this stuff."
"Pours a pale straw with a large, white, fizzy, quickly diminishing head. The smell is very mild hay with barely any detectable hops. It has more of an adjunct taste than the aroma leads you to believe. Light grain and cooked corn with a hint of fruit on the finish. It has a thin, soda-like mouthfeel. First let me say that this is not a good beer at all. However, I cant blast it too hard because compared to the other ultra-watered-down domestic cheapos, you can do a lot worse. Sure it lacks character, but at least what IS there isnt completely revolting. Its easy to drinking and thirst quenching. A good beer to down after moving the lawn on a hot summer day could probably do it in a few seconds. But what I dont understand is that this is made by Coors and is marketed as a bargain beer, but I think this tastes better than Coors Light."
"Drinkability - I've had two of these suckers tonight. Easy to down, but I couldn't drink them all day like I've seen many of my friends do."
"poured a perfectly clear pale yellow color with adequate white puffy head that quickly fell to a thin ring. Smell is virtually non-existent with only a slight swwetness present. Taste is also very light and would be difficult to distinguish from water if not for the carbonation. Finish is virtually without taste. Spacer beer."
"Ha. Can provided by GABF as part of a reward for all my volunteer efforts for the 2005 show. Pours a one finger fizzy white head over a dull and very pale straw liquid. Think of it as a yellow ghost of a beer. Smells very very mild. Only a hint of malt sweet. Cardboard, corn, melon. Maybe a hint of hop floral (but I'm really searching). Tastes mild malt sweet that's in balance with acrid tang from the carbonation. Some cantelope and some cardboard. A bit tin-like, perhaps from hops...perhaps from the can. You know, this is actually a fairly drinkable beer. No, not challenging nor stellar, but pleasing in its simplicity. On a hot summer day, a nearly water-like beer like this could go down alright. Superthin mouthfeel and highly carbonated. The stamp on the bottom reads DEC18 037 31 F."
"This stuff is cheap (rightly so) and is therefore a good choice if you want to drink a lot fast. Other than that, try and avoid it."
"A light beer with taste... just the wrong taste in my humble opinion. I would have liked to have had a sweet barley malt instead of sweet corn but I guess any taste in a light beer is better than no taste at all."
"This is my fraternity's beer of choice. That should tell you something. Mainly that this is cheap and doesn't taste like beer. BeerAdvocate asks that when you slam a beer you must mention a good characteristic so here it is: This is the best beer for shotgunning I have ever found. Since it's closely related to bad tasting water, it just slides down the hatch."
"Overall: My Gawd. You mean to tell me that guy can get up in those commercials and talk about beer QUALITY( even in spanish)!!!??? I'm sorry. Busch beer is like Warsteiner compared to this. I mean, force carbonated, swill. It has alcohol and tastes somewhat like beer. That's all I'm gonna say."
"Pours straw gold, with incredible clarity. One finger head fizzles away like tonic water. No lacing, but carbonation is highly active. Strong esters and cereal adjunct in the nose, with no malt or hop aromas present. Sweet cereal flavor and mildly bitter aftertaste that may be hops. Finishes semi-dry, with a foul adjunct and ester taste clinging to the tounge. Light bodied and crisp, this would be refreshing and drinkable if not for the harsh taste."
"Just crap, but at least it goes down alright if you can stomach the taste and smell. It's cheap for a reason."
"Taste: Watered down. It's a light American Lager. There isn't much to say about mouthfeel but water, but - when it comes down to it, like a good number of the other reviewers here - this is a college beer. Something a number of people started drinking because they either knew no better or wanted a cheap buzz. I drank it for both reasons in school, but this isn't something I buy readily now unless I'm throwing a cheap bash for a bunch of people who are content with BMC because they'll drink this too. Either way, I don't necessarily hold it against this beer. That is what it's created for: the low on funds, adjunct lager lover"
"Drinkable given the situation--they were colder than cold, there was no water, it was hot and humid. Not something that I would normally go back to. If you hear any rumor that I beer-bonged this in the past, you will get a crisp ""no-comment."""
"Not as bad as I remember it, and likely better than Coors Light. I'd rather have no flavor than bad flavor."
"this might be your beer, but I woudn't recommend it."
"So, if there was nothing else, it won't kill you. Otherwise, I'd pass."
"This is the beer that people who live on the street drink. Come on. You're better than that."
"""Tastes like beer from a bottle because of the specially lined can"". And who could forget the ""Bitter beer face!"" comercials. (I could be wrong, but isn't bitterness in some beers a good thing?) One of the premier beers in my college days (and up until about two years ago). You could regularly find 30 'Stones for 10 bones here in Lincoln. Now I guess they think they're more premium because it usually goes for aroung $13, and a good deal is when someone has it on sale for $12. I can remember buying a 30 or two on Friday, and having it last all weekend (could not buy beer on Sundays back then). College is great, especialy in the fall. Sitting around all day Saturday drinking, watching football on TV, playing video games, ordering pizza so you don't have to get cleaned up to go out. Sobering up enough Sunday afternoon to do homework while watching more football. I'm glad I took 7 years to graduate."
"I was surprised that no aspect of this beer really turned me away, but there's nothing too good either."
"Taste is like water, goes down real quick, hard to believe you could get drunk off this stuff. Harmless drink overall, can't find it in a bottle. I've only found it in a can, not even on tap, not that it matters because no real drinker would ever drink this often. Only for the poor college kid like myself , at 12 bucks a thirty pack it does the job but there are far better beers for only a buck more."
"Drinkability: No one in his right mind should buy this filth. There are better beers for the money."
"For what it is and who it's marketed for, it could be worse. For me, I'd rather drink ocean water. At least ocean water's got some flavor to it."
"Flavor is...well, I was actually expecting something, maybe a ricey flavor, or perhaps a little hops. There honestly is no flavor whatsoever. It tastes exactly like seltzer water. I seriously had a hard time drinking this, because of the serious bitter water taste, without any pleasant hop bitterness or malt. I don't think they use malt in this ""beer"". As it warms up, you get a hint of sugar and corn, which was actually a welcome change. There's actually a touch of green apple tartness somewhere beneath the huge carbonation. I think that's a sign of the bottom of the ladder in quality. Body on this beer was, if I may guess, a 0.098 final gravity. I think it may actually be lighter than water. Carbonation is very high and very forced, I think I'd prefer this flat. I can't believe I drank this crap. It's honestly the worst beer I've ever had, if you can call it beer."
"not overly impressed with this beer, again as usual more taste than bud light but not great by any strech.not good but there is worse out there, smells and looks bad, tastes ok, maybe compareable to busch, try to avoid this if better beer is available"
"This is a very watered down tasting beer with high carbonation. The alcohol content seems low as I seem to always put away more than half the 30 pack with somewhat ease. I mainly purchased this due to the price, $9.95 for a 30 pack. It has gone up since a few dollars which keeps me away. There really isn't much difference than this and Coors. I had a few ""skunked"" keystone lights and they actually had some characteristics mixed with added aluminum flavor. If you drink this beer enough you begin to pick up hints of banana hiding behind all the carbonation. A very easy beer to drink largs amounts of when you are in college. Priced correctly as well."
"While this beer is rather pedestrian in appearance, upon scientific inspection, it was concluded that it in fact has more color and carbonation than Coors light. Not that it has much, by any means. The smell is kind of strange, with a hint of sharp cheddar cheese and bubble gum mixed in with the metallic flavors that compliment the rice and malt. Theres no flavor to it, but granted that some beers actually make me perform what professional eaters refer to as the ""Reversal of Fortune," its better than some. Mouthfeel is thinner than water, somehow, and the carbonation is very basic. I rank it above coors light, but was not impressed. But cheers, and heres to small beer budgets on the 4th of july."
"a typical college party beer. I've had stones many times, and each time i get the same feeling, why am i drinking this crap? It has a feel about as light as mgd light in my opinion, and a taste about as bad as a skunky, watered down coors light. with the bad taste, and lack of carbonation, i suppose the only upside is around here you can get a 24 pack for 8 dollers. if i get this desperate, i'm going to go with mad dog 20/20 again. at least it's a bit cheaper..."
"Wow, this is crap. Piss yellow, white head, QUICKlY dissipates to NO HEAD, not even a bubble! No aroma (maybe a little corn), no taste,no malt,no hops. Obviously not much going on here, except a pure waste of decent water, aluminium etc etc. I truly would rather drink seltzer. Dont support Coors, dont buy this stuff. I took a can out of a cooler at a neighborhood picnic a few weeks back, just for beer research purposes...."
"Keystone Light is about has watered down a beer has you'll ever find. No head, next to no taste, but then again this isn't meant to be a beer for a fine meal. It's a beer-pong beer, and unlike Beast it doesn't become undrinkable has it warms. So if you can, drop an extra buck on a case of Keystone and you'll have a lot less people hugging the toilet at your parties."
"The only reason this beer is drinkable is because its refreshing and thats why i kinda like it. Its pale yellow like most light beers but its definately better than its older brother coors light. Not much taste but hints of rice, and some malt yet almost no hop bitterness at all."
"I need some more reviews to get my mug, so I'm reviewing good old keystone light. Served to myself in a pint glass from the kegerator in my living room. Pale yellow with lots of fizz (oops, better turn the CO2 down). The ""head"" that was there is gone within 30 seconds. The smell is very thin, almost not there. I guess it smells like cheap adjunct, mostly rice. The taste is poor but not horrible. It is very thin, very watery and has an unexpected sweetness. I used to laugh at the commercials with the bitter beer face guy. Now they just make me shake my head. No hops whatsoever. Made for drunks and college students, of which I am both on occasion. Really though, who's gonna buy this to enjoy?"
"Coors, who really have no integrity when it comes to brewing anyway, should really be ashamed of themselves with this product. There is a total lack of imagination and a lack of pride in every can. In my oppinion, Keystone Light should be boycotted by all. It is a complete and utter act of disrespect to the beer drinking community and a mockery to the intellegence of its patrons."
"No redeeming characteristics. I mean NONE. Pours a piss yellow color. Smell iscrisp? Clean? Nothing defining. One of the blandest tasting beers Ive ever had. Gave it a 1.5 because it doesnt actually taste foul, it just tastes like nothing. No hops, no malt, just alcoholic seltzer water. Drinkability is average, because it is quite drinkable. Then again, so is water. Gotta love hating light beers."
"Cheers"
"Although the first time I had this beer was when I was playing beer pong, I decided not to write a review until I was able to drink this when i was completely sober. Keystone is pretty good for a light beer, I like it much better then its sister light beer, the Coors Light. Its slightly watered down, but not as watered Natural Light or Busch Light. A decent overall domesticated light beer."
"BTW, I am drinking the watered down Okie version which can not be more than 4.0% abv/3.2 by weight."
"It really is more than a 1.5 drinkability factor, but I couldn't bring myself to give any more credit for this flavorless shit. It pours a pale straw. The fizzy head fizzles into oblivion, though a seltzery effervescence remains. The aroma is of damp socks...nothing else. This beer (?) is more bland and flavorless than Coors Light, and that's saying something. It has nothing, in the way of beer, going for it."
"I have to admit, the marketing was right, I didn't have a ""bitter beer face"". But then again, this isn't beer, and there's no such thing as a ""bitter water face"". Is there? I can't believe this is more expensive than any beer. It seems as if there's nothing in it at all."
"If you're looking for a light beer with reduced calories, this one fits the bill with just 104 calories, 5 grams of carbs, .7 grams of protein and 0 fat. It pours a crystal-clear light-gold body and a good-sized head of bright-white foam that vanishes almost immediately. Only a thread of a collar is left behind and, as might be expected, it leaves no lace. A generic beer aroma with a bit of yeasty sulphur greets you as you raise the glass - or specially lined can ;) - to your lips. The body is light and crisp with a fine, median level of carbonation that gives a bit of a tingle in the mouth. The flavor displays a quick note of sweet, adjunct laden malt before drying at mid-palate. It finishes dry with a light wash of alcohol and leaves just a thin film of sweetness in the mouth. It's a pretty vacant beer, but that's to be expected for the style. It's incredibly easy to drink - almost like a can of seltzer - but what's the point? There are more satisfying light beers available."
"I bought a case of Stones for a (non-beer drinking) friend, and was ashamed to take it out to my car. Nevertheless, I took home a can to review. It poured an extremely pale yellow color, with a really strange, artificial, loud soda-like fizziness. The small head disappeared to absolutely nothing but a dime-size pile of suds on the top of the beer. There was a faint scent of malt, I think, but it had virtually no smell. A faint malt taste was present, but the expected generic watewred down flavor was present. Never bitter because there's no hops! Or taste, really. Barely palatable, Keystone Light should only be consumed in emergencies or to avoid being rude while at a friend's place. Yuck."
"This has a watery mouthfeel and taste, like it was bilge water someone stuck into a bottle across the street from a brewery. I had no idea it had so much as 4.2% ABV, which probably does the poor fratboys no favors at the end of the night. Because it tastes like bad water with a hint of beer in the background, I guess in a way its easily drinkable, so long as the drinker is unburdened by the need for flavor, character of any kind, etc."
"Drinkability/notes: In my opinion, a beer aimed at little more than fueling a quick buzz. Though cheap and available, it is far removed from good beer. Overall, quite shallow in character."
"Fills the need to have beers to rate across the spectrum. Typical low end yellow with a standard pale lager appearance, very little smell and next to no flavor except that of sweet malt with added adjuncts. Mouthfeel is thin and watery with forced cabonation and a bit of astringency."
"Wow! I didn't think beer could be this flavorless. Now, in the past I've used the term ""tastes like water"" to describe beers in the past, but in all of those cases, I'd been exagerrating at least a little bit. But now I can honestly say that Keystone Light really tastes like day-old bath water. I honestly couldn't taste anything when I drank this beer aside from a sickeningly weak hint of yeast. Another terrible light beer from Coors."
"There is no point in pouring this beer into a glass before consumption. The reason being that the point of doing so would be to accentuate the aroma of the beer by giving it some head in the glass. This beer, however, neither smells nor tastes good. It has no hops, and it tastes like some slightly dirty water you might find in a puddle while hiking. My buddies might contend that it's ""not that bad"" compared to some of the other mass-produced shite that college kids drink. But if you're looking for a session beer, why waste your money on 30-'stones when you could go out and buy a case of Pabst??"
"Word to the wise: drinking 37 of these bad boys in one sitting can result in you winding up in school-imposed alcohol screening."
"Notes: It is what it is, a cheap crappy light beer. For people that are so worried about the price of beer and think they need to drink light beer this is for them. Sadly what they spend on a six pack, which most down in less than an hour, they could buy one bottle of real ale from England and actually have some respect for beer. Or even a bomber of Euro lager with real hop flavour ..."
"If I'm going to go with a cheap canned beer for budget reasons than this is what I choose. Looks like most other macros with a clear light golden color. There is a lot of carbonation and usually not much of a head. This stuff is very easy to drink, hardly any taste at all but without the metallic aftertaste of many other light beers. Use to drink this a lot in high school but not any more wouldn't mind having one for old times sake."
"Oh, I figured I would eventually break down and review a canned beer. Well, my roomate picked up a case of this stuff, and he swares by it. Yes pretty much this is his beer of choice, not only option, just choice. So, I figured I would review it, never actually had this beer in a can, just in high school as the typical keg swill. I cracked the can unleashing all of the artificial carbonation, and she pours a pale golden straw color that contains a very fizzy white head. Definitely nothing looking appetizing or impressive here. I continute to attempt to detect some aroma, and to my surprise it isn't repulsive as I had thought with a sweet lemon grass aroma with just a touch of hops in the background. With the still semi-pleasant aroma in my senses, I proceed with my first sip. This beer contains nothing great, in fact it is made with the cheapest of ingredients, but it actually brings a balanced flavor that is highly drinkable. The corn and rice, along with some malt produces a very sweet finish to this beer that in my opinion kicks Coors Light's ass. This does have some flavor to it, maybe not what I want out of a beer, but for the college student looking to relieve some stress and catch a nice buzz this beer does it's duty. I can't tear Keystone Light apart, because it has flavors that were designed to be completely unoffensive and in tact with the most amount of people as possible. The mouthfeel is like carbonated water, and yes this beer will go down in number with a low alcohol percentage you could probably put down alot of this, but in my opinion I really don't want to. I just wish this wasn't the only style of beer that's predominantly enjoyed by the masses, because they are missing out on a world of great beer styles. Oh, and by the way you better drink this one cold, because when it starts warming you will taste the difference."
"This is great alternative to Coors Light. Keystone tastes almost the same as as Coors but it costs much less. If you are a college kid and you don't want to be drinking Milwaukee's Best, this beer is the perfect solution. It has a crisp, clean taste that is about six dollars per twelve pack. Not the best beer, but a good quality for the price."
"My rating is a little weird because, for me part of drinkability is price and this is dirt cheap. Purely as a beer this is not very good at all. The poor had a pure white head, as most of these beers do, that disapated in seconds. The beer itself was carbonated for less time than some chemicals on the periodic table exist. It tasted like I was drinking yellow sparkling water with alcohol in it. But when its as cheap as this I don't think I can complain too much."
" college parties. It is better than ""The Bull"" though."
"Keystone light is not all that bad for the money, but when you can have some decent stuff for a few bucks extra, why not drop a couple of dollars more ? It's very light in color, no head to speak of and has a bit of a watered down taste, even on light beer standards. If you are going to go with this self-proclaimed ""Never Bitter Beer"" do so when it is very cold, as drinking Keystone light at any temp above 50 degrees is asking for a churning stomach. Personally I do like this stuff, but then again I am a fan of Coors Brews."
"I would recommend this over Coors Light because this stuff actually has some taste to it. Another beer best left to broke college kids."
"Can Coors taste worse? Yes. This was the swill that most of my friends drank in college. I had my share of it, but never bought any myself. If you can drink a case of beer yourself in a sitting, its not a good sign, and you may have a problem."
"very clear, very pale, very little head and lots of carbonation. a light grainy aroma, no hop aromas or flavors but a hop crispness somewhere in the mouthfeel. for a light beer this isn't too bad. i'd rather drink this than miller or bud or coors light. has some very faint cereal grain flavors and a nice smoothness. regardless...it's watery, weak and wimpy. high drinkability makes this good swill for washing down any meal of the day, including breakfast."
"A friend left one of these at my house on Halloween, presumably to scare me.  It is a very pale straw yellow (hey, it's a light beer).   It had a very foamy head that died quickly.  Carbonation is fairly large bubbles, and feels harsh on the tongue.  Overall mouthfeel is very thin, reminiscent of the hard cider I tried recently.  The taste is somewhat masked by the carbonation, with a sweet note on the finish, followed by a metallic aftertaste.  No aroma to speak of.  My friends drink this often, but it seems like carbonated mineral water to me.  Completely uninspiring."
"i thought the alcohol was 3.1%, but i could be wrong. a few of my friends drink this shit religiously. it is water. nothing else but water. water is better than a terrible beer, so it is not the worst you could do to yourself"
"Very pale, straw colored beer, without much smell at all, maybe a little grain. The foam quickly dies, and all that is left is a pathetic ring. Carbonation is what you would expect from a macro. The taste isn't too noticable. Grainy flavors, a little metal, a little corn sweetness, and a tiny, tiny bit of malt. I forgot about the hops, well, so did Coors when making this one. It's not bad or undrinkable only because it isn't offensive."
"Awfully pale gold, paltry white head, soapy retention, spotty lace. The nose is faintly sweet, kind of flat boring. Amazingly plain tasting, flavorless, mildly sweet. I cant taste any hops or malt. No body of note, water-like. Now I understand why it is so popular because it is a beer for people who want to get drunk without drinking beer. Skip this mess; its not up to BA standards."
"Pours a very clear pale golden color with a 1 1/2 finger head that dissipates quickly.  The smell is very faint and can only identify enough to verify it is beer.  The taste is consistent with the smell as it is faint too.  It has quite a bit of carbonation that provides the only bitterness that it carries as there is no evidence of hops are even within 5 miles of the brewery.  The mouthfeel is very thin and watery, but surprisingly due to the blandness, is very drinkable in large quantities.  Watered-down Cheers!"
"Do these things still have the ""specialty lined can""?  I couldn't bear to look inside to see.  A very, very weak offering.  The taste is on par with most other light beers, but for some reason it has a funky, metallic taste to it.  ""Bitter beer face?""  That's the face you make when you realize you could've and should've drank a better beer."
"As light beers go, this is the wateriest of the watery. My roommate loves this stuff because he can drink 100 of them in about 8 minutes. It's a bit high priced in comparison to other light beers (Nattie, Beast). They are basically all the same, so the cheapest one wins. You wont get a bitter beer face, but then again, you wont think you are drinking beer."
