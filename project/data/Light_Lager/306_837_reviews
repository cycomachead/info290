"Terrible. Tastes like any other crap light beer"
""
""
"Haven't had one in years.  Not missing much"
"Piss, absolute piss deserving of no further commentary."
""
"Don't let it get warm"
"pretty good for a lite beer"
"O: unpleasant, a bit nasty, not so bad after a few sips, I would drink this on a hot day if I was thirsty"
""
"Not very good, don't suggest it."
""
""
""
""
"Good beer, lighter than u would expect."
""
"Shitty.  Only drink to get drunk, even then it doesn't do the job"
"Ok beer but nothing to write about"
"This is obviously not a great beer, but it doesn't taste bad and it has good mouthfeel. Far superior to Bud Light, though that's not saying much."
""
"Appearance: pale straw with a fizzy white foam cap. Smell: smells like nothing – corny if anything with a little green apple Taste: crisp with apple, maybe a little corn, no hops, balanced towards the malt – what little there is. Mouthfeel: thin, light, watery, high carbonation, slight carbonic bight."
""
"Stay away from it, no taste or feel to it."
"O-  Inoffensive and bland.  Advertise anything well enough and sheeple will buy it.  None of that pesky flavor to get in the way of drinkability.  Eh."
""
"Lite gold with white top. Whisper of biscuits. Lemon water flavor. Lite mouthfeel. Corporate meh, but better than most lagers I've been drinking lately in Ecuador..."
"This shit is absolutely disgusting"
""
"Coors light isn't good at all, I found it much too sweet."
"the comercials for this beer are perfect, there is no mention of taste or flavor Yet the fact that it is cold is hyped up. This beer looks like colored seltzer,smells like corn,and tastes like water. However it is cold."
"Not much other than a water taste."
"My go-to cheap beer. When I don't have too much to spend it makes me happy to see the blue mountains. Overall not a bad beer in my opinion."
""
""
"Those hot summer  BBQ days"
""
""
"want to drink beer-flavored soda-water? desire urinating twelve times before you get a buzz? this is the beer for you."
""
""
""
"essentially water although not the worst tasting beer out there."
""
""
""
"It sucks, I would only drink this beer if someone else bought it and offered it to me."
"River beer at its best"
"Not a fan of this beer"
"This trash isn't worth justifying a 1.5."
"this stuff was fantastic when i was in high school"
""
"Beer is terrible and smells like wet cardboard."
""
""
""
""
"Best of the domestic competition"
""
"Yep.  Light for sure.  On every!"
""
""
""
""
"This isn't beer! Foam flavored water!"
""
""
"Nice and crisp beer pong beer"
"Have you been to Golden?...> St Louie or wherever..."
"Like budweiser but worse. No distinctive taste to speak of."
""
""
"Absolutely horrendous.  Looks like a watered down Mountain Dew.  What little flavor it does have makes you wish you had never opened the bottle."
""
""
"2/16/15 (Aluminum Bottle) - Hadn't had a Coor's light in a while. Wide mouth bottle, but poured into a glass. Very light colouring, with minimal aroma. Tasted OK, and it went down smooth and easy. Not a bad beer if you just want a cold drink with minimal taste and calories, but I typically seek out stronger beers with varied taste."
"Better then water, worse then beer, it's Coors light"
""
"Like drinking water no taste"
"After drinking this, you'll need a silver bullet."
"This beer is straight garbage"
"its coors light. goes down easy."
""
""
""
"O:  An ok beer if your planning on drinking several in one setting but there are some much better ones out there for that application"
"Super easy to drink but doesn't taste great"
""
"Probably the better out of the cheap light beers."
"Classic volume beer. Not much else."
""
""
""
"if your judging this beer against the light lager style it is not awful.   it is the classic example.   is it a delicious beer?  no."
"That this inexpensive light beer is rated awful is surprising. It is not a great beer. It's a light crisp clean lager. And it tastes good."
""
"This is a pretty good everyday drinker.  More suited for those who do not desire a full bodied beer, or those new to drinking."
""
""
""
""
"Very light, but it doesn't taste bad."
"Another super light & refreshing, crisp beer that's best from the can.  A mood enhancing can of water."
""
"It's okay as far as commercial light beer goes."
"Very smooth on draught, not a bad beer"
""
"This beer is for beer pong..."
"Better than miller light or bud light, but not much else."
""
""
""
"Joking aside it isn't terrible on super hot day....but then water works as well."
""
""
"2nd worst in a blind taste test of 7 AALs.  Metallic, bad aftertaste."
""
""
"Best on draft. Very refreshing for a light beer."
"One of the worst beers I have ever tasted!"
""
"Just the worst. Let's be honest. It was good for beer pong in college, but serves no purpose any longer."
""
""
""
"Meh. It's coors. What do you expect."
"If I arched my own urine stream into my mouth it would be more pleasant than this ""beer"". That is all."
"Barely drinkable and stale boring beer with no freshness."
"It's better than nothing...right?"
"Might as well drink water..........tap water."
"My favourite light beer for bbq and summer. Only criticism is it's slightly over carbonated."
"Overall not half bad for a micro-lager. Well honestly watery but enough to taste a little flavor"
"Plain beer that to ne is very blah of a beer."
"Tastes like fresh spring water mixed with a tiny bit of beer. This is a great beer anytime You need to tie one on and quench your thirst such as, after hockey or while installing a privacy fence. Coors Lite tastes great on lips of a young grad student at karaoke night. Serve at your next couples dinner to prove the point that your not interested in a lot of discussion, just gettin smashed."
"overall 1.25 the best cheap terrible  beer"
""
""
"On first sip I taste the pure a natural taste of The Rockies.. This is great!... Cold, refreshing, tastes great.  As I continue to drink I think I understated my first statement and blasphemed the true king of light beers.  Seriously though it's a good light beer for what it is."
""
"Overall: I'm glad I didn't pay for this and I can't ever see buying it in the future. I took two or three swallows and confined the rest of it to the sink. I really wish I had had a beer with my lunch."
"Pours a nice golden color with thick head that quickly diminishes to less than a lace. Slightl less corn adjunct aroma than most and I sense a little malt. Surprised on the flavor, way more than most adjunct lagers, let all light her beers. Sense a little hops also. By far the best light beer I've had."
""
""
"I think some of the reviewers are overreacting about it tasting bad. Its a little tasteless and watery but its not horrible. Main reason i don't like it is because it gives me horrible heartburn some reason. Maybe the high carbonation."
"Avoid at all costs.  It's basically dirty water, with HFCS added."
""
""
""
""
"I would tell national secrets before drinking another one of these."
"Taste like watered down piss, but if that's what you like, hey that's you."
"I'm guessing it wasn't fair to drink this after a Trappist Rochefort 10. :lol:"
""
""
""
""
""
"Hey, you may catch a buzz if you drink a case!"
"I mean it's Coors light...lol"

"My light beer of choice. enough said. I've Drank so much of this rocky mountain kool aid and i'll drink a whole lot more. Good stuff."
""
""
""
""
"I will not drink this beer unless there are no other choices."

"It's a light beer, you get what you get."

"Tastes like ice water with just the faintest hint of corn. Smells similar. Looks like watered down piss. Feel, water again. Overall is this beer or water, can't really tell?"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Probably one of the best cheap beers that come in a 36 pack that you can get. Crisp and light with endless gmo's that you would expect to come in acheaply mass produced American lager. makes me wanna watch those Coors light and ice cube  commercials over and over again."
""
""
""
"This beer is pretty good."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Coors Light is great for what its supposed to be; a light, practically tasteless lager. Don't fool yourself...Coors Light isn't trying to impress anyone. Its an easy drinking, non-offensive beer that practically anyone can ""enjoy"". While I wouldn't go out on a limb to buy this beer for myself, I certainly wouldn't turn one down if offered one ;)."
"I buy it from time to time; simply because it is cheap and works well for my pretend diet, as it is a ""light"" beer."

"Overall: As ""light"" as they come, but absolutely dreadful. Do yourself a favour and drink vodka with some water because that would taste way better."

"I can drink right from the can now they're vented!"

"When the mountains are blue, it's time to party. That's what my ass says to the toilet before the beer shit explosion speckles my porcelain like a robin's egg. Seriously, my Clorox resigned and hit the road when it saw the damage. Thanks, Coors. My cleaning products would rather stand shivering in the cold waiting for bread rations than deal with the plague you placed upon my colon."
""
""
"Overall: so I've finally had Coors. I heard it was dreadful and have to admit that I didn't find it all that bad. The problem is that there are plenty of other mid-strength lagers for an equivalent price (AU$40 per case of 24 x 355ml), that are of far better quality. I'll just take a Carlton Mid, thanks all the same."

"water nuff said"
"The beer looks like water with a tinge of yellow. There is a faint malt aroma and malt taste with some corn mixed in. No hop presence.  Though there isn't anything offensive here, there is virtually no taste."

"A lot of people on here are going to hate on this beer, but for me I like Coors light for what it is. It does not try to be different or interesting in anyway, But if I'm going to drink a wheelbarrow of it like god intended its the best for that in my opinion. So on to its taste, This is the hardest part for me it taste like water with beer flavoring, kind of like beef flavored Ramen, tastes nothing like beef but has a hind of beef flavor to it. But at the same time I have no idea why I like or keep buying maybe its the marketing, maybe its the fact that I've drank so much Pabst at this point that if I drink anymore I'll go into shock and start foaming from the mouth. but most of all its the best of the worst in my mind, bud is for Necks and southerners, and miller, I have no idea who drinks that shit other then hipsters. But for the rest of us at a sporting event or really anywhere that you need to drink 5 beers in 45 mins Coors is the beer of choice. here to Coors and here's to 'Merica!!!!"

"Overall (2.29) : I do keep this on hand in my fridge from time to time. Awhile back I logged on and reviewed Keystone Light on its own merit and reflected against this beer, because rumor has it it's the same recipe from the same brewer but a little more stale. I can confirm that they taste similar - but Coors light has a bite, crispness, and fresh taste that Keystone lacks. I think it's the difference between a crisp apple and one left out for a day. Keystone compounds that lack of crispness with adding extra smoothness so it's in fact the opposite mouthfeel of Coors light. I like it better than Keystone. As for whether its worth the extra price, well, I don't know. I do know I'd reach for this over keystone light in an ice cooler. It's the superior product. Better than bud light, not as good as miller lite. So there you have it."

"I enjoy this brew. Its  the only thing i have bought with my own money as far as alcohol. My friend introduced me to the silver bullet one day. I thought it was a bit stronger than bud light. At this point, I was kind of wanting to try stronger beers. So it was a refreshing change, while still being inoffensive.  Now, i drank it today after having some the other day. It has no flavor to speak of. Its kind of sweet though. Its nothing really memorable.  Poured into glass gently so there would be no foam. The foam really makes me sick to my stomach. So light beer is really good because of that.   pale golden liquid. Never actually seen it out of the bottle till today.  Its smell is kind of sweet.  Its inoffensive. I can't really taste anything other than a slight beer taste. Very forgettable. Its good for me to drink when i get thirsty. I would buy it again. Best beer I drink all the time"
""
""
""
""
"Probably the best light beer out there."
""
""
"In comparison to  stuff that i recently tried, being corona and founders and things of that sort, this is not as good. But for the category its still a little bit worse than miller lite. I mean coors is good for when im thirsty. I wouldn't turn one of these down ice cold on a hot day."

"OVERALL:  Must remember to ""respect beer"" at this moment.  This is a beer that would appeal to people on a diet who want to drink beer but do not necessarily like beer.  It has a bland, weak taste that is in no way appealing to me.....at all.  If you are fat and don't really like beer but just want to ""fit in"" then this is your beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a pale, almost clear yellow with no head to speak of. The smell is metallic but with hints of fruit and even a little hop. The taste had a lot of rice in it, and then a touch of sweetness on the end. Very faint flavors."
"This is a beer that like mineral water quenches the thirst without taste to speak of. There are no flaws to the brew, no off flavors, which is difficult to do in such a bland beer. As an engineer I admire this but as a beer lover I disdain this approach to beer. I am sure that I have never before rated a flawless beer that low"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Not as bad as I thought this would be. Not a snob, it's just with so many other options out there it is amazing to me why people actually like this."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Straw yellow, almost no head with a slight astringent finish reminiscent of hops."
""
""
""
""
"Nice water taste ."
"It is a great breakfast beer, or a beer that you drink for the sake of drinking all day and night. I loved this beer in junior high, but now only meets my needs when shot-gunning."

"So overall would I recommend it ? Yes ! If u are at the swimming pool and u need a refreshing beer give a try to the coors light. Definitely one of my beer that I drink during summer."

"Nothing wrong with anyone who enjoys this beer; they'll just be very hydrated."
""
""
"Incredible Beer Love to drink it all the time"
"Pours a pale golden in color with a very thin white head. Very little spotty lacing is seen. The aroma is just of some grains for the most part. The taste is about the same with a hint of sweet corn also. On the thin side. Lots of carbonation. Nothing real special here but a decent light brew for the warmer months. Overall, I still like it."
""
""
""
"This is really the only other beer I like besides Guinness. Not gonna go into flavor we all know what coors is like. I drank 12 of these at the pay lake by myself without getting drunk. Didn't have a hangover either. I give it a 5 because this is my macro beer of choice."

"That being said, there is little else to recommend it. I don't think the Silver Bullet is brewed for making memories. It's brewed to be guzzled, and Coors does a good job in delivering what the guzzlers want."

""
""
""
""
""
""
"I only gave it a 1.25 because I felt bad giving it a 1. When they said Tap the rockies, I didn't think they meant literally put a tap in the mountains and pull all the animal pee and poo out and put it in a can... On a high note, the can is kinda cool with the mountains that turn blue, although you would have to be of low intelligence to not know if your beer was cold.."

"My heart doc said that I needed to drink less beer, so Coor's was my choice. I figured that a poor tasting beer would slow me down, and maybe enjoy the better beers a lot more. Well, after a few years of Coor's light, it has slowed me down. I quit when I should, and get some sleep. While I prefer a hefe-weizen for quenching my thirst, the Coors is fine for the times when the lawn must be mowed.and it is hot outside. In that regard, Coor's light is OK. While I do not recommend it as an All-American beer, it seems to taste a bit better than any other light beer I have tried."

"Overall: I think this beer is okay, and the only regular macrobrew (or light beer for that matter) I will drink besides Budweiser. This is a beer for sitting outside on a hot day drinking and talking with friends, or a light drink whenever the thirst comes for it. This is a beer that can go down fast, and drunkenness would come fast (because it's so easy to drink). Reminds me of those crystal light water flavorings, but in beer flavor -its light and tastes like water. This is not a full flavored beer to sit and slowly sip. Just a simple brew with little flavor. I think it is okay."

"There was a saying I once heard, ""Beer and Girls, When it's good it's good and when it's bad, well it's still ok."" This guy must not have drank many Coors Lights. This is some aweful stuff. I'd give up beer if this was all there was. It tastes like pizza cardboard soaked in water and mixed with fruit loops. With a lot of metallic. If you drink 3 quickly then it doesn't taste as bad but beware it cause severe belly bloat. Also causes insane diarrhea the next day. Avoid this stuff"

"I give you.... your party beer. It comes in a can, a bottle, a party ball, and a keg. Solid for beer pong and beer bongs, alike. I've never made so many mistakes for under the cost of Whopper meal - which, appropriately enough, will be some undergrad's main source of sustenance at 3:00am this Saturday night. It's a table beer. Not the kind you enjoy for the taste, the look, or to promote your local Rockies. It's sole purpose, in the opinion of this lowly beer enthusiast, is to get you where you need to be (am I right, fellas?). More so, it's your gateway brew to better and bolder beers. Coors Light is what I started drinking before I became better acquainted with the wide world of ales and lagers. I, like so many other rebellious youth, was introduced to this great and diverse realm of beer by the welcoming, but not above mediocre, drinkability of Coors Light. And for that, we thank you."

"This beer is a heavy beer. At least I think it is heavy. It is a good beer. Not my favorite but I still like this beer. It has a strong aroma to it. Even though it is not my favorite beer, I still have one every now and then. I would not have any problem recommending it to friends and family."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall I think Coors Light is just fantastic. It is a beer for whenever you want to just sit around with friends and drink a ton of beer. Won't fill you up. Won't let you down. You need to drink about 25 to get truly drink, but it's enough that each beer will keep the buzz going. As refreshing as they come."

"Cleaner than the three beers I have mentioned above and perhaps second to Sam Adams Light for this style so far for me. There actually is some flavor of grain and yeast without much of that light lager off-flavor."

"Hi, I am from Colorado and I love this beer. Here in Colorado we know some things. Mountains lead west, Coor's Light is the best, and the Denver Broncos are going to win the super bowl every year. I know I have a picture of Bert Farver as my profile and it is true I want them to bring back Bert just so I can watch the Broncos make that old man cry over and over again."

"Overall: This was the second highest rated light lager rated for the tournament bracket and it is still a piss-poor beer. A sweet, watery mess that will get you drunk if you have enough."

"Flavor: not much to say here. Take a Coors Original and add about 20% water. There is some light flavor of corn husks and sweet barley malt with no detectable hops. Mostly it tastes like a malty mineral water."

"I really don't like drinking light beers - but when you over at a friends and that's what's offered, you take it with a smile. Nonetheless, I really don't like them. But of the light beers I've had, this is the ""best"" of the lot. And another thing I've learned - your typical big, American brewery, or for that matter, big brewery beer just doesn't cut it for me any more. The craft beers I focus on are way better than the glut of stuff you find in WalMart. Anyway, Coor Light for all of its advertising is just a tiny bit better than ok - when nothing else is offered..."

"Not sure who this review is going to appeal to. I don't know many beer drinkers that haven't had a Coors Light at some point in their life. Extremely generic. Little to no flavor, very watery. Foamy when poured, but almost scentless, airy foam. Serves the purpose of high volume drinking, useful at least for playing games or long days involving heavy consumption, but otherwise purposeless beer. No idea why anyone would pay for this for any reason other than to drink without feeling too full."

"Very boring beer. If you're looking for a beer with not much taste and no originality, look no further. Basic beer that you can get for very cheap. This beer is very common among college age students because it is easy to find anywhere and it is very inexpensive."
"Definetly a bland and boring beer as far as beer goes. Yet somehow it refreshes and hits the spot very easy drinking for a pale lager. Transparent clear yellow body. Best when enjoyed ice cold. Very common among college age people most likely because of the inexpensive aspect of this beer. Overall an enjoyable experience."

"Coors Light pours a light yellow with a very transparent body. The head retention is very low. I found the aroma to be non-assertive. I could make associations to sparkling water, corn and minerals. The mouthfeel is expectedly light with fizzy carbonation. Flavor notes are again quite mild with suggestions of seltzer water, canned corn and distant grains. A notion of European hops could be sensed with enough concentration. Coors Light is very true to the macro-adjunct lager style. It could be improved, in my opinion, with a bit more character from the barley and hop bill."

"This is my beer of choice as far as cheap american beer goes. Lets get one thing strait. There's a huge difference in beers Referring to the saying ""You get what you pay for!"" If your not expecting much in the way of taste but more for fill then Coors Light fits the bill. It has a good taste and no after taste. Though a little watery tasting if your looking for some thing light this is it as far as I am concerned. Clearly though when separating men from boys in beer sense Coors Light is still a boy."

"Coors Light brewed by Coors. This brew has an ABV 4.2. The brew pours out a light amber color with a small white head. Coors Light smells like beer that all I can say. As far as taste, there is not much there. It is like drinking water with a hit of beer. This beer goes down smooth. There is nothing bad about this brew- but there could be more to it. To me it is to light, but is drinkable. Overall, I give this brew a 3 out 5."

"I have had out of can, bottle, tap, and directly from brewery, but this is based the old silver bullet. Poured into a pilsner glass, the head quickly disipates into the yellow-gold donkey piss that they are mislabeling as beer. Nice sweet metallic taste. Thank God they had the ""cold indicator"" on there. I tried to tell by touching it, but just couldn't be sure and didn't have the balls to try it. This stuff makes Coors original taste more like a Boston Lager. They don't even have good tv spots anymore. Remember when they used ""man on the silver mountain"" ? Seriously, is anyone reading this? I am just reviewing to kill time at my daughter's dance practice. There is no way anyone is really looking at Coors Light reviews for any reason other than their daily dose of sarcasm. I could probably keep my bank account login information safe here. Anyway, if you feel like drinking a light beer, drink liqour. But if you want a good light AAL, this is not a good one. I would recommend Yuengling Light"

"O-The Silver Bullet is obviously meant not to offend anyone because it does not provide much in the way of flavor...which is sort of offensive. I'm not one to simply bash a beer just because it is BMC or a light macro lager, but even when this beer is compared against its rivals, e.g., Miller Lite, Bud Light, etc., it lacks any real character."

"BA says that reviews should have something constructive, but that's very difficult with this one. As I'm sure most of us on here are not generally fans of American mega brewery light ""beers"" (I have a hard time calling this beer), I think Coors light stands above them all as probably the worst mass produced brew from any major company. It is simply too watered down to be an enjoyable beer, and I will sadly admit that I think less of people when they order it."

"O: One of the world's greatest marketing feats was to convince men that light beers like this, which were originally conceived as diet beers, were the only beers a man should ever consider drinking. Now it's so entrenched in the masculine ideal that if you're not chugging a can of this and crushing it against your skull when you're through, you're a pussy. This is the swill I proudly drank straight through high school and right into my latter college days. It's meant to pander to the lowest common denominator, and it does just that. Its advantages are that it is ubiquitous, affordable, and lacking in any offensive character. Its drawbacks are that it really lacks any meaningful taste or character at all, it's low in alcohol and as drinkable as seltzer water. What's manly about that?"

"Poured from a can into a shaker pint, the beer is a very pale, golden yellow color with no head whatsoever. Aromas of toast and not much else. A little bit of tangy, but really stretching to find even that. Flavors are toasted forward, with a butter and grainy character throughout, and literally nothing more. Very watery body, with a crispness from the extremely high amount of carbonation throughout the body. Very sharp, overly crisp finish, with a grainy aftertaste. Jesus, I don't know how I drank so much of this in college."

"I love craft beer more than the next guy. More. I'm from the Portland metro area. I am blessed with countless microbreweries from Seattle to PDX. However, I love coors light. It's amazing. How could you down on such a smooth beer. Love is all I have for it."

"Conclusion - what I'm really trying to say - Coors light is good when you just finished doing some work - especially on a warm day. According to the can it has 107 calories and 3.7% alcohol - something else that may appeal to you. While there may be sometimes I reach for an Old Rasputin or Dogfish Head 90.. Coors light also has it's place."

"I was in Golden so of course I had to go! Well, its been a while since I had a coors light, I remember a soapy taste. Well, this time it was very watery. It didn't taste like much and there was no aroma. The overall what no so good but I knew what I was getting myself into."

"It tastes like urine and smells horrible, the aftertaste makes me want to gag."

"I like the bottles. They have fun blue stuff on them to play with. Not sure how always being cold makes it any better since it sits in grocery store backrooms where it is not cold.

"Poured from draft into a plastic cup at a local music club. Pale straw in appearance with a soapy head that dissapates quickly but still maintains a small layer of bubbles on the surface of the cup. Aroma is tangy, metallic, lightly sweet vegetable, lightly grainy. No discernible aroma of hops whatsoever. Flavor follows nose with a tangy, sour metallic flavor dominating; hard to pinpoint any real descriptive flavors or anything that is close to cereal grains or hops. Mouthfeel is very thin but thicker than water, and the carbonation is lighter than it's canned counterpart. Not sure if this is a good example of a light American lager or not. It is a different drink entirely than what i would consider a ""real beer", but I'm trying to be as unbiased as possible. It's certainly quaffable as a thirst quenching alcoholic beverage, but the enjoyment that comes from drinking an ale or lager made with flavor and craftsmanship cannot be obtained by consuming a Coors light. Zero complexity and negligible flavor."

"Big companies don’t win by making great products. Big companies win by sucking less than other big companies. True, there's worse out there, but this is still an awful lager. If I can't enjoy Coors Light in a tiny, stuffy, non-air-conditioned second-floor bedroom in the midst of a mid-summer heatwave after moving heavy furniture... then there's no chance I ever will."

"Claiming to be a slight step up from the other famous macro beers, this really just doesn't impress at all. It's way too watery, and the flavor profile is limited to corn and just a touch of hops and malt, mostly from adjuncts. Yes, this will go down fast (if you can stand the smell and taste), but in the end it's just another very light beer. Good for frat parties but bad for those who are looking for a quality brew. Spend another two bucks per six pack and you can treat yourself to a decent beer."

"My favorite light beer/cheap beer. Great for bbq's and long days of drinking binges. Also good for drinking games. I definitely prefer Coors to Bud. Also, in my opinion, the best 30 pack you can buy.. i.e. Rolling Rock, Miller, Bud, Natty, Keystone, etc. Well priced and always reliable: the World's Most Refreshing Beer (The Silver Bullet)! Good for wizard staffing too because the cans are generally taller/thinner then the average can, so you can become a wise wizard faster! (stack cans until it's as tall as you, and you have become the wise wizard)."

"I'm gonna rate this beer as light beer the way it should be. If you rate this beer against other types or styles of beers your in idiot. As light beer compared to the other two its very very light with a watery look, very pale even more then bud and miller. The head foams and goes away like most light beers with no to little head left. The smell is a little sweetness, corn or some mix of veggies. The taste is a little sweet up front with the corn and veggie mix coming through midway, ending in a little bitterness maybe from the hops haha. Bud light and miller are sweeter, this is a little more tame on the sweetness and has a little bitter bite on the back end that makes me like it better then b/m. The mouthfeel along with the taste are water of course right, it is light beer. I mean this beer is still beer enough for me to enjoy it at a party, bbq, beach. I don't care how much people hate this shit or say its not craft beer I can't drink it, ill drink this any day on a beach or just simply throwing back cans with friends. Other then that though ill take some good beer to enjoy around the house hanging with the girl"
"Strictly a ""I made some bad life choices and now Im broke as shit"" beer. If this is your beer of choice then you either need to hang out with people who drink good beer or just quit drinking all together. If your over the age of concent there is no valid excuse for this beer being in your refrigerator."
"Really a thirst quencher, given its body is too light. But it has no off-flavors as most adjunct lagers. I would like to see a premium version of this, more malty and quadruplicating its hops with the same yeast."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Of the light lagers this one is probably my prefered. Super clean and crisp but drink it cold in the bottle."
""
""
""
"ice cold on a hot day, maybe"
""
""
""
"My overall impression of this beer is this, it is a beer brewed to serve a purpose and I think that it does exactly what it was intended to do. It's not a beer for complex analysis, you won't be drinking this wondering what those hops were or what the malt used was. But it is refreshing and when served cold as recommended it can hit the spot if it's what you were after. It's simple and not offensive, and sometimes that's good enough. Although there are many beers I would consider better I can't say that there's anything inherently wrong with this one."

"Has been my ""Go-To"" domestic beer for quite a few years. As long as the mountains are blue this beer will quench your thirst better than any of the other Macrobrew light options. Also, when Sam Eliot does the voiceover for you commercials you can't go wrong."
""
"Pretty much the worst beer ever. I used to be into bottom shelf adjunct lagers and such, but now I can really appreciate the taste of a real beer. On a hot day, after an honest day's work, I'd rather drink anything else but this. It will slow down your tastebuds to the point of cardiac arrest. Great from the beach (because it tastes like a mouthful of sand and salt water) to the slopes (because after having one, your day just goes downhill). Just thinking about it makes me vomit."

""
""
"For what it is, it is refreshing, light, and without any negative attributes. I just would not say that it has any stand out ones either. Very light in color, nominal aroma, water/corn-esque flavor, and does not linger long on the pallet. But those mountains sure were blue!"

"Taste/feel: Maybe it's because the beer was almost frozen, but this actually was not as awful as I was expecting ... I actually prefer a Coors Light/Miller Lite/Bud Light to their big brothers, as I'd like to taste my adjunct lagers as little as possible. A touch of corn, slightly sweet, pretty high carbonation, watery feel... goes down easy. It doesn't exactly taste like beer, but I'd rather have this than something that DOES tastes like beer, but reeks of piss soaked boots. Actually hit the spot after turning into a sweaty mess... I like it slightly more than Bud Light, and Miller Lite as well."

Coors Light is not one of them. Hold your horses though, this isn't high praise. Coors Light tastes like absolutely nothing. Smells like nothing. It's light yellow, but tastes like carbonated water. There is absolutely nothing to it. How do I rate something like this? It's refreshing yes, but it's hard to call this beer."

"O: The beer is very easy to drink - it is quite similar to a club soda or seltzer water (and has about as much smell/taste).

"The appearance is awful. Almost hazy and zero head. Yes. Zero head. Zero lacing. Zero everything. Smells like something disgusting. Tastes awful.

Overall this is an AWFUL beer. You won't see a person who values their calories or their beer drinking this junk."

"I thoroughly enjoy this beer. In fact, on the weekends this is among my top 3 choices. Its a very flavorful beer that although may be very overpowering for some enthusiasts because its not a very grainy flavor, it is very enjoyable to drink as a 'fun' beer. The silver bullet can is well done as well. The can is tall and thin which makes it nice to hold and the silver with the mountains gives it a cool and chilled look."

"ive drank 500 gallons, will drink 500 gallons more. this is a beer to cut your teeth on, to be a teenager with, to be outdoors with, to drink and drink and drink on long summer days with no water and find a decent forgiveness in the morning. this is the beer of smokey and the bandit, smokey runnin coolers of coors across old man river mississippi so all we east least can get a taste of the Rockies. this is the beer of Golden Colorado, Shelby County Tennessee, the Shenandoah Valley in Virginia, and every raging prom party worth a bucket of spit and a Kid Rock song. I drink it when the mountains turn BLUE."

""
""
""
""
""

"O: Honestly, if it wasn't for the mouth-kicking aftertaste, it would be a fine beer. Maybe the problem is that I poured it into a glass and opened the favors... In any case, like any other beer, I'll drink them as long as they're free and there's nothing equally free available."

"I know I've had this over the years a couple times and I'm surprised I never reviewed it before... it must have fell through the cracks somehow. This beer poured out as a clear yellow color with a very fast fading white head on top. The beer has some carbonation bubbles that rise to the top on occasion. The smell of the beer is mostly aromas of corn and other sweet grains. The taste is very bland, I'd say it lacks everything in the flavor/taste category. The mouthfeel is watery, thin and boring. Overall it's nothing to be proud of, it's got no depth or anything. Avoid it, because there is nothing good about it."

"Overall: I hate to bag on a beer but I've never enjoyed this brew. There are better low-priced beers out there. You are never going to get the true flavor of a plain lager through a light beer but Coors just watered this one down way too much."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Was it good, no. Made me wanna crack open a Sam Adams. But at the same time it didn't quite taste as bad I as was expecting. Maybe I'm giving it some leeway because it was free.If you're short on cash and wanna get trashed and throw a party, or if you'd had several better beers and then want something cheap at the bar before you call it a night, then this is probably the beer for you."

"I don't understand why Coors is so intent on advertising the coldness of their beer - that is up to the consumer to store it in the fridge or ice chest right? Nevertheless, this beer can only be palated cold. I can't imagine drinking it at room temperature. The piss taste would surely come through with strength."
""
""
"Overall - it's coors light. It's not even one of the better light beers"

"O: Skip this beer if you still have the luxury of doing so. Although it is a good option if your choice consists of only light beers."
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall – Not really a great light beer in my opinion. Its mouthfeel is good for the style, but the flavors are a bit weak, even for a light beer, and with the papery taste bringing down any refreshing character of the brew."

"It's almost nothing, but at least it doesn't have an offensive taste or smell."

""

""
""
""

"OVERALL: This is not a disgusting beer by any means. Nor is it a good beer. The way I see it is 'what's the point?' I mean I CAN drink this, but what good is it doing me? I suppose if I simply wanted to get drunk this would be fine, but A). I don't and B). If I did I could do it cheaper, more efficiently and more enjoyably by simply buying some big craft brews. So yeah, I try not to waste my allotment of booze for the week on things like this."
"O: My favorite light beer. In my opinion, it is a bit expensive for its quality, but is not a bad buy."

"you know what? this is by far the best beer in the BMC lineup, at least as far as the lights go. really, theres nothing metallic or putrid about it, maybe just better on tap, who knows, but after all my awesome beers lately, i thought it was time to review something less impressive. had this on tap at santoros at the ice rance in littleton after a hockey game. pours clear yellow color, a hint of gold, but more yellow. a surprisingly nice white head on it, but its gone in seconds. the nose is lightly toasted barley, a little nutty tone, and generic yeast. it doesnt smell as adjunctty as many of these, and really has a pretty decent flavor all things considered. its light as hell obviously, but it also isn refreshing. in its category its probably 3.5s or 4s across the board. mouthfeel is okay, too light to be really satisfying, but well carbonated and easy drinking. a few pitchers of this down the gullet would be no worries. hard to get a buzz tough, and that hurts it for me. overall an underrated shitty beer, if that makes any sense. this smokes a miller light, and absolutely pulverizes a budlight. and its local, sort of..."
""
""
"what a horrible beer if you could even call it that. color is a yellow urine color, head doesnt last after pouring but a few seconds, the smell is something between sugar and cat piss, and the taste is like beer flavored water. all in all, i give it a 1 on the scoring because they dont give you a choice of 0, i wouldnt reccomend this beer to anyone."

"This is one of the go to beers everyone must try. I personally like the flavor and it is very refreshing on hot summer days. Many people do not enjoy it because it is very watered down. It makes for a refreshing drink with good carbonation and plenty of hops. The after taste it leaves is quite pleseant, plus they are cheap."

"Ok, to be honest this ""beer"" is a beer you drink along with several others. Piss to get you pissed. But at 4.2% that's a lot of piss to pour down your throat. I don't drink light beer. I prefer the full flavor. But this is the only light beer I deal with. Curing a headache with one as I type this. There's not much taste. Weak malt, hops, and water. Easy drinking. But mightily refreshing because of the sharp, crisp carbonation. Maybe I'm ok with this beer because I have good memories of crushing countless cans of Coors out by a particular pool over a period of a few days this summer. It grew on me. A little below law mower brew."

"This 4% beer is pretty good, but it doesn't tste much. There is only a little aftertaste of corn and it has s clear straw color. The mouthfeel is similar to water which is average for a macro lager. The bottles and cans are nice tough with the cold certified kind of thing. It is of course a good summer beer you can find everywhere and at a pretty good price. Afterall it is only alcoholic water with a touch of corn."

"Pale straw color with a fizzly, nearly nonexistent head. Aroma: none. Taste: barely any. Mouth feel: pure carbon dioxide. I don't really think a beer can be much more vapid than this one. At least they have cool marketing schemes, like the mountains that turn blue, or the wide mouth can opening so you can pour this swill down your gullet even faster, right? ....RIGHT? There's no reason to ever buy this stuff (that can be said about a lot of beers, though), simple as that."

"Coors Light is definitely one of the better widely available American Lagers. Appearance is a straw yellow with nothing else to it, And the smell is that of an average lager. But the taste is a nice change from the normal, It's almost like they actually take their time making this stuff. Yes I said it, An American Lager that actually has some time put into it! Imagine that!. I don't get why it has such a bad rep on here. The mouthfeel is nice as well with the usual lager fizziness. And I was surprised at the low alcohol content since I was actually buzzing off of 4 bottles of the stuff. So the next time you're about to pick up that 6 pack of Bud Light or any other basic cheap lager, Grab this instead."

"Piss. So bland it might as well be water. There's nothing technically wrong with this, but it's still one of the worst beers I've ever reviewed. So lacking in character that it sullies the very concept of beer. Vile - save money, drink H2O!"
"O - I don’t have anything against adjunct lagers. They have a time and place. However, this one just doesn’t do it for me. There’s almost nothing here to even review. It’s like water in every category - even the color. One thing that saves it from being a straight 1 is that it’s so much like water that it’s completely inoffensive. There’s nothing “bad” here, but that’s just because there’s nothing here at all."

"I am trying to save some of these ""home draft"" systems for homebrew, so I bought one Miller lite, one Coors light. Drank the Miller first, then the Coors. The Coors was probably some of the worst beers i've ever had! I grading this to style also. It is a mess, all I could taste in this beer was fruity esters, and yeast. Not that beer is sweet, just fruity, I can't describe how nasty it is. I'd rather have Old english!"

"It pours a thin golden yellow crayon color, with hardly any discernible aroma and a flavor reminiscent of a cheap corn mash bourbon, i.e. just plain, and just plain nasty. The selling point is that their new 16 oz. aluminum bottles shows you “when the beer is hot the mountains are white, and when it’s cold they turn blue.” (Or maybe it was vice versa?) If their main selling point is their advertising then who cares about the taste, right?"

"Pours straw yellow color with a small white color head that evaporates rather quickly. Overly carbonated. Not any lacing on the glass. Nose is sweet corn and a bit of skunk.

""
"Not much of an appearance with about a 1"" head that quickly disappears. Smells like watered down...water beer. Taste like a normal american pilsner which lacks much flavor or imagination. Really crisp and tastes pretty much how it smells and looks. Let's face it, this is a drinking game beer so leave it for the tailgates or beer pong. Unless of course it's free, then the ""free beer"" rule applies. Of the big 3 BMC products, this is my least favorite."

"Piss yellow, small head with no retention. Burnt corn in the nose. Watery taste with light cracker sweetness, light bitterness, almost no hop flavor. Ligh mouth. 6 down the hatch and nary much of a buzz and my team got their ass handed to them. Buzz kill."

"I grew up on this beer. It is my favorite of all the Lights. Of course, most people want to trash any of the light beers, but as a Yooper, they all hold a special meaning. There aren't any special characteristics other than it's a GOOD beer. Whether you're ice-fishing, playing bar-league softball, golfing, or grilling out...it always refreshes and produces!"

"This has always been a favorite beer for me to drink at parties BBQs and other small get togethers. I know a lot of people don't like this beer bc they want a richer tasting beer but I've been drinking this beer a long time and it will always be among my favorites."

"O- Typical Macro light beer. Basically flavorless belly wash that tastes worse (more sweet metallic malt) as it warms. This must be why the promote consuming this beer as cold as possible. Maybe their aim is to numb your tung long enough until you are drunk enough not to care."

"Not a great beer, not even a great adjunct, but in my opinion it's probably slightly the better of the big 3 light beers.

"Served this Light Lager in a pint glass, on tap. Poured a clear, straw color, very thin white head, poor retention. The aroma of this lager has some hints of grain.

So much for the ""Silver Bullet"" Prost!"

"Hey what can I say, this is a good beer for summer when it is hot and the beer is cold. When I am hot an thirsty I want something I can drink alot of and not feel full. This is that kind of beer.

"Of all the macros out there this is one of the better ones. It's smooth and crisp and doesn't have any of the metallic off flavors that you often find in this style."

"O-This is the absolute worst tasting light beer I've ever had. Even when I used to only drink light beers this tasted awful. I can't get over how the water tastes dirty, yet they claim to use spring water? Tastes like tap to me, not even. I'll drink it during a night of sessioning but I'd make sure I was well prepared so I didn't have to."
"If ever I partake, it's when I'm irresponsibly binge drinking in the heat where my beer needs to be as close to water as possible. But, even then I'll usually go with some PBR or Tecate."

"O: I really don't see the purpose of this beer. It has no personality at all. This is an utterly soulless, tasteless waste of time. In the end, this is easily one of the worst beers I've ever had."

"O: One of the worst beers on the market, and mystifyingly one of the most popular beers out there. There is simply no excuse to buy this beer unless your a high school or college kid who needs some beer for quaters or beer pong. No self respecting beer lover should be caught dead purchasing this swill"

"O: For as watery as it is, this beer is NOT easy to throw back...its not refreshing, much less good."
"D - Yes, it is drinkable, but there are certainly better choices, even in the cheap American adjunct beer category. Hell, at least drink original Coors."
"It is better than bud light but that isn't saying much. There are better light beer options out there."
"Overall, a beer for the birds. Nice if all you want is to pee and get wasted."
"O: very bland beer, even for the style."
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability - Easily drinkable and okay for when you don't care what you're drinking. But for now, I think I'll go back to real beer."
"O- For what beers this is compared too this is amazing! But to compare this to other beers isn't fair as it sucks in that regard. That being said, I'm going to compare this to Bud and Miller and give it a thumbs up"
"As with most light lagers, Coors Light is very pale yellow in color with sharp clarity. The nose is pretty weak and corn seems to be the dominate component. There is, however, a faint floral scent as well. Taste is predictably sweet and very mild. Body is super light and thin. True to style, this is drinkable but not very enjoyable."
"It smells like sour grain. It doesn't really have too much flavor other than grain, stale corn chips. It has a light body and goes down fairly easy which I guess is average for the style. Overall it's just a cheap beer meant for mass consumption by others, not me."
"Oh my this is not good! I just tried this right after a Bud light and found it to be even less drinkable. No real smell to speak of, but taste...hint of banana, slight lemon after taste...hops???, I can't detect them. This is a really bad brew(no where on the can does it say beer)."
"D: drank from a COLD, SUPER COLD can. both were blue, however i did leave the can out for over 20 minutes hoping to warm it up. the mountains were still blue. whatever. in conclusion, you know what you are getting with this beer. a low abv, low flavored american light lager. anyone on this website knows better. pass."
"Drank a lot of this in high school, glad I don't drink it that often anymore."
"This beer is good when you can't afford the good stuff. $5 for a 3 pack of tall cans, HELL YA! This beer is not for sipping and enjoying like craft beers, its for huge gatherings and when money is tight and you need a quick beer fix. Not bad for piss beer!"
"Overall, I sometimes don't finish the can I'm drinking. I'm a beer finisher."
"O - Overall this beer is only meant to be drank in large social gatherings when there are drinking games involved."
"Overall: Not as bad as I was expecting. sweet and fairly drinkable."
"I know why people drink this: it goes down so easily and its a decent party beer. Besides that...no redeeming qualities to be had."
"Not my first choice when it comes to drinking a ton and getting drunk, but if it's cheaper than Busch, Bud, or Natty, why not."
"Overall – There beer does have a certain distinct taste that sets it apart from the other light adjunct beers on the market. Not saying that's a good thing.. Anyways, its very light and highly drinkable, but I'll stick with Genny Light as my go to choice in this style category - for camping trips etc."
"Overall: Terrible, leaves you feeling bloated and sick."
"taste and looks like water.... no aroma... no head... i hear its very hard to make though and they get it the same every time... i guess that is one positive... oh and they do have good commercials!!!"
"poured from bottle, to give it an honest try. Very pale in color which is backed up by the very pale taste. Poures a nice 1 inch head, not much lacing, and the head disappears quickly. Not much to review, very little color, very little fragrance, very little taste. The positive is that it doesn taste vile, like Miller Lite or Budweiser does. The worst thing I can say is that its always in the fridge, damn wife."
"Pours a pale yellow color w/ a thin off white head. Little or no head, and very weak lacing. Very clear and easy to see through. Smell is very one dimensional- some grain, grass, and weak malt. That's about all I get. Taste is even more one dimensional and weak. Some grass and malt is about it for that category. Feel is very carbonated and extremely light. Very easy to drink, which seems to be the point of this beer. This beer should only be drunk if you hate drinking beer, because it really doesn't have any of the good qualities that I love in a good brew. Not recommended."
"O- Absolutely one of the worst beers out there"
"This is slightly better than Keystone Light, but that isn't saying much. Overall, Coors Light is slightly sweeter and slightly less grainy than Keystone. But it's slightly more expensive. Regardless, I probably won't be drinking either of these again."
"even the whole mountains are blue this is kinda sketchy to me. did they design this for people with no feelings in their hands?"
"I am a long time fan of Coors. It was the featured beer at my wedding reception in 1979."
"D - There's worse beers, but there's also much, much better ones. No reason to drink this unless you have to."
"O: A beer only for sessioning at immense amounts."
"To me, this represents everything that is wrong with mass-produced American beer. You CAN have a flavorful light beer, just try an Amstel."
"The beer is extremely light yellow and completely transparent. The head is dense and pure white, measuring an inch and a half. The aroma is weak, offering virtually nothing. The flavor is plain and simple, and surprisingly unoffensive. Bland? Yes. Awesome? Certainly not. Grain and sweetness. Thin bodied and poundable. It is what it is. Certainly not the worst of the macro light lagers."
"i could think of several cheap, light lagers that are much better than this. for that reason, i do not approve of purchasing this beer unless there is no other (better) choice."
"O: If this is the only option at a BBQ, I will be the DD."
"O: I'm trying to be unbiased here. The beer was mostly plain and uninteresting, but there was nothing bad about it. It is affordable, which is a plus."
"Stupid gimmick for coldness level....how about working on the quality of the product instead."
"O/D - I have to admit to having a few of these after soccer games once and a while. It has flavour, but the watery body isn't the greatest. Just another typical, corny macro produced lager."
"Coors Light pours a translucent straw color, lighter than the average AAL, and has very little semblance of a head, its more of a fizzy soda-like body. The vented can deal is one of the few gimmicks I've seen that really make a difference; it allows for an exceptionally smooth pour, with zero glugging. As to the beer itself, it is a very mild brew with scant aroma or flavor. What is to be found in this brew is a clean, crisp mineral note, a sweet floral hint and very light grain nuances. The feel is like sparkling water, which is not unusual for the style. Overall, this is a reasonably inoffensive brew as long as it is cold. The one thing I am noticing here is that the brew seems to degrade in quality the closer it gets to room temp."
"I was once a poor college student and found this to be the best choice for the money I had. One of the ""top"" cheap beers."
"O) I cannot bring myself to call this beer a failure, because I knew what I was getting into. I like water, and I don't find this brew anymore offensive than most other macro lights. If anything, we can all thank the Silver Bullet for getting people all over the world to join hands and start a love train."
"O: Disappointing simple yellow fizzy beer. No complexity. Reviewed it because I had some left over after my wife used almost half for a Beer Can chicken on the grill. It turns out that is the best use for it--up a chicken's backside to moisten the meat."
"O- This is just another typical light beer. I guess it would be good on a hot day and there is no water around."
"I drank this wehn both the cold and super cold bars were activated on the can, which i think was the right move. If this bad boys warms up too much, im sure it gets really bad"
"Drinkability- This beer is horrible. Avoid it at all costs."
"Avoid this beer..."
"Drinkability: It is in no way offensive, but I do find it insulting."
"Pours a crystal clear light, almost clear, yellow with a 1 inch fizzy white head that fades to nothing. No lacing at all. Smell is of grains and corn flakes. Taste is the same with the grains and corn flakes. There is a slightly metallic taste present as well. A high level of carbonation makes for a very crisp and clean mouthfeel. Overall, this is a below average but quite drinkable beer. Not too bad for what it is."
"Aaaaahhhh Another lawn mowing hot summer day beer. Its nearly impossible to decifer between all the standard american adjuct beers. I have alway enjoyed coors light, but certainly is not the best beer in the world....no kidding. The color is yellow and clear with good carbonation that results in a white foam head that dissapates quickly. Smell and taste are primarily grain with attempted balnace of hops, etc. The beer is easy drinking and light."
"As I approach the end of the glass, I just want to be done with it and move onto something more interesting. Drinkable? Barely, but if having one is such a chore for me, why would I ever want a second?"
"This should be sent to third world countries with water-shortages...This stuff is like tap-water in a can. No flavor, no finish, tis not a real beer. Yet I have friends who swear by it!!"
"O: Well, there's a reason the marketing focuses on the bottle and not the contents. This beer aspires to mediocrity, but still falls short. That being said, I've had worse, but not by much. If you want a light beer, stick with Sam Adams, it actually has flavor."
"O - One of my favorite macros, but it's still a macro. The flavors are not bad but there just isn't much there. It is very refreshing though."
"From 12 fl. oz can no. SEP2611-L30020722. Sampled on July 23, 2011. The pour is straw yellow with a huge fizzy head that diminishes as quickly as it built up. Aromas of grains, weak malts, and creamed corn with a vague hoppy crispiness. The body is thin but stays together well when swirling. The taste has a slighly bigger hoppy bite than its aroma but nothing special but it is also kind of stale. It is proper for its style but defintely not a craft brew lover's beer. But it was 98 degrees today...so that says it all."
"O: Hard to say which of the big three light lagers I prefer, if any over the other. They aren't beers I buy from a store, only when given to me at functions or stadiums, as was the case here."
"o - Overall not a very good beer, but not the worst out there. Very bland and waterlike. I prefer Bud Light of the light beers, but this is better than Miller Lite."
"I think that's enough for a review now, even if your new to beer your know what your getting into, I'm just trying to submit a fair review based in its style. Other wise not blown away - however I wouldn't hesitate to throw one of these back eyes cold whislt dripping in sweat."
"M: Watery and light, the lager doesn't bring anything to the table. One's good enough for me."
"But, the texture of beer was like water. Which, was perfect for a light lager."
"it's a bad beer. Avoid at all costs."
"This review is, as recommended as a BA, conducted UNDERSTANDING the STYLE. For the basic American Adjunct Lager, it's passable. Pours a light yellow color, with small to no head (depending on pour) and little lacing. Smell is unremarkable, as is taste, but it is a cool refreshing AMERICAN ADJUNCT LAGER, and if one can accept it for what it is, then good. This is a decent cheap beer to enjoy when at a ballpark, out at a BBQ or picnic or family gathering where beer snobbery/""more educated palates"" do not prevail. If you want a good cheap beer to pound down when the weather is hot, or the action is going....this one will do. Nothing fantastic, but passable..."
"With the harrowing Bud Chelada experience still fresh in my mind (I hadn't had a beer since) and my body ready for sleep, I stumbled upon a bar with a soothing outdoor patio, and decided to sit and rest for a spell. This beer seemed like the best option on tap, and figuring it had to be better than the Chelada, I ordered a pint. Light yellow in color, fizzy, with a sparkling white head. I took the beer outside, sat down and drank deeply, tasting glorious nothingness...no tomato, no pickle, no coors. Just refreshing sparkling nothingness. The beer recalibrate my palate, enabling me to resume drinking in earnest the following day. Thank you, Coors."
"On par with its contemporaries and can be refreshing when ice cold. Gets worse as it warms."
"O - I believe the combination of mass brewing with low flavor ingredients like rice (to replace barley) and poorly cultured yeasts yield a massively inferior beer. This is truly the bottom rung of beer. I will make one distinction though: this beer improves a bit when it is very cold. If it becomes room temperature it is quite bad."
"I did not want this beer. It was thrust into my hand after a sporting event. Cant declare on the color as it was in a can. Limited scent, albeit was not enticing. Taste, well it was ice cold, that benefited myself and this review a bit. Mouthfeel wasn't the worst I have had, but like i said, it was ice cold, and I know that because the can told me so. overall, given the perfect conditions, this beer would still be bad, but tolerable."
"I'm not going into a lengthy review, because it's been done so many times already. I would like to point out that their are good reasons this beer exists. For example, a hot day at the beach, I love my craft beers, but lets say i had a stout instead my day would be done. Also Coors Light is my favorite Beer Pong beer, always seem to do better with it! That's my reasoning..."
"O - If I'm at a sporting event and this is the only beer available, OK, I'll drink one. Otherwise I'll pass."
"D- I could drink (and, admittedly, have drunk) this beer all day. With a consistency roughly that of tap water (not that fancy bottled water with the minerals and such in it), you really don't have to slow down. Good as a palate cleanser between tastings of real beer or for watering your lawn during a drought."
"By far the worst beer I have tried. My own sister who doesn't drink much beer, warned me not to try it. No taste, almost like club soda + alcohol. Lacking any real flavor, and looks very plain. I honestly can say that the smell is almost non-existent also. I will definitely pass next time I go somewhere, and there's only coors light. I don't even consider it beer."
"The taste is weak as well, very watery, but slight grain and corn flavors. I guess that is how it is supposed to be for this beer style. On a very hot day, this will be a good thirst quencher."
"Again, a beer to waste on beer pong. It doesn't really taste that great and I'd rather drink something else. It's a fairly clean beer, goes down easy, but the taste is just poor. I'd probably wait for a few friends to finish this off after a party (for some reason a few of the guys like this). At the end of the day, the silver bullet misses on this one."
"Is this a world beater? Not by any means. Is it the worst thing ever marketed as beer? Not by a long shot. In fact, I've had many that were much, much worse, in styles that are much more akin to what Beer Advocates are prone to drink. Shooting for mediocrity and hitting the bullseye still means you end up with a better beer (and better review score) than shooting for greatness and falling completely on your face. You get no bonus points for what you *meant* your beer to taste like. While it's popular to bash on macros here, this is a well made example of a style that is wildly popular among the beer drinkers of the country. Not great, not horrible. And let's face it, if you really need to read a review to get an idea what Coors Light tastes like, you should probably get out more."
"D: Made for the masses not the Beer Advocates."
"Overall - Not a very good beer. If you are drinking to get intoxicated cheaply and do not want to totally hate the experience, probably a good beer. Would prefer Yuengling for the latter task, but I might be biased being from Tampa and all (Yuengling distillery in Tampa)."
"o-refreshing, but nothing else."
"O: this is an american adjunct lager; I wouldn't buy it, ever, but I wouldn't turn it down at a party."
"poured out of a can. its pale yellow, and fizzy. no real smell just slightly grainy. tastes kind of like something. maybe corn, but honestly there is very little taste there. pretty much feels like drinking carbonated water. drink if there is nothing else."
"That being said, if you are to have a get-together of sorts as I mentioned earlier, then it isn't a bad choice. It's relatively inexpensive and most anyone will drink it. So if you have a lot of people coming over and some aren't really ""beer drinkers"" or some are women who want fruity drinks and you refuse to allow that nonsense around your house, then go for some Coors Light."
"This is unfortunately what some friends and family think is beer, and whats more they serve it to company. Is it bad manors to bring your own whenever you visit. Coors has no flavor, its aroma is unimpressive as is its appearance. How anyone can drink this is beyond me. Give me an arrogant bastard any day now that's a real beer."
"overall: why am i doing this to myself?"
"Thanks, but no thanks."
"Overall, I give it a full mug. It's the only light beer I buy with my own money."
"As other people have noted, this is a good beer for people who do not like the taste of beer. In other words, it's a drinkable light lager, but even within the style there are many, uh, less bad examples."
"Pours a fizzy yellow hue, straw colored and very light bodied. Highly carbonated. Smell is sweet malt and corn syrup. No hops, no alcohol. Taste is very much the same as the smell. Mouthfeel is light bodied. Over all, not something i would ever by. Tried this at a camping trip with friends."
"O: A very light and thin beer, with just an alright taste. This beer is probably mid-pack in the Light Lager category"
"So as I said I am not a big fan of this style but I am trying to increase my knowledge of the different styles. I feel this beer is a middle of the road light lager."
"Poured from can into a pint glass. The can indicated the beer was only ""Cold", not ""Super Cold"". Pours a very clear light yellow with a head that was white and gone in a hurry. The scent was barely anything. There was a faint grain scent but that's all I got. The taste was faintly of corn and grains and after drinking many craft beers, you hardly notice anything that sticks out. The mouthfeel was very carbonated and light. Overall, this isn't a beer for someone looking for a lot of flavor or fullness, just a little alcohol."
"O: A typical mast produced lager without my thought or flavor put into. I can’t believe I would drink this stuff in college, but it was cheap and available."
"Overall I hope I rarely, if never have to have Coors Light again. Coors original/banquet is actually pretty good but this Light beer is just awful. If you want a light beer, stick with something else and stay away from this."
"O-Good for very hot summer days when you are not doing anything strenuous. If you were to offer me one, I'll take it. Just as long as it's not accompanying food."
"Overall - As far as the mass produced American beers go, this sits with the rest of them. Nothing spectacular and other than the fact that it goes down like, well, water...it leaves EVERYTHING to be desired."
"Overall - nothing surprising about this one. It looks like a light lager, it tastes like one too."
"but for those budget 30 pack fans, here's your golden calf!"
"T: Yeah, this isn't good. There's a bit of a sweetness to it and a faint hint of grassy hops, but everything tastes way watered down. Drinking this warm is a feat. Best not to let it get to that point. Pound it while it's cold. Or better yet, stay away altogether."
"I don't really think this beer serves any purpose other than freezing your tongue off. It some time has hints of banana which is on and off sometimes. I think this beer is way better than a busch though. Still, this beer is just for lame parties. They should stop bragging about how cold their beer is and maybe work on some of the flavor or smoothness."
"Buy lots and get girls drunk...thus the relatively high rating. Pours light straw, almost colorless, thin, and fizzy. Aroma of stale nothingness. Tastes of...what comes out of a cow after spending too much time drinking from a puddle. :D Light, watery, mouthfeel, and although it goes down like water, it leaves a deathly aftertaste and is to be avoided at all costs. Other than [see first sentence]."
"Well the first thing I notice with this beer when I pour it is that I can hear the head fizzing away, like soda, the bubbles are small so the head looks nice, but I can tell it will be gone in seconds; in fact, in the time it's taken me to write this, a two finger head is now gone...terrible. Other than that, it looks like water, with yellow color in it, completely see through. For the smell, well it smells sour, maybe a little malt, no hops on the nose at all, just generic bad beer smell. I think I might even smell water, which is amazing. As for taste, it's Coors, so it's not the worst adjunct lager I've ever had, in fact it's one of the better ones. With that being said, it's still a crappy crappy adjunct lager, almost no taste, all I get it water, carbonation and a little malt, and then some adjuncty-coors taste. It doesn't taste god awful like some beers do, but it's still not a good beer. Mouthfeel is horrible. Drinkability is ok just because it doesn't taste gross and it's really light. Overall, below average beer, but on the better side of the adjunct lager beers."
"Aroma is different from water but the body not by much. Taste is also slightly different from water. At least the brew is not disgusting. I can drink it when I am very thirsty."
"M- Sort of of setting after taste, but this is a party beer and i could drink a lot of it."
"(120th)"
"Overall: A leader among light, US lagers and the official beer of my Uncle Jimmy; a craft enthusiast will not enjoy this as much"
"O - Oh how I remember the days. While the silver bullet is pound-able the taste leaves A LOT to be desired. Just not good at all."
"All in all, if I were in the deep South, standing next to my broken down vehicle on a hot and humid July day, a cooler full of these would be a real welcome sight and would seem downright apropos. Just make sure those danged mountains are blue."
"and it honestly doesn't really smell like anything unless you spill it on a hot sunny day."
"Not impressed, Id have to be either super thirsty, or out of beer, and water to have the other one in my fridge"
"Drink- I shouldn't have bitten the bullet. It was just flavorless. No real reason to have one of these other than to say you are drinking a beer. No fullness on the drink, no real flavor."
"D: It's low ABV and high water-content allows you to slug back a whole lot of these in one evening... but the lack of flavor, in any form, means that I only choose to when the temperature rises above 90. This beer has it's place in my fridge... that place is waaay in the back, available for consumption after mowing the lawn, and a cheap option to provide for guests who would honestly prefer this over an IPA or a Stout anyway. For those reasons, and those reasons alone, it isn't a complete and utter failure."
"overall - i enjoy this beer, find it easy to drink and a refreshing taste. i dont however think this is a beer beer, its a easy drink."
"Drinkability: Easy to drink more than one of, if only because theres little flavor, bubbly slightly sweet."
"Drinkability: I'm finding it hard to finish this beer. This is a little sad."
" The taste while very bland has no obvious flaws so it is ok for what it is -and it is crisp with slight adjunct flavor giving a mild sweet effect and it finishes clean without any hop flavor or real malt to speak of. The drinkability is not great, I would not order this normally since it really lacks much in the way of 'beer' flavor, simply comes off as a fizzy soda-like malt beverage or a palate cleanser. I do think it fits within the style ok, but generally I would avoid this unless light lagers are your thing."
"Drinkability - Average. What else can I say? Saying this beer has bad drinkability is like saying water has bad drinkability."
"My final impression: What's the point in drinking this? It's a beer for people who don't like beer, but want something cheap with alcohol in it."
"Crystal clear and very pale yellow. It had a nice head after the initial pour but it drops to almost nothing after a minute or so. Looks weak. Very clean and somewhat fruity aroma. Smells weak. Tastes much like it smells. Imagine a pilsener had all traces of hops removed from it before having adult relations with a bucket of water. This beer would be the result of such a union."
"It's the typical lager gold color. The aroma has a bit of wheat and not much else. The taste, light wheat and corn, but not much of them. It goes down super easy and finishes clean. The body is typical for the style. For a light lager it's decent but for the typical beer geek there's plenty of brews out there that would be more satisfying. In short, it's light and thin, but clean."
"<<Pouring down drain now>>"
"A great beer, however beer snobs should avoid."
"D- In the summer, on a boat, on the lake, in 90 degree/98 percent humidity- drinkable"
"This is one of my favorite Its the most drinkable one out of all the American light beers. This beer tastes much better out of the tap than the bottle or can. The thing that stands out most is the great taste,and the thing that I dislike the most is there is no smell and the color is similar to water. Overall a very good beer and I recommend this beer on a hot day while watching a baseball game."
"Water please? This is such a watered down beer, flavorless. My wife drinks this and prefers it from the bottle. If I had to choose to drink this it would be from tap only. This would be the last choice of beers to drink. Besides schlitz lol. I dont want to seem like im ripping it apart but this is not a beer to sit down and drink over and over again."
"D - If I was still in college this would get a high rating on drinkability because it gets you drunk for cheap and its not very filling. However, I'm not anymore. I would never drink this beer."
"Drinkability: It's a smooth beer but it is way to watered down. Perfect if your just looking to get drunk but even there, it's gonna take you alot of these."
"Little body and very little hop bite. Zero aftertaste but I think that is the point."
"Bought it in a bottle and poured it into a pint glass. Old faithful is what a lot call it. Its my safety beer everyone drinks it nobody hates it except the NRA haha. It pours a very light yellow color. It smells alcoholic. Its the average persons beer. It goes down really smooth and is very drinkable. It leaves the palate of a person who has drank ""craft"" beers looking for more but is very refreshing after cutting the grass/ while cutting the grass. Easiest beer to drink."
"Pours a very very pale yellow color. It's actually even more pale than I thought it was. Bit of an alcohol smell to it. Pretty weak taste, not a lot of flavor. Not a bad taste, but it leaves a bit to be desired. Smooth drinking beer. This beer is probably best consumed in quantity."
"In a world of beer pong and tailgates where you'll drink a million beers over the course of 5 hours the Silver Bullet is the true King of Beers. It's never ending ability to provide small doses of alcohol in between good beers when you are getting piss yourself drunk is second to none. A little pricey for what you get, it should cost no more than natural ice but we are slaves to ad costs. Whether it is for a beer bong or a keg cup Coors light is the choice of Champions. Just don't think you are going to be savoring the last drops of this one."
"""the silver bullet"" good for 2 things, killin warewolves and pounding until you cant stand up. i like to take coors light tailgating because i can drink these things like water when im in a pinch for time. the taste is bland, not much flavor here so you dont mind it when it dribbles down you chin onto your shirt and then onto the ground. i have a late cousin that drank this religiously so ill crack one open in memory of him sometimes. all usefullness aside there's nothing special about coors light. i must say though when its ice cold i have been know to drink these like a bastard."
"had this in many different cities across this great land and its too bad this was my beer of choice when i was a young lad. Not at all what I would consider to be a choice for drinking now. I would much rather have water and wont even offer to my friends. I rated this high in drinkability because I think you can drink your own weight of this stuff."
"Pours a very clear pale yellow with a finger off white foamy head that disapears fast. Nose is also pale. Phenol, grain, yeast and grass. Taste is bland and mediorce. Water, grain, grassy and very light in flavour. Also light in mouthfeel, watery. Fair drinkabiliry in that they are easy to drown a couple at any time. I've had my share of these since it's my dads goto. My choice if I'm with him and there's no craft options. Otherwise don't waste your time."
"drinks poorly at best."
"Overall: This is the perfect beer for one of those all-day summer events like a beach party, BBQ,etc. Goes down smooth & easy, refreshes and quenches the thirst. The low ABV makes it so you can enjoy several while engaged in a fun outdoor summer activity with your buddies...also it's light & refreshing enough for people who are not real beer drinkers to enjoy...not a favorite of mine, but it does have it's place in the beer world!"
"Drinkability: Easy and like drinking carbonated water. I remembered drinking this beer when I got introduced to alcohol and remembering it was shit. Fast forward about nine years where I actually enjoy beer and this memory doesn't surprise me one bit when attempting to enjoy it now."
"Drink craft beers."
"RJT"
"Water anyone? Just another utterly weak nearly flavorless light beer. Kind of like if you pack a glass to the top with ice cubes then drop in a shot or two of regular Coors and walk away long enough for the ice to melt. Ta-da, Coors Light. The only saving grace is there's really nothing to be offended by. Something would have to be in it in order for you to ask for something to take out of it."
"D. not so bad of a beer to drink at a bowling alley to keep up with the boys but nothing to seek out otherwise"
" i always dog my friend for constanly drinking this (i think he likes the moutnains, easily amused dude ha). Not to wax philosophical here, but i tend to think beers like this are popular simply because they are drinkable. one can easily down this without getting full, and if one's intentions are purely to get drunk, i guess this makes sense. but once youve crossed over to the world of craft brew, this one must be left behind and utilized ONLY in the most desperate of situations."
"Not one of the best or even the decent. I advise staying away from Macro ""Light"" beers all together because of their lack of flavor and pizzaz but if you have to there are better choices."
"Drinkability: This would be bearable if I were cutting the grass on a hot summer afternoon and needed to quench my thirst...but water would work better."
"D - umm not the worst beer ever sold to the masses but when your selling points are blue mountains and not tasting unpleasant your not aiming high enough."
"I didn't really expect much from this one and have never been too impressed when I've had it hundreds of times before. After close inspection, I've come to the conclusion that this is one of the least offensive light lagers. It's still only half beer, but it plays its cards right and can be consumed like cold water in the most desolate desert."
"D - Well, if you're looking to drink a lot of beer quickly without enjoying it then this is the beer for you. It's cheap, easy to get a hold of, and the taste is so watered down that you can't help but keep drinking it hoping to find some sort of lost taste or at the very least something to commend Coors on doing well. But that's not the point of Coors Light, the point of it is to be easy to drink and light on taste, which Coors does exceptionally well. 2 out of 5."
"Widely available, try one. Or don't."
"Bottled water has arrived! Well, its not water, but it might as well be. It tastes like poorly treated well water, lots of minerals, lots of iron, no hop taste...very light malt flavor. You can drink alot of it since it has almost no flavor and an ABV below 5% but there is no real reason too."
"It does get high drinkability though, because water is pretty drinkable."
"Notes: They're not the strongest beers, but at the same time if you drink a lot of them you don't have to worry about taping out. A lot of the local stores near here serve them from a 6-Pack, up to a 30-Pack. Prices are some what cheep, so by all means, have at it."
"A decent fall back beer for hard times, really."
"Drinkability - This was my ""go to"" beer before I started drinking craftbeer. I haven't had it for about 3 1/2 yrs. It is easily drinkable, but so much more is out there that can do what this beer can and more as far as being thirst quenching, being refreshing and ease of drink. I would only drink this to fit in or if it was all that was available."
"Overall. Pretty standard for a macro brewed light. Very small amount of flavor and depth. I cannot understand why people drink this stuff unless they just don't like the taste of beer."
"D- Easy as water to drink. Down a case of these and not get drunk."
"May as well drink a glass of water. It is better in bottles."
"I wouldn't drink this bad boy unless it was the only thing a buddy has on hand after a hard days work."
"I would get a finger of fizzy bone-white head briefly after the pour, but it would disappear as quickly as my students after the bell rings. Color was a light lemon-yellow with NE-quality clarity. Nose was faintly lager sweet, but with an adjunct scent also. More rice than corn, but still pretty bland. Mouthfeel was effervescent, fizzy, like drinking pop. The taste was so bland and nearly nonexistent that I found myself wondering why I had bothered. Finish was nearly tasteless, watery and bland. I had a better time drinking all of that malt likker yesterday. At least they tasted like something ..."
"Only scores as high here as it is so easy to drink. Not much in the way of taste, or anything else for that matter."
"D - Wanna watch the game with your buddies and get wasted? this is probably the beer for you; where's the chips and salsa? I can drink quite a few of these, especially when my focus its on the beer; goes down like water"
"Best way to drink the beer is on tap or keg. Not a beer for those who actually enjoy beer. Best if drank with country music, friends, and a fishing pole."
"D - As light lagers go it is average. Maybe slightly worse than a Bud Light, but that doesn't say much. I will never understand why people drink these."
"Coors Light has a terrible, very-light straw colour but the head on mine was actually decent. I smelled nothing... even when I dipped my nose in the stuff. It doesn't have much flavour. The main thing I get is corn in the middle and aftertaste. This beer is flavourless but drinkable... but you already knew that."
"d- ideal for beer bonging, nothing else"
"Cold Activated Can and Vented Wide Mouth do nothing to help this beer. One finger head sounded like soda pop and evaporated in seconds. Straw color resembles a 3 on the SRM beer color chart. Smell is that of wet corn and straw. Taste like corn, rice and sweet malt, but has a mold flavor. Mouthfeel is that of fizzy water. This beer is cheep, and there is a reason for it. I think I will pass on any more of this, unless there is nothing else and I am already drunk and thirsty...really thirsty."
"Pours pale straw yellow, tons of effervescence. Ha! No head retention at all. Lot and lots of bubbles, how fun! Gosh the smell is very solvent, acetone-like with some sweetness from all those adjuncts. Just took a sip, wow nothing really there. Unfortunately what is there is an aftertaste of glue/solvent. I swear I do not know how people can drink these, just from all the weird off flavors. It would make me vomit pretty fast, this has a low abv but could never be a session brew for me. The mouthfeel is bubbly, prickly and grating on the tongue. With all the bad things going on in the brew, I thought I would give it a chance. I was *slightly* surprised by a few of my macro picks lately, I mean, they weren't quite as awful as I thought, was hoping this might do something but make me feel nauseous. Down the drain we go..."
"Overall, if you have to freeze the tastebuds to slide something past them, the product sucks. But ""the Silver Bullet"" is in fact better than Bud Light, if that means anything."
"I usually don't review Quizzo beers, but since I've yet to review it I see no is as good of a time as any. This beer pours clear...I think there might be some yellow in there, but it really just looks like water. The smell has the adjunct aromas, but they actually aren't really that off-putting in fact they might be construed by some as sweet. Though the aroma is fairly non-existent in the first place, which I've learned isn't really all that bad. The taste is a light lager, there's not really anything too it. It served it's purpose as cold beer...God help you if you let it warm up. It's really easy to drink it, goes down smooth. It really is best enjoy if you really don't focus on what you are drinking and just drink it. The subtle imperfections will go unnoticed. The problem is I was looking for all of them. It still will be my go to beer if I'm forced to pick a BMC product, but since that's not the case (thank God for that!), I'll leave it on the shelves for the people who don't know any better."
"Overall, not much more than a throwaway beer that's good for beer pong and college parties. It's like $20 for a 30 pack at a convenience store. Don't drink this if you can avoid it."
"It has the taste of a watery, flavorless lager. It's not offensive, but far from tasty. There's high carbonation and a light mouthfeel with little to no aftertaste. This is a very drinkable beer if you're just looking to slam a few back quickly or are playing drinking games. It is very refreshing when ice cold and enjoyed on a hot summer day."
"Serving type: bottle"
"Pours a clear straw yellow color with a thick (at first) head which quickly dissipates and zero lacing. Smells of grain and water. Not much else. Very clean taste -- like barley soda -- malty maybe a little yeast bread. Not the worst adjunct I've had to date. Mouthfeel is pretty thin. Tons of carbonation. Drinkability is decent."
"I reviewed Bud Light in which I know not a lot of people are impressed by it. I think Coors Light is worse than Bud Light. The color resembles rain water after a cat pissed in it. There was no foam at the top after the pour was complete. The taste was very unimpressive. I couldn't see my self drinking more than one. As a matter of fact I would rather not have one again. When coming in a bottle it is relatively tolerable. I would not recommend it."
"Yeah, it's a lame beer. I didn't expect anything else. Remind me not to go places that have nothing better on tap."
"Light, watery body, with no substantial attribute for drinkability. Unappealing and unattractive from top to bottom. Great job, Coors."
"D: Since it's very watery, its drinkability is not bad. Nevertheless, I suggest a bottle of water instead"
"D- Why does anyone want to pay for this swill? It has no character and is like a mild beer flavored cooler. I'd rather just drink pop than this and I will not be buying this in the future. I have had and have Chinese beer that is better than this and that's generally not great beer either. I will say that it is easy to drink though b/c it really isn't like drinking beer. Why can't MolsonCoors bring Coors Banquet beer up North....at least that's half decent!"
"Another Quizzo brew. It pours a clear jaundice topped by somewhere around a finger of white froth. The nose comprises wheat, rice, corn, corn syrup, and grass. The taste really doesn't bring anything new to the table, aside from the usual hard water flavor that accompanies these damn adjunct lagers. The body is quite light, with a sharp moderate carbonation, and a very watery feel. Overall, if these things weren't so cheap, i don't think many would continue to drink them. That said, it served its purpose as mild lubricant during Quizzo. So it had that going for it..."
"The blue mountains were kinda neat though."
"mouthfeel is more or less standard for the style; light-bodied, watery, high carbonation. drinkability is this beer's major selling point (which isn't saying much); marketed to a younger demographic more interested in quantify than quality, IMO coors light succeeds to some degree. inoffensive and super light, i *could* drink a few of these... i just don't see the point."
"drinkability: none at all. after the third gulp i wanted to throw up again and again. it was just too much carbonation to drink. so disgusting, i would never drink that again."
"Can. Ok, so I had one of these in the fridge left over from a get together and decided to rate it. Beer poured from a can meant for, well, probably left in the can but I'll pour it into a glass. Pours a very clear golden yellow color with a very fizzy white head that pops its little bubbles pretty frantically. What's left of the head after it settles is very little head at all. No lace at all. The aroma is that of sweet baby corn but nothing really else. Pretty non descript. The taste is pretty non descript as well until you get this lingering off flavor in the end. Semi sweet up front. The carbonation on this is pretty high and gets in the way of any real ""flavors"" that may be there. Pretty light mouthfeel. In the world of beers, how does this rate. Well, pretty bad. I'm sure there are worse but I would go micro any day of the week instead of grabbing one of these."
"I can take these down all day especially if drinking games are involved... way too easy though."
"Honestly though, if you're looking for a cheap party beer, go buy Pabst Blue Ribbon or the canned watered down version of Schlitz. They're both cheap adjunct lagers, but they're well done cheap adjunct lagers."
"Tap into the . . . something else."
"What the hell??"
"One of the best light lagers out there. Easy drinking and perfect after a hot grass cutting day. Not alot of flavor but hey this is light beer. No off flavors and nicely carbonated. At around 3.8% this is a really good all day drinker if you are at a lake, sporting event, concert or BBQ. The fact that the mountains turn blue when its cold, brilliant!"
"Drinkability- If you like fizzy yellow water than it could be drank all day. I probably wouldn't order this even if I was out and this was all they had on tap. More marketing, less taste. Thats the Coors Light way."
"D: It is sweet and watery and has no real taste to it...Why not buy Yuengling or PBR? Same price, much better taste, and also easy drinking"
"drinkability is all this beer has going for it if you want to piss all night, its what it was made for getting drunk , and thats it, plain and simple. out of all the big macro light lagers out there, this is one of the worst. thats kind of like being the smartest kid on the short bus."
"drinkability is all this beer has going for it, its what it was made for, and thats it, plain and simple. out of all the big macro light lagers out there, this is one of the worst. thats kind of like being the smartest kid on the short bus."
"Final Thoughts: Drinkable and sessionable. Thats definitely the only point to this beer (as well as the marketing campaign). But would certainly NOT be my first choice at the beer store."
"It's watery. I've never had it from the bottle, but the out of the can has that bad aluminum taste, despite some sort of fake liner they put in. But hey, the mountains turn blue on the side, in case you have no sense of cold/hot. I will never purchase this beer, but will have one if its available and free."
"if the mountains aren't blue i would recommend not drinking it."
"Obviously, this is a really generic beer that is about equivalent to tap water in terms of excitement. Mainly, people drink it because it contains alcohol and sodium. The best thing you can say about it is that it is not foul tasting. Goes well with V8."
"D you can chug it you can also chug pond water it would be about the same"
"D-for the style, not a bad beer (highest in the style is a B- or something). Still, I will pass unless I need to be drunk and fast."
"There's just nothing to Coors Light. It is more clear than yellow, hardly any head, hardly any real aroma, light corn taste. Mouthfeel is crisp and watery thin. No aftertaste. It's drinkable if you simply want a buzz and it's the only beer around. Otherwise, no thanks."
"Let's face it its not a great beer but I do like drinking Coors light if I'm hanging out at a friends house during a bbq or watching football games ( ps. Go Chargers!!!) The main reason I like them is you can drink 6 to 8 with out being really buzzed. The water flavor is not bad and the feel is smooth and easy to drink. The color is your basic American domistic gold. The plus side you can pick up a 18 pack for around 10 to 12 bucks."
"Pours a very lightly hued yellow, nearly translucent, into a pint glass with a very considerable head. This looks like dirty water, or perhaps, urine. Smell is a funky, unpleasant aroma that I can't really pinpoint. Taste is barely discernible as ""beer", but instead might be described as nasty ricey, near beer. Drain pour for sure, the only reason I had it was for a party for those amongst my friends who prefer such things. Taste the rockies, they taste like watery urine, mmmm."
"D - Unsatisfying. it's inoffensive but it definitely lacks flavour and is just too bland."
"This was a total surprise, honestly. I thought it was going to be so fucking bad. And it just so happens to be the best light lager I've tried. I mean, I don't ever want to have one again. It's pretty nasty. But compared to, say, Bud Light? The Silver Bullet takes the crown."
"Suggested pairings: burgers and brats on a hot day"
"D If its thirst quenching you are looking for, then you found it with this beer. Drink it fast and drink it cold, once it warms, its time to start a new one. They only cost a buck, so they are more or less disposable. Drink 'em and toss the warm part away."
"Very pale yellow with fizzy head with no retention and lacing. Smell is very faint, some grain I guess, but I think I'm really trying to smell something. Taste is pretty much almost beer flavoured carbonated water. Pretty much just watered down beer that is ultra fizzy that makes it harder to choke down."
"Not as bad as Bud Light but thats not saying much at all."
"No mouthfeel aside from carbonation, which actually ups the drinkability."
"Purchased in Canada. Crystal clear and pale yellow with a thin, short-lived cap of white foam that quickly disappeared. A modest collar lingered for a while and there was a bit of spotty lace. Nearly non-existent aroma, just a bit of mineral and slight sweetness. Light sweetness in the flavour, faint floral hops, very low bitterness. It finished with a harsh metallic character, which wasn't helped by the thin body and aggressive carbonation. No need to have any more of this."
"Pours a one finger white head that fades quickly to a thin layer leaving no lace. Crystal clear pale straw color, like looking through colored water. Light-medium carbonation and very light bodied. Faint corn nose? Flavor is lacking, mostly hints of corn, no hops, no malt. Fortunately a tiny bottle. Remarkably similar to MGD 64 Light. Took me over 2800 bottles before I reviewed - no more over with! $1.25 for a 7oz bottle from Colonial Spirits Acton, MA."
"Sadly, this is not a one time event. This is my non-beer-drinking wife's favorite beer, so we tend to cycle a fair amount of Coors Light through the house.... I've been noticing this pattern with Coors Light at least for the past 5 years, in both bottles and cans."
"Pretty good from a bottle. Nice to have a cheap beer that tastes pretty good, and the cold monitor in the mountains is convenient. Oddly, I noticed a sight sweet aftertaste when compared to most beers. Not anywhere near my favorite, but when on a budget this beer is fine."
"I thought I had already reviewed this but surprise. Oh well, it's out of the way for now and for all time."
"An instant numbing sensation hit my palate and I was unable to discern much for a while. Texture is watery, thin, and carbonated like a soda, maybe a little less. Ah yes, there's the corn I'm looking for. Perhaps a slightest hint of bittering in the finish? Or maybe I'm confusing that with the metallic and mildly veggie-like malt/rice. In any case, I'm not impressed with this watery excuse for a beer."
"It's not skunky or a bad beer; I've had craft's that are actually 'bad'. It's not bad. It's simply a mass produced refreshment product...and as a bonus, unopened cans float when you're floating the water on a lazy summer afternoon, bottle's don't."
"I didn't expect much when I opened this, and there weren't many surprises. I think the only reason i even drank this was because my boss served it to me, and who can refuse that? Pours a pale yellow with a thin white head that is gone as soon as you put the can down. I didn't catch much smell, but what little I got was a faint grain smell. Taste was nothing spectacular, its an awfully watery beer which seems to be the way its supposed to be; as inoffensive (thus tasteless) as possible. The mouthfeel isn't much better than Sprite. Although I could handle drinking this again, it just isn't worth it, why bother?"
"D: Again, it's drinkable. Not terrible, and certainly would not be considered a ""good"" beer in terms most folks on this site would consider. But, alas, it is easy to drink and it's not completely offensive like some beers. (Corona, Heineken, Honey Moon to name a few) Not my first choice, or even my 50th choice, but it's in my top 10,000 beers of all time. Not as if that is saying much."
"Coors light is absolutely unavoidable. How it became ""the"" drink for seemingly everyone around the world is beyond me. Beyond the fact that there is very little of note in the taste of coors light, it isn't even a very drinkable beer and doesn't feel good in the mouth. I guess the best thing it has going for it is you can consume a large amount of them and be mostly unaffected."
"D: Coors Light is just that, a lighter version of an already watery beer. I suppose a few of these wouldn't hurt on a super hot day when you don't quite want water but you don't quite want beer, either. I reviewed this beer keeping in mind the style, which is what I think a lot of craft beer drinkers forget. Light/adjunct lagers aren't my first (or second or third, etc) choice, but they are what they are."
"I have had worse, but not by much. Plan on giving most of my ""home draft"" away to non-BA friends."
"It tasted just as watery as the last time I had it. The color is what you all know well, the palest of yellows with just a dapple of head. The smell is a little grain, maybe some corn and a generic metallic hop aroma. It was not good, there was some residual sweetness that I did not remember it having since usually these beers were being shotgunned."
"I will never be sure why someone would bother drinking this. Taste is not bad necessarily but it's SO watery and flavorless it's amazing that it's even beer. In that aspect it's been a while since a beer has amazed me this much."
"Not too bitter, has an appropriate amount of hops and carbonation. Alcohol content is obviously less so even after a pitcher or two it's pretty easy to keep walking straight."
"Coors Light, the beer that got me started (sad to say). I find that this beer is any typical drinker for the one that doesn't care about quality, handcrafted and phenomenal beers! The one awesome thing about Coors is that fact that they are one of the smaller, big three."
"D: Its decent. Dont expect to get a ""head buzz"" type of drunk though. Its ideal for a cook out where you will be eating and drinking a lot but don't wanna vomit. The beer is that nice and light. Also refreshing after a long day. I wouldnt recommend buying it unless you are outdoors a lot."
"this was the first beer I ever tried 10 years ago. As an 18 year old college student this was probably the best at the time. Not really a college beer, but better than alternatives bud light and natty light. I bonged this beer the first time I had it and it turned my world upside down to a world of beer."
"On a less serious note, the mountains turn blue when it's cold enough to drink (sadly mine are grey), it has a vented wide mouth for ease of consumption (gulp), and it has a frost brew liner whatever the hell that is (it locks in the frost brewed taste, they say). They have a note to 'do something cool. Recycle.' I'm cool. Ooo!, get this, they also give you the calories (102), carbs (5), protein (0.7), and fat (sadly none). Word."
"People actually knock these back by the dozen on cold winter nights. Wow. Nothing really here. Better than Bud Light, and maybe on par with Miller Light. Was offered and politely accepted, but would never chase his down."
"From what I've heard about this beer, it actually had more flavor than I was expecting. Not stunning flavor, but flavor nonetheless. I'm not sure what anyone that's reading a review for Coors Light would expect, but it's just another light beer in the crowd. It's a bit more bitter than Bud Light but I like it. *Everyone* drinks Bud Light so Coors seems kind of refreshing in a way. Overall, I'd say it's decent for this category but not overwhelmingly good. Pretty watery, moderately carbonated and easy to drink. A good beer to buy in bulk for a party or BBQ but that's about it."
"D- Drinkable to an extent, basically one of those party / cookout beers. High drinkability and cheap price tag. I could probably drink half a case and still not feel drunk."
"D- macros are what they are. Meant to consumed for the masses. This can be dranken is massive quantities. If it's hot out and you have a group of people, you don't need to deny that coors light is at least an option to pound some beers. I can't believe I am actually being positive"
"AWFUL!"
"Almost anyone will drink it and most will probably wind up liking it. I personally think it is second in taste to Bud's version but overall how can you really complain, its 5 bucks a six pack."
"Drinkability: Typical of an american macro. Good for the beach or hot summer days as simple refreshment."
"Hmmm...Not really sure what to say about this beer...Appearance was a light buttercup with a distinct amount of haze to it. Very thin head with overly active carbonation. Aroma was weakly of grain. Tasted like light grain in carbonated water....slight (very slight!) hop crispness at the end. Overactive carbonation in the mouth is distracting...."
"D: Very drinkable when very cold. Another backyard-grass cutting-BBQ beer. For best results drink straight from the can. Very sessionable and hard to beat the price. Beer for the masses or mass consumption."
"Sinkability - It has to be pretty damn hot and you gotta be pretty damn thirsty to want to drink twelve ounces of this stuff."
"As for drinkability, once you get past the taste, you can drink them all day because drinking these babies is like drinking bad tasting alcoholic seltzer."
"D: Hey, I was at a ball game having a good time with my pops. There is a time and place for every beer, and last night it was time for a tall boy of Coors Light! Skal."
"very little going on here, where ever you are there's better beers to drink"
"I haven't had one of these in a long time and it wasn't as bad as I expected. I even kind of liked the smell , even though it didn't smell like a beer. It's certainly not anything I would ever drink again because there's really no taste to it but it's not awful and I can see why some people like it. It's sweet and alcoholic and as easy to drink as soda."
"Reach for the Rockies!"
"I would not buy this while at the beer store, but if there is nothing else in the cooler on a hot day..."
"Don't buy this beer if you are seeking a flavorful beer. coors Light is really good for one thing and one thing only. Getting people intoxicated quickly. Coors Light is probably one of the easiest beers to drink, so that's why it's so popular in colleges I guess. I'm sure any one who went to college has drank a serious amount of Coors Light."
"Cheers!"
"d - The one area where I rise above a 1.0 for this beer. Its competition beer. Good for chugging and punishment for losing. In that sense, you can drink and drink and drink and..."
"D - This is this beer's strongest suit. It's very refreshing because as Eric Idle once said, it's like having sex in a canoe. It's f--- close to water."
"I poured from my cold activated can into my Coors Light cold activated glass. The mountains are blue so I know that it is cold enough for me to drink. I got a white, fluffy head. Then it was gone. This libation is straw colored and clear. I almost have to use my imagination to get any smell or taste from this one. I get a slight bready smell. The taste is fleeting. I get something but it is gone before my brain can process it. This beer is the closest you will ever get to water besides drinking water. I used to make fun of this tasteless beer in my Busch drinking days. I guess it's good for when your not in the mood for a beer but want water with a 4.2 ABV."
"Drinkability is nothing special. Probably the only good quality would be the fact that it goes down easy and leaves nothing behind. Nothing for flavor in this beer for sure, but I could see why someone would want it for something cheap on a hot day. But I would certainly rather have something else."
"I will drink it if it was the only beer in my presence."
"The one desirable characteristic of this beer is it's head, however I'm pretty sure it's persistence is due to one or more chemicals."
"yellow!no head!hardly any smell,and tastes like water!cant beleive how popular this beer is,must be all the people who want to drink beer but dont really like the taste of beer.dont think i would drink this unless it was the only thing available,although i bet you could drink a case without catching a buzz!"
"D: Did I mention thin and watery? Drinkability is solid in the sense that I can drink 10 or 12 during a night of competitive beer pong."
"I can notice the difference between this and beers like Miller Lite right away. I will only have Coors Light when I'm having more than 6 beers in a day/night. The color is so light, there's hardly any head, it's just weak. Not to mention they make such a big deal about frost brewed, and blue mountains, and other silly marketing ideas. Does anyone really want a train bringing snow when they open a beer?"
"Many, many better light lagers out there (Grain Belt, Rolling Rock, Bud 55, Michelob Ultra). Avoid."
"Overall: College students! Pay the extra few bucks and get something refreshing like this. Coors Light is the most neutral of the light macros, and thereofore the least offensive for many."
"O - You can definitely drink a lot of these with the light body, but what's the point?"
"Not one I'll have again for sure..."
"The mouthfeel is very thin and watery, with a high level of carbonation. It's fairly easy to drink, but only something I have when I'm out and need something cheap for the night. Definitely my go-to drink when I'm out with friends."
"It doesn't taste like anything. Its like water. Nevermind."
"Drinkability: For the style this is fairly good. I was surprised with how drinkable this is. There are other styles I would reach for first, but if I wanted a light lager, I could session these. Although watery, it seems like a good beer for outdoor work."
"D: Drink this COLD. That way it goes down quick. This beer was not meant to be analyzed, hence it falls apart under close examination."
"D: Not nearly as horrible as I expected. Pleasantly surprised (and moderately confused, hehe)."
"Drinkability: I'm done after this one."
"Overall: A bad first impression of American lagers."
"Pours a light yellow color, nice carbonation, small white head, with some sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, with some hops, slight caramel. The taste is slightly sweet, malty, slight hop note. Light body. Not drinkable, would not buy again."
"D- If you are in college and need a cheap beer, and are unfortunate enough to live somewhere that doesnt have a wide selection of beer, than this is for you"
" D- This beer has no off flavors except for the green apple candy note. It would have been nice to see even a hint of hop or grain but there was really just nothing."
"ok it has been FOREVER since i have consumed one of these lovelies. but yesterday at a family party i was offered a beer to which i said ""sure!"". once i saw it was a coors light i could not withdraw my commitment, and be rude. so the pour looked like light colored pee. i wanted to attempt a pour instead of drinking out of the can but perhaps i should have kept it in the can to preserve the coldness needed to keep this as drinkable as possible. it smelled fine...not like a load of dung in a bag...just fine. the taste was ugh...shittastic. i had to get it down as quick as possible b/c as it warmed it started tasting as if i was slurping some type of liquid off the men's room floor of yankee stadium. and that's how it started to smell. has craft beer turned me into a snob? perhaps...but i'd rather be a snob, than drink fat smelly guy pee in a can. just me..."
"Overall though, way better than Bud Light, Keystone Lt, Natty Lt, etc etc, still better than Miller Lite. i've foudn my personal winner for this category, and I'm sticking by its side."
"No head, aroma, lacing or flavor to speak of. I literally could not finish the beer. Normally, I can drink this beer but the past couple of months I have been drinking more micro brews so this now tastes horrible compared to the latter. This was served at a party so I didn't have much choice."
"Cheers!"
"Notes: What you would expect. Always used to say that this is everyone's second favorite beer, and everyone kind of likes it, but doesn't really like it. Not offensive at all but not good."
"Nothing I can say we don't all already know. It's a cheap American beer produced for the masses. I actually like this beer and if I'm drinking bmc and am going the light route this is my preference. A solid beer when holding a party or football related event."
"D - Couldn't get through this one as I poured half of the bottle down the drain. Pass."
"Pours a pale yellow with a thin white head. Nothing much in the aroma, same thing can be said about the taste. Barely any flavor, maybe some sweet grain here and there, but that's about it. Pretty much like water mixed with hops. Easy to drink a bunch of these since it's like water. Stable college party beer, but that's about it."
"D: Of the big three macro light beers, Coors is definitely my least preferred option. Bud Light, while insipid, at least manages to be somewhat crisp and refreshing. This can't even really manage that. Reasonably inoffensive, but there's just no reason to bother. If you can't get beyond light beers, at least drink Miller Lite instead."
"BOTTOM LINE! Only drink this if you are handed one. The only reason I did this review is because my room mate's brother bought a 12pk and didn't even finish half before he left so my room mate was like oh go ahead because she definately wouldn't touch them. The funny thing is this is my Step Sisters favorite beer but when she had it was bottles which was slightly better but only slightly!"
"(d) Drinkability is defined by usuage. If your looking for the cheapest beer to forget about her then this is the one. Drinking for quality...pass it up. Could finish a case of 24 if you wanted to...but who does? (3/5)"
"I've spent so much time learning to describe complex craft beers, I don't know how to even describe the flavor. Maybe it's because there is very little to identify, only a metallic graininess. But this one is build for speed rather than comfort, with the light body and high carbonation making this as much of an easy-to-drink thirst-quencher as a beer can be. There's a reason you play flip-cup with Coors Light instead of Hopslam. This beer is what it is, a mega-pale light lager, and I won't fault it for that."
"Mouthfeel is a bit fuller than I expected for the style. Not good, but not as I awful as I thought it would be. No drinkability though. Hard to finish."
"This beer isn't for anyone but if you don't really care for beer, at least you can drink this and it wont have much ""beer"" taste. It is also a good beer when spilling it is a high risk, for example at a concert, or while playing beer pong. Don't sit down with this stuff."
"This beer pours a see thru amber colour with average carbonation that leaves a fast vanishing one finger head and no lacing,the aroma is grains and malts and not much else very little hop aroma here if any,it has a light mouthfeel which is very macro and well carbonated but not well flavoured at all with average tastes of grains,malt and liquid hops,this beer is definately macro and would not buy or drink again if offered,there is too many other good brews out there to have to settle for this."
"I look forward to my next brobeer tasting research."
"This is one of my least favorite beers I have ever tasted, which is strange because Coors Original is one of my favorite cheap brews. This basically tastes like horrible water, if there is even such a thing. Should not even be considered a beer at all... give me anything other than this and I'm sure i'll be happy."
"D - Water is fairly easy to get down. At 4.2 percent... I'll take a stone levitation ale please."
"Drinkability - not a very good session beer unless you have nothing else or are looking for a cheap fix then this isnt for you."
"Mouthfeel is super light and super carbonated. Gross as everywhere else. Drinkability amounts to a drain pour, although I have been known to shotgun these when I get wasted, so I have to give it a little credit here."
"I think this beer is a waste of money."
"i think coors light is one of the better light macro beers out there so i am judging this purely on the category it's in. when i'm out with the boys on a saturday night and i've had quite a few 'good' beers, i am definately reaching for a few of these to finish the night."
"These are drinkable but I highly avoid it."
"Clear bright yellow with too much carbonation. A white head that disappears almost instantly. Can't quite describe the smell due to the almost total lack of one. . . The taste is not much more of an impact watery, slightly sweet grainy/metallic flavor? Not quite sure what to call it. Overall, nothing impressive about this beer."
"the beer was a light piss yellow and had a bounty of thick white head. the only thing that is keeping the score from a bottom barrel zero is the quantity of the head. the smell was of light corn and metal. th taste was of light corn and carbonation. it is just a watery, super cold, corn bath."
"Coors Light isn't getting much love from BA. It isn't an elite beer, but it isn't a bad choice if you want to have a few ice cold, refreshing beers. It's also a very affordable option if you're low on cash, a better choice than the other cheap light beers. Don't be afraid to take a ride on the Silver Bullet."
"Overall, I'm a fan of Coors Light. I do not care how it looks or how it smells. It's a cheap, light beer that actually has some taste and a nice bite to it when it's drank straight out of the bottle, so I continue to drink it. I'd say that it's the worst beer that I drink regularly, but I still drink it regularly, which is more than I can say about any other American light lager."
"D. make sure that you are already drunk before you drink it cause then you won't taste it going down"
"I have a tough time reviewing these light lagers because I honestly can't discern between them. This tastes and smells pretty much like miller and bud. I'd have to do side by side for all of them to pick out any differences. I don't understand how the ratings are that much different, unless everyone does side by sides."
"Poured into a pilsner style glass. First I don't drink this, wouldn't get caught dead with it out of princpal but keep some on hand for friends (hey I try to be a good host). Makes a loud fizzy noise when poured. Head disappears into a slight film quickly. Clear pale yellow color. Sorry I take a swig and get nothing. As much flavor as seltzer water. I can't believe I have friends that enjoy this."
"D-as always incredibly easy to down, and will continue to be. My personal favorite of the bottom run Macro-beers, buy it for a party or a lonely night"
"D- All day. No problem drinking this at any time of day or night with no other choice."
"OK I've had 2 light beers back to back.... and this is pretty bad."
"D - Blech...I'll have water instead."
"Taste is slightly sweet and tart, no hops at all but a hint of maltiness. Mouthfeel is very watery with a light carbonation. Easy to drink as long as it's cold but once it gets above 40 degrees it goes WAY downhill."
"I guess this is what happens when more money is poured into advertising than R&D."
"overall, it's not bad for what it is: Coors Light seems to be better than most light macros, beating BL and Miller Light by a long shot. next time i have this though, i think i'll have it in the bottle so as to shield my senses."
"Not much different than the other macros. I would say it has more flavor than other light beers. that's not necessarily a good thing."
"D: Coors Light is absolutely nothing special aside from the fact that when you've just mowed the lawn or worked a long day and you just want a cheap, light, beer that is refreshing and just about nothing else it tastes great. Coors Light has none of the ""off"" tastes that sometimes I feel Bud and Miller have. All in all, if I want to drink a light, cheap beer I'll reach for this. Any other time, I'll drink better."
"I've had this beer on-tap too, and enjoyed the latter version far more."
"It's light bodied...no really? Good thirst quencher, but so is water."
"Perhaps those humorous NFL commercials can overcome the complete lameness of this beer."
"Drinkability: I could barely finish half a glass of this. If you want a light beer, go to Sam Adams or a basic german pilsner."
"Smooth consistency, but this reflects only in the mouthfeel. Finish is watery, even for a light lager."
"I have had several times, and it is finally time to review it. Clear gold color which you can see right through. Small head, poor retention. Smell is very faint hops. Some grain. The taste is light like the smell. More like water in many ways than beer, but not as offensive as some light lagers. Very thin feel. On the positive side, it is also smooth and easy to drink. Not very good, but not real offensive either."
"This beer is like nailing a ""4"...You would never openly admit to the experience, let alone brag about it, but it was there in a pinch during your dry spell. And when you were hammered, it seemed like a solid ""8."""
"M/D: It has little to no mouthfeel. If you want a general comsumption light beer, then this is the beer for you. This beer is meant to be drank Ice Cold."
"It reminds me of a glass of water into which someone accidentally poured in a little beer. I understand the mass market for beer in the USA is young adults who prefer quantity over quality. Coors Light is perfect for that audience. You can drink it like water because it is water."
"Tap the Rockies!"
"According to style I think Coors Light meets the objectives pretty well. It has a bit more of a cleaner profile than B&M, very light and non filling as you would expect. Drinkable if this is your type of style. I may have learned that I would choose a CL over BL or ML if someone is handing them out."
"Drinkability? If I want water, I'll drink water. If I want a beer, I'll look for one with a taste."
"Pointless reviewk, but what the hey!"
"Pours an almost clear bubbly fizzy watery yellow without much of a head besides a few bubbles at the top. Smells like a frat house at 3AM after everyone left and the floor is covered in sticky beer residue and empty cans. Taste is bland and uninteresting. Mouthfeel is very carbonated and very watery. Drinkability is poor, this just tastes like nothing."
"I like it better than Bud and Miller Light, but frankly I can't imagine someone drinking this for any reason other than to get drunk or so they can show off that they had a beer."
"D- This beer is not for me or a lot of people who drink for the taste not the effect. I am not impressed at all with this beer. I'll pass it up anytime I can."
"One thing that's always baffled me; it has a faint banana taste to it. What the hell's up with that?"
"this is without a doubt my favorite light beer, i dont really drink light beer so that isn't saying much but if i'm looking to play a bunch of drinking games with is what i would go with every time"
"D: because of very little taste and feel it will pass some what on a hot day if i'm about to die of lack of beer."
"D- This beer is very drinkable when you want to just slam something. Sadly, this beer is not for me or a lot of people who drink for the taste not the effect. I am not impressed at all with this beer. I'll pass it up anytime I can."
"D: drinkable only because it doesnt taste like anything... below Miller Light and Bud Light in my book. The worst beer i have ever had."
"~ 12 oz can. Found this silver bullet all the way in the back of my fridge. It was hiding behind a bottle of Orval, which I will be enjoying next after this soon-to-be disaster. I will not even give this sorry excuse for a beer the luxury of sitting in my Leffe glass, so I've decided to just gulp it down right out of the can. You can only drink this ice cold, and if you let it warm up, you might as well just throw it out. A good thing the mountains on my can were blue, an indication to quick-drink me now or you will be sorry later! A run-of-the-mill choice for any reunion where your friends think Budweiser is the best beer in the world! ~"
"poured into a pilsener glass, pours a beautiful piss yellow color, bland smell, its a light, watered down beer, doesnt taste bad but not good either, good drinkability for parties other wise its a no-go from me"
"D: Well, if there's a ""saving grace"" of this beer, this is it. It is drinkable in the sense that it is nearly tasteless so that you can drink it quickly and easily."
"Cheers!"
"As a college student, Coors is my daily bread as Jesus was to beer. It sucks, the mouthfeel, taste, and smell are horrible. Yet, because i'm in college and I drink this all the time the drinkability is pretty damn good. So damn bubbly, this beer will make you burp all day long. Don't be fooled by their flashy ""blue mountains"" bullshit. This beer is shit. However, drink Coors light on a hot day and you will think your re-hydrating yourself with pure, natural, spring water. Drink it as a refreshment, nothing else. If you prefer pissy water drink coors piss... if not, PBR, Yuengling, and a lot of other beers are cheaper and much tastier."
"Overall nothing special. Just your run of the mill light American lager."
"Is anyone really rating this beer objectively? It's tough to!"
"Drinkability..psh thats Bud Lights slogan Mr Cold as the Rockies. Negative anyway. Dont drink this unless someone is threataning your life."
"Final Thoughts: As one of the beers that most BA's love to hate, the silver bullet isn't as bad as everyone makes it out to be. Now I'm not saying I like it, but it's pretty much the standard for the Light Lager style. If you are looking to have a couple with the boys on a hot summer day, but have to drive home then yeah, maybe get Coors Light."
"D - Exceptional. You could easily drink six of these and be none the wiser. I'm not saying this is a good beer, but it IS very drinkable, due to its close resemblance to water and minimal aftertaste."
"There is not much to review here. Standard pour with the classic transparent straw color, mineral and metallic nose along with corn and grain, light in body, very rough around the edges. This is perhaps my worst review I've written, but it gets old reviewing the same shit."
"Drinkability: Surefire crowd pleaser for the college mentality to drinking: light and slammable. In the 'light beer' category its a decent rank but as an overall i'd say only if I was on a budget and counting calories."
"Poured from a 12 oz. can. Has a pale straw color with a 1/2 inch head and virtually no carbonation. Smell is of mild corn and malts. Taste is, well, there is none. I guess like beer flavored water. Feels watery in the mouth. O.K. I have to give it to them on drinkability. Great for chugging or drinking games, otherwise avoid."
"D: Pretty low. I mean if it's this or water, the water has fewer calories. And I don't mean that to bash the beer, it's just that if I'm going to take some calories I want something for it, like flavor. But that didn't me from drinking bathtub size portions of this in college..."
"Not much to say about this beer it just has little unique qualilties that don't stand out but i will still drink it."
"D: This beer sucks. The cold-activated cans and bottles is just marketing non-sense to hide the fact that their beer is terrible. Not that I like to drink light beers, but there are better ones out there."
"This is little more than slightly alcoholic, carbonated water. Sure you could drink it pretty easily if you wanted to, but why would you when there are so many other options out there? At least other things have flavor."
"D- Maybe it's the best of three evils? Maybe not...but overall the lack of taste certainly isn't a great characteristic."
"Appearance: Really, like piss."
"Do you know what Coors Light and sex in a canoe have in common? They are both f**king near water. This is a good beer for people who don't drink beer. An alterative to water on a hot day, but only if served ice cold. My wife used to drink this before she developed an appreciation REAL beer."
"D - No thank you. My Dad always talks about how Coors was the shit back in the 70's when it was only distributed west of the Mississippi. Back then, his buddies used to come back from ""Mizour-Ah""with this then-unobtanium and marvel at how inferior it was to the swill that was readily available to those fortunate enough to live smack dab between the shit-beer meccas of St. Louis and Milwaukee."
"Compared to the other major us brands this is probably by fav, not saying a lot though. In Colorado its actually slighty better."
"D= not that bad but I would much rather drink something else. Luckly this was free for me as I got it out of an evicted apt... sletchy"
"obviously a straw yellow. almost like bud light, but even more watered down. fizzy head recedes right away, no lacing. not much to say about this beer other than comparing it to a bud light but even more watered down, with slight amount of citrus, on the nose and tongue."
"T- Slight sour taste that made me a little queasy. Why drink beer. This site says respect beer, I'm sorry, but this is not beer. It has no taste, no flavor. ust watered down. Seriously, Becks Non-alcoholic is better than this."
"Back in the '60s we called Coors beer -- Rocky Mountain CoolAid. What would we have called watered down CoolAid? This beer is watery and not much else good can be said about it. Others have said it better than I can. Mouthfeel is weak, taste is atrocious, and poured appearance is without obvious merit. Drinkability would be adequate for the non-discrimiinatory palate, but would not satisfy the more erudite person."
"cheers"
"I was raised on American macros and learned to love the flavor of Schlitz,PBR,Miller and Old Milwaukee enough to choose beer as my drink of choice. I moved on to finer beer and always disliked the idea of light beer. But on a hot day or if the idea is to get buzzed, why not suck down some light beers to do the trick? Well, this is why. Coors light is piss yellow. That is not a bad thing. The taste is watery when ice cold, grainy and sour when warm and undrinkable when warmer than room temperature. I am convinced that no hops exist in this beer. Cold creamed corn and a stalk of barley, maybe. Beer for those who don't like beer. That is a bad thing. Beer should be enjoed and not tollerated. I have a good friend who drinks this and I give him shit all the time. Life is too short to waste time and money on what is not enjoyable. At least grab a Bud or PBR. Better yet, just quit dinking beer if this is what you must drink. i would rather have a cup of coffee or tea."
"This beer has its place though. It belongs in sticky, dingy frat-house basements, coolers at the beach, and everywhere else craft beer isn't and likely won't be appreciated."
"Not the worst light beer as it could be very refreshing on a hot day. This would be the beer I think non beer drinkers should like this as opposed to bud light as this has litte to no off flavor."
"Oh Coors Light. The beer that made up 90% of my drinking Freshman year of college. I managed to pretty much avoid it all of my sophomore year as I had discovered Killians Irish Red and Blue Moon. This beer is really only good for drinking games. I avoid it as much as possible."
"Tastes pretty much like water."
"*- Out of the 3 major macro light lagers, my favorites are: Coors and Miller Light neck and neck, then Bud Light last. Non of these beers have real flavor profiles. These kinds of beer are advertised for their drinkabilty and how refreshing they are, and Coors Light is no exception. Coors Light claims to be the ""most refreshing beer in the world", but honestly if all macro light lagers look and taste the same, how can Coors make that claim? Oh gimmicks! I can drink this beer fine without fussing, but then again I'm not out to call it stellar either."
"Pours a very pale yellow color it is slightly hazy. There is little to no head on it and no lacing. The aroma is of water and maybe grains. The taste is well again water and maybe grains more like a generic alcohol. The mouthfeel is light and slightly carbonated. Overall could you drink a lot, yeah you could, you could also drink a lot of water as well. Please give it some complexity maybe some spices or some hops would be nice."
"How could you even get buzzed off of this beer? Is there even alcohol in it? Is this high fructose corn syrup beer safe to drink? What the hell is this crap? Its my life goal to avert people from drinking this thinking its beer."
"Yeah, it's a cheap American light lager, but I can't pan it. It's a cheap American light lager - you get exactly what you expect. As far as they go, it's pretty unobjectionable."
"Edit - I thought this was the anti-beer. Till I tried Red stripe. So I'm adjusting my review so that this comes out just ahead of Red Stripe."
"The mouth is bubbly spritzy. This is a thirst quencher for sure. Flavor is of mild corn and grains. This is very watered-down and simple, as it should be. This isn't the worst beer I've ever had, but I won't make it a regular that's for sure."
"I wanted to review this beer first because it is summer, and I'm drinking a lot of it. For the cost, this is my go to beer. I find it refreshing and smooth. It's not amazing by any standard, but for 23 bucks a 30 rack, it lasts a long time, and goes down easier than any beer in the cheap category. And, hey, now they have the insurance policy of getting it as cold as the rockies. I firmly believe you can still be a beer advocate and enjoy the smooth taste of the rockies. There's a time and place for both sipping and guzzling."
"Dr. Sure, I could drink lots of these. It was $2 Coors Light drafts on Tuesday."
"Out of an aluminum can this beer was a perfectly clear, pale gold color. The head was a full three fingers of fluffy white head. The retention was good as a pillow-like cap. The aroma was semi-sweet and bleached, macro grains and a metallic staleness. The flavors were very dry and boring. Dominated by macro grains yet alcohol still was present along with some stale notes and metal hints. Very washed out and less pleasant than its other macro-brewery brethren. The mouthfeel was watery, the body light and the carbonation high. I always hate to fail a beer, but this one sucked."
"I know most people drink this because it is cheap but even at that price some beers have at least a little flavor. This beer resembles what I pour down the sink after rinsing my pint glass. Seems like Coors has been doing a lot to improve the cans, here's an idea: Try improving the beer."
"Drink better beer. Rahr & Sons Gold Medal Winning ""Ugly Pug"""
"Drinkability: Quite honestly, I found this to be one of the better light beers I've tried. Don't misunderstand, it's not fantastic, but if you like light beers, this might be one to try."
"Very, very light beer. Flavor is thin, watery, and unimpressive. Might be good if you don't actually want to enjoy the flavor of beer."
"I guess its drinkable, one of the most watery boring beers I have ever had."
"Finishes very much mineral gristy like and it just lingers on the tongue. Couldn't get it to leave."
"not good"
"I worked my way up to this, as friends had left some beer in my fridge and I just HAD to conduct research in the name of beer...pours a yellow (like cellophane paper) with sparse carbonation and a thinwhite lip of head set in a Coors Light pint glass--going classy...corn/rice component dominates--can you smell cold?--a bit bready as well, but clean and simple otherwise...a liquid palate, with a bit of oil--fizzy as well; quite drinkable but not substantial...corny, syrupy sweet and softened to a fluffy lack of alcohol punch--taste? After feeling sick at the thought or smell of Coors Light for over a decade, this glass actually made e feel at ease; still, the beer inspires little in me that would reach for it, even if I was cutting grass on a 90-degree day--if they quit the pathetically illogical sales pitch of ""coldnesss"" I probably would just ignore the brand instead of lampooning it--at least it's been years since we had to endure ""Twwwwiiinnnnsss!"""
"Drinkability - enjoyed the beer with a spicy peppery chicken plate. Didn't offend, got the job done. Fairly refreshing on a hot day with some decent grub."
"Snowy white head with very good retention for the style - actually, it's pretty good for any style. Body is a very pale, clear yellow-daffodil color with less visible carbonation than expected. The nose is mighty weak, just hints of blandness over a base of nothingness, dry pasta, banana chips, glue, and soda water. No off-aromas, but that doesn't count as an accomplishment when there are essentially no aromas at all. Very mild on the palate, too. It really tastes almost of nothing; softly sweet with the faintest hop flavor I've encountered this side of non-alcoholic beer. Fizzy yet soft, very dry, and as drinkable as tonic water. It is refreshing, but if someone told me to close my eyes and take a swig of this, I'm really not sure I'd be able to identify it as beer."
"Snuck one can home from softball to do a quick review. Coors Light is not too bad for a light lager, probably my 2nd favorite light after Miller Lite."
"Drank directly from a 16 ounce can with blue mountains, meaning it is as cold as the rockies. Freshest date stamped on the bottom of the can. I didn't feel a need to pour this beer into a glass. This beer when drank cold is somewhat refreshing on a hot summer day after working outside. But be warned if you do buy it that it is a watery macro and not to be mistaken for anything else but a mass produced, mass advertised brew for the majority."
"Eh, why not? It doesn't taste that bad, and I could definitely knock a couple back if someone was passing them out."
"D - Meh. Goes down fairly easily but why waste your liver on it?"
"Thin bodied, medium high to high carbonation, a bit metallic, watery. Yum!"
"What can I say, my summertime on course beer. No other option at most golf courses we play. It is watery and beer flavored and tastes pretty good when it's 95 degreees. You can put 12 of these back and still function so it serves it's summertime purpose. Good beer?...No...drinkable?...Yes."
"Its a drinkable bad beer. Especially in the hot sun. I shouldn't complain about having a beer stop during 18, and I went 3 deep this round. But we all know - this is not a well made beer."
"funny because this is the first time I ever drank this beer from a glass to give a fair review."
"D: Drinkable, if I'm having a light beer this is my choice as it does not have anything really objectionable. It is like drinking beer flavored wter."
"Extremely light and crisp, but due to the overall lack of flavor, I wouldn't want to reach for another one."
"I'm making a vow- next year, the keggerator in my house will never EVER hold a keg of coors. You are henceforth banished from the land."
"D: overall if its hot and you want to mow the lawn and get a cheap buzz pick up some of this great for bar b q's"
"Mouthfeel / Drinkability: The body is thin and watery. The carbonation is active. Frankly I still dont understand this beers popularity. Boring thin and watery are not virtues of any beer I want. Oddly enough I would score this one lower directly from the can. The carbonation becomes stinging and anoying. From the can no aroma and no flavors are present. Just a weak alcohol delivery system."
"Serving suggestion: Out of the can, bottle or plastic cup...don't bother dirtying a beer glass for this one. Or better yet...just recycle the can, but leave the beer in it."
"If you are inexperienced with big beers this a beer that would be good to try. A good session beer and/or a good summer time brew. The feel is light and is light going down, this beer leaves little or no fingerprints at all."
"Pours very pale yellow. It's highly carbonated, but there isn't any head. I can't smell anything. I really tried but the surrounding smells drown it out. Tastes crisp and clean (like a Fresh Rocky Mountain Stream). Would be nice if I was eating hot wings or Indian food or something, due to the carbonation, but otherwise not much to see here. Did you know you can get Schlitz for 5.25 per 12 pack? Did you know it tastes better than this? How about that."
"Had a coldie on tap, in the usual ballpark plastic cup, with a fully loaded hot dog at the Angels game yesterday. Delicious. Nothing like a beer and a dog at a ballgame, and neither one disappointed me, nor did the Halos. This is just a pleasant beer that I enjoy drinking."
"I went to a party with some friends after our son's first Holy Communion. Our host offered a beer and of course, I accepted, wondering what new taste I might be introduced to. I hadn't had one of these in over ten years. It was in the new? ""Vented"" can. Crystal clear with a slight yellow brown tinge. Smells of aluminum and grain. Tastes like Coors light, which is to say it is flat and watery. I don't want to break the Respect Beer rule but... The mouthfeel was that of water. I guess it was drinkable if I was very hot and thirsty and there was no tea around. The antithesis of a good beer. Hard to believe these same guys make the respectably good Blue Moon line. Avoid."
"Final Thoughts: Its a fairly cheap beer. Good for parties. Easy to drink. I enjoy it"
"M/D- When all else fails head for the rockies."
"Overall, I am glad I got this from a buddy. I would never buy it. I will definitely stay away from this one."
"Alright, so I have brought myself to review this beer. It's light, it's refreshing, and I must have had this beer more times than I could count. There's nothing more to expect out of it and its cold activated bottle. It's great for, shall we say, recreational use, and maybe a default choice for a beer at the bar. It's my choice beer over Bud Light and Miller Lite. It lacks any sort of robust, triple-hops, or beechwood aged taste, but its drinkable all on its own."
"Its cheap, and I suppose to have with a meal its next best thing to water but water can't get you tipsy. The same applies to mowing the lawn. And although I'm not in a 100% sober state, its never been good. and in the state that I'm in its equivalent to water I can drink away. I must ask my father why he adores this beer so much."
"I've chugged many of these over the years when I didn't know any better. It's thin bodied, fizzy, and watery. Massive TV ads make you feel like you can get your mack on more easily by drinking this. There is a little malt flavor hidden in here with the usual corn/rice cheapness associated with the style. I must hand it to the brewers for finding a way to make a beer not taste like beer. The best way to describe this is non-offending. Some of my buddies dearly love this beer and they consider an IPA one of those ""dark beers"". Ha ha."
"Taste is equally neutral. It does not give me the gag reflex that bud light and miller light sometimes do. The carbonation is about the most flavorful part of this beer, with a few mild notes of malt and corn. This is not a bad brew for hot summer days at the ballpark or after yardwork. I prefer it over any of the other BMC light beer offerings."
"The lack of strength in flavor, ABV, and the watery mouthfeel contribute to the drinkability. I could easily put back a few of these. It's obviously not the most delicious beer in the world, but as long as it's cold, it's not THAT bad. But if it's warm... I would rather not drink at all, to put it in a nice way."
"This would only be tangentially acceptable on a hot, sunny, very thirsty, medically dehydrated day, as a moderately more alcoholic substitute for that other mountain-fresh beverage sold in over-priced bottles at bars everywhere."
"D- Like it, but it's not going to be something I reach for if given an option. That said, I could also drink a whole twelve pack."
"D: DRINK IT COLD, taste like... for lack of better wording bad if it gets the least bit warm. Again it is cheap beer but still nothing to look forward to, would choice others (keystone) above, not as bad as some (natural light). easy to drink cause it goes down like water."
"[Coors Light Fun Space: the ""Frost Brew Liner"" (R) in this can supposedly ""locks in taste."" Probably a great idea, since there's so precious little of that to begin with.]"
"D - This is one drinkable light lager. Goes down well and refreshes. A solid lawnmower/session beer."
"Great way to end my night. It's light golden in color and thats about it. Theres nothing smooth, flavorful, or complex about it. It's a light beer that my friends and I use for beer pong. It's one of the first beers I ever had growing up, and thankfully its not apart of my everyday life."
"D: Probably the most drinkable of the style--it's the one I'd resort to with no other choice. Goes down fairly smooth, and I could see having this one over the other lights in a place where even Bud wasn't available."
"Drinkability is there. Not offensive and it also has alcohol in it! It is what it is."
"This one has got more water in it than the Mississippi...the other night I finished two prima pils 12oz and was left only with a coors light keg and it was almost undrinkable..light yellow appearance and no smell, taste of nothing but additives what was i thinking..only drink this stuff if there's nothing but water available, maybe you'll pee less.."
"I hate to macro bash, but this is rusty water. Never again."
"The foam was bubbly, light and dissapated quickly. The smell was that of the foam - I couldn't really smell anything except a hint of light hops. Taste was horrible. I swear I couldn't taste much of anything. The smell was a pre-curser to the taste - nothing with a hint of light hops. It came with the 'Cold Activated' bottle. What a cheap gimmick to get you to buy their beer (if you can call it that). I can imagine their thoughts - we don't know how to make good beer, so we'll get them to buy it through gimmicks and adverts."
"D: Has a high abv for a light beer, tastes pretty much like tecate light."
"For years this was my beer of choice. Light beer with a descent taste that you could drink all night. Light taste, but watery. Good drinkability, but slight aftertaste. There are better beers at a cheaper price (Schlitz, PBR) Not a bad beer, they sell enough of it obviously. Better than Bud Light and Miller Lite."
"The beer has no flavor, and while it doesn't taste bad, I just don't see the point in drinking a beer that lacks any true beer flavor. It's very drinkable from a refreshment perspective, but to me it's so similar to drinking club soda that I find it pointless to even drink this beer unless it's the only thing to drink at any given event."
"This is a beer I would drink for a light american lager."
"Good drinkability if you are looking to get drunk bullshitting with friends, party beer. Of the light beers just to party with this is one of my favorites,"
"An easy to drink session beer with small amounts of flavor. if you want to get drunk of lots of beer and not taste much, this is your beer."
"not my favorite of the light beers out there ..i didnt not see what it would look like poured i drink it out of the can when with friends bullshting fishing or out side..taste it too watery no real grains or hops jump out to me just taste plain.. drinkably is there if its hot and you need water"
"Final Thoughts - This beer has a place in the realm of brews. It goes down easy and provides light flavor. Definitely ideal for the masses, but not as favored on this website. I enjoy it better than Bud Light, but that doesn't necessarily say very much. Ok light beer. If you are low on cash, pick this one up, otherwise put your money elsewhere."
"The aroma has a hay/grapefruitthing happening. The head is gone within a few moments. It looks like a flat apple cider. Not much taste but goes down easy. I'd buy this beer again when money is tight and I just need to keep a cold beer in my hands all night long."
"D - As drinkable as water although not quite as good at room temp. Good at one price - free."
"Overall - If I was forced to watch my diet and only drink light beer, I might actually drink this. But as long as I have access to craft brew, I wouldn't waste my time with this."
"Drink only if its the only thing around."
"OK drinkability at best. I have rated macro lagers pretty well; I try to consider the style when I review. With that said, I still do not like Coors Light. It is not a good beer at all, and I would not recommend."
"Not much reason for me to drink this. I am not try to bash this beer more than need be, but I hardly ever enjoy this."
"The taste is ok, a little watery, and the same goes for the appearance. The importance of this beer is that it's drinkable and cheap. I drink it once in a while and don't feel cheated because it's a light beer, what do you expect?"
"Verdict: Another very boring Light Lager, but quite probably the one I'd reach for from a cooler stocked with only Bud Light, Miller Lite, and Coors Light. It's not as skunky as Miller Lite and just a little bit better tasting than Bud Light."
"I supposed when you take a really bad beer and make a light version of it you should not expect anything good. Pours light yellow, thin white head, and minimal lacing. Nose of corn. Watery mouthfeel. Flavor is corn. This is really vile stuff. I don't give many scores this low, but this has to rank with one of the worst beers in the world."
"I think this beer is another example of beer snobs rating a beer low because it doesn't match what their idea of a good beer is. Now, I love a good beer, but this beer is pretty damn good. I have never had a beer as drinkable as this one, it goes down nice and easy. I will admit it doesn't look or smell all that exceptional, but the taste is crisp and clean and this is incredibly drinkable. Silver bullet all the way."
"There is no reason to describe this beer. This beer should only be consumed from a 30 pack, and only because it is the lesser of the 30 pack evils. Sometimes I would rather NO BEER than this beer, and that is saying something. Stay away unless the only purpose is to put alcohol in the system, and even then, think twice."
"-vt"
"Poured to a snow white head that lasted about 20 seconds. Beer was very light yellow in color. No lacing. But I guess I wasnt really expecting one. Had a straw or maybe a slightly sweet corn smell. Very faint smell. Nothing really going on here. Had a slightly sweet taste. Maybe of apple or cider taste. I dont know where that came from. But the flavor just reminded me of cider. Felt carbonated in the mouth. Also very thin and watery. I wouldnt of bought this, but a friend stopped over and brought a sixer. Of course I had to try a couple. Maybe if it was a hot summer day and you were mowing the lawn and this brew was very cold. No, I dont even think that would make it taste good."
"I'm glad I didn't buy this. A free pass on an unrepeatable beer for me."
"It also does not smell good at all. I guess you can drink alot since it tastes/looks like water...that's not a good thing."
"D- Overall, this beer is just lacking in so many ways. To any other college kids who may be reading this: Spend the extra few dollars and find something with some taste. The only reason I still drink this is to play beer games with my friends who have yet to see the light and convert to good beer."
"It makes me want to put a silver bullet in my head."
"This beer can be summed up simply. It's Keystone Light with just a bit more flavor. This is one of the only cheap beers I'll buy. And then, I only get it for beer pong, friends who don't appreciate good beer, and for various mixed drinks I make that require a cheap low-taste light lager."
"This beer endeavors to taste as little like beer as possible. I suppose it achieves that. Well done Coor's Brewing Company."
"Only good for beer pong, people who dont know any better at parties, and for beer games in general."
"Drinkabilty-- nothing amazing that i would personally be searching for often, its something though my gf enjoys to drink which is rare for beers so something that will often hold spot in my fridge for when she stops in, nothing amazing meant for hot summer events ice cold to drink fast in high quanities"
"Mouthfeel: Very carbonated, thin and watery."
"I won't give it a failing grade because it's an easy out if you need to bring ""something"" to a party"
"pretty good ability to guzzle these. not entirely offensive for a macro light beer. about the same as miller, much MUCH better than bud. just more flavorful and mellow on the mouthfeel. not bad as a ""i'm having six or seven of these"" option."
"This is probably close to the worst beer on the market. I have turned this beer down on several occasions. It's even clearer than the straw yellow that is apparent on most light lagers, and nothing could be worse than this unless it was water with food coloring. The head went down so quickly it might as well not been there. The smell is a turn off in this beer. I can smell only a few hops in this beer, but it's definitely not a good smell. Smells like a spoiled beer. The taste is okay. I feel like I'm drinking water with a bit of alcohol in it. It's overcarbonated and weak on thickness. It can be drinkable because it's light, but that's this beer's only redeeming quality."
"The beer pours a very pale gold color with a thick frizzy white head that quickly fades to spotty lacing. The aroma is below average. It has a dry lager yeast aroma with the faintest hint of pilsner malt. The taste is below average as well. There really is little malt taste at all. It's basically watered down regular Coors. It goes down quick and finishes dry and clean. The mouthfeel is average. It is a low bodied beer with good carbonation. This is the standard for light macro lagers. I don't see the attraction here."
"I am going to review this with only light beers in mind. I like the high carbonation. I like to feel the bite when I drink my beer. Light don't have much in the taste and smell department, but as far as light beers go this has the best flavor to me. It feels good on the palate and is very east to drink on a hot afternoon."
"New to the site and have to start somewhere. The only good thing to say is that it is a good beer for long afternoons or evenings when I am looking for something light and it is available. I can start out drinking a Coors light but if I switch from a different beer, I find it has a very sharp or bitter taste. Best ice cold ""guess it helps deaden the taste buds"""
"Offered to me at a party, and I didn't want to seem ungrateful. Might as well review it. So this is the silver bullet huh? This pours a light carbonated fizzy yellow with no head or lacing. Smells of faint straw and light fruit. Taste is carbonated water with a little straw and metallic. I think this is worse than both Bud Light and Miller Lite, and that is saying something. At least it has alcohol in it, I need a drink after tasting this.. wait..."
"D- decent for the style."
"This beer isn't worth rating properly. this beer is repugnant. Even if i wanted to get hammered and all that was around was Coors light. I'd make the trip and spend the money to avoid it. I've even paid 5 dollars extra a beer at Gillette stadium to avoid this stuff."
"D- You can drink this stuff all day. It might not be enjoyable, but it is quite drinkable."
"drinkability: very easy, goes down easier than water. good for drinking games"
"One of the worst beers I've ever had. It's very yellow with little head when poured. The smell is bearly there and tastes a lot like bad water. It has a mouthfeel of aluminum or steel. Only time I would drink it is when its dollar beer night or something like that"
"If you can get past the smell and taste you can probably enjoy plenty, if that's your kinda thing."
"Drinkability is why people use this for beerpong. That's what it should only be used for."
"Overall: really, really bad"
"In conclusion, if you are looking for cheap lower calorie beer, let's face it, you could do much better for just a few cents more."
"i am going to try and be ojective here but its going to be hard. first, when poured the head quickly faded to zero and left the beer looking like a pale yellow glass of water. almost no smell and taste to it the best thing i can say was it was cold. you want to walk right buy this one at the store. it was left here by my son in law at christmas."
"Had this over at some friends for dinner last night...it was this or an undated bottle of Loyalhanna Lager that our host thinks may have been 3 or 4 years old. At least the ""Bullet"" was fresh. First let's look at the beer, brown bottle that at least looks like it should contain beer, neat graphics on the label and the twist off cap is nice. Once the cap is twisted however it's all down hill. The color is pale yellow, almost watery with a head that doesn't wait for the beer to stop being poured, it disappears so fast that one would think there's no carbonation in there. Now the taste and smell, or rather, lacks thereof, they're both so weak and insipid as to be nonexistent. Water has more flavor than this. Okay, I waited for dinner and thought the food would improve it. WRONG. The food completely overpowered it. How the hell does Chicken pot pie overwhelm a beer? Any and all flavor completely vanished like washing your food down with a glass of water. The mouthfeel was thin and watery and for the rest of the evening I switched to pepsi and root beer. Needless to say the drinkability was zero. And if you wonder why I gave it 1.5 on the smell and taste ratings, it's that it isn't awful, just bland and weak."
"Drinkability: The priciest glass of water I've had in quite awhile."
"How did I used to drink this by the case?"
"...Bill"
"Not alot in terms of atmosphere or flavor, but drinks easy, and is very light."
"D: Could drink 24 of those without much problem. Low ABV, low taste = easy to drink!"
"D- Easy to drink if you can get past the taste."
"Coors diesel is better."
"For what its worth, if you want to get a cheap buzzr, and don't care what it tastes like, this is definitely for you. Cheap, easy going down, just watch out for the headache the next morning."
"Very clear,highly carbonated,with almost no head. Aroma of light grain,and a fake sweetness.Crisp flavor,very little actual flavor.No hops no malt. Very overpriced for what it is. One of the better macro light beers but just not very good beer . Stinky if you let it get warm."
"Most of my friends are not into craft beers, and if we go out for a few pitchers, this will be what we get."
"A very light color with carbonation bubbles. . The smell is corn malt and yeast. The taste is bland with yeast malt and corn. No Balance in this beer. It has a chalky finish that is slightly bitter. I tasted this on a dare, I should have not done it is not good at all."
"24 oz can received for free from a friend, couldn't turn down the chance to try this bad boy. Decided to defile my beautiful Moonlight Brewing Co. imperial pint glass with this one. Pours a pale shade of yellow, clear as can be. Despite the enormous amount of carbonation visible in this beer, the head dissipates in about 15 seconds; pretty hilarious. The nose is faintly malty and sweet, a bit chalky as well. Light enough that I can't really describe it better. The taste is similarly bland and watery, faintly sweet for a moment with a bit of cooked corn. The finish is clean as can be, no bitterness whatsoever. Blah. By the way, what the hell is a cold activated can?"
"I won't review another token pale lager on this website again. One is enough, this review should apply to all of them."
"Tah-dah! The official beer of every sporting event I have ever attended. Pours nearly clear, with a hint of yellow, and a head equal to the size of the pour. I guess, for ratings sake, you could say this tastes like metal and grain. No real taste or aroma, but these do go down smooth. And rapidly. And come out just as fast."
"Why do we even do this to ourselves? This is what we are rising up against. But this is the optimal light american lager: meant to be conumed in great amounts while building a tree house, watching a baseball game or playing a softball game. It's good for what it is, but what it is is not good. It's like a bad handjob: ypu gotta appreciate what happening, but ti's pretty awful and you just want it over with. Better than Bud light."
"Although this is very easy to drink, it doesn't really have much else to offer."
"typical mass-produced macrobeer. smeels and taste like water, corn and metal. only good for fraternity parties and in huge mugs at Midevil Times. Pours a very pale golden yellow color with very thin fizzy head that dissapeard immediately. Smells like the floor of a fraternity house blended with corn syrup. Gross."
"Drank from the can. Nothing special here: bland, watery taste of light hops, grains and metal... also some funky aftertaste. Not very refreshing. Everyone has had one, but I would much prefer Coors original to this if I'm going for flavor. Really not a good for much more than a game of beer pong."
" Strike three!!!"
"Drinkability/Final thoughts - Highly drinkable, nothing offensive unless you don't like that sort of crisp grape/apple like flavor. I was impressed by how well the carbonation held throughout (Didn't get flat!) Well, its easy to drink, affordable & not offensive. If your into lite beers, Id say go ahead and give it a try. Not bad."
"This is not a beer I would go to for flavor or even to go with a meal, but after a day on the lake or after mowing the lawn on a hot day, there is nothing as refreshing as an ice cold silver bullet."
"Drinkability: Not bad the taste can wear thin over time."
"D - It gets from me a decent rating for drinkability because there's nothing about it particularly off-putting, and even though I'm not a fan of it or the taste in any fashion I still would be capable of drinking a few without problem if I chose to. It is smooth only in that it is very thin and slightly watery."
"It has a light yellow color with very little fermentation whatsoever. The most notable trait about Coors Light is how incredibly watery it is. There is some metallic taste to it as well, but this is mostly forced out by the extremely high level of water in the beer. Very easy to put one down and pick up another."
"D - Bad. Not even refreshing. Just an awful brew."
"(draft @ Greater Rochester International Airport - Rochester, NY) Pours a pale yellow with lots of bubbles and a thin head. Has a very faint aroma of hops. At first drink, you get a piney/fruity taste that quickly goes away. Very thin and watery, not much for a flavor or an aftertaste."
"D: The Silver Bullet is Coors' number one brand because? I'm guessing the incessant advertising during sporting events is the key. If you want a beer without that beer taste, this is for you. I'll pass."
"The only time I will drink this is when its the cheapest thing at the club and I just don't care. Usually fairly expensive for what should be a cheap light beer, $15 or more for a 24 pk. Have some friends that love this stuff and I still can't see why. Probably the worst light beer out there, in close competition with Busch Light. The taste is just really bad to me."
"Brother in-law left a six-pack,and I didn't have time to hit the packie. I put them in the freezer to get them as cold as possible, I was actually attempting to freeze my taste buds, the poor things go through enough as it is. Even at 28 degrees the overwhelming urine smell was present, finished 2, choked down half of a third one, ate 3 peanut butter sandwiches then set my face on fire, still can't get the taste out of my gob. I can't believe I used to actually ""pay"" for this stuff...ah live and learn"
"I poured it out at half of a cup. This is bad by even BMC standards. The reason they want you to drink it so cold is to mask the horrible flavors of the beer."
"Drinkability: you have to be shitfaced to enjoy this."
"Only had this brew because part of a 6-pack was left at my house. Figured might as well... poured a very light straw color with small white head. This beer has a grainy smell that was barely present. The taste was the worst I have ever had. There seems to be something wrong in the formula. It is almost a bad metallic taste (out of a bottle). And the aftertaste just leaves a bitter (and not good hops bitter) taste that will not go away. I am glad that I didn't buy this beer or I would be horribly upset, but since it was free, whatever... avoid at all costs!"
"This is the ultimate softball beer. If you dont wanna taste that ichy liquid known as water then subsitute Gatorade or Coors Light. No taste. Nothing to complain about. I swear they dont even put alcohol in these because I can drink 20 and still be standing. WARNING: You will pee constantly."
"Overall, another mainstream party beer that ruins the perception of beer for the public when somebody has this as their only reference for what beer tastes like."
"Tonight we did a taste of macros and I don't think I'll ever be the same. The flavor was absolutely horrible. It tasted like corn flavored air. I would drink this beer if there was nothing else. I used to drink this beer in college occasionally, but still preferred the taste of a decent craft beer. I can't believe what I used to subject my taste buds to."
"Pretty much a standard macrobrew. Light yellow straw colour with a finger head. No lacing. Aroma is all malt, no hops. Again, the taste is malty but not in a sweet way. Over carbed and watery as expected. Need to drink it ice cold, the label turns blue when its cold enough to drink. Thats not a good thing"
"Right. I couldn't find any odd slight flavours. On the other hand, there weren't much of any flavours at all here."
"Nothing special to report. There's bad beer and then there's terrible beer. This is somewhere beneath both of them, the bastard child that only advertising and capitalism could produce. Light cheap beer should normally at least go down easy, but the taste here is just foul out of the bottle. Its a bit smoother on draft, but definitely avoid."
"Okay, Okay, this beer is like water. But I still like it! It pours a very light yellow with lots of carbonation. This beer really does not have too much taste to speak of but I love to drink this beer with Mexican or Chinese food because it does not have a strong taste. It is a very light beer that does not fill you up when you are eating food. This is my go to beer when I just want to drink something light with food. So, ok, it is not a great beer by any means, but it is just fine for an American Macro Light Lager. Chow down and drink up! A great beer to eat food with when you don't care about matching food with the perfect beer. A great alternative to soda. :)"
"Well this beer certainly isnt anything youd want to drink but when you want to party its cheap and in my opinion the best light beer to get. Some of my friends who drink this every week wont try anything else. Ive tried to get them into the craft brew scene but for some reason they just want their cheap light crappy beers. Avoid this certainly"
"D: Why a 3.5? Not because I'd ever willingly want to drink this, but if its a situation where many many beers are going to be consumed then Coors is far from as bad as it gets. Though in a normal situation when enjoyment is a priority, then I'd give it a .5 as I could never get excited about drinking it."
"Drinkability- This is really all this beverage can offer"
"The taste has primarily a character of old, funky apples, not quite unpleasant, with a hint of dishwater. It has no noticeable hop or grain taste, but the flavour is fuller and more long lasting than regular Coors."
"Best in it's class. Normally stock up on these fro parties and get-togethers. I'm not saying that I'm a diehard Coors fan but other beers in this section are much worse. Overall it's a very mild (watery) brew but the flavor is decent. Goes well with party foods. Not very aromatic but most people who stock up on coors don't care about that anyway. I approve."
"I used to like Coors Light, and even deemed it my favorite light domestic. Well, not anymore. The pee coloring and the taste of sour water have pretty much done me in. It tastes really flat and flavorless and those nights when I used to be able to drink it on command are far gone. Drinkability is questionable, I mean, it's very light so you can drink quite a few...if you can manage to. I guess the college party days are behind me so naturally, so is my approval of Coors Light."
"D: This is where this beer shines. It is extremely drinkable, especially when you are not in want of an overpowering or expensive brew, but are in desire to knock back a sixer to get feelin' good. I suppose it does what it sets out to do: be a quintessential light American macro."
"Drinkability, hmmm, well it is easy to drink. But it really lacks depth for body. Sure style hinders it but that doesn't mean it should lack complexity. It is what it is."
"D: I have had several of these in one sitting, but only because I was going for longevity at a bar watching football, with no other alternatives."
"Light yellow color with a slimy white head. Barely-there aroma of sweet corniness. Flavor is adjunct-flavored water. Sweet with a metallic quality. Thinnest body possible. Overcarbonated. Easy to drink but also hard to drink. This sucks. This sucks a lot."
"d - fantastic, really, especially if it sits and get a little flat. Water anyone?"
"Drinkability- One of the most drinkable beers out there. If you're at a get together, I'd recommend this. If you're on a special occasion, avoid this beer. (Superbowls, and parties are perfect for this beer)"
"looks like piss, has no smell except for some faint caned corn, the taste was faint malt washed away by water. THIS ONE SUCKS. this is a stapil of beer pong and outher collage ""sports"". this one was left in my refridgeator and as a last beer of an evening i fugired why not, now i rember why i don't drink this crap."
"Drinkability is fairly low. It's definitely sessionable, but it's just not good. I really find it hard to stomacht his brew, and doubt I'll make it through the rest of the can."
"It is unfair to criticize any of the BMCs too harshly, because they are, in fact, top sellers for a reason. This is not a forum for macro-lovers though, is it? Drink at your own risk though BAs..."
"In all honesty this a decent cheap light beer option. One of the better Light beers matter of fact. That's not saying much though. Don't bother pouring this one in a glass and analyzing it. Just pound a few while mowing the lawn. They're not too bad. Also, got one of those rocky mountain flavor six packs... I dunno, I'm sure it's a gimmick but they tasted alright."
"Golden, better head than most other light macro lagers. Faint aroma of corn and grain. Tastes great when intoxicated or when it's 100 F out and you need something refreshing. Under any other circumstances, steer clear. Mouthfeel is emaciated and dry, and could either be considered very smooth or very nonexistent. I'll be honest, I'm from Colorado so I grew up on this stuff. My first beer to shotgun...really my first beer to drink. There will always be a place for this beer in my heart, just not in my fridge."
"Poured from a can into a pub glass. Weird light yellow color and thin head which disappeared almost immediately. Not too much smell or taste. Mouthfeel was thin like you'd expect. As with many light lagers very easy to drink and pound on hot summer days. But, why bother."
"Just skip this and go on the something else. Wouldn't disrespect food by pairing it with this beer. Avoid this at all costs. Heck, tackle someone else to stop them from drinking it."
"If any of this undesirable shows up in your home, dump it down the drain or use it for something useful like boiling pasta, but do not drink."
"As I'm sitting in my shitty office working at 8:30 pm on a beautiful sunny august evening, I found this gem in the lunch room fridge. I figure why not review such a delicacy in an angry state of mind? Aroma is of rancid grain and sweet skunk. Appearance- straight from the bottle which is apparently at the perfect temperature as the mountains have turned blue on the label. Taste- watery, minimal taste of vegetable soup and icing sugar. tickles the back of the throat on the way down. Truly as inoffensive as it gets. If I had just finished mowing lawn, likely would have scored better than me drinking after sitting at a desk."
"One of the cheapest brew that's drinkable in my view. Pours as a light yellow lager with off-white head that dissipates pretty fast. Aroma is almost of water with just a touch of malt. Taste is watery malts with a tiny touch of hoppiness at the end. Mouthfeel is decent but leaves a dry bitterness at the end that's somewhat off-putting. Drinkability is decent and it's easy to find this. Definitely not my first option but if there's nothing else, I'd be fine with drinking this."
"Final note: When they market this beer as ""ice cold," they really mean it... if it's not freezing cold, it's not cold enough. Plain and simple. I'm probably sounding like a broken record by now, but take their advertising as a warning and get a freezer ready if you want to try this ASAP, or at least prepare them by leaving them in the refrigerator for several hours before even attempting to open one. Mine wasn't ""cold enough"" (despite coming right out of the fridge), so I will likely try this one again (straight out of bottles next time to hopefully get a better temperature). If this stuff could just stay cold enough, I can imagine it being a decent drink-from-the-bottle type of session beer."
"a good light beer, it is refreshing and it has some flavor as opposed to bud light which america seems to be in love with for some reason. light beer is not my choice of beer but if im at a party or sitting around with a group of friends this is usually what we buy and its not bad at all. this beer was not created to be awesome like newcastle but it is supposed to be easy to drink, so i dont think it deserves all the low ratings. and you can slam about a hundred of these without feeling full :)"
"D- easy to put down and this is a college party beer. This is the first time i have had a coors light in a year and half."
"D - Typical macro brew... It has it's time and place, but it's not for me..."
"Drinkability is similar to water with a few bubbles and alcohol."
"This was offered to me by my friend yesterday. I've had coors light numerous times in all forms. I have never been a big fan of this beer there is something odd with the taste that I have always disliked. Aroma is of weak malts and corn, appearance is pale light yellow, mouthfeel is thin and watery, and the flavor is simply not good. This is likely my least favorite of major light beers. Will not spend my money on this but will drink it if it's my only option."
"D: For what is was, a light macro, I would have to say borderline acceptable, though I doubt I could down these in multiples despite its light nature. I would suggest you down these quick before warming."
"D - It's a light beer. Either you wanna drink it or you don't. And I don't."
"Poured a very pale yellow with a thin white head that dissipated quickly. No lacing. The aroma was a slight hint of cereal grains. Taste was cereal grains and a slight hint of hops, but overall not much flavor. It did have a refreshing taste to it, like water on a hot day. Mouthfeel was watery. I could sit and drink these all day, especially when it is hot. But it goes for a quick buzz, not much else."
"D- Drinks like water with some carbonation"
"Beer is a pale straw yellow color. Raised the pour height to try to create some head and got a quarter of an inch, which lasted about a minute. There is an ever so slight hint of corn grain sweetness in the nose and taste of this beer, and not much else. Beer feels light and thin in my mouth, with some carbonation. Overall the only time I would prefer this beer is if my only serving glass were a beer bong. Other than that the cold activated mountain on the front of the bottle that turns blue when it is cold is the best thing about this macro lager."
"Drinkability: Biggest attribute of this beer. Very drinkable, just not drinking mush of anything."
"The beer is an insipid yellow color, with a head that disappears in seconds. It had a corn malt aroma and taste. A thoroughly unrewarding beer; I should have just drunk water."
"overall, i wont be drinking this again any time soon"
"For some reason, I seem to find this at barbecues and various functions myself and my family go to, and it's also the only beer a musician friend I play with drinks, so I run into it a lot. Not sure why, other than it's always on special at the supermarket. I find this to taste okay ice cold, but so do Pabst Blue Ribbon and Miller High Life, but without the gnarly aftertaste that seems to go with Coors and Bud product. My wife tasted this on my breath after a kiss, and remarked ""Cheap beer!"" -- not exactly a ringing endorsement. I wouldn't turn it down if offered, but I'd not go out of my way to pick it up."
"D: Good enough for when everything else besides Bud Light is gone. Otherwise, to be consumed only under unduly limited circumstances."
"I drink this stuff if it is all that is left. I never ever buy it. Only chance I would buy it would be if I was throwing a party and a very very good friend requested it and she was extreamly sexy. It is kind of like a flavored water. A good thirst quencher. Goes down real easy."
"Drinkability- Overall, it's not a bad beer to drink. I would have another, if it were a super hot day and I was at the beach, or if I were at a frat party. Otherwise, skip it."
"I don't seek this out, but if its all that's available, I'll drink it instead of going without."
"Only drink this beer for one reason. To get heavily intoxicated. I don't care if it's rocky mountain water or not. Only good for one reason. Still one more reason than some beers out there. In other words if you are in college and or just turned 21 try it and have fun with it, but don't just drink this beer. Explore the world of BEER!!"
"Hey, it's cheap, wet, and fizzes. What else do you want to go with ten-cent garlic wings?"
"Mouthfeel was quite 'refreshing', or was it the company??, and I drank 3 of the subject brews before running like hell."
"D: Hardly any flavor, not filling at all, I also find it difficult to believe that there's 4.20% ABV in this beer, those characteristics make it a good representation of style, it's your typical ""fizzy yellow beer""."
"looking to save a few$ I'll get High Life in cans"
"Drinkability is great. You can drink on these all day long, as I have many times. Many many times."
"Overall, I will not purchase/order this beer voluntarily. The only reason that I drank it was because it was the only beer at the family function (and they didn't have whisky)."
"this beer really took me away to the rocky mountains. Coors light is a beer that only been and beautiful women drink. Having it cold and crisp brew really took me to another level of enjoyment. I almost cried as the frosty crisp mountain refreshness make love to my throat. Thank you god for Coors Light."
"I love this beer for what it is. It is the only macro-brew that I have ever, and will ever repeatedly purchase. I usually drink it straight from the can, but I once poured it into a chalice and it was a little better. No overpowering scent, but I got a decent head on it and it was very pleasant to drink. It has a grainy aftertaste that I like and the alcohol does not overpower your tongue like it does in some other lower-tier beers. In my opinion, it is the best of the light beers and macro-breweries."
"A crappy bear overall. Tastes like metal was mixed in. Beer flavor comes off as metalic and hardly any beer flavor. Drank out of a can. Probably had something to do with the overall beer taste. Would only drink if given to me free even then would probably just drink water."
"M/D - Thin, light and clean. I find it refreshing when it is ice cold and I am hot as hell. My preference out of the three mainstream light lagers."
"This has been a staple yellow beer for me for a couple of years. This is one of the few beers that tastes best out of a can. You can drink these all night. I am shifting away from the yellow beers..."
"I think Jason and Todd sum this up well with, ""Why Bother?"" Most light beers are very similar so if you want one, buy whatever is cheapest. This stuff is yellow with a white head. The smell is of grains, stale yeast and old hops. The taste is unmemorable. Very light if thats what you are after. The body is light and fizzy. Not very drinkable in my book."
"My grandpa still refuses to acknowledge that there are other beers brewed besides Bud and Coors,but I love him anyway. I just do not love this beer! l"
"I acquired an extra can of this so I decided to review it as unobjectionable as possible. 12oz vented wide mouth can poured into a pint glass. Pours a golden yellow color with a thin fizzy white head that quickly disappears. The aroma is pretty non-existent with faint grainy malt. The taste much like the aroma is pretty bland with a faint grain flavors and just a hint of hops. The mouthfeel is thin and prickly from the high amount of carbonation. The drinkability is high due to the low ABV, but I am not sure I would want to consume much in one sitting due to getting bored. Overall, a pretty subpar American macro light lager."
"There is just no reason to pay for this, tap water is free/cheaper in most cities."
"This is a between a great beer beer. One to cleanse your pallet and keep your buzz when you can't find a bottle of water. I could drink this when I've got important tasks to do like light engine work or pulmonary surgery."
"D- still after all this time, i can still drink it, but it's not the same. i'm actually a bit surprised but then again, i used to drink wild irish rose, too."
"Very dinkable light beer. Pours light yellow in color, very nice head with a crisp taste. The kinda beer you can drink doing yard work or sittting around by the pool with freinds. Has to be one of my favorite light beers. Flows smooth and easy. Wake up the next day with a smile even after many. Hang over free!!"
"Not much taste, a very watery beer. Not much aroma to speak of. Pours a light yellow little head. It is a refreshing beer on a hot summer day...doing yard/garden work..."
"A thoroughly unimpressive beer. Not as bad as the Corona Light I reviewed the other day, but it's probably one you should stay away from."
"The golden color is pale because of the extra watery taste. The foamy head is too aggressive. The smell reminds me of wet grains and tastes limp. I'd have to say this is the worst of the Lights version of BMC. I used to be a Coors fan a decade ago - it's sad to see how far they've fallen."
"Drinkability : beer without any character in the style light lager"
"I guess if your roving drunken college parties, it's acceptable, but otherwise I'll pass."
"I swear it was free, did not pay money for this. Pours a nice 1/4 inch head that falls fast into almost no head and absolutely no lacing. The color is slightly yellow, but looks like water with a tiny amount of iodine. Smell is slightly sour with a slight scent of grain, not a lot of aroma. A small lager flavor hits the tongue and leaves right away with a small nose of the same, lager flavor with a hint of corn. Mouthfeel is like a light soda pop with a strong acidic bite. Overall, this is something I could never get used to and drink on a regular basis."
"Drink ability is pretty debatable. It would be easy to down a half dozen if these, but the taste sort of makes me long for something far better."
"D - Typical college beer. Drank this before I knew what beer was."
"D - I would have to say this stuff is very drinkable, not that you would want to drink much of it but you could easily session it if you were stranded on an island and a crate of it washed up."
"D- Ummm, NO. I could drink ONE if I reaaaally didn't want to offend the person who handed it to me."
"Glad to hear that it is only 105 calories; makes me feel better about my college life. Aroma is skunk and corn with a tad bit of cereal and grass. Appearence is light yellow (slightly dehydrated urine), with extra bubbles and no head whatsoever. It gets points in the taste department for, well, the lack of taste, cause trust me it could be much worse. It is better that this beer has absolutely no taste at all! Very dry and overcarbonated. So far this is the king of the sub 2.0 beers (largely thanks to its lack of any taste)."
"Smells of adjuncts, rice, faint grain odor. Taste is of very faint maltiness, next to nothing in hops, and an off taste in the finish. Extremely watery with crazy carbonation like a coca cola. If you arent looking to enjoy your brew and want to slam 20 of these out partying, then I guess they would be drinkable."
"Draft at Chilis in Sacramento. No head, and basically no smell either. Nothing bad, but just very bland. Taste is the same. Probably the lightest flavor of all the light beers I've had, and maybe why its drinkable. Refreshing when cold for sure, and no offensive flavors, but it basically tastes like water. There are definitey worse ""good beers"" out there that I'd pick this over, actually."
" ~ The only good thing I can really say about this beer is that I'm almost finished with it."
"almost no head very pale yelow in color. Smell was a touch of corn and almost no hop aroma. Taste I never thought a beer could have so little flavor as this. Mouthfeel if it wasnt for carbonation it would have none. Avoid this one if at all possible."
"D: It is easy to drink but not as preferrable as about every other beer. It is the BMC light beer that I drink the most often."
"Drinkability is quasi decent when you eating a big plate of wings with your buds. Or if at the beach and its early, start the day off light and easy with a Coors Light."
"Pours a pale yellow color. This is a bright beer with a thin white head that diminishes quickly. A barely noticeable hop smell is apparent and, quite frankly, reminds me of a frat house after a sleezy party. There is a sour/sweet smell and taste that is associated with cheap domestic beers. A slight malty taste is there, but the adjuncts are definitely what is most prevalent. There is a minimal hop flavor that is really a waste of time. If you're not going to go for it, why bother? The head surprisingly lingers and leaves a little lacing down the glass. Lots of carbonation and a watery, thin mouthfeel give you what you would expect out of this beer. Drinkability? You may as well drink water...or pis. But it does have a label that changes color!"
"Drinkability- It is alright but nothing I am hoping to go back to anytime soon."
"It tasted fresh and was good and cold. That is the only reason I gave it the marks I did. Really boring but this is session beer. Drink a bunch, and party on."
"drinkabilty - There is better stuff to drink, but I see why i liked this over Bud in my pre-BA days. Not a American Macro, its a Lager. Well I'm getting off the silver bullet now."
"This product is the cornerstone of what advertising can do for sales."
"OK fine. I had my fun. It's American Macro."
"How are you supposed to respect a beer like this if the company that produces it respects neither the beer or the consumer? Drink this for what it is."
"D: A bit better than the Bud light I just drank, but still fucking terrible. I like Coors, but Coors Light is the pits. I only did half the bottle at my friend Pard's house then poured the shite down the sink. At least it was free. Thanks for the bunk beer Re-pard!"
"That's not beer...That's COORS !!! You've GOT to be kidding. The Rocky Mountain Freshness must still be in the outside air..Because the can is full of a yellow liquid that has been falsely advertised as beer...Golden. CO has nothing on Rehoboth, DE and the Dogfish Head Brewery.."
"Ah the silver bullet. Their slogan should be more like ""hey, at least it's not Bud Light"" Coors is a good beer to chug, and you have to chug a lot to get drunk off the stuff. I'm not a fan of light beer, but if I'm going to drink a cheap light beer it's gonna be this stuff. The best thing about Coors is their frost brewed liner, which I think really makes a difference. You don't get as much of that metallic taste as with other canned beers."
"Chugged this out of a can on the way to a Jimmy Buffett concert...that's why it got the 2 for drinkability. Otherwise, it's the same as all the light macros. A little sweet, which is alright and gives it a 1.5 for taste instead of a 1. We've all had one, it's OK."
"Pours a pale straw with a thin head. Smells of faint malt and hops. Taste is thin and watery, typical of an american macro. Better than some macro's but still not all that good."
"Stay away. But, amongst Miller, Bud, and Coors Light, I'd go with Coors. Just because it had better marketing when I was younger."
"Light bodied has a bit of grainyness. Best when cold, a beer to pound not to sip and let get warm. Best on a very hot summer day."
"Coors Light was a very pale golden color with good clarity. It had a white head that disappeared almost instantly. The aroma was very clean with a hint of sweet grain. The taste was very light, with a little malt flavor. The mouthfeel was very light and watery (even for a light beer) with medium carbonation. Drinkability was below average. This has got to be about the most watered down beer I have ever tried. Not recommended."
"Mouthfeel is fizzy and then bitingly stale. I can see why Coors lays it on so thick with the ""ice cold"" business; if this is even slightly above said condition then it's totally unpalatable. Worst beer I've ever tried."
"W/o a doubt the most overhyped beer. The one regaling factor for this beer is if you're trying to not pack on carbs. Then again, you might as well drink soda, because on one occasion I killed a 12-pack of this (cans) and didn't even have to urinate. W/ so many light beers to choose from, this is a skip. Only Coors massive ad campaign for it is why we're even talking about it now."
"Average, even for a macro lager. Pours a very light straw color with no lacing, but nice head. Has a slightly sour/skunky smell to it. Decent malt taste, but nothing great, a little on the sour side. Goes down fine, with quite a bit of carbonation. Average overall for a macro. Compared to just about anything else it would be even worse."
"The mouthfeel is similar to tonic water. Thin and watery. I suppose there is a decently crisp and refreshing finish that is better then many other macros, but aside from that I would say skip it. Unless youre looking to play some drinking games, steer clear. And I swear; if a giant, frosty, silver train comes busting through my house again Im going to have some issues."
"This beer pours a pale pissy yellow with virtualy no head, smells like any other macro light beer and it tastes pretty awful...at first... but then it gets alot better, it starts our very water and leaves an awful aftertaste but if you've drank some decent brew prior to drinking the coors it tastes like water, which isn't a good tihng it just makes it really easy to get smashed... a great party beer if your looking to drink to get drunk becuase its light and doesn't feel you up and leave you bloated it just tastes crisp and clean def. cheap macro but better than bud or miller so yeah i'd drink it again"
"coors is just an average beer, i believe it is better than miller light and bud light, plus i like the fact that it is not union, and i did work in a union, so do not say i am biased, this is just an average beer, but better than the other macros, but soon to be with a macro, miller"
"This is definitely one of the great lite beers out there on the market today. Certainly a session beer, where the low alcohol percentage and few calories lets you drink up without feeling too full or bloated. I prefer it out of the bottle... Whenever I get it on tap it seems very watered-down and bland. Taste-wise, I've tried better lite beers, but this is certainly up there with some of the best. It is a definite classic and can be enjoyed with just about any food-pairing, especially good to be enjoyed with appetizers."
"The 40 oz. bottle fit entirely into my Spaten Oktoberfest mug. An insult to Spaten, yes. Appearance is terrible. Very pale yellowish gold. Virtually no head. Smells like cheap macro corn/rice/hay/earth. Tastes watery and cheap. Feels watery. This shit's no better than Milwaukee's Best Light but at least Milwaukee's Best Light has the decency to charge a fair price. Marketing promotes this beer as a premium brew that's derived from the snowy-cold mountains of Colorado, etc. It is not. Easy to drink, however. As is water..."
"D- Drinkable if you want to drink a case or 2 in a night, but otherwise terrible beer."
"When you're looking to this style, I'd go with Miller light, but I wouldn't turn it down if someone bought me one at a ball game."
"I'm honestly not convinced Coors Light is any better than Keystone, Coors' cheaper version of this brew."
"Coors Light is what it is. The one thing that bothers me about this website is that people continually tear down the big companies as awful beer. The beer is obviously nowhere near as good as a $27 Belgian, but it is what it is. That being said, compared to drinks like Miller Lite, Coors Light really isn't very good. Like Bud Light, it has very very very little taste, but is perfect for mass consumption. Basically, these beers are made for mass comsumption and they are perfect for it. If you want taste out of any of the big brand beers Miller Lite is by far and away the best option."
"Crackly, thin, watery. Very light and easy for those who like to drink water. Not too much taste, very incoherent. Would go good with shrimp,. oysters and other easy seafood since it would not burden the food. Good for a hot, sunny day at the track...car racing, horse racing, etc. But for a beer advocate, nothing at all."
"Another typical American Light beer. A very light golden color that gives of a faint smell of sweet malt and corn. As close to water as you can get in a beer, outside of Michelob Ultra. It's sweet, but that grainy corn flavor is definitely present. The mouthfeel is that of a soda, crisp and somewhat refreshing. It's easy to drink, but why bother?"
"Decent smell for this style of beer. Appearance is fairly weak. Mouthfeel is average for the style. Taste however is sub par; the head is a kind of flavorless foam if you will. Of the premium branded light beers, this is probably on the low end of the scale. I would recommend going with Miller Lite instead if your choices are limited."
"One beer that has a pale yellow color with a nice white head. Very opaque in appearance. The aroma is very weak with a slight hint of hops but overall very weak and smells of most other cheap beers. The taste is not much different. Very weak malt flavor with a hint of metal and mild hops. The nice carbonation really helps with the very bland flavor it gives. The one good thing is this beer is easy to drink alot of because of its watery flavor. As for the American Macro Light Lager, this one is probably my favorite, but that really is not saying much. It's the best of the worst."
"D: Fine for a light beer, its tasteless nature makes it easy to drink or pound, but not something I would order regularly. Editing again after trying a bottle, it just got so boring I left it half full."
"Another overhyped macro-brew. No substance, no body, no taste. Another beer for those who like to get drunk and urinate a lot, but really do not enjoy the taste of beer. About as satisfying as carbonated water. Thank God there are brewers out there that care about the quality of their product and not just the cleverness of their commercials."
"This taste like bad water with an even stranger taste, while the water in it may be mountain pure something along the way went terribly wrong...."
"Carbonation is the only thing I could detect from Coors Light. I suppose ""refreshing"" is the only thing I have to say for this beer, though that's a stretch. Goes down like water and tastes about the same. There's no reason for me to have this again."
"By the way...this was the Canadian version,made by Molson's brewery...i think the U.S. one is even weaker."
"Could drink about thirty of these if somebody wanted to, super super light beer"
"OK I'm not going to B.S. you,it's not a beer rich in flavor nor does it have great head but by no means is it disgusting.It is what it is a light macro beer.It's not something you will go out of your way to buy but on a hot summer day it tastes real good."
"The beer pours a clear yellow with a foamy head that fades immediately. Aroma is very slightly sweet grainy, but thats it. Taste is watery, dry and grainy. There is an elusive hint of malt flavor but it's very faint. Lots of carbonation and a thin mouthfeel. I know better than to let this one warm up as I've nursed a few $2 bottles at wing night, its drinkable until it warms up. Macro's certainly have their time and place, but I'm still not a big fan of the light variety."
"Final Statement: Coors Light wins. This is a non beer drinkers beer. Its definately not offensive because there is no flavour. I can't say it's bad, but it's definately not really beer."
"I drank this beer one day during a nascar race, and It really had me questioning if i was drinking beer or water. There was no distinct smell or taste associated with this beer, I never really felt like i had a beer in my mouth, it was very watery with little carbination. after drinking 7 or 8 of these i didn't really feel like i had any beers in me at all. so I would have to say they change the name from coors light to water. becuase that's about all your drinking with this stuff."
"Comment: When the choice is beer or no beer...this is still a beer."
"D- I fortunately have the last half of a Southern Tier Unearthly to make me forget the taste of this swill. I honestly can't imagine any situation where I'd find this drinkable. No redeeming qualities at all."
"It's not too rough going down but if your aim is to get drunk, then this beer has a place in the beer bong. Don't torture yourself by drinking one at a time. How this is the light version of the ""Original"" is beyond me."
"Drinkability: I COULD drink this all day long because of how weak it is and how it has no real flavour...but would I want to? If the makers of this beer wanted a drink people could drink all day w/ out feeling the effects of the alcohol or a drink that has NO flavour to more traditional drinks they did a damn good job"
"Overall: Seriously, why bother? I'm not just being mean. If your just trying to get hammered, drink a few shots or something. Maybe drink one of those flavored malt beverages, at least it has some flavor."
"Pours out light gold with decent head, and very heavy signs of carbonation. Smells very light with some hint of hops. Almost no taste except for the bitter alcohol that may follow, but for the most part very watery. It is, however, quite refreshing. Because of its lack of flavor and the fact that it's so light, it's drinkability is quite high. Overall, refreshing but not a beer-lover's beer. Not the best light beer, but not the worst."
"Drinkability: Sure, I could drink this all day long, especially on a hot summer day at the beach - but would I enjoy it? Probably not."
"Facing a fridge of macros from around the world, I committed myself to facing off the big 3 American light macros. Only two beers in, I'm struggling to tell them apart."
"coors has better products though."
"Hops? Where was it. I understand what is trying to be acheived by this beer. It just taht there is a little too much taste missing. I feel like this beer retains a very watery feel and taste. There is a bit of a tang after one or two. I almost want to say that if the flavor that is hard to find in this beer was increased by 46% it might be another story. Looks ok, smells not ok, tastes not there."
"Bottled water was $2 a bottle, this was $3 a can...if it's hot and there's a party atmosphere I'm going for a beer, even one as bland as tasteless as this one."
"Session beer, but there are far better session beers out there with similar price and availability. Not recommended."
"You know, when a beer is unimpressive, it's unimpressive. Period."
"My mom told me that when this beer wasn't available everywhere, they would have people bring it back from vacations in Colorado. Why?"
"Pours with very little head. No retention as expected. Not to much on the nose smells like a macro should slightly malty nothing intresting here. Taste is very bland and watery I am glad I never drank stuff like this, but they sure know how to market and sell there beer."
"Drinkability- Not much taste to it as most light beers. I wouldn't recommend it."
"In the big-beer light category this is my second favorite light. One big plus with Coors is the ""no-additives"" factor. Adolph Coors was a bit of a nut in regards to chemical atleration of his product. If you are seeking an inoffensive light beer with the least amount of engineering this is it. A good medium taste for an American light lager. An all-day drink. A very fine light beer."
"It is what it is, and for the style a very acceptable beer."
"That taste is gone. Maybe it is the so called ""Frost Brew Liner"". It is still a tasteless excuse for a beer but at least (for me) in the can, it is now a drinkable one. Can't speak for PBR, it hasn't been available around my parts for a while."
"Drinkability: If there is nothing else.... heck yeah.... go for it.... you can have a gazillion of these and barely feel as if you drank anything.... as it turns out.... this is the perfect beer to play beer-pong with...."
"This is an example of where good things go wrong and where people with lots of money and psychotic political affiliations can really do some crappy stuff. I mean really. I'd be hard pressed to be convinced that they buy nothing but the best mass quantity adjuncts for this not being sold on the spot market. there's got to be some sort of good quality to this, but I have no idea what it'd be."
"This is my favourite light beer, although that isn't saying much as I don't like light beer in general. The Silver bullet pours a pale yellow colour with little or no head. What aroma there is, is very weak in nature making it difficult to classify. The taste is beer-like witrh a weak aftertaste. The mouthfeel is watery with some hints of carbonation."
"If you absolutely have to get a Light Macro beer, make it this one."
""
"The can states it's ""crisp and refreshing"" Where's the crispness? Well, at least there were no major off-flavors, but it was still beer diluted with water. Coors Light has about 30% fewer calories as the Original, and now I know why; I couldn't finish the last 30% of this!"
"Appearance is a very pale yellow with a small white head that goes away. There's just nothing in the smell even the smell can be ""pale"". To much water in this beer ,it cuts the flavor taste like water a lot. I do not recomend this beer to anyone, if you want to have macro lager this is not the one."
"This is what I used to drink before I lived in Germany and got to know better. As with all American macro-brews, this is way overfiltered, and thus all possible character is lost. The only good thing I can say is it goes down easy... just like water. Unfortunately I like a lot more complexity in my beer than my water, and this has none!"
"Its only redeeming quality is how inexpensive it can be purchased from almost anywhere."
"Coors light is what it is. I'm originally from Colorado, so it has to be my ""go to"" macro when that's all there is. Ironically, it is really good to wash down Maryland crabs (eating crabs is an event in this State... you'd have to be there). And it's also great for crabs because it goes down so easily. Too easily, in fact. Nice pale ""beer"" yellow in the glass, with a quickly disappearing head. Nice bubbles on the glass that tingle through the first few sips. (Incidentally, if drunk from the can, it's about like drinking a Sprite, in terms of mouthfeel.) An interesting--even a bit addicting--fruity (banana?) hops scent and taste. I know why it's so popular. It leave you wanting more and it goes down so easily that you almost forget you're drinking beer. Until the alcohol hits you. What can I say, it's a macro. An American ""light"" macro to boot. But easily the best of the big three ""light"" macros out there. As if that meant anything. Here's something that puts Coors Light in context: Over the Memorial Day weekend, we were drinking Coors Light while waiting for the ""real"" beer to chill in the ice chest. Kind'a says it all."
"Coors light. For a lite beer its not bad. It is a suitable palate cleanser between real beers perhaps. Better that bud light, its clean with no hop or malt taste. All you really taste is bubbles and a little spicy note. Lawnmower beer. Admit it though, most of us grew up on this stuff before we awoke to the world of real beer."
"This beer sucks as far as most people on this sight are concerned. No one is going to read this review so I won't waist my time going into detail on it. But this beer does serve a purpose. Slamming C- on the beach is quite nice, and makes the fresman 15 non-existant. So, everyone knows we here on BA aren't supposed to like Coors Light, but dammit, everytime I drink this stuff I get laid so I can't totally bash it. As long as I'm shotgunning or beerbonging this stuff, it really isn't horrible"
"Drinkablity is good. Should be a fun evening."
"Not drinkable at all. I politely refused another on the grounds that I was driving."
"Coors Light is pretty easy to drink, like most light lagers are. Personally it is not my favorite of the macros but I will not refuse to drink it."
"D- Refreshing, but flavour loses it points."
"D - There really is no reason to drink this beer unless if you've been working outside all day in the blistering sun and you want the coldest thing possible in the fridge. It's not bad if you just want to replenish your body with water, but then why not just drink cold water?"
"Drinkability: Why can't people spare my palate by purchasing High Life or PBR instead of crap like this?"
"I'd only drink this if I wanted to improve my shotgunning technique without wasting any good beer."
"Yet another beer I tried at a party, only because it was available and I was curious to find out if it was worth my time. Appearance is typical and not impressive. Aroma is weak and wan. Taste seems rather watered down; I didn't feel as if I was drinking beer. Maybe I've been spoiled by craft brews and imports."
"My relationship with Coors Light has been long and heart-felt. However, those were my college years. This is definetly like any other macro-brewed beer, with little to no character. A very drinkable beer, but in a ""I just want to get slammed"" kind of way."
"Drinkability- Not a super filling beer, medium in the filling range."
"Overall, acceptable for those huge parties when most people aren't looking for taste, if you know what I mean. But personally I'll give the nod for cheap American light beer to Bud."
"ooh, a ""frost brewed"" can! god, this is as bad as bud light. your ultimate fizzy light yellow flavorless beer. i honestly can't detect any malt or hop character whatsoever. great job with the adjuncts and force carbonation though! coors, like bud and others, has achieved their goal of a completely flavorless, characterless beverage. hey, water is good when it's really cold. if you need alcohol why not just do some shots of cheap vodka? man, those are some hot chicks in the ads too!"
"This is only a bad beer if you slow down to pay attention. However, mindlessly tipping these back whilst watching the game is extraordinarily easy."
"Drinkability: Pretty easily drinkable if you're just looking to drink a large amount, goes down easy, but not great if you just want to sit around and sip a beer"
"Comes out a light pee yellow with a fingers worth of head that is lost in seconds. Smell is neutral, not the sulfery notes that I get from many other light lagers, but nothing in the nose. Taste is dominated by sweet malt- corn syruppy- no hops as far as I can taste. Goes down watery and tastes like water."
"Drinkability: Not what I would normally order, but just hanging out with some friends at a local college bar, it certainly hit the spot."
"Overall: I'll drink it when it's free, but only under protest. One of my least favorite macro beers."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: Very light bodied. Easy to drink. But, it does not taste at all good, which leaves me not wanting to drink anymore. Overall, somewhat typical for a light macro...not good."
"Light golden color with thin white head that fizzes away fast. Smell is corn syrup and rice. It actually has some flavor but it's overly sweet. Not much of any hop presence to rescue it. Pretty syrupy sweet for such a light beer. Light, overly sweet malty body. Not very refreshing for a light lager."
"All beer snobbery aside, this is still my go-to for domestic beer when out at a club that doesn't serve ""good"" beer. Compared to the other big boys like Bud Light, Miller Lite, et. al., this is by far my favorite. For all categories I rate it 3.0 - average, because that's what you'll get from Coors Light. Your average American Light Beer. Nothing more, nothing less."
"In my neverending ( at least it seems that way) quest to absorb the common macros I have yet another entry. Poured a sort of pale yellow, I said sort of as it was almost clear. Big fizzy white head faded instantly leaving a light yellow liquid filled with tons of visible carbonation. Crystal clear and thin. Smell was non existent(seeing a pattern here) and what was there was barely a bread or grain smell. Taste was refreshing when cold/ putrid when warm. By refreshing I mean like a glass of water when your hot, the taste was non existent. Nothing, maybe a light malt but overall nothing. Very thin mouthfeel, actually felt lighter then water. Overall I could see why people would drink this when its hot in the desert and they are dying of thirst, but to drink it for the taste, or enjoyement, I would pass."
"All in all not a good beer, and I would not recommend to anyone."
"What a waste of time. Low abv and no flavor, I guess you could pound 50 or so of these in a day, but why?"
"I love beers, especially imports and micros. I stay away from the macros if possible. Coor's Light IS beer- just not very good beer. I just hope folks would get a little creative and try some of greater beers out there. Bottom line- Drinkable but mindless."
"Had on tap at Beef OBradys, though I have had several times before. Typical light bodied BMC macro beer, not much on the aroma or flavor, and palate is thirst-quenching, but not much more. The only good thing about this is that at $1.50 a pint, it would make a good session beer on a hot day, if not much more was available."
"It is not awful and I am also not impressed. I drink these when offered by others and wanting to be social or on an extremely hot day when thirst needs quenching."
"D - Even though this beer is bad, I remembered it as being (somehow) a lot worse; it's a standard macro-lager that pretty much tastes like water (or donkey piss, as my Dad always said)"
"Overall: There is absolutely no point to this beer. For a light, it falls short in taste and high in calories. I compared this to a Miller Light in the same sitting. Coors has 102 calories while Miller has better taste at 96 calories and fewer carbs to boot. Id probably even take a Michelob Ultra Amber over this. Pointless diet beer. Avoid."
"Drinkability: One could drink many of these if he did not desire flavor and complexity. I found it rather tasteless and boring."
"D - Yuck. I can't see how people drink this shit everyday. Before having this, I assumed it was place poorly everwhere but drinkability and mouthfeel (anticipating water), but Coorns messed it up and actually made this an unpleasant drinking experience rather than a neutral one. It actually has a substantial amount of flavor considering that it is a light beer, but the flavor is gross. This isn't the worst beer ever made, but it might be a contender if there is ever a competition for that title."
"Drinkability, Coors Light's only redeeming trait, is fantastic on that blazing summer day when you can't find any Genny Light or Labatt Blue Light."
"Poured into a frozen mug out of my kegorator. This is perhaps the most colorless beer out there, a very pale straw color, with a small white head that dissipated very quickly. No smell what so ever. Doesn't taste as heavy on the adjuncts as other light macros, though there is that artficial sweetness to it, no real malt or hop taste to it. The drinkability is great if you wish to drink a can out of a cooler tailgating during the summer."
"IMO with All lite beers drink H2O not lite beer, why spend money on swill."
"This one pours a very light pale yellow with a white head that has no retention whatsoever, with a whispy crown in the end. The carbonation seems to dissapate quickly too. The smell is rather earthy, maybe a bit of corn and rotten feet. The taste is horrendous -- very watery and completely bland. It's starts with a hits of hoppy bitterness and goes flat in the mouth with a bit of a choke to swallow does. The mouthfeel is a bit like thinned out cola, very watery and not filling or refreshing. Sorry campers, this one goes down the drain."
"Drinkability: Undrinkable. Drain pour. This is the reason why a person would dislike beer. If you want to drink beer with less calories...buy a better beer and drink less of it."
"Tastes like rocky mountain feces - straight from the sewers of Golden Colorado. Honestly, I can't believe Pete Coors has the balls to get on TV in the pristine Colorado mountains and pretend that this beer has anything to do with our State. He a fraud and so is this beer."
"Drinkability- I looked down and was almost done, not a sipper."
"Drink-Ability: Whey would you drink this crap? Just go waste your money on the other macros out there."
"If you're looking for a light beer that will go down easy, this is a prime choice. However, keep in mind that it is a light beer, and therfore some of its qualities are lessened. Appearance is a somewhat faded amber, but it usually pour for a good head so you can embrace the aroma. Beer smell is good, but kind of malty. Tastes pretty good, for a light beer, but it doesn't give you a feeling of beer in your mouth (kind of watery). I do like it though, as a light beer. I will reach for it when available if it's the darkest there."
"Ya know, if you're drinking this for quantity you might as well go with Keystone Light, I really can't taste much of a difference at all between the two and Keystone Light you can get for much less. I'd recommend both for quantity drinking because the taste is so smooth you can easily consume mass quantities, but that's the only time I reach for a can of the Silver Bullet."
"Drinkability: good actually, good for beer pong; not good to sit down for a quality drink"
"Honestly what is the point to this. I don't know why light beers get treated this way."
"But let's not forget the positives. This beer serves a purpose and within its intended role it performs perfectly well. But here on BA, look somewhere else. Fast."
"The best thing about this beer is that you can drink about 100 and still be able to walk straight. It is very very light and very very easy to put back, so becareful, and try to focuse on the fact that it is not water, and an infinate imbiation night will probably lead to nothing good. Don't drink and review."
"Made for mass quantity drinking."
"After many years drinking Coors Light and switching in the last two years to more complex brews. I wonder what the hell was I thinking and drinking. Recently, I venture to the world of Coors Light and the experience was disappointing. No matter if it comes from a bottle, tap, or can, like many light beers, the aroma, taste, and body is not apparent. The only good think about this brew is that you can drink it all night. I quess a proper thank you to Coors Light is in place for supplying my youth with inexpensive and tasteless beer. Thank You."
"This beer poured a very light gold color with a large head that disappeared quickly. If it were any lighter in color I'd swear this was Sprite or 7-up. Aroma was fruity with a good amount of corn mixed in the nose. I could taste some malt, but it had mostly a sweet, lemony flavor along with a grainy corn taste. I could detect no hop bitterness at all. Mouthfeel was very light in the palate. The only way I could see drinking this again would be on a very hot summer day when nothing else was available. Not recommended."
"D- This is the worst of the Big Three in my opinion. If they would spend more money and make better beers than trying to repackage or remarket these, I might try it again but as it stands, BMC is dead to me. Coors Light also is like instant hangover for me. After two, I get a headache and I want to orge and I'm still at the bar."
"For what it is, it isn't all that bad. It has the same apperance and charactaristics as other Macro Light beers. However, it has a bit more flavor and is easy to drink. This type of beer is meant to be easy to drink, and it does it's job well. Overall if you are looking for a decent light beer I'd go with this one. Just don't smell it."
"Goes down like seltzer water: a fizzy concoction that will get you drunk for cheap, though if you've been drinking microbrews all day, it will probably help you sober up. As it says on the can: ""Nothing's more refreshing than an ice cold Coors Light!"" What a wonderful lager! The Silver Bullet!"
"I admitted to being slightly disappointed with the Coors Light as a poor replacement for Tsing Tao, but I could see where thirsty masses as football games might like this on hot days."
"Good stuff: it's balanced, and it's so light I could probably drink a whole case, but why would I want to? Cute little hoppy bite, definately nothing to write home about. Not really much to say here, except that I feel like I'm drinking an unsweetened Sprite. Drink only when absolutely neccessary."
"Overall, it was not as offensive as expected [not exactly a ringing endorsement]. Better than many other beers of the style. Best served ice cold since not much to taste. Of course, I wouldn't want to drink many...but could if the need arose."
"D- Well if you wanna you could drink this for a week straight. Easy to drink, but you get nothing from it."
"As far as flavor is concerned... it's honestly the best option when compared to the rest. I guess you could say it's the tallest midget, better than Bud Light or Miller Light. Remember how your mother always said ""if you don't have anything nice to say, don't say anything at all""? That's kind of what I'm doing here."
"Despite all of that, it is highly drinkable from the standpoint of being so utterly bland that it's inoffensive."
"I drank about half of it and then switched to warm Brita filtered water, which actually seemed less watery. Oh well..."
"Drinkability: it's quaffable, but so is H2O. While I prefer this to some of the higher strength macros like Bud and Fosters, it's still a forgettable mass-market nothing beer."
"Football tailgating leaves a lot to be desired for the better beer drinker so I reverted back to college days of excessive imbibition of macro funk as there was no other option except liquor and wanted to remember the game if I could. This could be easily drunk after exercise as it is ridiculously watery and devoid of taste. What taste there is consists of cereal grains, corn and other adjuncts. I imagine Adolph Coors wouldn't be thrilled to have his name associated with this swill. I can't believe how much of this stuff I used to drink. Yikes."
"Very clear golden yellow. Head dissapated quikly with no lace on top or sides. It has more um, aroma?, than taste. Mostly light grain smell plus some malt. Taste is well balanced but has some sort of off flavor. I think it comes from the water used. I taste it everytime I drink a Coors product. It's not that great but I buy a twelve pack now and again."
"First of all, to be fair, I remember having this beer in the past and it actually tasting a little better than it did when I just poured it. The smell of this beer is a very off smelling odor. I can't really pinpoint what it is. The taste is basically the same. There is absolutely no trace of any malt or hops, but there is a very off tasting bite that is not pleasant at all. Again, to be fair, maybe the can I poured this from was just a bad batch. That said, from this taste test, plus memories of the past from this brew, I can say this probably my least favorite of the macro light beers. The problem is that not only is there not even a hint of malt or hop taste to the beer, but the brew has a very off tasting bite which makes it not pleasant to drink. By the way, I am careful to always review by style, as I believe there are actually good macros out there. If you want a macro, try a Schlit, as it is light years better than this stuff."
"If you ever wanna drink a beer that tastes exactly like water then you have found it. Although a Coors Light may be refreshing on a hot summers day it is not something you want to keep as the cornerstone of your collection. I came back to this old timer after years exploring other beers. And the same holds true, the main appeal of this beer,to me, is its ability to not taste really like beer at all. It is definately a light beer in the truest sense of the word."
"Wow that new frost liner really works, I guess, I pour beer into a glass. However, first sip can't you taste the Rockie Montains? Well if you can your taste buds are way better then mine. The beer poured an unappealing light yellow that looks almost clear. The smell and taste where almost non-existant. The mouthfeel was light was felt like I was drinking spoiled water. I had to dump this beer because each sip made me cringe."
"It's easy to see why Coors Light is so popular. When cold, it's virtually tasteless (especially from the bottle) - inoffensive, and arguably refreshing, given its characteristic similarity to water. But... in the long run, I would take virtually any beer over Coors Light, and really feel bad for some of the people who truly think that it is the be all and end all of beer."
"Overall: I dont see how people could drink this shit. If they put a little flavor in it I might drink it. Water tastes better."
"Coors Light is one of the top selling beers in the world, but dont let this convince you that Coors Light sells well because of its quality. In reality, this is a poor excuse for a beer, with little or no taste and a flavor profile similar to its parent brew. Its a beer to forget."
"Coors Light has a very watery taste, with little malt or hop influence. The colour is a very light yellow, and this relates to its light flavour. This beer has so little character, one has to wonder why so many people drink it. It would seem that most drink it to be social, as they feel the need to drink something, and this is the tamest it gets."
"D - When it's free it's always drinkable. When your choices are limited to just Bud Light and Coors Light. I think I'll always grab the Coors Light."
"Overall the worst of the macros. I see no reason to pick this up in the future."
"Ended up with an 18 pack somehow. Anyways, poured it into a mug and the head fizzled like sparkling lemonade or something like that. Was completely gone in 20 seconds, left literally nothing. No ring, nothing. Yellow? PALE YELLOW...palest clear beer I've ever seen beside a Belgian white. Smell wasn't too bad, doesn't reek of corn (Miller Lite) or smell like nothing (Michelob Ultra). Taste is interesting for a mass produced, light beer. It actually has a hop bite to it. I can't tell if its some kind of acidic metallic bitterness from the new can liners WHICH IS JUST SYNTHETICALLY PAINTED ON BY THE WAY. We tried melting, scratching, and separating the liner to no avail. Its as smooth as the outer can, so I'm assuming its just bluish paint. The mouthfeel is fizzy water. The drinkability however? If these are ice, ice cold, it beats the Rodney King out of Miller Lite, no matter how much I hate Coors for donating to conservative causes and more extreme things like KKK-ish shady political campaigns in the south. The new Heineken Light has this pinned down by a sniper rifle though!"
"I had this beer in the bottle this time and I dont know there is just something I like about this beer. Its not very complex and its unexciting at best but I can drink them all night and not want to stop. Most beers like this make me tired and sick but this one seems crisper. In the end I wouldnt choose it over many of the beers out there but it is a great substitute for a glass of water."
"¡Salud!"
"When I want to drink a good beer, this is not the first thing I go for. Generally, I will work my way down a list before coming to this, but if I run into a beer list that looks like Amheuser and Coors wrote it, I will probably go with a Coors Light, or as I like to think of it, one of the lesser evils. It's piss water, let's be frank here. There's nothing to it but a little flavor and a little alcohol, but I can drink this stuff all night long and it won't bother me, it doesn't give you that nasty mouth tasts other cheap brands seem to. If you're going cheap, I guess go Coors Light."
"If you're looking for something to take out on the boat, look elsewhere. There are more drinkable swills out there for an equal or smaller price tag."
"Pours straw yellow with carbonation and small white head that will dissapear in about 5 seconds. Taste is of water flavored corn, not very tasty at all ver watered down. Smell is of maybe a bit of corn with a light hop smell. Not very good , try mixing it with a V8 to increase flavor."
"Cost and availability make this a good beer for drankin'. Refreshing enough on a hot day. Tastes like home."
"Taste the cold, HUH?? Very light, no extremly light yellow color. Smells like nothing, tastes faintly (very faintly) like beer, well if you took a semi-decent macro lager and watered it down. Overall it's easy to drink but i can't score it more than 2 for overall drinkability. Beer is supposed to have some, well substance. Coors light doesn't have any substance to it. Carbonated water with a hint of beer. Zima has more flavor than this (had, don't know if it's still around) But I couldn't give it all ones since something with no flavor is better than something that tastes nasty."
"light yellow in color, white head... everyone has seen this one. doesnt taste or smell like much, but I do find this beer to have a slightly more citrusy taste than the others like it. must be the yeast. Overall, this beer is very watery and it doesnt leave a bad aftertaste. (like BL) It is ridiculously easy to drink... only, I don't really reccomend it."
"This is not good - not even for a light beer - I tried it to see why it was popular. I tried to be objective and rate it in comparison to other light beers (though the concept still baffles me in a way)- but, it turned out to be nothing."
"Drinkability : I would have given it a 1.0, but it sorta quenched my thirst."
"Much better choices, for less money, or equal, avoid this one."
"Another no-beer from the States. What a waste!"
"Poured a very pale gold with a big white that dissapeared quite fast. The aroma was plack pepper, faintly sweet and grainy. The taste was crisp, watery and carbonated. just a slight grain taste comming through. Mouthfeel was crisp and bubbly, very thirst quenching. There's nothing offensive about this beer because there's no flavor to offend your taste buds."
"Blah. Watery and bland are two words that comes to mind after drinking one of these. I'm not sure what this was supposed to taste like, I guess I missed out on the Rocky Mountatin Flavor. Worse than Bud and Miller. This got pretty nasty towards the bottom of the glass. I'd take water over this."
"Just as most american macro brews go, this beer is quite mediocre in all ways. Simple, virtually tasteless brew, watery and weak, this beer pours ugly, tastes weak, but has a few redeeming qualities I suppose. When drinking with the guys, it's tolerable and good to get drunk on, as I rated, has a good drinkability if you plan on drinking in high quantities, and if served very cold, it finishes crisp. Overall a good tailgating beer, but shouldn't be viewed highly in any other aspect."
"Eric"
"I wouldn't pay much to drink this beer, but there is always someone offering this beer at social gatherings, so long as it is coldI guess you could do worse. Lesson here for me is, don't disparage free beer."
"According to it traits, this beer is barely medicore. However, as previously mentioned this beer holds a special position in my beer selection. The reason for this is probably entirely intentional on Coors' part. It is entirely a reproduction of my first taste of beer. The first sip of this beer always summons the recollection of my first taste of beer. The soft introduction with the slightly bitter aftertaste is reminescent of mostly fond memories. As a beer intending not to impress me, but only to remind me, this beer excels. This beer invokes images of my past and I am reticent to reject those memories. Therefore when asked what generic American beer I would prefer, I will always choose Coors. Perhaps not because of its inherent qualities but because of its ability to connect with long cherished memories."
"But yes great beer , always a good one!"
"The beer is water, it's huge advertising industry does not change that."
"A good cold Coors Light is never unwelcome for me. Sure, it is not what I think makes a beer great, far from it. It's utter blandness, carbonation, and drinkability makes sure that is also none of what I think makes a beer suck."
"This is, IMOH, the worst light BMC light beer. It lacks the taste of Miller and the crispness of Bud. In other words, there is absolutely nothing enjoyable about this beer. It pours straw yellow with a slight head that has dissipated by the time it has reached my table. There is nothing to the taste; it tastes like: bad beer. It is also a very thin body. I suppose that it is possible to drink this beer all night, but only if you desperately want a buzz or are a masochist."
"The look is so pale. The flavor is just plain non-existent. The feel was...slight fizz I guess. I suppose some find it drinkable because it's so flavorless and that's the very same reason I can't drink this stuff. The line needs to be drawn somewhere...and Coors Light doesn't even come close to that line."
"In the case of regular beer selections at the grocery store, Coors Light ranks higher than most (Bud Light, Keystone, Busch), but only someone who doesn't drink enough beer could call it their favorite beer."
"Coor's Light tastes like water to me. I know it's light beer, but it should have at least some flavor. If you like watery beers that go down easy, this beer is for you. If you like to play drinking games but get full off of beer easily, drink coor's light or keystone light. They are very very easy to chug."
"A good light beer if you want to drink more than a few. Very light on the stomach, and has an almost chocolate taste. This beer is good for taking on a fishing trip or camping. Don't expect a great beer, but it is better than most light beers out there."
"This can also be considerty beer for a party. It goes down easy and is a better choice than many others out there."
"The appearance is a light yellow. The aroma was light and smelled faintly of the malted grain. The taste was crisp and moderately carbonated with a light body and light bitterness. The mouthfeel was average and crisp. I felt that the drinkability was pretty good for this beer as it was refreshing and could easilly be followed with another round. Although I'm not one for light macro lagers, I felt that this beer was pretty good for it's style and can probably compete with beers that have a bit more body. In short, this beer doesn't have alot of taste, but makes an excellent refreshing light beer for a BBQ or a hot day."
"I hate rating products like this, but I do it occasionally because I feel it is neccessary. So many people rate macros and trash them. I think that's rediculous. What? That Miller Lite doen't have any stewed plums or raisins in the smell? It's piss yellow?! You don't say? No shit it doesn't have the attributes of a 90 minute IPA or a fine crafted Tripel or Quadruppel. It isn't supposed to. These are different products marketed toward a different crowd of folks. In the way of macros, I think Coors Lt. is easily one of the the best. It LOOKS thirst quenching. Anyone ever looked at a 8.0%abv porter or stout and thought, ""That''ll quench my thirst"".? Hell no. Coors light looks appealing when it's hotter than 400 hells and you can chug gallons of it. It isn't gonna win any contests, but it's cheap, thirst quenching, and suits the purpose it was meant for."
"Overall this bud and bud light were the beers i first choose to drink in the style. many memories with this beer, but cant say its a good one."
"This beer is awfully lackluster, and I'm not one to knock macros (I love several of them). This isn't necessarily a bad beer, just a beer that lacks a great deal of things."
"I can see I've digressed. The bottom line is that CL is a pretty undrinkable beer even for a Macro Lager. I will continue to avoid drinking this beer except for under circumstances such as the one described above."
"When it came to me it was a pale yellow color with a small head of foam and that dissipated fast into nothing. There was even a lack of carbonation bubbles through out the pint glass. Smell? I wish. I didn't get any aroma whatsoever. Sometimes I caught just a little whiff of malt. The taste and mouthfeel were all the same, light and watery. Maybe not the same, the taste was kind of grainy. I could see paying a dollar for this on draft, if there was nothing else around."
"If you're going to choose between this and Bud Light, go with Bud Light. The appearance of a Coors light is light yellow/gold with a small white head that dissipates quickly. No lacing on the glass obviously. Smell is inconsequential -- nothing really to it. Grainy. Just like the taste. Mouthfeel is OK -- smooth going down. This is the type of beer you have to have ice cold at a summer bbq with a burger or hot dog to really enjoy."
"Friends drink this sometimes and if offered will not decline. Pours clear yellow piss color. Has a very small head that does not like to stick around. Could not pick up a good whiff of the scent. Taste like... water, guess thats what a real light beer is. Mouthfeel is like carbonated water. Dont buy just drink for free."
"I was offered this last night at a local bar so just to be nice and avoid looking snobbish I accepted. A pale barely straw yellow color with nasty aromas of grains and nothing else. Taste and mouthfeel were of hard tap-water, no real taste at all just subtle disturbing chemical and organic suggestions but overall a very odd beverage. I can't imagine why people would want to drink this, even among other macros I can see some redeeming value in a few of them....this one is the worst beer i've tried making it worth a review."
"Cheers!"
"Pale straw with little head retention at all. The smell is just like any cheap adjunt beer-corny. The taste is pretty awful. It has a shit beer taste which i sorta like a bit but i mean it's still pretty bad for that. There is way too little beer taste to this. It's like water! The mouthfeel is like water as well. I have not yet drank a more watery beer. I felt like I was drinking Zima. The drinkability is low cause i can't stand drinking something this unsatisfying and gross. I gave it half a point more cause I figure if you wanted to get sloshed on this (which is probably why poeple buy it mostly) you can. It's so watery I could drink like 5 of these and feel lnothing as far as the stomach goes."
"Yes you can try this at home"
"Drinkability - Stay away. Worst cheap beer, imo."
"This pours a dull straw color with a small head that leaves quicker than you on payday.The smell sort of reminds me of vegatables cooking and not much else.The taste is like water.The Mouthfeel is too weak and watery for my blood. I drank 30 in one sitting before and had no buzz!!!"
"Pours a typical macro lager yellow from a twelve ounce bottle. Smells pretty bad, mostly tasteless. My first encounter with the silver bullet came many years ago in college. It was one of the beers of choice for mass swilling because of its lack of taste, which can only be described as watery. Okay for what it is."
"I will give it credit, of most cheap beers, like really cheap on sale beers, I would drink this over any those beers. It is refreshing, it isn't filling, it isn't expensive, it does it's job right? I mean what could you expect? I think it does its job, so for that I give it credit, and I would drink it at a party, but it's not something I'm stocking in my fridge either."
"anyway, you know the story, another horrendous light beer, possibly the worst of the bunch. quite an accomplishment."
"i dont usually bother reviewing beers that i despise, i dont really see the point, but i figured i should review at least one so i knew what it felt like to totally bash a beer . Here goes. This is a bad bad beer, colorless, flavorless odorless, much like carbon monoxide, you should try and avoid it at all costs. Mcro lagers usually benefit from being extremely cold, this one almost evaporates when extremely cold, and as it warms up , well lets just say it would be better if it did evaporate. Ill never understand why this beer is so popular, never."
"A bunch of friends left a few shitty macro lagers at my apartment, so I figured I would review them. Coors Light is the grand finale. Pours lightest of them all so far. Decent head retention and some lacing. Hardly any smell at all besides a light sulfur smell and some stale grain. Taste is very gross. At least Bud Light had the thoughtfulness to taste like nothing. There are some crisp hops at the end but that doesn't make up for the sickly tasting spoiled grain and sulfur taste. Just terrible."
"Conclusion- I think this is actually near-beer. When I worked for a minor league baseball team's food concession service, I once sold a guy a dozen pint bottles of this stuff. I kept selling because I couldn't hear him slurr or see his movements change at all. That about sums Coors Light up. Its only mildly unappealing, but it also isn't really beer. So only godawful Budwieser gets a worse rating so far. And even Bud tries to formulate something that at least parody's beer. If you drink this, order a vodka and tonic or vodka and soda next time and just admit you don't like beer. Or if you're ordering this because you've had too much to drink already or need to drive home, once again stop pretending. Do your tastebuds and body a favor and get a bottled water."
"The beer pours golden but there is no head and it does not hold or lace. The smell is not to chemical but there isn't much of a smell at all. The taste is quite watered down but there is nothing especially harsh about the taste. It is carbonated well, fairly smooth and not to oily but really watery. Overall quite easy going down for a light macro beer."
"Pours a super pale yellow, straw yellow, big white head forms but goes quickly, no lace. Smell is sweet, some minor skunk, citrus and corn. Taste is non existent, some corn sweetness, citrus and a little bit of iron. Mouthfeel is light bodied with medium carbonation. Hideous."
"Mildly better than silver bullet from a can, coors light in a bottle nevertheless remains a low quality brew. As with most of this type of standard american cheap beer, it must be served cold in order to retain any form of drinkability whatsoever. Weak and watery with a puffy, fleeting head when poured, this is purely a beer to have when there's very little else available. Hard to drink more than a couple at a time."
"This pours a pale straw color with a small head that leaves quickly.The smell is very weak and has a hint of cooked vegatables.The taste is faintly hoppy,but is more like water with a touch of beer.The m/f is light,weak and watery.I can't imagine ever trying this again."
"Great for sessions, of course. Hardly close to my favorite beer, but again, a nice respite between other beers...."
"Certainly not good, and if you've got micros around, DRINK THEM!!! But, for what it is, ain't bad, ain't bad at all."
"First of all, I do still enjoy the occasional macro. I bought a 24oz can of this tonight. The beer looks like any other macro. Light in color. The smell reminds me of many a campfire with my friends. A bunch of rowdy kids drinking whatever the one person over 21 brought or would buy for them. The taste, again, is pretty much in line with any other macro. There is just not much of a taste there. The mouthfeel is actually pretty smooth. Some Macro's are just too harsh in the mouthfeel to be consumed. This one is one of the better Macro's. The drinkability is above average for the style. Americam Macro is made to be relativaly inexpensive and drinkable. This one finds that niche well."
"This beer pours to a light yellow and a quickly dissipating head. Smell is mostly of corn adjuncts. Taste is rather bland, hints of corn in the aroma, aftertaste however is minimal. Mouthfeel is reminiscent of Soda Water. However one could easily take a 12 pack of these and easily put them back without even thinking about it. Very easy to drink, just not a very good beer."
"(Drinkability gets a ""1" because if I ever wanted more than one of these, you may as well take me out and shoot me!)"
"You've seen all the other reviews for appearnce, smell, blah blah blah. In my opinion, this is THE best tasting macro in the united states. Not just the best tasting light beer, BUT the best tasting macro. Sure, it doesn't have a strong beer taste, but when compared with bud and miller which taste less like beer and more like urine (from what i've been told that urine tastes like anyway), Coors light will always be my choice in a macro. Clean, refreshing taste. Definitely an exeption among macros."
"Drinkability: Impeccable, quantity-wise"
"man i hate it when you go to the bar late and all thats cold is coors light well it looks like beer in a bottle smells like beer in a bottle taste like watery beer in a bottle kinda sweet makes it easy to drink almost to easy to drink if you ask mebut nobody did"
"Pours a pale yellow color with a finger of head that falls to a very light coating over top of the brew. What I was expecting from a light beer. Nose is fairly sweet, almost sugary sweet, with a very light grainy character. Flavor is a little sparse. Light corn-sugary sweetness with whisps of grainy/huskyness. Feel is very light and watery. Carbonation is very active. As far as a macro light lager goes, this is my choice. It really has nothing that offends me for the style. Quite drinkable."
"Well, this is another beer, this was really difficult to drink. Why?. Because it has additives that make it really heavy in the palate, I mean, really annoying and far from being a refreshing beer. Seems like trying to get you out of beers. The colour was a little green and that speaks bad about a beer, and almost no foam."
"Reminds me of beer, sort of. But not too much."
"P.S. - This would be surely be rated higher if Pete Coors had spent 10% of last year's failed senate campaign on making this brew worthy of a second chance. Earth to Colorado..."
"a beer new in my city imported by a mcro brewery Cerveceria Cuauhtemoc, Very light in its flavor, and drinkability low in average, taste and mouthfeel good, its flavor is closer to a anheuser busch beers, without the eagle, coors light is better, its hops aroma is excellent"
"Dont drink it, its bad.. very bad for you and your loved ones!"
"I would honestly rather drink a Korean beer than this. If I were the Rocky Mountains, I'd sue the pants off Pete Coors for libel."
"Served in a frozen mug. Well, I went to my old home town of Schaller, Iowa to find it is not a beer geeks paradise. Two bars, wiith only Michelob Light, Busch Light, this, and some Bacardi cooler on tap (and Schell's 1919 Root Beer. Huh?). So I tried this. Pretty much soda water with a bit of sugar and malt flavoring. No taste at all... but thats better than tasting bad, which Ive had in a beer, so it doesnt get the absolute worst review."
"I think my girlfriend puts it best, ""MMmmmm, piss in a can. Gotta love it."""
"Pours a very pale straw color. A nice head while pouring, but it subsides immediately. The smell is really faint, and there's not much there. The taste is pretty bland. Can't taste very much hops or malt, only the faint trace of alcohol. Tastes a lot like how club soda would taste after eating a bunch of bread. The mouthfeel is bland as well. Too much carbonation. As a general beverage, this isn't so bad. A nice cold one is alright, and it's light enough so that I can really quench my thirst on this if it were a hot day. As beer, however, this is fairly disappointing."
"I imagine once winter returns, the light beers will go the way of the Dinosaur."
"12 oz bottle. Poured with a big white fizzy head. I turned my back to throw away the bottle and it was gone. Very pale straw yellow and crystal clear. Very light grainy aroma and taste. The No sweetnes. No bitterness. Water thin. Livly carbonation. By far the worst of the major American Light beers."
"Pale straw color with fine, active carbonation and very little head. Smelled of ho-hum grains with a bit of nondescript, non-sequitur fruit. Taste is similarly one of plain grain with some metallic notes but, thankfully, a bit of hop bitterness. A strangely unsatisfying mouthfeel that didn't quench my thirst, which is all I was hoping for at a baseball game on a horribly humid night. The best I can say is that it's not any worse than I expected."
"I drank this stuff a lot in college. Nothing special by any means. Poured out to a yellow color with lots of carbonation. Not much of an odor, but watery hops and malt were noted. Flavor was of the typical macro light lager, slightly more palatable thought in my opinion. I'd drink it if it was free, but I don't see myself buying this again unless I really wanna relive my college days."
"Pours very light. No head to speak of. Average light beer. Nothing great. Flavor is a bit sweet,but light. Mouthfeel is a bit fizzy,but ok. Goes down pretty easy on a warm summers day. Would'nt run out and buy a 12 pack though. I think Miller Lite is a better beer for the money."
"Considering what this is, it's really not bad. To me, it doesn't taste bad for a light beer, and it seems to have more flavor than the Bud and Miller versions. There certainly are higher quality beers out there, but when you're buying a few cases for a cookout or some other type of get-together, that better stuff can get cost-prohibitive. Like other folks I know, I save the costly micros for more intimate gatherings. Coors Light on the other hand appeals to the masses, it has a decent buzz factor, it's relatively inexpensive, and for what it is, it could taste a hell of a lot worse."
"As the label states: Insulating plastic bottle  Keeps beer colder longer. Well sure, over pouring into your hands. This stuff is just like drinkin water, but it was for a good cause!!"
"The silver bullet sucks, I can not see why people by this beer. Its watery, and I taste aluminum even in bottles. It just doesnt have much taste, and the taste it does have is bad. I would drink it if its free. I don't know why crappy beer is so popular."
"Fairly eays to drink, if it weren't for the lack of taste, and thickness. Almost like drinking water or a really bad wort. (Those of you that homebrew know what I am talking about)."
"This is definitely not my thing; it has almost no smell or taste. However, if that is what you're seeking, this would be drinkable. It is a beer made to style."
"I'm not one to hack on macro's as you'll see by my reviews of budweiser and stella...some macro's can at least hit a demo'....budwieser is good session beer but this is crap trying to be something its not...the flavor that comes out is wheat/burnt seeds/and massive forced carbonation. not for me at any time."
"No one really cares about a Coors Light review. However, where I drank this was worth mentioning. If you get the chance to go to Memphis, make sure you hit Beale street. Though the beer selections are slim, you can buy BIG ASS BEERS of BMC for a few bucks, drink them as you stroll along the street, and enjoy some Memphis jazz. It was hot and I was thirsty, what the heck, I had a great time. The last few ounces were tough to finish, however."
"pourde a very pale yellow color with large head that rapidly fell to nothing. Smell is almost non-existant, with a faint sweetness. Tste is almost like water with no hop or malt taste noticeable. Mouthfeel is wet and thirst quenching. Good spacer beer, but not for much else."
"Appearance is like Evian with a drop of yellow. No head. No lacing. The aroma contains a skunky sulfur scent that is not promising. It smells like someone showed it a picture of a hop blossom. This is one watery beer  the taste is sweet, with a hint of banana and malt, some hops, citrus and grain. I would have expected that the flavor would have made up for the lack of alcohol, but BOY was I wrong."
"Drinkability: There are definately better alternatives for the same price, I would drink if offered to me."
"As far as light American macrobrew beers go, I would rate this near the top. I am comparing it to Bud Light or Miller Light. This beer pours the same light yellow color with no head and has the same grain scent. The taste is slightly bolder, and more refreshing in my opinion. Leave a better aftertaste."
"Again, I'm trying to be objective here -- but this corn flavored soda pop seems like some kind of fortified ""Night Train"" designed to get mulletheads bombed before they pile into their 4 x 4 pickups and Trans Ams. Blech."
"Pours a very light gold color, with a head that has evaporated before I finished writing this sentance. Almost no smell to speak of. On the other hand, it has a high drinkablilty, but this is probably due to its low alcohol content. The taste of the rockies is actually rather bland and ordinary."
"Sweet floral and grainy aromas. Vibrant and very clean with a hint of dry, pale malt and a brisk and refreshing finish where a hint of hop bitters and dry, grainy character emerge. However taste is rather bland and lingures in my mouth all night making me burp on end."
"Why am i reviewing this beer??? Well it isnt often anymore that i drink macros but i happend to have one in the fridge so i went for it. The color of this beer is very very light amber. The head is thin and white. No smell at all except for corn. If you like spring water you will love this beer. It is very easy to drink considering it has next to no flavor. But I have partied with this beer a lot before so i cant forget where i started out."
"Drinkability is this beer's strong point, and it's below average. While this beer does have some mild flavour and smell, atleast they aren't gag reflex inducing. However, why drink this if you don't have to?"
"Well, a straw colored beer with high carbonation and white foam that disapeared quickly. No retention, no lacing. Smells like vegetables and grain--faintly. No hop aroma. A bit sour. Tastes the same as it smells. Faint grain and adjuncts yeilds vegetable flavors of corn and rice. Maybe a bit of hops for balance. No finish. No aftertaste. Body is weak and neutral. A bit acidic, sour, metalic, and thin. Not much to say about the beer, there's just not a lot there."
"The aroma was semi-sweet and grass. The taste was bland. A sweet overtone of grain and grass with a hint of metal (from the can maybe). A slight mild hop adds alittle tartness at the finish for the mouthfeel. It is drinkable, but way to watery with a weak body. It dose not hold up to its massive adds and its popularity."
"It's not the greatest example of a light lager, but not the worst either. It's somewhere in the lower-middle of the category. If it's there, go for it, but it's probably not worth buying a lot of it."
"I'll give it an extra .5 because I like the bottle label. It doesn't look half bad if not a bit light on the pour. It certainly held a bleached white head and laced well enough. Nothing offensive on the nose but didn't smell of anything distinctive, maybe something a bit soapy. Overly carbonated for the lack of taste perhaps trying to distract you. And it bothered the sin out of my stomach after three beers, wouldn't consider it drinkable after that."
"Drinkability: Good if you can drink them fast."
"Picked this up at an office party and saw I hadn't reviewed it yet, so what the heck. Coors was the first beer I ever tasted, when I was 10 or so, and was a major influence on my early opinion that beer was not worth drinking. For that crime alone, they should pay."
"Drinkability: Pretty good if you just finished mowing the lawn on a 90 degree day and are feeling a bit dehydrated."
"I rank this low but not bottom only because there are worse beers. I would rather drink this than bud light, busch light, natural light, and several other lights. This beer is not so bad through a funnel, but as for drinking purposes its only good for really hot days and out of all other choices in the cooler. It does seem to get colder than other beers and if you are fishing or something similar in the heat its not so bad, goes down quick, but as far as drinking for taste or even a ""buzz", this isn't the beer to do it with, but neither are those that I listed above...It is a mild corn-ish flavor and very watery. Smell is almost non-detectable."
"I have rarely been more ready for a MacSmack to end than I am today. These are two of the worst beers that I've ever had the displeasure to consume. Still though, there are degrees of badness, as the Macro Smackdown series never fails to demonstrate. Coors Light is lousy, plain and simple. The boys from Golden can use whatever flashy marketing slogans they wish, ""Silver Bullet", ""cold tasting", it's all smoke and mirrors to obscure the fact that this stuff sucks Rocky Mountain oysters."
"The only reason this one is better than Coors is because there is no taste and there is no smell. There is also no worthwhile head or color. This thing is thin on all fronts and the only thing going for it is that if you are thirsty, you can drink it fast because it is barely more than water in consistensy. It really isn't worth your time if you want something that tastes like beer."
"What in the hell are those Golden, Co. folks up to? The Coors products I've tasted are simply unacceptable. This beer itself may be the worst beer I've sampled."
"Drinkable beer bong style, otherwise, not suited for sipping."
"The Silver Bullet. A crappy looking beer, it pours the normal golden color of just about any macro beer around, looks very flat and watery. The smells are faint, although I notice some malt character. The taste is unimpressive. Not bad tasting by any means, but there's just not much to it. Quite boring. Mabye a little to watery. The mouthfeel is thin, but I wouldnt have really expected anything else. Very drinkable and quite easy to consume mass quantities. This is not a bad beer for a summer afternoon grill-out... if its free."
"A thin, watery amber color. A brief, foamy white head that leaves NO lace. As for the aroma, its weird because even though there is so little to pick out, its still somehow bad. As for the flavor...well, there isnt any really, except for a very, very faint grain flavor. Mouthfeel is watery with very little carbonation. Avoid this one."
"Very light bodied, not complex at all. I'll give it points for drinkability because it's very watery and easy to drink."
"That's about it for Coors Light."
"Special Note: This beer is the only beer I've ever had that actually quenched my thirst like a nice glass of water would have."
"I have successfully avoided drinking this beer for several years. However, since it was readily available at an office party, I decided to give it a go. I was surprised at the lack of total disgustingness, I was expecting much worse. Perhaps it was due to the bottle instead of the can? Pours light-amber like diluted piss, decent carbonation, no head. Smells of skunk, alcohol, I suppose a little bit of wheatness crept in there, maybe it was my imagination. Taste was less skunky than I had expected, tastes like a beer with seltzer in it. Mouthfeel? hah. Drinkable, well I'd rather have this than Busch light, but is that really something to be proud of?"
"How low can a beer Advocate go? this is pretty much the bottom. Tried a can I took home a month or two ago from a party. (hey, at least I didnt have topay for this backwash) Pours very light yellow, very clear, very white head, which quickly departs. Slight sugary nose. Too watery. No flavor, no hops no malt. Besides those obvious problems its great stuff."
"Drinkability: Sure I could drink a lot of these if I had too, but I dont think Id ever want to."
"Tap the motherf#%^in' Rockies, indeed!"
"I am very disappointed in some of the reviews of this beer made by the top reviewers. They disparage the people who give high ratings to these types of beers, as they are non-discriptive of the beers, however their reviews are no more helpful. Merely commenting on the beer's naming, or as waste is not an intelligent or helpful review."
"If you need something that you can drink all night this is the beer to choose. I wil generally start with a few good beers and end on the Silver bullet, as me and my friends say its like making love in a canoe... its f%@*@! close to water! There is nothing special with the flavor but damn I can put these things back fast!"
"Pours out a pale straw color tons of carbonation.Has that shit smell that i cant stand coors light for {actually smells like puke}.Taste is pretty pale no actual ingredient i can taste,but,not horrible.I can drink a couple of these and not be disgusted.No mouthfeel. if its at a party or if its free , F it ,ill drink it."
"Bender: As majors go, this one is not offensive, I see how the ladies like it."
"It poured a pale yellow color with a head that faded from existance quickly. I cant really smell anything, maybe... some malt? It could just be left overs from the beer I had before. The taste... well, was not too impressive. The flavor was just not there, it was quite bland, to say the least. I have ho idea how Coors sells so much of this stuff."
"Certainly not for a beer purist but there is a time and place for this beer....for example perhaps after running a marathon on the surface of the sun this little baby might slide down very nicely....or to the lesser extreme after a hard workout at the gym....more water like than beer like but I don't find it horrid.."
"Tasted: 12/02/04"
"Well I am surprised that I have not posed a review of Coors Light before but I guess I am bored tonight. Had a few today while out at a dive bar with some friends watching the Dolphins/49rs game. Bad beer, bad game! Brew pours to a very pale yellow clear color with a good sized white head that just disappears leaving no lacing. The aroma is bland, nothing exciting going on here. Basic malt aroma that is hard to notice, hop aroma . . . yeah right! The taste is very bland as well and what flavor it does have is not overly enjoyable. Beyond that, there is not much else to write about on this beer."
"Brewed in Canada under license of Coors by Molson. Have a couple friends who only drink this, so when you go to their house this is the only option. Pale, watered down yellow color. Very little carbonation left after the pour. The smell that comes off of this is very sour. Little or no flavor, other than a metalic aftertaste and more grainy sourness. What else can you say? Another mass produced product with a huge marketing budget. Best served ice cold. Can't see myself spending money on this watered down beer."
"Overall: Not too bad for what it is, easily drinkable, inexpensive, surprisingly solid. Nothing more than that."
"Drinkability: You could drink a case of this stuff, with little to no effort. It's essentially flavored water & alcohol."
"The next time I'm at a party and this is the only thing being served, I will VOLUNTEER to be the designated driver."
"tap the sewers? yuck this was bad. how can you mix a watery and a skunky taste? coors did it. like out of date water, thats been taken from the sewers of new york.worse than bud light because bud light tastes like bottled water, i would rather have bottled water than sewer water,"
"For the beginner I would at least recommend BUD."
"Thirst quenching? Stick to water."
"The beer pours from the 12-ounce brown bottle a luminous gold color with the head modest in size and white in color, the texture frothy, with the residual lace a thin sheet to conceal the glass. Nose is sweet malt, crisp and clean with the start lightly sweet and the top thin in feel. Finish is perky in acidity, the hops apropos to the style, dry aftertaste, what can you say it is what it is, not a bad beer, just mass produce at the lowest cost possible."
"Well, the other night I was drinking with a few of my less-enlightened friend. I had a few bombers of my favorite, Stone IPA, but my brother had foolishly set the refridgerator so low that the beer somewhat froze. As I waited for over an hour for the beer to completely liquify, I grew impatient and asked my buddy Sean for a beer. It was a choice of either Coors Light or Bud Light, and I, of course, took the Coors Light. I opened the can, and the light, airy smell drifted towards my nose. As I detected the scent, I asked myself one question: Why, God, why would anyone brew, much less DRINK, this beer!? I don't quite know what it tasted like, because there was so little to taste. The thing was horribly pale in color, and smelled just how it tasted: with less malt than one would find in chocolate milk shake. Are there even hops in there? I couldn't find 'em. It did manage a mighty 2 in the mouthfeel category, because of its cool smoothness combined with a mild amount of carbonation. The drinkability is non-existent, as the beer made me nauseous. Thankfully, my first bomber of IPA was ready for consumption 15 minutes later, and my palate was saved."
"Anyhow, if you're looking to lure children into your basement, then this is the beer for you. Completely inoffensive, and smooth as silk."
"Not a bad beer for the price. Not a good beer for the price, either, though."
"Looking back, Coors Light was the first legal beer I ever had, and years before, possibly the first beer I ever had period. It's so watered-down, and I thought that was what beer was supposed to tasted like. Anyway, I don't turn down beer regardless of what it is, so I'll keep drinking this as it is a staple of some of my relatives. The color is a really pale yellow, and I find it tastes best when I'm drinking it and a bottle of water at the same time, so that I can forget it's beer at all and pretend I'm just drinking water. Or mixed with V8 so I can pretend I'm just drinking V8..."
"BA tells you to always write something critically informative about a beer, so I will start with my thesis and then elaborate on it. Quite simply put, this is the worst beer I've ever tasted. It pours a terribly pale yellow with tons of rapidly receding foam head. The smell was mostly corn, as is the taste, which has so much starchy sweetness from whatever they put in it that it has actually succeeded in being the only beer that triggers my gag reflex. So why did i drink this? Because this is what gets served at house parties where people dont have lots of money and need beer to play some beiruit. Seeing as how this is the only beer that has consistently made me choke every time I drink it, I cannot give it more than a 1 for any single aspect of it. But hey, its cheap..."
"flavor not well balanced. some bitterness at the start that lingers much longer than needed, and finishing with a mouth puckering aftertaste."
"I fully recognize the fact that Coors Light isn't a great beer, or probably even a good beer, but its still a beer that I really enjoy. I practically grew up drinking Coors Light, and have found it to be a reliable, easy-to-drink kind of beer. The aroma and appearence are fairly less than average, and the taste is even slightly below average. Still, an ice cold Coors Light always goes down easy and has a high level of drinkability. For me Coors Light is the perfect cheap macrobrew to beat the heat in the summer."
"Drinkability - a standard for the macro crowd, I've had plenty of these pre-BA. I can still enjoy them in the right setting, I just don't as often."
"Coors Light has been getting hammered by fellow advocates and I think it's because we're missing the true reason for this brew. Sure Coors Light is by no stretch of the imagination a ""good"" beer; but that's not what it's all about. It's not a beer for the middle aged, Guinness drinking connoisseur, this is a beginner beer. A lackluster brew for that high school kid just entering the world of beer. A brew for fifteen year old Johnny who's just a double duece away from getting to second base with Suzie down the street. That's who this beer is for. So while many beers are mediocre and bland, at least the Silver Bullet serves a purpose in being so."
"The fact that this beer is so popular is irrefutable proof that you should never underestimate the power of stupid people in large numbers. God save our planet."
"Mouthfeel is thin. The zippy carbonation is about the best aspect of the beer. Drinkability is easy enough, but for me, I will never subject myself to this beer again."
"It's pretty much water. At least it isn't full of bad flavor, and I can definitely say that I've had worse."
"--Joey"
"This beer can best be used in place of water when they run out of it at a beer festival. It poured a bright yellow with nearly no head at all. The aroma was pretty much non-existant. The taste followed suit and resembled carbonated water more than anything else. If I was suffering from severe dehydration, I still wouldn't have another one of these!"
"1 out of 5 swills."
"I don't understand why this bloody beer remains very popular among the masses of America. Everything you can think that is wrong with beer is in Coors Light. The appearance looks like a urine sample; actually, a urine sample has more colour than a Coors Light. The smell is non-existant. The taste lacks flavor and it is very watery. Finally, you could pound down numerous cans, because it is easy to drink. If you don't want beer poop in the morning, then don't drink Coors Light. Argh!"
"What can i say its the worst beer i've ever had for me its the lowest of the lows and it saddens me for it to be one of the highest selling beers in the country. It pours a pale straw yellow. Tastes like water and some malt. Smells like water (nothing) and overall its just a beer made for college students."
"Drinkable, but not good, there really are no good light beers."
"Notes: This whole, ""It's good on a hott day"" crap is driving me crazy. It's good becaue it's like water, period...it isnt good beer. The guys at Coors are making millions on this junk....what is the world coming to?"
"A light straw gold beer with a thin white head. A light smell of yeast and malt. The taste is lightly yeasty with some malt and fruitieness. A nice light beer. This is a real standby, while I would rather have a Blue Moon or a Coors, given the option of Bud or something similar a Coors Light will do."
"Coors light is not a bad light beer. It is very drinkable manly because it tastes like water, you can pop alot of these anytime of the day. It is very drinkable. The look of this beer is colorless with hints of yellow, no smell and really no head to speak of. The smell, isn't awful because there isn't really a smell. The taste is like a refreshing water on a hot day but is that what we want in our beer. Taste some hop but not much. Coors Light is not the light beer commercials will have you believe. Pass on this, if you need a light beer try Miller Lite. At least it tastes somewhat like beer."
"Well, my dad gave me a 30 pack of this, and I am not one to look a gift horse in the mouth. What can I say about this brew that hasn't already been written. I drank from the can, ice cold. I know what this beer looks like, pale, thin yellow with a minute head. Smell is neither enticing, nor offensive, mildly sweet, with no hop aroma. Taste, well theres a reason I drank it ice cold, to dull the taste. It is a macro with adjunct, rice and a tiny bit of amlt flavor, finishes dry, do there must be a hop in there, but not enough to add enjoyment. It is not too too terrible to pound down a few as a quencher because there is nothing there to offend."
"I suppose this isnt quite as bad as I expected..if pressed I could drink this at a family BBQ ..just 2 or 3 though."
"Words cannot describe my utter dislike for this brew. If this were the only beer available at a party, I would rather not drink. The taste is awful, the appearance is as close to club soda as you can get, the mouthfeel is awfully sour, and drinkability next to impossible. A true macro crap beer."
"Far too much carbonation, and too little flavour"
"Cheers"
"Come on. It's called the Silver Bullet. Any beer that has a nick name, ie. Natty Ice, Silver Bullet can't be good. The one redeeming quality that this beer has is that fact that it has alcohol in it. After downing about 3 good beers this beer is tollerable to keep the night going. That's about all it's good for. Oh, and maybe getting back from some sort of physical event like running or biking, it's good to rehydrate with. Very much like water."
"This beer was something that I refused in college when I didn't know that much about beer. Today, I won't refuse it, but I won't choose it. Why is that? Well, it is a great example of an American Macro Light Lager. A ton of people love it and drink it daily. It is consistently brewed and always fresh. The beer reeks of corn and the taste is all adjunct as well. But it is clean, smooth and absolutely drinkable. Nothing like the beers that I normally drink but definitely serves a purpose. You can sense a hint of hops from time to time but they are a focus of the beer. Don't seek it out, but accept the fact that it is one of the most popular beers in the country."
"Super advertising on the 24 ounce can - silver and gold, some black accents, this one being a commemorative Super Bowl XXVIII collector's item - wait, this isn't part of the rating. Medium yellow hue, zero head, beady carbonation. Has a weak, perfume like aroma. Up front, thin and weak bodied, has very little hop or malt flavoring, maybe some faint grainy/grassy notes which should be illegal for beer. No body, no character, and call it no taste, I feel sorry for those who drink this on a regular basis."
"The silver bullet... Comes in a brown bottle, which is the what I drank it from. Smells lightly oof malt, and a little adjunct. Taste is not very offensive, but there is almost nothing to it. No complexity, no hops kick, nothing. Just another macro, IMO."
"I remember when 'The Silver Bullet"" made its debut in my local LCBO (Liquor Control Board of Ontario) store back in the mid '80s. I remember thinking, ""Wow! Such a flashy can! So this is American beer! How exotic!"" Ah, the folly of youth."
"Like all massed produced light beers. Appearance was as if my dog....nevermind. Smell well thankfully there wasnt much smell there. Taste had a little bit of a bitterness and maybe some malt to it not much else. No mouthfeel. Very easy to drink since its like drinking water."
"Widely available in Canada. Had it because it was the most drinkable of non drinkable beers at a Shalom Zachor, a Friday night gathering after a baby is born in Judaism, where traditionally beer is served. Agree its carbonated tonic water with a little beer taste."
"Yes, it is drinkable, as mass-produced light beers go. My brother-in-law always has it around, and when we're out in the sun by the pool and I didn't bring my own, well, I'll confess I've been known to knock a few back. And even if I'm not impressed, I seldom actively regret it."
"Thx"
"I didn't want to review such crappy beers but I feel it's my duty to report the bad beers along with the good ones. Coors Light is definitely the Worst one!"
"Lackluster color, just barely yellow. No head to speak of. The carbonation is large-bubbled and very like drinking a coke. Not too sweet flavor and a little more bitter in the finish than Miller Lite. Nothing here is offensive though. I didn't mention the aroma because it doesn't have one to speak of."
"I should have followed my instincts and brought along a sixer of Bell's or Three Floyds. I didn't and my palate paid the price. Considering the other options were Corona Extra and some malternative, C.L. was the least of the three evils. Next time I'll just drink water."
"So, to answer the question, yes it does get better from here. Much much better, but, when out in Okarche, Oklahoma, God I hope I spelled Okarche right, and you're eatin' fried chicken, Coors Light might be all that's available. I think they had some miller products, and I know they had bud, but really, out of those, I'll take a coors light any day of the week."
"Appearance was yellow water. Smell was bland and flat... Taste the same. Mouthfeel and drinkability... you can drink lots of these bastards."
"Mass produced tripe. I pretty much will only drink this stuff when someone offers you a beer at their house.. Very pale and yellowish. Not much head unless you try to pour it sloppy. I have found that you can drink it hot and it doesn't taste that much worse than when its cold. Good for boiling brats in, and buying in bulk for parties in the summer."
" Although I find the aroma to be quite pleasing, the taste ruins it. Not an enjoyable beer for me."
"- I first reviewed this beer 28JUN03, this post reflects notes in that review. -"
"A very very mild and shallow flavor- yes theres a hint of malt and hops. Fizz. Coors doesnt state the alcohol percentage. I suspect its quite light. I will say this-- on ice with some club soda or just soda water this beer will give a mild flavor-- something different to the conventional fruity flavored water."
"oh the silver bullet. how i loathe your horrible commercials. i wouldnt touch you, but you came in a raiders can and i had to have you. pours bright pale yellow, smells like typical cheap beer, tastes metallic and slightly sweet with lots of carbonation. it is what it is, light cheap beer. im sure you didnt know that so consider yourself enlightened."
"Notes: In terms of calories and price, what can be said? Poor, off-putting beer."
"If you like it, good for you. A body does need liquid refreshment. At times, this may even be cheaper than Evian to drink, I'm sure. But before I'll ever drink it again, you'll have to put a ""silver bullet"" in the back of my head... and then you would have to wedge my mouth open."
"Very pale gold color, medium head. Aroma is very slight and kind of grainy. Very little malts, nearly no hops. Very light taste, nearly no taste at all. IS it really beer? Mouthfeel is thin. Finish is clean Aftertaste is nearly neutral. Is this even beer? More like a beer flavored water."
"For the BJCP style American Light Lager - this is around the 4.2 / 5; its nice and dry, with a touch of hop bitterness as desired, but its hurt by the odd aroma."
"Thank you, Coors light...for making Budweiser look almost drinkable in comparison!"
"The only thing more watery than this beer is Keystone Light. Lots of Rocky Mountain ice here. Not much else. Maybe a twinge a grainy dryness. If you need a thirst quencher here you go. And don't try to taste it. This is a good one for playing drinking games with!"
"This is not beer, this water and corn syrup with a light alcohol taste included. No aroma, no afertaste and hell, even no taste at all. This is the perfect beer for non-beer drinker. I blame this beer for making it hard to convince people to try to drink something different since this is so light and therefore every other beers seems ""too strong""."
"I can't believe it, but I actually like this beer. It must be my favourite of the big-name American macros. Wow. It's surprisingly drinkable."
"This brew poured a small quickly disappearing head of fine white bubbles. It has a transparent weak urine yellow body. It has little to no aroma. Its flavor that is slightly hoppy with an initially fizzy mouthfeel that soon fades. The best thing about it is that you can get it anywhere."
"Drinkibility - dull"
"I could drink this all night. It tastes okay, it doesn't look good but the taste is okay. It is better than some light beers I have had. This is my second favorite light beer next to Sam Adams Light. It wasn't that watery. There may have been too much carbonation. A decent beer by Coors, I liked their Irish Red Better."
"' didn't hate this beer as much as I would have like, but there also ""isn't any there there."" Has a thirst quenching quality, but it's mostly made for quick drinking (and quick drinking youth on the prowl believing drinking this will somehow make a difference). Drink it fast before it turns nasty. I can imagine gatherings with lots and lots of half drank beers. Maybe that's how they sell so much."
"Well, like most other reviews on this one, what is left to say? No serious beer drinker would even be looking at this review, so I am wasting my time reviewing it, actually. If you really want to know my feelings, if I could give a zero to this beer in the taste, mouthfeel and drinkablility fields, I would.... BLECH!"
"Just awful. One of those beers that deserve to only be drunk from cans, in order to protect innocent glassware. Mouthfeel like water. Very little taste. In short, the perfect beer for those who want to drink 12 odd beers during the course of the evening."
"This is a horrible beer. It is not even beer. Have it ice cold on a summer afternoon and it will go down like water. Less than a beer for the masses. A new low."
"Coors Light has to be one of the most watered down and flavorless beers out there. It goes down easy, because there's nothing to it."
"This beer poured a clear bright yellow with a fine fluffy white head. The bubbles ascended through the beer until the very last gulp. I would say this was as close to advertisement perfect as a beer can get. Too bad I had to drink it and spoil the moment. The beer had no aroma even with such a nice head. The aroma was matched by the flavor - nill. There was some carbonation in the beer that provided some mouthfeel, but Light described the mouthfeel. Not drinkable except in an emergency."
"First of all, light beers are no good! Coors light has a decent flavor compared to Miller Light and Bud Light. It doesn't pour good and doesn't have a head. Ok, maybe for a few seconds. The taste is sweet, almost fruity, and the hops tickle the tongue. One of the few light beers I can sit and drink all night. Its not that great though, and their are many beers the same price as Coors Light that I could recommend."
"This hyper-marketed beer poured a light, pale amber color with a small head. I blinked, and it disappeared. No lacing, and nothing remotely close to mentionable in the appearance. There was very little smell, just faint, stale whisps of malt and corn. The taste was grainy, somewhat sweer with light-corn features. Barely palatable. The seltzer-water mouthfeel was uminmpressive, although I suppose it felt interesting when I vigorously swished it in my mouth. Hey, I needed some entertainment while drinking this one. Overall, Coors Light is one of the worst beers I've had. It delivers a bit of alcohol quickly, and goes down painlessly, but these are its only qualities."
"simply put: yet another boring, watery macro brew. nothing daring. pours a watered down yellow. there's barely any sort of smell here...maybe a hint of maltiness every now and again. it tastes like someone dumped their coors original in my water, which is exactly how this one goes down...like water. very easy to drink as there's not much going on, but at the same time it's a far from enjoyable experience."
"Coors Light is probably one of the best light beers around today. There is just something about the ""Silver Bullet"" that can't be beat by other light beers. Definitely prefer the bottle over the can, just a psychological thing I guess. Recommend Coors Light to anyone."
"Uch. Canned Coors light, for some odd reasons, reminds me of creamed corn. Really pale colour. Clear sky yellow. Smelled of chemical water. Do they brew this at a nuclear plant? Tasted like watered down beer. Very watered down beer. As in one bottle Budweiser, 2 litres Aquafina. Very thin, paper thin mouthfeel. Weak. Yes, this could be highly drinkable, but why? Switch to something better or get water and mix some vodka in it if you want an alcoholic beverage. Or just drink water. Do not try."
"F"
"flavor in my mouth."
"With all due respect to my American cousins (to whom we owe great cultural and historical debts), what's with the Silver Bullet? And can we lend you something equally noxious? Like maybe Molson's Canadian Light?"
"Like the previous reviewer said, the only redeemable qualitly of this beer is it's poundablility. This has been a staple in the beer bongs of parties I have attended over the years, and after actually trying one for real I know why. No one in their right mind would want to drink this swill over all the other great beers out there right now. It pours a thin golden color with a thin white head. Has almost no smell other than carbonation and tastes like carbonated water. The only time I would conciter drinkind this would be if I really wanted to get drunk and it was free....on second thoutght, not even then. A horrible brew and even more proof that light=bad."
"This is pale yellow in color with very little head that quickly disappears. Hardly any aroma, lots of carbonation. A little more flavor than water which makes it go down really easy. This a beer that you can use to shotgun or chug when partying hard and not drinking beer for the taste or enjoyment."
"The king of lites is just an easy going macro offering to fill the fridge with beverage. Light yellow with a forced white head that's outta there quickly. The taste is malt with very light hopping and no offensive characteristics except its thin nature. Watery with very little for the mouth to feel. Miller-like and definitely better than Bud."
"I asked myself, ""Should I even review this and let it out that I even drink this stuff?"" I decided that I should, if only to remind myself of the true meaning of quality beer, and the importance of the entire experience. Clear, golden color with a bubbly, foamy white head (something I remember dreading while filling up at a keg in highschool). Watery of course, yet still balanced and not overly bitter. Not bad, but this mass-produced, mass-directed, and profit-minded brew is just everything it is made to be, and most of what I look to avoid."
"Attempting to be gold, but falls short and lands at yellow fizzy with all of the artificial carbonation the white head dissipates very quickly. This is the Silver Bullet, the ""good stuff"" to most people my age, and the reason why most people my age don't like the taste of beer. Corn and rice sweetness mixed with some off aromas of chemical origin. The flavor is as close to an artificial beer as it can get. They try to produce malt and hops, but this beer is more like a can of soda than a beer. Light body, high capacity, and not enjoyable. Taste the Rockies, well for me never again in this life time."
"There are always these for the taking at my Weekly fri. card games. So when Im done my beer I decided to grab one last week. Pours a clear, bright pale yellow color with not much head at all. On the nose the aroma is fairly clean. On the palate the flavor (what flavor there is) is slighty bitter, nice sweetness as it warms, very light lemon character, and light graininess."
"Credit where credit is due, I like their ads during the football game, hey, who doesn't like those twins? But this tasteless beer is a waste of time and money. No taste, no smell, no point to it, just expensive water and you can buy better bottled water, cheaper. A bad macrolight, useful only for putting out fires in ashtrays."
" Not much to taste, or smell, but it's a great party beer that can be drank in massive quantities without too many digestive problems the next day."
"It's that bad."
"Straw gold color with a quarter-inch off-white head that resembles soap lather. Quite aggressive carbonation with streams of large bubbles sustains the head quite well. Aroma is slightly sweet with faint, washed-out hops and the slightest hint of skunk. Tasting yields a slight sting of carbonation, less than expected considering the furious activity in the glass, followed by slightly sweet flavors and some weak hop bitterness and lingering metallic flavors at the back of the tongue. Mouthfeel is very watery. A remarkably insubstantial beer."
"I can't believe I am reviewing Coors Light, more unbelievable than that is the fact that I am reviewing it from my desk at work. The Christmas party justed ended, and I am waiting for the whistle to blow. Pours a clear yellow color, mild light taste with no bitterness to speak of. Nothing to dislike really, but nothing to really like. I should have brought in my own beer."
"This Coors light that I downed was in draught form and brewed under licence in Canada. It had a much fuller body than I had anticipated, medium golden in colour, well balanced with low carbonation. There was a very light head, and no after taste. I enjoyed it."
"          ""I do like the nice shiney can"""
"Edit - this review was written when the ""overall"" rating was called ""drinkability."" I have not changed my score for this, but in no way do I feel that this beer merits a 3.5 ""overall."""
"This is worst than regular Coors. Regular Coors tasted like Panther Piss, but this is watered down Delta water that was filtered through a funnel of potable water. How could anyone drink this? Taste buds must be shot to hell!"
"2) Tastes great when it is given away free. (As long as the food that you are eating hides most of it)"
"First of all this stuff has no character, but for one reason or another my friends still drink it. The color is pale yellow.  NO and I do mean no carbonation, might as well be drinking water.  The flavor is about the same, stagnant pond water.  There is little aroma, and no head.  Why bother, the label is even ugly!"
"I can't think of a beer I dislike more.  It truly tastes like bitter piss water.  I made the mistake of drinking this at a Tex Ranger's game and have regretted it since.  Please, don't claim to be a member of this site and drink this...beer (not even worthy of the name.)"
"This beer isn't that bad for a light American-style lager. It has a pleasant color with virtually no aroma to speak of. It does have some light bitterness, very light, but it drinks very easily. The mouthfeel was actually better than many other light beers, and it doesn't seem to have the annoying aftertaste of many macros. It is a good refreshing beer to drink when you're dripping with sweat after cutting the lawn, and a couple of my neighbors rarely drink anything but Coors light, as they find it to be extremely easy to drink a handful at a time. Not my favorite style beer, but not bad for what it is, a light macro."
"Well you know, cheap and easy to drink but not a great tasting beer.  Light body, no head, plenty of corn and rice though.  For cheap shit it works.  I will have on hand for my friends that do appricate the good stuff."
"While attending a wedding, it seemed that the only beer served was one for the masses. It was hot and I needed something cold wet to cure my parchness so I decided to have a cup of this. Very thin yellowish color in which I could read the embossed logo on the bottom of the cup. The aroma wasn't anything to brag about. The taste was reasonable, but I think being parched on a humid day helped make it drinkable. Not something I'd pay money for (for myself anyway)."
"A light Beer with appeal to the masses and done well for what it is. There is not a lot going on here to embellish so if your drinking this Beer because you like it, then enjoy, you could be doing worse."
"Color is a very pale yellow, one of the lightest. White head does not last long at all. The body and mouthfeel are both thin. Clean malt aroma and flavor. I agree with the ads, the only thing that sets Coors apart from the other wretched light beers is the water, which makes it crisp and refreshing. Very easy to drink, but why bother."
"Clear, very pale yellowish color - one of the lightest of the lights! The fluffy, bright white head dies immediately. The body is thin. The mouthfeel is also thin, but with a gentle caress of fine bubbles from a fair amount of carbonation. Very clean, slight malt aroma. Clean, light malt flavor. Light and brief. What it lacks in flavor, it makes up for in lack of color! (That's a joke). Somewhat refreshing. At least it's somewhat something!"
"oddly enough, this one was even worse out of the keg. an odor that almost made me throw it away started it off, then a skunky bitter taste with a whole lot of carbonation on the way down. it is sure a good thing i had some good brews with me, and i didn't have to fight coors lite down all night"
"One of the lightest, Light Beers on the market. Pale, sickly gold hue, white head, no lace. Undistinguishable nose beyond the light grainy-husk, sweet. Ditto on the palate watery. Polluted with adjuncts. Undrinkable and unnecessary, far too many better Light beers (is than an oxymoron?) can be had. Pass on Coors Light the next time you see it. This is nothing a BA would drink often I mean ever!"
"I had this beer over the recent holiday weekend.  I don't think I've tasted it in many years.  It's a pale, clear straw color with a shallow head.  No aroma.  No beer flavors at all.  Very watery.  A miserable beer."
"I guess if you held a gun to my head and made me choose an American Lite, this would be it. I mean if Sam Adams stopped making theirs. I agree that this is a good chick beer."
"Much like any other light beer, it serves a purpose...and what that purpose is, I have no idea.  This is not too terribly undrinkable, but the aroma and appearance as well as flavor leave a bit to be desired.  Worth the pain to drink if you are calorie-conscious."
"Ahh. The legendary Silver Bullet. There are so many nasty things I could say but I don't want to be crude (at least not right now!). This is not a beer. It is so bad that if the drafters of the Rheinheitsgebot had nuclear capability, Golden Colorado would be one huge radioactive crater. Weak, adjuncty, apple-juicy tasting underhopped, and generally insipid. As a ""water beverage"" it is very nice: it actually kinda tastes a bit like beer."
"What the hell is with this beer??  Light almost waterlike color.  Almost no smell. Smells like seltzer water, with a cooked veggie characteristic that transfers to the taste.  Spritzy and watery with a strong sweet adjunct funk. After drinking some Munchen Helles all weekend and then drinking this, I had to dump it out. Instead of drinking this, just drink water."
"Free at golf tournament today........I probably have had hundreds of these over the years, before I knew good beer existed. Not much I can say that others have not already stated. Straw like color, white fizzy head. Some grain like smells. Taste was very dull, bland, watery and overly sweet. No real solid hops, malt, or any other beerlike qualities. I barely consider this a beer anymore."
"Why am I even bothering...mostly just because I am offended for consuming this garbage."
"I only wish that the rating were lower than 1.0!! I would rather drink tap water than this. The only reason this beer is popular is the advertising Coors does. The Silver Bullet is a complete dud."
"Extreame pale lager, yellow in color with a surprisingly decent look in the glass.  No taste to speak of.. only mountain water (right).  Slight malt finish, but no character at all..."
"The true ""ladies beer."" I had to give this a high drinkablity, because I do drink a lot of water."
"Yes this is light.  And it has a funky, somewhat bizarre, soapy taste to it.  If there are hops in here they are well hidden.  If it were 90+ degrees outside and there were no water or other beer available."
"pours a pale, pale gold with absolutely no head.  I can't get any smell off it whatsoever.  Taste is extremely watered down just like the body.  I may be imagining things but it seems like I can taste the faintest of malt flavor in it.  It is like rolling soda water across your mouth but it is pretty drinkable.  This beer looks, smells, and tastes like someone took a perfectly good bottle of kolsch or blonde ale and poured it into a gallon of water.  It really wouldn't be half bad for a party except that it takes at least 1.5 X as much of this stuff as it does any other beer.  If I am going to go cheap I at least want something that is going to give me a buzz by the time I kill the six pack."
"You can pound 'em all night long and still think you can drive, until the pre-hangover kicks in and causes oncoming headlights to feel like high intensity laser beams - just a prelude to how your head will feel in the morning if you choose to drink enough of it to finally achieve a solid buzz. But then, why else would you drink it?"
"i usually avoid light beers like the plague, but when your thirsty and they're free, i guess you gotta drink up.  i don't care what slight flavors you may discern if you think long and hard enough about them, this beer is crap.  it swills down easy and quenches accordingly, but is your image really going to be elevated if you drink the ""silver bullet'?   YUK!"
"This is proof positive that advertising does pay.  Why else would anyone buy this crap???  It has a very watery taste with a hint of skunk.  I think Odouls is closer to being beer than this..uh...beverage...(I almost called it a beer..oops!)."
"THIS IS NOT BEER!! That's right, it's beer-flavored carbonated water with minimal alcohol content, suitable for frat-boys, jocks, bennies (that's a NJ term for the ""hip"" Summer crowd that invades the shore every year), and other ""party animals"" who think this crap actually tastes good! How Coors manages to move so much of this garbage amazes me...when I used to work in a liquor store,  case upon case of this over-carbonated urine would fly out of the store. There's no accounting for (bad) taste I suppose. The saying ""To each his own"" applies here!"
"very watery..."
"One could argue whether this should actually be referred to as beer. It's more like carbonated water."
"mmm... ""beer""   or, more accurately, quasi beer-colored water.  don't waste your time."
"Carefully crafted to avoid anything which might offend the mass market - including flavor."
"Notes: Why bother?"
