"Drunk from a 355 mL can (stamped ""06 2015"") while at Hyatt Ziva in Puerto Vallarta. Bland and watery, mildly grainy, slightly sweet (corn) and yeasty; light bodied and reasonably carbonated. Mostly inoffensive if completely forgettable. Quenching after a day at the beach, as much as a cold mineral water."
"This is my family´s favorite beer so I get to taste it often. I once drank one with very nice flavour and smell, i think it was very fresh out of the factory, every other time its a very bad, tasteless beer."

"Poured from a 24 oz. can. Has a very pale yellow color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of grains, corn. Taste is, well, I would describe it, if it had one. A touch of grain, a very light sweetness. Feels watery in the mouth and overall, even for this style, is lacking in any flavor."

"Tecate Light is one of the most forgettable beers I've had in recent memory, but not because it's bad, but because it's indifferent and thoroughly unimpressive."

"Smells alright. Tastes like a good adjunct lager. If the abv of 3.7% is correct then this is a perfect Summer Barbeque beer. And it is better tasting than most of the more popular light beers. Mouthfeel was light and very fizzy (from the can) also quite refreshing."

"Went on a little family vacation to mexico and the mini fridge was stocked with these. Not normlly a fan of light beer on general but a ticker is gonna tick. Poured from the can to a glass...look was pale yellow with a big fizzy lager head and some visible carb, loos like a light beer and not all that appetizing but dont judge a book by its cover, right? Nose is corn and grain. Flavor is pretty much absent, but what is there is grainy and fairlt meh. Mouth is light and fizzy. I would say that this is the kind of beer you can drink all day but honestly i am nit going to make it through the can. Call me a beer snob but this just isnt good."

"You guys are f-ing clowns. T-minus is the most versatile beer in the world! You can drink it when it is warm, it is 100 degrees out, and it delicious, furthermore you can drink it when its chilled to perfection and its MORE DELICIOUS OR DELICIOUSER ... Also, there is alot of water in it so you can stay hydrated. Consider it the most top notch light day drinking beer you've ever pressed your fairy little lips to. Sack up Bruh!"

"yeah. I almost like this better than regular tecate, which I now recall overcooking a rack of lamb while reviewing... this is a soda light pop beer, fizzy and pale golden, without much malt or hops distinguishable in the nose or the taste, but an element of refreshment without all of the adjunct or metallic crap flavors of the usual macro light brew. honestly, with a lime, its entirely passable as a buzz holder. in other words, a beer you sip on after you've got a mellow going that will just maintain you, when you don't want to deplete the stash of anything worthwhile. not impressive by any stretch, but I would take this over many other garbage beers in the fiesta cooler."

"Yeah, I could have Tecate, but why risk all those unnecessary calories? This stuff pours a clear pale straw topped by a finger of lightly off-white foam. The nose comprises funky wheat, sweet corn, light white bread, and plenty of hard water. The taste brings in more of the same, with extra hard water and extra funk on the wheat. The body is pretty light, with a light moderate carbonation and a watery feel. Overall, this stuff is too weak on every front to be more enjoyable than a bottle of Evian. Pass."

"Aromas of light stale beer, light corn, and some grain. Flavors are the same, not much else for a basic pale ale, watered down overall, nothing that makes this beer stand out. Decent overall due to the heat, but wouldn’t go out of my way to drink this one again."

"O- overall I think this beer is very poor. It's meant to be drank ice cold in large quantities, and for that type of beer there are much better alternatives."
""

"Same old song and dance kinda beer, maybe be alright on a real hot summer day when your out on the lake and there's not much choice. I had a hard time telling this apart from regular Tecate, so I guess that's a good thing for a light beer."

"I've honestly never seen Tecate Light until I came across this at my local distributor in PA...needless to say I had to get it, considering the fact that we're going to a Primus/Gogol Bordello and Pirates game this week. This is a good beer to have in a cooler to mess with your friends. Only 3.7% it could be a marathon beer for a hot sunny day tailgating, and it's not has horrible as the reviews entail on this website. Aroma has a sharp chemical/slightly metallic smell with creamed corn and cooked canned vegetables all day. A bit of grain, husk, and corn resides in this beer. Flavor reveals a clean grainy, creamed corn flavor with minimal hop flavor going on. Overall a one dimensional canned beer from Mexico that has fulfilled some highlighted qualities like cold refreshing, macro lager status with a hint of cheap. Mouthfeel is highly carbonated, yellow and fizzy all of the way."

"Mouthfeel is the same, so watery and with so light carbonation it makes you wonder why it's called a beer."

"what do we expect? this is commercial mexican lager done light. wish i hadn't poured it, actually; tastes better from the can. head dissipated faster than anything i can recall leaving a few bubbles rising from the bottom of a very pale yellow-gold colored beer. smells of musty corn and damp grains. taste? minimal. watery, mildly macrolager tasting. less carbonation when poured than when consumed out of the can. seriously - don't pour this beer into a glass. it is exactly what it is when consumed with lime out of the can: a quaffing light beer made to refresh, consume in quantity and instantly forget. works on a warm, sunny day when the 18 pack is on sale."

"The beers is good with lime and salt and with mexican food but is very poor by itself."

"Tecate light...a lighter version of Tecate and as in most Mexican beers taste best in the summer with a lime...however, judging Tecate light solo...its just another no frills cerveza! The beer poors golden clear with good carbonation that give a white foamy head for a brief time. The smell and taste are enhanced with grain. The hops help somewhat with the taste so that it is not bread water. Mouthfeel is easy especially on hot days...enjoy!"
"Served in a can at a resort in Mexico. The beer pours a crystal clear yellow-gold color with a thick, foamy white head. Smells of oats and malt. Very crisp and light in mouth, with a slight sour taste. Musky rice/grain taste with slightly sour malt tones. Crisp, clean, and very smooth finish, with a slight musty aftertaste linger. Easy to drink when you are poolside in a resort. Not so much would I search this one out again."
"Drinkability - the taste isn't horrible, but it's not in any way complex or intriguing. Easy to drink a lot of, so it probably serves it's purpose."
"Sigh I know people who swear by this beer and drink it all the time and I'm left wondering what's the point?"
"D: As awful as I made this beer sound, it's actually much better than the regular Tecate."
"This beer is not unique at all. It's just another watery light beer. However, it has a low alcohol content compared to most light lagers. I can't see any reason to buy this beer. There are plenty of other light lagers that go down just as easy and have a greater alcohol content."
"This is like Tecate but worst, can you imagine?"
"The head foamed up and quickly receded. Whoops! The color was a golden yellow with NE-quality clarity. Nose had a cereal sweetness of adjuncts. Uh oh. Mouthfeel was medium with a definite presence of adjuncts, but not not as prevalently as I have experienced in ""regular/leaded"" beers. Taste was mild and smooth with a cereal flavor throughout. Hmm. Finish was mildly malty/cereal. Ho hum. Jack, you did not miss much. RIP, old buddy."
"Taste is very similar to a less-than-fully carbonated Perrier sparkling water. A few hints of cardboard with a dab of sweet honeydew melon...mmmm, doesnt that sound good? Well, its not. Pretty damn watery with very little appeal. Might work as a beach beer, but I would drink a regular Tecate before this."
"Finish: Dry finish with bitter aftertaste with metallic notes."
"Pours a pale yellow color. 1/8 inch head of a white color. Poor retention and poor lacing. Smells of yeast cleanliness and adjunct. Fits the style of a Light Lager. Mouth feel is smooth and crisp with an average carbonation level. Tastes of adjunct, strong metallic flavor, and slight yeast cleanliness. Wow, the least flavored beer I've ever had - no body at all."
"Aroma is essentially not there, and neither is any taste. It feels like a pilsner watered down quite heavily, and elaborating on anything is just making it up. Horrible, did not make the grade even in a beach at 86 degrees."
"Pours basically clear color, hardly a hint of yellow. Smells like tin foil. Tastes like seltzer water. Head is nonexistant as soon as the pour is finished. Okay so maybe there is the slightest hint of malt in the taste. I can't guarantee that though."
"I'am analyzing the most consumed beer in the north-eastern Mexico. The appearance is the typical yellow color, don't look bad but its very simply, there's no foam; the water have any smell ? well, this beer smell like water; the taste isn't bad, just a tiny malt essence; very fizzy mouthfeel, you feel like drinking mineral water, without body; in the drinkability, we have a very easy beer to drink with low alcohol."
"There are much better Mexican beers than this."
"Poured moderately yellow with no head. Smell was just light, sweet malt. Taste was like corn, sweet malt, and a hint of bitterness just to keep it real, because that's how Tecate Light rolls. It really wasn't that bad for a light beer, and it definitely wasn't offensive at all. No off flavors and went down like water. Thanks, Tecate light sample hander-outers."
"D - Honestly, I'm on my honeymoon, so I'm inclined to be much more happy with this beer than I would be back home in Springpatch. But, it's a serviceable brew for beach-quaffing, and it's doing the job (despite the very low alcohol content :(....). Not a bad beach brew by any means, but it's not something to seek out in the states."
"Not one of my favorites."
"12 oz. glass bottle - color of transparent gold, with a no head to speak of - nose of oats, hay , grassy , and stale  light taste of not much, some skunk, oat, and grass- body is light, dry, and with medium carbonation  aftertaste is little to none"
"With three beers down and one to go here in the College Light Invitational, Keystone Light steps up tomorrow night."
"For what it is it is. Nothing but a light beer made to kill thirst and help you avoid heatstroke. There is some actual taste to it and at this alcohol level you are unlikely to be getting drunk from a mug of it. A good substitute for water should you find yourself in Mexico or wanting something with a Mexican meal with a low alcohol punch."
"Presentation: Packaged in a twenty-four ounce aluminum can, served in a standard pint tap glass."
"I think is better try this beer in bottle, If you want you can add limes."
"Light Mexican beer, its flavor is good, its aroma accentuated a little in spite of its lightness, its presentation is magnifies, very tends to be sold in my country, by his low carb, easy to digest and to taste, it is obtained anywhere, is not expensive, his appearance had the distinctive color of pilsener beer, drink directly from the aluminum can is good"
"Well, I cannot say much in favor about a light beer, no matter what brand it is. BUt this at least does not taste awfull. Just a little of water tasting. BUt if you want to hang with your friends and not get drunk, then here you are. The flavor is a little close to Tecte regular, but you can get the light angle."
"My girlfriend likes this beer... she said its easy to drink and doesnt get you too fat (31 Kcal)... lol"
"reviewed 4-2-04 and taken from notes. Very light gold almost yellow. Full head which is white and full carbonation. Cut straw in nose and leans toward neutrality. Flavor is of the same cut straw and body is chalky, not right for style. All in all, not a bad attempt at a light beer."
"Clear yellow; light malty smell; you can find some bitterness; some hops as an aftertaste and very drinkable in any tropical weather."
"Tecate Light I believe is only found in Mexico. I had this when down in Puerto Vallarta with some friends. I had this in hot weather so in that case it hit the spot, very cold and crisp. It poured a light yellow with no head to speak of, minimul to no lacing. Smell is of light citrus and waterdowned hops. The taste has a minimul blast of hops and alot duller than regular version. Feels flat but crisp in mouth. Drinkable in the sultry sun of Mexico but on any given day this is not the beer for me."
