The smell is grain/barley and pilsner hops. The taste is sharp, pilsner hops strike first, then a slight balance of malt, the aftertaste is bitter.

Lots of fizzy white foam coming up through the bottom of the glass, and reach about an inch before dropping back down and not leaving any bit of lacing what so ever. Aroma is light grains, musky and full of moldy, bready notes. Nothing you would really want to go around bragging about in any way. Clean and crisp, it made for a good water substitute, but again that was about it as it really just had very little flavor to it at all. Wet hay maybe and a light touch of corn, but nothing really.","mikesgroove","Mar 05, 2011"

Still, it pours a very carbonated yellow like it should. The aroma has a skunky maltiness to it but nothing special. The mouthfeel is like water and the taste is bready and grainy.

Nose is quite faint with some miniscule amount of grassy, floral hops in the background alongside a faint grain presence. Grassy and grainy flavors dominate what is a really, really faint body--you can really tell from the taste that not much went into this brew. Feel is light and prickly. Goes down quite smoothly, and is better than its American comparisons in that it actually would be preferable to carbonated water, at least for me.","Thorpe429","Oct 13, 2010"

1.97,-9.6,1,1.5,2,1.5,3,"I'm not entirely sure that this qualifies as "beer," per se. The most distinctive characteristic is definitely "seltzer," to the point where my girlfriend commented that, upon hearing its dismal abv, you could simply "cut" Coors light with seltzer to produce something akin to Beck's Premier. That being said, however, I've grown oddly fond of the concotion. It inspired me to make a dive to my local distributor to find a bottle of Anchor's Small Beer, which, alas, they did not have. The taste, of course, is nil, though it's oddly refreshing as a water drink, rather than a beer. What caught my interest, however, is the uniquely low alcohol content. Not quite an NA beer, but almost half the alcohol content of most lights, this is something of its own class. Smirinoff "Pure" comes to mind? Anyhow, it's appearance, nose, mouthfeel, and taste are so lacking its not really worth dignifying with a description. I am going to give it a "3" for Drinkability, though, because I honestly believe that this is a great utility beer. It's remarkable for, say, family functions where the possibility of embarassing oneself in front of Aunt Gertrude is ever-looming as a direct result of a mountain of free beers and, lets be honest, not much else to do. The same goes for tailgating when you actually want to remember the game or concert, etc. It's the ultimate in session..."beverages"...for the sessions with friends, family, and colleagues of the Coors Light & Labatt's set, aka, America.","yourunclewalt","Aug 18, 2007"

1.68,-22.9,2,1.5,1.5,2,2,"Beck's Premier Light pours a pale yellow with a white head from a green twelve ounce bottle. The aroma is skunky and not very pleasant. Very light flavor, kind of grainy, kind of skunky and altogether unpleasant. I didn't realize until now that this was a 2.3% beer. I can't really imagine who the intended market is for this, it tastes bad and it doesn't have enough alcohol in it to appeal to people just trying to get a buzz or appeal to those who want an na beer.","Drew966","Jan 25, 2007"

2.41,10.6,2,1,3,2.5,3,"D: By no means a good beer, but it tastes significantly better than any other light beer I've tried. At 2.3%, it's going to take a lot of these if you're planning on feeling any alcoholic effects (totally defeating the purpose of drnking a light beer), but if you're watching your weight and are having one or two social drinks, this may be your best choice.","klewis","Aug 13, 2006"
2.68,22.9,3,2.5,3,2,2.5,"Skunked, watery, German-style pilsner. There's no other way to describe it. It does have a more grainy malt character to it than Beck's Light, and there are some delicate hop flavors in the background, but there's really not much going on. The flavor ranks right up there with non-alcoholic beers, and for the extra 1.8% abv that you're getting I see no point in bothering with this at all. There are much better light beers out there! Unless, of course, you really like that German malt and hop flavor - but if that's the case why not really enjoy one good bottle of beer versus two of these? Disappointing to say the least...","NeroFiddled","Aug 13, 2006"

Big bubble, fluffy head for about 5 seconds which then vanished into nothing. Smell is somewhat limey. Taste is about what you expect from this category, but slightly better than the standard low-carb beer. Mouthfeel is surprisingly nice, not too weak with decent carbonation. A little too sweet I suppose.","benmiliron","Jul 14, 2006"

Smells of well water and a bit of grassiness, I'm straining for that though. Taste is also watery with a slight floral aspect and a stronger artificial sweetener flavor. Mostly though its well water. This might have been better than the other low carb beers I tried but its still horrible. I don't know why people get this, I will never have a low carb beer again, even if its free. My low carb experiment ended with the conclusion that low carb and beer were never meant to be in the same sentence. Duh.","granger10","May 17, 2006"

2,-8.3,2,2,2,2,2,"The description for a "2.0" rating pretty much says it all. It's very pale, with little smell to note, and the taste and drinkability are that of a severely watered down beer with little acolohol content. But then what do you expect from 64 calories? It's not horrible, and stil maintains bit of the flavor of a regular Beck's although severely diluted. I suppose if you're planning on doing some binge drinking, and feel like saving a few hundred calories then it's not a bad option... just start with something better and switch over when you have enough of a buzz going that the lack of taste isn't a huge concern. ;)","mikes2923","Apr 20, 2006"
2.33,6.9,2,1.5,2,2.5,4,"Pours the palest light straw color, with pristine clarity. Two and a half finger head of fizz shows zero lacing and no retention. Extremely faint hallertau or saaz hop skunk aroma, with a weak pale malt and wheat scent; but no aroma to speak of. Extra light pale malt and wheat taste; kinda sweet- with a gentle wave of euro-hop bitterness that overcompensates for the lack of malt flavor. Hint of light-struck hops in the aftertaste. Medium carbonation and very watery body gives it a super-light and crisp mouthfeel similiar to tonic water. The finish is clean other than a trace of euro-skunk; so a good drinkability but very boring. This is way to light even for the style and the hop character is grossly unbalanced.","PBRstreetgang","Apr 17, 2006"

2.72,24.8,2,2.5,2.5,3,3.5,"alright, enough flack from all you real men who dont drink light beer. sometimes drinking 5 imperials of barley wine and washing it down with 10 plates of nachos is a little overkill. theres nothing wrong with enjoying a light beer every now and then. (gasp!) anyway, this stuff is alright. im not in love with it, but hey, i dont like soda and this is a good pick for lunch or after the gym when you dont really need the full impact of a heavyweight brew but need a little refresher. its pale, of course, and it smells faint. lightly sweet and grainy if anything. its crisp in the mouth, refreshing and light and delivers a touch of sweetness matched with the slightest pressence of hops. like a dumbed down, lighter version of....becks! it is somewhat enjoyable, a lil funky and it tastes better than the usual NA beer. which is basically what it could be chalked up as (low alc. very low calories). so all in all, i think its a decent stab at a low cal/alch. beer, and on hot days when the sun is out in full effect, its a decent quencher.","DESTRO","Mar 11, 2006"

2.3,5.5,2,2,2,2,3.5,"An ultra light is an ultra light and expecting anything more from it is unreasonable. And in that spirit I'd have to say this wasn't a bad representation of the original. The pour is an overly carbonated golden-yellow with a frothy white head that fades quicky, no lacing. Very slight old clothes/book smell on the nose but not offensive. Just enough hops to remind you it's a beer and not a sports drink. I'd add this to the list of Aspen Edge and Bud Select for ultra-lights although Amstel and others still qualify.","packetknife","Aug 28, 2005"

It's actually a very drinkable, smooth and tasteful competitor to the "Aspen Edges" and "Michelob Ultras" of the world. On that comparison, it succeeds very well because, frankly, it has at least some quality taste about it. It's weaker than the Regular brew from Beck's, yes; but for a low-carb and low-cal brew, why not drink a Beck's? It won't become my "regular" beer, but I think I will become a regular "Beck's Premier" drinker. [Thanks, JB, for the sample bottle. I went out and bought some more!]","tugdriver7","Apr 30, 2005"
