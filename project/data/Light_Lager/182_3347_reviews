"This is just a whatever beer that a casual drinker can have."
""
"Nothing stands out with this one. Bland and boring."
"Is this great beer?  NOPE.  That is not the important question.  The real question is how does this compare to other inexpensive light beers.  To that question I would say it is a superior product.  Because it is yuengling it has a better color than the flavor would suggest.  Has a pleasant and present flavor (not a given in this style).  Smooth if not interesting.  Very good beer if you want something really light and pretty cheap.  Maybe too much for lawn mower beer but perfect for a summer cookout with the boys that goes all day and night."

"Solid light beer, as far as low calorie/taste goes, this is one of my favorites."
"Ok for a light macro lager.  Much better than the BMC versions."
""
"Not as good as the regular lager. It is a little more bland. However still very smooth."
""
"It's a tasty beer ( I'm trying to cut calories ) wish the ABV was a little higher. Overall a pleasant light lager"
"Grabbed a couple of these walking around and enjoyed the taste and smell.  Mouth feel was good.  I could session a lot of these.  Not going to get drunk on this.  Much better than St. Louis Swill or Rocky Mountain Low."

""
""
"A great American light beer."
""
"Above Average for a LIGHT Beer!"
"Overall Yuengling Light is probably the best light beer you'll find and has somewhat more flavor than the Bud/Miller/Coors lights yet it retains the same price point. I'm not a light beer drinker but if I had to pick one I would choose this."
""

"The best light beer I have ever tasted so far! Love it!"

""
""
"In the bottle this was ok for a light beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I'd have to say as far as widely available light lagers go this is the best option. Although it's a bit low on the abv compared to others in the class, with this beer the consumer will sacrifice about .8% abv for 100% better taste."

"As with Yuenglings lager this doesn't possess the adjunct flavors associated with American lagers. It has a nice barley graininess, slight caramel malt but an off putting metallic watery quality. It also holds a rather harsh sharpness in flavor and taste with a sour after taste. Fan of the standard but this is not worth the dip in taste to save some calories."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a light yellow with almost no head. The smell is very light with only some rice scents coming through. The taste is underwhelming with some rice from the malt and a bit of bitterness from the hops. It's not complex but it is a decent light beer for the price."
"Hard to find much to say about it, it's a light brew with a light flavor, does what it says on the tin I suppose."
""
"For a light beer this is good... It is slightly watery but it is a light.. Nice session ABV easy to knock down a six pack and not feel to guilty about it.. Worth a try on a hot day"

"O: Slightly better than the mass produced light beers from the big breweries in the USA but not by all that much. Not something I would get with any amount of regularity."
""
""
"best light beer i've had in a long time."
""
"It's not what I would call a ""good"" beer exactly, but as inexpensive light beers go, it's perfectly acceptable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Do not believe the commercials.  This tastes nothing like the commercials say.  This is a slight metalic taste, and it does not come close to the Traditional."
"really disappointed by this and at 3.2%, why even bother?"
""
"Best in the readily available, light category."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"This is the perfect beer for anyone on a diet. The appearance is a pleasing light amber. The head when poured frothy but not very long lasting . The taste is pleasing but not as robust as the regular lager but that is to be expected. The smell is not strong. Overall I think this is better than any of the light beers that I have tried."

"Yuengling Light is a step up from ""Natty Light"" and I happen to love to swill that beer when more than one is needed. YL has a good color and its has a fairly strong aroma for a light brew. It's taste is mild and does not leave an aftertaste. This is definitely a beer that the lovers of heavier beers should steer clear of. but for those mere mortals who love a cold one while mowing the yard will simply enjoy the mild but refreshing flavor."

"O: in a blind tasting, one might mistake this for their flagship lager - a few sips in, a dedicated fan may begin to notice something off... a (not-so) surprisingly great light beer"
""
""
""
"Overall: For the style, this is surprisingly awesome and would be one that I would turn to if I wanted a light beer. Plenty of flavor, unlike a lot of the beers in this style which seem to be either sugared up and/or watered down. I think I like this better than regular Yuengling. A lot better than I remember it being."
""

"Criticizing the light lager category is easier than shooting fish in a barrel. It's more like insulting fish in a barrel. For what it is, Yuengling Light Lager is decidedly above average. The hints of amber keep things interesting. I'd place this at the top of my list, for cheap light lagers, alongside Narragansett Light."

"Yuengling Light Lager brewed by Yuengling .The brew pours out a nice dark amber color with a small white head. This brew is light it has an abv of 3.2.The smell is rich with flavor. There is nothing bad about the smell of this brew.The taste is light and crips. Not much to this brew as far as taste. There is some flovor at first but it goes away fast. The after taste is like water. I was hoping for more this brew but it is not there. Yuengling Light Lager is a good drinking brew nothing bad at all. I just thought there would be more flavor. But I guess it is smooth because of it's low abv. I would get this brew again."
""
""
""

""

"Bottle: Poured a clear golden color lager with small bubbly white head with minimal retention. Aroma of sweet notes with light cereal notes. Taste is also dominated by sweet cereal notes with almost no aftertaste. Body is light with good carbonation. Easy drinking lager with very little complexity."

"I am disappointed with this beer because I love the regular lager that they make. This was far worse than the regular lager. I like the look and color a lot. There was no head but it was a beautiful colored beer. Other than the look, the beer stunk. The task is very bitter. I rather drink a Milwaukee's Best Ice to be honest. The feeling was even worse than the taste. The beer finished leaving your mouth very dry and bitter feeling. I had bout a case of this thinking it would be great like the regular lager but with less calories. I was very wrong and it was a total waste of money."

"It's got a nice color that leans toward amber as oppose to most American Beers that are just a light yellow and the most important thing is it taste good.. It's funny because the Yuengling Lager taste bad I don't like it one bit but this I recomend"

"The mouthfeel is light bodied. It has a light dryness toward the end of it, but is generally refreshing."
""
""
"It's nothing more than one would expect of a cheap light lager. Flavor is better than it could be. Between this and other light beers I suppose I would still pick this over Bud, Miller, Coors, etc. But one point of disappointment that I need to raise is the exceptionally low alcohol content. With an ABV of only 3.2, it's a failure. Seems like the brewery's idea for Yeungling Light is to water down the regular beer while still charging the same price for traditional pager. I'm not going to get skinny drinking this, I'm just going to have to pay for more drinks to get a buzz."

"Poured from a can into a shaker pint, the beer is a bright, caramel coloring with a steady flow of carbonation and not much head at all. A bit on the pale side to look at. Aromas of caramel sweet, toasted grains, and not much else. Slightly watery nose. Flavors are buttery and caramel forward, but again, watered down, with a very subtle toastiness in the backbone. Light bodied, with a slight crisp in the finish from the carbonation. The aftertaste is toasted and slightly sweet. This is certainly an easy drinker, but lacks a bit in every other department."
""
""
""
"I guess what I am saying, is in Light Beer land, Yuengling Light is GOD!"

"This beer is inoffensive unlike most light beers. However I never really have the desire to take another sip. It isn't much better than most light beers taste wise. It has a nice body and nice smell . I just can't recommend this beer as much as I love the yuengling family. Drink a regular yuengling they aren't super high on calories."
""
""
""
"not remediable. because well it is not especially good and not especially bad. very light. even for a logger. it is not quite bud light thin, but still very thin, and for the ABV, well i guess its good if your trying to take it easy, but for the money, your better off drinking cheaper light beers"

"Actually a bit better in my opinion than their regular lager, this light lager has more flavor than most light beers but offers nothing particularly special. It has flavors of bread, grain, malt, and just a touch of hops, and it is somewhat more bitter than most run of the mill light beers. Where I live this sells for $5.99/6 pack (bottles) and is actually a bit less than Coors Light and some other light beers. While not particularly good, this light beer is very drinkable and a somewhat better choice than other cheap beer options. Also, with its low ABV, it makes for a decent session beer for someone with a low budget."
"I had no choice but to try this light beer at the last party I was at (who the heck only stocks light beer in the cooler?) Anyway, it wasn't half bad. The beer had a great golden look with a white, frothy head. What surprised me was the bold, crisp flavor the beer had, even though it felt a bit watery. Overall, it was one of the better lights I have had."

"I'm pretty sure that all they did was water down regular yuengling lager until it was below 100 carbs, (99 according to the bottle), and then bottle it as a light beer. Really glad this beer was given to me because I wouldn't buy it. If you are a fan of traditional Yuengling Lager then go with that, and if you are trying to watch you calories, drink less or make cuts somewhere else."
""

"O: basically a watered down traditional yuengling without that sour lingering aftertaste. Still would take the full flavored version over this one though."

"take all the bad features of the normal yuengling, its gross stale malt flavor, its way over the top carbonation, and its skunky aftertaste, then water it all down, and this is what you get. it pours clear and bubbly, minimal head. the aroma is pretty bad, metallc and off on the malt, no hops at all. the flavor is just a dumbed down regular yuengling, with a little less body. carbonation is also brutally ovedone, feels like a pepsi in my mouth, but tastes far worse. this had me on the verge of throwing up in my mouth, no joke. i can find some redeeming factor in any beer, which is hard in this case, but guess if you want to drink all day and not catch a buzz, this it your go. not something ill hopefully ever drink again."

"Overall it's fairly inoffensive but it sure smelled unappealing on first open. I suppose you could do worse, can't say I am really drawn to this though, what's the point of drinking a beer that has next to nothing for taste?"
"12 ounce bottle. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours a clear light amber color with a half inch off-white head. The head didn't stay around for too long, and there's a small amount of lacing. Aroma is sweet malt and corn, not much to this brew at all. It's not a bad aroma, but not great either. Taste is the same as the aroma, it's all sweet malt and corn. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, it's smooth, a bit slick and goes down easy enough. I'd have to say for the style of beer this is, it's average. I've certainly had a lot worse. It's not offensive at all, and for the most part I think it's more enjoyable than most light beers I've had in the past. Not that I would make a point to seek this out, but it's really not bad. Single bought from Blacklick Wine and Spirits for $1.09."

"Served from bottle into a shaker. Poured a golden caramel color with a half finger white head that subsided to a minimal amount quickly. There was no lacing evident throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, nutty, and floral. The flavor was of sweet malt, nutty, floral, and water. It had a light feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this was a fairly average brew. While there wasn't a whole lot going on here, it really wasn't bad either. Just wish this one would have been a little more complex. Would make a good gateway beer for the regular frat boy out there."
""
"I tried the Yuengling Light Lager during a visit to Ohio. The beer poured a light oak color with a nice creamy white head,then lay to a light lace around the top of the glass. The smell and taste were mostly malt with slight balance hop. The mouthfeel was light in body and carbonated. Overall I think it is very drinkable, a nice light beer."

"Prefer the normal yuengling lager, this light beer had no taste really. I dont like any light beers but I would prefer one of the big 3 over this one. The aroma was alright the appearance was a light bright color but the taste wasn't that good. Didn't apprecaite the aftertaste either. I believe I can get the same quality of this beer at a lower price as well."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This was my second or third time having it- maybe it's because I was paying more attention this time around, but pretty disappointed and a lot less flavor than I remembered. Even if I had a long night of drinking ahead of me I would go with Yuengling Heavy over this."
""
""
""
"O - Not bad after mowing the lawn, that's for true. I could see this being an easy drinking summer beer but definitely not one I'd keep on hand if available."

"Poured mid pale yellow body with a white head that starts full but dies off quickly.Spotting more than lacing the glass. Aroma is weedy grass, rice, corn. Taste is a bit acrid but crisp.A touch thin and watery.Leaves a slick, almost oily aftertaste in the mouth."
"Out of a 24oz can this beer was a clear, golden color with a fizzy white head. Decent lacing and retention. The aroma was of pale malt, lager yeast and almost no hops. The flavors were also almost all pale malt, some adjuncts (corn?), cereal grains and a hint of sweetness. Very easy to drink but also very little to write about. The body was light, the carbonation average and the mouthfeel ok."
"Pours a lite golden-amber. Deep color for a beer of this style. A white head soon rings. Low carbonation, and as a result, the feel suffers. Smell is mild adjunct and not much else. Taste is very light biscuit, small amounts of bitters, and water. Mostly water."
"Pours with a tall head that quickly disappears. While I love Yuengling, Light just does not work. It is your typical watered down light beer. It is only god for the hottest day when mowing the lawn. I've got a case in the basement so I hope it gets warm so I can finish it."
"Quaffable, mild flavor, moderate carbonation. Not all that bad for the style."
"D - I wouldn't turn one down if offered, but I doubt I'll revisit otherwise."
"Probably the best readily available light beer. Extremely high drinkability."
"My friend brought a six pack over the other night and I had a couple. The color was a light amber, taste was smooth however it seemed more watered down. Overall taste was ok and this would be a great summer time beer outside in the heat. Overall the beer was ok but I prefer the origial Yuengling Traditional Lager."
"O: Not too bad... at just 3.4%, probably one of the better light lagers out there; unfortunately, there’s just not much character with this beer and it becomes more unenjoyable throughout consumption."
"O - not bad for an American light lager, and worked OK as a beverage to accompany a meal."
"Just ok with a no frills design."
"Tea-colored beer with a light head that dissipates quickly. Grassy, sweet aroma with light citrus notes. Crisp, fresh, leafy flavor. Creamy texture, but doesn't feel heavy at all. The only way I can tell this is a light beer is the slightly watery body, but even that isn't unpleasant. Hard to believe this is in the same category as the BMC lights. I'd drink this stuff all the time if it were available in my area."
"O: In the land of American light lagers, this would be near the top. There aren't any real off flavors like some of the other mass produced beers have. Nice and light tasting (it's a light beer) and refreshing in the summer."
"Honestly I wish they'd stop making Light beers. This beer pours just like it's fuller version the Traditional Lager. It's got a copper-ish amber color with a white head that goes away quickly. The smells are almost the same, it's kind of hoppy and it's got some grains in there too. The aroma is super light though. The taste is virtually absent from this beer. Compared to the original Lager this beer is very weak on flavor. All I can say is that you should just drink the real thing."
"Ill begin with stating my fondness for Yuengling Lager. Its been one of my stand-by beers for a long time. After a recent band practice at my home, I found a couple bottle of the Light Lager left by my sax player. So, watching the game the other night---POP. First sip out of the bottle was a shock---watery. Really watery. So I poured the brew into a pint glass. Hey, looks like Lager---nice color. Drank it down and this is my view on this beer: Take a reg Lager---add 1/4 cup of water=Light Lager. I wasn't fond of this beer. Watery taste, watery mouthfeel. Not a beer I would ever want to drink again. Stick to the real deal Lager."
"O: Better than your 'average' watery light beer in some ways, in others about, well, 'average'. Have had a few different Yuenglings in the last couple years, but never this one. As a version of their standards that satisfies the calorie-conscious ('99 Calories', says so on the label), I'd say it isn't bad at all. Among the best I've tried of the style."
"Notes: Overall it's an average light beer with no real flaws for its style. Its light on everything and easy to drink."
"Yuengling Light Lager pours out a slighter shade than your average yuengling traditional, this is a tan shade of amber. A nice inch of ecru foam on top fades becomes a cap leaving sqiggles. Smell is fairly simple, wait im being to nice, this actually smells like hay and faded barley with a hint of corn. Taste is a step up though. If you had a yuengling this is the same just toned down a notch, or they put less corn in it or something. Feel is light like the name implies and the carb is crisp out of da can. I would not go out of my way for this but a good one to go for if your in a pinch, or if your extremely broke at the time, hence, why I purchased this."
"It was only average drinkability, even being only 99 calories it still felt heavier than a light beer, this is a good beer but its not something I could tailgate with, its more of a have a few gotta drive home later type beer, made me feel fuller than normal light beers. Overall a good beer that should be picked up."
"Thanks to woody for the can!"
"Wow a light beer with some color. It's nice to see a light beer that is something other than the usual pale yellow. Amber, caramel, bronze colored with no head just a tight ring of lace on the top of the glass. Faint hint of caramel in the nose but there's really not much there. At least it doesn't smell bad. Faint malt, caramel, and lemon grass flavors. It's a light beer so it's light on flavor but at least it's a light beer with flavor. Very light in body with a nice dry finish. For a light lager you could do much worse. This and Sam Adams are the 2 best light beers I've had."
"D- Better than the average light beer."
"Pours a dark yellow color - maybe halfway between the usual light beer and Yuengling. Small head that recedes fairly quickly, and a thin film left on top. Has a bit of the smell of Yuengling regular, a quite noticeable sweetness. Taste is where things go wrong. Too much carbonation up front, like seltzer water. Behind it there is not much taste, just a watered-down version of the 'normal' beer. The flavor is pushed to the background. I'll admit that this is different than the BMC lights - it doesn't have the skunky and metallic flavors - but that doesn't make it better."
"As is virtually always the case with light beer, this tastes very much like the full calorie version with extra water. Since the full calorie version is a very good (though admittedly somewhat simple) beer, and there's no such thing as a light Bock or IPA or even a light Hefe Weisse (at least not that I know of), this is naturally one of the best light beers I've ever had. Ok, really THE best. There are years between my rating this and the former champ (Amstel), so I'm not sure if my number rating will reflect that. Anyway, its like Yuengling Traditional only lighter and waterier. Color is still brown, though paler than the Traditional. Head is basically nonexistent. Smell is slightly malty, just barely detectable hops, and generally cleaner than the Traditional since it comes in a brown bottle instead of a green one. The taste still demonstrates a recognizable malt character (its actually maltier than many a full calorie macro like Miller), the hops are the same tasty combo of Cascade and Cluster found in Traditional (thanks for clearing that up Alstrom Bros), though obviously weaker. Mouthfeel is slightly on the watery side, though compared to other light beers its unusually substantial. Drinkablity is as good as possible for anything that contains alcohol. The taste may not produce a symphony in your mouth, but its clean, pleasant, and very substantial for a light. Combined with its light easy drinking nature, you definitely have something you could drink all day. This gets an A+ for light beer, maybe an A- for a cheap American brew you can buy anywhere (if you live on the east coast like me), maybe a B- when rated among all beers. Yes I've got a sentimental bias in favor of Yuengling products, but this is still exceptional for a light beer."
"Mouthfeel is on-par for the style, and this is a very easy-drinking beer altogether. Only 3.4%? Nice, so does that mean that Yuengling Light Lager qualifies as a session beer? Inquiring minds want to know!"
"Part of a Yuengling sampler pack. Being a light beer definitely not my preferred 'style' of beer but I'm open to try anything. Pours a dark golden color, thin head.. looks pretty good for a light beer. No aroma to this one. Very light bodied, slight lacing on glass. Watery mouthfeel to say the least, but there's a slight hoppiness in there and definitely has at least SOME taste. Extremely drinkable and goes down easily, especially with the lower ABV. As a beer overall this wouldn't rank very high, but in the 'light beer' spectrum this one is pretty good. Looks/tastes better than a ton of other light beers (except Sam Adams Light of course) and goes down easy. Nice, easy beer to drink, just take it for what it is."
"D: For a light lager, it is easy to drink. Low alcohol content. Has just enough flavor to keep drinking them while tailgating."
"Drinkability: My ratings seem higher than I expected, but a part of that is probably an indication of the category. Overall this is more impressive than most of the standard light beers you will find. I mentioned that I bought a 12pack after a party to finish out the night, and it seems it would serve that type of purpose."
"if you can drink water, you can drink this. this beer was made for drinkability, as well as a slightly healtier alternative. as far as light lagers go, this is prolly the best ive seen so far, not so much of an adjunct flavor, but still hella watery."
"D-perfect, i'm not sure if there's another beer i could have a larger volume of...of course this has to do with the low ABV, but the taste is quite yummy considering."
"The verdict?? Very low ABV and lack of offensiveness would make it a good session beer. It's better still than macros. However, if you're looking for any complexity, you should stay away. Then again the word ""light"" probably tells you that already."
"This beer had more body and flavour to it than many other Light Lagers I have remembered tasting. It's a good choice for cutting the grass. I can definately see myself drinking this when I'm in the mood."
"Shit's not bad: a little more complex than most ""light"" beers and easy on the wallet. You want a decent beer with which to sit on your porch and play the guitar? This one is a model."
"D: Fairly easy to drink, by marco lager standards. Not awful, but certainly one of the last choices. At least if there are other options. Granted, the few beers I've had that I really hate and won't drink again, still would be worse than this one. But that's just an opinion."
"drinkability: what you would expect from a light lager, could be easily written off as a watered-down version of the Traditional, but viewed as a pilsner it is above average and something that can be readily enjoyed."
"The beer poured a light oak color with a nice creamy white head,then lay to a light lace around the top of the glass. It has a decent taste, a little watery and carbonated. Nice mouth feel, goes down smooth. I think it is very drinkable, a nice light beer, better than most light beers."
"Pours a clear straw color with a full cap of frothy white head, diminishing quickly leaving no lacing. Scent is clean with only a hint of dried hay and must. As regular Yuengling Lager is a tad more fuller taste than many other macros, the light version brings it in check with most american macro lagers. Dried hay, touch of nuttyness and some must are the only notable flavors. Highly carbonated, slightly watery. A decent replacement for the BMC Lights of the world."
"D- Very sessionable and a step above macros. Still nothing to go out of your way for though."
"Drinkability: It is a light beer. Fairly refreshing. Decent at best."
"Great crisp refreshing mouth on this. Some light toasted grains in the flavor. Bitterness is low which is expected. Finish is sweet. I can't say that there's a ton more complexity that a BMC Light, but it's just better-crafted. This one's got a bit of flavor and a much thicker mouthfeel. Drinkable? You better freaking believe it."
"Notes - Still plenty of carbonation gives this a decent mouthfeel. However there is no way to look at it but this is a real shortcoming for Yuengling."
"d- the drinkability is good here, it's very light and refreshing, this is a chuggable light lager for sure."
"NOTES: I love Traditional Lager but I just can't stomach whatever it is they do to make this flavor. Just bad in my humble opinion."
"Mouthfeel is crisp with light with high carbonation. Drinkability is pretty OK, it goes down easy but it doesn't have enough flavor for me to want to drink more. Overall one of the better light beers but that's probably not saying much."
"Taste is like a BMC light lager. Not much here, light hoppines bur really light. Carbonation is a bit high like most BMC lagers. Skip this go for the light beer."
"Overall one of the most appealing light lagers I have had. Hats off for this one, I think it is better than the Traditional Lager."
"Very drinkable though I was expecting a bit more due to the raving of my northern friends."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1/2"" eggshell head over the clear amber brew. Head lasts pretty well, with average to good lacing. Aroma is minimal, pale sweetness and slightly earthy hops. Taste is sedate, light pale malts and balancing crisp hops. Mouthfeel is smooth, and drinkability is very easy. Good option for the style."
"Poured from a 12 oz. can. Has a golden color with amber highlights and a 1/2 inch head. Smell is sweet and malty. Taste is of malts, not as watered down as other light beers. Feels light in the mouth and has decent drinkability. Overall, for a light beer this ain't that bad."
"Like others, It came in a sampler, I had to try 1 before I gave the rest away. Ehhh... it's in the name, Light, better tasting than your run of the mill domestics. Didn't waste time with a glass, just swigged it from the bottle, initial taste was smooth, and faded quickly, actually had a ""German"" taste for the finish. Don't have much to say for light beers, period."
"for a light beer its not as bad as the macros but its still a light beer, got a sixer that came with the variety, otherwise i wouldn't buy this again"
"D - Definitly drinkable, just don't know how much I want to."
"From the 12 fl. oz. bottle with no date or lot code. Sampled on October 12, 2009. The pour is a handsome amber-copper with little to no head, slow upwardly, mobile carbonation bubbles, and virtually no head. The aroma has a dab of sweeter malts and neutral hops. The mouthfeel is fairly study for a light beer. The flavor is a mixture of caramel malts and rather bready. A nice enough light lager."
"A decent beer and well above average for this style. This still resembles a nice lager, whereas many larger breweries' do not."
"Not bad for a light beer. In the glass it has a solid gold color, definitely darker than most of its peers. The smell is of grain and more faintly of floral/spicy hops. It has a nice balanced hops and light malt flavor as it hits the palate but that flavor disappears almost as soon as it arrived. Mouthfeel is lacking as was expected. All in all this one is a step above the macro light brews."
"This beer is not terrible for what it is, its really easy drinking and is not offensive in anyone aspect. Its definitely a way watered down version of there regular lager but its still not a bad beer for a light beer. Basically this is a good option if you are looking for a long session beer. Its strong point is obviously its drinkability and its low point is you cant definitely at times feel its very watered down."
"I got two fingers' of ecru head off of my pour which held in nicely. Color was the same medium-reddish amber as its leaded counterpart, which made my hopes rise. Nose had a light malty sweetness, again not too different from the leaded version. Mouthfeel was medium but the taste was really thin. Dang it! I would love to be able to recommend a low-calorie, low-carb counterpart, but this just did not have the Ooomph to cause me to do so. There was a light sweetness on the tongue. The finish was pleasant, which a lot of Light beers CANnot say, and even a little dry, but overall it was a lesser experience. Tood bad. If you are looking for a Light beer, this might be a good candidate, but otherwise, I'd say have a Traditional Lager (the leaded version)."
"Malty, a little sweet, but definitely husky on the palate. Finishes with the lightest touch of bitterness. Not much happening here. I probably will not go back to this one."
"It is not an Imperial Stout or a Scottish Ale, but it works after the grass is cut. Sam Adams is a better Light, but it also has much more calories."
"I believe that Yuengling lager is one of the best macros out there so I figured Yuengling Light wouldn't be too bad either. Well this beer is extremely light on smell, taste, and body. It's an extremely watered down version of their lager with hardly anything exciting about it. It has hardly any aroma, tastes like tap water with malt in it, and had an extremely thin body. Nothing too exciting about this beer, but I guess if you are one of those anal calorie/carb counters this isn't a bad choice...."
"D: I rate the drinkability of this pretty high. You could have quite a session with these with them close to 3% ABV."
"Just a foul tasting brew. I was hoping this might be a light lager I enjoy, but alas, twas not to be. Thin, watery, rancid. Avoid."
"D- If you like water, you'll be able to drink this. Very thin."
"It's average rather than terrible."
"D: Tasty, goes down very easily, not too filling, very mild kick, very good representation of style, most beers in this style are light versions of Adjunct Lagers, however this is one of the few that is a lighter version of a Vienna Lager, the result is more flavor than most others."
"Low ABV, light taste, and a decent flavor. All in all, for a low-cal version, it's a pretty close approximation of Yuengling's Traditional Lager."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Tiny bubbles prickle in the mouth, never becoming more than just a mellow texture overall. Two ways to score drinkability... do I want another because the experience was so pleasurable? Hell no. Would I select this beer to pound by the carload in sweltering 100 degree heat? Probably my number one choice."
"Very light amber, clear golden color with steady carbonation. Off white head that quickly dissipates to a ring and leaves very little lacing. Aroma is nice for the style, light grain smell with a little caramel. Medium body with sharp carbonation. Strong grain flavor, light malt background and some hops bite in the finish with the carbonation balancing out initial sweetness. This beer is what it is, an above average macroish light lager."
"D: I'll take the caloric hit and take the regular Yuengling. At least it's palatable."
"also, i will try and review the CAN version of this...can versions are simply NOT the same beer. never has been for me."
"Dr. I like water better. I finished it because I'm cheap and won't waste it."
" Drinkability: A very easy to consume beer but with such a low abv ya got to be able to drink alot to get a good drunk on but its still a way better light beer than ML BL or CL"
"D: OK, this is my first light lager I've reviewed.... And it is as I had expected...Very light in all respects. You could drink a ton of these.... Not complex just simple beer low carbs and low ABV... That being said I would run away from this beer.... I'll start working in some light beers and come back to this one to compare...."
"I mean, don't get me wrong, I love this beer but it leaves a lot to be desired."
"D- easy to throw back but would like something with more flavor."
"I've had better light beers. I'll buy something else the next time I buy a light beer. You should probably do the same in my opinion. I have nothing else to say on this one but it makes me type more words...please make it stop, please...okay this should finally get me to 250"
"overall a good light beer, good for people watching what they eat drink , not as full flavored as the flagship ""lager"" ... but not bad and a great buy too"
"Smells a little nutty like peanut butter with a surprising maltiness. Pours to a light golden color with hardly any head that dissapears fast. Taste is malty but light with a slightly tarty and crisp hoppiness but really no bitterness to speak of. Has good body and the carbonation gives it a fizz but still a little thin. This is a tastier beer than I was expecting when I saw it was light. Being a 3.4% beer I am even more impressed. You can drink this stuff all day long. Great flavor. For the style it is incredible. This blows the doors off any BMC light, or BMC for that matter. For the price its a steal."
"Drinkability: It's OK for a light lager."
"D- Easy to drink and enjoy. Good beer!"
"D : It was real easy to drink but just not much flavor."
"All and all, not a bad beer but I've had better light lagers."
"Overall, one of the best light lagers I have had, but by no means ""good"""
"Had one of these tonight because thats whats in ma fridgerator haha. Fairly lackluster appearance , pale, small head. Not much in the nose- some faint grain and also faint sweetness. Flavor is better than most light bmc's but thats not saying much. There is a bite of raw grain in the back , bit of corny sweetness balanced by a touch of bitterness in the finish. Well, it goes down with more ease than bud light or mich ultra, but im just not much of a ""light beer"" guy. Basicially a watered down version of the original Yuengling Lager."
"Unlike the real Lager, this beer doesn't have a thick and distinctive, dark color but a light, seethru red that leaves no discernable head or lacings. Offers an even fainter hop aroma then the Lager and contains little in smell other than grain. Watery and a little like drinking half a Lager with H2O mixed in. Some hops present but no real citric taste or malts like the Lager, and instead of the signature crisp backbite of the Lager it just goes down silky and smooth. If you want a light beer for the taste, get Sam Adams Light. If you want a light beer for diet reasons, get a Miller or something. This is better than most macro lights, but I can't drink this when the Premium Lager is right next to it in the cooler."
"Overall- ""Lawnmower Beer."""
"D - Not a difficult beer to throw back a few of, but it's obvious watery character coupled with lack of flavor make this a subpar beer to say the least."
"D-extremly drinkable,but at what cost to your pride and dignity"
"D - Now I know why this is so damn thin and watery! There is barely any booze in this damn beer! 2.7%? You've gotta be kidding me. Even though this is a relatively cheap beer, catching a buzz on this soda pop could be expensive."
"Feels thin and watery, though unobtrusive. Gone at the swallow. It's pleasant enough for a light lager, but offers little in the way of body."
"Dark yellow pour. Nice solid head. Crisp with very little after taste. Even color with a hint of various malts almost makes you forget your drinking a litght beer. or is it!!. Noticed that it freezes faster than most beers though which is surprises me."
"Overall: pointless, just like any light beer. Half the flavor, half the alcohol. What again is the point of ""light"" beers?"
"Pours a clear orange with fast fading white head and spotty lacing. Smell: caramel malt, hint of diacetyl. Taste: watered down Yuengling Lager.. watery caramel malt and grassy hops. Mouthfeel: quite watery. Decent light beer from Yuengling, but not quite SA Light."
"D: You could drink this all day and not even get a buzz. One of the better tasting light's I've had."
"Very clear, dark gold colour with a thin, white skim of bubbles that settled to a coarse ring. Minimal lacing with fair head retention. Floral/sulfury hops in the aroma, plus some sugary malt and maybe a bit of brown sugar. Light bitterness with a mild sweetness. Lemony hops lingered. Very light bodied, nearly watery, with assertive carbonation. Easy drinking, refreshing and inoffensive, but not much flavour. One of the better light lagers I've had."
"Overall, this is a light lager I'll prefer over the BMC 'lights' on any day. Watered down, but true to Yuengling form."
"The C rating this beer has is accurate  its completely average. I drank it this past weekend and remember thinking it tasted a bit like Heineken. Mouthfeel is low, drinkability is high; the rest average. The only reason to get this is if youre in PA and you consider it a local brew."
"Tawny yellow orange body with a soft swiftly dissapating head...moderately effervescent...dark for a ""light"" beer...sharp malt accents...quite strong for a light lager too! reminiscent of the original...smooth, slightly flat and creamy palate...light to medium mouthfeel...short taste of woody sweetness--light in th finish, with hints of roasted malt...Yuenglings Light maintains much of the originals flavor traits, for the better...now, if I only liked drinking light beers..."
"Flavor is very bready. Not as light as I expected, which is nice. Faint hops."
"Unlike most light lagers I've tried, this beer doesn't have a wincing aftertaste and actually has a little bit of flavor. It's very subtle given the style, but I was impressed."
"This is probably the worst beer brewed by D.G. Yuengling and Sons. It has a nice light amber color with a nice white head, but that's the only thing they got right. The smell has something off about it and it follows to the taste. The taste is what threw me off and I don't really like this beer. It has a sweet taste to it, sweeter than the Traditional Lager and Premium, but the sweet taste is almost artificial. I think the best way to describe it is to go from drinking regular coke to diet coke and not enjoying the difference. The artificial sweetness is not good to this beer and is probably why it is a Light Lager. Don't try it if you like the Traditional Lager, not worth it."
"D- I would take this beer over any other light lager I've had. The taste, though simple and sweet, was enjoyable and the drinking was easy."
"Mouthfeel ...well., pitiful."
"Mouthfeel is bland and lifeless. I suppose if this were really cold, and I was in the right mood, drinkability could potentially be as high as 3.0. So there, that's about all I have for kind words regarding this thing. Still glad I tried another offering from such a legendary U.S. Brewer."
"Went out to Applebees and it was this or a BMC combo, so I had to go with the Yiuengling. Well I guess Yuengling isn't really a macro, but still a light lager so I went ahead and added it to the same category.. Poured a decent amber with a small white head. Lots of visible carbonation and very clear consistency. At least the tone has a decent reddish tint. Smell was full of grains and not really much else, slight hint at a caramel or sugar sweetness but very slight and only as it warmed. The taste was a little musty. Grain, corn, and grass flavors were the big players here, slight amount of caramel trying to come through but never really made it. The feel was very smooth, decent body, not as light as some others. Overall it had a bit more of a flavor profile then some of the others did, but still needs a little work. I actually liked this slightly better then the premium lager, go figure. It seemed a bit more well wounded. The lager seemed too bready to me. This was a decent light beer."
"For a light beer, this isn't too bad. Has some head, not much lacing and tastes sweetish and light. A decent lawnmower beer. Smell is slightly skunky but doesn't show up in the taste. Has no aftertaste and is crisp and smooth. Highly drinkable and extremely low ABV."
"I would say not horrible for style, but not much to it at all except some maltiness that is often lacking in light beers. Increasingly annoying aftertaste brings it down in my book. For a light beer, I suppose it's okay, though not much better than so many other light beers...Why bother....Glad I only had one sample. It was enough."
"This beer pours a light amber body with a white head. Does not hold for the whole beer and there really is not much of a lacing leftover. The smell reminded me of the other macro-lagers: some kind of a malt-alcohol hybrid on my nostrils. The taste was pretty good. Tasted like a nice light lager with a bit if a Yuengling lager twist on it that was refreshing. The mouthfeel was a little thin for me, even for a light lager. Overall, this is a very drinkable beer. Light, refreshing and not filling at all. Definitely worth a shot."
"This is one of those beers that it never made sense to me to try: Yuengling Lager worked just fine, and I didn't need to watch the calories, so why change? Ended up having it on a bartender's screw up, and here we are. Actually looks pretty good, golden color with a little head. Nose is standard lager scent, corn and grain. Taste is similar - tastes almost exactly like a lager. Feel is weak, thinner than I'd like. Overall, not a bad light lager, but then again there's no real reason to get this unless you're trying to lose weight."
"D: Well, you can have this after a workout or lawn mowing when it's really hot, because it's almost water with a bit of the flavor from Y! amber. It's better than bigger macro lights, but IC Light is a better drinker if you must drink light."
"This is BEER? I know the rules say not to slam a beer, but I don't think this qualified as beer. (Maybe I got a hold of a bottle from a lousy batch.) Color is typical straw-yellow. Aroma is weak and unimpressive. Taste is very thin, more like water than beer. It reminds me of the quip that light beers are like doing gymnastics on the beach - flipping close to water."
"On a side note, Atlanta does not have Yuengling in any stores. So for me it is always exciting going anywhere out of town to buy it."
"Pretty non-descript. Light in all facets. Basically no aroma, except for a very faint grain, hop detection. The color is very watery looking and overcarbonated; no real head to speak of. Tastes more grainy than malty, but the lightness keeps it from becomming a disaster. Light notes of green apples, and metailic note in the flavor, accompany the grains. Feels acidic and prickley with a mild hop linger. Will not go out of my way for this brew."
"Taste is a disappointment; mostly bland carbonation with thin malt flavors and no hops to speak of. I knew this was going to be a light beer but I guess I made the mistake of getting my hopes up. Not bad for a light beer just not enough taste for anything other than emergency consumption."
"falls in the macrolights just above average ... like it does with the lager. Light color...no head...no lacing....some maltiness takes it above coor's light etc. Overcarbonated and watered down at the same time. This is really not a bad offering for the style but besides 'parched thirstiness'.. this is not a beer drinkers beer. taste is in between Miller Lite and Sam Light. If I was REALLY concerned about those extra calories I would be upset that this light isn't avail. in my area...but I'm just not much of a light beer drinker....and when i am...Miller Lite is about the same quality as this...."
"This isnt in the same league as, say Sam Adams Light Lager, but its still pretty tasty. Factor in the low price and low alcohol, and this is a damn tasty beer you could drink all day if need be."
"Great beer, great price."
"P.C.C."
"I bought a 12 pack of this to drink during the National Championship at a buddy's house. The game was great (Go Gators), the beer was awful. It looked average, nothing to write home about, but a nice frothy head that laced the glass. Unfortunately, that was the best thing about it. It smelled like grassy earth and tasted about the same. The taste was very bland, similar to a bud light. I drink 2 and went to the store to buy more beer at half time and left the other 10 to the free beer fund."
"D: I'd pass unless you were looking for a very low abv beer to pound over many, many, many hours. The caloric increase up to Lager is not that significant, so take the dive dammit."
"Yuengling is a great complement to most food items, although I enjoy it with a nice summer barbecue or typical bar foods."
"A really nice brozish coppery color with a solid light tan head. Bubbles rise to the top. Looks good. Smell is weak, a bit metallic, some bready notes in there. Taste is just not enjoyable. Obviously watery but also a touch of canned sweet corn but also some plastic and metallic flavors, esp at the end. Not even a good choice if you're watching your carbs."
"Not bad at all for a light beer, but I can't really recommend it unless you absolutely require a low carb beer. Non-offensive, non-challenging, low alcohol light beer...what's the point?"
"Not thaaat bad for a light lager, but not as good as Sam Light. I would suggest getting real beer instead."
"D- Not very pleasing. At least the regular lager challenges you to keep drinking, this doesn't even put up a fight. Bland."
"Cheers!"
"Overall a drinkable light beer. Certainly better than BMC, but nothing special. However, at 99 calories, it truly is a light beer."
"Yuengling Light Lager pours a surprisingly dark color for a light lager, almost orange, with a white head from a brown twelve ounce bottle. Corn is noticeable in the aroma. Tastes like adjunct. Seems like there is an off flavor, I can't really place it, but its not overwhelming. Reasonably drinkable light lager."
"Light brownish-amber with a small slightly off-white, tight head that diminishes to a film. Smells of sweet grain and floral hops with a little brown sugar. Lightly hoppy and very bready flavor. Mild but nice. Medium-light body, slick texture, moderate carbonation. Not bat at all for a light beer"
"Drinkability: If I have to drink a light beer, this is the one that I would choose."
"poured a medium amber color with moderate white head that quickly faded to a thin coating. Smell is very minimal with only a mild sweetness to be found. Taste is more of the smell with much less character than their regular lager with a bit too light for myn taste. finish is also light with little of anything to be found. Drinkabilty to good, mostly due to the low alcohol content."
"Drinkability: not being a light beer fan, I was surprised that this didn't offend my tastebuds in relation to the light lager style. So this is nicely drinkable in my book. Choose this over the BMC alternatives if you need to drink a light beer."
"The color is a dull gold with a big head that dissipates quickly but leaves a little froth all the way down. It smells of faint barley. The taste isn't bad for a light beer. There is a little malt presence, not hops but no corn, rice or adjuncts either. It honestly feels about what an all malt lager fells like rather than a light beer. Overall its easy to drink and one of the best light beers out there."
"Poured a yellowish amber color with small head of foam that dissipated very fast and left no rings or lace whatsoever. The only good part was all those carboantion bubbles in the pilsner glass. The only aroma was that of faint malts and hops and nothing else. The taste was very crisp and clean with a slight malty aftertaste to it. I thought the mouthfeel was kind of watery and light, but not as watery like most macro light beers. Overall this was an above average light beer with more taste and better mouthfeel than most light beers. If you want a light beer and can't find Sam Adams light, then this would make a nice substitute."
"My first offering from Yuengling. Poured out to a deep yellow / orange color with a small white foamy head that calmed down to a thin layer of bubbles over the surface of the beer. Medium level of carbonation. Aromas of brewery fresh ingredients was very enjoyable; malt, hops and grain were all light but notable. Taste was a definite step up from your typical light lager; flavors of lightly roasted malt, rich grain and some tea like lingering taste went very well together. Mouthfeel was pretty good, with the carbonation adding some crisp, zesty character. Good drinkability. I would have this over any other light beer out there today. Recommended for Light beer lovers. Special thanks to OldFrothingSlosh for the sample."
"Overall: I love this light beer. Best in the US for a light beer. An honest light beer. A touch weak in alcohol but a nice example of an American Light Lager. I like it."
"Drinkability - I don't want this again, ever. I could use it as a session beer, but at 2.75 abv, I might as well put a drop of Kirschwasser in a big glass of water. That would taste like water and get the same alcohol in my system. Since the carbonation numbs your mouth, it could be eaten with bad food. Some one could serve it at their dinner party to conceal the fact that their cooking tastes terrible. Other than that, this is best left on the shelves."
"Drinkability: This went down extremely well, but perhaps too well for what I expected out of this beer."
"12 oz bottle pours a clear, medium gold body with a one finger offwhite head that quickly dwindles to a thin wisp of collar. Aroma is nearly void, so I can't rate it as awful. Some faint grainess is barely noticed. Mouthfeel is very light bodied, with lots of crisp carbonation. Taste is watery and fizzy. Slight notes of caramel malt are easily balanced by subdued hops bitterness. Clean finish and aftertaste make this a decent ""lawnmower"" beer, but I don't see any point in trying this one again."
"Clean aroma on the nose , light graininess, faint hops. Tastebuds pick up a nice small hint how sweetnesscaramel, graininess and hint of hops. Very good drinkability.will I ever drink this again.I have no reason to drink this over the Traditional Lager."
"Drinkability: This goes down ultra easy"
"Philly town has plenty of other great micros. Turn this one down."
"Decided at first that I would pass on ordering any alcohol at a Pizza Pub and watering hole. However, I've enjoyed Yuengling's Lager and Black & tan's so i thought what the heck. The entire time I'm sipping, I am disappointed. Too much lemon flavor for a light beer---it's sad to say, but I would order a Miller Light instead of this next time."
"Light amber color, clear liquid with a soda-pop white head. It probably looks better than most light beers, but its not perfectly enticing. Faint malt aroma. Taste is grain-like and very dry. Not much hops, and certainly not bitter. Average to high carbonation. This is a middle-of-the road light beer. Notably pointless."
"Tastes alright for a light lager. Haven't had too many light lagers, but this one is OK. Watery in the mouth, sweet shallow malts. Tangy, soft, empty carbonation. Very clean aftertaste. I think I probably like Sam Adams light better."
"This beer smells like a farm. Head goes away quickly. The beer has a great amber appearance, but that is the only saving grace. Tastes okay. Mouthfeel is smooth. Drinkabliity is great considering the insulting ABV. Not worth it. I am not sure why Yuengling bothered to make this beer. It really isn't a good product."
"It's light beer that costs less than $5/ six pack and I'll be buying more of it."
"This is really an utterly worthless beer. I mean, what's the point of it being low in calories if you don't get *some* pleasure out of it? You're certainly not going to get a buzz at 2.7% ABV. I can give you a good ass-kicking that will be low in calories too, you might even bleed a ounces off. Is this a selling point??"
"I ended up at a cookout this evening, and there was nothing available to drink other than four kinds of macro-swill, Yuengling Light being one of the domestic varieties (along with Budweiser). The imported swills included Corona and Konigsburg. Instead of leaving and embarrasing my family, I took this as an opportunity to try some beers I had not had in over two years. I wish I had just left. I drank this straight out of the bottle, so I had no real sense of its appearance, but if the smell and taste were any indication, it would be weak. There was no aroma to speak of and taste was bland at best. In simplest term, this brew is worthless."
"The beer pours a nice golden color with a thick frothy white head that fades to lacing. The aroma is average. It has a dry musty scent with little malts and fewer hops. The taste is average also. It is light, dry, and musty with a very watery grainy malt make-up. It goes down easy, but lacks any real flavor. The mouthfeel is decent. It is an extremely low bodied beer with good carbonation. This is an average light beer. There is nothing special here. I found this to be dryer than most. It's one and done for me."
"Appearance: Copper golden amber forms a thin short-lived off white head no lacing left at all. Aroma: Mild grainy caramel sweetness touch of hops very bland all in all. Taste: An off graininess comes off a bit tart and bready with no finishing flavors, starts off a decent sweetness then boom nothing not aftertaste nothing there, water. Mouthfeel: Watery thin spritzy carbonation, can't believe they produce this beer. Drinkability: I guess you could drink alot of it 2.7%abv and watery mouthfeel, but why would you waste your time with flavorless beer."
"Taste has a better malt profile than I had expected. Lightly sweet and hints of nuttiness. Light hops finish. However, overall it is too watery and doesn't have much aftertaste. Very thin. Very drinkable though and as far as light lagers go, this one isn't offensive."
"This beer poured a caramel/amber color into the glass and was crystal clear and well carbonated. The head that was formed when vigorously poured was off white in color and lasted only a second then quickly fell to nothing not even a ring on the edges. No lace was resent. The aroma that came from the glass to be honest was a weaker version of the regular lager. I nosed light toasted malts, and some citrus hops. Again faint in the nose. The tastes that came over my tongue were light as well, some malts (sweet and roasted), light caramel, grains/husks, hops, and some bready dough as it finished. The aftertaste was light and wisps of corn and malt came forth as it warmed. The body was light. I am not a fan of the lager and choose not to drink it, the light is actually better and more easily drinkable. Not the greatest beer, but in a class of light beers this one stands above the rest."
"This is a light beer that you can pass off to your macro friends. It's decent for what it is and if you're going to drink light beer, then why not back these guys up instead of supporting the big dogs.Not the best light beer but very acceptable.At least they don't have stupid commercials with people hollerin' and yellin'!."
"This beer has good color, but a head which quickly disipates. The other characteristics can all be described as 'ok'. So, all in all, nothing special, but good for a light."
"Not really a light beer drinker, but gave this one a go. Ver carbonated, however the wite head had next ot no staying power. The smell was quite faint nothing really detectable there. Tastes ok, no hops seemed to be present, and if they were they must been hiding or something. Very watery, pehaps they just tool their lage and added some water? Ok for a light and nothing else."
"F."
"Defintely one of the better looking light beers, but its all about taste, which this doesn't seem to have. I'll take it any day over BudMillerCoors Light, but I'd also take a regular Yuengling over this."
"If for some reason you want to drink this beer, buy a case of the regular lager and 24 empty bottles. Proceed to pour half of each lager into an empty bottle and fill the rest up with water. Now you have two cases! Now the final step is to send me your leftover money. Beermail me and I'll give you an address."
"This rating is in comparison to other ""light"" beers... It has a clear carbonated light gold look. More color than most lights. It has a slightly sweet note to the nose (caramel). White head diapated quickly to a slight constant white sheen. Sweetish malt water taste with cardboard notes in the finish (oxidation). The mouth is quite full and smooth for a light beer. I gave it slightly above average marks because in comparison to the macro lights and the light imports this beer has more in the way of mouth, taste and appearance."
"Golden to amber in color, the held quickly melts into a coarse layer. The only aroma that I could pick out is something like caramel, but not a rich, malty caramel. Instead, this smelled very artificial, like women's caramel-scented shower gel. Husky tasting with little malt flavor. Hops, too, are light but appropriate considering the malt flavor. Tight carbonation and very light, but not watery mouthfeel. Overall, pretty boring but still one of the better light beers out there."
"Medium amber, light carbonation.  Crisp mouthfeel, slightly sweet malt character balanced by subtle hop bitterness.  Finishes slightly sweet."
"Here it is: Yuengling Traditional Lager is Yuengling Premium Lager with a caramel coloring called Porterine added. Same beer, different color. Yuengling Light is watered down Yuengling Premium Lager. Therefore, this is basically Yuengling Light with food coloring. There is nothing special about it. The Porterine does give a very slight flavor, but it's basically insignificant at this level. If you like the Light (and it's not bad compared to other lights) then you'll like this. Otherwise, forget it."
"In the world of light beers, this one is good.  There is actually some taste to it, albeit, not much.  Not as good as Sam Adams Light however."
