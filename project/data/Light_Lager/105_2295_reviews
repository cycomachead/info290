"For a light beer its not bad.  but then again just get high life full."
""
""
"Worse than the original champagne of beers"

"This an above average Light American beer. For taste, it may be the best tasting macrobrew Light American lager because the beer taste is there. Miller and Bud Light have almost no taste. Coors is sweet, but not a lot of beer taste. I think Miller High Lifw Light is a quality beer, and maybe best in its category."
"lets be honest....its highlife"
"Tastes awful. Serve cold so you can't taste."
"Crisp refreshing beer for a nice evening at home or out with friends."
""
""
"Tasters like a cross between Miller High Life and Michelob Ultra.  Mildly flavorful and yet superbly smooth.  Ice cold on a hot day this is hard to beat.  A real thirst quencher."
"Overall : For a light beer, this one isn't half bad. I still stand by High Life as being the better option, but if you're watching your waistline, this one ain't bad...just make sure you don't reach for two for every one of regular high life you'd grab normally because the flavor is missing. Defeats the purpose!"

"At room temperature, I'll pass.  But throw one in the freezer for awhile, and you will take out a decent tasting beer for those weeks when money's tight. Founders it ain't.   But it is one of the better BudMilloors products."

"O - Considering that I don't like light beers, this one has enough character to alert me to the fact that it IS a beer. Very smooth and drinkable. Refreshing, even. Miller wins again."

"Grab a 30 pack cans, put your snooty nose away and enjoy a few beers your dad had and wonder why this has not been in your rotation before."
""
"Overall: Hey, everyone has their opinions; but for my budget being what it is; and my propensity to gain weight if I'm not careful (among regular beers, without worries to price or calorie content, Miller High Life/Miller High Life Light would rank very far down my list), Miller High Life Light cannot be beat. Easily a 3.25 overall, maybe even higher."

"This beer is great for the beginner drinker. It is a very light and not too harsh of flavors for a beer. I recommend pouring this beer into a class to release some of the carbonation, it gives it better flavor and allows you to drink more. This beer has been around for a while, allowing it to be one of the classic beers, and a perfect transition to the new beer drinker."
"The first time i saw this beer it was on tap at a bar and it was a light yellow/gold coloring to it. I was not a big fan of the smell because it smelled a little malty and almost like it had gone bad. The taste was decent though, but maybe a little watered down because it was light."

"well welcome to another college beer with no taste, smell and overall flat mouthfeel. Great beer for college kids looking for $7 deal for a 12 pack. utterly disgusted to call this a beer. Being a DIPA lover, this is not my style. This beer is good for someone who needs a cheap beer...fast...and make sure to get tums for the morning. This guy does not sit well"

"Overall – Well what can you say. Nothing special or all that flavorful, if it wasn’t for the off flavors at the end of the taste it would have been much easier drinking and sessionable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Overall, it's a light beer that actually has some flavor. Better than any light beer I've ever had."
"The Champagne of Beers should not be done in a ""Light"" version."
""
""
""
""
"Over all: Not terrible for a light beer. I think it fits the style but it could have a little more flavor. I would drink this again."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Not too bad at all.. reminded me a bit of a better bud light taste wise. Light beers with a decent flavour have their time and place. This beer would work well for camping trips etc."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - ok for quaffing. Just a super plain lager with no standout flavors."
""
"If you haven't tried it and are looking for an everyday beer, pick up a six and try it. Having a good-sized party? It and Miller High Life (for your light-beer-adverse guests) are great choices and few people - if any - are going to turn them down."

"I can't sum this up better than my friend did. They took a light, inoffensive beer and somehow made it even lighter. At the same price as regular, there's no reason to buy this."

"The carbonation takes away from the overall drinkability. Honestly, this wasn't offensive in any way, but it lacked substance in every way."

"18 beers for under 9 bucks...it's hard to pass up. I'll hand these out to visitors who may not appreciate craft beer...i'll even have a few myself to curb my spending on better beer."

"High life light is not as good as straight high life. It is a typical light lager american style beer. The color is yellow/gold clear with big carbonation and head to start and then fades to nothing. The smell and taste are common to theis style....grain/barley/wheat and some hops. The mouthfeel is what it is....beer that has a lighter abv and taste. Overall its great for hot days."
"Overall- For an adjunct, it really was not that terrible, but who are we kidding, it is still an adjunct. I would never have it again."
"What can I say. This is a twist on an old school beer and it tastes...well...old school. I often drink lite beers when not enjoying craft brews but I would certinaly choose plain-old miller lite above this blend. A Little too much skunky taste to be the champagne of beers for me. Perhaps I got a bad six-pack."
"O - I can personally attest to the drinkability of this one. Friends and I used to put it down by the case for $1 while playing darts downtown a few years back. Shameful, but it's got it's place I suppose. The question is though, with 110 calories in this light beer, why even drink it?"
"Overall I'm pretty impressed. Taste is better than expected (for a light adjunct beer). This might be the best light beer I've had."
"High Life Original is my go to macro beer...why this travesty exists is beyond me. Pours a watery yellow with minimal head and not much character. Smells of pure grain and astringency. Flavor is really non existent with an off putting malt flavor and skunkiness making up the majority of the profile. Mouthfeel is very thin and the carbonation makes it seem even thinner. My least favorite of all light beers."
"D: Not for me. I love my wife's relatives for giving me the chance to try and review these gems."
"O - One of the better cheap light beers out there."
"Miller High Life Light has an incredibly thick, white head and a clear, straw color, with lots of carbonation and a surprisingly high amount of lacing. The aroma is breadier than other light beers, but the taste is as dull and watery as the rest, yet without that unpleasant mineral water aspect. A decent hop bitterness shows up, mainly in the aftertaste. The mouthfeel is light and watery, and Miller High Life Light finishes crisp, refreshing, and dry. Overall, this is a little better than the average light beer. RJT"
"Overall - For the price, you can't beat it. As a beer, it's horrible. As a light lager, it's about average -- which isn't really a good thing."
"So I guess that proves that there is a place in the world for ""light"" beers. I did try to find out how much of the stuff Miller brews. No luck, but it is probably on par with all of the beer brewed in Belgium."
"LOL at all the pompous beer snobs on here crying and giving this an F. What did you think this beer was going to be? It is a cheap light beer for when you feel like getting mashed. Go back to jacking off over your overpriced and over rated belgians. Nerds."
"D: Good representation of a popular style. The carbonation hurts the drinkability a bit, but body and ABV make this a chugger."
"Taste, not much there, carbonation, water and aluminum, have to wonder what this tastes like out of the can. Hops = nonexistant. Any flavor notes are all a turn off. Even regular high life seems miles superior to this. The only saving grace is that the actual flavor is so minimal, the negative aspects are at least diluted with lots of water."
"After trying one of these with some friends I made the joke that this should be called Miller Low Life because there is nothing about this brew. There is virtually no flavor at all it's almost clear in color with a slight tinge of yellow. Mouthfeel is far too light. This really shouldn't be a beer. It's sad that people enjoy these."
"A worthy change-up brew for the light-beer-inclined; the folks that refuse to step away from the American Adjunct Lager style."
"Pours with about one finger of head, which didn't stick around for long. It took longer than I expected to dissolve, though. The odor is your average ambiguously sweet, faint light beer aroma. The flavor is not very sweet at all, it's starchy and dry. High Life Light is thin and heavily carbonated; it won't impress anybody, but it's a good fit when you want one after another after another on a hot day."
"D: This is a pretty innocuous light lager. It tastes okay and there's nothing really wrong with it other than a lack of real substantial flavors."
"Not a bad choice, if you want an inexpensive, very drinkable light beer."
"Pours a clean/clear pale yellow color, nice carbonation, nice one-finger plus white head, with some sticky lacing left behind. The nose is slightly malty, with some corn notes. The taste is slightly sweet, malty/corny/ricy, a slight hint of hops. Light body. Not Drinkable, a nice little thirst quencher though."
"D: If youre on a diet its drinkable."
"D- Like carbonated water with skunk."
"D-I've had tonic water that had more going on than this insipid brew. I'ts filtered and pasteurized beyond recognition as beer."
"Drinkability: I only drink good beer and that does not include this brew."
"A good working in the yard on the car, cutting grass or hanging by the pool beer."
"Screw off cap and drank straight from the bottle. Clear yellow appearance. Lighter in color than the High Life original. Not much aroma to speak of. Very fizzy mouthfeel and light body. Very drinkable when you want a thirst quenching lawnmower beer. Me, I enjoy this at my desk after a hard day at work. No ""off"" flavors noticeable. At $5.99 a twelve pack in glass bottles, it's a steal."
"This taste has some corn, a bit of skunk, and also a bit of a metallic taste. Light bodied, thin and watery, and too much carbonation. This is just nasty. Thankfully I did not have to pay for this, it was offered to me at a get together."
"Overall: Nothing to write home about here. I like the Champagne of Beers but it's lighter counterpart is lacking. It's still better than Bud or Miller light though."
"Drinks good as long as it's cold, it's pretty watery. Really it's not bad, I was pretty surprised."
"Poured from a clear 12 oz. bottle. Has a very pale yellow color with a small head. Smell is mild, some notes of corn. Taste is also very mild, some hints of malts and corn, not much going on here. Feels light in the mouth and is very drinkable. Overall there is nothing special about this beer."
"My favorite cheap beer. Light but with a slight complexity of flavor."
"Drinkability - It would be very easy to drink several of these due to their lightness in texture/filling. Although, not a complex beer at all."
"Overall I will have to give it a pass, not worth the time on this one, things can get too light people."
"D: A little tasty even though it's not very flavorful, goes down quite easily since there isn't much to it and likewise it's not filling at all, very mild kick, long ago this was my inexpensive ""go-to beer"" and I still think it's one of the better fizzy yellow beers out there."
"D - Towards the end of the beer, all the flavor seemed to disappear leaving a watery beer. Not a good way to finish"
"I really don't enjoy this beer but it can be a necessary evil while in a social atmosphere. It's a nice beer if you're at a friends party or out at a local bar with the guys. However, it is by no means a sipping beer. I like it better than bud light. Needless to say, it's one of the better macro beers out there."
"While it's not especially good, i would pick this over almost any light adjunct. It is a light lager, after all. Really, though, it's better than any BMC light I can think of."
"D: C'mon, it's cheap, middle of the road taste, and made for mass and rapid consumption, I would buy again, when the shakes strike."
"Can't explain this atrocity. Just God awful and had to pour it out. It had the taste of heartburn going down and littered my throat with the feeling you get after drinking a lemony drink, like you have to spit or, at worst, throw up. Got some from a relative and tried to force three down. Couldn't do it and poured the last one down the drain. Funny thing is, I have one more in the second fridge and no one who comes over will drink it!"
"What this lacks in depth, flavor and character it makes up for in poundability. This is the one single beer that lacks anything except the pound-ability to keep up with the joneses: that is, if Jones is a total alky and nothing but sits in his garage, door open, and drinks beer all day."
"Overall: Ultimately, this stuff is an upgrade over Keystone and Natty and fits into the category of Busch Light."
"Drinkability - If you are looking for a beer to chug this is a nice way to go. But if you are like me and like to enjoy your brews then dump it out."
"This is the only cheap light beer worth drinking."
"@$.50 a can this is a bargain. And I like finding good bargains."
"A very nicely done cheap light beer. Picked up a 12 pack for $5.99 that was slightly past expiration. Great price, refreshing light beer that goes down easy. It even has more delicious alcohol than most light beers. It's mostly tasteless, but not offensive like Bud Light. Tastes mostly of corn with a bit of hops and maIts. It's only cheap light beer, but I like it."
"My pour produced a rocky, fluffy two fingers' worth of bone-white head with low retention. Color was a pale lemon-yellow with NE-quality clarity. Nose smelled heavily of cereal adjuncts. Oof. Mouthfeel was thin, sort of watery with a light lager sweetness accompanied by the all-too-familiar taste of cereal on the tongue. Finish was mild, almost flavorless. I CANnot get behind this one."
"Drinkability - This was refreshing and one of the better light beers that I've had."
"D: I drink this once a blue moon, when I'm strapped for cash, and calorie counts. See this beer gets low ratings, but its other light counterparts are equally as poor on the taste scale, why pay more? I'd pick this over coors light, or miller light any day."
"D: I drank a few and this isn't a truly awful brew. Certainly better than bud light and miller lite."
"D - for a macro light lager, not bad."
"Cheers!"
"D - I guess as far as light macro beer goes, this isn't the worst. Probably wouldn't be terrible at a cookout if nothing else was available."
"From the 12 fl. oz. bottle marked MAR0810-BO1200329. Sampled on December 17, 2009. Frankly, I cannot distinguish and difference between this one, Miller Lite, or Miller Genuine Draft Light 64. The pour is your typical pale yellow with buibbly carbonation and thin white head that sticks around longer than expected. The aroma is mildly malty but mainly corny and grassy. Thin mouthfeel. The taste is fresh enough for its style with a vague hint of hops at the end. But generally it is a typical mass produced pale. But it is a good way to save money while keeping the calories down."
"Has an average mouthfeel. With a bubbly finish. Tastes better than some other domestic brands on the market, especially for a light beer."
"It is what it is and that's a light beer, probably the best for the money. Miller got it right for this one. It's got a sweet taste with the perfect amount carbonation. Very refreshing even when at room temperature but much better cold (obviously)."
"Decent light lager, though the style itself lacks character. For the light lager drinker who actually wants a flavor besides water.... if there are any of those."
"I'm a closet fan of its big brother, mostly due to nostalgia, and choose it when pickings are slim or massive consumption is crucial. The light version lacks any hint of charm. If forced to drink a light beer, this wouldn't be it."
" i am usually a bit hesitant towards light/ lite beer ,but so far in my adventure in the world of beer i find this to be a good example of light beer."
"yes, i gave it high marks...but that's because this beer is what it's supposed to be, and then some. it destroys bud lite, coors light, and miller lite. you cannot beat this as far as a cheap, pound em down, refreshing beer. drink one after cutting the grass and you'll see what i mean. taste is a watery beer, great cold. smell is the usual from these kinds, drinkability is through the roof great. awesome beer...for what it is...a super cheap, super drinkable, average joe beer. and i hate this style, so that should tell you something."
"Taste is clean and definitely corn oriented. Highly carbonated and a touch sweet. It is not completely devoid of flavor, and I would even venture so far as to say it has more than the average light lager. I would rather have a MHL regular, but this is a finishable 16oz sample."
"Smuggled home from softball, this was a decent light beer, a little flavor but mostly an alternative to drinking water after playing sports."
"Don't buy it. Compared to any other light besides Corona, it tastes terrible. Just roll with the High Life regular, which is tasty for the price."
"Pours a light yellow straw color. The aroma is virtually missing, it smells slightly of alcohol and maybe some corn. The overall taste is bland, nothing on any note to it. It is watery and there is a hint of grains, but it is so small it isn't worth mentioning. The mouthfeel is fizzy and carbonated. Overall you could drink a lot of them but you wouldn't. Very simplistic."
"As beers go, this beer in very bland and boring. However as really cheap light beers go, this is great. One of the best of the really cheap beers. I definitely recommend drinking all Miller products from a can or tap - the clear glass bottles look great, but being hidden from the light makes this beer a fraction better."
"D - good, cheap session beer. not a bad beer to drink while grilling on a summer night...or just after having mowed the lawn."
"d: i can drink alot of these with no problem"
"I have a true soft spot for Miller, being my step-dad's brew of choice. And it's UAW made, which means somethign coming from a union family. MHLL is not a bad light beer--weak flavor, although certainly stronger than MGD 64, with a slight, pissy bitterness as an aftertaste. Simple, drinkable and refreshing. Nothing to challenge the palate, but nothing to overwhelm it either. The beer equivalent of a reading John Grisham--not an unpleasant way to spend time, but not exactly reading Ulysses either."
"Not bad for the style. It's not going to knock your fucking socks off but if you're at a party and you don't give a shit what you drink, grab a bottle of this if it's available."
"...Unfortunately, this is not one that I enjoyed. The tiny smidgen of smell and taste present are not very pleasant. This beer borders on foul, but the word that consistently comes to mind is ""shallow."" Not quite at the bottom of my list, but pretty damn close."
"A good example of a light lager. Flavor is crisp and unified."
"Very typical Light lager. I can drink' but would only do so when my options are limited."
"Now, I love the High Life. That being said, High Life Light is a true step down from the Champagne of Beers. It has not the flavor nor the rich color of High Life, and has a different, odd aroma. For some reason, this beer doesn't even feel that great in your mouth. Oh well, the High Life is the same price."
"Well a free beer can't be a bad beer can it? Looks like a golden yellow color egg white head with constant carbonation rising up the glass. Smells like a macro corny and nasty. Tastes like corn slightly bitter, but crisp. The lightness bugs the hell out of me, but it's high life, what do I expect. Not that great thank god I didn't pay money for it, but disgusting nonetheless."
"The beer appears a very light or pale clear yellow with a very light white head that dissipated rapidly. No aroma of note. The beer had a metallic taste to it, which was strange for a bottle. Very light grain taste and water. The beer was over carbonated and had a very light body to it. Considering that I buy the High Life from time to time, I figured that I might like this as well, but I was wrong. It appeared completely different from the High Life. I will be avoiding this one from now on."
"Overall I enjoy this beer, while it is not the best tasting, when comparing it to other similarly priced beers, it excels. Bang for buck, this is my light beer of choice. Especially if you are in college and tired of Natty, or Milwaukee's Best, or Keystone, this is your saving grace."
"Very pale yellow with a thick white head and a fair amount of lace. Almost non-existant aroma - Bitter and Slightly hoppy. Basically water however a little maltiness is detectable on the tongue. Very light and smooth. Not horrible for light macro , nothing too offensive"
"Pale yellow with a white cap of foam. It actually looks elegant in a gold-rimmed flute. The smell is only of grains and sugar. While I thought that this had a better taste and mouthfeel than Miller High Life it was still pretty poor. Unspectacular swill with no redeeming values."
"Drinkability: The best thing this beer has going for it. The light body and watery taste makes going through High Life far too easy. At $15 for a 30 pack, it is not bad on the wallet either."
"The champagne of beer's little brother, from the can. Very pale, fizzy high level of carbonation. Light corn smell. The taste is simple: fizzy seltzer, a touch of corn. Clean and dry finish, lacking in off-flavors. Super chuggable and refreshing. A reasonable approximation of High Life Heavy and definitely one of the best light beers."
"Sampled a couple out of the keg at an ox roast tonight, I like a cold High Life once in a while and the lite version is not too far off and better than most other commercial light beers. Not too much to get excited about but the couple that I had hit the spot. Faint aroma, light appearance with a good sizable head, somewhat full mouthfeel, solid flavor."
"This beer, other than a somewhat unpleasant aroma, is exactly what it's supposed to be, whether you like the style or not. I actually think it's better than some other light lagers, but not the best."
" ~ For a light brew this is a solid choice. It may be living the lighter side of the High Life but at least its the High Life."
"Light and fizzy, as expected - go figure... A bit slickish, but pretty clean. As long as it's cold, it's easy enough to drink on a hot day, if you want tasteless beer (with just a hint of sweetness). Fizzy, but not overly. I think that High Life is one of the better macros (if not the best), but this is just a waste of time - meant for those who look at carbs and don't want flavor, just ""easy drinking""."
"Well I bought a 30 pack at the asking of some guys helping to build my deck. I must say drinking this beer is like drinking straight soda water with a mild taste that I could almost swear was beer. The alcohol was welcome the ligthness was good for pouring concrete and carefully deconstructing the siding. Definately lawn mower beer, not something to drink to enjoy beer, but next time I'll stick to my lemonade and bourbon."
"Ah yes, I'm really living the high life now. A light lager in one hand and a garden hose in the other. This is an extra clear yellow with not much of a white head. Not much of a nose either. Possibly some corn water? The flavor profile is flat with again corn and some grains. A watery and fizzy body make me want to feed this to the flowers. I won't though in fear they might die. Chug, chug, chug."
"D: There is no aftertaste on this beer so it helps you forget about the slight sweetness that so many BAs find off putting. So it is drinkable, certainly does not drink good but drinks easily so I've giving it an average rating in this department."
"Pale yellow color, 1/2 in white head that left good legs on the pint glass. Very foamy even with a slow pour. This beer has a faint bitter smell, leaning heavily on hops. There also was a slight metallic smell. The beer was bland at best, not much flavor, mild hops, earthy taste at best. Not much to it, was left from a grill out so thought I would review."
"Almost invisible gold, if such a color existed. Ran out of good beer and needed one more to watch the postgame of the Super Bowl. If you are ever in a pinch and need that one last beer to get you through the night and don't care then this still shouldn't be it. Aside from no smell, there is a sharp adjunct tast and it is not smooth like most crappy macros at least. In fact, this dried out my tongue on the backbite (felt like a burn the first time). This could end up being the worst beer I've ever had, although that distinction is held for a certain light beer w/ incessant advertising and a malt liquor that made me sick."
"I wasn't paying attention to what I was doing and grabbed a case of these instead of regular High Life's...Boy was I sorry. Not a great tasting beer at all. I hate to describe a beer as skunky or as Piss but these fit the bill. I just couldn't get over the first initial taste and things just got worse from there. I'd avoid these like a screaming case of Herpes."
"Each macro does have a beer I can drink and if it's the only thing available I can enjoy. I was at a bar that only had macros and thought I was getting a Miller High Life. This beer had an off color, tasted like creamed corn soda or something and had a watery fizzy unpleasant mouthfeel. This is one I flat out could not drink. High Life itself is pretty light, no need to go lighter."
"que dire de cette bière blonde industrielle qui dans sa version entière est plus qu'ordinaire, dans sa version light c'est tout simplement aqueux, sans arrière goût, sans goût et sans intérêt. ça se boit tout même tout seul, avec le mal de tête en prime le lendemain."
"Not as horrible as I was anticipating... Being a big fan of regular Miller Lite, wasn't sure what to expect... similar to Miller lite, but to an ardent drinker of the brew, there were some noticeable differences that were apparent enough for me to not be too crazy about this one... Appearance and smell were very typical for a light lager, and the taste was about average, but I prefer many other lite samples compared to this one... another brew which forced me to take a tums after downing a couple... goes down pretty easily and smooth, but wouldn't cop another sixer of these... not even with the $3.69 price tag..."
"D: Easy to drink. Not offensive. Refreshing when very cold. Not my beer of choice nor one I would foist on friends."
"This is Corona at half the price. Not much else to say about the beer as you know what to expect. Nothing really stands out. It is definately a light beer with heavy carbonation. If you were to swill a beer this would be a good candidate at its price point. In fact this is my swill beer of choice, just don't pour it into a glass."
"D - I don't know how people drink this I have this bottle leftover from having a bunch of people over last night I hope one never gets left in my fridge again."
"High Life Light provides the light beer drinker with a little bit of flavor instead of colored seltzer water. With that said, of the quart I bought, I only consumed half of it tonight, and I don't know whether to consume the other half or use it to cook with in the future. Good thing for soda-like twist-on cap. Will the score of this brew be enough to hold off Tecate Light and Keystone Light? Tecate Light is next in line, happening tomorrow night."
"D- Drinkable if you are extremely hot or broke."
"I usually stick with the regular high life when buying cheap. The light is a good alternative, when the distributor is out of High Life, but I'd stick to the real thing when buying the schwagg."
"Could drink several of these"
"Wow this is not a good beer. But if you just want to drink and not spend a lot of money this beer is for you. At 6 dollars for a 12 pack of bottles its does the job its intended to do. Its also pretty good for quenching thirst after mowing the grass or working in the garage."
"Being a fan of High Life....this must once and for all prove that there is no 'good' light beer....not anywhere! Similiar to High Life only watered down. The adjuncts(corn mainly) bring the alcohol to the forefront...especially compared to reg High life. This is just a watered down version of High Life where the negatives get much worse and fast. Skunks easy...has to be cold...and you have to be thirsty. actually has some detectable hops...doesn't help it's detestable taste. Stick with High Life...it's in another ballpark. Skip a meal...whatever you have to do ...do not make this sacrifice..."
"Miller High Life Light pours a golden yellow with a thick head that leaves a nice lace as it falls. A little bit of sweet malt in the very mild aroma. Cooked corn and metallic hop flavors are most noticeable in the taste. Not as bad as that sounds though, pretty watery for the most part and the flavor isn't objectionable, so not too bad for the category."
"Acrid, stanky odor of adjunct-laden tripe, this carbonation fest hissed and fizzed in my mug like an Alka-Seltzer dumpted in an angry bowl of Rice Krispies. Where were are all those bubbles going? Surely not to the head, which was nothing more than a flat roof of transluscent white after two minutes' time. Taste was bitter, but not hoppy-bitter. Reminiscent of an sour aged stew of Minute Rice and foot. Not as sweet as I expected. Not ""Milwaukee's Best-bad," but bad enough."
"Opened this up after cleaning the apartment on a hot day, and for the lawnmower style, it did the job. It was inoffensive, kind of reminded me of beer, and quenched my thirst. The aroma was a little grainy, and adjunct filled. Drank cold, it tasted of very pale malts, but without any nasty fusel alcohol flavors. I wouldn't buy this, but I wouldn't refuse a free can on a sweaty day."
"D: A good beer to chug and quickly move on."
"Pretty highly carbonated, but easy to drink. The poor man's Corona. For 6.99 a 12 pack, you can't beat it as a college student. Its better than any of the more expensive macros such budweiser, miller lite, and coors, and is much cheaper. Not recommended as a beer to enjoy with dinner or anything like that, except maybe at a BBQ. For beer snobs that review this w/ all the ASTMD standards, come off it. I enjoy quadrupels, tripels, brown ales and many other nice styles of beer, but this is a good beer to have a good time with and little else."
"when i didn't know any better about good food, beer, or health i used to get the cheap 30 packs of this crap to save calories...not much different than any other macro light. better than bud light as i used to prefer the corn adjuncts to the rice adjuncts. if you don't already know this is pale fizzy tasteless crap then you need to get out more often."
"This in one of my essential ""garage"" or ""lawnmover"" beers that I keep around the house. It has a straw almost see-through color. It pours watery thin with a very white head. Some hop flavor but not much. it is 5.99/12 pack! u cannot go wrong with that."
"Poured out with a head that reminded me of overwhipped egg whites, over a very very pale yellow. Smell and taste are pretty neutral, there's some sulferous notes in the nose and a touch of grainy malt in the mouth but nothing which could be offensive (not to mention flavorful) Carbination was just right with a clean finish."
"Nothing poetic here out of a 24 oz can. Decent light straw/gold color. Not much head to speak of, but I'm a contrarian and hate to drink beer through foam. Grainy and sweet on the nose. Thin, simple, and clean on the tongue with again more grain than anything. Only the barest hint of hop, which is fine by me. Coarse carbonation detracts from the quaff. Overall, my favorite of the plain, industrial, light lagers. Great with various ethnic soul foods/fast food. Can be hard to find in the SF Bay Area. Easier to find around Tacoma, WA, but then I'd be drinking Rainier instead."
"overall this is not a very good brew, kinda of makes me feel sick, too much carbonation"
"good over the average of light beers for me; but its taste let me many to desire; i read about the reviews from this beer and is poor in general their impression; i try direct from the bottle: a blonde and deepy color; poor head; good for women; mi wife try with tamales; i recommend 55%."
"D: Certainly can be put away in rapid succession, which I suppose is the point."
"Appears...after pouring from a 24oz can into my 1/2 liter mug the pale golden body flourishes to arise with large bubbled thick bright white head textured cloudily with fluff, dwindling rather quickly and leaving behind scant lacing. Aroma has a light cooked vegetable sweetness with grainy offness and sadly no real hop note to be found like other mass produced American Light Lagers. Flavors, more cooked veggies corn and rice with a pretty rough grainy offness mild sweetness and minimal bittering from hop flavor. Mouthfeel thin watery texture with high un-natural carbonation please steer away from this brew, regular High Life is much better in terms of style. Drinkability, yes you can drink alot of it but don't do it to yourself."
"Really the best of the typical light beers I've ever had (barring things like Shiner Light which is a totally different take)."
"Love the packaging! Really nice. Of course I've always liked the packaging for the regualr High Life. Anyway, it pours the expected crystal-clear straw-gold body beneath a short head of bright-white foam. The retention and lacing are average. The nose is clean, and limited to some mild malt with an edge of hops. I'd say that it's a ""generic"" beer aroma, but it's actually better than that. The flavor is, again, clean, and it expresses the same malt and hops that the aroma does without any change. The fact that you can clearly taste the malt and then the hops is nice though, all too often in light beers they meld into one. Well balanced. I'm not sure you can ask too much more of an American light lager. Better than Miller Lite in my opinion."
"Overall, its like refreshing sparkling water in a can!"
"All and all not a whole lot here, compared to High Life it is more carbonated, has less substance and taste and simply doesn't stack up. The extra 35 calories in a High Life are well worth it for the taste that is sacraficed in High Life Light."
"Overall a very good value in a light American macrobrew light. Very good."
"Cheers!"
"Drinkability- this is the only reason why I drink it, I can drink them all night long"
"Pours a pale yellow color, with a large creamy white head. Falls to lace quickly. Smells of sweet malt, and wheat. Taste is sweet with a nice stingy malt/hop wave. Not exceptional though. Drinkability is alright for a light beer."
"12 oz can. Pours a very light straw color with a nice 3 finger head, from an aggressive pour, that settles at a light coating over top, with a island of chunky head as well. Clarity is brilliant, and there are very few bubbles working their way out of the beer after it settles down. Aroma is big on corn sweetness, with not much else going on in there. Very one dimensional. Flavor is much the same, with a light corn sweetness, and nothing else. Mouthfeel is very light, with a fairly light carbonation as well. As far as drinkability goes, this one is one of the better American macros in my book. It does not have the grainey character I find in bud products, and the corn sweetness is not bad, just not what I necessarily want in a beer I am drinking to enjoy. I grabbed these beers to drink while tossing a frisbee around with some friends, and it was very nice on a very hot day. This is one that I would want to keep around for friends that are not into craft beer, and wouldn't even try one if offered. I could handle finishing the leftovers of this one."
"D - Drinkable because it is light, but not really flavorful."
"As poor as it is, it is still the best light lager I have had thus far."
"Good job Miller High Life Light"
"It's an old classic in the ""light"" version. The self-named champagne of beers. Now not so premium, but in the bottom of the cooler at albeit a bargain price. Mildly sweet corny smell and a consistant lager taste. Slight bitterness but consistent throughout from start to finish. Good carbonation. Not a unique beer for the demanding coniseur's taste, but ice cold is a great way to refresh a hot summer day. Brings back lots of memories of tall blondes. A summer sessioner without a doubt. I can drink this all day or all night long (or both). I see they've even bumped up the AC a tad."
"Drinkability - Something about this beer rubs me the wrong way. The taste isn't overtly offensive, but I get the feeling that a few of these in a row wouldn't sit right. Probably because it's overly sweet. There's really nothing to recommend this beer over any other macrolager light."
"Cooking went well. I went with a Miller for the corn sweetness."
"Poured a pale yellow color with large white opuffy head that rapidly fell to a thin coating. Smell is slightly sweet with a generic beer scent. Taste is also very light , as would be expected. It's better cold and as it warms it become less bearable. Good ice cold as a lawnmower beer, or a hot summer day."
"($5.49 / 12 pack)"
"It's better than I expected, comming from a American Macro Brewer and carrying the label 'Light"". It's not far from other Miller products. More flavorful than the Miller Lite, but much less flavorful than MGD Light. No real flaws to the beer, but not wonderful either. Typical cereal grains, corn, and husk flavors and textures. Lightly malty, but mostly vegetal to the nose. Watery and weak into the finish. Easy to drink though. Although I could drink a few of these durring the game, I don't prefer to."
"Tried it on-tap at the local hick-bar awhile ago. Sucks to be broke, stuck drinking down this crap. Looks awful. No foam at all, ever. Looks flat and watery. I cant notice even a touch of real carbonation. Did somebody put an ice cube in my beer? The smell is grainy, watery, crappy. Ditto on the taste. It actually doesnt really taste like much, making it quite easy to drink if you're in need of a quick buzz. The mouthfeel is watery, but atleast it goes down easy. There is a touch of carbonation, differring from what the appearance led me to believe. Anyways, pretty shitty, but if you're low on cash it will do the trick. In my opinion its atleast a hair better than regular High Life."
"Run of the mill light beer. I'm a fan of Miller Lite... so I decided to spend a few dollars and check this out. Not bad...not great either. It's a great buy for the money, though. If I was still in college and on a strict ""beer budget"" this would be the beer of choice. Thank goodness, though, that I'm not and that I can buy better beers. I'd say it's about average. As I said... Not bad, but not great either. Don't get me wrong... I bought a 12pk for $5 and change...I enjoyed all $5 worth. There are better beers out there, though."
"Pours extra pale straw with excellent clarity. Soapy three finger head shows nice retention, and even some sticky lacing. Cereal and grain nose, mostly clean. Hop flavor is almost nonexistent, but manages to balance the thin adjunct flavor. Watery body and lively carbonation that is both streaming and oversized bubbles. The clean finish and smooth mouthfeel suggest a cheap session beer, but it lacks enough flavor to keep your interest."
"Can provided amid a bunch of stuff given to me for volunteering at 2005 GABF. Uhm, thanks guys, I really appreciate the opportunity. The stamp on the bottom of the can reads 12195 E11825. Pours a finger and a half white fizzy soda-pop-like head over a crystal clear very light straw colored liquid. Smells corn, cardboard, and a hint of a dark floral hop. Tastes carbonation acrid with some sweet and actually some noticable hop floral in the aftertaste. Other flavors consist of iron...and that's about it. Light mouthfeel and heavily carbonated. Not much to say except that this could only serve as a lawnmower beer and there are many other beers I'd choose for that purpose over this one."
"I've put away many a High Life in my day, and although it's not a great beer, it's a very DO-able brew, I believe. It's just unique, and it's an old-time Americana beer, too. The light is not bad...not great either....but not bad. If you drink light beer...why pay all that money for OVER-ADVERTISED swill, when you can have an UNDER-ADVERTISED swill that tastes better for LOTS less moolah? I paid $13.99 for a 30pk (on sale). Not bad, considering. Oh, and they changed the cans since I had it a couple years ago. I know, I know...that doesn't make the product TASTE BETTER! But it is pretty. Enough of this..I have beer to drink. (Burp..sorry. It's a fizzy brew that gets the belches out!) Drink up light drinkers! CHEERS!"
"Just an average light beer here. Not atrocious, yet nothing grand. I would have to class it well above bud light. At 4.5 it's slightly higher alcohol than most light beers, but isnt noticably harsh. Very light pale taste, bland almost lifeless smell."
"I'll try something much better before the weekend is over..."
"Another ""well, its in the house, might as well try it beer."" Actually, for a light macro, this wasn't all that bad. Some of the characteristics of the regular Milller High Life are present, but the grainy nature is reduced quite a bit. In its place is a slightly tart, mildly lactic acidity. Finish is clean. Mouthfeel is, as one would expect, light and fizzy. A typical ""beer soda"" but I'd take this and MGD light over most of the pack."
"Once again, we have a clear winner. There's not much difference between the way these beers look, smell and feel in the mouth, but there's a noticeable difference in how they taste. Miller High Life Light: fair at best, bad when semi-warm. Michelob Light: nasty at best, spew-inducing when semi-warm. Miller shouldn't be too proud of today's victory since High Life Light was simply the lesser of two evils."
"This is drinkable as in water. There is nothing offensive about it and it is one of the better light American mass produced beers, but it isn't a good beer. I could drink this if I had too but there are many better beers."
"Not very good. Not very good at all. If you follow my career here at BeerAdvocate, I started as a Freshmen in college. Recently I've purchased my own business, and became relatively wealthy. If you were to have asked me two years ago would I like this beer, I would've said, ""it'd be great for beer pong or flipcup."" My horizons have expanded, and I do not recommend this for anything but that. There is very little taste, the only thing that is good about this beer is that it comes in a 30 pack for about 12 bucks, and for cheap college students, you can't beat that...unless of course your drink your own vomit. Which I might just add, has a very similiar taste."
"I used to drink this beer on a daily basis. I have fond memories, but not of it's world class taste :) It pours the standard light golden color and has a decent white head and a ton of carbonation. It smells sweet and corny, but not too overpowering like some macros. The flavor, well what little there is to be had, is clean, with a touch of corn. No hops, faint malt and nothing offensive. A good cheap beer that goes down easy. All of that said, it will be a long while before I ever buy it again and I thank my little sister for giving me this beer."
"Take care of yourself and the environment - pour these on your lawn. Your grass will love the stuff."
"Talk about no filling!!!"
"Doesn't seem any worse than any of the other light beers...really hits the spot nicely when thirsty...Some day I will do a blind taste test with 8-to-10 of the light beers and see how it turns out...for now this seems as good or bettr than any other than Sammy Light and a couple others..."
"Why waste money on light beer? This is as cheap as anything else out there, and it's a whole helluva lot better than, oh, Southpaw. Tastes more like beer than a Beck's Light too (just finished a 12 of that off yesterday)."
"It's appearance, when compared to its counterparts is average. It pours very light yellow with a thin head. It smells like a bowling alley or an aluminum can recycling center --take your pick. But honestly, it pretty much smells like corn. The taste is almost non-existent, when compared to crafted brews. But, compared to light versions of macro-lagers, it's better than average. Mouthfeel is mostly that of carbonation. It's easy to drink, but I can think of only two reasons to drink it: being broke or trying to add a new review here."
"Not a good beer, nor will it ever be."
"I really like the champagne like appearance this beer has ;) But with that there's nothing much about this one. Very light but not as light as the other macro low carb crap. Slight sweetness but its lacking much else. The high carbonation gives this beer a little life but I'd say stick with the regular high life."
"Now, there are not too many things that could wipe the grin off my face besides this beer. To be totally honest, the taste is something that I have never come across in a shitty beer. Compared to regular high life (actually Ok in the macro world) this was like an old horse that needed to be shot!"
"other light macros."
"Taste: I'm sorry, what was the question? Water has more character, and is more refreshing...transparency exploded exponentially, this is a ghost of a shade of a whisper of a beer...soggy, corny, utterly vapid....body is lightness to the max, finish is nothing, taste doesn't count...a waste...why drink this? Why? If anyone has the answer, please don't hesitate to inform me...I live to learn..."
"Very much like it's regular counterpart, this is still a clear gold color, with not much of a white head. The same corny sweetness of High Life regular, only with a ligher, more diluted flavor. It is still bad beer, that makes my stomache queasy every time I think about it (due to their ad featuring a man gorging on deviled eggs, and having to switch to light beer so he can choke down more food). One of the less quality light macros out there."
"F."
"I don't mind the regular Miller High Life but the light is just not my cup of tea. Maybe next time?"
"Pours to a sudsy white head and unbelievable (for a cheap ass beer) retention and lacing. Aroma is sweet corn adjunct and carbonated water. Mouthfeel is bubbly, watery. Flavor is a very light typical American light beer taste but with the added bonus of a bit of extra bittersweet bite. Finishes clean and slightly bittersweet. Not offensive, just very lacking in most aspects, except for appearance and drinkability, which were better than expected."
"Actually not a bad Light lager..better than Sam Adams light and for 95 cents a 24 oz can its not too bad."
"I gave Miller High Life Light a try because I thought the regular version was pretty decent stick with that one if you want a yellow fizzy beer."
"Truly insignificant beer."
"The beer pours pale and light with very little head. The aroma is corn, sourness, and a slight sugary sweetness. The taste is watery with some corn sweetness and a slight hop bite. All in all this is about as low as I am willing to go anymore. There must be worse beers out there, but I hope I never run across them"
"OKAY so its macro-swill, but its the low cal version of the best macro-swill available. High Life Light is thin and watery but actually sort of has a flavor. Well okay, so its isn't so much a flavor as it is a lack of bad taste. In fact its more like a lack of taste. F+ beer. I've had worse, much worse in fact but I'm not proud of it."
"What can I say, this beer gets a lot of bad reviews, but I was impressed. Kinda of a drinkable, cornish flavor. Went down smooth. Like I said, hints of corn all over it, almost too much, but besides that, a really decent beer. I would reccomend this beer to the people that are curious to try new beers, but to a veteran, this beer could be bad."
"Basically a more watered down and flavorless version of High Life, if that's possible. Pale yellow in appearance with a white head. Aroma consists of some malt and alcohol. Thin mouthfeel. Bland taste consists of grain, corn adjunct, a feint hop bitterness and light alcohol. High Life Light is somewhat similar to Miller Lite in flavor. Nothing special here."
"I tried this as i was on a beer diet and only would allow myself light beers. As i had been drinking High Life for sometime, i tried the light version. It's similar, but lacks the sweet flavor that many find attractive in the regular version. It's not too high in alcohol, as i didn't start feeling the ""high life"" with this one until i had nearly 6 under my belt. Nevertheless, it's an interesting brew, and worthy of a try."
"the champagne of water. this is closer to aquafina than beer, so i guess you know what i am gettin at. basically all the flavor of high life is drowned out. you can't really taste anything, so it goes down."
"Never see commercials for this for a good reason. I don't think anyone drinks it and it has a shelf life of 10+ years. Do an experiment. Make a mark on a bottle at your local beer store. Go back in a month, no 3 months. It will still be there. It is light colored and has no taste. Please Miller, just deep six it."
"Well, they actually did a decent job of retaining most of the taste of Miller High Life.  It does a better job there than MGD Light matching up with regular MGD.  High Life Light is still a light beer, but its not awful."
"a lighter version of regular high life it is...after that it's not too good.  i actually have become a fan of high life in the last year or so....but i don't like light beers and this one is no exception.  please don't bother...if you dislike high life....stay away from the ""light"" version.  it's pretty much swill."
"O.K.  Why bother.  I don't care for regular High Life and this contributed to my High Life dislike.  Very watery with a chemical-type aftertaste.  I know High Life and its cousins are near and dear to some, but folks, this is not a good beer."
"Nice fresh appearance with moderate head. First taste of of grain and maltiness.  Very ordinary, but well suited for guzzling on holidays with friends.  Miller constantly makes a brew better than the other macros.  This one is no exception."
"The color and carbonation are the best points for this beer.  Begins with a solid foamy head that disappears very quickly, with a bit of lace throughout.  Hoppy aroma along with an odd chemical smell that I am hard pressed to describe.  Overall, very little taste, other than the hoppiness, its just like carbonated water."
"Rather light aroma that is mostly hops at first, then fades to nothing.  Medium foamy head that dissipates but leaves rings in the glass.  Yellow-gold color. The taste is largely the bitterness of the hops and the carbonation (if that has flavor).  Otherwise pretty watery with a slight quenching finish."
