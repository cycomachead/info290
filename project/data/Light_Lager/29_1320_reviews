review_text
"I rated this in comparison to other light beers. Obviously it tastes like piss water compared to stouts and pale ales. But as far as the pretty new light beers go, this one isn't the worst."
"Rating to style.  You think it tastes like water?  What AAL/light lager doesn't?  And if you think it tastes like piss I have no perspective because that is a flavor profile I'm not familiar with."
""
"In my opinion the worst of the shitty light beers"
"Gross. taste like someone put water in there beer and shook it up. rather just drink water"
"would rather just not drink"
""
"Favorite light beer so far"
""
"I thought maybe drinking this by the pool in the hot Florida sun might make this beer a little bit tolerable. (The choice was this or Corona without a lime (if it had been w/lime I would have opted for it)).  I was wrong.  I honestly felt like I wanted to puke after finishing my 16 Oz blue aluminum bottle. If I never drink another one of these for the rest of my life,  I will definitely be cool with that."
"Worst beer ever, drink yueng ling instead... Same price, better beer."
""
""
""
"Beer pong beer. That is all it is"
""
"Nasty. When I like to feel like trailer trash I drink this"
""
"It looks like beer, but it tastes like liquid cardboard. I have no idea why so many people choose this over the many better (and cheaper) alternatives."
""
"This beer tastes like celery."
"Blah blah blah blah beer"
"Party beer. Nothing more, nothing less"
"This ""beer"" is awful.  Just plain bad."
"Brew pours a pale straw-yellow in color with a pretty thin white cap. Some sheets of spotty lacing was seen when sipped. The aroma is really nothing to mention, just some light grassy grains. The taste is pretty much the same. Very watered down with not much taste. Ends with a slight metallic taste which might or might not be from the aluminum bottle. Light-bodied with above average carbonation. Why I drank some of these over the years before I discovered some good brews and brew-styles is beyond me. Overall. why bother to drink this, no matter what fancy/cool bottle they use. This is a below average brew in my opinion."
"Ok so it's really bad,  but it's the best of the worst."
"Syrupy piss water if I've ever tasted it"
"It's a very flavorless beer that you straight up shouldn't drink."
""
"It's an okay beer, would rather have a Coors Light"
"omg...this is ridiculous so much"
""
""
"Decent for cheap price beer"
"Watery beer with no taste"
"Bland, taste like water with a little bit of hop in it. Felt nauseous when I drank it, coupled with the taste of rotten wheat in my mouth."
""
"Pure piss. Only drink it when there's nothing else."
""
""
""
""
""
"cheep easy beer if you want to get drunk and not enjoy your beer drink this"
""
"Cheap drunk strictly lake beer for your buddies. :)"
"This is an average beer - a cheep way of being able to drink all day. Besides making you go to the bathroom a lot, it is ok."
""
""
""
"it taste a like a well hydrated horse took a piss"
"It's drinkable.. If you drink beer you drink beer. It is what it is. Beer snobs just LOVE to hate this beer"
"why even bother with this."
"Absolutely one of the worst beers"
"See review of Budweiser. This is beer for washing down hot dogs at a ball game, nothing more and nothing less. I've never met a beer I didn't like, there are just varying degrees of amiability. Bud Light is like an acquaintance I don't mind getting drunk with once a year."
""
""
"O: I don't personally like the style, but for what this is, it's well made;"
"O:  Bleh."
"Great for micheladas but meh"
""
""
"It is what I like.   Is that so bad?!"
""
"I wish this wasn't produced.  This is the garbage people try and then think ""oh I don't like beer.""  This isn't beer."
"Sometimes you happen to like consistency..."
"Awful schmegma. For the 3 years post college when you're still stupid"
"Great daily beer."
"This is the best beer I've ever had!"
"Bud light what do you expect"
""
"I actually don't find this to be a terrible beer. It's nothing good by any means, but it's not bad. Definitely better than the regular version. However, there are handfuls upon handfuls of better alternatives."
"What else is there to say, it's bud light"

"O – Despite the prominence of the adjunct corn, this is not the horrible swill it’s made out to be.  Its main flaw is that it basically lacks any notable beer character.  This is pretty fresh and goes down easy, meaning it’s not the worst thing to drink, ice cold, on a hot day."
"its awful, cheap tasting beer"
"Best beer ever. i'm a redneck and we all love this beer. Wish I could make sweet love to it."
"Had the misfortune of showing up to a meathead party that only had this offering. Took about 3 sips and had to dump it.. absolutely horrid.... i feel sorry for anyone who thinks this is good beer"
"Even worse than bw. And that's saying a lot"
"Why bother. It looks the same coming out as it did going in."
""
"Super popular & watery adjunct lager with no further description needed."
"This is not beer and its terrible"
""
"Almost no aroma and the taste is essentially watery and slightly sweet with no hop presence."
""
"Water will do the trick, this beer is watered down a lot"
"ehhh..... Not good at all, not not bad."
"A great casual beer To drink with friends"
"Take Budweiser, the watered down beer that helped gave North American beer a bad name for many years piss in it and drink it.  That's what Bud Light tastes like.  Even looks a pale, foamy light yellow like someone pissed in a glass of Budweiser..."
"one of the sorriest excuses for a beer in around"
""
"I once pissed a mixture of Gatorade, Milk and Bud Light. I bottled the urine stream into an old Bud Light bottle and served an unexpecting ex-girlfriend.  She couldn't tell the difference.  I think she even got a lil krunk from it."
"Typical American adjacent lager. Light smooth flavorless and not worth a full review. Decent for a camp fire or bbq if you in to watching your calorie intake."
"Many people claim this beer taste like piss to which I ask: tell me how you know what piss taste like again?"
"gross, closer to seltzer water than beer. Their slogan is up for whatever because you literally have to be up for whatever to drink this"
"Grew up on this stuff, which is probably the only reason I ever drink it now.  Good for learning, that is about it.  I'd put Miller Light a bit higher."
""
"I don't particularly drink light beer. I was given a six pack of 8 ounces bottles as a gift. It is drinkable, especially after a workout."
"Terrible!  Very light and no flavor"

"Serving Type: On tap"
"Urinate in a can and commence drinking.....there --- you have Bud Light"
"I rated slightly higher than Miller light as I preferred bud light for a while, but I'm proud to say that I no longer have any in my house."
""
"Their tag line should be: ""Why Europeans think Yanks don't understand beer."""
""
"So overall would I recommend it ? F*** No !! This is a peace of s***."
"Served too cold to smell/taste how awful it is."
""
""
"It's ok for beer pong..."
"Overall : Fresh dirty water."
"I'm embarrassed to say I've ever drank this crap."
""
"awuful bottom line.  no reason to drink this. hamms is cheaper"
"As far as light beer goes (hardly being beer at all) this is... Passable..."
"Quite possibly one of the worst beers ever"
""
""
""
""
"Frat parties and kegs, college, yep thats Bud Light"
""
"Just good old fashioned American light beer."
"I give it credit for what it is, a very drinkable and refreshing beer for when your say... drinking with people who don't care what they're drinking. Its the cheapest beer i'll buy. Doesn't have a lot of taste, but its very drinkable. Almost anyone will accept a bud light and willingly drink it."
"Looks great, but not a lot of taste but very drinkable and pretty much everyone will drink it."
"i dont care what anyone says i love this beer"
"very upset that I was brain washed by this ""beer"" company into believing that this was the only choice of beer. Rice is not a beer ingredient."
""
"Mmm.. Gotta love small town bars that refuse to have ANY alternatives.. Really good when you get to the 12th or 13th one!"
"Tastes like fizzy water with a hint of malt and skunk."
""
""
""
""
"its a diet beer, for the style it is not great. It is unbalanced, you can taste the alcohol, I believe that derives from the adjuncts used."
""
"Not a great style,  but definitely a great example of the style."
""
"Did is a brew is drink"
""
"Used a Pilsner glass. Pours a light golden color with super thick head that thins to a quarter inch. Smells like chemicals and corn. Goes down really smooth, but dry. Not much flavor what so ever. For a light beer it's not too bad."
"Ehhh not bad for this kind of beer"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"My point being that, for me, the fact that you can drink endless amounts of this beer and never get drunk or gain a pound isn't a point in its favor."
""
""
"Overall: I am not sure what accounts for the popularity of this rotten piss water.  This is truly some of the worst stuff I've ever endured.  And don't tell me that it's popular because it's cheap.  There are any number of cheap alternatives that easily beat out this awful slop.  I felt obligated to try it because... because... you know, I forgot a long time ago why I even ordered this.  Well, now at least I can say from experience that this beer is not worth drinking.  That's the booby prize, I suppose."

"Boring and bland for sure. Not a lot of flavor.  Busch light is better.  Busch light is my lawn mower lager in the summer time. Bud light doesnt tank simply because it is one of the easiest beers to drink period. Supreme drinkabilty takes this beer where it needs to be. Comparing this to other BMC beers, this is better than coors, mainly because of the metallic taste present in coors light. Miller lite is a little stronger flavor. For what this beer sets out to be, which is a bland boring beer with very little taste, it reigns supreme. This is for people who just want a hint of beer taste. This isnt really something i would compare to Sierra Nevada or Sam Adams.  Its just a light beer. This is one of the best party beers in my opinion. Sam Adams Boston Lager was my first good quality beer. i've had so many beers i can't really remember which one i had first. had to have been SA Boston Lager or Blue Moon Belgian white. Then my 3rd one was Bud light. I actually enjoy Bud light. I have nostalgia with Bud. Its been me and my buddy's fishing beer and party beer since 2 years ago. Lot of memories. The alcohol wasnt what made the memories, its the being with friends all having a good time. the fact it was Bud Light just makes me like this beer. May not be good compared to real flavored beer. Its just my official party beer. You bring in the bud light,  its usually my first 30 pack finished at the party, followed by the coors light and bud light lime. People i party with also love corona. Pretty much, you will find this at any party worth a damn, or Alternatively Miller lite or Coors Light, or Busch too. I've brought busch, we're talking southern parties in corn fields with bonfires. brought some busch light and some bud light, and it was a good night. Any party worth anything at all will have bud coors or miller, or maybe busch, but other than that none of the off brand products. This is the supreme party beer for beer pong. Some good times partying with this beer. Still, lot better things out there. Just advertising makes this sell so well."

"I will not drink this beer unless there are no other choices."

"This beer has its time and place, and is definitely better than no beer at all."
"For a light beer it's okay but it's really not good..."
""
"I have never thought that it's so great, but nor I think that it's so awful, it's a good choice to drink on a weekend night while watching something with your friends or family, specially because here it usually have discounts, such as 24 beers for 8 USD."

"This swill is just above Natty Light. And I mean JUST. Only because I don't feel like I just drank old well water after it goes down. Don't understand how it's so popular. Would never buy."

"I marked this as want... I can't find this ANYWHERE. It's so polarizing that I've got to try it. If only momma could lend me the keys to her mini van so I could drive into town to find it.... looks like it's toilet wine again"

"Why are you reading reviews for this? You know what bud light tastes like. The fact that their selling point is ""drinkability"" with little else mentioned already tells you everything you need to know. It's cheap light beer that accomplishes exactly what it's trying to accomplish, it goes down easy."

"It's drinkable, but it's hardly a beer. If ""camo"" is one of your favorite patterns to wear on your everyday attire, then you'd more than likely go gaga over this carbonated urine."

"Looks reasonably like a beer, but no smell or feel to speak of, and next to no taste.  A reasonable substitute for water.  Only offensive in its lack of ""beerness""; it doesn't taste unpleasant- it just doesn't taste at all."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I like that it came served in a Patriots Bud Light glass. I gave this beer a legit shot - I drank it with hot dogs while watching sports - effectively handing it home field advantage. But it's just bad. There's no reason to drink this as long as tap water remains free."

"This isn't bad, but really nothing going to speak of. Its flavor, or lack thereof is the reason  so many people like this. In my lineup of Light beers, This doesn't get a metallic taste.  People on here tell people to start with the strong beers. Trust me, my cousin did that and he hates beer now. Start on something light. People say don't let bud light be someones first beer. Honestly when you first start drinking beer, you want something with a little flavor but nothing too strong. The reason i say this, is i started with blue moon. I almost hated beer from the beginning because i tried something so strong. Then, my friend gave me a bud light. I took a drink. It was nice and refreshing and didn't overwhelm me with flavor.  It was good. The reason people buy bud light, and its the number one selling beer in america, is because it doesn't offend. Its light, doesn't have much flavor and is really refreshing. Nothing to speak about, but nothing that offends either. It gets a three out of five. Its an average macro lager."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"That being said it's very watery, no real great flavor, Coors light is a better beer, but both are bad. Do yourself a favor spend a little bit more of money or less quantity for a better beer. You might as well be drinking water with a nasty taste."
"Generally inoffensive. Light in body and high in carbonation. Out of all the macro lagers this is my least favorite."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Unpalatable!  Worst beer i can think of with the exception of warm Honduran beers in clear glass bottles.  The gray water from rinsing out my morning oatmeal bowl has more grain flavor than this swill.  This isn't good even if its free!  Friends shouldn't let friends drink shitty beer!!"

"Not a huge fan of light beers. This I'm favorite of the lot smooth velvety finish"
""
""
"Overall Impression: Drink something else"
"You may never complain about the quality of free beer. Temperature of said beer remains an open subject."
"Far from the best tasting beer, I feel guilty admitting that this beer has a special place in my heart when I have to play a concert - I can drink a few without getting truly drunk, just perpetually buzzed.  Obviously not the brew of choice for beer snobs..."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall (2.07) : I know why people buy this stuff, it's because there's almost nothing to be offended at and it drinks like a soda. When you have no taste, there's less chance of bitterness or off-notes. The longer you brew a beer, the more broken down it gets, and thus you have ""light"" beer. I far prefer the full taste of Budweiser over a Bud Light, about 10 to 1, but Bud Light isn't half bad if you're looking for a refreshing drink for the crowd that no one will object to. Best beer ever? That would be ludicrous. Best beer for frat parties? That might even be stretching it. Best beer for beer-ignorant taste-challenged rowdy boys and girls who sit around the bonfire sharing prepubescent humor and chasing tail - now that's more like it."

"This is what you get when you pee in miller lite. A somehow more disappointing beer. At least the extreme carbonation is a little less harsh, but otherwise... there's just nothing here. It's like alcoholic water. It's... just... sooo.... blah. I really don't understand the extreme fanaticism of the fans of this beer."

"Pours a clear yellow with a thin fizzy head. The smell was mostly rice if anything at all. The taste was a lot more rice. Was not a fan but to just have something at a party. I can understand why this would be chosen. I should not be able to clearly read small print through a beer though."

"I accidently took a mouthful of this redneck swill during a beer-pong game hosted by a 20 something friend of mine. I quickly reaffirmed my commitment to avoiding this corn water crap. 3.8% redneck corn water. Seriously, it tastes like someone poured the juice off a can of corn into a glass with the smallest bit of grain alcohol. If you respect yourself, and don't have a tramp-stamp, please stay away. #1 selling beer in America; no wonder we are in such trouble."

"Lets see here.... The appearance looks like urine. It also smells like urine. Taste is comparable to ball sweat. Mouthfeel is watery and thin. Overall terrible lager. However it doesnt taste as bad in a can. In the can its actually rather sweet and i would describe it as malty."

"Pours a piss yellow color with a head that disappears in seconds. Smells like a skunked beer when it's chilled. Tastes like every other mass produced american lager, malty and makes you want to finish it as fast as possible trying to avoid what it tastes like if it gets to a balmy 40 degrees Fahrenheit. Honestly wasn't in my mouth long enough to tell you how it felt. Sadly, I will buy it again just because it's cheap and it's hard to argue with 14 bucks for a case. Please don't let your friends let this be their first beer."

"Pours a pale straw with a huge white head that dissipates quickly. The nose is bland. The flavor profile tastes like watery corn. Even in my days of regularly drinking AALs, I simply could not handle diet AALs. I can’t believe that people buy this beer by the case and consume mass quantities of it – there must be a better way of getting plastered."

"Overall, it is what it is. It is a great beer for when your hot, sweaty and need a thirst quencher. I drank this for the beginning of my adult life and many of my friends drink it, a lot of it. I will take one of these if it left at my house or a friend swaps one of these for one of my more tasty brews but I surely would not buy it."

"Wake up people. You could buy a craft brew for nearly the same price, water it down to like 2/3rds water and 1/3rd of the craft beer, and it would still have more flavor than Bud Light and you'd probably have 3 x as much fluid oz for your buck."

"Classic American beer. If you don't know what to order at a bar, with a Bud Light you can't go wrong. You can find this beer at almost every bar. It is light in color and goes down smooth. The after taste isn't too bad and you can drink a lot without getting too full"

"My opinion Bud Light is highly over rated! Its one step above water! Although it does taste OK, but to a well rounded beer taster it is weak. Cost is comparable to other American beers, but I wouldn't buy it unless it was cheaper than a competitor. I can't believe this beer is so popular because it lack character in my book."

If cost is your motivator, there's plenty of cheaper beers on the market that exceed in taste and quality. Start with pretty much any beer on this website, including a watery Blatz; it will be a step upwards!"

"DATE TASTED: February 8, 2014... GLASSWARE: 22 oz. pilsner...OCCASION: watching the Olympics and feeling patriotic enough to review a true American product... APPEARANCE: lackluster pale gold body with reasonably lively effervescence; thin white head; tentacle smears of lacing... AROMA: tin, corn, and sweet syrup--slightly candied and demonstratively sweet... PALATE: light, as advertised--cold, crisp, watery presence, with slight carbonation ...TASTE: nearly tasteless--what does rear up its head isn't ugly, just metallic, beefy and rinsing... OVERALL: New Year's resolution: trying to spend less time babbling about subpar macros in these annuls; simple fact is, this beer's ubiquity cannot justify its smirk-inducing, blasé product that masquerades its way through billion-dollar ad campaigns; remember the penguin ads? THIS BEER is the thing In the house I am most nervous about finding...."

"Bud Light is a Light Beer. This beer is brewed by Anheuser Busch. with an abv of 4.2. Light Amber Color lighter than Budweiser. Taste is smooth not much here just smooth. The smell is a light beer smell not much here. Over all a good drinking beer on a hot day."

Ive certainly had my share on drinking it of course, but the taste is sort of hard to explain for me.... kind of a light/strong-tasteless taste... if that makes sense. its good when its ice cold, dont bother if its warm."

"Overall: In keeping with the spirit of “respecting” all beer, I should not be rating this beer. I don’t like any of these watered down, commercialized domestic beers. Due to its popularity, I am often asked what I think about this beer. The only way to give an honest opinion, is to try it. This beer taste like the water after the beer glass is rinsed. It does go down smooth. For people who like the idea of drinking beer, but don't like the taste of “real beer”, this Bud’s for you."

"Bud light was one of the first beers I started drinking about 10 years ago. I never knew what beer was suppose to be like or if this was what all other beers competed against to the public. man was I wrong. I soon discovered other flavors, aromas, and depth in beers that bud light didn't offer. Although I do enjoy darker beers now I got to say bud light still holds a place in my heart. lets be real you can grab a 30pk at times for $16 during a major holiday or sporting event. Even if it doesn't hold up to other beers I'm sure it will be around for a long time to come. family and friends enjoy this pilsner beer and when its around I wont hesitate to grab one. cheers!"

"Light body with a crisp hop presence that is immediately countered by an unpleasant, lingering metallic adjunct character.  Some crisp, grassy hop flavor but it's killed off by hints of metal, corn and rice.  The adjuncts realy overpower what could be a decent tasting light lager.  The pale malts and hops are obliterated by the offensive lingering flavors."

"just as the saying goes you get what you pay for , and im not talking about the consumer the big bud has spent little and put little into this beer , no hops taste no barley taste and thats what you get it could be so much more ,but why bother it sells and so lets get to the bottom line . most consumers today are getting a corn product with an abv content.and less sweet than sum of those corn syrup mixes out there ,but little hops and little hopes that this beer will change for the better . thanks mass market cor-piarets for ruining american lager. but that said it will still get u a dui. oh and if this beer aint made from corn well please let me no what GMO it is .thanks"

"Overall: In terms of beer, its horrible. It's sad that this is what most people think of when you say ""Light Beer"" or even ""Beer"". Only reason why I'm giving it a 1.75 instead of anything lower is because it doesn't have a taste that makes you sick, its well carbonated, its cheap and it will eventually get you drunk."

It's easily the worst of all the beers the macros have to offer. How this beer is the number one selling beer in the US continually eludes me... and yes, I did save this beer for my 666th review. :P"

Crystal clear clarity and a light gold color. Aroma of rice and just a faint bit of buttering hops. Very light and crisp body. Flavor is rice, light malt and very faint bitterings hops."

If you're a hop head or someone that only drinks craft, you have no business here, but if you like to spend a few hours enjoying a refreshing beer with your friends bud light does it as well as any other macro light. Also, like most of us I am the proud owner of a decent sized beer gut, a light beer once and while makes me feel like i've made healthy choice. Yes, theres nothing outstanding about bud light, but there is also absolutely nothing wrong with it. Thats what makes it the best selling beer in the world."

"this is rotten stuff almost every single time, in any format, from any location. ive somehow not reviewed this until now, although ive ranted about it constantly. not just for its low quality, but for its social position and politics, both of which I cannot tolerate at all. I did manage to have this fresh at the brewery though, and must confess that in that context, it is passable, albeit as a light adjunct brew, it didn't have its usual skunky metallic profile. in normal format though, this is swill I wont even usually touch. pee yellow, very fizzy, and tasting like anything but good fresh beer. I marvel at how millions of people consider this the good stuff, and how much profit it generates for its creators. to me, I would rather not drink honestly. the amount of these it would take me to get drunk is sickening, and hopefully I wont embark on that mission anytime soon. aren't they in a lawsuit for having watered this down? watering down water, that's a laugh..."

"O: It's just a Bud light at the end of the day. I'm not going to say it was awful because really it wasn't.

"The best way to describe it is.... since I've had real good beers you can pick out so many different characteristics on so many different levels. It blew my mind how different they were... even within a same style. Then you try a Bud Light and you realize it's made to be cheap, get you drunk and as clean... by clean i mean watery and hiding any flavor.... as possible. Miller light would be a better choice if you like that stuff"

"Pours a very clear golden color with a 2 finger width carbonated head.  Head quickly dissipates with little to no lacing on the side of the glass.  Has more of a sour fruit aroma, but there is a slight hint of banana at the end.  A little sweeter there.  Bready, malty taste with a slight hop edge at the end.  There is a hint of cloves and banana at the end.  To be honest, as far as the type of beer goes, it isn't bad.  It is fairly representative.  I won't mistake it for a good beer, though.  There is still more of a watered down flavor."

"Lets be realistic, bud light may not be craft beer. But it has got more people laid than any craft beer. Most of life of a man revolves around getting laid, then you grow up get married then getting laid doesn't matter as much. When is the last time Pliny got you laid??? Dont hate on people that drink light beer, let them do their thing. Most girls do not drink craft beer if they drink any beer at all. I personally am beer spoiled due to my occupation, and I drink tons of craft beer with visits to Russian river, 21st amendment, victory, magic hat and goose island so far this year. The only reason these craft beers exist is because anheuser busch lets them. Craft beer is about 10% of the beer industry. Beer is meant to be drank. Drink up."

"This is my all time favorite beer, for a everyday drink. Whether its after a long day of work or even a tailgate day where you are out drinking all day in the sun, this is the beer for you. It is a light beer that is nothing special. Served cold out of the bottle is best for this beer. It's look is light and carbonated with little aroma this beer is good for any occasion."
""
""
"O - This beer is perhaps the least-aligned brew with my own preferences. When I enjoy hoppy bitterness in a beer, I need it to be balanced and flavorful; this is neither of the latter. I cannot stand what little flavor is present. That bitterness might work for other people (judging by the average score, however, it does not), but when it's not balanced with anything else, it's just not for me."
""
""

"I thought the bud light was very good. The appearance was a light yellow coloring. The smell was of wheat and a little malt to it. THe taste was very crisp and refreshing and I enjoyed it a lot. Best out of the bottle but the can was alright too. The aroma was not that good and was a little bland."
"Served straight from a tallboy. Golden yellow appearance and a classic light beer. You can drink a lot of this beer. American beer taste. Toasted grains really come through in the aroma and taste, but there is not much flavor diversity beyond that. A very refreshing beer that has a lively, highly carbonated mouthfeel. Smooth taste, with bubbles, and with very little lingering aftertaste."

"Poured from a tallboy into a shaker pint. I can't believe I'm doing this, but I used to drink so much of it before that I almost feel compelled to give it a shake now. The beer is a pale, almost clear, yellowish coloring with a frothy white head that quickly settles into a sparse coating of filmy, white bubbling. Fast, moderate amount of carbonation bubbling. Aromas of toasted grains, and not much else. Flavors of not a whole hell of a lot. Seriously. Clean, with some toasted grain characteristics, but very subtle. Aftertaste is funky, with a slightly floral and sour character to it. Clean, crisp finish. Very neat and clean brew, but lack just about every other quality."

"This by far is my favorite beer that I know can be found anywhere and is light allowing you to drink on it for hours at a time. Basically between Coors Light, Miller Light, and Bud Light, I will always go with Bud. Now having said all of that it by all means doesn't make it the best. It terms of flavoring and sipping on a beer to enjoy its creativity this obviously isn't the beer for that. It's about as simple and generic as a beer can get but it does have drinkability going for it."

"Overal: This beer is smooth, crisp, refreshing, balanced, easy on the tongue. I wanted a light lager. I got it! I was not looking for ale, stout or wheat beer. Would buy this again ? On special occasions but I take a Busch light or natural light over this because price"

"My first sips of this beverage, from its embarrassingly designed aluminium bottle, were remarkably absent of any sensation at all. When cold, this beer is indistinguishable from soda water. As it warmed, a soft, sweet flavour appeared to fill the drink's middle space. None of this was unpleasant; in fact, I was impressed by the skill with which this beer was executed. In the end, there are no faults, flaws, or any hint of character whatsoever. There is energy here, but no substance."

"Will drink it if there are no other full beers or Miller lite on the low cal side. Not horrible but not something you should seek out if you have choices. If you must drink light go with Miller. But this one is better than Coors, which seems to be the three major light beers in my part of the USA. I have not tried the MIchelobe light's or ultra's so I can not compare them."

"The worst beer I've ever had. What is the point of drinking a water-down beer i may ask? Original Budweiser was nasty enough, yet they managed to make it even worse. Every time i watch a bud light ad on TV, i feel the need to puke my guts out. Bad bad beer. Can't help but wonder what is wrong with the fellas buying those 12 or 18 can cases. Must have their taste buds damaged or something."

"Bud Light is one of my favorite beers that is not going to break the bank when you go out, or just want some beer around the house. The taste of Bud Light is good,while the smell is just average. I have always liked the texture of it as well. It is a good and relieble beer."
""
"This is among my top 3 favorite weekend beers. This beer is very flavorful and quite enjoyable to drink but some enthusiasts would think this beer is overdone with flavor and lacks traditional beer qualities. I would definitely recommend this beer when you want to go out an have fun or even if you are just chilling at home. The can however could use some work. The logo is simple and i like that but they can do a lot more to improve the appearance of the can."

"o - I know a lot of people bash this because it's an InBev product, But realistically this is one of the best Light Lagers you will find. I've had some terrible light lagers that are rated far higher than this simply because they are from another brewery. Easy drinking, Not offensive at all and actually has some flavor, Which is rare for the style. It isn't a craft beer, And it doesn't pretend to be a craft beer. You can do MUCH worse for the adjunct style."
""
"Overall: I don't hate this beer. I just don't happen to like it very much. It can be said, however, to be refreshing on a hot day when served cold. Still, there are much better beers in the cheap-swill class which do a better job under those circumstances than Bud Light."
""
""
""

"I don't get all the hate for the BMC's on this site. Did everyone start out drinking craft? I know I didn't and I can also say I'm not, nor will I ever be too good for a Bud. I feel there is always a time and a place for it. If I know I'm going to drink all day, like tailgating at a Texans game, I'm going to bust out the Bud rather than an IPA or stout. I'm not even going to break down this review and tell you color, taste, ect. because you should already know what a light lager tastes like. In my opinion this site is more about learning craft/micro brews that you possibly cant get or find so you read about them. This beer is too easily accessible, you want to know what what it tastes like, go buy one."

"Smooth and refreshing but tasteless. If you like beer with flavor don't bother. I might prefer natural light. Haha"
"Barely a step above weak soda water. In fact, I'd rather drink a nice, cold glass of ice water over having this beer. I wonder what the Budweiser marketing folks mean by the ""superior drinkability"" label on the bottle? Superior to plain water? Perhaps; there is a low alcohol content that may be a draw over plain H2O. Superior to drinking a flavorful beer? No way! One of the primary reasons I try and drink so many beers near and far is for classic beer flavors and new and interesting twists which so many creative, thinking brewers come up with. If low alcohol and barely perceptible taste are what you're looking for, then Bud Light is the beer for you..."
""
""
"Let's face it, this beer has very little taste (more like flavored water), and is marketed for girls who don't like the taste of beer. You are paying for the name and marketing. If you paid for taste, this stuff would be almost free. This is basically an image beer."

And, it's not quite as terribad as BL Platinum. So celebrate those two merits Bud Light, because that's all I'm giving you tonight."

"Taste: Inoffensive, so it's not GOD AWFUL. But it drinks like a glass of water ... which is... weird. A beer should never drink like that. Sure, Bud Light has ""superior drinkability", but it has inferior everything else. Alcoholic corn water (with a touch of sweetness) is all this is. As I said at the start, this is a ""get me drunk for cheap"" beer, like any other macro, really. It is what it is. Not good by any means, but it gets the job done."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a medium golden color with a smallish white head that dissipates rather quickly but never disappears. Smells of light sweet bready malt with a touch of apple and honey and maybe some floral hops. The flavor is sweet grainy with pomme fruits and a hint of bread and hops. Light body with a moderate to high level of carbonation and a sweet watery mouthfeel. Well it could work on a hot summer day, but there is so little flavor in here it's hard for me to want to."

"What can I say, this is a classic macro light beer. It is very contested between Coors Light and this beer to which is the better one. I definitely believe the Bud Light is a better beer with more flavor and body. It has a dark yellow color and formed like a half inch head when served on the glass. The taste is somewhat strong similar to the Budweiser Lager, but much more smoother. It leaves a very bitter taste as aftertaste and is very carbonated. Overall it is a good light beer if that's what you enjoy."
""
""
"O - Probably the most overrated beer I've ever had. It's not any more special than Busch Light, Keystone Light, etc., so why waste your money on this overpriced and overrated version? I wouldn't refuse one, but I don't remember the last time I bought this. Here, Weego!"

"Having had many of these throughout my college years, I've come a long way. Bud Light gives you exactly what you pay for - a ""beer"" to drink when you really don't care about what beer you're drinking. With a nearly absent flavor and smell, there are MANY better options than Bud Light, even at comparable prices."
""

"The beer pours a very clear yellow color with a white head. The aroma has a lot of grain notes, as well as a hint of grass from the hops. The flavor is more of the same. Grain and biscuit malt dominate, with some grass and the slightest hint of bitterness. Thin mouthfeel and medium carbonation. Not a good beer, but nothing offensive. It basically just smells and tastes like nothing."

"If you don't like beer, this is the beer for you. Pours like a soft drink that's been left in a hot car, then kicked around for a while. Unfortunately, it doesn't taste as good as it pours. There's a hint of old shoe in there, and an aftertaste of regret and self-loathing that is truly unique. I'd recommend it for this experience, or if you're having to choose between Bud Light or getting food poisoning from the water in Mexico (I chose the water personally, but to each their own)."

I used to drink this crap to back in Highschool, but eventually I tasted a good beer and realized Budweiser has been playing us all for many years. Get out and try something new. Let the big beers know that we want better and wont except anything but quality. The only quality you get from them is the fact they watered down the urine before they carbonated and bottled it."

"I always say this is the beer for people with no taste in beer. Perfect for the inexperienced, (college kids) or people that usually don't drink beer. It's as close to water as you can get, but with the terrible corn after taste. I understand that the reasons I dislike it are basically the reasons it sells so well. I'm not trying to change that. I'm just not a fan of that kind of beer. At all. It's basically the McDonalds of beer. Cheap, easy to make, and will give you the desired effect. But it won't be great."

"Pours a clear light yellow with an off-white head that fades to nothing. No lacing on this one. Smell is of grain, corn flakes, and metal. Taste is the same with a corn-like aftertaste that sticks around the palate. This beer has a low level of carbonation with a pretty flat mouthfeel.

"This beer pours out an extra pale golden color with huge amounts of visible carbonation and a large, fluffy white head that drops quickly. Smells like dad's beer from when I was a kid. Tastes like water, with just the smallest hint of bready malt and corn. It gets a two for not tasting BAD, it just doesn't taste like much at all. The mouthfeel is highly carbonated and very thin, and the drinkability is really not that good. For a beer that markets itself on drinkability, there's plenty of pale ales and IPAs that I can crush faster. Probably because they actually taste good, so I want to drink them. It's Bud Light. Really, what did you expect? Oh yeah. For the love of God, don't let it warm up. Please."

"I judge this as what it is, a cheap American light beer. Although not as cheap as Keystone, the standard around here, it is noticeably easier to drink. I'm not sure if it is worth the extra money, but as I drank it straight out of the 40oz, I have to say it is better than others, lighter and easier to drink after a night of hard liquor than the cheaper alternatives.

"The color is a very straw-urine yellow. The scent is about the same. The cost was a $1.99, and I did say I would try everything once. The head is what to appears to be a snow white cap, but when sighted closely we are able to visually dissect all the little mites crawling around and in deep meditation for discovering your eyebrows. This rushing river charged into my mouth to show its lack of density and viscosity. Yet, the carbonation is dominant, a nice feeling if you are an addict to club soda. There is also a last for everything, eventually the cosmos will do what is due. Just as there was no before, there is certainly nothing after. This was just a bit of suspended confusion, deeply looking into the eyes of the man next to you. You know who you are. It bothers me still that the percent is 4.2"

"Pours a very pale straw color with a fizzy head that goes down almost immediately. There's not much of a smell except for a bit of the hops. Taste is some adjunct and a hint of hoppy bitterness.

""
""
""
"O - Hey, it could be worse. At least it doesn’t smell or taste “bad” like some other light/adjunct beers. It mostly tastes like water. One plus is that it is pretty refreshing due to the light body and carbonation. If you ever find yourself at a frat party, tailgate, wedding, etc. where all they have is light lagers, this isn’t a terrible choice. Alcoholic water has its time and place."

It is not as watery and tasteless as Coors Light either; I think it's the best of the BMC light lagers, though that isn't saying much. Obviously nothing to seek out but I've had much worse and much more offensive craft beers, that I would rate below this. Most people will give it a bad grade due to it being a light lager produced by a BMC company, but it isn't offensive or skunky at all. Most of the beers on the ""Bottom of the List"" list are worse than this one; while it might deserve to be on the list, it should be much lower than #5."

"Pours a very pale straw yellow color with a fizzy head that does not last very long. No lacing on the glass. Smell is pretty subdued with some corn and no hops. Taste is much of same with a very thin body. Almost like drinking water. Not sure what the point of drinking this beer is."
""
""
"I had this one straight from the bottle and right after I had a Budweizer. Not much difference, except that it didn't have any taste at alland was way too watery on the palate. Very thin on the body and very light carbonation."

"Bud light is what it is ,a great clean tasting ,looking,and smelling American Beer. It has actual flavor that the silver can doesnt It doesnt have the nasty tripple brewed filtered through sweaty gym socks taste that the other one has. Face it any american wants pilsner they're at very least reaching for a micro-brew I wish no ill fate on any American owned brewery BUT good thing for M/C that theyre alot of dummys out there who are sold on color changing lable and twisted bottle shapes :0-)"

"I drink these with ease at a tailgate party or at a get together. Rich or poor everybody has had a bud light. The price is cheap, the quality is border line between okay and bad, but it brings along a good time at events and that alone is worth bragging about."
"I dont know if its the hops, too much salt, or just bitter, but this beer just does not taste good."
""
""
"Light lagers are not my favorite style, but every beer deserves a fair review. It's not an awful beer by any means, but it's not a good beer either. It's below average and there are better, less expensive brands of light lagers. If you like light lagers, you could do better than Bud Light."

"This is a very light beer so it is refreshing for the summer or any other time that it's real hot and you don't want to drink something too substantial."
""
"O: terrible overall, but I guess there's a category for garbage. This beer tastes completely different (and better) now that I'm into craft. I haven't had one in years, and this is probably the only time I've ever poured a can of it into a glass."
""
""
""
""
"Not much of an appearance with about a 1"" head that quickly disappears. Smells like watered down...water beer. Taste like a normal american pilsner which lacks much flavor or imagination. Really crisp and tastes pretty much how it smells and looks. Let's face it, this is a drinking game beer so leave it for the tailgates or beer pong. Unless of course it's free, then the ""free beer"" rule applies."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - When the three light domestics are on special at campus bars, I go with Bud Light but any other day of the week there's not too much for it. It's always refreshing, but nothing to write home about. It's better on draft and when it's not ice cold. Enjoy!"

"Overall: It is a light beer and truly has all the characteristics of the style so you should not look for more than that. The biggest and best thing I noted was that after 4 pints there was no bloated feeling. That is a big plus. It is not the best light beer I have ever had but I would have it again."
""
""
""
"Is this beer for drinking or putting out fires when camping. Its hard to tell if someone can actually appreciate this as a beer however if you are in college than this is good for the price. Very light watery taste and color. Quite carbonated and goes down rather smooth. Don't mind occasionally having 6-12 of these if I have a long continuous day of drinking. Ie tailgating or college day parties."
"12 oz can. Tried it at friend’s Super Bowl party. Pours pale straw with a white head. Aroma of rotten eggs is much more pronounced than in regular Budweiser . Soda like body. There is not much taste here, somewhat like sweet carbonated water. It went down the sink drain nicely."
""
""
""
""
"Had some of these in the fridge for buddies that come by and I thought, why not? Darn close to clear, lightest straw ever. Not much carbonation coming up through any bubbles. The lightest spotty disk of head, light lace. Light malty lager smell. Light lager taste, a little twangy too. Not pleasant. Mouth is light, balance is easy when there isn't much there. I still use the 'overall' as drinkability. Fuck new rules. Drinkability is high, though. Easy to quaff when you need a glass of water. NOTE: my reviews only use drinkability as a factor, not overall. Overall would be more like 2.5 or 3, but it is very easy to session on a hot day."
""
"Overall- I drank this beer to get drunk as a teenager but have now developed a more sophisticated taste. Great for college parties and teenagers looking to have a good time, bad for an experienced palate."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: It's drinkable. Not very good but drinkable and works really well for drinking games if that counts for anything."
"Overall it is what it is."

"Oh Budlight.. I review you just for fun. Does anyone actually come here for a Bud Light review? I understand it has to be included, I just find it funny so many people have reviewed it. Now I am one of those. I will start by pointing out that the label has a swish of water cascading upwards towards the heavens on it. That says it all. Cheers!"

"This beer is light and easy to drink. It's not good but it's really not bad. It would be refreshing on a hot day. It's about perfectly average and would be a good starting point to rate other beers against."

"All in all, the worst beer i have had in my life together with Coors Light and Coronita. PBR beats the shit out of this and it is even cheaper."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is below average, even for an adjunct beer. There really isn't anything good or bad to say about it, but it's probably the least appealing compared to Coors Light and Miller Lite where flavor is concerned."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
" These are made for college parties, girls, beerbongs and the like. I am not convinced that miller lite and bud light aren't exactly the same, but I'm sure that no one cares either way."
""
""
""
"Overall - I've always liked Bud Light but I just don't like the carbonation in it.. Having acid reflux it gives me gas and heartburn compared to other beers. Almost like the carbonation has a different effect."
""
""
""
""
""
"Final Grade: 2.68, a low C-. I would take this over Coors Light, but realistically the difference is so negligible that I'd probably just get whichever was cheaper. Or, more likely, something less crappy."
""
""
"Bud Light is watered down, low on flavor and barely tastes like beer. Considering it is so inoffensive and boring, it's hard to explain why it's bad, but trust me it is. You could probably pound a ton of these though."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Ok, now that I’ve cleared my throat I can adequately review this beer by saying it’s piss poor all around. A pale, light yellow color, no discernible hop aroma, the taste of musty stale leftover beer even when fresh and an aftertaste that’s just as bad. About the same as the second runnings I produce after a night of drinking beer. Good stuff."
""
""
"Overall, I would almost rather drink water. Some of it has more flavor."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"This beer is your average light beer. It pours a very clear yellow. There's hardly a distinct smell to it. The taste is that of carbonated water. There's little flavor. Not too much to pick up on. Maybe some notes of corn. Practically no evidence of hops however. It does have a decent mouthfeel. At least one that is very carbonated. All in all, this beer is really nothing special at all. On a hot day it will cool you off because it's similar to water."
""
""
""
""
""
"Not too bad for an inexpensive beer. Certainly better then a lot of the cheap beer and obviously a very popular brand. Probably rank it 2nd out of the big three but I'd say their all pretty similar. Pours a bright yellow color and leaves an aftertaste that I'm not too found of. Easy to drink and relatively smooth. Not a bad choice if you want to spend the extra buck when your in college."
""
""
""
"they way i see this is it ""gets the job done"" and is really refreshing from a carbonated water perspective, but come on, there is just not enough substance in this beer to get remotely excited about it."

""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, its pretty good for an adjunct. Take BL over coors, busch, PBR, or any of those worse adjuncts. I like it if I just want to get drunk. Its nothing special to enjoy the taste of. Its not intolerable either though."

"1.5 D: What can I say? This beer has served it's purpose. My average score is going to take a hit from this. Like the people who make a habit of purchasing this, this beer is simple and boring."

"O: just not much there, I'm trying to understand why this is the best rated beer in America. Hmmm . . . I'm hoping the economy will get better so people can try better stuff."

"On a serious note, I rated this one across the board only because that was as low as I could go."
""
""
""
"I tried this on Thanksgiving while watching college football with a few buddies. I have no idea what it looked like because I drank it from the can. Overall, carbonation was medium, but there was no hop or malt flavors. It was very watery. It is just crap. Don't was your money, it is worth paying a little more for a better brew. My guess is to why everyone drinks this is the price and multi-million $ ads that keep this brand in peoples' minds."

"O: So, like most craft beer drinkers - this just doesn't cut it for me. If there is nothing else - i'll drink it - but it really tastes like a water beer."
"Overall: A below average offering of a light lager, but definitely not terrible if you like minimal flavor and easy drinkability."
"This is the beer you drink when you are already drunk as my friend has said. The taste is only unique in that it has absolutely no uniquness. I found this beer a waste of time, money, and brain cells. I suggest buying a Heineken is your looking for cheaper mass produced beer, stay away from this vacuum of taste."
"For some reason, when I think about what beer tastes like, bud light is immediately what comes to mind. Probably from sneaking sips from my dad's can when I was young and being disgusted by the sharp bitterness that beer is to an untrained palate. In hindsight, that statement seems almost ridiculous as this beer is as close to water as beer can possibly be. There is no taste, no characteristic that defines this beer. It simply is and I'll continue to drink it in the manner I listed above."
"O: I will drink this beer again. I am not going to lie to you."
"O: Wouldn't buy it, I guess I would drink it if offered and desperate but not gonna give my money to bud"
"overall, i am not enjoying this and think it pretty much sucks as a beer. it's not overtly offensive and thus i could conceivable see myself drinking one at say a beach if offered for free."
"This is the first bud light I have had in a long long time and honestly, it tastes like seltzer water. There are a few light beers I do enjoy like hudy delight, old milwaukee light, and high life light. This one, however, is borderline nasty. For the life of me I do not understand how this is the number one selling beer in the US."
"O- Bad yes but it could be much worse (see miller lite)"
"Overall not sure why I ever drank this but oh well."
"O- good if you are at the beach in 100 degree sun but otherwise skip it"
"For a light beer, this is surely at the top of the list, although there are more flavorful light beers."
"But on a side note - I always have in frig for my non ""beer"" friends. I love good beer - some people just don't."
"This is not a beer that I buy when I'm wanting good beer. This is the beer I buy when I am getting ready to watch a sporting event (football) and need something cheap that goes down like water all the while still helping me feel the effects of alcohol!"
"Sorry guys but I'm gonna be a beer snob and elect to not drink any more of this crap for the sake of my beer karma."
"The taste is a weak lager, stript of malts, barley, and hops. If they use any of that, it's very hard to tell. The carbonation is way to strong and I almost taste the fizz more than the beer itself, it's tough cause I drink it as fast as I can. It feels almost rough on the tongue with it's over-carbonated-ness. Overall, Bud Light it just shit. But I'm drinking it. Take that for what it's worth."
"Overall: I actually think I prefer the can over the bottle for bud light. Not an impressive beer at all and not worth the extra money for a bottle over a can."
"On the bottle it says, ""Superior Drinkability."" Guess I can't argue with that point. Water is also highly drinkable. Maybe that's what this stuff is. Sure tastes like it."
"Overall Drinkability - Perhaps it's because I served this beer at around 45 degrees F that it tastes so bad. Serving it chilled might help bring out the refreshing lightness of the mouthfeel. Feels fake and sticky at higher temps."
"O - Lightly beer flavoured water. I would probably enjoy one straight after a hard slog of lugging heavy objects around on a hot day, but a water would do just as well. A sports drink even better."
"I didn't review this beer just to flame it. Yeah it sucks but it has a place. I'm sure it was a lot of people's first beer. It drinks easy and is a good gateway beer for a lot of people. Also, easy to drink and refreshing, almost like a soda."
"Watery. Medium carbonation. Not at all appealing. Another brew for those who want a cheap drunk."
"This beer(?) isn't very good. I only drink it when it's free and each time I do I remember why I don't enjoy it. I can drink it really fast and cold, the on;y way this stuff can be enjoyed."
"This one simply leaves me wondering why? Why would anyone drink this? Why did I even try it (again)? Pointless, boring junk."
"Overall, this is exactly what you would expect from this particular style of beer. Easy to drink in large numbers and refreshing enough to enjoy on a hot summer day. With this is mind, I wouldn't recommend to others."
"Overall: Terrible, leaves you feeling bloated and sick."
"You should just put a lime in a beer like this, at least you would feel like you are in Mexico. It is cheap, it is bad."
"The mouthfeel is fine for the style. It is light but refreshing. Carbonated water, basically. Overall, this is, well, carbonated water. It's La Croix. Every bit as bad as La Croix."
"When it comes to cheap beer, this is in my top two. Great for beer games."
" ~ I've said it before and I'll say it again right here. There is a time and a place for every beer. If you're looking for an over-rated (by American social standards) light beer, and you want to pay through the nose simply because it's advertised to death... this is the beer for you."
"not too bad. ive had many a days going to the store and picking up a 36 before i became enlightened and had real beer. cant really knock it too bad this beer has led to many a fun night. it has a crisp taste but if you dont slam it within 5 minutes turns stale quick."
"I hate this beer so much. I had it once when I was 21 and just couldn't handle it. It's not that the taste is horrible or rotten, its just too much like water. The carbonation makes me burp way too me and gave me the hiccups for half an hour. I will never drink this beer again and hope that it goes away. It is a disgrace to US beers."
"Overall, a very light, crisp and refreshing beer. It adheres to all the guidelines of what a Lite American Lager should be. It's a very drinkable beer. Personally, not always in the mood for it but great for when I want something really light. But then again i'm not always in the mood for an Imperial stout either..."
"Overall its a drinkable beer good mostly only for super hot days outside or for drinking easily in bulk. Not as caustic on the palate as most reviews suggest."
"Overall, in my opinion of widely available stadium beers, if these were the only one, I could partake."
"Overall I think you should only drink this for long sessions where you plan on getting plastered. Which is not often, at all, for me."
"O: Why oh why? What is the point of this beer's existence?"
"Overall, way too sweet and way too carbonated. This just isn't good."
"Don't buy this stuff man, grab something worth drinking.."
"Dr: As a flavored water, it's easy to drink and is of abysmal qualtiy, but costs quite a bit on tap."
"Drinkability: If you are judging superior drinkability with water as the benchmark, I suppose this is comparable. It is beer-flavored water. Perhaps that is too generous. Beer enriched water? Beer infused water?"
"Pours clear pale gold with a two inch white foamy head that dies in about three minutes. Might be a spot or two of lacing. Aroma is pungent but I am having a hard time placing the aroma. Taste is minor sweetness, slightly malty and just a hint of grassy and noble hop bitterness. Mouthfeel is average for the style and slightly over carbonated. Finish is sweet, , and lightly dry.. Overall on a hot summer day and served ice cold, consumed quickly, I could drink a few of these. But I agree there are plenty of equally good and some better choices in the light beer category. And from looking at many sources this contains rice as the adjunct not corn."
"Very bad mouthfeel and aftertaste."
"You are not a beer drinker if you drink Bud Light. Its success is due to marketing; not fidelity to the craft/art of brewing excellent beer. It was made so that people can drink more-- not so that they can enjoy beer but so they can be drunk. Beer is an experience. Get over yourself, Bud Light!"
"O- I have yet to understand why people like this beer. It would be cheaper to just drink water. There is really nothing good about this beer. It taste like metal and there is no quality to it. I wish this beer would just go away."
"Overall this is a terrible beer. I wouldn't even consider this a consumption beer. There are much better watered down beers that you can consume in large quantities if that's what your looking for."
"O - Bleh. Better than Coors at least."
"This beer epitomizes the power of marketing. There is nothing special about this beer in any way, shape, or form. Bland, corny, and watery sum up its characteristics. There are other light lagers that are superior and cheaper."
"I guess I've grown up. A few years ago, I didn't think this was that bad of a beer. Now I understand. This is not beer. It's just seltzer water with some alcohol. It's not necessarily offensive, it's just not worth drinking. The scary thing is that I recall Miller Lite and Coors Light being worse. I'll have to review those, too."
"taste and looks like water.... no aroma... no head... i hear its very hard to make though and they get it the same every time... i guess that is one positive... oh and they do have good commercials!!!"
"D- Pretty much what you expect from a macro brew. Great for large gatherings and college students. I know it got me through most of my drinking years. Now it just disappoints and feels like water mostly."
"O - It is what it is, will work on a hot day but here are much better lagers out there."
"O: Well, this sucks."
"Head is decent at first but quickly fades to nothing but a couple bubbles. Nose is nothing but a sour grain and some faint hop spice. Taste is faint and just seems like something poured out of a faucet that hasn't been turned on in about 20yrs. Barely grainy water that has a large amount of carbonation. Finishes with a faint bitterness that makes you just want something else to wash it down."
"Think I'll have another!"
"Everyone's gotta hate on the big dogs. If you're at a small bar or a picnic, they're going to have bud light. Are you seriously going to complain about this? This is a drinkable beer and not at all bad tasting. Just because it isn't a craft brew does not make it a crap brew. For the price and convenience of finding it everywhere, you can't go wrong with the world's best selling beer. The foam lingers for a short period of time and the smell is not noteworthy. It is enjoyable from start to finish."
"I have been known to announce my hatred for Bud Light. But I think there's worse light beers out there. Still, considering what else you could get for the price, why bother?"
"O - A pretty weak lager, but I've had worse. It certainly is depressing knowing that for the same price I paid for a single pint I could've picked up a really tasty craft ale."
"Overall: Harmless, but mostly tasteless. At least there is no horrible corn taste, and it is somewhat crisp and refreshing."
"D/O- The most popular worst beer. Has a time and a place, which 99.99% I miss. Drunk vehicle."
"It doesn't go down smooth... It is refreshing on a hot day, but that is probably because it mostly taste like water. There is some redeaming qualities... like it is great to use for boiling bratwursts in."
"Taste like a shitty ass wheat beer; can't expain how it taste, only rather drink this that miller lite any fuckin day, as far as a light beer goes this is the best light light beer I get besides sam adams boston lager, but I highly doubt itx considered in the wheat beer category"
"Boring plain ol jane light beer. No flavor, no exitement, no feeling of taste. I cant explain this beer other than tasteless boredom. I like the commercials though. The beer was pee pee gold in color, no taste and a mouth feel that was lacking some sort of feel in general. Again here, Budweiser has dropped the ball."
"O: Not good, don't plan on buying one ever."
"Very pale yellow verging on being colorless; clear, with fizzy white head and lots of carbonation. Slight grainy or corny aroma, that's it. No hint of real malts or any hops. Somehow this stuff tastes worse in a glass than straight out of the can or bottle - sourish grain flavor with no hops or bitterness; watery. Plenty of carbonation of course. No extra points for the Superior Drinkability(TM)."
"Pours a thin and fizzy with light straw color with poorly retained head. Smell is stale corn and is absent of hops. Taste is dirty seltzer water without the pleasant mineral quality of the seltzer. Mouthfeel is ... there isn't one, it is carbonated but don't notice much else. Overall, it is too bad that most people recognize this as beer."
"Pours a straw yellow color with a small white head that quickly fizzes away to nothing. Smells weakly of corn, and that's it. Taste is bland, pretty much like carbonated water with a hint of corn flavor. I would have preferred water really. Mouthfeel is light and bubbly, good enough to chug quickly and forget. That is the way you do it yes? Overall this is a poor beer, I would avoid."
"I must assume that massive advertising campaigns, combined with a complete lack of taste buds in the majority of Americans, keeps this beer and others like it selling so well. It's really amongst the worst beers I've ever tried though."
"Reviewing this for what it is, an American Adjunct lager. Pours out very pale gold with not much of a head, which disappears quickly. Smell and taste are both unremarkable, but that is to be expected from a beer of this type, produced for the masses. Drinks just fine, finish is ok, but highly non-remarkable. Hot summer day? Ballpark? Backyard shenanigans with friends and/or family...? This will do...."
"Overall, this beer is only worth drinking if it is the only thing available or if you are going to be outside in the heat and hydration is a must. It should be against the law for this to be marketed and sold as beer."
"man once you start drinking real beer this stuff is just a joke sorry budweiser i bet one day you had really good beer but c'mon you gotta do better than this you are keeping america dumb with this stuff lets go back to makeing real beer shall we?"
"I've gone nearly 40 years and can't say I remember ever drinking a Bud Light. Last night I was offered 1 at a friends house (I actually drank 2 of them just fine). It was very easy to drink (which I pounded 2 just fine). Of course it lacked most any noticable quality beer flavors but just as well nothing tasted bad to note either. I had fairly low expectations and this beer was somewhat refreshing and a pleasant surprise. Its basically the same as Coors and Miller lights, which I have no real trouble drinking either. Of the 3 macro lights I'd rank this one slighty less than Coors and about equal to Miller. All-in-all though their all the same."
"O- Avoid. Unless it is the only choice, and there is no potable water available."
"Poured this from a can, into a plastic cup. Wish i had a frozen mug. It pours a very faint yellow color that you would barely guess was a beer. Very clear. It produced a small white head, poor retention and zero lacing. The aroma was....well not there...Smelled like beachwood aged water. This beer is very light in body- there really is not much taste, no hop flavor to speak of, no real malt or grain flavor. I think all i taste are bubbles. Worst beer I have ever had."
"O: If it's warm out and there was nothing else, I'd drink it. It's not bad per se. It's not really anything."
"O - I believe the combination of mass brewing with low flavor ingredients like rice (to replace barley) and poorly cultured yeasts yield a massively inferior beer. This is truly the bottom rung of beer."
"This is the beer of choice for my father-in-law and I get him a 12 or 18-pack every time he visits. He missed one this time, so I decided to take a trip down undergrad lane and review it. I was impressed by the amount of lacing this beer left behind, but the cereal adjuncts and horrid mouthfeel made me glad he only left one. Probably a slightly below-average macro that needs to be taken ice-cold if one if is to subject themselves to it."
"So I am sure no one needs to read these reviews anyways but the beer is straw yellow, even more so than regular budweiser. A half finger head forms. The smell is of barely. Taste is bitter, less so than budweiser, which is noticeable immediately and remains long after you have finished the beer. The beer tastes and looks watered down but really its just lack of hop flavoring. Far more watered down than its non-light version."
"On the bright side, it will flush out your kidneys and cool you down."
"T: Watered down corn and grain and soggy kix cereal if you used water instead of milk. Pretty awful and one I'll only go for if nothing else is available."
"D - Love it or hate it, it's Bud Light. It has and always will have it's place. Is it a good beer? Not really. Will I turn one down if offered? No."
"overall, this beer sucks. i really think the world would be a better place if this beer stopped being made. the label says ""superior drinkability," what i say is that this beer leaves an unpleasant taste in the mouth that you want to quickly wash out with more beer."
"The smell is absent, the mouthfeel is very poor. Just like Coors light, the taste is like club soda + alcohol. I will pass every time I see the bright blue can...I don't want to fill up on sub-par beer anyone could create."
"24 ounce can, date of 24 FEB 11 stamped on the bottom of the can. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours a clear straw gold color with an inch white head. Not much head retention, but there's a decent amount of lacing left on the glass. Aroma is sweet malt and grain. I think the taste is pretty much the same as the aroma, it's all malt/grain/corn. Mouthfeel/body is light, and it's well carbonated. It's also a bit slick which surprised me. Rating this for the style of beer it is, I don't think it's bad at all. But comparing it to other beers in general, I would choose plenty of other brews before this one."
"Overall, your typical adjunct lager. What can I say."
"D - Well its Bud, what do you expect; kudos to the beer giants in St. Louis for making this beer last so long; it will be here for years to come; I would take a Miller Lite over this any day; keep up those funny commercials though"
"I haven't done an extensive investigation into this style, so I may be missing some nuances here. Really cheap lagers from Honduras and India seem to have more flavor, so they must have determined that less flavor is what they're after. But it does seem like this is a suggestion of beer, a marketing campaign like the Marlboro Man."
"We all know about Bud Light. It's nothing extraordinary, and yet it's nothing undrinkable. There is little to no smell, and the downside to this is that there is also little to no taste. Bud Light is basically water with a hint of beer flavoring. I guess it's good if you want to drink in excess, but still, there are other, better options out there. Don't get me wrong, I drink Bud Light on occasion, but it is nowhere near my 1st choice (or even my 30th choice)."
"D: only thing to do with this is drink it fast and cold. nothing going on here but some bubbly refreshment. double boo."
"O: Not the worst beer ever, but still not one I would turn to if I was looking for a tasty beer. And you have to drink it fast before it warms up, because once it does, you might as well dump it down the drain."
"Pours a pale straw color, with a bubbly white head that quickly dissipates, leaving a highly-carbonated, very watery beer. Calling it ""beer"" is a stretch, BL tastes and looks like it's a near-beer that is mixed with water. It has hardly any taste that would identify it as a beer, it's basically like drinking a sour seltzer water, thankfully without any skunky odor like Corona. I guess no smell is better than a bad smell. As a ""light lager", BL is understandably light-bodied and pale, but it is so bland and pitiful I don't see the point in drinking it, as water would be a cheaper, healthier alternative as a mere thirst-quencher; and I don't see why anyone would drink BL out of enjoyment, it seems to be a beer that is consumed in huge quantities and marketed to the lowest denominator."
"O- The only good thing I can say about this beer is that on a really hot day this is a little refreshing when really cold. Other than that it’s very un enjoyable to drink, no taste or aroma really nothing to this beer, incredibly plain."
"D: Only use is for when you run out of the good stuff on the lake or the beach. There is a reason it is the most popular beer, because the American beer drinker is an idiot."
"O - Obviously this brew isn't an IPA. However, for the style it is quite nice on a hot day. It's right there with Miller Light for the battle of the ""bests""."
"I will rate this beer as of my weekend tasting and rate it as a beer in its class - not my personal preferences. This bottle was enjoyed after several Newcastle's so I admit I may have been a little optimistic and also had low expectations from previous encounters with Bud Light. The surprise to me was that I actually noticed some flowery taste in this beer. I couldn't believe it. That said I couldn't deny that on this day - bud light had more than I remembered."
"If you like it, God Bless You and drink it up because I hate seeing it around and maybe it will stop people from having it at parties and offering it as a legitimate source of malty beverage."
"D/O) The famous phrase ""HERE WE GO"" Means HERE WE GO ON OUR WAY TO A HORRIBLE HANGOVER. I now know why people can drink an entire case of this."
"I am surprised this can legally be called ""beer"". And I am even more surprised that people get drunk out of this. I would need approximately four tons of Bud Light to get a decent buzz."
"O: Not sure what to say, there just isnt much going on here. Its basically a fizzy watered down lager without much personality one way or the other."
"O: Not a great beer, good to drink on a hot day when nothing else is available. The main downfall of this lager is the weakness of the taste, which tastes like carbonated corn water. That weak taste, smell and mouthfeel makes this beer exactly what you paid for, a cheap buzz."
"Overall - Garbage. Unfortunately, I know too many people that think Bud Light is the holy grail of beers ... this is suitable for drinking to get wasted at a tailgate or late night college party, but nothing I'd ever drink to enjoy."
"It's bud light. we've all had it. Just gotta deal with it being everywhere I guess. I still won't drink it unless it's free and I have no choice."
"This beer sucks. I can't believe so many people drink this stuff so religiously. I can't imagine how boring your life must be if you look forward to coming home to this crap at the end of the day."
"If I never have to taste this again, I'll die a happy man."
"Overall its not horrid like Coors light. I think it's a step down from Miller Lite. Definitely a step down from many other light beers such as Milwaukee's Best light and Old Milwaukee Light.,.but oh well. It is what it is."
"Had one the other night because that was all that was available. I'd forgotten how watery a beer can be, and yet not be water. Mild and slightly sweet, a beer designed for mass consumption by the masses. When I drink Bud Light, I feel as if my soul has been sacrificed to the Gods of mediocrity."
"Its a simple beer. Good for after sweating in teh yard or on the court....or whatever. The color is golden clear with decent carbonation. The smell is grainy if anything. The taste is light grainy water taste. Mouthfeel is fine could drink alot of it...if that was all there was."
"drinkability: it is what it is; for a light lager it is a prime example, nothing to rave about, but drinkable."
"O: This is pretty bad. I hadn't had one in a long time, and it will be even longer till I have another. Bad. Stay away at all costs. Skal."
" a case and head to the lake."
"Overall - not bad tasting, but not tasting either...as it doesn't really have much of a taste."
"Just an awful beer. Honestly, I think I'd rather have a Coors Light. At least Coors Light is more or less tasteless."
"Cheap if you want to have a cheap night or do a beer bust."
"The light version of an already light and terrible beer. The lesser son of the King of Beers, Bud Light retains all the qualities of its forebearer: light straw color, fizzy, watery, and soda-like, with almost no semblance to beer whatsoever. Taste is metallic and of stale urea. Mouthfell is watery and a stale, rotten aftertaste is left behind. To be avoided at all costs."
"P.S. it did end up giving me ok lacing, one funny note on that though - when I poured in the rest of the bottle, the head fizzed away in less than 10 seconds, probably 5."
"Cheers. Take it for what it is... and IMO it just ain't that bad."
"I know this is odd to say, but there is a lot more flavor than people give credit to this beer. It has a decent malt start (for a lager) but it just goes to hell from there. That metallic/alcohol finishes is terrible. 4.5% and it has that kinda awful finish? So how do I score this beer? It is a light lager which I don’t get. It has as many calories as Guinness so I’m not sure what light even means. It isn’t diet as there are calories. It isn’t any more summer weather than something even like their “bud heavy.” Why do people drink this? Ultimately there isn’t anything about this beer that stands up to a good beer. Sure smell is offensive and the over carbonated mess with a lack luster flavor makes this thing completely undrinkable. If I could truly score this correctly I’d need negative numbers to properly explain how awful this over fizzed, vomit inducing smelling, mess works."
"Nothing to say that hasn't been said. I love me some Land Shark when it comes to adjunct lagers. Just a little more flavor than a Corona, perfect for the Mexican favorite, a cool refreshing Michelada."
"Overall, I don't like this. I don't want anymore. I don't want to finish the glass. But is it gross? is it killing babies and offending my grandmother? No. It's just sad. I wish I could hate it, but really, it's hard to hate nothing."
"O: Far, far from a good beer but I know for a fact that I have had much worse. If the flavors in this were magnified, I'm sure it would be worthy of a drain pour, but the fact is, this tastes so close to carbonated water that I am going to finish drinking this glass for the hell of it."
"This beer is more watery than Busch. I really couldn't discern a taste from it. It poured a transparent bright yellow with a bone white head that disappeared quickly. It smelled like carbon dioxide with a hint of cereal malt. When it came to taste, I couldn't taste a damn thing. I grabbed a bag of Cheezy poofs since I didn't want to sit around drinking what appeared to be yellow carbonated water. It went well with the Cheezy Poofs."
"Light beer is beer for people who don't like beer. I prefer tap water to this ""beer""."
"All-in-all this beer has some glaring flaws (DMS, really?) But it does what it was designed to do: delivers alcohol in a nearly tasteless form that most people won't take offence to. This is about the 3rd time I've had Bud Light in my life, I don't plan on having it again anytime soon."
"It is what it is: An easy drinking light adjunct. I do love the Bud Bowl."
"This is just really, really BAD beer."
"D- Well I didn't pour this one out but it was consumed very slowly, more as it was something to do than because it was actually enjoyable."
"Yellow in color, flavor is very minimal, absolutely nothing else to really say about this brew other than it's got a slight sweetness to it which is nice I suppose. I never need to have this beer again."
"O: Power of advertising is evident here. Nobody drinks this for the taste...nobody."
"Very pale yellow, white foamy head that can fade quick, light body mostly cause of using sugar and rice to keep the ABV up, the only way i can descibe the aroma is ""beer"" hops are faint just to make it enough to call it beer, This beer is only good for a real hot day at the game, or cheap to use for games to drink fast.Bud Light is not my favorite of cheap american beer though"
"Next time I find nothing but Bud lights at a party I'm sticking to soda or anything that actually tastes good."
"Aside for a cheap beer to give the unwashed masses for use in drinking games, I don't see any real use for Bud Light."
"I hope one day it follows the demise of fascism, communism and slavery; things which have brought only pain and suffering into this world."
"It does finish clean though...brings me back to my keg party days..."
"D - Sure I could pound a few of these but why would I want to? If I wanted to drink water I would."
"Another example of why you should leave brewing to micro breweries."
"Pours a creamy white 2 finger head, which diminishes quickly to a thin ring around the top. Clear, pale straw body, not much lacing. Smell is not unpleasant, light grain. Although I've been drinking this for years, I never really examined the taste: there's not much there. Mouthfeel is very light, watery. Good thirst quencher that goes down easily, but as I said, not much taste."
"It looks like water with a slight yellow tint and smells pretty bad. It tastes just about the same, but I am not ever expecting to be wowed. It is not a well crafted beer, but ""it will get ya drunk""."
"But let's not do that to ourselves, people. This beer nearly fails on all accounts at being beer. Two dollars is too much."
"Poured from the 12oz bottle into a pint glass. Fizzy, palest possible straw color, almost clear. Aroma is very sweet, almost like corn flakes, with a touch of astringency. Palate is, um, lacking. Acrid, slightly chalky, and bitter (but not hoppy), with some weird adjunct malt sweetness. Why do people drink this? I guess the light body makes it go down relatively easy. Blech."
"The mouthfeel is similar to water, and I no longer want to drink this."
"D: Not totally awful, as it goes down like water; it might be slightly more drinkable than Pepsi. Still, no desire to ever pay money for this (and in this instance, I'm glad that someone else did)."
"D: Not a good beer, but certainly not the worst out there. It definitely does its job well; it's light, refreshing, and amazingly sessionable."
"D: I don't knock beers of this style just because I never want to drink them, I try to review every beer to style. And every style, no matter how unattractive, should have a ""best in style."" However, this beer is definitely not it. In fact it's probably at the bottom of the barrel. Why anyone would consider this a decent beverage is beyond me."
"Mouthfeel / Drinkability - I really tried to enjoy this for what it is. But it was impossible. Bud light is my least favorite American Adjunct Lager. It lacks taste. Not just some taste. Any taste. But apparently that's how the majority of people like their alcohol these days. I will never try this again; even if they have a bright metallic orange bottle for halloween. I'm only out $1.29 or so. But I wish I could get it back. Sorry to be so harsh; but this beer just isn't worthy of anything more."
"D-well something about it makes me want to vomit. its ABV is low, yet i bet i drink more 90 minutes without getting sick."
"This is a great beer to drink on a hot day at the beach or at parties. That's about all that this one has going for it."
"Pretty bad, even for a BMC. Miller lite is far superior"
"Dont waste your money on this."
"What's the point? Spend the extra money and get some flavor and nutrition out of it."
"OVERALL: If I've already had six beers, OK, I can manage to drink one of these, but as a first beer of the night it is simply not worth it to me. I drink beer because I enjoy beer, not because I want to get drunk. I know I'll sound like a beer snob saying this, but I enjoy bitter beer, hoppy beer, strong beer. So the Bud Light tasted like water that had been contaminated to me."
"I never even liked this stuff in college, it doesn't surprise me that I still don't like it. Still a good choice for beer pong though."
"D - You should not want this beer with a meal. This is a beer for parties, and mass consumption with the intent of making mistakes and NOT driving home soon. If you intend on sipping, add 1 shot of Triple Sec to make is more like a Blue Moon without filling you up. Again, this is a light beer for mass consumption, won't fill you up, but won't impress you either. Drink away on a budget!"
"D: On a warm day this goes down like water. Smooth, clean and crisp. Not offensive, not much flavor."
"First choice for a ""Party"" lager if I had to choose one."
"This is just a boring light lager in general."
"This Is a good beer to have if you just want to get drunk! It's real light and smooth. Easy to drink! What I like about this beer is that you can get a lot of it for a low price! Not a beer to have if your looking for taste! This is a good beer to have once your full and want to keep on drinking! This is nothing special but it's a good beer to have when you just want to drink and save money!"
"Pours clear with yellow tint, and the head was off-putting in its soapy appearance. Nose was lightly floral but mostly devoid of anything recognizable. It was difficult to pick ip any flavor here aside from city drinking water. Fizzy mouthfeel and as drinkable as a glass of skunky tap water, which is forced as appropriate."
"Number one beer my ass. I poured this beer into a pint glass and was not impressed from the start. This light beer has a terrible color even for light beer. Pours a less than yellow color and it smells alcoholic like its non light predecessor. It has a bitter taste to it not a good light beer by any means. Goes down smooth its drinkable probably why fat alocholics drink it."
"Drinkability - This beer was obviously brewed with a hot summer day drinking beer at the lake in mind, because that is about the only place you would want to drink it. Drank for ease of drinking. Not for flavor."
"Just about anything else would be a better choice."
"had this in many different cities across this great land and its too bad this was my beer of choice when i was a young lad. Not at all what I would consider to be a choice for drinking now. I would much rather have water and wont even offer to my friends. I rated this high in drinkability because I think you can drink your own weight of this stuff."
"Normally I would at least give a breakdown of the different qualities of a beer during these reviews... but... This is not beer by any stretch of imagination. uhmmmm it'll get you drunk thats about the only thing kinda positive and it's pretty clear but the rest is straight swill. I'm sorry for wasting space on this review but please stay away if nothing else let this be a public service warning."
"AVOID THIS BEER.."
"As of a week or so ago i can now say i really dislike this beer and i feel as if i have every reason to down this beer in a semi constructive manor because of how great i used to think it was when i was blind to fact that a beer should should have flavors be pleasing, also the fact that i have drank many of these and that being said have spent alot of money on this product."
"Being raised near Dallas I knew of no other beer for way to long! No wonder I never liked beer, I had no idea what it really was. Other than this tasteless, watery, mass produced thing people called ""beer"". Please do America a favor, and don't support this company!"
"Rating a beer like Bud Light is difficult because I know we should rate by style and expectations for the style, but as a person that enjoys the taste of beer, I find it difficult to be objective. When I drink a beer like this, I think to myself this doesn't taste like anything! This beer was very pale yellow with a nice little cap of white foam, perhaps the beer is carbonated differently on-tap compared to in the can/bottle, but this beer had nice head and retention leaving nice layers of lace on the glass. The beer had very little aroma, no hops to speak of and just a bit of corny graininess. The beer is very watery, not much hop bitterness, no malt flavor and there is a little bit of residual sweetness. This is just not what a beer should be. This what you should drink if you are thirsty after mowing the lawn or at a 100F baseball game in the middle of summer."
"So why is this one of the best-selling beers? Marketing alone doesn't explain it, although that's a big part of it. Really, I think there's a large swath if people out there that don't like beer, or don't like it that much, and beer flavored water is palatable. Granted this beer isn't the worst tasting beer I've had, there's nothing off-putting. But that's a little like saying the air in my mouth doesn't taste bad."
"I usually can appreciate all types of beers but this one is just not good. It literally tastes like water with a very slight doughy yeast. Thats it! How can they sell this with confidence? This beer proves that all people care about is getting a buzz.... but even at that! To the regular craft beer drinker you can have literally have 4 or 5 and still feel like you drank a little bit. No hop taste, really no malt not even grainy malt just a lot of water with carbonation and that usual Budweiser yeast taste that is it... and I had this on tap bought by a friend. Definitely not a beer... they should have another name for this beverage."
"I don't even find this to be drinkable, the forced carbonation and lack of any flavor makes me want to steer clear of this and anything like it, like yeah it's kinda refreshing in mouth feel but I can drink a sprite for that same feeling! It's very clean and crisp bit the total lack of favor makes this undrinkable for me"
"Very easy to drink as the alcohol is low and can be gulped down like water."
"Verdict: You get what you pay for. A 12 pack was a notch above $10 for me, which leaves me wondering what kind of amazing six packs of beer have been screaming my name all along. Devoid of flavor, character and body, this beer might play a role of bringing non-beer drinkers into the crowd, but please for the love of beer, don't convince a soul that this is the Zenith of beer. You all know far better than that. I'll close the book on ever considering this my go-to beer. D- (1.85)"
"I picked Bud Light for the inaugural week of Bad Beer Thursdays 2011 because I could not honestly say that I had actually had this beer. I hate Budweiser (the company) as much as the next guy, their market presence dilutes the craft market but as far as a beer goes, this is about as plain and bland as it gets. There's really nothing wrong with it, no off flavors, just a nothing watery beer."
"This is actually my first ever Bud Light. I was already a few beers in and my friends kept trying to convince me to try a Bud Light after I mentioned I never had it. So fine, I may as well get a review out of it. Pours a very pale yellow colour, basically see through. Almost no head retention and lacing. Smells of mild grains I guess, but I'm stretching. Really this smells close to water. I don't get the idea of light beer I guess, I really have only had about 5 in my life."
"BeerAdvocate needed a picture, so I got the can, and might as well rate it. Head is pure white, medium dense foam, which quickly settled down leaving no lace. What lace that can be generated by swirling has no body nor cling. Color is a 1 on the SRM beer color chart. Smell of corn, wet corn. Taste is mild to say the best, not much there, but that of cereal grains, mostly corn. Water has as much mouthfeel as this beer, I guess because this beer is 99.9 percent water anyway. I guess at 4.2 percent alcohol by volume it is better than nothing. Yard work, garage cleaning beer."
"Overall: Buy this only, and I mean only, if you plan to use it for some other purpose than drinking it. I'm sorry to say it's really just awful."
"As pale as yellow can get. Thin wispy white head with little retention. The aroma is faint and I'm not really sure what it is. Taste of corn and cooked vegatables. Can a beer actually be thinner in the mouth than water? If so this is it. The thinnest body on a beer that I've ever drank. If you really want something this light I recommend water. Other than that, the only purpose I see in this beer is to boast, ""I drank a whole 12 pack and I'm not even drunk yet."""
"D: Well, I can drink a lot of water and subsequently bud-light, but I'd rather save myself the calories and drink the water."
"Better than expected."
"D: I can see why this beer is so popular for macro beer drinkers. There's no off putting smell or taste. There's nothing at all to this beer and that's why people will think it's so good. Basically for people who want carbonated water with some alcohol in it. Avoid this if you like any type of beer that actually tastes like something. The only good thing I can really say about this beer is that I prefer it to a regular Budweiser."
"d- fine for chugging, nothing else"
"(This is the beer responsible for making my liver hate me)"
"this beer is the definition of trash. watered down and disgusting. this is for the cliche average drinker who drinks just to get drunk. If your into craft brews this must be left behind. this is the burger king of brews. garbage. i cannot believe so many people i know drink this religiously, i guess it attest to the power of marketing and the average beer drinkers intentions (i.e. getting drunk, not having a tasty well crafted brew)."
"Crystal clear with a pale yellow hue, not much colour there. A bright white cap formed during the pour, falling to a collar in a couple of minutes. Not much aroma, a bit of cereal and sweetness, faint green apple. Same for the flavour, no significant bitterness with just a hint of cereal sweetness and a hint of hops, slightly metallic in the finish. Light bodied with ample carbonation, fair texture. Easy to drink, but not enough flavour to make it worth my while - I don't mind drinking water or soda instead. Not particularly bad, just extremely bland."
"Absolute garbage. I had to review just to take it's pathetic rating down another notch. In the effort of a fair review I'll say this much. Instead of spending millions of dollars in legal fee's and advertising designed to crush small breweries; AB should go back to the drawing board and make a better beer. This light lager ""American style"" pilsner tastes like carbonated water with a metallic finish. I have a lot of respect for the founders and what they accomplished in paving the way for big brewing in America but at the end of the day this is possibly the most over-consumed can of garbage on the market."
"D - what i would call an ideal session bear. readily available and just about everyone imaginable is familiar with it.."
"But it goes over that line with having no features at all. I guess if you want to chug a 12 pack with no problem, pick this up."
"RJT"
"Drinkability - This beer is always a go to beer for me. If I see it I will drink it, just cause of its ease of access."
"D - drinkability is ok, although a little to sweet. There are better american adjunct lagers out there."
"out of the 3 serving types that ive reviewed this under, the bottle and can were about dead even with a C-, where as the on tap version suffered a bit with a D."
"This beer is better during those summer beach days and back yard cookouts where cheap beer is necessary."
"Besides it is no fun being a beer snob. If it all tasted the same how boring would that be?"
"Poured at the end of a long day into a plastic cup. Surprising head that lasted longer than i expected. No real aroma. Clean taste with slight sweetness. Rice? No hop aroma or flavor detected. Fizzy mouthfeel with lots of bubbles. Clean aftertaste. Thirst quenching and enjoyable. A tried and true staple macro lager."
"We all enjoy beer and it would be a boring world if everyone had the same taste buds."
"I wouldn't buy it for myself, but I would buy it for guests because almost everyone I knows swears by Bug Light for some reason."
"D - The appearance is slightly disappointing and this one only proceeds to go down hill from there... I could drink a couple of these in the proper setting, but as you would imagine this is not one I would ever seek out or recommend... There are far superior light and adjunct lagers..."
"D-I would sooner drink pond scum."
"Please, let it be soon."
"IIRC, this is the best selling beer in America, so clearly lots of folks like this brew. I found it to be a fairly average example of the style."
"D - Does not go down too easy because of the flavor. The fact that its watery makes it go down quickly though. I could drink a lot of these, but it would feel like I was punishing myself."
"Pours clear yellow with a very small shirt lived white head. Very little aroma and little to no flavor. Palate very light body and carbonation. Finish is very bland with virtually no flavor. It was the only beer available at a barbecue. Overall did not like this at all."
"D: Others have been giving this a higher rating in this category just because of the popularity. Frankly I find it extremely difficult to get it down because of the high carbonation and awful flavor. It makes me sick."
"Summary: This is a horrible beer. I gave it a 5.9/10, or an F. As far as beer goes, this one's not a good choice. If you're in need of light beer, then I would say it's okay. It's cheap, highly drinkable (because it's basically like drinking water), and can get you drunk if you drink enough of it. In my younger days this was the standard beer of choice for parties (Due to cheapness, availability, and drinkability). This beer loses a lot of points for taste and satisfaction, but gains a few for drinkability. So if you're goal is to get really drunk or supply several guests with beer and save money, then by all means go for this beer. If your goal is to enjoy a great beer, look elsewhere. I wouldn't drink this beer again unless the only other available options were the rest of the commercial light beers."
"D- NO"
"Comments: I have had this beer many times--none of which were by choice. If I could, I would sue the owner of this company for sexual harrassment. As the can is consumed, the taste gradually reaches the threshold of fecal matter-y taste, mixed with the delicious hints of rusted iron gates that just makes you unbelievably happy that you risked physical harm in order to try this delicacy of a 'beer'."
"DRINKABILITY!"
"D- Nothing to savor. Like drinking water with a splash of beer. Nothing to write home about."
"I give straight 2.0 across the A, S, T because I'm ""not impressed"". Not much to say. It's clear, the head is nonexistent, there is no smell. The taste is crisp, dry, very slight hop/malt. Very slight. M and D are average because it's crisp and dry and well carbonated. There are in fact worse ones out there."
"Super bubbly, light, and a hint of dryness. The flavor isn't even close to quality, but for macro lager this is probably better than miller or coors. Either way this is pretty pointless, and with all of these macro beers I still feel like I'm tasting the inside of the can more than what's inside."
"One thing that Budweiser does well is make their product consistent for a large group of people. It always tastes the same. I would drink this on a golf course on a hot day, but not when I want a decent beer."
"Lets be honest, if you're drinking Bud Light you're not drinking it for its flavor or complexities so you shouldn't be surprised that they're not there. Over the years I have played a number of drinking games and downed many pitchers of this stuff. It's not good, but it's not bad. It's just a shame that this is what so many people think of when they think of beer."
"Bud Light is my favorite beer to start when starting a session. It has a better taste than Coors Light and has less of an after taste. The color is light and relatively generic. The smell is relatively non existent. The taste is fairly good. This is fairly easy to drink. It's impressive by any means but I still enjoy it. It is exceptionally better when chilled. This beer in a can can be hard to drink one after another because the flavor becomes bland and dry."
"I have to admit that I was actually excited to review Bud Light. Living in Australia it is only very recently that it has become available and I have always wanted to try the beer that is consumed in larger quantities than any other in the world. Ultimately I have had worse beers because Bud Light is not offensive to drink. It is, however, highly offensive that this watery concoction is called beer."
"Notes: Luckily the United States has been blessed with craft and imported beer. Otherwise, this would be all we'd know. This, Miller, & Coors light. To think, I used to drink this stuff regularly in college. Ick, wouldn't even buy in a keg for the sake of a party."
"This 'bber' pours very pale in color, almost completely see-through with almost no head. The head is white with no laceing after a short time. The beer has a sour sweet smell... odd. Very light sweetness to the taste, must be the rice, but has almost not desserning flavor. Smooth mouth feel. Utimately GROSS!"
"Drinkability: A thoroughly revolting beer. This beer cuts out all flavor in favor of cutting calories. I can't see myself drinking this again; I would probably drink just about anything else rather than have this again."
"D- well this is drinkable, and that's about it. It is actually quite refreshing and can be drank non-stop all night"
"D- I had drank all my Guinness (my usual macro drinking beer) and my parents gave me this. I accepted grudgingly and thought I'd review it. I can't believe they enjoy drinking this."
"Great beer for someone who wants to get drunk, bad for someone who wants flavor."
"D - The one category I can't slam it for. It's about as drinkable as water. Probably because there isn't much more to it."
"Drinkable if you are drinking just for the buzz."
"It pretty much tastes like water with some grain and rice and extremely light floral hops. It's not bad. There's just really nothing to it."
"I really actually don't even consider this to be beer."
"Cracks open and pours a transparent golden yellow with lots of bubbles and a bright white head which climbs 2 fingers high and then quickly diminishes. smells of an American light adjunct lager, a hint of yeast but mainly rice and corn smells, also hints of flowery scents. Tastes pretty decent for an adjunct beer, sweet with heavy notes of grain and cereal. the carbonation is just right, but maybe a bit too intense, giving the beer a kick when you pour back a big sip of it. very bland and average I must say though, nothing stands out to me in the flavor. Mouthfeel is nice... Cold, sweet, and bubbly. I rated a 4 for drinkablity because it is definately a beer that just about anybody could enjoy a few or more of without getting bogged down and full too quickly. overall not bad, I think this would be a good beer drink anytime but probably wont be very enjoyable without pizza or something to add a little flavor between sips."
"D: Easy to drink but I'm not sure that I'd want to. I'd advocate Budweiser over the lite version 99 times out of 100."
"In all fairness Bud light has an unoffensive taste, much better than Keystone, Coors, etc. Like any cheap beer, Bud light taste's like its been skunked 5 min after opening. All in all, buy better beer and drink less, your liver will thank you."
"I still like this beer. Lots of fond memories come from it. Like the time Angus Young took a drink from my cup at the AC/DC concert. Not relevant to the review, I just like telling that story."
"What can one say about Bud Light? Not a whole lot here. Probably the most nonchalant beer ever, although this one seems to have a little more bite than usual. She's pretty yellow, not unlike urine. It tastes OK, and goes down fairly easy. You won't even notice it when you drink it, which isn't always a bad thing."
"Now to the beer. It pours a extraordinarily light pale golden as if water was poured into already lightened beer. The head is a decent white foam that fades quite rapidly. I smelled almost nothing, which I've learned isn't the worst thing. What I do pick up is a bit of corn and wheat sugar and a little bit of sour. The taste is predominately the sweeter corn like tastes that are the preference of many redneck. There is also the bitter tasting backer which i can only assume is the flavor derived from trying to smooth out and lager mass produced grains that are of lower quality. The mouth feel is lightly carbonated as I would expect from the very light body. The drinkability depends on your personal preference. While it may be physically easy to drink this, the more you consume of it the more you will hate your life. And as a funny side note this probably has a similar amount of sugar per volume as Guinness. So why would you choose this? There are cheaper things out there if cost is the issue. Perhaps this is the minimum level of quality people can tolerate drinking in mass quantities. A good standard to note as I soon shall accompany TMoney2591 in Swill Tour 2010."
"It pours a clear pale straw topped by about a finger or so of white foam. The nose is very weak, comprising some very light wheat, rice, and corn syrup notes. The taste ain't much better, with bad blackened wheat and puffed rice dominating the proceedings, while some mildly sweet corn syrup tries vainly to clean things up a bit. (I'm not sure what I mean by that, but it made sense while I typed it.) The body seems infused with helium, with a moderate carbonation and a rather watery feel. Y'know, I have no idea why light beer was invented. Seriously, this just ain't good at all."
"Etc."
"D- Easy to drink. Its a cheep beer, good to drink if there's nothing else."
"D - This is drinkable in the sense that nothing is stopping you from having another (heavy body, alcohol burn, etc.). But why would you want to? Nothing is off or offensive here; it's just too much of nothing."
"typical american light beer cheap enough to drink daily to get buzzed."
"Drinkability: This one makes me wonder how they squeeze so much flavor into Coors Light. Even when grading to style this one is just not good. It is too light and the taste is very off putting. Amongst the big three US macro breweries this is the clear third in light lagers."
"D- You can chug this like no other"
"D - Drain pour. Just unsatisfying. There's nothing going on here but water and hints of something else. I'd rather have a ginger ale at this point, much more flavour."
"D- Not my kind of light beer"
"D - Once again, for large scale drinking. Think ""cooler"" while floating down a river in a tube... No big deal if you spill some, don't want to get too wasted, good for chugging when you are thirsty. I do have these in my fridge most any time for friends and family that don't understand the whole ""good beer"" concept. I myself will even down a few early in the day when I haven't ""committed"" to actually drinking yet."
"I am partially embarrased to admit Bud Light is almost always im my fridge. It's my wifes beer of choice and to be honest on rare occasion its mine too. Bud Light is wonderful for the fact after working outside in 95 degree tempetures I come home about as gross as you can possibly imagine, and I dont want to waste my good and wonderful beer on my compromised state, so i'll have a bud light. Goes down smooth as all hell, I'm pretty sure I can't even taste it anymore, and after one or two of these I'm certainly a bit relaxed, and ready to enjoy the fine beer waiting in the fridge for me."
"Pale straw yellow with a large amount of bubbles and nearly see through. The aroma is clean and dull. Can't really pick out anything more than cereal grains. The body is extremely light and highly carbonated. This is crisp and light and really dances around due to the high carbonation. A bit of grain and a dry finish. There really is no substance behind this beer. Highly carbonated grain flavored water."
"Bud Light is like weak pee. If it didn't have alcohol they could probably pass it off as some sort of tea product. Amazing there are some people out there who swear by it. No hops apparent at all. Slighest hint of cheap grain. Mouthfeel like runoff from a glass of melting ice and like that glass it leaves you feeling lacking - like where's the rest of it. And unpleasant when the cold wears off."
"The yugo of the beer world. Makes me ashamed to admit this is made in America. Pity."
"Someone told me Bud Light tastes like a ham sandwich in a can. I don't necessarily agree, but I understand the sentiment."
"Notes: If I go to a party and this is what they are drinking, I'll go without."
"Appearance is a clear light golden color. Not big in the nose but i can smell a little grain. Taste is nothing to write home about, it of course the typical light lager taste, a little metallic, grainy, very watery. Mouthfeel is thicker than soda, carbonation is good. There is nothing offensive about this beer, so i guess the drinkability is fine. I would rather drink this than a craft beer that has a soapy or skunky taste. Its never something I'll go buy, but when I am out with the guys and they offer me one, sure i'll drink it."
"D: If you don't taste it, you're fine. If you do, you're doomed. Sweet corn adjunct grain pervades the senses. I cannot bring myself to finish the beer; I honestly think it would give me a stomachache. If you must consume Bud Light, swill, don't sip. Admittedly, the bottled version is superior to the canned variety."
"This beer is cleaner than most water, I give it that. But I had no interest in finishing my drink."
"D: Just a step above seltzer water. There's nothing off-putting about this beer, but nothing to enjoy either. It's a perfectly innocuous alcohol delivery device for the beer drinker who doesn't really like beer."
"An average american beer. Cheap enough to be affordable to anyone, and the taste suits everyone. Not too watery, and nothing distinguishable about it. Definitely should only be used as a 30 rack. Light carbonation, just a completely normal beer. Lacking heavily in creativity."
"Even on the cheapo, I'd never think about buying this again. I wish the serving was, like, 8oz or less instead of 24. No worries, my sink is getting a treat!"
"drinkability: its easy to drink, probably because it tastes almost like water."
"D- Better on tap, and better than some light lagers."
"D: Well, I wouldn't drink this for the taste, but for drinkability, it's okay. If I'm not thinking about what I am drinking, or I really don't care (or am desperate to drink) then I'd be okay with this. Otherwise, I'd pass 100% of the time if there are (craft or imported) other options."
"First beer i had. Im not gonna say i went straight to craft. I will remember my roots. When sam adams, stone, or sierra are the only beers available i can count on bud light to keep me going. Perfect for any activity without getting to crazy and respecting beer at the same time. Cheers."
"all in all this is solid beer if you want to knock back a few on a hot summer day for me if its a good beer if there isn't any craft available"
"I have two feelings about this beer if beer is what you want to call it. My opinion is this beer is extremely drinkable because of the fact that it has probably no ingredients to it but water and a bit of alcohol so it goes down really easy on a really hot socal day. Now if your looking for a beer with any kind of flavor or satisfaction id say look elsewhere because this beer offers nothing."
"Served from tap into a 32oz Quaker Steak & Lube Tanker mug. Pours golden yellow with a minimal white head. The lacing was very minimal at the best. Aroma was of wheat and skunk. The flavor was of grain, slight skunk, and water. It was light on the palate with mild carbonation. Overall I have drank this as long as I can remember. It goes down very easy. However it lacks all of the aspects that I enjoy about craft beer (robust aroma and flavors). This one is very generic to put it nicely. The drinkability as far as quantity is good, however I do not usually anticipate the next sip so that hurts the drinkability score. So now I usually only drink this when I'm aiming for mass consumption, because as we all know, the ladies love the stud who can drink the most... Haha"
"Bud Light is far from being a great beer but it is very easy to drink. It is pretty watered down but still somewhat enjoyable. Its got a yellowish color to it. Its not my favorite beer but one that I typically buy quite a bit for its descent price and pack size."
"D - It's a light beer... it is what it is. It has a decent amount of flavor, and is pretty refreshing."
"It's delightful if you're a broke 20 year old college kid serving to your underage guests. Regardless, it's an easy beer to drink over a cheap meal, like a burger, or to drink in order to get smashed. I wouldn't recommend this to any experts. Don't forget the terrible smell."
"Generic thats as much as I can say. Nothing huge as what everybody says, its something you can drink like 15 in one night, but just mainly to get your self drunk. Taste is like horrid, smell cant stand it, color like if a dyhdrated donkey pissed in a glass...!!! To top it off they call it the beer of TEXAS please I would rather have a shiner."
"This is America's best selling beer. It used to be regular Budweiser but since we no longer like carbs and we a are fat Bud light has taken its place. See my review on Labatt Blue Light. They are very similar. They are not completely horrible but they are designed for the American/Canadian working man. Good for refreshing yourself after mowing the lawn or other yard work."
"D - Really doesn't do anything for you and is boring as hell. If it has one redeeming factor it is that it is...great for drinking games!!"
"The drinkability is decent. This beer is so inoffensively bland, that I could easily drink it all night... I choose not to though."
"D- I guess this one's easy to drink. I just don't enjoy it. Used to be my go to beer, but then I started trying craft beer. Well, the rest is history then."
"drinkability - it's easy to drink, although not very flavorful, pointless in most cases when you can grab a light pale with equivalent abv and more flavor, good for drinking games"
"The classic beer my parents drink when I was first growing up. I expected a whole lot from this beer. It seemed like a good beer when I first tried it 10 years, but realize how awful it is. Almost like piss water. After drinking Yuengling, Sam Adams, Leininkugel and a slew of others this beer ranks towards the bottom of the list"
"this is a party beer plane and simple. It doesn't taste great. It doesn't look great. It works great for party games such as beer pong, flip cup, quarters, anchorman, or whatever but it is definitely not a beer to be savored hence i will not do a full review of it. I can only say that as a poor college student it has graced my fridge on multiple occasions."
"Drinkability- I must reiterate that this is a beer for people who dislike the taste of beer. Due to the fact that it hardly has any taste at all, it goes down easily and can be consumed in mass quantities."
"[can - 12 oz] Not much of an aroma. Not much of a taste. Not much of a body. No after taste. Pale yellow color with some light carbonation. Little lacing. Very light sweet and corn aroma. Small head. Kind of reminds me of tonic water. Too thin and watery to really get anything out of."
"Cheers!"
"Not exactly the best beer in the world here. If you do happen to pour it out of the can, you get a bit of white head that can take quite a while to dissipate. The beer itself is a pale yellow, very clear. This beer smells faintly of corn, and that's about all you'll taste too. A lot of carb in this beer which I feel ruins the mouthfeel, making it feel more like drinking soda than a beer. A favorite session beer for many, but not for me."
"Cheers"
"Bud light is like drinking carbonated water. So my girl brought some bottles of this stuff home one day and I knew I never reviewed it, so here it is.. Uhh. Not much to talk about, the appearance is like a stale pale yellow with a thin head that leaves just a little lacing. No smell whatsoever. It tastes like water and just a tad bit of corn that is present in almost all American macros. Feels too bubbly, drinkability is average, like drinking water when you're not thirsty. Good ol' Boood Light."
"Drinkability- not drinkable at all, This is swill. I was only tolerating it because it was my bachelor party and it was my job to get drunk so I did."
"A waste of a perfectly good aluminum can."
"Drinkable in the way that most beverages without character are drinkable. Sure, it goes down easy, but it's so bland as to be a pointless experience in beer drinking. I won't be revisiting this beer again, unless my tastebuds are already so blunted as to be useless. Oh, and in the if-I-need-another-reason-to-avoid-this dept., shortly after drinking this I received major heartburn. To date, no other beer has ever given me heartburn, major or minor."
"Drinkability: Typical of an american macro. Good for the beach or hot summer days as simple refreshment."
"D - It's too bad the keg of ShockTop ran out right away cause this Bud Light just sucks. I'd give it a 1 for how much I dislike this beer, but I'm still continuing to drink it for the effect."
"This beer smells like dog piss. It's a good beer to drink in the morning after being hungover. Do NOT drink this beer if you have the option not to. I put a five for drinkability, because you could drink this beer all night and hardly get a good buzz."
"Put on my double can holder hat with two straws and go down to NASCAR and drink away. This is the beer you stow away for your redneck company comes to visit. Its often cheaper than water, but water has more flavor than this. I will admit it does work good in the smoker while cooking meat, I use it to soak the woodchips and a pan of it in the smoker to keep the humidity up. Wouldn't waste a good beer to do this."
"Poured into a Sam Adams Perfect Pint Glass (my apoligies to the Boston Beer Company). This beer is an extreme pale yellow color. It pours with a white fizzy head that goes away very quickly. Your talking extreme clarity for this beer, not very impressive. The smell isn't strong, but still pretty bad. A hay smell, maybe a little barleyesque, and that's about it. It smells like it's ""skunked"" not very pleasant. The taste also smells like it went bad, like it went rotten and even sour. The mouthfeel is the worst in my opinion. It has a bitter finish, but not in the good hoppy way it goes flat pretty quickly as well. The taste and mouthfeel make it not drinkable at all in my. I tried to be open minded because I'm not generally a fan of light beer, but I've had far better low alcohol beer than this. I'm glad I didn't have to buy this, it was just left over from a get together. I probably haven't had one since college, now I remember why."
"It pours a straw like yellow with a white foam head. Taste is metallic, grassy, with a very very subtle malt/rice sweetness. Incredibly light body with heaps of carbonation. Standard American light lager."
"That being said, if you were at a cookout and this was the only thing in the cooler, you'd probably throw a few down the hatch."
"granted, this is my least favorite beer of all time, but it is gross. It tastes like chalk and does not sit well with me, i can barely get it down, and definitely not enjoy it. They claim this has ""drinkability"" it does not. i find natty to be easier to drink than this. sorry but just not my beer at all."
"A: Their both fucking close to water"
"Drinkability - Very easy to drink, its not something to enjoy, its main purpose is to drink as many as you can. would only recommend if you're partying or at the beach and can drink plenty since after you drink one you can't stop until you're signing sweet caroline at the top of your lungs"
"Really the beer isn't that bad when your hot and tired and just want something cold to drink but other than that I can think of plenty of other better beers to choose from."
"Taste. Litterally this is like bland water. Why would you drink this? Because you hate beer and yourself. Skip this shit!"
"Bud light is probably one of the worst beers out there but everyone drinks it because it is cheap. This beer is probably only being drank by college kids and high schoolers and without them bud light would probably lose 1/2 of the people that actually drink it. If you want to actually taste a good beer or enjoy a beer then dont drink bud light. if you dont care if your beer tastes like water and just want to get drunk then go ahead this buds for you."
"I constantly find myself drinking bud light at parties. It's good for getting you drunk, but that's about all it's good for. I have gotten insanely drunk off bud light. It's so watery you hardly notice you are drinking a beer. If you buy this beer to enjoy the taste, then you might need to get your head checked out."
"Carbonation is a bit high, giving one those huge, totally repulsive burps that so often accompany consumption of a brew of this type. Other than that, I feel the mouthfeel on this is about average for a light lager. Drinkability is also average due to the very mellow alcohol content and that great, non-existent taste. Overall, a very unimpressive, below average light lager that should generally be avoided. The fact that I took time out of my life to review this is a miracle, but I suppose that I have had worse. Always open to trying new things, but this thing is one that you should say ""no thanks"" to."
"Drinkability - The only time I would ever drink this is at a party to get drunk. You'd swear the pong balls make it taste better. It certainly will do the job, but it isn't pleasant to drink by any means. This is the kind of beer you buy by the 30 rack for a night of responsible fun, not the beer you buy by the six pack to savor or pair with food. Sub-average drinkability."
"The only thing worse than this is Miller Light. It wasn't until 18 months ago that I finally discovered what real beer is. On that day I realized how disgusting the BMC I was drinking had become. All politics aside (which is the real reason I hate BMC) Bud light is one of the few that I'll actually admit to drinking. If you find me drinking it however, you'll also find that I'm fresh out of real beer."
"the extra few bucks and actually get a respectable beer."
"I revisited this at a friends house for lack of options. I did not enjoy myself. The color was basically clear. It was like watered down gingerale. The coca-cola head dissipated immediately. The smell was like corn. The taste was like corn. The mouthfeel was disturbing. And as far as drinkability? None."
"If i'm out camping with with my buddies telling some stories, having some brew, looking to enjoy the time and we grab a couple cases....this beer does the trick. My favorite beer is Great Lakes Burning River. It has an average A- rating here while Bud Light has a D-. But thats just the thing. Should I hate on this beer because it is mass marketed. If i could buy a case of Burning River for 16.99 for a night of drinking with my buddies i would. Unfortunately i can't so this beer does the trick for that. All the same if i'm enjoying a beer or two for a night on the couch would i look else where? Yes. But I must reiterate this beer is what it is. Just depends on what your looking for."
"Light yellow in color. Smells cheap and without flavor. Taste is terrible. This beer is clearly just a vehicle for alcohol and nothing more. After taste is funky. If you can get past the taste to drink more than one than I guess is drinkable but for most who know what a good beer should be this won't be drinkable. This beer destroys my stomach and the results weren't pretty on the few occasions I have had to drink it as it was my only option."
"Drinkability - Honestly, this is still my go-to beer if there is ZERO craft beer around. Heck, I'm finishing up the few left over from a BBQ we had a few weeks back. Do I really enjoy it? No. Will I drink it again in the future? Almost certainly yes if there is nothing better. I'm not a beer snob - I know my roots. Yes I drink a 22oz that would buy two cases of this stuff, but hell, when in Rome."
"Final Thoughts - Had one at a friends house as this is all he drinks....His conversion is in process...For anyone else, just dont bother..."
"A cold beer while you are working on the car, or mowing the grass, something that you are going to slam and drink fast, Bud Light is where you need to be. Sure, there are other beers out there that are about the same price, maybe taste a bit better or whatever, but the point here is that Bud Light is the most prominent beer in this country. And it's not too horrible to boot, given the circumstances I've put above. 9 o'clock at night, not too hungry and you want to have a nice beer with some tv? Perhaps a Bud Light is not the best call. However, if you are out to dinner with your in-laws, completely uncomfortable, and you need beer, fast... Maybe even you are trying to pull an all-dayer and you want to have something that says ""beer"" in your hand every second of the day... Bud Light wins every-time."
"One of the few beers I attempt to avoid. just does not taste good even for a mass marketed light beer. Even though it looks and pours like any other beer on the status quo market, it really does not taste very good at all. Almost like the can is marinading the beer."
"We're driving back from Boston on a bus, and one of our seatmates is drinking a beer. Even better, he's offering it to his fellow riders. The only catch is that it's Bud Light he's passing around. The beer is a pale yellow color with a moderate sized white head. It had virtually no aroma. Not much more in the taste, but there was a hint of hops at least. I can't imagine people who like beer would want to drink this, since it's not much better than water."
"It is what it is. Cheap beer. If I were low on cash, it's hot out, or both, this beer does it's job. I do have a problem with the fact that it's sold in 10 different containers/packages. They take up too much shelf space from good beers."
"Overall: Bud Light confuses me more than any other beer. As I've said in my Budweiser review, I love that stuff. This stuff comes across as a very weak and demented younger brother. Stick with the older brother...35 extra calories will not kill you."
"Overall, you could drink several of these at a party or with pizza but its definitely not a standalone beer..."
"If you are on this website, why would you even care about this beer?"
"Tastes of cold carbonated water with no real defined flavor. Very carbonated and fizzy on the tongue. Not a very good beer but if you need to drink 20 of something this is it."
"Oh wait lemme just say one thing as a disclaimer: I've really never had most of the beers that are supposed to be awful. I haven't had Milwaukee's Best, or Natural Light, or Busch, or any of those. If I'm gonna buy cheap beer, I always go for the high alcohol ones (the ""malt liquors""). I have had Miller Lite, Corona Light, and Coors Light and I'd take any of those before this. Coors Light is like alcoholic seltzer. It has no flavor, so it's like whatever. Bud Light, on the other hand, is like carbonated sewer water."
"- i drank enough of this to review, then gave the rest to my friend. would not drink willingly again."
"I would never buy this beer, I didn't buy it this time and after tasting it I will never buy it again. If it tasted like it smelled, maybe but right now no. It is horrible."
"The beer has a pale yellow color with a white head and much carbonation. The aroma seems to a typical bland and musky. The beer has a very light taste although a bit refreshing. When it is served very cold it is easy to drink, especially in large quantities. Typical brew for drinking games."
"D: It tastes bad and has too much CO2. Only finished half."
"Pours a light yellow color, nice carbonation, small white head, with some sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, with some hops, slight caramel. The taste is slightly sweet, malty, slight hop note. Light body. Not drinkable, would not buy again."
"Bottom Line: This beer is bland and gross. Avoid it!"
"Not a good beer. Has a bland flavor and feels like it is water with a little beer added to it. Not a good beer to sit and enjoy. About the only thing it is good for was back in the college days using it for beer pong, or beer bonging it. Girls seem to love the stuff, but I guess that is because it is like water."
"Ironically, this does make the 'drinkability' higher than some, just because it doesn't punish you with a taste of any sort."
"Mouthfeel has lots of carbonation and is very thin. Drinkability would be good except for the boring taste. This is something I'd drink if I was out for a night on campus, not something I'd sit down to enjoy."
"That said, not a bad option for a beer game I guess."
"smooth taste that won't slow you down. average beer with average taste. more of a house party beer than one to drink for enjoyment. but all that probably goes with out saying. beer pong and flip cup eligible.Cheap enough to get you by the hard time, and in the hard times it's light enough that polishing off a case to the head isn't out of the question."
"Bud Light is, however an extremely easy to drink beer."
"Not much can be said positive about this beer. I enjoy Budweiser but the light version sucks. period. I have gone through many cases with college buds, but I wasn't drinking for style either. In the world of BA it's an f. I am going to rank it slightly above miller lite though. Counts for something"
"D- Not my kind of light beer but if its all there is I'd drink it."
"Notes: Similar to others in the system and in the same situation (other Macros)."
"Drinkability: I give it a three, but only because one could drink copious amounts in any sitting. I know I used to drink this a lot before find the wonderful world of craft, but taking trips down memory lane is not always a good idea."
"Mouthfeel is thin like water. Since its not harsh you can drink many of these. I could probably put down 5 before any sort of buzz but I don't think I will."
"If you like water, this Bud's for you. Who says you have to make beer that tastes like beer? Not Anheuser-Busch, that's who. Great for being in college and hating the taste of beer. It looks and tastes marginally more like beer than does vodka. If you want to impress yourself with how much ""beer"" you can drink without hurting yourself, I can think of few better candidates than this one. But alas, it's a suitable intro-to-beer for your friends who haven't yet developed an appreciation for malt, hops, or adjuncts. Also a great contrast to bigger, bolder, ""artsier"" brews. Enjoy?"
"D - Would rather drink water. If served out of the fridge at a close to freezing temp then I can put one down."
"Generally, I only drink this at stadiums where there is not an import vendor. Which is basically nowhere, these days. Today, I drank it for 'experimental' purposes."
"If you dont care what you drink, you might give this a go when you aren't forced at gunpoint."
"Avoid."
"drinkability-i could drink it all day i think if i needed too"
"Overall- It makes me a little nastalgic sometimes about the time I spent with this beer but it isn't anything special. I can't believe I actually used to like this stuff. I mean it isn't the absolute most horrendouse beer I have had but if I had to order the macro lights it would be probably on top of Busch Light, Miller Lite, and Coors Light. I know it is hard to compare beers that are almost identical but there are a few subtle things I like about this one compared to the other clones."
"D: It is ""drinkable"" because it's so water-like, but I really have no desire to drink more of this beer. It's just so bland and flavorless; I would rather take another light lager over this."
"Listen, it is what it is. Some people don't drink for flavor, they drink the easiest thing they can. The only redeeming factor to this beer is the fact that you can drink 400 if it's the only thing around. I get into this situation in remote areas and you just have to get through it. Better than water... maybe..."
"I considered not even reviewing this beer but I was drinking it the other night and I thought I might as well. There's not much I can say about it. It has almost no flavor, certainly no aroma but what was most surprising was the fact that I drank five of them and didn't feel a thing."
"I love bud light talk about a light beer with an exceptional drinkability this is you beer. It pours to a nice yellow darker that bud ice it has a good smell not over powering of anything just right. The taste to me is better than good it is not super light like most light beers. The mouth feel works just right. The drinkablility is perfect I mean not as much abv% but its drinkability makes up for it I mean you can slam one in no time. To me it is all around the best light beer I have had to this date!"
"And in a blind taste I probably could not differentiate between the three."
"Overall, it's Bud Light!"
"This beer is very drinkable. Bud light obviously sells itself, being one of the biggest selling if not the top selling beer in the United States. Not the best beer, tastes cheap, but does the job. Only good served chilled, or ice cold. This beer does have it's place in the world of beer, it's one of those quick handy beers to have around. A novice beer drinker loves this beer because it is very generic."
"i really have nothing good to say about this beer except if you can order something else, go ahead and get it what ever it is, cause nothing can be as bad as what they put in this beer. please be a resonable person and get something that is tasty and goes down smooth."
"Pisslike color and aroma, I dumped the rest out in the toilet where piss belongs."
"Not one of my favorite beers, but I will drink it if I absolutely have to. There isn't much to say about Bud Light. It is what it is: a very light beer, with little taste and flavor. If you're just at a regular bar with a poor beer selection, take Coors Light over Bud Light."
"I will give bud light credit in that it is not totally devoid of taste. The problem is the taste that bud light has is very foul (yeast water). I'll reach for a watery Coors light or Miller light before this swill."
"Taste, if you like the taste of almost nothing, this is your beer. Seriously, I think this beer is ok if you're eating some spicy food on a hot day. That's the only purpose it serves. No mouthfeel, but drinkability is high, relatively speaking, because hey, they made this beer for mass consumption. If a beer drinker wants 2 beers, they should have about 9 of these to equal the legitimate ingredients and effort put into 2 craft brews. Avoid, unless you need to cleanse your palate."
"D: I've had hundreds of these in the past. Since I am originally from St. Louis, this is ""the"" beer I grew up with. Pale lagers are not my beer of choice any more but how can you forget your first love?"
"i am not a snob so i can rate this beer fairly favorable on the drinkability IF there is nothing else to drink and it is free."
"Drinkability: Great for binge drinking but not much else. Its like beer/grain flavoured water."
"Honestly, I should just refer you to my Miller Lite review. I did a side, by side, and other maybe some tiny differences in appearance, they are essentially identical. They both taste like adjunct water, with hops as an afterthought. They drink fairly easy physically because they are thin, however, since they don't taste super, I would rather not finish large quantities."
"Poured from a brown 22 oz. bottle. Has a very pale yellow color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is very mild, not really able to detect anything. Taste appears to be awol as well. Hard to describe, basically flavorless. Feels light in the mouth. Drinkability ain't bad, much like water. Overall there is not much to recomnend about this beer."
"I can give it a good rating for drinkability though. It's a beer that you can drink all day and not get (any more) tired of it. I don't know. ll around, I'm not going to drink this beer unless I'm drinking to forget. And hopefully I'll forget how awful this beer is."
"As for the taste, well it's not a ""1.0-Awful"" for me, but it's damn close. Cooked corn and a slight vegetal note with the usual tinge of skunkiness that most Budweiser products are famous for...crisp, drying mineral finish. Uber-light body with a good carbonation level--like water, but with the tiniest microcosm of beer qualities thrown in (read: carbonation). Yep, this is a light lager, but you can't deny that drinkability (*stifled chortle*)...still, as the counterpart to a minor league hockey game, or any other sporting event for that matter, it does an okay job."
"Overall, we've had this beer before, take your chances, you know what you are looking for by now, this is probably not your first choice, nor is it mine. Cheers."
"Don't need to say much about this one since everyone has had it since their teenage years. Does it have a great taste? Not really. Does it have a great appearance or mouthfeel? Nope. Can you drink a lot of it? Yes you can and sometimes that's what you need but lets just move on."
"Mouthfeel- Very thin with low carbonation."
"OK. I will try to fair. I am not a huge macro lite drinker, but some of'em are not too bad. However...this is pretty horrible beer. I love original Bud, but this is probably the worst beer i;ve ever had. Why it is so big escapes me. It has no taste(well, some kind of funky flavor). It's just a puckerin sort of fizzy thing that is abrasive. In the attempt to offend absolutely no one, they are pleasing no one. Drink Bud, but do not drink this. At All."
"Notes - The carbonation did provide a nice mouthfeel."
"D - Unthinkable and undrinkable"
"This is not a terrible beer... not like bud light clamato... but it is pretty flavorless and unimpressive. It pours crystal clear, light, and with little head and lacks lace (probably because novice drinkers don't want or appreciate a thick head). The smell is funky, light, and smells like old, stale Pale Ale. The beer tastes like alcoholic perrier... again, not terrible, but nothing to it. There is literally no finish. Possibly as a marketing ploy to keep people drinking it rapidly. I wouldn't say this is the worst beer... but it's pretty bad."
"Did a taste test with this and High Life which is not light I know but was so much better compared to this. There is a certain taste in AB products that is always the same. Not sure what it is but never liked it, even when I was 19 and drank the cheapest stuff I could find (Pfeiffer's)"
"This is what it is. It is not a heavy beer that you can drink lots of. This is the way to go if you have a party and need tons of beer. It pours a golden yellow with a white foamy head. Lots of carbonation. Not much taste or mouthfeel. It is a drinkable beer."
"Yeah so I am glad they use a different malt/hops ratio different than regular bud, because we know what's never been done before. GOld body, white foamy head. Aromas are metallic, corn, sugar. taste is sweet corn, some detectable hops and mineral. Inoffensive, but theres nothing here...and I dont drink beer for nothing."
"Pours a very pale straw with two fingers of fluffy white head. Head dissipates fairly quick, leaving no lace behind. Lots of visible carbonation. Has a faint grainy aroma. Tastes like pale lager diluted with seltzer. Thin & seltzery mouthfeel, light bodied and highly carbonated. Bland, inoffensive, insipid."
"Just pulled this out of the cellar, figured I'd give it a review after a few years of good aging. I actually found this in the back of my fridge left over from my roommate's birthday party we threw last weekend. Never really drank too many of these, figured I'd give it a review. Normal pale yellow look to it, highly carbonated, pretty bad grainy adjunct smell. Taste is like carbonated water with a sour/metallic taste at the finish. Not very appetizing at all. I'm pretty glad I played beer pong with Sierra Nevada pales instead of this."
"The mouthfeel is okay, but nothing impressive. It is certainly drinkable, but it wouldn't be one of my first choices."
"This beer sucks. Sorry, I tried to be objective, but I can't. Somehow, AB sells enough of this crap everyday to float the entire American navy. I don't know how people love this stuff so much. It blows my mind completely every time I see one of my idiot friends pound a dozen of them and seem happy about it. Whatever though, I wouldn't change it if I was AB due to the rediculously high sales, so I guess we don't have much to look forward to with this beer. Don't buy it."
"Nothing other than water with alcohol in it. Zero substance."
"D - This is very easy to drink, possibly easier to drink than water. It has a remarkable lack of flavor. Bud heavy has some grainy malt and green apple off flavors, but this is a truly clean beer. This beer is the equivalent of some mad scientist managing to create an actual army of zombies; the sheer wrongness of its existence is abhorrent, but at the same time one can't help but marvel at the technical achievement. And in the end, that is really what this beer is, an empty, soulless, horrifically drinkable, zombie of a beer."
"Poured from bottle into pilsner glass. Serving temp was about 33-35F. Poured a very bright gold, for some reason reminded me of lemonade. Strong adjunct aroma with no real character. Just didn't like anything about this beer, except maybe the appearance it was close to what an light lager would be I guess. Had a strong hop bite and for some reason gave me a headache after having it. I could not drink this again and glad I didn't pay for it. Horrible."
"Sure, macro breweries use multimillion dollar ad campaigns, but hey, they earned it didn't they? Anheuser-Busch is an example of the American dream at its finest. I respect that. I am going to go get drunk now. :)"
"Drinkabilty- You could pound these back all night. Absolutely made for quantity over quality. After three or four, they go down like water. If you're looking for a session in a 30 pack, this is for you. If you're looking for flavor, appreciation, and a respectable beer, look elsewhere."
"Bud Light pours a bright straw color with a fluffy white head, from the longneck. It smells of grains, and not much else. The taste is pretty much the same, grains. There is a sharp bite of carbonation, and the coldness is getting to me. This is the beer that defines drinkability, they go down like water."
"Overall: I am glad that you are reading this. Seriously, I am drinking this pig piss so that I can tell all to stay clear of this beer. I feel as if I doing community service here. Malt is flavorless & funky, no body, awful aroma,....you know what Im done with this, to the sink I go..."
"This is one of several beers that is keeping craft beer in a tiny portion of the market and makes BAs look like pretentious yuppies"
"D- This is a drinkable beer in the sence that you can pound them left and right because they don't have a real taste to them. But to actually sit back and drink them and ponder well they are not that drinkable then to me. I gave it a middle of the road rating on this because of these two facts."
"Overall - This is one to avoid. The least good of the BMC light beers IMO (Well, except for Bud select...). Stick to the ""regular"" versions of adjunct lagers if that's your thing."
"D: drinkable because it doesnt taste like anything... ranks above Coors but below Miller in my light beer rankings"
"D - Thats what the advertise! Don't believe it though."
"To be fair, how can anyone knock this because we all have drank a ton of this in our formative years. Did anyone really start their drinking careeres on Sierra, and never sway, that's hard to believe. It is a generic tasting beer with clever marketing and the best ditribution arm in the business.It just not a very good beer."
"Overall, not something I enjoy drinking. I will throw a pickle in this one to give it a little more flavor. This beer is not my type of thing. I won't drink this one unless someone offers me one."
"Cheers!"
"In essence, this stuff is bad, even for cheap light beer this stuff is bad. Miller light is better, coors light is better, even Natty Light is better. But of course, this is the #1 beer in the world."
"Drinkability: Uh, no. Sorry, but this is everything that is wrong with American macro brews. Watery, terrible (and almost non-existent) flavors and just a waste of time. Just another reminder of why I have NEVER been a drinker of light beers in my life. Hate the stuff, especially the big macros like Coors, Miller and Bud. It's just watered down bad beer. Yuck."
"Not sure why this is so popular, marketing I guess. Doesn't exactly look like a beer but it looks like it hopes to wish to want to be a beer some day. I gave it the extra .5 on appearance because it had some bubbles in it. Tastes and smells like not a whole lot, maybe like somebody filled half the glass with a very light pilsner and than filled the rest of the glass with water. There's a slight trace of some grainy like flavors but even then they aren't very good, whatever they are."
"I had a pitcher of this tonight with some pizza. Pretty much the color of piss with a light a bubbly head. To be honest, I think the only reason I actually drink Bud light is because everyone does 5$ pitchers of it and being a cheap college kid thats a pretty good deal. Make sure you have some food (pizza) to wash it down with. I have to agree, calling this a beer could probably be considered a misdemeanor."
"Awful stuff."
"one of my fav beers...i see a bud light i think of cookouts,horseshoes,great times with family and friends.a fresh bud light the taste is great not over powerin and drinks so smooth..and dosent give u a hang over the next day ilike some other beers...bud light for the win!!!"
"It is what it is. Going solely off the style, I've had plenty that are worse. Nice for yard work, golfing, or beer pong. Tastes the same from 1st to last. It has its place in my drinking rotation...afterall, I can't sit and pound down DIPAs during a 5 hour marathon NASCAR race!"
"Diet beer tastes like diet beer. Lack of color to match the lack of taste. It does have alot of carbonation combined with the lack of flavor combine well on a hot day to be a better alternative to selzer wtaer to quench your thirst. Not a good beer, but not totally bad either."
"Pale golden yellow. Smells of sweet fermented rice with a little skunky lemon. Tastes like nothing: beer water, sweat? Mouthfeel is like sparkling water. Drinkability is high, but why? Do not understand why people would drink this. What's to like? Drink water if you are thirsty."
"What upsets me is 95% of the beer sold in America is bud/miller/cools light! With such amazing beer brewed in this country it's so sad that this is what most people drink."
"This is the beer of choice of my friends. It pours pale yellow, almost looking like fizzy piss. All I smell is water with a faint hint of beer flavor. The taste is crisp, yet bland. There is not much to say about this beer. The mouthfeel is non-existent. It's there and gone before you know it. Drinkability is good though. If you want to watch a ballgame, get it, you can actually stand the agony of defeat if you have enough of these..."
"Ok. This honestly tastes like watered-down Budweiser. It is not worth the time dissecting such a one-dimensional beer. It can be refreshing on a hot day, I can say that much. But this beer is not one to reach for if one is seeking aroma, taste and/or mouthfeel."
"Not recommended, there are far better light beers out there than this."
"I'd never willinging drink this beer again."
"Pours a very light yellow color, not completely see through with little head. The aroma is of grain and water. The taste is of slight grains, not as watery as other light adjuncts. The mouthfeel is lightly carbonated. Overall it is slightly more drinkabile than other beers of this style."
"For a bud product it is ok. For a beer it is terrible. I'd put this up at the top of my macro light lager category though. I tend to prefer Bud Light to Miller lite and Coors Light. It, like all macro light lagers, is very drinkable. I primarily only drink this at frat parties and the sort as I refuse to buy this kind of beer for myself if something else is available."
"How could you even get buzzed off of this beer? Is there even alcohol in it? Is this high fructose corn syrup beer safe to drink? What the hell is this crap? Its my life goal to avert people from drinking this thinking its beer."
"drinkablity is easy and smooth...You can drink all night long with zero taste change."
"Drinkability is only good with drinking games, beyond that, please get something else to party or socialize with."
"This beer is watery and not much else good can be said about it. Others have said it better than I can. Mouthfeel is weak, taste is atrocious, and poured appearance is without obvious merit. Drinkability would be adequate for the non-discrimiinatory palate, but would not satisfy the more erudite person."
"I tried to keep my expectations low since this is a light macro, but I was still disappointed. Even among lights, this is still sub-par."
"Out of a 24oz. can this beer was a bleached, gold color with a snow-white head. The two fingers of fluffy bubbles did not retain very well but the lacing was pretty good. The aroma was of macro grains, hints of pale malt and sweet malt, a light sourness and some stale notes. The flavors were of pale malt, macro grains and faint floral hops at the end which added a crisp finish. I liked this better than regular Budweiser because it was not as astringent and was thus easier to drink. The mouthfeel was average or a little rough, the body was light and the carbonation high. Boring? Yes. But drinkable and good during a hot summer day."
"Drinkability: The difference IS, in fact, drinkability. Sure, it's damn drinkable and could be had any time, anywhere- but it lacks in so many other areas that it really isn't worth it. The problem with this (and most other light macro brews) is not necessarily that they're BAD, they're just so unremarkable that there's nothing worth noting. While I could drink these all damn day, I don't think I'd want to. Gets a 5 for being ""drinkable"" but bumped down to a 3 in this category for being so unimpressive as a whole."
"A standard American macro lager. Nothing great, but I don't expect a macro light lager to be full of flavor."
"Super light and watery."
"I had not had a Bud for a few decades since the last one i had had at a cookout was awful. But maybe I was just being a snob and it was a hot day at Citizen Park and I was thirsty. So I thought that a cold Bud can't be all that bad. I was wrong. The mouthfeel was like water but it had a vaguely beer like smell that made me think that this was going to taste like a beer. it didn't."
"Another softball refugee beer. I only have Bud Light if absolutely nothing else is available after softball games or when watching sports. Mostly because it gives me headaches. It also has very little flavor, so I go elsewhere if I want a light lager."
"D: This is what it is, maybe the blandest of the light beers (Miller Light at least has some flavor, while Coors light has a wierd aftertaste). Meant for easy drinking and in signficant quantities, when you're doing that it fits the bill perfectly."
"A drier version of the American adjunct light lager. Whereas Miller is sweeter, Bud Light is a little drier with more pronounced carbonation showing through. Like Miller Lite, it is a definite beer for long chugging sessions. Buzz is guaranteed. So is an overflowing bladder and numbed taste buds, forgotten nights, discarded clothing, etc. A beer for long parties where sustainability is key and drunkeness is the goal. Taste? Seriously, WTF? Are we drinking this style for our dedication to craftmanship here? What the hell!"
"This is essentially seltzer water. It's terribly watered-down and flavorless and there's really no enjoyment in drinking it."
"The ubiquitous But Light. Had a bottle over at my Uncle Mike's. Watery, to say the least. Very little flavor, but not unpleasant. No aftertaste, but not much actual taste either. As the ads say, quite drinkable, which is better than nothing, and low cal. I can see why people who want to get drunk fast suck these things down--you could down a six pack without noticing it."
"Cheers!"
"Pours from the 12 oz can a pale golden color with a foamy one finger white head. It's about as fizzy as one would expect. Aroma--I mowed my lawn late yesterday, too late to rake up the clippings because it got too dark. It rained overnight. The smell of those soaked grass clippings...that's the aroma of Bud Light. Taste is of club soda with a few ounces of beer mixed in. Mouthfeel is on par with the aforementioned club soda. I do give it high marks for drinkability. It has that, but not much else. Anheuser-Busch was wise to use the ""drinkability"" aspect of this beer as its sales pitch, because that's all it has going for it. I was offered the remainder of a 30-pack of this stuff (about 14 cans) at the end of an after-work tailgate party, and I accepted it purely to be polite. This beer was absolutely free and I still feel that I overpaid for it! I'll never cough up a dime for this, and the only way I plan on drinking this again is if my only alternative is dying of thirst!!!"
"Judging apples to apples and oranges to oranges it is the best American Light Lager to drink. Other reviews will be kiwis to kiwis based on its gender of course. This is my review and I am sticking to it!"
"Overall, not great, but from the bottle at least it is the least objectionable of the mass-markets. D+"
"d- i guess ill rate 3 for drinkability mainly on the price. its not a BAD beer, but its definatly nowhere near good. but being as cheap as it is it often winds up being the fall back party beer :( i wont turn one down.... buy i typically dont ever PAY for bud light."
"Pours a pale crystal clear yellow with a one-inch bubbly head that dissolves quickly and leaves no hint there ever was one. Aroma is faint sweet caramel, no hops to speak of and a little bit of yeast? Flavor has a little more of that caramel flavor although light and has a touch of earthy hops. Very light-bodied beer which I suppose makes for easy and quick drinking. While its not good its also not completely terrible. Pretty sure I'd rather drink this from the bottle rather than a glass."
"but hey this is college for me and it is still a step up from what is at some parties. It was a good excuse to use my Denver aquarium pint glass, yaay!"
"Thin bodied as it should be for the style. Snappy carbonation."
"Drinkability: Not very good as it is too carbonated for me. It is good for beer pong, but I would rather drink regular Bud."
"D - Well, for the first few sips, it *does* come off as refreshing, but that's a mirage. I could finish it, sure...but there just isn't anything to catch your interest in the slightest. You'd get far more out of a pint of Guinness Draught or Boddingtons, if you want something this light. As always, if you're going to drink it, drink it cold and quick. It starts to *decouple* somehow as it warms; not good."
"D: You could drink these one after another. But one must ask themselves why have another when ther are so many other beers to try and enjoy?"
"D - Well, there isn't enough taste to hamper its drinkability. It's beer flavored seltzer."
"Taste is more of the same, carbonated water with just a mild sake-like rice alcohol flavor and touches of graininess here and there. I dont get any maltiness or hop flavor. I really think the carbonation adds the most flavor here. At least bud light has something other beers dont...drinkability ;)"
"This beer is very popular and loved by so many. I am not one of those people. It pours very light yellow. Neither the smell, nor the taste are desirable. I must say the quality is not good. There was a time when I liked this, but it was when i was a young boy and before I tried anything else. I can understand why someone from europe would laugh at the united states for making this. I hope Inbev can help."
"Bud Light is good if you want to chug and get wasted w/ your friends and save money. But, I'd rather use Pabt's blue Ribbon for that because it's better than Bud Light. Bud Light is really not my favorite beer but man does the Bucsh company have an awesome theme park!"
"Did a side by side with Coors Light and it barely won. Pale, pale color pour wit a very thin ring of head. If you really try you can smell some faint grains, possibly some corn -but honestly it was really hard to smell over the food that was next to it. Tastes crisp, clean (as advertised). There's nothing to offend in the palate, but nothing to like really. I could drink a million of these but frankly I'd rather have something cheaper if I were getting something along these lines."
"Final Thoughts: Pretty much yellow water with alcohol. Haha some added flavors as well. Very drinkable"
"D-I really can't get through one without acute, sharp pain behind my eyes. Seriously. I have no idea what it is in this beverage that causes this. Arsenic?"
"Palest yellow with a fizzy white head that fades really quickly into a skim. Smells shitty and faintly sour, rice and other spent grain round out the nose. Tastes dry and faintly of used up adjuncts. Watery, seltzer mouthfeel. Drinkable only at a ballgame out of a plastic cup when you're truly parched."
"Notes: Consumed and reviewed back to back in both can and bottle form."
"Foam was light,light wheat in color that dissapated real quick with a serious carbonation issue. The color was a light gold almost yellow water. Smell was crisp and very small hints of hops. Absolutely no contribution to the senses. Taste, what taste? There was a feeling of 'no taste' involved except subtle hints of hops. Mouthfeel - crisp, carbonated. Drinkability - for me, it was hard drinking a beer with no taste compared to most other beers."
"D: this is the ""light"" version of the ""king of beers"" but i've difinately had better light beers"
"Drinkability/Final thoughts - Well first off, Ill start by saying, not bad at all. Iv been meaning to pick up some BL and review it, I just thought that it wasn't going to be a pleasurable experience. I really like the drinkability of this, and the flavors don't get boring or tiring, just enough flavor to be thirst quenching and leave you wanting more, and pairs well with any food, especially Mexican! Decent lite beer in my opinion, Id say give it a try, you just might like it. Cheers!"
"D: This is ""drinking game"" drinkable. It's not skunky and I won't spit it out, but it lacks any real taste and the mouthfeel is absolutely atrocious."
"I'll tell you, this beer isnt the worst beer ive tried in my life. In fact it doesnt even taste all that much different than water... I will here, in part, describe the differences between this beer and regular tap water. Smells like nothing, in fact it smells a lot like corn, plus sugar? Very Yellow, and very not carbonated. It tastes a whole lot like cardboard mixed with a small bit of corn, plus a small bit of malt roastedness at the end. Its very easy going down, and almost, but not entirely drinkable. However, im sure at $1.95 a 24 ounce can, its acceptable for the american macro... Dont drink this, unless you're forced at knife point. however if you're out of any sort of good beer, and this beer is within walking distance.... and its the only beer sold at the store, go ahead and pick up one.... but dont drink it, unless you're already very drunk, like me."
"Very light bodied, high crisp carbonation"
"Drinkability, I guess all of those commercials were right, it has superior drinkabilty. The drinkability of water."
"Drinkability: the pure lack of any flavor make this hard to drink. Go find a Sam Adams Light if you want some flavor in the style."
"Pours a pale, straw color with 1 fingers worth of head that fades with minimal lacing. Not much smell, just some slight sweetness and slight graininess. Taste is mostly carbonation, with just a trace of bitterness and a fast, clean finish. Now, I'm not claiming Bud Light is some god-send of a beer, but for the style of American Macro Light Lager, its one of the better ones. Its very clean, refreshing and drinkable. It is what it is."
"This really isn't the worst beer, it is just hard to believe this is the only beer some people will ever drink."
"D: Not flavorful at all, goes down very easily and not filling at all since there's nothing to it, not too filling, very mild kick, it's certainly a light beer but there are definitely other light beers that I would pick first if I had to."
"This beer, as well as many ab products, gives me a splitting headache. I had one pint, with food last night, and woke up in pain, the drinkability score suffers slightly for this"
"I do not drink this unless it is the only thing left. It just has never impressed me especially the taste just leaving a horrible taste in my mouth."
"D- I would have to respectfully disagree with the numerous advertisements of bud light having ""superior drinkability"". Maybe my definition of drinkability is just different. All I know is that I don't want to drink another so it's got to have low drinkability."
"Pours a light golden color that's more on the straw side. Standard white head about a finger or two. Tastes very weak, very thin and watery with hints of corn husk and rice with just a small amount of almost unnoticeable hops. Standard mouthfeel. Drinkability is very high seeing that this is borderline carbonated water."
"overall - still only barely tolerable on tap instead of bottled. Seriously, why bother?"
"Drinkability: It goes down easily. It bubbles enough to make me burp more often than I would care to, though. I can see why people drink it, though I cannot see why people say that they enjoy it."
"Has it's place in the drinking games world, but no where else"
"Alright, I'm bored so here I go. There is literally anything I cant say about this beer thats already been said. Its a cheap macro beer but it has its purpose. As for the characteristics its easy...fizzy, yellow, smells like cereal, tastes like adjuncts, high carbonation, watery, crisp mouthfeel, ect...Here's my defense of this, its an easy drinking beverage. Notice I wont say beer. I'm sorry, but when its 115 in the summer a cold one of these actually can hit the spot. I'd take it over a cold water after working outside in the summer. Lets face it, us BA's dont drink this for taste. You drink it cause you're thirsty or cause your at a buddies house having a few too many in the first place. It is what it is."
"yet another yard work beer that can fall off the garden tractor without hard feelings."
"Appearance is a straw yellow with a quickly dissapating crisp head and no lace. Smell of very light adjunct. Taste of light sweet corn thats watered down and highly carbonated. Mouthfeel is light and not much else to it. If someone were to hand me one in the future I would surely ask ""is there anything else available?"""
"Not as drinkable as Coors Light. It starts out looking OK, like any other light American lager, and goes downhill from there. While it is more flavorful than Coors, that is not a good thing when the predominant flavor is urine. Buy in a 30, bring it on a fishing boat, thats all it is good for."
"Blah, the only time I drink this is at a ball game or golfing in the summer when there is literally nothing else to chose from. Inoffensive and generic. Not the worst thing in the world, but whats the point?"
"Verdict: This tastes like college to me. A somewhat fuller body and more pronounced flavor profile than many in this style, but still amazingly bland and shallow. If faced with a choice between a Bud Light, Miller Lite, or Coors Light I suppose this is would be my second choice."
"D: Gave this a 2.5 based on the sheer ounces I've had in my lifetime. Gosh dang college..."
"D 3.5 - If a mellow clean watery light beer is what you are after, this is for you! I like it better than a lot of other macro light beers."
"gateway beer of choice for many women..."
"Taste: Very little taste but a little bit of a doughy flavor with no bitterness"
"Bud Light used to be the delicacy for me before turning 21 and discovering the real world of beer. In college, when I had extra money and wanted something more than Natural Light, I would go for a Bud Light. I'm sure everyone has had one. The color is a bright yellow and smells of light beer. It doesn't have much taste other than some carbonation. Not a bad light beer, but that's not saying too much. Not bad when budget is concerned and you're not wanting anything heavy."
"This is maybe the most maligned beer around these parts, with good reason. While I can enjoy a Bud, Bud Light is just tasteless. Pours with little head that quickly dissipates, and leaves little to no lacing. Smell is inoffensive and mostly grainy, little else to it. Taste? Well there isn't much but its very watery grain, I couldn't get much hops at all, and there aren't very strong flavors of any type that I can find. There is no reason to drink this save for two situations. 1. you don't like beer but want a buzz. 2. Its very hot or you are engaging in strenuous activity and you want to chug down a light beer that is a least slightly better than drinking water. Very slightly. I can't see any reason to not drink regular Budweiser over this, except that has some decent beer flavor and maybe you hate that."
"Mouthfeel is just overly carbonated. Supposedly these boys are all about drinkability, but let's face it, if you think its crap, you're typically not gonna want to be downing them all day. For an American macro, I'm sure its a real ""classic"" but for beer, I'm not amused. Some people are afraid of change so if you've been drinking this stuff all your life, keep doing what you do if you must. Personally, I don't think I can go back to this anymore and thats cool with me."
"Luckily a friend stopped by with some Bud Light. I would not purchase this on my own. I figured what the hell, I'll give it a review. It poured very clear with basically no head. The smell was not good, kinda sweet. It has very little taste, a bit on the sweet side but nothing to write home about. It is very drinkable since it tastes and goes down like water, not as bad as Coors Light though. Obviously, they are doing something right or they would not be the most popular beer. You have to please the masses and this seems to work. I will not partake in the macrobrew bashing that is common on this site. It is not my favorite but who am I to argue with a bunch of hiilbillies?"
"O: meh. Your typical AAL."
"Yea this beer is drinkable, it's supposed to be... and hell, if you havn;t had anything to drink all day out on the golf course, its downright refreshing. however you'll never really ENJOY sitting down and drinking one...(which i understand isn't really the purpose of it) for you may have to drink several to enjoy yourself. i dont want to slam it, but i dont feel all that bad considering it sells like hotcakes"
"Overall a very poorly made beer that its sole purpose is to get wasted cheaply. If you are serious about beer, avoid it at all cost!!"
"Final Thoughts: To quote Bud Light's advertising, ""The difference is drinkability"". Indeed, that difference is the only thing that separates this beer from the bad beer that it is, to the outright offensive failure it could have been. I almost feel guilty pawning this stuff off on my poker buddies, so needless to say I won't be buying more. I'd probably only buy it again if I wanted something light, and it was the only light beer."
"It hurts me to say this, as I grew up in St. Louis area, but this has to be the worst mass-marketed ""light"" lager of all. Very little color, very little head or lacing. Just a very boring, flat beer with little taste. ""Drinkability""? I guess you can call it that if you just slame them. A very, very boring beer. Give me water instead. What's funny to me is it tastes little like Budweiser - which is a pretty good beer if you only have a few."
"Finally decided to review this because my roommate bought an 18 pack and my fridge is full of them. So this is one way instead of pouring the rest out. Poured a white foamy head that dispated fairly quickly to about nothing. Has a bit of carbination, the only decent thing in the look. Color is just light yellow. Smell cant really smell much. Taste not much of anything here. No hops detected, no malt flavor, maybe corn. Followed my a funky aftertaste. Mouthfeel of water. Drinkability about the only thing this has going for it since there isnt much to this beer i can see why people can put so many of these down. It will be a long time till I ever drink another one of these. Already my stomach is starting to hate me."
"Had a couple Bud Lights on tap earlier today. Arrived with a small white head. Carbonation was fairly light. Faint smell of adjunct rice and a little metallic aroma. The taste was not much different from the smell. The mouthfeel felt more substantial than when I had it from a bottle or can."
"Drinkability is what really gets me here. It is just too carbonated. After even just 2 or 3 (because there is no reason to drink BL if you are only having 1) I find I can't do it, I am too full of gas."
"drinkability yea their commercials lie this isn't drinkable or even passing off as drinkable"
"Drinkability- Do I loose my beer geek status if I say that this actually tasted good at the time I drank it? Was damn thirtsy and wasn't going to get to the beer store until the next day. Hit the spot to be perfectly honest. I guess it's true what they say...there is always a time and a place for every beer."
"Please don't snob the drinker of this beer. Educate him softly; buy him a ""good"" lager or wheat to set him on his exploratory journey into the great world of beer."
"I was quite depressed to know that this is the best selling brand in America. I will continue to avoid this along with many other light American lagers (I refuse to call these pilsners)."
"D - It's going to have to get a high score. I mean wouldn't you consider water very drinkable?"
"When it comes down to it this beer is not good, but on days when I've landscaped outside and had someone offer me an ice cold one and I've never said no, and since it's so light and carbonated it's refreshing on those hot summer days. Drinkable, but obviously a keg party brew."
"the difference is drinkability? the difference is a mouthfeel like a soda. the difference is flavorless content. the difference is we can just fill up the troughs with this one, and americans will slip up on all fours to lap it up. christ."
"Extremely drinkable, aside from the bad taste. Very thin and refreshing on a hot day."
"Drinkability - I suppose if it were a very very hot night and you were very very thirsty and one or two of these were ice cold, well... there are still lots of better options."
"It is truly amazing that this is the best selling beer in the U.S."
"D- The low ABV make this very sessionable but the flavor makes it undesirable. I could go through quite a number of cans at once but i would not be able to look at myself in the mirror afterwards. With that said this beer has a place in the market and serves it's purpose to supply the masses with something quick and easy."
"Drinking Bud Light is like test driving a Kia after having owned a real car."
"D- OK for what it is."
"Probably just beating a dead horse here... This was the choice beer of my social group in high school. I was thrilled to find out that there are other beers that don't taste like fizz water. It's one redeeming quality is that it doesn't taste bad, per se, so you can drink a lot of them fast, hence its popularity (that and advertising). Don't get this beer if you enjoy beer for its taste."
"The taste is that of water, its really only ok to use for beer pong."
"thanks, i will now step down from my soap box."
"D: I had this beer while I was out one evening recently for the first time in probably 15 years. Now I remember why I hadn't had it in so long."
"D: Easy enough to gulp down and, I suppose, refreshing. Not my idea at all of what a beer 'should' be, but I suppose it has it's place in the world. Just not my world."
"I outlawed this from my home years ago when AB was running that STUPID Real men of Genius add on the radio every two minutes or whatever STUPID,I will die of thirst before I ever buy a Bud Light ! Not because it tastes like crap but because their adds were so STUPID !"
"This beer does live up to it's name, light. It is great to have a beer that is not too heavy for drinking in front of the grille in the hot summer."
"Was offered one of these as I watched the Sabres with family. Not much to get excited about here. Poured very clear with a diluted look to it. Smell was like a beer had been in the bottle, drained, rinsed, and then you get a slight whiff of beer type characteristics. Taste was what I remember and expected very watered down and not offensive. Doesn't exactly make me want to keep drinking. Mouthfeel is thin with some moderate carbonation...very light. Drinkability is low but I wouldn't be a jerk to family and refuse it. Michelob Ultra on th other hand would be refused at all costs."
"Superior...just kidding. Not much flavor, smell or happening in the beer so there is plenty left to be desired."
"Before drinking this bottle, I had not consumed a Bud Light for quite some time. I was in the mood for something light and my mom brought by some ""beer she had left over from the holidays"" so I gave in a try. For what it is meant to be, it isn't bad. Went down smooth and didn't necessarily taste bad. We all know what a Bud Light looks like and tastes like, so I won't beat a dead horse here. BL is like water, but that's what it is supposed to be. Overall - I will drink this beer again in the summer, on a boat, in the sun. I could drink many of them without feeling full."
"Oh man. I can see the drinkability slapping me right in the face out of the glass. Pours a very light yellow with maybe a touch of green, exceptional clarity and a big poofy soapy head that dies down after a minute or two but actually has some retention. Aroma reminds me of smelling the inside of a beruit cup 2 days after anyone's played. This may be what they actually want it to smell like but my association of the aroma with actual garbage does not make me want to drink this. Decent malt flavor at first, give way to a slightly sweet, soapy, metallic taste. I am not completely repulsed by this beer, as I am with Miller Lite. Unfortunately, this beer still reeks of what would be the stale second runnings of what makes up a somewhat decent beer, even further thinned out with rice. Very smooth, dry finish with a pleasant husk flavor towards the end. Mouthfeel seems appropriate.. I've seen worse in other craft beers people claim are amazing. As for the famed drinkability of this, I just had 1/3 of a liter of it and will finish the bottle. But I could just as easily set it aside and not drink it."
"In conclusion, if you are looking for cheap lower calorie beer, let's face it, you could do much better for just a few cents more."
"This beer only has one thing to it and that is for cheap mass consumption. Besides that, I cant see why people still drink this crap. It has no flavor whatsoever."
"What can I say, looks, smells and tastes like a light beer. It has a good carbonation to it that mask's its lack of taste and substance. You really shouldn't expect much with a light beer to begin with, so that is where the lack of disappointment comes from. It's very easy to drink (but its very easy to drink water isn't it?) so thats a plus. Overall, not the worst light beer I've ever had, but I would never pay to drink it."
"Pure junk.."
"So this is the little brother of Budweiser... or should I say, this is the little pansyass brother of Budweiser. Poured a pale straw yellow with a slight foam of a head that nearly disappeared after I poured it. Smelled of corn husk, cabbage, and pale malts. I hardly detected any hops... perhaps the little bit I thought I smelled was all in my head. Anyway, this is obviously a very light beer. It is highly carbonated and nearly tasteless. Very watery, although semi-thirstquenching. Eh. Perhaps I'll just get water."
"This beer should be kept in the back of the fridge until the neighbor or family member you least enjoy comes over and then offer him/her this selection and enjoy the ""other"" beers on your own."
"The aroma and palette have the strange signature soapiness. Somewhat refreshing, easy drink if you don't mind the flavor."
"drinkability- it's really hard to drink something if it tastes bad and this does."
"The official beer of Winter Texan hockey, sometimes before, and seemingly always after. Not as strong a smell as regular Budweiser and significantly less calories. Tastes better in bottles than in cans (which is saying a lot) I don't find the metallic aftertaste good at all."
"(rated Sep 2, 2008)"
"Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: A carbonated thin and watery beer. I could drink it but why would I. It doesnt taste like anything and doesnt really smell like much of anything. If you like this beer you dont like beer."
"D - Drinkability is good. The lack of aroma and flavor make this brew fairly drinkable. It is bland overall but gets points for being to style. If there was a little more going on with this beer (maybe some more pale malt or hop presence) it could be really good. I can't help but imagine this beer as a blank canvas that could be ""painted"" upon to create something really special. But, as is, this one is pretty uneventful."
"Drinkability: as long as you can stand the smell and the lack of taste, it is a pretty easy beer to drink; I never crave this beer though, it just goes down easy"
"At the pour there is thick white foamy head that dissipates quickly. The color is a very pale yellow with carbonation bubbles. the aroma is corn, malt and yeast. The tast is corny, malty, and slightly yeasty. The mouth feel is flat and watery, no finish. Extremely bland beer."
"If you could somehow drink the terrible color ""whitish-yellow", it would be just like drinking bud light."
"Drinkability: Decently drinkable, but I'd prefer water. It's not unpleasant or offensive, nor harsh or chemically, it's just not very good. Pass on this one."
"Vic, you're an a$$hole for sending this. I'm sure your fridge is stocked full of it. I hope all your relatives buy you a case of this for Christmas."
"Possibly the best beer one can obtain, in college. Perfect to get faced with as the hangover is not as bad as Miller or Coors. Again, the pour is fizzy yellow water. The taste is more watered down corn and rice, but with extra corn syrup. Do-able, not preferable."
"Why do we even do this to ourselves? This is what we are rising up against. But this is the optimal light american lager: meant to be conumed in great amounts while building a tree house, watching a baseball game or playing a softball game. It's good for what it is, but what it is is not good. It's like a bad handjob: ypu gotta appreciate what happening, but ti's pretty awful and you just want it over with."
"Served in a can. One of the most popular, if not THE most popular beer in America. While Light Lager's aren't exactly my favorite beer, Bud Light isn't bad. It's the ideal definition of a watered down beer. Doesn't really have much of a taste to it. It'll get you drunk, but I wouldn't drink it for the taste. I prefer this over Miller Light, Coors Light, and Budweiser. Definitely a very drinkable beer in large quantities and definitely much better than the Keystone and Natty's of the world."
"This beer is one of beers that reminds me as to why when I got older I promised myself that I would drink better beer. We got a pitcher, as the others didn't want Bud, which I would have preferred, poured half a cup and proceeded to slow drink the thing all night, as I could barely stomach it. It was pale yellow in color with a huge head, that was gone in 15 seconds or less, it had a faint grainy smell to it, same with the taste, no real flavor to it. Like I said I could only handle half a cup. Stay away."
"I think this is the first beer I ever had in high school. Used to drink these all the time and thought they were the best thing ever. Now I'm still only in college and I usually avoid it. I get it now from time to time on tap, or if its on sale, but I have found that there are much better alternatives. This is a party/tailgating/beer pong beer and not much more, and I would personally choose natty light for those just because its cheaper and honestly less watered down tasting and a better tasting beer. Bud light is not really a bad beer, its just not that good."
" Overall sounds pretty good doesn't it???(if your a thirsty robot. but the funny thing is millions of folks love this stuff. but then again, millions of people like diet pepsi too!!"
"Better than Miller's light beer, but I prefer Coors if we are talking about the big 3."
"Well, it sure goes down, like, um, you guessed it. I can't fault this for tasting bad, as it really is the picture of flavour neutrality, like too many other widely available products that I will refrain from naming here. What I can't seem to grok is drinking a case of these over an evening's activities - I'd much prefer a few well-made strong drinks, with unadulterated water in between."
"One day I'll get my old man to try something different... one day."
"A light amber color (almost too pale) that appears clear. A light head with little if no lacing. Weak lager flavor that is bitter in the aftertaste. Light, crisp mouth-feel and is a little too carbonated. Overall a beer the might be good for getting drunk but not too quickly. Not a beer too enjoy for flavor - would not recommend."
"Drinkability is low. You could argue sessionability because of low alc etc, but I can't see drinking these in bulk anymore unless I'm trying to get hammered. There's more flavorful ways to do that anyway, so I think next time I'll leave Bud Light on the shelves."
"the mouthfeel is bad, and the drinability is as poor as any beverage alcoholic or not as I have ever tasted."
"D: I suppose ice cold this beer will work. For me it is instant headache if I consume more than two. A real frowzy beer. For the money I can hit the Strohs, High Life, or PBR and get a winner, sorry bud."
"I really don't recomend this beer."
"This beer is absolutely horrible. I will never place this beer in my mouth again. The color is like piss and the taste is not much far removed. The carbonation and corn flavanols give this beer a horrible beginning, middle, and disguisting after taste that was only ended by my Samuel Adams Boston Ale."
"D- Better than regular Bud. At least I can tolerate Bud Light. I drink this beer to get wasted there's no other good purpose for it."
"Drinkability: Better than water but not my preference"
"I know it is easy to risk ones ""beerness"" status when giving a budget beer anything over a 2.0, but honestly I believe the AB got it right with their new commercial campaign. The difference is drinkability and Bud Light has it. Unlike Miller Lite, which needs to be numbingly cold, BL can actually move to the not freezing side and still be pretty good. Everyone needs a good budget beer, for me BL provides that"
"It's a light straw yellow. It smells like nothing and a tiny touch of iron-ish metallic. it tastes like it was made with unsweetened cornflakes(which is not necessarily horrible if that's what you're looking for). It feels decent in my mouth, and I could drink them one after another, but if I was going to do that, I would drink a Session lager. it's only 20 more calories, and it's about 20 times better."
"Golden transparent hue with frothy head. Almost no aroma whatsoever that I can determine. Tastes almost as bland as the aroma but a few hop flavors show through as well as some grains. This is the most watered down beer I have had among the Miller-Coors and Anheuser-Busch companies."
"drinkability: very easy, goes down easier than water. good for drinking games"
"D: Well, it's certainly inoffensive, at least in the sense that it contains absolutely zero off flavors, or flavors of any sort actually. It would be refreshing on a hot day, but that's about the only use for this beer."
"Very pale colored beer with a very rapidly fading head.Taste like all AB products are fresh and smooth.Another light lager that is refreshing and made for those hot summer days.This is something I'll always purchase no matter how many new beers come out on the market!!"
"Little lit of grain and some citrusy notes too. Other than than, this is a pretty bland light beer. Little to no head retention and the aroma is only noticeable from about an inch away. Given, it is a light beer so I can't bash it too much. I guess it's alright for a beer in this category. Nothing special but not a terrible choice."
"D- For light lagers, I'd far rather go with Miller lite as it has more character, by far. This is ok, but not even decent."
"D= Easily drinkable in the sense that there are no ""bad"" flavors to slow you down. In fact, there aren't really any flavors to get in the way."
"D/O: As others have opined, this is more like a beer-flavored beverage (water/club soda/seltzer) than an actual beer. I guess for what A/B is trying to do with it it hits the mark, but there are certainly better light lager options out there if that's your thing. At least the Phillies bottle will look good on my shelf."
"This was probably one of the first beers I ever tried. It's cheap and really at that age, I didn't know any better. The color is a pale yellow and pours out initially with a moderate amount of foam which completely dissipates into nothing. It has a very bland taste to it, almost completely like water. A lot of carbonation. Truly, it's the beer to drink when all you want to do is get drunk...and even then it will take far too many than I care to spend my money on!"
"D: Drinkability was bad, very corny flavor, with green stalks and a high carbonation factor all which leads to a big fizzy disappointment. Will make your grimace with every sip and consider pouring it down the drain."
"Notes: I went to College in St. Louis (SLU) and so there was a time when Bud (and therefore Bud Light) was ""my hometown beer."" Man I wasted a lot of taste/time on them."
"Bud Light is a solid choice in its category in my opinion. Nothing about the beer is particularly exceptional. The look is pale yellow, it poors very average with little head, and the taste is very bland and unnoticable. But in each of these categories, it rises above other brands of similar style like Coors Light, Miller, etc. and it seems to have more flavor than it's counterparts."
"A really genuinely bad beer, but not really any worse than anything else of this style. It's not so much offensive as it is tasteless."
"What more can be said about this? For what it is, which is a social party beer, it does its job certainly. My only gripe with it is that it's basically the same price as micro's yet people still insist on getting this. A 30 pack +tax/deposit will run you like $22! If you want cheap beer you can get Natty Light or Gennesse among others for about half the price and they taste the same!"
"end of story"
"D- Better than regular Bud. At least I can tolerate Bud Light. I can actually finish a can without feeling the need to go throw up."
"Just happy to be done with it."
"Nutty thing about this one is that you see people buying 30 packs of this or other lite macros. I just don't get it."
"Taste was too light to be enjoyable. Good for getting drunk, but tough to actually enjoy for the taste."
"Overall: dear bud light, it's over. don't call, don't write"
"This didn't taste horrible until I really sat down and thought about it. Can't choke this down unless nearly frozen. No BMC bashing here - this really isn't good at all."
"It's better than Budweiser, which I never could drink. A barely drinkable, mass produced Pale Lager that only has a little bit of a foul taste to go along with the watery, sweet corn, grainy, malty mixture. I don't hate Bud Light but that may be because the Bud Light commercials are at least funny."
"Once again made for mass consumption and not the enjoyment of tasting beer. I am drinking only for the purpose of reviewing."
"Looks a little less interesting than a typical macro lager. Light yellow with barely a sizzle of foam. Smells like the urinals at a football game. Tastes like watered down stale...grain?. Too thin and lightly carbonated to feel much of anything but regret. Even using this in a beer funnel is shameful. Completely refraining from hyperbole, this is the worst beer ever created by man."
"Tastes of light malt and rice, and rather highly carbonated, yet typically cloaking of the style. Surely better in a glass than via the bottle, not sure I can say that for many an Amerian (macro)-brew..."
"unfortunately this was my first beer and i almost swore away all of beers goodness because if all beer tasted like this, i couldn't handle it. i would probably be thinner and have more money, but i wouldn't be happy :-P"
"I can drink a 12 pack of these and not suffer any ill effects. I prefer better beer, but when I'm slumming it (which is quite frequently as of late), I'm not too proud to buy some Bud Light. It doesnt taste bad, and if I drink enough it gets me where I want to be!"
"I am not here to defend one of the biggest selling beers on the planet, but understand the context for having a beer like this."
"I think that this is why Bud Light is such a huge seller. Lay people (non-BAs) just want to drink something cold that gives them a buzz, and this is what Bud Light bottles are all about."
"Well I've put rating this one off for a long time, truth is I haven't had one since I started rating beers. Downed a handful of these this morning during a golf scramble. No great or even good redeeming qualities, another light beer that will only give you a headache."
"Poured a pale straw yellow with a thin white head that dissipated quickly. Aroma was cereal grains with a slight hint of malt and hops. Taste was cereal grains, but for an light lager I caught some hops and malt. Thin, a little more water with a lot of carbonation. Not much flavor but you could pound a lot of these in a sitting."
"The taste is watery with a flat note of wet bran cereal and a tang of sour spent grain. At approximately 22 ounces remaining of the original 24, Bud Light proved my most voluminous drainpour to date. I hate to play ""Pile On", but the beer really, truly, truly, sucks. Donkeys."
"It is obvious to me that beers such as this are not meant to be sipped or enjoyed but rather quaffed, ""shotgunned", or beer bonged. Not really the type of thing that I am interested in anymore. Being that I live in Busch territory many of the local establishments exclusively carry AB products, especially if I venture out into the rural areas. When confronted with this I typically opt for an Amber Bock if they have it, or else a regular Budweiser or Coca-Cola for that matter, but this stuff is just too light for me. It is supposed to be smoothe and refreshing but I suppose an ice cold seltzer water is as well. Might as well save my money and pick up Stroh's or PBR instead for something with more flavor."
"Drinkability: Is this a joke?"
"I just had one of these at a baseball game where it was the only beer available. I was glad to have something to quench my thirst. Like other American light pilsner-style lagers, the color is very pale and the flavor is difficult to detect. Very little head or body. But, hey, at a hot Texas ballpark in July, it does help you beat the heat without adding too many calories to your belly budget."
"D. I had a few, since I was thirsty and they were free. I shut myself off after 3. I just couldn't do it anymore."
"mouthfeel is crisp, highly carbonated, everything is way too light for my tastes."
"this beer pours a clear amber with minimal white head. The smell is not complex and all and just reminds me of drinking cheap beer. The taste is very slight with the mildest flavor of nuts with no hop taste @ all. The mouthfeel is ok I mean its not the greatest tasting beer but its not uncomfortable in my mouth. I must admit it is a beer I drink after I am buzzed... purely for monetary reasons, can't justify to myself drinking quality beer when I am not there enough to enjoy it."
"Like many, I drank a Bud light because it was the only choice at a gathering. There is really nothing to be said for this bland brew -- it completely lacks any presence or complexity. BL tastes faintly beer-like, but definitely not malty or hoppy, although there is a cold well-carbonated crispness. It's sad that BL reflects the quintessential american beer taste."
"This beer is thin, watery, has barely any smell, and I can't even describe the flavor, because this beer makes me literally gag. So I guess you could say the aftertaste of this beer is vomit. I wish I could give it a zero on taste and drinkability. I don't understand how my friends can chug these by the bucket at a bar."
"Overall an unimpressive brew. Good for washing food down on a hot day. Best thing to say is, it could be worse."
"This beer gets the job done but its not worth the damage to my liver to drink it. In my opinion its one of the worst beers in the world. Its drinkable with some salt and a lime and also if ice cold and in a beer bong at a college party."
"Drinkability: The best, just pop the top and drink, smooth nothing offensive left in your mouth."
"This is not a beer I would drink with any regularity whatsoever but it makes a pretty drinkable camping beer. Smell aside, not a bad macro."
"I think I would have to say that BL mite be my favorite Macro. When I cannot afford good beer, I always end up running to the supermarket and grab these. Also, since alot of my friends dont drink good beer, they usually buy this. It IS good for BBQs, the beach, and parties because its cheap and plentiful"
"D - Avoid at all cost."
"No redeeming features of this product."
"As stated before I can drink the worse water and have no problem, but this stuff makes me cringe...it's horrible."
"The only time I enjoyed this is when I won it a serious game of Texas Hold 'Em, other than that, it's not on my list of beers to get."
"Someone bought a bottle of this for my birthday, and how can you turn that down? Might as well review this beer, considering I drank about a million of these in college, so many years ago. Unimpressive appearance, pale yellow. Smell is almost nonexistent. Taste is actually tolerable, some grain and a hint of crisp malt flavor. Until it warms up, that is. At that point, things go south and it's pretty bad. Gotta drink this beer cold, that's for sure."
"This was definitely the first beer that I had ever tasted (a long time a go and the only reason why I'm reviewing it) and didn't think I could finish it. Last night while at a birthday party I tried to actually analyze the flavors instead of mindlessly downing it and found that it had light cereal grain (first time I detected ""cereal grain"" and could recognize it), corn, slightly metallic (even from a bottle), and undoubtedly there must be rice involved (the abv has to come from somewhere!). Barely any hop presence. This stuff is bubbly and watery and hopefully cold. Miller light probably has more of a pilsner, light barley malt taste in it but it still doesn't make it much better. It has a strange afterbite in it that I cannot pinpoint. This is soda water with a drop of bad tasting beer in it. Yet it is drinkable because of how non-existent it is (I gave it a 3.5 for drink) so if you're drinking/chugging as fast as you can you can catch a buzz."
"Compared to Coors Light or even regular Coors, it looks, tastes, and feels better."
"So, I ran out of Sierra Nevada at my sister's graduation party and had to switch to these. UGH! Pee-yellow, light carbonation, impressive head for what it is. Smells faintly of corn and malts. Taste is completely watered down. So watered down in fact, I added some lemonade to it and created a shandy which made it taste like watered down lemonade. Not a good beer by any means."
"Um...I don't really know what to say. It's not good, okay, I mean, it's really terrible. It looks like pee-pee, and it smells like corn, and maybe some slight sweet malt. The nose and flavor are incredibly weak maltiness, with absolutely no hops...as in, I don't think they actually use hops in this ""beer."" Sad but true. Feel is thin and weak. I dunno, it gets you drunk, but it's truly awful."
"D: Not again"
"D: The Bud Light was easy to drink. And since I found that it wasn't lacking in character, I could have another. If light beer was something I wanted in my life, I might pick this one up again."
"For a light beer expirience that provides low calories, with exceptional flavor and drinkability, Sam Adams light does the trick well. It is no wonder the rest of the world shames our beer drinking palate, when this crap brew is the number one seller in America."
"This is the beer that most of my friends routinely drink, and I'm not so sure why. It's weak, it smells awful, and it goes down like yellow water...if you know what I mean. Never retains head, minimal lacing, bad taste, bad smell. There's really nothing redeemable about this beer at all."
"Very Very Very average beer. If your intentions are to consume as much fermented grain as possible than this is ok but other than that find a better beer!"
"Poured in American pint glass. Almost complete lack of head, but some lacing did remain. Translucent yellow color, eerily similar to urine. Very effervescent, and this showed through in the taste. Bright flavour, very active, but without substance. Watery mouthfeel. The taste disappeared almost midway through, although a bit of an unpleasant aftertaste surfaced. I remember some good times with this beer, but find it hard to drink more than half of one now."
"and you'll be right."
"Bud Light is simultaneously AB's most popular product and one of its worst. Budweiser, on the other hand, is actually not too bad."
"I tried this beer (for the first time ever) on April 14, 2008 after purchasing from one of my local LCBO outlets. The beer pours a very translucent pale yellow (almost clear with yellow food colouring added to give it a tinge of colour). The aroma is weakly malty, with nothing else. The mouthfeel was very thin, watery with little carbonation. The flavour was watery as well, again water with a little bit of artificial beer taste added. I have to admit, while there was nothing spectacular about this beer, it went down very fast."
"P.S.- I don't like light beers"
"A pale staw color with a tan head. The mell is of old hops and some malt syrup. The taste is similar. Not much different than water. Sparkling yellow water that is. Bitter is the main component. Body is light with a heavy carbonation. Not the most drinkable light beer. Good for cooking perhaps? Pairs well with a NASCAR race."
"This used to be the beer of choice when I was under 21, but I've found that Bud Light steered me away from beer in general for quite a while. I'm only drinking this one because a buddy left some over here one night. With this being a lot of people's idea of ""beer," it's no wonder hardly anyone understands the beverage."
"They had a party at work, I had a bud light in a glass. Pourred a fizy yellow (suprise) and head dissipated quickly down to nothing, aroma of corn and water, flavor was about as bland as could be, a hint of malt. Sweet flavor and mouthfell, I could not finsh the glass, just plain awful."
"It is about as boring of a beer as you can have. I only rate it as I have it in my fridge, leftovers from a party. I find nothing appealing about this beer. I suppose for some, it is the drinkability that makes it so *good*....make no mistake, it is only ""drinkable"" because it is so weak. There is only a mild hint of any beer flavoring. In fact, at first taste, it feels more like seltzer water than beer. I only get this beer for guests at parties, otherwise, I would never ever buy this. I firmly recommend you walk away from this one in your grocer's beverage aisle."
"Why drink beer that is ""good"" for you? Talk about a sacrifice in taste. Pours a timid yellow with a laughable head. Smells of water mixed with malt. Tastes just the same. If your at the races, drink this beer until your heart's content. Good for BBQ's also after you light the grill!"
"Big pass. No flavor, barely any color, there's just nothing here."
"Mouthfeel/drinkability... Here's the one area where this ""beer"" does better - because it's basically soda, you can drink these until your eyeballs start floating. Unfortunately, you're dealing with that taste, like sparkling water with something in it. Just not pleasant at all. A beer when it's quantity over quality."
"Over the years I have had many light beers. College will do that to you. Bud light follows the suite of BUD, over commercialized not very good beer. It makes you railize the power of the media. I love beer and if this was one of the inly choices, I'd drink milk or water. Pours very light with little real flovor. head is crisp yet bland. ranks low as far as light beers"
"It has a little bit of a wheat smell, although I can only tell the smell when somebody who has had too much of this spills it onto my jeans."
"down like slightly contaminated water. You can have a lot and not feel too bloated. I think there are other alternatives to cheap beer that are better, like a yuengling. Its sort of sad that America thinks of this as America's Beer. There is so much more out there."
"Typcial appearance, taste and smell for this variety of beer. Listed on this site countless times. Very consistent. Very watery and light mouthfeel. It's nothing special, nor is it intended to be. Best light beer in America?? IMO that's not really an achievement. This is cheap and easy, and good if you're thirsty. But guess what? Water is also good if you're thirsty."
"Pours very pale straw with a big head which dissipates leaving little lacing. Typical macro aroma. Grassy and corn. Taste is very weak. Adjuncts and a whisper of hops. Watery really. Not terribly offensive but not at all good. Extremely light mouthfeel but you wouldn't want this to be heavy. Overall about what you would expect."
"So, Bud Light....everybody has tried it at some point in time. I had it for the first time in a long time the other night (I know A-B employees so I'm forced to drink it when I'm around them) and my opinion hasn't changed much. It's easy to slug as long as it's cold but let it warm up and you might as well water somebodies plants that you don't like. If you're over the age of 24 and/or not in college...find a new ""normal"" life is too short."
"I haven't had a Bud Light in about 6 months and a friend of mine left this bottle at my house, so I figured it was about time for me to review it. If anything Bud Light is a pretty beer. I poured this into a Blue Moon pint glass and it pours a light crystal clear straw with huge carbonation bubbles that cause a big, white, frothy head. Aroma is non-existent. All you can get it just a slight hint of corn, otherwise it's like sticking your nose in a glass of water. I really don't like the taste of Bud Light. Not because it's flavorless but because I think it tastes like banana Laughy Taffy. Mouthfeel is as thin as it gets. The best thing about a Bud Light is its drinkability. Easy to pound on a hot day or when your playing beer pong."
"Disgusting."
"Avoid this beer at all costs unless this is the only option you have."
"D/M - Over carbonated and rather thin. Not much else going on. Simple, mindless beer."
"This Bud Light was served to me in a 25 oz. mug. It was yellow and fizzy, as the good folks at Stone Brewing would say. Absolutely no head on top. Not much odor on the nose except some grainy corn. I was surprised to detect a slight hint of sweetness at the beginning of each sip. However, that was quckly overtaken by the corny graininess and then that, too, was quickly washed away by the high, fizzy carbonation. The carbonation actually created a decent mouthfeel. Overall, Bud Light wasn't as bad as I expected it to be this time but I doubt I will be drinking it again any time soon unless it is free at a party or something."
"How or why do people drink this crap. I was visiting a relative who had a bottle of this in the fridge. Why not, I'll do a beer review of a beer I wouldn't dream of purchasing on its own. The look is pale, plenty of carbonation, and a pure white slightly frothy head. The smell isn't that bad, a little dextrous, plenty of diacetyl, some cooked vegetables. Largely inoffensive smell. And then there is the taste. Man, is this bad. Straw, cooked vegetables until the utter sinews of the plants have been boiled down to the quick, no hops, and I mean none. There is an ugly malty sweetness, plenty of water and lightness, and this just doesn't taste like beer. This is going down the drain quickly. Avoid, unless you want to punish your tastebuds or see how the other half lives."
"It poured with an initially big, foamy, bone-white head, but it experienced low retention. The color was a really light lemon-yellow with NE-quality clarity. It struck me as too light and too clear to hold out much hope. The nose had an unusually sweet quality that I could not put my finger on. Still, it was going to be much too sweet for my liking. The mouthfeel was light, airy, I felt like I was drinking liquid cotton. There was very little flavor on the tongue. It was so watery and tasteless that in a blind taste test with bottled water, I doubt that I could tell them apart. This is what I had been drinking in the navy when I was MUCH younger?!? Swill! The finish had a light sweetness, but it just seemed like it had been completely stripped of anything that might even be loosely construed as taste. I'll keep the bottle-can and pass the other to my buddy, but I would not recommend this mess to my worst enemy."
"D: I'd normally give something of this style a bit of a break with the drinkability since it's so light and easy to drink... but I don't want to drink this. This is probably the worst of the worst. I did, however, enjoy another one later in the evening. This beer is only good for Louisville Chugger. Man, I did not respect beer that night, lol."
"D-As can be expected from the smell and appearance it does'nt have much to offer, hop and malt flavor are almost non-existent."
"Taste/mouthfeel - A touch of cereal grain sweetness, no bitterness whatsoever. Not much else to it. Beyond light-bodied; more watery than anything. Excessive carbonation creates a fizzy, club soda-like mouthfeel. This is without a doubt the blandest beer I've tried thus far. I guess that's the point, but it's definitely not my thing. I'll take a pils or helles lager instead."
"appearance is clear yellow there isant much auroma. taste is pretty bland but thats okay just take big drinks. mouthfeel is light and the drinkability is good."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: It's light bodied. Carbonation is on the light side. It is watered down and goes down easy. But, it has virtually no flavor which makes it difficult to drink. All in all, this is not a good beer."
"Nectar of the Gods! How can anyone honestly dislike bud light? That would be ludicrous! This is the ultimate party beer! It's everywhere you go! It tastes great, isn't too filling, has a great mouthfeel, and has a smell that will make you want more. If I was stuck drinking any beer for the rest of my life, this would hands down be my choice. Numero uno in my book. mmm bud light"
"Carbonation is horrid. It seems they upped it in an effort to wash out some of the flavor, or lack thereof. There are so many better, and cheaper, session beers out there that I have trouble understanding why this one is purchased."
"D: Very easy to drink. It's not something I would pay for unless I was just looking to get drunk."
"D - In college, this was acceptable, but not now. This is a vessle for the alcohol, only."
"D-I choose taste over low calories any day. I'll only buy this stuff if it's dollar beer night."
"For mass marketed crap, it's mostly inoffensive tasteless nonsense. Drinks down easy like water is the best thing I can say about it. It's alcoholic water, mmmm...but alas worth the 25 cents I spent on it to try it and learn about another beer. Cause you can't even make a phone call for a quarter anymore."
"Drinkability - Poor. I would not want another one. I had this at a party and that one time was enough."
"Appearence clear yellow and no head big disapointment. Smell not much adjunents and cheep ingredients no hops. Taste about the same as the smell when will they learn a few cents on ingredients meens a huge differance. Mouthfeel thin watery high carbonation. Drinkability only if its free otherwise avoid."
"With the big beer makers push to try and convince people that they actually use hops I tried hard for any incling of a hop taste. That got me focusing on the tastee so things went down hill. Hopefully the big players do not use the hop shortage to try and dent the inroads craft brewing has made to the masses."
"D: Realistically, there is not much more to this than water. I couldn't bring myself to shell out extra money for flavours which are somewhat unpleasant rather than sparkling water. Unfortunately, it's not even mmuch for swill on a hot day... needs a bit more of everything to be passable in that regard."
"Light clear gold, with decent bright white head that doesn't last. Watery flavor but crisp carbonation (overly crisp though) and a light, light malt flavor. Not much happening here, but there is the faintest touch of bitterness. Better than miller lite at least.."
"All in all, Bud Light is my least favorite of the macro offerings. I can enjoy a Budweiser every once in a while as well as a Coors Light. But when I want something cold and refreshing, Ill stick to Miller High Life. If I recall properly, this one can should give me a splitting headache within the next few minutes."
"Well, what can you say? It is what it is. Fairly watery. Not much like beer. Dominated by weak grainy flavors, like wet cheerios. Sadly, this is the only beer that many people drink. It may quench your thirst, but I can't say I find it particularly enjoyable. Even in the light lager category, search elsewhere."
"why waste your time, unless you just need something to help you p. if you are drinking this it is likely because you are in college and are looking for a buzz.. not because you like beer."
"It looked very very pale with a weak white head. The smell was extremely clean, not much to speak of here. The taste was very clean and dry with light notes of grain husk and wet cardboard. It doesn't feel good in the mouth at all, too much carbonation. I wouldn't drink this again."
"It is what it is folks; an american light lager from the B in CMB. The beer is straw yellow color with a large bubbled foamy head. The head fades quickly and does not lace. The smell definitely has some adjuncts in it and the taste is crisp and clean but not impressive, just average for the style. (If I was rating this on a flat scale instead of by style, it would get a 1.) The mouth feel is very thin, but it is a highly drinkable beer as is demonstrated by the unimaginable numebr of cases they sell each week."
"Overall: To my tastes, it tastes like water, with only a slight hint of beer flavors. I'd rather just either buy water, or a Michelob (if limited to macros). Can't see any reason to drink Bud Light. Its drinkable, but doesn't offer any advantages over water."
"D- not for me"
"Drinkability is non-existent. Inert, not as pleasant as plain water from the tap. Couldn't finish this one. First drain pour of 2008."
"It was straw yellow and very clear/watery. The smell was of cheap beer without character and was a great reflection of its taste. It was very bland and watery and definitely had to hold my breath to get it all down. A great shotgun beer and also good for beer pong but other than that not very drinkable."
"Appearance is yellow and fizzy. Smells like something funky. Taste if ice cold - watery with some rice, malt and unidentifable funkiness. Taste if less than ice cold - unidentifiable funkiness. If you have to drink something weak and slammable, please pick something else. There are waterier beers without the assy flavor if Bud Light and there are light beers with slightly more flavor. This is the worst of both worlds."
"As for drinkability, given the sheer number of people who do drink it, obviously it goes down easy, and you can drink a lot of them in a night. But, in terms of drinkability for flavor and for enjoying it, stay the hell away from this one."
"Transparent foamy and urine-like in appearance. Typical shameful presence of corn, metal, dirt, and hay found within the aroma and taste. Very light and watery. Decent carbonation. Easy to drink just like water is but the taste is very mediocre. If somebody's buying these all night at a bar I'll drink them because they're free but I don't buy them myself. It's better than no beer at all... And that's about it."
"Every beer has its place. I got this last night at the hotel buffet. It was free and the only beer available. It did a pretty good job of quenching my thirst and getting me ready to have better beer later on."
"Drink about two and you're in the bathroom. Leaves you bloated and just not a very good beer, all round."
"By this time, everyone's brains had been washed thoroughly and they went to Walmart to buy my bottled pee."
"bière blonde légère industrielle, avec une mousse chimique, sans grand intérêt. odeur de malt, maïs et autres produits substitut, en bouche elle est liquide et très légère,rafraichissante comme de l'eau, petit goût métallique. elle est sans grand intérêt pour les amateurs. pour les journées chaudes."
"D: I've drank many of these in one sitting, but now I can hardly stomach one. Tastes like bitter metal."
"I recently shared some of this with pizza at an after rehearsal choir gathering, appropriately served very cold. A witty choir member announced, ""tastes like pretzels."" Her comment was as generous as it was caustic. This is not at all a good beer, but it is decent among the very poor American light lager style, certainly preferable to Natural Light and other undrinkable beers. In fact, I'd choose Bud Light over Dogfish Head's chicory stout, and I mean this from the bottom of my (growing) gut ... not from my heart though--it's pretty bad."
"I can't even drink this shit anymore. Seriously, it's like you're unamerican if you don't have Bud Light at your party for all the people who have horrible taste in beer. I wish I could say this shit was tasteless cause then at least you wouldn't taste the rank ass they obviously use to brew it with. What's funny is I think regular Bud isn't that bad, but this stuff makes me feel like I'm not even drinking real beer. It leaves a hollow void in my mouth and in my soul."
"D: Well, its pretty darn easy to drink. Especially because it isn't filling, and the taste just makes you want completely bypass your tongue."
"For all those carb-conscious weight-watchers who enjoy lite beers, bud lite is a good choice for those not wishing to consume too many calories and also desire something of a taste... Although not a particularly big fan of anything the Budweiser company has to offer, this is a decent lite beer selection from the many out there on the market... before I started really appreciating beer I'd cop a 24 ounce can for $.99 any time I wanted a cheap buzz... The appearance and smell are similar to many macros out there, but the taste is a notch-up (although nothing at all to write home about)... I am basing this review in respect to its particular category of a lite beer and not compared to beers overall... There are much better lite beers on the market, but this does the job well and is pretty inexpensive... Wouldn't go out and buy a sixer, but would drink it if it was offered... Not bad for a lite beer..."
"Drinkability: Easy to down. If you intend to drink one, you can end up drinking three pretty fast. Another good after-work, parking lot brew."
"That says a lot about the American consumer, I'm afraid."
"Pours golden yellow with a watery taste. The benefit is that it's cheap and you can drink many of them, comes in handy in a social setting."
"Certainly a thousand other beers out there that are better, but still this isn't all that offensive. What IS offensive is that this beer alone probably sells a thousand times more than those other thousand better beers put together. Oh well, you can lead a horse to water, or in this case beer ..."
"Final Note: I visited my nephew's new bachelor pad and this was all he had, I asked him for a glass and he gave me a plastic 'keg cup'."
"Bud light, bood light, bud light, bood light. Pours out a clear straw color with a soapy white head that dies instantly. Smells of corn and water. Taste is corny malts, a little earthy and not much beyond that. Basically water in the mouth with big carbonation. The 5 of us drank 75 of these while watching Beerfest 3 times in a row while playing beerpong. Capped off the night by pouring all cups made in our glass boot and loser chugs. We were living our yesteryears and it was great. This beer is perfect for such events."
"I felt I should try and review a beer that I used to drink (but don't anymore) and give it an honest review. It's difficult to believe this liquid I'm drinking is actually beer, but alas the label proclaims it as such. I was trying to keep this beer's style in mind when reviewing (light lager) but it doesn't compare to almost any other light lagers I've ever tried. This is painful to drink, though I can see how an inexperienced palate may consider this refreshing and benign enough to enjoy as a session beer."
"I was given a can of Bud Light at a Thanksgiving party. I did not want to be rude so I accepted it. The beer smells of corn. There is a sickly sweet taste, highly carbonated, with only a hint of bitterness from the hops. Mouthfeel is very thin. Drinkable due to how light it is, but not very enjoyable. I personally do not like the taste of this beer (or just about any light lager for that matter)."
"The worst beer I've ever had. I am only rating this for guys who might be in my position - you're at a sports bar or something, so you know the only thing foreign on the menu is french fries (or are they still freedom fries?) and that the darkest beer in the place is a Guiness. You just want a beer or two, something light so you're not bloated the next day and you see this on tap. Don't! I think if Crayola combined yellow and clear they'd come up with this color. As for the smell, none except grains and rice. As for the taste, all they did was water down a Bud. Seriously, just take a Budweiser and mix it w/ water. Now, I know it seems pointless, even juvenile to write such a negative review rather than just grade the beer on its own merits, but this review should be a warning - do not bother with this at all. Just get a Miller Lite or Mich Ultra instead if you're in the same situation I was."
"I would definately keep this in stock in my fridge. But solely to get the girls I invite over drunk off of beer pong."
"It's basically like drinking straw flavored carbonated water, if anyone would ever do that. Why is it so carbonated? Where are the hops? Why did I do this? Not the worst beer I've had in my life, but the worst I've had this month."
"Typical macro-brewery light beer. Not much flavor and not much to talk about. I guess it serves it's purpose."
"I know I'm not supposed to slam a beer, but I have to say one thing. I drank hard liquor for years, because my friends and family always had Bud Light or some other Light Macro, these were the beers that I was first introduced to. Because of this, I did not really like beer until my mid twenties, when I was first introduced to Sam Adams(A macro that USA can be proud of). Then I realized that there were other beers out there that tasted like real beer. I can't believe that I hear people always saying that they prefer Bud light, but can't drink Coors Light, or Miller Light etc.... This makes me laugh, because they all suck!!!"
"D- Drinkable beer with a minimal shelf life. Drink these with your boys while camping or fishing, but if you have a choice, stay away. Not good."
"well, i'm down to the last thing in my fridge, so here it is ; pours a transparent straw-yellow w/ a fluffy white head that lasts awhile, not much lacing ; a faint ""macro"" aroma, not much else ; very dry, almost non-exsistant ricey taste, i almost feel an IBU in there too, but I'm not sure ; a negative mouthfeel, I think it's wetter than water & lighter than air ( after drinking some REAL beer anyhow ) ; well, i'm on my third so it is drinkable as hell ( though i do type slow )..."
"This is not a beer man's beer. But, like I said, if you like light, smooth, flavorless American lagers, this is your beer."
"Overall, this beer is what it is. It's an ultra light brew that goes easy on the body and flavor so as the make it easy to drink. As far as I can tell, it is well fit to the style that, let's face it, has somewhat low expectations. It seems that this beer tries so hard not to offend, that it misses out on some important attributes such as fullness of flavor or a noticeable hop presence. Admittedly, not one of my favorite styles, but for me there is just not enough here to keep me coming back. One and done."
"I try to pass on this beverage except for when I'm stranded on an island and this is all the natives have to survive, even then it is difficult to consume."
"Had about 8 of these on Saturday night. The beer pours a straw yellow with a small white head that is quickly gone. The taste is nothing special but it is smooth and goes down easy enough. Drinkability is obviously high because you can pound 8-12 no problem. This obviously isn't the best beer in the world (I didn't give it the greatest of marks either) but seeing it rated so poorly kind of made me sad. I first cut my drinking tooth on this stuff and it'll always have a place in my fridge."
"This beer pours a bright yellow color that really looks watered down with a short white head. The aroma is of mild hops and malt, but only faintly. The taste is not much different but it is carbonated accordingly. The high carbonation and low taste makes it go down nicely which is why its drinkability is so high. This beer could be used with the intention of getting drunk, except that it is more expensive than other beers that will do the same. If there were a value column, this beer would get a 1.0 or lower if that were possible. The taste is not worth the price."
"You may also find this same review in my profile one day if I ever decide to paste it into another great accomplishment of human brewing history...such as coors light, PBR, Natty, Beast and done even get me started on the High Life. If you go out of your way to go to the store...wait on line...spend your hard-earned money...and slowly kill your liver...you mind as well make all of that worth your while."
"Drinkability- Alright for parties and football games if one of your friends bought it."
"What can you say about this beer? It has an extremely pale golden color. It certainly has a sweet smell. The taste is bland with a corn/grain flavor that is not appetizing, especially if it warms up past super cold. Bud Light's best quality is its mouthfeel, being as it is refreshingly crisp from a high carbonation. For me personally, the drinkablity suffers severely due to the flavors. The only way this beer makes sense is to get drunk, but honestly, you could achieve that much more efficiently, both monetarily and expeditiously, with liquor or a stronger, cheaper macro."
"I would never buy any quantity of Bud Light for my own consumption. If it were a party, where I knew we were playing beer pong, or funneling, or even playing drinking games, I might consider it. For the money though, it's not even that great a deal, considering the Anheuser-Busch markup. Go for the Natty Light or Keystone, save some street cred."
"Goes to show you what a brilliant marketing campaign and a deep advertising budget can do for a beer. If you make it tasteless enough it will only offend people searching for taste. Pours pale yellow with little head that leaves quickly. Almost no aroma nor taste. Lacing is minimal. Overly carbonated. Drinkability is high, because of the inoffensiveness."
"The mouthfeel is alright, but not stellar, which is surprising given its excellent drinkability. I'll have to experiment some more to examine the relationship between mouthfeel and drinkability."
"Enjoyed last night at a BJCP class tasting. Although the samples were quite small, the analysis and dialogue of the beer was quite thorough. The beer opens with a fizzy pour, quaint head formation, and terse retention. Highly carbonated, even evident to the eye. Aroams are very faint, and pick up on a mostly cereal grain / light pilsner malt character, and a hint of green apples and sulfer. Tastes more grain-flavored and adjunct sweetened than malty. Hops may add a touch of balance, but do little to impart any decernable flavors or aromas to the beer. Basically void of meaninful taste. Texture is quite flat from the lack of malts, but abrasive because of the carbonation (carbonic bite). Finishes clean (but so does water), and with a shap snappy finish. Difficult to praise, or to criticize -- there's just not much there."
"Had the consistency of water with carbonation and was just as easy to swallow. Really, the only reason I can see for drinking this is to get as drunk as possible as cheaply as possible. Fortunately, that's not my bag, so there's no reason to go out of my way to have this again."
"Comment: If the choice is a glass of water or a pint of Bud Light and you are desperate for something to cool your spice burned taste buds...Bud light is as good an alternative as any and better than some."
"Another one of those highly consumable beers that you just piss out,very easy to drink...nothing much there at all...but drinkable i guess if your not into flavorsome brews."
"Upon drinking ""real"" Bud Light, I am further disillusioned with the beer drinkers of America. THIS is your call to arms? THIS is what you answer to? Go back to vodka. It's more efficient."
"D- Very high. I could probably finish off a 30 pack of this...and not feel a thing."
"D: Not a bad beer for a light lager, definitely better than Miller Lite, but not something I would buy regularly, for my light beers I enjoy a nice German-style Helles or Pilsner."
"Drinkability - if my goal is to sit down and enjoy a beer, this would be near the bottom of the list. But, if Im out and about and just looking to party all night long, this beer would suffice but I would rather decide on another."
"4 Points in mouthfeel... water also goes down nicely"
"Would not bother me if I never drank this again"
"All in all, when it comes to the flavor department, Bud Light is severely lacking. What is so impressive about Bud Light, however, is the beer craftsmanship of Anheuser-Busch. In the world of brewing, a finely-tuned light lager is the most difficult product to create. Errors or flavor imperfections are readily evident, with nothing to mask the flavor. Then consider the flavor consistency for the millions of barrels of Bud Light, and you have one of the best-made beers in the world."
"Final Statement: This is definately worse than Coors Light. Smells terrible, no flavour, just plain bad. Not recommended for any purpose."
"We all know this beer. By reviewing standards, it offers very little and is about as dull as you can get. But for people looking for a cheap, but drinkable beer, it serves that purpose. Still, when a beer calls itself ""the King of All Beers", it should live up to that. This is closer to the village idiot than the king."
"I drink this crap to sober up."
"The beer pours a pale yellow with lage bubbles and no head. The aroma is better than the flavor. I actually smell some malt. The flavor is quite subtle with water and CO2 bubbles dominating. Very light on the pallette. What more is there to say to reach the 250 character minimum."
"Drinkability: Yes you CAN pound this out....but you'll feel sick the next day and be kicking yourself for it. When we are young and foolish this drink is great....when you begin trying new drinks you realize how crappy this really is."
"DO NOT WANT!"
"This beer pours a straw colored.... Wait a minute, pour Bud Light from a can? Hah, I drank this on the golf course quickly as possible since it was so hot yesterday. It appears to be yellow food colored water. Smell is almost non existent. In the taste I sense corn, a little hops and mostly water. Mouthfeel is a little bit more forgivable as it is a crisp carbonated refreshing drink on a summer day outside."
"Overall: Seriously, why bother? I'm not just being mean. If your just trying to get hammered, drink a few shots or something. Maybe drink one of those flavored malt beverages, at least it has some flavor."
"That's it for the big 3 (thank God) - I swear without the bottles, I'd never be able to tell them apart. That said, I've had worse."
"D- I caught this beer on sale and thought I would give it a shot. I bought it and I will drink it, but I wouldnt recommend this beer. If I wanted a cheap beer and caught it on sale, I still would have second thoughts about buying it."
"I have to admit I went along time thinking this was a prime lager example. Now that I finally have learned about real beer this stuff is horrible."
"D- despite its lack of flavor and character, this beer is near ultimate drinkability on a hot day IF you like drinking half beer half water. the best choice if you're having a party and providing the beer."
"Pours a very pale yellow color with no head, retention, or lacing (poured from a bottle into a mug). Has a very light aroma to it, smells like malted corn and rice. Corn and rice also the main part of the taste, with little hops character. Very light and thin mouthfeel, with a lot of carbonation. Overall, not a very good beer, too light, little taste (even considering the style). There are much better beers, as I'm sure most people realize since they've probably had this beer."
"And I give credit to the people at Anheuser-Busch. They aim to make a product for people who don't like beer and indeed, they've succeeded. Light beer was introduced in the 1970's as a marketing attempt at expanding their demographic to women and health-conscientious people. To appeal to a wider market they needed to make a wider appealing product and did so by introducing a product with less flavour, less aroma, less alcohol...who doesn't drink water? This is something else..."
"D- Yuck. Made to be drunk as fast as possible and puked up later. Absolutely awful."
"Drinkable - If nothing else, it is drinkable. However, with such a weak taste, there is little reason to want to drink it."
"Pours a clear, bland yellow color with a nice head. Aroma is of light corn (or rice...whichever it is) and seems sweet. Taste is very sweet as well and again, cornish or rice taste, which is unimpressive. Overall, beer is inoffensive but I didn't see much that could differentiate it from other light lagers. Boring."
"This is a great beer for beer pong since it is cheap and much easier to chug than some of the other macro lackluster beers."
"Nothing good to say so I will keep it short and sweet. This is your typical macro. No head no lace. Extremely bland on the nose and the tongue. I would only drink if there was no other option, thankfully there are lots of options. I don't even know why I bothered pouring in a glass should have used a funnel. ( I wrote this down in a notebook 3 years ago I was only 18 I am not full of myself but there ain't to many 18 year olds who would have preferred a Trappist beer over this)"
"Finish has the faintest hint of hops. Over Carbonated. This is the definition of a tasteless watered down macro...there's almost nothing to describe....suffers as it warms. Aren't most beers supposed to do the opposite....why anyone would pay 35% more for this over MHL I HAVE NO earthly idea."
"D- Cheap macro light beer. Not surprisingly lacking in any good qualities. But at least it goes down easily as it is basically water."
"Drinkability- Not much taste. I felt like I was drinking water. At least it was free or else I'd feel like I really wasted my money."
"Drinkability: Could drink this all day, but there are much better choices."
""
"One thing I will say in favor of this beer is that you can drink it if nothing else is available. It's not a beer I absolutely can't stand to drink, it's just not something I'd choose to drink."
"For me, I pick the Bud Light because nothing does the trick on a hot day like an ice cold Bud Light."
"D-i guess people drink Heineken because at least skunk tastes like something. This doesn't taste like beer. Maybe watered down beer. Once again I am bored at the airport. My assumption as to why people drink this? People don't like the taste of malt or hops."
"D: I only give this beer a 1.5 because I imagine the tap line was a bit old and imparted a hex on the beer that made it worse than it should have been, still a terrible experience here."
"Overall a rather flavorless experience. No really offensive flavors or aromas, just nothing really worth drinking."
"This is almost a ""no beer", got a very pale yellow look with a small head, this beer got almost no taste, more water than beer taste,you can almost fill that there's ice cubes in the beer,very easy to drink (but water is also very easy to drink),miller lite and bud light light are always fighting in there ads about taste and carbs , do someone really cares about the carbs when your beer taste like water,if you have to select your beer by the carbs on it , you should drink water."
"D- high only because it has no bad flavors, no flavors at all, to make it worse"
"Light straw colored pour with minimal head no matter how hard you pour. Smell is minimal of corn and malts but moreso of watered down lager. Taste is also pretty muted. Slight sweet malts and somewhat bitter at that. Mouthfeel is light, as one would expect. Drinkability...you could give it a high score but the other aspects bring it down. Sure, it's easy to drink cold but it's not extremely enjoyable."
"If you must drink a beer like this drink Bud Select since it is slightly better than Bud light and friends."
"Had a couple Bud Lights this afternoon at my buddy's place as this is all he had. (knew I shouldhave stopped at the store!) Anyway, Bud Light at 35 degrees F is not bad tasting, but only becuase it has no taste. What I thought about while I drank them, was the recipe. I thought ""This is what a beer would taste like if you took really cold carbonated water and then used an eye dropper and dropped in a few drops of beer flavoring and then stirred it up"". No lace, slight ""beer"" smell, and almost clear. Barely a beer."
"D: Everyone knows why this would be ""drinkable"" in a ""chuggable"" sense, so I won't belabor the point. Just not sure if I would have another. Nevertheless, I see for its designed purpose it could be considered drinkable, I'm just wondering who qualified their use of ""the finest ingredients"" it touts on the label. Also, where's the flavor? On a sidenote, I enjoyed this after a friend left one last can in my fridge, so there's no love/money lost."
"Nothing to say when the brewer has done nothing to make ""beer"". Lightly alcoholic carbonated water. You're not going to consume fewer calories by drinking this, either, since they're so easy to make disappear."
"Your typical American macrobrew light beer. Appearance is the expected straw-yellow. Aroma is weak and barely noticeable. Flavor is malty, weak and watery. Drinking this is more like drinking water than beer. I hope the next party I go to has some better beer selections; still, I had to try it."
"drinkability - King of beers? Haven't drank this is years, now I know why."
"Its a highschoolers/College wet dream."
"overall- out of the 3 big beer companies, i like miller lite and bud light about equally (over coors). this beer should only be bought for beer pong or any other college drinking game, as this beer is not one to enjoy."
"why anyone drinks this stuff, i don't know. i suppose it is appealing to young whippersnappers that don't want the taste of beer, women (not all, ok, this is an unfair generalization but makes this sentence work grammatically), and uber-americans who fly flags, george w stickers, and shotgun racks off the back of their pickup trucks. if anyone bothered to pour this they would see the lightest as possible color, a super-light straw color that is reminiscent of a leaf that has turned white. fizzy, quickly diminishing 'head' of large bubbles. it is almost impossible to discern any aroma in this beer, maybe some tinny/metallic notes and the almost imperceptible malt adjuncts. no hops to be detected whatsoever. no malt character. just very light and crisp from being over-carbonated. mouthfeel is akin to seltzer water. this is one of the reasons why that nowadays if there ain't good beer available (stuck at wrigley, for example), i just won't drink at all. finish? what finish? what would drive anyone to take another sip of this besides thirst or the desire to get drunk?"
"I guess it has a redeeming value in that served ice cold on a hot day, it isnt bad."
"Not a horrible beer, just lacking in about all facets. Poured a yellow just a shade darker than that of water. Smelled of corn adjuncts and not much else. Taste was indeed light. Again,cooked corn the primary component with extremely little malt backbone. Hops also in very short supply. Mouthfeel is watery. Drinkability- very drinkable if you don't mind a general lack of taste in your beer- this brew was certainly created for effortless mass-drinking. This beer is drinkable, not terrible...just really nothing there. Perhaps a tad better than Coors light. There are much better macro options out there."
"Piss colored with a sorry excuse for a head. Smells like any other American macro lager, not spectacular. Not very flavorful. Best suited for use in college drinking games, and maybe as something to drink for a buzz during a simple BBQ or as a palate cleanser."
"basically, i think we need to remember to keep and rate this beer in its context. of the light macros, i think it finds the best balance between cheap and actually tasting like something (if not much). it goes down easy, and i don't cringe when i drink it. thats what im looking for out of bud-light."
"note--is AB really the #1 recycler of aluminum cans? They have to be the #1 producer of littered cans as well : P"
"12 oz. bottle- color of pale dark yellow , with a medium white short lasting head - sweet nose of sweet corn , hay , straw , and melon  crisp taste of melon , straw , mild bitterness , and xxx - body is crisp , dry , and medium to high carbonation  aftertaste of sweet yellow corn , and melon it is so unfortunate that this is one of the worlds best selling beers"
"I was served this at near freezing temperatures in a frosted mug, very cold and i must admit very refreshing"
"On tap at the Fairfield plant. Gotta admit it's quite refreshing, fresh, and downright good fresh from the brewery's pipes. Still has some things that I'd consider defects that define Budweiser's trademarks; it's got plenty of personality but not enough charm. Pleasant bitterness and light, refreshing body with a gentle tartness. Very very fresh, which definately helps alot. Overall seltzer water vibe, which shoots beer right up your nose like soda pop. Drinability would be better if it wasn't so tame...I enjoy lots of light lagers but this one is obviously trying to dumb it down. This beer does, however, have lots of confidence,a nd it's clear that the brewers are in complete control. Don't pass it up if you're at the brewery, simply because it's not too shabby when it's this fresh. Cheers!"
"Bad, Bad, BAD!!!"
"The queen of beers,LOL. Well seriously I have been trying all of these to see what really makes them such great sellers. The only thing I can come up with is that they are cheap, and when cold go down like water. I guess this is for those who are drinking to get drunk. Anyway onward with my thoughts. Pale golden water with a whith fizzy head comes out of the bottle and into the glass. Head fades leaving nothing but the golden water and lots of visible carbonation. Smell was really not tere at all, maybe some slight rice or bread but nothing worth really noting on. The taste was even lighter then its original namesake, which is to be expected. Very light grain and rice flavors, malty with nothing else to add any complexity to it. This truly tastes like I am drinking water. Highly carbonated and served ice cold, I guess it could make a substitution for soda, but its just not something to drink to enjoy. It truly was light on everything."
"Overall: Served cold and drunk fast, its not bad, but I wouldnt pursue it. Avoid."
"bud light. The typical beer-water. Very pale yellow in color with decent amount of head. Tastes like a very watered-down macro lager. The taste and mouthfeel aren't terrible-but nothing special. The beer-water qualities of this is what makes it so drinkable. It may not be the best tasting-but it goes down easy."
"If I drank it at home on a cold day I'd rate it 2 across the board."
"Reviewed from notes. Served at approx. 45 degrees. I poured this lager into a pint glass to reveal a very light bodied beer. Its color is very light golden and is easily seen through. A small bubbly head fizzed for a short while then disappeared quickly. The nose is faint but has suggestions of corn, paper, mineral water, and perhaps an aroma reminiscent of cloth. A mineral water-like flavor is mostly present upon sipping with hints of paper, steamed rice, creamed corn, and a sweet finish akin to aspartame. The mouthfeel was very thin and carbonated, the beer easily washed over my palate leaving minimal impressions. In my humble opinion, I believe I would enjoy this beer better if it had a little more body and flavor depth. Perhaps it could also benefit from less adjuncts, as the overall flavor seems to hint strongly at the use of them."
"This beer has a pretty strong smell and flavor for the genre, but it is not a flattering strength. A pale yellow with minimal head. The smell is of sour, almost rotten grain. The taste isn't nearly as sour and instead gives out a bit of bitterness and hops, but mostly the strong grain."
"Not any horrible tastes, but then again not many tastes at all. So nothing that would prevent me from drinking this given it was free and the only thing available. So I give it an average for drinkability."
"I really try not to just pan beers, but there is nothing positive I can say about this brew. Avoid it. If you need to drink something, get some water."
"This beer has it's place. I'm certain I will drink it again, though probably not in my own home by my own choice."
"It a shame that most Americans think this is actually beer."
"Pours a very light and perfectly clear yellow with a tiny and fizzy white head that dissipates instantly and leaves no lacing. Smell is very clean and extremely faint. A bit of grain and a whiff of sugary malts and it's gone. Taste is adjunct-y. Some cork, husks, and a hint of bitterness (dare I say that it might have been actual hops?). Fades quickly from the palate. Mouthfeel is very thin and overcarbonated, fizzy to the point of seeming like soda water or seltzer. Drinkability is decent I guess, but I didn't really have any desire to finish it, so I handed the glass off to a friend and moved on. About what I expected."
"Wow, I cant believe this is what I used to drink. And to think, this is what most people call ""beer"". That aside, this beer was poured form a 12oz. bottle, into a pint glass (so I could review the appearnace). The beer poured an almost clear, but slightly yellow color, eventually settling to a light yellow. Lots of carbonation, forming a 1 inch fluffy head, that quickly faded, leaving light lacing on the glass. The aroma is very weak, smelling of grain and corn. The flavor isnt much better. Mostly water and corn. Not too many characteristics to this type of beer. The mouthfeel is light, expected obviously. I dont know how I used to drink this all night, but I guess for many, this is their session beer. I guess to each his own. This just isnt the one for me."
"Drinkability: One could drink many of these if he did not desire flavor and complexity. I found it rather tasteless and boring."
"If it's offered, I'll drink it, but it's not something I would purchase for myself again."
"Poured into a mug. Pale, pale yellow in color with the thin head that is large at first but almost immediately goes away. Lots of carbonation climbing to the surface - basically, it looks like carbonated water with yellow food coloring. Smells medicinal almost - if anything, it is a clean nearly sterile smell. Taste is basically non-existent, like carbonated water with a little bit of corn and hops (maybe?). Mouthfeel is thin - very, very light. All of this said, I can see why people can drink this all night. It's basically water with a bit of what could be construed as beer flavoring. Recommendation to avoid."
"D- This beer really has no flavor except for a hint of hop bitterness. There are no malt qualities anywhere. It taste like hop flavored seltzer water."
"It simply doesn't go down smoothly at all, keeps you dreading the next can, and the next day makes you kick yourself for not getting regular Bud."
"d - goes down pretty smoothly but leaves an after-taste"
"Poured crystal clear with some hints of golden color, 3 finger head that dissipated fairly quick and left some light lace. Smell was that of either corn or rice chex cereal, take your pick. Taste was not much of anything, sweet not related to anything in particular. Watery mouthfeel. I can drink tons of this stuff depending on the situation. I grew up drinking similar type products so this is very drinkable for me even though I don't drink this swill much anymore. It is what it is, a great cooler beer for tailgating."
"Hey, what can I say, someone left it after a party, so I drank it. Not much to say about this one. The typical stale aroma, grainy taste and dry finish found in almost all the widely advertised BMCs. Hey, but at least Im sparing calories!!! Who cares...bring on the good stuff."
"D - This is the best selling beer in the U.S., and for a reason."
"THis beer is a good light beer but still a typical macro light beer. Light golden color with an ok head. Smells malty. Tastes a little malty but not really like much of anything. Watery, carbonated mouthfeel. Decent light beer, so it's ok if you're looking to drink a lot of it and don't want to get that ""full"" feeling."
"Drinkability is like carbonated water. Not my favorite."
"Mouthfeel is very thin, watery, but the tap serving is soft, crisp and fizzy. Perfect for what it is, I guess, but I'll pass."
"D: Overall the drinkability is not to great. The only exception to this is if its the only beer around, or your at a sporting event."
"Party beer for the kiddos."
"I'd prefer a cheaper light beer like Keystone Light or Old Style Light for drinking for buzz."
"It doesn't taste any better. Besides being watered-down and over-carbonated, there are flavors of corn, some kind of cheap grain, and maybe some bitter (albeit neutered) hops. It feels like a sour soda pop in your mouth and is drinkable in large doses only if it's accompanied by ping-pong balls and plastic cups. There's really no other reason to drink this beer if you have any interest at all in ""flavor"" or ""quality."""
"A pretty crappy lager, in my opinion. It just lacks too much in every department except drinkability, and its lacking in the other departments are what make it so strong in the aforementioned. Not impressed. It's worth a try if you haven't had it, but I definitely won't be having this beer again."
"Aroma was of cereal grains and slightly fruity, citrusy notes in the nose. Taste was similar to every other U.S. macro: fruity taste mixed with some corny/vegetable flavors and light malt character. Hop character non-existent. Mouthfeel was very light on the palate, just a step above water. Drinkability was terrible. The almost total lack of taste made this a drain pour after only half the can was gone. Not recommended."
"For a light beer, Bud Light isn't that bad, but not that great by any means. After drinking my homebrews and other thick, rich tasting beers, Bud Light tends to give me a water like taste. No matter what the beer comes in, the taste is about the same quality."
"Bud light gives me a splitting head ache. Not in the morning, but rather while I am drinking it, and that prevents me from drinking it that much. The smell and the mouthfeel are kind of offensive, but the appearance isn't that awful for a mass produced brew. Don't drink and review."
"Pours a very pale yellow with minimal head. The beer smells and tastes just like what it is made from-- inferior products. Mainly grains and weak flavoring of alcohol mixed with water The mouthfeel is very heavily carbonated. If a friend offers and this is what they have, I'll be polite and drink it... that's about it."
"Left in the fridge. Bud light pours a clear yellow witha fizzy head that quickly disappears. Smell is slighly grainy. Taste is about the same, no discernible hops at all. I have to give this beer credit, its completely non-offensive, the only thing to complain about is its lack of flavor."
"Notes - good refreshing beer not much flavor smell and not the best looking beer. but it quenches my thirst on hot south texas days the drinkability is awsome...not very hard at all to drink a six pack of this."
"BUD LIGHT. I prefer the A-B products over the ""headache in a bottle," Miller. Bud Light has been slammed and even I will admit it is a cheap beer, however, the quality far exceeds the price. In comparison to other beers in the same price catagory, Bud light, provides the best taste and drinkability. Bud Light is thinner than Traditional Budweiser and the mouthfeel is lacking also."
"That being said, this is my brothers most frequently purchased beer."
"Bud Light was very light yellow in color with a white fizzy head that disappeared very quickly. The taste and smell were nearly nonexistant. the finish is dry. The mouthfeel is very light with a medium-high level of carbonation. This is a very watery, nearly tastless, fizzy beverage; but I guess that's what it's designed to be. Avoid."
"Absoluetly discusting, I don't know how you can drink this panther piss."
"After drinking so many top notch brew, bud light/budweiser needs to get a clue. I know they sell to the mass but what a tasteless brew. No dominate scent, very light in appearence, and alot of carbonation which leaves me full. I'll stick to water next time Bud Light is being served."
"Get my buzz on- n"
"I recently reviewed this beer with a rambling tirade and Todd called me on it. It was too soon after being forced to drink it. I have composed myself since. I hadn't had the displeasure of sampling this junk for many years, but was relegated to during a football tailgate this past weekend. Never again. A: very pale urine/straw colored with low carbonation and no head. S: Watery yeasty Corn T: What taste? it is an attempt at beer flavored water M: Thin but no worse than any other macro light lager D: I, unlike an alarming number of beer drinking Americans, find this stuff undrinkable. You get nothing from this that you drink beer for. Taste not withstanding, a fermented beverage that is derived from malted barley and hops need only yield .5% alcohol to be technically classified as beer. Bud light can't have much more than that and even less taste. It's sad when something makes Coors or Miller Lite seem flavorful, relatively speaking. Thanks Todd from the kinder, gentler Veech."
" Heartless, gutless taste, with just the husk of flavor in a watery mess. Mouthfeel is AWOL. Boy, this is just as bad as I remember. Tell me again why this beer is the most popular by volume in the entirety of the states?..."
"Eric"
"This isn't the worst light beer available in this area, but it's far from the best."
"Given a choice of mass produced light lagers, this would probably be at the bottom of my list. I can think of at least two or three brewed by major companies (including Anheuser-Busch) that are more enjoyable. It's somewhat embarrassing this is the #1 selling beer in America. I hope the European's don't take notice of this fact."
"Drinkability is actually good, I say this because for its style, even though it is not complex in the slightest and it is very watery, there is no skunk or cheap malt taste"
"Pours a sickeningly bright but translucent hue of yellow, almost like some champagne. Head seemed good at first but lost its mojo pretty fast. Smells like a kegger. Actually, its not an entirely unpleasing smell in small doses. But it certainly doesnt smell like a hearty, delicious brew. Tastes like stale bread. After first taste the nose becomes almost un-detectable. Citrus quality is observed. Aftertaste is most unpleasant. Also, its a very watery brew. Not sure if this is a legitimately observed taste or not, but a flavor of bile was definitely noted in the back of the throat. It made me scrunch up my face with the first taste. Perhaps Im just recalling youthful nights of overindulgence. Dont drink beers like this."
"I had this in the new Aluminum Bottle that seems to be the new selling point for AB. On a hot day at the Byron Nelson PGA tournament, this hit the spot. Stayed cold. That thick shell showed its purpose. I felt real guilty about throwing this out because it is such a waste. Make sure you recycle these bottles."
"Far from being a great product, Bud Light is a versatile beer that most anyone will find acceptable. I generally dont go for light beers but among the macro lights, Bud Light ranks as one of my favorites. It is also one of the few light beers that I like better than the regular beer."
"It is what you come to expect from a BMC product. Average across the board. The appearance was a very light yellow. There was no smell present. The drink ability is the only positive thing about this beer because it seems very easy to down a couple. Overall I would not buy this again. The only time I might accept this is if it's free."
"Drinkability- You can put these back about as fast as you can put back a little bottle of soda water. Thats pretty much what it is anyway."
"¡Salud!"
"It has hardly any taste, and the taste it does have reminds me of water. Water from Boston Harbor.. It has a boring yellow color. It's a decent beer if you're with friends who aren't beer drinkers, and just want to get tipsy. Otherwise, I'd never order this at a bar, or buy a 6 pack."
"Drinkability: As bad as it gets. Drinking one is very, very trying."
"The beer pours a golden color with a light head. The beer smells pungent and almost fruit like. The taste is sweet and it hits you in the back of the mouth. It has a crisp feel with little aftertaste. Over all the drinkability is fine but this beer doesnt offer much."
"The smell and appearance are still the same as if I was drinking out of a 40 oz, but the taste actually had some nice hop character to it and the mouthfeel and drinkability are better. The mouthfeel is thicker and the taste lacks the original sourness which made it easy to pound down two pitchers before getting cut off by my aunt."
" Bottom Line: Just another shitty American Macro light Lager. King of beers? I think they should be sued for saying that. Just my opinion. Ta Ta"
"This beer has a yellow bubbling tint to it that leaves no head whatsoever. Smell is of, I can't really decide I think it smells like water flavored corn. Taste is almost nonexistent. I couldn't even finish the whole thing without dumping it down the drain, avoid this at all costs."
"Cheers!"
"This is as drinkable as tap water. It's not as offensive as some other light beers I've tried, but it lacks any real beer flavor or character. This is another failed attempt at making a light beer that tastes like beer. I've had low-alcohol beer that tastes more like beer."
"Yeah, it isn't bad, just terribly boring. If I wanted the same sort of experience, but good, I'd hit up a Helles. I can see where they were going with this beer, but, man, just not that well executed."
"The Number One beer in America? So good that - according to the TV ads - people will arange thier lives around it? Hardly. You'll do better with a Busch Light, from the same folks in St. Louis, MO."
"Overall a beer i dont know why i am reviewing (must be drunk). In all honesty, its not a horrible thing to drink, just a horrible beer. To save money, i say buy bud dry if you want A-B, or just get something cheaper. this shit aint worth it"
"D: Not sure if this wasn't a good keg or not, but if the rest is like this, it is purely undrinkable. How can this be so different than the bottle?"
"Reminds me of high school...drinking whatever alcohol we could get our hands on. Oh..many years went by when we drank this type of beer (Busch or Bud Light) just in order to get inebriated enough to make some bad decisions... Kinda depressing that legal adults still drink the same piss-water just to get drunk.. Clear pale yellow, grainy aroma and not much else. Nearly nothing for complexity, and the mouthfeel is so ridiculously light..I'm convinced that this beer is engineered for frat houses and nothing more."
"12 oz. can. It is clear yellow color that is highly carbonated. It smells of alcohol and faintly of corn. The taste is very watery. Maybe there is some malt flavor mixed in there too. Mouthfeel is very fizzy. It's only drinkable because it is so light."
"An awful light beer, can't see how people drink these. Going to have to say - ""Avoid, at all costs""."
"It seems every time I go to a party this beer is in the hands of most of the party goers. I usually bring my own beer to parties for that very reason. I still end up having one though and each time it reminds me how much I dislike this beer. The appearance is pretty bad just a bland watery pilsner. The smell isnt better, still awful. This beer has almost no taste. To me the only taste I notice is something like half beer and half water. A very poor beer, also a great indicator of bad taste."
"Poured into a clear plastic fest mug, about all it deserves, formed a 2"" bright white head over the light yellow liquid. Head actually lasts reasonably well, with minimal lacing. Aroma is totally MIA, maybe the slightest whiff of pale and/or adjunct sweetness. Taste is the same sweetness that was almost found in the nose, which carries throughout. Mouthfeel is not detrimental, just totally non-descript, so hard to subtract points there. Relatively drinkable, if you're into this sort of thing. I guess I've become more of a BMC soft touch than I was when I reviewed it in the can. Oh well."
"A pox on this beer, it's utter drek."
"drinkability = gross! not only does this beer lack taste and body (even for a light beer), but it's chock full of impurities and preservatives that give me a massive headache."
"asprin takes away headaches. bud light gives them. i can taste the marketting more than the hops, if there are any. at $15 for a 30 pack it's no wonder why it shows up at every poker party, bbq, wedding, etc. my brother loves it. he also puts his steaks on the grill straight from the freezer."
"This is a drinkers beer so drink up Johnny. MK"
"D: Easy to drink. I would prefer to drink other things, but I could easily drink several of these."
"Only thing in my girlfriends fridge. Pours a pale straw color with one inch head that dissapates to a film. Smell has sweet malt with no hops. Taste is sweet, not really malty and no hops. Very thin in the mouth. Can drink if its cold enough, but overall not a favorite."
"Drinks okay, all things considered. I consider this the best of the worst as far as macroswill goes. Still does the job after cutting the lawn"
"D- Like I said above, I drank this by mistake when someone handed me a refill. Since it was bought for me, I did the polite thing and finish it. I wish I left it on a table and walked away. Later in the day I had awful stomach cramps, which I am totally blaming on this pathetic excuse of a beer."
"It is true that I began to drink this beer with low expectations. But this beer genuinely fell even short of what I'd expected. I'll switch to MD 20/20 before I stock this stuff in my house."
"Expanding upon my review of the bottled version: On-tap it is still (and perhaps more if that is possible) watered down than the bottle version. There is less carbonation than the bottled version but still the same watered down beer. If it is the only beer available than go for it, but typically there will be something more appealing."
"Great for Fraternity parties worldwide."
"It was left in my fridge, so why not put a couple words down about it? A little yellow food coliring was added to carbonated water, there you have the body. Maybe my cold hasn't gone away, I can't smell anything. Taste is not much. Very slight grain, NO HOPS, yeast possibly? Mouthfeel is an afterthought. A farce of a beer."
"Very watery with very little malt or hop presence. A very dull mouthfeel. Wouldn't want to drink this unless I was stuck at a house or on a island and it was the only beer there."
"Bud light a beer of choice when u are at a college party for its drinkablity but to sit around and enjoy, blah. Very light in color, the smell non existant, bud light is a very boring beer. As it goes down your throat the taste reminds me of water. Thats right its like drinking water. A plus one this beer is that it is cheap and very drinkable. It goes down like nothing. But if it was to me I'd take the money I spent one a six pack of this stuff and buy me a single of some real beer."
"Taste isnt too bad since its lacking a bit extra, but I mean do not go to crazy with it for it will come back and give a massive hang-over if you under-estar/mate the taste. So yeah dat drinkability you got is a killer for this one."
"I told the guy at the counter that he had a damn good spot to sell beer if he ever decided to. This was after he refused to sell me a cold beer."
"So if I'm looking for a beer with light body, low abv, and lots of corn flavor, and I can drink gallons without feeling full or drunk, it turns out Budwieser is damn near perfect! Factor in that its price is condusive to feeding the five thousand and you have a winner on your hands. Don't fight it. Besides, wrapping your gut-goobered, orange-stained fingers around a tulip glass to quaff your IPA really just wouldn't be right."
"Dnot one for menot enough flavor. This is one to drink if you are looking to get drunk. No flavor and it goes down like water."
"I thought I should give this crud a try, just to see what all the commercial hype is about. My first mistake was pouring the beer into a glass instead of just chugging from the can. It made a lot of nice frothy head, and I'm giving it points on that only. The downside is that all the carbonation had gone after that since there's no body to keep it in, leaving me not just with bad beer but flat bad beer as well. I can't even say it had a taste; it was kind of like sour water. There was no hop flavor, malt flavor, or even yeast flavor. All in all, one more reason to be wary of American pop culture."
"bad news. can't argue with free beer sometimes though..."
"Overall: I'd say this is a very typical representation of a light lager, unfortunately."
"D- of course this is a drinkable beer, its like drinking tap water."
"Not very drinkable, it doesn't have flavor, body, or drinkability. I pray to God I never drink this again."
"On that note, Bud Light is almost beer-flavored water. Bud Light is something to drink when you're afraid you're putting on too many pounds, or want to be polite and accept a beer from a friend. If you have to buy Bud Light, the least you can do is buy it in bottles...I think drinking this stuff from the can will just make it that much more apparent how worthless this stuff is."
"That being said, it doesn't taste bad and I can drink it if my friends offer it to me. I just don't think it tastes like a beer."
"I'm a lightweight, but I drank an awful lot of these and never felt too drunk. At 4.2%, this is kind of a waste of my time."
"Drinkability: This is a beer to avoid at all costs. I'm looking at the rest of the pint and dreading finishing it."
"Not a great beer, but alright for a warm Sunday."
"Pass it up. There are plenty of better light beers on the market if you have to go there."
"So much for my take on the matter, however; light beer drinkers are quite simply looking for different things from their beer than I am with my three criteria; if Bud Light delivers on their requirements, good show for them, say I. I used to use beer as yet another means to look down on others, but thankfully those days are long gone. Light beer drinkers could care less about the opinions of beer snobs, much less ex-beer snobs, and there's no reason for that to change."
"sadly ive probably drinken more of this than any other beer. it looks like piss, smells like piss, and tastes like piss, but after 2-3 cans it becomes more drinkable. even after 8+ cans you will still be aware that it tastes like crap, but tat that point you just dont care anymore. the only redeeming factor is that its cheap. but it tastes cheap too. i cant believe i used to drink these kind of beers, this is what gives beer a bad name. never again."
"Drinkability: This is as drinkable as any light beer - goes down easy if you just want a thirst-quencher, but if you want something that you can really enjoy, look elsewhere."
"This tastes like nothing, which makes it very drinkable -- nothing to get in the way of pouring it straight down the gullet. Consumed as a BA would consume it, the beer gets very astringent and unpleasant as it warms, so drink it while it's cold. It's not my cup of tea, but there's a reason why it's the most popular beer on Earth, and I'll take it before a lot of craft beers in a heartbeat."
"Notes: I'd pass on this."
"Drinking budweiser is one thing , but bud light? Why? Well it was the only beer in my fridge ( left by someone) . Poured a watery , crystal clear and oh so pale yellow. Large head as a result of me takening out my aggression , (caused by no better beer) by pouring as fast and hard as possible! Smell is lightest of malt and adjunct. Taste is same , not much of anything to describe. Mouthfeel like water with a shot of beer in it. It is very drinkable... out of a funnel."
"Very weak beer. Appearance is very light yellow/golden. Smell is inconsequential -- nothing really too it. A little grainy and bitter -- just like the taste. It's smooth going down -- cos there's nothing to it! So, you could drink a lot of these w/o really enjoying it and taking a long time to get any type of buzz going. Less filling than Bud, but has less taste...and that's not saying much."
"Pours a pale yellow with a medium-sized, foamy, white quickly diminishing head. Very little lacing. The smell is of weak grainy malts and thats about it. The taste is very light, clean and lacking in character as I expected from domestic light. Nothing really offensive, but nothing good either. More weak grain and hardly any detectable hops. It has a thin body, weird semi-slick texture, and lively carbonation. I guess it actually wasnt that horrible surprisingly. Its a small step up from Coors Lights (not like that means much of anything), but I still was left with thinking why bother? after I was finished."
"Overall, this was worse than expected. It is drinkable, if you want to be able to drink a couple six packs in a night. Not sure why you would want to do that when so many other options available [though you can't drink as many]. I could possibly see drinking this on a very, very hot day when this beer was served ice cold....that's about all."
"Poured a pale straw color with a foamy head that leaves some lacing around the glass. Smell is clean but like most macro lagers has a slight smell of creamed corn, just really bland. Taste is much of the same, no pronounced flavor, nothing that I could get enjoyment out of, I would like to see some hops come through, just a little at least. Mouthfeel, overly carbonated and intended to serve ice cold, perhaps to hide flavors, good or bad, within? Drinkability, I could imagine this is drinkable for many, but I could maybe have one in a sitting, and then not have anymore again, ever."
"Ordered a bud light on tap, it was served in a plastic disposable cup (well, proper glassware does improve the beer experience, and what could be more appropriate?), it appeared pale macro lager yellow with a minimal head. It went down smooth, like a nice glass of carbonated water, with just the slightest kiss of hops to remind you this is supposed to be beer. This is beer to guzzle, it is either lawnmower beer of the highest order, or it is the lowest common denominator that serves to keep beer as low brow as possible in America. Is the keg half full or is it half empty? That is for you to decide."
"Drinkability - Out of all of the macro lagers, perhaps in the 2nd tier of beers. Would still avoid if possible--think about it, do YOU ever add water to your favorite cheap beer?"
"...I'm still waiting - after my fifth or sixth sip I finally realized that there is no taste. Simply amazing. Body is nonexistant. This is the second worst beer I've reviewed to date."
"Drinkabilty, If you don't mind the taste, lack of aroma, and general un-beeriness you might could have finished the whole 40. I couldn't."
"Drinkability- I'd imagine after about 5 or 6 of these things they get pretty drinkable. Hope I never get to that point."
"The beer pours a pale yellow with a thick white head that dissipates quickly and does not lace. It just smells of nasty corn. There is very little taste that is dominated by corn and rice. The mouthfeel has some overpowering artificial carbonation and is watery. Overall it is tough to drink. The adjunct flavors just take over making me heave to try to drink it quickly. However it is light enough, to not be as offensive as it could be if these flavors were stronger."
"It wasn't till later that they admitted that is was bud light, Nice try guys."
"Notes  This is the first in a series of reviews as I clear out my college fridge. I have quite a little macro collection from party left overs."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable because it is just like water."
"i can drink it, and i've drank large amounts of it when in the company of friends, but it's nothing i'd ever go to because i enjoy any of it's qualities"
"Pours a lovely urine color with only the slightest hint of a head. Smells like stale yeast, much like a beer glass that has been left on the counter over night. That, and corn chips. Tastes like carbonated red licorice and corn. Delicious! Mouth feel is thin with a lot of carbonation. I must say, this is a few steps closer to drinkable when it's on tap."
"Indy :o)"
"Avoid at all costs."
"A yellow straw color with a small head,it did have alot of carbonation.This smells alittle fruity,but not much else.This tastes like water that is beer flavored.It's light and watery,but as far as a macro light goes it stands up to the other swill.The m/f is light and watery.I don't think I would ever try this again,but it's still better than other big macro lights."
"-Cheers2Beers"
"The only reason that I give this beer a 3.5 on drinkablity is because the price is right. You can hardly argue this. But never forget, you get what you pay for. I have a soft spot for AB, this was the first beer that I would call my own. Every now and then, after a long hard day of work, I still like to sit down with a cold tall Bud light."
"But don't get me wrong. If I'm out playing wiffleball or at Fenway and my buddy comes back with a cup of Bud Light. I'll drink it. There are times when it is okay. There are just way too few when it is right."
"A little good about its sister; its espectacular aluminum bottle, are beatiful, really can help to keep cold the beer until the last drop; its bottle is one of the most advanced innovations in the beer market, i try alone withouth food, its pint size is perfect for take two or three bottles no more; drink direct from the bottle. 75% recommended."
"With this, we are getting into the awfull beers domains, this is a little hard to stand and maybe with sdome other beers before, you can relax and just drink it, but as it can be described, it can be found. I would preffer to have a regular beer than the light version of this brewery."
"Overall, I would never buy this again if it weren't for having group get-togethers where my buddies drink a ton of this crap."
"The pour is something of a gold-tinged clear color with a frothy white head that leaves a thin lace. You can work backwards from better beer or forward from awful beer when reviewing this one. There isn't much of a nose but it's not filled with corn like some other macros. It's not overly fizzy, but the mouthfeel is very thin and watery. There's not a lot of anything here as far as the taste is concerned. It tastes like club soda with, possibly, the least amount of hops and malt you can put into a beverage and still have the chutzpah to call it beer. There's no offensive flavors in here so it's not a chore to drink, but I'm not anxious to have another one of these ever again."
"I got this on-tap for only .90 a 12oz at a local bar. Someone got this for me and it's a good thing because this stuff was bad. It poured a very pale yellow color with an inch of foam that dissipated very fast. No smell what so ever and if there was anything, I'm sure as hell didn't smell it. The taste and mouthfeel were both bland and watery. It's sad that a bottle of water has more taste than this beer on-tap. Since this beer is cheap, affordable, low in alcohol, and everywhere, you drink alot of this stuff. But I can't see why anybody would do that."
"Bottle obtained from the discount bin of Liquor Mart (Boulder) and consumed about a week later. Born on 15 Aug05 D802. Very very pale dull yellow liquid (although it's crystal clear). Pours a two finger fizzy 'soda pop' head that quickly settles to nothing. Smells mildly malty...like honey sweet. Plus a darker aroma that comes across as sort of cardboard and mushroom, but which I'm beginning to recognize as Spalt hops. Tastes very watery. Mildly malt sweet and with a dark hop character. Hop is extremely mild and is *way* below the sting from the carbonation. In fact, I would say the carbonation contributes more to the flavor than anything else. The first sip was decent, as I could really 'get' the malt and hops, but all subsequent tastes were lacking. I'm not sure if my DFH pint glass will ever recover. I was foolish to use it for this Bud Light. The mouthfeel is extremely thin, like water. The beer actually improved a bit when I swirled to release some of the carbonation. The hop flavor became more prevalent and the taste of iron made an appearance. Drinkability...low when I'm in beer geek mode, but could be high under certain circumstances."
"A bit better than Miller Lite and lots beter than Coors Light in my opinion. Seems very similar to Busch Light actually. I go with Bud Light when I don't opt for Diet Coke or water and have to choose among the 3."
"No body whatsoever, mouthfeel is very thin and watered down... drinks a lot like water, however you can only hope to have it taste that good."
"Bottle: Poured a very light yellow color lager with small bubbly head with not much retention. Aroma of adjunct and little else. Taste is very light indeed, similar to water with bit of corn in there. Body is so thin its unbelievable. Hard to believe but being stuck between the regular Bud and this, I would go with Bud."
"Moderate carbonation with a very thin body."
"I guess I just don't get it. This is the #1 selling beer in the U.S. It has no smell, no taste, no nothing none neither! Fizzy, watery and thin, and those are the good points."
"As they say ""it is what it is""..I'm surprised that this is not as bad as I thought....Bud Select is much worse...perhaps that is what I was expecting. I'd take most of the other light beers over this but it's drinkable if you're thirsty. (Now on to the Town Hall Smoked Porter growler review)"
"12 oz bottle at The Last Round Up in Stillwell, IN. You can imagine the beer selection they might have in Stillwell, IN. It was cold and wet. Bud Light finishes pretty dry. It has a mostly grainy aroma. Clear and bubbly. Bud light has its place. I'm glad to say that most of us think its in somebody else's fridge."
"Note: I was surprised to see this listed as a 4.2, I've always been under the impression it was 3.2%. Couldn't find anything on the can to verify this though."
"Drinkability: Sure you can pound these down. Sure it is easy to keg stand. But when it comes down to it, at a party I would always consider turning it down."
"This beer is bad. It tastes like they watered down budweiser. It seriously is watered down beer. Very popular beer, I don't know why though because it has less alcohol than budweiser. Virtually no smell, and no color. Very drinkable though. Watery taste. If you want a cheap crappy light beer coors is better than this stuff. Much better than a busch though! I wouldn't buy it, but i'll definetly drink it if it is free and people are around. By myself I dumped the last 1/4 bottle of this stuff out. Takes too many of these to get drunk anyway. Virtually know head and barely smell able."
"I will say one thing about this brew... I can drink these all day long without feeling it too bad the next morning.... and unlike alot of people, I dont find this beer particularly offensive, just boring. Maybe its because Ive drank so many of these that Im used to the taste. Regardless, Ive had worse beers."
"I was surprised to find out this beer is a 4.2%abv....I give this beer slightly above 1's just because in my book to get a 1 that beer needs to taste like puke,turd,actuall piss or in the ball park...and lets be honest its a bad beer but its not offensive....I can drink this crap all day and hardly get a buzz. Glad I dont deal with this anymore unless forced by circumstance."
"I can't understand how this sells well. It is unfortunate that many people have been conditioned to think that this is the 'king of beers'. People simply don't know what they are missing drinking this alcohol water. Any calories you save by drinking this are marginal, and you lose the ability to enjoy any taste."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Fizzy water, just bad. We need to wake the world up to better beer, because life is too short to drink this crap."
"A clear, very pale yellow. Dense 3 finger head that retains very well, leaving little to no lacing. the smell and taste are predictably very water with a faint adjunct presence. Low alcohol, low carbonation , and lack of taste make a very drinkable, but boring beer. Refreshing and light, but so is water."
"Dries out the mouth more than in the bottle and also had almost no carbonation. If I ever had to have this again I would rather not drink anything at all or bring a glass with me to the restroom. Not good at all."
"Body is razor thin, watery, and soda like. I think it would be better with some sugar and lemon juice in it. Beerinade."
"Not a good job even for a large american macrobrew. This beer pours a light yellow color with no head and has a metallic grain like scent. The taste is slightly malty, somewhat metallic and almost stale. Very little appealing flavor. Needs more kick and a higher ABV."
"drinkaility: if i want to drink water i'll drink water but i'll stick to the real deal beer"
"Water bodied. A lot of people drink this, and they drink it fast and cold. There is a reason for that."
"Looks like pee, maybe a little frothier. Smell of... Who am I kidding, none of that matters with this beer. This is absolutely the blandest, wateriest beer in the world. It hardly tastes like anything. Why do I give drinkability a 5? Because it's actually so watery that you could probably drink a hundred of them without any kind of cloying aftertaste (or taste at all for that matter). If you're drinking Bud Light you're probably at a crowded party or lame bar with little or nothing else to choose from, and it's easy enough to live with I suppose."
"Like stale ice water, flat club soda, too cold, nothing. Room temperature water is preferred. Slightly yellow, no head, a bit malts, Dry, metallic, can get one to swear off beer.This is one of America's most popular selling beers, what an embarrasment."
"It was served in a frosty cold mug. I don't think that the condensation hurt this beer. I will order this beer again on occasion, when Belgians are not availble, which is quite often as Alabama has the silly 6% max ABV law."
"Just a terrible beer. Nothing to note. Nothing at all. Blasphemy, is all I have to say."
"Drinkabability: My stomach was threatening a rebellion so I left this nasty beer on the table."
"bud light sucks, it tastes like water with a touch of old man ass seasoning. i have friends that drink this beer as if it was made of gold. i do not get it, the flavor is terrible, the smell is the best part about it and that isn't very good either as it tends to smell like a dirty glass. i put on-tap, however in my time obviously i've had this beer every way it can be served. i think the best this beer gets is in a beer funnel, that way you can't taste it and its gone before you realized it was a bud light, 2 thumbs down on this one!"
"I guess this is beer... I can't really tell. Not much color, basically a light yellow. High carbonation, and a weak head when poured does not speak well for this brew. Flavor of... watery corn, and watery hops, with a hint of watery malt. Very watery, if you get my drift. Finished weak, with literally no aftertaste, except that of, you guessed it, water. Nothing good here, go with a Miller light if you must."
"This is a simple review, this beer pours pour yellow, smells like nothing and tastes like nothing a sad beer and only reaffirms that the big 3 only care about making money and nothing else. When this beer hit the palate if tasted like corn and something like hops. This is a good beer to get drunk on, but that is it's only benefit"
"poured a pale yellow crystal clear color with moderate white puffy head. Little if any smell. Taste is very mild. Mouthfeel is mild. Drinkable due to its mildness. Good ""spacer beer"" between a nice imperial stout and a very hoppy pale ale"
"Bud Light is a decent beer to drink if you like average everyday domestic beers. If your looking for something tasty and special, you'd be barking up the wrong tree with this one. But if your looking for to slam back a bunch of beers on a hot summer day, Bud Light is not a bad choice at all. It does the trick, just in a boring, watery kind of way."
"I'm trying to do a better job of reviewing these beers according to BJCP judging standards. Under those standards, Bud Light clearly hits near average on every category. Genuinely inoffensive, just like a light lager apparently should be. Outside of mere judging standards, however, there's nothing in particular to recommend this beer."
"Drinkability: It is ok if you want to drink a bottle or two without getting loaded fast . Otherwise, if I want to drink beer, I will buy a real beer."
"Had this beer today when my stuff ran out at the family Easter dinner. The brew poured to a clear light yellow color with a fair sized bright white head that actually had some retention but left absolutely no lacing. The aromas of this brew are minimal at best; some malt and grain like characteristics but that would be all. The taste goes right along with the aroma, not much there. I cannot pick up any hint of hops and it has a somewhat sweet flavor. To be truthful it has the feel of soda water. Over all IMO this is a real bad beer but they do sell a lot of it."
"I stopped after one and never bothered trying to pair one with my chili. There seemed to be no point."
"Well, its drinkable, but pretty bland. Sort of like boiled lettuce thats been strained and then watered down. Next."
"Drinkability - None. Even if this is free, I will never drink it again as there are no redeeming qualities to this beverage."
"I know it's not popular to even review mass-produced, but...this beer is different. It's consistent, sure you'll say consistetnly bad, but no. This beer has never let me down. Drinkable during the summer, a good way to wash a ""hoppy"" beer down, goes well with the types of food I like. You'll say there is no craft in brewing this beer...well your right. It's a mindless beer in a time when there is too much to think about. Enjoy it, it's beer!"
"Pours a pale yellow color! Fizzy head at first, then nothing after that! Smells like old cooked rice and way to much of fake carbonation.The body is very thin. No hop flavor, just a little bit of grain and rice. There is nothing to it but a cheap buzz!"
"12 ounce can sampled. Comes with ""born on dating ""on the bottom of the can...Pours dull yellow and clear, medium bubble white head. The question I have is, how can so many people drink so much of this swill?? This is very lame brew, maybe I'd drink it again, but only only on a VERY hot day."
"a 1 rating ""awful"" really translates here as less than needed to be observable or not present which pretty much describes smell and mouthfeel. Taste is just less than not impressed. I was a 30 can silver bullet boater until I started homebrewing and expanding my style range around November last year. I still have 15 or 20 of my last 30 pack that I use to rinse out my glass ware and give to my neighbor who supplies my untreated deep well water for my homebrews."
"Aroma is corn and rice, some light hints of malt. flavor is metalic. finish is canned corn. Not good, but its better than coors light"
"Heck, for a all day Mardi Gras in St. Louis, it's not that bad. Not much taste, but is drinkable for the duration.Must have been a million cans of this stuff drank on Saturday. If someone gives me one of these, I'll certainly drink it. I try not to actually buy it too often, there are much more flavorable ones on the market."
"I had a Bud Light and some time so I figured why not review it. 12 oz., ""born on"" 1/20/05. Can't say they aren't fresh anyway. Pours into the pint glass with a half inch head (that leaves no lacing) on top of what looks like carbonated water with 1 drop of yellow food coloring added. Not much in the nose and what is there is a metallic/adjunct/ass smell. Almost no flavor - same description as scent here. Beer is thin and dry and seems overly carbonated as if it were a soda. Easy to drink 6 or 8 free ones at a keg party but keep it away from your personal stash."
"Clear, pale limpid-straw color. Aroma is almost non-existent, just a slightly sweet grainy scent. Clean sweetish malt flavor, very light, though no off flavors. I admit that using rice as a large adjunct instead of corn helps boost the flavor to a 2. Quick, reasonably dry finish. Body is thin, carbonation rather gassy. Not something I would drink if given the choice."
"Saw this in the fridge and decided to drink down. Appearance was very light yellow with minimal head...carbonation very evident. Smell was like corn, but very faint. Taste was almost non-existent, but there was a light corn syrupy feel. Mouthfeel is light and dry. Drinkability is ok, but so is water."
"despite how bad this is, i find it drinkable. due to it's watery characteristic and low ABV i could probably drink it all night, would i drink something else instead? yes, but would i drink this all night if the fridge was stocked? yep."
"A typical light lager that is an insult to the word 'beer'. This is more closely related to water IMO. Just a waste of my time."
"Uh, it's Bud Light. At least I tried it on tap. I did successfully avoid this beer for a very long time. But, I guess I decided to try it. No head, lightly piss colored. Some carbonation. Tastes like seltzer that you cracked open 4 years after the expiration date. Mouthfeel? Yeah, if you think water has mouthfeel. It's the lightest of light beers I've had, I'm not sure if that's a compliment or not."
"There wasn't really anything special about this beer. It would be a step up for big party hosts to purchase this rather than some of the other stuff they buy."
"Sampled (hah) at my friend's house from a 22 oz. bottle. Piss yellow with no head. Typical. Smelled fainlty of hops and malts, more-so than any other light lager I've head. Taste respectably balanced, with strong hops shining through, and a lingering malt back. The only problem is that it tastes artificial. Nothing tastes real. The best ""macro"" light beer, possibly the best ""macro"" in general, I've had to date. But not good."
"what a waste of anyones money or time to drink this beer. any light beer should be taken off of the market. i am glad that the rest of the world doesnt believe in these light beers and discrace themselves by making them. sparkling water with a drop of food coloring"
"Poured into a plastic cup, it was so pale and pathetic I could hardly tell it was beer. This pale yellow ghost had a fizzy white head quickly died down to nothing. Took a whiff and smelled stronly of sulfur with a hint of adjunct grains, I've had farts smell better than this brew. Taste was almost nonexistant but still was like the smell there was sulfur and adjunt grains. If you could drink a fart I think it would taste alot like this beer. This beer was too fizzy and overcarbonated, just one made me bloated. Mouthfeel was thin like water but sharp like seltzer water. Are there hops in this beer? Perhaps they added a hop cone or two to the whole kettle but I couldn't detect any hops. Beer is not very drinkable but I was able to finish one, it just wasn't pleasant."
"BAD!!"
"Bud Light isn't the worst beer I've ever had (at least it's not skunky), but...I haven't purchased this beer for myself in quite some time, and I don't plan to do so in the future. Drink one only if you're doing so for free."
"Comments - This beer is clean, crisp, and thirst quenching. Unfortunately, the list of good qualities ends there. The taste is borderline offensive. This beer is all about being easy to drink, while providing as few obstacles to your senses as possible."
"Before and during a recent football game, I was presented with one beer choice: Bud light. So, how bad could it be? Well, its not so much distasteful as non-tasteful. Its an unbelievably pale, watery, light shade of yellow. The head is minimal at best. No aroma, no taste. Maybe a hint of grain. Mouthfeel of carbonated water. No aftertaste. Frankly, drinking this beer is not much of an experience at all. Its easy to drink, but it certainly doesnt leave me with a desire for another."
"Not much to say that already hasn't been said about Bud Light. pale yellow, no aroma to it. The taste is water mixed with corn juice and then refrigerated. Bud Light is just another sad product of the carb craze. Bud Lght and all the other light lagers are the saddest syle of a beer ever made."
"had this at a graduation party, from the can. I guess if you like water from a can with a hint of flavor to it this would do. aroma hardly any. flavor corn and as it warmed up it just got bad I do have to say it was better than busch light by a slight margin."
"Overall-Veteran beer drinkers obviously hate this, as it isn't much of a real beer. But I suppose that's the reason it's light. This beer is a fine beginner's beer and middle of the road light beer and is good for a beginning drinker. Other than that it has no redeeming qualities that make it stand out, I feel it isn't as awful as some make it out to be, but if this is all you have in your life your definitely not a real beer drinker. I'd still have it if offered though."
"Hey it's a pretty good light beer, but it doesn't have much in the way of taste or flavor."
"The taste is horrible, like a bad corny bad veggtable taste, that only gets worse at it warms up. It basically has a mouthfeel consiting of water, so not much there, and considering the taste I personally can't get through one and would much prefer just drinking water."
"Respect beer."
"I dont see what the problem whit good ol Bud Light is. There are much worse beers in the world than this one. I have been known to at times put down a whole case of these. While it cannot compare with an import, not much American beer can. For what it is worth Bud Light is actually pretty good. Beats the hell out of its cousin Busch Light."
"It pours a transparent whitish yellow color with a thin quickly disappearring head, almost soda like. The aroma is faintly yeasty, there is no real malt aroma, and absolutely no hop aroma. The flavor is a quick watery hint of wheat malt and corn sugar. There is almost no body to this, and thankfully almost no aftertaste. This beer is made for sheer drinkability in terms of volume and not pleasure."
"This seems to be a typical example of an American macro light beer. Appearance is pale, watery yellow and smell is of the usual macro adjunct aroma. Taste presents a tiny bit of flavor, but mainly watered down mediocrity. I wouldn't recommend this to an average BA. Still, I found this to be a decent beer for hanging around with friends when you don't need anything anywhere near special. The colder the better here."
"The beer after spilling from the 12-ounce bottle sets in the glass a clear light yellow color with a minimal frothy bright white head that evaporates quickly leaving a thin bit of lace to coat the glass. Nose is malt, sweet and fresh with the start lightly malted and somewhat sweet, top is thin. Finish has a stern acidity and the hops light to the palate, fry aftertaste, a drinkable beer, and one I used to find enjoyable before I became addicted to over the top beers."
"Ahh yet another sample from me BUD MAN.. Do they really think the factory fresh Bud stuff is gonna change my mind? Pours the colour of washed out corn. Smells like chemicals, And tastes like it too. No hops, no malt. At least Miller High Life has character compared to this charlaten. Mouthfeel is the best part of this as its not to spritzy.. but Drinkability? Please.. the only reason to drink this is when its the only beer available!!"
"VERY drinkable... as water is very drinkable. But the only reason I went for it was because it was free. I wouldn't pay for this stuff."
"I can't believe some people drink this bile nightly. I'll stick with Guinness."
"There is no saving grace for Bud Light, though. Nothing. Every aspect of this beer is either painful or non-existant."
"A great friend of mine left a few of these in my fridge. I decided to crack them open and see what there is to see. The beer is a yellow, thin headed macro with a corny smell. This beer tastes like veggies from the crisper. The carbonation is moderate and the only thing that contributes to the mouthfeel. Drinkability is fairly high considering it is made to be consumed in high quantities by the least common denominator. A very average light beer.."
"There's my glowing review for Bud Light: Tastes and feels like paste, goes down 50% easier."
"I hate Bud Light, I hate Anheuser-Busch, I can't stand this stuff. But will always be a keg party staple for years to come (unfortunately)."
"Not something i would ever buy again,...ever"
"This stuff is no good..im sorry its just a bad beer..drink water ."
"This is the beer of choice for social gatherings. Well not any gatherings I would attend now. Moderatly priced and you get what you pay for. Clear yellow color reminds me of tainted water. Easy to drink must be ice cold or it tastes discusting. Smells like rice some mild bittered maltness. This beer has been around for years and is still very popular with the non micro and macro brew crowds. A nice long neck bottle in a cooler is perfect for a hot summer day especially when you are mowing the lawn or something. Something not to important. Not to impressive of a brew but still if you need to drink a cold one and they are around. Rather disapointing rereading this review. I am glad I have matured in taste."
"beer for people who hate beer sums it up. these people could teach the people at zepherhills something about waterd down. it's as drinkable as water so i can not knock it for that, but it does not have any taste. if it's the only thing available, i will drink it, it's better than corona, but that does not say much. but i would not buy it and laugh at the people who buy this and think it is good beer."
"- People need to read up on nutrition and realize the carb thing means nothing..."
"Why, oh why isn't there a ranking lower than ""1"?"
"This beer is what's wrong with America. Hands down the worst of the ""big three"". Second in sales only to it's equally terrible big brother. I was out with the guys and they had $3 pitchers of this stuff so I had little choice but to get it, as my friends are all near broke. We ended up downing at least 10 pitchers of this swill and while it got the job done, I think I'll man up and spring for the good stuff next time, even if I'm alone in doing so."
"Pours a pale golden watery color with a faint white foamy head that disappeared very, very quickly. No lacing on the glass at all. Carbonation bubbles abound. Smells grainy, and slightly stale. Not a very good smell. Tastes very sweet at first, no hop bitterness at all. Mouthfeel was very watery, along with extra fizzy. Lots of carbonation in this one. Overall, not much taste at all. I will pass on another."
"Can't stand this crap... wheres my magic hat?"
"It is only palatable if you are funneling it. That's it."
"Sometimes you need cheap, drinkable beer, though. If you want to pound some beers on a budget, not get filled up, and your goal is an inexpensive buzz, this is your beer. So frat boys unite!!"
"Overall, I had to give it 1 out of 5 swills."
"Pale yellow appearance with fizzy head. Smell was slightly sweet with adjuncts. There is some sweet malt and corn in the taste with faint bitterness. Very drinkable when cold. CONSIDERING THE STYLE, this is not bad... but not great either. Suitable drink for quenching thirst or guzzling a few down when complex taste is not desired."
" This might deserve more points for drinkability, because of its watery, interpretation of a light, pale, lager. But, nah..I'm rating it for what it is."
"The beer pours an almost clear color with a slight yellow hue. It has a frothy white head that quickly fades to spotty lacing. The aroma is almost non-existant. This beer is full of adjuncts and little malts. There is a small amount of bitter skunkiness to the aroma. The taste is almost non-existant. I feel like the dudes in the Miller Lite commercials who are pissed they can't taste their beer. It is very watered down and devoid of any flavor. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a low bodied beer with good carbonation. This is what the health freaks are drinking these days. I pitty them. I'll keep my beer gut and continue enjoying good beer, however many carbs it contains."
"Cheers"
"How do I start this review? I am well aware that the real beer connoisseur's will be put off by this but I will state my case for this beer as best I can,when I am in the mood to pound some beer and am short in pocket ,I love this beer! it doesn't give me a bad hangover ,it's not as bloating or as filling as regular Bud,but gives you that same Rock'n'Roll buzz.It is a great summer at the beach beer as it is easy going down and you won't get too F#$% up.I guess it's charm is it's not offensive in any way it's not too hoppy,it's not too malty, it's just right, the way American beers we were brought up on were meant to be. in fact it's not to anything ...that is why some people love it and some people hate it . Thanks"
"This, even though its one of my lowest rated beers its still one of my favorite beers to drink. Aside form having my brew fridge stuffed with hig qulity beers i always have bud light. Its refreshing crisp and clean and personally tastes better than all the other macro light lagers. It pours a plae yellow and has some hints of hops in the smell, not alot because it is infused with the malt. The taste is pretty bland but it has some hints of matliness and some very little bitterness."
"Drinkable as in seltzer water."
"Poured crystal clear light yellowish gold with no foam. Smell was like stale moldy bread, which made me want to put it down. Taste was plain and boring, somewhat pungent, with no hop flavors apparent at all. The aftertaste would not go away. A poor example of a light lager."
"ok. so we skate this dude kirk's backyard pool all the time, and the price of admission is you have to bring him budlight. so sometimes that what gets passed around and while yes im a BA and i should spread the knowledge, these are old beat up skateboarders and they dont really give a shit about my beer knowledge. that being said, it pours out clear, yellow, weak. the head is sad, fizzy, not happenin. the smell sucks, it smells spoiled. the taste is light to say the least. watery, but light hops are in the mix. somewhat refreshing, but only when its hot as hell. after 2 or so...ill go back to my water."
"I know the rules say, ""Don't slam a beer . . ."" Well, Jason and Todd, I'm tryin', and this is the best I can do. Don't delete my account, please. I'm just a newby."
"this beer is awful, and offers no redeeming qualities. i'd rather give the bartender $3.50 and have him punch me in the face than drink this horse piss."
"Bud Light tastes a lot like seltzer water. If you have to get drunk on cheap beer this will do the trick and it won't overpower your palete like it's big brother ""The King of Beers"" will. Of the light domestics this one is the easiest one to handle."
"Bud Light has the best commercials as far as beer is concerned. So how is the actual beer? No good in fact not good at all. Bud Light you could drink a case in a day because it is like water. It pours a straw yellow where you have to pour the beer hard to get a head, that lasts for only seconds. The smell is hard to put a finger on. A hint of water mixed with cereal. Weird I know but to me that is what it smells like. When in the mouth the tastebuds don't sense much sensation, the drinkability is high because you could drink a million of these, like downing water. Funny how the cheaper Natural Light by AB is better than the more expensive Bud Light by AB. Still both are not what I would call BEER!"
"Pale yellow urine-like color. Quickly fading head that's watery and fizzy. Smell is of soggy cereal, like bad rice krispies. mmmm adjuncts fill the palet. More rice and flavorless filler. Aparently they ran out of hops and malts at the brewery...maybe I should call Anheuser-Busch and tell them... This stuff is just bad to even worse."
"This was one of those beers i drank before i knew better. Appearance straw colored, smell is of cooked veggies. Taste is rather watery. Average drinkability. Not offensive, but nothing to write home about either. Stay away if at all possible...you are warned!"
"A great beverage, but a mediocre-at-best beer. Still, if the grill's going, the reggae's pounding, the sun is shining, the guests are milling and you've got a long day ahead of you, do you care? If not, here you go."
"Another billiard tournament, another crappy beer sponsor. Poured into a frozen mug. Usually I don't use frozen mugs, but this calls for an exception. Even with proper pour, the head was pathetic. About half a thumb widths of foam that lasted less than a minute. Some ice particles started to form on the surface. Pale, and I do mean pale, yellow. Very faint smell. Mostly adjuncts so weak I couldn't tell what they were. Light taste. It isn't water, but it's close to it. Some rice is on the tongue. No bitterness, sweetness, nor aftertaste. Mouthfeel is thin. It feels thinner than water. Is that possible? For a liquid to be thinner than water? Drinkable as swill. Drinkable like tap water. Which doesn't mean a thing. Not a good beer."
"The beer is generally over-carbonated and snaps in your mouth like pop-rocks, but a good game of beer pong or 3-man can force you to finish several of these (and you don't feel it until number 6 or 7)"
"This is one of the worst beers I have ever consumed. I was invited to a party tonight and knowing full well that the beer selection would suck, I prepared myself. The only saving grace was that it was out of a keg and not cans or bottles, so it could have been worse! The pour was almost transparent at expected, with a slight head that subsided quickly. The smell was of light grain and that's about it. The taste was grain at the very beginning, then the seltzer water taste set in with the slightly dry carbonation making up the rest of the ""flavor"". This beer is just wrong."
"Poured a transparent yellow colour with a small white head that went away real fast with no lacing. The smell was of skunk. Nothing else. It was the worst smelling beer I have ever had. The taste wasn't as bad as the smell, but it did leave a lot to be desired. There was no hints of hops and only small hints of malts. Everything else was adjuncts."
"For the money your better off with Miller Lite if you are looking for a light brew."
"My Belgian-made pint glass is none too pleased with me right now for filling it with this vile liquid. And my kitchen sink drain isn't too happy either. The pint glass says that it may forgive me if a Storm King Stout is in its immediate future."
"Obviously- avoid if at all possible"
"Possibly the hardest beer to review I've ever tried, since there's no real flavor or complexity to comment on. If you're a BA member, chances are you've already tried this and know to stay away. If you're looking for cheap beer and like this ""style," go with the vastly better (and cheaper) options: Stroh's, National Bohemian, PBR. Stay away."
"Overall: A beer with zero peronality, but is extremely drinkable. Good for the ball game or a long night out. Geez, it's like $1.50 a pint, so why not settle in with a few Bud Lights?"
"Anyway I can remember in highschool and college drinking this in mass quantity. Knowing nothing about a good beer. There is no smell to it at all very bland. Taste was weak at best and the after taste was that of 2 month old rotting underware. Mouthfeel consistant with tap water, but very easy to drink, if that happens to be your goal."
"At first the taste was very similar to Budweiser, but the aftertaste was pretty bad. Typical Diet Beer. If I were drinking quantity, it might pass, but it's even a few notches down from regular Bud--the self-proclaimed king of beers."
"lemonade color body, frighteningly white head, decent lacing to the bottom of my cup. Astonishingly little aroma, but what aroma there is is of corn and lemon. The faintest taste of pale malt and corn. mouthfeel is of pelligrino which is good for pelligrino, but not for beer. This beer was gone in a flash, not because it was so tasty, but because there was nothing to saver."
"In retrospect, I guess I was just being polite. In the future, I'll come up with a good excuse (like, I have hepatitis) to avoid the near-destruction of my palate. Bud Light is, in a word: crap."
"PAX"
"Its beers like this that sent us searching for web sites like this. Transparent, nice enough head, faint taste of some adjunct and then seltzer. I taste tested this with 3 other lights and it came out last. Yet I have two friends who proudly proclaim this is all they drink and yes they both have huge NASCAR posters in their garage"
"Clearly, not brewed with the likes of me in mind, but hey, if you enjoy draining bottles and cans of nothingness down your gullet, be my guest."
"Another lousy light beer. Try it just to remind yourself what bad beer tastes like."
"- Backdated tasting: I first reviewed this beer on 28JUN03, this post is based on notes from that review. -"
"Or at least, that what it tasted like. Why the hell I didn't switch to the crap wine instead of beer, I'll never know. But I didn't. And so therein lies the inspiration for this review."
"Picked up a couple cans at a wedding only to re-try this for this was a pre-BA brew for me some many years back. I've come along way since only to wonder how this mass-produced light straw colored little beer holds such a large market share. It pours so clear you can see through it, as its pouring! The head is white and fizzy. It fades very fast to not even a thin film. The body is weak and lace is wispy if at all. Hops & malt, don't even go there, for not much to be found. A slight bitter, dry finish with some alcohol kick, if you drink enough of them. That must be the mass appeal."
"i hate his beer. as anything 'bud' seems to give me a headache (even just one), this one follows suit, but seeing as it's so watered down, it gave me less of a headache, so bonus points, i guess. basically, this looks and smells like the toilet water i just pissed in. not that i'd know, but i can't imagine this tastes much better wither. just plain awful. like water mixed with chemicals or something. no real beer flavouring here at all, save for a bit of graininess, perhaps. keep this one away from me."
"Had this after golf because the clubhouse didn't really offer anything else. Fairly easy to drink without getting drunk, just very little flavor. I'll get around to reviewing Coors, just not sure I want to ruin my memories of what I used to drink, but this was definately not a winner for me. Glad I steered clear of it in college, otherwise I might still be stuck on it."
"Drink up"
"Cristal clear headless pale golden tone with not very much to it....Slight hoppy smell not very elaborate or strong. Brutal taste, terribly weak and watery with some carbonation and some perception of hops at the end, but rather like dirty water than beer. I just wish there weren't so many in my fridge right now...."
"there are no hops, no malt, but plenty of water was used, and apparently yeast was present at some point"
"Had to go with the draft special here because I was low on cash. This beer was served close to freezing temperatures and was nearly giving me brain freezes as I drank. Of course this beer poured out a very clear and light pale yellow color. The head was thin. Tons of carbonation. Slight whiffs of grains and rice from the aroma. Hard to tell since I was drinking yellow liquid nitrogen. It was hot outside and it paired very well with the hot wings I was eating. Left a slight oiliness on the tongue. I didnt let it get warm. I dont know if thats a good thing or not."
"I suppose I'll rate Bud Light just because it's so commonplace. Bud Light is an enjoyable beer, but it is very boring because it is a mass produced beverage. It's a good beer to drink when you're out somewhere because you can find it anywhere. If you've not had it, you're out of the loop. The pour is pretty boring, the aroma is kinda boring and the flavor is pretty plain, but it is a staple in modern America. Not a bad drink, but if you're looking for an intersting beer, this one isn't for you."
"I did try this beer, before they water it down at an A-B tour, and man, that was good! Why don't they sell that???"
"Overall, this is a clean lager that gives the impression that it's about half beer and half water. Very little character."
"Pours a very pale straw color that is nearly crystal clear yet has alot of bubbles racing towards the headless top of this beer. The smell is extremely mellow with hardly any character at all. The first impression from the taste is alot of carb bite and abruptly changes to a very faint lightly sweetened earthy grain and not much else going on. It is very light bodied and finishes some way or another, just too faint to tell. Goes down easy in the hot Texas sun, but I'm not a fan of AB products in general. Cheers!"
"For the BJCP style American light lager, this is pretty good, maybe 4.2 / 5, but it could be a little less syrupy."
"Bud Light is the most unoffensive beer in the world. The appearance is a pale golden fizzy yellow tone with a highly carbonated fizzy white head that does stay around for a little suprisingly not much lace going on here. Aroma is not off just mild sweetness derived from corn, rice, and malted barley. My theory is that people who don't like beer drink this beer, because you don't have to think about it there's not much to analyze here or to taste for that matter. Flavors blend smoothly because nothing stands out enough to collide so this is for the masses and their marketing campaign allows them to reach more people than I can fathom. Mouthfeel is thin and highly carbonated like a soda water flavored beer. Drinkability on a couple levels does this challenge my senses and make me yearn for another well no, but can I drink alot of this low alcohol light beer yes probably a 12 pack but is it worth it not in my opinion."
"I remember thinking that this stuff was crap even before I knew what good beer was. But I was at my friend's house a few nights ago and all he drinks is Bud Light. I wanted a drink so I decided to have one. Wow was that one bad tasting beer. I could only drink one that night. Not quite as watery as some other macro lights but that might not be a good thing. The only taste I recognize is grass. I'm swearing this stuff off for good."
"Drinkability - man, at 6 bucks a beer, I gotta find regular Bud. For a first round, to quench the thirst and all, this does the trick, but after one, it's really time to shift gear into some higher octane brew. The evening's beer search continues with my Bud on-tap review, up next..."
"This brew poured a medium head of fine to medium sized white bubbles and produced a has a rice beer aroma. The head quickly disappeared before I could take my first taste. Its body is a transparent urine yellow color with carbonation rising in the mug. Very little taste to this brew of mostly fizz. What little taste there is is that of rice and water."
"This draft beer came to me looking pretty normal. A light yellow in color with no head or lace in this brew. The aroma was week, slight hint of malt and grains but that was it. A slightly malt start and a bitter/dry after taste, watered down is the best description for the taste. Nothing impressive. Better off drinking water."
"I think most people drink it because they want to drink but keep the evening as low cal as alcohol can be."
"I would think this is the lowpoint of my beer reviews. The best selling beer in America pours pale and clear with only a wisp of a head forming. The aroma is the standard AB green apple smell, no hops to speak of, no real malt aroma either. The taste is watery, smooth, and no dominant characteristics. I only would drink this if given to me while visiting somebody's home."
"There are two things that perplex me. One, the fact that some people will hate any AB product de facto. Secondly, that a ''beer advocate"" would drink a lite beer expecting some mona lisa type masterpiece in a glass. It's fucking light beer. If you want a beer good for drinking with a diverse crowd this is the right beer. If you want a beer that you can drink in mass quanities with no problem, this is the right beer. If you want something complex and interesting then find something that was meant to be complex and interesting."
"Bud Light. I can't believe I drank this. Pours a very pale yellow color with a loose, artificial looking head. The head fades quickly into oblivion. Smell, what smell? Maybe a hint of graininess. Taste: Metallic water. Not all that much here. Mouthfeel is very harsh, with gargantuan bubbles rasping at my tongue and throat. Drinkability, poor. I'd rather drink water. I suffered through this one in the name of Beer Advocacy. Maybe the worst light macro I've had."
"Mouthfeel is so thin as to be almost nonexistent. Drinkability is about the same as a club soda or other carbonated water. Truly an abysmal product."
"Compared to Coors & Miller Light/Lite this is pretty bad. I mean, it's decent, but it is certainly nothing to write home about. It'll do if you have nothing else around, but certainly not a top pick. Taste good after about the 5th or 6th time around. Usually better to start with something stronger like Budweiser, then the more you drink throughout the day gradually slow down with a Bud Light."
"This beer poured a quick dissolving head. It was watery. It was yellow in color. There was definitely carbonation in this beer. There was not much taste to this beer at all. I was totally unimpressed by yet another American beer. I am glad I have this rating over with."
"Baaaaaadddd. Straw-transparent color with white fizzy head. Bottle opened like a bottle of seltzer with the sound off psssttttt. Flavorless at first but leaves an after taste of adjuncts, corn, and veggies. Carbonation is off the charts. Its light and tasteless, making it an acceptable substitute for water (or even milk, right PETA?)."
"I can't stand Budweiser and Bud Light is more of the same garbage with even less redeeming qualities. This is a beer for people who don't like the taste of beer, so they choose something that lacks any and all flavor characteristics. If you're watching calories drink water or certainly find a light beer with some kind of flavor."
"Always looks better than it tastes, this pours a yellow color with a foamy white head. Head dissipates almost immediately and leaves no lacing. Tastes the standard A-B bad with tinges of bad adjuncts and the bad hops that A-B always uses. Pass on this unless you want to have bad memories. We use this to baste hams."
"I ran out of beers and some chicks gave me one of these. Needless to say i took it, but as far as beers go, this is towards the bottom of the barrel. If you were going to drink anything for this company, bud heavy should be the only thing you consider. Not worth buying."
"How can I review a beer so horrible, It's macrogarbage at its worst. I don't even care to think about how bad this is, one taste will tell you, damn what am I thinking and drinking. Stick to WATER as with all AB products, it doesn't matter which beer it is Dry, Ice, Original, or Light. They are all lousy and of poor quality and that born on date doesn't matter if you drank it from the brewery itself."
"I guess for a light beer it's not bad. Pours with almost no head, light straw color. Taste is of watered down grains. Hops are played out if at all present in taste. A distinct pungent chemical like taste pervades. I found myself longing for a regular Bud, which indicates just how bad this stuff is."
"This was my beer of choice before I stumbled across good beers. Now drinking it again, I wonder how I managed to be happy with it before. This beer is really bland even when compared to other beers in its style. It is ok if there is not much choice, and you really want to get drunk, but if you want to enjoy a beer, pass this one by."
"I asked the bartender for a sample of this (I've never had it before) and he looked at me as if I were crazy. I knew I didn't want a whole pint, I just wanted to see how bad this crap really was. It is bad. Pale pale yellow. Tastes more like water than beer. I'm not sure why people drink this. Yuck!"
"Before I found good beer, I drank Bud Light as one of my regulars. Yes, I give it credit for being a light beer and do take that into consideration in my review, but the facts shine through: This beer is one of the blandest, dullest most over-mass-produced, flavorless beer-water beverages on Earth. But it does have fewer calories. Yes, you can down a few if they are ice cold, but try getting a good buzz? Forget it. Anyway, there is worse (Coors Light), so this beer doesn't bring up the rear."
"taste = bad beer mixed w/water. If this is all we've got I'll ask for water instead. If I'm dieting I'd rather drink one GOOD brew and 2 glasses of water than sit around drinking 3 of these."
"F."
"It has all been said about this one. It is true this beer has no taste and very little aroma, but I have to show a little respect. This was the first brew I've ever had. I guess you could say it got me interested in beer. I will still drink this brew if it is the only thing offered especially after a long hard day, but only if it is the only thing offered."
" First of all, the color is disconcerting. It looks more like a bodily fluid than a beer. Then you get to the taste..ugh. Watery, but with a slight taste of leftovers scraped from the floor when they brewed regular Bud tossed in. Combine that with the average price tag for a 24 pack being around $14 and you get an all-around rip-off. Its considered good beer by those who have never had anything except for MGD, Rolling Rock, or Coors Light. Personally, I'd rather have a Keystone Light, Natty Light, or even a PBR. Those three beers are not only more satisfying, they are half the price of this overpriced beer-water. Hey, at least the commercials are good. (I attend college in Williamsburg, VA, right next to Busch Gardens and the AB Brewery. I have to smell this stuff being brewed.)"
"My finacee's dad drinks this stuff all the time. He's given me some, but that has been the only time I drink it, and that was only when I was ""hard up"" for beer. What can I say about it? It's light in color, with a little head, due to carbonation. The taste is nothing great. It's just there. I guess if I had to describe it, I would say that it was like stale water, with some hoppiness to it. The mouthfeel is somewhat remeniscent of water. Not much on the drinkability scale, but it's better than ""The Bull""."
"The beer from a tap poured to give a light golden beer with very little carbonation and only a small head. The aroma was very, very slight (malt?). The taste is very light, but not tasteless. As far as ""light beers"" it serves the purpose, I suppose. There is very little mouthfeel since it is so thin, but there is some tiny amount of hops in the finish. The drinkability is low, but if you must, make sure it is ice cold."
"Oh how the palate has changed. Not that I often drank this but it regularly showed up at many family gatherings as it did this night. Poured a light golden color with a decent head that lasted longer than I expected. Doesn't look bad but the nose really didn't give any hints as to the taste to come ( or maybe it did?) Watered down, bitter, and overall not tasty. I drank it but the first sip made me cringe. Switched to soda until I could get home to some real beer."
"a good bottled water would serve me better."
"Perfectly clear and almost colorless with a large snow-white head and moderate carbonation. Rather faint aroma of grain and a mere rumor of hops. Mouthfeel is quite watery, carbonation stings a bit sharply. Tasting yields a little malt which fades to a faint bit of lemon hops with a crisp and dry finish. Little more in character than a sparkling mineral water would offer."
"It is amazing the changes that have taken place for me over the past five years in terms of my beer selection. In college I thought BL was a good beer, I had so much to learn. This beer looks, smells and tastes like water with corn added. To each his own, but this one isn't for me."
" beer.Makes coors light taste like a refreshing drink!"
"Pours a very clear, yellowish/light straw gold with a white head that drops almost immediately to just a collar. The aroma is quite limited but offers some dull maltiness if you seek it out. The body is light with a very fine carbonation that's gently crisp in the mouth. The flavor is limited as well, but offers a clean combination of gentle malt and mild hop. It finishes exceptionally clean and drying. There's not really much here, but I guess that's the point of light beer. What makes it stand out in its category, however, is that there's absolutely no off-flavor to it and the balance is dead on. Very well made."
"I enjoyed it...."
"Absolute worst of the american macro-lights. Very, very, very pale. Very pale. It was only a little grainy smelling, that's it. Not really any malt to speak of, and as for hops, the only hops this beer had in it is some that my have diffused through the packaging from some good beer it was sitting next to on the shelf. Very carbonated. Like soda water with yellow food coloring. The only reason I got this was because it was the cheapest 6-pack in the store. This was also the reason for the drinkability not being ""aweful""."
"I was having a feud with neighbor and I bought a six pack of these to empty and then throw on his yard. Definite ""white trash"" beer. People who like this are into stock car racing and hunting. I personally think it has no taste. I once tried to steam mussels in it, but that didn't even produce a taste. Will go with out before I drink this."
"Well you know, cheap and easy to drink but not a great tasting beer.  Light body, no head, plenty of corn and rice though.  For cheap shit it works.  I will have on hand for my friends that do appricate the good stuff."
"This is not a very good product. Overall it has a very bland appearance, no highlights, no real color. There isn't a very defined scent, the aroma is very faint because it is barley there to begin with. I can not drink this. It has a very sandy texture and goes down rougher than warm ginger ale."
"Pale liquid, not so much straw-colored as it is just gray. A scary, dead-looking color. Freakishly clown-like aromas of cotton candy, sweet-heart candy, formaldehyde... I don't think I can drink this ""beer."" I push on. Wow. The flavors are thankfully very watery. I was afraid I would have to taste what I smelled. There is a very faint echo of the aromas on the palate, like it is coming to me across a vast distance. I feel safe. If I was a gutter alcoholic, I might consider drinking this... if it were free."
"Very pale yellow with not much of a head. Clean smell and very fizzy, like a soda. Not much flavor here at all. If you like water, this is for you...but water is cheaper. It will quench your thirst and thats about it. At least it's not skunky. Very easy too drink, it's a party beer."
"Whereas Budweiser specifically lists that it is brewed with rice on it's label, Bud Light says ""select grains", meaning there's probably corn AND rice in there (not to mention a slew of other Anheuser-Busch chemicals).  I do find it very drinkable, as it would go great with greasy BBQ food.  A non-offensive beer, and I am sure that there are worse beers than this out there."
"Pale gold in hue with small white head; poor retention. There was almost no lace. The nose is unremarkable and not noteworthy. Typical light American-Macro taste, some sweetness, graininess, plenty of water, it is largely devoid of flavor. If Anheuser-Busch didnt spend a zillion dollars on marketing this beer they would have very few people drinking it. I wish I could give drinkability a zero; Bud Light makes me fiercely sick, after two bottles I am in the bathroom (Ill spare the details)."
"whew, this was rough. out of the keg, it stank horribly, and it was a struggle to down. i needed to start with some good stuff before breaking into this one"
"The best way to describe this Beer would be mundane."
"Pours crystal clear, faintly yellow to nearly transparent color. Head is at first bubbly and white then dissappears like a ghost fart..........Smell is mostly grainy, and metallic bitterness. Taste is same wierd grainy, metallic, watery, and just plain awful. The bottom of the beer was much worse. This beer is only tolerable if drank extremely cold, and jostled around enough to produce some foam..like in a golf cart, or mowing the lawn.....shaking it up produces those same faint beer like qualities as budweiser, only less so. Wierd sourness to finish with watery feel. Not a good feeling....I don't see how they seell so many of these.......To my surprise Budweiser actually tasted much better."
"Truly a beer for people who don't like the taste of beer. Why waste your time unless you are trying to add to your tiotal of beers that you have tried."
"Okaysince I made my confessional about Budweiser, time to reveal my Bud Light drinking.  Okay, we have a friday bar at work.  Since everyone seems to be watching their weight, the normal selection is often mostly light.  If you don't get there soon, all the few microbrews are long gone(story of my life).  I drink this practically every Friday because it's that or Heinekin and sorry I hate the skunky smell.  The beer is a lighter version of Bud, drinkable, but almost not there in terms of taste, body or character."
"Stupid of me to even try, I will continue to avoid like the plague."
"This is one of the worst beers I have ever tasted. I have had beers that I didn't like, but that didn't mean this is bad. This beer is so lacking in flavor, that if it were skunky, it would make it more tasty. This beer is very light in color, almost no head.  First impression of taste is of...bitter seltzer water.  When the beer warms up the corn adjunts shine further commiting this beer to be destined to be dumped down the drain.  Alternately try a Miller Light, MGD light, or even Coors Light."
"Hard to believe this is the best selling beer in the US, if not the world.  It is an adjunct lover’s idea of heaven.  It has that bad A-B adjunct after bite.  No redeeming values, whatsoever.  Treat yourself instead: Get a 30 pack of PBR."
"Ack, can't believe people are giving this beer good reviews.  As my one friend puts it: ""Drinking bud light is like drinking yak ****"".  Don't know how he would know that, but I always take his word for it.  Never thought I liked beer because I was always presented with stuff like this."
"I still don't get the light beer market. Add more water. A little bit of beer to clean out the urinary tract. Ohhhh... it's medicinal. In any case this is another poor light beer (if there is a good one). Take Budweiser (which is tolerable, more-so with NASCAR) and add dirty water."
"Slightly yellow, clear and way over force carbonated.  no real head or smell.  Plain and watery tasting.  The selzer of beers..."
"Not much difference from regular Budweiser, but does taste a little bit better. Again though, if you are drinking light beer, you might as well save a few bucks and go get some Nattie, because there isnt much difference. And who are you kidding, you are only using it for beer pong or funneling anyway."
"I really don't like A-B products.  This is like alcoholic water.  Translucent yellow without the slightest hint of any kind of head.  I've had water with more flavor than this.  The only reason I rate this beer as high as I do is because it doesn't taste bad.  It just doesn't taste at all.  I will drink one of these if it is offered by a friend and there isn't anything else besides its peers, but that is the only time.  If this isn't free then I'm not drinking it."
"clear pale yellow, hardly any color at all.  no discerning aroma at all which is good because i really despise that corn adjunt smell in a lot of other macro lagers.  light body with a certain crispness that dances on the tongue a bit.  nothing offending here. goes down crisp and clean. better than most light beers as far as i'm concerned."
"Like all light beers, this is fairly easy to rip on, but that has been done, ad nauseum, so instead, I'll offer up some alternative thoughts. If it weren't for this beer, how many people would drink beer at all? Think about it. From young woman to old men, you see every age group and demographic drinking this. Sure, they advertise like crazy, which I am sure lends itself to the masses, but it does have mass appeal. It is what it is...a very, very, very mild tasting beer. Not much in terms of hops, malt or balance, but something to chug while standing on an asphalt pavement after a softball game on a 90-degree day (water is good in this situation too) Eventually, people who start to appreciate beer move on from this to better beer. Not much different than Miller Lite, Coors Light, Busch Light, Michelob Light, or any other light. In its class, Amstel Light is better as is Sam Adams Light."
"Nearly colorless, nearly flavorless. Starts out fizzy carbonated, with a distinct fermented rice sweet/sour flavor that's rather unpleasant if you've had any malt beers in the past day or so. It sweetens slightly over the sip, while the finish is, well, not there at all. It's a ""clean, crisp"" alcohol delivery device with some vague resemblance to beer. Is that worth spending money on?"
"Have you seen American Pie 2 when Shifler was laying back blindfolded and the girl was going to feed him champagne but was knocked out by a falling flower pot...and then the guy on the balcony relieves himself all over shiflers face?? Well, I think that drinking Bud Light is a similar experience. The taste is of a mild urine quality (I'm guessing that's what urine tastes like) with a twang of aluminum can for an aftertaste. The only nastier beer I have drank is Skol somewhere overseas. A good inbred hillbilly beer though..."
"Tastes like wet air...popularity goes to show the power of advertising. Try something with SOME flavor at least!"
"Pale and insipid.  After adding a shot of Sambuca it became a very driunkable beverage."
"10/10/01 update:  This is now officially  the most popular beer in America.  I'm moving to Canada."
"If i wanted something that tasted like Corn Flakes in water, i would have a bowl of Corn Flakes in water."
"A watered down version of a watered down version......."
"Notes: This beer is for the tasteless beer drinker that thinks there is only ONE beer out there. You may as well drink some seltzer water with alcohol added to it … get the picture, you are not a real beer drinker!"
"Had one the other night because that was all that was available.  I'd forgotten how watery a beer can be, and yet not be water.  Mild and slightly sweet, a beer designed for mass consumption by the masses."
