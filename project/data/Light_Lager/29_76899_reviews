"Last time I drank this there was a family crisis"
""
"It might just be me, but this beer has a smell and taste that reminds me ever so faintly of the way nail polish remover smells. I found it pretty undrinkable, and poured it down the drain."
""
""
""
""
""
"Really horrible. I guess the draw is that it's 90 calories at 6%?"
""
"A friend left it in the fridge.  Decided, I would try to see what brewed the Hard Way was all about.  Half way through the beer, I accidentally knocked my glass over and broke it.  I think God was sending me a message."
""
"Like it better than regular Bud"
""
""
""
""
""
"Served in a Pilsner glass"
"Better ABV than other Bud products, but has a different after taste."
"This beer is pretty good."
"Pours a thin yellow with a fizzy head. Smells slightly metallic with a lot of alcohol. The taste is just bud light with a bit more alcohol on the finish. Not a fan of the beer but I can see why it's popular."
""
"This is a good once in a while beer"
""
""
""
""
"This is basically a light malt liquor, and rather unique as it is.  It's not very flavorful but it's also not terrible.  This beer would be good for someone who likes light lagers but wants a bit more kick."
"Better than regular Bud Light. A little more body, and flavor.  I guess the little extra alcohol content helps it.  Don't let the low ratings fool you. It a pretty good drink."
"Finally found a cheap beer that is decent enough to border on enjoyable. Smooth on the front, slightly sweet and ever so slightly spicy on the finish. Almost as if they made a 50/50 mix of club soda and duvel. For a dollar more for a 12 pack then regular bud light, thus definitely will be my go to party session beer."
""
"Their they go again.....keeping horrible beer alive"
"Better than bud light, still bud.  Drinkable."
""
"Pouted from a 12 oz bottle. Pours very pale straw color, crystal clear. There is ZERO head, and no lacing. There is more smell than most lagers, mostly grain and small flecks of citrus. No hops to speak of. Taste is much of the same, malted grain flavor, no alcohol on the palate, no hoppy bitterness. Fair for this style of beer. Feel is a bit odd. Feels much like tonic water, thin, wispy with loads of cola carbonation. This is the second Platinum I've tried, and it is my last."
"Taste is smooth and completely better than any other Budweiser beers"
"If you drink it fast enough, it doesn't taste like much and gets you buzzed. Usually can be found for a buck at Kroger."
""
""
"W/e and won't drink again..."
"Beer for college chicks looking to get drunk faster.  Putrid..."
""
""
"I don't understand why this exists. just buy good beer, folks."
"Solid sessionable macro. It is what it is."
""
"wasn't sure it was possible to be worse than bud light, but you pulled it off!"
"Looks great, but not a lot of taste but very drinkable and pretty much everyone will drink it.  Basically a stronger version that taste almost the same as bud light but for a more stressful day."
""
""
""
""
"Does not taste bad at all"
""
""
""
""
"Actually surprised it wasn't worse."
""

"Not an IPA but not bad."

"I feel most of the poor reviews come from people comparing this to craft beers. This is not a craft beer and it isn't trying to be one. This is a beer for BBQs and hot days. It's crisp, clean, easy to drink and doesn't weigh you down. It also is good for night life because is doesn't make you as tired as other heavier beers. For it's purpose I feel this is a pretty decent beer."

"Jeeez! you would think this stuff is brewed with toxic waste and camel piss from so many of the ultra Poor reviews here on ""Beer SNOB Advocate"" ...why is it that so many of you yuppie scumbag morons have to slag EVERY single American made ""Macro Lager"" there is? hey,I am NOT a ""Light Beer"" guy,and I drink ALL kinds of Beers/ales,in fact in my fridge right now I have ,"Ballast Point Sculpin & Big Eye IPA,Sierra Nevada Pale ale,Torpedo,and Celebration,Porter & stout,also have some olde English 800,colt 45,Schlitz malt liquor"" OML"" and a bunch of Macro Lagers too~ Bud/Coors/Pabst/Schlitz...I LOVE all kinds of beer is my point, but reading some [most] of the reviews here about ""Bud Light  Platinum""  it makes me really hate all you ""Beer Snobs"" even more,so it is not a gr8 beer,but for a light American made Macro lager,it is not bad @ all,I would 4sure serve this beer @ BBQ's,with steamed shrimp/Crabs,or any sort of get together where all you want is a cold ,crisp,refreshing beer that does not weigh you down or fill you up,and as far as ""Light Beers"" go..I actually like this one quite a bit, STOP rating beers the WRONG way yuppie scum,rate them for their style,and do not compare them to your favorite Craft Beer that cost 20 bucks a 6er! hope all yer BMW's blow a piston~whiny clowns..."

"Overall: Flavourless brew. Drinkable, but only because it tastes like sweet water and nothing else."
""
""
""
"I do not enjoy this beer, very sweet, almost tastes like regular bud light had a baby with Sweet & Low. The red bull like cans are a turn off as well, I think."
""
""
"I think Bud Light is a little better flavor-wise but Platinum has the higher ABV. Nothing wrong with drinking these, cheap and easy to drink. Take Bud Light over Corona or Heineken ten times out of ten."

"If only it was made of platinum, you could take it to one of those coin and jewelry stores and sell it! can tell any difference from regular Bud Light, I do like the velvet finish of this beer that's about it."

"The marketing makes the company rich and the blue bottle makes it look cool but that all ends when you crack it open and take a swig.  Typical of most American beers, not worth drinking and a joke to beer drinkers worldwide.  Question is, why is it popular and still on the market?"

"Overall (1.13) : This is like a triple distilled malt liquor that finishes like rubbing alcohol. It has flavors but they're all off. It's like I'm drinking watered down malted bleach and antiseptic mixed with cheap vodka. If you hate yourself you'll drink this beer. This is honestly the worst, most horrible beer I've ever laid lips to. This is liquid feces from the depths of hell. My natural, uncensored reaction to this is ""holy s**t this is bad"". Who approved this out of the brewery? Furthermore, who are the sick people that buy this stuff? I'm going to flag down and warn anybody who tries to buy this beer from our gas station. I think I'll go pour this out now..."

"Look, I may have just signed up on this site, but keep in mind that this was a beer that finally enticed me to review, and possibly because I finally got a smartphone. The 6.0% may sound enticing for the low cost, but don't be as dumb as I was, please. We work hard for our money, and we would be better off spending this money on something meaningful and more entertaining, perhaps a chinese finger trap... or a decent block of cheese from the grocery store (everyone loves cheese, yeah, even you, dude who says he doesn't like cheese.)"

"I like this beer simply because it is a cheaper beer that I think tastes good I think it's kinda sweet which is what I like about it. It has a high alc volume that I like for a cheep beer and I disagree with people that say it tastes like regular bud light it does has a different flavor as far as that goes like I said it's sweeter to me anyways and has a nice volume the crown from the glass isn't huge but that's expected with this beer overall I enjoy it over other common bought beers and the glasses are cool and so are the thin cans"

"Look No offense to everyone but this is not a bad beer really. I like that it has significantly more spike then regular bud light considering bud light just seems to go thru you FAST. It's also relatively cheap and I really like the blue bottle. Honestly I feel like the people who don't like this beer obviously don't like to drink very cheap. This is a good beer for those wanting to get tipsy on a relatively low price and for the money conscience people like me. Now I will admit it's not the best tasting beer in the world but considering it only takes me two bottles to really start feeling something and that I don't have to pay too much for it. I say it is well worth it for the most part. I like stronger beers and this would be a beer I'd buy if I didn't want to spend that much money. Now for those you just HAVE to have a wonderful tasting fountain of beer this wouldn't be the beer of choice but considering I get tipsy after relatively little cash spent. I'd say it is a great beer for the money conscience people out there who only want to feel good after a hard day at work. I do like how I don't really smell the beer that much unless I stick my nose in it either which is why I give a high review on smell although"

"If nothing else, it came in a pretty cobalt blue bottle, so I may see if the art department at work can use it. Otherwise, what were they thinking? Blue allows more light penetration than any other color of glass. I had two fingers of bone-white fizzing head initially until it fizzed its way to wispiness. Color was a pale lemon-yellow (SRM = > 2, < 4) with NE-plus quality clarity, enabling me to see into the future. It looks like snow! Those of us south of US 30 are expected to get 6"" to 8"" or perhaps more. The nose had an odd Minhas-like chemical smell, like plastics and dry cleaning fluid. Fuh! Mouthfeel was thin and watery and the taste was reminiscent of the time I had trench mouth as a kid (thanks, summer camp creeps) and had to gargle with diluted hydrogen peroxide. Finish was bland. Rubbish! I am experiencing buyer's remorse."

"Pretty much tastes the same as regular Bud Light but with 6 ABV. Pours out straw yellow, and pretty flat. The aroma has a slight alcohol smell and that is about it. It really does not taste like much either. I will not buy it again because I would rather drink a hoppy IPA if I want a high alcohol percentage, but it definitely got the job done!"
""
"I was expecting a little bit more when I first tried this beer. I enjoy bud lite to an extend and was hoping this would add a little more flavor and profile than a typical bud lite. It is a little heavier but overall I thought the taste was similar to that of bud lite, wasnt a huge fan of the Platinums."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Drinkable. I have grown to be a craft beer guy so in terms of macros I was not incredibly surprised that I was not crazy about it. For a light macro its ok. I wont buy it often though."

"I prefer this to my normal bud light now. I always liked normal Budlight in the past over anything else. And now I have a new go to beer. My only reason is the 6.0 Alcohol content. To me it taste like Budlight with a kick and that's what I love. Now 2 or 3 bottles is all I need instead of 5 or 6.."

"Bud Light Platinum brewed by Anheuser-Busch with and abv of 6.0. Now first off this brew is not a light beer. The Abv to this brew is to high to be 6.0. Most American style light lagers have an abv of 4.2. This is more like an ICE Beer. Bud Light Platinum pours out of the can a nice amber color with a small white head. The smell is that of american style lager but sweeter. An you can smell the alcohol in this brew. Right off the bat you taste the 6.0 abv- but it is smooth and crisp. The fact of the matter is it drinks like a light beer,but it has a kick. This brew has more to it than Bud Light, but it not as much as Budweiser. It is right in middle of the two. I like how it is smooth ,but the alcohol taste brings this brew down. Overall, I'm giving this brew a 4 out 5. I would get this brew again."

"It's total piss water but it's my favorite piss water. It's nothing special but fills the need when I'm looking for a simple drink to enjoy. Understated but good tasting flavor. It's not something I would give a sterling recommendation of but would suggest people with a light taste give a try."

"Overall this beer is perfect if you like Bud Light and want to ""get lit quick"". It's too bad that one of the coolest bottles around has to come filled with this stuff."
""
"for a spin off of bud light, this platinum is got a little kick to it.. i do not understand that it is still labeled as a light beer because its 6.0% alcohol by volume. But other than that, the color looks like bud light, the smell is very strong of alcohol in my opinion. The taste and mouthfeel is bold,crisp,clean and very drinkable beer/malt liquor."

"Sharp and a little sweet. Cooked veggies, husky grain, fusel, and a kiss of pseudo-floral hop bite. Easy to drink. 6% might seem invasive for a Bud Light drinker, but this has a good sensibility to its strength. Has some body to work with, if not, too wooly and/or oily for an adjunct lager. Dial down the carbonation, or maybe just distribute it a bit, and you have a decent feel, strangely enough. Put-together like a science experiment, it really could be a solid go-to for pale lager drinkers."

"Overall: I give this beer a B-grade based only it’s style. Not being a fan of light beer, I happened to sample one at a family cook out. To my surprise this beer has a nice flavor. With the body of carbonated water, its too light for my taste. Although it boast 6% ABV it's  not noticed in the taste, nor body."

"Pours nicely. A little swirl leaves a nice bubbly film. Not a lot of head. Easy to drink. Nice high ABV for a light beer. Smells like a lemony kitchen. Taste is very light with a bit of citrus. Very drinkable. No depth of taste. Not complex. Taste doesn't stick around long. The thing I liked the most is it is refreshing, better than water, comes in a nice blue bottle, the cap screws off, and it is easy to feel that it has a considerable ABV."

"O- I drank this cuz my sister who doesn't like beer bought a 6-pack, drank 4 and didn't want the other 2. Would never buy this, although it's not the worst Bud offering I've had, that goes to Bud Select. About the only thing going for this is that it comes in a cool blue bottle, yay! Welp, now I guess I'll rinse my mouth out and pop open that St. Bernardus Abt 12."
""
""
""
""
"EDIT 2: The more I drink this beer the more it grows on me. It is now my go-to light beer. I'd like to see more people on here review it for its style, rather than just giving it a 2 because it's made by AB. DON'T HATE!"

"BLP literally tastes like regular Bud Light with an infused metallic taste that I couldn't shake. I have no idea how some casual drinkers find this to actually be an improvement over Bud Light or Budweiser but these people seem to think that its ABV of 6% makes it superior. They're all poor excuses for beer and BLP is probably the worst of them. Luckily I tried it for free from a friend and I would recommend absolutely not wasting your hard-earned money on this garbage."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"It IS slightly less bad than regular bud light; however, the reason for BLP is not for drinking enjoyment, it is to impress random bar skanks and give the impression you're too well off and sophisticated to be drinking regular swill like the commoners. Needs to have ""It'll getcha laid"" below the bud light logo."
""
"Pours a clear gold with a foamy bone head that settles to tiny wisps of film on top of the beer. No lacing on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, and some fruity but vegetal aromas. Taste is much the same with fruity, grassy, and corn-like flavors on the finish. There is a very mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very poor beer that is slightly better than regular Bud Light but that isn't really hard to do."

"Budweiser Light Platinum (2013) - At 6% ABV a Sam Adam's Light grade beer is expected if not more. With some 130 calories I'm saying to myself this has to have more flavor than Bud Light regular. On both counts I was wrong. A thick foamy head reduces too mild lacing. Very active carbonation. Think wheat aromas abound. Crystal clear yellow body with very wet mouthfeel. On the front of the palette there is very little taste to be had. Faint wheat and grass taste if that. Lots of water mid-palette. Very weak malt flavor. Back palette there is very faint hops and rice. I think weak Natty Ice. This is Bud Light alright and not much more. Actually it's horrible when you really think about it because as far as light beers go this has more calories than it should. Since a Guinness has less calories I'm at a loss why I'd even think to buy this over regular Bud Light since it's cheaper or Guinness since it's better tasting. Hell I could get Third Shift or Sam's Light for around the same price. If ABV is your thing-- Natural Ice or Milwaukee's Best has more taste, higher ABV, and is cheaper. So again-- what's the point. With Bud Black Crown I get it-- pay better for good Bud. But with this I don't get it. Pay more for a potent Bud Light with more calories? It's an ill place and no purpose beer. I rarely say this but 1 out of 5 stars. Pretend it's not even on the shelf."
""
"take the watery extract flavors of a bud light and add the burning stomach churning effect of grain alcohol, and you have a bud light platinum. as much as I hate the politics, marketing, and desired demographic (see my black crown review), I also hate the beer. it just tastes awful, metallic and boozy, yet somehow still diluted. its a mess from top to bottom. if it had no taste it would have a passable mouthfeel, that's about it. upbeat carbonation and a lighter body, but it cant save a beer that tastes more like a caustic chemical reaction than an honest brew for human consumption. I have no interest in ever consuming one of these again. it had the profound effect of bringing me from craving a beer badly to instantly not wanting to drink anymore, they should treat alcoholics with this wash, might turn them off too. id honestly rather drink any dirty 40 from the gas station than have another one of these. steer clear."
"A boozier marketing driven beer. What's the point."
""
""
""
"This beer is trying to be a ""real beer"". the 6% scheme is kind of a joke. This beer smells bad. like really bad. it is pretty smooth but it still tastes pretty skunky. There is no fizz to it which is weird considering Budweiser and Bud light are pretty fizzy"
"Anheiser seems to think that you can just relabel sub par beer and market it but the growing rise in micro and craft beers is finally starting to chip away at them. I hope the pace continues. because this is a less than stellar beverage and barely drinkable. I've had a bottle in the fridge for over 7 months because no one will drink it."
""
"Completely clear pale yellow with a thin white cap. Lots of effervescence. The aroma brings some grain, alcohol, not much else. The flavor is really a disappointment, even plummeting beyond my low expectations. Perhaps a redeeming quality of a macro lager with no integrity is the drinkability, especially at cold temperatures. Chasing hot wings and pizza with BMC products seems to be a lasting trend here in America, which is unfortunate. Bud Platinum, however, offers no drinkability. This beer is a headache waiting to happen, and can only be tolerated at refrigerator temperatures. Why increase the abv on a mediocre (at best) beer? Because it sells. Stupid. Avoid."
"Drinkin this shit on a metaphorically cloudy night. Out the bottle so no head, no color, aroma of faint pale malts, subtle cheap dry hop bitterness. Taste is smoother carbo than Bud Light, pretty much the same flavor as the Godhead (bud,miller,coors). I'm guessing the only things that make this beer better is the less crispy carbo and the slightly higher booze. Other than that, the brewery with its platinum bullsh, can go eat a chode."

"One finger head fades quickly. Almost totally clear yellow color. Appears very watered down. Smells like a cheap beer. Average taste. Goes down smooth but lacks any depth. Overall It's basically bud light with more alcohol in it. It tastes almost exactly the same. Good because of the extra alcohol but its still as watered down as every Budweiser beer ever."

"Tastes like the nastiest medicinal synthetic chemical I've ever imbibed. How on earth did their R&D dept let this one slide thru. I love bud light and bud light ice, but I almost hurled on first sip. Seriously??? I emptied all 6 bottles down the drain without hesitation. Even if I were soif'in' in a desert I wouldn't drink this crap."

"Overall a tasty carbonated ultra light beverage. Well recommended for those who hate the taste of beer and want to get happy rather quickly. Keep this stuff away from little kids please. I think they would guzzle it down thinking it was some type of child beverage like carbonated apple juice! The can is strange too, my son says it looks like an energy drink, tall and skinny."
""

"Atmosphere is unexciting. Washed-out hue, bubbly head, a bit over carbonated, no real lacing. Yeasty hay nose. Flavor is sourdough bread, with a bit of a soapy sweetness. Overall, this is not such a great quaff."

"Truly the lightest colored beer I've ever seen, damn near colorless. Faint whiff of diluted husky grain. Literally nothing else going on in this beer, except a light canned corn aftertaste. All marketing, and clearly it has been successful since this stuff seems to be gaining a foothold."

One should never be a big enough snob to turn down a new and free beer.While I would never purchase this it was inoffensive and I could see a lot of Bud regulars buying it for the cool looks and higher alcohol. I should also add that ""Bud Light"" and the beer being 6% is intriguing. I was able to drink two and could easily drink a few more but that does not make a beer good IMO."

"Very light but a touch of wheaty maltiness. The flavor is grainy, even slightly boozy. Maybe that's the hook. It's drinkable enough if you like this kind of stuff. But, as usual with Anheuser, Miller-Coors, SAB, In-Bev ,and all the rest-- it's all about marketing. If they could come up with a Marlborough Man for beer, it would make the advertising so much easier."
""
"Overall – I knew this was going to be bad.. but I still had to give it a try. I don't think beer will be around for much longer, I don't see the need for it."
""
""
"Overall: Crap beer, barely a step up from the typical macro-swill. A good choice if you hate all beers anyway, and liquor is too strong for you, and you don't want to buy coke to make rum-and-cokes, but you want to get drunk as fast as possible. That's about it."

"""Fancy"" Bud Light. Bud has to come up with a gimmick to make Bud Light somehow new. It is the same old beer with a little extra added alcohol and gravity. It tastes almost like malt liquor. They even package the beer in a bright blue bottle for maximum Bud Light gimmick. It will be gone soon and they'll have come up with some other way to package bud light in a way to make it cool."
"There is still a lot that this beer could do in order to score high marks, but for the style, I think this one is pretty good. Unoffensive, has some flavor, really well made."
"Overall - About what I expected, though I did think there was going to be a little more bite from the alcohol. To me, the only redeeming factor this has going for it is the incredibly beautiful cobalt blue bottle. It gives off an eye popping, trance inducing glow that's very calming. I just might hang on to it for a while. The verdict? Better than Bud Light, but nothing I'll spend my money on again."
""
"Overall:  Not a great beer.  Would not seek out.  Price point is good, $6/6 pk., but you can definitely find better options."
""
"O – This isn’t a terrible beer, but it’s not a good one either. For what a light lager is supposed to be, it almost hits the mark. However, the added alcohol generates some stronger characteristics than a light lager should have. Taste-wise, I may take this over a regular Bud Light, but in terms of drinkability, I’d probably rather have the original."
""
""
""
"I found this beer to be absolute garbage. It just feels like anheuser-bush is trying to jump on a market of high octane beers for cheap. I for one don't know why any one would like to get the jersey shore cast drunker then they already are... The beer is tasteless then it finishes with some thing in the realm of vodka. I hated ever bit off it. The only reason i didn't give it a 1 is because I'm sure Budweiser will or has made something worse."

"A bud light with a slightly better taste and a little more alcholol kick. Clear, little head but a better alternative than bud light if you can afford the extra calories and extra cost. Will drink on occasion when drinking light beer but still lacks the the taste of a Miller Light (just my personal presence). All in all not a bad beer for everyday occasions, just not up there with the special ones."
""
"The taste was so cheap tasting reminded me of camo black ice but worst."
""
"No need to comment on the mf and drinkability. This bottle is not worthy of my time and down the drain it goes. At least it was only 1 bottle that I bought."
"O- Just a waste of money!... Nothing to reccomend and zero enjoyment. This is an alcohol delivery system and nothing else."
"6% Bud Light? I can see that causing some confusion with consumers. I can't see any reason why anyone should bother with this one, don't go out of your way for it"
""
""
"This Bud Light creation was very good in my opinion. The taste was good and similar to regular Bud Light. The mouthfeel was very smooth and very easy to drink. The appearance and the bottle the beer came in was the best part of this beer. I believe Bud did a great job at coming up with a new beer."
""
"O: Not a good lager by any standard, but very good for AB."
""
"This beer is a marketing scam. Bud Light hypes up this beer to make it out to be a special edition Bud Light beer but i prefer regular Bud Light rather than this stuff. I don't know what is was about this beer but after getting all excited about the bottle and the look, its a real disappointment when you actually taste it."

"Bud Light Platinum pours a pale gold with a thick white head from a twelve ounce cobalt blue bottle. The aroma is a bit sweet and grainy. There is more flavor than I expected, apple like flavor pops out at me. Maybe a touch of alcohol even. The aftertaste is unpleasant. Not one I particularly care for, I'd avoid this one."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, sweeter than anticipated- didn't expect much, didn't get much."
"I had a bottle of this, it was pretty average for the style, the only thing going for it really is an increased abv threshold. I think for the price it isn't bad, but it really doesn't have much in the way of flavor beyond a corn pop type sweetness. I can't say it is really a flawed beer meaning having noticeable flavor deficiencies unless you consider lack of flavor one, then it is pretty bland which is why I gave it a below average score"

"I was at a 40th soiree tonight and there wan't much choice so I went with something I had not tried...the budlight platinum. The beer poured a clear solid yellow with initial fizzy head that disipated quickly and left no lace. The smell was typical of most light lager....hints of wheat and grass. The taste was a bit fuller than typical bud light which is an improvement. The mouthfeel was still lighter with big carbonation. Overall it was drinkable."
""
""
""
"I really tried to judge this beer on its own merits and not as an AB product, but even in a blind taste test this would be awful. Appearance wise, it has the typical, inoffensive pale golden color of a light lager. The smell was somewhat sweet and malty, if very faintly so. The taste is what killed it for me. Light malt-liquour is what comes to mind. Sweet, cloying, yet watery; no dimension or complexity, not even a discernible taste of malts or hops. Over carbonated and thin. I realise that ajunct light lagers have their place in the market and some are even drinkable, but this is a truly awful beer that would appeal to NO ONE. The taste would be a turn off to most light beer drinkers, I would assume. If someone is looking for a higher ABV beer to get drunk on, but doesn't want to stray from the recognised Budweiser name, then I suppose that would be the only market buying this stuff repeatedly. As for me, one bottle was plenty enough, and a second tasting holds zero appeal at all."

"Poured into a pokal glass. Pours pale gold with a two-finger length white head that dissipates at a moderate pace compared to Bud Light or Budweiser. There are a lot of tiny bubbles visible in this beer. The beer smells of grain husks, bread, and some alcohol. The taste is bready and sweet with some alcohol. The hops are very subtle. It tastes like a malt liquor with a ligher body. The body is light with strong carbonation. The carbonation is high enough to prevent any sort of aftertaste. The finish is crisp. The beer drinks very easy. Surprisingly, I find this beer to be decent for what it is. It seems like AB-Inbev is just trying to cleverly package a malt liquor and boost the sales using the Bud Light label. A light beer this is not."

"This poured out looking a lot like ginger ale... yellowish gold in color with a fizzy white head on top. The head vanishes and leaves nothing behind to look at on the glass or on top of the beer. The beer is clear and slightly bubbly. yellow water is what it honestly looks like. The smell of the beer has some aromas of light grains and corn... nothing really stands out. The taste is bland and gives off what I felt like chemical flavors or chlorine. The mouthfeel is water, thin, carbonated but just boring. Overall it's pretty bad... I can't seem to come up with a really good reason to buy this beer."
"Honestly, if you want a cheap drink & are down with this level, I'd say opt for the Cobra. It may smell worse, but it tastes better & is usually cheaper (I paid 2.29 for this; Cobra is only 20 cents more around here for a 40). First light beer review? LAST light beer review."

"I must admit that around the time of the Super Bowl last year I quickly fell prey to AB’s strong ad campaign for this new beer. Everything about it really drew me in from the blue bottle to the higher abv to the rampant commercials featuring my favorite songs. I was excited by the price and was hoping for a good beer available in six packs for the price of your average light beer. I would argue that this is a better drink than your typical Bud Light, but not remarkably so. It still has a watery, metallic taste to it, despite a slight sweetness. It’s the same yellowing-golden color as Bud Light and has a slightly thicker head which dissipates with such speed most might miss it, it also leaves no lacing. So Platinum pales in comparison to most high-class bottled beers, but the role that it fulfills as a step above your average light beer for college parties, I’d say it gets the job done. I also found that it sold very well initially, as the three liquor stores I frequent were almost always sold out of it by the weekend and the owners mentioned its popularity among everyone from young drinkers to middle-age, blue collar drinkers. The crossing of demographics is an important part of Ab’s success in much of its drinks. Finally, I will never tire of its cool blue bottle."

"AB dropped the ball on this one, I know people who buy this stuff on a regular basis and swear by it... These guys are not open minded beer drinkers; they only drink light clear American beer. To people like them I say save some cash and buy a 12pack of keystone or bud Ice for the same price as a 6er of BLP, better flavor, and the same alcohol content."

"While this is better than normal Bud Light, it's still a Bud Light. The blue bottle probably looks amazing in the clubs though."
""
""
""

""
"Either way it's just not worth the money, the headache, or the shame of buying it to experiment. Not even close."
""
"Overall: I judge a light lager on whether or not I'd want to drink a bunch of it with my friends. Bud Light Platinum is a bit too sour and is priced too high for that, but it has 1% to 2% higher ABV than most light lagers, so I could see it being an okay second or third pitcher at the bar, if it ever made it to the tap."
""
""
""
"I don't know. Temporary insanity. I am so conditioned to buy new singles at the supermarket that I don't think about the implications. Only after pouring that I even realized the bottle is blue glass like it's selling Zima or something. Can you even get Zima anymore? Anyhoo, yeah, this beer looks like apple juice, smells like nasty seltzer, and tastes like rusty carbonated water. It's terrible, but you knew that already. Just another gimmick to keep an old idea fresh for a minute."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall / Drinkability: I could not finish this because of the taste. I'm not sure what they were thinking behind this one but this is not a good lager nor is it a good beer. Appearance is probably the only thing this beer has going for it. To the best of my knowledge, the first time I was unable to finish a beer to date. I don't like to be down on beer at all, but this one is poorly put together - at least to my tastebuds anyway."

"Again, I can't help but compare this to the original. Body seems slightly fuller and more sophisticated."
"Overall this is one of the worst beers I've ever had. It's extremely hard to finish the bottle. Even the bump in ABV does not make up for it's failures."
""
""
""
"Overall - I wouldn't get this again. I don't like the alcohol taste lingering in my mouth. I guess you can't really expect a simplistic, light beer to cover up 6% ABV.. lol"
""
""
"Bottle: Poured a clear pale yellow color lager with a small bubbly head with minimal retention. Aroma consists of light sweet malt with well hidden adjunct. Taste is also dominated by sweet malt with no clearly identifiable adjunct but also very limited characteristics. Body is light with average carbonation. I actually drank this side-by-side with a regular bud light and I must say that the platinum is actually better though still quite bland in the grand scheme of things."
"This is an interesting one. The most confusing part to me is how they are able to pass this as a light beer. it only has a handful of calories less than regular Budweiser. I think it would have made more sense to simply call it 'Budweiser Platinum'. I think the main purpose was to produce a beer with a slightly boosted ABV. Because that's what it tastes like. A Bud with some more alcohol. That makes it a better choice than Bud or Bud Light if you want to get wasted. It's redeeming qualites stop there i think."
""
""
""
"Pours a pale golden color with a short lived white head. Nose reveals a striking similarity to Bud Light. Corn, sweet cereal, no hops, faint yeast, and minimal esters. Maybe not quite as watery. Flavor does have a touch of hop character, but otherwise your typical light/pale lager. Cereal and grain sweetness, mild yeast, and some water. Very high carbonation and very light body. I actually like it better than Bud Light."
""
""
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. Poured a clear pale yellow color, produces a small amount of head and no retention. Aroma of this Light Lager consists of bread and grain. Light in body, this brew has some slight grain flavor, mild hop bitterness and a warm finish. I'm not sure where AB is going with this beer, what category they are trying to fill, but i think it has less to do with beer style and more to do with trying to fill up shelf space. This will be another short lived failure by AB/INBEV."

"This is my second review of Bud Light Platinum. Comparing this to my new found love of IPA's, Let's see what we get. Poured from a mini keg into a lager glass. Pours a piss yellow with half a finger's worth of foamy head, Leaving absolutely no lacing. The smell was horrendous. Rotten corn, Vomit, and some stale rice. The taste wasn't much better. Some chemical grain, the faintest amount of malt, and perhaps some rubbing alchohol? Tasted horrendous compared to crafts. The mouthfeel was a heavy metallic flavor with even more of what seemed like burning chemicals coming through. This beer is not smooth whatsoever. Overall, This is absolute garbage, And I am glad that I had finally made the choice to start exploring REAL beer. I cannot believe I used to drink this slop and enjoy it."
""
""
"Overall: This beer has no real flavor to speak of, with a poor feel and not a great smell this beer ranks very low for me. I would rather drink Bud Light even with the lower ABV."
""
""
""

""
""
"Imagine Keystone Light, with a hint of apple juice and water from a can of canned corn. It's fizzy, forgettable, forthright fraudulent. This doesn't even go well with pizza."
""
""
""
"I can't decide whether to be amused or to be concerned that the existence of this beer is a legitimate sign that the world is ending. Regardless, I think I prefer this to Bud Light. As Bud Light is nothing short of a watery alcohol-delivery system, I guess if you're in the market for this type of beverage, you might as well go for something with 6.00% ABV."

"Well, what can I say? I was thirsty as all-get-out, and it’s hotter than a Wookiee’s temper here in Atlanta. I decided to give it a try. Guess what - it exceeded my expectations. Crisp aroma is better than what I expected. It’s called Light, but it actually smells like beer! OK, not an outstanding aroma, but at least it doesn’t smell like water. It pours a rather typical clear, wan straw yellow with not much head. Flavor is nothing special - but as I said, better than what I expected from a mega-brewed light beer. Crisp, malty with a hint of fruit. Texture is fairly fizzy, smooth, average body. For a light beer, and a megabrewed pale lager, not half bad."
""
"Overall: I actually thought I might enjoy this beer with all the hype put into it. I was disappointed with it. If I drink any thing like this, I will stick with regular Bud Light."
""
""
""

"Overall, on hot days where this is ice cold, is about the only use for it. About the same as bud light, just with more alcohol and a little sweeter."
""
""
"O=A bit better than I anticipated...no longer a fan of light beers...as lights go, this was alright if you like the heavy hops and sweetness."
"Drink it ice cold, so you numb your taste buds from the poorly laid out grains and sweet, corn-like malts. More metallic in the taste, this stuff couldn't be any more ""meh"". No alcohol taste present (6% ABV woo!) Crisp, lighter-than-light mouth feel. Stay away from this stuff, unless you're trying to hit that frat boy buzz."
"O - The bottle shore is purdy."
""
""
""
""
"If not, go get a nice stout."
"I'm surprised that this is even considered a light beer. Sure it tastes like one, but its caloric content is only about 8 calories less than a regular Budweiser. Light in taste only, and more alcoholic than a standard American macro means that this is probably meant for beer pong or something of that nature. A decent thirst quencher? Maybe, but not really a decent beer."
"Look, you know how this beer goes. Light everything, bigger alcohol. Tired of people making fun of you for drinking diet low alcohol beer? Now you're a big man, drinking 6% diet beer. oooh."
"I was at a bar and just wanted to give it a shot since I heard mixed reviews about it. Some of my college friends (who don't know good beer) said it was good. The bartender said people who like AB products don't like it. I took 1 sip of it and 1 word came to mind. YUCK!! It tasted worse then bud light. I couldn't tell if there was flavor in the beer or it was just plain alcohol. If your going to have a light beer put less alcohol in it, not more."
""
""
"Taste is sweet and sticky. Hints of fruity citrus are in there, which I'd suppose(?) is the hops, but this one seems way off balance to me. I'm trying to be fair, but this one barely feels like beer, it's so sweet. Awful, and a challenge to finish."
""
""
""
"Overall: spend the extra bucks and get yourself something real, very bland and you will find better out there. Salud."
"Pours out to a temporary thin sudsy head and ""triple filtered"" clear urine color. Aroma is grain and sweet fruit juice. Flavor is bland, grainy, cider-like and has absolutely no discernible hop features. Despite the dry feel, it tastes sweet and corny. Mouthfeel is seltzer and astringency. On the balance this beer comes off as dressed up malt liquor. There are better tasting malt liquors out there that cost less."
""
"I sense deep pilsner aromas coming from the front to back of my palate. This craft experiment has launched Anheuser-Busch into a new position in the marketplace. You can taste all of these tones in one sip. If you are looking for a session beer, look no further."

"Tried this earlier this afternoon at a crab feast on the eastern shore in MD. Remember seeing the commercials during the Super Bowl, finally get a chance to try it (woohoo). Can't say i was too impressed, I'd actually prefer a Bud Light over this one. Has a musty smell and an odd sweetness to it, awkward finish as well. An odd tasting beer, and definitely not good tasting or refreshing by any means. Comes in a fancy blue bottle and has higher ABV, but I'll pass in the future."
""
"Poured from a blue 12 oz. bottle. Has a bright yellow color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of corn,an unusual somewhat musty odor.Taste is light, a bit musty, alcohol is present, some grains. Feels light in the mouth and overall this is a mediocre beer."
""
"O: Nothing really bad, but not something I want to drink again. Not really sure why anyone would."
"If you enjoy Bud light and want to pay more, but drink less to get drunk: try this."
"P.S. I note this is a rare beer in generating BA ratings all the way from 1 to 5."

"This beer pours a clear, sparkling yellow with no head or lace. The aroma is lemons and corn. The flavor is mainly lemony with cake and sweet corn notes. It's mouthfeel is thin and it sours as it warms. Bud Light Platinum is okay in a pinch, barely recommended."

"Although not a fan of light American lagers, I'll try to be as open minded as possible. From a cobalt blue bottle, the beer is a very clear, very pale yellow color...utterly transparent. It has a white head for maybe 40 seconds, after which it is completely foam-less. The beer is less carbonated than other light lagers that I recall. It's aroma is clean, and a little fruity (surprisingly). It doesn't smell much like a beer...not much malt of hops...just some graininess and distant, undiscernible fruit. The taste is sweeter than expected as well. It's not exactly malty, but rather very sugary. No hop flavor or balance. Finish is clean, but a lingering cotton-candy-like flavor pervades the aftertaste. Light in body, but not as watery as expected. Not my kind of beer, for sure."
""
""
"Platinum? Please..very little going on here.."
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured an 1/8"" white foam head but it held a pretty good length of time and didn't seem artificially induced like the bulk mainstream stuff. The body is the standard clear pale straw yellow of BMCs. Same with the smell, the standard sort of grass and corn. And the taste, fairly watery, grass and corn, but a creamier body than the Bud Light, and a slight bitter aftertaste that reminds you it was a beer and not just a cold anything."
""
""
"A weird science experience wrought veritable. Ugh. This is the beer equivalent of that perfect Hollywood, surgically enhanced, personality-deficient starlet. Looks good, has some intangibly attractive trait, and whose attempts at edginess are calculated and cold. Funny, a Nickelback song suddenly came on the cacophony blaring from the bar across the street - ok, no more analogies. Avoid, unless you just want to get trashed, though I can't imagine the hangover possible with this."

"6.00 % abv is a light beer? Since when? Well carbonated, and light bodied. I was curious enough to try one of these, but I should have known better. Avoid at all costs."
""
""
"O: I've always wanted to give something all 1's, so here it is in all its hideous glory. Normally, this kind of score represents the absolute bottom of the barrel, and without a doubt, BL Platinum is a foulest, most disgusting beer ever to grace my palate and should be avoided by any person who may lay claim to working taste buds. Hilariously, though, this may not be the worst beer AB InBev makes...if anything, Budweiser Chelada may make me wish negative scores were possible. Simply put, the malt beverage equivalent of frontal lobotomy performed with a rusty knife."
""
""
"12 ounce bottle. Served in a nonic pint glass, the beer pours a clear straw gold color with a half inch white head that fizzled away quickly. There's a small amount of lacing left on the glass. Aroma is bready malt/grain, sweet malt and some vegetables/corn/adjuncts. Taste is similar to the aroma, but the vegetable/creamed corn flavor is stronger. Ugh, not good so far. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, it's a bit slick with low/moderate carbonation. It just seems to get worse the longer I drink it. The only bright sides to this brew is that the mouthfeel isn't bad, and that the 6% ABV isn't very noticeable. Bought this as a single at Liquor Barn. I won't be trying this again anytime soon. Give me a regular Bud Light any day over this, I'm not joking."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a pale yellow, very fizzy and settles quick with no head or lacing. The scent of rice, grain and a sweet note come from this beer. I felt it has a very limited flavor, it almost seems to taste like it's high alcohol cousin Bud Ice. It carries a smooth feel with a heavy carbonation. Overall I felt the concept of this beer was to produce a high alcohol Bud Light to get you drunk quicker. I wouldn't recommend this unless you want to get smashed fast without spending a lot."
""
""
"OVERALL: Imagine the palest maibock in the world devoid of all traditional flavors. Take this and add sugar and rice, and you have the platinum. Swill that will surely catch some amateurs off guard. Avoid this beverage if you can, otherwise you will be engulfing sub par quaffs."

"Bud Light Platinum cannot be judged as a craft beer because it's not and it's not trying to be. What it is trying to be is a high alcohol content light American lager with mass appeal. In this, they have succeeded. It's a approachable beer that requires less work to get drunk (and I think that's the whole point). It has most of the distinguishing characteristics of regular Bud Light; refreshing smell, crystal clear and fizzy, faded gold color. The higher alcohol content is masked by a sweetness that is muted and vague but surprisingly pleasant. If I ever find myself at a frat party again, however unlikely that may be, I just might bring this one along."

"O- an improvement from bud light, but that's also not saying a lot. Won't seek it out but could drink it if it was available."
""
"Overall: Not bad. Budweiser has hit a home run with this product I think, for it does precisely what (some) consumers want: Deliver an assload of alcohol in a light, inoffensive, and even trendy-wicked-cool package. Touché, Inbev."
""
"I'm fairly certain I just developed diabetes (types 1 AND 2), ALS, and AIDS, and possibly chlamydia."
""
"Although Dos Equis is not the greated beer, I will paraphrase The World's Most Interesting Man, ""I'm sorry, you lost me at 'Budweiser'"". Honestly, this beer serves no purpose to anyone who understands beer. Maybe this one would do well on ""beershitvocate.com"""
"O: I'm not really sure where this beer fits in the scheme of things.  I get that the point was to make a higher ABV bud light, but this seems to accentuate the negative qualities of both light beer and higher ABV beer.  It has the flavor profile of a heavy light adjunct lager, with the drinkability of a thicker, bad, high ABV beer.  If the goal is 'beer to get you drunk', it doesn't really work since the drinkability is so low. I could easily drink multiple coors lights before I would drink one of these.  If the goal was to make a more flavorful light beer, again it misses the mark as it does have MORE flavor, but the flavor is just plain bad.  This is a complete miss for me, and something I do think I would ever buy, no matter what the occasion.  "

"It tastes good and gets you hammered quickly. Any other qualities aside, what else constitutes a good beer? Get over yourself. It's an American beer that puts the desired effect above complex snobby flavors. It is what it is. Good for beer pong and getting lucky on a week night. Unpretentious and gets the job done."
"Overall - This has to be the hands down selection between light beers and even compared to ""heavy"" beers or craft selections depending on what the affair is. A magnificent middle ground is found between the higher alcohol content common with craft beers or even other types of alcohol while still remaining ""light", crisp, and fortifying. The ideal beer for any occasion."

"I predict it will be a fart in the pan like lots of other Bud products. Wish they would trade it for Bud Dry Reprise. Of course, I may have been too young to know that Bud Dry was just another crappy macro the last time it was available!"
"I really like it!"

"Mehhh.... as expected, this beer sucks. I guess I would call it better than regular bud lite, but then regular BL is one the nastiest beers on the planet. One and done for me..."
"Overall: If I could go back in time and have the money I'd only play beer pong with this beer. It really hides the 6.0% very well."
""
""
"Honestly, it doesnt taste offensive at first, but it develops into something awful. the extra malt just adds the same malt flavors, but just more of them. Feels light and crisp."
""
""
"D - So, despite the incredibly upscale packaging this pretty much tastes like Bud Light with some nutrasweet in it. In fact, I am pretty sure I just cracked the secret of Bud Light Platinum, time to stake out the local AB brewery and try to get a picture of the truck delivering loads of fake sugar."
""
""
""
""
"Finishes like sour milk, very gross. It gives me gas and a headache. I can't stand it."
"O- you could do a lot worse for a light lager. The alcohol is hidden very well. For what it is, it's excellent"
""
"O: Well, I'm trying to be objective here. I gave it low scores, but it's not horrible. It doesn't taste like hot trash. It didn't give me herpes (yet). It just has almost no aroma or taste, so how can I give it much of a score? Basically some mild adjuncts and cereal grain and that is it. It is drinkable, of course. Why wouldn't it be, it's not really all that far from water. What's more drinkable than water? If I had no other options and I wanted to get drunk quickly and easily, why not pick this beer?"
""
""
"I recommend it but beer snobs will more than likely diss it as it is not complex or a micro brew."
""
"Overall - This is an insult to the word ""beer"". You see.... beer should be a wonderful thing, not an ugly abomination like this. I'm going to sum it up in one phrase directed at Anheuser-Busch ""This beer is bad and you should feel bad!"""
""
""
"Snappy blue bottle. Pours clear pale yellow with a fizzy finger of foam that persists. Smell is breads and grains. Taste reminded me immedately of a sort of lightweight champale. Maybe a low sugar moscato. I only get the faintest hint of 'beer' taste. It's mildly sweet, fizzy, grainy. You can detect the bud light family genes as well. We worked our way through half a twelve pack. After drinking several from the bottle, one from a glass, my brother Chris added half a bottle to some orange juice and stated that it made a passably decent mimosa. I'm sure people that dislike the beer flavor of beer will really go for Platinum."
"A cold one on a hot day would be fine, but I like the taste of beer and therefore would pass on this."
""
""
"This particular brew is uneventful. Slightly sweeter mouthfeel than the original Bud Light, and has a sharper acidity. It is not a bad beer, but the smell is reminiscent of bad, stale bread. I would try it once to get it out of your system, then to other brews it is..."
""
""
"I would say its not an improvement over Bud Light but its definitely stronger. I'll be enjoying that later tonight at Lazer Tag."
""
"T: Again, the sweetness is a bit much with nothing else in there to stand up to it. Some boiled corn, grain and bready yeast on the finish that grows as it warms. This is far from being the worst thing out there, but it's still not good."
""
""
""
"O/D-Thought it would be worse but it still blew."
""
""
"Overall: It's bad when a beer makes you want a Bud Light."
""
""
""
""
"Anheuser-Bush sure can market a product! This beer accomplishes the goal of what I believe many of the drinkers who buy this product want to accomplish, get a buzz faster. I was suckered into purchasing this beer from the marketing campaign and the electric blue bottle. This beer tastes much like its Bud Light roots a rice/corn blended taste with an almost malt-liquor mouth feel. Many people who enjoy Bud Light will probably enjoy this as well."
"O: I find Coors to be better than Budweiser in general because I get a nasty aftertaste in AB products. This however, was actually quite clean and crisp. Given the choice, this trumps regular BL. Pretty drinkable actually, and not terrible as it warms."
"overall a disappointment, and i wasn't expecting much. i hope my wife wants to drink the rest of six pack."
""
"Tasted similar, more apple and soggy graininess. It has a touch more malt flavor than standard issue Bud Light. Mild taste, flaccid feel, utterly dull and insipid flavor wise. Biting astringent carbonation, watery aftertaste. Pretty much bullshit any way you slice it... whee, liquid garbage."
""
"Really not much to say that I'm sure hasn't been said already. No real appearance to speak of. Not really any smell or taste that I'm guessing was the intention. Overall really just a alcohol delivery device. And I'm my opinion not a very good one. Bourbon works faster and taste better in my opinion."
"Overall, this beer is not good. I got this beer from a party where the buyer (not me) didn't want it (I wonder why), so I took it home. Six free beers, why not? For the price I have seen this selling for, no way. If I'm going macro, give me Busch Light, Coors, or Natty."

"I picked up a 12 pack in bottles because I was curious about Bud coming out with a 6% abv AND they offered a $4.00 rebate. I thought, I'll give it try for $8.00 since it's the holidays and I like to keep a few lite fizzy beers on hand for my family. In a word...terrible. It has no smell, taste, mouthfeel, lacing or head. I can honestly say that I would never recommend this beer to anyone."
"Note: As far as macro beers go, I actually do like Bud products. I am glad I tried this but it probably would not be something I would get again. If I had a choice between this and Bud Light I would take the regular Bud Light."
""
"Wow, just wow! Let's take a bad product increase the strength but make it taste worse. I think they've done that. It was fizzy, yellow and clear. Smells like....nothing. Corn, maybe? It tasted like corn and water. Mouthfeel is fizzy and highly carbonated. Overall, this is just as bad if not worse than Bud Light. Simply amazing."
""
"O- I've certainly had worse beers but I won't have this one again any time soon. Thanks to my trading partner I won't have to waste money on my own 6pk."
"Overall Drinkability: Pretty awful, but it is a novelty. Not worth it though."
""
"Just bought my first pack of this. The 6.0% alcohol caught my attention on the commercials but overall this beer is pretty disappointing. Less taste than Bud Light but more alcohol... interesting. You can really taste the booze in this, it's almost like a weak mixed drink. No real beer taste tho. Disappointing."
""
""
""
""
""
"Worse than Bud Light. Better than Bud Light Chelada. There you have it."
"O: Well, it's better than plain Bud Light. It's got that going for it...which is nice."
""
""
""
"A half finger head forms. The smell is of barely. Taste is sweeter than bud light with a less bitter aftertaste.The beer tastes and looks watered down but really its just lack of hop flavoring. Far more watered down than its non-light version just like bud light."
""
"Light malt sweetness up front. Some honey, but turns to sugar-dusted corn cereal pretty quick. Light graininess near the finish, along with a hint of ethanol and a blip of peppery hops. Light-bodied, with a fizzy, soda-y feel. Corny overall. I don't really understand why this beer exists (marketing and niche wise--light malt liquor might be a better ""style""), and I also don't understand why anyone would try it again. Not terrible, but not good."
""
"Finish - Clean, crisp, refreshing, dry."
""
"O: It's kind of bad... I think I prefer a normal bud light, this is just too sweet for my taste."
""
"Another swing and a miss. Now to decide to pour it down my throat or the sink...."
""
"Overall: i would drink this over bud light. Would use as the foil in a mystery cooler."
"D - Hot day, or a quick buzz, not a bad option for ABV and lightness."
""
""
"What the hell were they thinking. This is one of the worst beers I have ever tasted. Fire the brewmaster and the idiots who approved this mess.I brewed an IPA and on my first shot it wasn't bad but I don't know what the hell they were trying to do with this one."
""
""
"It's flavor profile is incredibly light and is dominated by that apple-like off flavor. I didn't have high expectations so I won't say I'm disappointed. I'll be passing on this in the future."
""
""
"O. Not the worst light beer Ive ever had, it must be because of the citrus overtones this one peresents. If I wanted to do nothing but get drunk, this would be akin to a malt liquor minus the malt. I will not purchase this beer, and am glad my neighbor gave me one to come to this conclusion."
""
""
"as far as light lagers go, this really isnt bad. bud light is prolly my favorite out of all the macro light lagers, but thats not saying much as its one of my least favorite styles. this is hardly any different than regular bud light, maybe the slightest bit more taste, but still not something i would ever buy and even avoid drinking if it was free. and i really dont understand the whole concept behind this beer, all i can make of it is a ploy to alcoholics."
""
"O: pretty much what I expected. Meh."
""
""
""
"O - Why did I do this? Oh well, at least now I know I won't have to worry about ticking this any longer. Below average light lager."
"O - It's a good idea for people who like light beer and want to get drunk, but for those of us who actually have taste buds and a functioning brain, I'd definitely avoid this beer."
""
""
"Overall – This is actually much more flavorful then the average light beer and its mouthfeel blows the normal light beer out of the water. It still is very one dimensional however with its taste consists nearly entirely of corn. Better than the average light beer, that is for sure, but not something to pine for."
"Poured into glass it looks like its counter parts, but very carbonated. Smell was like Bud but with a little bit more behind the smell maybe an extra sniff of hops, it taste pretty good to me it is very smooth and easy to drink. Overall I think its one of Anheuser-Busch's coolest creation lately I mean more alcohol than bud and less calories I mean can't go wrong there."
""
""
""
"Didn't know what to expect when I was about to try this. Certainly has a unique bottle that stands out. I actually didn't mind this. They bumped it up to a 6.0% which I thought was smart. Went down alot easier than I anticipated which could be trouble for people who throw back a lot at a time. Pretty smooth bitter aftertaste. Wasn't too high on the smell but overall didn't mind it."
"overall - whats the point of this beer? its bud light with a higher abv"
""
"O- If I wanted to get hammered this would be easy to do it with. Has little flavor and is extremely easy to drink, however if I want to enjoy a cheap beer then this isn't it. This gimmick of a beer is definitely the 6% abv and that its ""platinum""."
""
"O - good college dorm room beer, I'm sure it'll be a big hit in that age bracket... for beer enthusiasts though, it's probably not even worth trying, honestly..."
""
""
" Not sure if this is really beer just diluted alcohol, begs for a twist of lime or something to give it more flavor."
""
""
"Pours out a light yellow straw hue with a thick foamy white head that quickly disappears. Very little retention, no lacing and high carbonation. Can hardly smell anything in this beer, even though I get hints of the typical old corn and old rice smell of the typical american light beer. The taste starts out with some rice, some sweet syrups, followed by alcohol and finishes off with hints of sweet malts. If there is any hops in this, I can't taste them. The mouthfeel is a very light bodied and watered down beer that is smooth and easy to drink. This beer is good if you want a light beer to try to get drunk off of and don't care for taste, but if you care about taste and quality this beer is not for you and it is not for me."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this beer is designed to pack more punch than your average light beer all the while delivering the same llittle flavor. The scientists at AB have successfully done this for those beer drinkers who hate the taste of beer."
"O - You can't taste the additional alcohol (6% vs 4.5%) but I would take a normal BL over this any day"
""
""
""
"My advice - if you want a decent light beer, spend a couple extra bucks and pick up some Sam Adams Light."
""
"O- Overall, this is definitely a step up from Bud Light in the flavor department but lacks in the drinkability department due to the higher ABV. I would definitely take this over a Bud Light, but it is not something I would buy on a regular basis especially if there is a better craft option available."
"Let me start by saying I sampled one of these after trying a Southern Tier Choklat. This high ABV Bud is very similar to Bud Light but you get more alcohol and well disguised to boot. I really don't taste anything bad, different etc. from any other BMC Light products. If you want the mediocre flavors of a BMC but don't want to down a 6 pack before you get a buzz...then this is your beer. Nothing good/nothing bad...enjoy!"
""
""
""
"Still, not a beer I'll be drinking again. Way too much alcohol and too little flavor. You're better off with some Malt Liquor."
"Overall - It's better than bud light, and the flavor really isn't all that bad for what this is. I don't get the corn/adjunct flavors in this at all, it's actually quite light and crisp, and the flavors are definitely pear and apple - but again they are Very light. Ultra drinkable, almost goes down like water. If you want a cheap, lo-cal buzz that has very light crisp apple n biscuits flavor, then try this."
"I only paid $5.99 for the sixer but nonetheless I still felt overcharged. This ""beer"" is only good for people who want to catch a quick buzz and not really savor a good brew."
""
"12oz blue bottle, pours extra pale with a white, fizzy head that dissipates to nothing in a minute or so. It's paler than I expected, but the clarity is stunning. Aromas are weak with some corn & grain. Tastes are weak and watery, not much more in flavor compared to it's original, Bud Light. Mild grain, cereal, and a sugary sweetness are about it here. It's sweeter than Bud Light and the extra alcohol leaves a slight prickle on the tongue. Mouth-feel is thin and highly carbonated; it does go down smoothly though. Overall, I guess I was hoping for more here with the sleek packaging and extra ABV, even though expectations were set low to begin with. Glad a friend bought this for me. Not worth buying yourself."
"I'd love to say that it tastes nasty, offensive or terrible, but the truth is that it really doesn't have a taste. It's like bubbly water with some corn extract flavor. I've had worse tasting beers, but at least they tasted like beer. This is nothing. Not worth the time at all."
""
""
"O- Sucks, not worth the money, sweet water...Me and my friend decided ti see what is about and were disappointed...time for something good..."
""
"The body, as expected, was very thin and watery and had a high level of carbonation. The beer was smoothly drinkable, but why would you want to drink several of these? Overall, pretty much you'd expect from this beer. I was surprised to learn that this beer was 6% ABV however. I suspect that Inbev hit their target when they made this brew, but there's really not much for a craft beer lover to like about this offering. I drank it so you don't have to."
""
""
"Overall if offered again (usually when the good stuff is gone) it's perfectly drinkable. Not something I would buy even if it was cheap as hell."
"O Bought a sixer for 6.99 to give it a try, won't buy it again. It is too bland for my tastes. Would drink Bud Ice over this. The blue bottles are cool though."
"The look smell and taste are to be expected. It's a bud light with slightly more malt and an ever so slight hop characteristic. It is the perfect beer for a weekday afternoon. I'll save the la fin du monde for the weekends."
"Twist off bottle and into a Coors shaker glass (I like a little rivalry). Wow does this stink. Sweet and boozy like a Hurricane. Who pours malt liquor unless for a dead homie? But this isn't supposed to be a malt liquor, right? Tastes very sweet and corny. Like...you guessed it, a watered down Hurricane. It's not bad for what it is: A beer for people that don't like beer and want to get tanked quicker. If you're in this category just stick with the Jungle Juice."
""
""
""
"I really don't understand the point of this beer. If someone wants a heavier Bud Light then, well, try a Bud."
""
"D: There isn’t much flavor to it, goes down very easily and not filling at all since there's not much substance to the beer, mild kick, I’m not really picking up much of any difference between this and the regular Bud Light."
"Smells like bud light spiked with a nice single malt Scotch. Taste like it smells. Cheap and tawdry. The way they souped it up during the Superbowl, I was anticipating a serious attempt at a respectable beer. Could have been brewed in a prison toilet..."
""
"Overall: This is disappointing. Even as a light lager this leaves a lot to be desired. There was a great deal of hype building up to this product being released but for me I won't be having this again. AB offers other light lagers that more pleasing than this one."
"If you're out on the town and bro-ing it up, then I guess this stuff would be perfect. It goes down pretty easy and gets you drunk faster without having to pee as much as you would if you were drinking regular Bud Light. With enough of this beer, you'll be hitting on sorostitutes in no time at all!"
"O-If you wanted beer with flavor you shouldn't even consider this, but for the style it is better than some it is only for someone looking for some cheap BMC. Very tough to rate, style wise I would say 3 across the board average run of the mill light, as a beer probably 1s across the board, so I tried to grade a little more towards style. It is just another way for BMC to get more shelf space, they are definitely in the business to make money not beer"
""
""
""
"D- No, I dont recommend this beer. Its a novelty act for a company trying to make more billions. It wasn't as offensive as Bud Light Lime, which isn't saying much but this was just not good."
""
""
""
"O - This was just a bland beer overall. It was so heavily and unnaturally carbonated that it gave me a bit of a stomach ache. A very tough beer to drink, luckily my kitchen drain gladly accepted the final 6 oz. Nice try AB..."
""
""
"Pours a clear, straw color. 1/4 inch head of a white color. Slight Retention and poor lacing. Smells of citrus hops, slight alcohol, hint of pale malt, rice, and a hint of sweet malt. Fits the style of a Light Lager. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of citrus hops, pale malt, slight alcohol, slight metallic, and rice. Overall, weak in appearance, aroma, and body. Blend and feel are the best qualities."
""
"Feels thin, but with mild alcohol warmth. Pretty much a BL on roids, but still doesn't give off the overall Budweiser feel, even though this one has more alcohol."
"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a pint glass. Pours a transparent, third to fourth piss of the night yellow. It has a 1"" dish soap white head. No lacing to speak of. The smell is corn, sweet. Just like original bud light. Taste ... Hmmm. Corn, sweet bread. Almost like those Hawaiian dinner rolls. Adequate carbonation. I can't really say that I prefer platinum over any of their other products. A little more alcohol and 8 less calories. I guess that's what makes this attractive to some. Glad I got it in a mix 6 and didn't have to buy 6 of these."
"But, I hope you enjoyed learning about Platinum! Thanks, Wikipedia!"
""
""
""
""
""
"It's basically a light malt liquor. Lacking any real malt flavor and the cloying character it less resembles a beer and more of a very watered down cheap whiskey. There are clearly better light beers out there if you are into that. Now we all just have to wait for the half dozen fruit varieties that will follow it is does well."
""
"o- ok I guess for what it is, I got it as a mystery beer at a bar that usually has good mystery beers so I wasn't happy."
""
"O - Bud Light Platinum: More alcohol, same drinkability! I can see what AB is doing here... I can't say I'm interested in ever having this beer again but, honestly, once the aroma disappears, [1) which doesn't take long to wait for and 2) how many people will drink it from anything but the bottle?] this beer isn't offensive in the least."
"O: Gonna give this one a 3 because it's pretty above average for a A-B AAL, but expensive. Would I pay a premium again for another sixer? Nah. It's only good for the style and I'm not into that style anymore, so it's not for me. I can drink it, but other than the nostalgia aspect, it's not enjoyable, but there isn't much to dislike either. It's made for the masses, so there's nothing offensive or niche about it, it's just a slightly beefed up, middle of the road, Bud Light beer."
"O - Pure curiosity and marketing got me to purchase one bottle. I will not buy again."
"O: A great beer for non-beer drinkers. Nothing in this beer is imposing except for the sweetness. Not a quality I like, but many others might. The more I drink it the more the sweetness overpowers making it a rough session beer imo. If there was a category for chick beers this one would top the list."
"12oz. bottle: A friend felt compelled to buy a 6 after the Superbowl and gave me one to try. This one pours a very pale, clear yellow color. There was a good deal of a white head on it, but alas it did not linger or leave any lacing. Light aroma. A bit grainy, maybe some floral but nothing else. Taste is thin and watery. Can taste a touch of an adjunct (corn?) and a hint of sweetness. At 6% you might expect some flavor, but then it wouldn’t be a light beer. It’s just an alcohol delivery device with a big ad campaign."
"It will probably get some mileage in the cities, but like BL Wheat, it will likely disappear into A-B history."
"O - a bit better than BL and the boost in abv makes it more fun."
""
""
""
"This is pretty much like Bud Light with extra ABV. Taste is much sweeter. The mouthfeel is less carbonated so its a little smoother. It kind of smells unpleasant, like a sulfur scent. Th apperance is your typical AAL. If you want a decent beer to get obliterated on.. this is it."
"typical of the style, clear and lightly tan, I'm giving it a staight up average rating. I was expecting crap, but it wasn't that bad at all. Grainy and sweet, but with a slightly dry finish. Good enough for my expecting terrible. Better than typical for the brewery, that's for sure."
"O- With 7 less calories than a Budweiser, and a whole % more in ABV, I suppose it is well deserving of the Bud Light title. Still, it's just a boring American swill lager. I'll get drunk tonight either way. Boy, I shouldn't have bought a 12 pack..."
"Overall, this is a light beer trying to be a malt liquor, or a malt liquor trying to be a light beer. Identity crisis? Yes! A-B should put it in tall cans and 40s and call it a day."
""
""
""
"Overall I think that this beer will work out well. Personally I think that it tastes different than BUD ICE, althought similar in ABV. I think I like it because to me BL is a go to beer for chugging and now that its lower carbonation it will make that easier. And the added alcohol is a bonus for the purpose this beer serves for me."
""
"I suppose it's a wash since I poured out a little of my BLP for my homies who are no longer with me."
"Overall: Not worth a try. Bud Light with more alcohol and sweetness. Ugh."
""
""
"O- I enjoyed it and I'll probably buy it again. Will I put it on my next beer list? nah, not for awhile. But I'm sure someday I'll want something light and refreshing, and it'll be this."
"Been waiting with baited breath for this randomness to come out. Call it a ticker's curiosity. It pours a clear straw topped by a finger or so of white foam. The nose is faint, with undertones of corn syrup, light grass, light sweet flowers, and mild wheat. The taste is a blast of corn syrup sweetness, with some grains hidden behind. A touch of sweetgrass flares up as well. The body is a light-leaning medium, with a moderate carbonation and a lightly syrupy feel. Overall, this honestly ain't as bad as it initially sounded. Frankly, I'd take this over a normal Bud Light any day..."
""
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into pint glass likely fresh. This pours a straw color with a decent white head high bubbling carbonation. The smell is as expected, adjunct, sweet malts, no real hop presence. The feel is light, taste is similar to regular bud, nice marketing ploy though."
""
""
""
"O: COMPLETE FAIL. I can tolerate bud light. Can't tolerate this one even though I want to at 6.0 abv."
""
"Surprisingly, I'm not too terribly off put with this beer. It's probably because there actually has to be a taste present in order to critique negativley. There's just no 'there' there."
"Pours a very pale yellow color almost like it is a glass of tainted water. A slight head but it disappears quickly. Not too strong of a scent, mostly just hints of cheap earthy grains. The taste isn't too bad. It has a sweet, easy, drinkable texture. Only a slight reminisce of beer in the after taste. Definitely would take this over a Bud Light or MGD 64."
"From a bottle stamped 12015BK83. Sampled on January 31, 2012. The pour was pale yellow with a short lived fizzy white head. The aroma was better than most lights with a decent combination of grains, malts, sugars, and a clean hop note. The body fell in the medium range but also had a smooth creamy character. The taste was also on the grainy side with a clean hop bite and something almost fruity. A light beer with 6% ABV. This is better than some folks give it credit for."
""
"Calories=137. Carbohydrates=4.4 grams. 6.0% ALC./VOL. As a type 2 diabetic who still loves to drink beer this offers a decent alternative to most low carb options. It is very crisp with some more flavor than most low carb beers. Still very light though. The alcohol content is surprising as it doesn't taste much like an ice beer or high gravity lager. It is light years from my unfortunately now rare passion Duvel. But it does offers a lot more in many ways to those of us who must watch carbs for health reasons. Considering that Bud Light is the #1 selling beer, my guess is that Platinum will be a huge marketing success for AB-InBev."
"The mouthfeel feels somewhat lively on the tongue, but the beer is slick and thin on the swallow. Below average, but not a disaster. Overall, this is a below average adjunct lager. It's diet malt liquor. Does this taste better than Bud Light? I guess, sure, because it has a taste."
"Marketing, marketing, marketing, cool blue bottles Bud Light with a bit more alcohol and flavor not just premium but platinum. Pours a fizzy yellow bright golden color with white head dwindling quickly. Aroma has some green apple notes with a faint slightly metallic note with cooked veggies and cereal grains. This is like putting a tuxedo on a malt liquor. Flavor has the sweetness, like sweet creamed corn notes and a touch of rough alcohol herbal hops. Juicy fruit and sweet malts defines this beer pretty much. Sweet even cloyingly so brings beer to a new level of mass production and acceptable sweetness levels. Overall a beer I will drink with friends who buy this but I won't be spending 11.99 on a 12 pack again, although my wife seems to enjoy the effects of a beer that drinks just as easy as Bud Light but has the full alcohol level of 6% abv."

"Well, well, well, lets see here, pours a straw golden diet gingerale with a frothy 1/2 finger foam head that lays atop the beer nicely for most of the time. Grainy smells of corn and grass come through mixed with a slight rubbing alcohol touch, oddly not offensive in anyway. Ah, the taste, rubbing alcohol feel without the burn, corn, old stagnant water with some hand sanitizer dripped into it...weird tasting shit. Mouthfeel; well its light, real light, very light....not much body or balance to this what so ever. Come together now folks, now i dont quite understand why this beer exists, and i hope soon it doesnt, but it does and right now im drinking it. It has no smell, no taste, and no feel to it, its just all around a bud light with some hand sanitizer in it."
"O-very average. better than BL. about equal with bud, but i would probably pick a normal bud."
""
"O- Although I prefer it to bud light but I will won't be touching this beer again. I gave it a shot and it doesn't compare to some of the better light adjunct lagers out there."
""
"O - Really awful. I imagine their thought process being, ""Oh crap, you can almost taste the alcohol. We better make it overpoweringly sweet to hide that."" If given the choice between this and bud light, I'll take the bud light. Actually, I can't think of anything I would choose this over (except maybe Wild Blue). Unless you're just looking to get drunk with a few less bottles, don't waste your money on this one."
""
"O - Overall this is terrible. Budweiser is a thousand times better, and Bud Light is even preferable. In fact, I'd take a Bud Light Lime over this garbage. The beer loses that ""Crisp clean"" aroma and taste that cheap adjunct lagers depend on, which makes the beers immensely less refreshing, which is supposed to be its top selling point."
"Much better than Bud Light, I could see getting this from time to time instead of a Coors Light or similar."

"O- Good replacement for bud light at a party at 6.0% alc"
"RJT"

"O - This one seems more flavor less than the regular for some reason. This is too easy drinking."
"Malt liquor has an extremely offensive taste to me. This beer has a mild malt liquor taste. If it were a malt liquor, it would be the best I've ever had. I've had a lot worse beers, but this is still bad. For a cheap 6.0 abv beer, this isn't too horrible."
"Overall: Not my favorite, but it is definitely something I can see myself drinking on the back porch with a few friends in the future. It has a decent flavor and packs a solid punch for a light beer."

"Drinkablity, for me, is zero. I will never drink this beer again. If I was a Light Beer aficionado I’d probably be all over BLP. The average Joey Suitcase thinks 6% ABV is robust. It’s not, Sally. Overall, BLP is a novelty and two years from now this beer will be no more than a memory a la Anheuser World Select. Remember that dandy? BLP is forgettable and while not terrible it is… um… what was I talking about?"
""
"O: This beer was better than I expected and I think that it'll pull some Miller Light, Coors Light, and Molson XXX drinkers to bud."
"overall, a very smooth lager that is extremely easy to drink. I would never seek this style out, but in fairness there are no offensive or off flavors."
""
"Has a touch going on more than most light beers, not terrible, has a bit of an odd finish. They really succeeded at making a strong beer with almost no beer flavor."
"D/O- Drinkable, but I don't think its going to stick around long. I can hear it now: ""Hey look a new Bud Light. I'm going to try it."" One and done. It's similar enough that some Bud drinkers may take a liking to it but not enough to have it stay around more than a year or two."
"This is a party beer or a social lubricant when you want to get drunk or someone else drunk quickly."
"Comes in a blue bottle. The bottle and labeling were quite nice. Anyway, poured to about a one inch head. Head didnt hang around very long. Not much lacing, if any. Very white in color. Brew itself was a very light pale yellow. Smelled very light. Just notes of sweetness. Maybe a little fruity. Tasted a little on the sweet side. Also notes of fruit. Maybe apple. Actually tasted good. This brew is suppose to be 6%. No alcohol could be detected. Felt good in the mouth. I thought the carbonation was about right. Ill buy a sixer when this brew hits the stores. Id love to drink a sixer to see if its actually 6%."
"Overall: This is slightly better than bud light but still not really worth drinking"
