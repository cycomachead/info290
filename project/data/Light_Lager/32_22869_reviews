"Still, Beck's Premier Light's mildness and hoppy nose are refreshing enough to recommend it to those of us who enjoy sipping very light lagers on hot summer evenings. The beer is above-average as far as very light lagers go, and as long as you don't let the nose fool you, you won't be disappointed."

"No real head to speak of on a straw clear body. Aroma is very mild and is your typical light pale hopless malt nose. Flavor is watery with pale malts and slight bitterness showing up in the finish. Super light body and high carbonation and as refreshing as water. Overall low expectations for which I wasn't surprised or disappointed in the outcome."

"Becks Light is not a very good off shoot of Becks regular...the beer pours golden clear with decent head and corbonation to start, both which fade rapidly. The smell is grain/barley and pilsner hops. The taste is sharp, pilsner hops strike first, then a slight balance of malt, the aftertaste is bitter. The mouthfeel is lacking because of the very light body, which is good if it is a hot afternoon. Overall it is a better than bud light...average beer."
"O: It's a light beer; what can one honestly expect? I suppose it might not be all that bad after a day of hard labor, but even then I think I'd stick with something a little more substantial."
"Pours a clear and very pale golden color. There is only bits of a head to it. Scent is that of cheap grassy grains. The taste at least has some flavor to it but not very much. The taste is very grassy and drinks like water. No texture at all and essentially drinks like beer flavored water. The only thing this beer has going for it is that at least it's better than MGD 64."
"Overall - I don't want to punish this beer for being of a style I don't much care for. I want to punish it for being quite bad. In short, it stinks and fails to taste like beer."
"12 oz bottle. Pale-straw hue with no head or lacing. Aroma is of apple juice, while body is of Sprite. The brew definitely has a taste because it differs from water. Quite a disgusting drink. Easily it is the worst beer I have ever tried. At least I did not buy it."
"Pours a pale yellow color, some carbonation, with a small fizzy white head. The nose is grainy, and grassy. The taste is slightly sweet, grainy, and ricy. Light Body, not much going on with this one. Another pretty poor try at a beer, was a drain pour."
"The pour was about what I would have expected with a thin amber color to it if you could really call it amber in any way. Lots of fizzy white foam coming up through the bottom of the glass, and reach about an inch before dropping back down and not leaving any bit of lacing what so ever. Aroma is light grains, musky and full of moldy, bready notes. Nothing you would really want to go around bragging about in any way. Clean and crisp, it made for a good water substitute, but again that was about it as it really just had very little flavor to it at all. Wet hay maybe and a light touch of corn, but nothing really."
"From a bottle marked: 09.2007-L25669M. I did not look at the date when I bought it. It was in a closeout rack. Now I know why. Still, it pours a very carbonated yellow like it should. The aroma has a skunky maltiness to it but nothing special. The mouthfeel is like water and the taste is bready and grainy. A typical LA."
"Overall I'd imagine there would be better choices than this."
"Foamy white two finger head that dissipated in seconds, leaving little cling lace. Color is a 4 on the SRM beer color chart. Smell is a harsh wet corn and malt. Taste is really bad, flavors of wet grain and skunk. I think I run into a bad bottle and will rate again later. Mouthfeel is very watery. I think I could have another if I were really drunk, but I will not have another until I re rate."
"Pours a very light straw color with a moderate white head. Nose is quite faint with some miniscule amount of grassy, floral hops in the background alongside a faint grain presence. Grassy and grainy flavors dominate what is a really, really faint body--you can really tell from the taste that not much went into this brew. Feel is light and prickly. Goes down quite smoothly, and is better than its American comparisons in that it actually would be preferable to carbonated water, at least for me."
"Drinkability - as with most light beers, you could keep going back to this one in the fridge as much as you want, because the taste and filling quality just isn't there, nor is any kind of complexity. A little better than most light beers I've tried."
"The beer pours a very light yellow color with a white head. The aroma is terrible. I get a lot of corn and something that smells like an ashtray. The flavor is just as bad if not worse. Heavy on the adjuncts with no hops at all. Light mouthfeel and medium carbonation. Absolutely awful."
"MF&D - Watery and lacking any real flavor or characther. I guess it is what it is. Even if your trying to be good while dieting, I'm sure there are better options out there."
"You could certainly suck down a lot of these quickly due to the thin mouthfeel, low ABV and low flavor. Think about cutting a light beer with tonic water and then having a chugging contest; that would be some kind of drinkable right?"
"At half the strength of regular Beck's I took the liberty to dilute such in half. This beer surely exceeds that mixture and isn't nearly as watered down as others would imply. Still, a thin beer, yet not unexpected in body."
"my brother left this in the fridge when he was here visiting . let me say i hate light beer to begin with but this stuff was god awful and for some people to compare this to a nice glass of water clean your faucets water is way better then this mess. only good thing i can say is the becks labal always looks nice . next time i drink becks it will be oktoberfest or becks dark ."
"pours very light straw color half inch head faded as quickly as the beer was poured with no lace. smells like a wet dish rag. taste dry, grainy, corn husk, slight hop note. mouthfeel was light carbonation tight, crisp. not worth the money. pass by this one."
"D - I wonder if this actually beat Miller to the 64 calorie beer. Either way it's still too much. Water has 0 calories and so should this beer cause water is essentially all it is. Not offensive in any way because there is almost nothing there to create offense."
"About a half of a finger of head which quickly dies. Some good bubble action too. Light golden color. The nose was the typicaly euro-skunk. Taste was bitter but watery in the mouth. This beer started out ok with the look and smell but kind of dies when you drink it. Hey but what do you want for 64 calories and 2.3% abv. A good beer to have if your not drinking for the night!"
"D: Extremely drinkable, great thirst quencher. I didn't notice any serious off flavors, and it goes down easy. Something to drink without thinking about it."
"I am drinking a Smuttynose IPA as I type this, so can't we all just get along?"
"I always find light beer to be an adventure, although not necessarily for the better. I just wanted to see how this would taste given its calorie count."
"This bad, but not in the ""this tastes like piss"" sense. There's just nothing here, that includes off-tastes and regular taste. I would pick it over BMC light beers however, as it seems as though Hops were at least within 20 feet of the kettle."
"Mouthfeel: super light and a very misty feeling in the mouth/aftertaste. Very drinkable, I guess, compares to water as far as mouthfeel is concerned (incredibly light)."
"A neighbor's friend gave me a bottle of this. One bottle was enough..."
"12oz green bottle poured into a pint glass. Pours a pale straw colored yellow with a thin fizzy white head that quickly disappears. The aroma is the grain, a touch of Euro skunkiness and faint spicy hops. The taste is very dry with faint grain and hop flavors. The mouthfeel is on the watery side due to the low ABV, and very prickly due to the high carbonation. Overall, not a horrible beer to drink on a hot summers day when you really don't want to drink a beer with much alcohol content, but for most instances, I will grab something with a little more flavor."
"Wow. Not what I expected. I expected a light beer with at least some flavor. This is THE most watered down beer I've ever tasted in my life. The taste isn't bad it's just nonexistant... Totally nonexistant. And the beer actually smells like tap water with a hint of malt. clear golden yellow water with some bubbles. That's all this is. What a waste of $7.99. I feel like such a sucker for buying this."
"Wow, did someone really make a 2.5% beer on purpose? Wow..."
"My roommate's ex left one in the fridge so thought I'd crack it open and review it. Umm where to start... Two fingers worth of head that disappeared quickly. No lacing. Smell is very musty like a beer glass left over night at the night club. As far as taste, well there really isn't one. Comes down just like club soda almost. Very little taste, no mouth feel but leaves that carbonation tingle in the throat. I can't imagine ever drinking this again and I won't even be finishing this one."
"d-could drink alot but with such a ABV of 2.3 it would not get me fair."
"If you HAVE to drink low calorie, here ya go Â– otherwise, get the real deal."
"This will be a short review, mainly because this beer is so short on actual flavor. This is so close to water that I was tempted to put it on ice, no kidding. Becks managed to combine the poor flavor of a non-alcoholic beer with the shortness of flavor of a light beer. I am not one for knocking a beer but this stuff is down right bad. The appearance is an unattractive one, weak head, and next to no color. Smell is not noteworthy by any means, nor the flavor. If your looking for a light beer, look ELSEWHERE!"
"I can believe the calorie rating on this: it's one step above carbonated water."
"Pours a clear yellow color with little head retention. Smell is of honey mixing with a hint of sweet malt. The taste is mellow and crisp. Sweet with a slight dry flavor profile in the end. Very clean flavor and refreshing. A great beer when you only want to chill and have one."
"Very pale in color with no head if any. Typical cooked corn/syrupy aroma that's somewhat sweet. Taste is much of the same except that it's almost bland and seltzer-like. Not sure if this can be called beer but I guess I could put it a bit above typical american light lagers."
"I'm not entirely sure that this qualifies as ""beer," per se. The most distinctive characteristic is definitely ""seltzer," to the point where my girlfriend commented that, upon hearing its dismal abv, you could simply ""cut"" Coors light with seltzer to produce something akin to Beck's Premier. That being said, however, I've grown oddly fond of the concotion. It inspired me to make a dive to my local distributor to find a bottle of Anchor's Small Beer, which, alas, they did not have. The taste, of course, is nil, though it's oddly refreshing as a water drink, rather than a beer. What caught my interest, however, is the uniquely low alcohol content. Not quite an NA beer, but almost half the alcohol content of most lights, this is something of its own class. Smirinoff ""Pure"" comes to mind? Anyhow, it's appearance, nose, mouthfeel, and taste are so lacking its not really worth dignifying with a description. I am going to give it a ""3" for Drinkability, though, because I honestly believe that this is a great utility beer. It's remarkable for, say, family functions where the possibility of embarassing oneself in front of Aunt Gertrude is ever-looming as a direct result of a mountain of free beers and, lets be honest, not much else to do. The same goes for tailgating when you actually want to remember the game or concert, etc. It's the ultimate in session...""beverages""...for the sessions with friends, family, and colleagues of the Coors Light & Labatt's set, aka, America."
"Avoid."
"Overall a good and highly drinkable light beer. More flavor than I expected."
"Nostalgia aside, can this beer be rated in a glass? I can't recall pouring this beer before. Here goes... short-lived, thin head in a willibecker...tawny yellow color...aroma is pleasantly mass-produced...flat, faux malt appeal...for a light, it offers a pinch of taste and no aftertaste--a ""hammer me"" beer if there was one...still, that magic number 64 (calories) is apparently as magical for Beck & Co. as it is for the Wu-Tang Clan..."
"This had all the texture of a glass of water. A good bland beer to pair with spicy food to let the heat retain. I can't recommend this to anyone without having a crisis of conscious. Drink at your own risk."
"D - Not much for flavor and incredibly light. Compares to Michelob Ultra except Beck's has more flavor."
"This beer poured the dullest shade of yellow with an ultra thin light white head, that was gone as quickly as it came with no residual lacing. The smell even in a tulip glass was a barely discernable light toasted malt. It drank like a cold glass of water with just a hint of malt flavor, absolutely no hops to speak off. Mouthfeel was thin and watery with some very mild carbonation. Overall its drinkable like a glass of water is drinkable, there is no enjoyment to be found in this beer. Easily the worst european beer I have ever had, and easily the most boring beer I have ever drank."
"Beck's Premier Light pours a pale yellow with a white head from a green twelve ounce bottle. The aroma is skunky and not very pleasant. Very light flavor, kind of grainy, kind of skunky and altogether unpleasant. I didn't realize until now that this was a 2.3% beer. I can't really imagine who the intended market is for this, it tastes bad and it doesn't have enough alcohol in it to appeal to people just trying to get a buzz or appeal to those who want an na beer."
"Good if you want to be sober and skinny."
"As much as I dislike American macro lights I understand they have their place, and I do admit I drink them from time to time, but this is the most watered down beer I think I've ever tasted."
"BeckÂ’s Premier Light is a good choice of beer when youÂ’re craving the taste of malt and hops but donÂ’t want the calories, carbs, or alcohol. It is a little better than the worst light beers on the market (is that a compliment??) and it does offer an easy drinking formula that light beer advocates will enjoy."
"D: By no means a good beer, but it tastes significantly better than any other light beer I've tried. At 2.3%, it's going to take a lot of these if you're planning on feeling any alcoholic effects (totally defeating the purpose of drnking a light beer), but if you're watching your weight and are having one or two social drinks, this may be your best choice."
"Skunked, watery, German-style pilsner. There's no other way to describe it. It does have a more grainy malt character to it than Beck's Light, and there are some delicate hop flavors in the background, but there's really not much going on. The flavor ranks right up there with non-alcoholic beers, and for the extra 1.8% abv that you're getting I see no point in bothering with this at all. There are much better light beers out there! Unless, of course, you really like that German malt and hop flavor - but if that's the case why not really enjoy one good bottle of beer versus two of these? Disappointing to say the least..."
"Paid 2.79 euro for a 3-pack. This is marketed as ""Beck's Next"" in Italy. Looks sufficiently like fizzy yellow beer. Big bubble, fluffy head for about 5 seconds which then vanished into nothing. Smell is somewhat limey. Taste is about what you expect from this category, but slightly better than the standard low-carb beer. Mouthfeel is surprisingly nice, not too weak with decent carbonation. A little too sweet I suppose."
"At 64 calories, this stuff will probably fly off of the shelves. My wife, who is beginning to appreciate the better beers, said she probably wont finish the six pack. I have never been happier!"
"D - high due to its lack of beerdom"
"The last of the low carb beers brought over during the family gathering. Looks watery with the slightest yellow hue. Decent head in comparison to the others. Smells of well water and a bit of grassiness, I'm straining for that though. Taste is also watery with a slight floral aspect and a stronger artificial sweetener flavor. Mostly though its well water. This might have been better than the other low carb beers I tried but its still horrible. I don't know why people get this, I will never have a low carb beer again, even if its free. My low carb experiment ended with the conclusion that low carb and beer were never meant to be in the same sentence. Duh."
"D: Very low drinkability, not my style. Drain-pour."
"The description for a ""2.0"" rating pretty much says it all. It's very pale, with little smell to note, and the taste and drinkability are that of a severely watered down beer with little acolohol content. But then what do you expect from 64 calories? It's not horrible, and stil maintains bit of the flavor of a regular Beck's although severely diluted. I suppose if you're planning on doing some binge drinking, and feel like saving a few hundred calories then it's not a bad option... just start with something better and switch over when you have enough of a buzz going that the lack of taste isn't a huge concern. ;)"
"Pours the palest light straw color, with pristine clarity. Two and a half finger head of fizz shows zero lacing and no retention. Extremely faint hallertau or saaz hop skunk aroma, with a weak pale malt and wheat scent; but no aroma to speak of. Extra light pale malt and wheat taste; kinda sweet- with a gentle wave of euro-hop bitterness that overcompensates for the lack of malt flavor. Hint of light-struck hops in the aftertaste. Medium carbonation and very watery body gives it a super-light and crisp mouthfeel similiar to tonic water. The finish is clean other than a trace of euro-skunk; so a good drinkability but very boring. This is way to light even for the style and the hop character is grossly unbalanced."
"I can't say that I had high hopes for Premium Light because I've had too many of Brauerei Beck's products. Still, I thought it might be okay beer in a 'not that bad' kind of way. Apparently I'm a slow learner."
"alright, enough flack from all you real men who dont drink light beer. sometimes drinking 5 imperials of barley wine and washing it down with 10 plates of nachos is a little overkill. theres nothing wrong with enjoying a light beer every now and then. (gasp!) anyway, this stuff is alright. im not in love with it, but hey, i dont like soda and this is a good pick for lunch or after the gym when you dont really need the full impact of a heavyweight brew but need a little refresher. its pale, of course, and it smells faint. lightly sweet and grainy if anything. its crisp in the mouth, refreshing and light and delivers a touch of sweetness matched with the slightest pressence of hops. like a dumbed down, lighter version of....becks! it is somewhat enjoyable, a lil funky and it tastes better than the usual NA beer. which is basically what it could be chalked up as (low alc. very low calories). so all in all, i think its a decent stab at a low cal/alch. beer, and on hot days when the sun is out in full effect, its a decent quencher."
"This beer is rated on the low side and it may be misleading. It's not a poorly crafted beer by any means (there are much worse), it lacks flavor & complexity."
"very very light shade of yellow beer, almost like ginger ale in colour, massive bubby head, looks artificial. Aroma is somewhat akin to regular bottled Becks, light saazy hops. Taste is like water with maybe somehops in it.perhaps 1 hop cone per 20 gallons, light and seltzer like. Thin and watery on the palate Overall I would say tis would quench ones thirst, and in all reality with only 64 calories the lightest of light beer., it is better than its American competitors like Green Light and Mich.Ultra"
"I do not under stand the point of justification for this product. When does beer stop being beer? When itÂ’s Beck's Â“Premier LightÂ” !!!"
"An ultra light is an ultra light and expecting anything more from it is unreasonable. And in that spirit I'd have to say this wasn't a bad representation of the original. The pour is an overly carbonated golden-yellow with a frothy white head that fades quicky, no lacing. Very slight old clothes/book smell on the nose but not offensive. Just enough hops to remind you it's a beer and not a sports drink. I'd add this to the list of Aspen Edge and Bud Select for ultra-lights although Amstel and others still qualify."
"Pours a yellow/faded gold color and looks a little on the bubbly side. The nose has a skunky edge to it. The flavor is gross. This absolutely tastes like a ""diet"" beer. Reminds me of sparkling water. This really does not taste like beer at all. The mouthfeel is ridiculous. So thin and watery, it almost disappears before you swallow the drink. I'm really struggling to find any good remarks about this beer."
"There is an edgy metallic back-of-throat bitterness and then a clean finish. You see your empty glass and bottle and wonder to yourself; did I just drink a beer?"
"Presentation: Packaged in a green glass Euro-style longneck with a pop off crown. Served in a standard pint tap glass."
"i do not know what is different about this compared to beck light. I do not know if they have changed to this or what. I will say that this is a good bang for your buch as calories are concerned. yes the flavor is weak! but at 64 calories what do you expect. This is not a ""beer drinkers beer"" per say it's at least an alternative to michelob ultra,aspen or the other ""low calorie"" beers. for the 64 calories it is, this delivers acceptable taste."
"One of the first tips in reviewing a beer is ""Keep the style in mind."" This new product is not regular Beck's. But that's OK. It's actually a very drinkable, smooth and tasteful competitor to the ""Aspen Edges"" and ""Michelob Ultras"" of the world. On that comparison, it succeeds very well because, frankly, it has at least some quality taste about it. It's weaker than the Regular brew from Beck's, yes; but for a low-carb and low-cal brew, why not drink a Beck's? It won't become my ""regular"" beer, but I think I will become a regular ""Beck's Premier"" drinker. [Thanks, JB, for the sample bottle. I went out and bought some more!]"
"Poured a crystal clear pale yellowish color, with a fizzy head that quickly vanished without a trace. The smell was slightly sweet, maybe some sort of grains in there, but I can't tell. Taste was dry, and crisp at the end with nothing in the middle. Pretty pathetic. Mouthfeel was like carbonated water. I can't say that I would ever drink this one again, even if it was free."
"This Beck's Premier Light simply doesn't measure up, it IS better than a Michelob Ultra but it isn't very close to the real thing."
"Drinkability & Notes: Tastes like a dry non-alcoholic beer. Why is there a need to brew something that is so close to water? I really hope the market dies on this stuff."
"I am not surprised at all this stuff is so bad. Regular Beck's I actually like but this is silly. Contains 64 calories: This stuff probably has about 2% abv because pure alcohol itself has about that many calories per serving. That means there is absolutely no room left in the liquid for residual sugars or solids which would give this ""beer"" any beer like qualities. The fact that this is brewed using only barley, hops, water and yeast blows my mind."
