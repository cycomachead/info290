"O - Meh.  I think it is not terrible to drink, but I don't see the point.  Almost no flavor, and what is there is not terribly appealing."
""
"Overall: for light beers, probably the best I have tried. It actually has flavor and aroma. Essentially tastes like a watered down Euro lager."
""
""
""
"Nice enough for a  3.5% abv sessionalble lager"
"Ok lager. Hint of floral on the finish."
"The taste highlights a more grainy character with a clean hop finish. Light beers are light beers are light beers. This one is a little better than some."
""
""
"Overall - It's been around for years so there must be a market for it."
""
"Yet another beer that snobs love to rip on. I tend to like beers that I don't have to chew on, taste like coffee or chocolate or fruit. Amstel Light fits my tastes. A tasty refreshing beer I can drink anytime. This beer does not deserve so many terrible ratings, get over yourselves people."
"It's not bad if you're sitting in the sun on a hot day with a 200ml bottle. Wouldn't serve with dinner, wouldn't decline one, however."

""
""
"This only being reviewed so i have a complete list of beers I've tired, and it's sad but this is on it."
"It should also be noted that this is being reviewed solely for the sake of being a completest."
""
"Always remember: 'If it's skunk, it's junk'..."
""
"An average beer. Nothing special."
""
"As lager, I really like it.  Much more than some of the other light beers.  Tastes great and isn't as filling as the others."
""
"when i am on a diet this is my go to light beer. not bad for a light beer but thats not saying much.."
""
""
""
"Its just bad all around bad"

"Had Amstel LIght for the first time over the weekend, was ok, at best"
"Awful. Really couldnt drink this beer."
"I will usually pick this up to serve at parties.  I won't serve any of the big 3 light beers, this one at least has real beer pretensions (however limited), and swill drinkers won't complain that there's no ""normal"" beer if this is in a cooler on the back porch.  Not horrible, not great, pretty much right down the middle with perhaps a bit stronger nose (mild skunk) than expected.  Thin on the palate, straw color, and limited aftertaste.  Amstel is also my preferred golf course beer; it’s available from the drinks cart at most courses, isn’t terrible, and you can drink 6 of them without losing your putting stroke."

"Better than many of the other popular light lagers.  This however, is not saying much.  I was pleasantly surprised by a bitterness I would not expect from a beer like this."

""
""
"Hey! It's better than Heineken. If you like bitter aftertaste in the form of an amber watery beer than this one for you. Very little body to this beer.  All-in-a all, it's a mediocre ""skunk"" beer."

"Overall - a little more flavor and this could be considered a pretty decent light beer, unfortunately this is extremely bland and water will quench the thirst better. Fortunately enough, there's nothing awful about it either meaning, it serves it's purpose well enough."

"The finish has some malt sweetness to it, but is generally lacking in flavor. Overall this isn't a great beer, but for the sad style of light lager it's not a bad representation."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"It poured golden yeal, light head, lots of carbonation, and some lacing. It had the taste of corn and metal, with hints of anything, was also watery and light bodied. It was refreshing, had no edge, and went down easy. It had no after to speak of and not many redeeming qualities. Good party beer I guess for all those hipster types out there."

"Pours a light straw-yellow in color with a very thin white head. Some very spotty lacing is seen. The aroma is just of some yeast and grain. Nothing fancy really. The taste is on the flat side and watered-down with just some grain with a hint of floral as well. Slight metallic taste through out Overall, not a big fan of this one."

"Refreshing beer, and that is it. Though, not bad among its style."
""
"Overall: It enjoyed this beer. It beats out 95 percent of light lagers out there. It beats out bud light , coors light , natural light but the price is to high for my pocket book . I will drank Amstel Light in the future from a break from the norm but I will stick Miller Light from now."
""
""
""
""
""
"Wholly unimpressive, this beer is not worth the money, and is hardly worth drinking. It is flat, tasteless, nearly colorless, and has zero zing in the moth. One might consider it refreshing, if you looking for a super light beer that resembles water."

"Slightly darker than US light lagers, the head dissapates quickly, leaving only the impression of light malts and tangy hop. flavor is very slight, a bitterness that leaves immediately when swallowed, leaving no notable flavors other than light malts and bitter hops; same as the nose. Carbonation level is very heavy with a very watery mouthfeel, yet this same trait makes this beer as easy to drink as a diet soda. Unimpressive but inoffensive, and a less offensive flavor then most american light lagers. This is a beer whose whole is better than the sum of its parts."
""

"Overall, this beer is just barely a step above water. Almost no flavor whatsoever."

"not the worst wash on the market, but another generic macro euro lager type, this one falling on the sweeter side, with an extract malt vibe and a general lack of anything fresh or interesting. more carbonation would make this passable, and its not bad from the bottle, but a little air exposure in the glass and the beer goes flat. a little bitterness in the aftertaste, but hard to credit hops for that. its a little filling as well, which is odd for a beer this low in abv, it doesn't even work to catch a quick buzz. its not horribly off in flavor, which I guess is redeeming in some sense, but this is a pretty beat brew, and one to avoid if you are looking for quality lager."

"The appearance of Amstel Light was a light golden amber color. The smell of it was a little like corn but very little smell overall. The taste was a little watery but did have a little bit of hops to it. Overall, not bad but it did taste a little watered down compared to other beers that i have tried."

"O: Disgusting for the most part. No flavor or aroma to speak of. What's there is actually terrible and skunky. Who drinks this stuff?"
""
"I think the reviews are overly harsh because this is an import, and a *gasp* lager. It's not supposed to be an IPA. If you judge it against what it's supposed to be, I think it easily meets the mark, even if it's not setting a new standard."

"O: This beer is very easy to drink but the aroma and taste are not very appealing."
""
""
"Good mouthfeel, medium light body, crisp carbonation, not too watery. Look, this isn't a good beer by any means but it might get the job done on a sweltering day and it's your first and you're not expecting much and you're really thirsty and you can't have too much alcohol cause you have to drive soon and so on and so forth. Or you could just have water and wait for something better to come along, I don't know."
"Pours a clear yellow with a foamy bone colored head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Small blotches of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of grain and some skunky vegetal aromas. Taste is pretty watery and is mainly of grain and a mild grassy note. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and thin mouthfeel. Overall, this is a poor beer that is watery and thin."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This is a very good light beer. It exceeds expectations, for me anyway, for a light beer. Pleasant tasting and easy to drink. I have tried a number of light beers and to date this was the best. Until i find another light beer to be better this would be my favorite."

"It is truly amazing that this beer is literally nothing. The wonders of science."
""
""
""
"This brew poured with a half finger of pure white head that actually took awhile to dissipated. The body was a clear, straw yellow with moderate visible carbonation. The nose was very mild with a hint of grain and nothing else. The taste was…well…pretty terrible. I got a hint of grass, grain and metal. The body was thicker than expected with moderate carbonation. The metal lasted until the finish that was luckily pretty quick. Nothing about this beer was very pleasant. I would definitely avoid this one."

Seriously still not 250 characters? How about now? Holy shit still not at 250, but this beer is still unbelievably terrible almost beyond explanation"

"Overall, I'll drink this beer any day of the week over any American Adjunct Lager. I was surprised at how good the appearance was, perhaps it was the glass I used. But anyway, a good beer to session during a sporting event. I actually like this macro."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Easy to drink and sessionable but not one of my favorites and not one that I will have very often. At the open bars at many receptions and conferences, this is often the best choice but otherwise I might avoid it."
"Overall – It is somewhat refreshing, but not flavorful at all. Possibly good on a very warm day, but otherwise not worth the time."

"A nice beer for a lite. Pleasent hops taste, nice color. It purs with a weak head on my glass. Low carbonation. It has a nice palate for being a light beer. Better by far than most american light beers. I would drink it anyday of the week. I have not tasted the regular version, soon I am going to do it"

""
"O - It's beer, that's about it"
""
""
""
"IT has a sweetness to it that makes you wanna keep drinking to balance out the grainy bitterness so you can easily go through a bunch of these if you wanted to. With that being said I'd take this over Coors or Bud Light anyday so its definitely better than those beers in my opinion."
""
"Overall - The beer selection was weak, so I tried something I hadn't had before. Not good.. I wouldn't drink this again unless it was free and I was planning on drinking 20 of them while camping."

"Nose is heavy on the grains - straw, wet hay, reminds me of my days working at a garden center. Pours like my piss after a week in the bush, plus a finger of a fizzy white cap. Ends up looking like a decent lager though to be honest. It’s got that metallic brown / corn presence that you’ll find in new castle, stella and the like. I have no idea what this comes from but it’s there across the board. Not off-putting really. Perfectly drinkable. I would never seek this out though. Overall, fine, yeah, it is what it is."

"My frst light beer, are they supposed to taste bad like that? Like every food and/or drink which is light ""but good for you"" ??"

"O: A decent beer that fills the need while mowing the lawn or killing a thirst but fails in the long run. it's definitely better than bud light or Coors light but that doesn't mean much."

"A quality beer....as long as someone else pays for it. If your paying and want a light beer, just go American and buy twice as much beer for the same price."

"69."
"Golden and clear appearance with a decent light and white head that forms. Some corn and grain in the nose mixed in with a little rag weed and some citrus. Very mellow taste, slight sweetness from the malt with a touch of grain and hay. Nice mild bitterness in the finish. Smooth and light mouthfeel with moderate carbonation. Overall, I enjoyed it. It is what it is, a fairly simple light lager."
"overall, nothing i will waste my time with again. its only real selling point is that it's relatively inoffensive. unless you're offended by bland, flavorless beers."
"ug. ""the beer drinker's light beer"" this is not. avoid!"
"Very light aroma of lager yeast and a touch of grain. Not much going on."
"Looks like carbonated water with added beer color white head that was not there when I put the bottle down. way too fizzy. Hazy gold in color taste and flavor are flat zero watery Craaaappy save your money."
"I bought a 12 pack based on their motto that it is a beer drinkers light beer. It took me over a month to drink the 12'er. It became my beer of last resort. God awful front end and back end taste. This is garbage. I would not recommend this beer and have told many to avoid."
"Nearly the same consistency as water. I did not find this beer offensive, but it was not very good either."
"It is a clear gold. Taste and flavor are near nil. Watery, not as good as mineral water. Crappy beer. Not worth buying, it sucks."
"Pale golden color with a small fizzy white head. Adjunk aroma. Amstel Light is slightly malty relative to its American low-end brethren, with hints of dirt, cast iron, and general badness. Unpleasant bitterness and a touch of metal. Unexciting mouthfeel. Terrible aftertaste."
"Bottle. Pours straw hue with a lasting white head that leaves a good amount of lacing. Nose is light grassy hay that reminds me of a standard European macro. Light, watery body. Unpleasant bitter taste probably from hops extract. I finished the bottle only because I had to flush a sandwich with something."
"Overall: Light beers are why I thought I didn't like beer in my early drinking days. But I want to try as many as I can and light beers are still beers."
"As you can imagine, it seems to be a watered down version of Amstel. Any head that forms will vansish quickly. Distinguishing smells are not there, and the taste is not noteworthy or special. A very typical macro brew. It comes in plastic liters in parts of Europe so that was convenient."
"O/D-Could be worse. End review."
"Poured all head, standard BMC white. Settled down to a clear standard straw yellow. Smell has a hint of the start of skunking and standard grass and grain. Taste is just a standard BMC despite all the advertising claims that he has so much more flavor than other light beers. The only thing a little stronger than most lights is the bitter finish. So I'd say acceptable if you like standard BMC lights, but that's about it."
"Innocuous, plain, and good for totally divided attentions, and evidently popped collars."
"D - OK, and not bad; its somewhat decent for a light beer and probably one of the lights I would choose for a Miller or Bud; low flavor profile, characteristic of a light beer, but not as much flavor as the ads claim the beer has; still tastes too watery"
"Overall-Only positive is it's under 100 calories, besides that don't drink this unless you like Light Beers."
"O- No thanks on this one."
"Overall: A beautiful looking beer. Great color and clarity. High astringency and chalkiness kills this for me. I don't see me drinking this again."
"o - Overall not a good beer at all. A step up from Miller Light, but that's not saying much. Would prefer Bud Light to this if I had to pick a light beer, but I'll be switching to whiskey for the night pretty soon."
"Taste is very plain, bland and boring. It isn't as bad as many but it's not good. There's a sharp light carbonation with a watery mouthfeel and a bad after taste."
"Overall Drinkability - Like having sex in a boat. You know the rest."
"The mouthfeel is nice, it's well-carbonated and prickly on the mouthfeel. The drinkability isn't great for a light beer, it tastes like it should be a bit heavier in ABV. Overall, this really isn't a great beer. It's servicable, but just barely. If it was the only thing available, I'd drink it and not complain too much. But picking this over the Yuengling and Stella in my parent's fridge was a mistake. Absolutely need a light beer? This is better than many, but seriously? Sam Adams Light or bust. It's bizarre to think that this might be better than most people's experience with this beer, because I took this bottle straight out of an unopened 12 pack."
"Overall what's the point? Well...it is a light beer but giving it a modicum of a flavor profile might make this moderately worthwhile."
"I enjoy the Damm Good Beer commercials but thats about all. I'm sure that Amsterdam isn't that proud of this beer. Anyway this was probably one of the first imported beers I ever had and honestly it wasn't anything to really brag about. This beer pours out as a pale yellow with a little head on top. The aroma is basically just a malt based brew. Not much to pick out really. The taste is the same as the aromas. Not a whole lot going on here. It's drinkable but that's all."
"O - Of the light beers I sampled this evening, this is the only one that's actually pretty offensive on some level. The taste is just bad despite it minimal but that's actually there. I don't see much sense in consuming this beer. Ever."
"O: Not a beer I would purchase or necessarily reach for but it did the job over the other available options that night. Could still do worse than an Amstel Light."
"Pours a sickly watery straw color with a thick boisterous white soapy head that doesn't dissipate and no lacing. Smells like corn and horse piss (like Stella Artois) Tastes really nasty like Corona and death had a baby beer -- like rotten corn and old egg. Mouthfeel is watery and has a heavy carbonation. Overall it is one of the worst light beers I've tried. If you are in a trashy mood, take a Natty Light over this dog piss."
"Not as bad as other light beers that Ive tried, but still not close to being good."
"This isn't bad for an adjunct lager, not something I would prefer though."
"D: Easy to drink, but definitely not anything special."
"D: It has low ABV and is not complex. Though that makes it easy to drink (to chug), it does not make it a great beer to enjoy."
"This showed to be just another cheap selection at a small bar. It's like the BMC's. Something you buy to save money instead of enjoy a good beer."
"The beer was pretty light. The carbonation was a bit too high, but honestly one of the better beer for this style. I might choose this one if given the choice over most BMC beers."
"It's drinkable but not very enjoyable."
"That said, I suppose I could crush these all night with nary a care in the world if I chose. But I would never choose to do so..."
"Pours a light yellow color, some carbonation, little fizzy white head, with some sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, ricy, very slight hop note. The taste is kinda malty, skunked/ricy. Light body. Not Drinkable, why do they make these kinds of beer are beyond me, what a waste of water."
"D- Just bleh overall. Part of a mix 6, so I don't feel too bad. Not something that tastes bad enough(or at least not present enough) to recoil from, but I'll never buy again."
"The flavor is watery and insubstantial, with no lingering flavors or complexity. As an associate once said, ""beer-flavored water""."
"Pours a light golden body with a small head. Just has the average Dutch skunky smell with not much else going on. Tastes quite light; not too much here, but more than most light beers. Feels pretty bubbly. One of the better light beers out there, but that is not saying much."
"mouthfeel is light and watery and the drinkability is low due to lack of flavor and aroma"
"Pours a clean pale yellow color with a small white head. In the aroma, faint sweetness to a standard European lager. In the taste, dry malt and a small bite, but thin and not much going on. A small bite and light bodied mouthfeel, with a dry standard lager kind of aftertaste. Nothing too exciting here, I guess that is why I don't golf!"
"D- This beer was average in the drinkability. It wasn't as bad as everyone makes it out to be. Is it a great beer? Nope. Does it do it's job? For the most part. I would rather drink this than most offerings from BMC."
"D- This is a very weak light beer, but isn't that the point. Honestly, if you want a light beer there are better, cheaper ones at your local store. Highly sessionable only because it is so watery and will not fill you up or make you drunk."
"Drink- On a hot day in So. Cal 5 years ago probably a sixer while mowing the lawn. Today just 1. All I can do."
"Very thin and watery, to be expected from a light lager... nothing to really enjoy here, other than a cold flavorless beer. It's easy to drink, but I wouldn't want to drink another one. Certainly not on my dime."
"D- Drinkable like flavored water is drinkable. I guess if you wanted to chug watery beer this will work, but you want to drink a beer for the flavor this is not worth having."
"D- Easy as water until you get the terrible bitter skunk aftertaste."
"Drinkability- it is easy drinking but just not super complex its nothing i would probably ever by again just such a boring beer its nothing id search out again, its better then alot macros from USA but still nothing incredible at all,"
"D: Goes down easy, but the taste and aftertaste ruin any possibility of good quality drinkability."
"I was surprised of the flavor profile this brew offered; heady, doughy, singing of clear malts,and ultimately very refreshing. Judging this beer within it's rightful category,as a ""light beer"" it's a blockbuster by comparison. Don't let the ""light"" connotation dissuade you from trying it."
"D - Easily consumed light beer but definitely not enjoyable. Would not recommend to anyone."
"Light bodied. high carbonation, and not too interesting. This is not something I will seek out again."
"Poured this very light colored lager into my glass and it produced a broken bubble head of one finger which vanished in seconds. Mild lacing but no real body or cling to that. The color is a 3 on the SRM chart. Smell is weak corn, more like the stalks, wheat chaff, and malt. Taste is harsh, sour bread, the rest I can't really identify, just not good. A little buzz on my tongue, but leaves the back of my throat sort of sticky and dry. Not at all worth the price. Glad I don't have any more of this to drink."
"Lighter body, watery, quick, clean drinking, but definitely not pleasurable. It's not horrible for light beer, but if you consider the price, buying this is pretty much ludicrous."
"Another Quizzo beer entry. It ours a clear pale straw topped by about a finger or so of white foam. The nose comprises soap, flowers, and corn syrup. Normally, these macro-ish types don't smell so goofy, but, frankly, as they smell bad, it's hard to really say this is entirely unusual. The taste follows closely, though some funky wheat slithers its way in there as well. Coulda done without that. The body is light, with a light moderate carbonation and a dry-ish finish. Overall, a sad beer, one I would definitely never call a damn good beer (even with spelling errors intact)."
"D- Because the taste isn't much, I guess its another easy pounder, but not something I enjoy anymore."
"Pours a pale golden color. Quite clear with visible carbonation. Smells mostly of grain. Taste brings grain and some husks along with the faintest hint of hops. Mouthfeel is light with loads of carbonation. Overly carbonated without much flavor, not too drinkable."
"Is it drinkable?? Sure. But, with all the decent beers out there, I'm not sure why I should seek this one out."
"D - I didn't find this all that drinkable. After I had the one I wasn't looking foward to the taste of another. There are bettewr light beers if that is your preference."
"overall not the worst tasting, just the least tasting i had this evening."
"i suppose you could argue that this is super drinkable, but the mouthfeel really hurt this for me. also, with no flavor, why would anyone _want_ to drink this? even a cheap 40 of malt liquor is better than this."
"Despite the bad ratings, I kind of enjoy this beer. It is not overly carbonated, it does not have too strong of flavoring, and it is easy to find. It's not a preferable beer, but it surely has nothing wrong with it. Not watery at all. I think it deserves better than it has been given"
"I can smell this beer as soon as I open it but I always like to start with the pour. In the pint glass it pours a bright, golden, crystal clear yellow. The head is not impressive. Just a plain white that doesn't hang out very long. The nose is quite pungent with a lingering skunkiness. The taste is similar to the nose but with less skunkiness. It was replaced with some bitterness. I wouldn't say it's bad especially compared to some of the other ultras and lights available if you're watching calories. However, like my friend Travis says, ""Watch what you eat, not what you drink."""
"this was my first taste of imported beer at a robust age of sixteen, I was stepping up in the world. I didn't like this gargage 14 years ago and I don't like it now. Its funky, skunky, way to bitter and almost impossible to drink. The bottle does not help, this should be canned and served next to carlsberg."
"I'm only reviewing this because my parents had some friends over a couple weeks ago and they left some beers behind in my aging fridge that I leave at their house, because they don't drink. This beer poured watery and had a billowing white head that took about two minutes to fade before lacing the glass. It is the palest of yellow, actually kind of looks urine. It isn't skunked but smells as if it is. Horrible smell. The taste is weak and somewhat metallic. I only gave it a 1.5 because it isn't the worst beer I've ever had. The mouthfeel is watery and ultra light, pretty flat really. This beer is awful. I don't even know why they make beers that're 3.5%, it's only for show."
"Drinkability: This is one of the better, more flavorful beers for its style, actually. A beer I wouldn't seek out, but I'd drink it again if it were offered. Of course this doesn't stand up to the best craft brews, but it is a good beer for its style- though there are better light beers out there."
"D- It's a light lager. It's made to be drank copiously. Altogether there's little going on with this beer other than a slap to the wallet."
"Does not have a flavor, except for a slight after taste. Kind of gross really. Thin mouthfeel, harsh almost stringent mouthfeel. Really gross."
"The body was, as expected, light and clean. Drinkability was OK for a style that's not really my thing. Overall, a decent beer, for what it is. If you're in the mood for a ""Lite"" beer, you could do worse."
"D - Great on a warm day or a cool night. smooth with a great crisp after-tone."
"D - at 3.5% abv I could drink quite a few of these and I have. Goes great with bbq'd brauts and/or seafood."
"Overall dry and bland. Not worth what I paid for a case of it. Honestly, I would rather have bud light."
"A darker appearance, preppy aroma. Taste, teh carbonation probably makes you think there's more of the Euro hop than is really there. Very easy going down, it is a very light beer, but its decent enough in a pinch on a hot day. Tons of carbonation, plenty of water, but it does the trick, especially with some smoke."
"I'm really surprised how low of a rating this beer has received. It is my favorite light beer out there. I guess beer advocates just don't like light beers. Anyway, I've really liked this beers for many years. I think it's got a good enough taste and doesn't overdo so you can enjoy it with a meal. I also hear it's got the lowest amount of calories for those who care (besides the MGD and ultra crap)"
"Decent enough mouthfeel, but given that bottle two was worse than bottle one, the drinkability must be judged as weak."
"D -- Well, what can you say? It isn't an offensive beer, it certainly doesn't make you think too much about silly things like flavor and character, and goes down real easy. If you understand what you're getting into when you pop the cap, you shouldn't be expecting a Fullers ESB. I could down a few in a sitting... before I got really bored."
"I will not be going here again unless I have no choice."
"Drinkability: The best characteristic about this light beer (it's dry, spicy finish) also seems to be it's biggest detriment. Overall, not bad for a light beer. But it's still a light beer."
"D-Must be deprived of beer for weeks to truly enjoy this...Ok I know this beer is lacks true flavor, but has a better taste than other light beers out there, and that is what it is a Light beer... and one of the better ones in my opinion."
"D: I was hoping this imported effort would be a more interesting effort of this style. It's not, and certainly not worth the extra buck or 2 a sixer over a domestic light beer."
"Overall: I like Amstel better than Heineken, although I feel like most people view oppositely. Either way, this beer is definitely decent, not too exciting, and has no bad qualities."
"If people think Bud represents American brewing the way that I believed that Amstel represents the Netherlands, I understand our bad rep. That said it appears there's bad beer all over the world."
"Amstel Light poured a bright yellow color, with a rich head. It smelt awful and just offensive, it smelt almost skunked. There wasnt much in the taste either, it simply didnt have a taste, which might be good; it didnt taste like the smell. It was light and easy to drink. Overall its not the worst beer in the world, and its a better light beer, it wasnt good, but at the same time its not really bad."
"Proost!"
"As far as light beers go I suppose this one is as drinkable as they come, however I'm glad a friend gave me this single one to try. If I were at a party or a cook out and this was the beer they had, well I could at least drink it. Probably even refreshing on a hot summer day."
"Drinkability: Sure, it's uninteresting and comes up a tad watery, but it IS a light lager. Harmless and forgettable, if it weren't for these humble notes, I'd be hard-pressed to recall the details."
"Considering that this is a light beer, it's not the worst. But I'll never drink it again."
"D: This beer's popularity is about as damning an indictment of the light lager style as I can find. An expensive European import that is sadly lacking flavor, character, or any sense of refreshment."
"being an import this beer is kind of lagging a lot of flavor. Lets go amsterdam we know your good for weed lets get to the beer."
"This is a pricey beer and on a value scale there are many light beers at half the price that are every bit as good and in many cases better."
"Not something I would buy again."
"Notes: I drank this right after I had a Heineken Light, and this beer tasted so much better. However, after trying this by itself, I had to lower my scores. I guess being better than Heineken Light isn't saying much."
"D: Had it at $2 Tuesdays. What did you expect?"
"Joining in with the fiance on a low carb diet before our wedding so this was worth a try. It pours nearly completely clear with a 1/4 inch head which quickly vanishes. Its not ALL that bad. Its drinkable. Throw a lime in there with it and that will give it a little extra boost. God, I miss my porters."
"Drinkability- Not something I'd ever buy for myself but I'd take it over a lot of beers. Good as far as generic light lagers goes."
"For a long time, i was convinced this was a big step up from the BMC lights of the world. I though it always had just enough flavor to justify that claim, now im feeling like i bought into hype. Maybe not, did have a little flavor to it. Meh."
"Flavor is thin, light, watery. Particularly as the carbonation dissipates. Tastes better directly from the bottle with a touch of carbonation and a light grainy/fruity finish. Feel is flat and watery in either case. Fairly drinkable as it doesn't offend yet has not character whatsoever to justify the concept."
"My pour netted a little better than a finger's worth of bubbly, rocky bone-white head with low retention. The color was a light golden-yellow with NE-quality clarity. Nose had a slight grassiness underlain by a cereal quality. Mouthfeel was medium with a lightly sweet vanilla taste in the mouth. Very different from many of the CANned light beers that I have drank of late. Finish was slightly dry, kind of refreshing. It would probably be more satisfying on a hot day."
"Drinkability? I'd have it again, but I'd never buy it. Don't think it would pair well with anything..."
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Smell is mild, some hints of malt. Taste is crisp, some malts. There is not a whole lot of flavor here. Feels light in the mouth. Drinkability is good, o.k. for drinking games. Overall this makes for a below average beer."
"It's not like Amstel light tastes bad, it just doesn't really taste like anything. Honestly if I feel like drinking light beer I'll save some money and just frat hard with some Natty"
"Overall: Well, what to say. Not a great pilsner, as my fellow BA-members also indicate in the rating. However, I think that most people here seem to forget, that this beer has almost NO calories. Given that fact, I think the brewers did a great job, still being able to put so much taste in. But in general, if you don't have any overweight and not on a diet, avoid!"
"Nothing to it, really."
"Mouthfeel is extremely light bodied (one is reminded of the phrase ""beer-flavored water"") that I guess is consistent with the 3.5% ABV. Would be more drinkable if it didn't taste so bad."
"D: A PBR-caliber beer at a premium price? No thanks. Superior to BMC, but not enough to justify the price differential."
"Price is a little high for a light beer but it tastes better then your normal light beers"
"What more really needs to be said about this beer? Obviously nobody here at BA reads this really wondering if Amstel is a decent beer or not. We all know it isn't. It is boring, bland but apparently pleases the masses. It doesn't necessarily offend, but my one complaint is the premium price you sometimes see it for. Why pay for this when there are so many crafts available for about the same price or maybe $1 for a sixer more - and infinitely more enjoyable. Hopefully more of the masses will catch on to that reality soon."
"Next time you buy a six pack of this remember that there is 6 pack of o'douls light for way cheaper!"
"D- It is what it is. It isn't going to blow you away in the flavor department, but it is a highly drinkable light lager that is easy to consume a few in a single sitting."
"12oz. bottle served in a pilsener glass. Poured a translucent gold with a two inch, loose, frothy white head that eventually settles into a quarter inch cap before dissipating into a swirl. Nose is primarily cereal grains and adjuncts. Consistent with nose - very subdued and light in body. Not much going on here in the taste department. Mouthfeel is light-bodied, a little watery, with a consistent background effervescence from start to finish. Drinkability - well, it's drinkable, but not much going on in terms of flavor. Still, there's worse out there."
"Out at a bar with a crappy beer selection with some co-workers, so I ordered one. Poured from the bottle in to a pint glass. Dull yellow color, decent white head. Musty smell. Taste and mouthfeel - both boring. Really not a lot to this beer. I had no idea until now that Amstel Light is only 3.5%. Wow, maybe that's why it tastes like water. Definitely gonna think twice about ordering one of these again. This beer is now the official ""I can't drink any more tonight, but I'll have one more Amstel"" beer."
"Back before I knew better, I drank Amstel Light a lot, thinking I was a true beer afficionado. It's not bad beer overall, but its nothing I would run out and buy. However, at only 95 calories per 12 oz., its a great beer to drink if you're on a diet. Other than Sam Adams light it is sadly the best you can do."
"D- The ABV on this was actually 1.5% less than what I thought it would be, now I see why people can drink the hell out of this at a bar or similiar setting, but I ask myself why, this stuff taste like impending doom. Amstel light is good enough if your trying to pass the time at a party that you dont want to be at in the 1st place, so it's got that going for it, but nothing else."
"Overall, a step above a BMC. The default choice for me when it's this or a BMC. Goes down easy enough but not much flavor. Not a player in the home rotation."
"D- thirst quenching, mild, and easy going. flavor is totally non aggressive and laid back, this is the beer that made me start liking beer sometime back in the early 90's."
"D: It's definately drinkable. With the limited selection at the Kentucky speedway this past weekend, this was about as good as you could get other than Miller and Bud."
"Pours gold with a white ½ inch head, smells of malt and a little yeast. Very light a crisp, with a mild malty flavor, some light grains or yeast and slight hint of spice. Overall it's pretty carbonated and on the watered down side as far as taste goes, but very refreshing and easy to drink. Good beer from a refreshment standpoint, but boring from a taste standpoint."
" As far as drinkability goes could easly drink lots of these but don't know why i would want to i dont think i will ever buy this agian"
"Drinkability: Not exactly something I would go searching for, but it could be good on a hot day with some food."
"D: Easy drink for hot summer day. However, not my typical type of beer."
"D: Yes, it is very drinkable, very smooth and watered down, but at 3.5% alcohol you'd have to drink a lot of these just to get a buzz... but I guess that's the point. Overall, absolutely nothing spectacular here. VERY overpriced, I'm glad I got it on sale. Who would pay regular price for this?"
"Drinkability: For a light lager I think this is highly drinkable, especially in warmer weather. While not the first thing I would go for, it is more sessionable than a lot of beers in its class."
"D- Drinkable? Well I could probably chug a couple of these. Now would I want to? A much better question, and the answer is no. Though in a pinch I would take this over a BMC lite."
"This really seems more like an american adjunct light to me, I am not impressed at all. This is a common 'premium' option in bars, I would avoid. Crystal clear, as pale as pale can be, the smell is skunk and cereal. There is some corn floating around in the taste...unimpressive at best...I would stay away....next time I'll just grab a dollar High Life and be done with it."
"D: Easy to drink, Now it's my second favorite light beer, dominating still Modelo LIght."
"The old throwback import for me... I've drank many of these over my lifetime when nothing else was available. It was sorta my standby for a while... I realize now it wasn't as good as I thought but I still have one every now and then for old times sake."
"D: not really much to this, I mean nothing at all"
"It smells bad but doesn't taste bad. It doesn't taste like much of anything. I think my grade for this beer is higher than most others because I tried to judge it within its style category. I would never buy this beer again however."
"This beer pours a pale straw color. The head is a half an inch in height, and recedes quickly leaving no lacing. The aroma is of nothing. When I try really hard I can detect some extremely faint malt. The taste is little easier to detect that the aroma, but it is still mostly nothing. The mouthfeel is light bodied with nice carbonation. It is actually pretty good for a light lager. Overall, this beer tastes too much like water for my likings. I will not be having this beer again."
"Mouthfeel is slick and watery, but finishes tingly, very crisp. Very low drinkability. I know a lot of people like this as a low calorie lighter import, but there really is not much flavor, and what flavor is there is funky and skunky."
"Drinkability is not quite as good as other light lagers. Should go down like water and it doesn't."
"""Sickly yellow"" is the only way I can describe the color of this beer. The head lasts for about 5 seconds before disappearing completely. The only thing I can discern from the nose is that this beer is probably skunked. Tastes of grains, corn and some kind of hop--very unbalanced. Watery and extremely carbonated, reminiscent of a club soda. Maybe this beer has some sort of defining flavor, but I can't find it through the excess carbonation and unappealing aroma. I couldn't even finish this one bottle. It's too bad macrobrews have to be like this."
"Overall: maybe all the marketing has clouded my judgment a bit. I was hoping this would stand up a little better than its American macro peers... but... eh. Pass on this one."
"Drinkability: I do see how some people could defend this beer on a hot summer day - after all, it is mostly water. But there has to be a better light beer out there than this."
"D: I found myself having trouble finishing the bottle."
"If you see the international beer pack at World Market, buy something else. They put more of an emphasis on number of countries, not quality of beverages."
"Don't drink and review."
"D: better than most american lights, but not much"
"Overall: I would not recommend this beer to anyone. It is awful cold and even worse warm. There is room for improvement, however."
"Pours a light straw amber with moderate carbonation and a hint of lacing. Smells like straw, hops, bitterness, and skunk. Tastes like watery straw with lots of skunk. Pretty light mouthfeel with average carbonation. This beer was not very drinkable, in my opinion - especially given that it is marketed as a ""premium"" quality beer here in the US."
"Almost too clear when poured, very little head and watery taste. It's very easy to put down a few in a short time because of the lack of overall ""beer taste."" It has a lighter feel and taste than typical American light beers but has a better drinkability"
" Poured a pale gold with a moderate fizzy head,lots of carbonation. A grainy,corn aroma with a faint wiff of hops. Some flavor,little malt,little hops,with a crisp finish,thin body,kind of watery. Not bad for a light beer,but kind of steep in price, Drinkable"
"Pours clear, light and golden with no head. Bizarre. Almost no aroma also. The taste is not offensive, just very faint. The mouthfeel is light and watery. Almost no bitterness to balance no malt. Not a bad beer, but barely a beer. Leaves a lasting impression of water."
"Not that enjoyable but not the worst thing in the world either."
"Absolutely a horrible beer. I had 12 of these in the fridge my girlfriend bought, and after one, it was time to put my boots on and go out to get something else that night. The flavor is like making a hybrid tea with old cardboard and selzer water - it literally tastes like wet paper mixed with some kind of glue. How they could make a beer this bad and sell it for $9.99 a 6-pack (price at my corner store in Chicago) is truly miraculous. ANY cheap light beer I've tried (Busch, Miller, etc.) is better than this."
"D: My sister swears by this stuff. I swear at it. I guess it's a touch better than most lights. But that's faint praise."
"Seems to smell & taste like a light beer. No big deal. Nothing offensive or off, and it's drinkable enough, just doesn't have much flavor or body. Malty overall with some light grain and a smidge of grassy hops to balance. Finishes clean. I guess if you're a light beer drinker (wuss) this is a good choice, but I think it's more of a trendy status thing than a flavor thing. I won't pay for it again, but I'd drink it and enjoy it if someone handed me one."
"I'd drink it again, but it would need to be cheaper or I would have to be disparate."
"I would never buy this for myself, but if someone is willing to buy me one, I wont turn it down."
"Sad, as some of the Amstel beers available in the Netherlands aren't bad -- but this watered down swill is just not worth having."
"Isn't it still?"
"A good beer for someone who wants a beer , but is watching calories. A def step up from some other light domestic macros, which shall remain nameless..."
"D - Not good I don't know how this stuff is popular with some people I guess marketing goes a long way"
"Best feature was that it was no charge on airplane."
"Notes from 9/27/07"
"For a light beer this one is not the worst but that really isn't an endorsement. Certainly it is drinkable in a pinch even if it is weak. Nothing metallic here but it has a little grain husk like malt to it. Light hops, light sweet smell, and light pale color. But what do you expect its a light beer. The taste and the aroma are the same."
"Not bad for a lite lager. Golden pour with a weak malt scent. Fairly watery on the palate, although fuller than most other lites. Flavor is rather bland, there is a decent sharpness but it soon fades. Low abv isn't very helpful either. Many better choices out there."
"D: You could drink the piss out of this. The question is why would you when there are much better session/lawnmover beers out there."
"Don't bother"
"D: With so many other choices, why bother?"
"drinkability: very easy. It is wahat it is. Rather have the real thing in Amsterdam"
"In short, this beer is a pretty decent light ale with enough flavor to make you want to drink another, and since the calories and alcohol content are both low, you can in clear conscience."
"Overall, it about average for a widely distributed macro but not worth the ""premium import"" title."
"Sub par. Just something to wash food down with. Nothing I would go out looking for. Another lackluster beer in the style."
"For a light beer it's not all that bad. I'll drink one if it's handed to me but I'm not going to necessarily ever look for it (not that it's hard to find). Darker shade of gold so it's not as pale looking as many other light lagers. Sweet, grainy/hay taste, watery but also nothing bad either. Really, actually, one of the better light beers I've had."
"This beer looked weak when poured into my glass, a pale straw color with a fizzy white head. Laced poorly, little retention. Aromas were hay, yeast and a macrobrew staleness. Flavors were of lager malts, musty yeast, and some lagging hops at the end. Typical import macrobrew stuff. The body was very light and washed out, just like the ALC %, no depth or punch to it. Technically beer but a very boring one."
"Decent session beer if your having a hard time finding a better one."
"Pours a very pale straw color with a thin soapy white head that settled into a sparse cap. The aroma is of stale grassy hops, grain, and sulfur/rusty metal. The grassy hops hit up front with some sulfur notes. There is an odd fruitiness to it, perhaps a combination of grain husk and lemon. The feel is light almost watery, well carbonation, finishes very neutral. Easy beer to swill down. A light Euro lager for sure, has some hop flavor which puts it up a notch over the American light macro."
"Overall this is really not a bad light brew. i could drink this with no problem and is a good beer for after mowing the grass."
"Pairing suggestions: Stinky marijuanna, thats about the only thing that could stand up to the pungent skunk taste of this beer."
"When this beer is poured into a glass, it becomes apparent that there is little texture and body. The coloring here is so thin, I would say it is closer to water than beer. However, it is crisp looking. The aroma carries a wheat-like scent. High amount of grain aroma to this one. The flavor is a yeasty concoction of cornmeal, with the ever-so-faint taste of leftover hops. Actually, a very appealing flavor considering its ""light"" label. There is plenty to enjoy about its drinkability. The feel it leaves is so light and fizzy, that the ability to drink more than one is pretty much guaranteed. Good for a light lager."
"Doesn't really appeal to me. I think not worth the premium price that they try to get for it. It's a marketing beer. Buy a cheaper/better American beer if you are going to drink a light beer."
"It was ok for a light, i agree with other reviews, better than a Heine."
"D: A big pass on this stinker."
"It is what it is - a Euromacro. Tastes like it has some class but nothing I would seek out."
" not exactly recommended."
"D - It is easy drinking and when given very limited options it is drinkable."
"This is a light beer which carries more of a beer flavor than actual characteristics. Still one of the more drinkable light beers I've had, certainly not bad-tasting, but overall a shrug-your-shoulders offering when not much else is available."
"Threw down a few cans of this at a recent get-together. Not terrible, but not something I'd ever seek out. Very light, watery mouthfeel that would lend itself best to washing down strong bbq, hopefully not ruining the flavor in the first place. Tastes of corn, very little malt. You could do better than Amstel."
"Overall Amstel Light is in my top two for light lager because it has distinctive flavor and a nice feel to it's light body. I would much rather drink this beer than most ll's."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Even though the initial attack is aggressive and even biting, it very quickly eases up and becomes really smooth and soft... remaining so right through the swallow. Unfortunately, this doesn't save the beer from itself. It's a hard one to drink out of a glass, purposefully noticing all of its warts. But on a blistering day, out of the cooler and down the gullet, it certainly has its place."
"As with many light lagers, the drinkability is high: like water, it would hit the spot on a hot day. I can see this as a lawnmower beer, or an end of a long evening drink. I don't think I would pay real money for it, however."
"Very let down on my first Amstel Light attempt. Pours an incredibly pale and soulless yellow. This beer could easily pass as ""bud light"". Upon popping the top, the smell is immediately amsterdam ""skunk"". Taste is pale, dead and boring. The mouthfeel is very watery, very american macro rice brew going on here. Drinkability, about the same as ""natty light"" at a campus keg party. It's just unimpressive and not good."
"Ugh. This is gross. Tastes like skunkiness, grain and rice. Appearance is standard for the style, although that's nothing I'm gonna get too excited about (weak head, straw color). Mild hint of hops. Body is fairly thin, but again, appropriate to the style. I dunno, I'm not feeling it."
"Just your average pale, Euro lager here. No surprises, yet not a total waste of time. Excellent lawnmower, summertime beer. Pours a really bright, clear golden color straight out of 12oz bottle with a thin, 1-finger head. Nothing really to note of as far as smell goes, just a lightly sweet hint of malt. Taste was decent; malty sweetness, no noticeable hop presence. Overall, not horrible but not the best beer either. If you had to go with a major beer brand from Amsterdam, you might want to pick the one in the green bottle."
"Lets see how close we can get to making a 3.2% beer and still sell it at liqour stores. Poured a pale watery yellow with a white head that goes quickly. Very corny smell, skunky. The taste is a bad mixture of hop and barley. Too light to pick too much up. Watery body and pepsi like carbonation. Not the worst, but not worth the relatively high price tag."
"D: If you take it for what it is, a macro lager, you could do much worse. I'm not going out of my way to get it, but I could see myself knocking a few of these back on the golf course in the summer. Tolerable at best though."
"Average drinkability. It's a macro-style lager, that's about all you can say. There are beers of comparable quality for a lot less money."
"I can drink a million of these, but now after realizing that they are glorified water I think that I will skip it in the future."
"Overall, not a good beer. I'm always baffled at the popularity of beers like this (Heineken, Budweiser, etc.). Apparently, people really, really like water."
"Not a beer I would recommend. However, I have a good friend (who thinks he is a pretty big beer afficionado) that used to call this his favorite beer and said he would drink only this. I know he would like to forget this and would never admit to this now, but felt I had to mention it since he frequents this site and will most likely read this review."
"A decent drinkability if you are looking to have a few after a long day of work, and want something too drink while socializing."
"Overall: This beer is much better on draft than from a bottle and definetly a can. Frothy head lasts much longer on draft than from a bottle."
"Smells of malt but not much else. Pours to a bright yellow with a quickly disappearing fizzy head. Taste is bland without much backbone. Extremely slight bitterness typical of a lager. The carbonation is almost the most evident aspect of this brew. It tastes almost watery at best. If this is a typical ""light lager"" I won't be looking for any more."
"Seriously -- if you're calorie conscious and are just seeking to quench your thirst, drink water, seltzer, iced tea or diet soft drinks. Because if you really need a beer, it means you really like beer. Which means you want a beer that tastes like beer. And though this is slightly more beerlike than other light lagers, it's still doesn't have much beer taste. So really, what's the point?"
"Pours pale yellow with almost no head. Smell is sweet with corn and maltiness in the taste. Very carbonated, and light, obviously, easy to drink, and tastes decent enough. Nothing spectacular, but I don't get all the really low ratings. This wasn't supposed to be a big bold beer that turned out light. Rating it for what it is, this is good for the style."
"drinkability - ahh, something try when going out. Worth a try when going out if they don't sell anythingelse."
"it IS a light lager, and it's decent, so no real problems with giving it some relatively high scores"
"Had this on-tap for the first time at Legal Sea Foods in Short Hills... did its job well for being a light, easily drinkable brew... didn't realize the ABV was so low at 3.5%... went down effortlessly like water... straw-colored, gold appearance with no head... bland, typical, average brew smell, and the taste wasn't anything to write home about... bland, unappealing, and uninviting, tasted very macro-like with an obvious corn flavor... drinkability was easy because of the low ABV, but definitely would not want to have more than one of these in a single setting... just wanted to try it..."
"Thin and crisp, light bodied. Not very good. Repeated on my most of the night, and it wasn't the welcome hop burps - pretty nasty. Probably the best choice at my company Xmas party but I was one and done - just bad."
"Very watered down in taste and mouthfeel. Light in color and smell. I'm not one for light beers usually, and this is one of those reasons why. Just overall lacking. Very easy to drink a lot of it and get smashed, but very hard to sit and drink one or two and enjoy it."
"I am very surprised to see the highly negative reviews for Amstel Light. As usual, the BA crowd likes to tear down a beer just because it is a light beer. It is said, over and again, that a beer should be reviewed based on its category. Unfortunately, a lot of people don't do that. Amstel Light has a nice full flavor for a light beer with an awesome mouthfeel."
"To be avoided."
"Pours a pale golden yellow color with minimal white head on it. Smell is of corn with a somewhat skunky kind of aroma. Taste is sweet, and some what grainy. I can taste some of the corn that I found in the smell too. A little sweet honey is found at the end of the sips too. Moutfeeling is light and refreshing."
"But hey, I wanted to try it. I just would not recommend it."
"drinkability is supurb, for obvious reasons. there is not much good to say about this beer. if a drinker is looking for a very thin brew that doesn't taste much, this is the brew for him or her."
"D: One step above Pellegrino and washes pizza down but I have got to get my in-laws to broaden their horizons."
"Drinkable but pretty insipid."
"Amstel light is easy to drink, and is an all around average light beer. For the money, there are just as good American light lagers at a lower price."
"12 ounce can poured with vigor."
"Glad I didnt have to pay for it, I would have wanted my money back!"
"Decent light lager, better than BMC, but is it worth the extra $? I dont think so."
"I didn't mind it, I wouldn't drink it that often but it was somewhat refreshing."
"It might be a shade better than the Big 3 Lights. but that doesn't justify the high prices this costs. In the category of light beer, Michelob Light tastes better and won't cost you an arm and a leg."
"I'd had Amstel Light before and remembered it for being an equal substitute to Heineken. After today's sample I can think of few beers I would prefer this over..."
"Wow, the best light beer I've had. But maybe I'm just easily impressed by hops in a light lager. The pale malt was weak, but there was an actual hops profile of spicy European hops. The aroma was actually quite big for a light beer, and while it hinted at it's light lager style with adjuncts, the pale malt and hops still showed through. Really, this has to be one of the only light lagers that actually leaves some bitterness in your mouth. Still, this beer is only good for the style."
"D - Pretty nasty stuff. I haven't tried the full flavored Amstel, but I won't touch this light crap ever again."
"To be honest, I dont get any of these up-priced light beers. I do drink light beers at times, but when I do I drink Miller Lite...and of the ones Ive mentioned in this review, I cant say I will be switching from that preference for Miller Lite any time soon."
"12 oz. bottle in a Boags Premium pilsner glassbarnacles of bubbles cling to the bottom third of the glass after an overly effervescent head dissipatesfor how many Amstels Ive had, Ive never sessioned it before (I hear some snickers from my serious drinking friends)still, here goesthe tint is urine yellowthe aroma is unmistakable Northern European mass production, although some slivers of nostalgia are embedded in that smelland then, the tin-swift rush through the mouth. No palate to speak of. The consolationand insultof this lager is simply that it cries for some sort of bar food to interact with. Like ketchup, this beer shouldnt be enjoyed aloneoh well"
"D- could drink alot but because there isnt much there,"
"Color is a typical amber-gold, not much head. Smell is fairly substantial and malty. Flavor is malty and pleasant, not complex, a little watery but still palatable. For a light beer, this actually tastes pretty good - considerably better than any other light beer I've ever had. At least one feels as though one is drinking beer and not beer-flavored water!"
"Pours a clear pale gold, mild carbonation. Smell is of light grains and a hint of lime like smell, almost light struck. Taste is of course very light, but there is some light strawish grain and a hint of citrus zest. Its not a bad beer, quenched my thirst and did not offend. I probably won't be buying it though because of the price, and the low ABV."
"Pours a light golden colour with just a little too much head. Lacing was a tad spotty. A lot of carbonation up front, finishing out smooth with just a hint of bitterness at the very end. Went well with my bratwurst. Essentially omnipresent; if there is nothing better, i.e. at a baseball game or other such venue, this is my beer of choice."
"DJust uninteresting and boring though inoffensive."
"Overall: A tad better than your usual lights."
"D: Not very tasty simply because theres not much to taste, goes down very easily, not filling at all, with a 3.50% ABV theres almost no kick but thats essentially what this style is for. However, there are definitely better light beers out there."
"Amstel Light pours a light yellow with a white head from a brown twelve ounce bottle. The aroma is skunky. Light body and a skunky flavor, but not as intense as I would have imagined. Doesn't taste like much really, a little skunk toward the end. Not recommended."
"Drinkability: If I want to drink a lot, I could drink some of these."
"Amstel Light was a pale yellow color with a white head. The head was around briefly. The aroma was typical mass-market light beer malt and grain. The taste was light and and had a dry finish. It had medium carbonation. Drinkability was average. It's very average overall for mass-market beer, an acceptable alternative if at a sporting event or bar that lacks interesting inventory."
"A average light beer. Can you believe it retails at nearly $8/sixer? Not really worth it to me. Anyway, it is a drinkable beer with a bright white head and a skunky smell akin to Grolsch or Heineken. Mouthfeel is near water levels. Not abad for a light beer but nowhere near Sam Adams Light."
"What can I say about this one? A little malt and a little hop bite, but skunk and cooked vegetable dominate both the aroma and the flavor, and the drinkability suffers as a result. The mouth feel is a bit better than many light lagers, though not much. Honestly, you'd be better off getting a Bud Light. I'd rather have something that tastes like water than something that tastes this bad. I'd say I had a bad bottle, but the last bottle I had of this a couple years ago was just as bad. I figured my palate has changed a bit since then, so perhaps I'd re-try it. I'm glad I did, but I was not impressed with this brew (still), unfortunately."
"12 oz. bottle with no freshness date. It pours into the pilsner glass a crystal-clear pale gold with light carbonation and a finger of white head that leaves little lace. The aroma is quite light and macroish with maybe a touch of hops and the flavor is just as bland, with maybe some corn but no trace of hops.The body is light and tingly, drying, with a short finish. Overall not much more than carbonated alcohol water. Might as well drink something from BMC instead of paying for this import."
"I typically avoid light beers, but this one I'll make an exception for. A rather typical light pale yellow color with not much of a head that lingers a bit. A light grainy smell and a hoppy grainy flavor, quite pleasant really. It's well carbonated but is clean and good. It's good with a heavy meal or when you are trying to watch your calories."
"I should also say that this isn't my favorite style of beer, however since I'm on a low-carb diet right now I thought I would give it a try (at 5.8g of carbs, I can afford to drink two beers in a day instead of only one regular beer). For a light lager, it is definitely above average and was a pleasant surprise. I think the ads are right. It is the ""beer drinker's light beer."""
"The beer tastes extermely watered down, and has no flavoring what-so-ever. The one I tried didn't even pour like a regular beer, had no head and very little carbonation. If you're watching your calories and drinking ""light," you may as well save on taste and have a glass of water."
"Amstel Light was a clear pale yellow color with a white head. The head stuck around a little while with a little spotty lace. The aroma was light malt and grain. The taste was light and grainy with a dry finish. It was light bodied with medium-high carbonation. Drinkability was below average. I won't be wasting money on this one again."
"Pretty much your standard Light Lager. Not bad for the style, no bad flavors or aftertaste. If you like the style then you can probably settle with this, however it is a little pricey, so a similar domestic would probably be the better path."
"All and all, the shower wasn't so bad."
"D- For a light beer, it is okay but I would just stick with a light, crisper style before moving to this on a regular basis. A good kolsch or helles is a better choice. This can be expensive so just go for the good stuff."
"I think this beer is getting poor ratings in part because of the thinking that since it is well-advertised, it must suck. It is definitely a light beer with little aroma, and a thin body, but has an okay taste and leaves a pleasant finish. While I have had many beers that are better, this is not a bad beer, especially when a wide variety is not available."
"The only thing I tasted in this brew was a slight grain flavor with just a hint of hops. Not much really there. The only bright side is the beer doesn't really have any off flavors; again, there really isn't much flavor there at all. The worst part is the mouthfeel. Way too watery and thin, even for a light beer. This beer actually reminds me of a watered down cocktail. Not recommended."
"(THis beer was so bad that a draft michelob afterward tasted great by comparison.)"
"Get my buzz on- n"
"This is hands down the best of the bunch when it comes to macro brew light beers. If you close your eyes it almost feels like you are drinking a 'regular' beer. The appearance, smell, and taste are all average. But compared to the other light beers Amstel Light has the highest drinkability. It seems like you are drinking a beer not a watered down version of one."
"This is a better alternative than most domestic macro light lagers. It is light across the board in aroma, taste and mouthfeel, but the drinkability is better than average. Heineken is far from a favorite of mine, but Amstel is reasonably drinkable especially in hotter climes. A decent option if you find yourself with no other alternatives, but not much more than that."
"Overall, barely passed. Good for partys in your colllege days. Not so good now."
"Edit: Oops, this beer is so forgettable that I reviewed it twice in a month and didn't realize it. That should speak volumes."
"Amstel is better than most macro's light beers, but it honestly just tastes like a watered down Heineken. Maybe its the yeast, who knows. Anyways, appearance is actually quite good for a light beer. It looks like a Czech pilsner somehow. The smell is all malt, a little on the adjuncty side, but not American-like. The taste is watery, malty, and not pleasing. This beer has no hope presence at all. The mouthfeel is on the watery side, but much better than the other light beers out there, sans Beck's and the new Hein light. Drinkability is great. Definitely beats the Rodney King out of American light beers, however, it is watery and low in alcohol."
"Poured into my pint glass a clear amber color, with a small head. Smelled a hint of sweet. Taste was not too shabby. The drink ability of this is good. It would be great to chug one or two of these down with a brat. Overall for a Light Lager it wasn't half bad."
"¡Salud!"
"Pours light piss colored, slight swirls of head. Lightly carbonated. Smell is immediately skunky with light notes of 'beer', but not much else. Taste is also rather like bitterish seltzer, but the taste isn't so bad as to not be drinkable. Mouthfeel? It's a light beer and goes down like one. All in all, I've had better light beers, but it could be worse."
"Per label: Since 1870. 95 cal, 5g Carb, 1g Prot, 0 Fat."
"As much as I would like to believe this is better then BMC Light, it isn't. Simply add an off-putting skunky import wang to any typical light beer and you have Amstel Light. Yes, I know the skunkiness is the unique component to all those ""great"" import lagers, but Amstel is just plain worthless. At least with Bud Miller Coors you get a beer over 4% ABV. And to pay a premium for this stuff? Nah."
"It's easy to drink, you have to give it that, but nothing stands out about this beer."
"I think people drink this to give people the impression that they are drinking something above average when, in reality, it tastes the same as any other light macro. In other words, like nothing but vegetable with some skunk."
"D- if i was doing a keg stand, this would be the beer, but hard to swallow when drinking slow"
"D- It is a light lager with all the clean cut flavors and smoothness. Not that exciting but maybe on a really hot day at a baseball game it would taste better."
"Drinkability - I would consider drinking this occasionally if it wasn't for the steep price. This beer is like the Miller Lite of Holland, average at best. Otherwise, should be pretty drinkable."
"Drinkability  I have never liked this beer, even before I started drinking a better variety. Below average even for the style."
"With food I think this beer would be fine, but there's nothing by itself to really make me want to fork over extra money when I'm just having a beer on a hot day. It is better than a lot of light lagers, but I'm not running out to get this beer again anytime soon."
"Drinkability - This one loses a point for being pretentious. Pretty decent light lager, especially considering how low-cal and low-carb it is. Several notches above Michelob Ultra."
"This beer pours the same as anyother beer of the style: straw yellow. The moutfeel is very thin, but there is substantial hops (again for the style) to go along with an upfront sweetness. This is not a good beer, but it is not a bad light lager."
"Drinkability: High. A beer for people who don't really like beer? Hey, say what you want about Amstel Light, I'd rather have one of these at a bar without craft brews than most of the other corporate products out there."
"an average beer at best. this drink has a light color almost yellow. the smell was a grainey citric hop blend. the felt nice on the tongue mostly liked to citrus mist . not too sweet but not very bitter, a better alternative to corona. worth trying again but probably not my first choice."
"Poured a light straw yellow color with very small head that was gone fast. Smell was cereal grain with lightly sweet malt notes. A faint hint of citrus hops also. Taste was lightly sweet with almost a skunk bitterness, that did mellow into a more smooth bitterness as it went down. Probably one of the most ""tastefull"" macro light lagers I've had, but I didn't say ""enjoyable"". Mouthfeel was a little above medium carbonation and watery. Could be a decent pizza beer. I'd look for something else before grabbing one of these."
"I didn't expect much from Amstel Light in spite of the fact that it's 'the #1 imported light beer in America'. Actually, that last sentence would be more accurate if I changed 'in spite of the fact that' to 'since'. The winner of Macro Smackdown VIII has been crowned (largely due to a lack of any serious competition), but it wears that crown uneasily. Not recommended."
"Appears pale golden with a nice large white lively bubbled head leaves even fine lacing down my pils v shaped glass. Aroma has Euro hops...herbal with a touch of skunk some lemongrass sweetness thrown in as well as two row malts providing light cereal sweetness. Taste has a clean refreshing tone malts lightly toasted cereal grains gives off a peanut like flavor herbal grassy hop finish. Mouthfeel is light bodied and carbonation is a bit high no special textures to report. Drinkability is great for nine holes of golf yes I'd rather be drinking some Prima, Sunshine, or Pikeview Pils but when in WV a light beer with some hops could be your best option yes that's the sorry state of beerdom in West Virginia."
"Since its availability here in the states is widespread, Amstel Light is the beer to go to when you want a light beer, imo. Appearance is golden/yellow with a slight white head. Not much lacing on the glass. The smell is nothing special -- grainy with some aroma of malts. Taste is OK - it's a little thin w/ a good amount of carbonation. But, it's easy to drink and has more of a kick than Bud Light or Coors Light."
"A decent beer and more satisfying than most other light domestic beers."
"Finishes dry and empty."
"The mouth feel was thick for a light beer with a little too much carbonation."
"A beer from the netherrlands; i´m happy for the heineken group thet introduce this beer in my country this year, i waiting for the 1870, meanwhile in the first the taste is like a kolsch, very pretty yellow color, hops, and rice are present in its smell, little lacing, mouthfeel like a genuine holland bier, but is still present the kolsch taste; good for mexican and snacks, drink from a bottle, 79% recommended."
"Drinkability-I am not a fan of light beers but I would take this over a Coors light. I had a half Amstel Light last night (poet?) from my wifes glass and did not hate it. Its just not for me."
"¡Salud!"
"Believe it or not the comercials you see about this stuff aren't lying. To date, Amstel Light (all 95 calories per 12 oz serving worth), is the best most beerlike light beer I have had. I include cheater Sam Adams Light (they stretch the definition of ""light"" with like 125 calories vs I think 150 for a regular bottle of Boston Lager) in that statement. Appearance is kind of odd because on the one hand it has a nice deep brown color, but on the other it is obviously a little watery looking, the result being that dark brown color is nearly transparent. It does manage to maintain a surprisingly stable head for a light beer. Smell is pleasant, you know hoppy, a bit of malt, a bit of yeast, basically what a normal beer is supposed to smell like. Taste is quite good. Some sweet malt, balanced presence of hops that are of decent quality, if not too exciting. A little yeast is in there too, and obviously this is a very clean tasting beer. Mouthfeel IS a bit on the watery side, but not to the point where you actually think you are drinking water whenever you take a sip without looking right at the glass. Drinkability is excellent since not only does this beer taste pretty good, but it obviously does not weight you down, plus you're packing on fewer calories and not getting as drunk either. Is this going to fool you into thinking you just drank an oatmeal stout, an extra bitter, or a dopplebock? Of course not. It is still a bit on the watery side in fact. But it does a better job of hiding the fact that its a light beer than any other I've tried yet. And that slighty watery liquid at least has some real beer flavor present, if not as much richness as even I would like. Take it from me, you are not likely to find a better light beer in a regular bar. In fact, I could definately see ordering this over some regular beers that don't even make me wretch when I think about drinking them (MGD, Beck's, Rolling Rock, and Corona for example)"
"poured a pale yellow color with large white puffy head. Smell is very minimal, so as to almost nothing. Taste follows through, being very light with not much taste to be found. Finished cold and refreshing with no lingering aftertaste. Advertising is the biggest thing about this beer, With the low alcohol content, a nice expensive spacer."
"I am glad I tried this beer due to my Dutch heritage but it doesn't have unique traits from my perspective. I would drink it in place of most American macro lagers but wouldn't pay for it."
"Oh, well..."
"This pours a straw color with a small head.The smell is almost nonexistent,with a very slight hop and cooked vegatable scent.The taste is light and weak.This is watery with a slight hoppish flavor.The m/f is also light,watery,and weak.I can't imagine ever trying this again."
"The taste is likewise not real strong but is pleasant in a wispy, watery kind of way. Maybe a little too much carbonation but not enough to really upset even someone who obsesses over bubbles like me. This is not a tasty, enjoyable beer but it is drinkable and good at the bar when the girls are staring at the gut. Not a real beer drinker's beer but does serve its purpose in a far less nauseating way than most of its American light counterparts. Knows its role and plays it."
"I can't even stand this stuff long enough to drink the single. Drain-pour."
"Here the bit. Its a tasty brew with out a doubt, but.its got the same color as the domestics, the same mouth feel as the domestics, and not much of a head. To be honest the smell leaves a little to be desired, however that being said. Its got pretty good taste, and that my friend is worth overlooking the scent it leaves on my upper lip. Not sure its worth the 8 bucks a sixer though. Stick to the pub on this one to decide if its for you."
"D-another all nighter candidate. This stuff goes down like water if you have a stomach for light beers. I do, and so it does. Call me a wimp, I won't deny it."
"I don't know what the pricing on this is like, but I imagine it's more expensive than macro light lagers. I'd take Miller Lite over this anyday. Maybe it wouldn't be skunky under other circumstances, but I feel that enough of these taste this way that I'm not rating an ""off"" sample. Even rated within the style this still has problems. Even though it's watery and low-alcohol, I couldn't drink many more due to the sourness."
"D - Well, I suppose this category isn't terrible, because you could drink a TON of these and not get drunk or full, and at sub 4% ABV, they go down real fast."
"Nothing worth dreaming about here, but a viable option depending upon your options."
"They also get my dubious award for the most illiegible production code- some raised white dots on a red background that appear to make no consumer sense whatsoever."
"Overall: I liked this beer as far as a light beer goes. Better effort that American Macrobrews I think."
"Overall, a decent light beer- not the greatest tasting thing ever, but it has its purpose, and I'd rather have this than Coors."
"This is my ""work in the yard all day"" beer. I disagree with most reviewers: this is a good beer to have when you're having more than one...a lot more than one. It is not the best brew I have ever had, but far from the worst. I was never a lite beer fan until this one came around. Coor's light had been my preferred ""beach beer", when all you want is something cold and wet, but not sweet, and water is just a little too, well, watery. So until a better lite beer comes around, I'll always have a case in the fridge."
"For a light beer, this one is very tastey!"
"At 3.5%, if low alcohol is your aim get a bitter. I will never ever touch this again. Guess the comercials are right by saying the ""Lite beer drinkers lite beer."" I guess I'm not a lite beer drinker."
"Why do breweries bother with light beer? I know, for the executive on the go who doesnt want to feel filled up. Have a club soda instead! Appearance of this Light beer is almost clear water with a drop of yellow, not much foam and no lace. Aroma is that of the usual brussel sprouts and eau de skunk. Initial taste consists of watery malt, some grain, metallic alum in the middle, and a hint of some hops that strayed here accidentally. Way too expensive for the bitter aftertaste it leaves behind."
"Pours pale straw with a foamy two finger head and decent retention. Noteworthy patchwork of lace. Pilsener malt and euro-hop nose. Husky grain flavor with a solid pilsener malt backbone. Some light grain and skunk in the aftertaste, but still decently balanced for a light lager. Active streaming carbonation gives this light bodied brew a crisp, refreshing mouthfeel. Finishes clean and drinks easy if you don't mind the light-struck flavor. Good choice if you want a low-carb beer with some character; otherwise just an overpriced imported macro."
"A good light lager, and that is saying a lot. It looks golden clear and highly carbonated, like a typical lager. Actually retains a white loosely knit head and laced a bit on the glass. Smelled lightly malty and cereal-like. Slight souring and grainy. Tasted also slightly malty and cereal-like. Exhibited some flavors of butter-popcorn, vegitive, and corn sugar. Body was light and clean. Finish was crisp and clear. No true flavors pronounced themselves, but this beer is good at washing down pizza and nachos."
"This beer has a lot of flavor for a light. Too bad its not a good flavor! Nothing impressive at all here. I'm not sure what they are putting in this beer but its not worth the 7.99 they are charging for a six pack. I would recommend Pabst Blue Ribbion over this any day!"
"I mean, at least you can swallow other light beers without really tasting anything - just like water down the throat - and then forget about them, but Amstel Light makes sure to rip a blazing trench through your tastebuds, assuring you that you wont forget it's abhorrent ""taste"" any time soon."
"Also not really bad as an after mowing the grass beer to cool off. At least you won't get too buzzed from it."
"The true epitome of mediocracy. What a waste. If I wanted water, I would've bought water. Poured out to a nearly pathetic yellow clear color, with little head, no lace, and rather low carbonation. Scent? I think I smelled corn and hops, but it was so damn light it could've been a dog fart. Flavor was very weak, notes of corn and malt. Finished blandly, no aftertaste or anything. This beer is like a 90 Lb. Halfback. It's just not gonna cut it. Needs more flavor, much more flavor. Could be reviewed lower, but I was not repulsed by this brew (maybe only the inflated price). Not recommended."
"Drinkable, but not inspiring."
"Another one that I can enjoy that most BAs hate. I like Amstel mostly for its low abv. Its better than bud anyway. Pours a very golden macro-like yellow. Smell is a little skunky/grassy but it doesnt linger too much. Taste is very thin and watery malt but reasonably clean and fresh tasting. I call this stuff ""bird beer"" because it wouldnt get a bird drunk. Its still ok in my opinion."
"12 ounce bottle with some ungodly freshness dating. Not a bad beer, but nothing exciting. It did wet the old whistle though."
"I used to love this beer but havent had it in a long time... and now Im not sure what I thought was so great about it. But then again, I dont like light beers anymore either... I feel the US macros are light enough without watering them down even more. This one is very pale yellow with a medium-sized, white, rapidly diminishing head, and very little lacing. The smell is... well... hardly there, typical of a light beer: grain, light malt, and a touch of DMS. Some malt and the smallest dashes of hops among a grainy and flavor with a slightly yeasty yet astringent, short finish. Mouthfeel is thin and watery, carbonation is quite lively. Its not that great of a beer, and it definitely loses some points for its cost... but theres still something about it I like. I dont think Id seek this one out very often, but I had it after going for a run earlier and then eating a piece of pizza with too much red pepper sprinkled on it, and it was just what I needed. I guess thats worth something, right? That, and it's not COMPLETELY lifeless like the bulk of the light beers out there."
"Good Beer that starts well. Has good clean balance. Clean refreshing finish. Great after hard work. (I am drinking one now...) It is a little weak, but still a good AVAILABLE beer. Also noteworthy, the third beer is as good as the first! That quality, plus the fact it is rather cheeper than other good beers, makes it a staple at any bar."
"Cripe, just drink lemon water and save yourself 95 calories, if that drives your beer choices."
"In the end, I highly recommend this as a choice for those who want to be more sensible in what beer they drink, yet still have a very palateable beer."
"Pale yellow with a white lace for a head. Not much aroma. Some grassy grains, very clean. Taste watery, with some light grains. No hops. Very light bodied with a good amount of carbonation. Not to mention it only has 3.5% alcohol per volume. Save your money and drink some bud or miller light! The taste is the same and more alcohol for a lesser price."
"Pours the typical clear yellow color but with a half decent white head and lots of carbonation. The aroma is skunky, like a typical euro lager but worse. The taste is a dry mildly bitter flavor with a sharp skunky tang. Mouthfeel is barely above other watery versions of light lager with a typical amount of carbonation. Drinkability is slightly above the average light lager with a drier, less corny flavor. Not a bad thirst quencher but not the premium classy beer drinker's light beer as it's marketed."
"Drinkability: Easy drinking, light beer. Low alcohol content ensures that one can drink these all night. A decent beer, I have seen in cans also. However at a going rate of around $6.99 to $7.49 a six, a little on the expensive side for what you get."
"Why buy this stuff when you can spend just a bit more for something with actual flavor? Yeeshhh.."
"Overall-were it not for the price, Amstel Light would probably be the quissential starter beer for many as it is simply more flavorful than most other light lagers. Obviously not the greatest beer out there, and it is expensive, but I do give it props for being among the more flavorful light lagers. Cheers."
"Appearance is good with a nice head and for a lager dark colour. Smell is for light beer not too bad but litle oxidised and not much malt. Taste is empty and litle oxidised but has quiet a nice maltarome and though there is not too much bitterness for this beer it fits and is pleasant. Don't know if the revieuwed beer is the same cause on my label it say's Amstel Lite; full taste/lower calorie"
"Overall Impression: eh. Thin and weak. Being held captive on a plane made me order one. Think Ill stick to the Hiney or just order up the Bloody Mary next time."
"Pale straw color with a blanched white head that fades into nothingness. Faint grain and rice aroma and a trace amount of hops discernable in the aroma. Watery in taste; but the malt and hops that do come through in the other 4% of the fermented ""barley-pop"" does have a crisp, clean flavor. Surprisingly, no off-flavors. This very well be the only light lager I'll review because I'm slightly biased against light beers, they seem to me like an anomaly in brewing. Pair it up with some spicy food and this beer fairs pretty well. On its own, it is rather average, even for a light beer."
"This is just an insult to the word 'beer' in terms of both the 3.5% abv and the flavor. I'd rather be drinking water. It's a shame that marketing is all it takes for a company to get rich off of such crap."
"The body is lite as expected with small fizzy carbonation. Flavor is caramel and general sweetness up front with some spicy hops coming through on the finish. The beer is crisp and easy to drink, mostly due to lite body and general mildness of flavor. Not the best beer but a decent 'lite' beer."
"If you are looking for a light that has some semblance of taste, then this will not disappoint... a bit shy on the alcohol though."
"Just not a good beer. Thank god there was only 1 left in the cooler."
"I know why my girlfriend drinks so much of this: It tastes like nothing and there is hardly any alcohol. I poured it into a glass. That was a mistake because the color of this beer won't change much on the way out. I taste hops (I think) but they have an artificial twist to them. The aroma is of skunky beer, I was told by the girlfriend that is what it is supposed to smell like. While not high on my list, I can still understand why some folks would drink one of these. They are easy to drink, it's one saving grace (maybe a stretch)."
"poured a light yellow white head.aroma I think I smelled somthing. maybe some hops, corn flavor next to none I just wish you did'nt have to have 250 characters to rate a beer here how many time can one say this beer is bad, how about 7 awful, terrible,dreadful, appalling, shocking, horrific, unpleasant"
"Pours out a crystal clear yellow with a light covering of white bubbles. The nose is very very weak and has a skunky smell about it. Taste is about average crappy light beer, watery and a slight bitterness. Not much in the way of any real flavors. Mouthfeel was thin as it can get with a well-carbonated feel. Pretty much an overpriced light beer from another country, if you are going to drink crap at least drink cheap crap."
"Straw yellow colour topped by a thin lace of fine bubbles that didn't cover the whole top of the beer. Carbonation was evident by the profusion of bubbles rising to the surface. DMS and stale lager hop aroma. Very muted flavour reflected the aroma, but with an additional grain husk character. Very light body and high carbonation, with a texture close to that of water. Slight bitter aftertaste."
"The pour is a lovely pale straw. There is little to no head to speak of. Flavors and aromas are grainy/husky and a touch sweet. In the mouth the beer is nearly void of flavor-just a mild kiss of that thing called beer. If served ice cold in Yuma Arizona on a hot August night it might just hit the spot. But, here in Chicago Sept 11 2004 the beer is simply a tasteless yellow fizzy."
"Had this on a cruise. From what I remember, there was not much of a head and was a golden yellow color. Taste reminded me a lot of Budweiser, which is not truely a bad thing, but is not what I expect from an import. While I was not completely impressed with this beer it was not all that bad either. I actually had a real good time drinking these, especially on 2 for 1 draft nights."
"AND it's incredibly expensive, AND you can drink it all day and not even catch a buzz since it's ABV is so damn low."
"A reasonably drinkable beer if you have to go for a light beer, but Sam Adams light is better."
"The color of the sand at a New England beach. Had a small head for about 5 seconds, no lace. Smell is a sandy hop leaf - just one and it is kind of a shriveled runt. Flavor is like a salty desert. Damn, I can't get the whole sand and desert idea out of my head with this beer. It is just so dry it is shocking and I am surprised light beer drinkers can deal with such bitterness. Thin body with some zip and sizzle that smooths out at it sits. Sort of refreshing in its dryness. Pretty clean, better made than most light beers yet still far from desirable. Did I mention that this is dry?"
"Overall, this wasn't too bad when taken into the context of a very hot day and little to no shade plus physical activity. That said, I don't think I'll find myself drinking this brew very often."
"I must give props to the makers of Amstel light for marketing this as an imported light beer so they can charge 20 bucks a case and become popular in the states. This is a watered down beer if you can call it that. Pours a light pale yellow with NO head. Smell is grainy and skunky. Taste is of slight hops with a watered down taste. No body at all. Not drinkable, drink water if thirsty. I thought I would never say this but I would have rather had a Bud Light than an Amstel light, that should put into perspective how much I disliked this beer."
"This is marketed as the best tasting light beer in America. It's a good beer, but nothing spectacular. Average flavor, kinda like a jazzed up Miller Lite. Better than most American macrobrewed lagers, but for the price I'll take a Samuel Adams any day of the week. Did I mention the 3.5 ABV? Yea, wtf is that all about?"
"Drinkability  On the cusp of being poured out, but barely hanging on."
"Only positive thing I can post about this beer is the appearance, as it does pour a nice hazy yellow color, and starts off with a nice (albeit short-lived) head. Taste is bitter, coppery, not at all flavorful. Seemed lacking in carbonation and zing. Mouthfeel is similarly uninspired. I could only drink one, then had to cleanse my palate with a water and several Hoegaardens. This is to beer as a Big Mac is to fine cuisine. Don't waste your money on this overpriced and completely tasteless garbage."
"Standard pale fair here. Smell of veggies and corn, bit of skunk. This a basically a light version of a Heineken, but with less skunk. Flavor is dominated by corn, not as 'adjuncty' as domestic light lagers. Avoid if you can, if you must go light and you're not paying for it, go for this one."
"Useless, this was free and still wasn't worth drinking."
"It's an easy beer to drink and is one of the better light beers but overall it is watery and bland."
"I can drink this if no real beer is available, but it is still a light."
"Neither good nor bad, this beer just is, really. It's so close to average that there's nothing to rip severely or recommend heartily. It is what it is, a light beer with more flavor than most other light beers. That alone gives it a leg up on the competition. And if it was the only beer offered me, I'd drink it, because in spite of it's mediocrity, or perhaps because of it, it is quite drinkable. But when all's said and done, this is not something I'd buy for myself. I'll just cut my calories elsewhere."
"This is a very bland beer. What'd you expect? I must say that its better than most light beers out there especially all the other American macro light lagers. It has a light golden color and pours a thin almost not there head. It smells of hops and some malt and has a hopy bitter taste but its a little watered down hence the term light after the name."
"Pours golden yellow. Fizzy. Not much head. Weak aroma. Subtle caramel and mild hops. It's funny because it tastes a lot like O'Douls Amber. Thin, but nowhere as thin as something like Coors light. When there's no other choice, this is an acceptable beer."
"Overall, I am fairly ambivalent about Amstel Light. I'm not a particular fan of light beers, but I wouldn't mind being offered an Amstel Light again."
"As light beers go, this is one of the more flavorful ones. It's abv makes it right above NA beer, but it still tastes alright. Came in a 12 oz brown bottl, which is what a idrank it from. Had a pretty good malt and grain flavor that gives way to a little hops that taste a little peppery. I would never buy this unless I was choosing between this or macro lites."
"Airplane beer. This is the stuff that you can get on nearly every flight within the US. This is worse in cans than it is in bottles. The apperance takes a hit, as this light golden brew is sitting in my plastic cup and the aromas are more subdued as well. I still smell slight malts, hops, and seltzer water, but the aromas just arent as strong as they are in the bottled version. The same thing can be said about the taste. The mouthfeel remains MOR and the drinkability is just OK."
"I'm really not too crazy about this beer. Considering the amount of money it cost, I was not too impressed. It had a decent taste, and a decent mouthfeel, but overall I felt a little let down. It looks good in case and the bottle, but thats where the fun stops. I'd drink it, but I'd never pay 14 bucks for a twelve pack ever again."
"The light beer for serious beer drinkers (or something like that)? This beer starts out like a good looking lager with a crisp golden color and a stiff, rocky head, but it goes downhill after that. The beer had no real aroma even though I practically dropped my nose in the head. That shortfall continued into the taste, with none really present - no rich sweet malts, no tasty classic hop flavor - nothin'. The beer was cold and I thought maybe the flavor needed time to open, but as the beer warmed, still nothing and now, the crispness of this lager began to fade as well. If you are a seriuos beer drinker, take a pass on this lite offering ."
"Smelled like old pizza dough right off the top. Almost no head. Skunky, Skunky, flavor with the added bonus of that metallic light beer taste, like a nickel has been dissolved into it. I had mine for free at a nearby reception, so at least I don't feel ripped off."
"This beer is a golden color brew, white head to top it off. There are some grainy flavors, slighty malty, slight hop presence. The company will tell you that this is a beer drinkers light beer, which may not be far off except that beer drinkers dont drink light beers. The effort they spent coming up with a decent light should have been spent coming up with a good regular beer."
"Pale and clear yellow color, middling head at best, laces in two incomplete rings. Some sulfur to the aroma, some of cream corn aspects, malt dominates. Mouthfeel is light, along with carbonation and an overall graininess, the malt impression is fairly impaired. Hopping is decent and the finish is crisp, better than the beginning. Some metallics in later sips. Weak upfront and a little strident at the close, I can't say its very good even for the category."
"i hate myself for buying this beer. this beer ruined my evening, well almost, i guess i should just be grateful to have beer at all."
"The pale flavor and light hops make this beer a little week. The beer in Europe taste much better there than here. I would like to try this one in Holland."
"not a very good beer overall, but one of the top light beers available, probably only bested by sam adams light. pours a light, light amber colour and pretty much lacks any and all characteristics. there's a minimal grainy, malty smell and taste, but it's mostly just a watery brew. carbonation is low so it goes down smooth and is rather easy to drink, but that's not necessarily a good thing. boring. if i have to have a light beer, i guess an amstel will do."
"Husk water."
"People drink for two main reasons: 1) to enjoy a high quality brew or 2) to get drunk. Which leaves me to question who would drink this crap? It would take a whole lot to get drunk off this super light beer. Also there is no real taste. Their ad says ""the beer drinker's light beer."" Well maybe that's true, if the beer drinker normally drinks Coors. Very expensive. Ripoff!"
"Probably the best light beer available in the US.. it is smooth and maltier than any other Lite beers and has a nice malt finish and balance throughout... if you want to drink a light beer without sacrificing taste than this is the one. Very well made for a macro but being an import Henieken seems to push this beer and with good reason..Low ABV makes this highly drinkable as well as the well rounded taste."
"Average drinkability and this is with me dieing of thirst!!..but if in some horrible twighlight zone world were i was faced with this or a whole array of American lights..I would take this."
"Another weak pea colored brew with a white head of small to large bubbles that leaves very little lacing. It has a low quality aroma that reminds me of getting sick to my stomach. Oh not another one of these brews! It has a very small hoppy flavor smooth and with no fore or after bite. Its low alcohol content is also not a plus for me. Can I have a stout please! GF rating said it smells like cheap beer, looks like cheap beer, so it must be cheap beer! LOL."
"Notes: Best thing about this beer is the lack of calories. My rec.: walk an extra ten to fifteen minutes and treat yourself to something with flavor."
"This beer poured a large white frothy head with small bubbles that quickly diminished. The lacing was fair with this beer. The body was clear and had a straw yellow hue. It had a light hoppy aroma. The carbonation was lively in this beer. The flavor was bitter tasting from start to finish. The mouthfeel was light to medium, thin and watery."
"This beer is the perfect example of pedestrian swill. I have been drinking various IPAs and stronger ales lately. I had an Arrogant Bastard the night before drinking this, and i happened to enjoy it very much. the only way to describe this beer is as follows: someone slipped me this beer, and by the time i realized it wasnt really bad seltzer water, i was finished with it. it pours with all the characteristics of ginger ale, with heavy carboatoin, a large-bubbled head, and no lace. the color was yellow, nothing else. No smell, no taste besides the worn inside of an aluminum can. Not much pleasing about this beer, but i suppose if you're on a budget... well, I wouldnt even reccomend it for that situation. at least its still alcoholic."
"Amstel Light might have a little more taste than some domestic lights, but it fails to offer anything that would put it above that class as it is still quite watery. The flavor seemed very grassy to me for some reason. I guess this is a somewhat safe beer to drink for those new to beer, but altogether this is a very forgettable beer."
"Light gold Color, large head. Aroma is grainy. Hoppy light tasting, with some malt flavor. Kind of thin mouthfeel, but it is a light beer so it sort of excueable. Not to bad, not to good. Typical pilsner taste. Finish is clean. Aftertaste is slightly bitter."
"I didn't like this beer upon first taste. It pours yellow with a small white head like most american standard beers. I didn't like this beer after my first pint. It wasn't bad at all, but it just wasn't as enjoyable as some other lite beers I've had. After a few pints, I found that I still didn't even have a buzz - come to find out, this beer has only 3.5% abv. No wonder. I wouldn't recommend this beer to someone who thinks they can get drunk off of it nor to someone who is looking to enjoy their beer."
"Heineken light, err, Amstel light pours a slightly amberish yellow (for a light beer) and the head dissipates quite rapidly. There is no real aroma...at least not that I could detect. Mouthfeel is a bit thin, but the taste is not bad at all. Its pretty crisp, well balanced, and fairly drinkable. I've had this numerous times, and it seems like there is an odd metallic taste to the first few swallows of this one, but it seems to mellow out the further down the bottle (or I just get used to it). I prefer this one over its big brother with the red star, but still not one I would seek out regularly."
"As far as I'm concerned, the Netherlands can keep Amstel. And Heineken too, Goddammit!"
"Went out drinking with a friend who says this is his favorite beer. Personally I tend to drink heavier beers and love sitting in the beer isle at Lee's for about an hour before making my desicion. But we had just worked out and I was thristy and something light sounded pretty good. Plus i need to keep my girlish figure. I didnt bother pouring it in a glass, well, because i wasn't given one and didnt think this beer really needed it. It smells like a basic macro. Taste is nothing to write home about but i was suprised. It had almost a little sweetness to it. mouthfeel was crisp, light and refreshing and you could easily drink a few of these. It is basically is a typical light macro, but it's at the top of the list as far as those go."
"Drinkabilty: Perhaps my review is slanted towards the positive side based on the fact that I am usually parched when I drink this beer. It isn't horrible, but they usually disappear quickly. I just don't see the hype. Why pay more for a bad import when you can have bad beer cheaper by buying American crap?"
"If I get another chance at a luxury suite, I think I'll go with Amstel Light."
"An openly light beer. You pour this one anywhere and it could pass off as something else. a faint, yellow colour and a very small foam head. Youd expect some smell to be perceivable but you can notice <<something>> after a while. The taste is no better: a poor taste where the most perceivable factor is a faint bitterness. Heck, i had to buy this to get change to pay for parking my car. i sure won't buy it again."
"Extremely grainy fragerance--smells much like it looks--straw water. No noticeable hops, malts, or any other flavor. Watery and thin. If you are one of those people who pay 1.25 for a bottle of water out of a pop machine you'll probably like this. If ever offered this, Im passing."
"Mouthfell is somewhat thin which is expected for a light beer. If I was forced to only drink light, this would be an ok choice. Luckily we are free to choose!"
"Bland, a bit corny, a bit adjuncty, may have some hop flavour.... i couldn't tell. A touch bitter i suppose. Tastes like sparkling mineral water. Just an even lighter version of Amstel (the normal stuff), which sounds dissapointing, and it is dissapointing, but, to be truthful, i wasn't expecting much in the first place, its hard to right something about it in detail, boring."
"Not a bad brew, Amstel just needs to address that aroma/taste issue, but not a good brew either."
"pours out a clear, extremely pale straw colour...a thin head appears and leaves a bit of lace. aroma of euro lager grainy malt, with a slight bit of skunk for good measure...actually doesn't smell that bad. well....the aroma is the best part of this beer, because it really is lacking in any redeemable flavors. some weak fizzy grainy notes and a ghost like hop crispness in the finish. it really is a weak and crappy beer. really. there is no reason to believe that this is a quality beer, even among the ""light"" ranks. save your money and buy any domestic light beer and you won't be able to tell the difference. this is bad as mich ultra, except for a relatively nicer aroma. ugh."
"Pale yellow with a thin white head. Crisp, clean taste with little real character other than a grain sense and a thin, watery mouthfeel. This beer has much in common with many American light lagers from the macro brewers, but cost more than domestics. I'll give it an extra point or two for the attractive can."
"My first Amstel Light will also be my last."
"But it will never truly be enough."
"This is probably the plainest, clearest beer I've ever seen. The head dissipated immediately and left no lacing. The smell was dominated by a skunky grainy aroma. I could pick out a little bit of malts in the taste and maybe a bit of hops bitterness but it was pretty boring. The aftertaste was a little bitter with a sort of corn like taste to it. The mouthfeel was highly carbonated and not very enjoyable. I would not drink this beer again."
"Presentation: Packaged in a twelve-ounce brown glass euro-style long neck bottle with a pop-off crown, server in a Pilsener glass."
"The beer pours archetypal lager color a translucent gold, the head impressive in size, brilliantly white in color, the texture creamy and the lace a nice fine clinging sheet to conceal the glass. Nose as expected, all malt, crisp, clean and lightly sweet as it the start. Top is skeletal, the finish is perkily acidic, the hops sparse, but at least present, dry aftertaste, and a decent if altogether to Light for me beer, but not at all bad."
"Pours a clear pale golden straw color with a foamy white head that quickly fades away. Nose is very similar to American macros. Taste is quite bland with a bit of corn and a faint hop bitterness. Finish is crisp. A pretty boring beer. Its a lot like drinking a glass of tap water."
"Personally, if I were to choose a light beer, I think I would go with Sam Adams Light. It seems to have more of an aroma and a better overall body...well, as much body as a light beer can have. But, I will drink the Amstel and enjoy it for what it is. Even if it isn't much."
"el_mocoso"
"Cheers"
"the taste is lacking, but it is bitter with some malts to it. it really does not have too little flavor for a light beer, but you know how it goes. the carbonation is also not overpowering which i find pleasing. you can drink it easy."
"Clear. Straw gold in color with a bright white head that holds well for a light beer. The aroma is of an herbal, lightly earthy, hoppiness. The body is light with a median carbonation. The mouthfeel is fairly crisp. The flavor expresses the same herbal hoppiness as the aroma, well entwined with a light, grainy and dryish malt. It lingers dryly in the mouth with more malt and hops than bitterness. Not bad for a light beer."
"Let me put it this way, I had a free bottle at a reception and dumped it. If I dump out a beer that I didn't pay for, you know there is a problem. No redeeming qualities whatsoever (unless you count not being an A-B product)."
"On pouring, it is slightly darker than other light beers, but the head falls flat quickly. There are no percievable hops in the nose, only that bad-beer smell. It's way too carbonated, and the condition is only made worse because the beer is really thin and watery. Slight bitterness from hops in the finish along with something else that can only be described as a grain related taste. The only reason I'd get this is because Dennis Miller did some ads for them. Otherwise, I'll leave it for those who believe Import = good."
"Know how you can jam 6 skunks in a bottle...me either, but Amstel knows how.  It smells really skunky.  Pours a really clear golden hue with a 1 1/2 finger white head that dissipates rapidly.  Fortunately the flavor isn't as skunky as I first thought from the smell, but there's at least 1/2 of a skunk in there.  Maybe a tad of corn taste in it as well.  Extremely watery mouthfeel, that might be okay on a severely hot day.  It is drinkable, but say PBR is way way better and for the price, why bother with this stuff.  I can't believe I did."
"For a ""light beer"" this is excellent because it tastes like real beer. By that I mean it has a noticable hop nose and thirst-quenching hop bitterness, and a faint but discernable malt character with no noticable adjunct taste. This is what a light beer should be. Light, easy drinking and actually taste like a beer.  I also appreciate the brown botttle. It does help reduce the formation of skunky flavors and I can tell a difference in Amstel Light."
"Not the worst beer I have ever had.  Decent color.  No aroma nor real flavor, and definately not my favorite brew, but when I feel concious about my figure, this is the direction to go!"
"Light golden hue and clear, topped by a head that persists better than a typical adjunct - laden macrobrew light.  There's actually a hint of a noble hop nose, while a mellow and clean graininess in present in aroma as well.  Lightly bodied, but not as thin as Budmillercoors light. The hop bitterness is above the norm for style, and adds to the drinkability of this brew. As expected for such a light beer, malt complexity is lacking, but the lack of offputting adjunct flavor contributions make this beer quite drinkable and clean for a light. The grist is probably all barley malt.  Although light beer is my arch nemesis, the Dutch managed to eek in flavor in Amstel light."
"Eurotrash. This beer looked fine and inviting, pale copper color, thin white head, that vanished. Then the awful skunky smell, metallic, bitter, harsh taste. Just bitter taste watery, and acidic, then nothing on the finish.  I may have had a bad can, but this beer is lousy and sadly overrated. I can't agree with the ""beer drinkers light beer slogan"". It will be hard for me to try anything else from Amstel, despite the favorable reviews. I can't believe people ask for this."
"Not bad for what it is, and better than most for style.  Aroma is quite pleasant.  It has flavor with a nice European quality, just not enough.  All light beers are too heavily carbonated for my taste and this is not an exception.  It's a light beer, and understanding that I'd rather drink this than most any other, certainly any U.S. made one that I have tasted."
"They advertise this as the beer drinkers light beer. I don't know what they are talking about.  This beer starts promising, with a nice amber glow, and moderate head. It quickly falls short. The flavor is bland, and somewhat spritzy.  I just doens' t have much flavor!"
"I am not much into light beers.  I found this beer to be better than Heineken, which I am not a fan of due in large part to the skunky smell.  That smell isn't as prevelant in this beer which makes it easier to drink.  Would still tend to look for a different light beer than this one, however."
"I was disappointed with this beer.  I guess I bought in to the TV adds, so Amstel, you got my $9.99 for this 12/pk, but don’t look for any more.  Skunky smell hits you before the beer ever reaches the mouth.  Then the skunk smell carries over to the taste, and I swear if I didn’t pour it myself, I would have thought I was drinking an aged Schlitz."
"First thing you notice when you lean in for a sniff is that it's kind of skunky. If you can keep your nose close enough long enough, you start to notice a little maltiness and hops peek out of that skunk's ass. Then the skunk high-tails it into the flavor. After a few sips you get used to ol' Mr. Skunk and don't notice him as much and you realize that the commercials are right: it doesn't really taste as bland as most light beers. It's got some definite malt presence with some citrusy notes but it also has that unpleasantness (separate from the skunk) that Heinekin also has, but I can't place it exactly. Basically, I wish it was a light beer so it wouldn't be so damn hard to drink fast because it becomes near undrinkable when it starts to approach anything resembling warm."
"This is usually the best choice of wedding beer swill.  I like it in relation to the AB's and Coors products.  it is overpriced and has a slight skunk overtone.  But for a light beer it does have flavor.  And that is what is usually lacking in this style any flavor at all.   This past weekend a friend brought a twelve for the sailboat cruise and I found it quite drinkable.  I would not be a regular customer, but will buy it as the ""non-beer snob"" alternative for my parties at the shore....  My wife along with my friends without taste will drink it....."
"Notes: Not much of a beer to hoot about, just an other ""run of the mill"" light lager. At around $20-24 a case ... you are better off buying a domestic light lager for around half the price. Great marketing and riding with the imported lager trend have made this less than decent brew a big seller in the US."
"One of the better tasting light beers, but still nothing too spectacular. If you are going to be drinking cheap light beer, you might as well go buy a case of Nattie or Beast for a few bucks less. Also, it seems every other case has a few skunky brews in it."
"I’ve never understood the popularity of this beer.  If you want a light beer, why bother with an import that is always partially skunked, and not very good in any event.  I am mystified when I see a male drinking this beer.  The only message you are sending is that you are vain, worried about your “shape,” and not real bright: my feeling is if you’ve got a tool, you damn well better build a shed over it.  If you are worried about the calories, get a Guinness, and get a life. Brown bottle, bad euro/skunk taste and aroma."
"Golden in color, very light taste, not as watered down as Coor's for sure! If I was weighing close to 300lbs, I would choose this over the other light's that I have tried."
"A very average beer, but good as far as light beers go.  Some light malt taste is there, albeit very light and there are some discernable hops on the finish.  Very drinkable, but for the same amount of money, you can buy so much better."
"This was a gift from a friend since I never had it, I see why now - way too light and watery.  After a taste, a shot of dark rum dressed it right up and made a very drinkable drink."
"alittle heavier tasting than other light beers, but with a light peppery aftertaste. not bad but not great."
"Nothing bad about this beer, but nothing particularly good, either.  Certainly does not merit paying import price."
