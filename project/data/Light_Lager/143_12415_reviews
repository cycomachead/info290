"This beer came in a variety 6 pack of Shiner and I wish they would put something better. This beer is very bland and boring. I poured it out and it was a light yellow color with a medium head. The smell is of malt and some wheat. The taste is pretty watery to me. It has a little bit of malt and thats really it. The mouthfeel is pretty average. It is pretty crisp and a bot of carbonation. Overall this beer is not that good. I do not really care for light beers and this didnt help change my views."
"Overall impression: Doesn't look like much and kinda flattish, but definitely a solid choice for the style. I may give this one another shot sometime and see if a better cap seal improves things."
"This review is short and sweet. This is a typical light beer with some more flavor. If you don't like lights don't drink this one it's no different. Nice look with a puffy white head. Smell is sort of malty and sweet. Mild malt flavor kind of like corn. Decent carbonation and very, very smooth and drinkable. Low ABV and the $ of Shiner(especially the variety pack) make for a good choice for macro drinkers to jump into the world of craft brewing. Most of Shiner beers are not too over the top and this is no exception. Good beer Spoetzl Brewery"
"Probably one of the better ""Light"" beers I've had. Pours a plae amber color with a decent head as the slight scent of malts tickle your nose. Upon drinking there is complex malt taste which leaves the beer weaker in taste but still has a rather indepth texture to it that finishes rather smooth. Something better to try than the ol' Miller Lite and Bud Light."
"D: 4.5"
"Overall, a typical lager. Very macro like. Nothing out of the ordinary here. Easy drinking on a hot summer day but that's about it."
"I don't like light beer - but this is better than Coors Light, Bud Light, Busch Light and any other light beer I've tried. Lighter abv (4.0%) than the before mentioned consequently a bit smoother. Can't give drinkability a higher score as I got it in a Shiner Family multi-pack, there4 haven't drunk it enough to know how drinking it as a session beer would affect me."
"Overall its ok to drink and at 4%abv, not a problem there."
"Fairly good. A little too dry, but not bad for a light beer."
"Notes: For a Light Lager this one is not bad at all just a little boring but so is the style really."
"The beer pours a clear yellow color with a white head. The aroma is strong grain with nothing else being present. The flavor is better than the aroma, but is still nothing special. I get some grain and wheat, as well as some sweet malt and some grassy hops. Medium carbonation and light mouthfeel. Not terrible, but nothing worth seeking out unless you really like light lagers."
"Like washing down a piece of white bread with mineral water."
"d: watery. very drinkable, that's its best attribute."
"Scores are per style."
"Would drink this again if it was offered to me, won't be buying this stuff."
"Notes: I may come off a bit critical here but I do think they hit on the style just fine. Its quite refreshing but really just tastes like a light malty carbonated soda in my opinion. Still its definitely better than some of the standard offerings for the style."
"Best light beer I've had so far... Give it a try if you are looking for a light beer."
"for a light beer, this is pretty impressive. keep it on the cold side. rates high within it's style."
"It's clean with good carbonation but i'm going to have to take the calories over this. Bland."
"D - could probably sit around and drink these one after another...but don't know why i'd choose to do that?"
"D: Tasty, goes down very easily, not too filling, very mild kick, very good representation of style, normally when you see ""light"" on a beers label you anticipate it to be a shadow of anything good, but I was pleasantly surprised to find that this beer is well-worth pounding down for a long time."
"Poured from a bottle in a mixed six pack into my favorite pint glass. The light straw color and one inch head was pretty nice for a light brew. Smell was bright with not much offensive typical adjunct smell. Taste was right down the middle as well. Mouthfeel was light and drinkability was there. All in all not bad for a light. Lawnmower quality for sure."
"Drinkability: A surprisingly decent light beer. While certainly not a stand-out in any way, this beer is pretty refreshing and really drinkable. You could do FAR, FAR worse in a light beer."
"D: Easily could drink a lot more than one."
"If not for the diacetyl flavor, this would be a decent beer. Unfortunately the predominant flavor shouldn't really be the show stealer it is."
"Better than budlight, I would drink it again, but it's not as cheap as budlight."
"D: For the style, this is pretty good. I'm not going to reach for it over any other Shiner, but if I'm specifically looking for a light beer, I'd choose this over the usual suspects. Honestly, I should probably rate it higher just because I don't know where it could pick up points and still be in style."
"Drinkability: Not too impressed. I wouldn't get this again."
"This is the one (thus far in my experience) to drink if you must have a light beer."
"A decent light beer."
"Notes - This is the first time I've had this beer, and I'm surprised it's as good as it is, with the 'light' label and everything. Trying to diet by drinking crappier beer just isn't worth it, but if you feel the need to do so anyway, then this is the beer for you. Now if only they could make a gluten-free beer that was as good..."
"Drinkability is an easy-going affair, but there's not much here to keep one's attention."
"Pours a clear, golden/copper color. 3/4 inch head of an off-white color. Good retention and poor lacing. Smells of pale malt, yeast, grain, and slight hops. Fits the style of a Light Lager. Mouth feel is smooth and crisp with a high carbonation level. Tastes of pale malt, yeast, hops, and slight wheat. Overall, this is one of the best Light Lagers I've ever had. Good flavor, nice blend, and easy drinkability."
"Verdict: This is still a step, albeit not a massive one, up from Bud/Miller/Coors Light. Despite being pretty bland and boring, I still think this beer still serves it's purpose. Texans used to the normal light beers aren't going to be scared off by this, and hopefully they'll start exploring the rest of the Shiner line and beyond."
"Drinkability: This gets a five for being a great light beer. It's drinkable and refreshing enough to pass for a light lager, but doesn't compromise too much on flavor. This is a beer that shouldn't be ignored simply because it says ""Light"" on the label and is well worth a shot."
"Pours a crystal clear golden color with a fluffy white head. Lots of carbonation bubbles in the glass. The smell isn't too appealing, some very sweet honey malt aromas, but it resembles a stale beer on a bar room floor type smell. Taste is ok, it starts off with a good sweet malt flavor and then finishes with some earthy hop flavors. Very simple flavors and well balanced. I kept getting some metallic tang tastes, not on every sip, so it might just be me. Carbonation is a little too high, sound like pop rocks are going off if you hold a sip in your mouth. Drinkability is good."
"The taste falls somewhere in between that caramel corn that comes in those big-ass tins at christmas time and some burnt white bread toast. It is actually a pretty flavorful light lager with nice carbonation. Refreshing and crisp. Not that I reach for a light lager very often, but this is not a bad choice for the style."
"D- Definitely drinkable. I may even like this one better than the standard shiner bock. While I think it has less flavor, it's cleaner and more drinkable, which is usually what I'm looking for anyway when I turn to Shiner."
"Pours a deep gold color. Looks really good of a light lager. Big rocky white head that dissipated quickly. Leaves way more lace than I would have thought. Smells faintly of grain and pale malt. I can taste some pale malt notes barely, maybe some hops? Since this is a light lager I didn't expect much, and I didn't get too much flavorwise. Still, this beer has more character than Shiner Blonde (oddly). Probably the best ""lite"" beer I've had."
"Shiner definitely has a victory with the light beer circle in my eyes, but it's far from their best offerings."
"Drinkability: Not so bad, actually! A light beer that isn't entirely devoid of character and flavor."
"Drinkability? I'd take this over most of the Light beers I've tried. That being said, life is too short to put just about any of the style in a regular rotation."
"D) Eh. Got one in the family pack, I'll drink it, but doubt I'll ever order one."
"Overall, weak in aroma and flavor. Rather have a BMC. Don't recommend. One and done."
"Not bad at all. I was not expecting much, but this is an enjoyable beer. Something for the hot summer months, ball games, or BBQ. It blows the other light macro lagers out of the water."
"This is my least favorite Shiner (it's a little boring) but it still far exceeds the macro 'lites'. Happy 100th, Shiner, congratulations and Prosit!"
"Pours a small whitish colored head, very quickly diminishing. Light amber colored body, fizzy, very clear. Somewhat nutty, very malty, pilsenery aroma. Light aroma, typical aroma of a light lager, not very appealing. Nutty taste, nutty carbonated aftertaste. Light mouthfeel, somewhat creamy body. Pretty clean aftertaste. Has that acidic taste, I find often in lagers. Might be more refreshing after a long hot activity."
"Lots of carbonation is felt, but this is a very drinkable light lager. I don't usually care for light beers but this one has its time and place...not to hate on BMC here but I would much rather my friends bring along the Shiner Light for gameday than the typical offering of Coors and Miller."
"Atmosphere is serviceable. Flavor is not bad, but not really there either. I have the same enthusiasm about the feel. Okay quaff."
"Overall this is pretty much a macro like beer from a micro brewery in an attempt to draw in drinkers of macro beers. Not a great beer, but I guess it does what it was intended to do."
"Out of a bottle this beer was a 14K gold color with lots of visible carbonation. The head was cream-colored, retained itself well as a cap and left scattered lacing. The aroma was pretty much a light version of standard macro lager smells. The flavors were very washed out, dry grains, pale malt and lager malt, all bleached away. The body was medium. The mouthfeel average and the carbonation a little prickly. Sadly, the way it looked was the best part."
"This is basically your average macro light lager nothing special at all about it. It smells a lot like a bud light with grainy malt scents. Things are still kinda hohum boring with the taste the same grainy malt comes out. The mouthfeel is light and refreshing though which is good. This wouldn't be my first choice for a beer. I would rather drink this than a Coors light though durring the summer."
"This is a very good light beer. It pours a very nice looking clear, amber color. The smell is lightly hoppy. The taste is not heavy and there is a slight crisp malt that is balanced with a slight bite of the hops. No real special flavors. Natually, if you are looking for a beer that has a lot of flavor, this would not be your brew. But, if you are in the mood for something refreshing that also has some taste, this is a very good choice. Further, the beer goes very well with food, such as pizza, as it has just enough flavor to do so. Since the beer is fairly light, this would be an ideal brew for a hot day (which is most days here in central Texas) out by the pool or just hanging around."
"Average lager color, medium to light head."
"Texas makes the best light beer of all time."
"Not a bad light lager, just lacking depth. Pours out to a rich yellow color, with a foamy head that quickly calms to about 1/16th of an inch. Some lacing. Aromas are weak; kind of smelled like wet cardboard mixed with malt and some hops. Taste was fair, but unremarkable; maltiness, bread, hints of hops and dried sugar cane. Mouthfeel was zesty and refreshing. Drinkability is north of average. A touch more on the flavor, with some more complexity, and this would be fantastic. Nonetheless, it's not bad. Special thanks goes out to assurbanipaul for the sample."
"Overall this is quite the treat, i am very suprised with this. Very tasty and i would get it again, matches with my favorite lights, abita and sam adams. good stuff. for its style, i think its the best this brewery makes."
"Even then this is summertime, fetch me a cold one, beer. It does have a tinge of malt standing out but that doesnt make it a must try."
"Wow, I was impressed by this one, for what it is. Pours a brilliant gold color, with a decent head retention. Not much aroma going on here. Faint tastes of bread dough in this beer, not much else, a touch of hops here and there, but that's about it. Mouthfeel is wonderful for a light beer, it's acutally kinda thick, not thin watery crap. Very drinkable, especially on a hot Texas summer day."
"Pours to a quickly disappearing head. Color is pale copper color with a dirty brown tinge. Aroma is weak but nicely malty. Flavor is watery and dry with a little fresh Munich malt shining (no pun) through. Hoppiness is there for balance only. Finishes clean. Looks dismal, smells nice, tastes weak and finishes like a regular Shiner Bock."
"12 oz. brown bottle, a beer from the texas sampler from assurbanipaul. Noticably darker than many light beers, make than almost any light beer i have had. not much head, just a little layer of foam. Grassy malt dominates the scent, which is not very profound. For a light lager, this is very flavorful and malty. If this was available here (I haven't seen it anywhere, except here) I would see me making this my extended session beer."
"Presentation: Packaged in a twelve ounce twist-off brown glass longneck. Served in a standard pint tapglass."
"Another beer that I'd call a ""premium light beer"". Color is light amber with average head. Smell is lightly malty, but nothing to get excited about. Taste is nice and malty. Basically this is Shiner Bock light. Very full for something labled as ""light"". Drinkability is very good. All in all this isn't spectacular, but very good for a light beer. I'd drink it again without complaint."
"12oz. bottle poured into a pint glass. It pours a very light copper color with one finger of head. There is a little bit of lacing. The smell is a little malty and grassy, but not too much going on there. The taste is a little sweet with some caramel flavors, not much hops or anything else going on. The mouthfeel is light and watery. The drinkability is good though. It's just there."
"When i don't wanna get that 'full' feeling on a hot summer day, i'll grab for the Shiner Light, otherwise, i'll take the original or just something else."
"Mouthfeel is rather watery but palatable, indeed, very drinkable. Not my favorite style but better than any other light beer I've tried. If you are to judge beers strictly within the style, this has to receive high marks."
"Shiner Light comes with a medium-sized, white, noisy, coarse head and a clear, orangey/amber body. Dusty, tangy nose is just a little grainsy, just a little sourish. The front is a touch fruity, thinning through the somewhat watery middle to a surprising finish: some evident hops and grains. Just a little metal. This is not bad. Actually, it's not too far off Shiner Bock. A decent, fairly tasty, light beer."
"Mouthfeel was strictly average. Like most light beers, it was HIGHLY drinkable. If you are tired of the usual light beer parade and want to try something a little different, this a good one to pour. It's only available in Texas right now, but I would imagine that Shiner will expand distribution if this beer becomes popular. My guess is that it will be."
"Pours a very clear pale golden amber color with a short white head that quickly dissipates into a thin and wispy lace. Nose is rather clean with some notes of grain and some underlying semi-floral aromas. Very light and crisp in texture with a moderate amount of active carbonation. Taste begins with a sweet grain flavor that begins to turn bitter as notes of grain husks begin to express themselves. There is also a bit of a steely metallic flavor that becomes more pronounced towards the end of the taste that eventually gives way to a light lemony hop bite. Nothing special, though for a light beer, this is a step up from the macros."
