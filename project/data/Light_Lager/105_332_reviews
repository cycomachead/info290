"4/2/15 (Draft - Finley Dunnes Chicago) - Pale pour, no noticeable aroma. Minimal taste and feel, smooth and clean taste and feel."
""
"Not terrible but definitely lackluster"
""
"Very pale yellow with a bright white head just your average lite beer nothing special or amazing nice refreshing summer drink and not too bad of a price definitely not terrible but not extremely good either"
""
"They donate to the uncf should I say more?????"
""
""
""
"Beer pong beer is what it's good for"
"Just a very average beer. Not as bad as many mass produced light lagers on the market, but still nothing I would buy on my own."
"If you want to drink a lot, it is a good option"
"Make this short a sweet. It's a typically light beer, meaning it is easy to drink and refreshing but there is nothing exceptional about it. It's a good easy summer drinker, and it's decent as far as many beers of this style go, but exceptional it is not."
""
"Good light beer original that started it all"
""
""
"This beer tastes like gold."
""
"My favorite lite beer for casual drinking."
""
"Not a bad beer but hey, you get what you pay for. Better than Bud and Coors."
"Not as bad as i expected."
"This is not a great beer, but it's the best of the light macros. Way better than Coors or Bud. This is the only light beer that I can truly enjoy casually drinking besides Sam Adams Light."
"Best of the macro lite beers."
""
"Lite gold with white head. Corn bread notes and flavor. Drinkable corporate meh..."
""
""
"Taste and looks like dirty water.i wouldn't drink it if someone paid me too! Just horrible"
""
""
"My first favorite beer when I was a kid....crappy but better than BL."
""
""
"This is the worst of the macro lites."
""
""
"It's passable on a hot day in the sun"
"This is my go to everyday beer. Light refreshing. Going to a football game. Shotguning a beer. Golfing or just hanging out, this is my beer of choice."
"Looks pale yellow, medium carbonation. The taste is not bad at all but it is lacking in flavor. Comes across watery with a little bit of hop flavor at the end. Extremely sessionable and also affordable."
""
""
""
""
"Yuk, this is really bad."
"There are no words for this beer."
""
""
"Awful,awful, awful, just awful."
"Miller lite always tastes like ""beer"". Not sure if that makes sense but it seems that every time I have one I think to myself this is exactly how beer is supposed to taste."
"Very bland tasting lager. Not worth the effort to drink."
"Taste: Taste is exactly how it smells like carbonated water."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"another watered down mess of a beer"
""
"Commercial beer. Consistent in flavor and look can after can or bottle after bottle."
""
""
""
"Cheap crap to keep around for the visitors you don't like."
"Coors light is way better"
"Great lite beer for price"
"Pours a near clear yellow with little head. Not a lot of smell either. Or taste."
""
"Meh quality meh taste meh look.  Cheap. Get what you pay for."
"This is the best tasting lawnmower beer and everyday drinker.   Gives least amount of hangover and has best taste for any American style lite beer.  Best beer for a night out drinking 4+ beers and not feeling bloated and sick that night or next day.  If you are in a situation where you are drinking for a long period of time, there is simply no better choice."
"Out of the AAL category, this isn't too bad (especially compared to light beers). At least has a good amount flavor compared to the other light beers. I'm reaching for this over Corona, Dos Equis, Heineken, Coors Light, and Bud every single day if that's what's available. By far the best light beer."
""
"It's the bag of chips for beer. Where you buy a bag of chips for the snack contentc you mostly get air, you buy miller for the beer and get water."
"It's ok for what it is."
"I love this beer it's got great taste for a great price."
""
"All depends on your expectations. Good beer to drink a lot of. Way better than bud light or coors light."
""
"why did I drink this"
"Miller Lite, one sip and you'll know it's Miller Lite.  Pretty distinctive taste, you can taste the watered down feeling of the beverage.  Here in the Midwest (Chicago/Milwaukee area) it's quite popular and served at virtually every bar in the area."
"Exceptional at the very best"
"Overall: It's better than Bud Light. So is most stuff."
"Good look light taste but a little different"
""
"It's a light beer and it's not good"
""
""
""
"I can remember buying this brand when they came in eight packs of the little bottles.  When I was a kid, these little bottles were popular for cruising down the road because of course you could drink them fast, but they also fit in your hand really well and were the best for throwing at road signs and mailboxes.  I think Schmidt big mouth barrels were the best for this, or Mickey's grenades. Hitting one of those signs is harder than you might think because you have to take into account the speed of the vehicle, etc.  So don't knock it."
""
""
"Best Beer I have ever had"
"A very light beer with a decent taste. Good for summer."
"Average light beer and my favorite of all the macro lights.  A little cleaner than the rest."
"Overall, what really is there to discuss about this beer?! It is simple.  It is light.  It is intently mild in flavoring.  Obviously a popular beer for the masses, we've had this one countless times before.  The occasion for rating came at a friend's wedding, and it was used mainly as a palate cleanser between much more satisfying nips of delicious bourbon."
""
""
"trying to have a accurate list of beers ive had, and it sucks that this is on it"
""
"although it isn't my first choice anymore, I still don't mind drinking it. It was my go to in high school and is easy to drink in large quantities. Not a beer to really enjoy"
"Use it like the pink, pickled ginger you get with sushi - as a palate cleanser - and you're on defensible ground. But in any other situation, if you order this over other craft options, then yeah, maybe you ARE a bad person..."
"There is a time and place for it."
"The old school logo tricks me into buying this every now and then in the summer.  I'd put it a bit higher than Bud Light."
"Overall: it is what it is. No off flavors and not offensive but not much different from mineral water either."
"Nothing special here just another watered down light beer. Easy to drink but that is most likely due to the lack of flavor."
""
"My rating is purely from the perspective of AALs. This is my go-to volume-drinking beer when quantity is the name of the game. Calorically-low, decent enough taste to bang down in between higher quality beers also. A mainstay in my beer fridge."
""
"Lite looks like piss. Smells nothing like good beer and has an aroma of old stale keg. But alas lest we forget. It tastes great. I won't drink coors light or bud light but for some reason a 12 pack of lite by miller never seems like a bad decision after they are gone. It just really damned drinkable. Period. I can't say that about whale testicle beer now can I?"
""
"Really bad beer. It smells/tastes like beer that has sat out for a few days, water added, then refrigerated. Maybe the worst beer I have ever drank."
""
"Worst beer I've ever had.  I know that the rating system is never supposed to be all 1s or all 5s, I get it...but there's no hope for Miller with this one.  They should probably just shut down and stop feeding the bros."
""
""
"Classic American beer for holidays"
"I feel like a fool for never reviewing this, as I have had 10,456 of them.  If I give it a bad review, it will make me look like a masochist.  One of things I like about this beer is that I can buy a 30 pack at Costco for 45 cents.  Once I get them home I find them to be either a nice way to start the night (as they don't count as a drink) or a great way to end the night (don't waste a good drink if you can't stand up).  This beer is liquid and not poisonous which gives it good points.  It has little taste and makes me pee a lot which is bad.  Overall I will likely buy 500 more of them this year, so I give it a thumbs up"
"I give Miller Lite a slightly higher overall score because it accomplishes its objective well; it's a cheap, ubiquitous macro beer that doesn't completely offend the palate. There are beers a whole lot worse than that."
"""Less Filling...Tastes Fucking Great"" !!!"
"An average, cheap beer, not much for the connoisseur but for the generic bar-goer"
"This beer is pretty good."
"Moral of the story: If you gotta drink Miller Lite, drink it cold and drink it fast."
""
"decent beer although a bit watered down but for the price you cant complain"
"American Classic.  Good tailgating beer"
"The best of the macro piss beers IMO."
""
""
""
""
""
"Light beer. What do you expect?"
"Cheap beer... I guess that is why it is quite popular among youth. Heavily used for beer games, and hence nobody can ever escape it. I won't be having it, if I was NOT into saving money."
"Why am I drinking this? A waste of good alcohol units"
"Beer pong only. There are better cheap brews out there."
"Throwback can is a plus"
""
"Miller Lite is underrated...it belongs on a different scale, one of its own"
"Tastes like piss, gives me a headache to boot.  Avoid at all cost."
""
"For a light beer this actually has decent beer flavor.  I can taste the malts and even some hops.  But I also taste a corn graininess.  This is a watery beer that is made to be easy-drinking.  Overall it's pretty good for what it is.  If it was all malt this would be NICE.  But alas, it's an adjunct lager.  That's probably why it was so cheap.  Easy to drink a bunch of these ice cold.  Miller Lite gets the job done with low calories and a low price.  The flavor and overall experience are just OK.  But for what it is as a cheap, light adjunct lager it's pretty good."
""
"For a lite beer it is pretty good."
""
""
"Not a fun beer, or enough alcohol to be worth it."
"Best macro light beer. What I drink after a couple of craft beers."

"Overall, good when compared to other macrobrews in its' class, your typical small head pale yellow beer, smelling ever so slightly of hops but mostly just grain, slight lemony grain flavor, with a crisp finish, not what I normally drink but a decent buy compared to Budweiser, Coors, Busch, Natty Light, etc.  Just know the limitations of this beer before buying."
""
""
""
""
"Decent cheap AAL. Good for BBQs, as good as PBR or stag. Taste is not the deciding factor but screw Bud light. Grandpa and old man's go to beer, so I got a nostalgic feeling about it. I would rather have Hamm's though!"
""
""
""
""
"Miller is decent for a macro light. Bought one the other day. Miller is good. Better than bud light as far as taste. Compared to other macro  light lagers this is a good one. More flavor. Ice cold it's a refreshing beer. I rate beers in this category against others in its class. Against Bud and Coors, this one is probably the best. And this is coming from a guy that is primarily a coors drinker. I don't know why i drink it more than miller really. Miller really is better."

"If you like to take a glass, stick it in the toilet after a fresh piss and drink it, then this beer if for you. Smell is non existent taste reminds me of a fresh swim in piss river. Color is light Amber. Would not recommend this beer to anyone."

"I have LITERALLY drank a 1,000,000 of these in my Lifetime, give or take 100,000...so obviously  I DON'T hate it....in fact, I have to admit, since I am NOT and NEVER will be a ""Beer Snob", that I actually kind of LIKE the taste. But as my pallet has ""MATURED"" and as my Income has Grown...I have drifted away from this affordable and handy can of Lite Beer and moved on Bigger, Bolder and Better things... .Today I would rather enjoy a couple of Quality IPA's or Lagers because of the Kick/Higher ABV (because they don't FILL my bladder with water and make me have too Pee ALL night) AND for the taste. Having said that...I will NEVER EVER forget my First LOVE and on a HOT summer afternoon filled with sweat and yard work I will definitely still crank some AC/DC or on the Boom Box and enjoy ""SEVERAL"" of these cold, refreshing, CANS of Goodness :)"

"It's technically beer, and it's wet, and usually cheap. If you want a buzz without great flavor getting in the way, well, here you go. Of the cheapies though (or the kinds of beer my in-laws will drink) this is the least-bad choice."
"Look, I understand the proclivity to drink light beers, especially as one gets older and, ahem, has a bit more of an issue with that pesky midsection.  But for God's sake, try to get something that at least tastes like beer!  In my opinion, Miller High Life is the better route.  It's light enough to trick you into thinking you're cutting those calories down.  Oh, forget it.  Just get something that's beer!"

"I know 99% of people on here love to bash all lite/light macro beers and to some extent I can understand why.  They are not that interesting, have minimal aroma/taste/color.  People say they all taste the same - they don't - similar yes, but not the same.  I you had miller lite, colors light and bud light next to each other in a blind taste test you would definitely be able to tell a noticeable difference.  Why you would want to do a light beer taste test I'm not sure :)  My favorite beers are Heady and Dinner but I also love Miller Lite and I'm not afraid to say it!  Sure, it's not world class by any means but when I'm doing yard work on a 90 degree day it's pretty rad.  Sometimes life calls for a good, old fashioned macro beer!"

"Bottle at Smith’s Olde Bar in Atlanta. My friends (who have no taste) ordered a large bucket of this beer at the bar while watching the Steelers game. Has the appearance and taste of brown water. Hints of corn and malts. Very light bodied. I didn’t want to drink it, but I had to help them finish the bucket. On the plus side, I didn’t have to pay for it."
""
""
"Wow can't believe that I never reviewed this back in the day when I drank it like it was water. To be fair it is pretty close to water. Looks like beer not nearly as impressive as the tv commercials make it out to look but still not bad. Taste not much there in the way of anything. Still will drink this over most other light beers. And in the right company it taste pretty good."
""
"Definitely the worst beer I've ever had.  Some beers thankfully have no flavor (Bud Lite) but this tastes like ash to me.  If you have to drink one please drink it cold, very cold.  Heaven help you if you drink it warm."
""
""
"Not awful, not great but decent. I usually get the aluminum pints for NASCAR races, their convenience is awesome, +0.25 for that."

"A lot of beer snobs out there hate light beer and especially Miller Lite. It seems to be ground zero for the haters. I have made this beer my choice for years. It is highly drinkable and refreshing. You can go all day on this stuff. Have a couple of craft beers then switch to this brew and never leave the party. Maybe get lucky."

"Why the hate, haters? When I want to sit down and drink 11 cans of tasteless corporate america-juice, this swill gets sessioned and sessioned HARD. No hangover, no headache. Just hours of upright drunken delightfulness."
""

"Classic american standby."

"O: Pretty decent lawnmower beer. Good for when you just want ""a beer"" but want to neither think about it, nor get intoxicated (work social functions). For flavor buy something else; for what it is, it's okay."

"This is my go to beer when I’m out partying and not looking to be a beer snob. Miller Lite is what I grew up on. I actually like the smell of it. No real tasting notes to say other than what you would already know. Just an easy drinking beer to have in the clubs."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"It's a Clean beer. It's easy to drink. That's all it is good for really. So many adjunct and light lagers taste just like carbonation to me with like a added sulfury taste."

"This is now my daily driver. It's really smooth and goes down easy and tastes like beer. There's some corn taste to it which I like but it's basically like every other beer. It doesn't give me a lot of horrible poops and farts; just some poops and farts."

""
"This is my go to ""we're going to drink all day long"" beer... Quantity rather than quality. Of the top 3 selling light beers, (Bud Light, Coors Light and this) This on is better than the other 2 options."
""
""
"Worlds first light beer. Still the best one on the market  Wins several gold medals  Miller is the best light beer period from america. It was the first, and does its job better than any other light beer.  less calories and lower abv than all other american light lagers. and retains some of the flavor."

""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall (2.32) : Miller Lite is one of those beers you choose only if your other options are worse than Miller Lite. You do NOT choose Miller Lite as your main beer. To do so is shameful and you should be whipped with wheat and corn shucks. Maybe even a branch or two. For what it is, ""a fine pilsner"" it is not, however a ""decent light pilsner"" would be more appropriate. This has more flavor than the ever popular Bud Light, but BL has the jump on smell and drinkability. Keystone/Coors Light has the jump on drinkability, it is the king of smooth in the light category.  Now what Miller has is the flavor. The flavor, baby. That's the only thing saving it. So if you want a ""dash"" more flavor in your light beer and don't mind chucking the nose and mouthfeel out the window, you may have found your (light) white buffalo."

"A tasteless beer that will bloat you up. I bought a tall can and poured into a glass. Pours golden piss yellow with a white cloud top that don't last long. Tastes like metal and processed corn/malt. Metallic smell of a can. Would make a good lake beer when your broke. Personally this stuff is crap"
""
"O - Fits the style that it is.  Ultra light beer that is nice for hot days in the sun.  Very refreshing.  Not a beer that will fill you up.  If you're not into big flavors, or complexity of flavors, this is a great beer for you.  2.75/5"

"Amongst macro light beers, this is one of the very few (if not only) that somehow manages to squeeze in a pinch of pilsener/helles-like flavor. Since I appear to alone in rating ML based on the fact that it is light, I proudly recommend this as one of the best in the category.  While I've had an occasional micro light lager that surpasses Miller, these have been rare and hard to come by. Obviously, this is not a style commonly braved by craft brewers. Personally, I think this is a pity, as there remains so much unexplored potential... That's right, believe it or not, light beer can actually be good and I challenge any brewers reading this to see if they.have what it takes to manifest such a brew! As it stands, this is pretty much as good as light lagers get. Minus .25 for ad execs spelling like Toys-R-Us kids."
"One of my original favorite beers.  While my tastes have evolved , and I now much rather prefer beers with more taste, I still have a part of me loyal to this old beer.  I've many memories through college and at Miller Park!"

"O: I keep this on the shelf to carry me through the rough times. Start off top shelf, hit the well and the closer comes in the shut it down. Much better tasting than a AB serving. This beer is the guy that bounces between triple A and the Biggs without ever making it into the rotation."
""
"What is there to say about Miller Lite? Nothing, really. It's just so bland. Which is okay in certain situations. But, most of the time you would be better served by something else. If nothing else though, it can say that it's better than Bud Light... which... doesn't say much."
""
""
"Its a light beer and very light in color. Tastes like any light beer which tastes watered down. This light beer tastes better than most other light beers such as Coors Light, Bud Light, etc.. because it has a thicker taste and tastes more like regular beer. However the label lies saying its a Fine Pilsner Beer and its anything but fine. For light beer its drinkable but not something I would prefer to drink or enjoy drinking. Great for parties or events to bring beer to share since its pretty cheap."

"The beer looks good as in there is nothing floating in the beer such as a dead squirrel or an employees toenail clippings so that's a win. The rest is pretty self explanatory. Cheap beer, cheap taste, on a high note, you do get the feeling of drinking water when it hits your palate. I am pretty sure this tricks your mind into thinking your rehydrating. There's the silver lining !"

"O: If I had to choose one of the BMC beers to drink, this would be it. The lesser evil, if you will. There is actually some hop flavor, and I much prefer the use of corn to some of the more rice-laden adjunct lagers. Still, this is a very uninspiring beer and it has little to offer. It's the sort of beer I'd drink if options were slim to none, but that's it."

"Good beer. Probably my favorite light beer out of the big guys - Coors Light, Bud Light, any other light. I drink this a lot when it is on sale or with some die hard Miller Lite drinkers. If I am at a bar and I buy the round with those hombres I buy Budweiser. When it's one of their turns they buy Miller Lite. It's just a great game to play when watching WWF on the bar tv and no hotties are around to look at. It's Miller Time!"
"Overall - not what I want when I want to enjoy a beer, but an extremely refreshing beverage. Truth be told, on a hot summer day when I'm working around the house or in the garden I'll take a Miller Lite before a DIPA 10 out of 10 times. With that said, in the same situation I'd take a Shiner Bock or SN Summer Lager 10 out of 10 times before a miller lite."

"O: Good for exactly one thing and one thing only. If you want to sit around and pound a ton of beer without getting bent, this is not a bad option at this price point. It really is average in every way within the style and other examples have more flavor and less adjunct notes."

"Light golden color with excellent clarity. A fingernail thin layer of white head rests on top. Brussels lacing. Aroma is strongly of corn,but I get a bit of faint bittering hops. Mouth is very thin and highly quaffable. I get corn and some mild bittering hops in the flavor."

"I have had many a Miller Lite over the years but not sense I started on Beer Advocate so decided to drink the one left at my house and do a review. I remember it being one of the better of the big boy lite beers. Anyway, poured it into a glass and already it is not going well. Yellow water? If I wrapped my hand around the glass and then looked in then it looked golden, but that is a lot of help. No smell to speak of, but nothing off-putting. Then the taste, I was disappointed. Nothing bad but nothing good either. I went back and forth in the range of 2.5 to 3 but then thought, I would rather drink water then use of liver function on this. Would only drink if it were the only thing available and I felt the need to be sociable."

"The fact is, it is cheap beer. If you are wanting a beer and not wanting to spend money, this and Corona Extra are going to be your best bets. If this is your first time drinking, Miller may be a good choice simply because it is pretty easy to drink and doesn't overwhelm you with the ""beer flavor"" which you may not like at first, but will crave eventually."

"Pours a straw-yellow in color with a good 1+ finger white fizzy head that settles down to a thin layer on top and sides of the glass. Some spotty lacing is seen. The aroma is of some light grains, nothing else really. The taste is the same that is on the 'watered down' side but goes down easy with no harsh or bitter aftertaste. A classic cheap beer when you don't have much money for a good craft brew. LOL!"

"In terms of widely available, cheap light beer, this is the lesser of the evils. More flavor and character than Bud Light or Coors Light, or the dreaded Natty/Keystone...although that isn't saying much. In comparison to alternative domestic light beers, Miller at least has some hop character to it. Pours with some foam, possesses somewhat of an aroma, albeit minimal. Redeeming qualities to this beer are that it's cheap, it's light enough to drink in high volume for games or long days of consumption, and in comparison to other domestic lights, it actually tastes somewhat like beer."

""
""
""
""
""
""

"Cheaper beer had it served in a pint glass. the beer has a nice gold color and goes down smoothly. If you enjoy craft beers stay away from miller lite. You get what you pay for. Taste is malty and hints of grain. Not a fan of miller at all. you get what you pay for"
""
"You basically get what you pay for with this beer. It is a mass-distributed beer that doesn't really have anything special going on for it. It tastes along the same line as a Bud Light or Coors Light. If you are interested in a beer with not much flavor, get one of these"

"One positive note is that when drinking Miller Lite, I have never got bloated, and it makes it good for things like barbecues and parties where food is being served. Another positive note about Miller Lite is the pour technology, which reduces head and foam."

""

""

"There are not much positives when it comes to Miller Lite. In terms of taste it goes down smooth and quick. The problem for ML is that when put in a competition with Bud Lite or Coors Lite it will lose every time. In terms of price, you can get much more satisfying products for either equal to or lesser of a price."

"Watered down cat-piss - unfortunately, the only option at some places."
""
""

"If Miller priced this the same as Natural Lite it would clearly be the winner. But since it's priced the same as Bud Light, I don't think Lite will win anything. Really not a bad beer if your aim is to keep the number of beers you drink at a sitting to well under a six pack."
""
""

""
""

""

"During NFL Sundays, when I need to keep my drinking on a leash, I will drink Miller lite...sometimes. When it's compared to the other major US brewers, Miller is a work of art. It's total shit, but at least there is some taste of beer- you don't give that with Coors or Bud."

"Miller Lite is brewed by Miller. Been around since 1975. One of the first light Beers on the market. Now, first off, they can't even spell Light right, so you all know how this is going to turn out. Pours out a Light Amber Color. The Smell is that of an american style light beer. The taste is nothing special it is light almost like water. Nothing bad, but nothing good. Overall, I give this a 3- not good ,but not bad. I may get this brew to switch it up from the Budweiser products every once in awhile."

"Miller lite is the best adjunt lager you can get.. Offers the most beer like flavor for a cheap easy to drink price.. A/T sweet pale malt and corn, slighty bready, the lightest of hop if really looking.. Rating this beer as a adjunt lager, it is the best you can get.. I drink this anytime I plan to drink more then a few."

"This is my ""cheap go to"" beer. Nothing outstanding, but the taste is just fine. Much better than Bud products. Those tend to give me a headache after a single beer. Miller isn't something you drink just one of and feel satiated, but you drink a handful to get the end result."
""
""
""
""
""
"When you rate this beer you have to compare it to other lite beers. That being said, it has more color than a bud or coors and many others, and has more flavor and a stronger smell than many lite beers. Whether one likes it or not is subjective. Yeah, it probably does taste like water after you've had a few. That's usually the case with ANY light beer. You don't drink a lite beer like wine and sip it for an hour. Most people I know who drink any light beer aren't looking for spectacular taste or want to sit and analyze the flavor sip by sip. They want cold, refreshing alcohol that won't fill them up, and usually its only the first sip of a light beer that I've ever heard, "" damn that's good"". This is basically that, drink it before it gets warm, don't expect a lot of impressive flavor. It's a straight up beer. Few people crave salads, they don't offer excessive and awesome flavor, but its something to eat. Few people crave light beer, but its a beer to drink."

"I do not usually like light beers except Bud light lime and maybe bud light platinum when I want to feel it and quench my thirst at the same time. I love miller lite and hate all other light beers including plain bud light. Miller lite is watery but refreshing on a hot day, the other beers are watery and taste nasty. I am a dark beer fan but I gotta say, miller saves the day when I'm broke, it's hot, and I want beer."

"Overall: This really is a terrible beer. Not much to say about this, because there isn't much too this beer. The appearance is bland and sickly at best, the nose is non-existent and the coldness of serving temperature way overpowers any possible flavor you might get out of this. The mouthfeel was somewhat redeeming, since it made the beer very spritzy- almost like a soda, though with a flavor as bland as this, I think I would have preferred to be drinking that!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The first thing I noticed, this beer smells like a doctors office. Kind of that weird super sterile alcohol smell that makes you think you'll get a super virus. it has a bitter taste with a slightly skunky aftertaste. At least is is pretty smooth so it does have that going for it."
""
"O-I couldn't leave Milwaukee without at least sampling one Miller product.... Anyway, this brew is pretty bland with a light, grassy hop note being the lone highlight as far as taste goes. Flavor aside, the feel wasn't half bad for the style. On a kind of related note, I certainly had better beer on my trip, but the Miller put me in a strangely good mood for my flight as I appreciated seeing one of my good friends tie the knot over a glorious mid-western weekend in Wisconsin and, honestly, good moods have to be worth something."
""
"So I mean it serves its purpose and goes down easy."
"Only drinkable in 90 degree weather. Wouldn't use to make beer brats or water pan in my smoker unless it was the only choice. Don't waste money on this beer if it is beer. Unfortunately, people will only drink this b/c of the light taste and think they'll get hammered faster. Untrue, have one Revolution Anti-hero and see how the buzz goes. Why am I even reviewing Miller Lite?"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Now we all now this isn't a craft beer but I don't think it's as terrible as some of the other beers out there; Bud Light, Coors Light, Corona, Modelo, etc. I would much rather have this beer if I'm going to a party where only BMC's will be available. It is what it is."

"Might as well drink water. Only positive part is the lower calories, but I'd rather have flavor and do an extra set of situps the next day that to drink a couple cans of this honey colored water. If its 100 degrees out and no other choices available, ok, you can polish off 3 or 4 and feel slightly refreshed. Other than that, spend a few extra bucks and get something with heart,soul,and flavor."

"O: This is essentially adult soda. It's light, it doesn't fill you up, and it's really easy to drink when you're standing around at a baseball game with 5 of your closest friends in the heat of a mid-summer night. I wouldn't go out of my way to buy this beer, and I probably wouldn't even make it my second choice... But, if your only other choices are Bud Light, Coors, or another similar light lager, Miller Lite wins by a landslide. It's the quintessential ""lets pound down 9 or 10 of these bad boys!"" light lager."
""
""
"ive long said I would rather drink anything else in the world than a miller lite, and maybe I still stand by that. maybe bud light on principal, but this is pretty bad. its one of those mass market crap beers that's little more than adjunct metallic tasting corn water, although I have no idea whats actually in this beer. I don't mind the mouthfeel, which is well carbonated and maybe a little meatier than some of its peers, but the taste is so minimal and bad. old malt, out of place sweetness, generic yeast, it just isn't very good. I guess for a late night games of kings cup or something it is passable, but at that point there are better options for less money. sometimes the commercials are comical, but that's about all I can really say for miller lite. hope to not encounter this again, but what are the odds of that."

"Taste and Feel: Light grain flavor, with hints of grain husk and sweetness. The carbonation mixes with a slight steely flavor, to produce some sharpness and mouth appeal. The hops come across lemony, with the slightest of tea-like characteristics. Finishes mostly clean with a metallic residual flavor in the back of the mouth and tongue."
""
""
"I had to review this beer because before I ever knew what real beer was this is what I drank maybe once every two months.... I have to say never really liked the big boxed brands in general but Miller light was the best of the bunch... drinkable, clean and not much if any aftertaste. I would not recommend. Try good beer. Bit if you drink a 24 pack a day than drink something that resembles plain water and not skunk."

"This beer has nothing but nostalgia of long drunken nights growing up. The memories of the people and the times we shared is the only reason I am writing this.

""

"Pours very clear yellow color with a finger width foamy head.  Head retention and lacing are minimal.  Sour fruit, bready aroma.  Not too pleasant.  Slight spicy.  Has a very carbonated taste.  Bready, moderate spicy hops.  Not very bitter, though.  Sour fruit taste at the end.  Slightly lemony.  Not much of an aftertaste."

"Of the lights, this one is my preferred. It is light, but still has a bit of flavor. I may be fooling myself, but I think I catch a bit of hops hiding in there as well. While I do not drink it often, I appreciate it for what it is. Just don't let it warm up."

""

"*Overall, Miller Lite is fine. There's nothing wowing about it, but it's certainly not offense in any way. It's main issue is that it's just another run of the mill American lager. It's got only a slight spicy hop note, but that's about all that makes it different from Bud or Coors Light. But please don't bash this beer, even if you are a craft beer drinker (if I wasn't a craft beer enthusiast, why would I be reviewing beers on this site?)."

""
"Love it! Very smooth tasting beer for the unexperienced palate. Beer of choice for the small budget of the college-aged kid. You can drink a lot of this beer. I definitely recommend pouring it into a glass to release some of the carbonation if you do plan on consuming a fair amount. A classic beer that will never go away."

"Tastes like watery malts with no discernible hop flavor. Adjunct flavoring mixes with a corn/maltiness it is easy on the palate and stomach. Very typical for the light beer genre it's obviously create for mass appeal, so it does its job."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Average across the board."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The second of the big three I've reviewed. As with any cheap macro, my scores are scaled to reflect how well the beer achieves its intended style/objective. I must say that although appearance and aroma is somewhat lacking compared to bud light, the flavor is much cleaner and the mouthfeel benefits from an added dryness. This beer does a better job of hiding that it is based on cheap adjuncts and beats out Bud Light in my opinion. Overall, a middle-of-the-road Light American Lager."
"Forced to drink this because my father-in-law swears by it and it is one of the only beers available at football/baseball games. The smell is a very weak one and you can smell the corn and rice they use to brew it. The color is pale golden and it just looks watered down. Tastes very coppery,like I'm drinking the can and not the beer. Overall I really don't like this beer at all and kind of hate myself after drinking one, but sometimes it is either this or don't drink beer at all. Obviously my choice is beer."
"Not bad for a light beer but certainly nothing worth bragging about in terms of creativity and taste."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Well, the ""Lite"" is certainly accurate, very light on aroma and taste before it warms up, and when they do emerge from blandness, they're not a pleasant change. Very easy to drink, and can be enjoyed in an appropriate atmosphere, but overall it's a very unremarkable and forgettable beer. Drinkable, but not really worth picking up."

""
""
""
""

"If you are going to drink a light beer then this is the best one I found so far based on calories per alcholol content and overall taste.

"I thought Miller Lite was actually a very good beer the first time I tried it in a small bar in Menominee, Michigan.It was served in a standard 12 ounce beer glass.

"O=I used to drink Lite a lot when I was younger, mostly with friends and larger quantities, so I was hoping that the reason I drank this so frequently was that it tasted good. I was wrong. Again, this is nowhere near as flavorful as Busch Light, and I will not buy this again...not even for my sister-in-law. I will pair will pizza next time and report any changes."

"It tastes like water from an impure well, but it is also alcoholic and you will start to feel dizzy when you drink enough of it. Its virtue is that it is more palatable than some other domestic beers sold in the USA. That is about the end of it..."

"It was a punch-top Miller Lite with your average appearance out of the can. The smell was barely there and the stuff sloshed around in my mouth with so much carbonation, which I have really begun to accept i just don't like. The taste was very watered down - it was like drinking barley flavored water, and i gave it an overall rating at a two only because the appearance and smell to me was about as good as what I've been trying lately. Again, overall, it's something i'll only drink if there's nothing else to partake of and it's free."

"Single finger white head on a clear straw colored body. Musty and bitter pale malts with light sweet corn on the nose. Flavor is actually plain and not terrible. There is little flavor with grain and sweet corn but there is very little there. Light body and high carbonation. Flavorless really. These get worse as you drink more. Out if coors bud and miller, I still think coors makes te better adjunct lager."

"Rating overall to style, this is a standard fare light lager. Void of aroma, short on flavor, somewhat harsh in feel. A beer not to take seriously."

"O - As far as the big 3 American light lagers, this may be my favorite. It’s not tasteless like Coors Light and it doesn’t have as much adjunct flavor as Bud Light. That’s still not saying much, as this is a below average beer. However, if I had to choose between those 3, I’d probably pick this one."

"I had some people over this past weekend and a couple of these remained in the fridge after everyone left. Pours a Light golden straw color with a decent head that slowly dissipates to a cap on top leaving lots of lace on the way down. Pilsner malt, and a light nondescript spiciness provides balance. There's not a whole lot going on in the aroma here. The taste is lightly bready with a crisp almost tart spiciness that does well to balance any malt that might show up. Thin body with a thin watery mouthfeel and an ample amount of carbonation. There's certainly nothing overly offensive here, but at the same time there's nothing exciting here either. This might make an ok lawnmower beer, but I can think of many with some flavor that I would pick over this."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

""
"O: Easy to drink and sessionable but that is likely due to the fact that the smell and taste are just about absent (and the low ABV). I will likely be avoiding this one (even at the free conference bars) in the future."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Can you say bland? Nothing really offensive here, just a lot of blandness. How people can spend good money to drink any quantity of this is beyond me when there are so many better beers out there."
"O - Miller Lite is basically corn flavored sugar water with alcohol. Although a great cheap beer to use for beer pong, there's almost no other situation when I would choose this beer. Avoid at all costs."

"Miller Lite is much less malty than Bud Light and Coors Light. It is very light bodied, but certainly has flavor. At 96 calories, Lite is a good option for people on a diet, much like Michelob Ultra, at 95 calories. In fact, Miller Lite could certainly advertise as a diet beer like Ultra does. There is some bitterness to Miller Lite, and it tastes like some good quality hops are used. I would recommend drinking Miller Lite from a bottle."
""
""
"Overall: The old advertisements said ""Tastes great, less filling"". It pretty much tastes like any other light beer. as for the less filling...I don't want more than a couple of these at any one time anyway. It is a light beer and that's it."

"Not much of an appearance with about a 1"" head that quickly disappears. Smells like watered down...water beer. Taste like a normal american pilsner which lacks much flavor or imagination. Really crisp and tastes pretty much how it smells and looks. Let's face it, this is a drinking game beer so leave it for the tailgates or beer pong. Unless of course it's free, then the ""free beer"" rule applies."
""
""
""
"O:This is the best of the Light Lagers that I have from any of the big guys. As stated, if rating to style, this is one of the top beers in this category... if I want to kick a midget then yes, I'd rate all of the big guys beers with a 1.5... but this one doesn't deserve it."

"It's hard to believe that just a few short years ago, my beer appreciation began here, and didn't end much further."
"I liked this beer quite a bit when I was younger. However, it just doesn't produce like it once did. Triple-hops brewed means nothing to me nor my taste buds. It's not a bad light beer, it's just okay. I've had some in the aluminum bottles and they are pretty good. Refuse to drink the ones that come in Packer aluminums. It's a lite beer, a classic lite beer from Wisconsin which does score points, but it just doesn't end up in my fridge much."

""
""
"Oh and I always go for miller lite in the beer races on the jumbotron. At least I will until miller chill is added."
""
""
""
""
"O:Good on a hot day, more flavor than Bud Light and Coors Light if that's help"
"O: I've always thought Miller Lite was less offensive than Bud Light. If I ever try Bud Light again, I'll have to compare notes. There are many worse things than to be at a kegger where your only option is Miller Lite. Pretty much the definition of a non-offensive American Light Lager."

"Poured from a 12 oz can into a 9 oz sampling glass from the Miller Brewery. Pours a straw color. Has a white head of nice size, but this disappears quite quickly. Smells of sweet grains, probably from the corn being used in the brewing, but not that strong. Almost no taste at all. Mainly water, but has a slight taste of beer. Goes down smooth, but again, it is like carbonated water with a little beer taste, but definitely drinkable for long periods. Overall, not that great of a beer, but ok considering the style."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, I agree with many that this is a typical American macro brew. I laugh at the new 'triple hops' commercials.... does that mean exactly three hops per massive batch? I taste NO hops in these beers."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: When it comes to light beer I prefer Miller Lite. It's very drinkable, refreshing, and non-offensive. Drinking a few of these is quite easy."

""
""
""

"O-Don't expect to see any of this beer taking up any shelf space in my beer fridge, but I can't kill it. It could use a little more flavor."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: It is, as I and others have already stated, this is pretty much your average macro light beer. In all honesty, if given the choice, I'd probably take this over Bud Light, but I'd probably take a Coors Light before this one, not that there's much difference at all between them, but that's all subjective."

"Obviously a popular brand. I have always felt any kind of light beer taste pretty similar. Had it out of a draft came out looking pretty bright. I would put it slightly ahead of the majority light beers. Goes down easy obviously pretty smooth but not really my kind of beer.

""
"O: This comes pretty damn close to the very bottom of my list of hads. At least I didn't die drinking this, so I guess that's a plus. I don't have too much to say about this beer on the positive side except for the fact I would accept it someone bought me one. It's a drink, and one that you can drink, but don't call it a beer.

"Sure, it's easy drinking if you want to drink 37 beers before you feel anything. Maybe this is like those electric cigarettes smokers use to ween themselves. This beer lets alcoholics go through the motion without totally falling off the wagon."
"Overall - Not a beer for drinking on its own,but does have its place in the beer world. It is higher rated in its ""light"" style category. Good for after a run or when wanting something extremely light with a meal (if meal is really heavy). While I wouldn't drink to enjoy a beer, it has a place when either enjoying food or when wanting a brew to cool oneself down."

"O: well, it fits the style, however, just not for me"
""
""
"O: It succeeds in that it's not offensive to the senses, but it completely lacks flavor. It's drinkable, yes, but it's a case of 'would you really want to?' here. No way in hell I'll say it's a good beer, but it's dirt cheap and doesn't make me hate myself for chugging it down, so mission accomplished, Miller! (FYI, I'm still sticking with Natty Boh.)

"What can I say other then it's a beer to drink at parties when u want a lot of beer for cheap. Pours a straw yellow with minimal head. It has no smell other then my dads breath. It is easy drinking because of all the water. This beer makes me feel good I found craft beer. So yea..."
"Overall: Unless you are cooking brats or playing beer pong, there is no reason to drink this stuff. Even then, you should try a Marzen and Keystone (respectively)."
"Pours a pale yellow color with a light fluffy head. Scent is very earthy and grainy with hints of yeast. Texture is very thin. The taste again has a very earthy taste of grassy grains and corn. I wasn't expecting a great taste but this was the only beer on tap I hadn't had at the bar yet so I gave it a try."
"No thanks. I'd rather drink a Busch. But the tornado bottle, or whatever it's called, is wonderfully silly marketing."
"60."
"Go with PBR, Old Style or Hamm's instead, if this is the swill you're after."
"O- If you enjoy drinking out of septic tanks by all means I'll trade you a case of this for a 12oz bottle of anything decent or a case of natty light. It's that bad"
"I just ""manned up"" so I thought I'd review this. As everyone knows, it's terrible. Yes, it has ""more taste"" than other mass produced American lagers... and that taste is shit. God the only thing that's worse than Miller Lite is their marketing campaign. Keep fighting the good fight Miller."
"Avoid!!"
"I'm not a Bud fan, I'm really not a Coors fan, and I can't do anything less than $10 a case - natty, busch, whatever; unless I'm using it for Beer pong, it isn't much worth drinking. I can always do some Miller Lite, because it's easy to go down, it has a hint of flavor, and it makes me happy. I can drink an entire case, or just enjoy one or two at dinner. It's very easy going down past your palette, it's bubbles make you think it's soda, it's little malt taste makes you think it might be Beer. A session Beer for sure; an enjoyable Beer, not so much. If you're trying to branch out to real Beer flavor, taste, and enjoyment, work towards this one at the very least. If you don't like anything that tastes slightly like malt, hops, barley, or flavor, go somewhere else. But Beeradvocate isn't the place for you either then I guess."
"Overall, it is what it is: a shitty ""pilsner"" that fills the belly of many an ignorant or indifferent American. Don't get me wrong, there is a place for this type of beer (camping, fishing, tailgating), but there are better examples. My go to Adjunct Lager is PBR or even Special Export; a bit more flavor, but still usable for beer-pong or a good old keg stand. Cheers!"
"O - Well, I've tried the ultimate lawnmower beer, and while I'm walking away unimpressed, it wasn't as bad as I anticipated. But... I'll never have this beer again, at least not by choice."
"Just an awful, awful beer. Probably the worst one I’ve ever had. Bud Light and Natural Light are ever better than this."
"I know I've been dogging this product, but in all reality, it's not the worst of the BMC products..."
"Overall this is not a good beer by my standards. I hate slamming beers but this just is not a beer I would ever drink again or suggest to anyone. It lacked taste. I am a fan of full-bodied beers so that probably is why this lacked flavor."
"I had this on draft because my local bar had nothing but BMC and so I caved and bought one with my burger. When I got it, it just looked like your basic boring beer. After drinking tons of craft beers, this beer is ruined. As I drink it, I cant stand the taste at all. It was like drinking cow piss to me. I get about two ounces into it and told my buddy he can have it if he wants. There is just nothing about this beer that is any good at all. It is a joke and I cant belive I even wasted 2 dollars on such garbage."
"O- of the three BMC light beers, this is definitely the superior of the three, but thats not saying a ton"
"O - Best of the BMC group, plus I like their gimmicks ;) Seriously, for the style, the brew is pretty decent."
"Overall, not a horrible beer if you are looking to pound some while watching football."
"Dr: You can down it very easily; frat boys do it all the time. It's cheap and very available - which may be its best feature. However, its ABV is far lower than say, High Gravity Steel Reserve, which costs less per alcohol percentage and tastes a fair bit better. If you're a student looking to get drunk on a budget, this isn't the best beer to go to unless you maybe live in Milwaukee. Avoid this beer regardless of your intention; there are always better brews available."
"no need to fully review this. my go to when i go to a kickback or am gonna play some beer pong. if im going to buy a cheap domestic light beer this is pretty much what im going for. better taste than bud light and not watery like coors light. if anyone can recommend something better let me know"
"NOt the worst beer I've had, but one of hte worst I've had lately."
"There was no noticeable aroma. On the tongue, there was just a very slight taste of grain, otherwise, nothing. Given the lack of scent or taste, the beer had a surprising bit of body. Drinkability was OK for the style. Overall, kind a bland, meh beer. But that kind of describes the style. If you're going to drink a light beer, you can do better, and worse."
"Now, age 48 and definitely into craft beer, I find this as an acceptable beer when you want to break from the norm and want to try something simple."
"Since that day several years back, I have not had a Miller Lite, and would be hard pressed to go back and drink another one. Just an overall unsatisfying beer. If I were aiming to drunk, this would not be the beer of choice."
"If you are reading this review, you are probably doing so to see if I make fun of Lite, and you don't need me to tell you it's a shitty beer. But I will say it anyway, Miller Lite is a shitty, shitty beer."
"O) What can I say about Miller Lite??? They gave us one of greatest beer ad campaigns of all time. The idea to use retired athletes and other celebrities to argue over the beer's qualities was great marketing. I still recall being on one side of gym during a game and yelling back and forth with the other side, Tastes Great! Less Filling!!! Good times... The answer however, is quite clear. This beer is less filling, because it tastes terrible."
"The clear amber color pretty much describes this beer. The intial and amorma is almost a skund beer that made the batch. Most mbe served ice cold to have any reedeming value. The head has a acrid bitterness to it that is not at all appealing. Overall a beer to avoid unless desperate."
"overall: as bad as it is popular"
"Drinkability: At least the bottle has a vortex neck so you can chug it faster."
"I'm supposed to be trying to loose some weight so I thought this is an area I could easily carve out some calories. I picked up a 12 pack of ""vortex"" bottles and decided I better not pour it into a glass but drink directly from the bottle. This was a good idea because Miller Lite looks like fizzy Ginger ale. Its ugly. Drinking from the bottle it has a refreshing beery taste and is aggressively carbonated. No sudsy mouthfeel here. You've got to chug this one right down. No aftertaste but sort of burns your throat. A good choice for drinking early in the day when you're playing horseshoes on the beach and enjoy burping with the guys. I wish MillerCoors would lose the gimmicky vortex bottle and labels encouraging texting to win prizes. In the end it is what it is. I'd buy it again but would advise never to pour it into a glass! See you when I drop 25 pounds!"
"All in all, this is a light beer. Beer gurus shouldn't be reviewing it, because it's not meant to taste like fruit, chocolate, or pine trees. It's a light beer in high demand by the masses, which prevents it from being composed of high level ingredients. So what? Most food you eat is that way."
"taste and looks like water.... no aroma... no head... i hear its very hard to make though and they get it the same every time... i guess that is one positive... oh and they do have good commercials!!!"
"There's very little here in the way of good. Very drinkable, but only if you don't mind the lack of flavor and enjoyability."
"I didn't have high hopes going into this and I wasn't let down. The faint aroma of grain alcohol failed to impress. The faint taste of grain alcohol, corn, and a hint of orange failed even more to impress. It's smooth but that's because it has almost no punch. This ""triple hops brewed"" is a nonsense gimick. It doesn't increase the flavor from the hops at all. I'm sure glad I didn't pay for this."
"O - There is nothing offensive about this beer, but nothing good either."
"Pours a straw-like golden color with lots of carbonation and a bit of foamy head that dissipates to nothing. No lacing. Taste and smells of grains and sweet malts, very faint. Better than bud light, but only good for large quantity drinking. The fact that it has only 96 calories is nice, but I would almost rather drink water."
"Not bad, it's pretty much spot-on for the style, an acceptable enough accompaniment to the boneless hot wings special, here in 'mehrca..."
" This taste is again as the smell promised, not much of anything - nothing terrible except the fact that it seems almost flavorless, gentle adjunct-type sweetness and slight hint of spice which could just be the high carbonation tricking my tastebuds. Overall I can't imagine a beer I would like to drink less of -just seems like the only thing it was good for was cleansing my palate after an order of chili-cheese fries."
"Compared to Bud and Coors, this stuff is just aweful and I don't know how it manages to sell. It goes for the same price as the above mentioned beers but tastes like urine. I would honestly settle for a Keystone or Natty before allowing this stuff to enter my body."
"Not bad. Not too smooth, but a good appearance. Easy to drink and not bad price. I would take i over most light beers but by no means is it one of my favorites. Can get it anywhere that's why I have it most of the time. Smell wasn't too bad either. Overall pretty average."
"So I recommend that you drink this ice cold and from the vortex bottle. That way the bottle can help force this down your throat before it warms to the point where you can taste all the horribleness inside."
"The beer is completely clear with a thin white collar that leaves minimal lacing. The aroma is typical of a macro lager, with sweet grain and corn. The flavor is fairly sweet, with a mediocre grainy taste. One of these is more than enough. Uninteresting and oddly sweet. The body is thin with a solid carbonation level. The finish brings more sweet grain, with a total lack of hop presence. Overall, I will never understand why the masses continually buy this beer."
"Great light beer! I think it has a very distinct smell and taste. It is a balanced light beer which I am starting to think I like more than bud light. It seems to have much more flavor and body. Overall for a light beer would surely recommend! Enjoy all Advocates!!"
"D- This beer has a feel, smell and taste all like lightly sweetened water, leading it to be capable of being consumed in large amounts but nothing interesting enough to keep me coming back."
"The CPJ"
"Miller Lite is not a craft beer. Therefore, judging it by similar standards not only displays inherent bias towards particular styles- it's undeniably moronic. To think that this classic American beer occupies the bottom of the list..."
"O: Easy to drink, but only because there really isn't much to it. Not what I want to be drinking, but won't refuse it if there is nothing else and I am out with friends or at some sort of social event."
"Pours a clear light yellow color with a 1 inch white head that fades to nothing. No lacing whatsoever. Smell is of watery grains and corn flakes. Taste is also of watery grains and corn flakes. Isn't this beer supposed to be triple hops brewed? I get no hop aromas or flavors at all. This beer has decent carbonation that makes for a crisp and clean mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty poor beer but not as bad as some other light beers out there."
"The beer pours a brilliantly clear straw yellow with a moderate bright white head that quickly diminished to a thin skim. The aroma is moderately grainy, a bit of wet cardboard, and slightly sweet. The flavor is moderate grainy malt, very low hop bitterness with high prickly carbonation. The beer finishes quite dry with some lingering cereal like flavor. The body is thin and carbonation high. The flavor and aftertaste become more pronounced as the beer warms, not in a pleasant manner. Overall an effervescent, refreshing lager if drank quite cold, best not left to warm. There are obviously better options out there, but there are also much worse."
"Thanks to my sister-in-law for the opportunity. "
"The type of beer with the sole intention of getting you drunk. If that's what you're after, then you've hit the jackpot."
"Overall: A true testament to the power of mass-marketing. There is nothing really offensive about this beer's attributes but not much good either, except for the thirst-quenching properties in blazing summer heat. However, even for filling that niche there are better options."
"Overall-It's a Miller Lite. It's watery, bland and gives me gas."
"Had they put a ""how much carbonation can we put into a beer"" tab i would have put a 5 because what this beer lacks in ever other aspect it makes up for in carbonation. which is not a good thing"
"A lot can be said for the conditions when drinking a beer. I only remotely enjoy an ice cold Miller Lite after some yard work on a blistering hot day or when I am dehydrated. It is almost like water but with way too much carbonation. Little smell and taste. I recommend. To Avoid this beer if at all possible."
"At this point in the night I saw someone with a Sierra Nevada Pale Ale, which was apparently being served at one bar but not the other, so I abandoned my bad beer reviewing and switched to SN and whiskey for the rest of the night."
"I won't bother with my typical ASTMO review. Pale yellow appearance with small quickly dissapating head. Faint grainy smell that smells almost sweaty. Very light malty taste with a metallic finish. Mouth feel is crisp with a weird carbonation tingle. I am embarrased to admit that in my early years this was my go to. Not the worst ""lite"" beer but won't ever seek it out."
"Taste when cold is largely nonexistent, but as it warms, it has a melded flavor of metallic grain and corn with a very faint hop bite lingering in the background. It is not horrible in of itself, but when considering what a pilsner can be this is almost blasphemy. Not horrible just blah."
"O: Better appearance than its rivals and extra points for detectable hops in the nose but overall a flavorless chalky brew."
"O: This is terrible and I only consumed it in order to not offend my buddy. Please avoid and try not to get trapped into this one."
"Served in the bottle at a bar. Can't see the color, but I can taste the yellow. The vortex allows for maximum flowage. Really splashes nice creamed corn and cheap grain all over my tongue. The triple hops can almost be tasted on the watery finish. This was a good hydrator, now for real beer."
"Overall not impressed, but hey, it's better then the average light adjunct lager."
"Pours a pale golden color with moderate carbonation and a finger or two of frothy white head that dissipates quickly. Weak aroma with notes of skunk, old grains, and bathwater. Tastes about the same: Pale malts, sickeningly sweet, gray water. Very light body, and goes down ""oh so smooth."" To be avoided."
"Miller Lite is the BMC I'd never had before coming to Arkansas. It's very popular here and much less so in California. It's as bad as any other light beer and I only drink it at parties."
"This is just ""another american macro beer"". To bad the amount of money spent on advertising couldnt generate a better beer. Look this beer is golden in color, clear with decent carbonation. The smell and taste is dominated by grain/barley. The mouthfeel is fine. After any sporting activity or workingin thehot sun....this beer tastes great....but when compared to others....not so much."
"Overall. If I am at a bar that only has Budweiser, Coors, and this on tap, I will almost always go for this. Unless the Budweiser is actually Budweiser and not Bud Light. Actually wait...idk. Is there a difference? Miller Lite is ok but not worth the price to buy it by the pack. Better off with something cheaper like Strohs, Old Milwaukee, Schlitz, Milwaukee's Best, Blatz, or Pabst."
"O: not as horrible as I expected to be honest, but this won't be a regular."
"O: Meh, just a macro American beer. Most are similar, and all are not very good. I will never purcase this with my own money, but I certainly will never turn one down, especially on a scorching summer's day."
"O: Bad beer. Only drink if you're mowing the lawn on a hot day and have nothing else around but water. No noticeable, distinguishing qualities; far from the triple-hops brewed slogan for taste."
"A very respectable mass produced light lager. This one takes first place in the battle of light BMC beers in my opinion. Always a good pick me up."
"Nothing to write home about here, it is what it is. An easy to drink beer when it's cold but only a little flavor."
"O- Yes, yes, admit it. A majority of us used to drink this regularly at some point. Let us all take the time to thank the Alstrom bro's for creating this site to save us from beers like this."
"Triple hops brewed huh? We shall see. Pours a wimpy one finger head, completely white. The body is completely see through, tons of carbonation, bright yellow in color. Looks pretty terrible, no real good things at all. As for the smell, it might be the most unimpressive smell I have ever smelled in a beer, which is saying a lot. I mean....I get absolutely NO smell, I mean I am sniffing real hard here and all I am picking up is a tiny bit of malt on the nose, other than that is just smells like water. I mean in some ways I am looking forward to this because it smells super clean and refreshing, and it has almost no smell, so that means it probably has almost no flavor, and if you have almost no flavor, than you can't have to much bad flavor even if it is flavor, right? I guess I'm just looking at the bright side of things, since I've been enduring some pretty bad adjunct lagers recently. I want to give this some point on the smell for smelling what I would call less offensive, but really, less smell, and less taste in any beer is not a rewardable thing. I mean....I'm really confused here, because I enjoy drinking it, it's not a bad thing to drink, but that's because it has absolutely no flavor, it might as well be sparkling water, seriously. I dunno, I can't give it 1.5 in every category, and since BA got rid of the drinkability tab, I guess I have to give it a 2 on taste. I mean if I was just rating it as a beverage I would give it a 3, but as a beer it gets a 1.5, maybe 2 because it has absolutely no flavor. The mouthfeel is ok, considering the rest of the beer is the weakest thing I've ever tasted. Overall...I'm just so confused with this beer, easy drinking, not a horrible taste, but....no taste what so ever. I mean describing what I taste in this beer would actually be insulting to beers than actually do have flavor."
"This is a decent beer. I'm just travelling the USA right now on a road trip and I decided to have a few of these - drank out of the vortex bottles, of course. It's not that interesting and I find it has very little taste and doesn't seem nearly as crisp as comparable Canadian lagers. Also, the abv. can't be compared...it may say 4% but it tastes/feels like 2%, as if it were ""table beer"". Good enough to drink and chill out with on the patio in the summer though. It's not a good session beer due to the low alcohol - would take all night just to get a buzz off this stuff. A respectable American classic in the end, I suppose."
"Overall - not bad tasting, but very very plain and uninteresting."
"O: If it's really hot out, and this is cold, it's okay. If there's nothing left in the fridge, hopefully you had something better before this. In any case, better than Busch Lite, but that's not saying a lot. Great taste? Less filling."
"O: This beer loses big time points because the ""drinkability"" rating has been taken away. Overall terrible."
"Of course no the greatest beer in the world. Allthough this is IMO the greatest cheap ass beer in the world. Alot better than Natty and does not taste like sugar like Bud Light. A great palate cleanser inbetween great beers. I also love drinking this beer on hot days. A great college beer or pong beer. Always good to have a first love until the next one comes."
"Poured a straw colour. Head disappeared too fast for me to really notice anything about it. It had almost no smell. What was there was a hint of cheap malt. The carbonation is high and it seems to be a predominant part of the taste. It's extremely watery, but the little taste that is there is just plain bad. It's like a nasty cracker taste. I'm not sure how else to describe it. Really really bad bread or crackers is all I can come up with. Don't drink this beer. It doesn't taste like beer."
"Overall a typical cheap beer. Nothing special but nothing awful either. Good for what its worth. Not my first choice though."
"Overall- I could drink one of these if it was 100 degrees in the summer and I had been working for 8 hours. Other than that, no thanks."
"A fairly standard light lager. Not my cup of tea, but not awful."
"Drinkability:For the style, this beer holds up very well. Very little complexity and low alcohol makes it a good alternative in countries where the water is not safe to drink."
"This pours an unappetizing yellow with a little wispy head that doesn't stick long, with no lace. On the nose there is wet grass, corn, and maybe just a hint of some spice from the hops. In the mouth there is a graininess that comes through and mixes with the corn. What hop presence there is is abrasive, and not in an artful way. The body is light, the finish is pretty short, and overall this is not a beer I was wild about. It would have been a little better if it wasn't so carbonated. Great taste, less filling? I felt like my stomach was full after two. Such a gas-inducing beer. Review 100 was KBS, and 101 was my first BMC review, so it was quite a step down."
"O: Not great yet not the worst thing I have ever tried. A decent BBQ brew if nothing else is around."
"It is what it is: An easy drinking light adjunct. I do love the commercials where they tell you to man up and drink more lite beer. haha"
"2011 vintage 12 oz bottle 'vortex' poured into my Bruery tulip. Served at fridge temperature. The aggressive 'vortex' pour filled the tulip with less head than expected. Looks perfectly clear of junk, which I can see well because it is somewhere between the color of water and the color of straw. The head is gone almost immediately, other than a thin ring around the edge of the glass. Impressed with the clarity of the brew and nothing else. Smells of corn, and maybe a bit a wheat. Not much coming off the nose, really. Poor aroma. Flavor is muted by the carbonation that fills the mouth. Otherwise, I get corn again, and almost nothing else. This is advertised as 'triple hops brewed', but there is no hop presence. The tiniest hint of sweetness lingers behind and then fades. The mouthfeel is very light and thin, but aggressively carbonated. Almost abrasive, like a diet soda. It's funny, beers of this class are supposed to be very drinkable, but I find this to be less drinkable than many beers. Overall, this is just a poor beer. There is no way to rate consistency, but I added a touch to the overall based on the impressive nature of producing massive volumes of product the same at all times. That said, this beer tastes like almost nothing, smells like nothing, is overcarbonated and generally disappoints."
"D: I think the drinkability they advertise refers to the fact that you have to drink it quickly to avoid the bad taste. Also, as it warms the taste gets worse and worse until it tastes sort of like vomit. Only reason I'm drinking this one because I'm all out of my tasty IPAs and these are left over from when I had friends over ages ago."
"Drinkability- Like always, only a beer I would go to if there are specials on it. NEVER would go out of my way for it or pay over $1 for it. Used to getting it in a pitcher at Maggie O'Briens Downtown St. Louis for 50 cents. Very nice!"
"Though this is a macrobrew, its not the worst of the worst, it has good flavor and goes down without any issues. On a hot summer day or for a party needing some cheap beer, this is a great hands on brew."
"Millier Lite looks good enough: clear light yellow color with a very small head. The carbonation is very active, the head disappears quickly leaving no lacing. I didn't notice any distinguishing aroma. The taste is mostly water, with all flavor surfacing after the beer has been on your tongue for a while. What you do taste isn't bad, but it isn't anything exciting either. Swallowing is easy and enjoyable enough. Better than most light beers."
" I can name 20+ other cheap ""light"" beers I would rather drink! Narraganesett Light is cheaper & has more flavor same can be said for Bud light etc.!!!"
"This beer is much too overrated. It's better than most cheap beers out there but it's still nothing like the commercials make it out to be. What can said about Miller Lite in a positive manner? It pours nicely but it but the head dissipates into nothing which is rather boring. Not much else to say, It's yellow, a few bubbles from the bottom of the glass every few seconds. In all honesty the only use I have for this beer is to mix some Amaretto with it and have Dr. Pepper shots."
"Overall it is easy to drink but that doesn't mean you should drink it. After all lava is easy to drink if you have a heatproof cup but it probably will do the same thing to your insides as miller lite."
"Drink- I shouldn't have bitten the bullet. It was just flavorless. No real reason to have one of these other than to say you are drinking a beer. No fullness on the drink, no real flavor."
"Very pale yellow, white foamy head that can fade quick, light body mostly cause of using sugar and rice to keep the ABV up, the only way i can descibe the aroma is ""beer"" hops are faint just to make it enough to call it beer, Miller is among the best for this style of beer, its my ""go to"" when i go somewhere and dont wanna ask or think of a beer to drink, my dart game beer"
"Pours a pale, urine-yellow. Thin white head that quickly dissipates, has a high level of carbonation. Very little aroma or taste, the level of hops is a bit more than competitors but still this is a bland beer. Very watery, light-bodied beer, but this is accurate to the ""light lager"" style. Highly ""drinkable", but I wouldn't want a bunch of these, they are boring and soulless like all macro light beers. Great for fat rednecks who seem to be enamored with this style."
"Pours a piss yellow. Clear lots of bubbles and a tiny bit of head. Smells pretty non descript like malted corn. No triple hops on the nose... Tastes bland and unimpressive. Corn, sweetness, not much else going on. The slogan on the poster at the bar is ""can you taste it?"" To which I answer... No. Decent mouthfeel and as drinkable as any other shitty adjunct lager I guess"
"Does this deserve an F? No. Is it tasty? No. Is it refreshing? Somewhat. Will I have more in the future? Of course. For an inexpensive afternoon of watching basketball with the guys and having a handful of brews, this is a great go-to. There's a lot I don't like about the company that makes this beer, but it does have its time and place."
"I'll finish this."
"I know we all enjoy the hand craft beer but I wanted to rate my favorite light macro beer. This is a Go to beer for all occasions. Looks like a macro beer, clear, golden yellow, clean white head. Smell of grain and slight hops. Love the taste for a light lager clean and crisp. Smooth and very easy to drink. Drink these all day and the next."
"I will happily drink miller lite anytime unless I'm really in the mood for something stronger & that might not even be a beer."
"Not bad but very forgettable, nothing in this beer makes it anything out of the ordinary. Not really worth trying unless your looking for large quantity for a cheap price."
"A pretty benign beer. Great for mowing the lawn or painting a fence."
"To be avoided at best."
"Light body, high carbonation, dry and unpleasant from top to bottom. I suppose this drinks quickly; but the flavor, nose, and feel all suck, so it's probably best to get this one over with as soon as possible. Thumbs down."
"Overall- non-offensive, average light beer. Bland and predictable for the most part."
"Tastes liek your alsmost drinking a regular beer. If your watching calories, which im not i suggest this one."
"Drinkable? Sure, but so is water. My overall impression on this beer though is not a very good one."
"When I was in college, I used to drink this beer by the case. Now I cringe at the thought of another sip."
"Unfortunately, I'm never really one of those guys. Awful."
"Would never be my first choice, but if I am at a bar or party, and they are serving up pitchers of Miller Lite, I will happily drink it."
"Piss appearance. Slight bubble gum and wheat scent. Tastes like a mildly spicy wheat. Better than most of the other American Adjunct Lagers. Easy drinking all night. No harsh flavors whatsoever. Enough flavor to keep you satisfied, perhaps the best taste of the AALs, but nothing worth mentioning as a beer in general."
"very light bodied mouthfeel with above average carbonation. goes down easily, just not sure why a self-respecting craft drinker would ever go this route. except for reviewing purposes... :)"
"Subdued aftertaste with little body. Just bland overall."
"Drinkability- All things considered, it's a beer you can pound and get drunk on, and that is pretty much it. There isn't really much of anything to consider while drinking it, it is easy to drink, and it's cheap."
"Clear light yellow with slightly soapy head, which disappears quickly. Very light floral scents mixed with straw. Although watery in flavor it was not unpleasant. Fizzy drinking here, and goes down easy enough. Of all the mega-brewed barley soda brands churned out, this one is actually a little bit better. A little bit."
"My brother and father must get something about this brew that I just don't gather. Gotta love family, though. It's the rest of the population that's got me mouthing, ""what the...?"" Still, to its credit, it's at least a few points better on-tap."
"Not too bad a little warm, either."
"D- About as drinkable a beer as there is. After all it's not meant for one at a time, it's meant for twenty. I can't completely beat up on this brew, after all, my wife and I were both holding these in our hands when we met. Good memories, good times, the best mass produced american light beer."
"Overall- Light and watery. There is not really anything going on with this. I do find their commercials funny, but that is the extent of my enjoyment of this beer."
"Don't get me wrong, though, I consider it among the best of the low calorie mass-produced American brews."
"Verdict: The more light lagers that I have, the less I enjoy them. This one is the worst of them all so far. Worse than Bud Light, believe it. There's hardly any flavor in this beer and what's there is your predictable cheap lager flavors; corn and metallic, grainy grassy malt. Not at all enjoyable. D- (2)"
"Drinks ok if you're at someone else's house and they've got nothing else. Otherwise it's mostly to be avoided."
"D - You can drink plenty of these with no problem, but it gives me a hangover from hell the next day."
"Poured a pale straw yellow, lacking head of any kind. Quite clear though. The aroma is very faint, if any. Very light corn and sweet grains, but that's about it. The flavor is bland and watery. I drank a water after this and it wasn't too different. Fizzy and carbonated. At least it has more carbonation than Angel's Share lol. I poured the rest out after making some notes."
"No, I didn't quite finish my pint of this and have officially had my life long fill of Miller Lite on-tap (or bottle)."
"If you were stuck at a lame party or already three sheets to the wind, I could see this being an easy beer to get down. Sadly, I'm sober right now and I'm not too stoked about finish my glass."
"Poure from a can with a pale-yellow thin-looking body and a hefty head which dwindles quickly to small lacing. Smells very thin, not much but metallic corn and some grain husk. Tastes very thin and watery but what can be tasted is not particularly pleasing. As this beer warms up, you can really start to smell and taste the cooked corn-pretty dreadful. Not a good beer at all-why is it so popular?"
"On pour this had a light golden color similar to most of the mass market light beers with a head that developed and disappeared very quickly. The beer had a grainy/sour smell which began to scare me. The taste finished that scare with little flavor besides water and a waxy crayon feel left in my mouth. It would be drinkable in quantity if one could choke down the the first 2 however it will take a better man than I to do that"
"Note- For what it is its ok. Dont get me wrong though. I would rather have a real beer."
"Poured some into a snifter, some into a tumbler. How is this beer best presented? I can't tell you. It looks pale and watery, barely registering a color. Perfect. Smells like corn, tastes like grains and corn, a little bit of grassy hop. Easy to drink, not particularly enjoyable. At least the entire can is covered in trademarks."
"D- Easy to down, flavorless"
"The riffled neck does not help."
"The multitude of reviews making snide comments on advertising campaigns irritates me, rate the beer dang it. I view every beer with an equal eye, regardless of manufacturer. This is not a good beer, no. But for being mass produced crap, its not quite as bad as all the pundits make it out to be."
"What a nothing of a beer. Briefest of heads immediately disappeared. Very weak straw yellow. Virtually no flavor at all of any kind. The label says ""great pilsner taste"" but it doesn't really taste of anything. Melted ice water would be more satisfying. And ""triple hops brewed"" but maybe by that they just mean 3 individual hop heads were added to an enormous vat of beer. Just an utter failure of a beer. And of course they trademarked the mispelling of ""Lite"" which is pretty funny when you consider how dumb that is and how bad the beer is."
"Pours from the 12 oz can a crystal clear, pale yellow (almost lemonade) color with a foamy 1 1/2 finger head that settles into a medium collar. VERY active carbonation. Aroma is of wet grass, cheap malts, straw. 1st sip is like seltzer water with a small amount of beer flavor. All cheap grassy malts...and where are the ""triple hops"" that this was allegedly brewed with? Mouthfeel is light and watery, with tons of fizz to ensure that there will be copious amounts of belching & farting to add to the experience. I'll admit, it would be refreshing on a hot summer day, but so would a bottle of water, which if you're worried about calories & carbs would be a better choice anyway. The fact this is one of the best selling beers in America is a true, shining example of what slick advertising can do for a product. And to think, there was a time when I actually thought the swill was good..."
"(D)- Sure, I could easily drink a 6er of this, but why would I want to?"
"This is probably my least favorite of the mass marketed light beers. Way watered down. nothing to it. not enjoyable. only drinkin this if i'm playing some beer pong or there is nothing else left. Having said this, it is what it is, a light american beer that people like to have a good time with. This is fine, but I'd rather have a Bud."
"Horses for courses!"
"Beer was purchased for my friend, who didn't want to drink any beer, so I decided to finally try this. Pale straw yellow, fizzy carbonation without any real head retention. Nothing overly offensive in the smell, but it is hard to get much of anything. This is pretty much carbonated water and I suppose it could be considered refreshing, but I'd rather just drink water. Carbonation level is too high to drink a lot of this. I didn't finish."
"On draught at Tokyo Grill Victoria TX in 22oz mug for 2 bucks. Pours a pale yellow with minimal white head. Light aroma of corn, grass. Taste same as aroma. Palate is light body, moderate carbonation. Finish is light grass, and corn. Overall not much aroma or flavor to speak of, very bland and boring could not finish it. It was the one of the better choices available on the menu."
"You don't drink Miller Lite because of taste though. You drink it to get drunk but not put on too much weight, and in that regard... it works. Flavourless but drinkable."
"I just had my first Miller Lite in about three years, on draft in a bar. And ya know what? I'm surprised. Surprised at how much I enjoyed it. Maybe it's because I've been drinking nothing but Pale Ales and IPAs lately but this was downright refreshing, had way more taste than Bud Light or Coors, and was nice to drink with food. I only got it because it was a cheap happy hour special and dammit I'm glad I did. For what it is and what it aims to achieve I'd say it succeeds. Not that it's saying much, but this has to be the best light lager on the market and I rated it as such."
"On draught at Tokyo Grill in Victoria, TX. Pale straw color (slightly darker than water). Aroma of grass and corn. Thin, carbonated body. Taste is like water (mineral one, due to carbonation). It was the best available beer in the Japanese restaurant."
"Well this review won't be much of a surprise... but I'm bored so I'll write one anyways. Smells of grain, corn, yeast not really much of a smell at all only if you swirl it around or you smell it as soon as you pour it. Tastes like that yeasty grainy beer taste with that metallic tinge which I think is the hops. They put such a small amount that the hops mixing with those grainy cereal yeasty like flavors that it comes off as a ""metallic"" taste... even though its really not metal. I get where they are coming from with this beer though which is why I didn't give it a D or F. It really is good if you want to drink a bunch and not get filled. That's what this beer is and that's it. The only thing that they shouldn't claim is of course their use of triple brew hopping. If they didn't say that and just used the less filling title then people shouldn't buy this beer and be surprised by how it tastes. I'll drink it if I'm real low on money because a 24oz can of this is only $1.55."
"Notes. Like i said, better then bud. This used to be what i drank. I cant believe the difference after a couple years of just drinking craft.lol. Overall though good beer for style. Very good light adjunct lager."
"Drinkability depends on who you ask... If you ask me, its not."
"Drinkability: This isn't a D+ beer. Bud light or coors light are in the F to D+ range, this beer is in the C range. It is drinkable, sort of refreshing, and it cleanses the palate. It also brings some complexity to the style with hints of hops and some interesting malts. So it isn't a bad beer, it's just an average beer when compared to everything else. As a light lager, this beer is among the best. I don't agree with the advertising done for this beer and I don't like how this beer is portrayed, but it is still a top beer among light lagers."
"D - Hey what can you say just about anyone can drink 12 of these during the course of a night. Its a classic american light lager we've all had it and I just love it for nostaglic reasons only."
"Looks clear light golden with a surprisingly big white head that settled into a tiny one, but didn't disappear entirely, and left some lacing on its way. This beer smells like underarms. Feels watery and carbonated. There's no taste to describe, except it's less sweet than PBR that I had right before this one. Finish is medium to dry. Goes down easy enough but what's the point of ingesting alcohol like this?"
"I'm pretty lineant when it comes to beer. If some one was to offer me a free beer and it was Miller Lite I would not except it. This is amazing if you know me because I love free drinks. This beer is incredibly weak and whack. It's below that of Coors Light. Whenever I see some one order a Miller Lite and immediatly judge that person as weak. No offense. There is practically no flavor and would not at any time buy this beer."
"D - just like the rest of the BMC beers; they sacrifice taste and quality for volume; cheers to tasty water!"
"I've always enjoyed Miller Lite for its easy drinking ability so I'm a little bias. It is my favorite Lite Beer. It's a beer to drink in mass amounts because you can't have just one. It's certainly not a beer that's complex by any means; it just has a simple taste. If it had anymore taste complexity, it wouldn't be a Lite Beer."
"Hmm, what can I say about this beer aside from the obvious? I would say that Miller does a lot of weird marketing ideas, i.e. Vortex bottle which this was poured through. What the heck was the point there guys? Or the flavor lock aluminum can? Screw top aluminum pints? I mean really? How about working on the beer? Anyway, now that my rant is over, I would actually say that I have been sampling various Miller products lately and they have surprised me. I was surprised by the overly meringue like head on the ""Champaign of Beers", or the noticable bitterness of the hops in the Genuine Draft, and so how about this one? The beer smells like cooked grains, some solvent yeasty smells in there too, and sweet corn. Not a cornucopia of beer goodness, but more like cracking a can of corn while the wife is removing nail polish in the next room....but I don't care. The taste is so minimal and faint it is hard to say it is there...a dash of ""triple hops"" and some sweet malt; some club sodium taste from the carbonation. This hardly counts as flavor. The beer looks extremely carbonated when I first poured in my glass, and is not smooth but kinda prickly on the tongue. I would say it is overcarbonated and MORE FILLING, with less taste that is not that great either, and overall just not that drinkable. Sorry LumberJacks and Jackettes, there is just a lot better choices even if you like lighter, easy drinking beers..."
"We won several games until the party transitioned to pong and Bud Light. That review's on its way."
"Conclusion: Better than some in the category, but that's like saying that, compared to Hitler, Manson wasn't that bad of a guy..."
"Awful. This is a beer for poor college students, nothing more. I don't understand how people drink this. But, you probably didn't need an official review to tell you this. I'd rather drink tap water with a lime than drink this stuff. There are better beers for the same cost."
"well personally i do think that this is my favorite lite beer out of them all thats why i am ranking it so high. the taste is really light almost to light but if your trying to drink alot of beer with out getting to drunk i think this beer would be smart to lean on."
"Smells of some vague adjunct corn, fake malt, something. Tastes a little sweet from malt and somewhat bitter from some hops somewhere. Mouthfeel is very thin. Very low drinkability. Don't waste your time on this one."
"Had to try to vortex bottle. My theory: we, beer geeks, are responsible for the abomination called the vortex bottle. We talk cascade hops and chocolate malts and ABV, and it all sounds to frat boys like the teacher on Charlie Brown. The vortex bottle gives them a response: ""Oh yeah? Mine pours down my throat even faster than yours, dude!"" Truly, I've had worse. But those bad beers didn't kill a tiny piece of my soul too."
"Somehow this bottle (plastic with a soda-style twist-off top, by the by) escaped the Swill Tour 2010. Well, don't you worry, it's meeting its destiny now. It pours a clear sallow topped by less than a finger of white foam. The nose comprises funked wheat, hard water, corn syrup, and vegetable oil. Not much difference in the taste, though the corn syrup is trying really hard to add some bland sweetness. Vanity. The body is quite light, with a moderate carbonation and a watery feel. Overall, just a crappy beer in general. But something tells me you already knew this. I mean, they couldn't even spell ""Light"" correctly..."
"This is my first light lager review, and since I rarely drink them I find it hard to accuratly judge them on their merrits. I have been planning a blind light lager tasting for a while now. I think that is really the only way I'll be able to actually judge these beers rather than downgrading them based purely on their style or the brewery that brews it."
"I poured this in a glass for perhaps the first time ever, just to get a glimpse of its appearance. It's light yellow, with a thin & unsticky light head, and is carbonated well. It smells like grain and corn. It tastes like grain & corn, with just a hint of toast & bitterness on the end. It feels active. It drinks super easy, the only category in which this beer is above 'average.'"
"Summary: This is a horrible beer. I gave it a 5.5/10, or an F. I understand that this is a light beer, but still the taste is crap, the ingredients are chemical crap, and the appearance is pathetic. The only saving points in this beer are the 96 calories, (at least I won't have to work out too long to burn off this mistake), and the drinkability ( I can drink this quickly, but at the same time I can drink Everclear and water if my goal is to get blitzed...) Unless I am completely drunk, I will not drink this beer again."
"I drank like five of these and it really didn't do anything."
"The drinkability factor here is without question. It's a very easy beer to slug. It's been produced for that very reason. Pleasant, bubbly, been-there-before type of beer that you'll be downing like water."
"Decent mouthfeel, ok carbonation. More like a soft drink than a hard one. Goes down easy enough, and I am certain that if I were presented with a sixer I could force through it."
"Drinkability: Sure, why not...if nothing else is available."
"The taste is hard to judge. After so many beer over the years when I drank this I could'nt even tell I was drinking beer. It was decently carbonated with faint malts and corn in the taste. No hops here."
"Drinkability: very drinkable in mass amounts it's my choice for bbq's beach river beer pong"
"The first ""light"" beer to go pro, and it shows. No innovation since it was first introduced, I'm sure. Eh, oh well."
"But the vortex bottle was probably the most idiotic marketing scheme I have ever seen. No one quite understood what the vortex was supposed to be doing. After seconds of research on the internet, I concluded that the vortex contributes nothing, and the beer remains sub-par at best. However, it is not controversial in taste, smell, or look; just kind of nondescript."
"This is one category they can hardly mess up. And it's on par+. Clear, watery golden, and bubbles streaming! That may be the pilsener glass though. Smell is faint, a tad rice, corn, and odd malts. For being triple hops brewed, I don't know here they went. There is some graininess. It's pretty bad though. Crisp on the feel is a typical, and the drinkability is naturally easy and depressing."
"This beer is crap. Poured a golden color with a small head that disappered after 30 seconds. The smell was that of water, moonshine and sugar mixed together. The taste was of cold carbonated water with metal. The feel was very bland with to much carbonation. I would never choose to drink this beer. Avoid this beer at all costs!"
"The only good thing I can say about this beer is that it does have more beer flavor than other light beers."
"Much better in my opinion than Coors Light and Bud Light. Best of the three but still not good."
"Served from tap into a Magic Hat shaker. Another brew as a part of my sobering up process (it worked by the way). Poured golden yellow with a one finger white head that subsided to minimal very quickly. There was no lacing to be found in this one (must have been out looking for the hops). The aroma was comprised of malt and wheat. The flavor was of water, wheat, and malt. It was light on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this brew is not that great unless you want to play the mass consumption game. So Miller, where are the hops you promised me in the commercials? Start putting a bottled on date on the bottles as the hop flavor disappears quite quickly in this one. Just a thought."
"Draft: Poured a pale yellow color lager with a small foamy head with minimal retention and no lacing. Aroma of corn and other adjunct is dominating. Taste is a mix between some light corn with a sweet finish. Body is very light with OK carbonation. Just like most other North American macro beer out there."
"Of the macro's this is my least favorite one by far. I'd take a coors of bud light any day over this. Maybe its just that I don't like pilsners, lol. The aroma to me is skunk all the way and taste is putrid skunk with a harsh after taste. For me it just doesn't get any worse than this."
"d - i would say its a decent starter beer for nonbeer drinkers also you can typically find it for 5 bucks a pitcher so for the price its drinkable"
"Triple Hops Brewed must mean three (and only three) hops in each batch of beer... Better taste than it's counterparts from AB and Coors, but not by much. Carbonation level seems annoyingly high."
"Poured a see thru piss yellow with a finger of head that dissapated quickly and left some decent lacing on the glass. I definitely get aromas of various grains and water off the bat but also get faint malt and wheat notes. This a very thin and watery beer with grains as the dominate factor on the taste which has a little malt but that's about it; very bland flavor. The beer was super thin in body with a good amount of carbonation that had a grainy watery and slight crisp finish. The beer drinks very good because its so damn watery which makes for a great session beer and also a brew you can have lots of in the hot summer day. Oh....and the only reason I'm reviewing this beer is to gain beer style points cause I need to review a light lager."
"D: Only decent if served ice cold. Of the beers for the masses or mass consumption this beer has the edge over Bud Light & Coors light."
"Thank god this can had a Taste Protector Lid, otherwise it may have tasted even worse. For a light adjunct lager it is OK...I guess, but if I want a light beer I'll go for a Guinness every time over swill like this."
"Poured from a can into a plastic cup. Straw color, with a thin white head that dissipated quickly. Faint grain and bread aromas. A very light and watery body. Between the carbonation and very light body it was difficult to detect much flavor other than some faint, weak hops."
"D - It's a decent light beer.. better than most in its class. Gets the job done if you're looking to drink a bunch of these while camping etc."
"This is a social beer. It's nice if you've only got a ten in your pocket and want to down a six pack. It's good for getting drunk. However, it's watered down and not that complex. At least it's better than bud light. The one good aspect is that it can work well with a good bbq or a cheap New York Strip."
"The beer pours a clear yellow color with a white head. The aroma is corn with some other grains. Very simple. The flavor is corn, grassy hops and grain. Not much going on, but nothing too terribly offensive. Light bodied and medium mouthfeel. A decent drinker."
"A beer drank by many of my wifes uncles and other family members, I rather just take my own beer to the family gatherings. I tried it a while back and still to this day see someone drink it and get that nasty backwash I got when I drank it for the first time. The color is just like every other beer on the menu at a mexican resturant. From the miller family I personally perfer the champaigne of beers miller high life... but thats just me.."
"MF/D: certainly not worth the money. if you want cheap beer, go for some blatz or pbr. why spend more than 50 cents a can?"
"D - It's poundable for sure but I don't know if I'll come back to it. It's got a price on it that's comparable to Bud, which for me isn't worth the the flavor. Not bad but not great for the style."
"d: Not too bad, not digging the smell though."
"Despite all it's flaws, I could easily pound 10 of these... I just have no desire to."
"D: Put on your drinking boots and put your liver to work cause you gotta work for the buzz! Its a good pizza beer."
"With the style in mind, this one is slightly above average. It is nothing special and I won't be drinking it routinely but at least it has mild hints of flavor instead of nothing at all."
"D- There are worse light lagers out there. That doesn't make this good. But still better than Bud light."
"Overall, a step up from Natty Light, but still not very good, unless, however, you are a fan of light beer. I would probably reach for a MGD instead of this one."
"My advice is to stay away from this beer, at least in 3.2% anyway. Of course, unless you are stuck at a ballpark, on a hot evening with nothing else to drink."
"D - easy drinking and not too filling."
"I was not real impressed with the drinkability. I will keep the rest of the six pack in the fridge for friends who prefer this kind of beer."
"Drinkability: Typical of an american macro. Good for the beach or hot summer days as simple refreshment."
"Drinkability has to b what raises this from an F to a D in most people's ratings, since they remember using this for funnels (beerbongs), shotguns, etc. But really, this is not a drinkable beer. It's just gross, and you probably need to suffer through a half dozen before you stop noticing."
"cheers!"
"Just plain old bad tasting beer/water. I am ashamed and embarresed that I do partake in this beer. This is my father-in-laws beer of choice. He drinks it since its cheap and it goes down fast. I have to drink it cause it is there at his house. Fortunately my mother-in-law drinks wine, so I am able to drink that while visiting. Nothing good to say about this beer, though my father-in-law is excited about the new ""vortex"" bottle. I guess this would apparently make it go down faster so you don't have to taste the beer."
"Mouthfeel is ridiculously thin and overly carbonated. This is the worst aspect of the beer."
"Drinkability: For the style this is above average and I have graded to that standard. I would certainly reach for this above others in the style. I could certainly have a couple on a hot day."
"Miller Lite poured yellow, with almost no head. It smelt stale, and nothing else. It tasted the same way stale, and the more you drank, the worse it got. I wouldnt want one, deffently a beer that would turn one off to beer. I dont understand how this beer is so popular."
"D- for what it is its my favorite. Its undeniably drinkable but I just don't want to."
"For the style, this is what it should be."
"Just this side of a drain pour. If you want to drink beer & not taste much, this is for you. Glad I only have a couple ounces!"
"D: It's just horrid, but most of you already know this. I can't see how so many people can thoroughly enjoy this."
"Gross. Down with BMC and their phony ""vortex bottles"". How many more ridiculous container designs are you going to come up with? Each day I hate you more and more as you push craft brews off the shelf with your bastardized product and unethical practices."
"Drinkability: It's not the worst beer ever. It is what it is. A light and pale beer of little quaility."
"Beer is thin but has some flavor to it. No alcohol but some grain and the carbonation fill it out slightly. I'm not going to say its a great beer but I've had worse. I've had worse craft beer honestly. Its just boring and simple and bland."
"Overall lite has always been beer flavored water in my book. This does nothing to change my opinion. However I could see people really enjoying this method of delivery. It makes a super easy drinking beer even more so."
"M&D: This style of beer is for those who really don't want to taste their beer too much. They want refreshment and drinkability after work or after mowing the lawn. This beer delivers. How can I knock it or give it too low of a review for delivering what most of America and the rest of the world wants. Will I personal drink it? Not much. But I know many who do and enjoy it with all their might. Cheers to them."
"Not great. It's better than Bud Light but is that really saying anything?"
"It is what it is. I don't open one of these when I want to kick back and relax. I have plenty of these when I'm up and having a good time."
"I agree with every other reviewer on tasting notes. I think Miller Lite is more drinkable than other lite beers though. If you have a plate of habanero hot wings in front of you, or are hanging out at a barbecue in the heat, ML can hit the spot. It fits a niche for me now, unlike my college days when it was always in stock."
"D - Low abv, light body, the potential is there to drink a lot of these, but its surely not based on its taste. Triple hops brewed? Really?"
"Overall: Miller Lite ranks as the best light macro beer due to its subtle hoppiness and lack of skunked qualities."
"A favorite of many Joe Six Packs but I don't like this one at all.. I like beer with some flavor.."
"D- I always rate drinkablility high for these beers. Not filling, goes down like water. I guess Ive been trained to stomach beers like this."
"D- It goes down like water, but theres no enjoying this beer."
"Drinkability: Despite being boring, it is easy to drink, so probably deserves a 2.5. But when a brewer throws around BS terms such as ""triple hopped brewed"" and ""true Pilsner", it just annoys me, so it gets docked extra."
"Taste is like watered down beer - very watery, a little hoppy, dry alcohol. Definitely a significant amount of corn here. Mouthfeel has the dryness and the watery body. Definitely drinkable...if not exceedingly enjoyable."
"Not very drinkable after the first sip, doesn't make you want more...but I'd drink free one on a hot summer day/at a party."
"*tounge in cheek review"
"I've heard people say that some beers are like drinking water but I never understood it until today. This was like drinking a very stale water."
"Pours a light yellow color, nice carbonation, small white head, with some sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, with some hops, slight caramel. The taste is slightly sweet, malty, slight hop note. Light body. Not drinkable, would not buy again."
"Out of all the light American beers I like Miller lite the most. It has a nice color, really smooth when ice cold. Its great for tailgating and just hanging out with friends and knocking a few back. My second choice would be Coors lite. But I would recomend this beer for anyone looking for a good like domestic beer."
"Drinkable? Sure, but so is water. My overall impression on this beer though is not a very good one. This was review number #666 for me, which is appropriate, because this beer is, in the words of Bobby Boucher's mom on ""The Waterboy," ""The devil!"""
"Light straw color. Small head with little retention. Smell is corny, skunky, a little musty. Tastes of corn and metal. Pretty watery finish. Over carbonated. Not very drinkable for a light lager. Below average beer. At least it's low on carbs."
"This is really not very appealing at all. It is indeed a light lager, so it should be the kind of thing I could chug down, but there are too many unappealing aspects. I might even be being a little kind with the score. It's bad, but it's more or less to style. Beyond the first few ounces, it starts to get so boring"
"Notes: Similar to most Macros. Not bad for a light lager and it has its place, but not really anything to drink."
"Cheers!"
"D: A BMC, and a low-end one at that. Why do people drink this?"
"The flavor is grainy and metallic in the middle, with a mess of a finish. It reminds me of stale beer, but this isn't stale. It lingers a bit much. This beer lost carbonation really quickly, and I wouldn't recommend pouring it in a glass. Straight from the can, it was a bit cleaner, as the higher carbonation helped hide the flaws. It still wasn't good, but it's still beer and I could tolerate it if I had to."
"its drinkable, water is drinkable so this is drinkable."
"Tastes of corn again. Slight grainy flavor. Triple hops? My ass!! Extremely thin-bodied and watered down tasting with just the slightest alcohol aftertaste. Hey, at least it's easy to down (its one saving grace)."
"This is my most hated of the BMC light versions. Idk what it is about this beer but I can't stand the thing. I have actually only drank this a few times now, but I don't think the more you drink the more you like it fits this beer. It has a taste that doesn't compare to the others, but not in a good way. I almost can't even describe it. I'm not keeping this in the fridge for a party."
"Drink is decent because it is so light to drink without really getting a bad flavor. Drink it ice cold and you can have a bunch."
"This is essentially seltzer water. It's terribly watered-down and flavorless and there's really no enjoyment in drinking it."
"Drinkability: I give it a three, but only because one could drink copious amounts in any sitting. I know I used to drink this a lot before find the wonderful world of craft, but taking trips down memory lane is not always a good idea."
"Had on tap at a local bar. Triple hopped? I think not. Yellow and fizzy after the pour. Plain taste nothing outstanding like hops or malts. Some minor metal flavors. Smelled of stale over cooked corn and rice. Mouthfeel is pretty watery. Nothing to reach for again."
"D- Barely!"
"I prefer Miller High Life. Better flavor AND 5% ABV."
"Overall- What is left to be said. This is just another perfect example of why I tend to stick to finer beers when my budget allows it. I drink for quality not quantity. If I was handed one of these I would drink it but I will NEVER buy this beer unless it is rediculously cheap and I have to stock my fridge for a party to keep people away from my private reserve of fine beers."
"Not sure why there are so many negative reviews of this beer. I've had the gamut of beer the expensive craft beers, Sam Adams, the frat boy beers (Red Dog) and everything in between. Miller Lite is a great lite beer for the price. Good beer to relax with at the end of a day without too many calories to make you bloated."
"D - They do go down very smooth. I could drink a bout a hundred of these on a nice hot day while I'm mowing the lawn. They hydrate me very well during softball games."
"Cheers!"
"Probably my favorite of the big three, which doesn't exactly say much, or anything, at all. I just don't get quite as much of that corn/rice adjunct character in this one compared to the others."
"Drinkability- Not as good as advertisements suggest but I'd knock back a few of these at a party if I had to."
" Miller has a great history and was once a small regional brewer with a following too."
"Super Delicious"
"Smell, old, like beer in a couch. Taste, you know, whatever yeast they use, its somewhat complimentary to what this beer is. You can actually discern a faint amount of sweetness that is mildly enjoyable (I dunno, could be some adjunct sweetener though). Mouthfeel, don't keep it there it ain't good, but is marginally drinkable, because, its like drinking vitamin fizzy water, and, it was free like every month, thank you Miller Brewing Company and Marquette Law School . . . GO MILWAUKEE, GO WARRIORS!"
"Poured from a 16 oz. can. Has a pale yellow color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is mild, some malts. Taste is missing for the most part, beer flavored water with a hint of bitterness. Feels light in the mouth and has average drinkability. If only the product could match the advertising, this one is not good."
"Drinkability: This is by far my least favorite of the big three lite beers. I got this beer for free and I could never see myself paying a cent for it. Absolutely worthless..."
"I just don't see the point of lite beers. Most people drink this stuff to get drunk but it has less alcohol and tastes way worse than non lite. Won't you have to drink more to get a buzz and defeating the purpose of cutting back on calories anyways?"
"Notes: I actually prefer Corona to Miller Lite and related products. Even though Corona is skunked at least it has more flavor. I'd rather taste skunk than strange water."
"A good choice only when your options are very limited like at a ball game or a bad party and you definitely want a beer."
"Appearance has a light golden to it and a very thin head. Smell of grain, corn and light hops. Taste comes out very light in flavor with grain and corn and definately not having the triple hops to it. Mouthfeel is light with good carbonation. My first beer from a screw top aluminum pint, I had to try it for that at least."
"Hey it is a light beer what do you want.... Not the light I would go for out of the ones I've had... no favorite yet. Not the best and not the wosrt."
"All aspects of this beer are to be as expected from the style. It is called a Light Lager because the drinker wishes to sacrifice flavor and alcohol content for fewer calories/carbs. Miller Lite tastes ever so slightly better than its B and C opponents but not making it justifiable to purchase Miller Lite if it was any more expensive than BL or CL."
"Its funny, after several months of nothing but good microbrewery beers, you'd think your taste buds would have developed and you would notice a huge difference between Bud and Miller Lite. Nope, they tasted identical, like they came out of the same vat. I won't bore you with the details, read the Bud review if you are interested, they're the same down to the aroma. Neither beer is a bad beer, there are just a lot better out there. And I have to give some props to Miller Lite after all these years of neglecting it in favor of Budweiser."
"Here's to #100. Happy drinking!"
"Well, this is what it is. It is an American Light Lager. Cannot expect too much from a mass produced light beer. I would drink this one over most of the others. This beer pours with a good amount of head but beyond that it is very thin. Not much taste or mouthfeel at all. It is a very drinkable beer. But I typically drink for quality."
"In keeping with that honesty, I have no idea what horses eats."
"D - Easy to drink and that's the key. No bad flavors cause there aren't really flavors. But could I put down a 12 pack in a night if I had to? Sure."
"O: Not bad if you have to drink it (like at a baseball game), and it really is my macro of choice, but it just can't compare to real beer."
"Looked bad, smelled bad, tasted bad, felt bad, drank bad. Not much else to say...Their triple hops brewing claim may make people think it's of quality, but it really sucks. Smells terrible. I'm assuming the hops they get are from a generic source, maybe impersonation hops product? Is there such a thing? I just don't understand how the can think that this stuff tastes good. People (if you can call them that), seem to think this stuff is awesome. They love it, which I don't get at all, but whatever floats your boat I guess. Either way, I find it hard to say anything positive about this beer when I have never had either a good time with it or a good memory of it."
"Drinkability- I could drink a few of these, but why?"
"Mmmm.... Triple Hops brewed. Except I can't taste any hops. Looks and smells like a typical adjunct, tastes a lot like carbonated water. Certainly not a bad flavor, just that there's not ANY flavor there. Good for parties, I guess. If I had to choose a light beer, tho, I'm going with Sam Adams light. The one upside to this is that it's very drinkable. But so is water."
"I got this at a club and it was more pricey than Bud Light and it tastes JUST like Bud Light. It's not that great but it will do its duty if you want to get drunk. NOT a drink to have on it's own. Both this and Bud Light are lowsy beers because they have hardly any flavor at all. It's like having a soda water and I could not taste the hops in it."
"D: This is drinkable in the way that water is drinkable (because that's mostly what it tastes like). I gave it the rating I did for drinkability because while you can certainly consume a lot of them due to their rather neutral flavor, I just wouldn't want to. At this point in my beer drinking life, anyway."
"Drinkability is great compared to the other adjuncts in my opinion. It goes down easy and is a good session beer if you had to choose one from this style. This was the first beer that I had ever had and I guess I kinda have a soft spot for it. But it doesn't compare to any of the craft beers I've had now, but something to turn to in a pinch."
"D: What..?? OK !"
"D: While not as good as Bud Light in this category Miller Light still has good drinkability, especially with the new freshness seal cans."
"D- This is a very drinkable beer along with the rest of the big three. I wouldn't want to start off with one to be honest but I could finish one if need be. There is not much taste to this one which could be why it is so popular with the everyday crowd. I would rather drink a terrible IPA or Stout though than one of these."
"Overall - To me, this seems to be the best out of the three big light beers out there. It's no Pabst, but I'll take it over Bud light or Coors light."
"D: ranks above bud and coors in the BMC light beer tasting. Just enough improvement in color, taste and body"
"Wow, what a watery beer. I have to admit, if they were going for minimalist art, this beer would be ranked much higher. I am having a hard time deciphering a flavor other than sugar, and I guess corn. I agree, triple hops brewed must mean 3 hop pellets for every batch. Aside from the kick I get with the fizzy bubbles, I think I'd rather have water."
"Overall: Hot summer days this light bodied brew is a good choice for an adjunct if on a tight budget."
"It would be hard to review this like any other micro or import for that matter, because it's like comparing boxed wine to something from Murphy Goode. Long story short is that Miller Lite is the best of all three of the mass-lights. Bigger taste if you can say that, better color, if more yellow is a color, and more drinkability because you actually feel like you have drank a beer after finishing one. My go-to tall boy can at a Raiders game."
"Solid on the drinkability meter... sorry Bud Light, but Miller Lite's flavor and mouthfeel crush you on this one. Good ads though."
"But if you want a beer for general comsuption, then go with this beer."
"OK, I have got to give it to this beer. It has its place. Most people who look at reviews like this do not like this beer, or at least do not admit they like this beer. This beer is made for heavy consumption. You can drink it literally all day, such as a trip to the beach with your old college buddies. No reason to talk about the way it tastes, if you are reading this, you have had it. Just remember, you can say what you want, but I bet you will have it again. Not a bad beer. It could be Coors light, bud light, etc. It is the best of all those like it."
"Poured 12oz bottle into pint glass. Poured a clear pale straw color. 2 finger white head, stayed together for a good bit. Smell was watery and grainy, not good at all. Taste was water down, light grain, corn adjunct flavoring, cheap aftertaste. Very light mouthfeel with high carbonation, its a yellow fizzy beer. Drinkable for a light beer, but i won't buy any of this with my own money ever again...maybe if its given to me."
"Notes: I know this is not the highest rated beer, but as Jim Koch said (verbatim) that it is hard to brew a beer of this style, because the slightest miscalculation in the recipe will result in a botched batch."
"I'm surprise they call this a ""True Pilsner", more like ""True Adjunct Piss""."
"In honor of the Angry Video Game Nerd - Rather than drinking this beer, I'd rather have a buffalo take a diarreah dump in my ear. I rather eat the rotten asshole of a roadkill skunk and down it with (another) beer."
"From the can during a round of golf, but I know all too well what this beer looks and smells like. Lets be honest, its not a grate beer - far from it. Pale yellow colored with no body, corny bland smell. Super watery and lacking much taste. Smooth in the mouthfeel, certainly goes down easy. Drinkable from the can, as long as the can is still cold. Once this warms up a few degrees, pitch it, its like drinking stale water."
"Well, its a light beer. What do you expect? This is the best macro light in my opinion. Easy to session if its all you've got."
"D - of all the macro light lagers, this one is probably near the top...definitely a favorite when at the softball field"
"I'll drink these in group settings, say with a pitcher. That's about all it's good for."
"Verdict: Drink another light beer."
"The drinkability is about average if you can stand the taste. Not the worst-tasting beer I've had (that honor goes to the flavorless Natty Light), but certainly near the bottom."
"D- Easy to drink. No harsh after taste and light carbonation make this an easy beer to enjoy when looking for something to drink and not to satisfy a craving."
"This is one of my favorite beers. Sure it's a macro so it's not exceptional but is definitely my choice to take fishing or tailgating. Of course there is better beer, but for an American lager it's one of the elites. Much better than Bud Light and the silver bullet."
"Pours a golden color with visible carbonation, and little head. The aroma is well missing. Nothing but a musty water smell. The taste is of a slight hop bitterness yet with a bite of skunky beer to it. The mouthfeel is okay not overly carbonated. The drinkability is low, you could have one or two and no more. It is a simplistic beer, instead of triple hop brewing their one hop they could add some citrus notes or some other more flavorful hops."
"This is the epitome of piss beer. I absolutely hate it. It is terrible from bottles, cans, and kegs. While it is a part of many good memories I wish I could forget this beer. It is cheap for a reason. I won't even call it drinkable because I hate it so much."
"Serving type: can"
"Light bodied with a lingering grainy aftertaste in my mouth."
"D- Good for getting drunk. Honestly, though, not bad for BBQ/summertime."
"I prefer this over CoorsLight and BudLight, but I'd rather drink a non-light beer any day"
"Overall, I was handed this shit at a family party and had to choke it down. No off flavors, but that's because there aren't any flavors. Why even bother? I see people buy this stuff by the case(S), and it just flat out baffles me."
"I would not have just one though because nothing stands out in this brew. But I think it's the best of the empire light beers."
"Drinkability: Excellent. It's a run of the mill beer, not good but not bad. And it's really mild (weak)."
"When the bottom line ($) is the bottom line, spend your money elsewhere."
"Worth a try if you like a light lager."
"Poor drinkablility, so boring."
"A sweeter version of the American adjunct light lager. Whereas Bud is drier, Miller is a little sweeter with more corn/husk flavors. A definite beer for long chugging sessions. Buzz is guaranteed. So is an overflowing bladder and numbed taste buds, forgotten nights, discarded clothing, etc. A beer for long parties where sustainability is key and drunkeness is the goal. Taste? Seriously, WTF? Are we drinking this style for our dedication to craftmanship here? Cheers!"
"But that's pretty much what Miller Lite is trying to be. It's easy to find and easy to drink. As far as light macros go, it's probably the best. It's certainly one of the least offensive."
"Drinkability - easy drinking product, but not very good. If it's cold, it borderlines acceptability for a filler product. Not great though."
"Taste: It has more flavors then some light beers but I don't really care for it. It is almost like they tried really hard to have it be a more flavorful beer but the taste is nothing all that great."
"D - Overall, just a little more color, flavor, and drinkability than other BMC light beers... Ever beer has its time and place and this is a tolerable stand-in for times when there are limited choices (ball games, bachelor parties, etc...)"
"I may lose my membership for this, but in the annals of how things can taste, Miller Lite really isn't that bad. Obviously it's completely lacking in any sort of character or complexity. As their ad once put it, it's brewed in vats the size of Rhode Island. But considering the style, it's smooth, refreshing, unobjectionable, and basically how I'd expect a light beer to taste. I won't be running out to buy it, but I won't turn it down either."
"Poor finish and leaves a touch of runny malt on the back end. Too dry to finish well."
"Pours a crystal clear pale light yellow with a foamy head that has zero lacing. Smells like a frat party... ok I'll give it a little more credit and say a college bar on a Monday night with $1 drafts. Taste is basically nothing, I think I had some corn stuck in my teeth though. Mouthfeel is horrible, not even comparable to sparkling water... just plain water. Drinkability is fine I guess... if you can drink water you can drink Miller Lite."
"This beer, while it didn't offend me or anything, it did nothing to impress me. It's just kind of...there."
"Drinkability. It is their catch phrase. And I get it, in a way...this beer can appeal to the masses and they make no joke about appealing to the lowest common demoninator. So there you are. You could easily drink this at a cookout. You just may not enjoy it."
"The best part about this beer is that it was free. For a style that is (maybe falsely) associated with ""drinkability"" it took me quite some time to finish a pint, and I did not want another. It is not the worst beer I have had but i would not spend money on it."
"Do yourself a favor and get a real beer, not this watery yellow fizzy crap."
"D: Sure you can drink it! Probably a bunch of it. That's the point I guess. Maybe it's the conditioning with cheep beer I had but I have to rate this high on the drinkability chart because it is drinkable."
"D - If I want to keep up with my partying college brothers this is my beer of choice. Either that or restraint and restraint always looses."
"M-D- Smooth on the tongue but a forced dry feel make this kind of hard to swallow. Drinkablity is good for a long night of drinking."
"I poured this abomination into a pint glass to a white head which immediately receded. The color was pale yellow. It smells sweet and stale. It tastes skunky but having had Miller Lite before I know this is how it is supposed to taste. It is very watery. High Life and MGD are better than this crap."
"The beer looks like beer. The body is a darker yellow than a few lite beers I have had. The head is white and rocky; however, the head quickly falls apart. The aroma is of cooked grain and little else. The flavors are briefly sweet grain. This gives way to a metallic flash of flavor. The body of the beer is thin. The carbonation is active but fails to improve the beer. Drinkability uh no. Yet another beer for people who dont like beer."
"Why not just drink water? It's cheaper."
"Drinkability is where this was dissapointing. After a few sips it reverted back to what I was expecting. Bad tasting and hard to drink.would not of been able to drink anymore. I would clasify this as a light pilsner, tough call on if this is true to style just a crappy one, or just a crappy beer. Age old question I guess."
"Beer pong/ any drinking game, this beer is a champion. You may buy it in any store that sells booze, and it has less calories than other regular light beers. There you have it... the best bad beer!"
"D: Not as drinkable as it's mainstream peers. I'd much prefer Coors for a refreshing light beer if I'm buying cheap."
"Final Thoughts: Blah"
"Had at Dudley's Draw while working on some stuff. Pours a very pale yellow/golden with a solid white head. The heads sticking around on this guy, but I'm guessing its since it was a rough pour off the draft. Smells kinda grainy, a little like straw. Not much else on the nose. Tastes thin. Faint corny/grain taste on the finish, but otherwise pretty dry. This is better from the bottle I do believe. Its very inoffensive and easy to pour down my gullet though."
"D: All beer has it's place...I guess. This one would be acceptable (not good, just acceptable) for mowing a lawn."
"T: Hit's with carbination, slight malt and finishes metalic. It's like diet pepsi without the aftertaste."
"This is probably my favorite of the BMC light lagers. I don't really know why? I guess everybody has their preferences for this style. This is one of mine."
"Of all the mass produced American light beers, it's my choice. It is what it is. If you have a choice at a party go with Miller Lite. It has slight beer flavour, unlike Keystone, Bud Light, Busch Light etc. Very easy to drink in excess, enough flavor to keep you satisfied."
"If you're really hot and thirsty, and you don't care much about flavor. Or if you're worried about calories, and you don't need a satisfying fullness, this is an okay beer. It is actually a rather typical American light lager, presumably of a pilsener style, but not flavorful enough to be worthy of that title. The beer is light colored with a decent head. It is virtually without aroma or taste on the palate, and it certainly leaves no aftertaste. The carbonation is nice, and the very thin texture in the mouth is refreshing and crisp if you're thirsty. I'll continue to drink these at summer baseball games, because you have little choice in most American ball parks."
"D: Less drinkable than Bud Light, unfortunately. I guess it goes down fairly easy, it just hardly resembles beer."
"All in all it is a lite beer and it is what it is. That being said it is somewhat drinkable in a pinch."
"Very light bodied, high crisp carbonation"
"D: Fit for college drinking games as a lightly-alcoholic beverage. Otherwise, I wouldn't touch it."
"Pours a pale yellow with a fluffy head that dies pretty quick. smells like stale pee. The flavor is pretty unique, I'll give it that. Kind of corn, grain, and sweet wheat, no noticable hop flavor other than maybe a slight skunky floral sense in there somewhere. No real bitterness at all, a crisp finish that leaves no flavors behind. It's carbonated ok, lots of bubbles to take away the actual flavor. Once you had a few of these, they could start going down real easy."
"Overall - If I rated this beer solely by comparison to other light lagers of the same class, it would be an A+. So instead, I also considered it's qualities as a beer in general. This is a good beer for what it is. (Whisper) I actually like it quite well. For the number of calories, it has good flavor and it seems to have more body than the others. I think I just changed brands for my ""day on the boat"" beer or when I just want something lighter."
"Drinkability: It's really high if we're neglecting whether or not drinking it is enjoyable. Pass..."
"I drink periodically and if the only thing at a party for a beer. Will not drink bud light regardless."
"Very tiny head to this. High carbonation overall, looks similar to sparkling grape juice. Smells faintly metallic and sweet, hard to distinguish individual scents. Very bland taste, not offensive, almost has a lager taste...almost. Feels like light champagne on the tongue. Can drink many of these, no problem. Not my first choice, but I won't refuse it when offered either."
"King can poured into imperial pint glass. Really don't remember this beer pouring so nice and failing miserably in taste and feel. Thought I'd try it for kicks while I watched NCAA and snacked on some spicy stuff. Looked clear golden yellow - agressive pour resulted in quite a head - decent tighter than alot of macros. Don't see alot of carb action though. Smells clean with a hint of hops tastes of grain and the faintest of hops - not how I recalled from years ago - when this tasted distinctly different from other lights. Anyway the taste and mouthfeel were terrible flat in flavor and feel. Drinkable - mouthfeel even ruined that for me. I'm curious to try this in other forms - I'm thinking it has to be better on tap or my sense of nostalgia has gotten the better of me."
"Overall - Another crappy light beer. Dr. Cox should stick to his day job. If anything, it's redoubled my resolve to find my father a nice pilsner or something instead of this junk."
"D: If you're lookin to pound a few (and by that I mean like 20) then this is the beer I'd choose. It's definitely better than bud light as far as this style is concerned. It used to be my beer of choice in college... then I tried real beer)"
"This beer is O.K. at best. It is a good beer for drinking one after another or free beer at social outings that beer may not be consumed fully or spilled/wasted. another great use for this almost worthless beer is to use it in such drinking games like beer pong."
"D-I'd drink it again if there was nothing better on hand."
"Verdict: Maybe I'm just not ""hip to the hops," but this sucks. It's the normal thin and bland profile you'd expect from this style, but with a nasty chemical taste takes it to a new level of shitiness. Firmly behind both Bud Light and Coors Light."
"It always tastes as if it has been sitting by a furnace for 6 months before you drink it. It is very close to not being able to be drank at all."
"D - 2.5 smell is a big turn off for me. Taste is okay, I would drink it for free or if it's the only option."
"Mouthfeel is overyly fizzy and thin. Overall this is a cheap beer and not worth spending your money on, but if it's the only thing available, I'm drinking it."
"D - Easy to drink and enjoyable given the right circumstances"
" And if I was in a different store ready to spend, I might even move onto a craft/micro brew of choice with a similar golden light feeling but perhaps with some more hop twist involved: see: Prima Pils from Victory Brewing or the Lagunitas Pils."
"My favorite light beer. I have been through many of these in the last few years of being at school. Miller Lite is a light yellow color and a very small head which dissolves very quickly. The smell is that of most light beers. The beer tastes very watery and carbonation is the most apparent quality. Mouthfeel is very thin and watery. Like I said, it's my favorite light beer, but that's not saying much. Good for college kids on a budget who don't want natty, but other than that I would say get something else. A good football game brew."
"Drinkability: Basically, this is a party beer. Cheap, and smooth enough to drink a lot of at a time. Not many other situations to drink this though."
"My favorite BMC, hands down."
"No need to write down a description for each category for this beer. Overall, to me at least, this is a beer you drink if you plan on having quite a few because I don't get full drinking it. To me it is not nearly as good of a taste as heavier beers and it leaves the mouth dry after going down. Looks just like any other light beer."
"Overall, this is nothing stunning or good. I received this at a party and thought I would give it a shot and throw a review up on it. Nothing I would every buy."
"I'd have to say this has been my 30-pack session beer for several years now. One thing I can say is this beer has never bitten me on the back end, even with many servings in a session. My rating is for within its categery - light lager or light pilsner. Speaking of pilsener, I'd rather have one of these than a Pilsner Urquell (sp?). Pours a nice golden color for a light beer, and actually has some taste to it. Cheers!"
"For the record, I do like Miller Lite and support it. AND, it is better than Bud Light."
"D: Does its job. I guess that's the best I can say."
"I find Miller Lite to be much more drinkable than Bud Light, wwwaaayyy less carbonation. There is actually some taste and smell and it isn't wholly offensive. Mouthfeel I would compare more to gatorade or lemonade than water. It basically feels like water with something in it."
"I hadn't had miller in quite a while when my roomate picked up a twelve pack. I grabbed a cold one out of the freezer and I was surprised by how refreshing the drink was. It's slightly more carbonated than say, a bud light, masking the likely poor quality of the hops used in the brewing process. Definitely a drinkable beer. A good one for a day on the beach or tailgating (not to mention affordable). But, in regards to overall taste, this beer won't be nearing the A range."
"I mean, how can I rate my all-time favorite garbage beer? Always puts a smile on my face."
"D - Miller Lite certainly got the job done and was fairly unoffensive in the process. Not the worst choice for cheap beer at a bar."
"It's Miller Lite, we all know what we're in for."
"This beer to me is good for what it is. To expect it to be as good as a premium good beer is silly, but compare it to the other American Domestic light beers I find it to be superior. Yes its water down beer, low flavor, low smell, lower quality but for what it is I think its good. Its meant to be drinking in large quantities rather than for quality. Its great for barbecues, sporting events, or just a party where you don't want to be buying a zillion 10 dollar six packs. Its not a great beer what so ever but it was what many like my self started at in the very beginning of getting into the wonderful world that is beer."
"This is a poor excuse for Beer and given the choice of drinking Miller Lite or pure well water, I would likely choose the well water and wait for the opportunity to have a real Beer."
"Drinkability: It's fine for what it is, I guess. And so poundable! You can down a pint before you say ""I'll meet you at the bottom!"" I'll take Remarkably Bland over Questionably Foul-Tasting any damn day of the week."
"if you could press it into a crunchy triangle shape this would make an amazing accompaniment to some chunky salsa, melted nacho cheese and homemade guacamole"
"This beer is good beer for going to a race since only cans are allowed. Also good for camping. This brew is available everywhere and is usually at a low price. Good for a low budget."
"This beer is an easy out if your going to a party or social event as it's appreciated and won't go to waste, so i guess that ML has this going for it. Money well spent!!"
"Overall: I apologize to me"
"D - Of course, this has decent drinkability. It's designed to."
"Drinkability: This is light does not taste terrible, so I can drink this when I have to. The lack of other positive characteristics means I will never go out of my way to buy it, though."
"D- See the opening remarks"
"From the 24 fl. oz. can no. B51-8171C. It pours pale yellow with a good supply of puffy white head and a decent continuation of carbonation. The aroma is of grass and corn and typical of the style. The body is very watery and the taste has some vague hops but they don't jump out at you. This is about the same as all American pale lite beers no matter what the advertisements say."
"D: it tastes almost like water, and it goes down almost as fast"
"Miller Lite is a light golden lager with a foamy white. It is shockingly sparkling. The aroma is very slight and of corn, citrus, perhaps some hops and butane. It is more faint than the High Life aroma. The palate is that of sparkling water and a dash of creaminess from the head. Not much flavor here. It's a little acidic and kind of tastes like cardboard. It is simpler than High Life. I think maybe it's watered-down High Life... which makes it ever-so-slightly better."
"Nothing to get excited about as far as taste, look, or smell. If you're looking for something to power down and quench your thirst after mowing the lawn; this will do the trick."
"I have been to a number of parties just packed with this beer flowing in a light golden fury. This beer is the top choice for most of my friends and one of the few beers that they drink that I may be able to drink one or two of... tastes like water and lightens my mood I guess. Still every time I see this my mouth gets a werid feeling and it knows the pain is coming. Last night I drank a double dead guy ale and finished with these. Worst idea ever. Terrible hang over and it tasted even worse than normal after drinking a decent beer. My head feels like its splitting and I blame you miller lite... heh. L. I. T. E"
"Not the worst beer out there, and definitely the best Miller has to offer with their name on it. Pours clear yellow with a frothy white head. Crisp aroma, mostly grain. Corn, metal, and something bitter in the taste. Crisper than others. Perfect for beer pong."
"Note: By far my most disliked light beer. I will never buy it, and never accept it from a friend. This is definitely my last resort. However, when given the choice of no beer or Miller Lite, I'd pick sober most of the time."
"Very pale yellow with a thick white head and a fair amount of lace. Almost non-existant aroma - Bitter and Slightly hoppy. Basically water however a little maltiness is detectable on the tongue. Very light and smooth. Not horrible for light macro,will drink if free."
"I am really enjoying all the craft beer I've been drinking lately, but a bunch of Miller Lites iced down in a cooler on a hot summer day will work for me anytime."
"oh and dont drink coors light, they give alot of money to the RNC, and well im not George Bush people, and I didnt vote for Mccain.."
"Why do we even do this to ourselves? This is what we are rising up against. But this is the optimal light american lager: meant to be conumed in great amounts while building a tree house, watching a baseball game or playing a softball game. It's good for what it is, but what it is is not good. It's like a bad handjob: ypu gotta appreciate what happening, but ti's pretty awful and you just want it over with. Better than Bud light."
" This beer is like a horse with a broken leg."
"D- Easy to drink with a better flavor than Budweiser."
"D: I will say that this is the macro light beer of choice, in my opinion. It tastes like it could be beer, which sets it apart from most of its brethren. I had a bunch of these left over from a party. I'd never go out of my way to drink one, but hey, it's a sunk cost at this point. If you were trying to get drunk off of this (and why else would you seek this out?), you'd have to drink so many that it would negate any advantage the light calorie content has."
"The head lasts a good 10 minutes and the lacings are impressive. That is all I wanted to add to my previous review."
"Jk"
"What is there to say really? Another mass produced light beer. While it may not be as horrible as most light beers, it is still nothing special. Watery mouthfeel with lots of carbonation. Smells a little better than soap mixed with urine. My choice hands down out of the big three (Bud, Miller, Coors) however."
"Exactly the same as on tap!"
"Drinkability: Very sessionable to say the least, but why waste your time when there is 537589347589374634 more beers out there that are better? You decide..."
"D- honestly- i have to rate this pretty decent. i could drink (if i could stand it) quite a few of these beers."
"I had not had this beer for a long time. When my neighbor gave it to me I had to break out my beer recorder. It had a lot of head but that disappeared quickly. There wasn't really a lace it was more of a film. The body is really carbonated and straw yellow. There is not much for flavor but drinkable. It is a crisp and corny beer. The smell is beany and adjunct."
"Had this one on tap. It is your typical American lager beer. It is NOT good at all. It looked very clear with a golden hue. Slight bubbling rising from inside at the bottom of the glass (kind of like champagne does but not as drastic). Smells crappy and the taste was right there with the smell. Not much on flavors at all. This is one that you would maybe have after a sweaty outdoor workout in the summer. Junk beer but better than Bud Light or Coors Light. The one thing it does have going is low carbs."
"It is very drinkable"
"It will now be an even longer time before I have one of these again."
"drinkability: ok, I suppose, for the budget nights or frat parties. About what you'd expect from an American Lite beer. Nothing to drink on a regular basis."
"Okay, in all honest what do you expect from a lite, American lager that can be bought (on special) for $15/case. But this really just isn't any good especially if it isn't EXTREMELY cold. I can choke it down if there is little ice chunks floating around, but the second it gets to a temperature where it will not numb your taste buds before you have a chance to taste it, you're screwed. Going to stick to Coors or Bud for the budget nights."
"Pours a bronze stale water color with frothy head that does a disappearing act after a few sips. Aroma is quite hard to place in this bland beer: alcohol, grains, and slight vanilla extract. Tastes of touches of vanilla with stale water to end the drink that lingers to create an undesirable aftertaste. A poor excuse for a beer, I rather drink listerine."
"drinkability: very easy, high carbonation makes it good for some things I guess."
"Thanks to Greggy for this one, lol. This beer pours a clear pale straw color. The head is half an inch in height, and recedes within seconds to nothing. The aroma is of faint bready malt. The taste is like the aroma; lightly bready but so faint that it is almost nothing. The mouthfeel is light bodied, and offensively over carbonated. Overall, this isn't the worst macro out there, but it is still undrinkable."
"More flavor than Bud Light but that does not say a lot considering the style here. Quickly dissipating head and little aroma. The color also does not add to the overall experience here, very light. A great party beer but not good for too much else. -Dale"
"Light yellow colored beer with rapidly fading head.This is an easy drinking smooth light beer which goes well with a family bbq or on a football Sunday.It might not taste as good as some of the micros but some days you gotta go back to where you started."
"One thing I will give Miller with their light beer, you can drink the hell out of it. Pours an oft white fuzzy head, loads of overcarbonation, and a ""bright"" color. Very watery. Smells of corn and has very little more taste than water. A good hot day beer or a good beer to not get whacked on before a football game, other than that, avoid it if possible."
"Drinkability is moderate to low. It certainly could be sessionable, but the flavor is weak, boring, and basically not good."
"The taste is minerally, thin grain - corn with light old sweetness, soda water quality, light grass-hay bitterness which is exceedingly faint. It has a sweet corn aftertatse but the character persists and does not degrade."
"As far as most people are concerned, there are three 'big name' domestic lights: Bud Light, Coors Light, and Miller Lite. I think Miller comes out on top of the others but that doesn't make it a great beer. We picked up a 20 pack of bottles for a tailgate yesterday and it did the job just fine. As one poster recently mentioned, it is a pretty clean beer. It has much more flavor than Coors Light and is smoother than Bud Light (in my taste anyway). The drinkability is pretty good. I'm able to put away quite a few if I want to because of how smooth it is for a cheap domestic. To put it simply, it's an average beer."
"Notes: Very basic."
"The drinkability is easy when it comes to doing projects around the house and you need a cold one. Not necessarily one you would impress friends with but easy to drink on summer days."
"2/2/3/3/4"
"Its not aiming to be craft, so I can't judge it next to a craft beer."
"Drinkability is where is shines, not because I could swill it, but because it won't mess up the palette if good food is on course. It has a faint taste and there'e nothing terrible about it. Still, no one should drink this regularly or at home. I can't see the point. (Beer pong, I guess?)"
"In my opinion, this is much better than Coors or AB in terms of a nice, tasty, drinkable light beer. On the bottle it says its a true pilsener.. which I don't really taste or believe, but that's besides the point. Basically its extremely drinkable and has a decent amount of flavor which puts it ahead of the other big guys... it's Miller Time."
"I will say that Miller Lite makes for a decent drinking game beer, or for floating the river where bottles aren't allowed."
"D: Drinkable, as far as light lagers go there are worse examples out there."
"Drinkability is ok. This is super boring, and very bland. But not terrible, and it's thirst quenching on a warm day. That however, is about it's only real redeeming quality. When it comes to macros, this is one that I can actually stand a few of..."
"Mouthfeel: I have got to admit that is goes down rather smooth with a highly carbonated, bubbly finish. Drinkable? yup that it is!"
"Yes, I'm reviewing Miller Lite. Because I've had it a million times, so it deserves an official write-up. It pours clear and very pale yellow with a bit of white head. It smells like faint lemon hops and cultured yeast, with a bit of earthy barley malt. It tastes very weakly of caramel malt with a hint of yeast and lemon hops. It's watery with some carbonation, and has basically no aftertaste. Overall this is one of the most generic beers ever, that's all too easy to drink, but isn't really rewarding at all. The main thing going for it, is that it's not offensive at all."
"Would drink it if i am doing hard manual labor or just want to chug 13 beer in an afternoon."
"Might as well review a classic. Appearance had some promise: very large frothy head, but no real lacing, just huge bubbles across the head. Eventually, the head dissipates. The beer itself was a clear yellow appearance with an obvious watery aspect. Aromas are extremely minimal. Metallic yeasts and slight bread, but really artificial and strong mineral flavoring. The taste was really just awful. Watery, metal-like, lacking any hop or malt textures. Mouthfeel had some saving grace. This is definitely a typical beer you can just sit around and drink, especially on a warm day. Overall, without being offensive, the beer can please most palates. Yet its generalness lacks any spectacular qualities of a good beer."
"D: An MCB thru & thru, but out of the M - C - B, the M is and has always been my favorite macro...to each his own, I guess."
"After pouring the can into a pint glass I spent about a full minute laughing out loud. Am I really going to drink this? Very clear with a light straw color. White head of fizz that goes down to just a half inch circle of suds in the middle of the glass. Tastes like seltzer with a shot of cheap beer poured in. I finished the glass but what to do with the other eleven cans? Maybe some house guests will drink it. I didn't think my tastes had changed this much but I really can't drink this."
"Yellow appearance, fizzy, clear, slimy head. Faintest possible aroma, smells like rice, corn, and poverty. Flavor is like corn syrup flavored seltzer water. Tons of carbonation, thin body, clean finish. As drinkable as water. I feel dirty drinking this."
"Poured out of the bottle a bleached straw gold color with a thin white head. Very little retention but it did lace, albeit brokenly. Aromas of yeast and sour corn mash like a barroom floor. Tastes are equally stale, grainy husk, grain mash and hints of something metallic. Not outright offensive but not really drinkable. High carbonation gives it some body but otherwise a very watery beer (as one would expect from a light). Long, strange finish. It is barely drinkable but for a light macro brew I'm impressed by even that. It is what it is."
"It's amazing that people put up with this, that's about all I can say."
"Miller Lite has always been considered low end light swill to me. Golden color, not much head or lacing. Grainy, hay taste with some corn and malt. Thin and watery and a bit foul tasting. Not completely undrinkable but there are better light beer swill options."
"Great for a keg party or while mowing the lawn. As below average as some of these beers(macros) are they do serve a purpose. The purpose just isn't as enjoyable as some alternatives."
"poured from a 12oz bottle into a pint glass. appearance is very pale yellow with a very thin white head that dissapated very quickly. has a very light malt smell and that is about it. not much flavor but i still think it definitley tastes better than bud light. drinkability is ok, i could drink these if they were free."
"It initially appears much like the other American Lights, light with little head. Surprisingly, from my memory of the other light beers this one does not taste as bad, but it definately was far from good. I would steer away from this brew unless you are dying of thirst."
"There are plenty worse bargain macros out there, I waffle between this or bud light as the #2 and #3 macro lights, both are pretty bad. I recommend coors light if you have to drink one of the three."
"D: i can drink a lot of this beer, its not the best tasting thing in the world, but it isn't that bad. definitely a bar beer when nothing else is available."
"great taste less filling... not brewed for flavor but brewed to get you drunk! well yeah it is brewed for flavor compared to bud light which tastes like carbonated water but lets not get into how bad bud light is. a good beer if you want to drink a thousand of something and still be able to eat snacks while watching a game. not my favorite, but will buy again"
"Drinkability- For what it is, it's really not as horrible as I was expecting. About the same boat as Bud Light, but maybe a touch better. Blows Coors Light out of the water."
"Oh, yeah, and it's cheap. That can't be ignored."
"Well, if this is all you have available then it could be worse. Of course there are a thousand or so other brews that are more interesting and delicious than this, but overall it wasn't too offensive. Just another American Macrobrew."
"I have had this in every form for many years. The only reason I'm reviewing it now is because I was at a private function at a bar last weekend and my choices included this or bud-light both draught. ""The lesser of two evils"" I told the bar keep and keep em coming. Poured a straw yellow with a slight hint at carbonation and even less head I didn't see any lacing clinging to my fancy plastic Cleveland Browns cup. Aroma gave off hints of cheap flat american p*ss, followed by a mouthfoul of day old fraternity keg freshness. This beer felt like stale pond water on my palate and finished not fast enough. It was $10 all you could drink from 1:00 to 6:00, I think I got half of my money's worth. All joking aside I am not rating this beer solely on that last experience. Miller Lite is a very typical American Lite beer, and like all Lite Beers I avoid them like my in-laws. One or two can be a little refreshing on a summer day if they are extremely cold, however I prefer beer with more flavor and body."
"D: Drinkability, if you decide to accept is unimpressive and horrible. How people can stomach the taste of this is beyond me. A dumper."
"D: Definately could swill large quantities with no ill effects."
"The beer poured a pale yellow with a good head. Slight laciness as it was drank. Smelled of malts and cereal grains. Taste was of cereal grains, not much else. Texture was water. This is a good beer for a hot day, went down easy. No flavor, but if your looking at getting an easy buzz, who cares. Overall decent compared to the other american micros."
"Miller Lite, my secret shame, the beer I have probably had more of than any other since every tailgate, 75% of post-softball drinking, and most parties I go to serve this. It is pretty much water, but it is my favorite light beer."
"This is a nothing beer, no aroma, no taste or body to it. A waste of money."
"Pours a pale light yellow color with several inches of head that dwindles down to a lace. Smell is overbearing with adjuncts and corn galore. I know this is a light beer, but come on it tastes like corn water. It goes down easy, because it is lightly carbonated and has absolutely no hops whatsoever. This is sorry excuse for a beer. I'm not giving this a hard time, because it's macro brew either. I will drink some of their stuff, but if your looking for a cheap and/or light beer, this should be your last choice."
"The taste has a slight lemony taste that is surrounded by oodles and oodles of water. Yeah, it's a light beer and it tastes like one. No surprises here and I'm just glad that I didn't have to buy a 6er just to review it. On to better things..."
"I usually don't excessively macro bash, but I usually buy Miller High Life for my binge drinking purposes and decided to take the ""step up"" to Miller Lite. It was really like 20 steps down. However, if you can remove from your brain the expectation that what you are putting into you is going to be beer, it may be possible to down many of these due to its super light character and no-nonsense.. well.. no-anything flavor content."
"Very pale beer that never pours well. Rarely holds head retention and minimal lacing. Smells sour, tastes sour. Have only really ever enjoyed it at baseball games when I needed something to wash down my bratwurst. The only redeeming quality is that it sponsors my Milwaukee Brewers. Yikes. Avoid."
"The look was yellow straw color, not much foam in this beer. Smells like water, grains, and metal. Taste like water or watered down beer. Feels like it tastes easy feel, nothing bad about this beer. Drinkability very easy to pound a case of this beer. So if you are up for a long night of drinking get some of these in you."
"D. Some people pound these, but personally, one was more than enough for me."
" Dudes, if your're going out and want to hang for the long haul, you can drink these all night. Great beer for 5 hour sessions. One weird thing is though, the buzz actually seems lighter than with real beers. I like these sometimes. Good for long days at the beach. This beer brings back a lot of memories. I will always go back to it at times. It has it's place and time. I mean, what do you want from a super light macro beer? I'll tell you what i want...Drinkability. I think a bunch of people are not reviewing beers according to the style of the beer. I mean, are you going to sit here and say ""This stout is too full bodied""? This beer is brewed to taste like nothing. And thats just what it is. I can't think of a better super light macro beer. Best served BALLS COLD!"
"Had this one out with friends, figured I'd put down a review. Straw yellow color, with a surprisingly good head, and solid lacing (!). Seriously, I don't get it. Looks like piss with an excellent head. Nose is minor, grain and malt. Taste is likewise, with a touch of skunkiness. Feel is thin, but that's mostly to be expected. Tastes like nothing, no question, but it didn't look bad and you could drink a bunch of them."
"The mouthfeel is again, like that of water. Probably the best of the macro light lager variety, but still almost flavorless. Given the choice I would not order another. However, with all that said, I can still drain quite a few of these when there is nothing else to be found."
"Drinkability: Easy to drink, and probably better than most other light domestic lagers."
"D- Drinks easy like a light beer should"
"drinkability : pretty good -- that's why it is so popular I guess. I'd rather drink this than water but it's a tossup betwee club soda and Miller light."
"D: Not the worst lager I have ever had, but pretty close. I think I'll have a water."
"D- I have always turned my nose up to miller lite, but served in a pils glass, at proper temp, this wasn't terrible at all. Easily Sessionable."
"So I'm visiting my daughter and son-in-law, it's late in the afternoon and I'm flying home the next day, and I'm out of beer. My son-in-law said I'm welcome to try his favorite beer, so I figured ""What the hell. Why not?"" This beer is an insipid yellow color with a small head. It has a vaguely sweet aroma, and a vaguely sweet taste. It felt like water. I suppose it's OK for a macro."
"Poured to a very light yellow with a very white head that had a lot of big bubbles. Head disapeared very rapidly with little to no lacing. Smelled of rice and corn. Not a lot of smell here. The taste was very mild to say the least. Not a lot of flavor going on. Felt a little over carbonated in the mouth. Also like water. Not much body at all. This would make a good lawnmower beer and thats about it. I use to drink these all the time. My how things change."
"Prost!"
"T/F/D: The beer is overly carbonated and very watery. Certainly not the taste advertised. The lack of any real flavor makes it very hard to drink. I don't plan on drinking again."
"Nothing was going on for this beer. The look was awful."
"Lite= F minus minus. Z-minus...but oh yeh 'water' is 'drinkable'. Pffft!"
"D- actually, it's not that bad, i can finish this draft with ease, maybe the frosted mug helps. as a matter of fact, since there's nothing better to drink, i'll order another one."
"Light beers aside this one is not good. Many of my freinds drink it. Why is the question. Light yellow pour little head little taste initally with a lot of after taste. Another over commericalized beer with little taste. Taste not so great...filling ....a who cares...not a good beer. Little flavor litlle color and nothing impressive."
"This is my favorite lite/light beer. I can find it just about anywhere and the flavor is so unobtrusive that I can drink it with anything and not ruin the taste. It's usually my go to beer when I'm in a bar that doesn't have a wide tap selection."
"D - The only reason I gave drinkability a 5 is because I consider Miller Lite to be in the ""party beer"" category (like Yuengling, in my opinion). It's a decent beer to stock up on when having millions of people over to drink (much better than Coors Light or Bud Light). And I could have dozens and dozens and dozens of these without getting full. Well, maybe just one dozen, at most, before passing out in a puddle of my own drunken drool. When I want to get shitfaced with a bunch of friends for an affordable price, I usually pick up a few 18 packs of Miller Lite."
"Definitely not a great beer, but for the style, one of the better."
"D: Bring it on. It's a refreshing beverage that is so flavorless that it's enjoyable. You don't have to think about this beer, you can just drink it down like a fish...perhaps after losing one's job, a death in the family, on a hot day in July, at the end of a long journey, or after a hard day's work at the mill (stone or flour). Seriously though, I would never turn this beer down."
"The last beer I reviewed was Bud Light and, since everyone likes the compare the two, my thoughts would be that Bud Light has a slightly sweeter flavor with a dryer finish. I would prefer Bud Light, but just barely."
"Would I recommend it? No. Would I drink it? Only as an absolute last resort if nothing else is available where I am, such as a sporting event. Beer is better than no beer. If I had to choose between Miller Lite or Budweiser, I'd go with Miller."
"D: Easy to drink, but hey. I have to say this is better than other light beers, though I usually avoid them altogether."
"Pours a nice light straw color, with quite a bit of head and a ton of carbonation. Very weak scent, just a bit of crisp straw/malt. Fine taste for a macro lager, although there is very little there. Mostly just a clean, slightly malty flavor. Goes down fine. While it may be not be very good compared to any other style, it's a decent US macro lager."
"Drinkability: Low ABV and okay taste make this one quite drinkable. I'd drink it again in a pinch."
"Why do we even rate beers like this? Shit beers like this should be banned from websites like this....bland, boring, and commercial driven. Anyone that actually gave this beer a high rating should not be here. Not even an exceptable beer Sunday football, or tailgating. It would be great if products like this just went away...."
"this is a classic lager with a very high drinkability anfd a good taste. the beer is very generic but flavor is nice. this i one of choice for my wife and most of the community and I think is because of the less filling part of the beer. the phrase drink more and feel less full is the term well said. This beer i like but I don't buy too much of."
"Okay... I'll start by saying that I feel like a bad friend... you know the kind that turns his back on you. Well, that's me right now. Miller Lite was next to me all through college and was even at my wedding. Never did anything wrong, I just started hanging around with other friends. Anyway... having said all that, this beer is really pretty bad, kind of like my analogy. Anyway, it poured a yellow gold color, with thin white head. The head was gone very quickly. No great smell; couldn't quite put my finger it, kind of metallic. Very carbonated, and leaves a salivating type feel in the mouth after swallowing. I'm not going to bash this beer after all it has done for me; I can at least say a few nice things."
"It's your typical corn and grain tasting American macro lager. The colder, the better. But when compared to other mass produced beers, it just seems slightly better."
"D: Very east to drink, almost like water. Like most light beers, it's something you could probably drink all day."
"D - Another one I drank in college, a lot. Was one of my favories at parties. Not one of my favorites at all anymore. Better than some."
"Not drinkable, unless you don't care about taste at all."
"I could've done a review on the can (which is far worse than anything else), the bottle, the draft. I just picked the draft because it was on dollar special for lunch today. Has a carbonated body that is a seethru pale gold w/ a decent head that disappears almost simultaneously when you put the mug to your mouth. There is some crispness in the taste with a tad bit of hops and barley showing through. Mostly watery though, hence it goes down real smooth. Too smooth. I don't mind having these once in a while, especially since I am not really supposed to drink (interferes w/ my weight lifting regiment). I wouldn't recommend this or pick up a 12-pack for a game though...they have MGD64 for that."
"Taste is, well, pretty light, not much going on, but I will give it that it goes down smoothly and is quite crisp with loads of carbonation (not necessarily a bad thing for this beer), easily drinkable for social occasions when you're on a budget or if options are limited."
"A lot better taste from a bottle!"
"Again, these beers are built to be flavorless, and colorless. Remember this when you review."
"Very thin, as expected, slightly bitter, and if you look real hard, maybe some biscuity taste, but really thin with no depth. The interesting thing is that it tastes very close to the non-light version."
"I've had these in cans also...not good"
"Pale golden color with no head. Very watery looking. Smell is almost non-existant. Taste is bland except for the mildest bitterness and a standard pale lager malt-ish flavor in the aftertastes. Also some sort of weird chemically taste that is not good at all. Probably my least favorite of the light beers."
" ~ This isn't one I'll be tossing my pals saying, ""you gotta try it."" The only really good part about this beer, other that the appearance, is that it's brewed in Wisconsin which creates a bunch of jobs for my fellow Wisconsinites down in Mil-Town."
"However, I lowered my taste score as I neared the bottom of the glass, because as it warms the beer exhibits a undesirable creamed corn aftertaste. Drink this one ice cold."
"Thin body almost no head smell of corn in the arom taste is rather bland. Better than some lite beers but I would recomend sam lite if you have to go with a lite beer. This is one that I would avoid unless your just having one to be nice like I do at my dads house."
"Ya gotta do what ya gotta do sometimes. Good to stick in the cooler for a NASCAR event after you've spent all day drinkin' the good stuff. Other than Piels one of the few mass-market beers I'd consider coming near. If I'm out of absolutely everything my wife has a couple of these in the fridge. Drinks clean and isn't offensive, but that's about it. Best mega-produced American light beer on the market."
"Overall, you arent buying taste you are buying for the alcohol!"
"This company has some good offerings. This beer is not among them."
"""Tastes great, less filling"" sounds about half right."
"A lot of people are acting like beer snobs. This beer is what is. It's not meant to enjoy while sitting at dinner or while watching tv late night. This beer is for people looking to act stupid and get blacked out. And for this it is good. It's not a beer I would choose to drink but it has its place and is a clear leader in piss water category."
"Pours very pale straw with a small head. Rather nasty aroma. Kind of funky and grassy. Not very sweet. There is a definite corn/adjunct flavor. Light bitterness. Light bodied but not as light as you might expect. Fairly drinkable. This is the beer of choice of several of my friends and I find that after two or three I really don't mind drinking this too much. It has a definite corn off-note that makes it easy to pick out (at least for me- I've probably drunk too much of this over the years). Given the style it's not terrible. I'll drink it if it's all that's around but it's not a good beer at all."
"D: A little tasty, goes down easy, not filling at all, it’s better than its piers (Bud Light, Coors Light, Corona Light, Amstel Light, etc.) and even before I started drinking craft beer, I knew that this one tasted better than most mass-produced beers. However, now this beer has become a desperation choice for me. In fact, there are places that I avoid because I know they don’t have anything better than this."
"Given all these factors, it is surprisingly drinkable. Well, except for the 12th ounce in the bottle. Stick to drinking the first 11 ounces, then toss it for a new one. That last ounce always tastes nasty. But otherwise, it is what it aims for - a beer that is the same in every single bottle you'll drink, and that you can have a few of without really thinking about it. Not impressive, not interesting, but not as offensive as some of the big market beers out there."
"Not horrible for the style, but not the best either. There isn't much to say about the smell or taste other than there is nothing repulsive nor anything particularly enjoyable about it. It tastes watery with a hint of corn grit and a dash of malt. No real hop flavor to speak of. It's at least okay for quenching your thirst on a hot day."
"D: I passed it to someone else to drink."
"D- I list drinkability as average only because its not that filling. I just dont like the taste enough to ever buy any. IMO Its just mass marketed crap."
"this is probably the worst beer I honestly have ever had, or that I can remember. I know that ""skunky"" is reserved for beers that get too much light, but thats what this beer, time and time again, tastes like. Its the lite verson of miller, which for what it is, I dont mind too much. I however feel that this beer tastes like miller. a very sour skunky taste is what I get, with little head on the pour and a smell thats non-exsistent."
"By this time, everyone's brains had been washed thoroughly and they went to Walmart to buy my bottled pee."
"Stay away."
"If you want to drink something that has no taste and doesn't get you drunk just drink water because at least that's free. You can chug this stuff so easily so I had to rate it a 4 for drinkability. But why bother? I could drink a 12 pack of this stuff and barely be buzzed. If you want to get drunk on the cheap go for naty ice or steel reserve."
"Overall, ahead of its peers, but that doesn't say much"
"Poured light straw with an average amount of carbonation. There's little color to this beer and I wasn't surprised to find no head retention. It tastes of light corn syrup with maybe a bit of grassy hops. Very sweet flavor, and the aftertaste isn't at all pleasant."
"Overall obviously I don't seek this out..it could have been worse and been a Coors which to me is the worst beer I think I've ever had"
"If you have ever consumed this beer and you frequent this website, you know it's bad. If you have to drink a lite beer, reach for a Sam Adams lite. It is the only light beer that doesn't make me want to vomit."
"It looks very nice with a golden color and has a very light, but distinctly lager taste. On a hot day, it is perfect and highly drinkable. On a cold day, it is a bit thin."
"Drinkability: Decent brew when the goal is to pound down a bunch of them. Good beer to slam down in the parking lot with the boys after work."
"D: not bad. Bet ML I've ever had, very smooth, and nonoffensively refreshing with a nice sweet malt and floral taste. Rating is for within it's style and the freshness on site. Won't drink it if I have any other reasonable option."
"All, in all, it's a typical light lager with just enough body to keep me drinking it. This beer's saving grace is that it is refreshing and crisp (assuming it's cold), and can be drinkable. I'd get tired of them pretty soon, though, for being so weak. It's much better than some of this style that I've tried, and I generally won't turn my nose up to one. I just think there are more enjoyable beers out there. Whatever floats your boat."
"EEEE!! My roomates drink of choice,(pray for her).The beer isn't worth pouring into a glass, but if you do, no head really to speak of. Light color, taste is not so good. Verrry watery mouthfeel. We all know that this beer is obviously marketed for masses. I don't do keg-stands of busch light at college parties for a reason. I don't drink this beer, but to whomever does, don't shun, lets embrace them and convert them to our ways!"
"Drinkability - only if very thirsty or very drunk. Otherwise, clean water is superior."
"Pours a very pale yellow with a small, white head. Smells of Corn. Taste is pretty dry. At first it tastes like a regular macro lager, but there is so little body to it. There is just a hint of hops in the finish. The drinkability on this beer is somewhat high, due to being so light, like drinking carbonated water. There is not much here in the taste department."
"D- It's like drinking water lightly flavored with corn and hops. Not bad tasting, but not really 'tasting' much at all."
"I have had this every which way you can, I have a friend who pretty much drinks nothing but Miller Lite. Of the big 3 Light beers, Bud Light, Coors Light and Miller Lite, I would have to say this one is the best one they have to offer, plus Bud light gives me a headache. Anyway this is one of the beers you might get if you are at a state fair or some massive event like a city wide St. Pattys day. I have had much better and much worse."
"I'd give it a gold medal in the light macro swill category"
"It has very very light malty and hoppy flavors...a very enjoyable beer."
"Still feel this is easily the best US macro-brewed light beer. It actually has some taste. This is my go to beer if I'm out tailgating or watching sports and need something cold, refreshing and in a quantity that won't have me draining the wallet. I will take this over Bud or Coors, everytime."
"If you're a fan of light beers, and if you haven't already tried Miller Lite, than you're definitely missing out. Without a doubt my favorite lite beer, this is everything a good, classic light beer should be. With only a 4.17 % alcohol percentage and only 96 calories per 12 oz. serving, you could drink as much of you want of this and still enjoy bottle after bottle. Nothing fancy or exotic, but this beer definitely pairs well with almost anything you enjoy eating it with. Goes great with light appetizers or anything else. Great taste, and easy drinkability make this beer one of the best of all time in my opinion. Whenever you want a good session beer, this is the one to go to. In my opinion, much better than most other lite beers out there on the market."
"D- Drinkable, but not a beer of choice for me. Only if it is the last beer in the fridge (hopefully that will not happen)"
"Poured out light golden with a 1-2 finger head that dissapeared to a ring in a few minutes. Very carbonated, it made me burp a ton. It smelled horrible, I don't even know how to describe it. Taste was okay at first but about halfway down it got pretty shitty. It was pretty runny and watered-down. I don't know about any medals at a beer cup, they must hold the competition. I guess it would be more refreshing at a tailgate party."
"It's smooth, light, and very drinkable, but not so flavorful."
"Not a tasty beer at all. Not very hard to slam these back, but not something really worth putting into your system. I know these Light Lagers get a bad rap on BA, and I usually try to drink with an open mind, especially since this is a lot of what is drunk here at parties, but this is just not very tasty"
"D - Not my first choice of beer to drink I guess you could play beer pong with it"
"I think this the best of the big three light beers (Coors, Bud, Miller). That said, it is best to avoid light beer at all costs! That is, unless you are a poor college student like me. If you drink beer primarily for the refreshment value (which I would guess few on this site do), this one's not bad. Their commercials notwithstanding, I have a hard time believing they won a medal at a European beer competition."
"Appearance is that of light yellow spring water, typical of this style. Smell is kinda bad, like spoiled ground water if there is such a thing. Taste is average for generic light beers. Mouthfeel is actually decent for this genre, not too sharp. Drinkability is very easy given the clean lightness of the contents. You could drink yourself sober very easily with this beer, a good regulator."
"This beer pours a golden yellow, but very yellow with a short white head. The aroma is of all cheap beers, very low amounts of mild hops and a bit of malt. The two indredients are blended together pretty well, but since the taste is so bland that is not very hard to do. It has a nice carbonated feel to it because it does not have much flavor. I like this one better than most beers in its category and it's worth a try. The beer is a bit expensive, but it is worth a shot to see why it won as many awards as it has."
"Miller Lite is much like any other macro light beer. It tends to have a very clear, pale, golden color with a sweet smell and no real head to speak of. This beer's corn-like flavors aren't nearly as offensive as some of the others, and just like its chief rival, Bud Light, it has a refreshing carbonation. The overall effect is still a struggle and I really don't understand the point."
"Overall, Miller Lite's just yet another entry in the American light lager category. Nothing really distinguishes it apart from that 'over-carbonation' sense that you get from drinking it."
"Believe it or not, I'd never had this before. Miller is my least consumed beermaker of the big 3, probably because I tend to associate it with a real a@#hole I used to know that drank MGD like it was going out of style. This is an excellent beer for drinking when you have other things to pay attention to besides beer. If I hadn't been in a sportsbar where my attention was riveted to college football, I'd never have drank this in the first place, but as a light beer it does what it's supposed to."
"Supposedly one of the best beers for you because of the low carbs, making it extremely light and amazingly easy to drink lots"
"D: This is my session beer of choice. When I'm out dive hopping, this is the best. Could pound these all night without stopping."
"Drinkability - Not a bad beer in my opinion. It is what it is...a light macro lager. Sure, it may not have the depth, complexity, body, etc of a craft beer but that's not what they're aiming for. Very drinkable."
"Well...""it is what it is""...and it's not that good. It's a light beer...and hardly a ""beer""...but it's light and highly drinkable. Then again...so is water! It's smooth, yet grainy, a tad sour even, and watery. I believe this...If you're worried about calories/carbs...either don't drink beer, or drink LESS of your favorite ""REAL BEER!"" This is just an expensive alternative to beer. One of the better light beers, I guess...if there is such a thing. Too expensive, too, for what it is. You're getting less of EVERYTHING..(including alcohol content!) than most regular brews...so why do it?? I think it's more of a ""social/popular"" young person's brew than anything. Sure, I'm guilty of indulging occasionally....but VERY occasionally! Served ice cold, it IS refreshing to some degree, and smooth to down. Don't waste your money, though. Miller doesn't need it, and you could do far better for the price! SAAALUTE my BA friends!"
"This is just a macrobrew. We all know that. Made from corn, rice, straw, old mattresses, whatever. I know it's not going to be great but I have to say it's my favorite of all the light beers out there. If I feel like drinking a massive amount of beer this is the beer I choose. It tastes decent. It's VERY easy to drink. And it's only 96 calories a piece. It tastes better than Bud Light, Michelob Ultra, or anything else. I prefer Dunkels, Bocks, Stouts, and the like, but this is my 20-beer-in-a-day beer. The most drinkable beer around."
"This beer pours a golden color right out of the bottle, with a very small and short lived head. There really is no smell to this beer and the mothfeel is very watery. which leads to a very weird honey taste. The after taste only makes you drink more so you will forget this beer or get drunk to not care anymore. Not the worst beer i've tasted, but by far nowhere near the best."
"Overall, this beer is good for hot summer days when you're cutting the grass, or when you need a beer to drink on gameday. Not terrible but definitely not one I seek out outside of gameday."
"Pours a clear yellow color with lots of carbonation. Smells of grains and corn, slight smell of hops. The taste is not bad, but is nothing exceptional. I would take this over a bud light or coors light any day of the week. This is a light beer, but at least it has flavor. It is very drinkable, but nothing to write home about."
"Overall , this is a thirst quencher meant to have cold and out of a can or bottle. One could drink these all day, they are inoffensive and have some flavor."
"It is a light yellow color and smells like corn and sweetness. Very drinkable, unlike other American macros (Bud Light). I pick this up occasionally and always know what to expect : a thirstquenching beer with no pretensions."
"Pours out a gold color with some carbonation and head, but nothing out of the ordinary for a light beer. The smell is of regular hops, not much going on. Not offensive, but not impressive either. The taste is refreshing and smooth, but lacking in hops and alcohol as most light beers are. Not too much malt or hops flavor, but there is a bitter after taste. Feels pretty carbonated in your mouth, but you could probably down a good case pretty quickly because of its light and flavorless nature. Overall, probably one of the better light beers, but still lacks what you would call a ""good beer"". Miller Brewing did a good job making a beer that the every day consumer would drink, but probably not up to par for a serious beer lover."
"Overall: Seriously, why bother? I'm not just being mean. If your just trying to get hammered, drink a few shots or something. Maybe drink one of those flavored malt beverages, at least it has some flavor."
"D: Goes down easy since there's really nothing to it - but why drink something so flavorless unless your objective is to drink for hours upon hours without falling into a coma?"
"D: A terrible beer, this will be my lowest review on this site. I know I'm ranting, but my body had a bad reaction to this overprocessed crap. Save your money and buy a real beer, or least a Bud Light, which for a light beer is not horrible. True pilsner? Yeah right, drink a fuckin' Czechvar or Urquell if you wan't a real pilsner, in conclusion, the worst beer I have ever had. This is the antithesis of beer, everythng we been striving for, going back to tradition for 9000 years, there's no need to drink this shit."
"Overall, this is probably the best ""light"" offering of the three main macro producers. I still think that PBR Light is a superior light offering, though it's nowhere near as ubiquitous as Miller Lite."
"Great drinkability. Drink it cold and fast. It's what it's for. This is the beer I pick if I find myself in unfortunate bmc-only situations."
"While it may not be the most popular or best selling light beer in America, Miller Lite is definitely the best tasting. That point cannot be argued. As far as light beers go, Miller presents us with much more taste and mouthfeel than other leading light beers. The only light beer that can rival it is Sam Adams Light. I am a big fan of paying for and drinking better beers, however, if I plan to drink all night (maybe a little in excess) the beer that I choose is one that I can handle a lot of and enjoy the taste: Miller Lite."
"I think the masses flock to this mainly thanks to clever marketing more than anything."
"One of the better light macro brews on the market. In the overall beer spectrum, not great, but if you need a lot cheap beer with a decent taste, Miller's the way to go. Pours a light, almost clear, yellow and offers little in the way of aroma. If you are in to light macro brews, this is the way to go."
"Pours a faint yellow color with no head. A slight sweetness in the nose, and the same in taste. It is a clean beer, with no aftertaste. I do not say I like this beer, but there is not much to say. Smooth and does not have a major taste profile. I guess that is why the masses drink this, but it is non offensive."
"Uhmmm. what can I say? It pours a piss yellow with a light head and it has a bit higher carbonation than it should . The aroma smells of corn and barley; the taste is non-existent. It goes down fairly easily. That said, its best drunk when fishing all day."
"Pours a Light/clear yellow color with a head that fizzles immediately upon pour. Aroma is light and somewhat sweet, smells of adjuncts as usual. Taste is light and crisp with almost no backbone or flavor. Much like drinking corn water. It does go down easily even after the syrupy consistency of it fades into the background. Certainly nothing special though. It's not Lite beer. It's just Lite."
"12 oz. bottle in a mug...thin, spongy lace evenly dissolves on a goldish-yellow, champagne bubbly body--plenty of action!...used to feeling this in the bottle or seeing it over a Silo cup...metallic malt odor--pure nostalgic rush a plus, weak character a minus...thin, spritzy attack on the sides of the tongue, the unmistakeable corn backlash at the throat....mass production rears itself here--breathing out as flavorful as swallowing in...the taste of plasticine carbonation and obtrusive malt...score a point for the taste of beer pong, regatta, three man, asshole, beer funnel, etc., that this beer has come to guiltily associate itself with... a backyard brew for away games ONLY....on reflection, too much to say about a beer that Im overly familiar with and couldnt be much less interested in... but this is my wifes favorite, so I must score with a loving heart..."
"Drinkability-None. Was like drinking water. This beer is similar to most light beers which is light(Lite?) on taste."
"Overall a very light light beer. Very drinkable for what it is however."
"Pours a clear straw color with a soapy white head that actually left some nice chunk lacing, to my suprise. Unfortunately, the smell is of grain, corny metallic twang, sweet, unpleasant. The taste is light, watery and grainy, corn like taste. The feel is watery and not as carbonated as other macros. Nothing great, good cooler beer."
"Super pale golden pour, moderate carbonation and better head than produced from a can. Smell is seriously hard to detect. Corn, cereal like scent is really all I get. Taste is basically absent. Some grains and the tiniest hint of hops. Mostly water and random adjuncts. Mouthfeel is light, watery, and doesn't do anything for me. Better and more active from a can or bottle. Overall it's drinkable but not if you have choices. From a can or bottle I think there is a little more to this beer."
""
"It the mouth it feels very light nothing great about this beer,there's plenty of other light beers that i think are best than this one,I don't see a reason to drink this beer anyway."
"Thankfully things have changed."
"A solid example of an above-average light lager. Having consumed a lot of light lager (lots of variety and lots of consumption), I feel safe saying that this compares favorably to Bud Light and Coors Light, not to mention Keystone, Busch, etc. Considering that the style is designed to be low ABV, subdued ""smooth"" taste that is as inoffensive as possible, this one is right on. Don't hate the player, hate the game..."
"D- lets face it Beers like this have an exceptionally high drinkablity. A person can drink these all day with out a problem that is what makes these beers popular."
"I'm just glad I didn't buy it."
"well what can you say its just another standard light domestic that is just a bit better than coors or bud. Just as most people that take the time to come to a beer site like this I am a snob when it comes to beer. Sometimes I drink miller lite in the .99 plastic bottles when I'm broke like right now. If I could find Yeungling in 16 oz bottles I would never drink miller lite again during low fund times. So yeah Miller is just what it is miller shite. Hebrew Lenny Bruce!!! Now thats a beer."
"I'm wondering if this is actually beer, it really tastes like water. Pours a pale yellow hinting it might be beer. No smell, no beer taste, just carbonated water. Mouthfeel the same. Overall it is quite refreshing on a hot day, but if you are expecting this to be a beer, you are wrong."
"I grew up on this one, its my sesion beer, and my dad typicaly has a keg of it out in the garage. That being said this is the best of the lite or ""light"" macros. It flows like water because lets face it, it smells and taste much like water. For me it hits the spot on a hot day better then any craft brew, and i would recomend pairing it with mowing a lawn or something."
"unfortunately, i have had this one WAY too many times. when you're growing up in chicagoland, it is unavoidable. keggers as a teen, $10 buckets at shithole bars, girlfriends...i can never escape the presence of this beer. but hey, it won gold at the gabf!!! that must mean something, right? the only good thing i can say about this beer is that it's better than bud light or coors light. if you squint your eyes really hard and pray like pat robertson you can actually detect some vegetal hop aromas in it! super light, super fizzy, super tasteless..."
"Yanked out of company fridge. Long day, need a beer... unfortunately, I don't need this one. Pours a limpid gold without much head. Corny, sweet grain nose. Taste is slightly better than ordinary Miller, surprisingly enough: it's bland, but lacks unpleasant corniness of the ordinary beer. Just a little sweet grain and then the taste fades away. Medium body, very neutral texture."
"Not good, but at the same time, you hopefully are at a party or something where you aren't bored enough that the taste of this beer is the most interesting part of your night. If you are, it's probably a sign you need to leave!"
"I guess with note true malt and no hops, it was balanced pretty well!"
"D: You could drink a dozen and not realize it. It's light beer for a reason I guess."
"Drinkability- Medium in the filling range, mildly filling."
"Drinkability: Good social beer that can definitely be repeated, but isn't the extra 5 bucks worth it?"
"Tasteless yellow fizzy beer."
"Pours a pale golden yellow with a one finger white head that initially goes down quickly and then doesnt fully disappear, with a decent amount of lacing on the glass. Aroma is basically non existant a bit of sweet grain. Taste is typical of the style with a bit of sweet grain again and minimal hops and a bit of corn. Mouthfeel is light. I've had worse of this style but certainly doesnt have a spot in my fridge."
"sure. its drinkable. good throwback beer. not my throwback of choice but its what the people like."
"Drinkability: Pretty easy to drink, but isn't that the point of light beer? Probably not worth it if you really want a beer to sit back and enjoy."
"As for taste there is nothing special to it, just kinda run of the mill. It is very clear and yellow as far as appearance."
"overall this has the potential if served very very cold to be refreshing but i would not recommend it"
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: Very light bodied and goes down very easy. I remember drinking a lot of these years ago. Overall, this is probably my favorite light macro. Since developing a taste for fine beer, I rarely drink it. But, I'd take this over the other light macros available, especially on a hot summer day. In that setting, it's not so bad. Definitely not recommended though."
"Overall: Miller Lite would be my choice of light beers if there were any point to them."
"Well because you have to I am gonna try some macros and just put my thoughts out there. Here is the first. Poured a pale yellow, with tons of visible carbonation, big frothy head faded instantly revealing a clear bubbly liquid. No smell, maybe a bit musty but really nothing. Taste was so watered down and bland. Light grain taste, but drink it cold because once it warms its done. Smooth and deeply carbonated, drinks like a soda. The only reasonable points it gets are for drinkibility, if it is ice cold goes down well, if its warm, watch out!"
"clear pale yellow with a puny saliva head. thin, watery, cold, fizzy. flavored beer water. slight barley malts, slight hops, lots of corn, lots of rough grainy texture. not very well blended, but that hardly matters since there is so little body to begin with. not undrinkable by any means, but by no means desirable."
"One of the better light beers out there, in my opinion. Of course, the appearance is that of light yellow carbonated water with a white foamy head that dissipates quickly, but the taste is surely better than a Coors Light. The high level of carbonation doesn't do much for the mouthfeel of this brew, but the drinkability is solid. Basically, I got this at a pub that had a ""free beer with any entree"" night, and it went well with my fish combo platter."
"Miller Lite is even worse in the bottle. If you absolutely have to drink this beer make sure it's on Draft!"
"This is more drinkable in the summer when a good light thirst quencher might be needed."
"Holy shit. I used to drink this beer non stop before I got into craft beer. WHAT THE FUCK happened to me? This beer was HORRIBLE. I had to drink keystone light this weekend which I hated as well, but it had no flavor at all so I didn't care that much. This has a gross adjunct and cheap malt flavor. Oh my god, it was gross. I can't believe that I used to like this beer."
"In its defense, I would choose this every time over bud or Coors light, but thats not saying much."
"On the bright side, it has fewest calories of the Big 3 (for what that's worth) and only has a whisker more carbs than Michelob Ultra (also for what that's worth). Ironically, part of my Vendome run involved purchasing a bottle of the latter, which I may soon regret. We'll find out tomorrow."
"12 brown bottle with pull date of 04/09/07. Pours out a pale, light golden yellow. Artifical fizzy white head that doesnt last long with minimal lacing. The smell is of cereal grains, mostly corn. Light corn taste with a very little in the way of hop bitterness. Off flavors develop as the beer warms. This beer was made to be pounded down quick, not savored."
"Nothing special here, as most already know by now. Probably one of the better light macro lagers. There is a semblence of pilsner characteristics, but hardly a ""true pilsner beer"". For what it's worth, I'd take this over a Bud Light if those were the only two options."
"This was the same as all other highly advertised BMCs. Aroma is grainy, flavor is bland and palate is stale. Cheap and tolerable when its served very cold, and there is nothing else available, but needs to be avoided if other decent, non-BMC choices,. If I I have to drink a hgihly marketed ""light"" beer, Ill stick with Amstel."
"A friend of mine drinks this constantly, and wanted me to review it, he was not to happy what he read. It is a pale yellow color with a pillowy white head an inch and a half high, that disappates quickly away. A light floral aroma can be smelt, but nothing else is very present in the scent. The taste, what taste, there has to be more flavor in a bottle of water than this, wait there is some bitterness. No, its gone, no wait its back, now its gone, okay the flavor is schizaphranic. A very thin and watery mouthfeel, with alot of carbonation, I mean alot. Man, my friend drinks alot of this stuff, is almost afraid to try a beer I want him to try. This must be security blanket or something for him, because I can't get one bottle down and somtimes I wonder how he does."
"Beer pours a golden color that has a nice head with tight beaded bubbles that are quick to recede. Not much a hop aroma nor does it have much malt character which is within style. Has a watered down taste, but all in all if you are looking for a cheap beer for a hot summer day it will do in a pinch."
"It is what it is, goodfor someone watching their calories and doesn't like a lot of flavor."
"D - Drinkable for me as a session beer? No. But for the person who enjoys light lagers, this would probably fit right in. Definitely goes down like soda, but I suppose that would qualify as a drinkable beer for the category. So I can't really attack SABMiller because they're putting out what their customers want."
"It's like three quarters water, one quarter beer. It smells almost as bad as it tastes. I have a friend who drinks this stuff religiously. Every time I go to his house, he offers me one, and every time he does, I politely refuse it."
"Drinkability: If watery beer is your thing, have at this one. If you want to drink 15 to get buzzed and have to piss every 5 minutes, drink on. Not worth buying."
"One of the better macro light beers, but that isn't saying much. All Miller Lite really has going for it is that it's easy to pound and the taste is inoffensive. Has almost no smell or taste except for that of grainy sugar water. I really couldn't muster more than a glass of this."
"OK, go ahead and pour it in a glass. I poured pure terror. I am terrified by urine. Head gone instantly. Smells like a corn field, and a hangover. Taste is like corn mixed with water, alcohol, and carbon dioxide. Feels like water in your mouth, maybe a bubble will sneek up on you. Finish makes you want scope. Drinkability is less than zero. If I come to your house and you offer me this, don't let the screen door hit me in the ass on the way out."
"Drinkable only if very cold or at the end of the night if you are wanting to stay drunk."
"Drink-Ability: A very light beer that I do not recommend on drinking when there are so many great beers to drink other than this."
"This ole brew pours a fizzy yellow , bit of lacin , and head comprised of large white bubbles. The smell is very thin and , some hints of grain, adjunct. Taste is also a watery , light corny/ ghost grain flavor. Crisp carbonation and a clean (but boring) profile make it easy drinking under the sun at a nascar race , but its just a below average light swill beer. It is better than mich ultra , but thats not saying much."
"Good switch off from Coors Light in case you want to switch it up during you're drinking. If out with friends at a local bar where this is served, will go for it sometimes. When poured, develops a decent head without a too impressive smell. Tastes slightly sweeter than Coors Light and very watery. Very carbonated so harder to drink, but still an overall decent beer."
"I chose over bud light any day, and Coors Light above Miller Lite."
"Had one at a friend's house; my first Miller Lite in over a year. I drank this beer quite a bit in college and chose it at the bar when my only other choices were Bud and Coors. Now, I don't go unless there's other choices."
"Drinkability: I usually end up drinking these when I'm on vacation with friends for the purpose of getting drunk and only after my beer is all gone. This is actually where this beer came from."
"A solid macro. I split a pitcher with two buddies. For a macro it wasn't bad. There wasn't much head from the pour, but it actually looked like it had a fair about of head in the pitcher, with a very good amount of retention (meaning that if I order a macro). No lace at all. Don't drink and review."
"D=This is a beer you can drink all night without getting sick of it."
"Well, this has been in my fridge for a while after a party I had - so I figured what the hell....let's see how it rates. It poured a very clear pale yellow with a thick head that fell quickly. The smell is faint and slightly skunky. The taste is very mild and a bit uninteresting. The mouthfeel is very thin. The drinkability of this is fair, not exciting, but it does go down."
"The taste improves the more you drink, but why??"
"Is very light, but doesn't go down as easy as I would like. It is light and should be smooth, but the carbonation dances a little too much on the palate. A little too fizzy for my liking. It's watery, yet seltzery. If it were a night of cheap pitchers, I could probably knock quite a few of these back. As for enjoying at home, better to pick up something else."
"Overall - Drink and swallow. Letting things linger in the mouth just tend to make this unpleasant experience even worse."
"Overall, this is not drinkable. The bad taste just wouldn't get me to try more. There are better light lagers out there."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Razor sharp carbonation harshly envelops the mouth and tongue, becoming less prickly but still grating overall. There is a dry finish which I find positive, but that's all. This type of beer is the reason that people say ""I hate the taste of beer""... there's nothing but cheap filler to taste, and it's all that most people know exists."
"Get my buzz on- n"
"Miller Lite was a very clear light golden color with a short white head the managed to skick around for about a minute. The smell was very light. There in not much in the wayof taste either, but there is a little something there. The mouthfeel is very light with plenty of carbonation. It's not too bad once you get through two or three cans."
"Considering the beer style and the other macro lights, Miller lite wins hands down(except when compared to SA light).A: Light yellow with little carbonation, head or lacing. S: Corn, grain and other adjuncts with maybe the slightest trace of mild hops T: This has more taste than Coors, and esp Bud but that's about it. A little body with the mildest of grain and corn taste, but not too bad considering. I drank half of a Bud light just prior to this and had I reviewed it then I probably would have given 4's across the board by comparison. M: thin and watery D: Pretty darn good esp. in hot weather and as a palate cleanser from Bud light. Miller Lite was the good stuff in high school and college. Thank God I'm not in high school and college anymore."
"Cheers!"
"if you have someone who is truly in-the-know on macro's they will attest that this is one of the most 'natural', if not least adjunct ridden brews in the catagory. The brewing process of this one is really held at a little higher standard than some of the others in the catagory, and the result is a notch above for that reason. Not good... but better than BudLt, Michlt, Bud, or any other masspro AB product for sho."
"Had a pitcher of this with my Father at the local Sports bar. Straw yellow with tons of carbonation. No aroma. Served ice cold. After the carbonation assault, a taste of cooked corn came through. Hints of old socks, and shoes made themselves known before the cooked corn returned for the finish. This beer is so full of adjuncts that it should be given a different name. It's been years since I've drank one of these that I truly forgot how awful they are. Couldn't finish my glass."
"If all you want is to quench your thirst and have something beer-ish without having the alcohol overpower you, this does the job just fine. I can see myself drinking this again if it's available at a party, but it's a safe bet that I'd never buy this for myself."
"Once again..I must consider the style when reviewing a beer. Pours a very light yellow color with a small head, and little retention or lacing (poured from a bottle into a mug). Has little smell to it...standard cheap beer smell to it. Has a lighter beer taste to it...tastes kind of like a pilsner. Light feel in the mouth with a good amount of caronation. For a domestic light beer not too bad...better than Bud Light IMHO..."
"You have to rate beer by what it is. Miller Lite is the original light beer and is the only premium american light beer worth drinking. Good color, aroma, and taste. Does not have that skunk smell that bud light has. Truly the best american light beer. Great Taste....Less Filling"
"There is really nothing to be enjoyed about this beer other than the thirst quenching sting in the throat from all of the carbonation. Drink this ice cold and as quickly as possible....it really is very refreshing."
"Big name american light beer. That's what it is. Not worth the price for me. watered down high life pretty much, hell I don't think its a bad beer at all, I just don't see the attraction. Pretty average light beer. Thin, light body, dry after taste."
"Does Miller taste great? Hardly! The flavor is one of very light cereal grains and there is almost no hop character at all. A distinct adjunct taste makes you wonder exactly what is used in the recipe to lighten the taste and lower the cost. Regardless of what they use, Miller Lite is a forgettable brew that only sells because of its emphasis on lower calories and carbs and because of the abundance of advertising. Otherwise, it's about as close to a glass of colored water as any macro- brewed beer on the market."
"Pours light yellow with white head. Seems to retain the head pretty well. Smells like corn and grains. Taste is grainy, no hops I can detect. It is crisp and thirst quenching. Mouthfeel is thin and watery, with a great deal of carbonation. It is relatively drinkable, especially after working in the yard, but there isn't a lot of quality to appreciate here."
"Overall I might pick this up in the future to enjoy after working in the sun. Nothing special about this beer though."
"Pourded into a wheat glass, color is a light yellow gold with alot of carbination and little head that recedes in a few seconds, no lacing. Taste is of watered corn with a slight hind of oats, not very impressive taste more like water than anything. I'm not impressed by this lite lager no taste I guess it would be good for a cheap alternative, but I would pass."
"Drinkability- A better choice than some beers for college drinking games, but that's about all this is good for... Mouthfeel is terrible and detracts from the few good aspects of the beer."
"¡Salud!"
"This beer is just bland. Watered down, mediocre beer. It's drinkable, but so is water. I'll give Miller this, it doesn't taste bad. Unfortunately it doesn't taste good, nor does it taste much like beer. One good thing: it doesn't give me a headache like Bud products do."
"From the can, it tastes much like the bottle. Typical of American Pilsners, the brew is flavored with adjunct grains, but that's what makes it taste better than weaker lagers. Still quite malty sweet for the style with a rice or corn flavor and texture. Lightly vegetal. Hopped for earthiness and a bitter balance. The can seemed to give up a light metalic flavor that I found distracting. Though not very good, this is my usual 'ball-game' beer."
"There are plenty worse macro-lights. It might be okay if it's the only choice at a summer party or similar occassion, but not a true pilsener as it claims, and very watery and boring."
"One of those beers I have had way to much of and just happened too have an extra bottle from the weekend. Appearance is pale yellow with light carbonation, with abosolutely no head retention (if any head at all). No strong overtones in the smell, just smells like any average american light beer. Taste is smooth with a somewhat stronger malty aftertaste."
" Pretty good for a light beer, nothing special, nothing too terrible. Ta Ta."
"Looks pretty decent in the glass. Actually has some color to it, and a big foamy head. Smells like...beer, kind of grainy, a little musty, kind of like a keg party. Not too much flavor to describe really, a little bit of malt, and a little bit metallic, but nothing totally offensive. A whisper of aftertaste. The mouthfeel is fizzy and...fizzy. Overally drinkability is not horrible, probably due to the fact that the beer is engineered to be minimally offensive to any of your senses. As far as light beer goes, this one isn't horrible."
"D: It is okay, but a little sharp at the end of a long chug."
"Overall. I dont like it, and i do not consider it a good beer. but if offered, i wouldnt decline, and i wouldnt say this is worse than bud light or coors light. It is what it is, and it is what it is trying to be"
"Had one warm just to see what the flavors were really like, and blllaaahhhh corn up the ying yang! Had another two, now Ice Cold, didn't pour the first very aggressive and left literally no head. Second one poured very aggressive and produced a soapy, foam additive kind of head. Had to cut the top off like you would to a Stella to keep the head around, which still only lasted about two minutes, until it was a ring. Honestly, if youre going for the light beer on a budget, I'd go with Bud Light JUST BECAUSE it has no flavor, this is like a bad, adjunct-y lager that's been in storage for a year. I'm just wonder if Miller has some weird process that makes their beer taste stale, because I notice the exact same thing in MGD, yet not High Life, maybe its just the filterization. Anyways, about twice as yellow, piss looking as a Heineken, yet actually produces a decent mouthful. And the smell seems to get better when there is less of it, so the finish is actually pretty satisfying. From what I've realized, its better in bottles for some reason, and from the bottle, not into a glass, seems to cut the corn adjunct out of it. Overall, decent for why people drink it, but for a light beer, I'd go with Amstel, even for its price."
"Out of the big three macro light lagers (Coors, Bud, and Miller), this is the most tolerable. As usual, it must be ice cold to be drinkable. The pour is very boring as well as the body of the beer. The mouthfeel is very light and watery. As for the taste, it's just a light beer with just a slight hint of hop and lemon/corn flavor. Overall, it tastes like very light beer with not much to talk about. If I have to drink a macro light beer, this is tolerable."
"Out of the 3 big macro brewery light beers. Coors Light, Bud Light, Miller Lite, I think this one takes the crown. Not by much, but this is just slightly more drinkable then the rest."
"Sent in with a massive trade by beerrun13 so I felt I had to review it. Ok color-not as pale as I expected. Fluffy white head. Low aroma-rather just ""there"" then anything resembling a beer as we know it. Ok flavor-it tastes somewhat like beer at first but it is gone all too qucikly. Reminds me of the dry beers of a few years ago. Somewhat of a grainy/corn flavor. No real body whatsoever. At least BUD has some ""umph"" to it but theres nothing here. Ok overall for what it is trying to be. I think you have to try these beers with an open mind as to what theyre are meant to be. (Check my review of BUD-as a macro I think its great). This really has little if any flavor or body. If I wanted to slam a beer after mowing the lawn or have somewhat of a beer flavor with a plate of spicy food ok it might work. For everyday drinking/enjoyment-I think not."
"If you drink something often enough and long enough you end up getting used to it. There's a whole generation out there which has grown up thinking this is what light beer should taste like. If you must have light beer, Shiner Light or Amstel Light is the way to go. Don't drink this nasty stuff."
" Eric"
"But there's salvation for this beer, if your want to keep in shape and drink low carb beer, this a good option, around 95 carbs per bottle is one of the lowest in the market right now, so, 2 tumbs up for M.Lite"
"This is probably my favorite macro, especially out of BMC. I compared this to Bud Light last night since it happened to be available at my buddy's house, and I really prefered Miller."
"Easy to drink but no flavour."
"This is beer for those who do not like beer, the only time I would ever drink this beer is if it was offered free of charge (free beer is always good)."
"The most pale color I've ever seen, almost seems to have no color, white head for a moment, leaves no lacing. Smells slightly flowery with strong astringency, I just can't find anything good about it. Astringent taste, hops present, but what kind, these seem like they have been altered. I would expect Saaz hops, these just seem terrible. Lower carbonation, extremely light body. I couldn't finish one of these, glad I got the can from a friend, but seriously give me a Pabst anyday."
"Light Yellow color with a small white head. Putrid, sickening aroma of algae, mop water, green plants and pale malts. Torturous, unrelenting flavor. I could barely choke down this stuff. Ive now tried and rated Bud Light, Coors Light and this stuff, and this is by far the worst. Id rather drink ocean water."
"This is my typical choice when I am out and the only options are the ""big 3"". Pours a golden straw color with lively carbonation and a decent head with little retention. Taste is better than most in the American light lager category but nothing to write home about."
"Overall not impressive."
"Miller lite... ahh my first ""true"" love (whatever that is). I must say this is my favorite beer in this range primarily because it actually has a beer flavor rather than a water/piss flavor. The appearance is by far the best of this range, slightly darker yellow than most domestic light beers. Little lace is left behind by this beer but enough to satisfy a moderately undiscriminating beer drinker, or at least someone who keeps in mind the quality of this beer. The taste is slightly bitter with some sweet overtones. I actually like the aftertaste but it fades quickly. the mouthfeel is thin, but that is to be expected from a light beer. You can drink this beer all night if you can handle it because it does go down nicely and continues to taste good. If you drink another domestic light beer try this out, you may be suprised, if you don't drink domestic light beer, you rock."
"The bottom line is that I had some of this because it was free, and I still felt that I'd made a bad choice by leaving store brand Root Beer in the cooler and having it."
"Appears a fizzy yellow tone with a large bubbled white head leaves thin fine lacing. Aroma is full of cereal grains straight from the corn, rice, and barley categories some light hop character thrown in but overall uninteresting to me. Taste at least attempts to have a hop profile as the ""true pilsner"" this beer claims to be great for mass consumption low sweetness very light bitterness pretty clean overall. Mouthfeel is light carbonated water esque with a carbonation factor that tickles the throat. Drinkability hot summer cookout with friends it's safe other than that steer away from this one, if your looking for a great taste. Good commercials at times...hand me a Sunshine Pils."
"For starters, people you have to remember what you are drinking here. Its cheap, therefore your standards should be thrown out the window when rating it. I tend to only drink this beer when i'm in either A) a bar that serves nothing but the common American beers or B) out fishing w/ a few friends and knowing we are only going to go drink. Most of my friends do not drink the good stuff so we have to settle on something like this. Now, drinkability, I don't like this stuff for the most part and would never buy this to enjoy a beer, but weighing it against its competitors, its a little better than the bud lights & coors lights of the world. I choose this beer out of the options when going fishing w/ the buddies. Then, I shotgun every other can and this beer seems to be a good shotgun beer. As far as appearance, its yellow pee color w/ a light head (typical for the type). Taste is watery w/ little flavor & carbonated. Though, it shotguns easy so I made it a 2.5 and drinkability is higher b/c of that as well. When drinking this beer... Just go get drunk and catch a fish or something people... but don't buy it to enjoy during a football game or eating dinner."
"D- At a keggar, sure it could be drinkable but not to be enjoyed"
"This beer is just not drinkable. Sad to say, I would rather just drink water."
"Pours a three finger, white head that quickly fades leaving some lacing. Insipid pale yellow color. Very light carbonation and very light bodied. Faint skunky nose. Has a tinny watery flavor, faint hops in the background, good lawnmower beer if you can stand the tinny flavor. $4.99 for a 6-pack from Market Basket Concord, NH. Needed to buy this stuff for a party, amazing how quick it goes!!"
"Less of a beer and more of a way of life/business mandate for me. My occupation demands that I drink this often and in mass. When Im out with work people (even at a good beer bar) I frequently have to stick to ML or perhaps High Life in order to keep up. Work sometimes dictates that I drink more than 10 beers in a night and I can down 10 MLs and still be sober. Try that with any craft and youre toast. I dont usually mind it too much, ML in the bottle makes for a decent session. If its ice cold and in a can its reminiscent of a camping or fishing trip for me. Either way its ok. On tap is a different story. ML on tap is just piss and indigestion in a glass. Forget about it even when its free. ML looks like corn colored piss. It tastes like water and pilsner malt when ice cold and corn syrup when cold to warm. It smells the same as it tastes. It doesnt give much of a buzz. It IS LESS FILLING! Its way better than bud light, thats for damned sure. Since we are supposed to review within the style here on BA, Ive gotta give this beer props. Its about the best you can do in this pathetic style."
"I will say this about Miller Lite, compared to Bud Light and Coors Light, I think it is far superior."
" It does have it's place. As light lagers go, it does seem to have a bit more flavor than your average macro ""light""."
"Great thirst quencher when water isn't enough but beer would be too much."
"The beer was the usual Light Macro color of straw yellow color with a small fizzy white head. What seperated this one was the fizzy head of foam dissipated into small traces of lace around the glass. There wasn't much of an aroma (I'm not surprised), except for the faint smell of watery malt and that's it. It had a complex taste of corn, rice, other grains, and water. The kind of taste that I expected to be in this and the kind of taste you really don't want in a beer. The mouthfeel was flavorless, light, and of course watery! I did expect the light, but it could at least have some kind of flavor. It was ok for a light cheap beer and might make a nice summer light drink. They are right when they say it's less filling."
"Poured from a 12oz. aluminum can into a pint glass. Appearance is a clear straw-colored bright yellow, thin white fuzzy head fell quickly to the slightest white lacing. Smell is weak grains, slight maltiness with practically no real aroma whatsoever. Taste is watery, slight appreciable hop flavor, might consider a slight step up from the average light macro. Easy drinking moderate carbonation, low abv, very cheap. This beer is easily my favorite national brand light beer, which isn't saying a whole lot, but it is easily tolerable compared with it's direct competition. Might purchase for certain occasions, maybe as house stock for friends who don't appreciate better beer."
"The only beer at a party so I had to drink it if I wanted beer. Out of the can, clear almost like water. Taste was hard to distinguish from water. The tiniest bit of malt, perhaps, no hops. It's hard to rate something that is nonexistent. I would drink this as a thirst quencher, ice cold if I were dying of thirst and nothing else was available. THere's an old joke that goes like this; what do sex in a canoe and light beer have in common? They're both f---ing close to water. This beer fits the description."
"The beer is a light yellow beer, with a thin consistency. It's a nice beer for hot days watching baseball or just hanging out. It's nice when you want a beer but it is hot and sticky out so you want something that has a thin thickness. It's watery, but refreshing. As long as you aren't looking for a beer to savor, and you just want something more than water. It has a little bit of a metal flavor, but is still a cool, refreshing beer."
"D- this beer is very easy to drink. almost too easy, if you get my drift. this is a beer of last resort for me. if i'm totally unhappy with the selection a bar has, i may order one but that's the only scenario in which i see myself drinking this again."
"Looks crystal clear straw color with a head that goes to nothing quickly. Smells of boiled corn and some sort of household cleaning solution. Tastes of practically nothing, it is the taste I associate with a macro produced lager and I must say it still makes me cringe just a little. Mouthfeel I might as well as be drinking carbonated water, a coke or pepsi has more body. Damn drinkable if you don't mind the taste and with a slice of pie it will do."
"Easy to drink if thirsty, and it probably goes down on a hot day, but this is the first time I've had this beer in many years, and I sure didn't miss it!"
"So it pours out a light yellow fizzy beer. Not very impressive, but not horrible. Smells very faint hints of what are pilsner type hops. It doesn't really taste bad. It doesn't have the delicious hop I love to find in taste. It just tastes too watered down, but it is a bit refreshing, and much better out of the bottle. Unlike some other macro light lagers that I think taste tinny and too artificial. The mouthfeel is fine. Light and refreshing. It just doesn't have enough to keep me interested to drink it for long."
"Take it for what it is a beer to eat buffalo wings with or to wash down that bacon cheeseburger."
"Had this on tap at a place that really didn't have many choices for beer. What's there to say, really? Typical fizzy yellow American macro lite beer. Tastes like adjunct. I can drink a lot of these, but I'd really rather have something better. Recommended as lawnmower beer, or for beer bongs."
"Pours a bright light yellow color with minimal head retention. Very faint smell could not pick up any noticeable scents. Taste is not good, but is alright for an american macro, watery with some malts. Highly carbonated mouthfeel. Only drink this when it's free, so it's not as bad."
"ok, i am not a big american beer drinker, so when i went out the my friends bought a pitcher of this, i was like i not paying for it so i'll try to drink it. It wasn't bad compared to lets say Bud Light. But it was very light in color, lighter than urine. It had no smell or anything that would give even a blind person a hint it was beer. The taste wasn't bad, but watery, neither tasting great, and very less filling. Let this be a lession, buy what you drink and don't let other buy for you!"
"D  This was my session beer of choice. And still not bad with pizza every once in awhile for nostalgia sake."
"The most offensive thing about Miller Lite (and this goes for pretty much all macro brews) is their marketing approach. These companies tout their products as if they are god's gift to beer drinkers. Miller Lite's well-traveled claim to be ""a true pilsner beer"" is pretty much an insult to the entire Czech Republic. Sorry, people of Plzen, turns out that beer you invented and have been brewing for all these years is a mere imposter. Next time, try adding some corn and a whole lot of water."
"I guess I'm writing this review because this beer is, despite its awful taste, is connected to so many memories from high school to college to even a few months of post-college football watching. I'm at a point now where I avoid these types of beers at all cost, because regardless of their ""low-cal"" designation, I would rather enjoy my beer and have to be on the treadmill for 5 extra minutes than to suffer through another one of these watered-down brews. The BA ""avoid"" designation pretty much says it all. Leave this one to the college kids who don't know (or can't afford) any better."
"This is usually the beer that I would save until I was drunk enough not to even care. However, it still tastes bad even when my taste buds are muted. The color in any container is a very pale yellow color with some anemic head that quickly fades  no lacing. You can look at the color and tell we are talking adjuncts. The smell is like wet cardboard and moldy hops. . The mouthfeel is fizzy and very, very light. The taste is tart bordering on astringent with some fizzyness around the tongue. It has some weak grainy flavor that strikes me as carbonated Malt-o-meal."
"DIt is what it is...a light beer. I drank this a lot in college and wanted to review it because of that. Not anything offensive, but my taste in beer has changed quite a bit since college. I still drink this from time to time since it is my familys favorite beer and when I visit, it is usually what is in the fridge."
"Overall = This beer isn't offensive but why bother to drink it? You might as well drink water."
"Drinkability - 3rd tier of cheap macro-beers. I would get a Bud/Natty Light instead."
"Cheers2Beers"
"D = I guess you could drink a bunch of these, but why? they're $10 a 12pk and at that price I'd rather spend less money ($6 per 12pk) and get something better like pbr."
"Notes: For sure you have to drink this as fresh as possible. Even then just expect something to wash food down. Drink water."
"I didn't hate it."
"Drinkability -- I won't seek this one out again, but it's a fact I'll encounter it again living in Milwaukee. Given the choice, I'll drink soda over Miller Lite."
"This beer, at least for me, is rather drinkable. Compliments chips and salsa. Or maybe the chips and salsa were very good at covering the beer."
"If nothing else, Miller Lite is (marginally) better than Bud Light..."
"I'll still opt for more hops, more malt, more actual taste, and count us all lucky that such things are indeed in plentiful supply."
"Whatever the reason, we give in. We take it. What we find inside that can is watery. It looks like pee, has wierd vegetabale smells, and stings the mouth with its soda-ish carbonation. However, perhaps not unlike the company we find ourselves surrounded by this time of year, we endure it for the sake of togetherness. We are reminded that giving is truly about sacrifice, and that can maybe make us feel a little warmer in the gut. While this feeling is nice in its own way, once a year is, decidedly, enough."
"Drinkability- The only purpose of this ""beer"" is to get a buzz, and might I add, mission accomplished."
"Drinkability/notes  you can have quite a few of these. Not gonna blow you away of course but it is what it is. One of the best for the style."
"had this on-tap, bottle, kegs, 40's, can and so on. on drinkability, i'm going on two things. 1) for a light beer, i don't think it gets much better, which is saying a lot and a little at once 2) i could put many down with no complaint if that's the only brew on hand, best straight out the can or bottle, covers smell, eases drinkability"
"I had never had a miller lite, i new it would be shit, and i will never return. This came to me in a 20oz glass at macgregors. It was yellow piss with no head. The aroma of corn was barely existent. The taste was of chemicals and i couldn't make it all the way through. It even ruined my pallate, and the southern tier beers i had later were ruined because the lite melted my stomach. Not drinkable. Mouthfeel of ass."
"Drinkability: Light and not at all filling, this beer is good for mass consumption. An unpleasant aftertaste tends to accumulate following several beers, but eventually this one goes down easy like its close cousin, water."
"Pours an extra clear light straw. Thin and soapy head with poor retention and scarce lacing. Very light grain aroma and a whisper of grassy hops. The flavor is too light even for the style, watered down grain adjunct and a hint of spicy hops in the aftertaste. The high carbonation and light body produce a smooth but boring mouthfeel and the ultra light flavor leaves a clean but bland finish. Very easy to drink; but substituting drinkability for flavor doesn't score any points with me."
"This is the one that never leaves my fridge. I know it's not the creme de la creme of beers, but for an American style light/lite brew...it's what I consider the best. I do think it has more flavor than most light beers...not near as wattery. It's on my list as a great drinkable beer. I have other beers higher on my list...imports and micro brews, but again... it never leaves my fridge. Pretty darn good beer in my humble opinion."
"Drinkability - I have a case of Billy Beer from 1977 that is more drinkable. To paraphrase the immortal Snoopy, this beer wouldn't be drunk by a starving cat in a lifeboat."
"This is just a mess. Even for style, it's pretty bad. The main character is DMS, sulphury and thin. Insipid, vapid, and anorexic describe this ""beer"" very well."
"Well, not light, but it is still being in the avoiding beers field. I would bet it used to be better but the ambiscious made the owners to low the quallity. The foam is almost unexistant and did not really got the point about the difference with some other beers. At least is not that discusting as some other macro lagers."
"Strictly for beerbongs and kegstands."
"This beer used to be my choice prior to my conversion, I've had it twice since, and it has been awful, that speaks volumes."
"This beer is little more than carbonated water. Nice appearance in a glass but no taste to speak of. Not difficult to drink but not a substitute for real beer."
"This is my old standby. I drank this beer before transitioning to dark beer. I wouldn't say this is a bad beer but it is certainly no Oatmeal Stout. A large sect af people drink these macro's so it is clear that it is drinkable. Those of us fortunate enough to appreciate a dark beer don't care much for light beer as an everyday beer. But if macro's place is to be readily available at a reasonable cost then I think this beer fills that place nicely."
"Drinkability: Nothing great but not horrible either. Probably above average for a macro light beer not that that really means anything."
"poured a light yellow color with monstrous white puffy head. Smell is very non-offensive with only a slight sweetness noted. Taste is non-spectactular with only a slight sweetness present. Finished wet and refreshing. Good spacer. At least it doesn't taste bad."
"The taste is tinny but smooth. A typical lager taste without any bells and whistles. Very smooth and goes down easily. Not so unimpressed as I expected and would choose this over other macros."
"Overall: I don't drink this stuff unless it's free and I have no better options."
"So pours pale and head retention is so- so. Low bitterness and weak mouthfeel but has a little well...taste. I could drink many 'O these so drinkability is good. Nice finish on this light pilsner. I like that about this beer."
"Another Lite beer to review. Oh, joy. Appearance is the color of water with a hint of yellow. A hint of foam, but no lace. Aroma is devoid of all elements except a hint of barley. Initial taste is of grains and mild dextrose. Carbonation is abundant. Middle reveals a hint of metallic hops with a hint of citrus. Finish is unpleasant with a hint of aluminum. Take the hint, and pass."
"I think that it tasted good..only I could barely taste anything of any resemblance of a good beer. It poured a dark brownish color. It had little to no smell maybe a wheaty smell. It tasted like it was watered down and not good at all. My expectations were not high so I was not dissapointed."
"Clear light yellow color and lots of carbonation bubbles. The head is quite nice. Seems to stick around the glass for a while. Cooked corns and light lemon hops come out in the aroma. The taste is fairly clean. Grainy taste at first kind of sweet. Semi-dry metallic aftertaste. Light bodied with a pretty good drinkability, because of it's lightness. Better than most light beers but that still doesn't make it good. Next!"
"Not that bad for a light beer. I like it better than Coor's light. Had a metalic smell I did'nt like,but did'nt come through in the taste. This is an average beer. If you want to drink a light,give it a shot. Is the lowest in carbs of the lights as far as I know."
"I had a few in honor of Rusy Wallace's 'Last Call' on NASCAR. Spectactularly in-the-boat hot-summer-day swamp-buggy quality. Or NASCAR-like I guess. Very boring, no surprises, turn left, turn left again sort of way. Very pale gold pour with a fluffy white head that faded faster than a politicians reputation. Smelled of wonderbread on the nose, I remember the smell unfortunately. Just no discernable taste, perhaps marketed as beer extract or something. Made from concentrate, water added, I don't know. It doesn't offend and it feels fine, is easily drinkable, but it's just not worth remembering in any fashion."
"""more taste"" is their ad, but i dont know if thats a good thing in this case. if im drinking just to get drunk, anything will do and i will chose miller lite over many others, but ill never seek this out to drink for enjoyment."
"basicly tastes mostly like bottle. slight ""canesq"" taste but nothing to bark over. still pretty thing flavorwise, no suprises here.if there isnt much flavor to chamge then the can cant do too much harm. still perfer this over bud light..."
"Hey- what was the guy who reviewed before me thinking when he gave this a 4.45? Is he just yankin the chains?"
"12 oz. longneck served chilled. Pale gold body with fairly active carbonation that leaves a 1/4"" head and a decent amount of lace. Lots of adjuncts in the aroma - mostly corn. Pretty clean with a slight skunkiness and no hops to speak of. Pretty much the same on the palate. When swishing it in the mouth the slightest touch of biscuits shows through but you need to search for it. After swallowing, the adjuncts and carbonation drown out any potential flavor. The body is thin and crisp. As far as cheap lite lagers go, this isn't the worst, but I wouldn't make it a regular by any means."
"Again, this would be very useful, during a drought, to water my tomatoes. I also hear it is useful for slugs, how appropriate."
"straw yellow with almost zero head retention. the smell is grainy and starchy, no bad aromas, but none of the good ones either. maybe slightly floral on further inspection. the taste is of the starchy corny variety. the mouthfeel is pretty thin and seltzer like, nothing to hold onto. finishes dry. average drinkability. I've been known to choose this when nothing else decent is available. my vote for best macro light beer."
"Not so good, Al."
"Poured from the bottle, I tried my damndest to get this to create a head. Didn't work. Light straw body, very clear, bubbly. Smells of...not much really. I smelt the alcohol, some yeast and hint of grass. Tastes like...water. Water with a little bit of beer in it. Not impressive."
"Light carbonation and easy to drink. Still, it's not that good. Oh well, I still like it."
"Taste? Coors. Cerial. Kix in water. Slightly detectable hops presence but my impression was the same as Coors. Corn water. It was cold through the second inning, and didn't offend when warmer, next time I want a beer at the stadium, it will be worth the walk. Drinkable only if it's all that is available and isn't 5.50 for 16oz."
"This is definitely a pretty solid light lager. Certainly doesn't require or repay close study, though. So pair this with something spicy, an activity for which the beer is merely a throw-in or hot activity."
"Drinkability: This is a beer for ""girls"". Its easy to drink only because it has so little taste."
"Overall, it's not as bad as people seem to think. If left to choose between the three big American macro beers, I will pick this one."
"Shaker glass presentation. No head over the light straw brew, and no lacing either. Gets any points at all here because light beers are supposed to be light colored. Aroma is well, not offensive, because there isn't really one. Taste is lightly of sweet pale malts, and then all flavor is washed away by water, which there seems to be plenty of, leaving a bland bitter aftertaste. Mouthfeel is pretty neutral, gets dinged for lack of activity, and drinkability is high for volume, but low for desire to do so. It is what it is."
"Drinkability  I got this out of the guest tap at the Flying Pig in Everett and couldnt even finish the four ounce taster that they mistakenly brought me."
"All in all, not a bad beer, but if your out looking for something good, there are many other more suitable choices. Maybe this one is better for the buzz than it is for the taste. Yet still not a bad choice for the budgeted beer drinker."
"Notes: We had a party where everyone brought their own beer. No smirnoff, bacardi, skyy blue here. So my friend brings this, usually only drinking malternatives. I have never met a more tasteless beer. After a Guinness Extra Stout, I truly COULD NOT TASTE IT at all. Don't try to get people hooked on beer with this, as it is not an intro, but rather, a blasphemy to beer in general."
"My son calls this one a pork chop in a bottle. I have to agree, even the wife-zilla has to add a lime to it to make it drinkable. Skunky, old flavor that tastes like some one left an used leather shoe in the conditioning tank. If there is absolutely nothing else available, Id tough a few of these down  thanks be thats not the standard."
"Looks like the standard lite beer, light yellow, some lingering lace. Head disappears after a minute or two, and the taste is pretty straightforward, relatively sweet. I think in terms of lite beers this is definitely one of the best for price vs. value - way better taste than Bud Light, but not exactly up there with Sam Adams Light or anything. If you bashed it before, do a blind taste test among a few lite beers and see where you rank it, I guarantee it's near the top."
"I think most BA's steer clear of this, unless its one of those ""go to"" beers for them (I admit to drinking Bud and Busch Light). If that is the case, fine, I can't hold that against anyone, Miller sells ALOT of this beer, just not my choice. I still do like their advertisements, especially the old Tastes great! Less filling! comercials."
"Left in the fridge after New Years. Here goes. The beer pours a pale yellow color with a finger and a half of head from a very aggressive pour, but it falls to mothing. The nose is typical sweet grainey American macro. Flavor is interrupted with a huge bit of carbonation. At least its better than a Bud product. The fell is all about the carbonation, almost stinging. Overall, not a beer I would keep around, even for guests. Still, better than a Bud."
"Definitely one of the better light macros, but it was wierd grabbing it out of my fridge right next to the Stoudt bottle whose cap read ""craft beer."" Pours a piss yellow but with a darker core inside the glass. The beer, surprisingly, has an ever so mild hoppy flavor, but there is not much else to it. Very easy to drink because there is not much to it. But it is highly carbonated and will lead to burping."
"This is a true American classic. Note, American. This is as domestic as you can get, but when you cannot afford those great expensive beers (or when you get to that point that you cannot tell the taste) this is what you go for. If ever in Milwaukee, I highly recomend the tour of Miller Brewing and the free sample of this beer. The fresh clean taste will make you have a new appreciation."
"12 ounce can. Pours out clear with slight yellow tinge. Unimpressive fizzy white head that doesnt last long. The smell is rather like soap. Corn taste with a very small amount of hop bitterness. The grain tastes intensify when the beer warms, so if youre going to drink this, drink it quick. Watery consitency. Not the worst beer out there, as it is too light on flavors to be overly unpleasant. Still, theres not much going for it."
"Okay, today's the 150th anniversary of Miller so why not review Miller Lite today? Actually my wife couldn't finish hers and I couldn't see 18 of her 22 ounces going to waste. I've always enjoyed Miller compared to Coors or Bud Light, perhaps many a college night enjoying this for some reason. No appearance or smell to speak of, but the mouthfeel wasn't too bad tonight. Tried much much worse, but there's so many better options out there. I'm not going to sound like a beer snob this time."
"Reflection: I have a friend who's brother works for Miller so every time he's over he brings some crappy beer. I figure I might as well review them if their in the house. This is a quick review Pass on this beer!"
"Lacks the disappearing quality of Bud or Coors ... leaves a little lingering ""beery"" flavor. It's crap, IMO better than the other two Big Boy's ""light"" beers. If you gotta go cheap, go ""High Life""."
"Poured a very pale yellow with a 3 finger head.Head lasted only a few minutes until gone.Smells like typical macrow brew {i think they all smell kinda pukey,esp coors lite}.Taste,, well lack of,, its a very tolerable beer ,not much taste so you cant say its bad . My usual beer if theres nothing worthwhile at the bar. Best thing about this stuff,,no hangovers!"
"Tried not to be a beer snob, but... life is too short to drink this stuff"
"Pours a light clear straw piss yellow color with a thin bright white headskie. Tastes like beered down water. Some light sweet adjunct malts are in there, but it's really a weak weakness of flavor overall. But then again, this is a light beer. Not much to the mouthfeel and not so drinkable as it doesn't have many redeming values. Nonetheless, still better than most light american macros I've tried."
"Overall-this beer works, not a bad light beer in any regard. I think it's better than Coors Light, which I found ok so I would have no problem drinking this anytime. Not quite up to my favorite light lager Michelob Light but solid nonetheless. PLAY BEER!"
"Pours piss yellow. Smells like skunk, alcohol and wheat. Your basic macro. Tastes like wheat and alcohol, smoother than I expected. Better than Bud should be their slogan. I'd get this again."
"Taste seems to be a little crisper out of the keg...but again there really is nothing to this brew. Thankfully, it was smokey as hell in his place so I couldn't really taste anything anyhow. It was decent for the night and it goes down like water...just with a little added color and carbonation..."
"Not a great beer but definitely a beer that I can sit down and drink anytime. Best word to describe it is average. It never disappoints but you also never say damn that was a good beer. The appearance and smell are bland but it does go down easy. I usually keep a 6 pack on hand since most of my wife's friends can't handle my Hefe's or Wit's."
"I have fond memories of trying this in high school, proclaiming, ""I hate beer," and promptly swilling a liter or so of Jim Beam. Ah, how I've grown."
"had this one at a local bar for a nickel a pitcher. every wednesday night is nickel pitchers so i figured no harm in trying it out. Poured out a light colored yellow into the plastic cup they gave me. Head was pearly white but didnt stick around for long. lacing was little to nothing. aroma was non-existant. first sip tasted like beer flavored water. slight taste of corn husks and a slight sugar sweetness, Tasted like they added a lot of water to the tap on wednesday night. not a bad beer if youre paying 5 cents per pitcher. finish was wet and tasteless. enjoy"
"This is one of those beers that I believe the bros should create a new style style category for: piss beer. Joking aside, this beer is not as horrible as bud lite or coors lite. This is far from a compliment, however, as this beer is still one of the worst in the world. It has the light yellow appearance that I have come to excpect from BMC, and it just looks more like urine than beer. Carbonated urine. The smell is no different than any other light lager, either, smelling of corn and grain. The taste is surprisingly earth and grainy, or at least more so than bud light and coors light. This beer is not worth money when there are so many better options out there, but when faced with the choice between it and its competitors, vote miller lite."
"Now that I have slummed it a bit it's back to my Kapuziner."
"I can think of worse things to drink when out at a swill bar, it is what it is."
"had on tap at local swill joint with little else to offer(only beer on draft). appearence is a robust gold with heavy carbonation. very little head with no retention. very light lacing. smell was very little. slightly sweet/sour. taste was light, watery, and unimpressive. little or no hop character. slight corn flavor mixed with rusty iron. slightly bitter aftertaste. mouthfeel is light, bubbly seltzer-like. drinkability is better than average because of ability to drink a dozen without breaking a sweat. not all bad. a swill bar favorite."
"(12 oz. can)"
"Sweet, more flavorful than say Bud, but not a complex flavor. A little corny. Best when poured into a tall glass and drank like water."
"Had this at a friends 4th of July shindig after I ran out of the beer I brought.. I learned one important lesson that day.. When you bring good beer to a house that usually has shite beer they will drink your good stuff first!! Oh well. It pours a light yellow smells like nothing. The taste is boring and adjunct laden. The best thing that can be said for this beer is that it goes down easy after you have had several beers before it. It is drinkable because its not like drinking much. I wont buy it but if someone hands me one I am not snobby enough to turn it down"
"A standard pale, light adjunct lager, nothing offensive but dull as could be"
"At the first whiff after the cap comes off, the odor brings a common or everyday average brew to your mind. Upon the first sip, you can right off the bat tell its a light beer even if the label is ripped off or its on tap. The smell alone brings an average, not not be appealing to some. As the beer sits in your mouth you can defiantly feel the carbantion and the freshness. I give the drinkability something rare and perhaps good. May seem like an average beer to some, but good to me. I suggest to drink it down cold. You can tell this isn't supposed to be a specialty beer, but defiantly beats Bud Light in the taste test to my standerds."
"yeah, drink it cold from the bottle and its ok."
"As far as light beers go, this one is OK. With its light taste and body you could drink a ton of 'em, which I guess is Miller's point."
"Oh yeah, the answers to the questions posed above are: neither one, cherry, Veronica, ML baseball can kiss my fed up, disillusioned ass, and Wendy's."
"Not a bad beer, not a good beer, but not a bad beer. Best of the big three in taste and drinkablility. It's a good session brew for the price, and one hell of a good fall back beer. Not a brew for a fine lobster meal, but it gets the job done after a hot days work."
"Drinkability - I bought this 12-pack thinking someone in our sand volleyball league liked it, but I was wrong. IMO, it's not really a good summer beer if you plan to have it in play for more then ten minutes. It gets nasty as soon as it climbs into the upper 40's in temp. Perhaps it was the inspiration for beer funneling. Better as a winter party beer, a football game when it's nice and cold outside, ice fishing, intramural curling leagues, those kinds of things."
"Had this with pizza as Bud Lite was also served and I thought id see if there was any difference. It poured a clear straw-like yellow-gold with a fair one-inch white head. Carbonation is up so some fizz aids in taking the head to a very thin film, if at all. Lace is in small spots, to nothing. The aroma is grain, can-like, not sweet. The taste is also grain, semi sweet corn with a citric hop note that pretty faint. The mouthfeel is left with a dry metal feel, again perhaps the can. Drinkability was just ok. Nothing i'll turn down if offered and its priced reasonable. Not one i'd keep in my home stock. As for the Bud Lite, I thought Miller did a better job. The appearance is not as watery, the head show's up, and you get some citric taste backed by the corn, where-as AB tends to skunk it up abit. A true Pilsner beer, ha, ok perhaps."
"ng"
"Drinkabilty: This is may be the most drinkable macro out there, but you get what you pay for."
"It was fairly refreshing and would make a descent lawnmower beer. But why pick this for lawnmowing with so many more tasteful choices out there."
"On tasting, the only thing I could pick up at first was the deadening cold and the intense carbonation stinging my taste buds. When I recovered, I could start to sense some light malt. This too was ephemeral. Bitterness was minmal to mild. Body was light, but not completely watery. Not impressed overall, but I was pleasantly surprised with the hint of aroma and malt."
"Probaly the darkest color light beers amongst the macros, could literally not distinguish a molecule of arom. It seemed highly charged with carbonation. There actually was some substance to the taste, detected a corn malt sweetness and just a hint of hop aftertaste. Besides Sam Adams, its probaly the fullest and tastiest of the lights, but so what."
"The beer pours a pale gold color with a thick frothy white head that fades to lacing. The aroma is decent, for a light beer that is. It has a light malt scent with little or no hops. The is a small amount of lager yeast aroma. The taste is average. It has a watered down malt flavor with a bitter skunky finish. It refreshes on the way down, but this beer is for amatuers. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a low bodied beer with lots of carbonation. This beer is about average as far as these types of beers go. It one and done for me. I prefer Michelob light to this."
"In all, not much can be said about Miller Lite that hasn't already be stressed in detail by other, more concise reviews. But accept Miller Lite as it is. This beer will be around for decades, I guarantee it!"
"Drinkable, It is not GREAT but it beats everything I have tasted except Sam Adams Light."
"I wasn't impressed with this beer once again i put my faith in believing all the hype but turns out its just another light macro. Its too watered down in fact i had this beer for the first time before i hda an amste light and my amstel light almost tasted like the most flavrofilled beer in the world. Just a regular light beer, bland and simple to the taste."
"Miller Lite is probably the best of the Lite beers, but that is not saying much. The appearance is a straw yellow with a smell sorta fruity. The taste is not bad actually, tastes like apricot sort of. I could drink a lot of these on a hot sticky summer day, not bad as far as the cheap beers are concerned."
"This is my favorite BUDMILLERCOORS product. However, it is not a sipping beer. It is a beer that I don't mind drinking when someone offers it to me at their home. The beer is yellow and has not head. It is light in taste, with a light hop character that is detectable in the nose and the taste. It is light, refreshing, and drinkable."
"Not a good beer really by any means, but as far as the mass produced american lite beer goes, it isnt bad. Has some flavor underneath all the water. This isnt a beer I would drink often, but when you want to kickback and watch a game, and have something to drink without getting smashed, this is a good beer to drink. I sat and watched a game and just kept kicking them back like it was water (which it mostly is). But in the end, I would take this over the other lite beers."
"I guess out of the macro light lagers, this is one of the better ones. But that is not saying much at all! It poured the typical clear/straw color with a minimal head that quickly faded into nothing. The smell was of grain and a slight malt scent as well. The taste was grain then a nasty sweetness that tried to cover up the brews nastyness, but instead just added to it. I don't know why any sane person would drink this on a regular basis."
"Not drinkable but not a total drainpour."
"Umm, how do I really go about revieing thes ""brew""? Light straw pout. Not to much taste, but, has a very slight mix of rice/corn/hop presence to it. It's watery flavor give it drinkablity level a nice boost. This, by no means, is a brew of choice, but., give it to your non-BA buddies. They may, by some unfortnae chance, thank you for it"
"Best with a burger and fries."
"Cheers...there are worse beers out there."
"Scores remain the same as do my opinions....for a light beer it has a nice little hit of maltiness and some subtle hop flavors....IN RELATION to other light beers...one of the better light beers out there...considerably better than Bud Light"
"OK, it's a light beer, and that's the bottom line here. You can drink dozens, but my point is, why? To get drunk? I can't think of any reason why I would have another short of my brother pleading me to have one with him, and even then he'd have to sound as pathetic as he did last night. This is a solid no-go for me, though I suppose the drinkability will lead some to senseless abuse."
"This was a lot better than served on tap. It was a little warmer, I think. Still has a very weak flavor, that is dominated by a grain taste. Still very boring. Drinking it out of the bottle makes you miss the lack of a decent head. Gimme a full flavor beer instead of this stuff anytime."
"Probably the best light beer of the big 3, though that's not saying a lot. I had to trade a Prima Pils in order to get this review, so I definitely lost out. That aside, I have this review, so I don't have to have another ever again!"
"What is worse than Miller light from a bottle? How about Lite from a can! This is a clearish.yellowy liquid with a small spritzy head. The aromas are of stale grains and seltzer. The taste is more of the same. Nothing good going on at all! The mouthfeel is worse in the can than it is in the bottle, and in fact the taste is worse as well. Of course the drinkability is utter crap too!"
"Why, precisely, am I reviewing this? Piss yellow with a minimal head. Not much of an aroma. Taste is fairly grassy (with a little wheat?). A little malty sweetness. Virtually no aftertaste Extremely light bodied - might as well be drinking soda water. Probably one of the better light beers, but that's not saying much."
"This beer is nothing great, but it's not too bad either."
"Drinkability: I had this out of solidarity with my family, but only because the HopDevil and Yuengling hadn't been chilled yet."
"Drinkability - I know people like to shun these beers as ""crap"" because they think it has to be a $50 case of beer to show that they have such a sophisticated palate. Well, Poindexter, this beer is about as drinkable as it gets. Go to a game, a company outing, or your buddy's garage, and this beer will most likely be in attendance. It is an extremely drinkable beer. No, it won't impress anyone, but, yes, it is a halfway decent beer so deal with it."
"I feel eminently qualified to review this macro Miller Lite, having consumed mass quantities of same over the past twenty years. As my Canadian friends would say, this isn't really beer. It has no real taste or mentionable characteristics. I can assure you that you will get a pronounced buzz, after quaffing 10 or more. At least, it's not as watery as most of its American competitors, and is rarely skunky. Not much else to say about it."
"I feel a little ashamed that I didn't just hate this beer, but it wasn't offensive so it can't score too low. Plus I was a little surprised that it did have a nice gold color instead of the thin yellow stuff I was expecting and it had a head that didn't instantly fizz away. The flavor wasn't much, mostly an interesting applely flavor when really cold, then joined by a faint huskiness a little later on."
"Oh man, this isn't even good for a light beer. The extra sweetness fails miserably when it attempts ot cover up the chemical aftertaste. Think I'll avoid this one in the future."
"- Backdated tasting: I first reviewed this beer on 30AUG03, this post is based on notes from that review. -"
"Ahhh: One of America's most popular beers. Donated by a ""friend", otherwise I wouldn't have had it. The beer is an extremely pale yellow color. Minimal aroma. Minimal taste. At least it is a watered down version of Miller's signature taste. Another example of what a big advertising budget can reap in sales that taste cannot."
"It's hard to say what color is this beer because the only proper way to drink is straight from the bottle, of course. Well, its that great pale yellow color of light beers, with a thin sudsy head that kind of weirds me out. Smells like grainy and hunky scents with some weird excuse for hops aroma coming out. Taste of grainy pale malt and sweetness, barely lemony hops that are almost flavorless, and a strange finish not worth my time to figure out. Thin as hell mouthfeel with that eerie macro-beer fizziness to it. The sweetness is strong and nice, saving this beer and, for me, making it drinkable when the case is fresh and you're just chilling with the homies watching a game. I actually don't mind it."
"Aroma? None. Flavor? Can't call it _bad,_ cause there is no flavor at all. I have to give it points for looking like a beer. Was served this by someone who still thinks beer tastes best in a glass that's been in the freezer. Tried to get him interested in a Yuengling I'd brought, but no dice. (Oh, well, more for me!)"
"Yuck.."
"Pale, pale yellow, clear as a bell with nothing but a ten second head and no lacing qualities. Aroma is almost non-existant. This is a truly weakly malty beer, vague confectioner's sugar powderiness but not even a sense of light colored corn syrup. Carbonation is adequate but appears too strongly near the close. Obviously poor mouthfeel, the finish is strange -- a mixture of clove, phenolics, and a gassy assertion of raw bran up the back of the nasal passages. Not a macro I'd choose before others."
"Good God this beer is just plain bogus. True Pilsner? Truly horrific. There are a bunch of commercials on tv right now claiming that this has half the carbs, calories, etc as bud light, and coors light. Man it has half the flavor too, and theres not much to work with there. Basically water, not even good for getting wasted."
"I didn't really enjoy this beer at all. It was watery like most other lite beers i have had. Definitely nothing much to this beer. If i am going to have a light beer from any of the macros i would pass this up and go to a bud light, however I would pass that up and go for a Sam Adams light."
"I cant wait to try Michelob ultra!"
"Miller Lite, like Michelob Lite and the hundreds of other nameless, faceless light beers, accomplishes what it sets out to do -- appeal to the masses, and provide ample refreshment. A good thirst quencher, but I wouldn't drink it as a habit."
"This beer is probably my favourite American beer, even though I'm not a big fan of the ""yellow stuff"". I once heard a friend of mine from the United Kingdom say that American beer is for children, and I think that pretty much sums it right up. Anyway, Miller Lite is easily the least awful American beer. It is still quite literally urine yellow and has the typical yeasty, bread smell of all other American beer. The taste, however, at least in my opinion, is pretty good for what it is. A decent, light-weight mouthfeel with a watery finish with alot of carbonation (almost like Sprite in the carbonation dept.). For a near thirst quenching beer on a hot summer day after labouring outdoors, you can't beat Miller Lite: Inexpensive, clean and crisp, little or no after taste, and just a damn good beer to be an American mainsteam beer."
"Well, I probably shouldn't review this because it's so boring. But I will. Pours yellow and boring with very little white head that dies out quickly. Smells kinda skunky. Tastes kinda skunky - but that's all you pay for because it is a fairly cheap beer that is mass produced. This is one of the few that it doesn't matter if you have it out of the can or off the tap, it still tastes the same (a little skunky and cheap)."
"Bowling alley beer defined."
"This is definitely better than many other light beers. However that does not make it good. This one actually has a head to it when I did pour it in a glass. But if I drink macros it's usually straight from the container, I don't want to put the effort in. So this had a little metalic taste to it. Very generic beer taste to it, but atleast it's not as watery as other macro lights. Not the worst beer I've ever had."
"The taste, terribly soft, has just a bit of bitterness mixed with a bit of sweetness from the maltyness. No carbonation, like chugging down bad water. terribly light body. This is a tasteless waste of time."
"Notes: There is no reason to drink this. If your goal is to just get buzzed -- and not put on weight -- just smoke marijuana."
"Overall, this reaffirmed the reason why I avoid lite beer in general and mass-marketed stuff from Miller and AB in particular. Next time I'll just politely refuse....."
"skip it."
"Taste is bland, but perhaps a bit better than Corrs Light or Bud Light. Some sweetness and lots of carbonation to hide the flaws. Thin mouthfeel. You could pound a lot, but why??"
"The after its release from the 12-ounce brown bottle sets in the glass an unbemused gold color with a smallish frothy bright white head and after its erosion, the lace forms a thin but concealing sheet upon the glass. Nose is malt, sweet and fresh with the start lightly sweet, fair malt presence and the top cadaverous in feel. Finish is brisk in carbonation, the hops meek and the aftertaste dry."
"Brilliant white head on top of a very pale, overly carbonated body. Head comprised of coarse bubbles underneath a medium-fine cap. After a few moments, all that is left was a heterogeneous surface layer. Nose was something like sweet plastic with something reminiscent of herbaceous hops. Very crisp in the mouth once the overzealous carbonation tires a bit. Sweetness was very light and quickly washed away by Rice Crispy graininess. The breakfast cereal carried long into the finish. Yum! A mineral astringency is also mixed in from hard water or carbonic acid or some sperm count reducing chemical they add for one reason or another."
"Never again...never again."
"Miller Lite is pretty decent, but can be very inconsistent. It really yet again depends on the mood. Usually after the 3rd or 4th Coors Light and Miller Lite tastes pretty good. One of the better light beers available today, but still cannot top the Silver Bullet."
"This is the first cheap beer I've reviewed and definitely one of the better American macro-swills out there. It's not just alcoholic Perrier like many of it's peers. Instead, Miller Lite actually has a little flavor to it. I've always thought it was best out of the can. How the aluminum actually enhances the flavor is beyond me, but I'll just go with it."
"The prototypical light lager beer, this is one that stand outs from the crowd since it makes an effort to keep the flavor while losing the calories. Lightly carbonated clear yellow with a white head and a little lacing effect. Hops are noted in the flavor to balance the grain maltiness. Somewhat watery and thin mouthfeel is improved by not being too fizzy. Not a bad light beer and one is OK in a pinch."
"Miller Lite's clever and comical TV ads belie the fact that this is one very weak beer. Pale straw in color and flavor. Not too much aroma. Seltzer like effervescence. Heres my recipe for beer success: Over-boil some rice, let it sit in the water a couple days, remove the rice, add an Alka Seltzer, drop in a penny (for flavoring...and color), wave a hop pellet over the concoction and ferment for two whole days...top it off with a witty advertising campaignSuccess!"
"Taste = sweet but thin, it's not filling. Tastes better than the competition. Daming it with faint praise, I know. I drink it when I'm on a diet, remembering that soon I'll lose enough lard to enjoy real beer again."
"I like this stuff. It's for those of us who drink in larger quantities, and don't want it to show on our stomachs. It's just as the others have put it, not much on color, taste or head, but the high carbonation is where it's at for me. Either way you cut it, there are worse beers out there, and there are certainly better ones too."
"Family gathering at the in-laws--oh well, looks like Miller Lite. Pours a light clear golden color, head is fairly thick with a pourposeful pour. Fades fast to almost nil with no lace. Domestic beer smell-nothing special, slightly metalic odor. Weak overall taste. Watered down, no discernable malts or hop character. It went down easily though, which is more than I can say for Bud Light. Thin mouthfeel, average carbonation."
"This is just like Bud light, but tastes like popcorn. Me and my bros call it popcorn beer. Basically, it's a staple at any frat party here in the crotch of Va. Anyways, apperance is like water with yellow food coloring. There is no real distinguishing taste from this beer. The smell is pretty bad too. Kinda smells like sour milk, but not as bad. There is a mouthfeel though... of water! Drinkability is not grand either. But I did learn something about the ""brew"". It goes well with any cheap whiskey."
"I had to buy a case of this for a recent holiday party for friends...I figured at the very least I'd get a review out of it and make my macroswiller friends happy. It poured a very pale, gold color with an extremely thin, almost nonexistent head. It had considerable carbonation, and looked like clean, yellow-tinted sparkling water. A somewhat malty, faintly beer-like aroma was present. The beer was extremely watered down, and I could only detect faint vapor trails of pilsner ghosts that may once have haunted this beer, but have only left a paltry skeleton. The taste wasn't necessarily bad, just virtually nonexistent. Carbonated water feels OK in my mouth, so I can't say that the mouthfeel was repugnant here. Miller Lite is one of the more palatable light beers on the big market today for session drinking. It's my choice when the selection is limited to such marcolights, but it barely falls into the ""beer"" category for me. I guess it's better than the Silver Bullet."
"put some in the fridge for my father and brother for christmas. unfortunately, they didn't drink them all. i figured i'd have a couple to get them out of there faster. now i remember why i haven't had one in a long, long time. typical light, american macro-brew. bland watery flavor (if you can call it that). way too carbonated. reminds me of the swill i used to chug before concerts in high school."
"Just an average light beer at best, but then, any light beer at any given time can only hope to rise to the status of average in my beer world. Colour is a pale golden hue, limited head which disapates to nothing.....body is weak as is the taste"
"The taste, what little of it there is, is not good. This beer leaves a ""bottled"" taste in one's mouth. There is nothing special about the aroma. The color is a light amber. The mouthfeel is nothing to write home about, and since it tastes bad, the drinkability is not very good, but if you get it cold enough and are only looking to quench your thirst, it does the job. Not much good to say about this beer."
"The Ichabod head of beers in that it has no head!!! haha, I made a funny. Smell is repulsive to even me (I worked at a human waste plant, aka poop plant this summer too). Mouthfeel is that hard carbonated water. Taste is very weak and grainy. No taste of hops or malts for that matter; its just grainy water. Drinkability isnt an issue if you can deal with a bored palate."
"In my opinion, Miller makes one of the better national macro brews.  Medium/Light straw in color with lazy bubbles, rich foam and clingly lace. Aroma has traces of sweet malt, but is predominated by cooked veggie husk.  Spritzy on the tounge with a sweetness nicely balanced between malt and veggie adjunct.  If there could be a good use of adjuncts, this would be it.  Extremetly slight bitter character, though not so much from the hops.  Finishes light with a cornfed sweetness."
"On a side note, the best Miller Lite I ever tasted was poured the end of the Miller Brewing tour.  The freshness and crispness of the product were unbelievable.  It actually tasted good!  Too bad it can't retain those qualities when distributed to the masses."
"Like I said, it's better than AB's light offerings and it is tastier than most light beers, but this is no substitute for a ""full"" beer."
"Why bother, seriously. At least it tasted slightly smoother than Amstel Light. If you are drinking this you really don't like beer, it's that simple. I'd tell you to go drink a seltzer water instead but that is probably more expensive."
"By the end of the night I had a total of two beers.  Oh well."
"Its time to review one of the lesser lights of the beer world - please forgive this atrocious pun.  Medium gold color with a decent snow-white head that fades to a paper-thin layer in moments.  Well carbonated, the bubbles are entertaining to watch, modest lace.  Somewhat sweet grainy aroma with some mild hops.  Taste is slightly sweet to start, with grain notes and a sting of carbonation, hops then come into play with a slight bitterness and lemon flavors toward the end of the taste.  Finish is dry and crisp.  Not a terrible beer, just not that good.  This beer is popular with non-beer connoseur friends, however - so its advisable to have a few in the refrigerator for them."
"Pours a fairly deep gold compared to most light beers. White head vanishes. The aroma is limited and gives an odd malt note - maybe there are some hops twisted in here. Not offensive, but not really inviting. Of course, the Lite beer drinker isn't looking for aroma. The body is thin - basically a requirement to obtain a lower caloric count through complete fermentation. Always a problematic beer for bartenders because there's no body to hold the carbonation in, thus quite a bit of foaming. The carbonation doesn't help to give any mouthfeel, leaving it ""watery"" (no joking). The flavor is extremely light with just a swirl of malt and no hop. There's no real finish, just a light coating in the mouth. I'm not sure about ""tastes great", but it's definitely ""less filling"". Very drinkable because each mouthfull leaves you empty. There are no flaws to it. A POUNDABLE beer if that's what you're interested in. Also probably very refreshing when lost at sea."
"The dummies in the next building over were making steaks and offered me one of these to go with it. It's not as bad as I had convinced myself it was. Clear yellow color, fluffy white head, lots of bubbles. Smell was really bitter and metallic. Taste was mostly bitter, some beerness to it, but had a really thin watery finish, and a sour aftertaste. Light, thin, and easy to drink. The first 2-3 ounces, when cold are pleasant and tolerable. I see why people drink these fast, the longer it sits after 5 minutes, the harsher it gets."
"I knew the day would come, so I might as well start getting the macros out of the way.  Of the 2 or 3 beers that I will not drink, this is one of them.  I was fully prepared to leave, when friends forced me to stay and offered me one of these.  The forced air carbonation gave a large fluffy head and the smell was bitter, but not quite a hops type bitterness.  The color was a very light golden and the taste was non-existent."
"Side Note: Undrinkable out of the can"
"Of the megabrewers, this has to be the light beer that makes the worst impression on me.  Granted all aren't a good color or smell, but the taste of this one is just rather odd."
"Well.  This is a vapid, barely concealed mockery of beerdom.  It's nothing.  I couldn't take the ratings even down to 1 because it lacks enough personality to be awful.  Barely any aroma, only the slightest hint of color and the taste is so watered down so as to make the carbonation dominate any possible flavor."
"Another ""beer"" I had at a good friend's bday party. Fortunately, I had some good stuff in reserve that I had to break out. I am sure I converted some people after the horrible duo of this and Coors Light. Rating 1.0"
"When I am out with friends on the weekends and I am thirsty but I don't want a beer, this is what I drink sometimes. It is good for what it is: a grain flavored, weak-alcoholic soda pop. It is not a pilsner, or any beer for that matter.  If you enjoy Miller Lite, I'm with you on that--no offense intended!  But, let's be honest..."
"Light beers...basically all the same. This one however, is not too bad on tap. I get it every now and then because it is easy to drink quite a few of them, and the 23 ounce pilsner is really really cheap at the bar."
"Absolutely no body, very little taste, but most important, those grainy aftertastes you see with every other macro are subdued to the point where I didn't even notice them.  The best light beer of the big three!"
"12 Oz bottle.  Very pale yellow color.  Extreamly carbonated but, bubbles are large(sign of forced carbonation to the max).  No smell to write about.  Slight malt flavor, no bitterness at all.. lacks any sign of hops.  Slight skunk taste finish."
"A very watery beer.  This is the beer that started the light beer craze back in the 70s and well, things haven't been quite the same since have they?  My father drinks this and only this.  It doesn't have alot of taste, and of course, its watery, but its not horrible.  On a hot day, it will quench your thirst.  If you are going for flavor then this isn't what you want to drink."
"darker than most bright lagers, but does that count for anything?  a swill beer that can be drank endlessly without fear of getting sick.  i hate that adjunct taste and smell and it's so fizzy and metallic! ugh!  a true pilsener?  WHAT???  ok that all said...when you're stuck in the desert and you have to choose between this and coors light....you pick this."
"Again, no idea of the color as I never saw it on the way from the can to my piehole. Definitely more ""beerlike"" than tha Bullet, with less of an off-grainy taste - I'll agree with a previous reviewer about a nuttiness to the flavor.  May have briefly detected a hop in there somewhere as well. Not a bad pull if you're at a party with a big ol' cooler full of mixed cans of heavily advertised beer."
"As far as mass produced american lagers go this one is probably a little better than the others.  It is almost transparent, smells of nothing, tastes of nothing with a slight hop taste that last for about 1 second (this is it's edge), the mouthfeel is ok but the beer is too carbonated to be very drinkable.  Good to get a keg of for all your friends who don't like beer when you have a party."
"Watered down look and watered down skunk taste.  OK, here we go...I wasn't going to do this, but I can't help it.  This is what Miller's R&D team manager said at the last meeting before they produced Miller Lite.  ""Let's get some bad tasting water and really screw it up, put it in a can, market the mess out of it (because we know this works...see Coors Light), and we'll sell it and tell people they like it, then by the time they figure out this isn't really beer at all, we'll all be rich!""  Enough said."
"This the usual light brewski, same as the rest ... one of the better light beers out there for sure if you are a stickiler to styles. Light bodied, thin lace and minimal head retention. Lots of corn in the aroma and flavor, finishes pretty damn dry. More or less a sad excuse for beer."
"Not sure which is worse - synthetic hops or rough, grainy malt."
"Mmm.. slumming..."
"This is something you'd decline even if it was free"
"Notes: As far as lite beers go, it's not horrible, but it is still a lite beer ... why bother drinking this on a normal basis?"
