"Disgustingly horrible by far the worst beer I have ever had the displeasure of trying"

"Ok beer, not a big fan of diet beer"
""
""
"Super easy to drink a lot of."
"Tad bit better than bud light that's about it."
""
""
"Not bad not good. Serves the purpose on a hot day as good as any other domestic light"
""
"Pours a nice golden color with a thick head that thins to less than a lace. Smells gross like every other adjunct lager. Has a surprising nice taste for this type of beer. Goes down pretty smooth, a little dry. Overall, not too bad, but not good enoug to buy again."
"Wouldn't drink this again even if it was free"

"Pours a golden yellow in color with a very thin white head that settles to just along the sides of the glass. Very little lacing is seen, spotty at best. Lots of carbonation. The aroma isn't much of anything really, just some grass and sweet corn. The taste is well...horrible! Talk about a 'watered-down' brew taste, this would be it. Actually the taste is very light of grain with a slight sweet corn finish that is a tad on the dry side."

"O - just not worth brewing or drinking 99 calories of watery brew. I get that this is something people go for, but it's not for me."

"I started drinking this beer when I was on a low carb diet. It fit the bill for me to a T. Smooth, easy, maybe a little too easy to drink with a taste that isn't offensive, it is the perfect diet beer. Miler Lite to me is bitter , with a tang and offensive, Coors is like water as is Bud 55, at least this beer has some taste and will give me a buzz. A lot of the other premium light beers aren't light at all. Select gives you the right balance between calorie/carbs and taste."

"O: No real flavor or smell like most light lagers. Surprisingly not offensive at least and 99 calories is decent for slumming it with crap beer."
"O - Overall, Just another Bud product that's lacking any good flavor. Not offensive, But not good."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, overly carbonated, and lacking in any complexity - surprise!"

"This is a typical adjunct light lager. It's crisp, lightly flavored (ultimately unoffensive), and goes down easily and quickly. Status quo for adjunct light lagers."

"Overall, not a great beer, but not bad for what it's trying to be. For lower calories and less offensive taste, this is where I go. Not quite as good as Mich Ultra for low calories, but solid. Still, not a craft beer, and not one that I drink unless I'm drinking a lot of 'em."
""
""
"Overall - There's nothing special to say about this beer. It's definitely drinkable, but it's just your common light lager. I'd like it better if the carbonation was a little lower."

""

"Over All: Cold and refreshing. Not a beer that I would want to drink everytime I felt like a beer but it would be perfect after cutting the grass on a hot day."

"Meh. Meh meh meh. Meh? Meh. Meeeh... meh. Mehmehmehmehmehmehmehmehmehmehmeh. Meeehhh. Meh, meh meh meh meh. MEH! Meh? Meh. Actually scratch that never mind this beer sucks pretty hard. No meh about it. Can looks cool though, especially when you shake it up and shoot it with a pellet gun."

"Pours a pale yellow with a lot of carbonation and a white fizzy head that leaves no lacing. Smell of corn and faint hops. Tastes the same and typical macrobrew funk. Very thin bodied like water. I actually prefer budlight to this, but that's not saying much."

"Pours a pale straw with a starch white half finger of fizzy boring looking head. Really have to snort at this one to gather much of anything. Corn and sweet subtle grains. Wet grass. Slight metallic zing in front with a corny bread flavor as it fades. Mouthfeel is akin to urine. Overall, youâ€™re better off drinking soda."

"Straw colored and clear with a very thin head and no lacing. Aroma is very light and mostly light malt and some bready biscuity notes. Flavor is not very offensive but not good either. Mostly light malt and breads. No bad aftertaste or bitterness which is nice from this genre. Refreshing, light body and high carbonation. Better than budweiser but still a Budweiser."

"Beer pours light straw golden with a wispy head. Aroma from this beer is difficult to pick up, but I detect adjunct. Sweet, like corn syrup in the flavor. I wasn't able to detect any presence of hops. I don't know what else to say...Little flavor, and what is there is not enjoyable."

"Overall, perhaps in not giving this beer a fair shake based on how cold it was and my predisposition towards macros but still, it's bland, thin and not tasty. Though I might have a worse opinion if it was served at room temp, I'll take a Boston lager over this every minute of everyday over this...."
"Bud Select is much better than regular Bud....at least to me. But common...lets face it....there is not much a brewery can do to mix up an american style adjunct lager. Its pretty basic....appearance is yellow/gold...with decent carbonation and head to start and then if fades quickly. Smell and taste contain grain/barley and some hops. Mouthfeel is fine...its not gross tasting...but its not noteworthy. Overall its drinkable in a pinch. I wounder if roles were reversed...meaning IPAs were as marco as adjunct and the general population trying the adjunct for a first time if reactions to this style would be different."
"It's better than Bud Light and Miller Light. But I think I'd still rather have a Bud."
"O: Less awful than many of the other Budweiser variants. Still wouldn't have this again."
"It's easy-drinking, and full of aroma and flavor for a light beer."
"Poured this can into a plastic cup. It poured a plae straw color and it has very nice clarity. It produced a pathetic white head with horrible head retention. Little to no lacing. Aroma....what aroma? I think i might have smelled a grain....yes A grain. The taste of this light lager is almost no existent....if there is a taste of malt or grain or hops,,, it is barely existent. What is this crap?"
"RJT"
"D: Yea this sure is... not worth my time."
"O - This beer is highly drinkable, but that is mostly due to the lack of flavor and water-like consistency. Overall, it's not an offensive beer, it just has no flavor, except corn and some grain. I don't recommend this, it's definitely not worth the money."
"O - it kinda sucks."
"not good but not offensive either."
"I really wasn't able to come up with anything special about this beer. To me in still just Budweiser in a different bottle. So with that being said this beer is yellow in color, malts and corn aromas on the nose, the head fades quickly. The mouthfeel is pretty light. The best thing about this beer is the design on the label. That's about it."
"For a light beer, its ok. Not much flavor or body. Nothing special."
"Easy to put down, but for what reason? This beer is really bad, worse than anything else I've had from Budweiser. It has nothing to offer other than reduced calories in a beer that tastes like a bud-light gone wrong."
"Drinkability- Very easy to drink. Had two more after this first one and didn't think twice about pounding them. Will be drinking again for sure."
"Overall; Wow I really need to keep craft brew in the house at all time she can not bring this in anymore"
"This used to be one of my go to beers. It is refeshing after working on a hot day or mowing the yard. It has to be one that you go to when it is your first that day or when your only other option is a bmc light version. It has a flavor that reminds me of my fathers beer choice but doesn't get worse until the third one. Over all there are thousands more that are better, but if your looking for an economical and lower calorie choice then this is the best that is out there of the light beer choices. I don't keep it in my fridge since my palate ahas developed."
"Suckers are born every minute,,"
"taste better the more you drink or really i should say its easier to stomach"
"D- Easy to drink like water. Boring and bland."
"I had this the other day while drinking with my non craft buddy. His little 2 year actually was his beer bitch running to get these all day so it made me reconsider kids for a split second. Anyway, drank directly from the can, going old school...The aroma actually isn't that bad, its lightly skunky but more sweet corn and some hops come through...The taste was better than expected as well, slightly skunky but really just light sweetness with hops. I crushed one of these and would drink a few of these if I had too, not bad."
"Poured a glass resulting in a two finger head of pure white foam that faded to a small ring around the glass in seconds. Lace is broken, but does cling. Color is a 2 on the SRM beer color chart. Smells like wet corn, and malt. Taste is bland flavors of wheat, corn, and malt, with maybe a hint of hops. Water has about the same mouthfeel as this beer. Just doesn't do anything for me. Lack luster flavor and feel. I guess it's only grace is it is plentiful and cheap."
"This is another beer to mow and play golf with. It is good for that at least. I usually have this in cans when i do have it and it tastes fine smells ok drinks well, and is cheap and easy to find. It is like the rest of these mass produced beers. I would drink it again."
"D=Very thin feeling, even for a light lager, might as well drink water, though me not being a jerk I won't complain or turn it down if a friend offers me one"
"Summary: This is a bad beer. I gave it a 6.0/10, or a D-. The word ""Select"" in the title enticed me to try it, but after reading ""99 calories"" underneath that, I knew this wasn't going to be an exceptional beer. For a premium beer, this beer really has no taste, and is as consistent as water. It comes off as a slightly better version of Bud Light. The only saving grace is the 99 calories...but I would rather just run on a treadmill for 30 minutes and drink a good beer. I would only drink this beer again if there was nothing better available."
"Overall: Find a better light lager."
"D- This is a drinkable beer but would I want a sixer of this? Nope. The ABV is low enough that a sixer plus is very doable. I would pick this out of my choice of mainstream light lagers though for what it is worth."
"Pours a sickly looking pale straw yellow with a thin white soapy head and no lacing. Smells of grain and corn maybe a little yeast. Tastes of bitterness and sweetness although nothing is really prominent enough to pick out other than some corn or rice. High carbonation. Thin mouthfeel. Low drinkability. Quite nasty."
"AWFUL. This 'beer' just smells from moldly boiled rice and has no scent of alcohol. Pale yellowish color, no head no lacing, and almost clear. Makes me wonder why I am drinking this. The flavor is mostly like a bitter moldy rice soda. The beer if flat... AVOID!!!"
"Pours as if someone put two drops of yellow food coloring inside of a glass of water. Pours with a bit of white head, but that quickly recedes into nothing and leaves zero lacing. Smells like a stale loaf of bread in between slices of cardboard. Tastes about the same, although thankfully tames it down a bit. Feel and drinkability is about the same as carbonated water."
"Drinkability - it would be easy enough to drink something like this like water due to the almost complete lack of smell, taste, and aftertaste. As far as wanting to drink it, it's fairly boring."
"Found this for fifty cents at a local bait shop/general store during Man's Weekend. A pour results in a clear jaundice topped by over a finger of short-lived white suds. The nose comprises corn, corn syrup, and hard water. The taste is nearly identical, though the calcium from the hard water is intensified a bit and some aluminum foil is added for ""good measure"". The body is rather light, with a heavy moderate carbonation and a relatively easy-going feel. Overall, not the worst thing I've put in my mouth, but not something I'd generally go after at a bar or something without a harsh lack of choice about it."
"Light bodied, pale appearance. Probably not bad if you're at an outside event in the broiling sun."
"Nothing proffered, nothing rejected. The absence of anything to critique makes this one unfair fight. Drink it if you just don't care, and you won't know any better..."
"drinkability: if you can drink sparkling water, you can drink this. its not offensive in any way, just very bland with little to no flavor."
"Fizzy feel to it. Taste is watered down Bud. Grainy and musty. Not sure why anyone would drink this. If you want low calories, hit the ice water."
"Ok, this is one of the better AB brews and it still isn't very good, although it is better than regular Budweiser. I would not recommend to anyone to spend their hard earned money on one of these, but if youre at a party and all they have is this stuff and its free, go for it, other than that, keep on moving, spend your $6 on lottery tickets or charity."
"This beer has a little more heaviness than regular Bud, which is a slight plus. However, it's still a very bland, faintly corn-flavored beer. If not poured right you'll get a ton of head from all of the carbonation. It's pretty much as pale of an amber as you can get without being yellow. Smells of corn, as well as tastes like it. While better than their light beers, it's still nothing great."
"D- Like all BMC this beer is made with drinkability in mind. That being said, there are other AB products I prefer if you are sticking to this brand."
"Appears, smells, and has the same mouthfeel as every other American light beer I've tried before. It's body however is a little fuller than the rest so I would place this one a bit higher if we were comparing apples to apples. For those nights I feel like re-living the fantasy days of college and taking down a two-four, then this the one for me."
"It's a good choice for beer pong I've discovered. More beer with fewer calories, but I will never order one of these at a bar, or pop one open to enjoy on my veranda."
"D - To be honest, it reminds me of a retired A-B offering: Bud Dry. In fact, all that comes to mind, relative to this beer, is: ""Why ask why? Try Bud Dry."""
"Drinkability: Overall, it seems like carbonated water that has gone bad. On the plus side, I guess it is drinkable."
"Budweiser Select is a Light Beer brewed by Anheuser Busch.  This brew  has an ABV of 4.1 %.  Budweiser Select is lighter than Bud Light.  This brew pours out a nice light amber color with a nice white head.  These smell is sweet with some grains and malts.  The taste is bold but smooth.  You pick up on the grains and malts in this brew.  Budweiser Select has  a good taste for a light beer. This beer dose go down nice real nice. The mouthfeel is light smooth and refreshing.  I would have a Budweiser Select over Bud Light any Day. Good light beer. Anheuser-Busch did a nice job with this one.  Overall I'm giving this brew a 4.5 out of 5."
"In the end, it's a rather bland beer that smells bad, but makes up for it slightly with good drinkability and a nice low calorie count."
"Poured from 12 oz can into mug. Color is slightly darker than the average light beer, and the head slowly dissipates, leaving no lacing. Slight smell of flowers, but nothing else either bad or good there. Initial taste is of metal and carbonation; slightly skunky as well. After the first few sips, taste become that of the smell: not a whole lot either bad or good. Overall, decent for what it is; it's rather inoffensive in most categories, but I wouldn't go out of my way to have another."
"Pale straw color with a thin white head. Not impressive. Smells like some grain and mostly water. Taste the same. Why is this even produced? Mouthfeel is as thin as anything I have had before. Over carbonated. Some metallic aftertaste...from a bottle? Yuck."
"Well, as some people on here have said, I hate Bud Light. I think it has a sharp, unpleasant taste that continues to astonish me as to how people drink it so often. Budweiser is decent but far from the top. That being said, Bud Select is a pretty decent brew that I have no trouble drinking. Of course, 2.25 for a 25 oz mug here at a bar in Plantation, FL (Landlubber's Raw Bar for all you Broward folks who may read this) helps , but regardless it is something I'm having an easier time tolerating than I was expecting. The foamy head is actually pretty impressive, although it's a 25 ouncer not a pint but still. The taste is a tolerable mix of corn, hops and carbonation but not an overpowering sharpness that I get from Bud Light. It seems to me that Bud Select is very unappreciated among the beer buyers because although this isn't top of the line, it certainly beats out BL and honestly I'd rather have this than Budweiser also."
"Pours a light yellow color, nice carbonation, small white head, with some sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, with some hops, slight caramel. The taste is slightly sweet, malty, slight hop note. Light body. Not drinkable, would not buy again."
"Born on date : Jan 5, 2010; Review date : Feb 17, 2010."
"My pour resulted in two fingers' worth of foamy, bone-white head exploding with CO2 bubbles that fell like a souffle when the door is banged closed. It did leave some nice lacing as a parting gift, though. Color was a golden-yellow with NE-plus clarity (it gave me X-ray vision, allowing me to see through walls). Nose was an unholy combo of metallic, cereal, and a light lager-ish sweetness as a reminder of what could have been. Mouthfeel was thin-to-medium with a bland, watery taste in the mouth. ""Full flavor"" read the CAN and yet I found myself wondering, ""Full of what?"" Finish was equally bland and boring. It is not that this tasted bad or foul, it just did not taste at all. Oof."
"Completly lacking in flavor for any style. This beer is very light and only has a slightly bitter taste, only a small metallic taste. Why would anyone drink this?"
"Always good to warn a fellow beer drinker when you happen to sip someone else's crappy beer. Tastes mostly like water with a little bit of corn, but more than the corn is a metallic blood flavor. If you were to play some beer pong, I guess this wouldn't be a horrible choice."
"I was not impressed by the color or texture of the beer but it is not all about appearance. It has a good smell but quite weak. It has a really similar taste to bud light cant tell much difference in the two. It has a light mouthfeel that is not over powering with carbonation and its drinkability is rather nice it goes down quite well and is rather refreshing. From a light beers point of view it is defintley a decent beer. I still prefer bud light!!"
"Taste is a bit richer than bud heavy with a decent malt backbone for an adjunct lager. Very little hoppiness it's not great but pretty easy to drink when cold."
"I cannot stand Bud Light. in fact, most ""lite"" beers are kinda bad. Having said that, I find this beer to be quite nice. It actually has pretty decent flavor . This should be the light beer choice of Bud drinkers everywhere, not it's super selling sister Bud Light."
"For some reason, that I can't explain, I actually like Bud Select. I like it much more than Bud Light. I find Bud Select to have a better taste and flavor than Bud Light. It's not a great beer, but it is one that I will drink on occasion. And it's low calorie, so it must be healthy for you, right?"
"Overall not a bad beer, goes well with pizza or any other kind of food. A good everyday drinker. Sometimes less is more."
"D - Bad. For folks that are into Bud Light and other popular Macro-lagers I must say that the taste isn't far off, so I suppose it's a good ""low-cal"" option for them. For me? I won't drink it again."
"Poured into my pilsner glass. Pours a crystal clear pale yellow with a huge billowy white head on top. Decent retention; left some sticky lace in its wake. Scents of corn, grains, and crackers. The body is extremely thin and wet. No crisp bite at all, even though I can see plenty of carbonation in this beer. Flavors of buttered corn and white bread. Very weak. Drinkability is high as it's like drinking corn flavored-water, but who'd want to? If you're gonna get a macro, there's better than this out there."
"Not a great beer, but something to make us college kids feel like they're drinking something classic. Not something I'll buy, and this one was given to me by a friend."
"Crisp taste and good drinkability for a light lager keep this beer from being a total flop. I definitely would not recommend this beer to anyone in search of a decent beer."
"Not as grainy as its predecessors, which is probably a good thing. Not as metallic either. But this is still an unacceptable brew for a American beer. Expensive for the category."
"D: A bad beer + 99 calories = lousy beer."
"Pours a light straw color with little head that disappears almost instantly. There's really not too much going on with this one: and that's why I think it's not an awful beer. Rice and grain come through. That's all. I don't mind drinking these during the game...they're incredibly light and boring. Drinkability is really what this is all about. I suppose that's the difference."
"Never realized this qualified as a light lager until I saw it here, but it looks the part - light straw reminiscent if a Miller Lite or the ilk. About an 3/4 inch of head in a pint glass quickly foams down to just a bit of residue on top. Smell reminds me a bit of a Mexican macro lager as opposed to an American one - i.e. it smells like fermented grain instead of just... grain. Taste is weak even for an American light beer. It does have a bit of maltiness in the aftertaste, but it fades quickly. The initial taste (and lingering aftertaste) is only slightly different from seltzer water. It is, of course, highly drinkable, but doesn't score perfect marks even in that category - it's problematic when I have to keep looking back to remember what I'm drinking. You like Bud? Get a Bud Light and save some money. You like beer? Look elsewhere."
"What is this supposed to be? The website says it uses Bavarian Hops...really? That's interesting, because it would appear they are nowhere to be found. ""Full Flavor""..yeah it sure is full of diacetal twang. Although, you sure can pound em. Hence the drinkability score. (although you want to stop hurting your liver for the flavor equivalence of water.)"
"Overall - I try to cut the BMC stuff some slack (it serves it's purpose), but this is just bad. There are plenty of other, better marco lagers if that's what you're after."
"D: Not very flavorful but it goes down easily and is not too filling since there isn't much to it, mild kick, decent representation of a lackluster style, overall it's just another fizzy yellow beer, but it's at least better than AB's other light beer."
"Note: To me this is a Bud Light mixed with regular Bud. But hey Full flavor only 99 calories!"
"Poured from a 24 oz. can. Has a pale yellow color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is mild, some maltiness. Taste is, uh, missing for the most part. Crisp and flavorless. Feels light in the mouth. Drinkability is good, great for drinking games. Overall this is a fairly unimpressive beer."
"So after this whole ordeal, what have I learned you ask? I have learned that relatives of the people that own these giant breweries are just as ignorant as the people they advertise to. That is all."
"The drinkability is poor, there is not much flavor and doesn't satisfy a beer craving at all. Weak..."
"From the 24 fl. oz. can marked 27 JUN09-WB07. Sampled on August 3, 2009. The pour is an ultra carbonated pale yellow with about an inch thick puffy white head. The smell is of corn, grain, and a glimmer of hops and not quite as metallic as its older brother Budweiser regular. The mouthfeel is fairly thin. The taste is slightly hopped and grassy but not as horrible as other reviewers have noted and it leaves no aftertaste. It goes down pretty quickly like water."
" deffinately sessionable"
"Pours a clear golden yellow color with a small head. The aroma is of grains and there is a small presence of hops. The smell is better than other light beers. The taste has slight floral hops and once again is better than other light beers in this class. The mouthfeel is of moderate carbonation. Overall this beer isn't great, but it is better than others in the class."
"It is clearly a bud product. It tastes like every other bud product. This beer is nothing special. My friend is absolutely crazy about this beer and I have no idea why. He likes the macro lagers but I mean c'mon you have to know that this is junk. I wouldn't even drink it if it were free."
"I have had this beer in the past, before I was really into craft beer, and thought it was decent. For what it is, it is a decent beer. It has good flavor for a light lager and it is highly drinkable in the sense you could easily have many of these. Compared to something like a Goose Island IPA it is watery. I know its easy to bash the big boys but I rated this beer as to how it compares to others in its category and by that standard its a winner. Will I seek this beer out? No. I was at a festival this weekends and this was one of the three beers they had. The lesser of the three evils."
"Overall, it's not a very good beer. This is lighter than light beer. If Dasani made beer-flavored water, this is what it would taste like."
"Not really any worse than Bud Light or Bud, but certainly not better."
"D= you'd survive if it was the only beer at a party."
"D: Definitely not worth the money -- there are many other alternatives for a lighter beer that will give you greater flavor and more bang for the buck. At the very least it goes down easy, but lacks character or intensity. Bland, bland, bland..."
"A pale clear yellow with a thin fizzy head,well carbonated no lacing. Aroma of cooked corn and hay, and a hint of grain. Flavor is pretty bland,slightly sweet,corn and paper,slightly metallic. Thin watery body,with a crisp clean mouthfeel. This was drinkable and not offensive but I don't believe I would ever buy it again for any reason."
"As expected, this is wonderfully drinkable, as it has hardly more flavor than a glass of club soda -- in fact, I'm fairly sure that I drank a few different types of carbonated mineral water in Germany that had more flavor to them. Calling this ""beer"" almost seems sacriligious, but the definition of what beer is classes this accordingly. What a shame."
"Final Thoughts: Not bad if you're counting calories."
"D: Yet again, comparing this only to other macro styles its got decent drinkability. Goes down incredibly easy and is nice and light in the belly. Not bad at all for 99 calorie brew. I've sure as hell had worse and this beer is not bad at all. Sure its not a mind blowing brew, but it is a macro style lager. Its not meant to blow your mind. Its to keep you refreshed and cool you off. It does just that and brings a bit of flavor to the equation. Could be a hell of a lot worse thats for sure."
"Pours a pale golden color with no head. Smells faintly of straw and mainly corn. Tastes the same way. Its highly carbonated and has a very dry finish. It drinks easy so if you wanted something inoffensive and to slam back 8 of this would be an ok choice, but all in all its boring."
"Once of the worst I've had thus far."
"Bud Select has a limpid straw-gold color, crystal clear, with little head retention after an initial burst of foam. The nose is very neutral, a touch grainy, but otherwise almost non-existent. The flavor is sweet malt, with no detectable bitterness. But, it's very clean and not excessively grainy. Bland is the key word for this beer."
"Cheers"
"well, it is not as good as other light beers. so therefore, why would I prefer to drink this over other at least passable options?"
"Very pale yellow with a white head that fades quick and leaves no lace. Smell of faint toasted grain and nothing else. Tastes of watered down cereal grains, mildly sweet with a watery mouthfeel. This beer is lame, avoid. There are a million better beers, even in this catagory."
"Final Thoughts - What is there to really say? We know what it is, a low carb macro brew. It contains minimal calories and taste. That being said it goes down easy enough for drinking games and whatever else. Little other redeeming qualites (used to be $1, but now sits at $1.50 a pint. Always a winning feature in my book)."
"Drinkability is low to moderate. The beer would be sessionable due to the low alcohol, but the flavor profile is boring at best, and what little is happening tastes generic and poorly crafted."
"thin, fizzy and watery. what else to expect?"
"Good for beer-pong, beer games, and those trying to watch their weight while drinking 'beer.'"
"Watered down taste,light slightly tart fruitiness,again a mineral water taste as in the aroma. Finshes with a light drying tartness. Very smooth,not filling easy to drink,no off flavors,very clean. Not all that bad could see the drinkability factor. Just not enough taste for me,although i wouldn't turn a cold one down on a hot summer day."
"I have to admit, I still purchase this when my in-laws come to town, something that they will drink and I can stomach."
"Out of a 24oz. can this beer produced a ridiculously huge foamy head of off-white bubbles. The retention was decent and the lacing scattered. The aroma was of corn mash, grains and some light hops. The flavors were a cleaned up version of regular Bud, but still quite washed out. Pale malt, bleached hops. Decent balance and a session beer for those who fear taste. The mouthfeel was prickly and watery, the carbonation high and the body light. Skip it."
"D: Just terrible. Atrocious. I could not even finish a whole can."
"Pours a piss yellow with think white head that dissapates rapidly, no lacing. The smell is pathetic, you cant smell anything. The taste is watery with slight hop taste. The mouthfeel is similar to drinking tonic water, carbonated and tingly. It is drinkable because it is pretty much water. This would be a good beer if you were sweating one out at a ballpark, otherwise pass."
"D- The good news here is that I could enjoy this beer all night during any time of the year. I'd say that this is a slightly upgraded version of MGD 64."
"This is not trying to be anything other than what it is, and I think it does it much better than the other light beers I've tasted."
"Not bad for a Am macro session beer, which is why I got the keg - for my guests. (I was drinking my Pale Ale home brew!) ABV is a little light for my preference to buy on my own. I would prefer a bottle over the can any day. Better than Bud Light and most light beers in my opinion."
"Bud select ended up not being as bad as I expected but I only drink this when there is nothing else or it's really hot and I'm in need of a beer that is not too heavy."
"Poured a 12oz bottle into my Bullfrog Ale pint glass. This beer pours a really light straw with a big white head that melted away into just a thin layer. The aroma is canned corn with just a hint of grain. The taste is almost nonexistent. The flavor is slightly corny but mostly just watery. The mouthfeel is slightly dry but mostly just watery. Unless you don't like beer, definitely stay away from this one."
"Drinkability: As is the case with so many of these macro lager, there's really just not much to it."
"definitely encouragement to win at beer pong."
"There really isn't much to talk about here. In a blind taste test I might not be able to tell Bud Light and Bud Select apart. It's not that I couldn't taste a difference, it's just they are equally light and watery and I wouldn't be able to pin which is which. It's best quality is, once again, mouthfeel and drinkablity. Easy to drink, and hey it's cheap too! Good college beer?"
"Pours a pale, clear yellow with no head/retention/lacing. Smells very weak, but you can still pick up on adjuncts in a watery lager. Fits the style well enough. Tastes of adjunct in lager, but very weak body overall. It is smooth and crisp though. Overall, wow this is barely beer at all - not recommended."
"The only thing this beer has going for it is the drinkability. Other than that, nothing. If your looking for a lite beer, than try Bud light, or any of the other lite macro/adjunct lagers out there. Just don't wast your money on this folks. Not recommended!"
"Overall not a very good beer, except for slamming. I find it funny that Budweiser put select on the label. There is nothing about this beer that is very special."
"Unlike some others on this site, I'm not above drinking an Anheuser-Busch product from time to time. I'm also not below trashing their products. But come on, if you're going to call yourself ""Select," at least taste like something other than Bud Light. It pours clear yellow with the tell-tale foamy white head. More corn and sugar in the nose, but with a bit of metal (even though this came out of a bottle). Taste is sugar-water mixed with rice Chex. Excuse me while I burp again from the carbonation."
"D- Definitely drinkable in large quantities. Goes down easily."
"Unless you want to drink a lot of over priced beer avoid!"
"Poured from a can. Pale straw yellow color with one inch of white head that quickly disappeared. A little lacing is left on the glass. The smell and taste tells me this is very watered down macro lager. Just a little grainyness but no hops and no malt. Light body and the carbonation is a little lower than Bud. Drinks like a low alcoholic water so it goes down quickly. Even for a light lager this is poor."
"drinkability: very easy. only good for long hot days."
"Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: The beer has a thin body. The carbonation is limp at best. Dam near a drain pour. Just a piss poor beer drinking experience."
"Im really not sure of the direction they were going with Bud Select. I'm with everyone else when I say I don't particularly like this beer. Nothing special in the color or aroma of this beer, little head retention also does little to boost it's score. I think that it does have a slightly better taste than regular Bud but that doesn't do much if you like stronger more flavorful beers. I would go with another choice before buying this one."
"Well I see everyone hates this beer because of lack of flavor and all that. but to me it's better than regular bud or bud light. Very light macro kind of thing going on here. The thing i like about this beer is no aftertaste...And I like that in a macro. I mean, who wants a lot of after taste in a macro light lager? Do you really want to taste a super light macro lager??? Do you think a super light macro lager is going to be some flavor explosion?"
"D: i can't even really give this points on drinkability, its just not anything that i'd drink on a night out, there's a bunch of other beers in this style that i'd rather drink."
"After five of these it gets boring and feels a bit syrupy on the palate. If your looking for taste in a beer this is not the one, it is how ever a refreshing beer that would be nice with a heavy meal or on a very hot day. I would prefer Sam Adams Boston Ale with a meal though it offers more flavor and bite."
"The taste has nothing going on. Everything is lightly done and judging what is there, it's better off that way. Even the slight hop bitterness isn't close to being done right. Mouthfeel? Bad. This *is* an avoid beer if I've ever tasted one."
"American Macros are supposed to be inexpensive, easy to drink, and taste decent. This beer is more expensive (in my area) than all other mainstream macros by $2-4 per case. This beer fits into the easy to drink category, but fails on the decent taste category, not good, especially for a macro."
"Taste: The big difference for me between this and Bud is that Bud Select has a smoother taste and is easier to drink."
"Overall, I had several because they kept handing them to me...which seems reasonable. So, I guess these are sessionable at a hot tailgate and they are being offered. Other than that, why bother?"
"D: An OK macro lager, simple mildly flavoured beer, left me with a mild headache after drinking it though."
"I expected a little bit better, but wasn't terrible. Has to be cold to be enjoyed. Crisp and clean, but lacks any substantial body or hop flavor."
"See Michelob Ultra... or any other light lager for that matter. It's not awful but not good either. 4.3% is actually surprising. This just isn't smooth, not good and not refreshing enough for me to want to ever drink it again though. I will select not to have this again."
"Drinkability- It not a bad hanging out or mowing the grass beer."
"I will avoid in the future. Regular Bud as bad as it is, is better."
"Ah another nasty light/low-carb beer, yawn I've had tap water with more body and flavor than this. Aroma is stale gym socks, appearance is a respectable pale yellow with surprisingly good lacing and strong carbonation, mouthfeel is horrible, flavor isn't too far behind tastes like beer flavored styrofoam, overall a poor beer."
"This is a light bodied lager. It pours a watery yellow. It doesnt smell or look like anything special but this isn't that poor of a beer. This beer is pretty tasty for its price and class. Perfectly carbonated and smooth compared to others in its class. IMO one of the best beers when you're looking for a cheap, tasty beer that you can throw down one after another."
"The aroma is mostly of corn and other adjuncts, same as regular bud. Maybe slightly less offensive. Boring appearance of yellow, with a white head, true to the style. The flavor is of corn, malts, other adjuncts. No hops flavor, or hoppiness in the finish. Not nearly as good as PBR."
"Stick with regular Budweiser if you're given the choice between the two.."
"Drinkability is not really in the cards. Unless you're tailgating or doing something rushed, this isn't worth it."
"I actually rather enjoyed this beer. It is what it is, just a light lager so I'll rate it that way. Appearance is ok, straw yellow with a bit of lacing but no head. Smell is weak, light malt and only a bit of hops. Taste is average for the style, nice and clean. Mouthfeel is a bit weak even for a light lager but not too bad. Drinkability is good."
"M/D - Light bodied and very crisp. Well carbonated. A drinkable beer, but nothing I would ever stock in my fridge."
"D - Eh. Not great. Budweiser is better, and this is just a sweeter Bud Light. Wouldn't even drink this if I had to."
"The only purpose I can see for this beer is when it's 100 degrees outside, you're parched, and you need something you can slam real quick to quench your thirst."
"Gee, this was the last of the 12. I actually drank the 12 pack and don't remember anything about it."
"Pale yellow color light beer with a quickly fading head.Taste and aroma are your basic barley rice and corn.This beer is a bit watery but it does go down pretty smooth.Another beer that won't be winning any prissy awards but perfect for a hot day,BBQ,or family outing."
"It pours a light-medium, clear gold with a small amount of head. Like all Budweisers, it has a watered down taste and body. It has a small wheat taste that can only be described as the Bud taste, very unsifisticated."
"You know, I thought Bud and Bud light were bad, but this one takes the cake. It taste like half water and half Budweiser. Its a good thing they have a quality marketing campaign. The color is yellow with not much of a head. Doesn't smell like much. Maybe some grain. Body is lighter than water. I wish I could give this a zero."
"When Anheuser-Busch came out with Select I'm pretty sure they closed there eyes and looked the other way when they ""selected"" the ingredients they used. Pours a pale yellow (cold pee?) Barely any taste with a hint of malt and some dead hops. This is a beer oyu drink hard and fast so you can act like a jackass with your frat buddies."
"There is not much to say or taste here. It pours very light yellow. The body is very clean and clear with lively carbonation that forms a thick white head. The aroma is light, mostly of rice and hay. There is not a bit of hops anywhere. The flavor is also very light. Mostly of rice, paper and hay, that leads you to a crisp clean finish. Overall its low carbohydrate, low calories and low on flavor."
"Had at the company Christmas Party as it was the only beer available at the bar that I hadn't rated. Smell was an average pale lager like malt and yeast. Drank out of the bottle, but assuming it was pale clear yellow like all other pale lagers mostly. Taste was a definite corn like sweet malt, moderate bitterness for the style, and moderate to high carbonation. Very drinkable, especially out of the bottle. and actually I thought it was worthy of much better than the bottom 5% of the lowest style of beer. No bad or off flavors really. Just bland corn, crisp malt."
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability: Light fizzy beer, easy to quaff, though for all the fratties out there this one might be way to full in body to play beer pong or other drinking games with. You do know that this is bud select, it is way better than any beer ever brewed...yeah brody! This is a beer I drink when I want to get drunk, there is no other reason for its existance, and usually when I buy it I'll have already drank enough to the point where I don't care what it tastes like, as long as I can continue my feel good buzz."
"This was the only option at a recent visit to a friend's house. Ugh."
"I don't see the point of this brew. It is advertised as the ""select"" hops and barleys, or something like that. There's nothing here. It isn't as big (or swillish) as Bud and is heavier than Bud Light (no pun intended), but there's nothing here. The smell is faint of these so-called select hops, and the taste is like Bud but with more water. It goes down smooth, real smooth, and I think this is just a chug beer being advertised as something better than it is. For the price not worth it. I can get watery chug beers lacking flavor that are cheaper."
"One of my favorite quotes from Blazing Saddles is ""What is it that ain't exactly earth, and it ain't exactly water? QUICKSAND!"" That's where Bud Select falls into at almost every aspect. It's not as interesting as Bud, but better than Bud Light. Flavors are on the light side with a concoction of rice and bubblegum. and not terribly offensive. After that, it has a dry aftertaste. In the end, this beer is just there to grab consumers who are intersted in a light beer."
"Unlike most beer I'm used to, this HAS to be drunk extra extra cold. That should tell you something (no offense to those enjoying Guinness draught cans). Not much color here; minimal aroma, average head. A little heavy on the carbonation; mass-produced taste with a little bitterness. Not much on the finish; slightly unpleasant aftertaste. Would do in a pinch - maybe good for the racetrack that allows you to bring a cooler to the stands."
"Drinkability: This is a beer that you could drink and drink and drink. Not saying that I'd want to drink and drink and drink it, but hey, it's cheap and if you're passing some time watching a game or something like that, it won't knock you on your rear."
"I wouldn't buy this beer but aways enjoy when someone hands me one on a hot day. This is certainly the last time I'll pour it in a glass though. Much better out of the bottle (or funnel) for some reason."
"This has become my crap beer of choice. It is Clean and Crisp with a decent taste to it. It is low on calories, has decent alcohol levels, isn't expensive and is really easy to drink. If you want to drink all the way through a double header grab a case and have at."
"12 ounce bottle, born on date of 6/26/07. Served in a Sam Adams BL glass, the beer pours a clear straw gold color with an inch white head. Head retention is low, lacing is good. Smells like sweet malt and corn. The aroma isn't bad at all, it's non-offensive. Taste is similar to the aroma, tastes like sweet malt and corn, no hops noticable but for a light lager I don't expect to smell any hops either. No offensive flavors at all, although the corn taste is a little strong. Mouthfeel is light and a bit watery but finishes clean. However, it's very easy to drink. In the bottle or on tap, it's pretty easy to drink. For the style, it's not bad. It's hard to believe, but if you want a light lager there are certainly a lot worse choices out there."
"This stuff pours piss yellow with quite a bit of snow white head,it smells like cardboard,not much taste like crappy bottled water,I'm sure thats what they were going for,too much carbonation and very watery.The upside that I can see is that it's supposed to be good for you(low carb),I could drink as many of these as are left in the fridge (23)...thats why I love BUD SELECT!!!"
"I was supposed to ""Expect Everything"" from Select, but got absolutely nothing from it. I'd like my money back."
"D:Very drinkable. I could drink this all day long and drink many more without incident."
"D - Its very smooth and has a light taste so its easy to drink"
"How the beer gods must weep."
"I promise I'm being fair here, there are macro's of this type that when given one, I can drink. This was free so I gave it a try. Poured into a pint glass, no head, straw colored I guess, I was in a club. Smell sort of metallic. Watery mouthfeel with soda carbonation. A metallic, vegetable taste, very weak but was there. I could not drink more than a few sips, yet I can't pinpoint what was so objectionable. There was another AB product given out on a promotion, not nearly so bad."
"Drinkability: Good brew for a hot day. If I had to drink a light beer, this would probably be an acceptable choice."
"Okay this one is an alright bargain beer, although I some how tend to get headaches when drinking any bud products. I would probably never buy this beer but some one happened to leave it in my fridge. I would imagine this would be a good beer to buy for the kids in front of the convenience store, or even a beer to get a rippin good hang-over. But the enjoyablility is not quite there."
"D- Drinkable beer only because it is relatively cheap and you can drink a ton."
"D - Astonishing, you could consume an entire case to yourself, and I have, on more than one occasion."
"It's like yellow water. Urine colored, to be exact. Soap bubble-like white fizzy head. It smells like metallic corn and wet hay. The taste is slightly better than the smell. Very watery in the mouth. I suppose it's somewhat drinkable because of its water characteristics. It doesn't taste horrible it just doesn't taste much like beer. Especially after I drank about 20 mugs of Warsteiner Dunkel last night at an Oktoberfest celebration. What the hell is ""select"" about this beer?"
"I certainly do not recommend this beer at all."
"In other words, I only drink this beer when I don't want heavy flavors and want something refreshing to drink by the pool. The new Slim Line cans actually help out by being packaged very nicely."
"It is a typical yellowish-amber like any number of American lagers. Aroma is not strong and just a little malty. Flavor is OK, better than other mega-brewed light lagers, but that is not saying much! Smooth, not complex, it is a good party beer but not much fun for a serious connoisseur."
"Could drink a whole lot of these because of its lightness, but not much taste here"
"Smell is vaguely beerish, but very plain. Taste just doesn't go anywhere, I've had tap water with a stronger flavor than this. I guess there's nothing to be offended by really, but there's nothing to get exited about either. The only item in their slogan I'll agree with is ""finishes clean"". It does finish clean, but I wouldn't characterize the taste as distinct, bold or flavorful."
"This is another so-so effort from a major brewer. At least they are keeping the alcohol content down."
"To me, Bud Select tastes no different than any other A-B product.I guess it'll work if the beer is very cold and the day is very hot."
"This sucks just like most A-B products. A low-carb, low-cal beer without the labeling. Why does A-B make so much of basically the same product (Bud, Bud Light, Michelob, Michelob Light, Michelob Ultra, Michelob Ultra Amber)? All pale lagers that deliver little or no taste nor satisfaction. Watery carbonation in a bottle."
"Best I can describe is watery. It is basically a light beer and that reflect in the taste. It does have a crisp feel but that may be due to the temperature it is served at, but falls flat on taste. It is average in color for the type of beer that it is. It is best served extremely cold in my opinion. Once it warms a little the crisp taste quickly erodes and you are left with a rather bitter tasting very watery flavor."
"I would say this is worse then Bud Light, defaintly worse the Michelob. No reason for it to exist."
""
"Pours a standard clear yellow color with a nice head. Aroma is bland with corn adjunct standing out more than anything. Taste is much of the same, sort of dull and harsh with an unimpressive backbone. Good for a lawnmower beer but unimpressive in general."
"A poor cheap beer, and it's not even that cheap."
"I used to work for AB and they hyped this beer like crazy. Part of their hype was it was a beer with no aftertaste. I happen to like the aftertaste of beer. And ""no aftertaste""? More like no taste at all. AND then they told us they were marketing it towards women. OUCH if I were a women I would have been PO'd."
"got one because it was on the menu and I never see this one so what the hell right? Poured a pale golden yellow with a big fizzy white head that faded to just a thin fizzy ring on top. Lots of visible carbonation. Light grain smell, a touch of rice or corn or something else, but very light smell. The taste was ok when ice cold. Very grainy and grassy with a touch of a yeasty property to it. Crisp clean refreshing mouthfeel, perfect for when its hot. This is very drinkable coming out of an ice box when it is very hot. Overall I guess its a little better then normal Bud, I guess. It is still rather bland, but does seem to have somewhat more of a flavor profile to it. At least like they were trying to do something, though it is defiantly in the smae vane as a budweiser. A little darker maybe, but pretty much the same. I figured hell it was better then a corona right? Next maybe get water."
"The beer was very easy to drink. It is what it is - a low carb light beer. It certainly has more flavor than Ultra."
"edit: Somehow another bottle of this found its way into the fridge...was it really as bad as my first experience?...in a word, an emphatic yes, perhaps even worse... my taste # is going to 1. I really can't believe that something this bad is actually presented to the public as beer and ""Select"" no less."
"Anyhoo, extremely pale color, lighter than urine, really, with a thin cap of head and tons of visible carbonation. Faint nose of adjunct and sugars. taste is like grainy, mineral touched tap water: almost nothing at all but what is there is poor. Mouthfeel is thin to none. Even if free, this isn't much of a beer at all."
"12 oz slim can to appeal to the abnoxious and trendy energy drink crowd. Pours very pale yellow with large and unnatural soda-pop carbonation. Is this carbonation really a result of fermentation? Soft drink like smell that is barely there. It's a light sweet smell. Taste has just the slightest hop character to balance the slight sweetness of corn(Is this beer fermented corn-syrup?). I can drink it if there is nothing else, but I'm not proud of it. It's dryer than regular Bud, meaning a more pronounced hop bitterness, but the malt(CORN) character is also much lighter bringing a beer that has a lighter flavor than Bud. WHY?"
"Of very little redeeming quality."
"Two thumbs down."
"It is slightly smoother and very refreshing if served cold. In fact, this beer tastes like vomit IF it is not served as cold as possible. Don't let it get warm and you will enjoy a refreshing beverage with no great taste."
"I have this beer from a 10 oz. can , i serve it in a mug it was very cold. The appearence is a light gold color and it has a foamy white head.The smell is hard to find and when you find it is nothing to be impress about. It have a very light light taste ( a lot of carbonation) , it feels good in the mouth, like refresh. This is just another ""regular"" beer."
"like idiotic men?"
"Drinkability of this is slightly better than average. A decent lawnmower beer."
"12 oz. bottle- color of , pale gold , with a decent white head - nose of sweet corn , sour , very mild hops , malt , metallic , and bubblegum Â– taste of corn , sour , earthy (not the good type) , malt , and some bitterness - body is light (watery) , and with medium high carbonation Â– aftertaste of grass , sweet /sour , and soap"
"Overall bottom 15% for quality. I could see drinking it on a hot day after mowing the lawn, or when they're on special at your local bar and you are looking to drink a lot. Other than that nah, not a top choice."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: It's light bodied. Easy enough to drink. Bad taste really spoils the drinkability though. Overall, it's not good. I think it's a step above Bud Light. But, I wouldn't recommend it."
"Taste is a bit fruity, sort of apple like and some grainy sweetness. Again not much here. This beer is crisp and pretty clean with a nice carbonation level, and is definitely light bodied. Not that great, as one would expect."
"D- its not. its hard to finish one of these let alone ever drink another. My choice in AB light lagers is definately Bud Light."
"The only good thing I can say about it is that I couldn't taste any adjuncts. Or much of anything, really."
"overall this is an ok beer, better than both bud and bud light but nothing to write home about"
"pours with a decent head....no nose ....no taste ....no lacing ...no beer? I wasn't aware this was only 99 calories...you'd think they would harp on that a little more.... but even in the light catagory...this is subpar. A hint of malt and hops but to the untrained palate... this might as well be yellow carbonated water. If you must go AB stick with the Michelob products."
"Brought to me in a pint glass. This beer had the apperance of urine if you were dehydrated. Very little head, but hints of retention, its only redeeming quality. The taste was as advertised... ""clean"" yes so clean that it's hardly there. The mouthfeel was very weak, incredibly watery with a slight burn of carbonation on the finish. Never again."
"This came from a 12 oz bottle. This one poured light yellow and was very watery. There was no head. Flavor is light malts and a hint of hops. The mouthfeel was clean and fresh, and there was not much of a finish. This was actually not too bad for a light beer if you drink it really cold."
"pours a pale yellow color, looks like a regular bud in color, smell is nearly nonexistent maybe some hops in there but thats it. taste is less than average nothing makes this beer stand out, nothing makes it awful though either. mouthfeel is less than average aswell, all this being said i can, and have drank this stuff all day long, be it at a nascar race or at a bbq, its good enough to drinkall day long, but not something i'd want to take over a huge multitude of other beers"
"D - Avoid at all costs."
"Lots of people buy it so somebody likes it, whether it be marketing or opinion...probally marketing."
"Stylistic Accuracy: Good"
"Drink-Ability: Like I said this beer tastes like crap! I tried to be fair but there is just to much lacking here to drink. If I am going to drink a Macro then this will definitely not be the one, stick to something with flavor."
"Donated a double duce for free. Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, beer is a very clear, light golden color. Smell is not very apparent, but is of corn malt and some other off-putting smells. Taste is like the nose with a slight metallic taste and dry finish. Goes down like water, I would actually be impressed if someone could make a ""beer"" that had less flavor and body than this masterpiece. As I stated, this goes down like water, but I wouldn't buy this beer."
"another piss water from anheuser, its name dont remember that represents, then this beer is a little better than bud and bud light, beers rich in corn and sugar; i try this with mexican totopos in a footbla soccer match, in a pilsner glass off course; but in general i recommended this beer a 55%."
"Pretty much your standard Macro Lager. I don't think this is any better than a regular Budweiser. Marketing."
"It does quench thirst, and it does not offend in any way except its lack of interesting features."
"Was a pretty decent beer to take along camping, a time when you aren't focused so much on quality as you are on quantity."
"Like so many other light lagers, only a vestige of taste remains. As is the case with AB light lagers, that remaining taste is more or less cheap crap. Select is a little better than Bud Lite, though, as it's crapiness is cut dramatically by a nicely crisp mouthfeel."
"Your average beer. I got this at Prime Time Sports Grill and there was nothing really that select about it. I thought it was very average, very very average. There wasn't any head, if any at all. There was no lace at all. I've struggled to lable the macro smell, and I haven't come up with anything yet, but that's what it smelled like, a macro. The taste was the same, macro. It was a decent beer. It's main saving grace was that it didn't give me a splitting headache like bud light. Don't drink and review."
"Not a bad beer, but not a great one either. Best enjoyed from a bottle, bud select is what I'd describe as a party beer. Something you take to a party since I wouldnt care if someone took a couple bottles since its not very expensive at all. Ive had it in a can, which makes it taste bland and frothy. I was lucky enough to actually find a place that has it on tap, but they served it in a chilled, way too cold, mug, which ruins the taste. The best bet is from a bottle. It looks and tastes like any other budweiser beer, but does have smooth aftertaste as advertised. Its smell is practically nonexistant. Its smooth aftertaste makes it an ideal party beer. Not a bad beer, but its still not a superb beer."
"However, I've had worse in macro beers. It is very drinkable cold and would be worth buying if you're going cheap or are on the Atkins diet."
"This is sad, I won't be referring to this as beer. Their attempt to unseat Ultra as the low carb, light lager will probably fail. Hopefully, they will put this swill out of its misery soon"
"A young friend of mine gave me one of these little turds in a bottle. I was of course skeptical, but actually a bit surprised. The brew had an aftertaste I've never tasted before. I suppose it was a mixture of non malted grains, such as extra corn and rice. However, it seems this is really just a marketing ploy by A-B to give themselves a new edge to the masses. A-B has done a lot in the past to keep American brewing alive, so why can't they adapt to what American beer connoisseurs really want? Full flavored beer! Don't feed me any Michelob Hefeweizen crap please!"
"Fin."
" Sort of silly really, what do you think the select means? hmmm?"
"Budweiser Select was very clear pale yellow color with a white head. The head was quick to fizzle away to a thin ring and completely disappeared before I finished the beer. The aroma was almost nonexistant, But there might be a little grain in there. The taste was very light and crisp with a clean dry finsh. The mouthfeel was very light with plenty of carbonation. Drinkability was below average. It's slightly better then Bud Light, but that's not saying much. Avoid."
"When it comes to Budwieser this is actually one of the best. It's maltier, it's got a better body, it's even slightly hoppier. It's still very mild and thin, but it's not that bad when it comes to macros."
"Their marketting department must've been trying to sucker in us beer snobs but it'll only work once.... I'll never get it again... anybody need 23 cans?"
"D - As far as light beers go, it isn't too bad. It actually has some flavor."
"I would *love* to swap some Arrogant Bastard into these bottles and unleash them on unsuspecting bar patrons. They would probably burst into fire."
"CONDITIONS: MOWING/WORKING ON CAR- n WITH FRIENDS- n SIPPING- n GET MY BUZZ ON- n"
"Absolutely awful. I was very offened that my friends got me this."
"It is less smooth than most macros. It is a lot of water and with a harsh edge that mysteriously arises. This is a below-average macro to say the least. I would take a regular bud over this easily."
"Bud Select is easy to drink. Its has a bit more taste than soda water, but not much."
"I no longer find this drinkable. Sad...I was really enjoying the first couple of sips as something unusual and unique."
"DÂ—It is what it is, a macro lager that is lacking overall. However, itÂ’s light and refreshing and probably my choice when drinking a macro brew."
"I was at a party, and the usual bud light drinking crowd hosted, and I suppose they got caught up in the hype and bought ""budwesier select"". It's light bodied, crisp and dry. It tastes better than budlight, more flavor, hops and less aftertaste. This is just a marketing beer, not worth it and it seems like its time has already passed."
"This beer poured a very pale yellow color with a one finger head that disappeared quickly. Aroma was slightly malty with a little bit of that vegetable adjunct smell mixed in. Taste was typical for a light macro lager- very light malt flavor, barely perceptable hop character and some corn flavors mixed in. Mouthfeel was very thin, watery and bland. Drinkability was low for me due to the almost total absence of taste. At least I didn't pay for this. I'll take a Sam Adams Light or Amstel Light over this any day. Not recommended."
"Okay, a macro review ... pours a medium/light golen color with a decent stark white head with good retention. Lots of lacing in the pilsner glass. Nose is predominantly of roasted malts. Just a slight hop presence, but nothing to write home about. Palate is a little bit more hoppy than a standard bud and tastes a bit more balanced in it's malt/hop profile. Mouthfeel is light, of course, with just a tad of hop bitterness remaining. Still a typical malt heavy macro overall. Not a topnotch beer, but maybe better by a nose than most light lagers."
"Light, if any body, fair carbonation...regular Bud almost puts this stuff too shame. I opted to ""select", throw the last 12ozs. away...seriously!"
"Cheers"
"The boring lack of taste is still better than the horrid taste of some of their other products."
"Drinkability - Nothing Select about this brew. Stick with regular Bud if you're a fan of that beer."
"This beer made me angry. I wasn't expecting it to be good, I wasn't expecting to like it, but I did expect it to be at least different. I didn't care how, or what exactly was going to be different, but just something that distinguished it from Bud or Bud Light. Unfortunatley, I had no idea what this beer was trying to be. Has anyone ever drank this and thought to his or herself ""Wow, this is a new idea."" No, this beer is all about marketing, they put the same fucking beer in a different bottle, and I see people everyone ordering this crap."
"This beer is thin, has no smell, and tastes like crap. I could barely drink it."
"This being ""Select"" and the pride of a company is downright comical. And that is coming from someone who lives near St. Louis."
"There's just so little smell and taste. It's hard to describe nothing. I guess there's a bit of a corn taste. It looks as pale and thin as it smells and tastes. The mouthfeel is super light like water. This is incredibly drinkable for it's water-like qualities, but the utter lack of desire to drink this nearly flavorless beverage makes me bring down the drinkability score to a 3."
"Bottom line: AB has spent hundreds of millions of dollars developing and marketing this mess. Why? Avoid it. At least Bud Light is drinkable."
"I think they may need to try and ""Select"" a few other things and give it another go. I would like to taste more malt and def more hops in the ending and smell."
"OK, so this beer has fooled millions into thinking they are drinking good beer. Which is cool, if lack of flavor = better."
"D: Easy drinking. Could drink all day/night, but wouldn't want to. Great beer for college/binge drinking. Looks classier than Bud/Bud Light, but is worse."
"I find it to be more drinkable than regular Bud."
"The lightest color I have ever seen, more of a white then a pale. Small white head which doesn't last. Clean aroma with hints of pear, water and light grain/corn. Disgusting fermented corn water in the flavor without a note to be noted. Terrible. Nasty."
"Â¡Salud!"
"I really cannot tell a difference between this and Bud Light. Maybe a bit more carbonation but that is it. Pours light golden with a decent head that does not last very long. Taste is pretty much water with faint hints of corn and alcohol. Just not enough character to satisfy my tastebuds. Only good thing is the ""born on date"". I wish other breweries would do this!"
"Poured a very pale yellow, with very little foam. Nothing exceptional with this beer. After awhile, all Bud's taste the same. This is a good beer on a hot day or while sitting around watching sporting events. Average taste, average, average, average."
" Eric"
"Very pale yellow, very clear, thin white foam, but not enough to call it head. Very little to smell, some grain, typical lager smell. Very thin and light bodied. Another crisp, clean brew, with hardly any flavor. Oh wait, tried side by side with Bud Light, and it does have more taste to it. Again, glad I didn't pay."
"Overall: Bold taste, finishes clean? Nope. Better than a Bud? Maybe. Better than a Bud Light? Hell yes. Better than most other decent beers out there? Fuhgetaboutit. Not recommended."
"I mean...where's the pride??? How cheap do you get???"
"Verdict: Don't bother. You might as well put the beer down and drink a Pepsi instead; the Pepsi will have more flavor."
"The mouth feel was the highlight of the beer, so if youÂ’re not so much into the taste or smell, this just may be a winner for you. WhatÂ’s going on here? This is as non-beer-like as you can get. Yes, itÂ’s very different, but itÂ’s not a lime soda; itÂ’s supposed to be a beer."
"As a former AB wholesaler, this to me, tastes like the old Mich Dry recipe re-born in a different package. AB swears by it's clean, fleeting finish and that's exactly what Bud Select gives you...just like the old Mich Dry. Watery pour, yellow...nothing golden about this. Thin white head. Rice and malt in the nose. Hops are not present, although Augie III swears they're in there. Carbonation out the wazoo which leads to the fleeting finish. Not recommended and not just for taste, but the horrific hangover it gave my wife."
"In comparison to the standard Budweiser, this is lighter and less flavorful, as if it'd simply been watered down. On the other hand, it doesn't have the sweet maltiness of the regular version, and therefore appears slightly more balanced. It's like a halfway point between Bud and Bud Light."
"Notes: Tasted very similar to the king of all beers, Budweiser but it falls short of its father beer. That's not a compliment to either."
"Seemed to fall somewhere between Budweiser's standard lager and a dry beer - less husky than the standard, with a moderately tart finish that ended on a distinctively dry, astringent note. The overall effect: take a quite average, not terribly flavorful beer and then give it a bit of pucker at the finish. Nothing to see here folks, move along . . ."
"Budweiser Select pours a urine colored yellow with minimal head from a twelve ounce can. Aroma is fairly light, consisting of adjunct. Tastes like a typical light American macro lager, in other words, it tastes of adjuncts and not much else. This is a very light beer, okay for what it is, lawnmower beer. Not recommended."
"Overall better than I expected, but still not a great beer by any stretch."
"D- definitely drinkable. i wouldnt seek this out but if i was left with bad options, i might pick this up again"
"I don't understand how this beer is still on the shelves. I don't think frat dudes will buy it because it isn't an established ""slammin"" beer (see Natty Ice, Beast, etc.) and it isn't quite in the low-carb realm (but it is a light beer) and it most certainly is not an attempt at a craft beer. I don't even think it is trying to go against the Heineken/Beck's import crowd, as I recall Anheuser World Select was supposed to tackle that niche. I don't know who AB is trying to market with this brew, and it would be well advised to anyone who wishes to conserve their taste buds that they stay far away from this one. It may be light in calories and flavor, but what flavor it does have is near putrid, unless you enjoyed having your mouth washed out with soap when you were a kid."
"Won't be ordering again...if i have a Bud...it will be a regular one."
"Poured into my trusty goblet. Sparkly head that goes away in 30 seconds. Lacing present but not to sticky. Not much smell to speak of. Golden color with slight yellow hue. Taste is really bland. Not much carbonation. Very faint hop taste. Tastes like seltzer water. Difficult to believe this could have any alcohol in it. I think i've had more flavorful near beers. I bet this would be a good one though, playing football or softball, when it's ice cold out of a cooler in 90 degree heat and 90 percent humidity."
"Tried one of these. I honestly think there is more taste in bud light! Poured slightly more golden than bud light. Small head. Smells of something. Taste is really just nothing , honestly. It is chuggable though. More so than Bud light Not hard to get down or anything , i just wouldn't buy it."
"Skunky aroma with a touch of hops. Pale yellow with a very nice looking frothy white head. Slightly sweet in the fore with some corn and cereal (corn flakes is about right) in the finish. ItÂ’s a lot better than Budweiser, but it has very little real flavor...more hints of flavor."
"Appearance: Crystal clear straw golden forms a nice sized egg shell white colored head large bubbles leaves specks of lacing around my pint. Aroma: Cooked vegetables low amount of hops come across the radar corn and rice evident mild sweetness typical beer not very ""select"". Taste: Creamed corn flavor comes through with a low sweetness, no real hop flavor some chemical manufactured design going on here not that crisp sort of rogh going down definitely not a good competitor to Miller Lite. MOuthfeel: Thin light bodied high carbonation burps are almost immediately within the first few sips, the fizziness almost makes you choke with each sip. Drinkability: Typical macro lager Bud calls something Select expect it to be mediocre at best that 's what this beer is to me."
"It may be a good choice with many types of food since it is so light."
"Pours a pale straw color with a decent head that dissipates and leaves a spotty lacing. Smell is of cream corn maybe, yeast, alcohol, it just doesn't smell the least bit enticing. Taste is better than smell, but that isn't saying much, very bland flavor, it has a corn flavor, but it's very watery. Mouthfeel is very light, I would rate it higher but the carbonation is way too high. Honestly it's pretty easy to drink, it's not necessarily bad, but it just isn't that good either."
"Pours a very light straw color with a big fluffy head that settles down to a thin creamy layer pretty quickly. Smells very slightly of yeast, and nothing else. Tastes like it smells.. like nothing. Slight bitterness without any hop flavor, slight sweetness without any malt flavor. It's like AB waved some malt over the kettle and showed it a picture of some hops, then just used rice and hop oil to make the beer. The mouthfeel is really watery with a slight tingling on the back of the tongue. Not good at all. It's drinkable, but so is water. And water is cheaper. Just water down vodka, it's the same experience."
"I figured the only way I could pay the least amount to actually try this was to have it at a bar. Cause after having it, there is no way I'd ever want another again. Just... boring. No smell. None. In fact the only reason it didn't get a 1 is because it didn't smell just plain bad. As far as taste goes, it was basically a slightly more flavorful Bud. But not by much, as far as I remember."
"If you're going to buy a bud product like this you may as well go for bud light or natural light which will probably be much cheaper with about the same characteristics."
"Mouthfeel is crisp and dry with a mild skunky finish."
"This stuff is awful!! I bought this a couple of months ago in the summer cause, if worse comes to worse, I can deal with Budweiser regular. But this is way too thin, missing everything except water. No hop presence whatsoever. No malt presence either. I couldn't figure out what they were trying to accomplish except sell at bars to young drinkers who need to drink 40 beers to get a buzz off this stuff. If you are going anh-busch, stick with Michelob or Bud, if you have to."
"Born on date Nov. 23, 2005"
"The beer poured a a pale straw with a white, fizzy bubbled head that rose to just over a finger and dissipated quickly. The carbonation was very visible with little bubbles rapidly traveling to the top of the glass. The aroma was nearly non existent, but after nearly touching my nose to the liquid I picked up some graininess. The taste was quick and insanely clean. Some residual graininess lingers on the tongue with the very dry sensation to the finish. This beer has a very thin mouthfeel, and not the best of what is often thought to be a very flawed style. I would love to see a dry, hoppier finish, like a true european pils. This beer would be quite adqueate with that one addition, but instead it remains quick and bland. This is an easily drinkable beer, but not in the way one would want: the manner in which water is drinkable. Budweiser Select, whose marketing program manifests a step forward for AB - in some way - still needs something more."
"This beer pours with a white frothy head with a golden yellow color. The head holds moderately well and laces decently. The smell is quite harsh, not very apealing. It smells of rice and corn. This is probably a worse smell than skunk. There is hardly any taste at all. The taste is harsh like the smell, it is almost chemical. There are worse beers out there though. This beer is overcarbonated, watery, and not smooth at all. This should only be used for beer pong."
"Finishes almost imperceptibly but oily and sour with a short-lived aftertaste."
"I would drink soda or even a glass of water before having this one again. There's just no point. I'm not into drinking alcohol just for the sake of drinking alcohol, so I really would skip the beer if there wasn't anything better than this available."
"The clears the 12-ounce brown bottle a limpid light gold color with a portly bright white frothy head, the lace a fine coating upon the glass. Archetypal lager nose, sweet malt and little else, start is lightly sweet with a light but present grain profile, the top light. Finish is strikingly acidic, the hops light but there at least, very dry aftertaste, in all fairness, and it is what it is an everyday lager."
"I think this is Micheloeb ultra in different packaging. If I'm out at the bar that only has macros, I might drink this, otherwise I'll pass"
"Is ""Select"" the new ""Ice""? Pale yellow and bubbly with a thin white head and minimal lacing. Faint musty hops aroma, or maybe I imagined it. Seltzer-water character with no real flavor present. DonÂ’t they use the word ""bold"" somewhere in the advertising? Right. The finish is equally tasteless. This beer is DOA."
"This beer is nothing special but it most certainly is crisp, refined, and goes down easy! Pours just like everybody else says and yada yada with the smell and taste. We all know what bud tastes like. This is just about inbetween bud heavy and bud light, it is ""just right"" with the flavor. Bud light is like drinking water that somebody poured a little beer into. Bud heavy is a thicker beer that fills you up quicker. This is probably what bud heavy should be, nice and refreshing but nothing that will blow your socks off. It has easily become my beer of choice when I want to get faded for the weekend as it goes down smooth beer after beer after beer. If I just wanted to lay back and drink a beer it would most certainly be overlooked, but take it for what it is, a beer to be consumed by the mass market in mass quantities. Can't go wrong here!"
"Best used for beer pong."
"I would not recommend this beer for a light lager."
"For the BA score, if I graded it according to style I'd call it at least a 4.0. I think I'd end up giving it a 2.5 or so, but for the style its pretty good."
"D - I suppose you could put down quite a few because of the low alcohol and little taste. A god beer for a frat party, thats about it."
"A bit of a pleasant surprise here. Surprised because I actually didnÂ’t despise this. The color of this was like golden straw. Fizzy and sporadic carbonation with a fizzy head. The aroma has some soft lemony graininess, with just a touch of cooked cabbage hoppiness. The taste is very clean and finishes with a subtle and pleasant graininess. Overall, I believe this is a much smoother than regular Bud. Cleaner and less harsh. I really have not much negative to say about it. Clean and simple, and maybe what regular Bud should really be."
"Allright this is bad but really i don't see it that much worse than regular bud. Looks similar to but and there is no real smell besides the macro chemical norm. The taste is similar to bud also but do i maybe detect some fruityness? Not enough to save it. It still sucks. Watery mouthfeel. Drinkablity is allright but i don't know why you would want to so it is irrelevant."
"Ok as an avid Bud fan I felt I owed it to the people (whoever they are) to review this one. Pours a pale golden color with a big head that rapidly receedes. Other then that it looks totally FLAT. No bubbles rising or anything. Aroma-what aroma? Nowhere to be found. Flavor is best described as if Rainman was describing it-""wet,very wet"". Other then that-nothing. Fair mouthfeel-thin but theres something there. Overall-forget it. Im a big believer in a place and time for everything but this is sad. Has to be the worst lite beer I have ever tried or been offered."
"Pours clear yellow with two finger head. Low head retention, high lacing. very faint adjunct smell, grain and rice most likely. what differentiates this from regular Budweiser is it's lack of aftertaste, which is a good thing considering the poor flavor. It does however live up to the, ""Crisp with a clean finish"" claim; while sacrificing any note of real beer flavor."
"Drinkability: The good news: At least, it got lower contents in carbs and calories. Also, the label is not that bad. Otherwise, the name tells you all and you knows what to do if what to drink higher quality beer: avoid it."
"In my quest for good beer this has got to be one of the worst. Got a 24 pack for the family (along with some Oberon, Full Circle, and Red's Rye). I decided to drink a leftover and give this beer a chance. Pours a very light watery pale golden color. Nice head forms and decent retention. Lots of bubbles along the side of the glass and rising to the top. Smell is mildly grainy in an artificial adjunct sort of way. Taste is almost nothing. This beer is so dry and watery that I can discern almost no flavor. Slightly sweet grain at the initial sip but it goes away right away. Not even refreshing. This beer is worthless."
"On the bright side, I've had worse...yea really. Looks poorly yellow and clear with high carbonation, the same head you get from a diet sprite, and no lacing at all. Smells like spoiled water (is that even possible?) Grainy, vegetive, sour, and almost no sweetness. Tastes more grainy, corn-like (among other cerial grains), sharp and metalic. Body is watery and over carbonated. Finishes crisp and a bit scrubbed. Aftertaste is non existant. Basically a waste of grains, hops, water, and yeast."
"I cannot believe my buddy even bought this stuff! I mean he is a little over weight but not that overweight that he needed to make us suffer through this crap. It poured a pale yellowish color with nice clarity. It smelled of nothing maybe a little bit of grain. It is overly dry causing a cottonmouth feel. Besides being dry it has this crispy bite to it that is most umpleasant. Gross gross gross."
"Regardless if this is from Anheuser-Busch or not, it's below average, that's all. No real lacing, lots of carbonations, ver pale straw colored. Slight corn/rice taste, but nearly as overwhelmingly bad as cheap Macros (Milwaukee's best, etc.). Easy enough to drink. Not horrible, but would not have gotten this if a.) it wasn't $1.50 and b.) it wasn't a requirement to finish a beer club at the local pub."
"I really can't say enough bad things about this ""select"" beer. Managed to down half the bottle for educational purposes."
"poured a pale yellow color with white puffy head. Smell is not much to talk about, maybe a slight scent of grain. Taste is slightly sweet with no trace of hops or malt. mouthfeel is refreshing, just as a glass of water might be. I tried this after a regular budweiser and had trouble telling the difference."
"Color is that of extremely diluted urine: barely any color and clear. Only a barely noted fizzy white head is seen. Aromas, again, are brealy noted. Is that some corny-husky scent I detect? Flavor is like fizzy water. It amazes me that people actually find this to be a beer they WANT to drink. The fizz overpowers anything in the way of ""flavor"". Some grain-like flavor. Husky. Finishes without a trace of any aftertaste whatsoever. It's like it evaporates on the palate. Mouthfeel is laughable. Not drinkable, to say the least."
"Drinkability- Had to mow a decent size lawn this morning, and figured with all this talk about lawnmower beers, I would give this one a try, just to quench my thirst. Lord knows you can't get Prima Pils in Montana. Ended up pouring out about a 1/3 of it and just having water instead. So, when you have to resort to water....sulfer flavored water, instead of any kind of beer....enough said. Avoid"
"did i mention that i actually like budweiser?"
"22 oz., ""born on"" 4/6/05 - figured I was gonna try it one time or another. Served chilled in a nonic. The head is the only thing that looks ok. It's 2 fingers and has decent pits as is recedes, leaving more lacing than I usually see from AB beers. Corn, metal, and other adjunct scents in the nose. On the palate: carbonation. That's it. They've finally figured a way to filter all the flavor out of their beer - it wasn't until near the end of the bomber that hints of corn appeared. Mouthfeel is tingly and very light. I'm staying away from this one in the future."
"These are the type of beers that confuse me. They're almost fitness drinks and they drink as easy as tap water. It's as close to the original, Budweiser, as any light or ultra-light I've had. It seems to be server near-freezing as to numb your tongue and senses. I'm surprised it's 4.3 because I was pretty sure it was no more than 3.4. I'll be darned if they're willing to waste a glass on it, bottle only. It's a good beer to have with nachos & jalepenos but that's about it."
"Pours piss yellow, with a thin white cap. Grainy aroma, watery taste. Crisp and light, sharp mouthfeel. Hard to believe how flavourless beer can get. Only drank it because it was free and was eating crappy burgers. I've had better light beers with more flavour profile. This one truly sucks."
"Drinkable if you want something fast to get your thirst on a hot day, but many many better options. This is too pricey to be a super cheap swill, but has less flavor (a good and a bad thing)."
"Objectiveness right?- as much as I can. I like Bud and Bud light but this is terrible. Very watered down, quite frankly this beer does not have enough of anything that would remotely give off any indelible characteristic. Unfortunaley I purchased a six pack and have lost out on a couple of bucks."
"I decided to try this the other day just for the sake of knowing what AB considers 'select'. I found myself asking what is the big deal. The carbonation is a bit much and the color really light, like your urine after a few regular buds. There was a hint of the hops, but the carbonation overwhelmes them. My first and last."
"Drinkability: This is a standard, American macro light lager that has little to offer a serious beerdrinker. Crisp and refreshing, with no offnotes, but very bland and watery. A decent fizzy light yellow beer that is brewed for the masses who are not seeking any nuances or complexity. Easy to quaff, but so is soda water."
"Purchased at a gas station on a lark in a 24 oz. can. The color is pale yellow, head is just a tiny layer of foam. The aroma is a typical macro beer light sweetness. Nothing special going on with the taste either, just light malts and adjunct sweetness with a very clean finish. I guess drinkability is okay, this doesn't have any off-tastes and is refreshing enough. I wonder, with Bud Light already on the market was there really any reason to release Bud Select."
"Drinkability? I'd rather go for a real club soda. Even if I were really pining for a beer, this wouldn't do it. But again, not totally awful."
"Almost no aroma whatsoever. Only hints of cooked grain and hops. Taste is even lighter. Very subtle hints of bitterness that quickly are overtaken by equally subtle sweetness from cooked veggies. Seltzer like quality is reminiscent of well, Alka-Seltzer with almost no mouth feel and cheweyness you'd expect from a beer. One thing it does have in it's favor is that it is better than Bud light, so if you have a choice between this beer and Bud Light, grab this one."
"for things this light I vastly prefer the japanese super-drys, but in the american lager category, I'd have to say both coors and miller, both of which have at least a hint of malt sweetness, are better."
"Overall, just another macro brew. It is easy enough to drink while painting the garage, IÂ’m sure, and inoffensive when thereÂ’s nothing better. But I doubt IÂ’ll buy this stuff. I'd pick regular Bud over this (well, if only given two choices)."
"I would get sick of this in no time. I have to say that the Anheiser World Select that was test marketed before they changed over to this stuff was much better. Extremely mediocre."
"Drinkability: Sure I could drink this stuff, but I could get about the same amount of satisfaction out of a sprite. This beer rivals the low-carb brews for least amount of character. Not worth your timeÂ… unless you donÂ’t like to taste your beer, then itÂ’s perfect for you."
"At first, I thought popping this was going to be something special that Bud did right, like Michelob, as I was sitting down to watch TV after work with a platter of sushi. It looked a little light and I liked the head it produced in my 50cl glass, but other wise it was nothing special. The first taste revealed elements of regular Bud to Bud Light and it finished like Busch draft. I thought it was so-so with the sushi, as Bud usually goes well with sushi and sashimi for me. Strangely, it tasted as if Bud was designing something to be a thirst quencher for a dance floor and a shallow lo-carb wanna be."
"Pours a one-finger white froth from the bottle being straight up, this fades quickly and there is no lace. Clear very pale amber color. Nose is not there for me, at least it is not skunky like so many from the macros. Light carbonation and very light bodied. Starts with a slight sweetness no detectable hops, watery finish. I would rather drink water than spend money on this ""beer"". $1.25 for a 12oz bottle from Colonial Spirits, Acton, Ma."
"pale yellow with a thin lace for a head. Smells like cooked grains and grass. I little bit of sulfer too. Every thin body with good amount of carbonation. Sizzles on the tounge a bit. Taste slighty sweet and grainy. A small hop presence. Finishes like a bottle of water. Not much going on with this beer. Just a marketing scam by Budweiser to me. There is no point to this beer. Just cheap with no flavor."
"I fail to see what is ""select"" about bedweiser select. This beer is quite tasteless. It does have a bit more taste than bud light or michelob ultra, but it isnt much more noticeable. this is a drinkable beer if you want water but for taste stay far away from this."
"This beer was seriously unimpressive. Thick bone white head on top of what looked like regular Budweiser with extra Yellow No.5. Smelled like...sweat socks. Stronger malt flavor than the regular Bud, heavy corn sugar sweetness and very mild, practically nonexistent hop flavor. Good lacing down the glass, and no aftertaste at all. The ""Vitamin Water"" of American beer, except without the vitamins. If you want taste..get it somewhere else."
"Notes: More drinkable than a Bud Light or regular Budweiser. I was not let down."
"In summation it is just Bud Light without the lingering after taste."
"There you have it, a close contest between two lightweights that didn't settle much of anything. Bud Select looks better (the slightly paler color is more than offset by the superior head) and feels a little better in the mouth since it maintains its carbonation longer. Milwaukee's Best Light smells and tastes a little better. Pretty much a draw if you ask me."
"As bad a brew as I've had from one of the major breweries....I thought this would be ""added"" flavor being it was ""select""...it is not....it has little flavor and what flavor it does have is nasty...it literally tastes like I took a glass of water...dropped an ounce of Bud Light into and mixed it up...this has no redeeming qualities. I'd take a host of light beer over this that have more flavor....the worst purchase I have made in many years...stick to regular Bud if you like AB Macros.."
"Hey, its not far off for its style and its definitely a step up from Michelob Ultra. I really like the bottle too, its got a distinguished, understated elegence. If neither of those ""good"" points appel to you, probably best to avoid this."
"About the best thing that can be said about this beer is that it's relatively Atkins- friendly, being a low-carb beer. It definitely was nothing to write home about, having an extremely bland flavor and lack of character. While making a low-carb beer may be an admirable goal, it seems to me that real beer lovers would prefer one with more carbs, albeit flavor and character."
"Standard clear gold color, small fizzy head. Smell is not very strong. Just when I think i smell some maltiness, it disappears. Taste is pretty much like any other light macro, not interesting, no hops present, and relatively malt free. A little grain is all that is present. Fizzy mouthfeel. What's the point? You can get a 6 packs of hundreds of different craft brews and regionals for what this crap costs. Stay Away."
"Thanks to clvand0 for sharing this with me, as I would not have had it on my own. Poured into my PBR chalice. The beer pours a slightly golden yellow color with a 2 finger head that falls to more than I would expect over top of the liquid. The nose is typical, with a slightly corn sweet grainey character and no hop at all. The flavor is slightly grainey and just touched with some corn sweetness. Not as harsh as others I have had from this brewery. Very clean finish, as promised. The feel is light with a very active carbonation. Overall, its ok. Not a bad beer to sit down with after some hard yard work when you want something to slam."
"Hey, it's not some off da hook beer, but it's good and I like to drink it. Very light, heard it's the low carb Bud beer. Out of the Low Carb beers, it's one of the better ones. Has a maltier and more ""tasteful"" taste than Bud Light, which is just water. Not much on aftertaste, but still has a little malt/hop tinge in the end. Vey easy on the palate, so it's goes down easy and doesn't fill you up. I prefer it over most light beers actually. I know Bud's a big nasty corpo, but they did a good job with this one."
"24 oz. can. A weak attempt at cloning Miller Lite. Bud Light took a beating in the low-carb advertising wars from Miller, due to it's relatively high carbohydrate content. Now A-B has made a brew that is almost identical to Miller Lite: 99 calories and 3.1g carbs. (Miller comes in at 96 Calories and 3.0g carbs) This beer pours to a nice white head with tiny bubbles. Color is very pale, like all the others of its ilk. Aroma is very weak, much like Lite. Flavor is almost nonexistent, very Lite-like. No aftertaste at all. How they got the enhanced mouthfeel is beyond me. Bland as hell and hell-bent on taking back market share that Bud Light lost to Miller in this category."
"Nice idea from Budweiser. I always love it when new things to try come out. I'm not sure if this is supposed to be their version of a low-carb beer or what, but if it is I think they did an excellent job. This beer tastes far better than Michelob Ultra or Aspen Edge. Mouthfeel gets too flat sometimes. Aside from that there's not much of anything special to speak of. It actually reminds more of Miller Lite than it does a Budweiser product. I think I'd call it Miller in a taste test. Not bad though. A nice change of pace. You can only expect so much from your run of the mill domestic brew, with that in mind this is a pretty good beer."
"What the hell? Are they trying to make the most bland beer? One step away from mineral water, but not as tasty."
"Clear gold color, fluffy white head. Head rapidly fades to nothing. I noticed a small periling going on in the glass. Aroma of fresh cut hay, musty wet at that. Flavor can be summed up with lack of. Nothing was there in the flavor department. Mouthfeel is watery and bland. Drinkability? Why?"
"I have to admit, the very first time I had Budweiser Select I actually loved it. But then after a few weeks of drinking it on a regular basis, I grew tired of it very quickly. One good thing is that there is very little aftertaste, but after a while it tastes so ridiculously watered down. I'd obviously recommend this to anybody who is watching their carbs, or maybe if you are participating in some drinking game. But if you want to sit around the house and have a nice cold one, this definitely is not what you are looking for."
"EDIT: Upon reading the reviews of others after posting, I now realize this is a low-carb beer. Damn AB for not expressly saying that - I would not have wasted my money. I feel soiled. Atkins dieters should be drowned in this swill."
"Drinkable yes, for there is nothing here to offend. Again with the roll out this beer had, I was expecting more."
"This is as bad as beer can get. It truly is a low point in the history of beer. In part because Select is not labeled a light beer or low carbohydrate, it is like AB is trying to fool the consumer yet again. DonÂ’t believe the hype. It is a flavorless beer, it is for the masses that donÂ’t like beer but want to get drunk or fit in. Select is as bad as Michelob Ultra. I purchased a 22-ounce bottle for $1.50 in Omaha and split it with BlueMooner. She gave up after a couple sips, I finished my glass for the sake of this review but the rest of the bottle went down the drain. I will never purchase or drink this beer again. I recommend you avoid this unfunny joke."
"Sampled this one along with a Bud Dry Â– thought they may be the same. But no, theyÂ’re close cousins, but a little different. The select is clear, amber yellow, slightly darker than the dry. Little more hoppy in the finish over Dry. (NO aftertaste say the marketing geniuses. Â– why would that be a good thing?) Awfully plain and generally tasteless, but still, not an unpleasant beer, was drinkable outside for an afternoon session. Yeah, better ones are out there awaiting"
"If you want to drink beer without tasting anything, make no mistake, this is the beer for you."
"Overall-I've never seen anything like this, even Michelob Ultra left me with something to taste and didn't just dissapear. I know that's what they were going for but damn. As for the beer, it's nuthing special don't go looking for it unless you like light beer for whatever reason. Sadly, A-B is gonna make billions off this stuff from previously noted frat boys and college girls who can't appreciate the taste of real beer anyway."
"Somebody brought one of these over to my house, so I had to try it because I was curious, but not curious to buy one for myself. Pours a light copper color with very little head and very light carbonation. I smelled it and thought ""maybe my glass is empty, because I don't smell anything"". Look down, and there is beer in my glass. So, very little or no aroma here. About the flavor. Imagine you had a standard Bud Light, then cut it with an equal amount of water. Literally, this beer has almost no flavor at all - slight hint of the standard Bud Light, but barely noticeable. Not even a beer. Hell, I'll just have some water instead. Tastes the same."
"Well, I saw the Super Bowl commericial promising a new beer. In practice, I haven't had Budweiser or Bud Light in quite some time, but from what I remember, this tastes EXACTLY the same as any other macro, so I have to ask what's the point of packaging this in a bomber when it's nothing but the same old, same old?? The only thing nice about this is that the 22 oz was only 1.19, so no big loss to give it a try, but I'll never bother with this again."
"No waywould I buy more of this..usual low carb crap. Doesnt A-B know the low carb frenzy is almost over. I dont see the point in this beer they alreadyhave the abysmal Mich.Ultra..drank everywere by obese idiots with their plate of grease."
"Bottom line... whereÂ’s the beer?"
"12 ouncer sampled. Born on dating. Pours very light straw, nose is non existant. Taste is ultra thin, Body is watery This is worthless swill. More wasting of decent water by AB. The best feature of this product is the ""born on dating "" concept. I wish many other brewery case us Beer drinkers that kind of usefull info. Pass this stuff by, support Micro brewers."
"Well, it *is* a light lager. It looks, well, clear, as a light lager should. Reasonably good head retention on this as well, kind of a fluffy head. Aroma is slightly metallic to me. Flavor is bland, yet crisp, as advertised. Mouthfeel is as stated, no front, mid, or aftertaste. Well carbonated. Not much going on in this beer, yet there isn't anything offensive. A thirst quencher, but that's about it."
"Perhaps Bud Ultra Light is a more suitable name. Poured out to a light yellow golden color, with a short lived white lacy head. Medium light carbonation. Not much of a nose, but hints of stewed veggies and earthy notes were observed. Light airy taste of corn and hops could be a whole lot stronger, but considering this is low carb, it's not bad. Less flavor than Miller light, but a nice change and a bit less abrasive mouthfeel. Worth a try."
"SlÃ inte! (sort of)"
"This poured a crystal clear light yellow color with a small white head. There honestly was not much to the smell, only a few traces of grain. The taste was very weak, with only hints of malt and a bit of hops near the end. What little taste there was vanished quickly. The mouthfeel was very thin, like carbonated water. As for drinkability... its certainly drinkable, but you won't want to drink more than one. I'm not at all impressed with this one, as usual when it comes to AB products."
"I've had dry Italian wines that made your tongue feel like a dry sponge, but this is worse, worse to the point of being a punch-line, seriously."
"Drinkability Â– I enjoy a good Light Lager, but this just didnÂ’t cut it. It wasnÂ’t refreshing, it had a long sweet finish, and the sugars were on par if not bigger than the malts."
"It tastes a lot like Michelob. A little hoppier than regular Bud, but with no nose whatsoever. The only notable feature of this beer is the complete absense of a bouquet, hence asinine ""no aftertaste"" marketing. The flavor stops with almost surgecal precision after the beer is gone. It freaked me out. On the brightside, this beer is about as drinkable as they come. If I got suckered into playing drinking games, etc, this would be a good way to go."
"Clear light gold color, darker by a shade than Budweiser. Head is very foamy and white, rises high and sinks lke a stone. Some limited comma-like lace. Aroma is a little pear-like with a standard malt sweetness, sharp, not seemingly hoppy. Mouthfeel is light, carbonation medium and toned down compared to some macros. Flavor echos the pear impression, a little too sharp and metallic with a bare sense of dry hops. The brew takes a powder mid mouth, fades out of any perspective, but unlike some Light/Low Carbs , doesn't finish quite as watery. Not good, not offensive, mildly drinkable with an OK mouthfeel."
"Why? This beer was probably created to chip away at the macro-lager market. I am sure they are looking to grab more of the market even if it mildly cannibalizes some of their own brands."
"This is drinkable for the masses. My hypothesis: This is Light beer for people who don't yet want to admit that they like or feel the need for low calorie products emblazoned with that word ""LIGHT"". A positioning against Miller Lite more than a beer that stands on any merit."
"This is drinkable in the same sense that water is drinkable, not much there to offend. This probably does taste a bit better than Budweiser Light does but there just isn't anything here for a beer advocate."
"Poured clear straw, no smell, maybe a slight sweet husk, taste was very watery, no real flavor, mouthfeel was like carbonated water, I was expecting something at least as good as regular Bud, but this stuff is seriously watery and tasteless, it makes Bud taste like craft beer! well....not quite, but you get my point."
"Pours out to a standard, golden color in the glass with a moderate-sized head. The aroma is faint and smells of light malt. The taste is very light, with a slight, residual sweetness. It tastes like Budweiser, only more watered down. Honestly, this should be called Bud Light, as it is more like the ""King"" (tougue in cheek here) than the actual Bud Light. The finish is indeed lacking, as it has no aftertaste, just as they planned it. It isn't a bad tasting beer, but it sure could use a bump in the flavor department. When judged against Michelob Ultra, Aspen Edge and Rolling Rock Green Light, it comes out on top."
"The really should change this to Budweiser Anti-Beer."
"Drinkability: OK, easy to have more than one, if you want. I still can't believe this is a low carb offering."
"Drinkability for the macro croud is likely to be high. I am having a tough time finishing it."
"I had a couple of these on tap, over dinner during a trip this week. With little else to choose from, I thought that this would be an interesting brew to try. The beer is extraordinarily light colored with a fizzy, soda-pop head. Not much in the aroma department: cereal grain and carbonic fizzÂ…thatÂ’s about it. The beer is lighter and has less taste than traditional Budweiser. ItÂ’s like a grain flavored water. Some hops in the finish, which is watery and hollow. Serious disappointment."
"Pours a very very pale yellow with a decent snow white head. I mean this is a pale pale beer. Aroma-- still trying to find one. Maybe a bit of crispness but nothing jumps out . Taste is intially a light touch of maltiness, followed by a crisp dryness followed by nothing. Hey they did get of the aftertaste, and damn near succeeded in getting rid of the before and during taste as well. Mouthfeel is thin and watery. Honestly after a couple of sips you wonder if anything is there. My guess is that the ""increase"" in hops was just to let you know that you didnt pick up the bottle of seltzer instead. If you think Mich Ultra is insipid, at least it had the cojones to admit what it was. Budweiser Select makes one think its something special... which it definately is not"
"I'll give it the ol' ""A" for effort. It's a definite step up from the low standards set by other low-carb beers. The splashy packaging and Anheiser-Busch pedigree will probably be enough to make this a market leader if it ever gets released into distribution. Judging by the half-full displays and cold cases, it's a brisk seller here in the Austin test-market."
"Packaged in a twelve-ounce brown glass twist-off longneck with black plastic labels and red and gold lettering."
