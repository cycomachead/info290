This is a filtered brew you can see right though it. The smell is nice with some grains and malt. The taste is light, but rich. There is a lot going on in this brew. For being a light brew it has a lot of flavor and body. There is nothing overpowering in this brew. Old Milwaukee Light has a real nice balance it. The mouthfeel is nice, clean, and refreshing. Pabst Brewing Company did a nice job with this one. I would buy this brew again. Overall I'm giving this brew a 4.75 out 5.","nicholas2121","Oct 02, 2014"

Pours a fizzy yellow color, with white head that dwindles quickly. Flavor wise there isn't anything wrong with this beer, especially when served cold. Smell is some cooked veggies with even a hint of herbal hop notes, really vintage old school beer like this isn't bad compared to the masses it's just as good or better. Plus a 12 pack of this runs $6.49 since that is rediculously cheap, it's a bonus to this light lager. Mouthfeel is light bodied sturdy carbonation nothing exciting but it's cold and wet. Overall an affordable good beer that's good for beer geeks to try to appreciate what we have in craft beer and have an option amongst bigger brewers to justify not drinking BMC.","WVbeergeek","Nov 08, 2011"

It watery and thin and doesn't taste completely crappy therefore I say it's pretty drinkable. No terrible aftertaste either.

Taste is surprisingly not bad, a bit of bite at the start and no apparent aftertaste, but nothing special. Mouthfeel is what all light macros feel like: watery. Definitely easy to drink if you're looking for a beer with almost no taste or alcohol content, or something to funnel at a party.","cratez","Jul 08, 2006"
2.5,0.8,2.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,"Usually hot day out here in Michigan. Time for a lighter beer. Might as well finish off this 30 pack I ""enjoyed"" while camping last weekend. Very light in color, slight head, nicely carbonated. Aroma is almost nothing, slightly grainy but rather clean. Taste is very clean, almost too clean. No off flavors, nice long smooth body but not much else. Great camping beer, not too good of a tasting beer. Not as flavorful as the Miller Lite I had before this one. Well made, just weak and unflavorful in the end.","granger10","Jun 08, 2005"
2.15,-13.3,2,2,2.5,1.5,2,"Final Thoughts: I remember when I was a senior in high school and got a job in the spring & summer in 1992 at the Husker CO-OP in Columbus, NE. (Anyone who has spent time on the farm will know what I'm talking about.) Every Friday was payday, and someone would run over to this little grocery store and pick up a case of this. The guys who worked there were all farmers or retired from farming, and in our area this is what the farmers drank (at the time, now its Busch Light). I would head up to the office to clock out and grab my paycheck and they'd always offer me a couple. I always said yeah, even though I didn't really like this stuff, but it always made me feel good, like the old guys repsected me enough to share their beer with. Aah good times, when things were simple. Just a random old beer memory.","BigRedN","Dec 21, 2004"

2.41,-2.8,3,2,2.5,2.5,2.5,"It was an old milwaukee that was my first beer when I was 15 years old, so when my buddy was drinking it last night, I asked him for a trip down memory lane. I drank it right out of the 12 oz. can. Smells was a little stale, with some corn and malt noticable. Taste was pretty watered down, not much in the hops department, or flavor department in general. This sample made me realize why I didn't make a point of having one of these in the past 6 years. Not that bad, but not many redeeming qualities, except it's price.","TastyTaste","Feb 20, 2004"

There was nothing that stood out about this one, except the fact that it tastes like regular Bud, which is ok for a light beer. I'm definately not a Bud fan, but I would choose this over it, because it is the same thing at a fraction of the cost. It's a major beer here at Crabford... I mean Radford University. It's cheap and freshman chicks don't know the difference, so it's a frat boys best friend.","JISurfer","Sep 13, 2003"

Although, I was drinking this beer as I was playing horseshoes in 100 degree weather. At that time, I would say anything would have tasted good. Before then, I tried it once and have tasted worst.","BeerManDan","Jan 10, 2003"
