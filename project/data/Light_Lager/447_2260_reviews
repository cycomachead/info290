"Even worse than the original."
"This Beer has a good rating by the bro's , and there right!"
"It's not bad, doesn't really taste like a light beer which is a plus. Doesn't taste as bad as regular old mil or god awful milwaukee's beast"

" Overall a 4 for the underdog known as Old Milwaukee Light - Pabst Brewing Company. Wish I woulda known ya sooner, you will be missed..."
"Old Milwaukee Light brewed by Pabst Brewing Company with an ABV 3.88. This brew pours out a nice light amber color with a small white head. This is a filtered brew you can see right though it. The smell is nice with some grains and malt. The taste is light, but rich. There is a lot going on in this brew. For being a light brew it has a lot of flavor and body. There is nothing overpowering in this brew. Old Milwaukee Light has a real nice balance it. The mouthfeel is nice, clean, and refreshing. Pabst Brewing Company did a nice job with this one. I would buy this brew again. Overall I'm giving this brew a 4.75 out 5."

"Nothing like a can of fresh toilet water to make your day shine but to be serious I have had many great times hanging with friends while drinking this beer so out of respect for old mil light and all the great times and memories I have been given I wanted to give this beer a good review."

"Overall – If you are looking for something light then this is your choice. It’s flavors are super mellow, it is very watery,highly drinkable, and decently refreshing."
"Now this is what Spelunky ordered... It pours a clear pale sallow topped by a finger of short-lived off-white foam. The nose comprises hard water, sweet corn, and light rice. The taste mirrors things nearly identically, though the hard water is definitely on display here. Yay. The body is quite light, with a moderate carbonation and a watery feel. Overall, if I were actually drinking this for the fun of it, I'd probably be even more unhappy than I am. This is best suited for quick alcohol-delivery systems, like beer pong or other drinking games. Sad."

"I tasted this beer and the flavor and taste are just awesome. But I search for light beer for my grandfather. I like its smell. Hope you can help me in my search ""lists"":http://www.ranker.com/crowdranked-list/the-best-tasting-light-beers ."

"D: This beer as about as bland as they come and as low of an ABV as you’ll find in a non-NA beer, but those traits also make the beer poundable, overall however there are several other inexpensive options out there that are better."
"Taste is light (no surprise) and watery. The only real flavor is a corny maltiness, and little (if any) hops presence. Maybe this one has won recent GABF awards, but it's still a typical American Adjunct lager. Average at best. Wouldn't buy again."

"Not going to take a typical review format with this one because there's not much to it... adjuncts, a light amount of hops, and some malted barley. In a great combination though. This is my go-to light beer. It's well balanced and actually offers hints of flavor compared to its competitors. Not tinny or metallic like lots of other beers of this caliber. Enjoyable for what it is."

"Taste, barely any, super miniscule hop presence, super miniscule malt presence, mostly corn and six row. A decent cheap alternative to keith stone, and better in my opinion. Same demographic its peddaled too. At least if you're a somewhat responsible adult, you can just call it a lawnmower beer."
"""America's best tasting beer"" well that's what is says on the can...World beer cup gold winner in 2008 for American style light lager...really it's a good light beer. Pours a fizzy yellow color, with white head that dwindles quickly. Flavor wise there isn't anything wrong with this beer, especially when served cold. Smell is some cooked veggies with even a hint of herbal hop notes, really vintage old school beer like this isn't bad compared to the masses it's just as good or better. Plus a 12 pack of this runs $6.49 since that is rediculously cheap, it's a bonus to this light lager. Mouthfeel is light bodied sturdy carbonation nothing exciting but it's cold and wet. Overall an affordable good beer that's good for beer geeks to try to appreciate what we have in craft beer and have an option amongst bigger brewers to justify not drinking BMC."
"A friend turned me onto this beer and I'm very glad he did. It is a step above other mass produced light lagers and is one of the best values out there."
"12 oz straight out of the can, although I've had it in a glass too. Slightly orange-water color. No smell. Clean. Not much in the taste, not much hops or malt. Goes down as easy as...well, as easy as water. Seriously one of the better light beers around."
"Overall this is THE best light beer I have ever had. I am not going to just rate this as a premium, or craft beer because it's unfair and fails the test. I reviewed this compared to others for what it is, a light beer. I can say that If I am ever in a light beer mood I will gladly seek and buy this one again."
"In conclusion, this makes you realize that light beer is not about an exotic blend of tastes, but clean and refreshing taste. This beer accomplishes that, for a light beer it's not bad. Still, it's a little to watery. I can foresee this being chugged at American frat houses."
"D - Had about four in really fast succession."
"Poured from a 12 oz. can. Has a very pale yellow color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is mild, some grains. Taste is very mild, really nothing here at all, a slight bitterness at the finish. Feels light in the mouth and has good drinkability. Overall this is a low quality beer."
"Overall: Old Milwaukee Light is the best light brew on the market. Why pay more, when you can get the best for less?"
"A finger of bone-white head that fell like the housing market. Color was a light straw-yellow with NE-quality clarity. Nose was lightly malty sweet with a cereal quality. Mouthfeel was thin with a light sweetness along with a slight cereal quality. Finish was thin, bland, unassuming. Fizzy yellow beer sucks (and a lot of it is in CANs)!"
"Pours a clear, pale yellow. 1/4inch head of a clear color with poor retention and no lacing. Smells of adjunct in a clean lager. Fits the style of a light lager. Has a smooth and crisp mouth feel. There's a high carbonation level present. Tastes of adjunct mostly with a strong lager characteristic. Slight malt background is noticeable in the aftertaste. Overall, another light lager which is definitely not my favorite style."
"The pour is pale yellow with little to no head but considerable carbonation that bubbles all through the session. The aroma is grassy and corny but if you take a deep enough whiff you might catch a little bit of hops. The mouthfeel is about average for a light macros but it doesn't seem quite as watered down. The taste also has some vague hops but little to no alcohol sensation. Actually it is not quite as bad as some of the previous reviewers have claimed."
"If you go into a can of it expecting it to taste like your favorite pale ale, well, you're not gonna like it. If you just want a refreshing, easy-drinking light lager that is light on the billfold, I think you've found your new beer."
"I went into this review not expecting much. Guess what I got in return... not much. A yellowish color under some fizzy river suds. Smells and taste like a hybrid between rice, corn and garbage water. Watery but fizzy body. Maybe someday I will find a light lager that does not give me bad dreams."
"this beer i have known since I was a child. I grew up with ti=his beer and I will die with tis beer. the taste is very good compares with other lagers in this field the drinkability is as always quick to down in an instant. The taste is very good in a premium lager. I reammend this beer to many others to try."
"I was given an Old Milwaukee Light at a get together when nothing else was available. This beer is pale in color, no foamy head, skunky and green both in taste and aroma. I don't think I got a bad can, I think this beer just flat out sucks. Who drinks this shit? This was so bad it gave me a headache. Cheaply made, by far the worst beer I have ever drank in my life."
"Pale gold with a head that goes away right away. This beer smells like Cheerios! It smells just like when you open a box of Cheerios and take a wiff. So I guess I could say OM Light has a cereal grain odor. It tastes OK for a cheap crappy light beer. Not too bitter or rancid. It's pretty easy to drink. It watery and thin and doesn't taste completely crappy therefore I say it's pretty drinkable. No terrible aftertaste either. I don't much care for this style of beer but for this style of beer, it's a pretty decent one. $5.99 12 pack... MSU football tailgater's friend."
"Old Milwaukee Light pours a light yellow color with a huge white head from a twelve ounce can. The aroma is sweet, and a bit of cereal grain, and if you take a big whiff you get musty which almost gives it an industrial like quality. This is a light, sweet flavored beer, tasting mostly of cereal grains but it finishes very clean. Better than I expected, and not bad for a beer in its style. The can says ""America's Best Tasting Beer"" I wouldn't go quite that far."
"Fairly refreshing, but nothing remarkable about the taste. Good for a warm day."
"D - Not great tasting, but easy drinking. Makes a good lawnmower beer."
""
"Drinkability - A little more character than many macro lights, but not a flavor I would return for. Gets a bump for being reeealll cheap and for referring to that queen of cities - Milwaukee."
"A refreshing light beer. With the low alcohol you could pound a number of these."
"With the pleasant aftertaste you may find yourself wanting more than 1 can of this stuff. Definately one of my top 3 light macro's if nothing else for lack of unpleasant aftertaste and presence of some flavor throughout. Go with OM regular if not calorie conscious for more flavor."
"Pours a thin, piss yellow body with zero head. Smells literally like musty sweat. Somehow, some way there is a decent amount of lacing. Taste is surprisingly not bad, a bit of bite at the start and no apparent aftertaste, but nothing special. Mouthfeel is what all light macros feel like: watery. Definitely easy to drink if you're looking for a beer with almost no taste or alcohol content, or something to funnel at a party."
"Usually hot day out here in Michigan. Time for a lighter beer. Might as well finish off this 30 pack I ""enjoyed"" while camping last weekend. Very light in color, slight head, nicely carbonated. Aroma is almost nothing, slightly grainy but rather clean. Taste is very clean, almost too clean. No off flavors, nice long smooth body but not much else. Great camping beer, not too good of a tasting beer. Not as flavorful as the Miller Lite I had before this one. Well made, just weak and unflavorful in the end."
"Final Thoughts: I remember when I was a senior in high school and got a job in the spring & summer in 1992 at the Husker CO-OP in Columbus, NE. (Anyone who has spent time on the farm will know what I'm talking about.) Every Friday was payday, and someone would run over to this little grocery store and pick up a case of this. The guys who worked there were all farmers or retired from farming, and in our area this is what the farmers drank (at the time, now its Busch Light). I would head up to the office to clock out and grab my paycheck and they'd always offer me a couple. I always said yeah, even though I didn't really like this stuff, but it always made me feel good, like the old guys repsected me enough to share their beer with. Aah good times, when things were simple. Just a random old beer memory."
"Not a bad light beer...pours a light gold....clear..highly carbonated appearance with a big ass fizzy white head...nose is light cooked cornbody is light but with a little substance...flavor is moderately sweet...slight maltiness evident....there is more to this than say Coors Light....No bad off flavors....finishes with a little dryness to it...really not bad at all...won a few honors as best tasting light beer and it doesn't shock me...I like a few others better but it's splitting hairs sometimes with the light beers and this one does not offend and actually has a small whiff of character.."
"A straight forward light version of it's full flavored brother. Watery taste with medium / light carbonation, and weak flavor of corn and hops. Not bad on a hot day, but there are many other brews i'd much rather have first. Overall not bad, but once again, nothing special."
"It was an old milwaukee that was my first beer when I was 15 years old, so when my buddy was drinking it last night, I asked him for a trip down memory lane. I drank it right out of the 12 oz. can. Smells was a little stale, with some corn and malt noticable. Taste was pretty watered down, not much in the hops department, or flavor department in general. This sample made me realize why I didn't make a point of having one of these in the past 6 years. Not that bad, but not many redeeming qualities, except it's price."
"It's not that bad, but it's also not that good. It's just there. There was nothing that stood out about this one, except the fact that it tastes like regular Bud, which is ok for a light beer. I'm definately not a Bud fan, but I would choose this over it, because it is the same thing at a fraction of the cost. It's a major beer here at Crabford... I mean Radford University. It's cheap and freshman chicks don't know the difference, so it's a frat boys best friend."
"Notes: This is what a light beer is supposed to be, If I was a light beer drinker this is the one I would go for time and time again."
"Not bad for a ""BAd Beer"""
"Very thin, pale straw, a thin sheet of a soapy head, that evaporates quickly. Some light malty aroma, tough to pick up much on the nose. Thin, weak and a watery body, noted consistently through a few of these. Some delicate malts detected throughout. Nothing offensive, yet nothing to reel you in for more."
"However, as well balanced it seems, it quickly stops. No lingering here..no personality either."
"This is a light version of a very cheap beer, so I wasn't expecting much. Pours with almost no head when ice cold. Taste is very weak and watered down. What taste you get is slight malted grain and only a very shadow of hops. A very poor example of a light beer."
"In conclusion, this beer actually reminds me of Schaefer Light, perhaps with a little less flavor. This beer is not outstanding in any way, but at the same time it doesn't offend my taste buds either."
"The last time I tasted this beer, it wasn't to bad. It had an average flavor and the taste was also average. Although, I was drinking this beer as I was playing horseshoes in 100 degree weather. At that time, I would say anything would have tasted good. Before then, I tried it once and have tasted worst."
"This actually wasnt a bad beer. If the folks who produce it could get rid of the egg smell and give it some color it would be a decent light beer. As it is right now its better than some because it is completely inoffensive."
"i have to admit to drinking this a lot in my college days....it was our house beer of choice and was priced right for a case of returnable bottles. after all these years, after sampling it again, i see it wasn't such a bad choice. of course it has the usual adjunct aroma and taste, but it's not obnoxious or offending. it actually tastes good and goes down smooth and easy. for light macro swill, one could do a lot worse. ah...the memories! but don't worry....i won't be drinking this again anytime soon! age and wisdom have taken over, and the beer world has opened up to me in ways i never dreamed of ten years ago."
"Tastes like regular Old Milwaukee after some ice cubes melted in it. Very clear color, absent of any hops that I could detect. I don't think they use any barley either. It is drinkable, but so is anti-freeze."
"Metallic.  This beer actually has a cold metal taste to it.  Very water and highly carbonated.  Not a good beer at all."
"Light pleasant malt aroma.  Full bubbly head that leaves rather quickly.  Pale straw color.  Very light on flavor from start through the finish.  No hop qualities.  Light and quick dry finish, that lacks crispness.  Mouthfeel very thin despite the full carbonation."
