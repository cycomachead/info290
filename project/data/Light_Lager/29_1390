As a light beer, it's not a beer I would recommend, stick with a PBR instead.","Metalbrew","Sep 21, 2014"

Believe it or not, in comparison the abominable Keystone Light is actually more drinkable (probably because of the smoothness.) I find most folks will drink this brew or Bud Light because Keystone or Hamm's or Natural Light is just a "trailer trash beer", when in fact they are all detestable in one way or another. Busch Light is not the worst light beer in the world, but it's not far from it. It is truly quite awful. Busch regular is a smooth,  palatable beer, and finishes great - but Busch LIGHT takes the fun out of it. It's like cooking noodles too long. Skip this one if at all possible and take the second step in beerdom - a full flavored macro like Busch regular or Coors Banquet.","The-Adjunct-Hippie","Aug 16, 2014"

This is one of the most basic and unremarkable beers I've yet to have, with a taste that's not revolting but not even half as satisfying as it could be. It's the kind of beer I'd buy if I was looking to have beer at the lowest possible cost, not particularly caring whether or not it was unique, but more along the lines of it being something to drink. The purpose of this beer is to be a cheap, economy beer with low alcohol content, meaning you can still work a six pack into your already tight budget. If that's what you want, you know who you are, but others have no reason to waste their time on beer flavored water.","SteveJeremy","Jul 22, 2014"

Anyway, this stuff pours a clear pale straw topped by a half-finger of short-lived off-white foam. The nose comprises stale barley, hard water, and astringent grass. The taste generally follows suit, with the hard water really taking over. The body is pretty light, with a light moderate carbonation and a watery feel. Overall, I knew what I was getting: a watery, light, mildly-fizzy alcohol delivery service. It's not very good at all, but I have still had much worse...","TMoney2591","Sep 07, 2013"

Taste is fizzy beer water but that is what most light beers remind me of. Light grain with just a kiss of herbal grassy hop bite at the back of the tongue. It has a crisp dry finish with bold carbonation.  Mouthfeel is light and resembles soda water.  An above average Summer swiller.  If you are alright with the A-B family flavors give this a try.  I think it is one of the better Light beers readily available. Great value too.","Spikester","Dec 22, 2012"

Poured a very light yellow color, produced a thin white head , retention was poor, and and left a small amount of lacing on the glass. The aroma consisted of corn, and nothing else. Light in body, this Light Lager is very clean, smooth, and thirst quenching. Probably would be a good Lawn Mower Beer. There is a slight trace of malted grain, some corn, very little hop flavor and it has somewhat of a dry finish. Overall, I guess it serves it purpose, a light mass produced lager that you don't have to think about. Poor marks for taste and everything else but mouthfeel. Save this one for the mother in-law.

Which in my opinion is a great deal. First, always drink from a can. Make sure very cold. Sure it smells of corn and grains but what beer of this type doesn't? It's taste is crisp and carbonated. Overall- this is my favorite "cheap" beer to drink. We all know what it is for, so let's embrace it for what it is. I honestly think there is worse, but i'm not drinking it to ponder its wonderful hoppy characters and unbelievable taste...i'm drinking it for the 30cans of unbridled joy with friends that i will have a hard time recalling in the morning.

Aroma is sweet malt and adjuncts, it doesn't smell bad at all. It's not exactly an appealing aroma, but it doesn't smell awful either. Taste is mostly like the aroma, it tastes like sweet malt, adjuncts, and has a bit of a vegetal taste too. Mouthfeel/body is light, it's actually a little bit slick, and it's also easy enough to drink. Moderate/high carbonation. Overall it's not great, but it's not horrible either.

With many macro light lagers, it's usually watered down and bland, but this one is watered down and follows with a sour, unpleasant after taste.

I would consider it a mid-range domestic brew. Its not so gross that you cant choke it down and its not so good that its going to cost you an arm and a leg just to get a buzz. I like to dip into nice expensive treat beers once in a while, but I always go back to good ole' Busch Light. The more often you drink it, the better it seems to get. Although it is quite watery and almost tasteless, around here its the cheapest way to knock back a few brews without gagging yourself with terrible beer.","jasonpeckins32","Feb 06, 2005"
