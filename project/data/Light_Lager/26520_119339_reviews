"A light grainy malt aroma. Solid pale yellow but with a slight haze. A quick bubbly white head but doesnâ€™t last long. Taste is slight grain and lemon zestiness in background. Has a light tart finish that is refreshing."

"Very easy to drink. Nothing earth shattering, but it's a well made lager."

"A very good example of a style most of us don't care for is still a very good beer.  Not a great beer, but a very good one."

"I really hate to write this.... truly I do, because this is an outstanding brewery that has produced dozens of beers that I have absolutely adored.... but this was not one of them.  I found it nearly tasteless fizzy water with a hop bitterness at the end... which didn't work, because it had nothing to balance it out.  If their goal was to brew a light ""American Style"" lager that tasted like the ones that the macro guys make, they nailed it."

"Like the aroma the taste leans more to the grainy side with a mild hop finish.  It was not bad all in all."

"I guess if you like thin 4.5% ABV beers you'll be okay. Many others brew it worse. Since I'm an Imperial drinker I'm probably way too harsh. Try it, you won't dump it, just lower your expectations if you're used to their better brews."

"Serves up a light yellow body and a nice foamy head. Smells of minerals, malt and some hops flowers. Very American Lager-y. Low carbonation. Overall, this beer is certainly best served cold. I had mine slightly warmer and didn't really like it. Had it on the cold side and found it refreshing. This has a definite American Lager flavor to it, so don't expect something similar to what the brewery typically puts out."

"Pale yellow with a bit of haze and a short-lived cap of bright white, soapy bubbles. Malt and cereal aroma, notes of herbal and slightly sulfury hops. Moderate bitterness that lingered, slight citrus up front followed by malt and grassy character -- pretty nice. Light-to-medium bodied, carbonation a little on the low side, some dryness. Overall, refreshing and nicely balanced. I liked it and am happy to have the rest of a 12-pack to go through."

"O: Not a super complex brew by any measure, but very well done for what it is. I'd be curious to try this side by side with Jabby Brau, as this seems very similar but with a reduced hop presence."
""
""
"Overall: Typical Jack's Abbey. Another solid and clean lager. Even though it is a light beer, it is still a bit heavier than most in the style. I will be getting more of this."
""
""
"O -- Again, I like it a lot."
""
"Overall meh, not one of their best IMO. It has some decent big doughy cracker straw like grains, mostly on the taste, hops are a bit on the too light side even for a light lager, the lagering portion also seems a bit off as it has that mild minerality note, not quite like a sulfur or phosphorus, but something there. Doesn't quite seem up to a typical Jack's Abby lager."
""
"Of particular note, though it doesn't influence my scoring, is that this beer costs about $11 a 12pk. This is basically a ""gateway beer"" from BMC to craft, but unlike other such beers, this one isn't really trying to push you toward anything else. Hard to find fault with this, and easy to imagine putting away quite a bit of it."
""
"O: It is what it is: Jack's Abby's answer to fizzy lite lagers. In that light it's actually pretty good. Just don't expect anything on the level of Hoponious Union. This is all about being a 12pk pounder. It's a bold decision for them, especially to go to market with volume in a 12pk format. This is a brewery that had still been bottling 500ml exclusively not even a year ago. I think they timed it perfectly though. They seem to be at a point where they can comfortably field the volume as long as demand doesn't soar. The red, white, and blue packaging will surely encourage some impulse buys and make for great display pieces as it goes to market around the Fourth of July. Next up: mix 12 pack? Might not be a bad choice."

"O - Overall, a solid lager. Shows was a lite BMC could really taste like. Well crafted beer from Jack's Abby as usual."
""
"O-Pretty well done. A high quality American Lager that is well made but goes nowhere the pushing any boundaries. Pretty neat through and through."

"On tap at the Jack's Abby Brewery. Very tasty American style lager for the price. It's brewed with all real ingredients, this means no corn, rice or other adjuncts. Good beer for drinking at bbqs or on the beach. Makes sense that they would brew an approachable lager considering it was brewed to raise money for the revitalization of downtown Framingham."
