"Blind taste test out of 7 AALs, this was easily the worst.  Metallic, watery, terrible finish."
"O: Only reason I gave it a 2 was because it is so cheap and widely available but everything else is poor at best."
"shouldn't even be able to be called beer."
""
""
"The worst thing I've ever put in my mouth. I'd rather drink piss. Even bud and coors are far better. And that's saying a lot"
"Taste great if u like water"
"Cons: You will need to drink all 30 of these before you get any kind of a buzz at all.  Hell, you can probably drink all 30 of them on the way home and not hit the legal limit. Then I question what's the point of drinking a light beer at all when one imperial stout has a fraction of the calories as 30 of these..."
"Not a good beer but its easy to drink and cheap and I find myself buying it often"
""
"Why are you reading Busch light reviews?"
"reminds me of high school"
"Better than Bud Light and cheaper. I find it refreshing and enjoyable."
""
""
""
"Looks great, but not a lot of taste but very drinkable and pretty much everyone will drink it."
""
"Pours a golden color with thick head thinning to a lace. Smells like fermented corn vomit. Goes down pretty smooth with surprisingly hoppy and bitter, and a little dry. Not bad overall. One of the better light beers."

"Buy this at the gas station. It isn't expensive, and still beats bud light in my blind taste test, buddy gave me both of them. Ice cold this is really refreshing. goes down like water.  I see all the ones and twos on here, and i kind of wonder what its being compared to. The price is right and when you go fishing or are at a barbeque its really good for those occasions."

"Although it will never win a taste contest, based on its ""crispness"" this one's a staple in my beer diet."
"Ah, the ignorance of childhood. I remember my friend's mom used to buy this in bulk for us when I was in High School. Didn't care then. Just wanted to get drunk. Nowadays, you would not get me drinking this no matter how many other beers I've already had. The slightest taste of watery piss swill makes me nauseous now. Whether it's Natty, Keystone or this A-B abomination doesn't matter. Save your money for half decent beer. Leave this for frat houses and shitty moms to buy for their kids and their friends."

"Had this one at a BBQ as this was the only choice available. Busch Light is a horrible beer that has no flavor whatsoever. The beer pours a light yellow, and it has barely any head. Busch is one of those beers that isn't worth trying as the taste is very watery, having a glass of water afterwards, you wouldn't even tell the difference. As a light beer, it's not a beer I would recommend, stick with a PBR instead."

"Good college party beer. Doesn't have a stand out taste. I'll only drink this from a keg at a college party."

"Overall (2) - I've had worse - but man, I've sure had better. Believe it or not, in comparison the abominable Keystone Light is actually more drinkable (probably because of the smoothness.) I find most folks will drink this brew or Bud Light because Keystone or Hamm's or Natural Light is just a ""trailer trash beer", when in fact they are all detestable in one way or another. Busch Light is not the worst light beer in the world, but it's not far from it. It is truly quite awful. Busch regular is a smooth,  palatable beer, and finishes great - but Busch LIGHT takes the fun out of it. It's like cooking noodles too long. Skip this one if at all possible and take the second step in beerdom - a full flavored macro like Busch regular or Coors Banquet."

"If you're not going to session Busch Light on a lazy afternoon, or during a relatively inexpensive cookout, I don't see why you'd drink it at all. This is one of the most basic and unremarkable beers I've yet to have, with a taste that's not revolting but not even half as satisfying as it could be. It's the kind of beer I'd buy if I was looking to have beer at the lowest possible cost, not particularly caring whether or not it was unique, but more along the lines of it being something to drink. The purpose of this beer is to be a cheap, economy beer with low alcohol content, meaning you can still work a six pack into your already tight budget. If that's what you want, you know who you are, but others have no reason to waste their time on beer flavored water."

"Pours a very clear straw-yellow in color with a very think white head. Some spotty lacing was seen. The aroma isn't too much, just for some corn and maybe some rice and grains. Above average carbonation that is the normal for most Bud products. The taste is slightly sweet with a strange light metallic taste similar to Michelob Ultra. Pretty bland overall and nothing real exciting. Overall, below average."

"Small head making the beer very easy to drink. In essence you get what you pay for. It has a a watery taste characteristic of cheap beers. Only drink it as a last resort. Very little smell at all. Make sure it's ice cold - a beer much more prevalent on college campuses."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Best drank cold and is a very easy beer to drink in a sense. Not a great beer because there isnt a whole lot to it, very little smell or taste. As a college student it is very popular amongst my peers probably because of the price and how light and easy it is to drink. Once I am out of college I do not think I will drink very many more of these."

"Busch Light is a Light Beer Made by Anheuser Busch. 4.2 abv. This beer taste like water. Light Amber color. Not much of a head to this beer. Natural Light and Busch have a much better taste to them. I will drink this beer if there is nothing else to drink."

"O - I can see it being very easy to blast a case of this stuff on a hot day since it is closer to water for rehydration than beer. I did like the Ice Cold Easy"" indicator on the can and recommend anyone drinking this stuff to make sure it is as close to freezing as possible,"

"truly inferior beer, even for budget crap. offensive yellow soda water that tastes more like licking a battery than anything containing grain or hops. extract all the way here, I just don't taste any grain at all, none. metallic in the finish, more aluminum than I care to taste. its only asset (if you can call it that), is its refreshment capacity. when its freezing cold, a good chug can quench a thirst. this is so because the beer has essentially no flavor, so like a massively carbonated water. I don't mind a regular busch, but this low cal offering is brutal, even as the 30 pack stuff goes."

"My go-to beer in high school, thankfully not my go-to beer now."
"Besides that though, its still a bad beer. If your looking to buy a beer to enjoy by yourself or with other people in a non-college party environment, I would pick pretty much anything else before I pick this."

"Killing time before my arms control class, I just couldn't resist ordering one of these. I have no idea why. Anyway, this stuff pours a clear pale straw topped by a half-finger of short-lived off-white foam. The nose comprises stale barley, hard water, and astringent grass. The taste generally follows suit, with the hard water really taking over. The body is pretty light, with a light moderate carbonation and a watery feel. Overall, I knew what I was getting: a watery, light, mildly-fizzy alcohol delivery service. It's not very good at all, but I have still had much worse..."

"This beer is pretty watery looking. When you actually drink it you aren't suprised. it's about as thick and smooth as water. But it does have a hint of beer lol. It does have a slightly grainy smell. This is a pretty common cheap college party beer so what do you expect?"

"D - This is a very poor light lager... A notch down from the typical BMC offerings... Not something I think I would ever find reason to drink again even at bachelor parties, tailgating or mowing the lawn..."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Not good at all. Busch original is probably as light of a beer as I would drink, but at least I have another ""had"" under my belt. If cold enough, it is only a slightly slightly better alternative than water for a grass cutting day."

""

"The old reliable college beer. As far as cheap domestic beers go, this is probably the best. It's better than Ice House, Keystone and the like. It has a clear yellow appearance with little to no head. Tastes metallic and watered down. Goes down without much resistance. Great for beer bongs, if you're in college and into that type of thing. If you're above the age of 25, you should not be drinking this beer."

"Overall, this Light beer has actually got a bit of flavor to it. Unfortunately, the flavor isn't quite beer, as there is no real malt or hop character to be found."

"Overall Dear GOD avoid if you can this beer has gained some interest in my brother but it's not a good step up from natural ice. Not one bit."

"This is not a craft.. For a light beer, and price the taste is not bad. I like it. Crisp and light beer. You can get buzz half the price of miller light and coors light. This is a good beer on budget. Nothing offensive about it All lithe beer drinkers should try it would save you some money."
""

"Overall- Well its bland, but nothing off putting about it. It's almost like carbonated water. I really get almost no flavor from it. For just getting drunk it works well, at least I get drunk and don't have to cringe with each drink. This beer has a time and place."

"Busch Light is a classic, easy drinking, and low priced beer(<$18 a 30 pk in KY). Similar to other anheuser busch products in drinkability. I was amused by the ""Ice Cold Easy Indicator"" thermometer graphic on the can that changes color when cold. It does go down a bit harder than expected, just to be honest. Cheers!"

"I was not very fond of Busch Light, but it is a cheap beer for any college student. The taste of the beer was average, while the smell was below average. Overall the average and below average characteristics of the beer made it a below average beer in my opinion. It is not one that I would buy."

"I used to go to a now defunct pizza joint in Greenville, n.c., they had this on tap, warm for $1/pitcher. No flavor, no nothing. I am no aficionado, but this is the beer of college students and people who hate their kidneys. Avoid at all costs, please."

"There is much better stuff out there though."

"Smell is mild grains some earthy hops. Really don't smell the corn everyone refers to. This was a very fresh can. Less than a month from canning date. Taste is fizzy beer water but that is what most light beers remind me of. Light grain with just a kiss of herbal grassy hop bite at the back of the tongue. It has a crisp dry finish with bold carbonation.  Mouthfeel is light and resembles soda water.  An above average Summer swiller.  If you are alright with the A-B family flavors give this a try.  I think it is one of the better Light beers readily available. Great value too."

"Poured this 12 oz can into a pint glass. Poured a very light yellow color, produced a thin white head , retention was poor, and and left a small amount of lacing on the glass. The aroma consisted of corn, and nothing else. Light in body, this Light Lager is very clean, smooth, and thirst quenching. Probably would be a good Lawn Mower Beer. There is a slight trace of malted grain, some corn, very little hop flavor and it has somewhat of a dry finish. Overall, I guess it serves it purpose, a light mass produced lager that you don't have to think about. Poor marks for taste and everything else but mouthfeel. Save this one for the mother in-law. Prost.!"

"Had this at an anniversary party very far from home. The only options were this and Keystone light. Like a good beer advocate, I tried both. This was an extra tall 16oz can, but as the sun shone from above, I could clearly see to the bottom of the can as soon as I opened it. I knew I was in for an experience. This beer smelled as close to nothing as you can get. The taste was beneath thin, and it all but evaporated in your mouth. If you want to get drunk, but not in a hurry, then this beer is for you. Otherwise, steer clear. Not recommended"

"OK, everyone that really loves beer goes for an IPA, ESB, etc. This beer is cheap, yes. But it is also low carb. People with blood sugar issues (like me) still want to drink beer. What to do? Once you get used to this style, it's OK. Grab a Pale Ale when out on the town. This, for me, is everyday."

"Overall – Even for a “light” beer this one is on the lower side of the rating scale. Very little flavor, super weak body and nothing else to offer make this brew one to pass over."
"I take this beer as it is..this is for nights with friends where you are expecting to drink more than half of the 30 pack you bought for $16. Which in my opinion is a great deal. First, always drink from a can. Make sure very cold. Sure it smells of corn and grains but what beer of this type doesn't? It's taste is crisp and carbonated. Overall- this is my favorite ""cheap"" beer to drink. We all know what it is for, so let's embrace it for what it is. I honestly think there is worse, but i'm not drinking it to ponder its wonderful hoppy characters and unbelievable taste...i'm drinking it for the 30cans of unbridled joy with friends that i will have a hard time recalling in the morning. Cheers!"

"Overall - You get what you pay for man. This is a cheap beer even for the style. Good for beer bongs, drinking games, frat parties, etc."
"Taste? Not much. The stale malt is more old socksy and the corn is underneath. I'd think this is sock flavored water. Fizzy. This does not taste like beer. Not even close, but it does match the category a bit."
""
""
""
""
"Not much of an appearance with about a 1"" head that quickly disappears. Smells like watered down...water beer. Taste like a normal american pilsner which lacks much flavor or imagination. Really crisp and tastes pretty much how it smells and looks. Let's face it, this is a drinking game beer so leave it for the tailgates or beer pong. Unless of course it's free, then the ""free beer"" rule applies. of all the beers, this is the one that I consumed the most while in college. I'll even pick up a dirty thirty for a beer pong competition....but those are few and far between. Don't judge me."

"Final Grade: 2.37, an unimpressive D+. Acceptable in a pinch if you need a cheap light beer. The lack of quality shows, but served ice cold this is certainly not the worst of its kind. I like Bud Light marginally more, but using 'like' in a statement like that makes it seem inherently ludicrous."

""
""
""
"This is probably the worst beer I’ve ever had, ever will have, and it should never be made, bought, or tasted by anyone again except we should give it to child molesters and rapists to drink as punishment. There is nothing here. It is a quasi-beer, a fake, a pseudo, almost non-alcoholic. IT IS A FRAUD I TELL YOU! Don’t drink this, unless you enjoy the taste of cat piss!"
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O - The drinkability is pretty much that of corny sweet water. It goes down easy, but the flavor isn't the best. It's just like watered down beer. It's not offensive, but it isn't good either."
""
""
""
""
""

"In summary Busch Light= Pisswater"
""
"For the style, this isn't bad. I could drink this. The taste doesn't have that awful metallic taste that macros often have, and there's enough bitterness here to let the palate know it's beer."
"M- Thin mouthfeel...even the carbonation is on the weak side."
""
""
""
"If you want a cheap light lager, go to keystone light, miller light, or even bud light. Avoid this one as well as Coors light. Sorry thats just as blunt as you have to be about these two. Avoid Busch light."
""
""
""
"Overall drinkability - Best chilled and about 2 seconds after being poured. Probably best just to drink this straight from the can to preserve the ethereal carbonation."

"Pours a fizzy yellow straw color, plume of froth gone quickly. Scent is muted and contains little in the way of anything... maybe a splash of corn and mustyness. Taste again is pale and clean, only note appears to be the adjunct taste of faintly sweet corn and some mineral like qualities. Light, fizzy, watery and lacking crispness. Another BMC light product that I would have a hard time distinguishing from anything else."
"Overall - Very easy, cheap drinker but some lingering weird aftertaste makes it not quite as refreshing as other macros."
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability - For some reason, I decided that I just had to try this. Never again. What an awful beer. ZERO lager characteristics, let alone beer properties in general."
"For this beer I wish there was a 6th scoring category, Ability to Drink 18. If that was a way to give this beer points I would have assuredly given it a 5. There is nothing to this beer. It is low on flavor and appeal, but I sure can put a ridiculous amount of these away."
"Easy drinking light beer indeed. I'm not sure if I've ever come across a beer that tasted so close to water. If you're looking to drink a bunch of beers really quickly without any pesky flavors to get in your way, this may be the best route."
"Not too hard to drink, not too hard at all, if you need a palate (and maybe a soul) cleanser, that is. Not much to say otherwise, not too much at all. Ok, ok - light macro-lager 101 (auditing, only - this crap could never make it to school - oh, wait, it does - stupid college kids)."
"24 ounce can, ""born on date"" of July 8, 2011. The ""Ice Cold Easy"" indicator on the can is still blue, so it must be good to drink right now! Served in a nonic pint glass, the beer pours a clear straw gold color with about an inch white head that went away quickly. Good amount of lacing left on the glass. Aroma is sweet malt and adjuncts, it doesn't smell bad at all. It's not exactly an appealing aroma, but it doesn't smell awful either. Taste is mostly like the aroma, it tastes like sweet malt, adjuncts, and has a bit of a vegetal taste too. Mouthfeel/body is light, it's actually a little bit slick, and it's also easy enough to drink. Moderate/high carbonation. Overall it's not great, but it's not horrible either. For $1.49 a can, I can't complain. I wouldn't make a point to buy this, but I've had worse. For the style of beer this is, it's not bad."
" That said, this one would certain rank closely behind Miller light and for 25% less. Should be drank ice cold, when extremely thristy for best results."
"Drinkability – Overall this is a refreshing example of the style that doesn’t offend."
"Give it a chance. If you don't like it don't drink it."
"This is a cheap beer and for a reason. It tastes like a glass of water would taste if say, you bumped into someone who was holding a beer and a couple drops of their beer fell into your glass of water. Not much taste to it at all, but i will say it was refreshing... because yea, water is suppose to be refreshing. But when u can get 32 cans for $10, you can not expect too much, plus its not marketed as a high quality beer, its a typical college/high school part beer, because u get a lot for a little."
"It's meant for heavy drinking at parties, not for flavor, but the flavor that is there is not offensive."
"I really don't know how people can drink this junk. It is so flavorless and unenjoyable. Even at a low price, what's the point?"
"In judging this remember, this is not a craft beer. This is a beer that tastes mighty good after a long hard day working in the heat. For a light beer, the taste is refreshing, crisp, and enjoyable. The appearance, smell, and mouthfeel are average for beers of its type."
"I'm not particularly fond of light beers, but sometimes I just want something smooth and refreshing, so judging this against other light beers, it has a crisp, clean taste, is very drinkable, and is not offensive in any way. I do have to wonder what other reviewers are comparing it to when rating it so low. It is not a flavorful craft beer nor is it intended to be. I will probably keep a few in my fridge for when I am thirsty and want something light and refreshing on a hot summer day."
"O - this beer can be had in bunches and sometimes drinking a beer in bunches is good."
"I imagine it's easy to chug because you just want it to go away as fast as possible, even if that means chugging it down to get rid of it. It tastes like other light beers, basically, like a nasty frat party."
"D: Not very flavorful, goes down ok since there isn’t much to it, not filling at all, very mild kick, not the absolute worst in the style but there isn’t much good to say about it either."
"D: AAAHhhh Humbug."
"Don't even mess around with stuff. There are better light beers and there are better cheap beers if that is what you are into."
"This was the first beer I remember drinking. Of course I had sips of other beers from my parents, but this was the first full beer I consumed. So I had to try it again and rate it. The color is golden clear with decent carbonation. The smell and taste are grainy. the mouthfeel is perfect for bonging. Its a college beer!"
"Possibly the worst beer every made. It is probably some where around 99 percent water and 1 percent alcohol. Every time you drink this beer it is insanely overpowered by carbonation and bad taste. This beers only purpose in life is to get brain-dead high school and college kids drunk. It is truly a headache in a can."
"O- I only drank it because it was the only beer available, and I regret that. Any mildly sophisticated beer drinker will gag on this piss-water."
"Beer is thin, no aftertaste at least, almost no flavor, what is there is very bland and boring, mildly sweet, boiled corn and cabbage in the midpalate, overall not as much a beer as it is an experiment in making a flavorless suspension of biomolecules. SUCCESS!"
"O: It's a beer, plain and simple, no frills, no thrills, just a fairly inexpensive cookout beer, there are way better choices, but if you happen to have some on hand it's drinkable."
"Overall, I will dirnk this again. Like it much more that Miller Lite."
"its funny i used to choke this down all the time in highschool thank god i discovered great beer!"
"This is a really poor beer. Very little of anything going on in this. I was handed a can at a friends party and i tried it because I didn't want to be a jerk. I had a few beers before this one that were quite good and I felt like this had nothing in it. I couldn't pick up real strong tasting notes or aromas. Still don't get how people crave this stuff..."
"D-Very watery and bland, so easily drunk if one merely wants to get intoxicated"
"Would drain pour this, but I fear for what might crawl back out of the drain in the middle of the night. A can of wasabi-coated peas should remove the aftertaste from my mouth. Maybe."
"RJT"
"Pours a pale yellow color, some carbonation, little fizzy white head, with minimal sticky lacing left behind. The nose is ricy, with a hint of malt. The taste is kinda sweet, ricy. Light Body. Not Drinkable, another dissappointment from the big three."
"D - It's a cheap light beer. You can drink it all day long."
"Drinkability: This isn't something someone should have to drink."
"D - I think this beer is great if you want to drink 20 in an evening. This is a very easy to drink beer and if you're going for volume, the price is right too!"
"Just a finger of white dense foam head. Not a lot of lasting power. Lace not much better than the head, and slides down the glass. Color is a 3 on the SRM chart. Smell, that of wet corn and wheat. Taste, not much better than the smell: corn, wheat, some rice, very little hop or malt. Water with a dull taste in my mouth. I think I would rather eat my hedge than drink another one of these. Stay away unless you have already consumed your fill of good beer."
"D: Could I be more productive with this review? Doubt it. Never, ever pick up this faux malted beverage."
"This is another beer to mow and play golf with. It is good for that at least. I usually have this in cans when i do have it and it tastes fine smells ok drinks well, and is cheap and easy to find. It is like the rest of these mass produced beers. I would drink it again."
"D- Drinkable like water. Could down these all day if you don't like flavor."
"Will take almost any other cheap beer over this one."
"Overall- It's unlikely that I'll ever purchase this again for actual consumption, though i might consider buying it to give to one of my fellow BA's as a joke."
"As far as light beer goes, this actually isn't bad. Little aftertaste, not bitter or skunky, when ice-cold quenches your thirst (I usually have it after playing hockey) and cheap. Think of it as excess Bud Light which AB couldn't label as being BL, like Keystone Light is excess Coors Light."
"I bought this beer primarily to use as a ""ringer"" in helping me perfect a Black and Tan...a pale comparison to the traditional lagers used, but it should help me eliminate some darker beers for Black and Tan use, i.e. if you can't make a Black and Tan with Busch Light, it won't be any use with better lagers."
"Mouthfeel / Drinkability: Light and watery thin body. I think Kallista Flockheart has more back than this beer. The carbonation was as I suspected abrasive and just not good. In short skip this one and go to another beer. This is beer for people who dont like beer."
"fizzy and fairless tasteless, and takes probably at least double the amount of beer than normal to catch any kind of buzz. on a positive note, i could see slamming a few after mowing the lawn on a 90+ degree day or scraping together my last few coins for a beer on the bus en route to a NFL game or other sporting event. One other positive, not all that much different from bud light for a lot less dough, if that's your thing."
"D: While this was the winner of the evening, this was a Dairy Challenge situation (where there are no winners). I don't think I'll be rushing out to buy any more Busch Light."
"d- it goes down no problem which makes this just another beer for getting hammered quick and cheap"
"Pours a light straw color with a soapy white head and no lacing. Smells of corn, syrup, and some grain notes hiding in there. Tastes of grain, corn, some malty sweetness and a little hop bitterness. Mouthfeel is less than average and is very thin and watery. Drinkability is decent."
"Pours with a bit of color and leaves the tiniest white head. Smells like weak amount of grain--a covered silo from a few miles away. Tastes like a bit of grain but mostly husk. Flavor is almost immediately washed away by the excess carbonation. It's like they don't want you to taste it. Unusual. Drinks like carbonated water with some cardboard and old rice."
"Pours a pale straw yellow with a finger of fluffy white head (yes, I dirtied a glass for this.) Smell is similar to most adjunt lagers; ie. Sweet corn. Taste is pretty blasé. However, I'm not going to berate this beer. It's not trying to be a top 100 (or 1000 for that matter) beer. It's easy drinking and mixes well with Clamato when I don't have Straub or Rolling Rock in the fridge. I've knocked back quite a few of these this evening and really have nothing bad to say. Clean finish and easy drinking. It is what it is."
" It's not gonna win any awards for flavor, but it goes down easy and it's definitely not drain pour. It's on the sweet side, but not bad for a cheap, light beer."
"Think of Bud Light. Now take away anything you might attribute to it in a positive light. Now double all the negatives. Add a little weasel piss and you have Busch Light."
"This poured a yellow color with some white head. It practically has no smell, maybe some grain. Tastes like a watered-down lager with a little flavor here and there. It is light-bodied as per the style with plenty of carbonation. All that said, this brew goes down easy! This is the most drinkable beer I've had. It is actually refreshing at times, especially after doing yard work."
"Looks and smells like any other light lager. Not scoring it lower than 2 because I've seen/smelled things that are truly awful, and this is just weak and unremarkable. Straw yellow with a smell of stale grain. The taste is stale grain and seltzery effervescence. At least it's highly drinkable."
"Not a lot of taste but good when you have been doing hot manual labor on a summer day."
"Busch Light is really cheap and easy to drink (especially with your G-Pa), but it is super light and there isn't a whole lotta flavor."
"what can i say about this beer other then its bad, it doesnt have any real good flavor or taste to it and has a rather bad after taste, it is very light mouth feel but the taste make this a hard beer to drink other then when your wasted or cant taste anything anymore"
"D-Real cheap; if you're trying to forget your night get a lot of these and imbibe rapidly."
"My wife and I have decided to lose a few pounds so we have started doing blind taste test to find a light beer that has a little flavor. First off I will not drink beer out of a can, so we lined up our first 3 competitors, Busch light , Rolling Rock Light and Michelob Golden draft Light all in bottles. To our surprise The Busch light was the only light beer that had flavor all the way down. the other 2 were good up front but then turned watery. For a light beer this is so far the one we will buy, I do like Sam Adams light, and will save that one for special occasions , but for now Busch light will continue to be the one we will taste test against."
"D- this is for chugging and pounding and nothing more. Thing is...you could drink them quite easily. I wouldn't, though"
"Overall these are all mostly the same in my mind, just one pale lager after another."
"You remove the socio-cultural baggage and what's left is a subpar macro. It's got a little bit of a Hamm-sy sourness, and since the rest of the beer is bereft of everything that sourness almost passes for character. There's nothing particularly offputting, aside from the aftertaste of sourslime. But if you're drinking this you are probably getting shitfaced so whatever, this will be only the 3rd or 4th most disgusting thing that will enter your mouth that evening."
"Really just an awful, cheap beer. Belongs as a 30 rack on the pong table. Nothing impressive, watery taste, odd carbonation. Definitely not a beer that anyone should ever be happy drinking. Having a hard time even finding enough to fill up 250 words worth."
"Fresh crisp mouthfeel. Hardly any taste to speak of, same with aroma. Head disappears quickly. Not much to say about this beer, except that it may be the perfection of economy in corporate beermaking. Just enough presence to reassure you that yes, that is beer in your glass."
"D - for the price, this is a decent light beer. It definitely compares to more expensive counter parts. A great all day beer for hot summer days."
"This just isn't a beer I want to drink--- but this is the style. These aren't supposed to taste good as much as they are designed to be consumed in mass quantities."
"Not a good beer. Don't bother."
"note: I'll continue to give bitter and skunky beers their entitled review because one bad feature does not ruin a beer and i think a lot of people on this thread may have forgot that. This is also a clear indication that people are offended by it's ""dirty 30"" mentality. Lord knows I was but as my love for beer grew, I gave this one a try to cut back costs and I was quite highly surprised"
"It comes out to a 'D' grade, but it is what it is. Cheap summer beer."
"D- This isn't good. Not ever for a light lager. Just didn't work for me."
"Drinkability: Ahhhh... how they have nailed a perfectly drinkable beer is beyond me. I could play King's cup/Beer Pong/Asshole all night long with this beer. Truly in a class of it's own."
"Pours a clear pale yellow with a small white head. I could not detect any aromas. Taste is very light a hint of sickly sweetness likely from the alcohol. No detectable hop flavor or bitterness. Mouthfeel was weak, bland and watery, medium carbonation. Drinkability was better, the lack of flavor and waterline characteristics helped. A much better value than the ""premium"" light beer brands though, similar taste at a lower price. Though I had this at a party so I did not purchase it"
"I would rather go for a beer with taste but for 16 bucks a 30 rack you can't go wrong with busch light. Its cheap and drinkable, 2 great qualities in a beer for a college student."
"It's light, it's extremely drinkable and doesn't have a heavy feel."
"Avoid."
"Overall: Better than the aforementioned Natty and Keystone, but not by much."
"Taste, a little sweet corn syrup feel. A few hops may have fallen into a 5000bbl batch. Kinda crisp. Mouthfeel, yeah. Not much. Could be used to probably rehydrate someone. Alcohol is low enough you can drink a ton of these and brag about it, not realizing you're bragging about drinking crappy diet beer w/o much alcohol."
"Fuck this beer."
"Overall, it's not a good beer at all. It's still beer, and it's not overly offensive, so if you are looking to get drunk cheaply it's a good option. If you are looking for a good beer, definitely look elsewhere."
"Yellowish straw body, one finger uneven head, ultra-quick dissipation with no lacing. The smell reaks of adjuncts, corn, corn syrup, no hop presence. The taste is cloyingly sweet, especially for a 'light' beer, no hops and very little malts. Some carbonation in mouthfeel, but can't get over the sweetish off-taste. Pretty drinkable at this ABV. I guess I learned a lesson today-bring your own beer to drink after games. Life is too short to drink this unless you are cost-challenged. Avoid at all costs."
"Appearance is light straw yellow with minimal head and no lace. Smell is clean with a light corn aroma. Taste of corn with a metallic bitterness coming after, pretty watered down. Mouthfeel is light with lots of carbonation. It's not terrible, I can see drinking a few of these on a light weekend."
"Hey, this water could almost be confused for light beer! It poured a very light yellow with next to no head. Also next to no smell or taste, just a hint of old corn. Very pleasant. At least you can drink a couple of cases of it without noticing, I guess that's a plus if you're into that kind of thing."
"Cheers!"
"Overall, Busch Light is a remarkably inferior beer that must require superhuman efforts on the part of its brewers to keep the flavor out of the beer. If you are looking for a good substitute to water, this is your beer."
"D: I am a college student and understand that we as students beer has to be spent on a budget. Anheuser-Busch did a great job in developing a beer to fit the budget, but I would prefer another beer."
"Low priced beer. Low end on the taste spectrum. It does it's job of supplying poor college students copious amounts of beer. But after you get out of college why would you wanna drink it anymore? The true college beer is this. Nothing like gettin a dirty 30 for the weekend."
"Notes: Not bad for the extremely low end of beer, but that is what it is, a low end beer."
"Poured from a 12 oz. can. Has a very pale yellow color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is very mild, maybe some notes of corn there. Taste is crisp, mild, some corn and malts. Feels watery in the mouth. Very drinkable, a good beer for a round or to of drinking games. Overall not the worst light beer I have had, but nothing great."
"Mouthfeel is almost like water with a hint of carbonation towards the end of each sip. The drinkability is the best feature of this brew. Although there isn't a lot of taste or desirability, it is easy to drink because of the limited features."
"Drinkability: Ok, it's drinkable, but that's really the only redeeming quality. I'll drink this at parties to get drunk, but as far as drinking beer for the enjoyment of it, even Bud Light would be a better choice."
"Drinkability: I guess in the strict sense of the word these are very drinkable. In a party atmosphere, I could pound tons of these and not even notice. Nevertheless, this is a tasteless, offensive beer in every sense and understanding of the words. I actually find this more offensive than the standard BMC light beers (Bud, Coors, and Miller Lites) and even worse than Natty Light. Man, this is bad..."
"Mouthfeel, couldnt be much lighter. Brother to water."
"I'm glad to report that Busch Light isn't bad enough to spit out. A step above Natural Light, if that means anything. But unfortunately, there's nothing really to taste in this beer."
"Nearly flavorless beer. Honestly I have a cousin who punishes me with this beer every time I don't come prepared. I know it's my fault, but it's hilarious stuff. I'll drink anything, but this is bad beer."
"D: The Busch lineup for me is certainly better than the mainstay brands of Bud and Bud Light. For this cheap a price point it's servicable and could be drinkable in large amounts. I expected this to be a lot worse than it actually turned out to be."
"D- not hard to kick back, it's perfect for beer pong and tastes nearly identical to it's famous cousin Bud Light. Serve ice-cold or not at all."
"A great tasting cheap beer if you add a dash of salt, especially to get that fizz to bring-out more flavor, that's all you have to do. With the little salt, I think it tastes way better than it's pricey cousin, the ""Michelob Ultra."" All cheap beers seem to have more corn taste, but, buy cheap, save $$$ and add the little salt or lime. Hope this helps some of the cheap beer drinkers out there, like myself. Have fun beer-lovers!!!"
"Ah, Busch Light. There isn't much to say about this weak beer. There is virtually no flavor at all. I've had a few of this on special at a local bar recently, and they might have been the lightest beers I ever had. Someone asked me how it was and the only way I could think to describe it: ""Well, it's cold."" That's what you get, a very cold and tasteless beer."
"As the beer warmed the flavor of corn emerged more strongly. This perhaps solves the enigma of why people drink gallons of this stuff. You must drink this quickly before it warms or you are in trouble. If it is ice cold, there isn't much flavor, either good or bad."
"D: Can drink a ton of it but who would want to?"
"O: I actually graded this blind (before looking at other reviews) and laughed when I saw that I actually scored the beer significantly higher than the average. I must be too kind."
"May lead to vomiting. Very reasonable in terms of price though!"
"mmm.never forget your roots. really tasty beer. no taste or flavor tastes like corn almost. really dry. as stone would say its a yellow fizzy beer. good when low on funds. gets the job done as far as just having a couple of brews. price is good. 2 for 2.29 great deal. various sizes available wish it was on tap."
"It breaks my heart to trash this beer. It serves its purpose as a general get drunk on the cheap beverage and I love it for that. However, it just can't stand up to real beer (or bier for that matter). No matter how unpalatable, Busch Light will always hold a special place in my heart."
"I am not impressed."
"Nota Bene: This is a beer that is very close to my heart. At $13 per 30 pack, a can of Busch Light is literally cheaper than a can of coca-cola. As such, this was the beer of choice for my college campus so Ive probably drank dozens of gallons of this stuff. As long as you remember what it is for, it does its job admirably. Although it reminds me of the millions of ignorant americans who have to unknowingly suffer through terrible beer. Is that bad beer karma? Maybe, but once one has tasted a perfectly crafted micro beer, one sees things a little differently...Once pandoras box has been opened, its impossible to go back"
"Drinkability: Not good at all. This might work for beer pong or something, but that's it."
"There is nothing wrong with this beer on a hot day, I actually tend to reach for it. A thick, chocolately stout type beer has no place in that kind of situation. Even just relaxing at home or with any given bread-based meal, this beer does with it perfectly. I'm giving this review a higher rating for the reason that it is actually one of the better tasting light beers I have tasted, and I have tried many. For the category (Canadian Light Lager), this beer deserves more respect than it gets in my opinion. True, it is like a fizzy water, but when cold...you'd be hard pressed to find a beer that is more satisfying to quench your thirst."
"D- I could drink these all night if I was in college and had no tastebud, basically anything you get is better than this. Please move along and try something new."
"This is the first time I have gotten something for free and ended up feeling I overpaid."
"MF/D: Too carbonated for me, super light in body, metallic/sweet corn finish."
"Serving type: can"
"A finger of bone-white head with decent retention on a humid afternoon. Color was a pale, straw-yellow with NE-quality clarity. Nose was horrid - it smelled like cooked vegetables! I know that this is generally considered a failing in beer although some have intentionally kept it in, but I do not think that this was by design. Mouthfeel was thin with a cereal sweetness on the tongue. Once again, these macro Lights seem nearly indistinguishable from one another. Finish was light and watery. Hell, I could have drank water instead and not noticed much of a difference."
"T/M - The mouthfeel was thin and watery, which made for super quick consumption but not great drinkability. The taste was ever so slightly hopped and ever so slightly malted. It was weak overall."
"D - For me, this is a non-starter. Pabst cost the same or less and is more satisfying. Maybe buy this for th 'I hate beer' girls at the frat party, but anyone who truly appreciates beer should stay far away."
"Drinkability - This is definitely a beer to see how much you can put down."
"This is yet another piss beer that college students buy for the sole fact that it is dirt cheap and has alcohol in it. I feel ashamed when I drink this because that means that the other team in beirut is winning. The only thing that this beer has going for it is that you can drink a lot of them. It is very drinkable. I don't like to but you can."
"Not as horrible as i expected , but still pretty bad."
"mouthfeel was basically watered down, with no real feel very drinkable. for the price it is a good session beer and if you are down on money"
"I poured into a pint glass to no head. It is pale yellow and transparent. It has very little smell and even less taste. It is watery. I could drink it if I had too. It is pretty popular amongst college age adults. It is cheap and it is alcohol. I am not a fan of light beer."
"Drinkablity is a very questionable idea. Poor college student? Go for it. Other than that don't do it."
"Final Thoughts: ""Great Taste"" Hell no. ""Easy Drinking"" Hell yes. Wanna get drunk? Drink Busch Light as it is much more stomachable than its supposedly full flavored bretheren."
"Pale yellow body but at least it has good carbonation and a nice sized white head. The smell is mostly of adjuncts and sweetness. It must have been too long since the last adjunct lager, because I can no longer distinguish between corn and rice adjuncts. More adjuncts and sweetness in the taste. No hops to speak of. The complete lack of flavor and bitterness does make it pretty easy to drink so I guess I have to give it a higher score in drinkability."
"Ooo - my first perfect 2s beer!"
"It may just be my experience, but it really came out better from the can."
"Final Thoughts - For those that bash it, there are obvious reasons. It's a cheap beer. A 20 pack in bottles can be obtained for $11 (including deposit). This beer is best for those times when money is tight, or with a couple of friends when the name of the game is to get through as many beers as possible. Depending on the situation this brew could or could not be recommended."
"Korean Store Next Door/$5/6-pack"
"Sometimes beer should be drank in quantities and not just for quality."
"This is the ultimate college beer where I go to school. Compared to Coors Light this is a step up from one horrible beer to another. It pours a dark urine yellow like you've been drinking for at least an hour or so and it turns that color. The taste of the beer acts accordingly. It is super lame, but drinkable if you're at a college kegger. Unless you feel like bringing a stash of one of you're own really good beers then washing down the delicious taste with something like this so its drinkable, but not good."
"Drinkability like a dead baker's kid. I don't want that dude's bread. I'll drink this again, so long as Jergie convinces me the Sun won't come up again."
"I went to a party over the holidays and this was all that was served, so I gave it a shot. There are few redeeming qualities to this beer, except after a few, they go down pretty easy, hence the average drinkability score. Other than that, the beer is light on flavor and aroma and a little too heavy on the carbonation. I would avoid unless you are given no other choice."
"A ultra pale yellow pour with a thin fizzy whiote head. Aroma is very faint,some sweet pale malt and very little else.Flavor is much the same as the aroma,some fizzy pale malt.Sharp carbonated mouthfeel,little to no aftertaste,quite drinkable. You get what you pay for but not as horrible as expected."
"Poured a 12oz can into a Miller Lite/Harley Davidson pint glass. This beer poured a fizzy, straw yellow with a massive white head that quickly disappeared into nothingness. One of the worst head retentions I've ever seen in a beer. The aroma is canned corn with a bit of a sulfur funk to it. The aroma kind of reminds me of the funk you get from a green bottle. The flavor is straight up corn flakes. The mouthfeel is light with a decent dry finish. Like I said earlier, I have 5 more of these and I don't think I will finish the rest."
"The appearance was a light lemon honey yellow, like someone had poured water into a beer; just a basic thin film of a head. The smell was about the same; did someone pour beer into my glass of water? Tasted like how I would imagine a macro lager would taste if you left it out in the sun for a couple days, but weaker. The mouthfeel was again like water to me. The overall drinkability is a catch 22. You have to be wasted before you can drink it but you have to drink a whole ton of them before you're wasted."
"This is Bud Light in a different label. Pours clear yellow fizz with a white top. Taste and aroma are the same: corn, metal, and sugar. Used to drink this all the time in college; $6 for an 18-pack. The I moved to Virginia and saw they were gouging the NASCAR faithful at $12 am 18-pack. So sad."
"I'm glad I was able to pick this up at a price equal to it's worth. I think I could consume mass quantities of this without noticing, but I'd probably wake up in the drunk tank on a charge of doing something spectacularly disgusting. Leave this for the frat boys and the chronic alkies who need something to put their corn flakes in."
"Avoid this at all costs. If you can't avoid, dont drink anything."
"As a student at Holy Cross in Worcester, Massachusetts, this is positively the beer of choice. It has an extremely light body and that's about where the descriptions stop. No smell other than staleness and no body whatsoever. I rank this above most other college-canned beers only because it is less watery than most. I fail to understand why anyone would spend extra money to buy this in a bottle."
"Overall, please avoid this beer and buy something a little more expensive."
"Not very much beer flavor here. Taste is mostly of adjuncts and highly carbonated water. It certainly is light and it does taste crisp. Busch Light is not a horrible drinking experience, in fact it seems to taste better than most discount macro lights, for what that's worth."
"The color when poured was a very pale yellow with very little foam and no lace on the side of my glass. Poured in glass or drink out of the can, the flavor is of water down of all the lager components. You might as well drink ice cold water, it cheaper and better tasting!"
"Pours a pale straw yellow with a decent white, carbonated head that dissipated into nill. Very little collaring. Aroma is of malt and barley as is the taste, not much flavor. Texture is thin and carbonated. Not an extraordinary beer but if I am spending the day outdoors, especially when it is warm, this is an enjoyable beer."
"Only good if you want to drink alot of cheap beer and get plowed."
"drinkability: very easy. only good for long hot days."
"This might not be a real beer but I can appreciate it for what it is."
"Why review this? Because it was on-tap and I said to myself ""why not?"" My pint glass at McKee's was delivered to my table a bleached gold color with a trace of white foam. The head had already fizzed away by the time it reached me and there was no visible carbonation. The aroma was very weak, like a stale bar floor and some vinegar. The flavor was totally washed-out, vague corn mash is all I get. It barely pretends to be beer. Admittedly, the faint flavor is inoffensive and the body is super light and easy to drink. Crisp too, with a fizzy mouthfeel. So I suppose one could easily session this beer all night. But the question is why would you want to?"
"Drinkability - I used to think I didn't like beer because I was drinking the wrong beer, it was fun while it lasted, but I've graduated for good."
"I had this over to a friends house. It was poured into a frosted pint glass(not my choice). The beer looks like a typical macro light beer-light yellow with a fluffy head. Smell?-light hint of sweetness. The beer does not have much flavor either. The beer is water thin, hence it went down like I was drinking water. This is a typical light beer, it appeals to the masses because it is non offensive. But given the choice I will not be drinking it again."
"Very light yellow colored beer with a rapidly fading head.Aroma and taste both have the macro cereal taste.No caramel malts??No exotic hops??No complexity??Oh yeah that right it's in the style of light lager it's not supposed to.What it is is refeshing and light.Perfect beer for any outdoor outings!"
"Overall, too light and watered down for me. Okay for it's style (light lager). Simple and to the point. Thanks dad, for the opportunity to try this one (as I know it would never be in my beer fridge otherwise)."
"Pale color, musty, corny, grainy and quite watery."
"ho hum"
"definitely better than bud light, it has more flavor but not by much, and it comes in the dirty thirty, which is perfect for the avid beer pong player. now that we all have jobs we tend to buy the ""good stuff"" which amounts to coors light or miller lite. which we only really use for pong since its not very filling. you can't play beer pong with a newcaste, thats a waste of money!"
"Beer (if that's what you want to call it) pours yellow tinted water. Head billows up huge then dissipates immediately. Smell, taste and mouthfeel are virtually nonexistant. This beer is possibly a tie with Natural Light; it's not quite as offensive but at the same time not quite as satisfying. I don't know what else to say about this beer. It's probably the choice of fratboys when the drive-thru is all out of ""natty light""."
"This isn't even a good beer to get drunk on because it's only 4%. Terrible."
"D: Easy to drink but not much else to suggest it unless it is the only thing at hand in the boat or at the end of a soon-to-be long night."
"Pours watery yellow with a small white head out of a can. Put out the fire from the spicy crawfish boil, somewhat. Very seltzer water like, slightly bitter, and with very little malt flavor. Very bland, but I prefer this to some other light beers as I found the flavor unoffensive at least. Drinkable cold."
"D: This is a super easy to drink beer and if I planned on drinking a bunch of these I'd probably pick this one or something similar. It does not have that overwhelming corn sweetness that seems to characterize Keystone and other such beers. Just a forgettable beer that is easy going down but boring to drink"
"A supremely watery and drinkable session macro designed for getting ahwhasted. I think I remember enjoying it more out of the bottle."
"A very inexpensive beer that would be perfect for people who do not like beer. It is a pale straw color and has a weak head. Taste is of grainy yeast and corn. Aromas of bad bitter hops. The feel is light and fizzy. The carbonation is high to hide the flavor. I will never drink this again. Once was enough for me."
"God, I can't believe I drank this stuff."
"If you are short on cash and want to pick up beer, this is not your worst choice"
"A staple in college, preferably in the form of a box with 30 cans in it."
"Just an awful, awful beer. Even within the light macro lager category there are much better examples of the style."
"Busch Light also has some intangibles that I'm not sure how to work in here. It varies widely in quality. I've had many in these college years, and it ranges from putrid to tolerable. The can I'm reviewing was on the high end of that spectrum. Also, if you are using this beer to get intoxicated, you will have to drink a lot of them, and you'll be peeing every 15 minutes after a certain point. I guess that hurts drinkability."
"Drinkability - Fairly easy to drink, but so is water. Not the worst I've had, but close enough."
"M/D: it is smoothish and crisp but as for drinkable its not one id normally choose, i guess i figured i had reviewed a few too many good beers lately...i don't know...."
"D-AS DRINKABLE AS WATER BUT WITH A LITTLE KICK! I HAVE HAD BETTER 40oZ'S MALT LIQUORS."
"The mouthfeel is a train wreck of watery texture, plowing the final nail in the coffin of this ""beer."" I don't strive to trash beer, but this review is unavoidable, thankfully unlike the beer. Treat as the plague, and avoid."
"D- I don't think I could drink this if I was completely smashed. I'm not trying to bash this beer or be funny, but in my honest opinion this liquid doesn't even deserve to be called beer."
"Has an ok taste, still would rather have a bud normally, but when I reach for something cheap or just when I am really thirsty this one makes the list."
"drinkability is bad. this brew has little flavor, and what flavor it does have takes away from the watery character. not recommended."
"Okay , I am on a state of perfound drinking tonight, as far as uber cheap beers go, I highly stay away from driniking these beers I have been drinking unless you are not concerned with taste, other wise I would recomend some of the Ambers, they do know how to do that some what."
"pale yellow in color with not too much in the way of hops for a smell or taste. This is another beer that sits in your stomach and just, for me anyways, makes me want to vomit after a few. This beer as many others in its type gets undrinkable if its not just above freezing, so a coozie is a must if you're willing to drink this. little carbonation from what I can tell, and just all round a very poorly made beer."
"Copped a cheap six-pack of this when I was low on cash... A wrong move which resulted in severe heart-burn and a deep regret of having lost five bucks on a bland, oily macro light lager like this... appearance and smell were downright awful, with the latter being almost non-existent... Taste was equally poor, and the best thing that can be said about this brew was that it went down alright until the heart-burn kicked in... First and last time... Not recommended..."
"OK - I have gone on record as saying Busch is the worst tasting beer ever, but my ratings for this are lower. Why? It's a cheaply produced American Macro Light beer - don't expect anything good. This beer is good for dirnkers looking to drink solely for drinking's sake - there is no discernible appearance, smell or drink that tips someone off that they are indeed drinking a beer. My experience in that department was that at most college keggers I went to Busch Light kegs were the popular choice. Incredibly cheap, girls who hated beer would drink it because it was so watery and no one cared if you spilt it. If you're looking for a good light beer in the American Macro section, avoid this one (avoid most of them)."
"D-When I dont have a craft or homebrew, this is my cheap-o session beer, especially when BSing with my friends or in a social setting that is'nt my home"
"Drinkability- One of the better lite-macro beers out there. Probably about your best bet of the ones I've tried."
"The entire 40-ouncer of Busch Light poured into my Spaten Oktoberfest mug. The best thing about this review is the fact that now I know my mug holds 40 ounces of beer. Fantastic. Well, it's light gold with a foamy dish soapy-like head. It smells like if somebody spilled beer onto a pile of dirt and hay. Rather earthy. It tastes like metallic corn. Not even a hint of hops or malted barley. Tastes like cheap macrobrewed beer. But in Busch Light's defense, that what it's supposed to be. Good college/volume-drinking/cheap beer. That's all."
"This beer pours a nice gold color but has a very white and thin head. The aroma is of a light malt aroma with little to no hops. This beer has a good amount of carbonation and is not very bitter. It does not taste of much anything except water and a light malt and a small amount of it. It is very drinkable if your plan is to drink alot of them."
"Not recommended even though it super cheap"
"I was actually suprised this wasn't worse then it was. It has a pretty stereo typed image around my parts, and I don't have any idea why this is so put down by the Bud Light crowd?"
"I guess it's obvious by now that any beer that they sell in 30 packs probably aren't of the highest quality, but it's a cheap beer that does the job for a weekend party. Pours out a very light yellow color with heavy carbonation. Smells of bitter hops and offensive acidic tart. Taste follows suit. With many macro light lagers, it's usually watered down and bland, but this one is watered down and follows with a sour, unpleasant after taste. I highly doubt it was just this batch, as I've been through many and they all seem to have the same tart to it. Overall, definitely not the greatest light beer. Not even the best light beer by Anheuser-Busch. If you're looking to save money then this is the way to go, but even at that there are cheaper, better light beers."
"What to sya about this one. sad fact is there isnt a whole lot to say. The term been there done thta comes to mind but yeah. This is a generic light lager, astringent clean taste, light bodied, little malt. It's just like a cheaper slightly different bud light. the 4,2 is not bad for it;s class especially when it's parent busch regular is only like 4.6,"
"Not a good beer."
"Refreshing and cheap, but not something I will buy again."
"Carbonation is super crisp. Fizzy like soda. But you know what? I could easily throw back a bunch of these and not miss a beat. That's what macro lagers are all about, right?"
"D  Pound pound pound. I would never drink this unless Im out to drink the entire case."
"Yep, this is an American Light Lager. Not the worst but nothing to write home about either."
"Okay so....this is the old Busch Light. Drink tons of this in college, aka.... it has limited redeemable qualities aside from the fact that if getting hammered is your goal, you can drink gallons of this and never feel full. Busch truly is nearly water, but at I'll at least give it high drinkability ratings, because DAMN can I drink a lot of these at a party :) Of course, no complexity, terrible aroma, appearance is nothing special, etc. etc."
""
"I can't recommend this beer for anyone. It wouldn't work to improve or compliment any meal. This one is just a very bad beer. There are better choice even in a style with such a majority of similar offerings."
"I bought a case of this for 10.49 (bottles) at a local store. I thought for the price, it wasnt all that bad. I probably wont buy it again unless I was hurting for money. It had a white head that disappeared very fast. The head didnt have much of a flavor except for a slight taste of sweet. The beer itself was a very light yellow. The beer didnt have much of a taste, and kind of reminded me of beer drank on ice. You know, just a slight beer flavor and not much taste. It seems I see this beer advertised at different stores at a very good price. Its one of the cheapest around, and I can understand why."
"On a hot day when you should probably be drinking water and avoiding alcohol altogether, if you must have beer this might be a good choice."
"Busch Light is easy to drink, and is good for the consumption of large quantities of beer (as it is not very filling). To me it is a good alternative if you are willing to spend a buck or so more than AB's Natural Light."
"overall this is a cheap summer beer that can be good under the right conditions"
"Not so bad at all. Id do something about the smell though."
"This is the essential ""lawnmower", ""garage", or ""session"" beer in my casa. You can get a 30-pack for 12.99!!! It goes great with just about any food. I prefer drinking it with Lay's potato chips. It has a nice crispness and a refreshing taste that can be enjoyed on any occasion. It has little to no smell, looks terrible and has a head that disapears within seconds. But who cares! It is cheap and drinkable!"
"This beer looks like nothing really its a light gold color but it had a pretty nice looking head that disappeared rather quickly. It smelled of some malt and very little hops with a little citrussy feel. It taste like most light beers in the sense that it doesnt have much aof a taste some malt and some corn but all in all it doesnt really taste bad."
"So is it better than no beer at all. I guess I would rather have had this bad beer than a glass of milk with my hamburger."
"D- Taste and smell are so neutral you could drink this beer all day- except that the carbination stops."
"Drinkability: One could drink many of these if he did not desire flavor and complexity. I found it rather tasteless and boring."
"Poor beer, the same thing that milwaukee best, the same image, at last i try with american fast food; poor lacing, much grains in its flavor, sugar of corn and rice off course is present in its mouthfeel; the worst for a beer is the industrialized production; bitter and yellow beer; this style is not for me; recommended 40%"
"With the amount of Busch Light cans I see around my college town, I suppose it is deserving of a review. Pours a pale straw color, with a rapidly raising head that quickly fades away. Tiny bubbles (probably from the carbonation) rise to top as well. Smell...well I really didn't smell much to be completely honest. Taste was more like carbonated water then beer. As can be imagined, it was very light in body. Probably the only plus was that this beer extremely cold can be an effective thirst quencher. I have to say that this is one of the worst of all the cheap beers popular in college. I'de keep this one in the can to be honest. Happy Trails"
"D - Let's just say it would've been better if I left it in the can, rather than pouring it into a glass."
"Overall, everything is too faint, with some sweet kick at the end to dupe the drinker into thinking its good. It's just sweet watery light alcohol. Pass on this. Please."
"If you have to go slumming, go for LaCrosse Light (the best cheapo light macro lager IMO). Or reach for the unavoidable Miller or Bud at least. This really is (and I don't like to say this) the worst beer I've ever had."
"D-Not a beer I would recomend for any reason other than for the desperate or very broke. An entirely forgetable brew."
"D- Strictly for drinking games/pounding at a party."
"Its an inexpensive beer to buy and I think it has a little more taste than other light beers I have tried. It has a light gold color not very much head if poured into a glass. I find it leaves no bad after taste and is very drinkable on a day when I just want a few cold beers."
"Busch Light was a very clear, extemely light yellow color. It had short white head that dissapered instantly. There was very little to smell or taste. The mouthfeel was very light and watery with a medium to high carbonation level. This would be a good beer for someone that doesn't like to actually taste what they are drinking. Not recommended. Avoid."
"Busch Light pours an extremely pale straw color with a thick fluffy white head from a twelve ounce can. Smells like adjunct. Taste is very light, adjunct all the way along with some metallic notes. Not particularly good even for a light beer. Not recommended."
"Overall one of the worst BMC products out there. Next time I m going to pass on this one."
"D  Cost makes this beer drinkable, however, not at the top of any list. A standard American macro brew."
"D - Drinkable....if you want to get drunk very cheaply. I have had worse."
"This is not even refreshing on a hot day - no flavor - might as well have water. A friend of a friend brought this and left one in the fridge. I figured I would give it a shot. I don't know why I bothered. It's a mix of a great deal of water a touch of metal and a touch of some sort of adjuncts that are hardly noticeable."
"Drinkability - What's there to say? It's macro light and not one of the extemely offensive ones. On the cheap end of the beer aisle."
"But this comes pretty close to the bottom."
"If nothing else, my favorite beer for playing drinking games like beer pong, beirut, and their ilk. A good match for adderall in its baseless neutrality."
"If you want beer that tastes like water...albeit bad city water...this is your brew. Smells more like the aluminum can it comes in than beer. Some scent of burnt rice and skunk cabbage. Taste like seltzer water gone bad. You could easily down a 12 pack of these on a hot day in the desert. Next time I visit my neighbor I'll be sure to bring my own beer over."
"The appearance is piss yellow and the aroma smells of a light body and, honestly, not much at all. The taste is very light and has a slight aftertaste in which adjuncts can be detected. The mouthfeel is a crisp medium/high carbonation. In conclusion, Busch really has no taste to speak of and there are much better beers (even light beers) out there to be had. However, Busch is an outstanding beer to be enjoyed by many a youth around the country for cheap in circumstances ranging from bonfires to fishing to kicking back on a porch.... and for that, it will always hold a special place in my heart. :-)"
"Thanks to my son's increasing interest in beer, we seem to have lots of Busch light cans around our house at all times, ah teenage, I remember it well (well at least I remember some of it) Anyway this classy product pours very clear, very light and very piss like in color. It shows off a quickly leaving white head, and has next to no aroma. Light, bland stuff. Minimal hops, malt, flavor, and interest. But it does go down easy and if you drink several and your girlfriend drinks several you have a decent chance of having some fun."
"Bottom line: you can do worse. It's easy to do better, but at least it wasn't the [shudder] Silver Bullet."
"Poured a very pale yellow color, with a large white pffy head. Smell is very mild with only a slight sweetness present. Taste is also very light (as the name states), and is thirst quenching when ice cold , but begins to get bad as it warms. Finish is slightly swwet, with no hops noted. OK, ice cold, as a spacer."
"Drinkability - Avoid at all costs."
"Yes, finally reviewing this. I have spent many a night getting wasted off this stuff, because it has no taste if it is really cold. One night, my buddies and I bought 3 cases to have case races with and I had one warm...never again. It was even worse than Bud Light (my least favorite beer in the world). The beer pours a clear pale yellow with no head retention and no lacing. It smells like partying. Taste is like rice water but really tastes like nothing. I've drank alot of this stuff in one night, but I shudder everytime I buy it, so I give it ok marks for drinkability."
"Ridiculously clear..nearly colorless, pale yellow. Grassy aroma...grains and an offensive metallic presence. The taste & mouthfeel are so thin and nearly nonexistant.. I know it's a bit cliche, but this really is beer flavored water. I tried to review with an open mind, I really did. But when comparing this to even mediocre craft brews, this offering isn't even in the same sport, let alone the same league. There are hundreds of thousands (if not millions) of people that will insist on drinking this their entire life..I'm just glad I'm not one of them."
"The pours a slightly yellow white into my cup. That is sad, in my present (drunk) condition I thought that it was water for a second. I gave it a two because of the frothy head that does stick around. The smell is pretty bad, that of bad beer. The taste is almost not there at all. It does show a little while after it warmed up. Just bad cereal malts, kinda like cheerios. The mouthfeel is extremely watery. It is drinkable when ice cold, but when wamer the sweetness is adjunct and lowers the drinkability. The only reason people drink this is because it has no flavor. They think they are drinking good beer. As for me, this New Years really early morning I am going back to the Sierra Nevada Stout. Happy New Year's to all you fellow good beer drinkers."
"drinkability is reasonable since if you stay away from the nose, which is a little gross, you can easily put back a few of these."
"I really tried to review this with an open mind, honestly I did. I maybe even tried to hard to find things I enjoyed about this beer, but I still couldn't find them. Beer pours a yellowish color, with a decent but not really attractive head. Smell is of alcohol and straw. Tastes a bit like wet straw, alcohol is present, weird in a 3.2 beer. Mouthfeel is watery and a lot of people give this a high drinkability, but I didn't really enjoy this going down. This is for a party of disrespecting beer, because nobody who respects it would drink this with intentions to enjoy."
"Drinkability: Hell yeah I could kill about 20 of these in a sitting. Not to say I would want to, or be overly willing to. A thoroughly disgusting beer, but one I could consume a whole lot of. Great for getting drunk, but barely considering its low alcohol content. Basically an affordable way to induce vomiting."
"Again, I do not intend to insult those of you have enjoyed or even love this beer. The company has great commercials and a racing league. But this is not a beer that you will find in my refrigerator. Unless of course I'm playing beer pong that night."
"ok first off this taste like water well it is cheaper than water it is unsure to me what color it accually is cuase im to lazy to poor it out it smells like watery beer and taste the same it is verry drinkable since like previosly stated it taste like water"
"Well, here it is; the sub-premium beer from the people that brought you Budweiser (junk beer). This beer is actually my need-cheap-beer-for-house-work beer. It has a light straw color, an almost non-existent smell, and a taste reminiscent of the standard American macro-lager. The mouthfeel is non-existent. It is very drinkable if you are looking for a session beer easy on the wallet."
"This brew pours a clear ligth straw color. It looks more like tinted water than beer. The only redeming quality it has is that it did have a nice sized flfuuy head for about ten seconds before it faded away into nothing. There is absolutely no lacing. There is no aroma to this beer. The taste is exactly like the aroma, nothing. I normally prefer to uses the phrase light bodied over thin bodied when discribing a beer's mouthfeel, as it caries more positive connotations. This beer, however, is clearly thin bodied. Overall, this is a beer I would wish upon my enemies."
"Now, what is the moral of the story? First, that one might think that a group of respectable law school students would have moved beyond the power hour phase, but we haven't. And second, yeah Busch Light sucks, but come on, it's easy to pound away 10-15 of these over a night. That's gotta be worth something. Well, disagree if you want, but I will stand by my Busch when I need to get loaded on $5 or less."
"Draft pitcher. I wish I could be proud of my little home town, but the two bars there have five taps between them with this, Michelob Light, Bacardi Raz, Coors Light, and Schells 1919 Root Beer. Im okay with the root beer, but really! Almost every bottled or canned beer here is ""light"" too! While my brothers and I chewed the fat, we worked down a pitcher of this swill. The dominating taste is water. Some corn sqeezin's, but no malt character at all. I should have known better, but that was my choice. Like the namesake president, this beers presentation is all lies with no substance to back it up."
"This is the worst beer I have ever tasted."
"As far as points are concerned, this beer gained a few on drinkabilily. It was easy to chug, and is good for any type of game in that manner. As far as sitting down an drinking a quality beer though, find something else."
"Pours pale straw creating a two finger head... reduces to mild lacing quickly. Very faint malt scent overpowered by corn and grain smell , and a total absence of any hop aroma. Crisp taste, watery, but very smooth. The carbonation softens the adjuncts and the hops are finally detectable in the aftertaste. This beer may be ""easy drinkin", but theres a lack of taste too great even for an american light lager. Alcohol content is not listed, but I estimate its fairly modest. Drinkability is important but people don't buy busch to quench thier thirst."
"Bottle obtained from the discount rack of a local liquor store in July 2005. Consumed a couple evenings later...born on date = 06 Jul 05. Pours a one-finger white head over a crystal clear very pale yellow. Smells of cardboard, corn, gentle malt sweet. Taste mostly comes from the carbonation. Beneath the acrid carb sting is a gentle malt sweet and a hop floral. The aftertaste is a little bit hop bitter and the hop flavor is a bit more flat than earlier. Super-thin body and heavily carbonated. Wow, this is the first time I've had a beer where the carbonation was the predominant flavor. Beer scored to style, not my flavor preferences."
"Busch Light isn't good beer, but I think you knew that already. It is, however, ever so slightly preferable to Coors Light. When it comes to the flavor of a macro light, less is often more. Busch Light may not be as 'cold tasting' (what a bunch of hooey), but it should be as close as possible to freezing, while still being able to exit the can/bottle as a liquid, before drinking. If you absolutely must, that is."
"I've gotta say, for a cheap ass beer, this brew could be a helluva lot worse. Pours out to a light yellow color with high carbonation, but a short lived head. Aroma of corn is most noted, as there isn't much else in this brew. Flavors of watery barley and corn are noted, but again, nothing else. Finished clean and crisp. Nothing great here, but I can see this beer being a favorite of college kids with no desire to appreciate beer in all it's true glory."
"If you're gonna drink crap, this is the beer for you. I have many Busch fueled memories from college and to be honest, why plunk down more money for Bud, etc when Busch is cheaper and tastes as good if not better. I've found that from the bottle it has a nice beery characteristic that most light beers lack. Cooked corn, grassiness etc are still present, but thats all a part of the style. A bit overcarbonated in the can but out of the bottle its not bad. Don't get me wrong, its an awful, horrid beer, but its not trying to be a Stone IPA. If you're in the need for cheap and can't find Ballantine, this is it."
"The drinkablity is harsh because of the beers skunky quality. This beer is the official Keg beer of ECU. Cheap, flavorless. Good for when my fraternity needs to throw a kegger."
"A light American Adjunct lager. Not much to say, not much to be impressed by. Inoffensive. Pours a light light straw color. I actually got some lacing from this. Head retention is minimal. Very very little flavor, I can't pick anything out good or bad. Perhaps a slight sweetness/cooked corn flavor, but not much. Moutfeel is okay, a little thick for a light adjunct lager. Well, perhaps, over carbonated. I'd drink it if it was this or going thirsty, but I wouldn't look hard for it."
"At $13.99 for a 30-pack, this beer is overpriced. People pay good money to get this on tap near me too. Spend an extra dollar for each case you buy and get something somewhat better."
"Mmmm... Busch Light, the taste most of us grew up on. This obviously is not the greatest beer in the world, but honestly its not bad at all. I would consider it a mid-range domestic brew. Its not so gross that you cant choke it down and its not so good that its going to cost you an arm and a leg just to get a buzz. I like to dip into nice expensive treat beers once in a while, but I always go back to good ole' Busch Light. The more often you drink it, the better it seems to get. Although it is quite watery and almost tasteless, around here its the cheapest way to knock back a few brews without gagging yourself with terrible beer."
"Beer number 2 for the day, after a Mickey's. I'm either starting early or finishing late, I'm still not sure. This beer is so watery in appearance I would not think it to be beer if I didn't know. No smell whatsoever and the taste is very, very watery. Maybe some adjuctyness in there but it's really just like barley water. Good to have for its value when playing drinking games. I see tons of college students (esp girls) drinking this b/c it's cheap and lacks any flavor. Terrible beer to sit down and drink with though."
"Pours with almost no head... It's really weird to drink this out of a glass, and the way it looks is a darned good reason not to drink it that way.. I swear that it looks like urine... It tastes kind of skunky, and metallic.. To be honest, I don't expect much from a light beer, and this certainly isn't the worst one out there. It's a good beer if you're looking for something cheap to get wasted on, and hey, it ain't Keystone Light..."
"Pours pale amber with some head. Smells like skunk and alcohol, nothing else. Tastes like seltzer that's been sitting for a freaking long ass time. But, I think I detected the slightest hint of wheat. It may have been my imagination. Mouthfeel is most certainly like seltzer. Drinkable? If you're playing beer pong sure. Otherwise, I think I wasted the minutes of my life drinking this."
"Graduation party.poured a pale yellow, with a white head. from the (shudder) can aroma weak corn , wheat, and not much of anything else. flavor weak corn, wheat.I have had better water. I just do not see the attraction to this beer, it was a waste of time to even open the can."
"It tastes bad. Smells bad. Goes down like water so you can drink a lot."
"Overall- not a fan, I can definitley drink it when it comes my way, but there are countless beers I would rather have. For the cheap college kid though (me) very drinkable and appealing"
"The beer departs the can a faded gold color with a portly head that is frothy white and the lace left behind a velum like sheet. Nose is crisp and clean, malt sweet with the start somewhat sweet and the top thin as the edge of space. Finish is stinging in its acidity and the hops light, dry aftertaste."
"Went to a frat party at Francis Marion, and well, there they love this stuff. The main draw to it is definately the price, but when I look for a beer I would rather throw in a couple extra dollars than to drink this. However, it gets the job done for cheep. I instead threw in an extra $3 for Budweiser, which may not be the best beer in the world, but it beats the hell out of this stuff."
"Over-all a cheap mass produced bargain batch. I'll be saving my 10.99 for something craft-like."
"(12 oz. can)"
"I guess this one can was good for a flashback, but i'm sure as hell glad that the Alstrom brothers saved my ass and sheparded me to better beer. I'm forver in debt to BeerAdvocate."
"Notes: This is beer by definition, not by example. Period. I gave it a good drinkability score because thats what it is, a good ""get drunk"" beer."
"Color of...light beer i guess - clear light yellow. minimal head, just ugly hissing carbonation that releases unpleasant scent of stale sourness, and...lawn mulch. Taste is the same as smell. sour grass and sweet adjucts. I think the beer attempts to distract you from the taste with carbonation, but it doesnt work. absolutely awful."
"Busch Light is like any other AB light beer. Pours a pale yellow with no head. Taste is of strong hops with water flavor. No huge smell, hint of hops, metallic if smelling out of can. No mouthfeel what so ever. You can however drink alot of these. I did drink these quite alot when I was in High School, very cheap and just as equal with Bud Light which was more expensive. Personally if I had to choose to have a Busch product I would get a regular Busch, you get more bang for your buck and atleast it tastes somewhat like a lager, sorta."
"Busch light draft, what can I say, this is a mass consumption beer. It's not a saturday afternoon beer, unless you are in college (like me). This beer is cheap but its very good. Busch light is extremely smooth and good ice cooled in a snow bank. This beer is much better than the trendy bud light, that is much more expensive."
"Wehn I think of adjuncts, I now think of Busch light. This beer is terrible with a faint yellow color, no head and no carbonation and a skunky smell that makes you wish you had a Rogue close by. The taste was of corn and not much else. It was absolutly horrid and I hope to never drink this again."
"A very light straw color with a white head, no carbonation. Smells of adjuncts and grain, not very strong. Tastes like corn and faint malt, with almost no hops finish. Not good, pouring it into a Samuel Smith tulip almost seems like a travesty. Very cheap, and not satisfying."
"Pours a very light, very clear, yellow-tinged liquid. Actually, the head is very nice: puffy and bright white, with notable stability. Zero aromamaybe a faint hint of cooked vegetables, but you have to nearly inhale the liquid to get even that minor sensation. Essentially zero taste as well, with a little tingle of carbonation. Im not exaggerating to say that I think Ive had seltzer water with more character. Now, there isnt anything unpleasant about the beerit simply has a complete lack of any attributes at all. Nothing disagreeable because theres nothing thereof course, that begs the question: can it then be called beer?"
"Final Thoughts: Just like I remember (should get bonus points for consistency from one bottle to another). Since this is the first beer I ever had, if I would not have liked it, I may not be drinking beer now. In a way it has helped me to get to BA, because I thought ""there has to be something better out there""."
"It's almost odorless, which may be a blessing, and terribly bland. There were two cans left in my beer fridge from my parents' last visit, so I figured, what the heck, right? Wrong! The second one went right into the trash. I wouldn't even cook with it. I don't like to trash a beer, because I know someone somewhere likes it, but I just can't help myself here. Yep, it's drinkable, just like water, so next time, failing other options, I'll have the water."
"Allllllllright, this is something you give to an enemy to drink. I can't emphasize the blandness/wateriness of this stuff. My girlfriend's dad drinks it and he's a trucker(not that there's anything wrong with that). Maybe that would show that he doesn't really get into tasteing beers and what not. Reviews; Appearance: What appearance, looks like water with some carbonated foam on it. Smell: Smells like teen spirit or skunky water, which ever you want. Taste: Taste is as bad as the smell, if not worse, because you are subjecting your body to it. Mouthfeel: Ah, I don't feel like doing the last two. Just don't waste your money!"
"Thin, watery texture, borderline of a very pale yellow, skunky aroma, cooked veggies if anything on the nose. Initial bland, boring and rather skunky. Pushing hard to detect any sort of character, trying to detect any malt body is tough. Corn, veggie and adjuncts to be noted. A very bad product by A-B. Avoid at all costs."
"Busch Light, from a can: that was all they served at the recent rodeo I attended. I am at a loss to understand this beverage. Cripes, it is shockingly pale. I mean, take a Bud and pour half a glass of water in it, and you are still to dark. No head. Initial aroma was like melted wax, yeah, I know, that does not make any sense. The taste is . . . absent. I mean, there is sweetness there, toward the end, but this is not a beer. I’m not kidding, I’ve had water that has more taste than this. Not enough of anything even to be awful."
"I can still complain even though my sister gave it to me free. This is the closest thing to tasteless beer I have seen. A little sweet, a little grainy tasting. Carbonation. What carbonation? Flat tasting. Drank 3 of them. Is there alchohol in this? No wonder I don't buy it."
"Dammit, more AB. When barbequeing, do not let friends bring beer. This is what they bring. Poured a stain water, colour of some sort. Yellow? I dunno. Weak smell. Adjuncty. Taste was bland. Undrinkable swill. It's cheap, smells terrible, looks terrible, tastes terrible and requires alot for a cheap buzz. Get something else."
"Pours yellow and fizzy with a very carbonated short lived white head. The aroma predominantly corn and rice adjuncts bringing a sweetness to the aroma, but at the same time it also brings an off tone that just isn't pleasant of feet. No real hop profile maybe a chemically formulated one, but that's about it. This is not a real beer, this is a macro beer meant to be consumed in masses by the masses. Cold and crisp, the label describes this beer properly ""refreshing light beer", well so is water I will stick to that. Flavors to note here is a bland sweetness mixed with a bitterness that just isn't right. Mouthfeel is thin and water like, which is why this beer can be consumed right after another without a problem. If your looking for a good beer pass on a Busch Light."
"The most redeeming quality of this watery brew is that its lack of flavor actually lessens the awful A-B taste present in all their beers. Straw colored, no head retention, and not much smell beyond the adjuncts."
"Drinkability: Refreshing, but a poor example of a light beer. Even in this much-maligned style of beer, there are far better examples to be found."
"How can I review a beer so horrible, It's macrogarbage at its worst. I don't even care to think about how bad this is, one taste will tell you, damn what am I thinking and drinking. Stick to WATER as with all AB products, it doesn't matter which beer it is Dry, Ice, Original, or Light. They are all lousy and of poor quality and that born on date doesn't matter if you drank it from the brewery itself."
"My roommate had a few extras of these guys so i though i might as well review it. Another of the standard cheap light beers from AB. not much of a taste to be noticed, probably corn. What you want for mowing the lawn or getting wasted outside on a hot day. Not much good otherwise."
"I will try to stay awake while I finish itttttttttt...zzzzzzzzzzzz"
"I didn't think Busch Beer could get any lighter. And I see Busch Light for $4.99 a twelve-pack. Out of money, tired and worn out, I purchase it. As thin and pale as a beer gets...if you stare at it long enough, you'll either think of pee or apple juice, depending on your mood. I really couldn't smell anything out of this beer. And flavor is pretty much defined by a watery mouthfeel, and just a fake hint of sweetness. This beer has no reason to be around. Just buy regular Busch if you're that broke."
"Unfortunately, I am forced to drink this beer from time to time as it is the only beer many of my friends drink. It is an ultra-thin beer that tastes mostly of water. The flavorings you do notice don't really give any hint that this is beer. The only real way to tell this is a beer is to gag down a bunch until the alcohol starts to do its work, and then you can drink it more easily. Like most american lights, this is not a beer to enjoy, it is a cheap beer to use to get drunk with friends."
"This is pretty cheap as far as beers go. I thought that it looked, poured and tasted a lot like coors light. The head was really big and disappeared instantly. There was more carbonation than some of the other beers of this ilk and even had a little bit of a malted taste(which I cannot say is in Bud Lite or Keystone). For someone on a budget not such a bad buy."
"this was the ultimate party beer back in college....thank god those days are long gone.   this beer is clean, clear and close to not being a beer.  it useless to wax poetic about it's characteristics unless cold and watery are desirable...ok cold is imperative, but watery isn't something to brag about.   back in the day i always thought this brew had a certain taste that i liked over the other light beers, but upon further review....i can't find it.  i think i'm going to go slap myself now for buying a whole 40 ouncer to review."
"Pours with a big white foam which settles to a 1/4 top.  Color is so light, it is virtually clear.  You can see right through the beer.  Smell reminds of stale beer left over the morning after a party.  Slightly sweet taste that lingers in the aftertaste.  All the flavors are greatly subdued.  A few drinks leaves a sour taste.  No bitterness detected.  Maybe a little vinegar taste.  I am drinking past best before date so maybe it's bit unfair.  Beer feels thin in mouthfeel.  The only reason I have this beer is because I needed a neutral beer to doctor samples for taste testing."
"This one wasn't very good at all. Very pale yellow and crystal clear, not head at all, just a little ring of tiny bubbles around the glass. Grainy smell, that's it. Grains and alcohol. It was very watered down tasting and feeling. Extremely thin body. Only a tiny bit of malt flavor, and a smaller hops taste. IMO, there was almost something fishy tasting about the beer. I could see this being a refreshing beer if the time was right. Boy, I hope the time is NEVER right."
"Notes: Light beer = less calories = less flavour. Why drink beer with less flavour, how much fun is it to eat a diet meal that tastes like nothing?"
"This stuff isn't that bad, but it lacks a ton of taste.  You could save yourself a lot of money and drink water."
"Light pale gold. White head of average size, some retention, no lace. Boring taste, nothing that resembles hops or malt is detectable. Watery, poor mouthfeel. The nose is faint, semi-sweet, light adjuncts. It feels like the alcohol content is hovering around a 'near beer'! I see why Busch Light is the Frat party beer of choice."
"Very mediocre."
"Is it just me or is this the beer of choice of every loser pothead you ever knew? All I know is you have to be stoned to ""enjoy"" this crap."
"Bad, but better than the original. It still says Busch on the can. Less calories for you homeless guys looking to keep thin."
"Ah, the misunderstood Busch Light.  Is it a poor-man's Bud Light?  Is it a frat-boy beer?  Or is it just a lightly flavored beer than can be drank quickly?   This is a very light beer indeed.  Very pale in color with a quickly disappearing head.  It won't make you want to give up better beers, but it has its place in the beer spectrum.  Slight fruity taste with next to no hops.  Best consumed outside on a 90 degree day."
