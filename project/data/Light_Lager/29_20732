The aroma isn't much of anything really, just some grass and sweet corn. The taste is well...horrible! Talk about a 'watered-down' brew taste, this would be it. Actually the taste is very light of grain with a slight sweet corn finish that is a tad on the dry side.","BeerWithMike","Jul 20, 2014"

Smooth, easy, maybe a little too easy to drink with a taste that isn't offensive, it is the perfect diet beer. Miler Lite to me is bitter , with a tang and offensive, Coors is like water as is Bud 55, at least this beer has some taste and will give me a buzz. A lot of the other premium light beers aren't light at all. Select gives you the right balance between calorie/carbs and taste.","Clocker","Jan 30, 2013"

The foamy head is actually pretty impressive, although it's a 25 ouncer not a pint but still. The taste is a tolerable mix of corn, hops and carbonation but not an overpowering sharpness that I get from Bud Light.

It does have a bit of maltiness in the aftertaste, but it fades quickly. The initial taste (and lingering aftertaste) is only slightly different from seltzer water.

It isn't as big (or swillish) as Bud and is heavier than Bud Light (no pun intended), but there's nothing here. The smell is faint of these so-called select hops, and the taste is like Bud but with more water.
