"Not pleasant...obviously.  Received as part of a mystery case."

"Well this genny from the block is certainly a whole lot lighter than J-Lo."

"My Dad's favorite beverage, you can't teach an old dog new tricks, I wish I could get him turned on to a session IPA. There seems to be a lot of water added to the batch. It tastes OK at the brewery. Dirt cheap but I would look elsewhere, not even worth a college keg party.."

"Pale gold in color with excellent clarity. A quarter inch of white head rests on top and gradually diminishes entirely. I get loads of corn and an dialectal note that is off putting. The taste is corn and a metallic note. The body is thin and watery. That's $1.29 that I want refunded."

"O- I'll try it again when on an extreme budget. It's between a dollar and 1.25 for a 24 oz, or 13.50 for a 30 rack, partially because it's the local poison for me. Definitely will take this over a regular Genny too, it has less of that flavor. (Usually not a good thing, but you see what I mean.)"

"Genny Light brewed by Genesee Brewing Co in New York State. This brew pours out a nice amber color with a thick white head. This brew is darker than your average American Light Lager beer. This brew also has a smell of grains. Nothing bad about the smell. The taste of this brew is light, there is not much there. A hint of sweet and water, and that is about it. For this brew being darker than other light beers out there, there is not much there. But this brew has an abv of 3.6, and other American lagers are about 4.2 abv. I'm not impressed by this beer; it could be so much more. There is nothing bad about this beer, but really nothing to write home about either. If you like light beer then you may like this brew."
"O - This light beer has more flavor than most macro lagers. Probably one of the more flavorful light beers out there."
""
"Overall, cheap and very low in ABV. I only bought it to review. Gotta try 'em all at some point!"

"o: A decent light beer, not so bad with lunch, extremely sessionable at 3.6% ABV, but definitely not a go-to for flavor."

"as the lousy cans of cheap beer go, I don't hate this one. it still looks, smells, and tastes like a beer, like it might contain the essential elements, and like it still might be brewed rather than mixed or synthesized or whatever they do to make the corn water these days. sudsy head surprises me, and the nonmetallic flavor profile suggests a level of quality a step or two above the others. real thin and watery feel, but it is a light lager after all. yeast helps it finish clean, no off putting flavors sticking around. easy enough drinking, if you can handle all the bubbles. but if its cola by day and cheap cans by night, this is your horse."

"Overall tough to sit down and rate a style like this. With such a light body and alcohol content the flavors are subtle."

"notes: really not bad, easy to drink. Low abv makes this a lawnmower's session beer."
"O- I've had worse, so I may even cross paths with this again. What the heck."
"Yay local!"
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Overall, Just another light adjunct. Oh well, This stuff is $1 for a 24oz can virtually anywhere you go so you get what you pay for."
""
""
""

"Overall – While certainly not the most flavorful, it is rather refreshing and at only $1.29 for a 24 oz can it makes for a great session brew."

"Overall: Saw this at the store and decided to give it a try. It goes down easy but is not a good beer in my opinion."
""
"Overall - This is pretty much your average light lager. Maybe a little better. It's good."
"For the price its solid, although super low in abv. It tastes kinda like corn, and cheap grain. Its on the sweeter side, extremly drinkable, very minimal flavor. but its better than Natty, Milwaukees level. I prefer highlife for budget beer. But its better than wasting money on Bud or Coors."

"Honestly, for the price point I was expecting something much worse than what I received, I could have (and yes, I have) done much worse than this particular brew. It's... tolerable. It could even work as a lawnmower beer if you cared very little about flavor yet didn't want to drink straight water."
""
"Out of a can this Light Lager was an urine yellow (really) color with one finger of white head. The head was short lived but it did show some retention as a collar that left scant lacing. The aroma was a faint blend of corn and rice. The flavors were bad. I tasted an unpleasant mix of corn, rice and cardboard. Slightly sour as well. It reminded me of Kix cereal, only stale/rancid. The mouthfeel was watery, the body light and the carbonation medium. Garbage."

" I think I found my new lawnmower beer!"
"Overall – You're not going to be blown away by the taste of this beer by any means.. but for the style it actually isn't half bad. I purchased 30 of these for a recent camping trip and they worked out well. They have a bit of a sweet malty taste that kind of sets it apart from the other beers in it's category. I'd buy it again."
"Sampled on June 24, 2011. It pours pale yellow with a fizzy white head. The aroma is full of corn and grain with a dim hop backdrop. The body is actually pretty good for a light lager. It is better than watered down. The taste hjas a dash of malts with a fresh hop bite at the end. An acceptable macro."
"Golden and sudsy with lots of carbonation. Has an initial aroma of dank skunkiness that goes away after the beer has breathed for a minute. Dry grain aroma with some sugary undertones. Tastes of dry vegetables and grain. Has pretty decent flavor and a lot of body for a light beer."
"D-Yeah, this is drinkable. The fact that it is about %.5 less alcohol than other light beers is a setback because if you are trying to get hammered, its a few extra beers to drink. But the taste is better than expected. Overall, for the cheapest 30 rack at my college's local liquor store. I cannot complain."
"Notes: While I find Genny Light to be a quality light beer, I'm still not a fan of the style. A once-in-the-while for me, at best. If anything, it's much better than the Big 3 (Bud Light, Miller Lite & Coors Light)."
"D- OK actually. I'd take this over any of the ""bargain"" lights like keystone or busch."
"Drank it from the can and it's not half bad. Very light bodied beer. Not a ton of taste or flavor but what was there wasn't too bad. Went down smooth, easy to drink. Not a great beer, but for the price, it will get the job done if you're going for quantity."
"Pours a thin looking straw yellow color with a HUGE billowing white head and no lacing at all. Smells of corn and sweet malts. Tastes of tons of grain and corn character, and some malts. Mouthfeel is very thin and fizzy and drinkability is very low."
"At $3.49 a six pack of 16 oz cans not a bad deal.."
"Not a great showing on the head, but one finger atop a brew of light yellow, rating a 2 on the SRM beer color chart. Lace is null. Smell is faint, veggie, cereal grains, malt. Taste is also mild, but balanced and refreshing for a light beer. Flavors of cereal grains, and malt. Little alcohol, but again this is a light beer. Most mouthfeel I have had in a light beer in a long time, not great, but better than water, with a nice zip from the carbonation. Good inexpensive light beer, better than many priced higher. Another good yard work/cookout beer."
"D: The label looks like a water bottle - a nice blue splashing wave. How fitting. Truth in advertising. NE USA hillbilly H2O."
"D: Goes down smooth & easy. Typical low budget lawnmower beer."
"Eh."
"Serving type: Tap"
"This beer gets a terrible rap for being brewed with water from the Genesee river but most of the water we drink in that area comes from it and its some of the best tasting water in the state. Genny also brews Sam Adams, mike's hard lemonade, and blue light lime so if the water really had an effect on the flavor, would these companies allow their product to be produced at the Genny brewing facilities? I think not, so to Rochester and all people with access to Genny beer, choose Genny over those overpriced, foreign or stateside macro brews and support the local economy. Enjoy a Genny or Dundee brew!"
"Drinkability - easy to knock back. Nothing memorable except the price. $2.99 a sixer of pint cans for a standard budget lawnmower beer works for me."
"A pale straw yellow color body with a quickly fading two finger head , lively carbonation . Aroma of corn beer , faint hops and something lightly sweet . Flavor is corny , straw and light hops , light body , watery mouthfeel , not too bad but nothing to remember ."
"Poured from a 12 oz. can. Has a very pale yellow color with a small head. Smell is of corn and malts. Taste is also of corn and malts, more flavor than most light beers. Feels light in the mouth and is very drinkable. Overall at $3.19 a six pack, I must say this beer exceeded my expectations."
"D - Keeping in mind that I am trying (as always) to judge this beer for what it is, it really isn't that bad. I was expecting something uncommonly nasty, but it is bland and inoffensive. This alone puts it above other off-flavored light beers such as Bud Light. I drank this can at well above the Rocky Mountain level of cold that it is intended to be served at and it still wasn't a chore to imbibe (just try that with most light beer). This is by no means a good beer, but it isn't actively bad, just very light, and its extremely neutral flavor is actually a pretty impressive achievement."
"The Detroit area specialty beer store I go to always has beers common to other parts of the country but rare here. That why I had to buy a 30 pack of this. I've never had it before. So I pour... Very clear hay yellow color with a quickly-dissolving soap bubble head. Now it looks like diluted apple juice. Smells earthy and corn-like. Smells like just about every other macrobrewed light beer ever. But the taste is a little different. Surprising. Tastes like cereal? Cherrios, Corn Flakes... King Vitamin? This may smell like every other light beer but the taste is pleasantly surprising. Slightly sweet, grainy, and Grape Nuts good. I like it. It's still a watery beer that you'd drink mass quantities of around a campfire with your jerkoff friends but it's not bad. All beers need love. I'll cherish the time that I have with the other 29 Genny Lights."
"Had this beer after it was offered to me by a friend. Pours golden with not much head to speak of. Smells metallic with some hints of malt and corn. Taste is a light malt with adjunct a slight metallic hint of citrus. Overall, it's just a macro, but it's a macro that's a lot less offensive than anything BMC has ever put out, not to mention the much higher priced Corona. Beer pong approved."
"D: Beats the pants off of Bud Light and Coors Light. Actually cleaner and less blatantly adjuncty than regular Genesee. Still, not really much reason to seek this out. We had some left over from a party, so that's why I'm drinking it right now."
"A finger of bone-white head with really low retention. It fell like Wile E. Coyote off of a cliff. Nose had the same sharpness that I noted in the Leaded version, this being Unleaded. Color was a straw yellow with NE-quality clarity. Mouthfeel was really thin and watery with a better, cleaner taste than Leaded. Maybe producing a Light version of a beer CAN be a good thing... Finish was likewise less sharp and more pleasant that Leaded. I would drink this over Leaded, but I would still like to grab a Genny Cream and see how it stands up."
"Avoid on tap at all costs. Just lick the condensation off of the side of a metal keg for a similar experience."
"(rated Nov 30, 2008)"
"(draft @ Greater Rochester International Airport - Rochester, NY) Pours a very pale yellow with a small thin head and very few bubbles. Has a very weak hoppy aroma. The initial taste is one of hops, but that's about it. Very thin-bodied, mostly water. Easy to drink because of that fact, and also because it doesn't have much in the way of a taste. Not too good, but not a horrible light beer."
"Despite some of the outrageously low scores posted for this beer and in the spirit of the ""judge according to style"" mentality along with just the general drinkability of this beer, I believe this beer is remarkably average, even good considering some of its brothers in the American macro lager category. The pale, watery, corny presence is accompanied by some real flavor- flavor that is noticeably missing from some of the other super cheap beers like Natty light, etc. A bit sour and salty, really light mouthfeel, with some real (gasp) malt flavor. I don't want to have a lot of these and it's not craft brewed goodness but it is a cheap macro with some substance."
"grain and water, a bad blast of sour corn that thank god fades fast to a finish of blah, 30 cans for 12$, i think i will leave this one for the kids (beer pong, and funnels) and all the things that make collage fun, but if you respect your taste buds you will run as far away from this one as you can, and i dident think you could get any worse than budwiser. i think this goes down as the worst beer that i have ever had"
"So much more drinkable than other low budget beers like Milwaukee's Best, Busch Light and Natural Light that it's not even really funny."
"People always rave about this beer when they come to my liquor store in Florida. ""You have Genny from New York? I drank this all the time!"" So I said why not, I have only been disgusted with every other light beer, why shouldn't this be an exception? Pours a cloudy canary yellow color. Tastes of watery hops and some cereal grains like ground up Cheerios afte they've been sitting in milk for four hours. Cheap as dirt though so I didn't mind spending the 75 cents for the bottle."
"Had this at a frat party. They hand these out free when you get in the door. And there's a reason they use it for Beirut. For fratwater, it's actually above the natty light/busch light. But at the same time, if you get your own, definitely reach to the back of the fridge and get a Sam Adams or even some Schlitz."
"Considering this is a light beer, it is satisfying. It has a pleasing sweetness to it with a mild floral hop aroma. Highly drinkable too. A great bargain at about $6.50 a 12 pack"
"It's the beer that your dad gave you when you were 10 years old. You'd think that it would scare you away from beer drinking forever. In the ensuing 22 years, I have given a lot of other beers a shot; but now I'm back to this. Although it is not as gross as I remembered, it's a far cry from the ales of Dogfish or the Lagers of Germany. It is, however, and adjunct laden, watery mess that is par for the course for it's style. Sweet aromas of cereal grains, raw barley, and metalic hops. The malt profile is timid to the taste, along side of the hop flavors and bitterness. Leaves some sulfer compounds (burned match, cooked corn) and a tart, green apple flavor on the mouth. Quite dry and bitey to the feel and lingers into the terse finish. I guess it's fine if you are fishing with your dad in 1984, but you won't find it in my cellar."
"This beer is OK. Getting past the first few sips may be a struggle, but after that you can get into it. A pretty bitter beer with a malty taste. A pale amber color with a distinct, hoppy smell. Tastes pretty good once you get past the first few sips. Kind of watery, but still a fair representative of a decent beer. Fairly drinkable."
"Appearance is a light pale golden hue with a large bubbled white head leaves behind thin lacing with quickly diminishing foam. Aroma contains sweet corn and rice character with a slight metallic tone and no real hop profile. Taste has cereal grains, corn, and rice; it forms flavor with a touch of creamy sweetness and low hop bitterness making this light beer from upstate NY very unoffensive. Mouthfeel has evident carbonation with light body not as watery as some light beers out there. Drinkability is definitely a beer that can be drank in number however I don't think I would reach for this one on a regular basis."
"Verdict: A very unpleasant light beer when there are much better, even cheapies to get. I couldn't buy one, so I'll have to finish the 12."
"Brew poured to a bight clear yellow color with a nice white head that leaves a fair amount of lacing on the upper section of the glass. The aroma is of toasted grains that also have a cereal/corn quality. Not a bad smelling brew based on the light qualities of the brew. The taste is not bad, probably the best light brew I have (especially with the cost factored in) with the exception of Sam Adams Light. The crisp taste, adequately carbonation and toasted flavors make it quite smooth. It is nothing overly exciting but for me it is a ok brew when you are trying to save a few bucks or drink with friends that more or less enjoy macro brews. Hell, they will think they are drinking the good stuff. Also growing up in NY it was a brew that has a lot of history and family memories."
"I described this beer to my friend as the beer that you would want to pick if you were ever challenged to a beer-drinking contest and you were allowed to pick your own beer. The price is what would attract people to this beer (thats what attracted me). However, there are other cheap beers that are much better."
"The beer had a suprisingly nice golden yellow color in the glass, with about a half inch of head that disappeared very quickly. During the drink, it left very very little lacing. The smell is a killer, slightly reminds me of a urinal. The taste, while crappy when comparing to a non light beer, is still better than just about all other macro lights. There is a strong corn and vegetable taste, but nothing too overpowering. It starts out strong then leaves a subpar grainy aftertaste on the pallette. The mouthfeel is flat, but predictable as there are virtually no bubbles in the glass after the first minute or so. As far as drinkability goes, I'd save it for the hot summer days, the ballpark and the cheap 30 pack for the party."
"Pours the standard macro lager yellow with decent head that dissipated quickly. The aroma is mild as is the flavor, very drinkable if unexciting substitute for bud/miller/coors type beers. I wouldn't turn one down, but I wouldn't go looking for one either."
"Drinkability: This beer is not worth purchasing, as there is so little alcohol that all you can taste are the vegetable flavors."
"This one falls far short of the mark when it comes to Light Lagers. Pours out to nearly the color of clean water, with only a touch of yellow. Small head dissipated rather quickly. Minor notes of lacing. Aroma is not impressive by any means; some adjunct and sweetness is noted, over a watery character that remains constant. Flavor is mild and boring; weak malts and adjunct blend with water and low level hops to produce nothing short of bland and average taste. Mouthfeel was light and watery, typical of the style. Drinkability is fair at best. Go for Genesee Cream Ale instead."
"Drinkability: Beer pong beer only, the dirt from the floor will liven it up."
"Allright here is the deal. Light Ales suck. We all know this. And at the moment i am eating some cheese and crackers. The light ale tastes good with cheese and crackers! This is one worth trying. Taste it on its own. Not that bad eh? yes light beer sucks, but I think this is the least of the suckiest. It doesn't taste like rotting chemical ass. The abv is only 3.6% but thats fine. I can do a 6 pack of the 16 ouncers and not feel much. Doesn't look the best. The label is heinous. But it isn't bad. and it is local."
"Overall-superior to regular Genny due to it's better character and easier drinking but the bland flavor at the end kept it from being rated much higher. The fact that it has flavor should make it notable since many light beers lack it, even if it is bland, who knows maybe someone else will like it. For three bucks a six it will do it a pinch."
"It pours a pale straw gold body beneath a full head of bright white foam that drops shortly to a wide collar and thin surface covering that leaves some nice lacing initially. Not too many bubbles can be seen rising to the surface; and the mouthfeel backs that up. It's carbonation is fairly restrained for the style, and it's more soft and smooth in the mouth than crisp. Some corn-like, sweetish malt (DMS, perhaps?) greets you in the nose and carries over into the flavor. Bitterness is kept to a minimum, and only a hint of hop flavor is found in the finish. A dull residual maltiness and touch of bitterness linger in the mouth and throat along with a touch of soapiness. It's not particularily off-putting, but I'd like to see it a little crisper. Overall, a fairly dull flavored light beer that seems to be lacking a little bit in the ""refreshing"" department."
"As light beers go, this was unoffensive, which is often about all one can hope for. Pale, pale straw. A bit of corn in the aroma. Thin, perhaps just a touch dry, with light, sweet corn adjunct flavors. Very smooth, with no metallic notes. Borders on flavorless, but what flavor one can find is acceptable."
"The beer pours an almost clear color with a pale gold hue. It has a thick frothy white head that quickly fades to lacing. The aroma is average for these macro light beers. It has a very light malt scent with the appearance of adjuncts. It is a bit dry and musty smelling. The taste is not that bad. It has a grainy pale malt flavor that is watered down and surrounded by rice and corn. The mouthfeel is decent. It is an extremely low bodied beer with good carbonation. This is a decent drinking light beer. There is nothing special about it, but it goes down easy and refreshes. Oh yeah, for those who care, it's low on carbs."
"Just remember that this is a light beer. Not supposed to be in your face. If I have a choice between Genny Light and the other lights brewed by the macros I'll take a Genny Light hands down.Pours a clean pale golden color with a crisp white head that lingers quite nicely. Not a lot going on with the aroma a light maltiness as with the flavor. Carbonation is what you'd expect nothing to get in the way of finishing it and having another. Grab your fishing pole and a 12 pack on a nice summer's day and enjoy!"
"A very light yellow color that leads to a foamy head. The smell was very skunky. I have faith in the pub that I had this at, so it had to be the beer, not the lines. The taste was very watery. A small taste of hops, but not anything to brag about. Genny keeps up with the light beer tradition of being just a bad beer."
"I applaude the brewers for attempting to retain some of the original beer's character, and for a light beer I guess this isn't too bad. I place it on the same level as their original Genny, which is below the Cream Ale and the Red Lager."
"At 96 calories, Genny Light is right up there with Miller light in terms of lightness. What Genny has that the Bud/Miller /Coors lights don't is ""character"". That's like saying someone ""really has personality"". That leaves it pretty wide open to interpretation. Hence the mixed reviews on this forum. Here's my take: Upon opening the twist-off cap, the loud ""Pfffst!!!"" foreshadowed the sudsy, gassy pour. I was immediately met with the faint smells of ""Canadian beer skunk"" (I know, Rochester is in New York, but they're neighbors) as well as faint grain and alcohol aromas. Skunky, rubbery flavor with a lot of water. There's a huge hole in the flavor of this beer. The fizzy mouthfeel is too thin and off-putting--much like Michelob Ultra (yuck). Finishes with grainy sweetness and residual skunk funk. But amazingly...it is still better than most cheap American lagers, though!"
"12 oz can. I grew up on Genny, but this was my first try at the genny light. Pours the same straw yellow, with a moderate head that recedes rather quickly, leaving some fine lacing on the glass. The smell doesn't differ much from regular genny and I'd say that was a plus. It still has that genny taste that I'm familiar with, but just a little more watered down. This is another good session beer."
"It is very well balanced and there is a place for this brew in the beer world...not in my fridge just yet, but somewhere."
"Cheap, Genny Light be your name. Light color, whispy head, and that all too familiar lack of taste. This beer is slightly better than most lights, especially if your drinking on the cheap."
"Crisp and grainy with a cooked corn grit flavour, cheap 6-row malt flavour perhaps also  too light to really tell. Semi-crisp and very light bodied. Bland and watered down but that is what it is supposed to taste like. As I said with the can review, dont waste your money on expensive light beers, this one is just fine to keep you slim  YEAH RIGHT!!!"
"Light yellow golden in color with quickly dissappearing head.  Light bodied with seltzer like quality.  Mildly bitter with a hint of cooked corn/rice sweetness.  Very unassuming.  Better than most macro light beers."
"One of the more flavorful light beers."
