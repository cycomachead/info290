Smooth, really, really crisp - balanced and well hopped. I'd say the abv is a little low for my purposes but when you're out with the boys it gets the job done.

The end result is an odd melange of metallic, sour, and bitter. Suffice it to say, it doesn't taste good at all. The body is pretty light, with a moderate carbonation and a watery feel.

It's weak, but much stronger than I was expecting. The sweet is fairly non-descript. Corn and wet cardboard. The hops are light, like a Hallertauer. Tastes watery with a very mild sweet, pizza crust (imagine a really thin and cardboardy crust that's got no toppings), and a noticable hop flavor in the tongue. The hops come on stronger in the back of the throat during the aftertaste. Carbonation is only md-heavy, but still contributes a bit of sting to the flavor. Especially in the aftertaste, where it comes across as iron. thin body but with some dextrinous cling. Simple and much better than I was anticipating.

A generic beer aroma greets you in the nose with some mild, sweetish adjunct-laden malt, a spritz of hops, and a delicate waft of yeasty sulphur. The body is light and its fine-bubbled carbonation lends a gentle zest to the tongue. The flavor is limited, even for a light beer, but it's very well-balanced. It finishes almost without notice, leaving behind a trace amount of generic beer flavor that fades quickly.

I now routinely buy $30 cases of interesting micros and actually find it painful to consume this and other $8/ case $35/ keg beers with my drunken cohorts on the weekends. Anyways, Beast is nothing special. Pours a very thin white head off the kegerator in my living room. Roomates insit upon it, even though I have swindled an occasional keg of Boston Ale or other closeout special in there. Light yellow color, stale grain nose, abdundant carbonation. Not as watery as other super cheap macro lights and certainly drinkable when served cold. Allow it to warm on a table while playing drinking games, and it becomes 'open your gullet and suck' drinkable. What can one say? There's a market for this beer, and it is enjoyed by many. I wish I could enlighten some of these folks and show them the pleasures of a weizenbock or an imperial stout, but alas, beer appreciation is something that one arrives at on his own accord.

The taste was of weak weak hops, and a hint of watered-down malt base. The beer finished rather dry, with no aftertaste, which was a bit of a relief. I can only imagine what the aftertaste might have been. Mouthfeel was a bit like club soda...the artificial carbonation was on prominent display.
