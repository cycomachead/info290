It does not try to be different or interesting in anyway, But if I'm going to drink a wheelbarrow of it like god intended its the best for that in my opinion. So on to its taste, This is the hardest part for me it taste like water with beer flavoring, kind of like beef flavored Ramen, tastes nothing like beef but has a hind of beef flavor to it. But at the same time I have no idea why I like or keep buying maybe its the marketing, maybe its the fact that I've drank so much Pabst at this point that if I drink anymore I'll go into shock and start foaming from the mouth. but most of all its the best of the worst in my mind, bud is for Necks and southerners, and miller, I have no idea who drinks that shit other then hipsters. But for the rest of us at a sporting event or really anywhere that you need to drink 5 beers in 45 mins Coors is the beer of choice. here to Coors and here's to 'Merica!!!!","wseroyer","Sep 29, 2014"

2.29,13.9,,,,,,"Overall (2.29) : I do keep this on hand in my fridge from time to time. Awhile back I logged on and reviewed Keystone Light on its own merit and reflected against this beer, because rumor has it it's the same recipe from the same brewer but a little more stale. I can confirm that they taste similar - but Coors light has a bite, crispness, and fresh taste that Keystone lacks. I think it's the difference between a crisp apple and one left out for a day. Keystone compounds that lack of crispness with adding extra smoothness so it's in fact the opposite mouthfeel of Coors light. I like it better than Keystone. As for whether its worth the extra price, well, I don't know. I do know I'd reach for this over keystone light in an ice cooler. It's the superior product. Better than bud light, not as good as miller lite. So there you have it.","The-Adjunct-Hippie","Sep 15, 2014"

I thought it was a bit stronger than bud light. At this point, I was kind of wanting to try stronger beers. So it was a refreshing change, while still being inoffensive.  Now, i drank it today after having some the other day. It has no flavor to speak of. Its kind of sweet though. Its nothing really memorable.  Poured into glass gently so there would be no foam. The foam really makes me sick to my stomach. So light beer is really good because of that.   pale golden liquid. Never actually seen it out of the bottle till today.  Its smell is kind of sweet.  Its inoffensive. I can't really taste anything other than a slight beer taste. Very forgettable. Its good for me to drink when i get thirsty. I would buy it again.

I figured that a poor tasting beer would slow me down, and maybe enjoy the better beers a lot more. Well, after a few years of Coor's light, it has slowed me down. I quit when I should, and get some sleep. While I prefer a hefe-weizen for quenching my thirst, the Coors is fine for the times when the lawn must be mowed.and it is hot outside. In that regard, Coor's light is OK. While I do not recommend it as an All-American beer, it seems to taste a bit better than any other light beer I have tried.","Rickwolfe","Jul 13, 2014"

This is a beer for sitting outside on a hot day drinking and talking with friends, or a light drink whenever the thirst comes for it. This is a beer that can go down fast, and drunkenness would come fast (because it's so easy to drink). Reminds me of those crystal light water flavorings, but in beer flavor -its light and tastes like water. This is not a full flavored beer to sit and slowly sip. Just a simple brew with little flavor. I think it is okay.","Organdrew","Jun 17, 2014"

I've never made so many mistakes for under the cost of Whopper meal - which, appropriately enough, will be some undergrad's main source of sustenance at 3:00am this Saturday night. It's a table beer. Not the kind you enjoy for the taste, the look, or to promote your local Rockies. It's sole purpose, in the opinion of this lowly beer enthusiast, is to get you where you need to be (am I right, fellas?). More so, it's your gateway brew to better and bolder beers. Coors Light is what I started drinking before I became better acquainted with the wide world of ales and lagers. I, like so many other rebellious youth, was introduced to this great and diverse realm of beer by the welcoming, but not above mediocre, drinkability of Coors Light.

But of the light beers I've had, this is the "best" of the lot. And another thing I've learned - your typical big, American brewery, or for that matter, big brewery beer just doesn't cut it for me any more. The craft beers I focus on are way better than the glut of stuff you find in WalMart. Anyway, Coor Light for all of its advertising is just a tiny bit better than ok - when nothing else is offered...","jjamadorphd","Apr 26, 2014"

Little to no flavor, very watery. Foamy when poured, but almost scentless, airy foam. Serves the purpose of high volume drinking, useful at least for playing games or long days involving heavy consumption, but otherwise purposeless beer. No idea why anyone would pay for this for any reason other than to drink without feeling too full.","thefullmontiii","Apr 25, 2014"

I could make associations to sparkling water, corn and minerals. The mouthfeel is expectedly light with fizzy carbonation. Flavor notes are again quite mild with suggestions of seltzer water, canned corn and distant grains. A notion of European hops could be sensed with enough concentration. Coors Light is very true to the macro-adjunct lager style. It could be improved, in my opinion, with a bit more character from the barley and hop bill.","NachlamSie","Apr 13, 2014"

It has a good taste and no after taste. Though a little watery tasting if your looking for some thing light this is it as far as I am concerned.

Poured into a pilsner glass, the head quickly disipates into the yellow-gold donkey piss that they are mislabeling as beer. Nice sweet metallic taste. Thank God they had the "cold indicator" on there. I tried to tell by touching it, but just couldn't be sure and didn't have the balls to try it. This stuff makes Coors original taste more like a Boston Lager. They don't even have good tv spots anymore. Remember when they used "man on the silver mountain" ? Seriously, is anyone reading this? I am just reviewing to kill time at my daughter's dance practice. There is no way anyone is really looking at Coors Light reviews for any reason other than their daily dose of sarcasm. I could probably keep my bank account login information safe here. Anyway, if you feel like drinking a light beer, drink liqour. But if you want a good light AAL, this is not a good one. I would recommend Yuengling Light","WesMantooth","Feb 01, 2014"

As I'm sure most of us on here are not generally fans of American mega brewery light "beers" (I have a hard time calling this beer), I think Coors light stands above them all as probably the worst mass produced brew from any major company. It is simply too watered down to be an enjoyable beer, and I will sadly admit that I think less of people when they order it.","aqualung23","Dec 24, 2013"

Now it's so entrenched in the masculine ideal that if you're not chugging a can of this and crushing it against your skull when you're through, you're a pussy. This is the swill I proudly drank straight through high school and right into my latter college days. It's meant to pander to the lowest common denominator, and it does just that. Its advantages are that it is ubiquitous, affordable, and lacking in any offensive character. Its drawbacks are that it really lacks any meaningful taste or character at all, it's low in alcohol and as drinkable as seltzer water. What's manly about that?","ryan1788a5","Dec 14, 2013"

A little bit of tangy, but really stretching to find even that. Flavors are toasted forward, with a butter and grainy character throughout, and literally nothing more. Very watery body, with a crispness from the extremely high amount of carbonation throughout the body. Very sharp, overly crisp finish, with a grainy aftertaste.

Pale straw in appearance with a soapy head that dissapates quickly but still maintains a small layer of bubbles on the surface of the cup. Aroma is tangy, metallic, lightly sweet vegetable, lightly grainy. No discernible aroma of hops whatsoever. Flavor follows nose with a tangy, sour metallic flavor dominating; hard to pinpoint any real descriptive flavors or anything that is close to cereal grains or hops. Mouthfeel is very thin but thicker than water, and the carbonation is lighter than it's canned counterpart. Not sure if this is a good example of a light American lager or not. It is a different drink entirely than what i would consider a "real beer", but I'm trying to be as unbiased as possible. It's certainly quaffable as a thirst quenching alcoholic beverage, but the enjoyment that comes from drinking an ale or lager made with flavor and craftsmanship cannot be obtained by consuming a Coors light. Zero complexity and negligible flavor.","Aaron_Ramson","Aug 16, 2013"

Yes, this will go down fast (if you can stand the smell and taste), but in the end it's just another very light beer. Good for frat parties but bad for those who are looking for a quality brew.

As light beer compared to the other two its very very light with a watery look, very pale even more then bud and miller. The head foams and goes away like most light beers with no to little head left. The smell is a little sweetness, corn or some mix of veggies. The taste is a little sweet up front with the corn and veggie mix coming through midway, ending in a little bitterness maybe from the hops haha. Bud light and miller are sweeter, this is a little more tame on the sweetness and has a little bitter bite on the back end that makes me like it better then b/m. The mouthfeel along with the taste are water of course right, it is light beer. I mean this beer is still beer enough for me to enjoy it at a party, bbq, beach. I don't care how much people hate this shit or say its not craft beer I can't drink it, ill drink this any day on a beach or just simply throwing back cans with friends.

But it is refreshing and when served cold as recommended it can hit the spot if it's what you were after. It's simple and not offensive, and sometimes that's good enough.

This beer poured out as a clear yellow color with a very fast fading white head on top. The beer has some carbonation bubbles that rise to the top on occasion. The smell of the beer is mostly aromas of corn and other sweet grains. The taste is very bland, I'd say it lacks everything in the flavor/taste category. The mouthfeel is watery, thin and boring. Overall it's nothing to be proud of, it's got no depth or anything. Avoid it, because there is nothing good about it.","Knapp85","Dec 30, 2012"

I don't drink light beer. I prefer the full flavor. But this is the only light beer I deal with. Curing a headache with one as I type this. There's not much taste. Weak malt, hops, and water. Easy drinking. But mightily refreshing because of the sharp, crisp carbonation. Maybe I'm ok with this beer because I have good memories of crushing countless cans of Coors out by a particular pool over a period of a few days this summer. It grew on me.

But the taste is a nice change from the normal, It's almost like they actually take their time making this stuff. Yes I said it, An American Lager that actually has some time put into it! Imagine that!. I don't get why it has such a bad rep on here. The mouthfeel is nice as well with the usual lager fizziness. And I was surprised at the low alcohol content since I was actually buzzing off of 4 bottles of the stuff. So the next time you're about to pick up that 6 pack of Bud Light or any other basic cheap lager, Grab this instead.","SometimesIfart","Jun 16, 2012"

As to the beer itself, it is a very mild brew with scant aroma or flavor. What is to be found in this brew is a clean, crisp mineral note, a sweet floral hint and very light grain nuances. The feel is like sparkling water, which is not unusual for the style. Overall, this is a reasonably inoffensive brew as long as it is cold.

Pours a light yellow color, with small to no head (depending on pour) and little lacing. Smell is unremarkable, as is taste, but it is a cool refreshing AMERICAN ADJUNCT LAGER, and if one can accept it for what it is, then good. This is a decent cheap beer to enjoy when at a ballpark, out at a BBQ or picnic or family gathering where beer snobbery/"more educated palates" do not prevail.

This beer seemed like the best option on tap, and figuring it had to be better than the Chelada, I ordered a pint. Light yellow in color, fizzy, with a sparkling white head. I took the beer outside, sat down and drank deeply, tasting glorious nothingness...no tomato, no pickle, no coors. Just refreshing sparkling nothingness. The beer recalibrate my palate, enabling me to resume drinking in earnest the following day. Thank you, Coors.","emmasdad","Jul 01, 2011"

Once the cap is twisted however it's all down hill. The color is pale yellow, almost watery with a head that doesn't wait for the beer to stop being poured, it disappears so fast that one would think there's no carbonation in there. Now the taste and smell, or rather, lacks thereof, they're both so weak and insipid as to be nonexistent. Water has more flavor than this. Okay, I waited for dinner and thought the food would improve it. WRONG. The food completely overpowered it. How the hell does Chicken pot pie overwhelm a beer? Any and all flavor completely vanished like washing your food down with a glass of water. The mouthfeel was thin and watery and for the rest of the evening I switched to pepsi and root beer. Needless to say the drinkability was zero. And if you wonder why I gave it 1.5 on the smell and taste ratings, it's that it isn't awful, just bland and weak.","saradad","Jan 04, 2009"

As I waited for over an hour for the beer to completely liquify, I grew impatient and asked my buddy Sean for a beer. It was a choice of either Coors Light or Bud Light, and I, of course, took the Coors Light. I opened the can, and the light, airy smell drifted towards my nose. As I detected the scent, I asked myself one question: Why, God, why would anyone brew, much less DRINK, this beer!? I don't quite know what it tasted like, because there was so little to taste. The thing was horribly pale in color, and smelled just how it tasted: with less malt than one would find in chocolate milk shake. Are there even hops in there? I couldn't find 'em. It did manage a mighty 2 in the mouthfeel category, because of its cool smoothness combined with a mild amount of carbonation. The drinkability is non-existent, as the beer made me nauseous.
