The nose is nearly nonexistent, with only a vague powdered-sugar-like sweetness and a mild cornmeal finding their ways to my 'strils. The taste holds notes of hard water, rocks, very light and vague vegetable matter, and a tiny touch of sweetness. Man, this stuff is more like weird-tasting water than a beer. The body is pretty damn light, with a light moderate carbonation and an unsurprisingly watery feel. Overall, a pretty sad beer. ...I got nuthin else...","TMoney2591","Sep 14, 2011"

It has a smooth, pilsner malt flavor that goes down quick and easy with a bone dry finish. It doesn't taste much different from the original. The mouthfeel is fine.

1.77,-30.3,3,1,2,1.5,2,"Why? Why the hell not? I'm going to clear the air here and say that I am a sucker for a stubby bottle, cute little bastards get me every time. Oh and if it would have come in that weird 10.5oz clear bottle seen over there, well buddy I wouldn't have purchased it. Well, I don't know about that 10.5 oz is one odd size, and I like odd sized bottles too. I don't think I like them the way I like stubby bottles though, there is just this sort of romantic feeling I get from a stubby bottle. I can't quite grasp why this is not the standard, the design seems so much more ""drinky"" if I may, so much more conducive to drinking beer than the long neck. I don't know why I feel this way, it's a psychological thing really and there is nothing in this world I can do to explain it. I am very lucky though, a new brewery in Iowa (Peace Tree Brewing) is bottling exclusively in stubbys. The cool thing about Peace Tree is that I love their beer, which basically means that I'll not be swayed by the undeniable charm of the Red Stripe bottle again. Arevaderche Jamaican Lager, hola Hop Wrangler. On with the rating now, this beer pours a very pale yellow color with a nice medium sized tight head. I swear to you that the first thing I detect in the aroma of this beer is chicken, crock pot roasted chicken. It's a pretty specific smell, and one that I am very familiar with. When I come home from work to find the aroma of the chicken I was forced to wake up a whole ten minutes early that morning to throw into a cooking device my Aunt Nancy & Uncle Don gave me, this is a joyous smell. But it serves very little if any place in the world of beer. I guess this is one of those things that makes me realize how damned inexperienced of a brewer I am. Oh my beers suffer from all the usual problems, a bit tart here, a little vegetal there, maybe a bit too many hops for this style, or a damned thin mouth feel. But never in my life have I come across any sort of process or technical flaw that would make my beer smell like a roasted chicken. Just damned fascinating. Along with the chicken we've got some complimentary aromas, some corn and some herbal hoppiness. The flavor for all it's short comings is so much of a relief as compared to the aroma that I'm happy as CAN BE to be drinking as opposed to smelling this. The beer is basically dry, and very light on flavor but has some bright maltiness, a little corn, and some distinct noble hoppiness. This is very refreshing, but it is also very light. I have no problem with beers being light, in fact I am very for it, but this one certainly falls under that sacrificing flavor for levity thing very strongly. People are purchasing this for nine dollars a six pack, that is really happening. Surreal. This reminds me that I need to roast a chicken.","BieresDesMoines","May 09, 2010"

Thin speckled lacing not much an eye candy appeal here. Aroma has a grainy cooked vegetable grassy tone to it. Slightly metallic tone going on as well it's really hard to describe because there's not much there. Flavor is light crisp malt sweetness with some harsh grassy herbal tones blended with a metallic finish. Mouthfeel is ligt on the palate but carbonation is really heav for some reason, definitely force carbonated.

Better on a hot day in Jamaica than Dragon Stout for sure.","aforbes10","May 22, 2004"
1.45,-42.9,1.5,1.5,1.5,1,1.5,"and the Red Stripe Light they had on tap did not cheer me up much. The regular Red Stripe was warm and I wanted a cold beer. The color was a sickly yellow with a thin head. It's not that the aroma was awful, but more that there was simply no aroma. The taste was corn and rice, no malts or hops. While it looked carbonated (big bubbles and all) the mouthfeel was flat. I could see being able to drink this beer, but the closest comparison I can think of is carbonated tap water.","MuddyFeet","Beers"
