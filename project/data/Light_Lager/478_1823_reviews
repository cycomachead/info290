"It's as bad as Keystone."
"A nice option when it's hot and out fishing. Can drink them all day in the heat with little or no effect."

"Good beer for parties and very light. Perfect for drinking games. Very clear color and good taste for a light beer. Way ahead of Miller Lite."

"Really, I have to justify my rating with a review?  Look, it's just a beer, a cheap light beer.  No, it's not what I'd buy, and after a year and a half in Rochester, this was the first time I tried it, so that tells you something right there.  But if you go to a friend's house and they offer you beer, you drink it, and you don't make a big deal about the extreme inferiority of the beer compared to what you usually drink.  So my 2.whatever rating is an ""outlier"" - fine.  Okay, justified?"

"DATE TASTED: January 18, 2015... GLASSWARE: Hennepin pokal ... OCCASION: Seahawks/Packers--what an ending... APPEARANCE: clear, golden body that releases sparse bubbles; off-white hand sloughs off to an uneven quarter-inch; soapy lacing... AROMA: some fragrant hops suggest a somewhat sophisticated premium lager; however, doughy malts make clear the beer's style... PALATE: reasonably, light, oily and watery consistency; highly drinkable and cleansing; as beers go, quite weak...TASTE: light hops tease faintly as flowers; malts suggest some beefy dough, but as expected, a lukewarm offering...OVERALL: perfect for a day of mindless drinking only, this is too weak to pair with food and not worth sessioning..."

"O - Hops made it somewhat enjoyable. This is better than MCB light beer, but I'm not buying this one again."
""
""
""
""

"Overall: Its clearly an average beer at best. During college I drank quite a few labatt blue lights and enjoyed them. My appreciation for beer has changed now though and I would consider this beer nothing special but something I will drink when on special when I am out for dinner."

"No hops to taste, no malt flavors that you'd TYPICALLY get in a craft beer... just a mild cereal grain flavor, with corn, and subtle sweetness. It costs a bit more than a made-in-America adjunct lager, and it tastes basically the same. Still, I think I'd choose a Labatt Light over a Bud Light, Coors Light, or even Miller Lite."
""
""
""
""
""
"When I had Labatt Blue light it was on tap at a bar. The coloring was a light yellow/clear and I had the aroma of corn in it for sure and a little malty. The taste was a little blan probably because it was light and not just Labatt Blue. It was also medium carbonated."
""
"notes: this is product. weak, insip, boring. hated it. Amazingly this beer sells like crazy here in Rochester which makes no sense as Genny is much better, and a lot cheaper."

"For a major light lager, it's not bad compared to some of the others. It lacks flavor. Just mostly sweet and light."

"O - Overall, this was a less than standard light lager that I wouldn't buy again. You can get a "" Value Pack "" at Kroger which consists of twenty cans for eleven dollars. This is something that you bring to a party for everyone else, That way nobody asks for ( And usually wastes ) your good beer."
""
""
""
""
"Marginally better than a Bud Light, but still, this is probably closer to water than it is to beer. Not much happening at all."

"I love this beer. It is affordable and gets the job done when needed. I live in Tennessee and am happy to find it at my local Krogers now. I used to only get it when visiting family in Michigan. The thing I love about going up north is that in the winter, we leave the beer outside and it is the perfect temperature. I love it when it is slushy."
"as the crappy light mass market stuff goes, i dont hate this in a bottle thats ice cold. drafts and cans of this are almost intolerable, but the bottle can work on a hot day out in the boat or something. golf course maybe. pours watery pale yellow like so many beers like this do, decent head though. smells like basically nothing, just some weak generic malts. flavor is refreshing at least, but it has nothing intersting to call out. quick snappy finish probably helps it sell as well as it does. mouthfeel is very light and a little too carbonated, but i will give it high marks for drinkability. overall its a step up from a budlight, but so is everything. only when i have to..."

"Overall: To be honest, do not care for this beer. However I could enjoy it on a very hot day with no other drink available."

"O: Very light an easy to drink and refreshing when it is really cold. Sessionable but not a beer that I'm going to go back to often - maybe best served when fishing. Definitely recommend drinking this beer when it is very cold."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This isn't a great beer, but for the style it has more flavor than most others. It's drinkable and refreshing. This isn't my style of choice, but this is a light beer I wouldn't mind having again."
"Overall – As for light beers, this is not the greatest to say the least. If you really want a light beer do something like a Sam Adams light or a other lower abv. beers (such as Guinness Draught). This is not the best."
""
""
""
""
"The color is clear straw and bubbly, with something of a head and no lacing. Malt scent. Basically what you would expect."

"Labatt Blue Light is number two....gonna drink it with my left over pizza. The beer pours a clear yellow color with an intial foamy white head that dissapates to nothing. The smell and taste is typical...grain with mild hop just enought to attempt to balance the beer. The mouthfeel is light and carbonation is big. Overall is typical....drinkable....but not notable."
""
""
"O - when you've gotta drink something, drink something else."
""
""
""
""
"Overall – It's odd that this beers slogan used to be 'If I wanted a water, I'd ask for it'.. it's actually pretty watery and tasteless It also has too much carbonation. Not something I intend on having again, but I didn't turn it away when someone offered me it."

"overall, my score pretty much says it all ""not impressed"". im sure ill be drinking this just to ""fit in"" and ""look cool", but i will never ever buy this. i would however support labatt over AB anyday, but thats not saying much."
"O - an average light beer."
"This is not a fun way to get buzzed. I'd rather slam a shot of Jack Daniel's then do push ups. And I am NOT a whiskey guy. I feel like I'm at a really boring, really stupid party when I have this. Give me a beer I can have the least bit of passion for."
"Avoid. Unless of course, as in my case, a very nice old lady insists you have a cold beer and relax. (Well meaning relative)"
"O: Let's face it, for the most part adjunct lagers are the same thing across the board, but this one is definitely not very good. So watery it is even hard to call this one beer. I can understand how they can sell millions of these though, as your average beer drinker loves these light drinking and thirst quenching alcoholic beverages. Not a good beer. Not a good beer at all. But it was in my fridge so I drank it."
"Pale yellow beer with a fleeting, foamy head. Dry grain aroma with some faint bready notes. Flavors of grain and grass. Very dry, taste that alternates between tangy and watery. I feel like I'm drinking a really bad adjunct lager that's been watered down to mask the flavor. This stuff is just...lousy."
"The beer pours a sickly looking thin straw yellow color with a thick white head and actually a little lacing. It smells of crisp recently husked corn and some hay bales. Just like I imagine Kansas to be. Tastes of corn and sweetness. Unrelenting sweetness. Mouthfeel is thin, watery, and heavily carbonated. Overall, it isn't the worst beer in the world, but it certainly isn't good at all."
"Pours a clean/clear golden yellow color, nice carbonation, little fizzy white head, minimal sticky lacing. The nose is slightly malty, but mostly grainy. The taste is kinda malty, grainy/ricy. Light Body. Kinda Drinkable, not that bad, but still... I use to really like the regular version moons ago."
"D- Out of every light Light Lager this one actually has some flavor, yes there is a lot of watered down taste to it, but it does have a nice taste. It goes down smooth (and less filling) and its cheap. Good for a long day of drinking."
"This is a beer that is probably good for bulk consumption at parties and that's about it. Not a beer I would recommend."
"D- Easy as water, but tasteless and boring"
"Drinkability well these are only tolerable post hockey game when there's no real options.... so Fridays..."
"Not a fan..."
"Poured into a pint glass. The color is a pretty light golden color. A good dose of carbonation bubbles and a semi-decent white head. The nose is a bit grainy without much there. Nothing horrifically off-putting, though there is a bit of a metallic astringency, which starts to come out more in the flavor and especially the feel. Not a good beer and I would not recommend this."
"Didn't expect much, and didn't get much from this. Meh."
"D - This beer is good for sessioning on a hot day in the sun and not much else."
"overall i have ha worse, but this was not terrible for a light beer. still though a little more of anything would have helped."
"This beer has few of the attributes that define a beverage as ""Beer"". It IS a good thirst quencher on a hot, humid afternoon in Summer. Beyond that, there is little to discuss. It has a clean, crisp mouthfeel and goes down easily. No aroma to speak of, no taste, no buzz! The slightly tart tang is carbonic acid (Co2 in solution) and the beer closely resembles carbonated water in character. As I said, it's refreshing, but so is soda water. I suspect it would also do a bang up job of cleaning my windshield. As`soon as I can finish this case I will buy something else and never do this again. In fairness, it isn't BAD, there just isn't anything there! Prosit, Wilyum"
"D:very drinkable for someone just not me."
"A great cheap ""Domestic"" (for those of you who live in Northern New York)"
"This is Canada's version of budweiser and it doesn't even come close to the king of beers. The only thing different in their process must be where they are getting water from. The water from Lake Ontario must not be as fresh as the water in St. Louis (or where ever my local Anheuser-Busch plant is) because this stuff tastes like pond water."
"Lots of visible carbonation in this pale yellow beer. The steady stream of bubbles isn't enough to sustain the poorly retained head. Very mild grainy aroma. It barely even has an aroma. Tastes like lightly sweetened seltzer. Feels thin and watery with an odd slickness. Prickly carbonation. Guests went to town on the PBR at yesterdays barbecue, this got left behind. It's cold and wet, and it's drinkable, but I'd rather have beer that tastes like beer."
"24 oz can, 2 for $3, couldn't pass it up, that's $4.50 a six pack if you have your calculator out. Not your typical Canadian brew this is only 4% ABV and not the regular 5% ABV. Let's give it a whirl. This brew has a sweet Euro lager smell of spritzy hops. Pours to a pale yellow with a thin white head. Taste is consistent with the Euro lager smell. Very sweet and light with only a slight twinge of earthy hops evident. Mouthfeel is very thin but it isn't watery per se and that should be in line for a light lager. For the price you can get this for its a macro bargain and not at all offensive. It's not bold but it is quite drinkable. This is a lawnmower beer extraordinaire."
"Beer pong: 5.0."
"God help any of you with real money who choose this over real beer."
"Poured from a 16 oz. can. Has a very pale yellow color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is mild, some corn and malts. Taste is also mild, again malts and corn. Feels light in the mouth and has decent drinkability. Overall this is not the worst light beer I have had, but nothing special."
"Cheers!"
"There was one bottle sitting in my fridge for months and I'm not sure where it came from. I wanted something to drink/review and didn't feel like going out so there it is."
"As usual, the beer-as-literal-water trope works here, and at least the off-flavours are kept to a minimum. My lack of sleep is kind of giddy about the what this can of swill cost - but hey, the small bottle of water is about the same price, so, what the hell."
"On nights I feel like a 12 pack session this one is not a bad pick"
"A fairly pale urine yellow color and crystal clear with zero head. Scent is very faint. Just some adjunct sweetness is really all I can pick up. Taste is awful and there is no freshness date on the can. Unfortunately, this is a 24oz. can so I've got about ten ounces to go after polishing off the first glass. Taste has the sweetness of corn and a touch of honey. I'm glad this is watered down, because I'd have a hard time stomaching a stronger version of this particular taste. I'll not be revisiting this."
"Drinkability: Disappointing and groan-inducing, though, being the light version of the Labatt blue, it's at least less awful."
"Overall a typical light beer. Easy to drink."
"Mouthfeel is light bodied, medium carbonation, goes down easy. I feel like this was hydrating me. As macro light swill goes, this wasn't the worst I've ever had."
"I'm not even gonna break down each catagory. Everything that could go wrong with a beer is present in LBL. It tastes bad, smells a little like something spoiled? I dont even know what, but the taste is yucky. How could a respectable brewer put this product on the shelves? Light beer fiends that don't belong to BA probably love this stuff. They think it saves calories so they immediately buy it and pretend to like it becuase they think its healthy. Overall, I'd buy keystone light over this any day of the week, which says a lot about how i feel about LBL."
"It began with a finger of bone-white head, but it quickly lapsed into wisps. Color was a pale straw-yellow with NE-quality clarity. Nose was lightly sweet with cereal. Mouthfeel was thin-to-medium with a light, lager sweetness on the tongue. Finish was light, airy, mildly sweet. Ho freakin' hum! I feel like I am drinking the same beer in a CAN over and over with only the label as any change. Doesn't anybody have any imagination? No wonder people could not identify their ""favorite"" brand in ""Beer Wars"" - it's all the same! NOT impressed!"
"Drinkability: While this isn't completely awful, it's probably not going to be high on my list of beers to get again."
"cheers"
"This also begs the question, why the hell would you even want to drink it? Either have water or have a MGD64. About half the calories of this beer and twice the flavor."
"Drinkability - if this is ice cold it will make do, but barely. Not a good choice but goes down if you have no other."
"Of all the light beers I've had, I don't recall giving one an F because they were incredibly weak, bland and flavorless but there was no gross taste or funk. This one has that. Funk in the smell, funk in the taste. It's what makes a light a D-, then you add a gross element of nasty. The mouthfeel's about the same as any light, but it's slicker (slimier?). There's an astringent tinge and the nasty funk is actually more than the aroma or flavor of the beer itself. At least the grains do exist and there's a very light citrus bite. Otherwise, I think this is officially the worst beer I've ever had."
"The good news is that it drinks quickly. Analyzing this in detail doesn't do it justice - I can drink this at a bar in Buffalo all night. Doable for plastic cup fare. That's about it."
"D- You could drink this like water if you wanted to tie one on. No other reason to drink this."
"This beer pours a clear very pale straw color. The head is a quarter inch of foam which recedes within seconds to almost no lacing. The aroma is rather lively for a light lager. It has some nice mildly sweet malty tones to it. The taste again is quite bodl for the style. The is a nice sweetness that I would expect from a adjunct lager. The mouthfeel is light bodied with solid carbonation. It is nice that the carbonation isn't extra high the way it is in most beers of this style. Overall, this is one of the better light lagers I've tasted, and I could drink it again."
"Drinkability- Null and Void"
"Drinkability is bad. I wouldn't be drinking this if I hadn't been given it. I wouldn't pair it with anything, and I can't understand why it even exists.."
"Pours a clear, pale yellow. 1/3 inch head of a white color. Slight retention and slight lacing. Smells of a yeast cleanliness, tart malt, and some metallic - adjunct aromas. Fits the style of a Light Lager. Mouth feel is smooth and crisp with an average carbonation level. Tastes of yeast, metallic - adjunct, and slight pale malt. Smooth overall, slightly better than average light lager."
"Pours a ultra light pale gold,lots of carbonation,and a thin white head.Aroma of sour skunky metallic corn,but not as horrible as the other macros.Flavor is slightly corny,and thin,a little sweet and skunky but again not horrible. Drinkable and not too bad for a light"
"D - This is one of those beers thats made to be easy to drink where you don't have to think about all the flavors and smells you just drink it and watch some hockey."
"(rated Jun 26, 2008)"
"This came out of the 710 ml. can with the scenic new design. Can no. 1-159-8-1853D. Labatt may have redesigned the can for the American market but it hasn't changed this recipe. It pours golden with short-lived whte head and a lot of cabonation. Aroma of corn, wheat, and stale malts. Watery. Tastes flat."
"- Drinkability - The stereotypical light beer. Very good for drinking lots of, say at college."
"Honestly, most of the homebrews I taste are better than this. I don't understand why people drink light beers. Read the nutritional info on a beer, there aren't many calories. Beer is healthy and delicious and there is no excuse for buying any light beer."
"D - Eh. I want to say I've had worse but all of these guys are about the same. Unoffensive at least."
"Beers like this serve a function, but let's not pretend ""to taste good"" is one of them. These erviews are supposed to be constructive and not just bash beer, so here goes: something could change in this watery light beer, such as more malt, or better ingredients; that might help."
"this was the best beer at my grandmas birthday party so i gave it a shot, i have hated this beer for years, this was tasting like it had been on the shelves for far to long, this had minamal hop presence and a caned corn flavor but just barly then it was washed down by a watter fall, i think that thay tryed to strip this one of all flavor, this is a beer that should never be consumed even if it were the last beer on earth"
"Not a bad beer as a spacer. No bad taste characteristics, mostly because there is littel taste."
"Wow. This beer is light alright. Like the brewmaster walked near a keg of water. Amazingly it does have some head and lace. Super pale yellow in color. Very heavy carbonation. Very sharp flavor and body. Sharp flavor of what? mmmaybe a bit of malt? No hop that I can find. Better than tainted water I guess."
"[Macro] Light Lager style is my least favorite style of beer. Labatt Blue Light is not the best light beer or the worst one either."
"Just no point in drinking this and can't think of any good reason for the Canadians to make it."
"Clear golden yellow body with a thin patch of white foam, not unlike Blue. I see the sweet corn malt characterizes the nose as well; little else emerges, sadly. Not bad for a light beer, smoother than Budweiser to me, crisp, clean, certainly uncomplicated. Embarrassingly thin mouthfeel, as if bereft of texture--a downer. In sum, a moderately lighter version of Blue. Not the worst light beer I've ever had, but not one to seek out and consume. I'd avoid."
"A faint, airy aroma of some cheap beer ingredients and that's it. A sharp, carbonated feel on my tongue is the taste, like I was drinking a shaken up soda. No hops or malts or any real taste is in here although it does leave a drying sensation on the backbite, so you know you're drinking a beer. I don't see the point in this and I'm pissed I bothered in the first place."
"D: For a macro, mediocre drinkability but with a slightly off finish that hurts the enjoyment."
"Overall - I'd rather get a soda or just plain water. Yuck."
"The website says, ""Crisp, clean and delicately balanced in its flavour delivery. A hint of aromatic hop with slight sweetness and fruity character."" That really sums this beer up perfectly, not. Pours pale yellow with a white head. Almost no aroma, very light malts and yeast. Watery body with almost no flavor. It's drinkable, but so is water. I think I'll have a water."
"Labatt Blue is a Buffalo favorite. If you were to walk into any bar in Buffalo your sure to find Labatt Blue or Blue Light on tap or in bottles. Labatt Blue Light pours a pale yellow color with a big foamy white head. It has good carbonation and clarity. The aroma and flavor is similar to regular Labatt Blue but lighter. The aroma has rice cereal malts and grassy straw like hops in the nose. The flavor has light sweet cereal malts up front that turn dry with a crisp citrusy bitter finish. ""Blue Light"" is light bodied, thin and a highly drinkable Canadian pilsner. It's a great beer for watching hockey [GO SABRES] and calories. It also pairs well with a traditional Buffalo style fish fry."
""
"I've never actually had this beer. No, wait, I think I may have drunken some of this swill in Montreal or something. But I really don't have to drink it to know it tastes like moose piss. You would think that ""Moosehead"" beer would taste more like the piss of a moose, but lo and behold here comes Labatt Blue Light! Does that sound about right? Well Labatt Blue Light, I've won this round, but the next time we meet I may just have to chug you as fast as possible because you're the cheapest draft beer in all of motherfucking Canada. Oh yeah, and Canadian people don't honor bets. I have proof."
"D-Ugh... um, this is DECENT if you're playing beer pong or something... Don't get it confused for something you actually want to taste though."
"Labatt makes good commercials, however. That's gotta count for something."
"This beer poured a yellowish clear color with an almost nonexistent head. The scent is subtle to nonexistent, but when I strained I was able to pick up some slight malt scent. The taste is about what you can expect from a light pilsner, which is nothing to write home about. A little malt and not much else. The mouthfeel is watery with a fair amount of carbonation at first that goes away after a short period of time. The only thing this beer really has going for it is that it's pretty drinkable, perhaps a decent lawnmower beer if nothing else was at hand."
"D- For a light lager, this has quite a bit of flavor. It's nothing to write home about, but I'd take this over BMC any day."
"Not a huge fan of light beers so I have to take that into consideration while reviewing. The color is typical pale gold/dark yellow. Perhaps slightly darker than your average light beer... Still pissy, though. Foamy hog piss head that disappears quickly and almost no lacing. Smells like metallic cheap malt with a touch of hops. Earthy as well. Tastes like a typical macro light but maybe a little more malt/hop flavor. Thin and watery and therefore easy to chug. Decent for a light beer but not very good for a real beer."
"Overall, a light lager. Enough said."
"Labatt Blue Light isn't horrible beer... hell, it's barely beer at all. It's the winner of this competition largely because of the intangibles; appearance and mouthfeel primarily. Congratulations to our northern neighbors for their second MacSmack crown."
"Served in a pint glass, the beer pours a straw yellow color with a half inch white head. Head retention is low, not much lacing. It smells like malt and corn, the aroma is light. Not much to the taste either, there's some malt and corn flavor, not much else from what I can tell. Mouthfeel is light, crisp, and watery. Drinkability is OK, but nothing special. This beer is non-offensive, but it isn't exactly good either. If someone gave me one I'd drink it, but I wouldn't pay for one of these. But with that being said, there are certainly worse beers out there."
"If you're looking for a break from crafts, this would probably not be the best choice. However, if you're just looking for a cheap beer to knock back on a lazy day, this is not too bad."
"In all honesty - even in social situations - I would opt for water over this more often than not. The only thing to its credit is that it's less offensive than regular Labatt Blue ( but that does not say much...)"
"Blue Light displays a crystal-clear straw gold body beneath an average sized head of bright white foam that holds fairly well given the style, and leaves some nice rings of lace dripping back into the glass. The nose is surprisingly hoppy for a light beer as well, with notes of floral, spicy, and even lightly herbal hops. It's a little fuller in the mouth, with a medium-light body and delicately bristling pinpoint carbonation that softens to become creamy-smooth. Hops return in the flavor, and it's much nicer than the hop-less, thin and dry light beers so common in the United States. The malt balances it well, and it finishes with some lingering spicy and floral character. Well done!"
"Pours a clear, very light yellow color. There is a minimal and quickly disappearing white head. No lacing. Smells of a bit of grass and corn. A bit of a sharp carbonation bite on the tongue. Some flavor, but not much. Very typical macro lager taste, only less (I mean light...). Basically, what is to be expected. Light lager, mass produced, light and easy to drink, less filling. On a hot day, sure. Not bad, just there. And, it was free."
"D- easy to drink but after having one I've had enough."
"I'm wouldn't exactly say other people are underestimating this beer, but I don't think it's quite offensive enough to warrant its score. This is a basic light lager, just adjunct beer-flavored water. Tastes a bit like a corn lager, reminds me of Miller Lite. I guess having less flavor means it has less bad flavor and that makes it a decent lawnmower beer, maybe."
"Labatt Blue Light pours a light yellow with a thin white head from a brown 11.5 ounce bottle. I really can't smell anything from this beer. Light, crisp body. It has a slight corn taste and not much else. Carbonated water with a little corn and grain flavoring. Inoffensive anyway."
"Pretty poor on the whole. Not much more than I expected I guess. Only one to drink if it's free. And then I can only take one or so."
"D- This certainly isn't the worst you could do for a light beer, the taste is more distinct than many, but the sharp carbination and bad smell are big negatives."
"D- This beer has a very soft flavor but it doesnt have a big fizz that dominates the flavor. Not that exciting but not flavorful."
"D: Not very tasty, goes down very easy, possibly the least filling beer I’ve ever drank. There are definitely worse light beers out there but the selection would have to be pretty limited for me to choose this beer again."
"Overall, as far as light lagers go, this is surprisingly tasty. That's all I got."
"Eh...pretty underwhelming. The appearance is copper with a foamy head. The smell is of corn and malt, the taste is extremely weak. WATERY! No kick to it at all. Sure, you could drink a ton with some chips while watching the game, but for a nice, enjoyable beer, you could look pretty much anywhere else. Slightly better than Coors Light, not as good as Bud Light. Take from that what you will."
"Surprisingly better then other macro lager beers, but I'll stick with my PBR or Schlitz when money gets tight."
"Despite being thirsty and there being only this and hard liquor, I regret trying to swallow even one mouthfeel. It has no head, is yellow, and smells like beer and soap detergent. The taste is acidic water. Metallic ugh! aftertaste.Fizzy carbonation, watery."
"Again, by the standard to which it is held, it's got a decent feel. Not too fizzy. I don't have to choke it down. (I probably would if it warmed up, but that's beside the point.) I have drank many of these in my day, and quite frankly you could do a lot worse. It's a very solid compared to its average macro brethren. But by normal standards, it's very much a cut below."
"The can is fizzy and has a pungent corny smell. For some reason it always tastes like the aluminum can. Maybe a slight rubbery smell? wow. How my taste has changed..."
"Labatt Blue Light was easy to consume. It was a nice change from drinking just the regular American macro lights. I would suggest it to someone who did not feel like buying the regular old twelve pack they do every weekend."
"Drinkability - I like the taste a little better than most macrolights. But not enough to pay a few extra dollars a six pack. And it's Imported daily from Canada. wow."
"Taste was semi-sweet corn malt, a hint of hop, alittle grass & metal. Overall though the mouthfeel was crisp, clean, slight dryness but rather refreshing. At 4.0% on the abv, that aids the drinkability of this light (better than most other lite's) beer."
"Stunning, classic light straw yellow. Small white head, pretty short-lived. Great water/malty-like smell. The water taste really comes through, slight malt and maybe a hint of hops. Overall, not the worst light beer you could find."
" Eric"
"Light yellow in color bordering on clear. A white head that disappears quickly. Did I mention clear? No real smell. Tastes like water. Unfortunately, I drink more of this beer than I care to admit. This beer is found in the fridge of a good friend of mine. Nothing special about this beer. Actually, this specific beer I found in my golf bag."
"Light, watery mouthfeel with a pressured carbonation effect. This tastes like a high quality blend of bottled water, light grains, corn and rice. Rather clean on the palate and easy to drink. Lacks any sense of complexity and enjoyment though."
"D = pretty low. this is better than coors light, or bud light and only slight better than miller light. overall, not a beer worth drinking to me"
"Pours a medium straw with a small, white, foamy, fully diminishing head. The smell is a very light combination of grain and cooked vegetable with a some very light grassy hops. The taste is lightly sweet and very bland. It has a thin body, oily texture and lively carbonation. All the makings of a beer-bong beer. Oh yippie. OK, Ive tried it, and I doubt Ill ever have it again. Not terrible but there's better cheapo light beers out there."
"Obviously not as bad as some other light beers but still a light beer. It is a light gold colored when poured with almost no head at all. Smeels like grain and taste has some maltines to it. Obviously this is a beer that isnt a big favorite and it shouldn be real high on your want list."
"Pours an ultra clear pale straw. Two finger head fizzles out rapidly leaving no lacing. Clean aroma, just some faint grain adjuncts. Thin flavored, very little malt or hops present to judge balance, but surely too light for the style. Streamig carbonation and watery body. The faint adjunct flavors and sulphur-like hop aftertaste eventually become coarse on the palate so you can can rule it out as a session beer. Even if you are watching carbs/calories, there are still better beers out there."
"The mouth is tissue paper thin. The best part of the beer is the zippy carbonation. Not one I will ever willing try again!"
"Pours a light golden color. Lots of head and lacing. Tastes like beer flavored water, but at least there was a beer flavor.Too bad it was not a good one. Mouthfeel is fizzy like soda pop. For a light, I filled up way too much on this beer. If you like to be bloated,and have a headach the next morning,this is your beer! If not, RUN!"
"In the grand scheme of beer, this might not be much, but it excells when compared to beers of its class."
"About on the same level as it's full flavored brother. Poured out to a light yellow color with a minimal amount of head present. No traces of lace. Odors of grain were noted, but overall, it's painfully obvious that this brew is very watery. Flavors of corn and grain were noted, but a lack of hops is where this brew really is a let down. Finished watery. The addition of hops would really spruce up this brew. Worth a try, but nothing special by a long shot."
"Pours a white, one finger-head that vanishes quickly leaving no lace. Clear, very pale amber color. Light carbonation and very light bodied. Nose is not detectable. Starts with more malts than hops but sweetness fades to a boring finish. Could be used as a lawn mower beer when you need to pound down 2-3 and not have much effect. $1.50 for a 340ml from Colonial Spirits Acton, Ma."
"Overall-bland and inoffensive, on the beer scale as a whole this isn't even noteworthy but compared to other light beers you could do worse in my opinion."
"Well, a party beer here. Pours a light straw color, but with a watery transparency, it's clear, without haze, and has a thin white head. There isn't much aroma hear, some yeast aroma whichn is somewhat breadlike, nothing off, but almost no aroma at all. Flavor is much more of the same. Almost no flavor whatsoever, and very little aftertaste. The body is thin. For the style I'm sure this is a typical example (thus my middle of the road score), but I'd hace to say there should be some flavor, otherwise it is pointless to drink this, it might just be that this beer is a good example of what is inherently wrong with the style of beer (made solely to easily get people drunk)."
"Bender Factor:If for some reason you decide that tonight is crappy Canadian beer night, Molson Canadian is the best choice. Everyone here in Buffalo thinks that Blue/Blue Light is the the sheezy, I say it makes me queasy. Labatt Blue is a sad excuse for a beer. It should be put out of it's misery. I feel bad for Canadian citizens who are exposed to Blue on a daily basis. That and the dude on hockey night."
"Funny story, so I'm cleaning up my desk and I open the bottom drawer and theres a bottle of Labatt Blue Light. Natural reaction? Why, drink it of course (and review it)! The appearance is less than spectacular, a neutral yellowish water, with little head and no lace. The smell is very metallic, with some watery hops and malt in the back, but not much. The taste is kind of off, with metallic hints as well, and the first slight hints of skunkage. I'd normally use that as a reason not to review a beer, but I dont think this one gets much better. The mouthfeel is rather unpleasant I thought. Too much carbonation, and it left a kind of slimy feeling at the front of my tongue, and a bit of a chalky feel at the back. But its cheap, and its not entirely undrinkable. If you're gonna buy Labatt though, go with regular Blue. Its much better than the Light."
"The beer pours an almost clear color with a faint tint of yellow. The head is white and frothy, but gone quickly. The aroma is a little above average. It has a very light feel with mostly pale malt and adjunct aroma. There is little hop scent. The taste is above average. It has a refreshing, light flavor with little malts or hops, but a clean, dry finish. The mouthfeel is decent. It is an extremely low bodied beer with good carbonation. This is a decent light beer. It is drinkable on hot days or at a party. There's not much to brag about, but it's not bad enough to bitch about."
"Simple and easy to drink, others are more offensive (but then I was having a good day that day)."
"Drinkability - you could easily do better, but there's lots of worse beers out there too, some of 'em non-light. With that said, drink this beer while it's ice cold, keep your expectations realistic and enjoy one in the dog days of summer, not the middle of February."
"The brew pored to a very mild yellow pale color and very clear. It had a very small head that dissipated quickly had had no lacing. The smell of the brew is a little off, somewhat foul. The taste is really nothing exciting, is actually is a extremely boring brew with no character. I guess I might be being a little hard on this brew but it is not worth trying to save calories to drink this light beer. One that I hope not to see in my friends fridges in the future!"
"Pale yellow, headless, odourless, characterless. Available everywhere in Ontario. Not offensive, but not much point in it either. Decent light beers are hard to come by and this ain't one of them. But it's not as bad as those things being flogged as low-carb beers either. Thank goodness for small mercies."
"I understand that these ""light"" beers have a bit of a following here in the States, but I wouldn't drink one of these if it was offered to me with a bribe attached. Utter crap."
"Puors a straw color with a thin, quick receiding head. The smell was not existant with no hints of hops or malt. The taste wasn't so bad. Kind of a grainy taste with the slightest hoppy bitterness. It went down smooth, I'll give it that. I really did enjoy it for a while. A nice beer to bring fishing."
"Standard macro brew with a huge water aftertaste. Not my favorite to start with but it seems that this one if the regular Blue diluted with water. Try this from a can in a christmas party and let's just say that next year I'll make sure to bring my own brew."
"Pours out to a usual, extreme, pale yellow of the style. Not much in the aroma department but some cereal/malt smell does come through. Taste is very light and slightly bitter and I mean slightly. Nowhere near its big brother, regular Blue tastewise and in comparison to other light beers, its well...light."
"Very pale yellow in color with a medium sized head that fades fast. Doesn't smell like much. Cereal and little hops, if i had to guess. Tastes watery and unipressive. This isn't a very interesting beer in any aspect. I could drink about 16 of them, though."
"This beer came along in 1983 as a replacement for Labatt Lite (which didn't actually go away). It is the better of the two but it is not a pleasant beer. It really does not have any redeeming qualities. It is a very pale yellow with an off-white head that looks like there might be some soap in it - no it wasn't the glass. Nose of something? - corn maybe. Thin, watery, no carbonation . Nearly tasteless and what there is is not all that wonderful. Hops I guess. I can not figure out why this is made."
"This beer when poured out of its can was a very pale watered down yellow color, but was super clear and well carbonated. The head that was produced was pure white in color and was fairly full and cloud like. But this fell to a lifeless liquid in the glass with only a shadow y image of its former cloud self. To my surprise there was some lace left on the sides of the glass from the brief foam. The aromas were faint, I nosed some light overly sweet malt, grains (corn), 1 flower, and a metallic overtone. The tastes were as faint as the aromas, I got a watery sweet malt taste, more corn grains then I care to have, and a brief stab of citrus before it went dry. The aftertaste was  well  nothing. Light bodied. Overall impression was not that impressive. The can said light and they were right, light aroma, light flavor and a light impression of a beer. To be honest it filled the beer gap for me at 11:00 at night at my buddys house while talking. It was hot, I was thirsty, I got a beer, and it kind of quenched my thirst. I guess it did its job. Not one that I would recommend or if I can care to drink again."
"People I know look to this as a ""good beer"". Well, they're wrong, but this is better than some American macro lights. Not much flavor. Slight malts mixed with slight bitter hops. Adjuncts are a little too noticeable. Skunky aroma just like the regular Labatt Blue. Good only for drinking games."
"Straw color, thin head that will quickly disappear. Skunky, skunky and skunky aroma and some light grain on the nose. Thin, thin and thin and a definitive light bodied beverage, some malts and light grassy, earthy flavor, but not overly offensive. Very delicate hops detected later on, adjuncts detected in the background. Very watery and slightly oily throughout. An aftertaste that will have you reaching for a better beer."
"I was very dissapointed in this beer. It was very watery. The mouthfeel was like seltzer water. I must say I enjoy his big brother, the original much better. There was a strange taste to this beer. I cannot name what it was but it was not pleasant. Not a good beer."
"11.5 oz bottle. pours out a pale straw colour. a bit of a foamy head with some retention. some lace. light grainy aroma followed by a hint of hoppiness. light flavours of grain. oh so ghostly hints of some hop bite. pretty smooth mouthfeel followed by that irritating crispness that i despise light beers for. very lean body, bordering on watery. pounding a whole lot of these would be easy...too easy. it's my opinion that among light beers, this isn't too bad, but it's still pretty lame. while not as bad as advertised, still not worth anyone's attention. high drinkability. pure swill."
"Not a great beer."
"The fact that I detected hops in this beer surprised me, along with the somewhat fruity notes. I still don't find this as clean as any of Molson's products, but I would still rank it above many American light beers (*AHEM* Coors and Bud Light)."
"Drinkability/notes: Utterly lacking in character, it might as well be a carbonated mineral water."
"A pale comparison to the real Blue, this beer is much more watery and light. No real body feel. Nose and taste of mild adjuncts. The appearance is pretty standard and macro like, which to say, not that great. There are lots of ways to enjoy drinking beer; this is not one of them."
"Okay this is simple, imagine Labatt's Blue which is relatively lighter american style lager, now imagine that same beer watered down. I don't know how they can get away making artificial beer, this just isn't beer. It smells of a mild malt sweetness very faint, no sign of hops here just chemical ridden stench. This is one poorly made beer that just over did it on the water and left out beer. Appears yellow and very fizzy (artificial carbonation), with a very thin head even when I poured it straight into the glass with no tilt. The bubbles are still rising from the bottom of the glass much like seltzer water, which also explains the mouthfeel of this beer. In the taste it is a very nasty watered down flavor that isn't sweet and isn't bitter it's just straight gross and unappetizing. There is no finish to speak of here, just blandness absolutely no flavor. You may have to take in a keg IV of this on to get a buzz, it is that watery. I don't ever picture myself drinking this beer ever again, no matter what."
"Had a can of this and a can of Michelob Light at a Bluejackets game. Back and forth I went between the two, back and forth, Labatt and Michelob, Michelob and Labatt. There literally was no difference. Both had next to no aroma or flavor. Both sucked sour frog ass. Taste tests between two crappy beers are not fun. At least they were free."
"Okay, where do I begin. This beer is not very good at all. The smell is, well, nothing at all. The taste is something like corn or something that I don't really know. My girlfriend likes ligher beers, but I don't think this one even impressed her. Can anyone really find a ligher beer that anyone like? Good luck in your quest."
"I rarely drink light beers. The only reason I bought this is because it came in a Labatt Holiday Pack. Carlsberg, 50 ale, Blue and Blue Light. This was the worse beer out of the four. Colour was pale. Reminded me of an old, used cigarette butt. Smell was their. That was it. Nothing special. Just smelled like beer. Taste, bland. Like Blue, but with too much added water. The good thing is, it's so weak you could drink it all day. Not impressed, though my bias for light beer. perhaps persuaded my judgement."
"I guess after the Labatt bear finishes the regular Labatt's, he produces this. It is very light, with no taste. Take away the carbonation, amd it would be just runoff. This stuff is just plain awefull."
"Smells oddly like the inside of a shower stall. What is that? Shampoo? Porcelain? Galvanized? Pale yellow/grey. Tastes like water with some oyster crackers floating in it. Maybe this is from the aquarium where they are farmed. Very good for oyster cracker farm water. Great!"
"Bland upfront and through the finish, crispness is lost and there is an underlying slickness in the mouth. Vague grain and bitterness though the bitterness could be from the hops or faintly astringent malt or both. I gather it is both. Nice to see the Canadians brew a real crappy light beer. NOT!"
"Glad I just got one of these.."
"My rant is complete ..."
