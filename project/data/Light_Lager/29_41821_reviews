"Terrible taste. Tried to hard to be a girly drink. Tastes like death"
"It's a drinkable cheap beer for a cook out. I like it better than most big box American beers. With that being said it's nothing special. But I buy it for my wife from time to time"

"Not sure why i like this beer but i honestly enjoy it from time to time( stuck in a midwest bar) with the wife.  I think it comes from the practice of my grandparents adding lime and salt to Corornas.  Loved that.  Bud Light Lime seems to nail that taste for me."
"How have I never rated this? It was my second lawnmower beer after Landshark cans disappeared!  What can I say, it's a lime beer. Nose of fake lime, barely a bit of beer taste under that big fake lime taste that seemingly never leaves the tongue. I've moved on to the various Leinekugel shandys now for mowing but yep, many a strip of grass were doused with the last ounce or so of a Bud Light lime once the cold fell off!  Really - only way to drink it is ice freaking cold. Think just north of slushy cold."

"another solid example these guys cant brew a good beer"

"O:  Nothing that is gonna knock your sox off but a refreshing offering that would be good to bring a 12 pack of to the beach"
"Crisp and citrus flavors make it an average beer."
"yummy crisp lime soda drink"

"Still awful, but better than the original"
"Artificial lime quality over the watery body & flavor profile."

"Not undrinkable, ok with a lime."

"I would unfortunately rather have a corona with lime than this..."
"What can I say but Bud Light lager with lime added. It's not bad on a hot day but the lime really taste generic and if I am going to add lime to beer I would much rather add real lime."

"I feel bad even rating this. Super gross."
"I don't like fruited beers, especially favored artificially"
""
"Looks great, way to much lime but still drinkable and pretty much everyone will drink it."
"i mean for what it is....pretty good"
"It tastes like soap, not completely sure the brand of soap but probably ivory. I don't see how people like it, i'm sure cold bath water tastes smooth but its not really a good taste."

"very sessionable, the lime flavor hides the alcohol taste in this beer that is forward in bud light."

"Had this at my buddy's birthday party. Not a lot of flavor worth mentioning. The lime tastes like real lime, but is a light dash of it. I give this a 5 out of 5 for one reason. It tastes incredibly smooth and goes down really good. Carbonation is perfect for this beer. You could argue its not beer considering there is no beer flavor really, besides a light malt taste. This stuff is incredibly easy to drink. It actually stays easy to drink even warm. Because of that i also rated this beer highly. It is seriously the easiest thing to drink i have ever had. The fact its so easy to drink i drank almost a 24 pack of bottles by myself across the day. The lime is just the perfect amount. I am not a beer snob at all. But i do enjoy the hoppier stuff too. I gotta say, they don't market this as much as regular BL and i don't think they have too. this is good without marketing. Its just the perfect balance of the lime flavor and the light body of the beer taste that makes me like this. next time i go fishing i'm taking a pack of this. perfect for hot days."

"They should just stop making bud lite products altogether. This beer tastes and smells like the moldy piss on the floor of your local Mexican cantina restaurant/bar. In fact I'm really not sure this was beer at all, it has such a low abv good luck trying to get a buzz on this garbage. Bud take a look at what dogfish is doing with their Ancient Ales line, they at least taste good and get me a buzz"

"Bud Light Lime -----2/5."
""
""
""
""
"Appearance was a very pale yellow with no head. Smell was full of lime, but also kind of a chemical scent. The taste was a bud light with artificial lime flavor added. That's kind of all there is to it."
"Good beer for the beach if you're not trying to spend too much or if craft beer isn't available."
"That is the only time drinking Bud is even remotely acceptable. Go with a refreshing wheat beer or blonde ale instead."

"I am someone who enjoys light beer. Reason, Its smooth and goes down like water. This has no real flavor worth mentioning besides a slight beer taste and lime. Its very balanced in the carbonation. I like this more than my coors light. Coors light is in the same boat as this though. What made me rate this this way is the hint of lime. Its not overpowering and today i had two or 3 of these and they were good. As i said the only thing i can taste is the lime. Also its one of the few things i let get hot and it didn't turn nasty.  This and Redds apple ale trump all the other macros for me."

"For appearance it is very hard for a beer to appear bad, that's why it gets a 4. That is where the high marks end. The smell has a very faint lime smell to it and is the only think you can smell from the beer. The taste is just lime and nothing more. The mouth feel is light and is like drinking a bud light. Overall the beer isn't good. I wanted to try it as a beach beer and is low in abv and comes in cans. It gave me slight hard burn and is like drinking a watered down corona."
"OVERALL: I have to remind myself to ""respect beer"" at this moment. I understand this beer is popular with frat boys but, it's not for me. This beer would appeal to people who are trying beer for the first time and have nothing to compare it to. It would also appeal to people who do not really like beer. It tasted more like a soft drink than beer."

"It's a decent beer when you take it for what it is, these types of beer have their place . It's not a craft beer or a microbrew, and it doesn't need to be. For a hot day easy drinking beer this is pretty good. Still not as good (or as cheap) as High Life, which is my go to filler beer."

"The bud light lime is actually a good beer. It is like a bud light with lime flavor added to it. Tou can actually taste the lime flavor on the beer. The color is like a clear golden color. The smell pf the beer is actually pretty good as well. For an every day beer this is a good beer."
""
"This is your typical taste, look and aroma. What I think sets this one apart is the lime flavor that is added. The line is more natural than fake and adds great improvement to the bud lite itself. I would recommend drinking this beer very cold because as the temperature rises, the flavor becomes slightly skunky and undesirable. Keep it cold and this is a nice refreshing beverage"

"This is an okay summer boating beer that's watery mouthfeel actually lends itself to it's drinkability. On a hot summer day out on the boat I think this is a nice alternative to a fuller bodied beer would fill you up. Though any other time... not the greatest beer."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a small head. If you are a fan of drinking beer with a lime in it, you may enjoy this beer. It is an alright alternative than actually cutting a lime and sticking it into your beer. I would say it is more for the summer, so crack one open on a hot summer day"

"This barely qualifies as beer to begin with. What little taste there is to be had is a disgusting slightly lime taste that leaves a horrible tangy feeling in your mouth afterwards. The rest is just watery. The massive carbonation attempts to hide the fact that this beer literally tastes like urine but fails completely to do so. Everything about this beer is unpleasant and I am genuinely amazed that anyone buys it."
"It doesn't taste bad, it just doesn't taste like beer. It's an alcoholic lime drink."

"Bud Light Lime brewed by Anheuser-Busch. This brew pours out a nice amber color. There is little to no head to this brew, but it is white head. This beer smells like 7 UP or other lemon lime pop or soda on the market. The taste is the same as the smell but flat lemon lime pop or soda. I thought there would be more to this brew but there is not. If you like lemon lime soda or pop you my like this. Nothing special about this brew. Over all I'm giving this brew a 2.5 out of 5."

"O - Had this with homemade Mexican food and it wasn't that bad. I could see this (at the right price of course) as being a great ""lawnmower"" or other manual labor on a hot day type beer. The low alcohol content certainly makes it a candidate for mass consumption but I have to wonder if you'd tire of the lime flavor."

"Is lime that hard to cut? This just doesn't seem like much of an added value. I've lived in cold climates, and lime is still available pretty much year round. No matter how awful the fruit looks, it's gotta be better than what Bud or InBev synthesizes."
""
""
""
""
"O-tonight is light lager night. I like the idea that real limes are used with this beer. So it is a Bud Light that has real limes in it. I have to say it taste better with e lime in it."

"This is not an abomination. In some ways, it's actually more interesting than Bud Light. While Bud Light has no flavor, this at least has some lime. Above all, I'm curious why this beer still exists. Does this appeal to people looking for that ""OMG drinking Corona with lime is like I'm really on the beach"" demographic? I wish that demographic didn't exist. On a related note, I would rather drink this than Corona (lime or not). Or does this appeal to the ""I'm underage and I don't like beer but this doesn't taste like beer LOL"" crowd? Whatever. One thing is certain: I now really need to review the masterpiece known as Bud Light Lime-A-Rita."

"The lime flavor in BLL is overpowering, and it's not too bad - it does taste like lime, not too artificial. Drinking BLL is definitely not a deep beer-drinking experience, but if I ever do want something cheap, or something to just get me a little drunker, it is one of the first things I will reach for, although because the flavor is so strong, it's tough to have a lot of it in one go, but I suppose once you're drunk enough you can get a regular cheapo lager and not tell the difference."

"When you pour milk in your fruitloops and eat all the fruitloops, you have fruity milk left over to drink. When you pour bud light in your fruitloops and eat all your fruitloops you have bud light lime left to drink. I know a lot of very smart and respectable people who really like this brew, but I'm not one of the. I would not recommend this beer."
"Not much to say about the smell; average, some sort of lime-ish scent. Nothing special at all. Taste was okay (at first), but seemed very artificial, and became far too overpowering after a few drinks. Was expecting a subtle lime taste, but definitely not the case here. Awful. Not sure if the can had something to do with this, but I'll possibly have to review this again later after trying it in a bottle."

"Sampled on 9/1/13. Chilled down to 36 degrees in my beer cooler. Poured into a pool ball pilsner glass.Pours a golden-yellow with a small foamy head. Very little lacing was seen. LOTS of bubbles were seen rising up from the bottom of the glass, due to excessive carbonation. The aroma is of some grain and lime. The taste is of mostly lime, which covers up the grain flavor actually. A bit much and more so that the 'Miller Chill"" that I had earlier. Was water-down and doesn't taste like real lime."

"This beer is pretty terrible. if you can call it beer. It smells like laundry soap. Seriously, that is the first thing i thought when I smelled it. It's light and fizzy like most other american mass produced beers. It's about as smooth as water if you call that smooth"

"Since when did miller lite change their name to bud light lime? Was there suppose to be lime flavor in it? Because it had not even a hint of lime. But enough about that, it's not bad, but I'll just order a miller lite next time I go to that restaurant."

"Pours clear yellow color with 2 finger width carbonated head.  Head retention and lacing are virtually non-existent.  Lime predominates the aroma.  Nothing special there.  Very light malty taste up front followed by a watered down limeade aftertaste and spicy bitterness.  Light and refreshing for a hot summer day by the pool, but there are literally thousands of better beers for this."

"Overall: For what it is, this does the job. I'd rather be drinking one of these than the traditional Corona and Lime during a party or something, primarily because the effect is basically the same, and this one is cheaper. A good party drink if you're having lots of people over who don't like beer-beer. Not something I'd pick up on my own, but for what it is, it's refreshing and dangerously drinkable (but not in a traditional 'beer' kind of way- more like a soda or hard-lemonade that's bitter sort of way)."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a well crafted beer for what it is. It is a very refreshing beer. THe balance of sweet malt and lime is good. Neither overpower. The aftertaste of lime is also a nice touch. I was happily surprised by the brew. It will be good on a very hot summer day."

"O: For light beers it's an interesting spin, very drinkable, maybe nice for hot weather or a barbeque. For the style I would say it's maybe a bit above avg. For all beer it's just a bit to artificial and dull. I feel like I've tasted it before in other light beers."

"On a budget, this is my pick! I understand it goes against what I believe a beer should be made out of or even taste like, but I am obsessed with lime, so this was my choice at bars!

"O: Fruit in beer seems to be something people do whenever they “don’t like beer” because all they’ve ever had is the fizzy yellow stuff; nothing against them (I feel like most beer geeks were BMC consumers first), but I’m not a fan. Imagine that?"

"O: For what it is, this is actually not bad at all. No real adjunct flavors or aromas (probably masked by the lime) which makes this rather easy to drink especially given the fact that it is 4.2% and doesn't have too many beer-like qualities. I guess that might be the problem though... no BEER qualities"
""
""
"Pours a clear pale yellow hue with an average head mainly because I pour this as viciously as possible to get a head. Some cheap grains and lime are evident in the scent. Drinks fairly weakly with very little volume or texture. At least it lives up to the “lime” name and has a decent lime flavor. Leaves a slight lime after taste and that’s about it. A glorified version of what I refer to as “beer flavored water.”"

"2.0 D: Calling Bud Light a beer is a stretch, but this can and never should be called beer. It shouldn't even be allowed to be reviewed on this site. Drink this if you are burnt out on beer I guess."

"Surprisingly, a better alternative to bud light. At least this one tastes like SOMETHING. The lime flavor is very obviously artificial, like a diet soda, so it's maybe not as ""tasty"" as a Corona with lime added, but it's something you can stomach. The carbonation has a nice bite which really helps the style. If you're stuck between bud light or bud light lime, and the water is bad, this is the obvious choice."

"All in all, not bad, but the title says all. A light, big company beer with flavor added."

"Bud light lime is less of a beer and more of a liquified lime jolly rancher with a touch of beer flavor. It would be refreshing in the summer (in fact I just finished a 5k in 91 degree heat), but the artificial lime flavor is just too much. This was given to me for helping my professor move, and I would not partake in it again unless under similar circumstances."

"O: This beer is quite refreshing and easy to drink on a hot summer evening. This is actually a better version of Bud Light and tastes like a Bud Light with a shot of Rose's Lime Syrup. This beer is best when ice cold."
""
""
""
"So there you have it. Next time you want Bud Light - look and see if they have Bud Light Lime. It's just a pinch better."
"It went down easier than expected, but still something that came from a party cooler and not as a result of a conscious choice to purchase this. Not all offensive, just not very good."

"color was deep piss yellow. terrible less than half finger head that dissipated faster than i could blink. tasted like a diet soda water and lime. just plain terrible overall. at least miller chill had taste although a bad one, it was still better than this travesty"
""
"Wow, this sucks. I'd take a Corona Light with lime any day of the week over this."
""
""
"(originally reviewed: 07-06-2011)"
"Overall – Actually this is much better than I was anticipating. It had a lot more flavor (while most in lime, it was a lot more flavor) then the average light beer."
"It's amazing how a single additional flavor into an otherwise shitty beer can change things. I cannot power through Bud Light and actually enjoy it. The addition of Lime and salt flavoring really takes this stuff from an bad watered down redneck lager to something that is drinkable and enjoyable. Although I don't prefer it to let's say, Labatt Blue, It still is not a bad choice. Although I typically don't like paying $22 for an 18 pack of this when I can get Labatt for less"

"O: This beer goes down like water and somewhat resembles lime-flavored soda (except that it lacks a strong sugary sweetness). This beverage is probably best consumed very quickly and in the can."
""
"O: Lives up to my nonexistent expectations, but I can manage these little 7 oz. bottles to an extent. It's not completely awful if you go into it expecting a lime soda instead of an actual beer. Me, I'll stick with actual craft beer, thank you very much..."

"Overall: This is more of a fruit and spices beer than an adjunct lager. Not good but the lime hides the bad stuff."
"95 degrees outside and 95% humidity? Want some beer? This is an EXCELLENT choice. Thin? Yes. Refreshing? Hell yes. Zero hops. Weiss? No. Refreshing? Hell yes. Cmon. It's in a clear bottle. Not sure why this is advertised any season other than summer. And it's kinda good with summer food like bbq."

"Looks like any other macro. Smells and tastes heavily of lime and some hints of beer. Mouthfeel is light and prickly. Overally, don't go into this expecting greatness. You really have to be in the mood for it. I think the reviews are way too low. Remember...compare this to Miller Lite Chill...that is all."

"This beer is not my type. The color is a yellow straw and taste is about the same with a hint of lime. There just isn't much taste to it. It's very bland and watery. This seems like a girly drink to me. Let them enjoy it. If anything stick with a regular Bud Light."
""
""
""
""
"Will never drink again"
""
"You can tell how this beer looks if you have ever seen a bud product, it is like that. In a clear bottle. Smells like lager and a bit of lime air freshener. Flavor is adjunctional and has a strong lime character. While cold, the lime is a little sharp, and as the beer warms, it actually comes out a bit more. Thin with insane carbonation and a semi dry finish. This beer is poorly done, but I can't help but enjoy it when out on the lake in an intertube."

"O: Not horrible but tastes more like a soft drink than a beer, good for those who don't really like beer and need something sweeter, I'd probably look elsewhere if this was a choice"
""
"Bud Light Lime is much more flavorful than normal Bud Light. It has the taste of limes and sugar, with a malty backdrop. This flavored light lager is popular, and I see why. The mild taste of this brew will not satisfy hop lovers, but should be a welcomed alternative for fans of the original Bud Light."

"Had out of the bottle. Smells like sweet artificial lime flavoring. Taste is more of the same with a really light body and seltzery carbonation. I would hardly consider this beer but to be honest, I wouldn't mind drinking this one bit on a hot summer day."

"O: This is like drinking lime juice mixed with cheap mineral water. I'm trying to find something positive to say here, but honestly just can't do it. This is atrocious. It's a sad excuse for a beer, but fortunately for me, I expected no less. My first drain pour in some time."
""
""
"This beer is a clear pale yellow with a lime aroma that almost hides a hint of rice in the background. The flavor is one-dimensional, all lime. It's not overpowering but that's all there is. The mouthfeel is light. Bud Light Lime is a bad beer. Not recommended."

"This is a solid C from me. Sure I would never order it at the bar, but when hanging out with buds or similar activities this is the perfect beer, in my opinion. It's the tailgating beer."

"This beer is a thirst quencher and easy to drink. It tastes good, especially if you like lime drinks. However, I don't feel like I'm really drinking beer. It's o.k. to taste like lime, but let me taste some malt or hops too. Otherwise, if some other kind of beer is available, I'll take it."
"Overalll- This was poured into a frosted mug for me and I was shocked to see after I let the beer sit for about three or four minutes that small parts of ice started floating to the top of the mug! What a travesty. Might have been better if 1. it wasn't served in a mug 2. there wasn't any ice in it. I dont know if its because of how thin this beer is or because of how cold the glass was but thats what ruined it for me."
""
"Overall, I would have a hard time drinking this beer, even at a party or something. I wouldn't go all beer geek on them and talk about how bad most adjuncts are, but I try to always BYOB. Beers like this is why."
""
""
""
"O: So. It may not be terrible, but I still can't manage to finish an entire glass. I feel this is a beer to be swigged -- from the bottle -- on a sultry summer eve. In the company of 'bros'. Unrecommended, but if push comes to shove (or I need to blend in at a tailgate) I would not disdain this beer in the future."

"O - Not as horrible as I imagined, but this has little to no real characteristics of beer. With subsequent sips the lime begins to taste stale; it lingers. Hand me a Perrier to wash away the shame this beer has cast upon self-respecting mineral waters."

" The flavor is better than I expected. I have had this before and was not sure how I felt. The flavor is so light it is like having a lime flavored alka-seltzer practically. There is a sweet tinge from whatever malt there is in this. The lime flavor is a gentle addition to the light beer taste, not overdone and freshens the slightly dull crisp taste a bit. Overall it is more of a drink for refreshing the palate on a hot summer day after mowing than a beverage to enjoy the day after Christmas, but for the price it isn't terrible"

"Tastes like wet paper, manila folders soaked in club soda with a splash of lime juice. Dry, flabby, mealy aftertaste once the carbonation dies down a bit. Watery and insipid, lacking crispness of a good lager, with a touch of ""natural"" lime. Just utterly dull and lacking any sort of character outside of the lime addition. Water tastes pretty good with a lime in it too..."

""
""
""
""
"Poured a 2"" white head which hovered a bit then fairly quickly collapsed as the body exhausted all carbonation. Clear straw yellow color. Smell is grass and lime. Taste has the grass of typical Bud Light but I was surprised it actually expressed some maltiness and the lime though present wasn't the artificial limeaid I was expecting. Still watery. For a cheap low cal beer this is OK though."

"O- I didnt think this beer was going to be good. Alot of people come on here and slander ABInbev because they make shitty beer, but this beer really is god awful. For me, drinking this beer is reminiscent of punching myself in the genitals aggressively. Im actually pissed off at myself and feel guilty that i poured this into my Brooklyn Brewery tulip. Shit. Drainpour."
"Eric"
"RJT"
"O-I'm don't care so much for this one. It feels like not much thought or effort went into brewing the beer. Mindless mass production at its worst. This beer only works if it's super cold and if there is nothing else to drink. This is my father-in-law's favorite beer and I can't understand why."
"I don't usually hate on beer, but something is wrong when InBev sells millions of cases of this every year. If you enjoy lovingly hand crafted beer, then stay clear of this toxic waste nightmare."
"As far as light beer goes, you could definitely do worse than BLL. I am generally not a big fan of fruity beer, especially when it's artificial fruitiness, but I still find this to be drinkable... perhaps even enjoyable with the proper weather and situation. At the very least, I can say I like this more than regular Bud Light. Reasonably inoffensive - a serviceable light beer option."
"The mouthfeel was light bodied and not overly carbonated. For entertainment I did a taste test VS. Michelob Ultra Lime Cactus and this Bud Light Lime. The Bud Light Lime was better, the MULC was more watery and the lime tasted artificial."
"The only positive thing that I can say about this beer was that it was a nice cold drink on a warm day. And if it is cold enough, you might get lucky enough not to have to taste it. A good idea gone horribly bad."
"This beer goes down smooth and doesn't leave an unpleasant after taste. Whether chugging like a college student or grippin' and sippin' this beer doesn't get boring. Stop hating the light beer, it's a necessary evil."
"Did I mention the lime? Basicaly a ruined Bud Light!"
"For those that don’t like beer and like the taste of liquid lime Bud Light Lime is for you…not the style for me."
"mouthfeel - light, sure, but thats not necessarily impressive. very drinkable. watery. carbonation is decent, ill give it that."
"This is a very drinkable beer. If you're looking for a cheap, quaffable poolside beer that's a little nontraditional, this is it."
"I guess if I had to choose one or the other, I would pick this over Miller Chill. Its only saving grace is that it is a tiny bit more refreshing than its competitor."
"Playing softball in the blazing hot sun on the first morning I forgot my water bottle. I reached into the cooler and saw...this one. After initially throwing up in my mouth, thirst (and to be honest, morbid curiosity), got the better of me. Cracking open the can, I took a big swallow, and...nothing. Tasted pretty much like regular Bud Light (nothingness, emptiness, etc.) with a hint of lime. Could have been worse, though I have no plans to pick up any more."
"Drank this one straight from the can on a nice hot summer day. Generally I'm not a fan of bud light but I think the subtle addition of lime is a nice addition. The lime is present in the smell and in the flavor and is not too overpowering. Everything else about this beer is average at best."
"Kind of an odd flavor. It looks and feels like any regular bud light. The taste is a bit weird though. It is almost like you just mixed a bud light with a margarita. I considered mixing it with a little regular bud light to offset some of the lime, which was a little strong. Regardless, it is refreshing, but on a hot summer day, a landshark might be a little more tasty."
"Thin body, high carbonation, watery and light on the tongue. Pretty much what the name implies, although it definitely doesn't help."
"Overall: For what it is, it's not bad. Unfortunately, what it is is a crappy adjunct light lager with lime juice added to mask the terrible flavor. I'm rating it as a Light Lager and as a Light Lager it falls way short. You don't really get any ""beer"" flavors as it's totally overpowered by lime juice. The lime juice tastes natural, but I'm not looking for my beer to taste like limes. I always say, if you need a lime to cover up the taste of your beer, you should be drinking a different beer. I would avoid this one."
"Super pale yellow produces a fluffy snow white head that dissipates immediately. Smell is what I would call ""Sprite/radler"". By far the smell is the best thing about it. Rather fruity/ citrusy. Very soda poppy. Taste is basically a dry lime soda and/or Alka Seltzer with a slight beer finish and aftertaste. No cloying sweetness left over on the palate. Mouthfeel is super thin like a radler and refreshing/ bubbly. As easy as this should be to drink, something about it is vaguely nauseating. I can't imagine having more than one, although that is certainly not their intention. It tastes very artificial. Not at all like a beer with REAL lime in it."
"Poured from a bottle. Pours a clear color with a hint of yellow. Very thin white head, actually almost no head at all. Very strong smell of lime with a bit of wheat if you bury your nose inside the glass. No mouth taste really there just kind of feels like water. Tastes very strong of lime pretty much over powering the beer. Really no taste of beer until the after taste. Overall I think its a plan to cover up a shitty beer with the taste of lime. Not impressed."
"From bottle no. 11167BK53. Sampled on August 2, 2011. Yellow pour a quick fizzy white head. Aromas of lime edging out the thin hoppiness. Light body. Loads of lime in the flavor with a toned down grain and a whisp of hops.This epitomizes the kind of thing you might like to have on a hot day if you don't want the flavor of beer."
"Bud Light Lime is like many of the other light beers that have a hint of fruit added to attract the female populous. Bud Light Lime is not bad....certainly drinkable on a hot day. The color is yellow with good carbonation that translates to a white head that dissapates quickly. This beer have good lime aroma. The taste is Bud Light with lime. or Grain and lime if you prefer. The mouthfeel is very light and easy drinking."
"If you're looking for a beer, go elsewhere. If you want a seriously lime-flavored drink, limes are like 4/$1 and limeade is easy to make."
"taste and looks like water.... no aroma... no head... i hear its very hard to make though and they get it the same every time... i guess that is one positive... oh and they do have good commercials!!!"
"It gets a little bit sweet after a while, and although I never see myself trying this again, I didn't hate it. For the price, however, you could get a case of beer that is actually good, so this is a failure."
"O - It's not horrendous but I would rather but a real lime in my own bud. They put too much lime in it so you can barely taste any other flavors."
"The taste also has artificial limes. Light bodied, over carbonated, and pretty bad. Avoid. Thankfully I got this as a freebie at a get together. I would have hated to pay for this."
"Overall, this is just another gimmick beer. Support micro-brews or better brews by the bigger companies."
"Looks a very pale, watery golden color, smells very strongly of lime. Tastes almost like a soda... very little beer flavor detected. The lime is definitely the dominant flavor up front, finishes with a wheat/cereal flavor. Interesting... definitely better than bud light because the skunk flavor is masked with the lime, but I can hardly call this a beer. I suppose it has it’s purpose poolside or at a BBQ, but I would prefer something else otherwise."
"All and all there is a time and place for a beer like this i just haven't found it yet... cheers!"
"Overall: Surprisingly inoffensive. Not very beer-like; more like seltzer with a twist. Miles better than similar “lime flavored malt drinks.” I wouldn’t seek another out, but wouldn’t turn one down if offered."
"overall this is definitely not the devil's spawn that the beer geek community would have you believe... it's relatively inoffensive, and even somewhat refreshing - but in the manner of sprite, which i think it has more in common with than beer. not a novel take, but a valid one. reviewing aside, i might take one if i'm at the beach and parched, but i won't pay money for it."
"Overall – This isn't something that I would have purchased, but it was offered to me by a friend and I figured I might as well give it a try. It seems to be selling fairly well - I figured it would be a fad that would away, but the beer has been around for a few years now. I still don't see whats so hard about adding your own lime to a bud light. (or whichever beer you choose) At least then it would taste less artificial."
"Poured this beast out of a can into a clear plastic cup. Only the best for Bud Light! It produced a tiny thin white head, poor retention, no lacing. It poured a pale yellow color. Aroma was a hint of odd smelling lime- somehow i doubt the claim of 100% Natural Lime Flavor"" There was a taste of lime from start to finish. I did not detect any malt or grain or hops for that matter. Can someone say lemon lime Vess Soda that has been sitting out in an open 2 liter bottle for about a week. Overall, bad- not good-"
"Overall this beer wasn't nearly as bad as I expected it to be. It's like a fizzy citrusy soda. Not much abv so it doesn't hit hard. It sounds trashy but I really wouldn't mind a canned one on a hot day fishing or something."
"Overall: Not a bad beer in the big picture, but isn’t really that great either. The lime flavor really adds a lot to this beer."
"D: Meh."
"I don't know that I could down 18 of these in an evening or anything, but I'm glad to find a BMC product that I don't mind drinking."
"D- This beer certainly surprised me. I am not a fan of bud light but this seems to cover up the off flavors with a moderately enjoyable lime characteristic. If I was going to drink a lot of beers on a summer day I wouldn't mind this being one or two of them."
"Bud Light Lime is not a good beer compared to other better beers, but when used correctly and without pretension, it is good."
"Pretty average appearance. Pours out a golden straw color with some white sudsy head. No lacing of course plenty of rising carbonation. Smells like bud light with lime added. As advertised. Can't really smell much more than lime. Taste is nothing but lime. The good thing is it taste natural. Like I got a bud light and literally squeezed lime juice into it. Mouth feel is ok. Light bodied, highly carbonated. Like seltzer water almost. Don't really have anything bad to say about this. It is what it is. Average macro lager. Would I buy this on a regular basis? No. I wouldn't turn down a free one if that's all there was though."
"639"
"Overall- The beer is what I would expect from a beer with lime in. Overpowering lime taste, is about the same as most of the other lime beers"
"Overall- Easy drinking, Tonic water tasting, and an easy floating trip or marathon beer. I have enjoyed many times and now when it comes down to it, I can hardly write anything about it! Better than many other of its competitors (Miller Chill, Corona & Lime, etc)."
"Overall, gimmick beer that inspired a number of knock offs. Only thing that makes this different then bud light is the lime taste. At least it's easy to dry."
"No malt or hop presence, just seems like someone mixed sprite with bud light. Lots of sprite. Nothing in the mouthfeel other than carbonation and lime soda. Cannot believe this is so popular, even amongst people who like Bud Light."
"O - Of the two big Light Lime beers, this is my preference. Which is a lot like say that I would rather lose a leg than an arm."
"Is it artificial or natural lime flavor? Can says 100% natural flavor. Dispute settled. Average clear straw color with average head retention and above average lacing. Fantasticlly quafable; I wish I was very very thirsy. Tastes like lime alcohol selter. I want to mix it with some coconut flavored whisky for a tropical boiler maker. That would make this beer that much more enjoyable."
"Overall - Possible light beach beer that did not capture my imagination"
"I didn't think I'd ever try this but a friend had it and tossed me one. I wasn't overly excited to try it but I did anyway. The nose is quite potent with lime. It smells nice but its reminding me of soda. The beer is clear yellow and obviously light bodied. The taste is lime no doubt about that. The flavors of lime subside after a little and turns into that very familiar Bud Lite flavor most of us know and hate."
"D: Not too flavorful since the only thing I can taste is lime, goes down very easily and not filling at all since there's nothing to the beer, since it's so light that makes it a good representation of style, it seems as though this is one of those beers that tries to appeal to people that don't like beer by tasting as little like beer as possible."
"Overall: I didn't find this as bad as expected. But I like anything lime....even fake tasting lime candy. That may explain my tolerance here."
"Sucks. But hey, it is what it is. At least they can make money off of it."
"Pee yellow. The lime scent was thankfully strong enough to cover the goop beer. Again, the lime was the only redeeming quality in the flavor. Sweet syrupy stank followed, and a week-old stale beer flavor finished. Wanted to spit the aftertaste out, so I did (thankfully I was at a BBQ). This beer is barely beer, so it's safe to say it was not very drinkable. Yuck!"
"I'm banking that this purchase won't ruin Pliny for me."
"HOT summer days are the only place for these, or if your out of every other beer and you have no choice. They also can cause a wicked headache."
"<<Avoid!!>>"
"Finally dragged into trying one of these, clearly looked like it was going to be frightening but honestly, was not nearly as bad as I was expecting. If I am at a party in the hot summer sun and am asked ""Bud Light, Bud Heavy or...Bud Light Lime?"" I may have to put my manhood aside and ask for the Lime."
"Imagine drinking a flat diet Seven Up with some Palmolive mixed in and you have Bud Light Lime."
" If you want to add a lime to your beer why i dont knwo then buy a regular beer and add a lime. (see corona) its not horrible but maybe if your sitting at a mexican restaurant with some tortilla chips and salsa then have a few otherwise no."
"Very thin, watery, and light, which is ok for the flavor and style, but not great. Drinkability is good, as it should be, since that's the whole point of this beer. Better than expected beer."
"D - Drinkability was high because it was basically watered down limeade and went down like water."
"D: Surprisingly, this was not completely horrendous. I don't know if I'd want to drink a full glass of this, but it's not as bad as some might lead you to believe."
"Taste-wise, not sure that I'd take this even over Bud Light. I'm not a huge fan of the lime flavor here."
"I had this at my friend's wedding because there wasn't anything else to drink. Let's start off with this. I HATE any and all off the big 3's beers. After saying that, there are a couple of good things I have to say about this beer. It was refreshing. After a night of dancing this beer really hit the spot. The lime flavor was good. It really took away from the piss water taste of the Bud Light. So, would I drink this again? Probably not. Would I recommend this to anyone? No. But it is slightly better then Bud Light (which I consider to be one of the worst beers on the face of the earth)."
"Beer is really thin and too sweet for what it is, it has a terrible aftertaste too, kind of like lime flavored soap. I'm totally not into this. This is FAR WORSE than Bud Light IMO. At least I could finish bud light."
"D - If you can hold your nose while drinking this. You'll have no problem downing one on a hot summer day after working yourself to sweat. After quenching your thirst, this beer is useless."
"D- This is a one and done beer. I don't know what made me want to try this but I did. I regret it but hey there is not much I can do about it now. Lime with spashes of tonic water would have the same effect if you want to try this one out!"
"How dare A-B for taking away my American right to put a lime in my mexican style beer, what's the fun in drinking this stuff.. I need to put that lime in myself, I don't trust anybody to do it like I do it, cause i put them limes to good use. I really know how to get the most out of that small wedge. And how dare A-B to take away market share from one of most popular products out of mexico. I mean come on, their ganga sucks, what else do they have.. Somethings gotta give..."
"D - I really don't think this is a horrible beer with a Mexican or spicy dish. It has ok drinkability but it's not something I would tell anyone to go out and buy. This will eventually leave my fridge, especially if I am eating spicy, or I have company over and save the crafts for myself. "
"The Smell or the taste can't decide which one is more offensive.I no way to describe this beer except offensive adjuct filled Skunky beer meets artificial lime,my god,just its like an accident on my palate!!! and no i dont think that real lime could save this beer anyway !!!. undrinkable at best. Clear glass, Yikes!!!! how come beers that come in clear glass almost always get some type of lime? do they really think that will improve it? No lime, will not improve a poorly made adjuct filled beer thats been sitting in clear glass. and no, the canned version did not taste any better when poured in a pint glass. Sorry buds this one is better left alone. lifes short do your self a favour and drink somthing better."
"D- For a hot day, not bad, but might as well drink a watered down 7-up. Not well balanced, artificial tasting, and its only saving grace is its refreshing quality."
"this is not a good beer. This beer is made to be drunk in large quantities. It might be good for chicks or beer bong. I wouldn't be caught dead with this beer again at a party. Also, I wouldn't be too open to pair this with any types of food except wings."
"This is another beer to mow and play golf with. I usually have this in cans when i do have it. Putting the lime in saves a step, but does not improve the taste. It smells and tastes awfull. There is nothing more good to say about it. I would not drink it again."
"Notes: good bitch beer @ 4.2% priced more than BL regular."
"Overall, this beer is pretty straightforward. Doesn't really tastes too much like beer. Drinkable if this is your thing, but not for me."
"The beer pours exactly like regular Bud Light, with a very clear yellow body and a white head. The aroma is very heavy on the lime with a little bit of grain mixed in. The flavor is a mix of lime, along with a lot of sweetness from the malt and grain. Thin body and medium carbonation. Not near as bad as I expected."
"I got an initial finger of foamy, bone-white head with low retention off of the pour. Nose smelled like an artificial lime, like something in a dessert or a cocktail. Color was a light lemon-yellow with NE-plus quality clarity. Mouthfeel was thin-to-medium with a faint effervescence on the tongue along with a mild lime citrusiness. Finish was pretty boring, even for the style. Bland, slightly citrusy, but overall pedestrian."
"Please lets all remember to review a beer with its style in mind. I hate buds and most all other junk even remotely close. I'm embarresed to even carry any Anheuser-Busch product in my fridge. HOWEVER when rolling out of a tent on a warm saturday morning at a weekend festival, this beer can not be beat. I've turned soooo many beer drinkers onto this. Do you really want to start your day off with a fat tire? Instead of hydrating yourself with water... reach for the BL lime. In a junk cooler filled with 30 BLL's and 30 regular Buds you run out of the BBL's way before the buds. Almost a 5.0 morning drinkability. Almost."
"D: As much as I don't consider this really beer I could still have a few if it was a hot summer day and I wanted something cold and refreshing. That being said there are a lot better attempts at lime beers out there. For example Moosehead Light Lime actually has a more beer taste to it with just hints of lime."
"My first ""F" rating."
"The beer basically had no body whatsoever. In one aspect drinkability was good because the beer went very easy, but the lack of flavor and body means this virtually an undrinkable brew. Try only if you lose a bet as well."
"The drinkablity on this brew is decent. I consider myself a person who trys and enjoys beers from all sides of the spectrum. While this isn't one of the normal craft beers I seek, this brew is a great brew for a hot summer night, that you can session super easy."
"D - This is drinkable like a lime wine cooler and I can see what the appeal would be on a hot day, but I wouldn't call it beer."
"I keep this stocked in the bar fridge as it always seems popular with non-beer geek visitors. I have no problem with lime and beer -I've enjoyed many the Corona and lime at the beach, where availability and refreshment trump quality for the moment. But, this is no beer-and-lime, this is a concoction mimicking, rather poorly, that combination. Aroma was a chemical lemon-lime, like Sprite. Flavor had very little beer attributes - just an artificial lime flavor with some malt in there, somewhere. Much more like a flavored malt beverage than beer. Not bad, just not beer."
"Ligt, refreshing. The mouthfeel is the most ""beery"" quality od this drink. Not much of a beer, but beats the pants of any of the ""cooler"" style of drinks."
"Light beer with lime in a huge can. Poured in a Bayern-Pilsener glass. Looks like piss, no foam, no lacing, golden color. Smell: Didn't know if it was beer or sprite, few scents of lime and fructose. Taste: the same, but with much lime. Mouthfeel: Off-thirsty, something crunchy at the finish, no body and little carbonation. Drinkability: Very good the lime taste, better than lemon, but sometimes cloying. Very good for a light beer."
"It isn't disgusting or anything, but there's next to no beer flavor in there. Would I take it over a normal light beer? Probably. At the very least it has *some* flavor!"
"Overall: This is pure swill. Water with Lime Koolaid. There is absolutely nothing redeeming about this beer and no one should be drinking this. Credit the terrible prohibition for the rise of this crap."
"Drinkability- I think that this beer is real easy to drink it just doesnt taste that good."
"Poured out of a clear bottle into my chilled pub glass resulting in a two finger head of white foam which bubbled down to a minimal lace. Color is yellow-light amber, rating a 3 on the SRM chart. Smell of lime over corn and malt. Taste much the same as the smell, lime, corn, wheat, malt, and yeast; balance mostly on the lime. Feels watery - flat in my mouth. Not all that impressed with lime juice poured into light beer, but does have a refreshing taste that is welcome when coming in from a hot day. Still for the price there are better beers out there."
"Pours a bright straw color with visible carbonation and little to no head or lacing. Nose brings forth artificial lime and that's about it. Taste is even worse, and there's no real resemblance to beer. Feel is way overcarbonated and spritzy. Just awful in general. Downright awful"
"Drinkable for the unwashed masses."
"Beer #8 during Swill Tour 2010. It pours a clear pale straw topped by a weak-ass white foamy head. The nose has more fake lime in it than the worst margaritas available on the free market (black market drinks are very nice...I hear...). The taste is limey seltzer water (imbued with fake lime, not British) with a hint of corn syrup. Boo this. The body is too light for its own good, with a light moderate carbonation and a sickly feel. I'm pretty sure there's no good reason to add this kind of lime to any beverage, much less ""premium light lager"". To reiterate something I've said many times already, boo this."
"This one was free! Served from can into a shaker. Poured a golden straw yellow (don't they all?) with a minimal pure white head. There was no lacing evident during this one. The aroma was comprised of lime zest, malt, and pale wheat. The flavor was of malt, wheat, lime juice, and a slight metallic hint. It was light on the palate with mild carbonation. Overall this was wasn't that interesting. Pretty much tastes the same regardless if it was out of a can or a bottle. However, the flavors are a little more pronounced out of the can (this isn't a good thing by the way). I would drink this again, but only if it were given to me or I needed to sober up some..."
"BL Lime is up to the task."
"The appearance is of super pale golden straw with no head to speak of. The aroma is of lime and carbonated soda. Perhaps it is my brain, but with the lime it smells similar to tequila. All of the corn and rice from bud light is masked. The taste is exactly like the smell with a bitterness on the backside. The mouthfeel is OK, but it's carbonation isn't good enough. It was described best as deserving to be over ice like a terrible margarita. In all honesty, it's not that hard to drink this stuff. Actually, IMO, it's better than regular Bud Light, though I have the suspicion that the sugar would get you sick after awhile."
"TERRIBLE! not good at all..this beer is the same crappy beer as bud light with a twist..now they added a bunch of artificial lime flavor which basically tastes like a bunch of candy mixed with beer. Reminiscent of a mexican cervesa with a light body. Overall this beer is not something you want to drink i cant even imagine what a hangover from this beer must be like. Avoid at all costs!"
"The beer pours a pale gold color with a thick fizzy white head that quickly fades to spotty lacing. The aroma is average. It has a thin pilsner malt scent that's weak and watery along with a mild lime aroma. It smells like water with lime juice added. The taste is average. It has a refreshing light lager feel; watered down pilsner malt flavor with zero hop character. It also has a pretty decent lime flavor. It goes down so easy and finishes clean. This is great warm weather beer; nothing a real beer drinker would enjoy. The mouthfeel is average. It is a low bodied beer with adequate/good carbonation. This is your basic light beer that's great for women and pairing with Mexican food."
"I didn't find this one disgusting, even though I let it warm up a bit. And I drank the 22 oz bottle easily."
"On a hot day, I can see knocking back six of these easily."
"Drinkability is moderate to high. The ABV is low making for a sessionable beer. The flavor profile is a gimic, but not completely terrible. It's a vast improvement over regular bud light and I don't find the lime flavor to be overly obnoxious. I could drink more than one actually. World class, definitely not. Lawnmower worthy, why the hell not?"
"D: The saving grace for this ""beer"". To be honest it's one of my guilty pleasures when I don't feel like having a beer and my favorite of the BMC offerings even though I'd be hard pressed to call this a beer."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable as long as you realize this isn't beer at all, but a lime-flavored carbonated Kool-aide-alcohol beverage. Then again I'd never buy it, but as long as it's free..."
"D: Would be drinkable in the summer if you're looking to go cheap and light. I think it accomplishes what it sets out to, for what that's worth. I would drink it if were hot out and I was drinking a lot of it."
"D- I gave this a high rating because of my statement above. When I drink this in the summer, ice cold, I can easily pound a six pack."
"Drinkability: YES YES YES...Football Beer"
"Drinkability: Maybe this beer was drinkable in its past life, but the so-called lime flavor made me want to hurl after a while. If you cover it up with a lot of butter popcorn, then its not so bad."
"aroma is hard to place, but not pleasant. light grain, lots of lime, but artificial as could be, even the wedge of real lime is not helping here. corn and rice mixed in but nothing could take over the lime flavor. thank god i ha hot ass wings which made me incredibly thirsty an helped me put this one down. it was just forced to me, the flavor was too much and too little at the same time if that makes any sense. like flavored water, i just do not see the point."
"If shaken well has about a finger thick head. If you like lime flavored brews, this one is OK. The only major downfall of the cheap beer is the saltiness that really dehydrates you. It almost gives you cottonmouth."
"This beer really is just.... unoffensive. I kinda like the saltiness, and there is not other flavor there. I have had far worse. I've also had FAR better - this is in no way a good beer. Anyway this is drinkable at least. It doesn't look good, smells funny, but goes down ok."
"I had high expectations for this beer. Americans don't want to have to work. And the added lime is a great idea. However, the lime flavoring is way too strong. If i wanted something so sweet in my mouth, I would dip lollipops in vodka. It was a good attempt from bud, and the beer is good for one, maybe two, on a hot day, but once you try to drink it continuously, the lime flavoring can make a hard stomach turn"
"So there you go. It tastes like a very light beer with some lime added to it. That's much better than an alcopop and much better than a beer that's flavored like a margarita. Of all the things you could possibly consume mindlessly, this isn't nearly the worst. It's still not even close to good."
"d- well, honestly i wasn't expecting much out of this beer, but i didn't think it would be this bad, i wouldn't drink this again, just not a good beer."
"The mouth feel is of course a light lager and or Sprite. This beer offers to mainstream American beer drinkers the shandy or radler. Enjoy on a nice Summer's hot day and don't hate this attempt at something different."
"D: Blech. I drank this at a party because it was all that was available. I really tried to keep an open mind, but the flavor was just too sickly sweet and artificial to be enjoyable. As the beer warmed, the experience kept getting worse. I guess this would be OK ice cold on a hot summer day."
"The lime flavored seems fake and engineered, which is what the beer tastes like. It's weak, no head at all, and a lot of fizzy carbonation. It's sorta like a gross lime soda."
"D: Drinkable. If I were to choose from all the major macros this is not bad. Wouldn't buy it if I weren't into beer and needed an easy rec drink for a party."
"I never thought I'd say a beer was worse than corona, but this is terrible."
"Not terrible, but nothing to write home about. Good beer for refreshment on hot summer days."
"D- I couldn't finish this one at all. Took three swigs and gross."
"Drinkability - Someone left these at my house, so I tried one. Absent similar circumstances, I never will again. This beer is, to me, everything that's bad about the mass beer market. Insipid, marketing driven, and inauthentic."
"I would suggest that you avoid this brew at all cost."
"D: It's not a good beer by any stretch but it is drinkable. I wouldn't typically choose this but it's no worse than any other light beer I've tried, and maybe a little better depending on what you're doing while drinking. It's a beer that tastes best freezing cold of course."
"Drinkability - At least it's easy to drink, haha. I don't know why you'd want to drink it but its like drinking Lime seltzer water."
"D: I found myself drinking this beer very quickly. Maybe it is because the taste dissipates from my palate so quickly or maybe I just wanted to end this experience. I could see myself getting acid reflex after a couple of these."
"cheers!"
"D - Oddly drinkable... Quaffable... A good beer for a hot summers night in the absence of quality alternatives... A mili-step improvement over most BMC alternatives..."
"Drinkability- This beer is perfect if you're so indecisive that you can't choose between having a beer and having a Sprite. It might make a good addition to certain margarita recipes; however, on its own, it should be passed over for something better."
"clear yellow, thin head. Smells like sprite. Tastes like lime soda, no malt or hops to speak of. It's actually not awful, but it's NOT beer - really it's an alcopop or a beer cooler. You'd be better off adding a shot of vodka to your lemonade. Don't waste your money on this thinking that it's anything other than Budweiser's answer to mike's hard lemonade or smirnoff ice."
"It tastes like any lemon or lime flavored cleaning product. Better than most of Bud's offerings."
"Drinkability - Same repeat-drinkability as the Light version, but with a very slight improvement in the taste."
"I tried this beer after purchasing a singlke can from the 'singles' bin at one of my local LCBO outlets. The beer pours a translucent gold colour with a generous white head that disappears quickly. The aroma is phenolic in nature and not appealing at all. The mouthfeel is weak bodied, flat, and lightly carbonated (odd considering the huge head). The flavour is flat, citrusy, and weakly malty. This is a pretty bad beer even by swill standards which makes it even more surprising that the masses love it so much."
"BUT NOT BEER!!!"
"Goes down easy but due to the lack of flavor, I'm not sure that I want to take another sip. This beer tastes and feels very similar to lime flavored sparkling water. It is refreshing but I would hesitate to call it a beer."
"acl/vol."
"This is a young guy and gal beer. It'd probably be popular with 20 somethings. I could easily down a six pack these without coming up for air. They're that easy to drink and taste pretty damn good, better than ice tea or lemonade. I wish I would have had a whole cooler of these at the airshow I was at Sunday."
"D - one was enough for me.. i drank it so i could laugh at it.. and i know bmc doesn't care about me.. i'm a big minority.. i would never bash anyone who puts forth an honest effort in producing a good beer.. this was not that.. this is an absolute joke.. but obviously so many people like this, i see it fly off the shelves.. so hats off to bmc for great marketing and managing to convince people that this garbage tastes good..."
"It's basically Corona with lime, but if you're too cheap to actually pay for Corona with lime. Everything has a very ""fake"" sort of taste to it. If you remember Texuiza from the late 90's, this is basically what it tastes like. Bud light goes south of the border with a touch of very fake lime. That being said... it's very drinkable. :-)"
"Paler than pale yellow. Thin wispy white head. Smells like lime. Doesn't smell like beer at all but it does smell like lime. Taste like Sprite. Hey I like the taste of Sprite so this is much better than I was expecting. Not much mouthfeel at all. A little bit of carbonation. Wait, I can't really feel it in my mouth. It is drinkable and it's refreshing. It was actually very good at the minor league ball game I was attending and it was free to boot. To be the only beer available it could have been worse. It could have been regular Bud Light."
"Crap...what am I saying? I haven't had a Bud product in years...."
"God this is nasty. The only thing I'd use it for would be in a beer batter for fish! Ptooie! I don't know what they were thinking about when they came up with this, but it sure wasn't ""good beer"". I'm sorry but they really missed with this crap brew."
"Overall, if I had to choose something to drink at a party with only BMC, this would be my go-to."
"This is the Natty Light of cerveza style beers. Unless it was the only thing available, ahhh, I'm not kidding anyone. If it was the only thing available I would not drink, or get a margarita. Bud Light Lime sucks even compared to Miller Chill, and it tastes like Bud Ice compared to the likes of a Dos Equis. Stay away. Stay very far away."
"Drinkability: this was one of the worst flavored beers I can remember having. Almost like pouring concentrated lime juice in a light beer. Avoid this at all costs."
"I also like the lime flavor, despite others saying it's too overpowering. It adds much needed character, waking up swill that would otherwise be snooze-worthy. Anyone who drinks beer should at least give BL Lime a shot in the right setting unless their Friday nights consist of chatting with the book club or crocheting socks."
"Anyway, I was a gamer to at least give this a whirl. When Mike brought it to my table, shaking his head, apologizing for not warning me what selection #8 on mini tour was, I saw a typical yellow fizzy brew I could just about read my newspaper through. I thought to myself, ""ok, this is gonna be like Bud Light. I can do this as even though I wouldn't buy BL, I can get one down."" There was very little carbonation in the glass and very little aroma. I took a sip and said to myself, yes, this is a Bud Light. Very thin mouthful and very little taste. I swallowed the sip, thinking I'd get through the shaker glassful. Then it hit me: God-awful over-powering lime flavor. I took a sip of water to cleanse the pallot, and tried again. Yep, same thing at first, then that NASTY lime flavor hit. This time several sips of water couldn't get rid of the nasty aftertaste. My girlfriend said the lime taste reminded her of some kind of medicine she took as a child. I choked down one shaker of this monstroscity; she couldn't do more than one sip of her's and I couldn't finish it for her. Don't know what AB was thinking but this one is definitely not worth the time and effort to brew. Warning, Will Robinson. Danger, Danger. Avoid this one!!"
"Overall: It's definitely a girl drink, but not a bad one. At least it's an attempt at beer. I definitely hope this one stays on the market. Good well with spicy food."
"D- I gotta say, I could drink this all day outside. I mean, literally all day and never get tired of it. Maybe I just really like lime, but something about this makes it so damn appetizing on a hot day outside. Ridiculously drinkable, despite lackluster construction."
"D - If you are in the mood for a sugary soft drink... you could prolly drink a lot of these. I on the other hand don't want diabetes so I poured it down the drain. A ""light lager"" HA"
"If you want something easy to drink with a citrus flavor, then by all means, this beer is for you. Those of you who are interested in actual beer, than I'd recommend something else."
"This beer smells rank, is nothing special to look at, feels like hoppy water in your mouth, is not remotely drinkable, and most importantly, has a gross taste that seems to scream: ""I am generic and lame!"""
"Pours a light yellow color, nice carbonation, small white head, with some sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, with some hops, slight caramel. The taste is slightly sweet, malty, slight hop note, some citrus. Light body. Not drinkable, would not buy again."
"It's actually drinkable if you like alcoholic lime juice. Probably the best Anheuser product because the lime taste covers up the nasty bud recipe."
"Drinkability: Tastes almost nothing like beer and has very little taste anyway besides metallic lime. This might be nice outside on a hot day but there are still many, many better choices..."
"Drinkability: This beer was just a total failure. Even the drinkability was shitty due to the heavy amount of carbonation."
"This beer is ok, for a budlight. It has a nice little lime taste to it, that makes it easy to drink! I did not mind it at all! I would have this one before any of the macrobrews, probably because the lime taste covers what really is under! haha Would not recommend this to a friend!"
"Notes: Not a big fan of the lime flavor. I don't really like it, but at least it adds some kind of flavor to the traditional Macro. (Whether that's a good thing or not, I'm not sure)"
"Drinkability- you could knock a few of these back if nothing else was available."
"330ml bottle from my parents' fridge. They had some friends over and Bud Lime was the beer of choice (sigh). Light, clear yellow with almost no head, despite an aggressive pour. Aroma is lime, adjuncts, and Canada Dry Ginger Ale. Uh-oh! I'm in for a soda pop beer! Taste is lime, low calorie club soda, water, and a hollow, contrived sweetness that often appears in soft drinks flavoured with Aspartame. Thin-bodied mouthfeel with lots of carbonation, a sharp bite mid body, and some lime dryness to finish. I can't say this is 'refreshing' because it doesn't taste good. Really just a pop-like beverage that shamefully uses the word 'beer' in its name. A drain pour, and therefore an 'F' in my books."
"The color is a real light yellow color with medium carbonation. The smell at first is not really that great. The taste is good although the lime does over power the beer. The mouthfeel is good it is light in the mouth and goes down smooth. Drinkablility is decent it goes great with some chips and dip!"
"At our liquor store, which is situated in a not-so-prosperous part of town, we use a case of Bud Light Lime to prop open the back door. It has never been stolen to date. Empties are regularly stolen. That's all pretty much all the review you need..."
"Cheers"
"Golden color. Well balanced lime and beer flavor. The aroma is pretty much the same but less enjoyable. Very light body and easy drinking. Pretty good for what it is, beats off corona with or without the lime. I guess this one will be pretty popular, nice job."
"12oz. bottle. Pours fizzy yellow with a while head. Fake, nasty lime flavor mixed with cheap, nasty light beer. I'd rather drink regular Bud Light, and I hate Bud Light. I'm sure it's a top-notch beer for those that really don't like beer, but really love artificial fruit flavoring."
"Bud Light Lime isn't anything that is too special. It is simply a very light beer with a strong lime flavor. It's not a terrible beer, it just isn't special. Bud Light Lime is very easy to drink and is something a little different. You would probably be better of just drinking a Mexican beer with a lime in it (Corona, Modelo, ect.)."
"This might be good with mexican food, but it's really not good at all."
"this one, im not so sure about this one. id rather have this than a bud light. the lime taste is just so artificial. but, its drinkable. when it comes to breaking down appearance, smell, blah, blah,.. just not gonna waste my time with it. its a bud light with artificial lime taste."
"D: Despite what lots of fellow BAs say, I don't mind this brew. It's great on a hot summer day. It's by no means a finely crafted brew, but it can be very refreshing. The way I see it, this is a girly drink that men can get away with drinking without getting jeers from our buddies."
"Bottle pours pale yellow, with some detergent white head, soon dissapearing. Unpleasant cheesy beer aroma, with some lime. Taste is on lighter side, astringent taste, with some lime. Could not get down more than a couple of sips. Nasty, but was expecting even worse."
"$8.88 for a cold sixer at my local gas station. What is that saying on the back of one of my tee shirts? something about ""Fizy yellow beer is for wussies"" Well this 12 ounce bottle pours and the first thing that comes to mind is Fizzy yellow beer! Light yellow, clear, near white heat that quickly departs, no lace, no film, no nada of interest...artificial lime smell, thin taste of lightest of malts, faint hop dryness in the finish. Goes down easy, moderate citrus note...would work as a quaffer on a hot day...best I can say is ""lawn mower beer"""
"The short story is that this beer tastes almost exactly like Fruit Loops cereal. The lime flavor does not feel ""natural"" but instead very extract-like. Really one of the worst beers I've ever tasted, and evidence of a disturbing trend--and I've actually warmed up to having a regular BudLight here and there. Not snobbery, this is just gross."
"Not good. Thats the simple summary. The carbonation is soda like and is not reminiscent of beer. The lime is again not lime like and is flagrantly artificial tasting. The artificial lime overpowers the weak flavor of the bud light. This is far from the worst beer ever made, it can be drank, but I see little reason anyone would really want to."
"comparison to other lime beers, namely Miller Chill, but i feel i must. While Miller Chill actually does a litle something for me with its somewhat confectionary and artificial salty/limey taste, this beer is just a weak light beer with a hint of lime. Id almost rather pull the faux pas of putting a lime wedge in a slightly more flavorable beer."
"Pale golden pour with a white spritzy head. All lime and faint hops in the aroma. The taste is very limey. Minimal hop presence and by that I mean look real hard and you might detect them. Some alcohol and lime soda character. Very much like a lime ginger ale. I found this beer to be too sweet, to the point of eroding ones teeth enamel. Still it was very refreshing and went down fast and easy. If nothing else was around I wouldn't mind throwing a whole six of these back. Not the type of beer you look forward to, but very drinkable and I believe that was Budweiser's intention. Just drink it cold because all desire for this one is gone when it warms up."
"basically it goes down smooth...makes me think of the beach and i can drink a bunch and still be coherent."
"d- i mean, lots of people really dog on this beer. i understand, it's not a ""pure"" beer. but no one buys this thinking their getting a DFH or Stone product. you know what you're getting. its a bud light canvas with lime juice poured all over it. i won't drink another, but i mean, people don't need to have unrealistic expectations of it."
"Overall- Basically a lime flavored soda, with heartburn!"
"Cheers!"
"Drinkability? If I was forced to buy a sixer of this, the other 5 would go down the drain. Since it was just the one I had to deal with, I managed to finish the bottle. What a chore that was! At least the BL Wheat was a decent brew...."
"The mouthfeel is watery light and the high carbonation makes it spritzy like a soda. It's very easy to drink and sort of refreshing - it's just not beer."
"A crappy beer of course, but probably not quite as crappy as I was expecting. Still, I'm pretty sure this will be the last BLL I will ever drink. However, to my credit (I think), I was able to drink nearly a third of the glass of this stuff before drain pouring it."
"Poured from a clear 22 oz. bottle. Has a pale yellow with a 1/2 inch head and lots of carbonation. Smells like limes, some notes of corn. Tastes just like it smells, lots of lime here. Feels light in the mouth and has good drinkability. Overall there is definatly more flavor here than your average light beer."
"Mouthfeel is thin bodied with high carbonation, very spritzy and carbonated. Honestly as a beer this sucks but I can see why people would like it. Easy enough to drink and basically tastes and feels like Sprite."
"Lightly sweet & citric, little bit of syrupy concentrate, spritzy(though not irritating) carbonation, & if you can tolerate the ""natural"" flavor", it's easier then ordinary Bud Lite to put down."
"trouble is, within the same can it tasted like lemonade in some sips, water in others. If you like light beer it's ok, but it's not worth paying store price for. Giving it a 4 on drinkability because it's light, so one could drink a lot of these if they chose to."
"D - On a nice summer float trip, I could drink this all day. The light body and high carbonation really take it easy on the tongue."
"Drinkable? It's a light lager."
"I recommend you try this if you are looking for a light, refreshing alternative. You may be pleasantly surprised!"
"Final Thoughts: Well, I knew I wasn't going to like Bud Light Lime, but at least now I can sorta understand the appeal. This beer is a big time guzzler and for people who aren't a fan of bitterness. It's not as bad as I thought it would be, and isn't as bad as a lot of people are making it out to be, but I wouldn't buy this. I'll stick to a Brava with a wedge of actual lime."
"Overall, this is an impressive offering from A-B, and here's why: they keep pushing the absolute boundary of how bad you can make a beer and use their incredible marketing power to make it outsell the entire craft brewing industry. They could probably make Natty Light Tapeworm Infested Pig Feces and have it break 1% overall beer market share. Whoever the ad wizards who came up with this one are, they truly are ""real men of genius."""
"Feels very light, and a bit overly carbonated. I could slam about a million of these if I didnt decide after one or two that I wanted to taste some hops or actual beer."
"Think of it as a bud light smoothie..."
"D-Ugh. As I said, it's rather refreshing, but it's simply not beer."
"Pretty drinkable, though the lime overpowers and would, at least for me, become too much after probably two bottles. Reminiscent of the alcopops that have begun to take hold of the German market, this stuff is hardly any more beer-like than Sprite. The big guys need to realize that lime isn't added to Corona because it makes such a delicious drink. Good beer doesn't come in clear bottles."
"Overall if you like lime with your beer it maybe for you...."
"got this one at a friend's house ice cold opened it and a faint smell of beer hidden behind a wif of lime. the taste was faint it went down easy. nothing i would drink, if you can stand the lime taste go for it. i would rather not have fruit in my beer. but i guess some people like this"
"MF/D: Too fizzy for me, over-carbonated, light in body, short twangy sour note to finish"
"D: Went down extremely quick in the summer sun, but my palate was quickly bored. There's more out there for summer quaffing than this, thank God."
"D- I will not drink any more of these if I have a say so."
"I was surprised that this beer tasted pretty clean and crisp, it is just simple and all about lime flavoring. Would I buy it? No. I know my fellow BAs like to bash such a beer with low review scores, but one has to consider who this beer is brewed for. This is for people who don't want beer. I see see this as a competitor for Smirnoff Ice or Mike's Hard Whatever, and I would rather have this than those sugarbombs."
"It's no small wonder this stuff flies off the shelves though - for all I knock it, I've pounded this stuff back pretty quick. And that bothers me. It's like I'm just meant to pound it back without thinking of that ""nasty"" beer taste the good folks at Anheuser-Bush have worked so hard to mask for me. The problem is, I like beer, and good beer is worth savouring. I'm all for brewers coming up with interesting new flavours, and not against fruit beers, but this stuff wasn't made to appeal to people who like good beer. It's more like malternative than beer. Like a batch that got churned out when the filtration system used on the base was broken down, so they couldn't get the colour out of it. It's one saving grace is that unlike it's brethren coolers, it isn't cloyingly sweet from added sugar."
"Even the bros got tricked, they gave this product a c-, son of a gun!Whats the world of beer come to?"
"drinkability- Overall for me I could not have more then one or two of these max just to sweet and soda like, could imagine having so many of these i got drunk, They are not gross and I just had to try one with all the buzz they are catching right now, not terrible but not for me, doesnt matter what I think its becoming a summertime beast for years to come"
"(From tasting notes recorded 31 Jul 2009)"
"Refreshing, but that's about it. I can understand the popularity, but not my thing."
"Taste: While the taste is actually pretty good it is not a beer taste. There is nothing that would even make this seem like a beer besides the appearance. It tastes almost like a lime pop but not like the lime added pops, it has its own unique taste. Slightly sweet with a strong lime flavor."
"Yup, this ""brew"" is pretty tasty, but, not to sound like a broken record, this isn't really beer in my book. If I were a bettin' man, I'd say they just blended a high octane version of their Bud Light with seltzer water. Whatever sorcery is at work behind this product, I'll say that they hit some sort of nail on the head. This is a very tasty, easy to drink beer/lime seltzer water that I look forward to drinking this summer and in summers to come."
"T- Lime. It tastes like lime drink. You cannot taste any real alcohol. It's pure lime. Way too overpowering."
"alas.. once again one finds themself at a bbq where the only beer selections are dismal. After 2 hours in the sun you can no longer deal with the torturous drought and you cave, accepting the horrible swill just to keep from perishing. This beer looks terrible. It smells like artificial lime scent. Tastes like citrus kitchen cleaner, really like pine-sol or some lemon-scented dish liquid. The mouthfeel is your standard, and so it isn't offensive like the flavor. As for drinkability.. it is easy to chug, in fact its a lot more soda-like than beer. But ""drinkability"" should also consider the beer's ability to make you WANT to drink more of it, and this beer does not."
"Overall, if I had to have a macro on a hot summer day, this would not be it. The only way this beer is tolerable is if it's ice cold and you have half a bottle. While the lime juice wasn't intolerable off the bat, it builds as you drink it and that synthetic flavor just becomes too much."
"Great as a lawn-mower beer or with BBQ on a hot day, but it comes off as an alco-pop. Not nearly as good as other lime beers I've tried."
"looks the part of your typical american light lager. smells and tastes the same (which is to say, not much) but with an artificial lime thing dominating. a bit sweeter than regular BL to balance the artificial tartness i suppose. taste gets old real quick, but i guess i'd drink this over a regular BL, as there is some kind of actual flavor in here, fake or not."
"I guess I rated this beer a little to good, but in terms of taste it really wasn't bad. It's just the fact that it doesn't resemble beer that makes most ""Beer Advocates"" afraid to touch it. If you're at a BBQ and want a refreshing drink sift through that community cooler and reach for one of these. If you're in the mood for a manly man's beer, look look somewhere else."
"sad to say, it's horrid compared to bud/coor's light and i've never purchased those beer..."
"D- I could not drink this. The bad aftertaste ruined any drinkability that it had for me."
"D - Underwhelming is an understatement. I was expecting a little bit more beeriness, but there just isn't any here."
"Bottle from the LCBO- A pale yellow pour, with a fizzy and short lived white fizz. Nose is lime-aid like, a bit floral, pale malts. Just really limey. Tastes stale, of cardboard, corn, some sweet artificial lime, with a strange acrid bitterness left in the mouth. Has a lingering taste of artificial lime and straw. Not good at all."
"Pours light yellow color, thin bodied, low alcohol volume, 0 foam head, the sinthetical lime juice that has in it makes it taste like the aftertaste of vomit, this is, by far, the worst beer i have ever tried, but we were out of options, it was a hot day, there was no choice. I will never ask the dude that brought them again to bring beer to any of my friend reunions."
"Keep away."
"Taste: Much like the smell. Artificial lime. More like a gross lime soda than a beer."
"Not horrible; serviceable; but not really a beer that you can break down the complexities of;"
"Wow. I actually LOVE macro garbage with frozen limeade. Gimme a Bud Light and some of that frozen concentrate and I will have a great summer afternoon. But this beer somehow completely fucked up that formula. It's like they can't even make shitty beer right. I'm randomly disappointed by this one."
"AVOID this product (notice that I don't even call this a beer!). AVOID."
"had a second one on vacation opened and passed too me by an old friend who loved it dearly. same as my first rating above. not very good in my books, but my buddy knows a good beer when he tastes one, so im surprised cause he would have fought defending this ones honor. i just dont get it i guess"
"This beer is sweet, not something I enjoy in the drinkability factor. This beer should be drank slowly and one will do. It tastes like a mixture of tequiza, bud light, and extra sweetened lime."
"Beware!"
"Bottle: Poured a clear bright golden color lager with a fizzy head. Taste of lime is not overly dominant or too fake to be gross. Not as bad as I had expected just closer to lemonade then actual beer. Somewhat reminiscent of Twist Shandy that used to be brewed by Labatt."
"Notes - It's an obvious attempt to horn in on the Corona market. Hard to say which one's worse."
"The only reason why I know about this beer is because of my early, unexperienced drinking days. Even then I hated it. here I am a year later letting out my anger."
"It is beer for people who don't like beer. Thanks Mark for saving me the temptation of paying to try this."
"Pours a clear, not-so-fizzy yellow, with bubbly white foam that dissipates fairly quickly leaving no head. The smell is a strong lime zest aroma from the outset, with some lime and lemon aromas and a bit of malt aroma beneath. The taste is dominated by lime with some lemon and a hint of sugar. The citrus flavors fade toward the finish to reveal a bit of malt beneath, but the lime lingers after. The mouthfeel is dry and citric, with light body and modest carbonation feel. This is a refreshing beverage, like a lemonade, but the beer qualities are overwhelmed by the lime."
"I don't know if it's beer....but I like it!"
"Not as bad as I expected, granted my expectations were low. Taste was a bit of lime and very little malt with almost nothing else going on. The smell was like alkaseltser heartburn lemon lime flavor. It wasn't an offensive taste though giving it enough drink ability to drink a few of."
"This beer is 100% for the summertime, it cools me down and goes down smooth. Perfect for floating down the river with my freinds. Its mouthfeel is less than exciting but its very drinkable and does the job its supposed to do, refresh and releave you from the heat of the beach."
"The beer that has taken Vancouver by storm ( no joke, all the beer stores are telling me that they sell out so quickly that they have to put signs on the door so they don't get asked every minute whether they have Bud Light Lime). Ironically it retails for around $14-15 which is more than Carib and a bunch of limes. I tried some of my fiances beer on a patio where every drinker but 2 had this beer ( I was one of the two). It is Corona with artificial lime flavour which makes Corona look good. The one about Carib( the best of this beach beer style) is that with a real lime in the bottle it makes a refreshing lime/beer drink accented by the taste of a real lime. When you take a crappy version of the style and add artificial lime flavouring then you get this overhyped , overpriced monstrocity."
"Don't try this unless you want to look cool on the beach , that's about all it seems good for."
"I don't care what any beer snobs say, this is the most refreshing beer I've ever had. This stuff is made for the summertime. The look is typical macro through the bottle. No need to pour this into anything but your mouth. Great lime scent and taste. A beer made for the golf course, which is why I'm very grateful it now comes in cans. I love my IIPA's and wheats, but when I want to beat the heat and get sauced doing it, this is the ticket!"
"d- goes down easy, decent price, easy to come by... so in my opinion good drinkability"
"This is a very refreshing drink--like a cool glass of water. Nothing beer-like stands out, and I don't think I'd reach for it if I wanted a beer."
"Flavor is not all that awful, possibly an improvement on normal bud light. But after a while it basically tastes like a lime seltzer, including the non-existent mouthfeel. So watery, so little real flavor, but not as artificial as I was expecting. Refreshing, yes (if cold enough). Worth it by BA standards, no."
"Nothing to write home about, but it does its job on hot Summer days..."
"I'll be honest, I reviewed partly on my own taste and not entirely to style. To style, this is dead on, but I don't care for it. I mixed the scores a bit. Pardon me..."
"D- Blah. My tap water is a better way to quench my thirst and there are much better and more efficient ways to get alcohol in your blood."
"Even though I'm not too impressed by this beer. I still think it's better than regular Bud Light."
"It looks like beer, to my surprise. Pale, pale yellow. White head that disappears quick with no lacing. It smells sweet. Like Sprite or Sierra Mist or something. Tastes like Fruit Loops. Specifically green Fruit Loops. Behind the dominate fruity assault, there's a faint, dry, grainy taste in the background. If you use your imagination this kinda tastes like cheap key lime pie. The bottle says ""Natural Lime Flavor"" but I say bullshit. Everyone has squeezed a lime into a Corona. Natural lime flavor doesn't taste like green Fruit Loops. That being said, the beer does go down easy. The only thing that would stop me from having several of these (if they were free) would be the shame of being seen with one in my hand."
"D - While its one terrible excuse for a beer (this could pass for a smrinoff ICE or something), it works for what it's going for and thats summer drinkability for the masses. Ok summer beer I hope to never have again. I may not even bother finishing it."
"The problem with this beer is that it isn't really beer. It is a malt beverage that is made for young adults and women who don't like beer, but want to be trendy. My girlfriend loves it. It is easy to drink, and refreshing, but this is NOT beer, and it IS a complete disgrace to the traditional lager and lime. My advice to Bud is to take this beer, remove the alcohol, and market it to teens. They can have it over ice and still feel ""cool."" Thanks Anheuser-Busch, but I think I can add lime to my own beer in the future -- after all, if I wanted a margarita, I'd have ordered one..."
"This is pretty much a very weak fizzy margarita - bubbles, dextrose, lime, watered down alcohol. I'd call this a chick drink, but I'm afraid the women I know would beat me senseless for saying so...my drinking buddy left the majority of the bottle on the bar - case closed. The bartender said we're getting Miller Chill soon in our province, like that's any consolation."
"Overall, a decent, flavorless, fake tasting offering from AB. Avoid if possible. Not the worst option for a party."
"Overall: A good beer for an outdoor barbecue."
"It does have drinkablility in the sense that it has soda-like sweetness and a watered down taste. Goes down easy, but there is no substance to it. I'm also drinking this one quickly because I don't want to know how it tastes when it warms up a little."
"It should be noted, however, that it does taste and drink just like a soda pop. It has the unmistakable texture of artificial carbonation, an unnaturally sweet flavour (one that is likely to appeal to children, no less) and is (somewhat) refreshing. That last point is really contingent on weather and one's level of thirst. Bottom line: anything that tastes less like Bud Light is better than Bud Light in my books."
"D-No thanks. Its all lime and no beer. This is more like some kind of flavored malt liquor, than an actual fruit beer. I can't even say that the style is identifiable."
"Light golden color typical of this style. Heavily carbonated with a white bubbly carbonation that is constantly re-energized as you drink. Pretty much just a sweet citrus smell. There's really not much bear to taste here, mostly just the unusually sweet lime. The brew in and of itself is not overly sweet, just the lime component. It also has a bit of a salty palette. I don't know if this is done meaningfully specifically for this brew, as I find the palette of most Budweiser products to have a similar salty feel. Either way, it's there. If you don't really like Bud Light, this will be a plus for you because the Bud Light taste is drowned out. Light bodied, overly carbonated. As you progress through this brew, the flavor seems to weaken and ""thin out"". By the time you reach the end, it's mostly flavor-less. I guess the drinkability is fine if you've been mowing the lawn, or painting the house and just want some adult refreshment that's a bit different."
"Drinkability is good. If you don't care about taste or anything this is definitely a beer one could drink all day long. On a hot day Bud Light Lime would not be an awful selection, but very close to an awful selection. I wouldn't turn these down at a barbeque if they were the only beers being served, but I would probably emasculate the crap out of anyone serving it."
"It does look a tad refreshing in the commercials but when I saw it in person I was not impressed at all. The taste was like Grahm Crackers with lime in it. It did not taste a thing like Beer to me. It was a little on the weak side. I am not going to say don't try it because I know tons who like it. But, it's not my kind of brew and I am not a Bud person."
"This beer is not good. I couldn't finish the entire bottle. I expected someting along the lines of putting a lime in a Corona or Dos Equis but this is a totally different, and worse, experience."
"Presentation: Packaged in a twelve-ounce clear glass long neck bottle, served in a standard tap glass."
"Color is an uninspiring clear straw-yellow, and the white head is thin and dissipates quickly. Aroma is strongly of lime, the best aspect of this particular beer. Flavor is thin, and despite a good hint of lime fails to inspire. Texture is a little tingly but not enough to make up for its wateriness."
"Drinkability: I got this on a cruise and my though was not again. I like fruit beers to taste like fruit and beer. This tastes like something I would get from Dairy Queen not a beer. If I want Dairy Queen, I will go there instead."
"It is going to be quite amusing to review this and Cable Car on back to back days."
"D = Ok....While not a beer and not a wine cooler, this is a beverage that may do well at a concert or on a boat or at the beach, accompanied by some Jimmy Buffet music. Other than that, I'll pass."
"I deserve better. You deserve better. Humanity . . . deserves better."
"Very little beer taste. Absolutely no bitterness. More lime than beer. I can't say much else about this ""drink"". Good, but shouldn't even be on this site with ""beer""."
"Ive seen soft drinks hold a better head... looks and smells a lot like a corona, but friends, dont be fooled... If you think corona is garbage (you'd be right) and this is worse than that... very light, almost not there...kind of like drinking water, but somehow its lighter than water... I wouldn't pour this beer in my backyard if that gives you any indication of drinkability..."
"D: This isn't drinkable, this is poundable, now I can see why people buy this shit. Pound it and move on to the next. There isn't really anything to enjoy here, just some lime flavor on top of cornflakes. I'm not impressed by it. But, given the right situation, I could drink a few of these. Is it better than Keystone, you bet, better than Coors Light, marginally, better than regular Bud Light, marginally. Around my buddies still in college, and their fridges, I'd reach for this."
"The appearance of this is only one step darker than water. The smell is downright offensive. It literally smells like a lime flavored candy. There isn't a hint of beer taste to be found in this concoction, only some lime-flavored I-don't-know-what. The mouthfeel isn't bad. It's like other AB products, or water. I will never drink another one of these. There is absolutely no redeeming qualities for this useless swill."
"Ok is this beer? All I could taste was lime, there was no hint of lime, it was all lime in every drink. Other than that it looks like Bud Light, is thin and watery like Bud Light, but where at least you could chug Bud Light this crap is like chugging a lime-aid with extra fizz. I can't accurately review this since I can't give 0 scores in any category. Worst ""beer"" I've ever drank."
"D- Not the worst beer out there, but I would never again purchase it."
"i did it i tried it .. as a home brewer and beer geek i did it ..at first look its a light yellow.. not much head.. not impressed..taste was like dish soap. and limey.. smell was limey.. aonly good if you are fishing and u like coranas and dont want to cut up a lime with fishy hands"
"This is not a beer. I am convinced it one of those Clearly Canadian flavored waters with some yellow food coloring. There is no malt or hop flavors at all. To it's credit, it is not the foulest thing AB has put out on the market. God only knows why my sister in law loves this stuff..."
"This beer pours a clear pale gold color. The head is one inch in height, and recedes within seconds to almost no lacing. The aroma is of lemon jolly rancher (not lime, but lemon how odd). There are absolutely no beer qualities to the aroma. The taste is surprisingly pleasant. Like the aroma it is more candy or wine cooler like than beer like. In fact if I were blind folded I would probably guess that this was a soda. The mouthfeel is light bodied with high carbonation, but not annoyingly high the was most macro beers are. Overall, this is something I will not be drinking again. I like beer too much to waste my time drinking things that aren't beery."
"Appearance is straw colored, crisp dissapating head with no lace. Smell of mainly lime and other adjuncts. Taste has a refreshing lime flavor that goes down with a lot of carbonation with a light mouthfeel. I can see this being a quencher on a hot day without being to filling at a BBQ."
"Avoid at all costs. If you want lime with your beer, just stick a wedge of lime in it and drink it. No need to go this far and make a glorified lime seltzer-flavored beer."
"D. NO! dont do it unless it's free.."
"D 3.0 - It's different which I can appreciate, but it's not in my top 10 or anything. It's strange for sure. I like it better than Miller Chill. It's okay if you are after this type of thing."
"D: I had a lot of trouble finishing just one."
"Out of all the AB products this would probably be my second favorite behind American Ale, but that still isn't saying much. This beer isn't really useful except something cheap and refreshing to drink on the beach or by the pool in summer..."
"I don't understand how several reviews mention that this beer is tasty and refreshing, often with mexican food...yet still rate this as a D or lower?"
"That said, I bet this would be a great beer to cook with for a lot of stuff! It might be worth keeping a 6-pack in your fridge when you need beery acidic accents!"
" 3)Wives and Husbands: when they want to venture to where the construction worker goes and leave their wine coolers behind, she'll pick this up because she has bought into the advertisers' image--she wants to be your bikini model. Husbands like it when his wife wants to be the naughty bikini model."
"D- Having an ice cold BLL after a hard day of work is actually quite refreshing. There is nothing wrong with this beer taste wise, but it borders on being a wine cooler."
"D - This beer wasn't horrible however I'm glad that it was free and its just not for me"
" Very easy to drink, not a displeasing taste, and could definitely down a bunch of these in one sitting, not that I would want to. Ever."
"Yellow golden color . Typical short lived large white head. Aroma is citrus and lime filled, no real hints of malt or hops... Flavor is mostly lime flavoring of some sort and citrus zest, bits of salt. Dry prickly mouthfeel,funky metallic aftertaste, not very good."
"Very much a lawnmower beer here light and refreshing and not meant to be any masterpiece. Pretty much an American version of Shandy/Radler."
"You shouldn't either."
"Pours a pale, clear yellow. 1/5 inch head with no retention and no lacing. Smells of a strong lime aroma; reminiscent of a lime soda. Fits the style more of a fruit/vegetable beer than an american adjunct lager (at least on taste). Smooth, average crispness, high carbonation. Tastes of lime flavoring up front with a thin lager background. Besides the overpowering lime flavor the lager is almost like water. Doesn't remind me of a beer so much as a lime soda. Overall, not very good at all, unless you're extremely hot and need something to cool you off."
"Great beer for none beer drinkers, and those who just want something different from all those heavy micros."
"Just a side note though- I had another bottle last night with tacos, it went pretty well with that."
"I've used the ""lost at sea"" scenario for other light beers, so I might as well use it again. If I was lost at sea with sharks all around and the sun beating down, I could certainly go for a few of these, and as an added bonus, they'd help me fight scurvy! I'm only kidding of course, well, not really. I do like it, but I kind of can't respect it as a beer. I've enjoyed a few at parties, and they go down really easy. It's just that overall I find it kind of lacking. The lime flavor dominates, so why use beer as the base? Vodka and lime works for me just as well. Of course, this is easy. Hmmm? Let me just go with ""it is refreshing. And it tastes good. And it's drinkable""."
"If you mixed a fizzy lime soda with a Bud Light, this is what you would get. There is nothing impressive about this beer (can you call it that?). At first, the lime scent isn't that bad, it's almost refreshing. After a while it kind of became overpowering and I dreaded having to take a whiff. The taste is fizzy lime drink with no hops or malts detectable. Nevertheless, it's fairly drinkable, so it's not a complete loss."
"(rated Aug 14, 2008)"
"D- Very drinkable for this style. The lime flavor sets it apart from others."
"The feel is good, it's trying to hard to be like a Corona but does still retain that Bud taste and feel. I'm not much of a fan of A-B's beers but I think this may be one of the better beers Bud has put out. Would be good at least as a summer cookout beer"
"This was worth the morbid interest try, but I won't be spending any money on it. I wouldn't turn it down if it's the only option at a summer BBQ, but it'll get edged out pretty easily from the cheap domestics, too."
"At first I couldn't decide whether this tasted more like a lemon-lime Sweet Tart or Smartie, but there really isn't enough tang for this to be a Sweet Tart. There was a hint of very plain, light barley malt in the background, but this beer was mostly a lime candy-flavored beverage. Barely beer, but technically it is. I will also give it credit for being completely inoffensive to the palate. If you're offended by fruity booze trying to pass as beer, however, that's another story. One was enough for me."
"O) Candy sweet, little taste. Come on people, just squeeze a lime in a Corona."
"on the whole, i really dont want to finish this beer, nor drink any more of them. Wouldnt spend money on it, but i wonder how Miller Chill stacks up? ha!"
"A conversation from earlier tonight reminded me to review this beer. And like I said, I would prefer a corona with a real lime served in a salt lined glass. It pours a yellow color with a weak head. Nose and taste are of grains, rice and artificial ingredients. Thin body feels like Sprite."
"Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: The beer has a thin body. It is well carbonated. This is oddly like drinking lemon/lime soda. No where near the chore I thought it would be to drink."
"Main Negative Point - It's still Bud Light."
"Wouldn't ever buy, glad the only one I ever had was given to me."
"Drinkability: Easy to drink, but who would want to. This is an attempt to floor the market of lime beers to the max. One thing I can say is it's better then Miller Chill, but not better then a Corona. My final verdict, stick to Corona if you want this style, otherwise, AVOID!"
"I usually don't directly dis beer, but this one was pretty bad. I've had one at a club and it wasn't horrible then. I guess you just have to be in the mood."
"Drinkability: Yea its got this. Why wouldn't it? Light, crisp, refreshing for a hot day, and a flavor that appeals to people who don't like beer. I like beer...so this one is one I'd pass on. But it does do the job it was made to do"
"D- All the components together made me not want to finish this beer. I think I did though."
"Pale colored beer with a rapidly fading head.Aroma reminds me of a kamikaze drink.Taste is Bud Light with a nice splash of citrusy lime.This is leaps and bounds better than Miller Chill.I like this beer and will buy it on a regular basis. Good job by AB!!"
"I drank this! It's true! It tastes like someone poured together half a glass of piss beer and half a glass of lime juice into a bottle, stirred, and served. Which, let's be honest, is pretty close to what they probably did (only it was lime FLAVORING, not lime juice). Honestly, it's not terrible, but it's not really beer, to me. Basically it's a fruit beer, with that fruit being a lime ""thing."" High carbonation, strong lime flavoring, and that's it. Not worth your time if you're interested in drinking beer, but if you like weird lime things, this is for you dude."
"I always understood that their was a man-law against ""fruiting the beer"". As a coffee enthusiast, I know that many coffee companies will flavor their inferior coffee crops to cover up the substandard product. I can only imagine that the same concept would apply in the world of coffee. Nothing special about this beer, just an attempt at an ""exotic"" taste. Not to bash a beer, but a macro-brew trying to be exotic seems like a bit of a contradiction to me."
"Well, to start off with Bud Light Lime, I have to admit that it's one of the lightest tasting beers I've had. I'm a pretty big fan of dropping a lime in a beer when I can so naturally I had to try this one. Yeah, the lime flavoring is noticeable but definetly not overpowering. I agree with the poster who said ""if you dont like beer, this is the drink that will get you drunk"". Or something like that. I'll also admit that this definetly wouldn't be a beer afficianado's idea of a great brew, but on a beach day, or a game day, or just anytime you want to have a cold one or two with no real goal in mind, I have no problem reaching for this one. It's very drinkable, which is its strongest point I believe. While it may not be the favorite beer of most people, I bet I'd be hard-pressed to find many who downright hate it. I think AB hit the spot pretty well with this one."
"D - If you don't like beer, this is what you drink to get drunk. I personally can't stand the lime flavoring, and the small amount of alcohol means it'll take most a looot of Lime Flavor #12 to get through the night."
"Pours a clear, pale straw yellow with a thin white head. Aroma was all lime, not a hint of anything ""beer."" Taste was very ""Corona"" like, definetly lime without a hint of cereal grains or malt. A citric acid aftertaste, like a phosphate soda. Mouthfeel was very watery and carbonated. For a hot day I would still prefer a regular light macro, but this wasn't to bad. Out of the trendy ""lime"" beers I have tried this is the better of them."
"2/2/3/2.5/3.5"
"Given the choice I'd rather get a Corona or Dos Equis, at least you can add a real lime. I'm not a fan of macros overall. This is an average attempt at this genre."
"this would work on a hot day if served very cold and maybe straight from the bottle"
"This beer is a great thirst quencher on a hot Summer's day. I would pick this over a Corona/Landshark/Miller Chill (insert gimmicky flavored beer here) any day of the week. Not an overpowering lime taste but still much better than a Bud Light. Good work AB."
"Not a great product at all. Then again, its coming out of Anheuser Busch, and not too much out of there is that great. Essentially, it tastes like a watered down Corona with lime juice squeezed in it. Not recommended at all. I'd almost rather grab a Busch Light then drink this again."
"I haven't had the Miller Chill in awhile but from what I recall, this is better, but only by a small margin. It's very easy to drink, but doesn't really taste much like a beer."
"Drinks surprisingly well enough for one - could almost see a somewhat refreshing quality to it on a hot day for non-beer drinkers. If I liked lime soda more, I may have liked this one more. It's okay for what it is, I suppose, but one is enough."
"overall, this isnt as bad as i thought it would be, i had miller chill about a year ago and i believe this to be better, however that does not mean that i will be purchasing either again"
"12 oz. bottle. Pours yellow, with a white tiny fizzy head which diminished immediately. Had a light doughy smell, with the obvious lime-flavored aroma. Taste was actually not bad, like a good corona with a lime. Had a somewhat salty finish. It was pretty fizzy on the palate, too much carbonation. Not great, but drinkable."
"Same co-workers house as my Mich Ultra review... I was pressured into trying BL with Lime. I had read (possibly in BA Mag) how many millions of barrels of Miller Chill had been sold which led to AB wanting a piece of the action. Who is drinking this stuff? I don't mind the occasional fruity beer but I am rarely if ever chopping up fresh fruit to garnish my beer with. Never mind fresh fruit, what about an imitation lime flavoring? It tastes like limeade with a twist of beer. Way too sweet to be anything close to enjoyable. I think the taste that I took didn't even clear the neck of the bottle and I returned it to my friend to finish it up. I can't believe that people willingly choose this stuff to drink."
"I'm holding out for Bud Light Weed."
"I'll post the same review for Miller Chill, which I thought was equally bad."
"This might be ok at a summer picnic, but it has to be ice cold. Better than Corona with lime IMHO. Not recommended even for non-beer drinkers."
"If I'm in the mood for easy drinking lime taste in the future there's a strong chance I'll be going for some kind of tequila drink instead of one of these concoctions."
"Typical Bud pale gold color. Atypical aroma however, like a drive-in limeade. Little head, that quickly fades and no lacing at all. Surprisingly natural lime flavors, not like the candy/artificial I was expecting. Medium/light body, higher carbonation. This is akin to a girly drink. Think Smirnoff Ice. It will probably be a hit with underfed, tanorexic girls in LA/Miami."
"This is Bud Light with artificial lime flavor. The color was like you'd expect. Smelled like artificial limes. Taste was Bud Light with artificial lime flavor. Thin mouthfeel. The only thing going for it is the quaffability. Goes down like water. Tried one to say I tried it and that's it."
"D. It is what it is. I am making a sacrifice in the name of advocating. I do not advocate this unless you cannot make your mind up between having a beer or a Sprite."
"Tried the Bud Light Lime for the very first time. The color of the beer is the same as most standard Budweiser products, but you can taste a little hint of lime in the beer. The lime taste is very subitle, but is also felt. This beer is very drinkable."
"I wouldn't turn it down if it were free...."
"Overall - very disappointing... oh wait, it's another macro lager so I shouldn't be. Very bland and watery. Not worth the money. I'd probably chug it if it was free. I'd rather have a Labatt Blue Light."
"D: A fairly drinkable beer, but mostly due to the mouthfeel. An easy beer that does not take much to drink. The slight saltiness with a refreshing mint/lime taste made this beer very easy to drink. Decent overall, but nothing major and I can't say I would make this one a beer of choice in the future."
"I guess I can agree that it's light enough to go down easy on a warm summer day."
"Not drinkable. This is basically alcoholic seltzer water with lime."
"Hmm, must have liked another beer companies idea? Another lime 'kinda-beer'. I give this about the same rating as Miller Chill, but each have a little individuality. BL-L has less carbonation and is a little more drinkable. Personally I don't think it has as much flavor as MC. Give it a try however, not a terrible summer treat on rare occasion."
"Give it a shot."
"The taste is candy, too. Very sweet. Refreshing in the way that pop is, actually, it might be better than pop, but it seems fake. Again, it's the processed candy flavor that I am fighting with. Lacks the acidic twang of real fruit."
"By leaps and bounds I prefered the Miller Chill. There was a better balance of added flavors, the base beer itself is better, and best of it's not flat like Bud Light Lime."
"Drinkability is pretty good and refreshing."
"My sister likes this stuff, and I have read lots of varying opinions on it, so I stole a single from the six pack I bought her. Pours a clear straw color, and a tight white head that eventually becomes a ring of lace around the glass. Aroma is similar to how a Corona smells after putting a lime in. The lime smell does have a certain generic quality about it. Besides that not a whole lot going on in the smell department. Taste is dominated by the lime, but also has some salt and cereal grains. Feel is light, and could use some more carbonation. Drinkability isn't half bad; I would take this over a regular Bud Light most likely. Anheiser Busch has created an average beer that has some clever marketing behind it. Lime flavored nachos with salsa on the side sounds like a good pairing. Cheers"
"Poured out a clear yellow brew with a big 2 finger head. Head dissipates quickly and is pure white.Smells of beer with lime.Similar to corona but no skunkiness.For what it is i kinda like it.Tatses like a pale beer with lime of course and has subtle hints of sweet and saltiness to it.Not bad. No mouthfeel,but seriously did you expect one?A beer i would choose over other macros."
"M/D: Feels like a bud light, crisp, light, and watery. It drinks like a poorly made margarita. I highly recommend not wasting your time on it unless you love the taste of lime."
"D- This isn't great, and probably not even good but sadly, I'd probably grab it before any other mexican-esque beer."
"EDIT: I am happy to say that after 1/2 hour I did get the standard BL headache that I always get after one BL. So in case anyone was wondering if there really is a beer in there somewhere, there is, and it's a Bud Light. (I lowered my drinkability score based on this latest finding.)"
"I can't drink this stuff, it just seems stupid to me. It does not taste like beer at all but just some lime drink with bitters. Something you would drink when NOT in the mood for beer."
"Pale yellow color-quite the large head at first though it is gone rather quickly. Moderate aroma-quite the lime presence. Clean flavor though relies heavily on the lime taste. Almost too much. I have to balance this against Miller Chill which I just had. Thats a lot more subtle. Decent body-actually quite full for the style. Rather drab overall. Too much lime for me. Not lime Kool Aid like but still overdone. Like the other flavored beers out there I would say this is ok for what it is trying to be."
"Bud Light Lime is a shameless attempt to cash in on the recent (and regrettable) trend of lime-flavored beer. Sticking a slice of lime in the neck of a Corona was a pain in the ass anyway (the one time I actually did it). For my money, any added ingredient that can effectively cover up the so-called flavor of Bud Light is an improvement. Okay, so Bud Light Liver And Onions might not be so good."
"I tried one of these after helping my buddy put his dock in. The beer pours out a clear straw yellow with a white fizzy head. The head didn't stick around for long though, no lacing at all. Smell was pretty basic, kind of grainy but the lime definitely makes an appearance. Taste was about the same, nothing special. Leaves a nasty aftertaste. Overall though, the beer was pretty smooth and a little fizzy. It felt good on this hot summer day, but the taste and smell just didn't help it out. I probably wouldn't drink another one of these unless it's all that's available."
"Great concept but this is going in the wrong direction for beer and you can't even compare this to a good ""lager and lime", at least with those you could actually taste beer. One bottle was more than enough, nothing horrible ... just not beer."
"I would have another of these if it was free or somewhere south of a buck."
"Overall a pretty refreshing beer. Nothing too offensive here. Could hit the spot on a hot day."
"Thought this was a joke when I saw it was coming out and just another way the beer giant can make their followers feel like they are drinking something special, still not fond of the idea and if you need that much lime to make a beer have flavor then something is wrong, would not drink again, only tried to reinforce my original position with this one, probably not worth your time"
"Drinkability: Alright for a party or something and somewhat refreshing."
"Bud Light Lime: My first thought of this beer when I found out about it, from a friend, was it probably is going to be another run-of-the-mill flavored schlock. Much to my amazement I was proven wrong. From the first pour, this beer had a surprisingly clear golden color with a moderate carbonation and a head that unfortunately dissipated too fast. Almost instantly you could smell the lime with a light, malty aroma. The first sip was quite refreshing, the citrus zing and salty carbonated tones were amazingly pleasant. After tasting this I was actually looking forward to finishing the glass. The beer may have a thin and sharp carbonated mouthful but I think on a hot summer day for a macro brew its perfect for just sitting out in your backyard, with friends and family eating freshly grilled fixin's for fajitas or just relaxing."
"Drinkability- About as expected. I would take a Corona with a real lime over it any day of the week though. Drinkable, but not if there are other options."
"drinkability is fair, it's refreshing, and pretty quenching, but it's not beer. one thing i will give it though... it tastes better than regular bud light."
" For me they were better than ice tea, water or lemonade and I wasn't trying to smell, savor the mouthfeel or worry about the appearance, I simply wanted a cold beer to quench my thirst and it served the purpose."
"12oz clear bottle poured into a pint glass. Pours a clear golden yellow color with a thin fizzy white head. The aroma is mostly a cola-like lime flavoring almost reminiscent of a 7-Up and some salt, not much beer in the aroma. The taste is the typical grainy Bud Light flavors with just a hint of lime. The mouthfeel is light and fizzy with a lot of carbonation. This would be refreshing on a hot summer day, but I could not see myself wanting to drink more than one of these. Overall, this is not a horrible beer to consume on a hot day, but it is not something I am really eager to have again. I will pass on it next time unless it is the only beer option."
"Notes: Fans of malt beverages like Zima or Smirnoff Ice may like this beer as well as some non beer drinkers. I actually liked it on that level but as a beer it was way off balance."
"D: Didn't hate it completely, finished the 12 oz. bottle, not worth my money again, if you want a lime-flavoured lager go with Miller Chill."
"AB should pay people to drink this crappola."
"And for Corona and Lime wedge fans, this will save on labor and produce bills."
"Drinkability - a lawnmower offering with Vitamin C. Drinkable for what it is."
"Pours a four finger white head that vanishes without a trace of lace. Crystal clear pale amber color. Light carbonation and light bodied. Strong lime nose. Flavor is a slightly fizzy lime drink, no detectable malt or hops. Doesn't even qualify for a session beer. Forced to have a real beer - Sam Adams Old Fezziwig. $1.35 for a 12oz bottle from Colonial Spirits Acton, Ma."
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability: Fizzy yellow beer is for wussies, and with lime its for pussies. Goes down easy, like bud light, but I guess you could say its more smooth, green sorbet compared to vanilla ice cream...they both are easy to eat.(however in this case the items being eaten or put in the mouth actually taste good, its wort while, Bud light lime is not.) It has more flavor than bud light, but thats the lime in there. Won't buy it again, it doesn't suck but its not anything close to being good."
"More a malterative to beer than an actual beer. Less filling and lighter tasting then those malt beverages. It is refreshing on a hot day but it is not something I will be seeking out."
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. Pours a pale gold color with a small fizzy head that disappears quickly. Smells like bud lt with some lime with sprite. The beer tastes the same as the smell. The mouthfeel is highly carbonated like a soda. On a very hot day this beer will go down very nicely but that's about it."
"Bud Light Lime pours a very pale yellow with a large white head from a clear twelve ounce bottle. The aroma is lime juice, and actually isn't bad, it accurately hits the lime on the nose. The body is very light and it tastes more like sprite than anything else. I detect no beer like qualities. That said, it is quite refreshing and is better than most of these types of beers, and I use the term loosely, as apparently do the brewers. More malternative than beer, but one of the better ones as far as that goes."
"Clear pale golden hue with a fizzy white head dwindles quickly of course. Absolutely no lacing sticks to my pint glass. Aroma mild citrus peel with a touch of saltiness. Flavor is bud light covered with lime flavor not much more to it than that definitely boring and unoriginal with following the coattails of Miller Chill. Mouthfeel of seltzer water, and is refreshing but feels like lemonade or a chick alco pop than an actual beer."
"Friends of mine brought some of this to last weekends Memorial Day party and some was left over. With this being said I was interested so gave it a try. I will to be as fair as possible knowing that this is a Macro product. This brew pours to a bright yellow color with a very fizzy white head that breaks down in just a few minutes, no lacing what so ever. The way the head reacts it seems almost like a soda. The aroma is mostly lime which while seeming fresh also has a soda pop like aroma, limited malt/grain/corn smell coming through and no hop. The flavor is lime, I can't get past that flavor to really pick anything else up but IMO the flavor is pretty good. Now with that being said to me this is not a beer, does not poses many of the characteristics of beer as it seems like a fizzy lime drink. With this being said it is hard to grade because the flavor is not bad. Some people might not agree with some of these grades in the review but it is what it is. I gave the smell and taste 3.0 just because they are not bad though not beer like."
"This is a tough beer to judge, one evaluated at least as much by what it doesn't have as by what's present. Not bad to beat the heat on the beach, but with few positives and no real complication."
"D - I went into this with an open mind and I was disappointed. I will say there are some AB products or affiliates that could make the grade but this was a flat out miss. Simply a gimmick beer to challenge another unworthy beer (Miller chill). Should appeal to the general public. Stay away from this brew."
"It is easy to get, affordable, and different. I would recommend this one for any outdoor function. Or if you just wanna beat the heat."
"12 ounce bottle. Served in a Sam Adams BL glass, the beer pours a clear straw gold color with a half inch white head. Head retention and lacing are both low. The aroma is limes, kind of a mix between fresh limes and an alcopop lime drink. It doesn't smell bad, but I can't smell anything other than lime. Taste is limes, but it's closer to fresh limes than an artificial taste. There's no ""beer"" taste to it, but truthfully it doesn't taste bad. Mouthfeel/body is light. Not watery, but still pretty light with a little above average carbonation. Drinkability is actually good, I don't have any problems drinking this at all. It's definitely a step up above Miller Chill. I hate to say it, but I kinda like this. On a hot day it would be pretty good..."
"It is what it is, a low calorie, low ABV, low complexity guzzler with an attempt to become more interesting for summer with a novelty lime flavor. Corona's been doing it forever, why fault Bud for forcing the idea onto people by putting the lime in it for you? I still can't recommend it at all, though."
"D - If you love limes or gin and tonics (with considerably less alcohol content), then this beer/bud is for you!"
"D: Drinkability was limey, perhaps a touch to much so as it became one-dimensional really quick. Good if you like a strong lime flavor but cant see many drinking this one after the other, more of a novelty beer."
"It's not my kind of drink, but if you're looking for a mildly alcoholic soda pop to cool you off, this might do it."
"As much as I hate to admit it, I found this beer to be quite drinkable. How could watered down Bud with some lime essence not be?"
"This beer is marketed as a premium beer but there is nothing special about it. All it tastes like is an alcoholic lime drink. It seems like it would be a great thirst quencher on a hot day if you liked fruity drinks. This drink should be higher in abv and put in the same section as the smirnoff ice drinks and mikes hard lemonade. Its not a real beer."
"I can be a beer snob with the best of them, but Bud Light Lime is what it is: a cheap, easily obtainable, refreshing beer that's perfect for a hot summer afternoon. I usually like dark ales, porters, stouts, but Bud Light Lime is a nice change and a much better beer for mowing the yard or sitting on the beach. When it's 90 in the shade I'll take this over any other light beer I've ever tried. Will it pass the beer snob test? Of course not. But it will hit the spot for a lot less money on a hotter than hell sunny afternoon."
"12oz clear bottle. Pours a light straw yellow with an inch of white head that dissipates quickly. Smells like lime with a good dose of salt and slight biscuit malt toward the finish. Tastes very citrusy initially (lime) with salt immediately afterward, giving way to a fairly clean finish with just hints of lime on the aftertaste. Very light in body. Like Miller Chill, this borders on alco-pop, but the flavors are a little less intense (particularly the salt) and thus this beer is much more drinkable than its SABMiller counterpart. Not as offensive as I was expecting, but I won't be getting it again, as there are better American Macro Lagers to be had..."
"As expected, there's not much here to critique. It is non-offensive in the same way that selzer water is, but with some faint beer character. The pour brings a very light straw color with a spritzy carbonation and fizzy head formation with lack of retaining qualities. Aromas are majorily lime and with a hint of a gain / malt mixture. Flavors are also dominated by the lime which brings a refreshing and palate cleansing quality to the beer. The feel is overly carbonated and thin, weak, and fleeting. Leaves only a lingering lime flavor and an acidic bite. It will not be what I reach for when wanting a beer, but I can see its appeal through the hot summer months."
"Overall, this was a very interesting, quaffable beer. However, it really, honestly tastes more like Sprite soda pop than beer.... I'm not trying to bash it, I just thought you should know that before picking this one up."
"D: For what this is it is very good. This was my first time ever having anything close to a bud light. Would go well in 98 degree heat."
"My roommate gave me one to try because I sure wouldn't have bought this myself. Pours a golden yellow color with a short and thin white head that leaves a little lacing as it goes down the glass. The smell is of mostly lime and then some sweet malts. The taste was not as bad as I expected. It had a slightly sweet malty base followed by the right amount of lime flavoring. What was nice about it was the lime flavoring didn't taste as artificial as all the other products infused with lime. It actually tasted kind of real. The mouthfeel was crisp and watery which made for a very drinkable beer. Budweiser's attempt at the light beer with lime Corona/Miller Chill/Landshark market should pay off as this is the best of them."
"Looks like a Bud/Light, clear yellow with zero head retention or lacing. The smell of lime overpours the smell of an adjunct lager, but there is a slight chemical aspect to it. Taste is of cereal grains and lime, so pretty much Bud Light with lime juice, but again there is a chemically off note that comes through in the finish. Much more of a natural lime taste than the fruit loop-y Miller Chill, but still a little nasty."
"I didn't think they could make Bud Light any worse... I shouldn't assume things."
"Decided to give this one a try, despite knowing I will probably be disappointed. This one is a bit different than the Miller Chill. None of the salt, more lime. The lime actually doesn't seem as fake as I expected.. this basically just tastes like an extremely light beer with quite a bit of lime flavor. I guess its drinkable, but after a few it gets a bit sickly."
"First off is Lots of Lime in the nose! ... big foamy head in to the glass that seems to break its neck to dissipate, but leaves a tiny ring ... is very refreshing and tangy but when it warms it can be a beast, Serve COLD!! .. better than most BMC products and probably somewhat better than Miller Chill..."
"D - While working up a mean thirst playing around on the beach on a scorching day this would be perfect. I still like Miller Chill a little bit better though."
"Drinkability: OK, it's official, this tastes like Sprite, and can you really get angry with a bottle of Sprite?"
"Suprised. I really had the lowest expectations for this! Its not really bad, the lime is strong, but tastes fairly natural. Its a notch above Miller chill!"
"D- Guzzle this quick while its COLD, otherwise the adjuncts start shining through hinting at its true nature. If I were already drunk and in Cancun, I'd drink this shiznit all day long."
"Pours a very light yellow with a small 1/16 inch head, with average lacing. Below average carbonation with a strong sweet smell of lemons. Tastes like carbonated lemons with almost no alcohol taste. This is awful and tastes like Lemon Pledge. It would make a better cleaning product than a malt beverage."
"This is not an offensive beer - in fact, it is a slight improvement on Bud Light just because the lime gives your mouth something to do. I suspect this will be a smash hit on the market, and it wouldn't be the worst thing in the world at a party on a hot summer day. But this adds nothing to the art of brewing."
"Overall, they wanted to make a lime bl, and that is exactly what it is. I can see it being refreshing and more of a thirst quencher than a beer. I bought this as a single....wont ever buy a six pack of it, but I wouldnt say I would never drink it again."
"It has the same pale gold yellow appearance that Bud Light has and the same crappy soap-bubble head that fizzes out quickly. It smells slightly better but only because fruity lime odor is hiding the inferior ingredients used in brewing Bud Light. Taste is slightly better for the same reason. It tastes like light beer mixed with Seven Up or Sprite or Faygo Lemon Lime. It tastes more like pop than beer to me, actually. It thin and watery and easy to drink. It's the consummate chick drink."
"I am proud to say the only reason I tried this beer is because I got it free as a promotional item. I had no high expectations. Had it iced cold in a pint glass. Poured a crystal clear goldedn color with a fast forming and quickly disapating head. Smelled of fresh sqeezed lime and a little rock salt like I was about to take a tequila shot. Taste was of Bud light, watery, just a hint of lime and stinging on the tongue. This will probably be enjoyed at a frat party and your biggest concern is hooking up (feed her some of these, it should do the trick)"
"I could see myself drinking a couple and then the heart burn might set in (IMO). Not my cup of tea, but I see this doing well for AB."
"Easy to drink, but hardly beer at all."
"Nice job A-B."
"D- these boys shoulda learned their lesson from miller chill. this might even be worse."
"D - Yeah, it's arguably not even a macro lager, but for what it is, it's pretty drinkable. I can't really bash this the way I had expected to, it just really isn't that bad at all. Make no mistake the bashings will happen, but I'm willing to bet a few of you will actually like this stuff for a hot day on the beach."
"Poured to a good head that had big bubbles. The beer was very light yellow. No lacing was evident. The head tasted like lime. The only thing you could smell was lime. Nothing else. Just lots of lime. All you could taste was lime. It also had a strong aftertaste of more lime. It remeinded me of a 7 Up flavor except it was more lime tasting. Sorry to overkill the lime, but Bud blew it here. Its not beer its lime juice. Carbonation was a bit much. Also felt watery in the mouth with no body. I wont buy this ever. I got a free one from a friend and gave it a shot. This will go to my do not buy list."
"D: Eh. Still not sure. Was not offensive. Just not my style of beer, however, I did rate this upon STYLE, not personal preferance. I'm sure this will be a hit, and pretty much bury Miller Chill."
