Nose of fake lime, barely a bit of beer taste under that big fake lime taste that seemingly never leaves the tongue. I've moved on to the various Leinekugel shandys now for mowing but yep, many a strip of grass were doused with the last ounce or so of a Bud Light lime once the cold fell off!

5,131.5,,,,,,"Had this at my buddy's birthday party. Not a lot of flavor worth mentioning. The lime tastes like real lime, but is a light dash of it. I give this a 5 out of 5 for one reason. It tastes incredibly smooth and goes down really good. Carbonation is perfect for this beer. You could argue its not beer considering there is no beer flavor really, besides a light malt taste. This stuff is incredibly easy to drink. It actually stays easy to drink even warm. Because of that i also rated this beer highly. It is seriously the easiest thing to drink i have ever had. The fact its so easy to drink i drank almost a 24 pack of bottles by myself across the day. The lime is just the perfect amount. I am not a beer snob at all. But i do enjoy the hoppier stuff too. I gotta say, they don't market this as much as regular BL and i don't think they have too. this is good without marketing. Its just the perfect balance of the lime flavor and the light body of the beer taste that makes me like this. next time i go fishing i'm taking a pack of this. perfect for hot days.","Alestorm4069","Dec 08, 2014"

Its very balanced in the carbonation. I like this more than my coors light. Coors light is in the same boat as this though. What made me rate this this way is the hint of lime. Its not overpowering and today i had two or 3 of these and they were good. As i said the only thing i can taste is the lime. Also its one of the few things i let get hot and it didn't turn nasty.  This and Redds apple ale trump all the other macros for me.","InstantBeer","Sep 07, 2014"

The smell has a very faint lime smell to it and is the only think you can smell from the beer. The taste is just lime and nothing more. The mouth feel is light and is like drinking a bud light. Overall the beer isn't good. I wanted to try it as a beach beer and is low in abv and comes in cans. It gave me slight hard burn and is like drinking a watered down corona.","T6PP","Jul 26, 2014"

This beer would appeal to people who are trying beer for the first time and have nothing to compare it to. It would also appeal to people who do not really like beer.

Above all, I'm curious why this beer still exists. Does this appeal to people looking for that "OMG drinking Corona with lime is like I'm really on the beach" demographic? I wish that demographic didn't exist. On a related note, I would rather drink this than Corona (lime or not). Or does this appeal to the "I'm underage and I don't like beer but this doesn't taste like beer LOL" crowd? Whatever. One thing is certain: I now really need to review the masterpiece known as Bud Light Lime-A-Rita.","angrybabboon","Nov 03, 2013"

Very little lacing was seen. LOTS of bubbles were seen rising up from the bottom of the glass, due to excessive carbonation. The aroma is of some grain and lime. The taste is of mostly lime, which covers up the grain flavor actually. A bit much and more so that the 'Miller Chill" that I had earlier.

The addition of Lime and salt flavoring really takes this stuff from an bad watered down redneck lager to something that is drinkable and enjoyable. Although I don't prefer it to let's say, Labatt Blue, It still is not a bad choice.

Either way, it's there. If you don't really like Bud Light, this will be a plus for you because the Bud Light taste is drowned out. Light bodied, overly carbonated. As you progress through this brew, the flavor seems to weaken and "thin out". By the time you reach the end, it's mostly flavor-less.

2.72,25.9,2.5,3,2.5,2.5,3,"Decided to give this one a try, despite knowing I will probably be disappointed. This one is a bit different than the Miller Chill. None of the salt, more lime. The lime actually doesn't seem as fake as I expected.. this basically just tastes like an extremely light beer with quite a bit of lime flavor. I guess its drinkable, but after a few it gets a bit sickly.","rowew","May 05, 2008"
2.1,-2.8,2,2,2,3,2,"First off is Lots of Lime in the nose! ... big foamy head in to the glass that seems to break its neck to dissipate, but leaves a tiny ring ... is very refreshing and tangy but when it warms it can be a beast, Serve COLD!! .. better than most BMC products and probably somewhat better than Miller Chill...","Onslow","May 05, 2008"
2.74,26.9,1.5,2.5,2.5,1.5,4.5,"D - While working up a mean thirst playing around on the beach on a scorching day this would be perfect. I still like Miller Chill a little bit better though.","pmcadamis","May 05, 2008"

2.82,30.6,2,2.5,3,3,3,"Suprised. I really had the lowest expectations for this! Its not really bad, the lime is strong, but tastes fairly natural. Its a notch above Miller chill!","Taipans","May 03, 2008"
3.11,44,2,3.5,3,2.5,3.5,"D- Guzzle this quick while its COLD, otherwise the adjuncts start shining through hinting at its true nature. If I were already drunk and in Cancun, I'd drink this shiznit all day long.","Avryle","May 03, 2008"
1.65,-23.6,2,2,1.5,1.5,1.5,"Pours a very light yellow with a small 1/16 inch head, with average lacing. Below average carbonation with a strong sweet smell of lemons. Tastes like carbonated lemons with almost no alcohol taste. This is awful and tastes like Lemon Pledge. It would make a better cleaning product than a malt beverage.","ATLbeerDog","May 03, 2008"
2.7,25,3,3,2.5,2,3,"This is not an offensive beer - in fact, it is a slight improvement on Bud Light just because the lime gives your mouth something to do. I suspect this will be a smash hit on the market, and it wouldn't be the worst thing in the world at a party on a hot summer day. But this adds nothing to the art of brewing.","Seanibus","May 03, 2008"
2.57,19,2,2.5,2.5,2.5,3,"Overall, they wanted to make a lime bl, and that is exactly what it is. I can see it being refreshing and more of a thirst quencher than a beer. I bought this as a single....wont ever buy a six pack of it, but I wouldnt say I would never drink it again.","acrawf6","May 01, 2008"
2.24,3.7,1.5,2.5,2,1.5,3,"It has the same pale gold yellow appearance that Bud Light has and the same crappy soap-bubble head that fizzes out quickly. It smells slightly better but only because fruity lime odor is hiding the inferior ingredients used in brewing Bud Light. Taste is slightly better for the same reason. It tastes like light beer mixed with Seven Up or Sprite or Faygo Lemon Lime. It tastes more like pop than beer to me, actually. It thin and watery and easy to drink. It's the consummate chick drink.","berserker256","Apr 28, 2008"
1.87,-13.4,2,2.5,1.5,1.5,2,"I am proud to say the only reason I tried this beer is because I got it free as a promotional item. I had no high expectations. Had it iced cold in a pint glass. Poured a crystal clear goldedn color with a fast forming and quickly disapating head. Smelled of fresh sqeezed lime and a little rock salt like I was about to take a tequila shot. Taste was of Bud light, watery, just a hint of lime and stinging on the tongue. This will probably be enjoyed at a frat party and your biggest concern is hooking up (feed her some of these, it should do the trick)","Portertime","Apr 28, 2008"

2.88,33.3,3,2.5,3,3,3,"D - Yeah, it's arguably not even a macro lager, but for what it is, it's pretty drinkable. I can't really bash this the way I had expected to, it just really isn't that bad at all. Make no mistake the bashings will happen, but I'm willing to bet a few of you will actually like this stuff for a hot day on the beach.","PhageLab","Apr 22, 2008"
1.53,-29.2,2,1.5,1.5,1.5,1.5,"Poured to a good head that had big bubbles. The beer was very light yellow. No lacing was evident. The head tasted like lime. The only thing you could smell was lime. Nothing else. Just lots of lime. All you could taste was lime. It also had a strong aftertaste of more lime. It remeinded me of a 7 Up flavor except it was more lime tasting. Sorry to overkill the lime, but Bud blew it here. Its not beer its lime juice. Carbonation was a bit much. Also felt watery in the mouth with no body. I wont buy this ever. I got a free one from a friend and gave it a shot. This will go to my do not buy list.","youngleo","Apr 19, 2008"
2.23,3.2,3,2.5,2,2.5,2,"D: Eh. Still not sure. Was not offensive. Just not my style of beer, however, I did rate this upon STYLE, not personal preferance. I'm sure this will be a hit, and pretty much bury Miller Chill.","KI9A","Apr 15, 2008"
