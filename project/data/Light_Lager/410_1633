3.06,24.4,4,3,3,3,3,"I.C. Light brewed by Pittsburgh Brewing Co. This brew has an ABV of  4.15%  The brew pours out a nice amber color with a small white head. I.C. Light is a filtered brew you can see right though it. This brew looks like most American light brews. The smell has some grains and malts. You do pick up on some corn in this brew. There is nothing bad about this brew so far now for the taste.  The taste at first is bitter but it goes down smooth. But there is something in there at first.  This brew ok, it is not bad but it is not good.  I would put this light brew right in the middle. The mouthfeel is ok with a clean finish. But the first taste is bitter sweet. Overall I'm giving this brew a 3 out 5. Not the best, but not the worst I've had.","nicholas2121","Aug 23, 2014"

OCCASION: perfect night for a ballgame and some beers with brother Jer in State College...APPEARANCE: thick, white creamy head; yellow body with some cascading bubbles...meh... AROMA: vague hints of water hose, hay and malt liquor ping....with a hint of beer pong ball... PALATE: light bodied, with a retreating aftertaste--has peanut-rinsing potential... TASTE: middling malts mingle with water to produce...mostly water, with a warming fuzz not appropriate to its ABV...not much else can be deduced... OVERALL: I went cheaper at the Spikes game and got four more ounces for a dollar less than the Robin Hood IPA...and not surprisingly, I regretted the change.. this beer needs to be chased with an activity that involves strong-tasting fare; otherwise, I wouldn't drink this unless visiting Pittsburgh where the locals embrace its quirks and flaws....","dacrza1","0"

Well, thin and any light, but the difference is, this one is pretty clean. Corn husk is light enough, minor alcohol in the middle, and slightly bitter hops. Hmmm. Yes, this is better than before, as it no longer has the slight skunk of old. I'd say this is much better than almost all the macro lights I've had.

It was out WAY before low carb diets were the rage. It has a "full flavor" taste but yet is low in calories and carbs and contains just about the normal ABV as a regular beer. It is very smooth going down finishes clean and tastes great with wings, on a hot summer day or when I am parked in front of the TV watching my fave team play some football(and I'm sure you can guess who it is if you looked to see where the beer is made) AND THANK YOU for keeping it local!!!

I had to get up to go buy this one. Oddly enough-a bottle of DFH 60 min. IPA is $5.75 and a bottle of BMC or Iron City is $6...so if you are ever at a Pirates game hit up the Beers of the Burgh stand.","PittBeerGirl","Jan 14, 2007"

The taste is mostly malty and grainy, with a small metallic taste too. It starts off a bit sweet and finishes a bit sour. The mouthfeel is light and watery. With that being said the drinkability is decent as the beer is non-offensive and it does go down smooth.

What I really liked was that IC light didnt seem to have that typical overcarbonated, burning-mouth sensation that a lot of other Lights have. It also has that interesting grass/hay/etc taste that all light beers have, like you are chewing on a mouthful of something that has been freshly cut from the ground. Goes down smooth and easy.

Highly carbonated with a taste that starts out fairly plain, like a stereotypical light beer, then finishes with a somewhat citrus-like aftertaste. The unique finish gives it more character than some light beers I've tried, but nothing special. It's fine for beer pong or if you're just looking for a cold one, but if you really want something satisfying I wouldn't recommend it.","wolverinerocker","Nov 05, 2005"

This was watery but what do you expect, and the adjuncts were not too strong. Still, I just didn't really care for it too much. Decent for what it is.","granger10","Beers"
2.91,18.3,3.5,2.5,3,2,3.5,"Very light yellow and a small white head, that fell to a stubborn ring. Lots of active carbonation even after a few minutes. Not bad looking at all for a light lager. Smell was nondescript, consisting a watery corn, harsh odors that must be hops and a saccharine hit. Taste is rather malty for the style (or has a sweetener been added?) Watery mouthfeel, an abrupt finish, though it does dry out a bit. Really, nothing terrible, but not particularly memorable either. If someone has it at a football party, pop a can. It won't hurt you.","pentathlete","0"

It has no hop character. It's almost like drinking seltzer water with a slight malt flavor. The mouthfeel is average. It is a low bodied beer with good carbonation.

Definitely more character than most light beers, so thats a plus. But nothing at all great. Doubt Ill buy one of these again unless its the only alternative to one of the BMC usual suspects.
