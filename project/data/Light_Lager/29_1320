Why I drank some of these over the years before I discovered some good brews and brew-styles is beyond me. Overall. why bother to drink this, no matter what fancy/cool bottle they use.

5,170.3,,,,,,"Boring and bland for sure. Not a lot of flavor.  Busch light is better.  Busch light is my lawn mower lager in the summer time. Bud light doesnt tank simply because it is one of the easiest beers to drink period. Supreme drinkabilty takes this beer where it needs to be. Comparing this to other BMC beers, this is better than coors, mainly because of the metallic taste present in coors light. Miller lite is a little stronger flavor. For what this beer sets out to be, which is a bland boring beer with very little taste, it reigns supreme. This is for people who just want a hint of beer taste. This isnt really something i would compare to Sierra Nevada or Sam Adams.  Its just a light beer. This is one of the best party beers in my opinion. Sam Adams Boston Lager was my first good quality beer. i've had so many beers i can't really remember which one i had first. had to have been SA Boston Lager or Blue Moon Belgian white. Then my 3rd one was Bud light. I actually enjoy Bud light. I have nostalgia with Bud. Its been me and my buddy's fishing beer and party beer since 2 years ago. Lot of memories. The alcohol wasnt what made the memories, its the being with friends all having a good time. the fact it was Bud Light just makes me like this beer. May not be good compared to real flavored beer. Its just my official party beer. You bring in the bud light,  its usually my first 30 pack finished at the party, followed by the coors light and bud light lime. People i party with also love corona. Pretty much, you will find this at any party worth a damn, or Alternatively Miller lite or Coors Light, or Busch too. I've brought busch, we're talking southern parties in corn fields with bonfires. brought some busch light and some bud light, and it was a good night. Any party worth anything at all will have bud coors or miller, or maybe busch, but other than that none of the off brand products. This is the supreme party beer for beer pong. Some good times partying with this beer. Still, lot better things out there. Just advertising makes this sell so well.","Alestorm4069","Dec 08, 2014"

In my lineup of Light beers, This doesn't get a metallic taste.  People on here tell people to start with the strong beers. Trust me, my cousin did that and he hates beer now. Start on something light. People say don't let bud light be someones first beer. Honestly when you first start drinking beer, you want something with a little flavor but nothing too strong. The reason i say this, is i started with blue moon. I almost hated beer from the beginning because i tried something so strong. Then, my friend gave me a bud light. I took a drink. It was nice and refreshing and didn't overwhelm me with flavor.  It was good. The reason people buy bud light, and its the number one selling beer in america, is because it doesn't offend. Its light, doesn't have much flavor and is really refreshing. Nothing to speak about, but nothing that offends either. It gets a three out of five. Its an average macro lager.","InstantBeer","Sep 07, 2014"

2.07,11.9,,,,,,"Overall (2.07) : I know why people buy this stuff, it's because there's almost nothing to be offended at and it drinks like a soda. When you have no taste, there's less chance of bitterness or off-notes. The longer you brew a beer, the more broken down it gets, and thus you have "light" beer. I far prefer the full taste of Budweiser over a Bud Light, about 10 to 1, but Bud Light isn't half bad if you're looking for a refreshing drink for the crowd that no one will object to. Best beer ever? That would be ludicrous. Best beer for frat parties? That might even be stretching it. Best beer for beer-ignorant taste-challenged rowdy boys and girls who sit around the bonfire sharing prepubescent humor and chasing tail - now that's more like it.","The-Adjunct-Hippie","Aug 24, 2014"

AROMA: tin, corn, and sweet syrup--slightly candied and demonstratively sweet... PALATE: light, as advertised--cold, crisp, watery presence, with slight carbonation ...TASTE: nearly tasteless--what does rear up its head isn't ugly, just metallic, beefy and rinsing... OVERALL: New Year's resolution: trying to spend less time babbling about subpar macros in these annuls; simple fact is, this beer's ubiquity cannot justify its smirk-inducing, blasé product that masquerades its way through billion-dollar ad campaigns; remember the penguin ads?

I never knew what beer was suppose to be like or if this was what all other beers competed against to the public. man was I wrong. I soon discovered other flavors, aromas, and depth in beers that bud light didn't offer. Although I do enjoy darker beers now I got to say bud light still holds a place in my heart. lets be real you can grab a 30pk at times for $16 during a major holiday or sporting event. Even if it doesn't hold up to other beers I'm sure it will be around for a long time to come. family and friends enjoy this pilsner beer and when its around I wont hesitate to grab one. cheers!","AZYescas","Nov 21, 2013"

Also, like most of us I am the proud owner of a decent sized beer gut, a light beer once and while makes me feel like i've made healthy choice. Yes, theres nothing outstanding about bud light, but there is also absolutely nothing wrong with it. Thats what makes it the best selling beer in the world.","JamesMcCauley93","Aug 02, 2013"

I did manage to have this fresh at the brewery though, and must confess that in that context, it is passable, albeit as a light adjunct brew, it didn't have its usual skunky metallic profile. in normal format though, this is swill I wont even usually touch. pee yellow, very fizzy, and tasting like anything but good fresh beer. I marvel at how millions of people consider this the good stuff, and how much profit it generates for its creators. to me, I would rather not drink honestly. the amount of these it would take me to get drunk is sickening, and hopefully I wont embark on that mission anytime soon. aren't they in a lawsuit for having watered this down? watering down water, that's a laugh...","StonedTrippin","Jun 18, 2013"

There is a hint of cloves and banana at the end.  To be honest, as far as the type of beer goes, it isn't bad.  It is fairly representative.  I won't mistake it for a good beer, though.

Dont hate on people that drink light beer, let them do their thing. Most girls do not drink craft beer if they drink any beer at all. I personally am beer spoiled due to my occupation, and I drink tons of craft beer with visits to Russian river, 21st amendment, victory, magic hat and goose island so far this year. The only reason these craft beers exist is because anheuser busch lets them. Craft beer is about 10% of the beer industry. Beer is meant to be drank. Drink up.","kwyers","May 14, 2013"

When I enjoy hoppy bitterness in a beer, I need it to be balanced and flavorful; this is neither of the latter. I cannot stand what little flavor is present. That bitterness might work for other people (judging by the average score, however, it does not), but when it's not balanced with anything else, it's just not for me.","Roguer","Apr 28, 2013"

Toasted grains really come through in the aroma and taste, but there is not much flavor diversity beyond that. A very refreshing beer that has a lively, highly carbonated mouthfeel. Smooth taste, with bubbles, and with very little lingering aftertaste.","Catherine8189","Apr 25, 2013"

I can't believe I'm doing this, but I used to drink so much of it before that I almost feel compelled to give it a shake now. The beer is a pale, almost clear, yellowish coloring with a frothy white head that quickly settles into a sparse coating of filmy, white bubbling. Fast, moderate amount of carbonation bubbling. Aromas of toasted grains, and not much else. Flavors of not a whole hell of a lot. Seriously. Clean, with some toasted grain characteristics, but very subtle. Aftertaste is funky, with a slightly floral and sour character to it. Clean, crisp finish. Very neat and clean brew, but lack just about every other quality.","GarthDanielson","Apr 05, 2013"

It terms of flavoring and sipping on a beer to enjoy its creativity this obviously isn't the beer for that.

I've had some terrible light lagers that are rated far higher than this simply because they are from another brewery. Easy drinking, Not offensive at all and actually has some flavor, Which is rare for the style. It isn't a craft beer, And it doesn't pretend to be a craft beer.

I feel there is always a time and a place for it. If I know I'm going to drink all day, like tailgating at a Texans game, I'm going to bust out the Bud rather than an IPA or stout. I'm not even going to break down this review and tell you color, taste, ect. because you should already know what a light lager tastes like. In my opinion this site is more about learning craft/micro brews that you possibly cant get or find so you read about them.

Perhaps; there is a low alcohol content that may be a draw over plain H2O. Superior to drinking a flavorful beer? No way! One of the primary reasons I try and drink so many beers near and far is for classic beer flavors and new and interesting twists which so many creative, thinking brewers come up with. If low alcohol and barely perceptible taste are what you're looking for, then Bud Light is the beer for you...","beergoot","Nov 12, 2012"

I definitely believe the Bud Light is a better beer with more flavor and body. It has a dark yellow color and formed like a half inch head when served on the glass. The taste is somewhat strong similar to the Budweiser Lager, but much more smoother. It leaves a very bitter taste as aftertaste and is very carbonated. Overall it is a good light beer if that's what you enjoy.","freditoj","Sep 30, 2012"

The mouthfeel is highly carbonated and very thin, and the drinkability is really not that good. For a beer that markets itself on drinkability, there's plenty of pale ales and IPAs that I can crush faster. Probably because they actually taste good, so I want to drink them. It's Bud Light.

It is not as watery and tasteless as Coors Light either; I think it's the best of the BMC light lagers, though that isn't saying much. Obviously nothing to seek out but I've had much worse and much more offensive craft beers, that I would rate below this. Most people will give it a bad grade due to it being a light lager produced by a BMC company, but it isn't offensive or skunky at all. Most of the beers on the "Bottom of the List" list are worse than this one; while it might deserve to be on the list, it should be much lower than #5.","mdfb79","Mar 28, 2012"

Mouth is light, balance is easy when there isn't much there. I still use the 'overall' as drinkability. Fuck new rules. Drinkability is high, though. Easy to quaff when you need a glass of water.

As a "light lager", BL is understandably light-bodied and pale, but it is so bland and pitiful I don't see the point in drinking it, as water would be a cheaper, healthier alternative as a mere thirst-quencher; and I don't see why anyone would drink BL out of enjoyment, it seems to be a beer that is consumed in huge quantities and marketed to the lowest denominator.","Sudsy89","Jun 11, 2011"

That metallic/alcohol finishes is terrible. 4.5% and it has that kinda awful finish? So how do I score this beer? It is a light lager which I don’t get. It has as many calories as Guinness so I’m not sure what light even means. It isn’t diet as there are calories. It isn’t any more summer weather than something even like their “bud heavy.” Why do people drink this? Ultimately there isn’t anything about this beer that stands up to a good beer. Sure smell is offensive and the over carbonated mess with a lack luster flavor makes this thing completely undrinkable.

2.73,47.6,2.5,2,2,3,5,"Summary: This is a horrible beer. I gave it a 5.9/10, or an F. As far as beer goes, this one's not a good choice. If you're in need of light beer, then I would say it's okay. It's cheap, highly drinkable (because it's basically like drinking water), and can get you drunk if you drink enough of it. In my younger days this was the standard beer of choice for parties (Due to cheapness, availability, and drinkability). This beer loses a lot of points for taste and satisfaction, but gains a few for drinkability. So if you're goal is to get really drunk or supply several guests with beer and save money, then by all means go for this beer. If your goal is to enjoy a great beer, look elsewhere. I wouldn't drink this beer again unless the only other available options were the rest of the commercial light beers.","Aphexwolf","Nov 11, 2010"

There is also the bitter tasting backer which i can only assume is the flavor derived from trying to smooth out and lager mass produced grains that are of lower quality. The mouth feel is lightly carbonated as I would expect from the very light body. The drinkability depends on your personal preference. While it may be physically easy to drink this, the more you consume of it the more you will hate your life. And as a funny side note this probably has a similar amount of sugar per volume as Guinness. So why would you choose this? There are cheaper things out there if cost is the issue.

Yet it is drinkable because of how non-existent it is (I gave it a 3.5 for drink) so if you're drinking/chugging as fast as you can you can catch a buzz.","joshwlt","Jun 12, 2008"

Hops may add a touch of balance, but do little to impart any decernable flavors or aromas to the beer. Basically void of meaninful taste.

Very light grain and rice flavors, malty with nothing else to add any complexity to it. This truly tastes like I am drinking water.

Plus a darker aroma that comes across as sort of cardboard and mushroom, but which I'm beginning to recognize as Spalt hops. Tastes very watery. Mildly malt sweet and with a dark hop character. Hop is extremely mild and is *way* below the sting from the carbonation. In fact, I would say the carbonation contributes more to the flavor than anything else. The first sip was decent, as I could really 'get' the malt and hops, but all subsequent tastes were lacking. I'm not sure if my DFH pint glass will ever recover. I was foolish to use it for this Bud Light. The mouthfeel is extremely thin, like water. The beer actually improved a bit when I swirled to release some of the carbonation.

Combine that with the average price tag for a 24 pack being around $14 and you get an all-around rip-off. Its considered good beer by those who have never had anything except for MGD, Rolling Rock, or Coors Light. Personally, I'd rather have a Keystone Light, Natty Light, or even a PBR.
