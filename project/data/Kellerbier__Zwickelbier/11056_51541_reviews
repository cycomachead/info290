"It's very impressive, a little large and unexpected, but really delicious for a Keller."
""

"Overall: Pretty impressive. It stands right up there with some of the best Kellerbiers I've tried in Germany. It's components are all distinct, yet it pulls together as one. Very balanced and rounded. Remarkably drinkable in that it's easy to drink, but also offers enough character to keep it interesting."
""
"Would probably have again; worth trying if for nothing else than it is not an oft-done style."
"O: A spicy, peppery Kellerweiss is there ever was one. Great smooth mouthfeel, a proper lager for sure. Super drinkability but borderline due to all the herbal and peppery flavors. Gives it a real kick. Very flavorful for 5.5% as a result. Sorta reminds me of a really peppery saison at points."
""
"Overall: A very pronounced level of carbonation, but, still, it's a rather refreshing brew."
""
""
"O: This Kellerbeer seems to be happier compared to other beers I've had but still has nice complex flavors of yeast."
"The Kellerbier/Zwickelbier style is not one I get my hands on often, but this was quite good and sessionable, one I recommend trying as it was tasty with a low ABV. Would love to pound about 10 of these on a sunny Saturday afternoon and see what kind of chaos would follow, in the spirit of German brewing, of course..."

"375ml bottle. Weizen glass. - sweet malt & honey aromas fly at the moment cap is removed. Golden color, crystal clear appearance. White froth, foamy & lasting thin layer on top, spots are left on sides. Slightly woody, grainy & malty aromas. Crispy upfront, light citric flavor & arising bitterness rounded by green wood & light piney hues. Light body. Soft carbonation. Dense palate & spicy touch, gentle effervescence but no watery sensation. Low herbal, honey notes & clean bitterness â€“allowing caramel be shown- resolve in a dry bitter/sweet finish. Refreshing & nice drinkability !!"

"O - An excellent, drinkable beer. I'd prefer it in the summer, but didn't want to wait."

"Drinkability: It's a very smooth drinkable beer accompanied with good flavors and aromas."
"O/D - A little underwhelming, but decent for the style I suppose. Enjoyed the 375mL format b/c I probably wouldn't finish a 750 of this."

"Spot-on keller. Can easily imagine drinking this at a German country brew house."
""
"O - A great example of the style, loads of flavour and easily sessioned. I could pound this stuff for days!"

"O - an interesting and enticing mix of flavours, super easy drinking, a unique brew and style"
"Overall, I'm enjoying the Kellerbier. I could do without the slight maltiness, but that's more my preference (for Bohemian instead of Bavarian lagers) and not a knock on the beer itself. I think it would go really well with summer fare, as it definitely seems like a fine food beer to me. I always like trying unfiltered pilsners (especially those on lees), and this is one of the better examples of that style. I'd pick this up again."
"Too revolting to drink more than a few amazed sips. This is the newer label that's been around for at least a couple of years. $11 for the big bottle, I'm sorry to say."
"Overall: A real winner. Refreshing and elegant. This can be a good gateway beer yet still satisfy the discerning craft beer drinker."
"Overall, I find this hard to rate because I am not much of a lager fan. Trying to rate this to style, it seems pretty good. Some nice and interesting flavours- the slight sour/funk is very good. However, the lightness and ""clean"" flavour does not work for me. Since I suppose those are part of the package for a Keller Bier, I would say this is a good example of the style."
"This is my first Keller Bier and I found it to be highly satisfying and nourishing. I imagine this would be perfect with lunch, after physical work in the summer. However, I easily finished the entire bomber while reading in February."
"This is as complex of a lager as you are going to find. It is tasty and worth repeating."
"Poured from a corked and caged 750 into my Hofbrau Maskrug (liter mug). Body of the beer is a hazy orange amber color with visible carbonation. A few solids can be seen floating around. The head stands two fingers after the pour. Retention is impressive, its been sitting for at least 5 minutes and it has barely fallen. Smell is of light sweet malts, strawberries, slightly wild, truly delicious smelling. Taste is smooth and clean. I detect herbal hops, Some biscuit, some citrus. Mouthfeel is average, with a tickle of carbonation. This is a great beer, really tasty, generally enjoyable with a nice low ABV."
"O - An enjoyable beer that very easy to drink and offers a nice amount of complexity for only being 5.5%. Would definitely drink again, if offered."
""
"O: a nice beer, but not a rebuy for me."
""
"Bottle: Poured a hazy light amber lager with a large foamy head with good retention and minimal lacing. Aroma of light caramel malt is totally dominating with no discernable hops. Taste is also a malt bomb with loads of malt that is easily quaffable and with some light horse grain notes also discernable. Full body with great carbonation and no noticeable alcohol. Good stuff!"
"I was pumped to see that a few beers from Les Trois Mousquetaires landed in my market, but the fact that this one was underwhelming at best will definitely make it difficult for me to pick up another one of these."
""
"Overall, this is the most enjoyable Kellerbier I've had to date. I really liked its fruity aspect as well as its delicate, soft, and smooth feel."
""
"D - Good beer and would match well with a variety of foods; unique"
"pour is a monster of a head that seems to scream i'm well made and oily. 3 fingers of head that seemed to crystallize into large bubbles with lace. nose of first and foremost... basement. hint of grape and apple and honey suckle. palate is floral grassy like that of an edible flower. interesting ester that are one part pollen, one part basement mildew and a hop dry finish of lingering oils. fantastic. my perfect session."
"Only my second-ever Keller/Zwickel, the other being New Glarus's excellent Yokel. The Yokel felt more like what a traditional version might be like, while this feels adulterated or more experimental. And that's fine with me. Still haven't had one from the fatherland, so I suppose I've yet to try the real deal, but I know I like the style based on these two examples."
"O: This is good but a little heavy on the banana. Is this just a feature of the unfiltered Kellerbier style?"
"O -- There is no bottling or best-by date on this beer, so I'm not sure if the mustiness is due to stale beer, or that's just the character of the brewery's yeast. Nevertheless, it gives this beer an odd character that might be overlooked in another style, but in a Pils it's rather damning -- even an unfiltered Pils. The sweet, fresh malt character saves this beer for me and allows me to finish the bottle, but I don't know if I'm tempted to pick up another."
"Not a common style in my country; it sits somewhere between pilsner and farmhouse ale. It's richness might be a challenge for some, but to me it oozes goodness."
"Drinkability: this is a very easy drinking beer. This beer is nicely refreshing and makes the tastebuds happy."
"A nice and interesting beer on the whole. A little less bitterness would help but it is still good."
"After receiving but a taste of what LTM had to offer last summer with their standard mixpack, I couldn't wait to sample more of their brews. I can safely say that their Kellerbier was more than worth the wait. A markedly bitterer and huskier kellerbier than I've experienced before, but this robust flavor was certainly welcome. Terrific work from LTM!"
"but its very good!"
"Very funky and complex with none of the usual cleaned up lager profile found in craft pils. The beer pours slightly cloudy with a hoppy funky nose. Takes a few sips to get used to the slightly fruity/yeasty notes that come from being unfiltered. Very unique beer"
"A very delicious lager beer with more pronounced lemony/lemon grass earthiness and unadulturated heaft than usual. It's like drinking beer without training wheels."
"Gentle and easy to drink but quite complex, and always interesting. I am about to polish off the 750 (an ideal partner for my lunch of fresh crab and and mayo, btw) and wish I had a lot more. Might be one of the best session beers I can think of."
"Pours a hazy, golden orange with spots of clarity around the edges. About three fingers of sudsy, and dish-soaplike (not in a bad way!) head. Settles nicely, with a shit-ton of webbed lace. Nose is a bouquet of fresh floral hops, fresh cut grass and a nice organic, earthy malt; crisp biscuitiness. Taste dominated by typical german pilsner hops and again, the fresh cut 'grassiness' of this beer shines brightly. Some more lemon zest and a hint of some mint here. Fairly long, dry finish with moderately-high bitterness. Drinkability is nice, I could do this 750 solo. Again, some nice stuff from LTM."
"Drink - A great beer that I am happy I tried. I would recommend this beer to others who like a light but hoppy beer - perfect for warm days."
"golden straw body color with a bit of haze. little head that fizzled out quickly, no carbonation in the body, but the bottle had plenty of pressure. smells similar to a belgian triple or a belgian amber yeast. hint of alcohol. good malty front end, a bit more than i expected. no traces of alcohol in the front but a little musty yeast flavor, smoth middle, and a hoppy bitter finish. overall a good balance. Mouthfeel is oily and thick."
"D - Easy to drink, but with tons of flavor. One of the best lagers I've had in some time. Definitely a beer to seek out."
"This brew pours a cloudy off golden hue with nice carbonation that leaves behind a frothy two finger head and nice lacing everywhere,the smell is quite sweet with aromas of honey,fresh pollen,toffee malt and also some musty vinegar,the mouthfeel really suits the style which nice and full feeling with flavours of jarrah honey,floral hops,fresh barley,a touch of mustiness and finishes with a nice bitter kick,overall a nice drop that has some tasty flavours due to the unfiltration."
"Good beer. I'd drink it again. Fun when you hesitate between a clean euro lager and something busier."
"My first mousquetaires bottling and I'm impressed."
"I would keep this beer away from more intense foods like Indian, Mexican or Chinese food - it will just be overwhelmed. But it will work wonders with grilled meats, soft cheeses or fish. I feel like the winter will wash it away, so enjoy it in the sun, and it will treat you right."
"Really clean drinking, but lots of complexity to it as well. A great beer to start off a tasting session, but I could sink quite a few of these as well."
"This is a really great keller and a great beer all up. On the palate, it's spot-on stylistically. It's so fresh and clear - just how a really awesome lager should be, but it has masses of character as well to make it an interesting and enjoyable experience. Amazingly refreshing, and refreshingly tasty. Top drop."
"Mouthfeel is light bodied with medium carbonation. A nice kellerbier, very balanced and drinkable."
"Pours a bright hazy copper color with a lasting white head. Aroma of bready malt, lemon, and an earthy mustiness. The taste is lemon, honey, peppery spices, yeast, and floral/grassy hops. Medium bodied, really good creamy mouthfeel. This is my first beer of the style so I had no idea what to expect. A 750mL bottle is a bit difficult to finish off but this is a well-done, interesting beer."
"Delicate sweet aroma of concord grapes and honey is quite inviting. Dense off-white head sits atop the hazy golden beer. Delicate flavor is a mix of concord grape and with faint floral/grassy and lemon accents all wrapped up in a mildly bitter finish. Moderately light body with mild carbonation and light flavors make for a very drinkable beer."
"Slainte and better luck next time."
"D - Pretty nice and easy drinking beer. This would make an excellent session brew if you could find it on-tap - stupid Ontario keg laws. At least we're getting Trois Mousquetaires bottles in Chicago now."
"Oh how I wish I was closer to a regular supply of this beer. It could be a regular drinker, easily quaffable, plenty of kick. These guys do a MEAN lager. Compared to Creemore Keller this is 10 times meaner. Damn tasty, big flavor for a session beer."
"D: It's easy to drink, it's balanced."
"drinkability is good. nice balance. liked the big hop presence. good stuff."
"Really interesting enjoyable beer. Not my favorite style, but I enjoyed the hell out of this"
"Great beer! Poured with a nice off white foamy frothy head and good lace. Color is a hazy amber. Aroma is a wonderful spice yeast malt . Flavor's like aroma and richer. Body is great and so is carbonation. Finish is like flavor and of short length. Definitely a session beer."
"...bloody awesome lager"
"Very nice for a regional example. I'm just looking for something that I can drink with some pizza and they seem to work well."
"I can see no reason why you shouldn't try this beer, yet another winner from a great brewery."
"Its always good to find a new Keller beer of good quality, and this from a Quebec brewer fits that bill.Poured into a .5 liter stein a hazed rich golden with deep burnt orange tint,a large fluffy white head that flowed over my stein atop,it settles nicely into a frothy mass.Toasty,grainy malt aromas with a little iron and leafy hop,a nice mix of the malt and German hops.Toasty and quite dry on the palate,a tinge of mineral/iron and spicy hop, with crisp finish makes for a real drinker on a crazy hot day like today down here in NC it fits the bill.A very nice keller beer crisp with good flavor,Iam gonna try the dopplebock next from these guys."
"This was flavourful and refreshing. I Will definitely have this one again."
"D: decent but the finish really bothers me"
"This is a great beer with a full flavour that is far from the norm. Certainly worth checking out, and makes me want to find more in this style."
"Reviewed on 11/20/2009. Bottle. Pours a hazy light orange with a small, thick white head. Aroma of skunk and sweet lager malt. Flavor of sweet lager malt, some stale malt, with some spices (peppery) and some lavender. Not a great kellerbier, but perhaps it would be better a little fresher? Still drinkable and enjoyable."
"D: Very drinkable."
"Huge thanks to zorprime for sending me this bottle."
"D - Drinkability is high. Overall this beer is very nice for the style."
"Very drinkable, sessionable even for a weekend lunch. Purs a light colour with a generoud creamy head. Malty aroma. Nicely balanced Saaz hop, a mild taste. Coincidentially, Creemore releases a kellerbeer at the same time, which was more creamy, more tasty.Very Above average mouthfeel."
"Interesting style of beer and certainly worth trying. Might not be everyone's 'cuppa', but hop heads might find it like a Helles lager and an IPA."
"While this isn't a bad tasting beer, I can't say it's all that drinkable. I've never really had a beer tasting like this one (maybe because I've never tried a kellerbeer) and enjoyed the first glass for it's uniqueness but finishing this whole 750ml is going to be a little hard. It's a bit too astringent and bitter to have more than one. Worth checking out, just don't plan on sessioning this one."
"One in a select group of German-style lagers that just begs to be consumed, from that first moment of introduction. LTM has nailed that concept, so glad that I have more of it with which to wile a bit of warm afternoon away, as this is one equitable example of the originators of the style - hoppy, biscuity, dry, and simple in the best sort of way. Not much more to say here, I suppose, other than some big-ups to those Quebecois fellas who thought this might be a good idea to pursue in the first place."
"I just polished off a 750 ml bottle and I'd happily move on to another."
