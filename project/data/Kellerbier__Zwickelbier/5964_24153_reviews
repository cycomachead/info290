"overall: Although this didn't break any records for great taste for me, overall, I liked it. Would love it on a cool morning in the winter. Not bad in the end"

"An over-smooth Kellerbier, I would like it to be rougher."

"Drinkability : an average beer in the style Keller Bier."
"In a blind test, I would call this an Altbier, the tartness, carbonation, light maltiness, all fit the style. As a Kellerbier, not too impressive."
"A solid and very refreshing brew, just what I was looking for in a Friday evening."
"The taste is very refreshing. Lots of pilsner and lager style flavors to include the husky tastes and feels of a good keller bier."
"BB Oct-05. Great white foam that's thick as whipped cream and beautifull and very clowdy golden beer. Smell is fresh, very hopflowery( H.mittelfrueh or Saaz?). Together with litle maltarome of palemalt and some yeastesters making it a good nose. Taste is litle empty, alcoholic and malty. Still the fresh and flowery hops noticable making this one enjoyable. Hops are good but there is a litle yeastbitterness in the aftertaste. Not that disturbing though and the brew overall gives a fresh and flowery mouthfeel, but be aware of the alcohol cause it drinks like lemonade."
