"I would recomend this beer to any beer drinker- snob through casual, a must try, an eye opener"
"Overall: Decent and refreshing; a good beer for a warm afternoon"

"Overall: this is a really interesting zwickel bier, mild but with a good character nonetheless. It's definitely refreshing and drinkable. Worth a try!"

"has sort of a saison (spicy, grainy) / pilsner (hoppy) / hefeweizen (yeast) orgy-complexity - very interesting brew - the nearly numbing tartness is fascinating - where does it come from?"

"I went with an aggro pour since it was meant to be unflitered and cloudy anyway so anything that I may have stirred up was not going to make a difference. I got just under a finger of fluffy bone-white head that held up nicely on this hot, humid afternoon. Color was a cloudy orangish-yellow. Nose was very malty and quite lager-like. I really enjoy adjunct-free lagers these days. Mouthfeel was big and soft, not full per se, but quite carbonated and the taste was sort of tangy, like wheat may have been involved. Finish had a lemon citrus quality, making it not only dry and refreshing but also reinforcing my belief that wheat may have been involved."
"Would love to be able to drink this all the time, especially during the current heat spell we're experiencing."

"O- Overall, a highly drinkable lager with a really nice mouthfeel. I prefer Columbus Summer Teeth and Sam Adams Alpine Spring to this German example of the style."
""
""
"Overall: It's okay; it could use some more crispness."
""
"Poured from a brown 11.2 oz. bottle. Has a cloudy light golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is sweet, malty. Taste is crisp, malts and grains, lightly hopped, very dry at the finish. Good but not overpowering flavor. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a pretty good beer."
"O: Overall crsip, with a bright hop zing, easy drinking, nice german malting and good example."
""
"Drinkability and Overall Impression: An easily drinkable beer and one that could serve well for an evening of multiple servings along with dinner and conversation with friends. My overall impression is of a nicely complex beer with lots of interesting flavors that I’ll be looking for in the future to have again."
"Cloudy pale yellow under a fluffy white head. Pale fruity, malt sweet aroma...bready yeast, honey, and soft noble hops. Nice pale malt base with a solid floral hoppiness on top. Sweet, somewhat peppery flavor and some honey and grape. Fresh and light, fairly crisp yet soft. Good, refreshingly clean lager."

"A decent beer but not my favorite."
""
"Clean finish, good carbonation, crisp and refreshing. Nice but not super exciting. I’d still prefer a good hefeweizen over this. Definitely on the light side; an easy drinker."
"D: Very tasty, goes down quite easily, not too filling, mild kick, very good representation of style, this is a nice lighter German-style beer with a lot of flavor and substance making it worth pounding down for a long time."
"Overall nice, crisp and clean, soft creamy malts, hint of grassy hops, very drinkable."
"Not light in body but simple in flavor. It is quite a refreshing beer. Enjoyable."
"O-was at a new bar in a new area that had dozens of exciting beers. I only had the time to get one beer and I chose this due to my ongoing curiosity of the style, I was sure glad I did. This is an extremely drinkable beer and a joy to have. I'll be searching this one out!"
"Over all this German lager has every thing a beer geek would want from this style. A great balance of hops and barely and light body. Besides the price.... this is up there with the top German Lagers."
"This beer is crisp and refreshing, the sort of thing I'd be happy to drink if we ever get warm weather again. Yet, there's a real depth to it. Again, it's most similar to an unfiltered Pilsner, a style of which I've only had a few, and I'm not sure I could say categorically what makes this beer different from them. But what I can say is I will happily seek out this or other Zwickl beers in the future, and I hope American breweries start making some!"
"Drink these before they go old, that is all."
"Arcobräu Zwickl Lager pours a very pretty hazy golden color with some blond hints here and there. Nice fluffy white head, sparse lace. Smell is my favorite part of the brew, it smells great with herbal hop scent, some grain with a nice spicy yeast in the back. Some faint fruitiness and just great scents. Taste does not deliver based on the nose but this is great delicious beer. European herbal hoppings with some grain, apple skin, faint nuts, and bready yeast backing, once again delish. Feel is a light bodied lager with some nice bubble activity and a crispness on the tounge. This is great beer and a growler on a Sunday would be an easy task."
"Interesting style creates a very easy drinking lager. Nice taste."
"Dang, I could drink these all damn day in the summer."
"Lighter bodied, but over- carbonated. I liked this, but way too fizzy. A clean crisp beer and worth a try for sure."
"Being that this style isn't very pronounced in the U.S, I'm impressed with this example."
"Pours a hazy pale orange with some bright white head. Cloudy but not murky. Nose is faint with some flowery notes and a little orange. Palate is crisp and juicy at the same time. Orange blossoms come to mind. Great, full mouthfeel for a layer. Really enjoyable!"
"Beer is light in body and wet on the palate, highly drinkable but light on flavor. I find it watery a little and wanting something on the finish. There is a mild earthy bitterness but it is too little too late. I might have it again but it would be more enjoyable if it had more flavor or body."
"O - A nice summer beer or session beer in my opinion. A bit on the lighter side all around but a good pick."
"Overall though pretty tasty and a dense dough blast that comes off as refreshing."
"Pours a slightly-hazy light golden color with a good white head and some mild lacing. The nose brings a bit of very light hops, but mostly grainy malt. Too much grain, actually. The flavor is mostly raw grain and base malt without too much else going on. Light body and crisp carbonation. Decent enough, but not something I'd come back for."
"While definitely not a common style to be imported into the US, it's one that is admired by both consum- ers and brewers alike. Slightly yeast-hazed golden hue; the draping of white lace on the glass is an amaz- ing sight. Faint peppery notes, with grape skin, fresh-cut grass and bready nose. Refreshing with its snappy crispness, smoothness ensues in the back of the lighter body. Fresh dry grain and light, nutty yeast meld quite well together. Hops hone in for balance and give off a light herbal freshness. Finishes very dry with a clean grain-and-yeast aftertaste."
"D: The beer isn't that difficult to drink, although there's nothing really unique about the taste that would make me want to try it again."
