"330 ml bottle into lager glass, no bottle dating. Pours lightly hazy deep golden amber color with a 1 finger dense white head with good retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of lemon zest, orange peel, pear, apple, cracker, biscuit, light honey, floral, grass, straw, light pepper, and herbal/yeast earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance of hop, malt, and yeast ester notes; with solid strength. Taste of lemon zest, orange peel, pear, apple, cracker, biscuit, light honey, floral, grass, light pepper, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Light earthy herbal bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of lemon zest, orange peel, pear, apple, cracker, biscuit, light honey, floral, grass, light pepper, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and robustness of malt, hop, and yeast ester flavors; with zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth, crisp, and slightly bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very nice Czech pilsner style. All around good robustness and balance of malt, hop, and yeast ester flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A very enjoyable offering."

"It's sort of a kellerbier/BPA hybrid, with a cloudy yellow hue and a tall egg white head; the smell is grains and sugar, with some herbal notes. The taste is heavy on the Belgian sugar and Belgian yeast, with some graham cracker malt and lots of sharp bitter hops. This beer excels in its mouthfeel, full and clean and sharp all at once. Not sure this is a kellerbier, but it's a good one anyway."

"Late note: looks like BA admins changed the style to keller bier / zwickel bier the next day (9/13/12) after I submitted an info change request. Cool, and thanks BA!"

"Pours a hazy gold with a foamy off-white head that settles to a small cap on top of the beer. Small streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, citrus zest, and some perfume-like aromas. Taste is much the same with a medium amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer that is quite tasty and drinkable. Interesting to see such a beer from a brewery known for gueuze and lambic."
"The pour is a lightly hazed golden straw color with a dense white head. Nice sweet nose on this with bread, biscuit, and honey malt aromas. Some floral notes, a pleasant fruitiness, somewhat earthy as well. The beer has a nice biscuit and bread flavor to it and a good overall sweetness. A hint of bitterness, floral and earthy hop notes, a light citrus peel flavor, and a little bit dry on the finish."
"Overall nice, not quite up to most german pilsners but getting there, nice over hopped americanized pilsner."

"Cap dated 02/09/11! Served from bottle into a Drie Fonteinen ‘3’ long stemmed flute. Poured a slightly hazy yellow-orange with a one finger white head that remained throughout. Maintained nice lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, wheat, lemon zest, lemon rine, lemon meringue, citrus, and sugar. The flavor was of sweet malt, wheat, lemon zest, citrus, lemon rine, and subtle spices. It had a light feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this was a good brew. The aroma on this one was definitely the highlight of this brew as the lemon meringue aspect was really quite pleasant and inviting. The flavor was fairly light, but still quite complex. Definitely a well done Czech Pilsener if I’m honest. Glad I got to try this one and it was even half-off! I suggest you do the same."
"Cheers!"
"Medium-bodied with pleasant, modest carbonation makes this very easy on the palate, just slightly foaming and tingling. Could take fairly quick swigs of this, if desired. Finish is rather dry."

"Overall, it's a real odd one, but the primarily apple bent on this just doesn't jive with me, so I'll never have this again. By no means is this a bad beer though."
"Overall: This is kind of a weird beer. I'm thinking Belgian pale maybe? I'm not really sure what else to say about it. 3"

"Thanks Todd."
"This is a light bodied brew with a prickly level of carbonation that is very crisp in the finish. All around, this is a very solid take on the style. I feel guilty for opening this and not sharing it with someone. Specifically my friend Pete who has a sick fascination with well made Pilsner brews. I need to seek one of these out again to share with him. While I give this a solid A- rating, I foresee him giving this nearly a perfect 5 across the board."

"Overall: What a nice refreshing lager! Very nice hop profile. Tartness from wild yeast that some people seem to taste is nonsense. This beer is sold at 3 Fonteinen, but that is about the only link there is with the wild yeast. (double checked with the creators). Great for the style!"

"Overall, this gets high marks because it’s a really damn interesting beer. You really do get the sense that you’re drinking sort of a throwback beer with this one."
"O; nice beer not a lager as the name says but a crossover between lager and i.p.a. i think nice refreshing beer"
"I gotta say at first I was thinking no way was this a czech pilsner but after tasting and smelling the big spicy and floral hop combination I gotta say that I agree.Poured into a pilsner a slightly clouded light golden with a big fluffy crown that held for a longtime.Big spicy/floral hops in the nose to go with big yeast,spicy hops really hit hard on the palate,maybe the most hoppy non American lager I have had,yeasty and fruity its very well rounded.This is a great lager beer,the label says best Belgian lager and I might agree with that,not sure if its a close rendition of a Bamburg style lager though."
"D: One of the better lagers I've had. I was very surprised to find this in DC when I even had trouble getting it in Beersel. Anyway, I'm glad to have tried it and will definitely pick it up again if I see it."
"Good pilsener, quite dry and spicy. This beer pours a mildly hazy banana yellow with a healthy white head. Big chunks of foam stick to the sides of the glass. The aroma is mostly grassy hops, clean, light malt and very mildly fruity yeast. The fruitiness is reminiscent of peppercorns and dried lemon rind. The taste is rather dry for the style. The peppercorn spice is much stronger on the tongue, and the grassy hops pack a pretty good punch in the finish. This is not really an easy drinking pils, but it's interesting without straying too much from the style. Mouthfeel is light and a bit slick. The dry and bitter finish is just this side of harsh. Price was a bit high, but I'm glad to have tried it."
"Nice hazy straw color. Big puffy head that lifts out of my glass like a meringue. The amount of head retention left me in awe actually. Smells like crisp light malt and grassy hops. Light sweet taste and a balanced earthy bitterness. I would like a touch more sweetness and hop flavor though. Finish ends with a small amount of acidity. Completely refreshing. Crisp carbonation. One of the best german style lagers I've had. Left me wanting more."
"wow. very impressive and true to what it claims to be... a lager with a drie fonteinen personality. dark, burnt gold with a white head that holds and goes to collar. nose is floral and bready like a lager should be with some citrus and honey notes popping up, but what i think is really cool is that there seems to be a faint, rustic, musty, earthy and almost sour thing going on in the background (especially when it is colder, which was strange to me) that really gives it an authentic taste and original personality. good balance, nice, light body that was a tad overcarbonated for my taste, and that is just barely. really a fun beer to try, and quite refreshing. too bad this carried a 5.99 price tag for an 11.2oz bottle!!"
"Beersels Lager has a favorable impression overall but it is very minerally (salty) and has a lot of sulfury and acidic notes that compete with the softer malty compounds and pure floral hop notes. These may hurt the beer as much as they help."
"The best lager in Belgium? I'm not sure, but certainly it is the most interesting one I've consumed from the region."
"D: Very good, love the flavor just wish there was a bit more of it."
"Pours a pale golden straw with a healthy white frothy head that laces pretty well as things progress. The smell is faint but pleasant: notes of wheat, corn, light citrus, and a vague sense of red berries. The taste follows the smell, berries included (again, there is no direct berry flavor, but rather a general impression thereof hiding somewhere in the distance). The bitterness of the hops comes through very well, but the finish is overly dry and chalky. The body as a whole is quite moderate, with the right amount of carbonation and the right amount of smoothness, creating a highly drinkable pils."
"D: Nice enough for the style."
"The taste is a good, full-bodied, meaty-fruity malty grain with apple, pronounced yeastiness, a lot of lemon. It is fruity-yeasty-grainy up front, followed by a lightly tart, faintly bitter-leaning, lemony-grassy finish that lingers with some lightly sweet grain and spiciness. It has a definite spicey-yeasty rustic quality throughout."
"Drinkability: Pretty good. The light, airy carbonation profile keeps this one easy to drink but there's also enough flavor within to keep you interested."
"Very earthy and bitter from the hops but the bitterness is well balanced by a pilsner malt backbone. Hints of straw and grass. Slightly lactic with some nice sour oak notes. Clean and crisp with a dry finish."
"this is a very interestingly weird beer. de proef brewing a lager?!? were they really trying for a czech pilsner? too much fruitiness and phenols if we're being strict to style. still, it's a nice drink."
"pour is golden with a nice white soapy head. about 2 fingers which fade to a wonderful lace. smell at first is grass but that is over powered with a distinct lemon. there is an subtle aroma of straw in the backbone. which comes through in the palate as the dry ending. beer is honey malt sweet and has a belgian blond like volume of pollen. somewhere in between those styles really. pilsner and belgian blonde, single or whatever name BA has for it. the dough is absolute belgian, the predominate lemon zest nature has a mild apple and caramel not to it. and the finish is a very slight bitter. excellent for the abv. would rate it as a 'drinkable' pilsner though. somewhat unconventional... somewhere between beligian and plzen. don't think its a czech pils though. more so a lemony belgian blond with a bitter pilsner finish."
"Picked up a single at the Hopduvel beer store in Gent and enjoyed it while walking around town on a bright, sunny day. This was one of maybe three hoppy beers I drank while in Belgium. It reminded me quite a bit of Victory's Prima Pils, but a notch softer with the bitterness. Big citrus, grassy, herbal hops - delicious. Find this beer when you're in Belgium."
"D- This is a light crisp easy quaffing beer that has good depth of flavor and a nice complexity that grows as the beer warms."
"I could surely see others enjoy in this one, but not me. Different strokes for different folks indeed. This would not be a pilsener in any way to me and Im going back to my standbys."
"Pours a hazed straw yellow, touch of gold, medium white head, drops to a thick ring around the glass, lots of lacing, looks good. Smell is very fresh and floral, some grains and toast, crisp lemony aroma, oranges, a bit herbal and spicy, refreshing. Tastes sweet up front, honey, oranges, biscuity middle, with lemon zest and floral, spicy herbal finish, bit of a sour edge, solid bitterness. Mouthfeel is light bodied with medium carbonation, sharp finish, very refreshing."
"drinkability is good. nice balance and very easy drinking. the hops dry it out a little and help lighten the body."
"The label claims that Beersel Lager is 'the best lager of Belgium'. Since I haven't had many Belgian lagers, and since I can't recall the ones I have had, I'm inclined to agree. Why do almost all beers from this country taste fresh, while a considerable portion of the low-ABV lagers from the rest of Europe taste anything but?"
"Pours a hazed orange yellow with a nice whitish head that sticks around. Nose is very crisp and clean. Almost seemed to have a green apple edge at first. Minor dough kicks in. Flavor is definitely interesting. Very unique for the style, but very well done. Crisp with some apple on there and a defined sweetness. But really it is fairly dry and hits smoothly and then falls off, but in a good way. Feel is smooth on liquid and has a full carbonation. This is a Czech Pilsener that has some obvious minor Belgian influence. Very interesting indeed. Definitely one to try."
"This is a nice Czech pilsner, but not as crisp and as biting as say a Pilsner Urquell or Budvar, which I find more representative of the style. The beer pours a slightly cloudy golden color with not a whole lot of carbonation. There is a white head and some lacing. The smell has the nice musty, wet grass aromas of a pilsner with some sweeter malts in the background. The taste is not as sharp, a little creamier, a bit more floral than is typical of the style. There is some breadiness to the beer along with noticeable clean pale malts. There is a bit of waterishness to the beer in the finish and less the peppery bite I was expecting. There is some lemony florals in the finish as well, and only the slightest puckerishness in the aftertaste. As the beer settles, there is more pungent lemony flavors, and a bit more dry tartness in the finish. This is a decent drinking beer, but not the best pilsner as advertised."
"D: It may not have tons of competition in the 'Best Lager of Belgium' category, so if I concur that may not be saying much. to say it's a highly enjoyable, very likable lager that compares quite favorably with some of my favorites of Germany/Europe and the US is... Quite tasty."
"It has an unheard of level of creaminess that contributes alot to a higher overall impression. I could have several of these on a warm day for sure. It would likely pair well with a wide range of foods."
"Unfiltered pale gold, cloudy, homogeneous and well carbonated. The head is pure white, diminishing but long-lasting. The most attractive small-bubbled, crisp carbonation and texture enhance the soft mineral aspects that pair with the hay-like pils malts to create an ultimate tool for refreshment. The perfect flavorful quaffer. Good base malt also ensures a certain roundness, medium bodied lets say, slightly honeyed though not biscuity. It escapes the usual oiliness of many czech pils to capture the essence of fresh hops, the vibrant spiciness, highly leafy and floral, yet intense in a way that cant but remind of citrus. An elegant creation that speaks a whole book about the no compromise approach of those 2 legendary lambic brewers. Full on quality, great ingredients, yet open-minded and creative. I think I do prefer Christoffel Blonde, but I consider this as my 2nd favorite pils for now. Competent punchy bitterness, dry and crisp. A grand hoppy beer like I enjoy them."
"BB 12-10-07. Good and nice white head and a golden beer with quiet some medium sized flocks floating around. Nose is very hoppy and giving lots of belgium green aswell as a piney and grape like hint. Backed by good maltyness and a unmistakenly bottom fermenting yeast profile. Taste full bodied without being sweet and has clean malttaste. Aftertaste is only hops as bitterness is well dosed and stays on the tongue for quiet a while. Remembers of great bavarian vollbier taste and can keep up with them( minus presentation) aswell as with the XX bitter and Hexapoda."
