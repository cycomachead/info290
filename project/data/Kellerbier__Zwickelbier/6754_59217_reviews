"In the end I was impressed, if somewhat disappointed that I didn't find something more exciting. Of course it all makes sense: the malt that they're using would surely mimic what was being produced in the early 1900's; and given their location to the southwest of Munich a brown, semi-malty ale would have still been the norm."
"For a German beer, this is really good."

"T: Grassy Saaz hops, toast, caramel, and biscuit. Mineral water helps it trend toward the middle. Carapils malt gives a neutral flavor. Not bad, not earth shattering. I imagine this as a cross flavor wise between a dunkel and pilsner- a very sweet pilsner. Nothing offputting if a bit corny Would taste horrible warm. Would like to taste some other examples of the style."

"Overall: Everything about this beer is below average. There are notes of apricot and butterscotch on the nose and tongue, but they are masked by more unpleasant characteristics such as iron and yeast."

"Overall it is a very curious beer that has a unique profile. While it does not present any new flavors it does combine them Ina unique way. Enjoyable, but not something I will search out for."

"O-surprized by the taste. This beer was great."
"This is a relatively fruity smelling zwickel lager from Bavaria. It has a good aroma and is quite tasty, with a touch of nutty yeast over a solid malt base. Mouthfeel is this lager's weak spot."
"Well I got this at my local place mixed and matched. It seems above the taste of a typical lager but not by much. Strictly picked for its interesting cover art."

"Pours a hazy deep orange-ish color with an off white head. In the aroma, little to no aroma whatsoever. In the taste, a small caramel like note, but really nothing at all. A small bite and a medium bodied mouthfeel, with a small dry caramel note in the aftertaste. Lack of flavor, and taste."
""
"Overall I really enjoyed the beer and hope to get my hands on more Keller beers in the future. This is a great recommendation to folks who like a sweeter beer or a wheat beer. Was great for after dinner sitting on the back porch in the summer night."
"In the taste, semi sweet flavors of euro malts, mild citrus hop, bread, and has a mild peppery character. Medium bodied, well carbonated texture. Overall this makes for a nice little Keller beer in the darker range of the style."
"Gonna guess this is old, no discernable dating on the bottle, I wouldn't buy this again unless I was in the country of origin, drinks alright at best"

"The taste was on the malty side and appeared one dimensional in flavour: I expected a lot more to be honest, thin and lacking in substance for a 5.2%ABV brew. The hops just didn’t show at all, no bite or crispness to the brew, I’m struggling to find anything nice to say about this beer, so I’ll curtail the review now!"

"O: Pretty good stuff, unlike the beers I usually find myself drinking."

"Yes, definitely bready. Oh-so smooth, wow...the yeast makes for great drinking here! It is great to have a yeasty German brew that is not a wheat beer. Pleasant grassy hops on the finish, refreshing yet full of flavor. Malts border on chocolate, but mostly stay in the caramel range. I am digging on this, I got this as a single, but will certainly pick up a sixer next time I am downtown."
"O- A so-so German brew. Never had this style, might seek out others but not Zeppelin."
"Kind of reminds me of Yuengling."
"Not a bad beer, but not very interesting."
"D: A solidly made, drinkable beer."
"Not a pleasant trip. Tasted like Coors Banquet with some better hops. I won't be ordering another of these any time soon."
"My first venture into the Keller Bier/Zwickel Bier category. I love it! It's like a Hefeweizen or Wit Bier on steroids."
"Kind of a ho hum beer all the way around. The mouthfeel is decent but nothing to write home about. The carbonation is weak making the beer slicker then I prefer. I say pass this one by if you see it."
"Conclusion: A very solid little beer. It tasted like a very refined lager, that is, it had a more softer polished finished compared to other lagers I've had. I enjoyed this one, it made me want to explore the Keller Bier/Zwickel Bier style"
"Atmosphere is pretty nice. Pretty nice rich look, and a thick tight head. Nose has a variety of grain tones. Nothing profound, but nicely balanced. Flavor, again, grain filled goodness. Overall, this is a really nice quaff."
"Thanks to wagenvolks for the extra! 11.2oz bottle into a DFH Signature glass pours a slightly hazy dark orange with a thin off white head that diminishes to a ring and leaves no lacing on the glass. Aroma is mild sweet malts, burnt caramel and brown sugar. The taste is an interesting blend of sweet malts and fruit with a nice kick of brown sugar in the finish. The beer is quite light and crisp with decent carbonation. This is a very interesting beer, one I'm glad I got the opportunity to try and would certainly have again."
"Lets face it, kellerbiers aren't the prettiest lagers of the bunch, but sometimes looks are overrated. Zeppelin is quite the tasty brew. Its a real lager in the raw. The rustic nature of this brew makes for an enjoyable quaff."
"Probably not quite as bad as I make it sound, but I can't really describe it any better either. (ie I will drink the other 5 bottles, but I will probably never buy this beer again)"
"The kellerbiers are interesting lagers that are a nice change of pace form the Helles or Dunkel. You could also replace an okto with this one."
"a cloud stale orange color. something between a hef and duklewiess really. nose is german lager yeast and a mild sour apple funk. mild floral sweet... sort of wheat malt and hop blend in odor. licorice... no banana though. palate is apple with a funky grit of something astringent acidic. a mild sweet... some pollen and clove. not smoky like an alt on the brink of herbal, unstable bitter funk, and germany body. great style. consistent example. nice body."
"Tastier than expected, that's for sure, Zeppelin packs on the flavor with lots of browned fruit flesh notes from the yeast. Hops taste zesty and alive on the palate, with a refreshing bite that lingers into the finish and suggests (mildly) pine and orange peel. Malts boast a superb balance of caramel and toffee sweetness. Again, very musty and organic. Mouthfeel is light-bodied, crisp and refreshing, but the carbonation is a bit too aggressive at times, leaving the tongue raw with effervescence. Overall, I found Zeppelin to be a pleasant surprise, and a damn tasty German import. Recommended."
"Not a bad beer, an interesting experience for a first time with this style."
"The beer pours a slightly hazy iced tea color with an off-white head. The aroma is grapes, wheat, grass and flowers. The flavor is a mix of wheat, grapes and flowers with a somewhat earthy finish. It almost resembles dirt. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
