3.81,3.3,3.75,4,3.75,3.75,3.75,"Pours a deep amber-orange color. It's somewhat hazy, maybe medium hazy, not that ""medium hazy"" really means anything to anyone besides me. The head is a touch yellow. It puffs up big and pretty thick but fades away after a minute, a bit like a hefe. The aroma is malty and pleasant. Nice doughy malt flavor with a touch of caramel. Reminds me of the Cismontane single malt beers that I've been working through. The taste has a good dose of malt sweetness, though it still finishes fairly clean with a very light grassy note. It's a relatively rich German lager. Less hoppy than expected. Smooth feel, full for the strength. Solid beer. Easy to drink and satisfying. Not terribly dramatic but the malt flavor is very nice.","popery","Jan 25, 2014"
3.25,-11.9,3.75,3.75,3,2.75,3.25,"The palate opens highly carbonated, lending a yeasty, frothy, mildly eggy flavor. The malt is dusty, doughy, mildly caramelized and mildly oxidized. The oxidized note is making me wonder if this is an old batch - that's quite possible, especially since it's been what, two years The Hunter was released? The mid-palate's flabby, mildly oxidized, dull and a little lifeless. Adding the yeast does improve the feel some, but this is still a disappointment. Medium light in body with an extremely high level of carbonation, this beer finishes mildly sweet with a faint hop bitterness. Gripes aside, the Munich malt character is awesome and thoroughly enjoyable.","DefenCorps","Beers"

2.73,-26,3,2.5,3,2,2.75,"Beer is medium-light in body, with carbonation of medium-high intensity, leading to a mouthfeel that is at first fizzy, gradually tapering to a fully foamy mouthfeel, a bit too carbonated for the beer and the style. Closes dry, with light to no stickiness clinging to the lips and palate.","falloutsnow","Oct 05, 2013"

3.81,3.3,3.75,4,3.75,3.75,3.75,"Poured into a Ayinger pint glass. Pours a medium golden amber with a half finger white head with good retention and slippery lacing. Aroma of bready and biscuit malt, noble hops with an interesting light dried herb component. Flavor is nicely balanced biscuit malt and light dry grassy and woody hops typical of German lagers. Light hop bitterness in the finish. Medium bodied. A nicely made classic, mellow helles lager.","LiquidAmber","Aug 15, 2013"

3.61,-2.2,4,3,4,3.5,3.5,"Gotta love the picture on the label. The bottle I got fizzed from hell to breakfast, so be prepared! It pours a rich and slightly hazy amber with a rather thick, if not too persistent, pale amber-tan head. Crisp aroma is fruity and malty with just a hint of hoppy wood. Flavor is typical of a lager, malty and a little fruity, but more mouth-filling and rounded out; again there is just a hint of hops. Texture has firm body and good fizz, better than with many lagers I have tried. If lager is your style, uncork this beast!","Cyberkedi","Oct 25, 2012"

4,8.4,4,4,4,4,4,"Bready and crisp, simple and seamless. Medium bodied with a light crisp bitterness that dries out quickly in the finish.

4.22,14.4,3.5,4,4.5,4.5,4,"O: This beer surprised me. I just bought it on a whim. I like Mahr's, and Mastodon (the band) is okay. So I thought, ""What the hell?"" Munich Helles is not a style that typically hits my beer g-spot, but this one really did the job on a hot, sunny summer day. Carefully crafted, very well done. Color me impressed.","ryan1788a5","Apr 27, 2012"
4.2,13.8,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Slightly sweet, this is a malty pale brew. It has a hop spice in the swallow and the short aftertaste. The malty flavor is dominate, but there is no grainy flavor. The body is like skim milk. The carbonation is low. The total effect makes this beer seem to have dried fruit.","smcolw","Apr 24, 2012"

3.86,4.6,4,3,4,5,4,"EDIT: Seems it really was a limited run. While listed as a kellerbier, if I had to categorize it I'd call it a Franconian Lagerbier...that just happens to be unfiltered, but not overly yeasty.","Domingo","Mar 28, 2012"

Light bodied. Bready malt, slight noble hop presence. Adding the yeast gives the aroma a bit of a yeasty tang. Decent German Lager.","homebrewhawk","0"
