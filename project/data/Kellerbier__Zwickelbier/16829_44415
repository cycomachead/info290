3.98,0.8,4,4,4,3.75,4,"Poured into a Fremont pint glass. Pours a rich medium to dark coppery amber with a two finger white head with great retention and lots of lacing. Aroma of biscuity, slightly toasted malt, hint of wheat and mild grassy hops. Flavor is slightly sweet biscuit, lightly bready malt and light grassy hops, nicely integrated. Medium bodied with nice peppery carbonation. Light flavored, but really pleasant malt profile and a deft amount of grassy hops. Lingering semi-sweet malt and hops finish. This was very enjoyable and could win me ovre to the idea of session beers. This would be quite nice to sit and sip for a long period of time on a warm day. There is a hint of oxidation in this, which is apparently why this style is rarely exported, meant to be drunk fresh. This was still very enjoyable and makes me want to try a fresh one.","LiquidAmber","Jun 02, 2014"

Smell is of malt, fruit, and grassy aromas. Taste is much the same with grain and grassy flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel.

The nose brings some bready grain and a slight touch of hops. Nothing too much there, but the malt presence is quite nice. Flavor falls along the same lines. The breadiness of it is quite nice.

4.2,6.3,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Served in a tall earthernware mug with a good half inch or so of creamy off-white head. While it is a pretty cool mug, it, makes the beer itself difficult to see. However, after the head subsided the beer revealed itself to a be a light copper color and just a little cloudy. The aroma was not strong, but it was appetizing. Light breads and yeast with just a hint of hops. Taste was similar with a some light caramel malts, lots of bread, light yeasty esters, and some very faint earthy hops. Light bodied with appropriate carbonation and a very mild bitterness. Very easy drinker. Paired well with a knockwurst.","Florida9","Feb 09, 2012"

Smell is of clean sweet malt, slight earthy and citric hops. Taste is of light sweet malts, very much in the German style. I also get a earthy citric hop bitterness as the beer crests the tongue. Mouthfeel is medium with playful carbonation. This is my first kellerbier/zwickelbier and I quite enjoy it!","gkunkle","Feb 04, 2012"

Bready, slightly caramelized malt flavors lead into a fruity mid-palate. There's a bit of husky, drying malt in the finish. Bitterness is mild and doesn't linger.
