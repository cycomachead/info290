"The Crack! was loud and I was excited to initiate an inverted Glug. My pour created a finger of dense, bone-white head with excellent retention. Color was Straw-Yellow (SRM = > 2, "

"Hazy gold.  Great clean lager nose; bready malts and gentle, floral hops.  Lightly sweet malts, floral hops, VERY solid bitterness.  Dry finish with a long, lingering bitterness in the aftertaste.  Crisp and light.  Awesome beer."

"Golden beer with a white head. Sweet taste with some lager skunk and little bread notes. The Saaz hops give it a hint of black pepper spice. After taste lingers but overall A nice light bodied mouthfeel. Slightly buttery feel. Overall I nice beer but nothing really stands out. Kellerbiers are a rarely seen style, taste similar to a helles lager."

"My first few impressions are very good. I can see this growing on me. The hop character reminds me of Hans Pils. I will be looking forward to having more. Well done."
