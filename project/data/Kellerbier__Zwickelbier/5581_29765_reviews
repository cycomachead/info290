"Plenty of malt flavor for style. Hop load leaves bitter and sweet in balance but contributes little to the flavor until the nutty aftertaste."

"A very clean beer that asks you to keep coming in for more. This is bit more bitter than I would prefer, but it's still amazing."
"Pretty dead compared to most I've tried on tap/cask. Some things you should seriously have fresh."

"O: $20 for 5 liters of an authentic unfiltered lager? yes please! I look forward to revisiting this soon."
"As I said, mouthfeel is smooth and modestly carbonated. Buy it!"

"O: A very delicious beer. I would rate it above Kaiserdom’s, but its very comparable. Would pair well with German fare, delicious in hot weather. Glad to find another beer in this style. Cool can."
"O - A pretty good depiction of the traditional style. I like the style, the bottle, and the freindly price point ($3.99 at my local shop). I'd have this again."

"Overall: this is a very interesting beer. Subtle but flavorful in its way, and I happen to really enjoy its aroma and texture. I feel like I could quaff liters of this stuff."

"O - Lacking a wealth of flavor but the simple bready composition makes this one enjoyable if you know what you are asking for. I had yet to have a beer of this style, thus my opinion may be skewed. I would get it again."
"Different take on the zwick’l style that goes for sweet honey over the richer maltier beers of the same style. Worth a try."
"Beer is medium to medium-light bodied, with low to low-medium amounts of carbonation. The mouthfeel is generally light, smooth, and slightly watery as a result. Closes out with a very dry finish."
"500 ml flip top bottle. Pours hazy golden-orange with a long lasting, tall, foamy, white head. Aroma is of grassy hops and bready malt. Body is medium and smooth. Bready malt, caramel, herbal, grassy hops and hints of honey fill the mouth. Finish is long and slightly sweet. Delicious session beer."

"Price Point - $2.99/500ML Swingtop bottle"
"Sampled from a Duvel Tulip. Just arrived in the store today, pours with a gorgeous tight just shy of white head settling into a nice finger-high collar that rests atop hazy deep gold liquid. Sweet malty/grassy nose. Malty and honeyish flavors. Thinnish mouthfeel...sweet finish. Nothing to write home about here...I'm just a sucker for those swing top bottles with the German language labels I suppose."

"O- An interesting beer, the highlight for me was definitely the aroma, which is amazing, it's very drinkable and would be perfect to drink outdoors in the summer."
"I'm really digging this one; I wasn't expecting much from this, but it's quite nice. I would definitely re-buy again."
"O: This beer isn’t as full-bodied compared to others in the style, but it is very flavorful and quite drinkable."
"2nd Kellerbier I've had, I thought it was pretty solid after mowing the lawn."
"Funky sourness comes and goes, with an almost kombucha-like ""aliveness""."
"Slightly musty aroma of minerals and apple. Later it's all shortbread and sweet sticky malt. Flavors are similar, it has a fairly smooth and hefty feel to it once the yeast was poured. Lingering bready aftertaste, primary flavors of apple, fresh yeasty bread, and dry hay. It has a bit more character than your average German lager, but it's pretty sweet and slick feeling over time. Ok to try and compare to others of the style, likely not a repeat buy for me personally."
"5l minikeg. It is a hazy orangeish gold with a large, foamy white head. The smell is light and grainy. The flavor is sweet and bready but with a nice touch of noble hops in the back. Not bitter but the hops are noticeable. I was surprised by this particular one."
"Tastes like it smells, only with a really nice, smooth, surprisingly hoppy back end that brings everything together like vanilla ice cream. Big nodes of bread and honey mix with the aforementioned weird nodes. It *is* old, but the age doesn't impart any bad flavors so much as it disrupts the balance."
"O=Not terrible, very, very drinkable. Id have it again, but its not high up on my shopping list"
"My father-in-law bought a minny barrel of this at Beers of the World for us to drink on.Poured a hazed straw color with a frothy one finger white head,very low carbonation wich was expected.Light aromas of toasted grain and mineral,not much presence.Lighter mouthfeel but that to was expected.Grainy with the before mentioned iron-like taste,it goes down so easy its crazy.I liked this beer,light but not wimpy,incredibly food fiendly."
"Overall, I'm glad I gave this beer a try, but I won't be buying another."
"A fairly nice beer. Based on some of the other reviews, I think most are not reviewed to style, or the reviewer got an old beer. Mine is nice and fresh and a fairly decent representation of the style- if not world class. Pours a slightly cloudy dark straw color with a fairly thin white head that leaves somne sloppy lacing. Clean aromas of fresh hay and soft yeasty notes with just a touch of fresh baked honeyed bread. The taste is pretty similar with a rounded fresh bread flavor lightly pierced through with some subtle noble hops. Fresh like this it is quite addictive! Very easy to approach, but with that extra something that keeps drawing you back. Very pleasant and a pleasure to find this at my local bottle shop."
"This swing top bottle pours a pretty clear, pale golden yellow with a one finger soft soapy white head. The aromas are solely of sweet pale malts and light honey. It definitely smells like a light lager. The flavors are of sweet pale malts and light honey. It's pretty heavy grains. It also has an ever so light bitterness. It's very light and doesn't offer any complexity whatsoever, but it's not bad and decently drinkable. It drinks fine and smooth. I can see this style being popular in the summer but I wouldn't want to drink it all the time. It's just ok."
"Tried this at the Split Rock Beer Fest on 11-21-10. They had a bunch of the Veldensteiner bottles there and I knew that I'd never tried any of them so I made sure to get them all under my belt. This beer turned out to have some really pleasent aromas on the nose. The flavors were on the weaker side, due to the style of course. I wouldn't seek this beer out just for the hell of it. It was a good sample but thats about all for me."
"This was a new addition at my local beer store, figured I'd try it for $3.49 a bottle. 500 ml swing top bottle. Served in a mug, the beer pours a hazy dark gold color with about an inch frothy off-white head. The head retention is good, and there's a lot of lacing left on the glass. Aroma is a bit weak but mostly sweet, it smells like grain, some honey and a bit of grassy hops. Luckily, the taste is stronger than the aroma. The brew tastes like sweet malt, grassy and herbal hops, caramel malt and some bread/grain. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, it's a bit slick and is well carbonated. Drinkability is decent, it's not hard to drink this brew at all. Not a bad beer, I think it's worth a try."
"drinkability; a very light, yet not boring drink, crisp and refreshing to say the least....good stuff!"
"Mouthfeel is very smooth and velvety, it just glides down the gullet. I like this, and could definitely drink a lot of it."
"Supremely drinkable, this is a fine beer. Complex, but enjoyable. It's easy to drink, but it has the interest to keep you coming back. Wonderful."
"D: The smell!"
