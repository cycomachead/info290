"A crisp and refreshing beer with a yeast driven flavors and moderate, spicy hops character."
""
"great"
"O-One of the few NG beers I did not care for."
"It's a well-made basic lager with some bready/yeasty character.  It's on the sweet side.  Nice."

"Brilliant clarity, nice white head. Not familiar with the style. Fairly grainy aroma, flavor is grainy and bready, refreshing, with a minerally, clean finish. Nothing spectacular, but would be a great session beer in a hot day. Crisp, dry finish, with a touch of earthy hop."
""
""
""
"Overall: this beer is fantastic. I love it, there are no flaws and there is nothing aggressive. It's perfect for me on hot days."

"Cracked open after a hot bike ride home from the office. The aroma is a simple doughy barley with a hint of toast and caramel and the slightest earthy mineral touch that carries over into the flavor with the malts. The body is smooth and balanced with a touch of sweetness. It reminds me more of a low-hop Czech lager, or a lighter Dortmund Export lager than a kellerbier, but it's a damn fine beer to have at the end of the day. I'd drink more if I had one, but I don't get to Sconie that often."

"Easy drinking lager that remains flavorful and clean, without the twang of a macro. Light fruits balanced by some noble hop hints."
""
""
""
""
"O - New Glarus takes the classic characteristics of a German lager with Bavarian hops and Wisconsin malts to make Yokel, an unassuming, unfiltered lager that's flavorful but easy drinking. So, you want classic Wisconsin? As they say, ""Buy Local, Drink Yokel""."
""
""
""
"update: still a good, drinkable brew, but during the second sixer the sourdough thing started getting way too one-dimensional and less pleasant (even though I was mixing things up during the period they were tossed back and alternating styles)."
""
""
"Overall: A pretty solid take on a traditional European light lager. Nice bready malt taste with some good subtle hop notes."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The beer appears crystal clear and bright golden with a thick, soapy white head. Aromas include sourdough bread, lager yeast, apple, lemon. Lots of bread and yeast character packed into a low abv beer. Thin body with moderately low carbonation. Easy drinking and smooth. Lingering flavors of bread dough and yeast. A hint of floral hops and a general earthy quality. A solid example of the style."
""
""
"Overall: Another magnificent New Glarus beer. A great craft lager that is stylistically right-on- the malts are the main draw here with just a hint of hoppiness. The beer is easy drinking and I highly recommend it for craft lager lovers."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Tasted like a cross between a lager and a cream ale with a bit of a bite to it. The bite could be from bittering hops or a certain type of yeast. I'm not exactly up to speed on this style. It was very quenching to drink. It was complex/interesting while also being a sessionable beer. I'd get this again especially at the price point."
""
""
"O. Decent enough stuff but not one of NG's better lagers. Actually glad I only grabbed a single and not a 6-pack."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: While this beer is ""clean," it's almost as if it is too clean for the style. The label says it is unfiltered, but its damn near crystal clear. This is just not a very exciting beer for me. I personally couldn't even say this would make a decent everyday drinker as I just wouldn't want to drink it regularly."
""

"This pours a clear, amber color with a slight head. The aroma is bold with barley and slight bit of hops. The taste is smooth and crisp with a very grainy flavor. This is a very unique grain beer that drinks like a pilsner but leaves a different lingering flavor. This is a unique style you don’t see very often so it may not appeal to everyone but it is sure worth a try."
""
""
""
"Overall: Another great sesssion beer by New Glarus. Nothing mindblowing here, but its definately a great everyday beer. Perfect beer for a hot day as well. I dont think that this beer does a really good job of following the guidlines of the beer style very well(according to the short paragraph found on this site), but this is only the 2nd Kellerbier / Zwickelbier that I have tried. So take that for what its worth."
""
"The aroma is weak and the flavor profile is about as plain and simplistic as microbrews come. It has New Glarus's Spotted Cow profile. To me, it's just another Sweet/Sour offering from New Glarus; a company more interested in appealing to the lowest common denominator than brewing for enthusiasts. As a new Wisconsinite, I've tried so many of their offerings and have been continually disappointed."
""
"O - A simple session lager from New Glarus. Not their best, but tasty."
"O -- I was expecting a lot more from this beer and admit I'm a little disappointed. It's certainly an easy drinking beer for the season with no big flaws to steer anyone away, but overall it's rather lackluster -- especially for a beer that's supposed to be bringing some carry-over from the brewing ingredients in the weight of residual ingredients not filtered (or settled) away. I'm giving it slightly better than okay in ""Overall"" because it's smoother and a step better in flavor than the usual macro brew."
"Overall: What else would you expect from New Glarus. This is a masterfully executed lager that delivers exactly what it promises. Clean and potent hop profile shines so bright. NG continues to show their mastery of executing any style of beer."

"Simply stunning. Absolutely perfect."
""
"O- An absurdly easy-drinking lager, and definitely feels like less than 4.2%. Really, really good stuff. I'm not surprised at all that this one came from New Glarus."

"hay color with a small cap of white that seriously stayed for about a few seconds with no visible carbonation. aroma is earthy, musky grain, touches of light grass, but really rather bland and without much in the way of any depth, light feel, watery at times without any really big flavors or huge noticeable chnage from the smell. clean finish"
""
"The beer pours a hazy golden color with a nice billowy white head and lots of tiny bubbles rising out of the bottom of the glass. Aroma is largely yeasty with a graininess, a good graininess, and some breadiness/ The aroma is simple, beautiful well nuanced and entirely different from almost every beer I have ever had. I love the flavor of this, it starts off with that dry baguette like character that is sometimes found in a fine biere de garde. The flavor is wonderfully complex, with lemon, crisp nicely bitter noble hops, some corn (and for the first time in my life, not in a bad way), some honey, a light spiciness, and a light floral character. Unbelievably drinkable, ask a bartender at the Glarner Stube, they'll tell you how many of these a good customer can throw back."
"Pours a bright golden amber color with a a hefty thick white head. Aromas of toasty malts, dough, slight floral notes. On the palate, thin body, easy to drink, with flavors toasty malts, sweet dough and vaguely bitter hops. Not impressed."
"Tasty keller bier/zwickel bier. This is my first of the style to my knowledge and I believe I have one more Yokel in the fridge! This would best served on a warm day in my mind."
"D: Meh. Didn't care for it."
"Light bodied with low carbonation. A nice, easy to drink beer which is complex for 4.2% abv. Too bad this is being retired. Maybe I will be able to find a few more bottles on my next trip to Hudson."
"Simple, uncomplicated, and good. Well made."
"Bring shared a bottle of this a while back. Thank you, Barry. Being a big kellerbier fan, I was excited to try this. Hazy but relatively clear golden body with a finger of white foam, signature kellerbier appearance. Bready, yeasty, lighty malty sweetness hits the nose first. Spice, white pepper, light stonefruit; complex. Up front fruitiness on the palate, sweet pale malt, faintly yeasty, peppery spice, slight and pleasant buttery slickness. Finishes dry with a touch of noble hops. Very clean finish. This reminded me a bit of the Bohemian Lager NG made a couple years back, though it's not quite as outstanding."
"12 ounce bottle poured into a pint glass. Hazy opaque goldenrod color with a medium off-white head. Aroma is pale malts and a very light fruitiness. Almost has me believing there's some wheat in here. Flavor is pilsener perfection. This is exactly the malt profile I want in a pilsener. Some taste like corn, some taste like cereal grains, some taste like pure pale malt, but this tastes like fresh bread, with a light honeyed character giving it some sweetness. Again I'm detecting a mild pithy banana note in there that points to wheat, but maybe it's just some sort of yeasty note? A little grassiness on the finish, which is super crisp. Reminds me of Reality Czeck to an extent, but more traditional (i.e. not hopped to delicious oblivion). Dry and very refreshing. Not too thin and not at all fizzy. Just sublime. I would love to have this stuff around in the summer."
"This beer is fantastic! Its a real shame its no longer available. I am happy to have had the chance to drink it though. Drinkability is phenomenal."
"Drink OH yeah this is a beer to drink by the case. I sure hope they bring it back and soon."
"D - Pretty easy to get down and do a few of."
"Thanks to oach for this one!"
"Pours a nice cloudy pale yellow color, nice carbonation, nice one-finger plus white head, with lots of nice sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, with slight yeast note, alittle spice. The taste is sweet, malty, yeasty, with some spice notes. Medium body. Drinkable, really liking this one."
"Overall, started off ok, then fades to terribleness."
"M/D - Another good brew from New Glarus! Medium bodied well balanced brew! Smooth on the tongue with a no real hop bite or aftertaste. A real enjoyable session brew but now that it is retired I'm for sure glad that I tried it."
"Overall, this is a pretty nice session beer. Easy drinking with lots of flavors. I am glad I got to try this one from New Glarus. I could easily drink another."
"D - This brews drinkability is very high. It reminds me of a great Summer brew...hell, it's Winter here and I'm enjoying it immensely! Low ABV and great taste combine for a beer I would be proud to stock in my fridge. Highly recommended."
" M- This beer has a medium mouthfeel with no alcohol noted. D- This beer has a light tartness and orange flavor that is a bit unique together but not bad. Otherwise it is a very clean flavor and a bit dull to drink more than one at a time."
"The carbonation is at an upper moderate level, and the beer is slightly crisp and moderately dry. Another great beer from New Glarus."
"Slightly cloudy golden yellow body. Small, gauzy, eggshell-white head. Yeasty bread, honeyed malts, and minty, herbal, noble hops on the nose. Sourdough bread and lightly toasted malts up front. Honey-drizzled biscuits and light apple sweetness. Spicy, peppery, vegetal hop bitterness. Moderate body with a crisp feel. Nice flavor and complexity for such a light lager. Deliciously thirst-quenching."
"Pours hazy, cloudy pale gold/yellow color. Thin head goes away quickly after pouring. Nice clean grassy, floral bready smell. Very clean and balanced flavor. Some grainy rye bread notes, plenty of sweet malts, some fruity prune or rasin maybe? Not overly bitter, but plenty of lively, spicy hops come into the mix. Perfectly balanced flavors. Bottom line good beer. Very smooth and exceptionally drinkable. I don't know anything about this style. If they are all as good as this, I wil have to find some more."
"pours a hazy yellow /gold color with a fluffy but quickly dissipating head that settles with a very nice ring and some sticky lacing..the smell is hops and grass and dough with a malty german influence and again their is a bread and yeast taste that is just delicious with a very fresh crisp scent..the taste is great its crisp with a perfect balance of hops and malt..just perfect for the style..this is another fine NG brew that is highly flavorful highly drinkable ,highly recommended..glad i have access to all of NG brews..a fine brewery"
"D-My mom brought me this back straight from the brewery and I live in Illinois. Its a damn shame they dont distribute outside of WI. If they did I would have the fridge stocked full of this"
"Pours a hazy gold body with a white head the quickly falls. Aroma is of citrus and grape skin. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a low to medium carbonation level that makes this beer smooth. Flavor is a light malt sweetness with a very mild bitterness. Excellent for a session beer."
"Pours bright gold with a weak white head that fades quickly. Tons of bubbles flowing. Smells of very pale malt. Very smooth malt with just a bit of German hop taste, ends very bitter on the finish. The mouthfeel is smooth with a good amount of carbonation. Very drinkable and very enjoyable."
"Pours a bright gold with a very nice white head and loads of lacing as it goes down. Pilsner malt with a good deal of sweetness, and plenty of European hops. The sweetness is just perfect--nothing too much, but it's certainly there. Mouthfeel is light to medium with good carbonation. Drinkability is excellent; one of my favorite New Glarus beers, and perhaps my favorite that doesn't have fruit in it."
"D: wow. Very nice, very drinkable. Way better than totally naked."
"D - Very high. I barely even realized I was drinking it, and then it was gone."
"Drinkability - I like New Glarus, but not all of their beers are must haves. This one I can do with or without. Apparently an unusual style, so kudos for helping keep it alive."
"Bottled poured into taster. Cloudy golden yellow with small but fairly tight head no lacing. Aroma is minimal - smells fresh taste is not much up front some maltiness with a nice hop balance hitting the top and back of throat - good balance. Creamy mouthfeel. Very delicious and low abv make very drinkable - great for summer - i'd say."
"Mouthfeel is nice and classic - medium-light body, juicy around the edges, drying out towards the clean finish, with a light but sturdy carbonation. Drinkability is pretty damn close to perfect - fantastic session beer."
"Notes: My only complaint is that I have only one bottle. And that the label designates the beer perfect for ""washing down a burger"" when it's so much more. Well done yet again, Dan"
"Golden clear yellow with a nice light head that just keeps through the whole beer pretty much. The classic lager smell with traces of a smell that mostly reminds me of a farmhouse ale. Nice citrusy hop tone. Very smooth and as has been said before it does have a slightly dry aftertaste to it. Its a delicious beer and I can kind of see why its in the yearly line up. Good show!"
"drinkability is good. nice balance. simple and uncomplicated. a nice keller/zwickel that i think i could drink all day. good stuff."
"This is one I could drink by the case if I had the chance. Balances both malt and hops, but leans a little bit toward the malty side. Exceptionally drinkable."
"Nice stuff here from New Glarus. Crisp, tasty, thirst-quenching, and low ABV. What more could you ask for in a lighter Lager?"
"D- It is a great lightish beer (I prefer dark and heavy) to be enjoyed with a meal."
"I'm happy to see New Glarus bring Yokel back. I could never get my fill of it when it was brewed in the past and I was sad to see it go. The comeback has been a good one."
"The beer is a cloudy pale yellow as it's sits in my pint glass. At least an inch of thick white head. After the head retreats not much lacing is left behind. The aroma is sweet grain and yeast. It's not a strong smelling beer by any stretch. i really had to get my nose in there to pick up any aroma. The flavor is delicious. Yeasty and bread like. A hint of fruit, but mostly wheat crackers is what I pick up. The finish is very dry. Medium to light body with a mild carbonation. A very drinkable and refreshing beer from NG. I'm not real familiar with the style but, I would have to say I'm a fan if this is what it's supposed to taste like."
"This was definitely a good beer but it is not a seasonal release that I would take the time to hunt down. Just a nice, well crafted casual drinking beer."
"Light and refreshing, a decent complexity of flavors considering the light body. A beer I look forward to every year! Good, clean flavors and awesome sessionability."
"Pours a clear yellow amber, medium sized white head forms, drops down to a thick ring, chunks of lace stick to the glass, looks good. Smell is nice, very fresh and grassy, hay, honey, biscuit, wheat, very malty, light bit of citrus and floral, not bad. Taste is similar, grassy hops, some caramel and biscuit, wheat, floral, very malty, nicely light and crisp finish, very malty. Mouthfeel is light bodied with low to medium carbonation, balanced and a nice hop character. Not too exciting but pretty drinkable."
"I wasn't sure what to expect from this beer but I was impressed with the flavor despite the light bodied beer. I would steer clear from this beer during cold months but right now in the summer time this beer is great. Definitely not my favorite from New Glarus, and definitely not the worst. Overall I was pleasantly surprised."
"Mildly foggy gold. Thick white head. Thick flavor. Defined sweetness. Biting citrus, yet no acidity. Very thick carbonation. Nice enough but it's a bit too thick in flavor and carbonation to make it as easy drinking as this style could be. Still a nice attempt though."
"(D)- Yokel is a solid beer with silky smooth attributes. Great for summer down by the beach. A 6pk wouldnt last long at all. Seek this one out if you are looking for some lighter fare."
"D: Wow. This is the best sub 5%abv I have ever had. This beer is what my idea of a good ""lager"" should be. I have had other Keller/Zwickles before, but, this is the best. Superb session beer, I can see myself drinking these like I used to drink Budweiser 25 years ago...One after another!"
"This is a good choice for a session beer, but it just isn't my cup of tea."
"drinkability is solid. very fresh and flavorful on the palate with a lasting lager character. the brew itself is well put together and supremely drinkable. cheers!"
"(edit) Do youself a favor and let this beer warm above cellar temp bfore drinking, you will be rewarded."
"Yokel is likely what Bud and Miller tasted like before they were watered-down by corporate compromises and dishonest brewing methods. Or maybe not. In any case, this is a beer of great integrity and is stupidly drinkable. One of the best (golden/pale) lagers I've ever had."
"The mouthfeel is good with a nice creamy kind of feel. Carbonation provides a nice perky zip. Very drinkable and refreshing. Sad to say, it's my last one."
"Thanks to esjaygee (from the other site), for the opportunity"
"Upon consumption, all I can say is ""Wow."" New Glarus knows how to take the most hum-drum styles (e.g. Keller Bier) and craft a phenomenal beverage out of the guidelines that define them. Yokel is no exception, with its tasty notes of butter squash, zesty yeast spize, clover honey, and a ton of German hops. Mouthfeel is light, with a peppery body and carbonation level. Cheers to Wisconsin for making a Lager that's both flavorable, complex, and exceedingly drinkable."
"Pours golden with a big lasting white head in a lager glass. Lots of carbonation streaming up in this one. Smell is fresh bright, lemony malt and a touch of yeastiness. Taste is lemony malt and yeast. A bit thin and slightly tangy. Decent and drinkable, but not too out of the ordinary for a lager style beer."
"Pours a lovely hazy, golden-honey color, with two fingers worth of foam. Head retention is short-lived and leaves little lacing. Smell is super sweet, grainy, and yeasty. Slightly sweet in taste, mostly malty, slightly bitter in the background, grainy and a dry yeast finish. It's not profoundly complex by any means, but lives up to the style. Good carbonation, nice mouthfeel, very smooth and easy to drink. A great lager, and I only wish that Budweiser tasted this good!"
"The smell is very malty, with lots of bread character. Tons of pale malt, with bits of yeast and biscuit in there. The taste is malty up front. Lots of pale malt dominate. There's more bready characteristics coming through, with a slightly hoppy finish. A touch of lemon as well. The mouth is nice and strong for an unfiltered lager. The drinkability is great"
"D: Low abv, solid taste and a twist. What more does one need? I wish I had another bottle to enjoy."
"D: I don't really know whats going on with this style of beer, but it lacked a lot of flavor. very interesting, but not something I will drink again."
"i like zwickel bier, detroit dwarf, is one of my favorites. this is good example."
"3.5 Not a bad beer, a little bit dull, but worth a try. Thanks to Deuane for the sample."
"Overall: I am not a huge lager fan, as I love my ales. That being said this one is rather enjoyable. Leave it to New Glarus, they seem to do it all right."
"Taste is full of juicy apples, pears, and a bit of banana. Light zippy pepperiness on the palate, nutty malt character. Light flavoured but so well crafted. Clean flavours and nice balance. Nice lively carbonation on the tongue, light body, but not too light. Starts out juicy but finishes dry enough to keep you coming back for more. Wow. This would be an amazing summer brew, and I'm so happy to be drinking this now, even in February."
" ~ I will certainly have this beer again, and I will certainly recommend it to my friends."
"Yet annother one of those forgotten styles that shouldn't be missed. A must try if you like weiss biers."
"D - Good beer. This has a little too much carbonation, still a good beer."
"D= I would not mind having one every now and then, but could not see myself sitting down with a six pack and drinking it. It seems very carbonated making me feel full and burpy."
"The drinkability to me was ruined by the huge amount of chunky sediment."
"Big white head leaving a trail of lace in its wake tops off a slightly-hazy golden-yellow body. Bready malt on the nose, floral hops and lemony zest. Grainy malt taste, nice floral hop complement. Hints of spice. Medium to full mouth, pretty creamy feel. Quite refreshing. Not a bad brew at all."
"Frosted honey with a billowing snow white head. Several furiously driving streams of carbonation. Gentle aromas of flowers, fresh berries, and yeast. Juicy, but soft and understated melon and strawberry flavors abound with light toasted bread notes bringing up the back end. Ever so slight yeast spiciness makes the flavor quite special. Lively but restrained mouthfeel, light body, and incredibly refreshing. I most certainly want more. A fantastic session lager to be sure. Many thanks to BeerTruth for the opportunity."
"Pours a cloudy straw color with a huge fluffy white three finger head that slowly dies down to a nice layer that lasts. Stickiness is pretty good, spotty here and there. Smell is a sweet lemongrass, noble hops, and some yeasty notes. Very crisp and clean on the nose. Taste is a sweet bread like flavor with some grain as well. Very refreshing beer, definitely one I could enjoy during the summer. Aftertaste is somewhat candy like and enjoyable. Light bodied with a good amount of carbonation. Very interesting beer and goes down very well. I could see one leading to another, and then another...etc. Another beer that proves New Glarus knows what they're doing."
"Pours a cloudy honey color with a large fluffy head that dissipates quickly to a ring. No lacing of any kind. I get the aroma of malt, bread, and citrus. No hops to speak of but it has a fruity, malty taste. Light to medium body with decent carbonation that makes this very easy to drink. Seems out of season drinking it in the fall. A nice alternative to the witbiers of summer."
"Overall- It was good, not great. A good warm weather drinker."
"corn lager."
"This'd be a great beer to have at the game or with barbeque."
"This beer caught my eye with the slogan ""Support the locals drink Yokel"". Poured into a pint glass this beer had a nice golden color that was a little cloudy (because of the unfiltered nature I assume, allowing the yeast to continue working in the bottle). It has a decent light cream colored head with nice lacing. The smell is a little sweet, but not over powering. This beer has a nice malt tasted that is medium bodied. After doing some yard work it was nice and refreshing. This beer had a nice smooth taste and coming from New Glarus I will support the WI locals and buy a few more Yokels!"
"Light, easy to take down, but not exactly special."
"overall, I really enjoyed this beer, very refreshing, had with bbq'd chicken very good"
"Light apple tartness, crackery pale malt, with mild grain huskiness. Dry aftertaste, with uber-mild herbal hops. Very smooth and creamy due to the yeast content, and light-bodied. The creaminess reminds me of peanut butter in the texture somehow. Very solid summertime choice, or when you want something lighter for a session."
"Originally reviewed April 2, 2007. 12 Oz Bottle. Spritzy bar room lemon and pretzel aroma. Classic pilsner aroma, with crisp tangy sweet malt and wafting lemon hop character. Delicious. A little bit of grain, barnyard hay, and wheat creep in. Yeast chunk pour (maybe I shouldnt) of clear yellow. Soapy white head, fading fast. Flavor is a medium-bodied, yet fulfilling middle malt with a nip of corn husk and a long, clean malt ride. Not much depth or nuance, but fairly cleanly, drinkable and bright. Why have Totally Naked when you have this? At least this maintains a few apple notes and light grain flavor in the face of lightness. A little too empty and not worthy of swilling to me."
"d::: Goes down easily, but it's not exactly a light beer. Probably the most sessionable beer I've had from NG."
"Drinkability - Very easy to drink. Went with the cookout foods nicely."
"D - A quality drinkable session beer that is to be enjoyed on a nice summer day. Really this is one of those beers you always want to have around. Its not overly complex and not a world classic. But is damn good and very drinkable."
"D: Very drinkable."
"This is an interesting unfiltered light beer. I believe that this is a decendent of their old Zwickel beer. This is a little friendlier - more rounded corners, not quite as bitter from the yeast nor tart. Nice head with plenty of lace. Good carbonation. On the crisp side (although this serving is perhaps a tad too cold - tho I'm not complainin). Nice medium to light amber color. Nose what you'd expect from this style o beer - lightly pungent. Drinkable. Thirst quenching."
"This is a nice drinking lager that is gone before you know it. It's nothing exciting but I wouldn't expect it to be. If you live in the small area where it's available, it will make a good, staple beer."
"A New Glarus Spotted Cow pint glass came with the six pack, a nice touch, which included the name of the liquor store where purchased on the other side. Gotta like free glasses, and great beer!"
"D - This is a very good beer. It is very easy drinking and tastes great."
"Bottle courtesy of Monger: Poured a cloudy golden yellow color beer with a large foamy head with perfect retention. Aroma of floral malt with some spicy yeast notes is quite enjoyable. Taste is dominated by some nice floral notes and semi-sweet malt presence. Yeast is also noticeable and provides a spicy aspect to the beer with some crisp hops at the end. Body is full with limited filtration and great carbonation. I had this yesterday after a long hot and humid summer days so I might be slightly overrating this one but I still think it shows that great lager can be brewed as opposed to the crappy ones that flood the market."
"ok to start things off this is a new style to me but it is a good style in my opinion. upon pouring swirling and pouring again the beer was most cloudy and looked like a nice hefe but on with it i supose smelled like beer nothing special there taste was not what i was expecting but then again i did not know what to expect deffinatly a drink able beer i would buy it agian i would say it is a must try."
"This is brilliant beer."
"Yokel is my favorite everyday beer from New Glarus. Obviously the ""Enigma"" or one of the other ""unplugged"" beers would top it overall, but as a ""regular"" beer, it's a pretty decent quaffer. It just suits my taste; and I wish they had this at the UW rathskellar so I could sit by the lake and enjoy a few with my girlfriend as the sun went down. Anyway, It's golden (and I certainly don't mind the haze from the yeast) with a frothy dollop of bright white foam atop. The head retention is quite good and it leaves nice lace. The nose is malty and just slightly hoppy - I could use some more hops, but at least it's not overly hopped. It's smooth and lightly creamy in the mouth, and sweetish in the flavor with a nice, fresh maltiness and some spicy and floral hops - even a touch citrusy in the background. It's very much like the Spotted Cow, but less sweet and with more character. It's easy drinking, tasty, and refreshing, what more could you ask?"
"Um, like this is unholy drinkable by the super tall pint man. Wow, a nice refreshing little Zwickel by New Glarus that'll be sure to Yokel its way off the shelves in the warmer weathered months without much effort."
"Overall: a quality session beer. Very drinkable with quality but light flavors. I was impress with how they got the lemon zest to stick around so well, and that giant head was quite impressive."
"Drinkability - a fine session beer and a good experience as my first of this style. Thanks to jj21 for helping me to acquire this one."
"D - Overall, the taste is about all there is to love about about this beer, unless you like a ton of sediment shit floating in your beer. It does taste very good though."
"Good drinkability. Solid beer."
"The body is fairly creamy with a very light carbonation. Easily quaffable. Leaves only a hint of an aftertaste. This would make for a nice session lager. I wasn't expecting to like it based on the description given to me by the person who provided the bottle, but then again, I tend to be much more open to the lesser appreciated styles, particularly lagers. It's not mind blowing or complex, but it is very easy to drink, doesn't offend, and it's very well crafted, particularly considering how rare of a style kellerbier seems to be. I don't always need to be beaten over the head with a ton of hops and specialty malt in order to sit back and enjoy what I'm drinking."
"Good beer. Appearance didn't do much for me, but seems appropriate for style. Easy to drink and nicely balanced."
"Softly creamy mouth feel."
"I considered the possibility that this bottle might be very old, but the store I purchased it from is a new store, only being open for about two months. I suppose there is the possibility that this bottle sat at the distributor for a long time, but because New Glarus does not put packaging dates on their bottles (BOOOO New Glarus!), I can't say for sure. More and more I'm of the opinion that if a beer isn't date stamped, its brewer deserves any bad reviews received for old beer."
"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a pint glass a hazy, pale yellow with an inch of white head. Aromas of grassy hay , citrus hops, sweet smelling malts. Tastes sweet and clean, not too bitter, creamy and refreshing in the mouth. A very well done beer from New Glarus. Wish I had more than one on hand."
"This would be ok to drink in the Spring/Summer as a thirst quencher or could even be consumed in the Fall/Winter as a quaffer."
"I think this will be my new gateway beer for craft beer recruits. It'll remind them of their BMC, but its way better, and so easy to drink. It doesn't call you out like some exotic brew, it calls you back like your good buddy would. 'Hey bro, come over and have a brew.' 'Definitely.'"
"Thanks to bschmid for GIVING me this beer along with numerous other New Glarus stuff as a gift."
"Thanks to kmpitz2 for the taste."
"Yokel (noun): a rustic; a country bumpkin. Yokel is definitely rustic, but it sure as hell ain't no bumpkin. It's a classy kellerbier with a polite nature and polished manners. It's also a very good malt-dominant lager that revels in its simplicity and its drinkability. Kudos to the good folks at New Glarus for yet another well-crafted beer."
"Hazy straw (from suspended yeast), yeasty nose. Medium-light body with toasted yeas notes and beautiful malt flavor. Finishes with a low hop flavor, possible a domestic version of a noble hop. Best of the three I tasted today - but we don't get many decent lagers out west."
"Based on the Zwickel characterization on BA, I expected more hop bitterness than I found. Yokel has a clean taste that I can only describe as delicately tasty -- delicate hops, delicate malt. Easy to enjoy."
"This is the first of this style I have ever had and I have to say that it is one I will be investigating. This is delicious. Yokel would be a wonderful way to fill out an entire warm saturday afternoon into evening."
"This beer pours a cloudy pale golden color with a lot of visible yeast particles. The head is two-fingers in height, but recedes rather quickly into decent lacing. The aroma is very faint with a mild malt character and not much else. The taste like the aroma, very faint. The aftertast, however, is quite pleasant with a nice spearmint taste. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with nice carbonation. Overall, this is a decent beer, but nothing to wrtie home about. I would drink it again, I might even buy it again, but I certainly would not go out of my way to find it again."
"It's easy to drink. Inviting. Crisp and smooth. Not my favorite. Too sweet for me."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1"" creamy off-white head over the slightly cloudy warm golden brew. Head fades slowly, with heavy coating lacing. Aroma is minimal, for better or worse. Flavor has rich pale grains upfront, with a light fruitiness and balancing hops. Mouthfeel is super-smooth, and drinkability is as easy as the label indicates, what with its cards/jukebox/pool rambling. Wish I could add it to my local selections."
"Drinkability: This is the realy subjective category to me. Everything else is as compared to a style, but this is really a personal comment on the beer. Have to say I like it a lot, and I normally wouldn't consider myself a light lager drinker. Give it a try, this isn't a BMC."
"This beer is insanely easy to drink. I think this is one of the few beers that both the uber-beer geeks and the complete beer ignorant can love. It is both very complex and extremely simple at the same time. I often wonder if Kellerbier gets over looked by most BAs. Oh well, enough of my ramblings. I found this to be a lovely little beer. Thank you hoffman! This was a treat."
"Pours straw to gold in color with a slight cloudiness, a small white head fades back quickly. Smell is of slightly sweet malts, cooked grains, and sweet straw and grass. Taste is similar with sweet grainy flavors, uncooked corn on the cob. There is a little peppery crispness and a very small amount of dryness in the finish as well as a lemony flavor in the background. Fairly easy to drink, but probably not something I would go back for more of."
"Very good beer - especially when you can get it fresh in the summer."
"Mouthfeel is smooth with plenty of carbonation. This is a sturdy, refreshing lager that doesn't wind up lacking in body. A definite easy drinker that would make a good session brew. I could see myself grabbing this again when I'm looking for something lighter and easy to drink."
"d - fairly drinkable beer, alcohol not evident, dry finish may limit consumption though"
"It's next to me, a beautiful hazy straw color. Very little hops in the aroma--all malt with the distinctive lager smell. There is just the slightest ring of foam around the glass. It tastes clean, crisp, very slightly of wheat. There is the slight sting of carbonation but not unpleasant by any means. I would love to have a couple of these on a nice summer day."
"I think this beer would make a good session beer. It is not too high in alcohol. Also, the flavor is very mild and non aggressive. If you can handle the taste, this beer is for you."
"Drinkability- All-in-all a decent brew. Tasted good on a hot day. Possibly the first for me of this style. Thanks John."
"You would never believe this was a lager if it didn't say so on the label. Very flavorful without being overpowering in any way. A very good beer for a hot summer day."
"Thanks to thefatkid13 for this one in a trade. The beer poured a hazy orange color into a tulip glass, with a slight white head. The nose of this beer was not very strong with any one character but has some hints of banana, maybe some spices. I didn't get much. The taste was also not that complex. There is a good balance between malts and hops that makes for a pretty drinkable beer, although not overly complex. Worth a try."
"The taste is a bit of lemon-citrus and honey. This beer is drinkable and light to medium bodied. There is a good amount of carbonation that is easily detectable. I do not detect much in the way of hops. This one is different and not a bad drink."
"-UF"
"This is an incredibly drinkable brew... It's perfect as a session beer, it's perfect as a lawnmower beer, it's a great gateway to introduce macro drinkers to micro quality, it's really quite tasty -and- it's got a very impressive mouthfeel. There's really nothing to complain about with this beer and quite a lot to praise."
"12oz. bottle poured into a pilsener glass. It pours a hazy medium yellow color with two fingers of head that just last and last. There is a good amount of sticky lace left on the glass. The smell is very malty, with lots of bread character. Tons of pale malt, with bits of yeast and biscuit in there. The taste is malty up front. Lots of pale malt dominate. There's more bready characteristics coming through, with a slightly hoppy finish. A touch of lemon as well. The mouth is nice and strong for an unfiltered lager. The drinkability is great, and I really enjoyed this with some warm brie on sliced baguette. Thanks to Kev for giving me this brew before he moved to Chi-town."
"This was on tap along with Spotted Cow at the New Glarus Polkafest. Poured into a plastic cup golden colored with a small white head. Smelled corny (like S Cow) but stronger and more metallic and malty. Corny, wheaty, slightly spicy flavor, some banana esters in there maybe. nice mouthfeel, good for summer drinking. Overall i liked it but not the best from NG."
"Thanks to Stonecrusher for the metric assload of NG beers."
"D: You could really go thru a lot of this beer. Not overly complicated or complex, a very smooth and straight up beer."
"D- goes down pretty easy"
"Yokel pours a cloudy yellow to golden color and makes a small crown (1/2 inch) of fluffy white bubbles. Lean, malty aromatics, very subtle hint of spiced noble hop. Light, crisp, clean caramel malts blend with hint of bready yeast and again a slightly spiced noble hop flavor. Light to medium palate, clean and smooth palate, nice soft bubbles in the carbonation. Nothing terribly exciting about this brew other than the fact that the taste and aroma is very clean and pleasant, and it offers a nice clean, soft mouthfeel... all of which make this very quaffable. Drinkability factor is quite high. I can't wait to try more offerings from New Glarus!! Thanks to ThomasHardy for this bottle!"
"Taste: Malty, with lots of bread and grainy characters. Hops are fairly subdued, with a slight citric zing at the back end of the flavor. Interesting, it almost tastes like a past-its-prime euro lager, but in a good, and drinkable way. I could easily session this, but I think it could be a more profound beer."
"The mouth is slightly astringent and it thins the beer out a bit. The beer sure started off good with nice looks and smell. Unfortunately, it faded a bit in the backstretch. Im glad I just bought a single as NG makes some much better beers."
"This is easy drinking and reminds me somewhat of Spotted Cow, but with less of that ale fruitiness that Cow seems to exhibit."
"Pours a clean yellow hue, an okay head and head retention. Aroma is bready and yeasty. Nice. Clean. Crisp? Taste is akin to that a fresh baked bread. Again, bready and yeasty. Mouthfeel is nice, carbonation is good. Perhaps a touch thick for style (I think that's the first time I've said something like that). This is a dangerously drinkable beer, and perhaps a perfect session beer."
"12 oz bottle. The label proclaims, ""Wisconsin lager with yeast."" Pours an oranged straw color with minimal patchy head over top. Clarity is good, with just a slight haze and no carbonation is apparent. Nose is enticing. I get notes of lightly honey coated grain, and herbal to grassy hop. Light toastyness is apparent, but not strong. Flavor is much the same as the nose. The toasted bread character is more prevalent, balanced with a sweet and grainey character. This is backed by a moderate herbal noble hop, finishing with just a kiss of bitterness and a lemony zest. The aftertase is almost like a honey bread, with a sweet and melanoidan toastyness. I like the aftertaste a lot. Mouthfeel is moderate with a light and very fine carbonation, which works well with the flavors found in the brew. I have not had many brews in this style, so I don't have much to judge by, but this one is tasty. The solid melamoidan flavors marry well with the lighter grainyness and the herbal to floral noble hop. This is a nice take on a German style by a US brewer."
"this is by far the most enjoyable lager experience that i have had in some time. i wish new glarus would expand their business, would love to have their offerrings more often."
"This was my least favorite selection as of yet from New Glarus"
"A very good beer."
"Pale yellow with a slight haze. Decent cap of white foam composed of fine bubbles. Grainy aroma with delicate spicy hops. Light bitterness with spicy/floral hops and grainy/crackery malt. Light bodied and a bit drying, moderate carbonation. This is quite a drinkable beer, very nice. Thanks HogTownHarry!"
"I could get to like this."
"light yellow with initial large head, lace in glass. Lagerish beer with yeast and cheese aroma. Bit of creaminess at beginning, astringent in finish, that improves as it warms. Some wheat.strong carbonation. Very drinkable. Lemon peel aftertaste. Medium mouthfeel."
"Pours a slightly cloudy golden color with a bit of an orange hue. Had a nice white head that dissipated quickly, leaving small amounts of lacing and a nice ring around the glass. Smell is pretty nice with some lemon smells, biscuit, a bit of corn, and some floralness. Not great, but pretty interesting and enjoyable. Taste is slightly bready with a definate lemon zest in there as well, hops are present but faintly. There is even a bit of corn flavor in there that I think pairs well with this. Not a whole lot of carbonation, and a light to medium body on this one. I like that it is not overcarbonated like most beers of this style. Drinkability is definately deserving of a perfect. This beer is great for almost any occasion and can be enjoyed by virtually anyone."
"D - Very clean and drinkable. It will make a really nice summer session beer."
"Man, I could and would drink this all day if I still lived in WI."
"Drinkability -- This beer is not the most complex beer I've ever drank, but it is good for what it is. This is a beer that will appeal to wide market. It will satisfy both the micro and macro beer drinkers. This is a beer that will be very satisfying come summer. I will be purchasing this beer again."
"Update: 2-6-06, After drinking this beer for a year I have come to adore it. Yokel is nearly perfectly crafted and its drinkability can't be beaten. I'm upping my ratings a bit today."
"12 ounce bottle. New Glarus Yokel pours out a slightly cloudy yellow color with very little head. Strong aroma of bread dough and leafy hops. Grain flavor with lots of yeast. Not too sweet, thankfully. The bitter, hoppy finish is the best aspect of the flavor. Medium mouthfeel and carbonation. I sampled this beer fresh, and it is only average. Even fresh it seems to be on the verge of skunkiness. A glorified spotted cow."
"At first glance, smell and taste, I thought this would just be ho-hum; a beer for the majority that couldn't please the palate. I was so off. Gulp after gulp after guld, this beer dissapeared quickly. Well made and balanced to perfection. I gotta give it to NG, this is damn tasty."
"drinkability: very drinkable"
"Drink Yokel"""
