"Overall: A really clean and quaffable summer brew. A little lacking in depth to make it a regular, but much better than the last time I had it bottled. I could see this being my go-to beer for neighborhood barbecues."

"Maybe it's just the style, but this this one doesn't stick out to me. The first sip reminded me of Yuengling lager, which isn't necessarily bad, but not something I would regularly buy... I'm not going to turn it down during the warm summer months. Glad I only bought one bottle though."
"A great summer beer, and another great one from this brewery."

"This beer pours with about a finger of foamy white head. Despite the unfiltered nature of the brew, there is little cloudiness (I will swirl the next one, I know I can get those tasty yeasts to comply!). In the aroma you get lots of grain and bread; almost cracker-like. The flavor comes off as largely the same as the aroma, very bready, almost like taking a fist full of pale (pilsner?) malt in your mouth (this Keller bier is definitely infinitely tastier I am certain). Although the complexity is nothing like something with various adjuncts and a major ABV, this beer is very refreshing and really fits the bill when you want to have a few beers without feeling too bloated or drunk."

"O: damn tasty. Only picked up a single and really wish i had more. Light in alcohol and refreshing, this is a great summer beer, or for anytime you want a nice flavorful beer that isnt going to wreck your taste buds or sobriety. This is only my second keller/zwickel, and i will definitely seek out more. I think this edges out fat head's example by being slightly more complex. Will buy again for sure and hope i can score some more before it's gone for the year."

"O: This is a very nice beer for the summer—it’s somewhat malty but still easy to drink."

"On draft at Woodlands Tavern in Columbus. Pour was a super cloudy light straw with a tight white head. The smell is loaded with a sweet light graininess and no bitterness whatsoever. The taste is super drinkable, with the taste dominated by corn and grain. I love this German beer from what Ive learned is on of the better small breweries in OH."

"OVERALL: A summer beer with plenty of flavor and character. Tasty, well made, actually almost like a high quality import lager. A beer like this is always welcome in the beer fridge."

"A nice summer lager, I could see hitting this a few times on a hot summer day. This beer is not hurt at all by serving it ice cold, still retaining all the taste and feel it has as it warms. Another quality beer from Columbus Brewing Company!"
"O- This is a wonderful session lager for the summer. So drinkable, amazing mouthfeel, and some really nice flavor."
"Pours a semi clouded yellow golden color with massive white head flowing thick, big chunky head at that with velvet smooth texture. Lacing is scattered nice and random around my big oversized glass. Aroma has lemon essence with biscuit dough rising in the morning kitchen, flavorwise it's a beautiful thing fresh with biscuit dough bread lightly toasted malt sweetness. Ample German hops to balance out the sweetness leaving a semi dry finish, perfect summer beer these guys from Columbus brewing are dead on. Mouthfeel is light ample lively carbonation jumps off the palate and into my senses, amazing flowing beer with enough girth from yeast sediment to truly fulfill your thirst and hunger. Overall intense simple complexity to breed drinkability if that makes sense."
"Summer Teeth is a nice Kellerbier. It’s not a style that features a ton of pizzazz, but this is a nice release. It’s pretty straight forward, tasty, and easy to drink. Who am I to argue with such a combo? Try a bottle or two and see for yourself…it’s good stuff."
"Very nice summer brew. Perfect for outdoors activities. Another well made brew from Columbus Brewing."
"Summer Teeth is simply extraordinary."

"Highly recommended. I'm very impressed. It's one of those lagers that opens your eyes and let you know there's some really interesting ones out there. Really really nice beer right here.."

"Overall - Quite a tasty brew. I can definitely see this being a summer go-to. Seems like it would be superb on a hot day. Another fine beer from the folks at CBC"

"While I'm fairly new to the style, this is simply a well-constructed beer."
"looks like hay color with a small cap of white that seriously stayed for about a few seconds with no visible carbonation. aroma is earthy, musky grain, touches of light grass, but really rather bland and without much in the way of any depth, light feel, watery at times without any really big flavors or huge noticeable chnage from the smell. clean finish with little aftertaste left not much on the palate"
"M- light bodied, but with a nice bit of crispness."
"O- A nice crisp lager for the summer time. A nice switch from the usual American Pale Wheat summer beers that flood the shelves at this time of year."
"O- Pretty descent summer beer."
"O: Very enjoyable, great summer beer."
"O: Refreshing summer beer. I can see this as a beer that would attract a lot of attention when the temps start rising."
"O: A nice summer lager, refreshing and easy drinking. Couldn't ask for much more. Its only fault is the dryness."
"12 ounce bottle (2011 batch with new label). Served in a mug, the beer pours a hazy gold color with about an inch off-white head. Head retention and lacing are both good. Aroma is grainy (wheat?) and sweet malt, citrusy hops (lemon peel), and a bit of grassy hops. Taste is similar to the aroma, it tastes mostly like grain/wheat/bready malt and some citrusy hops (lemon peel). Mouthfeel/body is light, it's crisp and easy to drink. I think it's a nice refreshing brew, a good choice for summertime. I can't believe I haven't tried this before, I might have to pick up some of this over the summer. Definitely worth a try."
"Quite tasty and enjoyable. A perfect craft beer for a BMC drinker... And a good beer for a Ba looking for a nice summer brew."
"D-I enjoyed the one I had...probably would (and did) switch it up after one...but could easily go right back for another. Not my top style of beer but I was at CBC last night and wanted to try it on draft...I was pleased."
"Overall impression: Ryan, feel free to keep the CBC express rolling my way. These guys know their way around a brew kettle."
"Mouthfeel is great, super carbonated, crisp, clean, goes down easily. Drinkability is super high too. I don't see myself wanting more of this any time soon, but were it offered to me I could likely drink a 6-pack on a hot summer day while out throwing the horseshoes."
" Went down nicely,glad to of tried this brew!"
"Serving type: bottle, poured into a Guinness style glass."
"D- A very good summer lager. Anyone could pick this up and be able to enjoy it. It is clean and crisp but the intense dryness doesnt make it an overly thirst quenching one."
"Great amount of carbonation, light bodied and nice and crisp. This is so easy to drink, goes down smooth and is definitely something I will buy again. Would work great at a cookout and definitely something I would say is sessionable. Another good brew from Columbus Brewing."
"Drinkability: Sessionable if it wasn't for the taste."
"D- Quite quaffable with a nice flavor."
"While I'm not really familiar with the beer style, this may be my new go to summer beer. Fantastic combo of smoothness, body, sweetness and bitterness. Home run for Columbus Brewing Company. This could truly be their crossover hit to the macro crowd."
"Drank this from a 12 oz bottle, decanted into a pint glass. It's a pale golden color, small white head. Definitely a summer lager - smells cool, bready, touch of honey and grains. Not terribly strong. Taste is pretty clean - bready, little bit of honey, slight hop bitterness toward the end. Light mouthfeel - very appropriate. This is a great summer beer - easy to drink, goes well with all the summer foods."
