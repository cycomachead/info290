3.97,-2,4,4.5,4,3.5,3.5,"Had this on gravity cask. This beer poured a vibrant golden color with crystal-clear clarity. Mountains of foam capped it, releasing a honeyed sweet aroma. Light flavor of sweet honey and clove flowers, but not hoppy nor bitter. Enjoyable, especially for a spring day.","elNopalero","Aug 25, 2011"
4.23,4.4,4,3.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Pours golden with a very slight haze; some bubbles but no head to speak of - about right for gravity cask. The smell is faint but nice: some woody notes, a little grass and grain. The taste is more complex: lots of wood, pumpernickel bread, marigold, a rusty bitter finish. It's lightly carbonated, thin in body, but with some viscosity at the swallow. Very easy to drink, and a very fine beer indeed.","gory4d","Sep 24, 2009"
3.73,-7.9,4,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"Overall not bad, very drinkable and refreshing, nice malts and hops but just not enough of them.","jlindros","Sep 22, 2009"
4.43,9.4,4.5,4,4.5,4,5,"500ml bottle. Pours a slightly hazy straw yellow with a fluffy white head. Great lacing. Smells of full, grainy malt with a lot of grassiness; the hops are quite evident. Earthy. Tastes of pale malt and wet hay, with a crisp bitterness that makes it super refreshing. Great light-medium body. Incredibly easy to drink. Fantastic stuff, though it's better from a fresh cask.","philipquarles","Sep 21, 2009"

4.35,7.4,4.5,4.5,4,4,5,"The taste is similar but lightly on the bitter side with bread, hay, pine, lemon, juice, a somewhat bitter finish, and overall very tasty with good flavour.","Offa","Jul 21, 2008"
4.12,1.7,4,4.5,4,4,4,"Quite a tasty beer and super drinkable. A bit of a raw and wild lager but one of the better ones out there.","Zorro","Beers"
4.29,5.9,3,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"D: An interesting tasty beer that just showed up at BevMo one day, don't see many of this rare Franconian style so I had to pick it up. Very drinkable and refreshing, go try this beer if it shows up in your area.","Halcyondays","0"
