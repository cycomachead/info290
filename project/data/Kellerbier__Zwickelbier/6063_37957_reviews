"O: This beer didn't seem to have all of the raw yeast flavors that you normally get from a Kellerbier or a Zwickelbier, but the fruity notes from the yeast were pleasant."
"Thanks to Thirstybird for the opportunity to try this one. 500ml bottle served in a willibecker. 09.10.14 indicated on the label. Pours a translucent caramel-colored hue with a rocky, 2.5 inch, bright white head that eventually disperses into a consistent 1/8th inch cap. Delicate curlycues of lacing are revealed during the tasting. Nose expresses grains and caramel with a hint of Marzen skunk. Taste consistent with nose; however, it all comes off a bit watery and there is also a faint metallic character at the finish. There's also a slight breadiness to the flavor profile. Mouthfeel is light in body with an average level of carbonation. Overall, just an okay Marzen - nothing to write home about, but I'm glad to have had the opportunity to try it fresh."

"O: This is a nice Keller with everything that should be there."

"This is quite a nice beer"
"Half litre bottle, copper colour, clear, big thick head. Initially it had a nice grassy hoppy aroma but this faded quickly. First mouthfull was nice and had notes of malt but it went downhill fast and by the end was close to being undrinkable. Mouthfull was ok, only thing acceptable about this beer. Overall poor, not impressed by the brewery, also its a Dunkel."
"Poured from a bottle purchased in Nuremburg area. Poured roughly into german .5 l glass. Beautiful orange, copper color, ample carbonation. Minimal head fades to skin quickly. In the mouth, feels like it will have some bite or bitterness, but none to be found. Taste is very smooth, almost pilsener like, unexpected for such a dark beer.Much lighter in taste than expected, just a hint of bitterness on the back of the tongue. Caught off guard with this one, not bad, but different from expectations."
"Overall not bad, a bit lighter than it should have been in taste profile."
"Pours a moderate copper color with a nice white head and a bit of lacing. Smell brings forward a large amount (comparatively) of doughy malt as well as some lighter, apple-ish fruits. Taste brings forward some hop bitterness, with a bit of earth and hints of citrus. Feel was moderate and a bit thicker than most kellers, although still fairly light. Drank fairly well, but was a bit dark and heavy compared with its flavor profile."
"D: Great, great, great. Very very easy to drink. Perfect summer beer. This is the best one I've had so far from Weissenohe."
"How I wish this beer were a bit more available. This is the sort of beer I could see myself drinking glass after glass of, as it's just that good and easy to drink. Yummy!"
"Amber with a thin white head. Great clarity. There's a thin head that hangs around a while. On the nose, there's a fresh, earthy hop character with a rich malt backbone with caramel and honey. Clean, this is almost a hybrid of a kellerbier and a marzen. The palate opens mildly bitter with an earthy hop character. Ridiculously deep, there are flavors of caramel, honey, bread, burnt sugar and a mild fruity character with figs and plums. Awesome. The finish is dry and long lasting with a blend of bitterness and sweetness. Light in body with soft carbonation, this beer is a treat to drink."
"On cask at the Avenue. Pours a slightly hazy orange-amber with a huge, fluffy off-white head. Great lacing. Smells largely of caramel and bready yeast. Earthy. Tastes of big caramel malt, with plenty of earthiness and even a slight bit of smoke. Dryer than one would expect. Light-medium body. This is what an Oktoberfest should be."
"Sweet aroma is a mix of toasted malt and, unfortunately, a chunk of corn. Tall, foamy, pale tan colored head faded slowly. Tastes like dough and raw grains mixed with a butterscotch corn hybrid. The flavors of a landbier are there, but in the wrong proportions and a bit out of whack. Mouthfeel is watery with hardly any carbonation. A mild beer that manages to be to sweet. Maybe some more hops would balance it out and cover up some of the corny bits. One is enough for me."
