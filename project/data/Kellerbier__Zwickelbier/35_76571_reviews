"For a Sam Adams product, I expected something a little more memorable. This was good and certainly has a time and a place, but it was largely vacant. The temperature with which it was served was a little warmer than I prefer, maybe 45F, and that may have affected the overall expectation, however, what struck me most was the lack of 'zest' in the body and bitterness. Good for a hot summer day, as a very light, refreshing alternative, I'd imagine."

"Obtained a bottle from a ""pick six"" craft beer wall here in Calgary. This beer certainly looks like it diverges from other members of the lager clan, a murky peach color with a few inches of white head. One is immediately struck by the yeasty, spicy nose. Smells like bakery shop yeast, bready but with some peppery spice and green herb that perhaps recalls celery. You can discern some sweetness as well, perhaps stone fruit and mild citrus. Palate reflects all these components and this beer is something of a mishmash ... The aforementioned yeast jumps out first, followed by sourdough bread, honey sweet malt, weedy green hops that recall fresh grass, hints of unripe apple and quince, subtle orange and lemon citrus, vitamin tablets, and something else herbal that is hard to pin down (licorice?). Eventually these malty and fresh zesty flavors give way and things become sweeter, bringing the stone fruit from the aroma back to mind. Plenty fizzy and this serves to amplify the overall sour, fruity, and yeasty vibe than I can only assume is unique to lagers that have not been purged of yeast remnants. Alcohol is detectable. Hops were not as assertive as the label suggests (""Hopped With Tettnang""!) but there certainly is a citrus node in the flavor matrix. Medium bodied with a pleasant creamy mouthfeel. The total package is crisp and dry enough to pass muster as a pilsener family member but with considerable residual sweetness and more fruit elements. I'd enjoy this in greater quantities as a warm-weather sessional."

"This beer was served way too cold, which given the location was not completely unexpected. Still this is fairly enjoyable, and definitely serviceably quaffable. It definitely gets more flavorful and complex as it warms up from frigid initial serving temperature."

"I don't like much from Sam Adams and I don't typically care for lagers, but this was pretty good. Not as aggressive as an ale, it's fairly full-flavored."

"Pours a pretty honey gold. Cloudy with great retention and lacing. Really engages the eye. Nose is soft. Yeast, a little floral and citrus hops, not really bright. Considerable malt profile in the nose. Bread and biscuit, sweet honey, cracker and lots of doughy malt. Hops come back to the nose with some sweet citrus as it warms and a little earth. Opens up with orange and lemon. The taste is grassy hops, the tart fruits in back of the hay and earth and hardy with toasted grains and doughy breaddy malt. It’s lightly dry, soft and pleasant enough. But, while it drinks friendly, it is a little bland. It doesn’t really linger and seems to be a kind of mix of styles. Looks like a belgian, smells like a lager, drinks like a bit heavy pils. Nothing really stands out as excellent but it is rich and smooth. Low alcohol content and if you like malt you could drink a few of these."

"O- not quite sure what to think if this one, tastes similar to a wit, but a few other random flavors just seems to set it off a bit"
""
"Overall: If I had a blindfold on, I would have pegged this as an American take on a Wit; too sweet and not enough tang to make the style work; as it is, I have no idea what the brewers are going for beyond the combination of a bock, lager and kellerbier (and why is that a worthwhile combo?)"
"O- The sulfur quality is pretty strong with a most of the hops flavor just being bitterness and not much flavor/aroma."
""
""
""
""
"Bottle: Poured a slightly hazy dirty golden color lager with a relatively large foamy head with good retention and some light lacing. Aroma consists of dry floral hoppy notes with lightly sweet malt base. Taste is also dominated by lightly sweet malt base with some nice floral hoppy notes. Body is quite full for style with good carbonation. Very well brewed with easy drinkability and enough complexity form the dry floral hoppy notes with light citrus undertones. This is a lot more hoppy then I would have expected."
""
""
"Overall, the taste is interesting and complex, and it shows that the right amount of hops can add to and enhance a beer (too often we see way too many over-hopped micros)."
""
""
""
"O - I'm not sure what I expected, but this didn't hit the spot. This style isn't in my wheelhouse."
""
"Not my favorite Sam Adams beer"
""
""
""
""
"O/D - A pretty decent take on the style. Definitely not breaking new ground, but it's got a solid flavour. Not overly drinkable though, as the flavour doesn't really hold your attention all that well. A good effort though."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Bottle. Pours a slightly hazy golden-orange color. Moderate white head with good retention. Aroma is lager yeast and flowery hops. Flavor is similar--notes of yeasty bread with a slight floral soapiness that, unfortunately, lingers longer than the other flavors. Medium bodied and clean mouthfeel."
"Poured a 12 oz bottle into a Sam Adams glass. Poured a cloudy gold with about two fingers of creamy white head that lasts quite a while and leaves nice lacing on the glass. Aroma was pretty nice, sweet with fruity notes and little bit of hop bitterness. Taste is primarily malty, with bready notes balanced out against the hops. It has a nice, if slightly understated, flavor and it's obvious it was well made. The mouthfeel has some slight carbonation at the beginning but is otherwise quite smooth and a little bit thicker. The flavors don't knock you out, but it is still a well-crafted and flavorful beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A medium body beer with good carbonation. Finish is very slightly dry. Very refreshing. Has a nice lemony tang. Overall a tasty beer that requires me to have another."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Overall this is pretty good. No complaints. Affordable too. Recommended by me."
""
""
"o: a nicely full, round lager aroma augmented with lots of yeasty, bready character as a result of being unfiltered, nicely hopped as well drinks well"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I usually drink this on tap, but have been known to grab the occasional six-pack."
""
"O: Not my thing i guess. I enjoy the Sierra Nevada Kellerwies quite a bit, but this really didn't do it for me."
""
""
"O) An alright beer. Seems fairly consistent with the style profile."
""
""
""
""
"I have greatly enjoyed Samuel Adams Alpine Spring."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Oh well, at least I get to tick a brand new style."
"This is an average Keller, it would be nice on a warm spring day as an easily drinkable session brew but nothing really stands out."
""
"Not a bad offering from SA but there are others of a similar style I would choose. Would prefer a stronger hop flavor."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Meh. A very average beer. It's drinkable, and it's not bad, but there's nothing to make me want to really have another. Regardless, I WOULD have another to see how it tastes when I'm not a little stuffed up. A respectable seasonal."
"I would not seek this beer out unless it was the only thing between me and a MGD."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Not bad, certainly drinkable but not the most exciting beer."
"This is a very refreshing beer, perfect for fans of wheat beers since is has a bit of that style's coriander and banana sweetness, great on it's own but going well with light pork and salad dishes. Cheers!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Final Thoughts: If you like the combination of butter and citrus then this is the beer for you. I'm actually surprised because Samuel Adams usually has pretty solid seasonals. Would I drink it again? Not without some persuasion."
""
""
"overall I found this beer tastely but kinda unremarkable...I would def get it again as I did like it a lot. There was nothing excepting the crispness that I found stood out for me."
"This might have tasted better to me than it really is because I had it on the first day of Spring, while looking out over a snow covered land! But it did invoke a fresh taste that was enjoyable, and made me dream of daffodils and dogwood blossoms that are soon to arrive!"
"Golden and hazy. Small, but tightly formed white head. The head looks like soap lather. Good retention and lace. Simple, inviting aroma, yeasty bread dough and lemon zest. Gently sweet and malty up front with fresh baked bread note, joined shortly after by a lemony hop note. A grainy note persists in the finish alongside very gentle bitterness. Almost medium-bodied with low carbonation. Feels smooth and a little bit creamy on the palate. Good beer, but I prefer the bolder Noble Pils. With Noble Pils not being available this year in Ontario, I would consider buying this again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall a great beer."
""
"I've bought this a few times now, and will buy again."
"O- My best experience with a SA brew so far."

"eh, had higher hopes for this one. pours mostly clear even though its said to be unfiltered, really light yellow in color with a very nice white head. the nose is pretty hoppy, lemony and light, with a lighter grain makeup as well, maybe some wheat in here, and plenty of pale and crystal malt. the flavor is more balanced than the nose, and therefore the hops don't really get big until the finish, which is clean and fresh, brisk, like early spring itself. it also has a minerally character, elemental, not metallic, but off just a bit. its super easy drinking, light and interesting enough, with really bright carbonation and a less than medium body. it does get a little filling after a few though, which is sort of odd, but this is a decent choice for the spring box. if I reach into the box blind and grab one of these, im not disappointed, although I probably wont seek this out again."
"Mouthfeel: This is a medium to light bodied beer that flows easily around the palate."

"O: A very solid beer, easy to drink and very refreshing, a great beer for that midpoint between Winter and Spring."
""

"12oz bottle, cloudy golden beer topped with a foamy, white head, decent retention & lace. Citric aroma with lemon, biscuity malt, grassy hop. Tastes include sharp lemony citrus notes, biscuity grain, grass, finishes nice & clean with a peppery spiciness. Thinner body with moderate carbonation to help it a bit. Overall, better than I remember it being, and a good interpretation of the style."

"Tastes of citrus and a hint of alcohol that is then overtaken by sourness."
""

"A very solid seasonal from Samuel Adams. Crisp and refreshing, and a (mostly) worthy replacement for Noble Pils. Worth checking out. I'll definitely be putting this with some burgers from the grill soon."
""
"I poured this brewski into my tumbler at 45 degrees. The beer was cloudy unfiltered kinda orange looking with a kinda orange looking head. The head also did not last very long. The beer had a indescribable smell, sorry. The beer was carbonatedly tasting and had a hint of orange peel taste. Slightly bitter finish and decent lacing. Might be a good summertime beer. I will try again cause I'm really not sure if I liked it or not."

"Easily one of my top 3 favorite beers. Beautiful beer from start to finish. Nice pour. Collects a little (and I mean little) sediment in the bottle if the course of a few days in the fridge, but didn't effect tasting. I can't think of much that could be done to improve this, aside from moving it out of the seasonal catagory, and over to year-round ""Brewmaster's collection."""

"Summary - This was surprisingly tasty. I liked the wheat-like lightness of it combined with a little hop bite at the beginning. Definitely one of my favorites from Sam Adams. Will look forward to this seasonal."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, I thought it was an excellent beer pretty well balanced but leaning towards the sweet side."
""
"o: nice, but ultimately a bit forgettable. Nothing is really standing out."
""
""
"Not a bad brew. Poured at a good temperature with a smallish off-white head that quickly settled to a whispy island and ring and a bit of lace. Color is a hazy amber. Aroma is the best part: fresh beery, malt, hop, yeast. Flavor's like nose and brings out some fruit - grapefruit and apricot, sweet that controlled by mainly carbonic tang and a bit of bitter. Despite that tang, carbonation seems a bit tame with good body. Finish is like flavor and fairly long. Easy drinking brew. Good for the spring time."
""
""
"Bought a 12 pack on a whim. Best by July, 2013. Pours a bright, light but straw color & very cloudy. Bright white 2 finger head that slowly settles to a thin cover that lasts with thin lacing. Aroma of the hops along with some lemony(?) citrus & floral is rather nice. Taste keeps with the aroma of slight grassy hop character, some crisp citrus balanced with a little wheat. Clean mouthfeel. Really, really surprised by how good this was and how much I enjoyed it. I really like this. Will recommend this to others."
""
""
""
""
""
"Cheers!"
"12 ounce bottle into perfect pint glass, best before July 2013. Pours hazy golden straw color with a nice 2 finger fluffy off white head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Spotty foamy lacing clings on the glass, with plenty of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big lemon, apple, pear, grape, bread, wheat, honey, floral, grass, light pepper, and herbal earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance, strength, and complexity of fruity esters, malt, and hop notes. Taste of lemon, pear, apple, biscuit, honey, wheat, floral, grass, light pepper, and herbal earthiness. Lingering notes of light fruits, biscuit, honey, floral, grass, light pepper, and herbal earthiness on the finish. Damn nice flavor balance and complexity of hop. malt, and fruity esters; with a nice amount of robustness; and zero cloying flavors present after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a creamy and fairly crisp mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with hardly any warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is an excellent kellerbier lager! Very nice amount of well balanced flavors with good complexity; and extremely smooth to drink. A highly enjoyable offering."

"Pretty good seasonal brew. Similar to theri ol Summer Ale except has a bit more of a hop kick. Pretty good and refreshing beer."

"It's a very drinkable beer, but not something I would go out of my way to order again."
""

"From a single 12 oz bottle bought at Trader Joe's. I'm going for the Sam Adams Spring 12-pack for some more of this."

"O: Sam Adams has a nice brew here. It has a nice, balanced flavor, and a surprisingly good mouthfeel for a lighter beer. The name is Alpine Spring, but I could easily sit out on my deck in the summer and quaff this one. A good choice if you want something that has some nice flavor, but will also quench your thirst. The only thing I still can't get over is why every year Sam Adams retires its Winter Lager and puts out its ""Spring"" Brew in the middle of January."

"Wheat beers can get a little boring or heavy during the summer so this beer would be a tasty light beer to drink. There are a ton of different very subtle flavors in this beer which is pretty amazing for a light beer from the largest ""craft brewery"" in the country. There is citrus, balanced perfectly with the hop bitterness. Then, the beer is unfiltered so it has a light-medium mouth-feel to it and a bit of fruity flavor similar to wheat beers. Will definitely buy it again and try to stock up in case they stop selling it in the summer."
""

"Overall: Decent beer for the price especially if going to a store with limited options."

"We've heard this is awesome on draught so we look forward to reviewing it again."
"Very cloudy appearance, with a pale golden color made this look similar to a Hefeweizen, except for the head, which was much smaller. The smell was quite floral and lemony, and very inviting. The taste started tart and bready and finished powdery and dry. The hop bitterness was barely there. The body felt light and quenching. Simple in construction but quenching, this is like potato chips in beer form. Once you start , you will not notice ho fast you are consuming it, and once it's gone, you immediately feel the need to grab another."
"O: This brew is very mediocre. Nothing too exciting."
""
"O: When I had this last year, I thought it was completely awful. Now, I find it perfectly average - not bad, not great, workable in a pinch, but not worth seeking out. If anything represents the C average to a T, it's this (and Fat Tire)."
""
""
""
""
"O - I was impressed. It was definately a different beer. Wasnt overly complex but was very easy drinking and had some smells and tastes that one doent normally encounter"
"Pours a golden and hazy orange with about a finger of off white thin head. Left some decent lacing at first that disappeared over the course of the drink. Smells of stale lemons, grassy, and wheat. Crisp and clean hop bill up front, followed by some malty chewiness, and finishes with a lemon zest sour citrus smack. This is a medium to full body, but has a relatively sour feel to it that I can't undo. Other than the sourness, it is highly drinkable, but I would go ""on to the next one....before trying this one a second time."
""
"12oz bottle. Hazed copper with a stiff lightly off-white head. Sudsy lacing that sticks. Smells tangy with citrus and bread flavors that are wrapped up in a earthy and floral blanket. The taste has a tight bitterness with notes of fresh citrus, including a little zesty lemon and orange. Bready malt mixes in along back to gives this a strong twang across the back. Dry and bitter finish. Medium bodied with a firm and crisp bite that gets a little softer underneath. This is easy drinking stuff with the sweetness of a lighter Bock beer but then a crisp citric presence that really gave this a nice snap in the mouth as well. Decent stuff."
""
""
""
"Sam Adams continues to impress me lately. From exciting new year-round brews to really great seasonals, they have really delivered some unique beers. I only bought a single of Alpine Spring, but I will going back to buy a six-pack soon. This is a spring seasonal I’ll be excited for each year."
""
""
"O: Overall I thought it was a good beer. I personally would have liked a little less yeast and a little more hop character, but otherwise it was a very good beer. It tastes very fresh and that is a good thing. I would recommend buying this in a place that has good temperature control, because that is likely to impact a beer with so much yeast in it. I would drink this again. Honestly I was thrown off by the ""Alpine Spring"" thing, where it brought thoughts of deodorant came to mind. I was pleasantly surprised at how good the beer is."
""
"This was a little disappointing for me in the taste. The aroma and unfiltered appearance promised a slightly more complex palate than what I got. But hey, it’s another seasonal notch on the Sam Adams belt I guess. That’s all that seems to count these days."
""
"O: A decent beer, definitely springy. The mix of the orange with the spice and the grassiness is actually quite pleasant. Not exactly my cup of tea, but it came in the sampler pack, so what's a man to do?"
""
""
""
"O: Pretty good beer. Refreshing for the Springtime."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a hazy orange with a foamy white. Smell is not very powerful, sweet with some malt and subtle citrus. Taste starts out with a subtle bitter moves to a mild sweet and slight citrus, the malt is the backbone of this beer. A nice smooth medium light beer very crisp, enjoyable feel. Overall a crisp beer with minimum flavor, worth checking out."
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Pretty mediocre from Sam Adams. Disappointed"
""
"It pours a cloudy orange with a big cloudy frothy head, and good lacing. It smells a little on the hoppy side. It has a fairly bland taste with a little bitter taste on the back end. It has a medium body with decent carbonation. Overall I was not too surprised by this beer and I would only buy it as part of a mixed pack."

"O: Tasty and very chuggable, goes down very easy. Really well balanced, but also not really distinctive. Seems to be missing something, just so neutral and even that it's almost bland. Not bland, as in flavorless... more like unremarkable or without character. I could chug a bunch of this but I'd never miss it or crave it. Could really take it or leave it. *shrug*"
""
"O: Can't get into this style of beer; might be a better offering to revisit in 90 degree weather. Drinkable but so forgettable."

"O- I liked this beer especially because it is balanced with a nice bite of hops. I get sick of beers that are only sweet and do not have any bitter hoppiness. Sam Adams beers never disappoint. They may not be the most complex beers, but they are always tasty and the price is right."

"Overall, this is a nice lager, and does carry a good range and complexity of flavors. Given the name, it’s easy to see drinking this on a mountainside, perhaps in a ski lodge, as a refreshing, flavorful beverage that won’t get you hammered before the next run. The beer does have weak points, especially in the nose, and the flavors as a whole could use more power and nuance to help set the brew apart. Still, not a bad offering."

"Would drink again!"

"Overall= If citrus taste is your thing this is for you, however I'm not the citrus type. I can see why its a spring seasonal for that reason."

"OA: I really enjoyed this beer. I wasn't too excited about it first because I was concerned about it being a little to bitter but it's actually well balanced. You get the nice citrus taste but it finishes sweet which gives it a really neat balance. I'll definitely be drinking another one of these."

"A very nice beer. I was a little surprised that this is a Keller beer. It reminded me of a Helles, but the unfiltered style gave it some interesting subtle notes. I will buy this beer again."

"Alright, It pours a hazy light amber with a nice white head that fades fast but leaves a thin layer of foam with nice lacing. The aroma is very refreshing. Hoppy notes of citrus and pine with a nice malt backbone. The taste is citrusy with a strong grassy malt finish. It has a crisp mouthfeel with moderate, prickly carbonation. It isn't an overly complex brew, but it gets the job done."

"serviceable lager at the JFK sports bar. Big head, deep yellow,Lacey,a little cheesy, and aggressive carbonation. ok drinkability.Reminds me of the premium lagers available many decades ago pre-big brewer. A zwickel? Not as good as the Creemore version."
""
""
"alpine spring from samuel adams pours a nice lemony gold color. the smell is hoppy like an ipa, maybe not as intense, with a lemony citrus freshness. the taste is pretty similar to the smell, its hoppy with a good bit of lemon...really fresh tasting. the hoppiness isnt too bitter either, which makes it smooth. i could drink lots of these."
""

"Very light for my tastes, but that aside I enjoyed it very much. Smooth and well balanced with a fruity tang."
""
""
""
""
"D/O. Drinkability is very high. Overall this is a fine beer."
""
""
"Actually, since this debuted, it's probably my favorite ""regular"" Sam Adams seasonal. An enjoyable and not incredibly complicated crisp lager that fits the Winter-Spring transition well. I think they hit the mark for what they were aiming for. Good on tap too."
""
""
""
"Overall this is an easy drinking beer with no discernable qualities otherwise. Maybe the wife will like it."
"Very great tasting. Easy on the palate. Not a lingering after taste. Would be great with dinner or just a nice summer night or winter night in a hot tub! Light beer. Good aroma. Would buy again! Taste good straight from the bottle or a frosted glass."
""
""
"Alpine Spring pours a hazy golden color, with a nice large forthy head. The smell has alot of spices, and hints of yeast. The taste is overall very crisp. Some Belgian like spices come through, and there is a rather strong yeast taste. Good full flavor. Overall I am not very experienced with this style, but I rather enjoyed this beer, no flavors were overpowering."
""
"O - This is a nice refreshing beer. I like it a lot. I think it may have a bit more specialty grain than needed. If they toned that down a bit the hops might come forward and nail the 'juiciness' that I think would work perfectly."
""
""
""
""
"O--A nice, refreshing lager that would work well on a warm day, but still hits the spot as I drink on a cold, cloudy day in January. Alpine Spring is simple, but tasty and honey-sweet. I wouldn't shell out for it in its own 12-pack, but it makes a nice 'team player' here in the spring mix pack. Good, not great."
""
""
"O: I enjoyed this beer, had some good earthy aromas and flavors. I was hoping for more of a kick in the hop department, but this beer is still pretty cold. So if you enjoy after letting it sit for about 30 minutes, flavor and aromas should enhance that much more. Very sessionable beer!"

"overall, i suppose it's worthy of the BA 82. this was left in the frig from the 6'er in spring. wasnt special then, isnt special now. does anybody else feel ALL the SA beers use the same hops, use the same malts, or are they just getting the same old taste from the stills? i've honestly never been a fan of SA, but given them many opportiunities. this one is just another sa example of them trying to market yet another type of brew. i couldnt even find it on their website. i went through the 'seasonal collection' and the 'barrel master collection' but just gave up. it's drinkable- they all are. but nothing really special. you're either a 'clone' who praises the brewery, someone who cant afford the bit-higher prices and doesnt drink it, or someone who knows it's just a gimmick. sorry for my rant. that's how i really feel."

"O - a tasty and easy drinking warm weather beer, nice compliment with my fish dinner"
""
""
""
""
""
"On the lighter end of medium bodied with a nice earthy hop presence up front that provides a decent amount of dry bitterness which lingers over the sweeter notes into a slightly dry finish. Dry and sticky with some grassy pine needle flavor which is countered by citrus and tropical fruit notes, notably mango, pineapple, grapefruit and citrus rind. Hop profile is more complex and flavorful than the nose suggests. Malt presence is a bit stronger than expected with hints of biscuit and graham cracker but it doesn't interfere with the hop flavor too much. Decently balanced and refreshing. Nothing extraordinary but pretty solid."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: The body of the beer is medium . This beer is just okay nothing in the beer that speaks to the beer soul."
""

"Goldish yellow in color with white head. Not a good taste not a good flavor not a good beer. Rather powerful and bitter. very light tasting thin beer. very little carbonation. actually tasted sour. possible that i got a stale beer but dobutful. this beer was just plain bad in my opinion. was truly hoping for more."
""
""
"Overall I think it is a great beer to set the tone for the warmer season rolling in."
""
""
""
"Had this a few times both on tap and from the bottle this spring, guess I should log a quick review. Another nice lager from Sam Adams. Bright grassy notes, lemon, lime, white pepper. Balanced herbal bitterness against some clean, almost honey-sweet malt. Clean and grainy. Light sulfur note gives a more authentic feel, as does the slightly rustic yeasty haze. Good beer. Love the return to lager brewing by American breweries lately and Sam Adams seems to be at the forefront with Alpine Spring and the excellent Nobel Pils."
""
""
"Overall - This beer could be sessioned quite easily. Sam Adams tweaks their traditional malted flavor here and provides a refreshing approach to a spring seasonal. Medium bodied and brimming with citrus. An overall attractive beer."
""
""
""
""
"Seriously tastes like somebody rolled up a fat joint of Sour Diesel and stuck it into the bottle. All I tasted was Marijuana while I was drinking this. That and some slight citrus notes. Wasn't horrible by any means, A much better choice than some beers out there, But I don't smoke pot nor do I enjoy the taste of it within my beer. Can't really recommend this to very many people as most probably wouldn't enjoy it and I do not understand how it has such high marks"
""
""
""
"D - Very drinkable. Very crisp and refreshing but a touch thin and mild."
""
""
"Presentation: Packaged in a twelve-ounce custom brown glass long neck bottle with a pry-off crown, served in a Great Divide Brewing Company goblet."
""
"Pours a cloudy light copper yellow, and sunset oranges. Nose is bready, lagery, with light bitter notes, pleasant but not assertive. Taste is rich, malty but not malt-forward, some bitter punctuations, bready, weisse-like without the bananas. Mouthfeel is active, fizzy, complete, full and scrubbing. Overall, again like a weisse beer, and good for sure, but prolly wouldn't buy another."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall it is worth the price to pick it up for 9 or 10 bucks a six pack. A good beer overall."
""
""
""
"Pours a murky honey orange with a 2 inch foamy orange-beige head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Foamy streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down Smell is of malt and some herbal, floral, and grassy hop aromas. Taste is very much the same with a nice citrus zest flavor that comes out as well. There is a very mild bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer with some nice earthy aromas and flavors."
""
"Not bad. Bright, drinkable. Tastes like spring."

"(*The term, meaning ""unbunged"" (essentially un-corked), indicates that the beer was left to mature in an open-air vessel. I have since learned that Spring Lager is not entirely made this way. Its tanks are controlled by a pressure valve.)"
""
"O-Reminiscent of Noble Pils, just unfiltered. A touch citrus hop, with a little more malt. A preferred Sam Adams for me."
""
""
"Overall: This wasn't the greatest beer I've ever had, but it was above average. The initial experience was unremarkable, but the flavor more than made up for the beer where it was lacking."
""
""
""
""
"O - A super easy drinking ale, with a non-offensive flavour that nicely grasps the characteristics of the style. I could drink this stuff all day, especially on a nice sunny spring day."
""
""
""
"I have drank a lot of this beer this spring. Probably my favorite Sam Adams seasonal."
"Overall - A great refreshing summer beer that has just enough taste to keep it interesting and yet not too overpowering. With the limited selection of decent beers in my area, this is something that was worth buying for sure. I'll buy it again."
""
"O: A very interesting Kellerbier with American hops - a nice twist."
""
"The body was mostly even and smooth, although there was just a tiny bite at the end. Drinkability was good, the beer went down pleasantly and I could see having a couple of these on a sunny day. Overall, a nice brew. Not an outstanding example of the style, but one that's certainly worth a shot when you see it."
""
""
""
"While I would recommend this a good choice for a light beer that is not overwhelming in taste or hops, I was not overly impressed. I've had much better from Sam Adams and for the same price I got this for. I think I prefer Noble Pils for a Sam's spring beer."
"O - Alpine Spring is not my favorite, but it is on par for the style. Its a well-balanced light spring brew."
""
"Probably my favourite of the Samuel Adams seasonal beers available in Canada, but I’d still prefer to have Noble Pils around. It’s somewhat unique, yet has a distinct “Yup, that’s Sam Adams” familiarity."
""
""
""
"A curveball offering to say the least. It won't make me forget about Noble Pils during the spring, although this is not one I'd reject."
"O- Solid, tasty, refreshing beer. Great for those first warm days for Spring. Go drink some!"
"Overall, a decent keller bier that is easy drinking and I expect excellent on a warm day. Certainly not as earthy and complex (or as good) as the creemore offering in this style but nonetheless very decent."
""
""
"Note: Fresh by date is June 2012, drank in February 2012."
"This is an interesting beer and first “Keller Bier”; Not a complicated beer by any stretch, but its flavorful and refreshing, great for drinking during the spring. Would recommend trying this while it’s available."

"Hazy orange colour with a little over a finger of dense white head, some lace webs all the way down the glass. Smell has a nice hoppy presence, zesty citrus fruit in the way of a lemon-lime scent, grassy, lightly sweet cereal malt and honey graham crackers. Taste is citrus up front with more of that lemon-lime found in the nose, floral grassy flavours, malt is present in the way of honey and graham cracker/cereal flavours, bitter throughout with a citrus aftertaste. Medium prickly carbonation, creamy feel with a good weight. Good overall and easily drinkable, not my favourite Sam Adams offering but serviceable and pleasant."
""
""
""
"Overall, I know I said some bad things about this beer, but I love it. Stylistically, if it were an ale, it would be a different story but since it's a keller bier, it had to knock it. But I love it. It's just starting to warm up and it goes great with the first two BBQ's I've had this year. Really reminds me of a lighter maibock."
""
"Pours light to medium amber with a good head of white foam. Light citrus nose, some honey. Citrus taste. German pilsy finish. Smooth and creamy throughout. Lemon is the dominant flavor, but overall a bright flavorful lager. Real good, easy spring drinker."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall a very good beer, though really the first amongst its style that I have tried. Recommended food pairings would be spicy foods (buffalo wings) or barbecued ribs."
""
""
"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was the mix in the nose. There was a fruity sweetness which really helped to cut the grain. This grain through the taste, however, was overly sour at times, much like the dirtiness of a Blue Moon. While this fit the style, and was decently refreshing, this beer was muddy around the edges, and overly mealy."
""
"O- Really enjoyed this one more than I thought I would. Hats off to BBC for this one"
"O: Overall, a pretty good spring beer.... reminds me a little of a Pils... but the mix of smells and flavors are great. With a good ABV, this would be a good session beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Appearance is a cloudy unfiltered yellow orange supporting an easily dissipating head and spotted lace. Smell of light malt, hop with a refreshing citrus note. Taste the sweet notes of the two-row pale and honey malt with a citrus note that lets you know its there mixed in with the unfiltered yeast. Mouthfeel is a light medium with good carbonation. It does have a character of its own to make its place on these upcoming warmer days."
""
"Overall: Decent brew, but the previous sping seasonals by Sam Adams were far better."
""
""
"A nice, soft spring lager, with the Euro version of citrus as a suggestion, rather than that of an edict. Easy to drink, just don't be expecting those jagged Saaz edges."
""
""
"I can see myself getting this beer again, but it won’t be on the top of my list. I also think this one might be a hell of a lot better on a really hot day after some hard work. This might be a better beer for summer."
""
""
""
"This is a medium to lighter bodied brew with a modest level of carbonation and a pleasant crisp finish that makes this easily drinkable. I could throw a couple of these back mindlessly in the summer with no issues."
""
""
""
"O: Such a refreshing seemingly simple and yet crisp and complex beer; I will enjoy this a couple times for some early spring grilling"
""
""
" A pretty good effort here from Sam Adams. This is a nice warm weather beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"overall a bit more character would do this offering justice, but as it is it's pretty good take on a lesser appreciated style. it goes down well on warm spring day."
""
""
"Happy to find this at the Tampa Airport Chili's, served cold in a tall glass this one shows a cloudy golden yellow color with a respectable feathery white head and decent lacing. I can smell simple wheat and slightly yeasty bread. Nothing much but pleasant enough. The flavor keeps to that theme with the addition of lemony sunshine and a peppery pineapple touch, lots more yeasty bread. It’s light to medium bodied with a very frisky carbonation and feel. Quite refreshing with a little bit of a dry, citrus hop finish. Very decent stuff."
"Descent overall. Nice for a warm spring day in the South."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: An enjoyable spring seasonal, and the first Keller Bier I've ever tried. I'd like to check out more of this style. Instantly one of my favorite SA seasonals."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A versatile spring lager with some substance to handle the spring chill and the citrus brightens it up for those warmer days. I can appreciate the fusion of different European influences that went into this. Still a Ho-hum offering that is as sessionable as it is average."
"Overall a very nice beer. It's very refreshing and is a great choice for the hot Florida spring."
""
""
"these are pretty easy to drink that's for sure, I always enjoy Sam Adams brews more then I think I will. decent stuff for the spring sun"
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A nice springtime/ summertime brew."
"M: A surprise. Quite good with a yeasty citrus fullness."
""
""
"I poured this beer into a pint glass, it has a nice orange color body with a lot of tine bubbles going up the body, not a whole lot of head ot it. The smell is of lager yeast and some lemon notes. The taste is sweet of lemon and with no tartness to it. The mouth feel is really good and overall this is a very tasty beer."
""
""
""
"Overall a nice combination of citrus and lager qualities. Well done and recommended."
""
""
""
"O- A nice warm weather beer from Sam Adams. Not super interesting, but I can appreciate what they are going for with it."
"went on a beer run today found this beer marked down , thought what the hey. poured from the bottle into a mug. honey in color with a nice head and a lemon aroma. there is a bit of sweetness with the malt. overall it is another decent beer from the people at the boston beer company."
""
""
"O: This is a very good summer time lager. Readily available, refreshing, and easy to drink. I will certainly be revisiting this one during the summer months."
""
"O-Sam Adams needs to stop making beers with lemon flavors (This and Coastal Wheat) both are poor beers."
""
"A decent enough lager. A good example of an unexciting style."

"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, Alpine Spring is a cloudy golden-orange color with a thick, soapy/foamy head. Smell is a bit subdued but is of citrusy hops and crisp grain notes. Flavor is light and citrusy, goes down smooth and easy. The mouthfeel is light to medium body with a slick carbonation. Overall another good one by SA, would look to this over most of the available fair at most public settings."
"Overall: Not too sweet, never very hoppy, and could use a bit more crispness, I've had this beer a few times on bottle and on draft at various times and it never quite manages to satisfy."
""
"On tap I loved the body of AS. It was smooth like a lager and creamy like an unfiltered wheat - the best of both worlds. However I had Alpine Spring in a bottle last night and its crisp and zesty and not at all as good IMO. Odd that the same beer should taste so different."
"Bone white head of whipped up froth, crackles with popping bubbles and dissipates quickly down to a surface coating, thin, if any, lacing left behind. Pale metallic orange in hue, slightly yellow at the rims, a few very scattered bubbles randomly arrayed. The nose is not soft per se, however, it does recline into your nostrils with non-aggressive warm bread, flowers, honey and peach pit scents, picks it up some via herbaceous and salty notes, some dried white citrus pith too, strikes a nice balance between accommodating and interesting. Medium-bodied, the carbonation lends it added creaminess, gently fills the mouth. Here the citrus and peach, apple, apricot fruit sweeter, especially as it warms. The honey to brown sugar element fits in just fine here, although tends to cover up the floral side some. The salt and pepper, dried grass and mineral notes dry it out as it gets nearer the finish. Again, neither hops nor malts predominate, any bitterness simply brings needed freshness vis-à-vis the underlying sweetness. Maintains its grip long after you swallow, while easy to drink could as easily be underestimated."
""
""
""
"Overall, this is a great spring beer. Very easy to drink and flavorful. Gotta tip my hat to the guys at Sam Adams. They deserve more credit."
""
""
""
"Pours a hazy golden, with a creamy white head. Aromas of cinnamon and allspice. Taste is a huge honey flavor up front, followed by some rich bread in the middle, and a lemony fresh citrus finish. Mouthfeel is rich for the abv, medium carbonation. Overall an excellent beer of a style I don't get to drink much of."
""
""
"O: A great new Spring seasonal offering by Sam Adams. Maybe they'll make this year-round like Noble Pils someday!"
"This brew has a bright gold with a cloudy appearance, Sits well in the glass with good lacing. The smell is a good blend of hops and citus very nice on the nose. Mouthfeel is dry and crisp and leaves the tongue very nicely. As far as taste this ranks well for a wheat brew. There is just a slight hint of the citrus in the brew, enough to help this brew go down. Overall we feel that Sam Adams has done it again."
""
""
"Samuel Adams Alpine Spring is a cloudy, sparkling golden beer with a leathery white film that leaves decent lacing. It has a grainy aroma with notes of lemon and wet paper. It has a very smooth medium body with a crisp finish. It tastes grainy and lemony like the aroma. It's just a hint sweet and kind of tangy. The bitterness is faint and shyly pokes its head through the lemon pepper finish. This tangy brew might be more appropriate in summer. It's a lager pretending to be a wheat ale."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The new Sam Adams seasonal, my first stab at the ""keller/zwickel"" beer. A great session beer for sure, a nice crisp, beer with great citrusy/tangy notes. Clean finish and super drinkable. I do miss the White Ale, but this is a damn good substitute... won't knock your socks off and isn't crazy different by any means, but for a good all around beer that reminds you of upcoming warm weather.. it gets the job done."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This beer makes its way over your tongue like a medium bodied brew, then near the back, seems to just bite down on it. It is a rather unique sensation in that the carbonation doesn't seem to hit right away."
""
""
""
""
"12 ounce bottle, best before July 2012. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours a cloudy golden/orange color with an inch off-white head. Head retention and lacing are both good. Aroma is nice, but a bit light. The brew smells mostly like citrusy and grassy hops, along with some bready malt. The taste is mostly just like the aroma, but there's the addition of some light floral hops. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit slick and creamy with a good amount of soft carbonation. I think this is a decent overall brew. I picked up this bottle as a single, but I'd buy it again in the future."
""
"D. This is a great beer for the warmer spring days. Its good for the hopheads who want there hops but need an ABV break. I'd grab a six pack, have them on the hammock trail and that would be all she wrote. On the downside the grass notes can be overwhelming at first then (I could imagine) again if you had a couple of these."
"Poured a cloudy orangish gold with good two-finger head and lace. Smell was typcial of a Sam Adams light beer of this style - citrusy, hoppy, not much else as spices and malts are pushed into the background. Taste is more of the same as I enjoyed drinking this, although partly b/c it's easy to drink and goes down smooth. Hops provide a nice bite, and there are some discernible citric/spice hop notes, but this isn't too complex and I can't really say any sweetness from the malts arrives for balance (although I'm not going to call this beer bitter or watery b/c there is some balance)."
"The taste of spring in a bottle. With this releasing right upon the cusp of the Spring season in the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast, it gives the person partaking a smell and taste of a fresh mountain spring. This beer is light, crisp, & smooth. When poured correctly (from a bottle) there is a slight haziness that many beer drinkers welcome. Overall, an above average beer."
""
"Poured from the bottle, the beer produced a golden color with a mild citrus aroma. This is an easy sipping beer on a hot day. The initial taste was an earthy flavor balanced with nice hints of honey and citrus. The flavor was swept away by an aggressive wave of carbonation. It was almost soda quality carbonation. At the end, a lemony aftertaste was left behind. It bordered on having an acidic quality to it. In a lot of ways, this felt like a shandy. However, unlike most shandys, I did not completely dislike this beer."
""
"Really wanted to like this more than I do. Next time I'll grab the Noble Pils, which I like much better."
""
""
""
""
"Sam Adams Alpine Spring: This was the Sam Adams on tap selection at a resort in Phoenix. It has a cloudy honey color with a pure white head that fades quickly. No aroma of note. The flavor is light and fresh, predominately citrus. No carbonation, but I had it on tap, so you never know how fresh the keg was. A good choice for easy summer consumption."
""
""
"Overall: It's not generic by any means, due to the combination of freshness and malt, but I'm don't find this a particularly interesting or deep beer. Pleasant and drinkable though."
"O: Very good and very refreshing light (as in color) beer. Looking forward to seeing this again every spring."
"O- It's pretty good - a sessionable beer with some good flavor and smell. Above average for sure...good but not great."
"Had this in the bottle and poured it into a pint glass. The appearance of this sam adams was good. Nice decent head. The smell was citrusy. The taste was pretty good. The beer had decent carbonation and mouthfeel. Overall, it was a B in my book. I actually couldn't find where the ABV was on the bottle so I am surprised to see that it was 5.5%."
""
"The alcohol was a hair high here but since this style emulates the strength of a Bock, it was fitting that this had just a bit of punch to it. While this wasn't as filling as Hefeweizen and was drier in the mouthfeel, this was just as good and easy to quaff as that style. Sam has a winner on its hands here and it's hard to not envision this being a go-to beer during the Spring."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Loved it for what it is. I would like this to hang around until summer would love to serve at a BBQ and see people's reaction to it. Definitely worth a try and I will be getting more before it is gone. Try it you'll like it."
"Let's not fool many of us. We love beer, and this is one of the best drunk beers by Sam Adams. Goes down delicious from the beginning until the 12th. As a famous drunk once said: ""brevity is the soul of wit"" 250 characters... ... ... ..."

"A tasty spring time beer that looks good and has some nice complexity to it. Would be great with a cheeseburger or a Hawaiian pizza."
"This is a very good spring lager and also excellent for a hot summer day. Very easy to drink with lots of flavor. I could drink this regularly."
""
""
""
"O- Very balanced and drinkable beer that is great for spring or summer. Really nice mouthfeel and refreshing. This is a beer I could drink all day."
""
"Edit. Tried this again in a bottle was no way near as good.I'd give this maybe a 3 in the bottle,big difference."
""
"The feel is crisp and with a flowing smoothness, but a touch grainy and not as clean as it could be."
""
"Overall, this is a nice beer to drink. It would be best suited to spring or summer weather when it is warmer."
""
""
"Overall a very drinkable spring brew. I'm not much on lagers, and the floral nail polish element is there, but it's not bad at all."
"Pours a golden yellow to slight orange color with a one finger white head which gives way to skim and no lace. The aroma is of sweetness with some citrus and a nice honey aroma. The taste has a bready backbone with a slight mild noble hop bite to it, there is also a taste of citrus and then a nice honey flavor at the backend. The mouthfeel is moderately carbonated. Overall I was surprised by this beer, it is a very easy drink and very enjoyable. This would make a perfect spring session beer."

""
""
""
"O) A nice spring drinker that is certainly worth a try, but not a must have seasonal in my opinion."
""
"Overall very drinkable, a little too much on the sweet side. With some more hop bite, this could be a favorite."
""
"Overall- I suppose this beer is good, and could be enjoyed on a hot day. However, the malt is a little overbearing, and the feel does not do its part to make this beer as enjoyable as it could be."
""
""
"Medium bodied, light on the carbonation, sticky, dry."
""
"D: A good, well made beer, but it seems to be lacking something. I like it, I don't love it and would probably not pick up a sixer. At the same time, this would be a good beer to find in a cooler at the beach or someone's pool. Solid beer."
""
""
"A refreshing beer for warmer days."
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a cloudy golden color with a 1 inch head. Smell is of citrus, grains. Taste is crisp, citrus, malts and grains, very refreshing. Feels full bodied in the mouth and overall is an easy drinking and good quality beer."
""
"Single finger thick foam head with lots of lacing on a cloudy light golden body. Strong floral notes on the nose, grass as well. Flavor is also fairly floral with lots of lemon and orange peel. Medium body and moderate to high carbonation. Overall drinkable. Not too complex. A decent beer."
"Fairly decent overall but it didn't knock my socks off or have my asking for another."
"Pale orange gold and slightly hazy in the glass the head is made up of fine white bubbles that lace nicely. The smell is dominated by the peppery and citrus tettnang hops which are backed by bready caramel and pale malts. The hop aroma may be a bit strong for a german lager but I like it. The taste too is dominated by the hops with the pepper, citrus and grassy flavors all coming through. The malt base is assertive enough but could have been fuller as the hops seem a bit overly brash for a lager. The mouthfeel is very crisp, light and refreshing with a clean finish that leaves only a hint of the hop flavors. Overall this is a pretty good beer. I've also had this on tap and think it is better there than out of the bottle as it tastes fresher but even in the bottle it is a great offering for the spring."

"O: This was quite good and fits well in its spring seasonal role. I don't think I would hesitate to pick up a bottle or two next spring."
"Part of the Spring mixed pack picked up in Maui. This is a nice citrusy lager with some fresh hops and a crisp finish. Good choice for a Spring seasonal. I could drink a bunch of these and have a nice grilled piece of fish to go with it. Solid lager that is a little different."
"Overall – Maybe it’s the style, which I am not real familiar with….maybe it’s the Tettnang hops….maybe it’s the fact I prefer porter or IPA….maybe it’s a combination thereof. I don’t know. But this beer, in my lowly opinion, is way too sweet. It would be a good conversion beer for a mass market drinker, or maybe someone who enjoys something like hard lemonade. But it’s not my bag. It has it’s appreciable qualities, but I won’t be drinking it anymore to experience them."
"D - light and drinkable, a good spring beer that almost comes across as an american wheat."
"O - Okay, but boring and somewhat overly refined tasting. I've had worse."
""
""
"Overall, it is what it claims to be, some hop, some citrus, texture makes it a fine Spring seasonal."
""
"O: I'm not really a Sam fan. I appreciate what they do for craft brewing, but consider them more of a ""stepping stool"" between the macros and the crafts. Beers like this make me rethink that. A great brew by Sam. Maybe I should diversify my Samuel Adams experience."
""
"O-this is a nice beer. Wouldn't go out of my way for it but wouldn't mind having this again."
""
""
"I didnt know anything about this beer when i ordered it... it looked like a hefe or a pale ale at first which i tend to stay away from but from the taste i was unexpectedly suprised... Great Taste!! i instantly looked it up online to find out what it really was and am now happy i ordered it... A must if and when its avaliable!!"
""
""
""
""
"O: This was an interesting attempt at a new beer for Sam Adams, but it's not something I'd sit down and drink a couple of. The bitterness/tart is what would make me look for another beer."
"An ok spring lager, but I'd prefer Noble Pils or the kolsch Spring Ale from a few years back."
""
""
""
"This beer is a nice easy drinker for a warm day, a good lawn mower beer."
"O: Overall this is a pretty interesting beer. Tart, lemony, and fresh. A pretty neat beer style, although I am not sure if it is something I would drink a lot of.. although as a spring seasonal I think it will do well."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - This would make a good session. Perfect for a hot muggy spring day. Pretty damn refreshing."
""
""
""
"Pours a hazed golden blonde color, akin to a wit, light, fluffy pillow of head, moderate retention. Scent is pale and leads with citrus, blends with some lightly sweet and faintly doughy malts and yeasts, hints of floral hops come through later in the scent. Taste leads with quick note of watery citrus, lightly floral notes, light doughy bready kicks off the malt and yeast profile, some faint caramel also present. Lighter side of medium bodied, somewhat watery towards the end. A good flavored crowd pleaser, which is what most of Sam's seasonals have become."
""
""
"O- The idea of a unfiltered lager is nice and I enjoy the lemon from the hops. It doesn't have the crispness of a really good lager and the body is rather thin. Its a nice beer and I like to see Boston Beer doing things like this. It's tougher to do smaller niche style than to throw a whole lot of spices in a beer and call it extreme. This is a nice attempt at that."
""
"o - Overall a pretty average beer from Sam Adams. Just not a lot going on in either the nose or taste. Not offensive or anything, but not worth the time. Wouldn't seek it out again."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Expectations weren't high, but this is an average beer and a decent example of the style."
""
"O: Cant say that this is a favorite of mine. Overly salty but if it wasnt for that it would have been pretty good. I enjoyed the refreshing a light body."
""
""
"Not very complex but it does what it says on the tin, so to speak, so I can't really fault it for that. I would have liked a bit more aroma and some more interesting malt flavors."
"D - I got two of these in a variety pack. They will be enough."
""
""
""
"I liked this... Balanced nicely with a nice piney kick..."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this beer is overpowered by the yeast and alcohol really coming through above the other flavors. Despite the citrus smell these flavors don't really play into the beer and it doesn't really bring anything to the table. Very sour and doesn't sit well. Perhaps mine if from a bad batch or so as I don't seem to think it's as good as other people do."
""
""
""
"o: I don't know enough to say if this is true to stlye, but it did seem kind of watered down to me."
"Sam Adams Alpine Springs pours a hazy dark yellow that's almost orange in color. There's about a finger of white foam that crowns the beer, displaying good head retention and leaving a bit of lacing behind. The nose is pretty solid carrying notes of crisp bready malts and lemon zest. The malt in the flavor profile is still definitely bready, but it's a bit more rounded and chewy than in the aroma. There's a light wave of bitterness that comes through mid palate before some floral and lemon-focused citrus flavors provide a nice finish. The beer is nice and full bodied, but the accompanying carbonation is just a little too prickly on my tongue. Alpine Spring is a fairly straightforward beer, but the combination of pale ale like hoppiness, and the smooth maltiness of a traditional lager, results in a tasty, easy-drinking beer."
""
""
""
""
"O: Again, I plead with you, just make an IPA and stop releasing these strange almost IPAs. This was tasty, but nothing even close to special. The Spring mix pack is just a complete miss for me."
"spring beer released in January... this beer expires before spring even occurs. hahaha-"
"Pours hazy golden with a white, three finger length head. The head dissipates slowly, leaving some sticky lacing on the glass. Some bubbles can be seen even though the beer is a hazy. The smell is floral, grainy, and slightly sweet with a hints of bright citrus and some spiciness from the hops. The taste is slightly sweet and grainy and this is balanced by tart citrus flavors from the hops. It's a very bright and crisp taste. The carbonation prepares you for each sip of this easy drinker. It's smooth and the mouthfeel is light. Overall, this is an excellent beer that is refreshing and perfect on a warm spring day."
"Overall one of the better beers that I've had from Sam Adams. While its nothing bold or surprising its the perfect beer on a warm Texas spring day."
"Overall - I was pretty impressed. It's not an overly complex beer or even outstanding, but it's solid and refreshing."
""
""
"overall: A terrific lager. A great spring/summer beer. Perfect for relaxing by the pool or mowing the lawn. Pertty complex, well balanced. Very drinkable."
""

"It pours a clear straw yellow with orange hues with tiny bits of yeast floating. The head is white and fluffy about two fingers thick and lingers for a long time while clinging to the sides of the glass. The aroma is a combination of spice and earthy noble hops with a small amount of sulfur that you would expect from a lager yeast. The taste is comprised of earthy tones, grass, toffee, and a touch of butterscotch. The mouth feel is light-medium with high carbonation and a dry finish. Overall it’s a good pilsner and something I would probably drink if the weather was warmer, but winter is a little too early for pilsners."
""
"A very nice, refreshing beer that would be a great lawnmower selection."
""
"Note to self: Ranked #38 Kellerbier / Zwickelbier when I reviewed this one."
"Drinkability is good and overall really refreshing."
"Overall: tasty and drinkable. I don't feel like I could drink a ton of this, as the sweetness wears on my palate, but it is still a refreshing and tasty beverage."
""
"This beer would be nice for sessioning when playing hookie from work on warm spring days."
"I went into this thinking it was going to be hoppy for some reason but really was surprised and exceeded my expectations at that. Samuel Adams is still one of my favorite brewers even after having tried a fair amount of craft beers."
""
""
"Overall - I enjoyed it. I had been looking forward to trying it. I wouldn't go out of my way to find it but I would order it a bar if the only choices were of the BMC variety."
"Pours a honey gold with a white, creamy head. Strong head retention. Orange and lemon zest and banana bouquet. Soft, slick mouthfeel with prevalent citrus. Finishes with a mild lemon banana. Fun, summery beer. Could Boston Brewing actually be answering the call of their years long undeserved hype?"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Well done."
"pours a cloudy medium gold in color thick two finger white head and lots of sticky lace that both hold up very well. strong bold citrus and a light floral aroma. nice blending of the orange citrus taste with the yeast and hops. smooth medium mouthfeel and slight pepper taste. this beer wins on all counts. i see this beer going a long way with sam adams. definitely one of their better brewed beers."
""
""
""

""
""

"I'll try it on-tap next."
""
""
""
"O - Very impressive complex lager for a seemingly simple beer. Well done Boston Beer!"
""
""
"O - I enjoyed this one. Prominent hop content for a lager, with goes nice with the malts, which surprises me that its not scored higher overall. Crisp and refreshing, definitely something to drink in the warmer weather."
""
""
""
"O - Pretty enjoyable. I haven't had many in this style, and I like Surly Hell quite a bit more, but I would drink this again. It's an easy drinking, but still flavorful brew."
""
""
"D- This thing goes down super easily. A lot like the boston lager but with a bit more of a floral/citrus/mint twist. A nice beer all around but maybe not exotic enough to have me seek it out more than a few times."
""
""
"O: Pretty good, not super complex. Can definitely see this appealing to a more moderate beer drinker. A SA brew to the tee in terms of taste and flavor complexity."
""
""
"O = The hoppiness made it resemble more of an IPA, but I guess the citrus undertones is what makes it a Spring beer. Will drink again, but nothing outstanding"
"Overall: Trying this for the first time it is definitely your warm weather beer, smooth and would love to have this while I am barbequing. Reminds me of a weisen meets your summer ale. Like the both above but different in it's own class. Hope you all enjoy. Salud!"
""
"Pours a very hazy golden color with a large white head that goes down slowly. Scent has some German-like malt profile to it with a bit of citrus and hoppiness. Some grain...very mellow...not too much going on in the nose...all the aromas are very subdued. Taste is quite a bit better. Initially, I get German malt flavors with some light hops and lemon. A hint of orange with some biscuit. Kinda remind me of a very hoppy kolsch. Mouthfeel is light bodied and crisp. Drinkability is very high. Overall, it is a highly drinkable beer that could use a better aroma to make this thing a powerhouse session beer."
""
"Overall I enjoyed it. A little higher abv than the ""average"" and good flavor. This is the second time having it and I figured might as well do a review, so there you have it."
"O - This beer certainly is great if you are looking for something light on a spring afternoon, but the lack of beer-like character leaves me wanting more. Certainly a huge upgrade to the bud light drinkers in your life! I could see myself throwing a few of these back on an afternoon on the lake."
""
"Overall / Drinkability: Very drinkable and I would easily have another. A great looking beer and a very good German-style lager."
"Sam Adams puts out a generally excellent lineup of beers, across the board. Any brewer is going to let a clunker slip through every so often, and so is the case with Alpine Spring. What I find surprising, however, is that this is a major seasonal offering, not just a one-of that didn't work out. The brewer lists some lofty inspirations and ingredients, but here the sum is less than the parts. Grainy, rough and unpolished are the descriptors that come to mind. A distinct raw grain flavor dominates, and the hops are blunt and nondescript."
""
"Mouthfeel has the nice crisp texture that I look for in lagers. Overall, a wonderfully refreshing lager. Flavorful but easy drinking, kind of scary to think how easy it would be to drink a few too many of these in a sitting."
""
"O: Seems like a mix of german styles that is hard to describe, mixed with a bit of american hoppiness. It was decent at best, but nothing I'd buy again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I am not to familiar with the Keller style but this seems spot on to me. Great spring brew from Samuel Adams."
""
"- This is one of the better beers I have had from this brewer. I rarely if ever buy anything from Samuel Adams but to just try. I may actually buy some more of this one. It's a goodie!"
""
""
"Ov: Fun to try but leave it at that. You're better off with Blue Moon if you're craving a citrus kick. This beer fell short considering the source. At $7-10 a 6 pack, it's a little tough to swallow when there are better choices."
""
""
""
"Absolutely delicious and well balanced."
"A smooth drinkable lager. This is a nice spring beer. It gives me an impression of fresh green plants and festivities."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Light bodied with moderate carbonation, this beer is crisp and very drinkable. The body is smooth and refreshing but a tad bit sticky. The carbonation isn't overly noticeable but is definitely helpful in the swallow."
""
"Overall: Alpine Spring is a decent spring lager. I don't love it like I do Noble Pils but it's a tasty lager and and again I like that Sam Adams is trying new styles. I'll be picking up a few more of these this spring."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O. A rather pleasant tasting beer that is very enjoyable to drink. Sam Adams now has two spring beers worth picking up. Noble Pils is the other beer."
"O - I don't think this is a Sam Adams brew that I'd buy again. It's very boring and basic to me. The flavor profile tastes of nothing but Lager yeast and a pinch of hops, and the smell is very similar. I'd drink it again but I'm not buying it again."
"O- Easy drinking, but nothing special. Seems like a decent summer beer."
""
"O- I didn't know what to expect, but was pleasantly surprised. I like this quite a bit more than Sam Summer Ale, likely due to the more pilsner like qualities. Certainly glad this will be around even in non-craft beer friendly establishments through the spring."
""
""
""
"I was tempted by the label's notice of citrus flavors and unfilteredness - two qualities I like in a beer. I was not disappointed. The beer poured a nice golden-brown, with a fine head and a slight lacing. The mouthfeel was just the right carbonation, the aroma just fine, and a pleasant additional taste of sour grain remnants."
"12oz. bottle served in a tulip pint at 52 degrees. Best before June notched on the label. Pours a dull, light, tangerine hue with a semi-hazy clarity and a loose, quarter inch, cream-colored head. Nose expresses citrus zest, a noble hops presence and a slightly metallic aroma. Taste consistent with nose; however, there is also a distinct earthy wheat character with a hint of cereal grain sweetness at the finish. Also the metallic quality detected in the nose is not present in the flavor profile. Mouthfeel is medium-light with a lively, almost crisp carbonation and a pleasant, easy acidity. All and all, of the few Keller biers that I've tried, this one does not seem overly style consistent. That said, I have to say that I've really quite enjoyed this beer the few times I've had it so far. It's easy drinking with just enough character to make it satisfying."
"O-Overall, I really enjoyed this beer as a spring/summertime beer so much so that I am going to attempt to brew a beer like this for my wife because she likes it so much. I had to buy a six pack of it after trying two in the mix twelve pack. I highly recommend this beer for people who live in a warm climate right now, get it while it's fresh. Cheers everyone!"
""
"This is a fantastic beer that may not get the praise a beer this balanced deserves. I'll be buying another case or two of this before the spring is over."
""
"Overall a great spring/summer brew, one with a nice citrus wheat taste that is very refreshing, especially on a hot day..."
"Pours a golden yellow with a medium off white head, good lacing. Aroma of sweet biscuit malt, lemon and citrusy fruity notes and some light floral hops. Taste is sweet malt, citrus, some light yeast, lemon peel and some nice peppery floral hops. Palate is a medium body, crisp mouth feel and lively carbonation. Finish is sweet malt, citrus and lemon peel notes, fruity, with some light spicy bitter peppery hops on the end. Overall a nice drinkable brew for early spring."
""
""
"Huh... alot better than i thought. I was expecting something plain and cost effective replaement for noble pils. This has a super thick body for a lager. Huge head retention. No much aromas as expected with a german style lager. Flavor is full of herbal like flavors. Very earthy hops. I might like this better than noble. Well done... SA has really perfected the lager style beers. Well done and saved me at a regular sports bar. Thanks sa"
""
"Served in a 22oz frosted mug. Cloudy and golden in color with a creamy white head. Smells great. Fresh citrus hops a plenty. Palate is refreshing and tasty with a good malt base and strong citrusy hop flavor with low bitterness. On tap, this is a great beer that suprised me a bit. I wasn't expecting this level of flavor and aroma. This should stay in the SA portfolio, in my opinion."
"Overall, this is a nice beer for this time of year I suppose, but it just seemed lackluster to me."
""
""
"Overall: I was very pleased with this beer, very refreshing, would be great on a hot summer day as well."
""
""
""
"O: this is better than I expected, nice and refreshing, nice balance of flavor"
""
"Overall, not half bad."
""
""
""
"The palate opens with a mild doughy and honey-like sweetness, along with some fruity flavors (melon in particular) . Mild but firm hop bitterness is present, especially towards the finish, which also has some lemony flavor, with nice balance. Moderately yeasty as well. Over-carbonated to a fault, this aspect ruins what could be a good beer IMO. And when it does dissipate, it takes on a sulfury note, and a rather slimy feel."
""
""
"That said, I went to Summit EPA for my next beer, so not good enough to keep me interested in a second."
""
""
"Pours a slightly hazy orange peel color with a 1"" cream colored head. The head recedes leaving scant spots of lacing in my glass. It eventually falls to a thick film across the surface of the beer. The aroma is of tangerine, a touch of grassy hops, some malt sweetness. In the taste I detect a touch of honey sweetness, and a bit of grain. The hops don't jump out as much as expected, they are subtle and grassy. Towards the end of the sip I get some of that tangerine flavor from the smell. The aftertaste is generally sweet, but it leaves a slight bitterness. The body of the beer is thicker than average, with light carbonation. This beer has a decent amount of complexity, but it is deceivingly subtle."
""
""
""
""
"Another spring home run for the boys in Massachusetts. A cloudy golden beer with a frothy head and active carbonation. Head is smallish and lace is a bit light but that could also be due to the cold serving temperature. Malty nose with orangey citrus notes and a healthy amount of yeasty dough. A smoothly inviting aroma. Taste is a continuation and wonderful progression of the nose. Big malt front with a bakery display of breads and rolls on my tongue. Hops are expertly done with a gentle amping up of a traditional Keller but not in a way that leaves the style. This is a superb take on the style. Finish is clean, artfully hoppy and balanced. A light dryness in the mouth lingers with faint bread notes. Feel is crisp and creamy at the same time. Smooth swallow as well. A great beer and I hope to see it again but just in case I am buying some more of this to savor."
"Overall - The history of this beer style is pretty interesting and I'm glad I tried it.. but I won't be buying another case of Samuel Adams Alpine Spring."
""
""
""
"D - It's simple, but it's built well and it's an easy drinker. You could do easily do worse."
""
""
""
""
"While I haven't had many of this style, this is not selling me on keller or zwickel beer,which isn't a surprise since I'm not a fan of the light German lagers in general. But, I keep trying new beers regardless of this knowledge. This one is just a swing and a miss. Maybe at the next at bat."
""
"O - This has good drinkability. The flavor is good, and there is a nice refreshing quality to it. Overall, It think this is a nice beer. It is my first keller bier so I can't really comment on how close to style it is, but I look forward to trying more of this style. I recommend trying it out, it's worth a shot."
"Medium-bodied with modest carbonation that lets this beer flow smoothly across the palate. Finish is dry."
"Pours a cloudy golden color with a finger of white foam. A touch of spicy hops with just a hint of citrus. Decently floral as well. A lot of yeast contributions, notably pepper and maybe even a hint of banana. Bready malt makes up the rest. The flavor is a bit bland. It has a strange lemony note on the finish as well. Some notes of floral and spicy hops and maybe some bread/malt flavors."
"o 4 so far, no major flaws have appeared, as they have with the whitewater ipa out of the same mix. the finish is a touch astringent, lemony, and grassy, but not as annoying as the spices or whatever they put in the whitewater. not something i will crave, though."
"The beer pours a hazy straw color with a white head. The aroma has some straw notes, as well as a little bit of grass and lemons and some biscuit malt. The flavor has some pilsner and biscuit malt, with some low bitterness and some earthy and grassy hops. Thin mouthfeel and medium carbonation. Very easy to drink."
""
""
"Pours a cloudy golden yellow color, nice carbonation, nice little fizzy white head, with some minimal sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, yeasty, some floral notes, citrusy. The taste is malty/yeasty, a little sweet note, kinda fruity, and some nice citrus notes. Medium body, a nice smooth brew. Not a bad brew, would be great on a hot summer day."
""
"I poured from the bottle into my glass and was greated with a finger and a half of white foam. This faded slowly to nice lacing. The color was a cloudy, but bright golden hue. The nose was full of orange and citrus hops that faded to sweet malt. The taste was along the same lines with crisp citrus and orange hops fading to the sweet malt. The mouthfeel was full good with plenty of carbonation that tickled my tongue and a medium body that clung to my palate. I like this seasonal a lot. It smells and tastes of bright hops and malts... It's like spring in the bottle."
"Overall this is nice interesting beer to welcome spring, enjoyable and refreshing."
"This is the type of beer which often doesn't get any love from beer snobs, but I must say that I found this beer to be one of the tastiest ""sessionable"" beers in recent memory. Two thumbs up!"
""
""
""
""
"This doesn't have a ton of flavor but it is relatively balanced, with a little more hop and spice than I usually see for the style. Definitely heavy on the bready ester type malts. The texture is surprisingly smooth and this goes down pretty easy. Nothing to write home about but a decent interpretation."
"O: An interesting new spring seasonal from Sam Adams. Nowhere near as full flavoured as some of the great Kellers I've had from Germany, but this is an enjoyable effort for sure."
"C+"
""
""
"Nice brew, I know I've said refreshing a few times already, but this brew is certainly that. I could see myself enjoying many of these in the summer heat - but it's also enjoyable in the dead of Smarch too. Worth a go."
""
"Gold in colour and lightly hazed, a gentle pour produced an inch of dense, off-white foam that lasted quite some time. Tons of sticky lacing at first, less as the glass emptied. Citrus was evident as soon as the cap was popped. Aromas of pils malt and oranges, a bit floral and grassy, slight breadiness. Lemon bitterness up front with honey-sweet malts following. Citrus and bread, slight alcohol and herbal hop flavour. Medium bodied, moderate carbonation, decent texture. I enjoyed it, particularly the fresh citrus hoppiness and malt character."
""
"O: I still love this beer. It's probably a bit better on tap than in the bottle, mostly because of the mouthfeel. The taste, smell, and appearance is similar. Really easy drinking and pair well with most foods. A great Spring beer."
"O: Much better than I expected. This beer hits the spot without being flashy or in your face. No problem having a couple of these."
"Overall it's okay. It's not awful, but I don't think it's good either. A step of from their last spring offering Noble Pils (awful). Still say the old white ale was a great spring beer from Sam Adams."
""
"Taste is much stronger in flavor than I would have thought, starts out with a strong grainy malt front, citrus creeps in to dominate the aftertaste, carbonation is soft but active, finishes semi-dry."
"overall a desent effort. not exactly what i'm looking for when i want a keller bier, but pleasant enough, and seems pretty sessionable, or perhaps if it had a few ticks lower abv."
"Overall, I am quite happy with this beer and I do find it to be quite enjoyable, however it may be a little more amped up than others like it."
""
"Frankly I took notes at the bar at lunch with absolutely no idea what classification this beer would fall under. Did not expect a Kellerbier - a style I enjoy in its traditional form - and very much enjoyed this American interpretation. Well done Samuel Adams!"
" The lager tastes very fresh with hop oils coating the mouth and leaving a nice lemony noble hop flavor which is somewhat floral too. The malt is a backdrop giving mild toasted sweetness and it finishes with a light spiciness. Overall I enjoyed this, maybe not as much as Noble Pils, but this is a very refreshing lager with a good amount of hop flavor, nice drinkability for the strength"
"Overall, a sub-par effort from Samuel Adams. Things just don't seem to mesh very well. Glad I got to try it but probably won't seek it out again."
""
""
""
"Deep orange in body with white bubbly head. Lovin the aroma: citrus, floral notes, light lemon, and dew on evergreens. Tastes of light citrus, floral notes, harsh lemon zest, slight alcohol burn. Light in body with medium carbonation. Great aroma but some of the flavors are intrusive and harsh."
""
"Wow, this is a party pleasing, buy by the case brew here. I could easily down this stuff all day. A perfect summertime or really anytime brew. This is a great brew for SA, and will be a regular one to session for a lager. Great stuff here."
""
"Super easy to drink, light, good taste, hard to complain about this. A really enjoyable sessionable brew."
""
"Overall: a very friendly and easy to drink beer. Nicely refreshing and has a nice overall flavor."
"Poured into round bowl mug. Hazy orange with a natural milky white head, never really leaves, stays thin and filmy throughout. Smell isn't much at all but a faint acidic orange and lemon juice. Taste also has juicy orange, orange peel, lemon peel, clementine and a little citric spiciness. Very nice light feel, one of my favorite sam adams beers"

"T: This was a really nice surprise for me. A rich graininess throughout with a good touch of lemon and citrus. Very refreshing and easy to drink without tasting too light."
"O: a decent beer, though one of the best lagers I have had"
""
"O: a decent brew from SA. Mostly easy going and drinkable, has a decent wheat beer taste that is flavorable, but not as tasty as some other SA brews available"
"A good lager but it doesn't really bring much else to the table from other Sam Adams lagers for me. Solid spring seasonal but I prefer different SA beers."
"O - Not too bad. It really helped to knock down some of the heat from my wings. I would have no problem drinking a few of these once warmer weather comes around."

"It is a beer i would recommend to someone that usually drinks ""lite"" beer and to someone who does not enjoy american style hopped beer."
"Overall- I truly enjoyed this beer, and, even though this is not my first choie in types of beer, I will be adding this to my beer fridge for friends and family when they come over. This beer is very good from beginning to end and matches with so many different food types I think you would be safe ordering this with almost anything that would be on a bar menu. I think spicy wings would be calmed by the citrus and the hops. I think a burger with onions and mushrooms would be cleaned from your palate by the carbonation of this beer."

"Came to me in a Sam Adams perfect pint, or whatever the hell they call their Boston Lager glass. Hazy medium golden hue. Smells of slight hops aroma, but mostly wheat and malty notes. Taste was actually pretty complex. It didn't have what I like to call the usual ""Sam Adams taste."" Started off like a traditional wheat beer with lighter notes and grassy tones, but then some malt came through. Ended with a slight hops kick, but not much at all in among the sweeter malt profile."
""
""
"Taste is a citrus burst - bitter lemon and grapefruit and sweet orange - giving way to a slightly sweet malt. It finishes with the sweet sour earthiness of a Belgian. A nice wake up for the mouth with some intense flavors, but it leans a little too much to the sweet side for me to seek it out again."
"Yet another solid seasonal offering by Samuel Adams. The flavor profile was unique. The brewery took a chance with a style that is not well known or readily available."
"Had Alpine Spring on tap at Mary Carroll's in Huntington, NY. This golden-colored cloudy but not too cloudy offering has good carbonation and head. As this is a new style for me, I have nothing to compare it to. Light citrus and herbal smell. The taste leans more toward lemon and orange than grapefruit, which pleases me. The hops add aroma rather than bitterness here. In addition to the citrus characteristics, there is a good amount of malt sweetness, which is pleasantly balanced by some tartness. I'd consider this almost medium-bodied. Certainly lively and drinkable - give it a try, I say."
""
"overall - 5/5 - Quite an impressive complex lager for a seemingly simple beer."
""
"The pour created just over two fingers of eggnog-colored head with good retention. Color was a slightly hazy golden-yellow. Nose had a lemony-citrus quality along with a dry crackery maltiness. Mouthfeel was medium and the taste was light, dry and citrusy, a perfect counterpart to that wild DIPA that preceded it. I am amazed that a style this ancient is making a comeback, but this is a great time to be an aficionado of beer. Finish was dry, lemon citrusy and just a nice, mellow, pleasant beer all around. I wish that they would put this in CANs as I am planning at least one trip to the shore this summer and I gotta fill that coola somehow."
""
"Pours a hazy pale yellow with an off white head. In the aroma, light citrus and small lager like tones. In the taste, a small, sweet earthiness to citrus like flavors, with small lager like undertones all the way through. A small bite and a lighter bodied mouthfeel, with a dry yeasty and small lemon citrus like aftertaste. Small earth and citrus with lager notes, it feels like a saison and a lager had a baby."
"Overall: My first beer of the style and I am pleasantly impressed. An overall nice spring beer that I'd be happy to order another 22 oz. mug of."

"Poured this Zwickel Bier from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. This beer pours a hazy golden color and produces a thick white head , nice retention and excellent lacing. The aroma of this brew is fresh, full of citrus flavor, malted barley and some piney hops. Medium in body, this brew has a base of malted grain, with some citrus and hops. Unfiltered yeast also lends a unique flavor. My first Zwickel style, i have to say i was impressed."
""
""
""
""
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a 14 oz ""pint"" glass. Pours a cloudy straw color with a 2 finger white head that leaves nice lacing on the glass. Smells of sweet woody honey type smell that is quite pleasant, but not overly strong. Has some nice grassy notes in the taste along with a decent, but not strong hop taste. Goes down smooth with a good medium body and proper amount of carbonation. Overall, a very good brew and a nice addition to the Sam Adams family."
"I'm ok with a single, but glad I didn't have more. Just ok. odd balance. Still, ok."
""
"O - This would be pretty great for a summer beer. A little weird to get it in February, but a good beer none the less. If I was making this myself, I would add some hop bitterness and just a touch more flavor, but this fits the style."
""
""
""
"Pours a slightly hazy golden straw color with a bone white head that slowly recedes but leaves much lace in its wake. Smells like quite a bit of citrus and earth on top of biscuity malt. Not horribly complex in the aroma. Taste is a mix of biscuit malt again with lots of citrus and earth. Almost tart lemony flavor with a thin malt backbone of biscuit and pilsner? Thin body with a moderate to high level of carbonation and an almost sweet watery mouthfeel. This might make for a good lawnmower beer, but by the time spring rolls around this will be two seasonals ago in the Sam lineup. I’d rather have a Noble Pils really."
"O - There were a lot of flavors in this one...I just wasn't a fan of the whole package...this would be a very nice spring time beer though"
""
""
"O: Solid offering from Sam, not too not worthy. Seems kinda like a combo of the Noble Pils and Summer Lager. This would probably taste better in may than june. On tap its pretty solid though."
""
""
"O - I generally like BBC and appreciate their seasonals. Just didn't like this. Now, I did get this at Chili's and they freeze the hell out of their beer. But even letting one warm up just didn't work. I'll pass."
""
"Pours a hazy golden amber with a finger of white foam that falls to a quilt of the same. Nice frosty lace. Smells of grain, hay, some corn. Not getting the citrus everybody seems to be raving about. The flavor is sweet with grain and grass with a little sweetened lemon zest, and some earthy yeast. Mouthfeel is the best aspect of the beer, slightly heavy with moderate carb combines to a velvety, unobtrusive body. Above average, but not that great."
"Didn't know anything about this beer going in and was expecting it to be a bit lighter, but ended up enjoying it anyway. The lemon zest along with citrus is a good representation of spring and the malts and hops seemed to play nice togther. Not the greatest of the style I've had, but very drinkable."
""
""
"Cloudy deep yellow with a sharp citric smell. The taste is more sharp citric--orange, lemon--with an herbal and hoppy bite at the end and honey malt. The honey malt actually became more prominent and sticky throughout the glass, which causes me to mark it down a bit. It's nicely zesty but does feel unbalanced."
"Pours our a hazy golden color with a tiny head. It smells of bready malts, bright citrus and hops, and a bit of wheat. The taste really hits you with everything at once, with the bready malts, bright citrus, and fairly up-front but still bright hops. A bit of a lagery malt taste comes in the middle, leading into a long bready finish. The mouthfeel is nice, and the drinkability is good. Another winner from Sam Adams, but I can't help but feel this is just a better version of Sam Summer."
"I'd take this over the typical white ales and wits most brewers release in the Spring every time."
"O: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, mild kick, good representation of style, it tastes like a light version of their previous year’s spring seasonal Noble Pils. Overall it’s a decent beer to pound down for a long time."
"O-Perfectly drinkable brew that I would purchase again."
""
""
""
"Pours to a thick fluffy white head, moderate lace and cloudy gold color. Aroma is sweet, citusy and grainy. Flavor is a nice lend of sweet malts, Tettnang hops and subtle yeast esters. Mouthfeel is light and pleasant, medium CO2. Overall, this is a pleasant ""new"" old beer style we can all enjoy en masse."
"Medium bodied with soft carbonation. Honestly seems a bit heavier than I would like. Overall another solid brew from Sammy. Real enjoyable."
"Overall, not a great beer but definitely enjoyable, a bit light for my liking but decent flavor."
""
""
"Overall: The aftertaste made me think of water with lemon. It's so inoffensive and mellow it doesn't really do anything positive or negative. I'd drink it in the summer."

"As a Kellerbier I really like this. Had this on draft, but it was chilled way too much. I would happily drink this all Spring & Summer"

""
"Overall: I'm a fan of most of Sam Adams' offerings, but this one just didn't do it for me. It tasted watered down, and all of the flavors were somewhat muted. I barely got any of the ""citrus"" notes that were advertised. It was certainly drinkable, but I probably wouldn't seek this one out again."
"Was hoping this would have a bit more character, it is more of a substitute for a mass market Super-bowl beer really. So glad this wasn't a permanent replacement for Noble Pils which is exponentially more flavorful while still being subtle and balanced."
"Simply solid and enjoyable. Not mindblowing, just good."
""
"Pours clouded lemon yellow body with nice but short lasting white head. Not much lacing. Scent is lemon grass. Taste is zingy lemon, citrus, honey. A little bit acidic, but very nice overall."
""
"A very nice addition to the Sam Adams lineup. This is a very enjoyable beer to go along with the transition from winter to spring. Almost tastes like a Sierra Nevada Pale and a Vienna lager combination."
""
"Rich body with plentiful carbonation. Well balanced with a clean, mildly sour malt start. The hop bitterness is notable but not overpowering. Lightly creamy. Easy to consume more than one."
""
"Pours a slightly hazy, gold color. 1/4 inch head of a white color. Good retention and good lacing. Smells of pale malt, hint of sweet malt, hops, floral, and a hint of yeast. Fits the style of a Keller Bier / Zwickel Bier. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of pale malt, slight sweet malt, slight hops, floral, hint of citrus, and a hint of yeast. Overall, good appearance, body, and blend."
""
""
"O: Overall, it could have been a good solid 4.0 from me, but at $9 for a sixer, there are similar or better beers close to this style and quality that are a bit cheaper. I'm not complaining too much though, as I am enjoying everything else about this beer, and it certainly bested my expectations. I'd drink it again, I don't know if I'd pay $9 for a 6-pack of it again, but I'd be happy to drink it again if offered."

"Alpine Spring is a pretty good release from Boston Beer Company. It’s rather simple and straight forward. If you’re looking for complexity, look elsewhere. For the most part, it performs pretty well all around. I think I’d prefer a little more citrus and a little less grass. Just an observation. It’s pretty good though. Definitely worth checking out."
""
"One of Sam's best offerings in a while. It doesn't have the punch of Noble Pils but it's a keeper. Nice job Jim."
"Overall- I was really shocked at how spectacular this beer is. It truely is a wonderful beer. Similar to the Noble Hops but has some slightly different characteristics that are very nice."
"O - Alpine Spring put up a valiant effort; it came out swinging but went down in the second round. Samuel Adams tries to do this obscure style justice by brewing it but, the lack of flavor and body signify to me that this seasonal won't be back after it's departure. I will say though, while the haze might scare some less beer educated people, they'll love it's high drinkability!"
""
""
"O: If they could work out the soap taste here, this would be very nice. Well, I thought that this was going to take the place of Noble Pils, but I've now learned that that one is going to be a year-round venture. Thank you BeerFMAndy for the correction. You and BeerFM know everything ""beer!"""
"Drinkability- It was actually really good. I really enjoyed it more than I thought I would. Very nice"
""
""
""
""
"O - This was my first Zwickel (or Keller) and I enjoyed it greatly. It falls somewhere between a Hefe and a Pils and fans of either style should be sure to try this Sam Adams release."
"Very good. Highly recommend"
""
"Poured from a 12oz bottle into an SA glass. Color is dark straw with a two finger head that slowly receded into a thin cap. Skinny, thin lacing down the sides. Smell of malt and biscuits with a trace of pepper. Smooth, slightly phenolic taste is the first thing that registers then glides into something bready. Mouthfeel is light-bodied with little aftertaste. What is there is in the very back of the mouth. A nice, clean, crisp brew that neither surprises nor disappoints. Will imbibe again. Cheers!"
"Trying a bottle of Sammy A's Alpine Spring. The beer pured a yellow color with thin white head that is lacing. The smell includes floral tones with hints of clove and banana. The taste is floral push with light citrus, clove and banana back up. The mouthfeel is light in body with good carbonation. Overall it is a decent beer...as usual from Sammy A!"

"GO PATRIOTS!!!"

"I had this on tap tonight with dinner, served in a SA perfect pint. The beer is a murky orange, small white head, minimal lacing. The aroma is grassy, herbal. The beer is slightly bitter, smooth, grassy. The finish is crisp. It drinks very easy, very smooth. I did not know much about this beer, smelled and tasted like a pilsner, but darker. I like the unfiltered aspect. IMO a nice addition to the SA lineup."
""
""
"Overall: A pretty solid take on a German lager. Crisp and well balanced with a nice lemon flavor."
""
"O - A clean down to earth beer. It is great as a Spring seasonal. It reminds me a lot of a crisp spring morning."
"I only had Noble Pils once and I know it's not going away, but this seems to be a great replacement. I'm glad Boston Beer chose an underrepresented style and made an approachable but not dumbed down beer."

"*American OWNED that is..."

"I'm a novice to craft beer, but have found Sam Adams' brews to be quite good -- namely the flagship Boston Lager and the Noble Pils. I find this new beer to be the perfect change of pace beer. I don't detect much in the way of hops, but again my tastebuds are just learning the ways of craft beer and I put my trust in Jim Koch to give us newbies a beer we can enjoy on any occasion."
"I don't know, this beer seems to be lacking in the taste. It was tasty with the first sip or so, but then the taste started to get boring. A very nice looking beer and the aroma was nice; those were really the only good attributes to this Brew. This isn't even remotely close to being tasty and easy drinking as Noble Pils. Not a total waste, just not worth the hype."
"Drinkability: Highly drinkable, perfect spring/summer brew. I'd recommend this beer to anyone who is wants something different than a pale lager. Perfect type of ""gateway"" beer."
"12oz bottle with a Best Before Date notched at July. Pours translucent golden color with a thin head. Minimal lacing. Aroma is of sour citrus, grains, and slightly floral. Taste is alot less hops and alot more malt than I expected from the smell. Bready and a bit sweet with some lemon peel at the end. Some floral hops bitterness, but not much. Light and crisp. Easy to drink. I am noticing somewhat of an odd floral soapy aftertaste the more I drink it. Overall, I think im all set with this one."
"Opinion: Overall, I have been pretty happy with this beer both on tap and in the bottle. I would be nice if the bottle version was a pleasing to look at as it was on tap. The draft version kept a respectable head on it pretty much the whole glass. The bottle version dropped pretty quickly. Otherwise, I like the showcase of hops that coexists nicely with the malt in the finish to give you a balanced flavor to linger long after the sip. I would go so far as to say that of Boston Brewing Company's ""regular""/sessionable beers, this is one of my favorite so far."
"Very refreshing. Good mix of clean and grainy. Good looking and went down very smooth. I will be drinking more of this for sure."
"12oz bottle purchased as part of this year's spring mix-pack. Pours a hazy yellow body with a good inch of off-white head that persists. Fruity spicy hops dominate the aroma. Orange, pineapple, and spice hit the palate initially, with pine, spice, and citrus pulp notes. Light bodied with ample carbonation. Very drinkable. Pleasant, refreshing, and tasty. I like this one."
"O: good for the style and good for me, I think I could get into this beer"
""
""
""

"The beer pours a cloudy golden color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is decent. It has a crisp, pilsner malt scent along with a moderate hop bitterness and a slight fruity yeast aroma; refreshing. The taste is decent as well. It has a yeasty flavor that compliments a solid malt bill of mainly pilsner malts. The hop character is mild yet lend itself nicely. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a damn refreshing beer. I like the unfiltered yeast character. The esters add a good bit of depth."
"More tropical fruit notes with citrus splashes. Light, easy drinking and enjoyable stuff. will make a decent warm weather quaffer...as soon as spring officially hits. Not bad. I'd def pick up a sixer or two of this in the future."
"M: Very little carbonation but a pleasant medium body."
""
""
""
"O-Not a bad beer at all really, and I was quite surprised at the taste and quality of the beer."
"Overall meh, the only decent quality is the noble hops, otherwise weird flavors and pretty meh. It almost seems like they took the summer ale and noble pils and blended them to make this beer. Although it is fairly drinkable, for a spring beer maybe makes sense, but should be a late spring beer, not 1.5 months BEFORE spring beer."
"Pretty descent. Has that classic Sam Adams taste. Fresh tasting and very drinkable."
""
"this beer is getting better and better with each drink"
"Pours a hazy murky yellowish orange with a 1 finger head, decent lacing a nice retention. Smells of oranges and lemons all freshly cut, a touch of earthy grain and banana bread also. Lemons on the tongue nice light bready malt on the back, citrus all around, a tad lager funk to boot, not too bad. Light-medium in body and feel, has a little more to it than it looks. Overall, this is a decent leading to spring lager, though i think this could be alot better if the flavors were a little more prominent."
""
"Sampled on January 30, 2012. I had this on tap at an Olive Garden restaurant. It pours into a frosted glass a slightly cloudy, but very foamy light to medium amber. The aroma is of malts but more of grains and all in all rather subtle. The body is in the medium range. The taste is also more on the grainy side but it finishes clean, crisp, and slightly dry. It is not too bad and I expect it will be popular with the masses this spring."
"Very excited to try this one,especially after a rough day working outdoors in the rain. I thought alpine spring was going to be noble pils with a different name. It wasn't but there's a hint of it in this brew. Bartender poured into a pint glass while I eagerly waited for the foamy head to reduce to quarter inch. The smell of lemon was evident and the first taste was thirst quenching. I could taste some citrus and light hops. This brew is full bodied but yet light on flavor. Carbonation is good and lacing on the empty pint is art work. Gotta get another and I had the third pint when my food arrived. This is my session beer for the season. ABV is 5.5% but its hardly noticeable."
"Very nice brew! I was hopping for a little more citrus but hey this thing is balanced to the gill. Nice golden color full of carbonation a little cloudy look very inviting, smell was bout average notes are kinda of light on the nose. Taste the beer is perfect with the balance that it has, mouthfeel smooth clean and crisp, overall a great spring beer!! Fire up the Grills!"
"This beer pours a hazy golden color. The head is one inch in height, and recedes slowly into a half inch of bright white foam that last until the beer is gone. The aroma is of bright spicy hops and bready malt. The taste is maltier than the aroma with a ton of bready notes, and some spicy hops in the background. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with a velvety texture, and moderate carbonation. Overall, this is a fine keller bier that I can see becoming a regular in my refrigerator while it is in season."
"O: It's nowhere near the upper echelon of the Sam Adams portfolio, but it ain't half bad, folks. If you're a lemony/citrus guy (or gal), this is a worthwhile tick. Not one I'll be seeking out again, but I in no way regret spending $3 on the bomber."
"Taste-Pale bread malt,orange rind, faint honey note. Nice flavor and balance. kind of reminds me of a Bell's Oberon without the spicy hop notes. Would make a nice late spring warmer weather brew."
"drinkability/overall- I have to say this beer was an enigma to me and I still wouldn't fully know how to explain it to someone I guess partially its just not a style I am very familiar with, wouldn't particularly say i loved drinking it but I didn't hate it either, almost just very bland and simple and that made it drinkable if not totally enjoyable, not a beer I will revisit but worth a try in terms of uniqueness alone"
""
""
"D- way to showcase the tettnanger hops. Their bright flavor really holds this one down. Jim and the boys have made some amazing German style beers lately and I hope they keep em comin'."
""
"O: Easy to drink beer that will definitely be fantastic on those nice cool Spring days. Very refreshing."
"Overall, this is a good beer. It doesn't blow me away like Noble Pils does, but this is a fine Spring seasonal beer. Frankly, lots of smaller breweries will release Spring seasonal lagers that are much worse than Alpine Spring."
""
"Lightly toasted bread and honey notes up front. Sweetish, with faint fruit notes. Bright, zesty, peppery hops dive in and provide a very refreshing lift. The hops become more floral and herbal, with light bitterness. Finish is moderately dry, with lingering honey bread dough malts. Medium-bodied, with a very creamy, smooth feel. One of the creamier lagers I've had (maybe due to the unfilteredness?). Very drinkable and would make a nice warm weather beer. Will buy more as spring gets nearer."
"Overall, good, probably perfect in summer, and though refreshing not dull or thin."
"O-i love this style but i think Sam Adams once again missed the point. the grassyness is there...which i love, however there are some off flavors there and a weird creaminess that makes this beer taste more like some light american ale than a true german lager. i'll give it another shot i'm sure, not completely turned off...yet."
"O: a very well crafted beer that makes me want to further explore the Keller Bier/Zwickel Bier style. Would make an excellent session beer. Great with food."
"Overall, a pretty tasty brew that I would have again."
"This poured out with and impressive hazy orange color with a very nice looking white head on top. The lacing and retention on this beer were very good as well. The smell of the beer gives off some citrusy lager like aromas that are interesting. The taste of the beer has a citrusy start to it with some nice refreshing qualities, the finish is similar to a wheat beer in my opinion. The mouthfeel is a soft, well carbonated and drinkable. Overall this beer wasn't bad, I would probably drink it again."
"Poured on-tap and served in a tumbler pint, the beer is a hazy, unfiltered, pale, yellow-orange coloring with a sparse coating of film. Good solid lacing along the glass as the beer moves around. Aromas are very light, with a slight lemon zest and clove spicing, but not much of anything else. Flavors are roasty and toasty, with a grainy cereal backbone, and some extremely subtle hops and citrus tones. The hops take over into the aftertaste, with a dry, peppery profile. The finish is slightly dry, with a hint of cloves left behind. Aromas and palate are weak overall, but the body and finish are well put together. Could be a good beer with a liitle more ""oomph"" on the palate."
"Murkey, straw-like color with a moderately sized head. The aroma is restrained...clean, but some grass and grain...a touch of yeast and pale malt. The beer is flavorful and fresh...a little tart. There is a little fruit in the flavor, orange and apple, but it's essentially a clean beer. Medium-light in body. The beer has a notable malt sweetness that continues through the taste. Not much hop bitterness or flavor, just a little for balance."
"Alpine Spring succeeds in retaining good hop flavor while staying light and crisp. Perfect to drink while eating or enjoying anything outdoors. Seriously. A great hop-forward taste with the clean crispness of a lager? Yes, please."
"Overall- An all around decent lager, but for some reason I'm just not digging this one. If you absolutely have to, by all means pick one up and give it a try. Personally, I don't plan on revisiting this brew anytime soon. Cheers."
""
""
"A nice mix of hefeweizen and lager with just enough hops to make it citrusy and enjoyable. First adventure into the Keller Bier/Zwickel Bier style, so if Alpine Spring is true to form, then I think I’ll enjoy this style and seek out more of these beers."
"On tap as part of the World Beer Tour. A 10-oz pour was golden straw with a white foam cap. Mild citrus nose, a bit of lemon. Taste was citrusy, orange-lemon honey, fruity hops, clean finishing almost but not quite juicy. Medium-light yet creamy body. Higher carbonation. Refreshing. Pretty good."
""
"Overall – A decent beer, though not one that I would revisit in the future."
"Absolutely perfect. I just which the aroma was slightly more prominent."
""
""

""
""
"Picked up a bottle at Euro Market. I get a little kick of fruity hops in the opening of the flavor, but for the most part it comes off like smooth, bready Dortmund export lager. It's a hazy light orange color with a short white head. It's clean and nice enough, but not distinctive. Meh, I want to like this beer, but just can't get excited about it."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Light and refreshing with a perfect mouthfeel for this type of beer. Could use a little more complexity or oomph, but few can take the Helles / Zwickel Bier and make it really great, so can't knock it much."
""
"An interesting style for the brewery to tackle but I don't think it hit the style spot on. My first 6 pack will be my last."
"O - Like a lot of Sams... not bad, drinkable, but definitely left me wanting more flavor, and especially aroma. I'm not sure if it is fair to compare this to Noble Pils; but NP is head and shoulders above this beer."
""
""
"Clean and refreshing in the taste as well. Sweet, then tart like lemons. There is a grassy taste as well that gives it that clean, refreshing side. Decent little bite of hops in the back that give the sweet/tart thing some balance. Wheaty malts that create a solid backbone. Subtly complex, despite the refreshing qualities, with a nice balance througout. Juicy in the middle and dry in the finish, effervescent texture near the end from a higher carbonation. This is a good one from BBC and a welcome addition to their seasonal line-up."
"Overall I thought that was a pretty average beer, since I have never had this style before I really didn't know what to expect but what I got was a little boring and didn't keep me entertained, I don't know if this was a bland attempt at the style or if they are suppose to be like that. It did have some pretty good drinkability and I have no doubt that this would make a pretty refreshing summer beer that would be easy to drink a lot of, but right now it just doesn't hold my attention and make me want to grab another bottle. What I liked most about this beer was the mouthfeel, it fit this beer nicely and was just what it should be. What I liked least about this beer was the bland flavor and aroma and the lack hops, mainly of the citrus variety, if it had some more hops it would help balance out all those dominating bready malts. I wouldn't seek this beer out, it just doesn't stick out to me. If you want a smooth easy drinking warm weather beer this may make a good choice, but to me it isn't that interesting. This beer was very middle of the road with nothing about it being memorable. As a whole I wasn't too impressed with this years brewers choice pack, all the new beers seemed pretty lackluster and it's safe to say that I enjoyed the old beers in this pack more then the new beers, I guess I was just expecting more from their brewers choice pack, I hope the next one turns out better."

"O - I have never had a lager like this before. It would be great on a warm summer day by the pool."
""
"Overall: Head retention suffered from the hop oxidation and each quaff brings back the skunked impression. Again will need furthur tastings to give a final recommendation."
"Hazy straw-yellow to orange color with plenty of thick, cream-colored head and good retention. Pleasantly malty aroma of bread, caramel, and grains with a nice touch of floral hops. The flavor is exceedingly smooth, a touch sweet up front with notes of lemon, coriander, and floral hops. The finish is drier and deliciously malty. Medium body, just a tad too sweet I thought. Otherwise, a pretty great beer for Sam Adams, and it definitely blows their last spring selection out of the water."
"This is an excellent lager, and a really unique style. Well done Sam Adams. Something I highly recommend."

"As advertised, a citrusy sweet unfiltered lager. Would like a little more bitterness to balance, but overall a proficient execution of what BBC was trying to do."

"This brew is all right, but kind of americanized for the style. Perhaps better as a wheat beer with a malted wheat base instead of pilsner malt."
""
""
"I rather like the beer as it's flavorful, zesty, and boldly spiced with hops while allowing for a nearly sessionable ability. The orange, grass, mint, and thin caramel taste makes me think 'Pale Ale' and want something more."
""
"Sampled in January 2012 despite being labeled a Spring seasonal release. Regardless of weather conditions this is a delicious beer. I will certainly be buying more of these."
"Alpine Spring is a solid Helles Lager. Although I will miss the Noble Pils (I know it's year round now, but how many bars have a Sam Seasonal tap as the only good choice?), I will still be happy to drink the Spring seasonal."
"Taste is sweet, rich, and fruity, I get more tones of honey than anything else, though. Somehow not as light as I'd have liked. I don't get a lot of balance here. Not a big fan of this one."
""
""
"O: I am usually a huge fan of SA lagers and while I did enjoy this one, it is probally my least preferred of the bunch. The honey malt detracts from this beer in my opinion. It covers up the base malt flavors which are my favorite part of pale lagers. If they booted the honey malt and maybe added a little more base malt I have no doubt I would love this beer."
"O: This is a really nice beer. A quick drinking, really smooth perfect reflection of the style and I'm once again pleased with a Samuel Adams brew."
"Nice light citrus hop up front, bit of a sweet malty body to it. Smooth mouthfeel with a crisp aftertaste. Overall, an excellent beer, perfect for a day riding around on the lawnmower."
""
""
""
"Flavor is simpler with a sweet citric start, then a bit buttery/honey like in the middle, yet finishing rather dry and with a fair hop spice to it. Carbonation keeps well through the glass. Feel is decent for what it's trying to be and a bit fuller than many a German styled lager."
""
""
"Atmosphere is really good here. Great appearance with a great head, including a nice residual, good color, and lots of lacing. Nose is basic, but a nice grain. Flavor pretty basic, too, but well-balanced, crisp and refreshing. Overall, this is a really good quaff."
""
""
"O: Good balance of hops and malts makes this a very sessionable beer."
"T: starts off with light hops at the forefront; several seconds later a prominent buttery flavor develops, along with the wheat-base profile; quite surprising, and notes from the previous commentators suggest that the two-wave thing is universally detectable. Balanced between sweet and bitter; not very complex, but the change in flavor will keep you interested"
"O - a very refreshing beer from a brewery I'd never really been too impressed by before"
"Served from bottle into a mug. Poured a pale golden yellow with a one finger white head that subsided to a minimal amount slowly. Maintained nice lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, wheat, grain, banana, and spices. The flavor was of sweet malt, wheat, banana, spices, and subtle fruit. It had a light feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this was an okay brew. Nothing on this one really bashed me over the head where I needed to go back for sip after sip, but it was quite easy drinking. There were no harsh flavors going on here which made it easy to drink. Just wish there would have been a little more to it to push it to the next level. Worth trying if you get the chance."
""
""
""
"12 oz bottle. Pours hazy golden with a thick, long lasting white head. Nice aroma is of citrus fruit, biscuit malt and noble hops. Medium, smooth body. Bready malt, citrus fruit, light hops and musty unfiltered yeastiness fill the mouth. Finish is long and balanced. As usual, nice session lager from Sam Adams."
""
""
""
""
"Overall:Very refreshing. Light and flavorful. I will pick up more of this for Spring."
""
""
"O - As with most Sam Adams beers, this is a solid brew but could use a bit more flavor. An enjoyable beer that is a good choice on tap at those restaurants that only have macros and sam adams seasonal."
"O: a real good job by samuel adams here, clean and great tasting, i loved noble pils but i think this is a more than adequate switch over"
"Taste is very carbonated and sharp. Mouthfeel is chewy and nice. Malty honey flavors dominate which is pretty nice. Overall its decent but nowhere near as good as noble pils."
"Overall an interesting take on a classic style."
""
"Overall – pretty good brew! Surprisingly rich and interesting."
""
"On Tap, I got very slight hints of a hop character, but it honestly tasted like an unbalanced popcorn lager. I would have liked more sweetness and slickness, but dried corn."
""
"Overall: Better than I was expecting. Very sessionable. A good replacement for Noble Pils. I think this one will do well for ladies who like lighter-tasting brews and the men who follow along their mountain paths."
""
""
""
"I like this beer overall. It goes beyond the classic pils quaulities, yet stays within the parameters, oddly enough. Worth checking out..."
"Like It? I Do"
""
"Overall- Very drinkable and I will definitely be adding to my rotation. I hope there is some left this spring so I can enjoy it when I fire up the grill."
"I really appreciate the thought that went behind this ""concept beer"" as it is a melding of some of my favorite German styles! A must try for anyone who appreciates a beer with superb balance, character, and a nice change of pace!"
"Pours a nice medium golden with a fluffy white head. Excellent retention, and a nice lace. Aroma is of bready, malts, with notes of orange and lemon.Body is medium and carbonated. Taste is Malty up front with bursts of sweet/tart fruit through out. Crisp, but earthy finish. Liked it a lot!"
""
"O- a nice offering for spring very easy to drink and i think i will be drinking more this spring"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Approachable and drinkable, this would be nice of a cool Spring day!"
"The beer reminds me of a beefed up Kolsch. A bit of a hoppy profile with a neutral flavored malt"
""
"If I go back to the Brickhouse again I will definately seek this beer out, but I can't image it would be as good in a bottle."
"Typical of sam adams, this beer looks good on paper, but fails in execution. Yeast profile on this is typically unclean Sam Adams lager profile with a slightly tart, estery taste and finishes a little cloying as if grains of paradise or other spices were used . Flavor is reminiscent of indian coriander - with froot loops like citrus dominating. Malt profile is a little biscuity which is welcome to offset the tartness and citrus profile, but ends up coming off oddly weird, unclean, and unrefreshing. Might be a decent summer beer, why the hell you would release it in January is beyond me."
"Update 01/11/13: Second foray into this beer. Not much has changed. Added to the description, gave a slight bump into smell and overall, and that's about it."
""
"This is an easy-drinking lager. Interesting mix of styles within the lager family that works well. Nice use of Tettnang hops!"
"O: Good. A nice spring bock - if only they'd released it in April or May maybe I'd buy a sixer of it instead of the single that I purchased at Price Chopper tonight (January 19, 2012)."
"O: Really enjoyed Sam Adam's newest seasonal offering. Extremely easy to drink and sessionable. Wish I hadn't just picked one from a mix-six."
"This is a solid beer. It was too style so nothing out of the ordinary to report. It's unoffensive and very easy to drink."
"Tan to slightly orange, hazy, 1 finger head with some staying power, pretty good lacing. Smells of grains, malts, plenty of citrus and some nice hops. Taste is pretty bold on the citrus, with a good bready, malty backbone and a nice, light hop profile. Some sweet honey fullness brings home the nice and surprisingly full body. A very tasty surprise, I'll certainly have this one again."
"Pours a rich golden color, soapy white head and some lacing. Aroma is bready, with a lager yeast strain evident. In the taste, grainy, sweet cereal notes and some lemony citrus. Mild noble hop bitterness, and hop flavor lingers on the palette. Easy to drink, but overall pretty average."
""
"O: not very impressed with this one i prefer the noble pils to this spring seasonal. a good beer to have with some spring cleaning i will say"
""
"Overall:Very refreshing. I could have several pints of this. I love the sweet and slightly piney combo. This is very smooth. This may be their best spring seasonal yet."
""
""
" It smells and tastes like this beer has almost the same hop and malt profile as Noble Pils. Grassy hops dominate the aroma and taste. I feel like the malt bill is a bit more developed here in contrast with NP. Thicker in body, still grainy but also a bit sweeter. Clean all around, excellent drinkability and flavor. A winner from SA."
"Love a new Sam brew. This one's okay. Not as good as the White Ale."
"O- Admittedly I had low expectations for it, but this was a delicious simple beer."
""
""
""
"Feels mildly carbonated with a medium mouth feel."
""
""
"O: C+ I guess. It's a party beer for me. Drink some in the sun etc. Like a lot of Sam Adams stuff."
"Poured a 2"" velvety white head with decent retention. The body is a little hazed but bright golden yellow. There's really not a whole lot of smell and although I do get the citrus it's not the most obvious of citrus beers. The taste, to me, doesn't deviate that far from BMCs. Not too complex, some faint citrus per the label, and a crisp lager finish. There's nothing wrong with this beer, it just isn't the standout I for some reason was expecting."
"12 oz single from Roths Sunnyside Market, S.Salem. $1.42 Nice hazy golden yellow beer with a small yet persistant white head. Good wheat,spice grassy hop aromas. Taste lemon zest,malts,yeast.hay,wheat..very nice. Great palate..very good for style and rather smooth. I really enjoyed this beer..a little to early on the mrket..this is a killer spring beer."
"O – A pretty much unremarkable lager from SA. Not great, not terrible. Somewhat refreshing, but nothing I would ever buy again. On a side note, I remember SA's old ""Spring Ale"" tasting a lot like this, minus the dish soap."
""
""
"Overall - A refreshing beer with a bit higher alcohol content and more flavor savory smells and tastes then the typical refreshing beer (say the typical american lager). I think I would very much enjoy this come spring; after a nice meal, while sitting outside at a picnic table."
"Despite all the label claims and descriptors that would make one thing this is anything but traditional, i.e. such a unique maverick type of beer, I found it to be exactly what I expected: a decent SA beer as part of a variety 12 pack that would be relatively mild in all aspects."
"Purchased ina mixed case however I was curious and would have purchased a sixer or single bottle to try. Pleasantly surprised by the crispness, well carbonatd. Cloudy orange in appearance foam head dissipates rather quickly but not a factor. Slightly sweet but not too, Noble Hops may have tamed that slightly. Liked the unfiltered part, maybe not a January beer but very tasty and would dring anytime. First time I believe I have experienced the Tettnang hops. Overall a good go to beer."
"This to me tastes like a lager version of their Summer Ale, which I'm not real fond of. It doesn't state that there's actually any lemon in it, but it sure tastes that way. Definitely more of a summertime offering in my opinion."
"This was a huge surprise from Samuel Adams. I'm generally a fan of most of their offerings and am always excited to try something new from them. For me, this is a welcomed ""spring"" seasonal (although we're seeing it in January but that's another discussion) that I'll be sure to grab a six-pack of for the appropriate weather."
"O: This would be a perfect spring/ summer beer. I really don't get why this came out in January, but I actually really enjoy this."
"I wasn't really expecting much from this beer. It came in the variety pack, with some other good stuff, but some okay stuff, but honestly this beer is much better then I thought it would be. The unfiltered aspect of it makes it similar in some ways to a hefeweizen, and the nose of it is actually a bit similar too... sort of a citrus, lemony, honey type of smell to it. The taste is light and sweet... actually very much like honey... I feel like for 5.5% this goes down incredibly smooth and hits the spot. Carbonation is well suited for the style. I would say this is on the upper tier of some of the Sam Adams stuff I have had."
"I'm not blown away here. I don't think this is a go to beer, but it has a good flavor and I think it will go over well with noble pils fans."
""
"Overall this is just tolerable. It would be better if the brewer had picked a style and stuck with it. Sort of a Duck-billed Platypus of a beer."
"I can't say I'm terribly familiar with the style, but this is a fine, sessionable lager."
"A hazy golden orange color with a white head. I don't take much from the nose, just smells like a pilsner, grainy and dry. Taste is snappy and bright. Citrus notes and bready upfront with a dry honey-sweet finish. Overall a great light spring beer that I would recommend."
""
""
"O- Not really digging this one at all."
"Not too bad for a simple lager, but not great. It seems like in trying to incorporate the characteristics of three different German styles it got muddled. I can't help but compare it to Noble Pils, which I much preferred."
"Pretty light mouthfeel, easily drinkable beer. Smooth and watery."
"O - This is interesting. Not what you expect in a Munich Helles Lager. It seems like it would be better as a summer season not a spring seasonal that debuts before Martin Luther King Day."
"Not bad but not good enough either. It seems like they were trying to make a lighter version of helles to appeal to a select audience."
"Beer is grainy and harsh, with a rough cereal finish, mildly hoppy, thin on the back, strong aftertaste. Corny, not really feeling this one."
"Mouthfeel: medium-light body, light carbonation, crisp texture"
"O: The beer has a very good balance between malts and hops and has some flavors that are reminiscent of a maibock."
""
"O - While I will miss the usual SA spring offering ( the spring ale from the last few years) , this is a solid helles offering, and makes for a good session beer. Also, would make more sense in the spring/summer, verses a January release."
"O: I cannot wait to buy a case of this. When it was gone, I wanted more. I could drink 5 or six of these. I wasn't even planning to review it, but I had to after I drank it. Sooo good. I would buy this year-round (**hint-hint** BBC)."
"Overall, Alpine Spring is nice and easy on the palate. I'd like a bit bolder flavor and, maybe, a bit fuller texture. It is, however, a nice beer to have a few of with friends on the back porch. Once released in the proper, i.e. Spring, season."
""
""
"Easy drinking. A balanced beer. A bit filmy on the end."
""
""
"It was a tasty beer, but one I would call nothing more than an introduction to the style."
"I have long been unsatisfied with Sam Adams spring offering. This year they have turned it around. Alpine Spring is the perfect beer to get you from the dark, full bodied beer that is Winter Lager to the light citrusy taste of Sam Summer. I don't love this beer, but I really like it -- hoppy front and clean citrus back -- It's safe to say that Sam an I will have a second date before summer loving begins."
"A good session beer."
"O: This is another quality beer and I wouldn't expect less. The noble hop flavor in this beer mixed with the citrus provides for a really good spring beer."
"Notes: Aroma, mouthfeel and taste are all a little off. The Hops are too floral the mouthfeel is too grainy. The taste is not pleasant. Won't repeat this one."
" I take my hat of to BBC, since they managed to produce a beer that comes close to what I might call a ""home brew"" or true, ""small batch"" taste. I'm not sure what quantities they produce for this beer, but they have done a good job in giving it that ""craft brew taste."" My bottles were particularly fresh and fresh tasting. This is January, so I doubt there was much heat damage or light damage to the ones I sampled. Good glass lacing as well."
""
"O: I really think this is more of a zwicklbier than a Munich helles lager because this is a tad yeastier and brighter than most authentic helles lagers. Still, for an unfiltered lager, it's not bad, and one has to applaud the Boston Beer Company for attempting to market such an odd beer to mainstream drinkers."
"Light body and medium carbonated. Good beer that I would drink again but way off on the category. I don't mind pushing style boundaries but this is very similar tasting to Noble Pils. Good beers both, but its not a Helles. The malt is on but the hops is a little out of control for the style. More of a zoigl beer."
"Pours a bright golden hazed orange glow, kellerbier style lager. Light colored head slightly off white, fine even lacing texture is great creamy foam all day. Aroma has a sturdy hop character with fresh cut grass, citrus zest, and herbal notes as well...mineral water floral spring notes with a wave of biscuits freshly baked light golden crisp drizzled with a touch of honey malt sugars. A pretty sweet and malty lager up front with some citrus and finishes with biscuit malts and honey sweetness really maibock like in the flavor. I miss the dry Noble hops and a bit lighter body, this one has more girth to it than the last spring seasonal. There has to be a low level of hop bitterness I'm guessing 20 to 25 tops on the IBUs, carbonation is smooth and yeast flavor tends to stick around between sips since it's pretty much suspended in the beers appearance. Overall, a fine spring-summer seasonal that is being consumed as fresh as possible smack in the middle of a big ol' January snowstorm!!! Why not?"
""
"Poured a hazy golden orange color with a huge airy-frothy shape holding head. Beautiful lacing. Aroma is super bright, smells like a warm weather brew. Smell is lightly floral and grassy with lemon peel. The taste is pleasant enough with some floral hops and citrus but overall i'd say this is too sweet! Overall flavor could be more interesting. This is a munich helles lager that pretty much tastes like a blue moon. So ""helles"" means bright huh? Well this is bright. Too bright. The malt aspect is there just kinda flavorless and sweet. Feel is a tad thin.This might be refreshing if it were summer. Its definitely not summer. Not bad tho."
"Overall, this is a home run from Sam Adams. There aren't that many helles lagers brewed domestically, and this is a style that simply does not travel well, so having one available fresh is great. Many smaller breweries simply don't have the capacity and necessary equipment to give enough time to age a well made lager, so this is something Sam Adams definitely has an advantage with. The BBC does a great job with lagers, and this is an excellent addition to their lineup."
""
""
"Pours a foggy yellow-gold with a puffy white head that fills the glass to the brim before dropping to a solid covering. Floral noble hop aroma upfront with some grass over a bit of pale, honey-like malt. Nice German hop flavor...grass, hay, and zesty citrus and some doughy yeast. Not so much in the malt department. Light bodied, dry, and very quaff-able. This is a fine spring seasonal from Sam Adams that I wouldn't find seeing year-round. File this one under: Kellerbier."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This german style unfiltered ""pilsner"" is a far cry from what we're all used to from Sam Adams, but its a nice solid change. You still get the constructed put together aspect of Sam Adams, rather than letting the ingredients work naturally, but i enjoyed the attempt. Gets better as it warms up."
"Overall Drinkability: A good relaxing beer. A nice session."
""
"O/D-I like Noble Pils better. This is a mediocre substitute. I enjoyed the nose a bunch, but the actual flavor let me down a bit. This is not a bad beer (far from it actually). But I immediately toss this one into the large bag of Sam Adams beers that are unmemorable, mediocre, and uninspired."
""
""
"I hope this isn't the replacement for SA's Nobel Pils. That would be sad..."
"D/O: This beer has a little more appeal than a punch-soaked dough ball, but otherwise the comparison is apt. It heralds few of the refreshing qualities one might expect from a beer themed for Spring, and nowhere is that more evident than in the lifeless smell. Malt is the focus here, but bready yeast surprises by also finishing ahead of the minor hop qualities. Do not expect in this beer another fresh-crisp, American-craft pilsner like Noble Pils. Even lighter lagers have range on the malt continuum, and this one seems to oppose that other beer."
""
""
"This American made lager is nothing less than just a good clean beer. I hope this becomes a year around brew!"
""
"The feel of this beer is medium to light bodied and is a really nice drinker for a spring beer."
"O - a decent brew that might taste better as the weather warms up."
"I can see where this would be easy drinking and have some mainstream appeal with the light sweet malt flavors, but a bit disappointing when I was expecting more of a hoppy citrusy lager. I don't want to beat it up to bad, it is fairly close to style, just needs a hops."
"3/3.5/3.5/3/3.5"
"glad to see another new and delicious Sam Adams Lager. sure, it's not the crisp hop-fest that Noble Pils was, but it's a fantastic well-balanced lager all on it's own. recommended."
""
"This beer pours a light bodied bright gold in color with an ever so slight cloudiness and a white lacing around the glass. The aromas feature a mix of must, slight honey, pale malts, and an ever so slight hop bitterness. It's ok, nothing stellar and doesn't give off crisp or fresh aromas. The flavors feature the same flavors that the aromas provided. In the taste you get more honey and pale malt with very little bitterness. It's kind of bland. There is some light citrus though. It drinks light bodied and smoothly, but I'd prefer more of a crisp bite. Overall this beer is pretty average for the style. It doesn't really differentiate itself from German beers of the same style."
"12 oz bottle. Pours a cloudy yellow-orange. A medium head with good retention and lacing. Aroma is apricot, bread, and lightly sweet malts. Surprisingly good aroma for a lager. The taste is really beautiful. Not too sweet with grain and floral hops as the primary taste. Nice spicy finish. Would prefer a little dryer finish, but the palate is clean in less than a minute. Texture is very nice. Light body with a creamy finish. Medium-low carbonation. An excellent offering and really rather unique. The closest cousin in the Samuel Adams lineup is the Summer Ale. The summer Ale has the grains of paradise and is more lemony. Both are refreshing and different. I love the unfiltered characteristic in this lager. It's a hit with me."
"Overall, this is a pretty nice lager, one of the better Sam Adams beers I've had in a while."
""
""
"Great Spring Session Beer!!!"
"Poured into a 13 oz tulip glass. Pours a hazy gold, a half inch of white head, leaves some lace. Smell is tangerine, grass, clove, and a touch of honey. Taste is that with a big zest of pine and lemon in the finish. Body is good, could drink a good amount of these, nice carbonation, and very refreshing. I like it, will definitely have on draft this winter. Still prefer the Pile, but this is solid."
""
"Good beer and will definitely be an easy seller. Crisp and refreshing. Kind reminds you of fresh laundry. Decent though."
"I picked this up at the Hy-Vee build a six-pack. I was impressed with the 3 fingers of foam that almost overflowed my glass. It went downhill from there. The aroma was a mix of grain and grass and a hint of citrus. The taste was just confusing. There's a small wheat element with some orange, but there's some odd dryness to it that I found rather off-putting, like they threw some dust in the kettle. The body is good for the style and has a crispness to it. I'm glad I only got one bottle."
"Overall - Very tasty, almost reminds me of a triple with the floralness of hops and the pale malts. This is pretty impressive for sam adams, a beer full of flavor and character. Impressed, would buy agian."
"Beauiful creamy head on this beer, nicely capping a pale golden but hazy colour underneath. Nose is quite appetizing with miscellaneous floral and herbal notes. Palate offers some slightly sweet malt flavors and a nice zinging hop profile to round it out. Medium bodied and amazingly drinkable. Reviewing to style, wow this is a great beer."
"Very tasty beer that would fit nicely in the late spring/early summer but is tasting just fantastic in early January as well. Would be a real nice BBQ beer....shit bring this and noble pils for the day and you are set."
"Pours a cloudy copper color with a moderate fluffy head. Scent if rather grainy with a lot of earthy tones with some mild citrus. The taste has a strong unfiltered characteristic as you take in a blend of semi-bitter hops, crisp malts, and floral hints. I found this to be more of a slower sipping beer than most of their other beers due to the complex taste and texture from the unfiltered process. Complex, unique, and delicious."
""
"O -- Overall, this is a well-made, highly drinkable beer, but not a great representation of the Helles style. There are aspects that remind me of SN's Summerfest, but the SN is more rounded and clean in flavor. While the graininess in this beer is appetizing, it deters me from a higher rating due to how the beer is being advertised."
"A home run."
"Gotta love perks of the job, especially sample bottles. This one pours a cloudy gold topped by maybe a finger or so of white foam. The nose comprises heavy bread yeast hanging over light lemon and sweet flowers. The taste comes in pretty similarly, though the yeast is now joined (and somewhat cut) by some wheat. Very lager-y, as some might say, but not bad by any stretch. The flowers really come through big time. The body is a hefty light, with a light moderate carbonation and a pretty smooth feel. Overall, a simple but highly enjoyable little Spring drinker. Right on, Sam Adams."
"Mild and bready, light grassy bitterness, lemon and doughy yeast flavors. Lightly dry residual bitterness that hangs around for a few moments. Light bodied, slightly fuller feel due to the added yeast. Smooth feel, easygoing carbonation. Something i'd drink again, though Noble Pils is still a favorite."
"Overall Drinkability - Good all around. No major flaws. Could be a bit more refreshing."
"Taste falls apart for me, the honeyed malt falls squarely in between a watery floral hop flavor and a flabby bitterness at the end. The taste overall has no flow and is a total trainwreck of a beer. I rarely have trouble finishing a sixer of anything, but this one I was happy to be able to pawn off two of the six bottles and will surely never, ever buy this atrocity again. Shame on you BBC. If this replaces the Noble Pils I will be sorely disappointed."
"Pours out a hazy yellow color with a creamy looking head, slight lacing. The smell is citrusy, some herbal hop smells in there like a pilsner. Also has a sweet smell from the malts. The taste has a tangy citrus flavor, with some herbal notes with a slightly sweet finish. Hmm, finish can be a bit dry as well. Interesting. Anyway mouthfeel is kinda prickly from the carbonation. Overall this is a good brew but not too remarkable. Wish they would have taken a bolder route and had the Whitewater IPA as their spring seasonal. This beer is too much like their summer seasonal."
""
""
"Whether this is a Noble Pils replacement or not, I hope that I enjoy it next year, and not be disappointed with it as I was Noble Pils the second time around."
""
"overall - whats the point of seasonals when the spring comes out 7 days into winter - at least they put it on the self and not waiting collecting dust aging in the distro warehouse"
"Had a bottle sample of this at work the other night,I guess it's taking the spring seasonal spot next year with the Noble Pils becoming year around.Poured lighter hazed golden with a well formed 1/2 finger sticky white head atop.Some honey malt in the nose and that is basically it,faint lemon as well.Sweetish honey flavors at the onset with some firm toasted grain flavors,a smattering herbal hops in the finish with faint lemon.Not bad I think it is a good selection for a spring seasonal,its lighter but with a little substance."
"Drinkability is awesome on Alpine Spring. It is a great beer for springtime. It has some really good tastes and flavors to it, but they all balance out really well. The balance makes this an awesome session beer. Sam really did well with this new seasonal.."
