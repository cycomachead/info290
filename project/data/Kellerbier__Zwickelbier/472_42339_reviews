"O: This beer seems to be a little lighter compared to other Kellerbiers but is still quite flavorful and a good representation of the style."

"O - This is a decent beer. I am not overly familiar with the style, so I am not sure how it compares. It is a bit sweet for me, but not a bad way to start my Sunday."

"Local market just got this in and I figured I would try it. Pored it into a mug from the bottle. Resembled caramel in color. Very very smooth with a full body taste. A little bit of a sweet finish. Definitely worth going out of your way to find and try it."

"Toasty aroma,malty with some mineral essence also. Feel is crisp and slightly sharp, though it smooths out quickly in the end. Pouring in the yeast adds a bit of fullness to the body. Toasty, nutty malt flavors, a hint of dried fruit leather in the aftertaste. Pretty drinkable, a nice traditional take on this historical style."

"The beer is medium-bodied, with medium-low carbonation, that results in a super-smooth and semi-bubbly mouthfeel, which is just a pleasure to drink. Finishes semi-dry, with modest stickiness across the palate."
"O: I enjoyed it, though it doesn't have the overall complexity I've found in others of its style. Worth a pickup though if you like kellers."
"Got a swing top from EuroMarket for $3.50. The hopping is pretty mild, but there's a gentle spice in the finish and balancing bitterness. It's a maltier lager up front, with toasty biscuit, a hint of caramel, and clean grain. The hops build slowly in the finish with a citrus edge, but otherwise this is just a pleasant, balanced (and hazy) lager."
"T/M- Again coriander,but it is smooth for drinking,unique Bavarian hefe style."
"Despite high carbonation, rather uncommon in Kellerbiers I have encountered before, it enhances the taste in an interesting and pleasant fashion. I certainly liked it and would buy it again."
"Nice experience."
"I've been trying examples of Kellerbiers when I find them here in Germany. An interesting style that produces a lot of flavor for modest alcohol."
"Leikeim Kellerbier has a strong bite with all the carbonation, and is very refreshing. This is a great kellerbier, and is now one of my favorites."
