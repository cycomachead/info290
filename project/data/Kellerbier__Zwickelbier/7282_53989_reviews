"A very unique tasting beer.  Fun and tasty to try."

"The beer is unimpressive, though not bad. But for the price it isn't something I'd buy again."

"A beer that would benefit with a lot less age. I can see when fresh it would be a good beer. With over a year on it, it's well past it's prime."

"Brown in color with a slight reddish hue. Poured with a short off-white foam that reduced to a wispy cap. Earthy, light roasted malt aroma with notes of dark fruit, herbal hops and yeasty tartness. Medium bodied with a lightlyp crisp finish. Light roasted malt flavors up front followed by earthy grain and yeasty notes. Herbal hop flavors from the middle to the end. This was advertised as an Octoberfest the way the German's meant it to be - which was not the case. Certainly different."

"O: I really liked this beer. I was on the fence when I purchased it but I'm glad I did. Taste was much more complex than the nose. Rich toasted caramel, spice, tobacco what more could you ask for."
""
"O: So this is Hofstetten's attempt at re-creating the beer brewed for the wedding of King Ludwig I; the first Oktoberfest beer. I'm really digging it. A raw, very yeasty, unfiltered fest-style beer. It's as quaffable as they come."
"Really enjoying this beer. Though it doesn't taste like other Kellerbiers I have tried, if you dig the style you will dig this too."

"O: This beer doesn't break any new ground, but it is very well made and extremely drinkable."

"Overall a good beer. Good for the night. I'd say a good apple pie would pair well here"

"The mouthfeel is medium bodied with carbonation being a little above average. Overall, it was a very solid beer of the style. Very clean, crisp and flavorful."
""
"I don't always drink beer, but when I do I go to Beer Advocate, stay thirsty my acquaintances..."
"Had this on tap in a half liter marzen glass. Served with a inch of off white head that fades but laces. Overall taste is malty, caramel sweet breadiness with smooth earthy hops. Reminds me a of a marzen and definitely worth checking out if you like old style german lagers."
""
"D - Oddly, this seems more like an English winter warmer than a German beer. Even so, it is quite pleasant, if not overly complex, and it is certainly drinkable enough."
"O - Great balance and smooth flavors, an enjoyable German style celebratory beer."
"The relative richness of the flavor presents an intriguing contrast with the lightness of the body and the texture of the beer. It also dries out significantly in the finish relative to the sweetness levels of the midsip. This brew has certainly stoked my interest in sampling more Kellers in the future."
"Mouthfeel is pretty nice- medium bodied, somewhat delayed moderate carbonation (at first it feels smooth and then becomes a little prickly). This is a nice one- I would certainly get it again and I imagine that it would go very nicely with some pumpkin pastry/cake of some variety."
"Not your average Octoberfest but very drinkable regardless. The smell is almost of an auld ale nature, with hints of smokiness. Yet the taste is very different: easy to drink, smooth, balanced, malty. You know you've had a pretty good sized beer when you're done. Worth trying."

"Poured into a Celebrator pokal. Pours a slightly cloudy medium coppery amber with an active half finger off-white head that dissipates slowle to a thin film which has good retention, no lacing. Pleasant aroma of caramel malt, light stone fruit, and aromatic herbs. Flavor of toasted and bready malts, mild dark fruit, somewhat sweet. Finishes with mild malt, apples and light hops. A quite nice flavor progression and great flavor combination. Medium bodied. First European example of this style; glad to have tried it and looking forward to drinking this again."

"Very good beer! Poured this at a good temperature with a large, thick, foamy, cream-colored head that slowly settles and a little lace. Color is an almost clear, honey amber with some bubble trails. Aroma is a fresh, volatile mix of malt, hop, toffee, yeast, a little fruit. Flavor's like nose, on the dry side, with a little residual fruitiness; carbonic tang and yeast/hop bitter are all up front and work well together. Body is excellent - has a softness that is checked by great carbonation. Finish is like flavor, of average length, and is super drinkable. Could drink the hell outta this one."

"Pours a ruddy orange with no head beyond a thin cap of bubbles; slightly hazy. The smell is grain, something like lavender, clean well water. It tastes woody, with notes of sweet grain, some faint dandelion sourness, and has a thickly bitter finish. It's a tad thick and fairly viscous, but that's offset by a fine and sharp carbonation. A well made beer, if perhaps a little heavier than need be."
"M: Low on the carbonation, which is nice. Dry and crisp. A bit sticky."
""
"Poured from a brown 16.9 oz. bottle. Has a dark brown color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of malts, caramel,sweet. Taste is a good balance of bready malts and hop bitterness, some caramel. Feels full bodied in the mouth and overall is an enjoyable beer."
"Pours a cloudy brownish amber with a medium lasting beige head, Aroma is of toasted malt, barley, yeasty and bready notes with some dark fruity esters. Taste is toasted caramel malt, barley with some yeasty fruity notes. Palate is medium body with good carbonation. Finish is sweet toasted caramel, barley, yeasty and bready with some dark fruity flavors and lightly hopped. This brew has a nice well balanced malty character. Overall a very good easy drinking tasty and enjoyable brew."

"Overall, a solid kellerbier, right alongside this brewery's Kubelbier. Enjoyable malt and hop components along with some pleasant esters and residual yeast flavors. Would gladly have again."
""
"Not a bad dunkles Kellerbier."
"O: A pretty good beer. I've not had many representations of the style, but this is clean, tasty, and enjoyable."
"O: Classic octoberfest. The only thing that could make this beer better is to be drinking it in Germany."
"Overall: I liked this one. I hadnt seen if available before but I will be going back for another one soon to try it again."
"Overall not that great but certainly not horrible. Other Kellers were more interesting to me, but I could have this again no problem."
"D - Wonderful collection of flavors in this beer, and the fact that it is unfiltered is a nice touch. I've been a big fan of this brewery for a while, and this it a great addition to their lineup. It's a little cost prohibitive to be your sole beer for an Oktoberfest session of drinking, but it's a great place to start. The only thing I would personally change would be a slightly crisper finish. Still, it's hard to blend complexity and drinkability, and I feel this beer has done it better than an other Oktoberfest I've had this year."
"While nothing spectacular I suppose, this was still a pretty tasty beer."
"Poured from bottle into dimpled mug. An interesting beer. Deep amber pour with a thick white head. A little bit hazy. Good looking beer. The nose is a little bit herbal and woody with a bit of light hoppy spiciness. There is a decent bit of bready/crusty maltiness on the back of a nice fresh continental malt flavour. There is a massive, distracting metallic flavour on the back that is brutal. It completely ruins the impression I had. It would have been pretty nice without it, but with it there it's tough to take."
"D: The beer isn't that difficult to drink but I couldn't see having more than one of these in one night."
"D: I love kellerbiers because I know I'm always going to get an interesting brew, this is another one of them."
"This was in a wooden cask that was tapped at the Bier Garden's Oktoberfest celebration. A dark auburn brown body with a two-finger tan head that died quickly and left little lace patches. Has a bitter hop smell as well as some oakiness, natch, and a touch of spicy citric notes. The beer is smooth and creamy thanks to sitting in that cask but still has a sharp twinge from carbonation. The malt base is sturdy and gives off breadiness and a touch of sweet caramel - the hops are dominant and there is a citric, spicy taste that is crisp that dominates the beer. Was enjoyable and worth a try."
"Now this an odd beer,it is a zwickel/keller beer for sure but it also has some fest beer qualities to it,making for an interesting hybrid in my mind.Poured into a half liter stein a hazed copper color with a nice fluffy white crown atop that left broken rings of lace as it settled.Toasty with caramel and anise spice in the nose,not much presence but the malt qualities are distinct and nice.Quite dry and toasty at first on the palate with some of that central European iron-like quality,then some honey and caramel malt creeps in the finish.I like this beer but I cant define it,a hazed marzen/fest beer maybe?"
"Drinkability is just average, I could probably slam a few on a hot day, but would they be worth it?? Probably not!"
"Not bad but it's obviously not a great example. Passable at best."
"D: My first beer of this style, that I'm aware of. I really enjoyed it... definitely easy to drink and something I could have two to three of."
"D: This is a nice beer, my first of the style. Was highly reminiscent of a pilsner but a heartier malt backbone."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, mild kick, good representation of style, this is nice milder beer with a good amount of flavor and substance to make it worth drinking for a while."
