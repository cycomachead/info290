"It pours a nice translucent straw yellow with a thin white head. It has some grassy floral notes with a touch of hops. A little bready on the tongue, it actually reminded me of a witbier a bit. Maybe it was the slight creaminess. I enjoyed this beer."

"Second bottle drunk the next day with all the yeast swirled in. Naturally, a much fuller body and richer mouthfeel with a some lemon zest both in aroma and taste that I find commonly in these kellerbiers. I prefer it this way, and have boosted the score accordingly."

"Overall a very good, very drinkable beer."
"O: A really nice, easy-drinking brew."
"Pretty decent beer. First time I've ever tried a Kellerbier. Not something I would purchase frequently but it definitely has its place in the yearly rotation. ie) German World Cup party. Breweries website looks pretty cool and the hotel on site is something I would be interested in experiencing."
"This is Beer 1 from the Rieder Advent Calendar. Pours a hazy pale yellow colour, thin white head with no lacing. The smell is all lager yeast, totally one-dimensional. The sweetness is mild with a little lemon, quite enjoyable, but that is about all I enjoyed. The flavour is thin, and the finish has way too much funk for me. There is a hint of honey, and some grassy notes, but I just found this beer sorely lacked flavour. I will say that this is only the second Kellerbier I've ever had, so I'm not exactly familiar with the style, but this wasn't for me."
"A decently malty lager, with that default Bavarian bready character - nothing complicated, but very easy to drink - which puts it right in the middle of its sibling's metrics. A reserved, but relatively stellar start to this whole revisitation to our more (or less?) impressionable youth. Good on ya, Christian!"

"From a classic German brewery I was expecting something special and this one’s just decent. I’ve had a few beers from this Beer Advent Calendar that leaves me wondering about age and transport of the bottles. The BB dates a few months away but that could still have this one well past its prime"
"D- Refreshing amount of hops in the finish. A nice balance between malt and hop, with the bitterness in the semi dry finish being very refreshing. Easy on the tongue and stomach. An excellent example of the style."
"500ml bottle. Weizen glass. Enjoyed on may´12. (thanks – one more time- to Manolo from “Cerveceria Freiburg” ´cause it´s not too easy to find nice spots of Kellerbier style) Pale golden in color, chill haze. Mildy malty & floral hop aromas. Maltiness all around overwhelms low bitterness –shown by a subtle citric touch- . Some ripe apples too. Gentle mouthfeel & well balanced finish. Pleasant drinkability."
"Drinkability : a good beer in the German style Keller bier."
"O= I'd session on this (he and his friends did on-tap over in Germany) easily. Great with anything that would go with something akin to a Witte but with more malt-flavor."
"Served vom fass in a tall 0.5 liter with 1.5 inch head. Opaque pale straw color. Fresh hay and mild hops aroma. Crisp cold slightly bitter slightly citrus bite. Bright and pallate cleansing, ok with a thick complicated pork and gravy dish. Modest carbonation very comforting mouthfeel. Enjoyed fresh at Liebhard's Braustuberl in Aying."
"The beer pours a light yellow color with a white head. The aroma is wheat, grass and earthy hops. The flavor has a lot of strong grain notes to it with some wheat and earthy hops mixed in. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"The flavor is a bit spicier now than what I originally wrote in my on-tap review. the sweetness is still a bit too dominant, but the finish has a definitive spicy peppery character in the throat.. This is a solid Kellerbier, not the best, but good and a pleasant surprise to find in the bottle."
"Very very drinkable"
"A very unique example of a pretty rare style. Another winner from Ayinger that's worth the trip from Munich by itself...although there are many of beers like that there!"
"Still a very sound representation of the style."
"Zum Wohl!!!"
"This beer has a very bright light golden color. It has a wispy little head that quickly fads away, it has lots of carbonation. Smells clean and clear. I prefer the look of the unfiltered version of this beer, but the taste is pretty much the same. Starts out with a slightly malty flavor but finishes clean and crisp. Mouth feel is pretty week, but I think it would be a good palate cleanser if you were eating a meal with it. Usually I'm not a lager fan, but my exceptions are ones like this."
"Drinkable."
"Drank this one in Lucerne. Evidently available only in a limited market, yet brewed regularly. Beautifully cloudy, straw-golden brew unfortunately forms a thin head with poor retention and lacing. Carbonation is mild. Aroma is clean with husky, sweet pale malts, some slightly skunked fruity hops and that's about it. Mouthfeel is soft with a wet finish and medium body. Taste begins with bright acidity and distant, yet distinct, German noble flavor hops, giving way to a bready maltiness with moderate husken character and wet grain sack. The finish is soft and wet with more of the lingering sweet huskiness, but towards the middle of the bottle, it becomes irritating. Bittering hops are delicate. A decent beer, but tends to become bothersome over time."
