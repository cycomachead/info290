I find it to be medium, heading towards full bodied and with pleasant fine carbonation that lasts throughout the taste, helping to burst the overall flavors onto the palate.  It certainly has a nice freshness to it that, as the definition of this style suggests, should be there.  If this was available to me at the stores, I'd most certainly buy this on a regular basis.  Great job Creemore!","ChrisCage","Jan 22, 2015"

I purchased a sampler type box of three sorts of creemore, this is the only i havent tried and Iam already a big fan of the pilsner , and the pretty average lager didnt leave any lasting impressions, but i recall it being quaffable, and not at all off putting, just lacking charectar maybe.. anyway, not sure if they sell this keller seperate from the sampler, as I've never seen it. but it was the deciding factor for me, creemore is a great brewer, my only complaint is that its slightly ""simple"". the pilsner is the best of the offerings, but given a couple of others to experiment with, my thoughts may change in this. this keller is great, and though Im new to the style, I like it alot.","ghisty","Jun 25, 2014"

Popping the top it doesn't smell too hoppy. Smells a little malty, earthy. Pours to a cloudy pale orange with a foamy creamy head. On the taste this brew kicks into gear. Nice naturally fresh taste with a good bitterness throughout. This style and this beer seems similar to an IPA but with a little bit thinner backbone and a more earthy hop with a flatter bite. The taste is yeasty due to the lack of filtering and slightly fruity with hints of banana. Carbonation seems high but doesn't detract from flavor. This is a tasty brew and far from run of the mill.","mooseisloose","Dec 14, 2009"
4.25,9.5,4,4,4.5,3.5,4.5,"Final thoughts: Not as hoppy or as hazy as I remember the first batch being; however, still very enjoyable. I'm not sure if that's due to the fact that this can was drank within the first week of it being offered and the previous one was towards the tail end of the previous offering.","machinesquad","Oct 19, 2009"

3.5,-9.8,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Can: Poured a bright lightly hazy copper color lager with a large foamy head with average retention and some lacing. Aroma of dry caramel malt with floral undertones and some clean crisp hops. Taste is a well balanced mix between some floral malt with notes dry caramel and a light green hoppy finish. Body was quite full with good carbonation. Very well done though additional hops would have benefited this beer as well as slightly less filtration.","Phyl21ca","Sep 26, 2009"
4.07,4.9,3.5,4,4,4,4.5,"Canned sample via northyorksammy. Pale orange in colour with a bit of haze and medium carbonation. Aromas of mild citrus, herbal hops, pale malts, and yeast. Great herbal hop flavors dominate the palate, supported by tea buscuit like malts, sublte yeast notes, and a hint of tart orchard fruit. Fairly dry and very refreshing on the finish. Well balanced. I could drink lots of this.","fisherman34","Sep 15, 2009"
3.96,2.1,4.5,3.5,4,4.5,4,"Final Thoughts: As my first Kellerbier I was impressed, but can also see the lack of mainstream appeal this style offers. It is a bit oddball, but it's good none the less. I could see this going good with seafood or sausage but really, this beer is a treat beer for the enthusiast, simply put. Worth a shot, that's for sure.","TheHammer","Sep 13, 2009"
3.92,1,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"Overall, another great beer from Creemore. First time having the style and maybe it just takes some getting use to. I still prefer their lager, but will probably purchase another one of these down the road.","ludachris","Sep 10, 2009"
3.27,-15.7,3.5,4,3,3,3,"D - Easy to drink. First time I have even heard of this style so I don't fully know how to compare it. The style discription doen't really help prepare me for this beer. So I fell that giving it a high or low grade would be unfair.","JMBSH","Beers"
3.96,2.1,4.5,3.5,4,3.5,4.5,"Tried the bottle version on February 4th, 2014. The aroma is more timid than the canned version. Other aspects are similar. Nice session beer for the summer.","ZorPrime","0"
4.12,6.2,4,4.5,4,4,4,"A rather enjoyable old-school lager, made right in rural Ontario, if under the auspices of Big Beer, but they've apparently been set free of any purported shackles for this one - it's pleasantly crisp (oh shit, I may have said that already), fresh, and substantially heady. Too bad I only have the one, but chances are Molson's Canada-wide distribution network will soon address that minor detail.","biboergosum","Aug 20, 2009"
4.14,6.7,3,4,4,5,4.5,"Overall Creemore Springs hits a grand slam with this brew. A good example , true to the style, tasty and awesomely drinkable. The only flaw in my opinion is that it may be just a tad too sweet and pricey. Other than that its a great brew.","drinkininthewood","Aug 17, 2009"
4.35,12.1,4.5,4.5,4,5,4.5,"This is a fantastic lager. Only my second example of the style but very enjoyable. The good balance of hops, malt and yeast make it extremely quaffable. One of the best Ontario beers Ive tried.","CAMRAhardliner","Aug 10, 2009"

4,3.1,4,4,4,4,4,"Pours a very lightly hazed dark orange, some copper highlights, nice and thick white head forms, slowly settles down to a thick ring, some lace chunks stick to the glass. Smell is nice, very malty, signature Creemore breadiness, some toasty malts and caramel, earthy, some floral, nice light citrus hops, grassy, lightly solvent, but smells good. Taste is similar, dry and toasty up front, bready, caramel sweetness through the middle, very grassy hops, some citrus and floral, touch of fruit in the finish, almost a little tannic and grapey, nice dry finish, solid bitterness. Mouthfeel is light bodied with low to medium carbonation, just right. Nice lager with some great character. Looking forward to the hoppier batch 2.","Viggo","Aug 04, 2009"

3.83,-1.3,4.5,4,4,4,3,"Smell is pleasantly received, citrus nose with fruity aromas, it smells quite good. Taste of citrus peel, bitter fruit zest, and there is a dry, cleansing mouthfeel. I found the finish to be very earthy and disappointing and didn't score the drinkability very high for that reason. Hop astingency puts the finish a bit off balance, I wondered if this beer was too fresh? Overall, I quite liked this beer until the finish, I found it too dry and sour in the aftertaste. Up to that point, it's a great beer by me, but as much as I enjoyed the appearance, smell and taste of it, I'd probably not choose to have more than one in a session.","ThatWineGuy","Jul 26, 2009"
4,3.1,4,4,4,4,4,"Can- Deep hazy gold with orangey hues. A rocky and sticky cap sits atop the liquid, and leaves nice lace. Yeasty, citric nose that leads to fresh and pungent hops, bread crust, perfume. Flavours are fresh and bright. Lots of citrus, bready malts, fresh green hops, markedly spicy, with a floral/herbal quality. Medium bodied, with a subdued sweet fruity finish, and a pleasantly astringent bitterness that lingers. Complex, rewarding, and very drinkable. Excellent.","mrmanning","Jul 25, 2009"

4.45,14.7,4,4,4.5,4.5,5,"So it takes Creemore, backed by the financial might of Molson, to show Ontario craft brewers how to make a lager with flavour. Now where do their beers fall? In the past they've been able to say they were superior in quality and flavour to their macro rivals, but now they've been surpassed, and have fallen into the no-man's land between two camps, having neither a big marketing machine, nor a lager worthy of note. Sammy may be right, this could be a paradigm shifter.","bobsy","Jul 20, 2009"

4.2,8.2,4,4,4.5,4,4,"I'd still like to go to Franconia but it's nice now that I don't have to cash in any air miles to find delicious, well-made Kellerbier. By sticking to traditional guidelines, using whole leaf hops and leaving the beer unfiltered and unpasteurized, Creemore's done everything right. From delivery boy to brewmaster, this beer makes a genius out of the whole brewery.","biegaman","Beers"
3.78,-2.6,4.5,4,3.5,3.5,4,"Creemore Springs release party at Victory Cafe. Very very fresh. Had this on tap, will be released in cans...just as now-unfiltered. Peachy cloudy appearance with long lasting white generous head, leaving lace traces. Yeasty and spicey and malty aroma. Medium mouthfeel, the yeast cushions but above average carbonation offsets this and prevents a full two pints from being consumed, still very drinkable. Significant hops, including dry hopping, I like the unfiltered taste. Drying finsh. Bang on style, it hits the ontario market between the eyes, and just as Creemore brought craft back in Ontario about 20 years back, this will be a paradigm shifter.","Sammy","0"
