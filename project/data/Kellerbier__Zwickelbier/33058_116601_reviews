"This seems really lightweight at first, but it grows into an aromatic pleasant taste. From the 22 oz bottle purchased at New Seasons Market in Portland."

"Overall:  it's a little bit piquant for the style, but overall this is a very tasty and drinkable beer."

"a pilsner style beer with a complexity that takes it beyond what you'd usually experience with Pilsner type brews.  it's got a mix of hoppiness and grassy flavors that keep it interesting through a session.  kudos to Ecliptic for being willing to reach out a little from the norm."
"Not as yeasty as a German version & certainly happier. A nice beer & a great alternative to ales upon boring ales."
"Poured into a Seattle Beer Week pint glass. Pours a light golden amber with a one finger white head with good retention and light lacing. Aroma of biscuit malt, wheat, pilsner hops, hint of sulfur and toffee, unusual, but good. Flavor is biscuit malt, mild citrus, grassy, haylike hops, finishing with grassy hops bitterness and biscuit. Medium bodied with good carbonation. A nice little hybrid between wheat and pilsner beers, and not a bad representative of a kellerbier, which is not a common style. The flavor seems a bit understated at first, but the long lingering finish is a nice balance of dry haylike and biscuit flavors with just the right amount of bitterness. Nicely balanced. I like this quite a bit more than I expected to. I would consider this for a hot summer day session ale with good, offbeat flavors."
