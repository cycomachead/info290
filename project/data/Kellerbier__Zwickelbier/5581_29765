Bready malt, caramel, herbal, grassy hops and hints of honey fill the mouth. Finish is long and slightly sweet. Delicious session beer.","mikeg67","Aug 25, 2012"

Just arrived in the store today, pours with a gorgeous tight just shy of white head settling into a nice finger-high collar that rests atop hazy deep gold liquid. Sweet malty/grassy nose. Malty and honeyish flavors. Thinnish mouthfeel...sweet finish. Nothing to write home about here...I'm just a sucker for those swing top bottles with the German language labels I suppose.","beerluvr","May 17, 2012"

3.53,-2.8,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Slightly musty aroma of minerals and apple. Later it's all shortbread and sweet sticky malt. Flavors are similar, it has a fairly smooth and hefty feel to it once the yeast was poured. Lingering bready aftertaste, primary flavors of apple, fresh yeasty bread, and dry hay. It has a bit more character than your average German lager, but it's pretty sweet and slick feeling over time. Ok to try and compare to others of the style, likely not a repeat buy for me personally.","emerge077","Beers"
3.58,-1.4,4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"5l minikeg. It is a hazy orangeish gold with a large, foamy white head. The smell is light and grainy. The flavor is sweet and bready but with a nice touch of noble hops in the back. Not bitter but the hops are noticeable. I was surprised by this particular one.","crossovert","0"
3.7,1.9,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"Tastes like it smells, only with a really nice, smooth, surprisingly hoppy back end that brings everything together like vanilla ice cream.

4.17,14.9,3.5,4,4.5,4,4,"A fairly nice beer. Based on some of the other reviews, I think most are not reviewed to style, or the reviewer got an old beer. Mine is nice and fresh and a fairly decent representation of the style- if not world class. Pours a slightly cloudy dark straw color with a fairly thin white head that leaves somne sloppy lacing. Clean aromas of fresh hay and soft yeasty notes with just a touch of fresh baked honeyed bread. The taste is pretty similar with a rounded fresh bread flavor lightly pierced through with some subtle noble hops. Fresh like this it is quite addictive! Very easy to approach, but with that extra something that keeps drawing you back. Very pleasant and a pleasure to find this at my local bottle shop.","Georgiabeer","Mar 27, 2011"
3.46,-4.7,4,3,3.5,4,3.5,"This swing top bottle pours a pretty clear, pale golden yellow with a one finger soft soapy white head. The aromas are solely of sweet pale malts and light honey. It definitely smells like a light lager. The flavors are of sweet pale malts and light honey. It's pretty heavy grains. It also has an ever so light bitterness. It's very light and doesn't offer any complexity whatsoever, but it's not bad and decently drinkable. It drinks fine and smooth. I can see this style being popular in the summer but I wouldn't want to drink it all the time. It's just ok.","aasher","Feb 12, 2011"
2.39,-34.2,2,3,2,2.5,2.5,"Tried this at the Split Rock Beer Fest on 11-21-10. They had a bunch of the Veldensteiner bottles there and I knew that I'd never tried any of them so I made sure to get them all under my belt. This beer turned out to have some really pleasent aromas on the nose. The flavors were on the weaker side, due to the style of course. I wouldn't seek this beer out just for the hell of it. It was a good sample but thats about all for me.","Knapp85","Jan 06, 2011"
3.61,-0.6,4,3,4,3.5,3.5,"This was a new addition at my local beer store, figured I'd try it for $3.49 a bottle. 500 ml swing top bottle. Served in a mug, the beer pours a hazy dark gold color with about an inch frothy off-white head. The head retention is good, and there's a lot of lacing left on the glass. Aroma is a bit weak but mostly sweet, it smells like grain, some honey and a bit of grassy hops. Luckily, the taste is stronger than the aroma. The brew tastes like sweet malt, grassy and herbal hops, caramel malt and some bread/grain. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, it's a bit slick and is well carbonated. Drinkability is decent, it's not hard to drink this brew at all. Not a bad beer, I think it's worth a try.","bluejacket74","Mar 03, 2008"
