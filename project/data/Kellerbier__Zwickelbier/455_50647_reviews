"M/O-  This is a highly enjoyable beer that I have no problems with as a session brew, and/or this would make a very well rounded mealtime beverage.  I find it to be medium, heading towards full bodied and with pleasant fine carbonation that lasts throughout the taste, helping to burst the overall flavors onto the palate.  It certainly has a nice freshness to it that, as the definition of this style suggests, should be there.  If this was available to me at the stores, I'd most certainly buy this on a regular basis.  Great job Creemore!"
"a top shelf Canadian beer. I love it"

"me and the unfiltered beer have a mixed history, i dislike alot of beers in this style , but i respect creemore, and have greatly enjoyed their other offerings. I purchased a sampler type box of three sorts of creemore, this is the only i havent tried and Iam already a big fan of the pilsner , and the pretty average lager didnt leave any lasting impressions, but i recall it being quaffable, and not at all off putting, just lacking charectar maybe.. anyway, not sure if they sell this keller seperate from the sampler, as I've never seen it. but it was the deciding factor for me, creemore is a great brewer, my only complaint is that its slightly ""simple"". the pilsner is the best of the offerings, but given a couple of others to experiment with, my thoughts may change in this. this keller is great, and though Im new to the style, I like it alot."

"Overall - a really nice beer in the style that is bright and lively. Good full flavour and well rounded. A repeat purchase."

"o: a clean-drinking, easy-going beer. extremely lacking in the aroma department but it tastes great"
""
""
" As a quick aside I love the brewery's motto: ""Proudly 100 years behind the times"". If only we could buy its Kellerbier at 100 year old prices!"
""
"This nice little beer paired well with... cured meat and cheese."

"This beer has some sweetness to it but not enough to be overbearing or unpleasant and even though this isn't my favorite style of beer this was quite drinkable."
""

"Sweet berry-like malt up front. Good white pepper hop in the swallow. Complex full body with a low carbonation."
"Overall - 3.25/5 Sidenote: This was difficult to review as I've never encountered this style of beer. Would love to find more of the same though."
""

"The beer pours cloudy copper with a huge white head that sticks lacing to the glass. Scent is minimal. Primarily dominated by yeast, with a faint hint of malt. Tastes much better than it smells. Lemons, caramel, grassy hops, bready malts. Very sweet, spicy and sour. Mouthfeel is a bit above medium body. It has the smoothness of an ale with the crispness of a lager. Overall, a good session beer."

"Final Thoughts: Pleasantly surprised by this beer. Creemore Springs catchphrase on the can is ""A hundred years behind the times"" which suits this style perfectly. You can feel the history of the style and why it was saved for the elite. Would I drink it again? Yes, and would like to try more from this brewery."
"Overall, better than I expected! Very refreshing."
""
"Overall - Nice to see Creemore Springs expand to a different style. I found the smell to be quite offputting, which made me nervous for the taste. Nice spice, yeast and hop flavours. Would like to see other Canadian brewers take a turn on this style."
""
"Get this into BC in either cans of in six packs as I loved the slightly brewery funk that came from the nose and the way the beer seemed to open up with warmth ( not usual for most lagers). I found grassy notes and citrus notes depending on what sip I was taking. A very inventive beer from Creemore."
""
"M- Light body, great carbonation."
""
""
""
"Pretty good beer here, an interesting style and quite refreshing. Nice sweetness that doesn't get too cloying. Worth trying, different and interesting."
""
"Overall, medium/light body, but full of flavour, a very good, drinkable beer for the summer."
"Creemore Springs Kellerbier pours a fairly bright gold with a slight haze. The aroma is mostly light malt with a bit of sulfur, I would guess it was slightly lightstruck if it wasn't from a can. There are some nice light herbal hops in the aroma as well. The flavor is moderately sweet with a nice mild herbal hoppiness, and a bit of powdery yeast. A little more sulfar pops up, but it isn't strong enough to be unpleasant."
"O: Not a memorable brew, but still well made and refreshing. A great summertime cold one for lawnmower..."
""
""
""
""
"Fairly light body and carbonation. A refreshing balance. Smooth texture. Very fresh and fruity tasting for a fairly dry beer. A bit simple but very nice. One of my favourite finds of 2011. I hope to see it again but it is sadly becoming harder to find."
""

"O - Solid, like all the beers I've had from Creemore. Worthy to be considered a good example of its style."

"Taste - Light fruity hops flavours and a clean amlt profile. Nothing that really stands out, but not bad."
"not a big fan of this stuff."
"Drinkability - easy to go to town on these however the price is quite steep. The quality is very good though which has caused this to prominently occupy a space in my fridge."
"Drinkability: It's a very smooth drinkable beer accompanied with good flavours and aromas."
"D: I don't have any other Kellerbiers to refer to, but this seems to be a good example of an exceptionally interesting and rare style of lager. It's easily drinkable but has a full, complex flavour profile; an oddity in the best possible way."
"O - generally impressed with this offering, it is extremely easy drinking and well balanced, very enjoyable on this hot summer day"
"O - Certainly a refreshing ale, and fitting of the style. The flavours are bold enough to be memorable, but mild enough to keep you coming back for more."
"DRINK (4.5/5) I really quite enjoyed this one. At the first sip, I immediately regretted picking up only one immediately before the liquor store closed! Although it has a full body, I think the light flavors would also make this an ideal session beer."
"Final Grade: 4.23, a solid A-."
"On the lighter, cleaner side for a Kellerbier, Creemore does it some justice."
"O - my favorite from Creemore - very tasty for my only stab at this style - reminds me a little bit of a full flavored IPA"
"First time trying this style. No idea if it is stylistically correct, but I definitely will have to check out more in this vein. Cloudy amber/orange with a nice head with good retention. Smell is a little subdued. Beautifully refreshing smooth mouthfeel. I often have a problem with hoppy lagers in that they come across a bit heavy, more ale like, but this is refreshing, just what I look for in lagers. Delicious biscuity walnut malt flavour mixed with a delicate but obvious hop character, dry but not very bitter. Quite enjoyed this, and if it was a bit cheaper, would be my go to everyday drinker."
"Hazy deep copper colour, 1.5 fingers of white head, lace around the top edges of the glass. Smell is of bitter hop, a certain dry presence is there, nice malt backbone, floral, zesty citrus. Taste is of caramel, hops, citrus, grapefruit, peach, good bitterness nice malty finish. Light to medium weight, medium carbonation, full body. Enjoyable and refreshing, very drinkable, always enjoy seeing this come around."
"Definitely something I'll pick up again when I'm in Toronto."
"D: A great summer beer that has held up well but is now a little out of season."
"A very refreshing ad flavourful beer though."
"I was terrified that Molson-Coors would destroy Creemore, but so far they have resisted any obvious drastic changes. Long may they remain as they currently brew!"
"D - Really high. Enough flavour to keep a night interesting and a low enough ABV to session it. Carbonation might get to ya."
"D - easy and smooth going down, nice and refreshing. I would have quite enjoyed a bigger glass of this! Definitely one to stay on my list of wants!"
"Overall: Recommended and my only regret is that it waited so long in my fridge before i grabbed it."
"Price = Gratis at the brewery."
"I would buy this beer again."
"Another good beer from Creemore springs."
"Drink - A decent effort from Creemore Springs. Not the best beer I've ever had, but one that I would probably buy again."
"Hazy orange with a soapy cap of white foam. Head retention was average, but it left a lot of clumpy lace on the glass. Malty aroma, bready with some caramel, lemon citrus hops, a bit floral and toasty, slightly spicy. Dry, biscuity malt up front with solid but balanced bitterness. Nice malt flavours, bready and toasty, some caramel sweetness follows. Hop flavours were earthy, lemony and floral with lingering peppery spice. Medium bodied with medium to low carbonation, quite smooth. I was quite impressed with the amount of flavour and character jammed into this beer. Very tasty."
"D - I can't get enough of this one. This is one good beer. This has become my favourite from Creemore."
"It makes me sad this isn't a year-round beer, but it is indeed great for summer. Extremely drinkable and definitely my favourite Creemore beer. Hoping Molson lets them make more, full-flavoured beers like this one."
"D - Pretty good. Nothing outstanding."
"Definitely worth keeping in my fridge. A good find."
"Hazy copper with a rocky, coarse head. Nose is caramel, herbal hops and rough graininess. Dry and fairly bitter with lots of nuttiness and hint of anise. Raw toasted graininess and the bare hint of citrus round out the flavours. A bit of a slick body with a sharp carbonation. Fairly drinkable."
"D - A nice beer. One that I will definitely buy again."
"D - Gimme, gimme, gimme :)"
"I thoroughly enjoyed this beer, and I hope it remains easy to find, as I could see getting it quite a bit given the selection in these parts."
"Very fresh, flavorful, satisfying and clean. The kegged version is more like a keller with less carbonation than the canned version."
"Hopefully other Ontario brewers will take notice of this beer and realize that lagers don't have to be apple juice-like in colour and water-like in flavour. This was a pleasant surprise that I have been enjoying immensely. Cheers!"
"D: goes down like water. Sessionable, citrusy, aromatic, inviting. Newbies expecting an IPA should not drink or rate this beer. It is exceptional FOR THE STYLE, not if you compare it to Surly Furious. A superb and quaffable keller bier, I'm glad I got my hands on a half case before it disappeared."
"d-Very drinkable. I found them best when they were chilled but allowed to sit for about 10 min out of the fridge."
"I'm a big fan of the Creemore premium lager, and based on other reviews here, I'm tempted to try this again at a later date."
"A distinctive beer with a lot of things happening. Grassy hops, minerals, fruitiness, earthy malt. Very solid, quite interesting. If you like hops, you'll enjoy this. Not an extreme hop style, just straight up enjoyable."
"Poured a deep cloudy orange colour with a thick white head. The head dissipated quickly without too much lacing. Smell is of grassy hops. As soon as it was poured I think I was getting a bit of sulfur, but this was much more muted after 30 seconds. Taste has a light bitterness of the hops, with some sweet bready malts. Quite smooth carbonation level. I could easily drink several of these in a row. I think I enjoyed last year's batch more, but maybe I'm remembering wrong. I still enjoy it and will buy it through the summer."
"Smooth drinking, clean, not too carbonated but still sparkles a little. Could easily sit down and drink the 8pack, this is what summer needs. Never rated a non-bock lager this high.... Just do damn drinkable."
"Edit: I had to up the drinkability here, since it seems I've been drinking more of this than probably any other beer this summer and it definitely sessions well. Not too bitter; this stuff is damn tasty. One of the few beers Ontario can boast of."
"Poured from a 473ml can into a pint glass, can dated April 22. Smell is hoppy when I popped the tab, and pours a dark orange/golden red with a few fingers of head, dwindling to a thin layer with minimal, but chunky lacing. Again, smell is hoppy and slightly spicy. Taste is quite good too, not too bitter (although it finishes pretty bitter), floral hops, earthy malts and some spice again. Pretty organic feeling on the whole. Carbonation is a bit high, and has quite a dry aftertaste. Drinkability is great, glad I've stocked up on these cans!"
"Picked up this year's new batch from LCBO on May 8, 2010. I was excited to say the least. For some reason, last year's peach/apricot bouquet is gone, as well as the bready undertone. Carbonation is markedly increased as well. Now it just tastes a lot like Creemore Lager now except at a higher price. Disappointed."
"Another fine brew from Creemore; quite enjoyable this time of year. Not really a session brew - defionitely one to take some time with and enjoy."
"Back in the GWN, picked this up citing the ""Generously Hopped"" proclamation, well I'll be the judge of that, lets give it a whirl. Popping the top it doesn't smell too hoppy. Smells a little malty, earthy. Pours to a cloudy pale orange with a foamy creamy head. On the taste this brew kicks into gear. Nice naturally fresh taste with a good bitterness throughout. This style and this beer seems similar to an IPA but with a little bit thinner backbone and a more earthy hop with a flatter bite. The taste is yeasty due to the lack of filtering and slightly fruity with hints of banana. Carbonation seems high but doesn't detract from flavor. This is a tasty brew and far from run of the mill."
"Final thoughts: Not as hoppy or as hazy as I remember the first batch being; however, still very enjoyable. I'm not sure if that's due to the fact that this can was drank within the first week of it being offered and the previous one was towards the tail end of the previous offering."
"As my first Kellerbier I am pretty happy with how this went. Certainly one of Creemore Spring's better lagers."
"Can: Poured a bright lightly hazy copper color lager with a large foamy head with average retention and some lacing. Aroma of dry caramel malt with floral undertones and some clean crisp hops. Taste is a well balanced mix between some floral malt with notes dry caramel and a light green hoppy finish. Body was quite full with good carbonation. Very well done though additional hops would have benefited this beer as well as slightly less filtration."
"Canned sample via northyorksammy. Pale orange in colour with a bit of haze and medium carbonation. Aromas of mild citrus, herbal hops, pale malts, and yeast. Great herbal hop flavors dominate the palate, supported by tea buscuit like malts, sublte yeast notes, and a hint of tart orchard fruit. Fairly dry and very refreshing on the finish. Well balanced. I could drink lots of this."
"Final Thoughts: As my first Kellerbier I was impressed, but can also see the lack of mainstream appeal this style offers. It is a bit oddball, but it's good none the less. I could see this going good with seafood or sausage but really, this beer is a treat beer for the enthusiast, simply put. Worth a shot, that's for sure."
"Overall, another great beer from Creemore. First time having the style and maybe it just takes some getting use to. I still prefer their lager, but will probably purchase another one of these down the road."
"D - Easy to drink. First time I have even heard of this style so I don't fully know how to compare it. The style discription doen't really help prepare me for this beer. So I fell that giving it a high or low grade would be unfair."
"Tried the bottle version on February 4th, 2014. The aroma is more timid than the canned version. Other aspects are similar. Nice session beer for the summer."
"A rather enjoyable old-school lager, made right in rural Ontario, if under the auspices of Big Beer, but they've apparently been set free of any purported shackles for this one - it's pleasantly crisp (oh shit, I may have said that already), fresh, and substantially heady. Too bad I only have the one, but chances are Molson's Canada-wide distribution network will soon address that minor detail."
"Overall Creemore Springs hits a grand slam with this brew. A good example , true to the style, tasty and awesomely drinkable. The only flaw in my opinion is that it may be just a tad too sweet and pricey. Other than that its a great brew."
"This is a fantastic lager. Only my second example of the style but very enjoyable. The good balance of hops, malt and yeast make it extremely quaffable. One of the best Ontario beers Ive tried."
"Medium bodied with low carbonation. Feels smooth and goes down very easy. This a tasty and refreshing summer release, and I'll be picking up more before it's gone."
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied, with a pretty crisp, hard carbonation"
"Superb creamy mouthfeel, possiby from being unfiltered, and a highly drinkable beer. This is quite possibly one of the best lagers I've had, this is one of my new favourite styles."
"Pours a very lightly hazed dark orange, some copper highlights, nice and thick white head forms, slowly settles down to a thick ring, some lace chunks stick to the glass. Smell is nice, very malty, signature Creemore breadiness, some toasty malts and caramel, earthy, some floral, nice light citrus hops, grassy, lightly solvent, but smells good. Taste is similar, dry and toasty up front, bready, caramel sweetness through the middle, very grassy hops, some citrus and floral, touch of fruit in the finish, almost a little tannic and grapey, nice dry finish, solid bitterness. Mouthfeel is light bodied with low to medium carbonation, just right. Nice lager with some great character. Looking forward to the hoppier batch 2."
"Overall, very happy to try some Canadian locals and my first kellerbier...thanks again Eric. This is definitely a great alternative for a session brew."
"D: A very good drinker."
"Mouthfeel is a tiny bit overcarbonated for my tastes but not bad overall. I find the beer refreshing and it goes down quickly."
"Smell is pleasantly received, citrus nose with fruity aromas, it smells quite good. Taste of citrus peel, bitter fruit zest, and there is a dry, cleansing mouthfeel. I found the finish to be very earthy and disappointing and didn't score the drinkability very high for that reason. Hop astingency puts the finish a bit off balance, I wondered if this beer was too fresh? Overall, I quite liked this beer until the finish, I found it too dry and sour in the aftertaste. Up to that point, it's a great beer by me, but as much as I enjoyed the appearance, smell and taste of it, I'd probably not choose to have more than one in a session."
"Can- Deep hazy gold with orangey hues. A rocky and sticky cap sits atop the liquid, and leaves nice lace. Yeasty, citric nose that leads to fresh and pungent hops, bread crust, perfume. Flavours are fresh and bright. Lots of citrus, bready malts, fresh green hops, markedly spicy, with a floral/herbal quality. Medium bodied, with a subdued sweet fruity finish, and a pleasantly astringent bitterness that lingers. Complex, rewarding, and very drinkable. Excellent."
"Cheers."
"I like this a lot better than their pilsner, and it's a bit more flavorful than their lager - I hope this one becomes a regular!"
"A winner from Creemore. These people clearly love beer, despite their infamous owners."
"M/D mellow, little carbonation went well with the sun finished it before i finished typing these few words. what dose that tell you"
"So it takes Creemore, backed by the financial might of Molson, to show Ontario craft brewers how to make a lager with flavour. Now where do their beers fall? In the past they've been able to say they were superior in quality and flavour to their macro rivals, but now they've been surpassed, and have fallen into the no-man's land between two camps, having neither a big marketing machine, nor a lager worthy of note. Sammy may be right, this could be a paradigm shifter."
"The drinkability is off the charts on this one."
"I'd still like to go to Franconia but it's nice now that I don't have to cash in any air miles to find delicious, well-made Kellerbier. By sticking to traditional guidelines, using whole leaf hops and leaving the beer unfiltered and unpasteurized, Creemore's done everything right. From delivery boy to brewmaster, this beer makes a genius out of the whole brewery."
"Creemore Springs release party at Victory Cafe. Very very fresh. Had this on tap, will be released in cans...just as now-unfiltered. Peachy cloudy appearance with long lasting white generous head, leaving lace traces. Yeasty and spicey and malty aroma. Medium mouthfeel, the yeast cushions but above average carbonation offsets this and prevents a full two pints from being consumed, still very drinkable. Significant hops, including dry hopping, I like the unfiltered taste. Drying finsh. Bang on style, it hits the ontario market between the eyes, and just as Creemore brought craft back in Ontario about 20 years back, this will be a paradigm shifter."
