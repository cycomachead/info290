3.88,-9.8,4.5,4,4,3.5,3.5,"My first keller and I have to say that I'm not fond of the style. Maybe it grows on you, so I will try it again, given the opportunity as it is hard to find these.","Naugros","Oct 12, 2010"
4.89,13.7,4,5,5,4.5,5,"The beer is clear, maybe a little haze, a pale gold color, with a few fingers of foam. The aroma is just dead on, bready and grainy, rich and malty, perfect. I've had only a handful of lagers that smell quite this appealing. The flavor was the same, just like liquid bread, delicious. A little sweet upfront and only a little bitter in back, very balanced but malty, the grains come through in a great way. Heavy body for a lager but still easily chugable. Any lover of German lagers should be happy with this one.","TurdFurgison","Oct 11, 2010"
4.48,4.2,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,5,"Drinkability was incredible. Prior to this, I hadn't had much experience with the style, so I thought I might have been overrating this at first. However, after quite a few other pours from different casks, it became clear that this was the best of the bunch and a great, great beer in its own right.","Thorpe429","Jan 15, 2010"
4.48,4.2,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,5,"I imagine that this is the way that beers used to be, hundreds of years ago. Its light in body, creamy in the mouth, has a slight bitter edge at the back but no aftertaste. Finishes wet, some mild yeastiness and some mild graininess, its super drinkable, its "crisp", which is an adjective I usually feel people use when they don't know what to say, and that's me now. I could drink gallons of this beer, as if it were water, nonstop. It is ineffable.","drabmuh","Mar 27, 2009"
4.33,0.7,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"It's a perfectly balanced lager/pilsner. Though it's listed as a lager, it taste like a pilsner, to me anyway. Has a slight fruitiness that's dominated by hops.","Amalak","Sep 27, 2007"

4.8,11.6,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,5,"I have had this beer from the barrel in Bamberg several times, but on this occasion I stopped at the brewery in Mönchsambach. The beer was so fresh and the lady of the house friendly. It was a great beer all around. The beer was amber in color and nearly clear, no sediment noticeable. This was a classic example of a German keller beer.","cichief","Dec 08, 2006"
4.05,-5.8,4,4,4,3.5,4.5,"Very foamy bottle -- I had to pour it in my glass quickly before it foamed over the top of the bottle. Once in the glass, it was a very pretty beaten gold color, cloudy, with a collar of head and sticky lacing on the glass. Sharp, earthy hop aromas and a touch of citrus (lemon) comprise the aroma, along with a graininess that reminds me of zweiback crackers. On the palate, immensely smooth and a touch sweet at first, with some funky/musty hop bitterness providing definition. The finish is full of banana flavors, and then dries out in a flash. All of these elements play well together. This is quite a nice keller bier, although not my favorite. Hard to find, but worth seeking out.","geexploitation","Sep 26, 2006"
3.65,-15.1,4.5,4.5,3,4,3.5,"I don't know why, but the combination of the flavors did not mesh for me. I thought the beer was complex, unique, interesting, and a great experience, i just didn't like the taste!","Lnedrive14","Jun 16, 2006"
4.42,2.8,3.5,4,4.5,4.5,5,"Aside: I raise my glass in a toast to my mom's sister, Tante Hanni, who was one of our hosts in Germany and who passed away this morning at 87. Prost!","sponberg","May 04, 2006"
4.22,-1.9,3.5,4,4,4.5,5,"Drinkability & Notes  This is where this beer really shines, I just drank the whole half liter without realizing even it. This is what a pale lager should be, perfect for coming in from mowing the lawn (which I just did). Certainly the best Keller Bier out there, and one of the best pale lagers period. Surprised to see Hopfenextrakt (hop extract I can only assume) on the ingredient list, and the contradictory (in my mind) Farmhouse-brewed on the back. Damn, with summer coming its time to find more of this.","OldSock","Apr 10, 2006"
4.38,1.9,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1/2" bright white head over the almost clear yellow gold brew. Head holds steady, with plentiful bubbly white lacing. Aroma is pale malts and crisp hops. Taste is sweet pale malt with a crisp, lightly spicy hoppiness. Mouthfeel is soft throughout the mouth, and drinkability is excellent. Could see this one in a big old stein, for sure.","ppoitras","Apr 06, 2006"
4.57,6.3,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,"Palate- Smooth, with a lively but not overdone effervescence. Notes of citrus, apple, grass and hops are nicely woven together. The mouthfeel and balance are the great attributes of this beer, showing Old World skill with tasty beverages (French wines can show this great integration also). The carbonation, maltiness, hops and mineral are all in balance. Easy to drink, but not forgettable.","fingolfin72","Mar 03, 2006"
4.57,6.3,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,"Drinkability was absolutely world class and top notch. Amazingly thirst quenching and left me wanting many, many more. I can think of no flaws from a balance standpoint and the flavor really rounds out well as you work through the bottle. If you love lager, find this beer.","CRJMellor","Mar 02, 2006"
4.08,-5.1,4.5,4,4,4.5,4,"Solid all round. Pours out to a neon like yellow color with a sea-foam like head. Some notes of lacing, medium to medium high level of carbonation. Lotsa sediment in the bottom. Aromas of fresh hay and malts, with some sweet corn nuances and light fruits. Taste is fresh and crisp, very refreshing; flavors of malts and minor bitter hops in the forefront, with elements of grain, sweet herbs and grass intermixed in the background. Nice. Mouthfeel was bubbly and had a thicker than expected consistancy. Nice. Good drinkability. I hope that I can find this in the summertime, as this is what I have in mind after mowing the lawn. When reminded that this is a "Lager", it exemplifies what should be the standard when discussing lager beers. Recommended drinking.","Frozensoul327","Feb 28, 2006"
4.18,-2.8,4.5,4,4,4.5,4.5,"real nice drinkability in this beer. nothing harsh or off about it, just a well crafted beer with some nice complexities. probably one of the most impressive lagers i've had (no that thats been many).","kmo1030","Feb 18, 2006"
4.26,-0.9,5,4,4,5,4.5,"Props to BeerPanther for bringing this into the store. Appearance is light cloudy yellow at the bottom of the wizen glass and turns a couple shades more orange as the glass widens at the top. And when the label says natural beer thats exactly what you see in the body. Lots of particles swirling and swimming around. Respectable head too. For smell I get a good fresh hefe smell. Hints of orange, maybe even a little lemon, but no banana like some hefe's (yeah I know this is not a hefe). But the smell is not distinctly pilsner either. Tasted is nutty, a bit of almond, classic citrus tang on the front of the tongue, mild hops, and great balance. Mouthfeel has got to be one of the best I have ever felt. Like a lot of German fresh beers sometimes I find them over carbonated and burp after every sip. Sure the carbonation adds to the refreshing sensation but this beer does it without the excess foam on the way down. Great balance, great mouthfeel, and a refreshing flavor equals a high drinkability in my book. The one think keeping this beer from a better score is that nothing stands out to grab my attention. Almost as if this beer is lacking a distinction, lacking a character. In the car world this beer would be a Toyota Camery. Solid, reliable, hard to hate, does every technical attribute perfectly, a perfect transportation module. But where is the passion and soul?","danadeny","Feb 16, 2006"
4.65,8.1,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,5,"This is a lager, correct? This is absurd amounts of depth and breadth in a non-ale. If you can't vouchsafe for freshness I'd be wary of buying this, especially if not refrigerated. I dream of drinking this even fresher on draught in Franconia.","nomad","Jan 03, 2006"
4.97,15.6,4.5,5,5,5,5,"I will continue to enjoy this beer again and again as I've secured an option for 50 bottles. I hope no one else latches on to it.","putnam","Jan 17, 2005"
4.57,6.3,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,"I've really been digging the German biers recently. I got a hold of this one from a friend who raved about it, and I must agree that it is in fact raveworthy. Pours a bright gold color, though it doesn't have the usual clearness of a typical German lager. There are literally bits of yeast or grain suspended in the murky straw colored beer. Some might view this as a flaw, I just think it's interesting. Didn't have a grainy mouthfeel at all by the way, it was silky smooth and light on the palate. Smell and taste have a distinct, almost mead-like honey characteristic up front. Lots of peppery spices and a bit of funkyness to this one, really bizarre. Excellent spicy hops. Hallertau? Saaz? Just a guess. All of this is backed by an awesomely light German maltyness. Almost wheaty. Like I said before this one is ultra smooth and nice and light on the palate and uber drinkable. I doubt if I'll ever come across this beer again, but I'll definately be on the lookout, and I'll be exploring this style a little more.","twelvsies","Beers"
