"On tap at Rattle n Hum, NYC. Great beer. First aroma on the nose was peach."

"Yeast esters are slightly reminiscent of a hefe, with more bitterness at the finish."

"A warm and rich mouthful with a malty sweetness. It can only be described as ""chewy wheat."" The most grainy yet elegant brew enlivened by a hoppy hint. Only faintly bitter, but somehow nicely balanced by the hoppy twang. A wonderful quaff and a very good example of the style."

"O: This is a very enjoyable beer for the summer with the light and refreshing characteristics one would want on a warm evening. Very easy to drink and I could easy put down a couple of liters in a single session."
"Pale amber colour, slightly cloudy, medium, poorly retained head. Aroma was cork with hints of straw and malt, slightly sour. Tasted bittersweet, had a hint of sourness, combined citrus with the usual HB sharpness, slightly grainy finish. Slightly coarse mouthfull, body slightly heavy, well carbonated. Overall well made if unspectacular summer beer."

"This was a great beer, I felt privileged to have it on tap at a German bar. This was a softer more flowery beer, but its doesn't let u forget that it is a beer, and a good one. Overall I really liked it and highly recommend it to anyone if they ever get the chance to try it."

"The 2011 Bachelor Party Extravaganza has moved across the street for some German goodness. This bit pours a hazy orange-amber topped by a healthy finger of cream-white foam. The nose comprises banana, clove, white bread, orange zest, light caramel, light black pepper, and a touch of minerals. The taste brings in more of the same, heavy on the breadiness. The banana and orange are also stronger, kicking the spices to the very back of the bus. The body is a rather light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and an ever-so-slightly grainy feel. Overall, a tasty little summer brew, one that provides the quench of a hefe with the slightly increased heft of a larger beer. Good times."
"Palate is similar to the aroma. Plenty of yeast character that contributes mild spiciness and fruit, bit of pineapple. Very bready malt backbone, mild herbal hoppiness. Finishes spicy and mildly bitter with an herbal kick. Feels a bit chewy and thick, surprisingly substantial. Pretty good stuff, not my favorite keller to date, but quite good."
"O: A beer that is excellent for a warm day. Very refreshing and easy to drink."
"Had a pint at Brickyard Gastropub in Manhattan. I usually love the style, but wasn't impressed by this beer. It just came off like an indistinct quasi-wheat beer. There's was nothing crisp about it, it just felt flat. The malt had a little sweet wheat bread character with mild fruit, but nothing here stood out. It's not a bad beer, but nothing to bother with."
"Good stuff. Certainly not as great as a few others I've encountered, but an absolutely solid take on a kellerbier. If anything, I'd say my impression of this beer might've been hurt slightly having come from Bamberg a day or two earlier. It's good, but not as good as the kellerbiers/ungespundetes up there."
"It is a good summer beer."
"Eine Mass bitte!"
"D/O I still think the Hefe Weisse is the best Hofbrau beer, but this is a nice alternate and my #2 Hofbrau beer. I'll probably be drinking this while its available when I visit the Hofbrau."
"Overall a very nice German treat."
"MF&D - the taste is pretty incredible, and I loved it, which raises the drinkability inevitably. the body is wholly medium, with ample carbonation. a true medium blend."
"D: Very drinkable and classically German - from malt to yeast to hops...and, of course, all in good balance."
"Mouthfeel is a bit above average."
"Gold and opaque with a limited floral scent. Very crisp and refreshing. Definitely one of the best summer brews I've had."
"Served in a dimpled mug, a slightly opaque orange gold body, with a fluffy inch of foam on top. It left quite a bit of lace, and looked the part of a quality German bier. Sort of grassy and light pilsner malt aroma. Flavor had a light hop bitterness, and fairly full body, a shade under medium. Dry finish, it kept me drinking more. Hard to pin down the flavors here, a bit of German yeast gives a light apple flavor to the cracker malt component. Well carbonated and an easy quaffer. Rare to see, this is a new seasonal around these parts..."
"This beer feels a little coarse and wet at the same time. There is a weird warming effect going on here too."
"Funny that I did not see this beer on here yet. I had this once at Zum Schneider and today bought it in a growler at Bierkraft in Brooklyn. Golden with a frothy white head. Looks like a traidtional helles, but a bit more murky. Smells of bread and malt. Very good flavor, malts and biscuit. Ultra smooth mouthfeel. Very drinkable. I could have pints and pints of this on a hot day."
