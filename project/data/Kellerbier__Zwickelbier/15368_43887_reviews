"Had this on gravity cask. This beer poured a vibrant golden color with crystal-clear clarity. Mountains of foam capped it, releasing a honeyed sweet aroma. Light flavor of sweet honey and clove flowers, but not hoppy nor bitter. Enjoyable, especially for a spring day."
"Pours golden with a very slight haze; some bubbles but no head to speak of - about right for gravity cask. The smell is faint but nice: some woody notes, a little grass and grain. The taste is more complex: lots of wood, pumpernickel bread, marigold, a rusty bitter finish. It's lightly carbonated, thin in body, but with some viscosity at the swallow. Very easy to drink, and a very fine beer indeed."
"Overall not bad, very drinkable and refreshing, nice malts and hops but just not enough of them."
"500ml bottle. Pours a slightly hazy straw yellow with a fluffy white head. Great lacing. Smells of full, grainy malt with a lot of grassiness; the hops are quite evident. Earthy. Tastes of pale malt and wet hay, with a crisp bitterness that makes it super refreshing. Great light-medium body. Incredibly easy to drink. Fantastic stuff, though it's better from a fresh cask."
"D: This is a pretty drinkable beer though I found the metallic aftertaste to be a bit much throughout"
"This is the beer I was most looking forward to, and it didn't disappoint."
"D- Surprisingly enjoyable. This beer looked a bit older and ick by the bottle, but was surprisingly enjoyable."
"This is a powerful and fresh tasting beer that is very delicious."
"The taste is similar but lightly on the bitter side with bread, hay, pine, lemon, juice, a somewhat bitter finish, and overall very tasty with good flavour."
"Quite a tasty beer and super drinkable. A bit of a raw and wild lager but one of the better ones out there."
"D: An interesting tasty beer that just showed up at BevMo one day, don't see many of this rare Franconian style so I had to pick it up. Very drinkable and refreshing, go try this beer if it shows up in your area."
