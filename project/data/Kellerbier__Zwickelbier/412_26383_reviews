"Pours a reddish-mahogany in color with a good 5-finger foamy/creamy head that finally settled down to around 5mm after a good while! I even poured it very slowly. Most I have seen I believe! A good amount of lacing was seen when sipped. Like a good German brew that was fresh on tap. The aroma is only of malts and yeast for the most part. Pretty much the same is said for the taste with just a very light finish of hops. Wasn't overdone at alll and actually just added some character to this brew. Don't think I have ever had this German style of beer either but was really good. Medium-bottled with perfect carbonation. Overall a great brew! PROST and BEST WISHES for 2015!"

"i still think the price point to quality ratio of some of these german beers is profoundly awesome. this bottle was less than five bucks. a much thicker, denser german brew than i am used to here, hazy with yeast sediment and a flat looking tan orange hue. the beer is real heady, white and bubbly and lasting. german malty flavor here, with a warm yeast character and a speck of brown sugar in the finish. its definiely grain driven, but there is a light bittering hop in the finish with the sweetness of the grain that balances well, and the beer feels quite light for how dense it looks. creamy texture and a lot of carbonation help that. its maybe not the most dynamic malt profile in german brewing, but its definitely unlike american made beers in the same style, and i quite like it, different than what i am used to."

"A beer that has a little bit of character--nice maltiness on the forefront of taste, with a little hoppy kick in the end.  While I've enjoyed other kellerbiers more than this one, this good be a good start for someone who wants this type of lager but likes a little hops to be apparent."

"overall: I like it, it was a nice surprise. Someone took some time on this recipe. Not my favorite but I would love this in the winter time."
"Price point - $4.29 / 500ML swing top bottle"

" The taste is slightly toasted with lightly spiced flavor from both the hops and yeast with a subtle sweet bready malt balance and yeast creaminess in the taste. There is a mild mineral note with an earthiness of German pilsner malt with mild creamy yeast taste in the finish. Overall I enjoyed this, it is a good lager with nice maltiness but not exceptional -just a good take on the style butt not overly complex"
"O: Very good example of a Keller, does all you expect and a bit more."

"The appropriate light body sets the foundation for this brew, malts even making for a bit of chewiness along with the crispness. Somehow, though, it does still manage to flow smoothly. It would be wrong if the feel was clean, and this beer really pulls out the light body with the texture left with maturity and lack of pasteurization or filtration."

"First one for the style for me, so I don't have anything to cmpare it with, but I think it was a good one."

"Very true to type, this medium-bodied kellerbier is a nice way to enjoy a fall or winter evening."
"-Proof that ""Bayerisches Reinheitsgebot"" allows for quite a bit of variety"

"An alright Zwickel, but not good enough for me to go seeking out again."
"Overall, an easy drinking lager that hits the spot if you are looking for something smooth with moderate flavor (i.e. not wanting a hop bomb). Recommend if you can get it especially since this is one of the rarer styles and hard to find (I know - been trying for several yrs). New to TX market. Rotation - would like to try on-tap at least once. Not sure if I'd buy again in bottle unless the mood struck me."

"O: This is not a beer that will blow you away, but a very solid choice for a lager, tasty and just interesting enough. I would recommend it."

"M: Very smooth. Carbonation is modest, allowing this beer to go down easy."
"overall; this is a nice one, would definitely buy again. Try with a bit of celery salt sprinkled Limburger and the yeast in this beer takes on a lactic, ice cream-like aftertaste."

"C+"
"Taste: again, yeast and dark malts are in large supply. Lightly fruity, just a little bit juicy. I'm immediately reminded why I like kellerbiers, that yeast really brings a lot of flavor."
""

"Notes: An interesting beer inside and out a nice lager all the way. Cheers."

"Overall, a nicely complex beer with lots of little nuances that develop as it warms."
"O: This isn't necessarily a bad beer, but is definitely a forgettable one."
"Awesome kellerbier-full of flavor and character, while retaining the refreshing smooth characteristics you'd expect from a lager. Charming and delicious."
""
"Pours a hazy brown with a mild spicy malt aroma. Rich caramel taste with a thick feel. Mild carbonation. Medium sweet dark fruit taste. Has a sweet start but finishes clean with little negative aftertaste. . This is an alright brew but not too exciting."
"T: perfect body not so light not so heavy, good taste to malt, and a little burn bread, nice bitterness for the style"
"I have very little experience with Kellerbiers and that could be why this didn't blow me away. Overall, it's well rounded, flavourful, and very, very refreshing. I have some work to do in appreciating a well made lager. And until I fully do, I'm comfortable with my review of this beer."
""
""
"Taste confirms the richness of this beer. A great Keller beer!"
""
""
"Had a glass at the Trapp Door in Emmaus, PA. The malt was smoother than other kellerbiers or pilsners, more like a Vienna lager with a light caramel, bready barley character. I don't get any of the yeasty or earthy notes of most kellerbiers, but I do like the subtle spicy floral hop character that sink in to the finish. Aside from the hops, this beer doesn't resemble the style much, but it's a fine lager worth trying."

"VERY disappointing. It tasted stale and very homebrew-gone-bad. Smelled a bit yeasty and was cloudier than should be... Poor aftertaste - again this stale, blech finish. I should've known there was an issue when it was on sale at Kaufland for 8 euro for a case of 20 X .5 liter bottles. Don't waste your time as there are SOOO many other more interesting ales/keller biers."
"O: Another classic keller. I don't know why more breweries don't do this style, their sure fun to drink."
"O: For a beginners Kellerbier, this could be a nice introduction to the style, but it really doesn't stand out in any way."
"Poured into a pint glass a murky amber with a small white head that receded to almost nothing, leaving little to no lace. Bready aroma, with caramel malts, yeast, and some honey sweetness. Smooth malt taste, grassy, with flavors of toasted bread, caramel, honey-roasted peanuts, and a nice floral quality coming through midway, and maybe a touch of orange. Nice and smooth, medium body, and very drinkable."
"O/D - I could definately session this. Nice and drinkable and very soft, subtle, and tasty."
"I liked this alot. Nice and different complexities. You can taste the minerals in the water in this one. Just a great change in style and great balance in flavors. Go for it."
"O - Very nice beer and would make a great session beer on a hot day"
"The mouthfeel is smooth and light. I like this beer very much. It has a little more flavor than a pure quencher like stoudts Gold."
"Not the best Keller I've had, but as far as bottled versions go it's okay."
"Notes: Overall this is a very enjoyable beer."
"D: High. Moderate alcohol, great flavor, excellent nose, all delivered without any irritating carbonation. I could drink this all day, an excellent example of kellerbier."
"D- The drinkability is pretty good. Despite the slightly unbalanced character of the hops, I can imagine enjoying this with a spicy meal, using the hops bitterness to my advantage to cut through a stronger flavor."
"D -This is a very nice Keller Bier. Glad this one showed up in town this week."
"It's not bad, would have liked a little more flavor, very malty beer."
"Well-made brew. I don't have a ton of experience with Kellerbier, but I enjoyed this."
"Drinkability: This is a beer I've enjoyed sipping and I'd be quite happy to have this one again. While I'd not give it top marks overall it has a nice drinkability and I'd not hesitate to have another."
"Rather elegant and intriguing but easy to drink, sampled at beer tasting at De Klomp, Linköping, Sweden."
"a solid keller without much of a broadness in flavor. or i would say just lean. qualities are there... mild funk of something tight on the palate... apple nose, pilsner brisk and floral pollen sweetness. palate is just that exactly. better a bit warmer. recently has become one of my favorite styles. this one is good to develop a rubric understanding. its a tad dark orange cloudy. but at best a tangy pilsner to the oblivious. not as wheat based bright as i've had. not at tangy."
"Very happy to explore this style more. A very good beer, but I would not make an effort to score some more. thanks mum."
"D- Nothing too grand, would not turn it down if offered one but not worth going out of your way for one. If you come on one do try though. This one just was not as much for me but not bad at all"
"Poured from 16.9 ounce bottle into a Unibroue tulip. Off-white head, big bubbly, moderate and sticky lacing. Cloudy, amber body with aroma of dark fruits. Raisiny, brown sugary in flavor. Delicious and interesting in style. Easy to drink and a great overall experience."
"Pours a clouded hazed amber hue with off white head fine coated lacing left between sips. Aroma is a bit flat not much going on, semi malt bready tones a bit of a nutty edge to it with the yeast sediment. Doesn't taste off just a bit dated stale non lively brew going on. A touch of caramel malt crispness to it, nutty yeast grassy finish. Pretty boring. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied carbonation is soft and smooth, nothing crazy here. Pretty forgettable stuff here, go find another fresh German lager to compare this with."
"One of my favorites! A lager-esque-Pils like highly drinkable beer that stays in the traditional German manner. Nothing too fancy or complex, just a grand beer for beer's sake. A hazy bright copper yellow pour with white fizzy head that dissipates quickly leaving little lace behind. A nice fresh bread, mild caramel malt aroma with fresh-cut hay, and a minute amount of hops. Clean, fresh and brisk with a light body, and a basic flavor of simple malt balanced by bitter, this is a fantastic beer that you want more of. Nothing special or complex, just done right."
"The mouthfeel really shines for me. It's soft and smooth, delicate and chuggable. Great lager. Fill up the bucket and pass it over here."
"I thought that this beer was very nice. It was crisp and light, but balanced."
"The kellerbau pours a light amber/copper color. Not much lacing lines the glass but the head is white and pillowy. Some noticeable sediment from the unfiltered german lager. Smell is musky with some hints of bready doughs and yeast. Taste is slightly watery with a sweet finish. Quaff is made up of caremel and toffee with little grainy tastes. Mouthfeel is thin bodied and watery. Drinkability is mediocre. This is really lacking in the taste and aromas categories. Will skip on this in the future."
"D - I found it to be exceptional paired with spicy food."
"D: You could drink this all night and not tire of it. Is it session worthy? Absolutely. However, it's nothing thats going to impress the hell out of you. Just a solid, easy drinking, rare brew."
"This beer is thin and bland. Not what I expected at all. Seriously, this beer is practically water, there is a slight wheat flavor at the end but only if I hold the beer in my mouth for a long time. My palate is either zapped which it should be or this beer is bland. High drinkability, very quenching, overall not impressed."
"Copper in color with an impressively long-lasting head. Buttery and somehow wholesome to smell, full of fresh bread and honey, plus some floral hop tones and a bit of cracked grain. Deliciously honeyed flavor, full, sweet, bready and spicy. Toffee waltzes with bitter lemon rind to a score of popcorn, caramel, and herbs. Soft yet crisp, malty yet dry, simple yet elegant."
"D- not on par with the other kellerbier i've had, still a decent brew, just kinda uninteresting. i expect a more nuanced flavor from something barrel aged. mild and easy drinking, i could do this all day not knowing it was what it is aside from some peaks in the aroma."
"Drinkability: When i think of ""German"" biers, I usually picture something with a bit more kick to it. This is by no means a bad beer, it's just not the style i go for. This would be great for summer picnics or barbecues with the in-laws, where your more interested in hydration and food, than sitting down and studying a beer and doing some research on it. Not a favorite, but definitely not a drain-pour either."
"D - A simple, yet very tasty beer indeed."
"Pours muddy pond water into my glass. Greenish brown and cloudy, totally unappealing, borderline gross. The nose is fruity with notes of toffee. The flavor is soft and inviting. Like the nose, toffee, maybe a touch of caramel. Then there is a fruity quality with a kiss of spiced hop bitterness. Nuanced and delicate, just enough carbonation and bitterness to make it balanced. A hint of sourness keeps it interesting. Worthwhile, I quite enjoyed this one."
"My first beer of this style. Nice, but I would have liked higher hop presence."
"D - This is a very drinkable beer with thick malt character. It does not have the honey sweetness of a pilsner or the fruity, caramel thickness of a bock, but instead it has a doughy, biscuit flavor that coats the palate. The malt is a bit one dimensional, but it has a certain zen elegance and the beer seems to disappear rather quickly."
"The beer pours a hazy golden amber color with good head retention and lacing. Nose is attractive in this beer, consisting of sweet malt and pepper. The beer has no more then moderate sweetness on the palate, and it finishes somewhat light and dry on the palate. Mouthfeel is light and actually a bit watery, although there is still what I would call plenty of flavor in this beer. Alcohol is no more then an afterthought in this beer, and so drinkability is exceptional. Very nice stuff here."
"Fresh(ish) 500ml swingtop. Pours hazy dark gold with a fluffy white head that eventually disappears to leave nice lacing. Smells strongly of wet hay and grain. Sweet malt primarily with some grassiness. Big, very grainy, almost bready taste. Plenty of aromatic hop character without all of the bitterness. Surprisingly strong yeast notes for a lager. Rich and characterful. Full body and carbonation that suits it brilliantly. The kind of thing one could drink all day."
"hazy dirty copper color, minimal and fleeting off white head and lacing. caramelly, honeyish bready, nutty malt aromas follow through on the taste, but this lacks enough hop bitterness to balance it out. finishes sweet. light to medium in body, smooth, slick mouthfeel from the too light carbonation. becomes cloying rather quickly, diminishing drinkability."
"Overall it is a good, refreshing darker lager, and I am eager to try a more highly-esteemed Kellerbier."
"D: This brew is very drinkable, but not one to have more than one in a given session. It's quite filling, almost like liquid bread."
"MF&D - what affects this beers drinkability is that it is simply to sweet to keep drinking. I would be happy with a Maßkrug of this guy, but I would stop drinking it after that. that would be enough. the body is medium-light, a bit more on the medium side. carbonation is light, but not lacking. I have a feeling this style is not supposed to be too extreme in any manner."
"Drinks okay despite some big flaws. I love kellerbiers, but this one either had a rough crossing & or got the shit kicked outta of it here. Approach with caution! I will re-review if I can find confirmed fresh product, this could just be a bad bottle"
"This beer is an O.G. Original Gravity."
"D - One of those brews where the smell is decidedly more interesting than the taste. The complexity of the nose is undermined by the lack of integration of the hops and malt, in my opinion."
"Solid atmosphere (great head, especially). Has that kinda' raw, unclean nose and palette to it. Overall, really good quaff."
"mouthfeel/drinkability - wow this might be the smoothest beer i have had in some time - low carbonation is what does it and it works well - i could have many of these but i would like to know what the %abv is"
"This is a very drinkable brew that is refreshing, it is a decent keller if you are looking to try one."
"D - This is a decent brew. Complex enough to have a couple but the maltiness would probably prevent me from having more than that."
"to be honest i only bought this beer for the swing tops, but it is a decent beer. looks decent has a cloudy deep orange color to it with a lot of carbonation. smell is decent, has a nice malty aroma to it with a suptle hop kick. taste is mild an easy drinking, reminds me of sale a warsteiner dunkel or other mild german dark beers, kinda bockish, its a decent beer, maybe ill start buying these over grolsch to bottle my homebrew"
"I wouldn't really pay another $5 for one of these but it was worth a shot to try the style. It's kind of like a cross between a Helles and a Marzen, unfiltered. Pretty good and drinkable, just overpriced."
"The Mönchshof range, produced by Kulmbacher, is generally very good but I reckon their Kellerbräu is my favourite. It has a darker, more amber appearance than the other Kellerbiers I've sampled but this just reflects its maltiness. Although its clearly on the malty side, the taste isn't too sweet or overpowering, it goes down very well, and it's got a mildly spicy aftertaste. All in all, a first-class Keller!"
"M&D: not the most delicious Kellerbier I've tried, yet the quiet but consistently yeasty flavour profile with a late entry of hoppiness makes this beer somewhat highly drinkable. I've got a crash on this style of beer recently, and this bottle surely hasn't disappointed."
"Pours a hazy amber with a persistent, creamy foam. Extremely light and subtle aromas, almost imperceptible malt and nut-like. Flavors are in a similar vein, very subtle but gradually develop a richness and complexity that never overpowers. This is the closest to a session beer you can get with very clean and refined flavors."
"I was impressed with the labels depiction of the tonsured rotund monk admiring a stein of beer.If only life was really like that"
"This beer is a great surprise, and one of my all-time favorites so far. It's passively eloquent. I don't know if I got a sample bottled on an exceptionally good day, or if this beer is always so nice, but I will definitely try it again."
"It's sessionable but maybe with power of suggestion a little on the heavy side. Still, after dampened expectations this emerges to be an enlightening surprise. Well-crafted indeed!"
"Definately enough going for this to sit on for a while...fine balance."
"Shamelessly drinkable, I consider this an excellent session beer."
"Had a bottle of it at Moan and Dove. The drink had a murky, brown-gold appearance with a really good lacing. Aromas were complex with a good balance of malts, hops, slight grassy tones and some citrus. Generally yeasty taste with a good, sweet flavor punch to it. Mouthfeel was a little watery but helped make the drink somewhat refreshing. Overall, a solid beer."
"I thought this a very pleasant beer, not great, but above average for the style and price I paid (in Germany, while on a beer run)."
"D: A good session beer."
"1st Kellerbier I've tried. Pours a murky river water brown with a decent off white head, golden color around the edge of the glass. I was not expecting a lager to be this dark so this was indeed a nice surprise. Aroma is faint and a little funky. There is a bland breadiness quality mixed in with some grassy aroma. Mouthfeel is decent watery yet crisp I can't complain. The flavor is decent, slightly sweet with the bread quality rounded out by some light malts. Drinkable but not very exciting it's a decent brew."
"a very interesting brew. a lager (!) with some raw, wild character."
"The mouth is smooth with subtle carbonation. Not a session beer for me, but I would recommend you try it at least once."
"The taste is bready and leafy with a little root-beer-like spiciness and hint of caramel, along with hints of pine and lemon. It's also a little zesty."
"drinkability is great. this is a refreshing and mildly rich brew with solid concentration and an easy going character that the growler keeps nice and fresh. cheers!"
"Pours a slightly hazy golden amber with a small, white head. I was rather surprised by the smell, smells of ale yeast and malt. Taste however, has the characteristic german pilsner yeast flavor, with a smooth, dry, malty backbone. The hops balance the maltyness nicely and impart a slight grassy flavor. Carbonation is medium and smooth. Quite a drinkable beer, I much prefer this to the run of the mill German lager. One of the best German beers I have had. This is the first Keller Bier I have had, but I must say I enjoy the style a lot. The only downside was that the price was kind of high for a single pint of beer, but the bottle is cool and collectible I guess."
"After following the Mahr's Kellerbier, this one is hands-down better. A hazy golden hue shows colors of rust and straw. A foamy head reatains well and laced well later in the session. Aromas of heavy pilner malts show light signs of fruitiness and vegitables reminescent of more bohemian-type lagers. Flavors of clean, caramelized pilner malts shine with more sweetness and fruitiness than expected. Apples and pears make up the soft ester profile. A grassy, herbal hop flavor is also present at mid-palate and gain intensity into the finish. Quite bready and yeasty in flavor as well. Softly carbonated for a heavy, slightly oily feel. Otherwise clean and refreshing brew. I'd gladly take another."
"¡Salud!"
"Note: You have to swirl the bottle around to get all of the yeast chunks off the bottom of the bottle to re-suspend. The yeast sediment adds complexity and assertiveness, and complements the mineral and cookie flavors with some ripe fruit."
"D- Very refreshing and easy to gulp down, though for the price point I would have liked some more complexity to make this one worth sipping on."
"D: This is an extremely drinkable beer. It takes the clean malts and spicy hops of German beers and amps them up a bit, but not so much as to create something too complex."
"Medium bodies and tasty. High drinkability.. Good beer!"
"Been looking forward to cracking this one open. Spring is in the air and figured this was the perfect time. Pours a dark, rusty brass color with a nice one finger white head and a diminutive lacing all around the pilsner glass. A sweet malty base is topped off by the smell of some oats and grass. Tastes of caramel mixed with tea-leaves and distant hops. Mouth-feel is open and slightly bitter. Carbonation is active. Great little lager here."
"Drinkability: While this is a good drinker, the underlying sweetness from the malts would put me off it after a while"
"Appearance murkey brown off white head and good head retention nice lace on the way down. Smell fresh baked bread and noble hops. Taste caremel malt yeast slight oxidation and enough hop bitterness in the end to balence it out. Mouthfeel good carbonation mediem body. Drinkability not bad I could make this a session beer once in a while."
"D- a lovely example of the style, comparable to the Hacker Pschorr offering which i am partial to aswell. A fantastic session beer, not overly stimulating flavour wise, but a good honest hearty brew that can be drunk litre after litre without complaint"
"D: Overall a nice cleanly brewed lager with a good fresh fruitiness to it."
"Swingtop pours a hazed amber body with a generous offwhite head that leaves some sheets of delicate lace on the glass. Aroma is a bit subdued, with notes of toffee and caramel mingling with floral and spicy German hops. Smooth medium body is well carbonated. Taste is toasty and earthy with a solid caramel backbone. Complexity comes from a vague fruitiness and the spicy and herbal hop bitterness. This would be very sessionable if it were more common."
"Prosit MK"
"D: A nice simple beer to relax and enjoy. Nicely priced, I'll try this again."
"Overall, like this Beer quite a bit, and will have to explore a little more in this Beer style. It was refreshing (I hate macro Beer commercial lingo, but it really is refreshing)."
"Pours a five finger creamy head that fades slowly to a thin layer leaving some lace. Cloudy amber color. Good carbonation and medium bodied. Nose is slightly hoppy. Mostly a yeasty hoppy flavor but strangely there is also some sweet caramel. $3.45 for a 500 ml bottle from Colonial Spirits Acton, Ma."
"PS: I grilled up some big, fat Italian sausages and some Hungarian, Anaheim, and Thai red peppers with white onions and tossed it all in between a couple split brotchen and used this KB to wash it down. Man that was tasty."
"this is my first keller ; poured out of the swing-top bottle a deep cloudy golden brown w/ a fluffy off white head that exploded out of my glass, lasted a few minutes, then laced it's way down my glass ; the aroma was quite faint w/ hints of malts and grassy hops, and a touch of some type of fruit ; crisp,dry and tart, a good hop flavor, a citrusy finish ; a light body, w/ good balance of co2-body, kinda ""tingles"" on your tounge for a moment ; definitly a good drinking beer, i'll be sure to try more of this style..."
"Golden brown, lightly hazy, topped with a fat white head. Great retention and lacing, layers of sheeting lace down my half liter willibecker tumbler. The head thins a bit, but sticks around for the duration. Spicy, floral hop aroma. Very clean. Minerally. A bit of lemongrass and apple skin. Pils malt. Smells quite fresh. Toasty pils malt in the front of the sip, a bit of moderately kilned grain in there. Very clean, with a soup cracker breadiness. A very hard water quality, nearly flinty, with persistent mineral character. Kinda like real mountain spring water, and it gives the beer a very precise, straight-to-the-point character, exactly what you'd expect of the finest german beer. A touch of honey, nuttiness and faint grassy esters. Restrained malty sweetness into the finish, met with an assertive german hop bitterness. Floral and brisk, somewhat metallic in that particular noble hop way, cutting off clean with very little aftertaste. Sturdy, bustling carbonation with a fairly light body bordering on medium. Somehow, this beer reminds me of one of those severe, stern german schoolteachers with a very tight bun and horn-rimmed eyeglasses. Somehow uncompromising and unwilling to suffer a weak palate, this is quality stuff for the more serious german beer fan. A bit more complex than usual, and cleaner than most. It just screams Germany and gives you a disapproving glare. I'll have to get this again. A knockout."
"Pours a mud puddle brown color with an average egg shell white head. The smell is of faint malt not much else. The brew has a milk chocolate taste, no noticable hop flavors. It has a good flavor though it is faint, not very complex. The feel is light and fizzy and well balanced. This brew doesn't blow me away with flavor, but the flavor that it does have is pleasant. A very drinkable beer, good to session."
"This is a smooth beer that is very easy to drink. Full of flavor and without flaws."
"The taste is that of a ale and lager mixed together. There is a good malty sweetness, but finishes a little bitter in the end."
"Mouthfeel was also smooth and refreshing. Very drinkable."
"The flavor is malty, but gently so. The breadyness smoothes things out and creates a gratifying mouthfeel. This beer is malty, smooth, full yet light, and drinkable. I don't see many Keller beers, so I have an impulse to grab one on sight, and I am very glad this bottle caught my eye."
"In the aftertaste, after the notes of malt and caramel, some herbal hop."
"Very good. Not a beer I would go out of my way for and not an every day thing, but would not mind having more in the future."
"Thanks to Todd the beer guy at McKean and Charles in Waldoboro for pointing this beer in my direction. It's excellent. A 500ml swing top bottle poured into a pint glass. It was a hazy brown color with a thin head. It had a sweet aroma, to me like a caramel candied apple. Very pleasant malt taste, with the fruity caramel presence, then a little tang at the end. A really enjoyable and fun to drink beer."
"Wow, this was great! It went down super easy, and was just one of those beers that makes you happy. It makes me wonder why this genre is not more popular or common. Incredibly refreshing, I could see this being a fantastic summer lager where you want something with ""something"" and not just the same old same old. I can also see it being a great appetizer beer as well as pairing nicely with shellfish or pepper/chile crusted anything, or with an amuse, or even something like gingerbread. I recommend this highly to all those looking for more in a summer lager."
"Price is a little prohibitive though, at $4 a bottle in my area. I'm guessing the ABV may be around 6%, due to the moderate buzz it provides."
"Very low carbonation gives a velvety impression as the malt seeps into every corner of your mouth. I could drink this beer forever."
"Decent beer, easy enough to drink. Could easily drink another, but wouldn't make a big effort to get one."
"Warm and inviting, this is going well with a chili cheese dip and chips. Will need to have more of these, only $3.75 for a swing top pint bottle."
"Pours quite dark for the style, almost like apple cider made with molasses. Cloudy and little head to speak of. Nice, roasty, zesty aroma that showcases spices and munich malts. On the palate there's more sweetness than I expected, with some caramel notes coming through that drown out a bit of the bready spiciness suggested by the nose (and style guidelines). Very smooth in mouthfeel, minimal carbonation. This beer is a pretty big example of the style, lots of thick malt flavors. It doesn't have enough of a hop bite for my taste though, and that makes it lack a bit of nuance. Very good, but not the best."
"An easy drinking beer with a nice complexity for a lighter-bodied beer. On the sweet side, but it does not become cloying. Recommended for a beer with a nice taste and a lighter body."
"Really surprised with this one. Poured a medium golden honey orange colour with a white foamy head that subsided in a few seconds. Left pretty lacing on the sides of the glass. The smell was earthy and sweet. Almost smelled like flowers or plant matter, but not in a hoppy way. A bit odd, very nice, though. Taste is malty sweet up front, some bitterness in the middle with an earthy, musty undertone, then there is a very faintly noticeable taste of clover honey. Clover honey in particular, not simply honey. It's a mild sweet / plant matter taste, and I thought it was very good, indeed. Mouthfeel is smooth and well rounded; carbonation was less than average. This was a great beer, and a lovely representation of the style."
"A pretty good beer, but not as flavorful as some of the other kellerbier's I've had. I'd give it another try if I saw it again somewhere, though."
"Love the flip-top bottle (saved for my collection). Kellers are new to me; and I now wonder why I hadn't tried the style before. I love the Mönchshof Schwarzbier, so I thought I'd try this one. Wow. Slightly hazy amber color, with a nice fluffy head in the glass. Mostly malt in the nose, then the taste. Phenomenally rich malt, with a very nice and very subtle (slightly fruity?) hops flavor that really rounds out the flavor. I'm glad the bottle was larger than 12 ounces. I was very happy to ""top off"" my glass about half-way through. Unfortunately a bit pricey, but well worth trying."
"Pours a cloudy, golden russet color with a thin white head that dissipates quickly. Yeasty aroma with some bready malt in the background along with some spicy hops. Taste is clean and fresh, with a little breadiness reminiscent of fresh oyster crackers. Good summer beer."
"This is an amazing lager. Although the look of it is a little deceiving, the flavor is great. Poured in the glass, its a nice amber color without much head. The aroma picks up with fresh clean malt notes. The taste really hits hard, great malt profile, tending to a little toastiness, that fills the mouth with pleasure. The hops are well balanced with the malt and there is a bit of sweetness that completes the overall flavor. These flavors linger and are followed but a hop tang that highlights the thirst quenching drinkability of this beer. I would consider this one of the best, if not the best, lager Ive ever had. A really great beer."
"The body is full and creamy. Also has that crisp and sharp lager bite. On the finish it washes cleanly away with only enough after taste to draw me back in. Pretty good. I had been searching for something a bit different, and I found it in this. I don't know if I'll buy it again, but I'll definitely be more receptive to the style if I see new examples."
"Monchshof Kellerbrau pours a nice copper color from a brown 16.9 ounce swingtop bottle. I like the aroma, malt, caramel and floral hops are all present. Caramel and toffe notes predominate, and the hops give a nice backbone, the body is on the thin side though. Interesting style, quite sessionable. Worth a try if you see it."
"I dig it."
"D: Quite good, but fairly malty (heavy and sweet). Easily approached, but might be a little much for a session."
"Half-liter brown swingtop bottle, unfiltered with no freshness date. I poured this one like a hefe into a big German mug. It was at first a clear chestnut, but after the sediment turned a murky mahogany. It has very active carbonation and it develops a 1 inch khaki head with smaller bubbles on top and bigger ones on the bottom, but becomes a very small, thin layer. There are lots of toasty grains in the aroma, which is very clean like a macro lager, and there are faint notes of spicy/floral hops. The flavor is too clean and watery though it does have notes of the same grains and hops, but with additional traces of wet paper. The body is medium and smooth, but it leaves a short finish, and, although it is quite drinkable, it gets a little boring by the end. I'd like to try other examples of the style though."
"The beer poured from a half liter bottle a dark amber color, mildly hazy topped a thin tan head. The beer has a mild bread dough aroma I associate with many Belgian beers along with a nice malty finish of dark caramel. The flavor is rich and malty. More of the dark caramel. Mid drink there is a fruitiness, maybe pear that comes across. The finish I toffee, and a light hop citrus character. Really interesting beer. One of the most unique lagers Ive ever had. Good mouth feel, smooth without a lingering sweetness. Very drinkable."
"Aroma is sweet malts with lots of cane syrup notes. Brown/Yellow in color with a large white head. Flavor is bready and grainy with sweet caramel malts dominsting the fore and middle. Aftertaste leaves you filling like you just ate a doughnut or pastry. Very filling beer because of that pastry flavor."
"Gotta love the pop top. Didn't realize this was a Kulmbacher beer til I tried searching for it. Anyway, onto the review. Damn, this sure is clear for an unfiltered German lager. Don't know if that's a good thing or bad thing, I kind of thought the whole point of the Keller bier was that it was sort of a hazy and hearty lager. Pumpkin orange color with a small white head. Moving on. Smells nice and sweet, full of pale, raw malts, plenty of grainy notes as well. In the taste there's a more pronounced honey characteristic that I find in many of these German lagers. So nice. Also, a mischevious spicy hop boquet is hiding in there. Really tasty. Perhaps a little fizzy in the mouthfeel, but that adds to the crispness, almost suggesting a pilsnerish vibe. Almost any German beer is incredibly refreshing and drinkable to me, especially these lagers, and especially after a long Friday night behind the bar. Yum."
"drinkable? hell yes. creamy and tasty, low alcohol percentage and boatloads of appeal. my only caution is to buy this NOW (check my review date) as its been in the US for a month already and isn't getting any BETTER. walk.. no, RUN to your local good beer store and indulge in a ZUPER KELLER!"
" An exercise in balance, but I prefer some of the rawer, rougher examples of this style i had in Bamberg. This seems to lack some of the vegetal, greeny hop undertone of some others i've had. Still excellent."
"Golden brown, lightly hazy, topped with a fat white head. Great retention and lacing, layers of sheeting lace down my half liter willibecker tumbler. The head thins a bit, but sticks around for the duration. Spicy, floral hop aroma. Very clean. Minerally. A bit of lemongrass and apple skin. Pils malt. Smells quite fresh. Toasty pils malt in the front of the sip, a bit of moderately kilned grain in there. Very clean, with a soup cracker breadiness. A very hard water quality, nearly flinty, with persistent mineral character. Kinda like real mountain spring water, and it gives the beer a very precise, straight-to-the-point character, exactly what you'd expect of the finest german beer. A touch of honey, nuttiness and faint grassy esters. Restrained malty sweetness into the finish, met with an assertive german hop bitterness. Floral and brisk, somewhat metallic in that particular noble hop way, cutting off clean with very little aftertaste. Sturdy, bustling carbonation with a fairly light body bordering on medium. Somehow, this beer reminds me of one of those severe, stern german schoolteachers with a very tight bun and horn-rimmed eyeglasses. Somehow uncompromising and unwilling to suffer a weak palate, this is quality stuff for the more serious german beer fan. A bit more complex than usual, and cleaner than most. It just screams Germany and gives you a disapproving glare. I'll have to get this again. A knockout."
"Poured a deep bronze with a fluffy white head that takes its time settling,clean aromas a tough of pizza dough and herb, with an underlying German iron note.A big malt backbone doughy and light caramel sweetness with a soft herbal finish very clean and goes down easy.In a sea of ales I drank today this was the cleanest beer of the day quaffable man I wish I had more."
"Part of my gift from a Secret Santa. Medium copper, great head and lacing. Nose is light malt with some grassy notes. Taste is mainly malt throughout with a light hop presnce on the finish. Mouthfeel is light and refreshing..probably a better summer brew. Easy enough to drink, but leaves a slight aftertaste that prevents it from ebing even better."
"Bham UK"
"Tea brown liquid with soapy, irregular white on top. Nuts and moist brown bread aromas are illuminated with shadings of iron, lemon and herb. Full flavors with astonishing agility and pace render impressions of chestnuts, granitic minerals and floral, herbal hazelnut meal. Bracing, bitter/tart grip on the finish makes it super dry and refreshing. A great beer for a deli sandwich."
"Drinkability was good, it was tasty, but not as good as the Mahr's I had last night."
