"Order it at the brewery.  In the hallway if you don't want to sit, or in the pub.  An ""Oooh!"" is what you order.  Recommended!"

"Brew pours a hazy golden-yellow in color with about a half-finger white foamy head. A good amount of sediment is seen in the bottom of the bottle after the pour. Some sheets of lacing is seen when sipped. The aroma is mostly of sweet malts for the most part including caramel malts. Pretty much is said for the taste which also includes a hint of citrus, which is probably orange. Goes down easy with no bitter or hoppy finish. Smooth and well balanced brew. Medium-bodied with medium carbonation. Overall, a good brew."
"O-I like this beer even though I did not taste the hops as much as the style suggests I should. The bottle was pretty old, so I can see freshness being an issue. Nevertheless, the beer has nice flavors, drinks easily, and doesn't beat your palate down with overwhelming booziness, sweetness, coffee, bourbon barrel, or whatever. I'd buy more."

"One of the best kellerbiers that I've had. Awesome."
"Overall - This is my first kellerbier (other than Sierra Nevada's Kellerweis).  I wasn't thrilled with the beer when I first sampled it, but it is definitely growing on me as I progress through the tasting.  This would make a great hot weather beer, and if you like hefe's but are looking for something a little different this might be up your alley.  4 paws."

"Overall, this is a lovely beer, and one that certainly enforces the great beer reputation of Germany.  I've had plenty of Kellerbier in the states and nothing has gotten me as excited about the style as this one.  If I had a cave in my backyard you know damn well what I'd be doing, only difference is mine wouldn't taste this good.  This is impressive stuff from Mahrs-Brau."

"Pours a golden seethru body that has good, fizzy head that dies quick with little lace patches. The aroma is typical of pils malt and grain with some yeast notes mixed in. Beer is smooth, light, crisp, and has a great balance of hops, grainy/bready malts, mild fruit sweetness like pear or tropical fruit and also a bit of spice. Pretty good and complex beer that is easily drunk and quite deceptive."

"Overall - Probably one of the best straight-up lagers I've ever had, very clean, great flavors and body, little hop bite. Freshness may be imperative for this kind of goodness."

"Overall: it's fine. It's decent. It's a reasonably well crafted beer. But a keller can be truly great, and this misses some of the aspects that can do it."

"Bottle courtesy of Thirtybird (thanks Rian) served in a willibecker at 53 degrees. 09.06.14 indicated on the back label. Pours a dull, orange-gold with a semi-hazy clarity and a four inch, voluminous, off-white head. Head exhibits excellent retention and there are thick, textured bands of lacing present during the tasting. Great nose - grassy, lager yeast, faint light fruit towards the back, pilsener malt throughout and a trace of noble hops. Taste consistent with nose; however, there is also a light, lemony presence towards the back. Mouthfeel is light in body with a pleasant, lively carbonation and a clean finish. Overall, a great beer. Simple, yet well done and highly drinkable. One of the few places I didn't get to visit while in Bamberg, so I'm glad to have had the opportunity to try it."
"Overall: Impressive, well crafted beer. Was expecting something dense and fatter, but got a crisp pilsner with good package of malt character, perfect to drench your thirst."
""
"I found it interesting and different: a little dry in the finish and with a hop focus that hid the malts fairly well it was refreshing and easy to drink."
""
""
"Overall, a very unique beer. a 4.8/5"

"O: I had high expectations for this style and this beer for unknown reasons. Just kinda knew it would be good. And I was not disappointed! An enjoyable and special drinking experience. Hope to one day try this style in Germany!"

"It's a full flavored beer, but quite smooth and light to medium bodied. Super drinkable and something I could drink over and over again."

"Pours a light amber gold color. Glowy. It's quite hazy from all that yeast, I assume. Yellowish white head. Puffs up nicely at first. Some lacing, decent retention. The aroma is all sweet, fresh grain. It smells like high quality malt. Not an off note to be found. Just light doughy flavors with a floral hop background. The taste is similar. There's a wonderful, bready malt flavor and a bit more hops than come across in the aroma. It's a bit drier than expected. It's got a good amount of sweet malt flavor, but it pretty much dries out by the finish, and the beer finishes clean and pretty crisp. Nice floral, grassy hop flavor throughout the taste. Some light fruitiness - apples, apricots, pears - but it really tastes more like straight, clean grain. Lots of flavor for the abv. Light mouthfeel but the flavor still fills out the palate. Carbonation seems a bit low, which probably helps with that creamy yet light feel. Very refreshing and easy to drink. I grabbed this bottle before it even hit the shelf - came off the truck at a local store two days ago - so it's pretty much as fresh as I'm going to find it around here, and it definitely shows. I'd love for more American breweries to produce beers like this. It's right and light, and there's not even a hint of an off note. Very tasty stuff."

"Scrumptious."
"Pours a hazy orange with a foamy off-white head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, and caramel aromas. Taste is much the same with grain and malt flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer that is tasty and easy to drink."

"O- This is an excellent kellerbier, very tasty and high drinkable as well, definitely give this a shot."
""
"Nice brew. Great balance and drinkability."
""
""

""

"Really nice. It has that Beautiful malt profile you associate with darker German beers, and yet that great drinkability is still there. I'd been eyeing this one for a while as I love other Mahr's beers. If you like marzens, helles, and Dunkels, definitely give this a shot."
""
""
""
"D - Tasty stuff. Malt dominant as most franconian lagers but the hint of green apple and drier finish provided a bit of balance. Went well with my Zwiebelrostbraten which i thoroughly recommend trying if at the pub."
"I am glad I tried this beer out. It has some good characteristics, and although there are a few flaws, it makes a good case for the character of this style. Worth trying out, and puts other 'lager-styles' to shame in terms of flavour and complexity. Good balance all-round."
""
"O- a smooth and creamy tasting keller unfiltered and delicious"
""
"O- not too familiar with this style but i thought this was a wonderfully drinkable lager that quenched my thirst really well, which is about all you can ask for from a lager."
""
"Drinks like a thick ale not a lager."
""
"Overall (4/5): Mahr's Ungespundet-hefetr√ºb is a highly refreshing beer whose flavor profile exhibits characteristics of other well-known, far less obscure German beers. So, I think anyone who enjoys German beer would enjoy it. An easy-drinking lager that definitely brings the flavor. Good stuff. Glad I tried it."
"I really like this. An unusual style, and well done by a traditional German brewery. Something I enjoy and would recommend."
""
""
"Overall this was a tasty and interesting beer -- my first from Mahr's. I'd recommend it."
"O: This beer is remarkably complex considering it is easy to drink and not that full-bodied."

"On tap at Wino's in Bowling Green, offered as an alternative and in protest of green-dyed St. Patty's beers. Relatively low level of carbonation, but still lively enough. Very clean flavor, with a light wheat note, going just a little watery toward the finish. Overall quite refreshing. Kudos to Blake for making arrangements to have the beer served in the brewery's stoneware mug, chilled to the same temperature as the beer."
"Very refreshing beer- light to medium body with moderate carbonation. Definitely one I'd get again."
""
"Half litre bottle, poured a large head, amber colour, clear. Aroma started malty with a hint of citrus but got more hoppy. Corky taste, was more bitter than others Keller/Zwickels. Had a roasted malty finish. Didn't think it was overly smooth. Nice, well made but better on tap."
""
""
""
""
"Dr: Not a good beer to drink once, let alone repeatedly. Feels very oxidized and downright wrong. The dirty aftertaste makes me cough a bit at times. It's affordable but avoidable."
""
""
"I wasn't expecting such aromas from this lighter colored beer. Some good spicy phenols and lots of fruit. After the first drink, it was clearly about the malt though. It almost tasted like a malty cider with everything that was going on. I was suprised by the complexity, but very pleased with its drinkability."
"M, D- Average mouthfeel, but the off-flavor completely devastated any drinkability."
"D- This is a really great beer, and this is an exceptional example of why Franconia is the place for beer."
"This tastes PROPER, slightly sweet and wort-like, with grain and toasted malts. Lasting yeasty tastes, German style. Awesome, I could drink this all night."
"Overall so quenching for the higher alcohol content"
"Served in a signature ceramic mug, this beer poured a slightly oranged copper with a white head of indeterminable size (being in the mug as it was), which retained for a while then sank to just a thin layer of bubbles. Simple, no nonsense aroma of grains, more grains, and light herbal hops. Light tasting; grains, pils malts, light caramel, grassy, with an herbal almost tea-like hoppiness. Slightly bitter. Ligh-medium body, and very drinkable, even if not overly distinctive."
"O - Loved it. Not the German I wanted to try that night, but th eonly one being tapped I went for it. Completely shocked at how much I liked it. As JLindros said, something I expect to be drinking in Munich."
"O: I've had this beer a number of times on tap, and adore it. One of my favorite all-night drinkers. Waiting to stumble on a bottle to review it, as I don't like to review at bars. This sets the mark for the style."
"Overall great, what I would expect to drink if I went to munich. Nice toasty straw malts, grassy noble hops, juicy and drinkable."
"Overall Drinkability - The best in the style I've had. But this is only my second or third, so that's optimism at best and sarcasm at worst."
"Disappointing beer. Kellerbiers can be good. The Wolnzacher Hell is excellent, for instance. This is just bland."
"It is tasty."
"I picked up the bottle at Mahrs in Bamberg myself during my last trip to Germany. Good pick and I'll gladly try other kellerbiers."
"The taste is flavored by the malt which is the star of this zwickel, kind of between a Helles and Marzen this is a beer style I have only had a handful of times yet find it enjoyable everytime. It has a lot of yeast and malt synergy with dry and creamy qualities and the smoothness is delicious in a refreshing flavorful way. I recommend this to those who enjoy lagers because it is not strong, hoppy or flashy, but it is a solid beer."
"This beer reminds me of a Kolsch with how light it is with apples. This is a good lager. It has plenty of flavor."
"a well done brew with a cloudy golden color and a slight off white head. Mild caramel. With a nice head of three fingers. Nose is delicate sweet of honey and caramel and a pilsner like bitter wood odor. Palate is a nice balance of that, some floral pollen notes with a hint of funk straw flax seed resin. The malt is honey to stale grape and mild ripe apple. Great balance. Good for any time of year. Best as session in autumn."
"Pouring light amber with a dense off-white head with poor retention, the head recedes to a ring rather rapidly. The nose is surprisingly timid, with a blend of caramel, a little sulfur and some fruity yeast. Along with the caramel, there's a slight bread-like character as well. The palate opens with a blend of bread-like sweetness, a surprising fruit character, one that I'm not used to encountering in a kellerbier. The hops are fairly muted, I can't really say I pick much up. Much sweeter than I expected, there's some caramel, some bread present. The sweetness does linger *slightly* into the finish, providing a touch of yeasty character. Medium-light in body with moderate carbonation, this beer is solid. Not the best pour I've had of this beer, but it's still solid stuff."
"Sweet and spicy. Reminiscent of apples. Soft earthy yeast taste. Medium body with a quite slick feel on the tongue. Drinlability is good."
"On tap at Gourmet Haus Staudt. Pale amber in the stein, it's topped by a finger of white froth. The body is cloudy and turbid, signature of the style. The suspended yeast brings out a light fruity scent reminiscent of stonefruit. There's a pale malt backbone, a touch of toast and herbal hops. It's nicely balanced on the palate, crisp crackery malt at the forefront with spicy, herbal hops and mild fruity yeast flavors lending subtle complexity. The finish is dry, herbal, mildly peppery and bitter. Excellent stuff."
"A uber-carbonated beer, took the barternder a good ten minutes of pouring to get me a full glass. It is a dark gold with light orange highlights, super dark for a lager. Huge white head, fix fingers of head with an awesome swirl on top sticking up sevearl inches over the glass, reminds you of a ice cream cone swirl, so gorgeou. Head falls in chunks, great lacing...The aroma is light caramel on the nose with corn, light finish, I was expecting to get skunk where is it?:)...Surprsingly it isn't a super crisp drinker, but it is refrehsing...I've heard about the Bamberg lagers and this was good beer."
"Pours a nice golden yellow, with a little bit of cloudy haze. Has a great unique aroma. Its very floral yet a bit on the funky sour side. Kind of earthy/bready. Flavor follows. Big floral sweetness, which is followed by a sour bread taste. Very pleasant and unique. My first go at this style, but will be looking for more examples!"
"Slainte."
"The mix of sour with earthy hops didn't sit well with me. It was a bit stiff to drink."
"From a half-liter German bottle, bottled on 4 7 60, whatever that means. The website refers to this as a farmer's beer that is brewed with ""dual line summer brew barley"" and the ""finest aroma and amaroid hops."" It has a highly-carbonated brassy hue, with lots of floaties, and a finger of loose, tan head. Smooth and buttery in the nose (but not in a diacetyl way), punctuated with grass and hay. Nice and malty on the palate, with notes of grain, grass, and just a hint of sweetness. But the hops are there as well, contributing a firm, yet pleasing bitterness on top of its light and tingly, dry body. This beer is very enjoyable and quite easy to drink, giving the impression of a pilsner in the rough. Well-worth a try."
"It's the wood that makes it good. I've had this beer in bottle form here in the states; and when not too old it's solid. But..at the pub in Bamberg, from the wood, only after 3:00 PM...it's one of the best drinks in the world. I challenge all the ""ale-hop heads"" to have this from the wooden cask, gravity poured and very fresh and to not say that lager beer can't be exquisite."
"Drinkability: I wouldnt have this again but I recommend this to someone who enjoys a light open of wheat and bittering hops toward the middle end with a pilsner like aftertaste."
"Medium to fulll-ish in body, with an ample amount of carbonation that draws very little attention to itself."
"Perhaps a bad bottle? No dates to be found, and carbonation was solid, so I think I just don't like this beer. My advice- stay away."
"The taste is quite nice. There is a nice fairly uncarbonated tang and citrusy acerbicness. There are some overly ripe apple flavors, maybe some pear. There is some definite yeastiness to the beer, maybe a touch of clove as well. This is an interesting, complex beer that gives you something different with each swallow. The aftertaste is slight, mouthfeel is a touch watery. This is a refreshing, tangy, fairly uncarbonated beer that is worth seeking out for its novelty."
"On gravity at the Avenue. Pours cloudy straw yellow with a billowing, rocky white head that lasts. Smells of full, grainy pilsner malt, backed up by strong, grassy aromatic hops. Slightly sweet, grainy taste with some wet straw character. The light hop bitterness is more than ample to dry this one out completely. Medium-full body with lower carbonation. This is a favorite of mind--always good, but best when it's super fresh, particularly on cask."
"Overall, this beer is very drinkable. Refreshing."
"Cloudy gold body with visible yeast chunks. mmmm...yeast chunks. Fruity, floral aroma with a hint of sweetness. Wonderful fruity, yeasty flavor and a nice malty sweetness. Apricot and peach notes, restrained hop flavor, but a nice fruity tart finish. Sharp carbonation. My kind of lager: refreshing but never boring."
"The taste is simialr, but drier than anticipated. It has bread, grain, lemon, apple, a lot of toasted grain as well as dough. It's fairly dry and light, very light sweetness with balancing light bitterness as well as a light, lemony-appley tartness. It's good, light, crisp, and tasty, but slightly too dry and thin."
"I really enjoyed the beer, among several Kellerbeers I brought back from Germany, this was my favorite. If only I could have more bottles of this one..."
"From a half-liter bottle. This beer poured a a hazy orange amber golden color with a generous white head and leaves nice lacing. Aroma and taste is of grain and hay with just a touch of hops. The drinkability is extremely high on this one. I really enjoyed it."
"Mmmm...kellerbier! I was quite happy to see this awaiting me & I ordered one right up. Eagerly pouring the hazy-opaque gold in all its unfiltered goodness, made me even happier, as a fine white 2 finger fluffy head sat atop a lovely beer leaving nice bright lace throughout. A honey aroma with wheaty grass reminded me of some farmhouse wheat ales and the like. The flavor likewise maintained the aromatic flavors, but added some herbal grains and nice wheaty yeast, but the malt definitely dominated with its medium-body crisp honey qualities. Very drinkable, I love this style and flavor. Prosit!"
"the drinkability is good. it's nothing that's going to bowl you over with flavor, but that's not a bad thing. it's an old style and it really does seem to have an old school feel to it. well worth a try."
"D- Overall, this beer is a decent brew that is worth a shot."
"The beer has a beautiful golden hazy appearance with pale malt on the nose and very little finish to the taste. I feel that this beer is an exemplary example of its style, while not necessarily the most exciting thing I've ever drunk."
"Unfiltered beer served on draft in their pub. Light amber color, persistent white head. Some aroma of hops, also a woodsy maltiness that suggests great things to come. The taste is fantastic, rich and malty. It's light at first sip, but continues to blossom in your mouth. There is a light hop presence, but it sits in the backseat behind the rich grain and bread flavors. Finish is a light lingering bitterness, with the full malty taste hanging around. Not as easy to drink as other local beers, since it seems so filling and has such a full taste. But it's a great beer and worth seeking out."
"Am disappointed with this beer, and I allow for the possibility that this is simply a bad bottle. Bought it out of curiosity. If I buy again, it will not be from the same place."
"The brew pours a hazy deep golden, almost amber, with a thick white head that settles slowly. Carbonation is vigorous, yet very fine, with good lacing. The aroma wasn't very prominent, some bread and malty character with a dry hop edge. The flavors were much more than the smell. It starts malty, with bread and a slight sweetness, and is followed with a light, lemony hop finish that cleanses the palate for the next sip. This medium bodied beer is a perfect starter for an evening. It's very clean and each sip tastes just as good as the one before. Incredibly approachable. I'll be buying this one again."
"Bottom line: What a wonderful brew I just finished. It sure makes me want to try some more of the style as this one has everything going for it, including drinkability. Thanks again, Joe!!"
"Amber color with a dense rocky white head. Aromas of caramelized malt and dusty rocks and dirt with a little metallic whiff. Flavors of caramelized malt - rich sweet malt, and a tiny yeast bite with some faint earthy hops. I was all over this beer. Smooth medium body and a killer balanced finish with lightly toasty caramel malt. I came back to the bar the next day and was pissed off that it was tapped out so soon."
"On the one hand this beer is refreshing and easy to drink, on the other it is quite heavy and nutricious. An intriguing and kind of peculiar style."
"3.5/3.5/4/3.5/4"
"Poured a hazy amber color with a fluffy white head. A little light in color for the style, but pretty to look at. Smelled of biscuity malts and fresh backed bread. Hint of spice and citrusy hop in the background, orange peel especially. Strange sour taste hits right off the bat. Tastes of grain, strong, sweet malt and a kind of wet paper bag aftertaste. The rough palate smooths out a little as the beer warms, but it is still a far cry from what is expected after inhaling it's sweet aroma. Medium bodied with carbonation that is spot on for the style, this would be a good beer if it tasted anything like it smelled."
"Described by Marrikka's Bierstube as an unfiltered lager. The beer pours a 'more hazy than expected' golden / straw color with low-lying carbonation, and thick head formation and good staying power. All in all, a dull rusty appearance. Aromas of English Pale Ale fruitiness hits upfront with a soft herbal hop character. Solid pilsner malt sweetness along with hints of caramelized malts, and a deep barley richness came across not very lager-like. Flavors of rich malt blends set the stage for over-ripened apples, peaches, apricots, and oranges give complexity usually seen in those aged English beers. The low carbonation gives a sense of cask-conditioning with a soft, heavy texture. Lightly oily and flat late. Finishes with lingering malt and fruit flavor, showing hints of corn and grain if the aftertaste. Quite bohemian and traditional albeit on the diry side. This was a 'buy-once' beer for me; glad I tried it, but unlikely to try again."
"Moan and Dove finally had Mahr's bottled again so I sampled this along with other Mahr's styles. This one settled with a murky amber appearance with a stable quarter-inch head. Creamy lacing also. The aromas were good collage of spicy and fruity flavors with even a slight caramel tone I could sense. The taste was mostly bitter but had a slightly smoked and spicy aftertaste to it. Medium body with subtle crispness helped it from not being overpowering. Overall, pretty good."
"Very easy drinker, especially with the crispness it has. I had to slow down so I could finish the review before the beer..."
"Medium bodied and drinkable. The smoke gave it a nice touch that made it stand out from the other german beers I tried that night."
"Very drinkable as is this style. How I missed this one when I was in Germany is beyond me. A very good keller!"
"This beer had a dry, bready flavor and mouthfeel. The carbonation was very low. Garrett mentioned that it was open air fermented."
"Notes: This is worth hunting down. Both sides of this brew are well put together."
"My first of this style of beer. Pours a balanced cloudy gold with minimal head. The nose gives off a deep earthy yeast. On the mouth it is mildly acidic and heavily yeasty. It stays on your tongue for quite some time. As it warms it seems to be a bit sweeter on the tongue. Mouthfeel is thick from the body of the brew. Easily drinkable."
"Quite drinkable for what is basically a historical beer type and one that is quite drinkable as far as archeology beers go. Basically a thicker more bitter lager with a low carbonation level."
"The mouth is balanced and sturdy. This is one easy drinking beer. I had several non BAs with me and they all loved this beer, so it can also function as an excellent cross over beer."
"I had this beer on tap of course in a traditional clay stein krug. Since it is impossible to see the colour all I can describe is the wonderful large off white rocky foam head that this beer has. It smelt fantastic. Big and malty with a slight hop pinch to it. This beer has a very distinct malt character to it. Very robust roasted flavor that I found unique in all the beers I had in Germany. Very full mouth feel. Despite all its perceived quirks this is a beer I could drink all day and enjoy."
"Excellent beer. Can't complain about anything."
"Pours a hazy honey color I can hardly see through. Smells like wheat bread with a touch of honey. The primary flavor I taste is citrus: grapefruit and lemon. Body is between light and medium. Refreshing and good for you!"
"D: A great summer quencher, the dryness adds to this effect, I'd like to sample more of this style of beer, but they are extremely difficult to find in my neck of the woods."
"Drinkability: Another good beer for the summer months; good crossover from the Euro lager style"
"Cheers!"
"D - This was a pretty good beer. It was the first I've had of this style."
"M/D- Light, but almost medium bodied....easy to drink easy to drink as a session beer....I imagine this will be a beer I pick up on occasion throughout the summer."
"I am diggin' these Keller Biers! While I found the Monchshof to be just slightly better, this one has more of a citrus quality the other did not. Its very good, and I would definitely recommend it highly and suggest it with seafood et all. A great alternative to standard lagers in warmer weather, and to lagers in general. Give this and other Keller Biers a try this summer!"
"Taste leans strongly on the malt, which is pretty heavy and upfront. Body is full. There is very little bitterness in the beer, which is strange for a German beer. Usually they have more bitterness and/or hoppiness in it. Aftertaste is dry and sulfuric malty."
"Pours a slightly hazed brassy gold with fat bubbles in the body, a 1/2"" frothy head that lasts and lasts, and excellent clinging on the glass. Leaves raised lacing with the negative space making interesting figures. I can barely pick up anything from the nose except a clean lager character, some faint pale malt, and even fainter hops. Flavor is like fresh baked bread filled with nuts and dried candied fruits. Delicious. Finishes dry and sufficiently bitter with an herbal and floral hop edge. Bitterness lingers on the tongue for an appropriate amount of time. Mouthfeel is moderate, with a solid body on this one. Carbonation shows up and is at once smooth on one end and mildly prickly on the other, helping the flavors stand out. This one goes down quick, which is a shame since this is the only bottle of this I brought back to Texas with me from a recent trip."
"Cloudy lemon yellow with orange highlights. Bubbly ivory white head shows some good stick. Great aroma. Yeast is evident. Lemon and hay. Some cracker tones. This is inviting. Reminds me of the Herk Keller beer aromawise. Pretty good in the flavor department, though it doesn't live up to its aroma. Yeasty and quite spicy. Even some alcohol is noted with this 5% a/v brew. A little lemongrass. Mouthfeel agrees with me. Prickly carbonation could act as a palate cleanser between bites of your favorite fish dish whether that's an almond crusted salmon fillet or say a Thai red snapper with spicy tamarind sauce. Overall this is pretty good. But not as good as the last Kellerbier I had....from Herkimer."
"I enjoyed this beer as I always do when in Bamberg at the Mahr's Keller. The beer is always fresh and served in a stein krug as it should be. The beer was poured from the barrel on the counter and had ample head. It was hard to tell the color in the stein, but it appeared to be a nice amber color. It was served at about 8 degrees celsius, perfect for this beer. This is a great example of the style."
"My first kellerbier experience and I found it rather indifferent. Not too distant from any lager really, barring the citruisy tang and cloudy appearence. Poured an almost orange colour, very cloudy. A musty aroma, sharp though with strong citruis mouthfeel. A very acidic beer which affects its drinkability slightly, but still refreshing. Worth a try just to experience the style."
"EDIT: Had this on tap in Bamberg and it was arguably the best kellerbier I've had to date. The malty flavors run wild and any sourness from an old bottle is certainly absent. Huge bready character, tons of lager-yeast honey/clover, and a smooth texture. I'd probably say it's a 4.5 or better overall, but I don't really edit old reviews just for the sake of keeping track of what I have and haven't had."
"Nice mouthfeel and very drinkable. A little pricey, but quite enjoyable. I like it!"
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Watery and thin in the beginning, but this improves with the yeast addition. Prickly carbonation without much follow through. Easy, but not that interesting."
"Overall: The Third of Six Mahr¬ís Brau beers that each cost me $3.99 at Hollingshead Deli in Orange, CA. The earlier two appeared to offer above average results and this one was no exception. Let down by the flaccid nose and dying appearance at times, but apart from that it is a clean drinker that offered more than most."
"Finishes dry, a bit tart, and oxidized."
"A great introduction to a new style!"
"Very drinkable...a good beer alone or with food."
"I like this. Very tossable, yet with plenty of taste to marvel at, though not amazing, by any means. I tend not to pick up expensive imported bottled beers, except for reasons of examination, the old trial and error, but if you want to try a zwickel, you won't err with this example."
"Nice easily approachable and drinkable beer. Probably a good step up from German macros. I can't think of any reason why your average macro drinker wouldn't like this beer. I like it too."
"My first exposure to the style. Excluding the appearance it was pretty nice."
"This is a wonderful beer that gives you two different experiences ( the bulk of this review was done decanted for a baseline approach) - it is incredibly well rounded and complex but really comes alive at the end when you pour the yeast into the glass. I assuredly advise you to do so."
"The palate is pleased by the medium to medium-heavy body that's coupled with a moderate carbonation level that comes across as suitable. The finish is clean and dry, most likely from the hops used. I find the drinkability to be quite good, lots of complexity here and an alcohol content and taste that make this well worth having multiple times, even in one session."
"Pours a two finger, white head that fades slowly leaving some lacing. Cloudy amber color. Light-medium carbonation and medium bodied. Hoppy nose. Starts with a mix of hops and sourness with hints of yeast, finish is crisp. $2.25 for a 500ml bottle from Colonial Spirits Acton, Ma. Bottled in March 2005."
"Got this at Discount Liquors in Milwaukee. Noticed the date of 08 when I got home. I guess this was made in August last year. A little disappointing. Hazy apricot like color with a darkness more towards the middle. Head is sort of weaker but maintains itself well. Lacing is minimal. Aroma is of herbal hops and a honey-like sweetness. Taste is not as good. A bit of a soapyness in there. Not the cleanest but still solid. Kind of a yeasty spice bread base with light hops and herbs and sugars. A decent beer. A good balance of hops and malts and yeast. Body is not the smoothest and a little more carbonation would have been nice. Finishes a bit citric leaving some orange notes. Not bad, I am going to try this fresh and see how much of a difference there is."
"D: Very drinkable."
"Lovely orange color, almost no head, despite swirling the last several ounces to pick up the yeast. Smells of bread, yeast, hops, some maltiness. Very refreshing light hop bitterness. Nice taste. Good beer. Very good with spicey food. Very drinkable. Think of this as a cross between a Hefe-weizen and a Lager."
"500 ml bottle. Mahr's Unfiltered Lager pours out a hazy orange color with several inches of white foam. After several minutes, the head fades to a thin layer. The aroma is malty with herbs and grass. The flavor is malty with a zesty lemon flavor. Grassy hops come in at the bitter finish. Medium to full mouthfeel. Carbonation is a little high. This is a very flavorful lager. I've never had a Keller beer before. This one is very impressive."
"I didn't know what exactly to expect out of this bier. I expected more smoke from a Bamburg Brewery. What I got was a lot of woody notes in flavor and aroma. It was a decent brew, but I would of been happy about 9 ounces sooner."
"Yeasty, medium-bodied, satisfying¬Öthis is a good brew. In terms of appearance, this one is a hazy, cloudy, earthy-orange color. The head is thick, stable, and solid¬Öit leaves an agreeable lace too. I¬ím into this aroma: yeast and fruit smells of moderate intensity, but very enjoyable. I smell berries, peach, bread, and a musty, rustic background. There¬ís bits of an unmashed pale malt aroma as well. Not bad at all. Fairly high carbonation. The brew is on the dry side, and has a nicely balanced finish. Worth a try or two."
"Overall pretty good."
"I liked it, but not sure I would have one again. Husband didn't like it as much and ended up adding a dash of raspberry syrup to his, which I tasted and must say was quite nice. Instant raspberry wheat beer."
"Drinkability was very good. If I could get it at a store closer to me, I would definitely get it again. Glad I got to stop in where I did."
"BB 02-01-06, Good appearance with white and lasting head and a bronze/amner beer that has a good and thick fine haze. Nose is flowery, litle hoppy, malty with a light creamy; diacethyl like Nose. Further a carramellic smell and litle yeasty. Taste is also good beeing full, malty, good bitterness with litle yeasty note and only a slight sweetness. To bad this one is so high in diacetyl that after a while when it heats up gets more and more noticable. Still yes this is a quiet good example of a refreshing kellerbeer with good mouthfeel and fine carbonisation making it enjoyable and dinkable even with the diacethyl taste."
"It's beers like this that remind me that although I love Belgians, my heart belongs to the Germans. Poured out to a slighly cloudy medium light orange color with a nice head and rings of lace around the glass. Aromas of weak fruit and some floral notes. Hints of grassy grains and malt are also detected. Taste is straight-forward and this brew has a very no-frills feeling. Flavors of malt, with buttery hops and some light fruit character. Well balanced mouthfeel. This is a damned good beer, with a highl level of drinkability, this could be a daily brew for me. Recommended."
"As I should note the minimum characters required for a proper review."
".5 l bottle from Whole Foods, Chicago. Pours a nice yellowish head, like an whipped egg. Head sure sticks around and adds to a heady hop aroma. In fact, hops are the first thing I taste, almost roaming into APA territory, rather than floweriness of a pilsener. Body is pale as any lager, but its malts have a nice toasty quality. Thought it was pretty clear for an unfiltered beer. Towards the end, though, the cheese and wet peanut shell smell of old lager yeast comes in. Well, the bottle was seven months old, probably past its shelf life, and they did seem to brew it to compensate for that possibility."
"First I've had of this style. Took place of a carbonated spritzy rose wine with cheese. A relatively lighterherbal grassy beer that actually followed a heavy Unibroue well and satisfied. Good hops and bitter finish for appetizers in meal. Hazy golden colour."
"The beer pours a cloudy gold color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a sweet and fruity, pale malt scent with a lager yeast aroma. It has a slightly tart and breadlike smell. The taste is good as well. It has a smooth pale malt flavor that goes down easy and finishes fruity and slightly metallic. I love the taste of this beer. It has a sweet palate. They must be using Munich malts to add the extra color and maltiness. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium bodied beer with good carbonation. This is one tastey beer. It has excellent aroma and flavor; a good drinker."
"This is like a British ale without the florid, expressive fruitiness of an ale."
"Drinkability: I'm left feeling like this beer was a good one to try, and certainly a unique experience, but not one I would repeat often."
"The color is a hazy amber-orange with a average-sized head. The aroma is of very full-bodied toasted malts. The taste has a similar character as the aroma. Full-flavored toasted malt taste is joined by a touch of raw grain flavor. Very fresh and complex tasting. The sweet finish is a perfect capper for this beer. This is excellent stuff, very highly drinkable. I wish more brewers would take this style on."
"Poured from the brown bottle a cloudy golden color with a head that reminded me of a fluffy cloud. Taste reminded me of a german version of Fuller's ESB. This is good for me since I love that beer. Slightly hoppy and bitter, this makes for a tasty beer. Nice lacing all the way down. I'll be buying this again."
"I'm pretty pleased with my first kellerbier and I'll definitely look to try more of them now that I know what makes the style tick. This is a good one to lead off with if you're contemplating a purchase."
"Drinkability ¬ñ Boy, this took me back to Germany. It is a solid entry in this category and goes well with any type of strong German sausage."
"Mahr's Kellerbier might possibly be the best beer out of their line-up! It pours a typical kellerbier appearance with a cloudy golden-orange body beneath a huge head of frothy white foam. The head retention is excellent and it leaves brilliant rings of lace at the outset of the glass. The nose delivers a brilliant combination of grainy malt and floral, herbal, grassy, and hay-like hops! The body is medium, and it's very fine-bubbled carbonation gives a gentle zest to the tongue before fading smoothly away. The flavor is really nicely balanced with rich, grainy and bready malt slathered in herbal, grassy hops; backed by a solid bitterness. It's a little bit more malty than many examples, and that gives it an edge; yet it still manages to finish dry and hoppy with a lingering dulled bitterness. It's an excellent German pils with it's bitterness permeating every nuance of its flavor without becoming overbearing. Brilliant!"
"Big light bubble top over a mostly opaque dark orange. Light, sweet malts and lots of yeast. Sharp, full-mouth carbonation and watery taste. Some malt sweetness and wheat character and an unrefined, dirty hop bitterness. Not all that balanced or flavorful; pretty boring. Probably excellent with food I'd imagine, however. A good-looking swill."
"A standout beer from the BA Bus tour."
"Light-medium bodied."
"The beer emerges from the 355ml brown bottle a bemused amber color with the head smallish and frothy in texture, the color an off white as it degrades, the lace forms a sealing sheet upon the glass. Nose has a distinct bread dough aroma, sweet malt, fresh and appealing to the senses, start nicely malted, sweet and the top light to moderate in feel. Finish is passably acidic, the hops quite spicy in their bite, very dry aftertaste, drinkable and a pleasant change of pace for this denison of the dark side."
"I loved this. Very cool beer."
"Hard to tell exactly what this bottle says. It pours a cloudy golden liquid with a big thick fluffy head. The head stayed forever but there was not much lace on the glass. Smells grainy, and lightly floral. Taste is quite sharp, first some sweetness, light malt a fair amount of bitterness then a nice crisp floral finish. Carbonation ( lots of it) and body (light) were appropriate for this beer. Overall, I thought this was pretty darn good. Very drinkable, I would have this again."
"Pours a nice deep color for a lager. the head starts off nice and fluffy and subsides to a generous cap-moderate lace/stick. Aromas are somewhat barnyardy. Along with gentle malt aromas, a good dose of hop crops up. Some tartness in the aroma as well. Flavors are suprisingly hoppy for the style, and the welcome bitter is appreciated. This is a gutsy lager. The mouthfeel is nice and round with good crispness. Flavors linger and feature sweet malt, citrusy hop, and a slightly soapy flavor? Perhaps this bottle is not in the best shape? A candidate for re-sampling."
"Pours a real nice hazy golden color with a huge fluffy white head,aroma is dry and bready with a slight metallic note.Taste is refreshing and dry with a definant malt backbone with a decant amount of bitterness in the finish.A lager beer with some depth but very easy to drink,a nice find I will buy again sometime."
"Thank you to Hart at the Creekhouse for this suggestion! A fine German lager, unfiltered and beautiful. Quite good, and certainly one I'd have again."
"A classic lager with nothing removed, highly recommended. The perfect antidote to fizzy, watery, mega-processed common macro swill (hence my Bud comment above)."
"Pours a slight hazy bronze color with a huge, mountainous beige head. Very active carbonation; but then subsided once the entire contents are poured. There's a slight twang in the aroma of tartness, most likely from the fact that it is unfiltered. The rest of the aroma suggests breadiness, wild yeast, and hops. Very rich for a lager in terms of mouthfeel. Quite pleasant malty feel with some astringency in the finish, hops. Odd. I'm going out on a limb and saying it has a ""Farmhouse"" feel to it, only classic German lager style. A nice artisinal beer. Very carbonated and easy to drink. I love good German lagers."
"Appearance: It's uncanny how much this beer looks like a hefeweizen, but it's an unfiltered lager that pours a hazed deep golden orange tone with a nice off white fluffy mountainous head that is much like a weizen's head bubbly and effervescent, lacing forms here in thick heavy patches evenly rung with each sip excellent. Aroma: Mild here but the sweet lighter malts used here give off a semi lemongrass like scent it's soothing with some balancing hops used here giving it a slightly herbal quality. Taste: Flavor has a soft sweetness bready very nice hard describe butterscotch like sweetness with some fruity tones but than it finishes witth a whopping rush of dryness immediately cleaning the palate forming that crisp lager quality, quite bitter in the end as well. Mouthfeel: Light to medium in body spritzy carbonation tickles the back of the throat definitely bringing out the belches. Drinkability: I could definitely throw back some of these especially if hanging out in the Biergarten at Mahr's Brau would be good times indeed."
"This bier poured a cloudy, amber color with creamy, white foam that settled. The smell was grain with some vegetable. The taste was grain and floral hops with yeast and a tangy, hoppy finish. The hops lingered in the aftertaste. The mouthfeel was smooth with medium body and modest carbonation. There was a lingering faint bitterness. This was a good, refreshing bier fresh from the tap."
"The aroma of cut hay and hops is fairly pronounced (no guessing). The body is fuller than it appears. A fine herbal quality rides in a lightly sweet malt. A mild lemon and lime tartness along with a bit of metallic bite provides a good separation of flavors early in the pour. Bits of yeast float about in suspended animation. In time the flavors merge, blend and become balanced and quite enjoyable. I'm drinking this during a major snowstorm and feel this would be an excellent warm summer night beer...wish I had a nice grilled bratwurst."
"Good, but that almost-tart quality builds over time."
"Not bad. Slightly sweet. pat"
"Musty shoe leather smell with a slightly hazy peach colored look. White airy head. Upfront it is slightly bitter then this is followed by a slightly sweet burnt malt taste. Medium mouth but limited smoothness. Slight touch of hop bitterness in the finish with a dry tip of the tongue. Not bad but just ok."

"Murky, sub-amber ochre color, 1/4 inch yellowish head with a number of bubble sizes. Sweet, slightly cinnamon aroma. Medium light-bodied mouthfeel. Hops are nice and spicy without being overbearing. Malts are more understated and verge on a touch of honey, a diactetyl sense. Finishes crisp, with a lessening of impact in the back of the mouth. I found this refreshing. Not a majorly complex brew but pleasant and balanced."
"Start¬ís by a pouring very appealing, huge, creamy, long-lasting, head; has a golden-bronze color and cloudy;  wonderfully fresh, citric and hop aromas; very smooth, malty, palate; Very fresh flavors; and a spritzy, clean, and dry finish. This brew hit the spot today¬Ö it got above 70F here in Philly, decent  weather for this brew. Overall very refreshing brew..."
