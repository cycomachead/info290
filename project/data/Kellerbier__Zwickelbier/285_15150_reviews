"D: Pretty plain, nothing really remarkable here. The low ABV makes this a pretty good session beer but there is not much to session here."

"Beer is thin and watery but sweet up front with an odd bitterness and a strong midpalate region, overall its pretty good but not my favorite pilsner, filtered or otherwise. Just an average beer. I doubt I would have it again."
"Pours a cloudy light yellow with a large white head that settles down and leaves quite a bit of lace behind. Nose is fairly plain, with some lemon, light stone fruit, and a bit of grain. Taste is lightly sweet with some grass and grain plus a bit of citrus. Light body with good carbonation. A really nice easy-drinking beer with subtle flavors."
"Poured a clearish, light yellow with good carbonation that led to a quickly receeding billowy head. Had a nice floral aroma with minor malt sweetness tucked in. A light-bodied and smooth beer but did have some crispness on the end. Floral, grassy hoppy notes with hints of dark fruits and a minor hint of sweetness. What it lacks in complexity it makes up for in an easy-going-down-the-hatch beer that quenches thirst."
"Drinkability: Pretty good for a hot day, and pretty easy to drink a couple of. Overall, good beer..I'll be trying more of this style now."
"This is my first taste of the style, but it's an enjoyable beer. I can imagine this one coming in handy on a warm German day in a Biergarten. Recommended."
"Eggenberg Naturtrüb is one I would choose again!"
"PROST! Beertracker"
"hazy straw/golden with a white head that hung out well and left some lace. nose was earthy, grainy, pilsner malty, breadish. taste was a fairly well balanced peppery farm fresh bread with a touch of sweetness (caramel?)... medium body went down creamier than expected for a pilsner with just a faint hit of dry in the finish. i really enjoyed this. not over the top, but a very friendly and comforting beer. more please..."
"I poured this beer into my tumbler at 50 degrees. The beer was lightly cloudy and a yellow color of a regular domestic beer. The head was big and white and fluffy with fine bubbles. Head lasted just okay and lacing was good. The smell was breadt/yeasty as was the taste. The beer tasted fresh and was a refreshing brew that would be a great summertime beverage. I liked it and would buy again."
"Pale, yellow, hazy gold with a dense, rocky head. Aroma of pilsner malts, fresh dough, sulfur, and an earthiness redolent of grain fields. Chewy white crusty bread flavor with the slight hint of caramelized malt. Good soft body, mellow carbonation, and a finish just barely dry enough to distinguish this as a Pils rather than a Helles. This is an enjoyable beer, but maybe not a very memorable one, and yes, I would still have another. In fact, I bought three, and I look forward to having the other two."
"Big half-liter bottle served in a big German mug. It pours a very active pale gold, with a thick, three-finger head that imparts nice lacing - looks kinda like a hefe or wit. However, both the aroma and taste are essentially flavorless, with maybe some light malts and a touch of hops. The body is light, with low to medium carbonation and it leaves almost no finish. Average at best - a definite letdown."
"Recommended"
"0.5L bottle."
"Turbid pale golden hue. Dense, mountainous pitted porcelain white head leaves frothy lace. Mild bready pilsner malt accompanied by grassy, pepper tinged Saaz hop hints. Tame and prosaic aromawise. Snap of hop bitterness upfront leads into a combination of lightly soured cracker and dry hay. Understated citric notes of lemon. Nothing noteable in malt character beyond base pilsner malt sweetness. Well attenuated and nearly bone dry. Suspended yeast adds token creaminess in mouthfeel as well as nutty and slightly musty hints. Becomes slighty husky and chalky as it warms and not any more complex. Finishes dry, with notes of day old cut grass and white bread. A simple, harmless brew that grew on my palate. Quite refreshing, albeit prosaic. Best before 1/2004. I can imagine this being more vibrant on tap or at the source."
