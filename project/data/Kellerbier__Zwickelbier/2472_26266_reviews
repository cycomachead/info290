"Overall an interesting beer."
"overall a delicious beer."
"A good cereals beer."
"Overall, I enjoyed this beer a lot. The taste is quite unusual, but very pleasant. I wish I had several more bottles of it."
"Malty aroma with a good sized dose of caramel and a bit of fruit (apples and apricots). Fine, cream colored head leaves a short sheet of lace. Hazy, almost murky, chestnut colored beer. Carbonation in the beer is very fine, and the mouthfeel is surprisingly light. Very light malt base with cocoa and toffee along with some apple flavors towards the finish. Finishes pretty clean. From the apple aroma/flavors I would guess that this beer is either fermented a little warm or possibly that there is a slight infection. I don't mind the apple and I think that it actually adds to the drinkability. I'll be keeping an eye out for more of this beer."
