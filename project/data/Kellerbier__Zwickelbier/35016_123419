2.96,-14.7,3.25,2.75,3,3,3,"Golden beer with a white head. Sweet taste with some lager skunk and little bread notes. The Saaz hops give it a hint of black pepper spice. After taste lingers but overall A nice light bodied mouthfeel. Slightly buttery feel. Overall I nice beer but nothing really stands out. Kellerbiers are a rarely seen style, taste similar to a helles lager.","zander4dawin","Jul 04, 2014"
