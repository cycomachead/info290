Teh taste is similar to the nose with the same attributes coming forward. the mouthfeel is that of hard mineral water. I think it's fairly well balanced.

The flavour is really quite sweet, with a cloying wheat finish. Whatever, it's an average wheat-based lager, not bad not great. Too sweet to session.","Cookeeman","Dec 12, 2012"
4,5.3,4,4,4,4,4,"A pretty tasty German-style lager. I'm liking these less commonly available styles from that country (and its immediate neighbours, obviously) more and more as of late. Could see sessioning this one in a bierhall-type establishment some day.","biboergosum","Sep 27, 2012"

Flavor is sour citrus with wheat and malt. This is my first of the genre. I like this one but can't really judge it on its quality amongst others in the genre. Light body and moderate to high carbonation.","kylehay2004","Beers"

3.8,0,4,4,3.5,4,4,"Pours a cloudy orangish amber with large head that dies quick and some lace. Has a dry pils-like grainy malt aroma along with burts of citric hops. REeal light and dry as the pils malt makes it pleasant and balances w/ a touch of yeast so the beer remains smooth w/ a touch of sweetness. There is a touch of minor floral hoppiness in the body as well and it finishes nicely with a crisp backbite. Overall a simple but real good beer to relax with.","clayrock81","Jun 04, 2011"

2.55,-32.9,3.5,3.5,2,3,2,"Fuller bodied than expected and very earthy up front with floral, pine hop bitterness and a prominent zesty spice character. Hints of peppery, coriander and clove followed by bread yeast that adds to the mouthfeel as well as banana and citrus peel. A bit too spice heavy, overpowering the other flavors and an astringent metallic aftertaste hurts drinkabilty. I preferred this much more on draft.","corby112","Oct 05, 2010"
3.38,-11.1,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Brauerei Hofstetten Krammer Kubelbier isn't exactly lackluster, but it's close. Once the hops fade, this stuff will go downhill like a fat kid on greased sled runners. Wolnzacher Hell Naturtrub and St. Georgenbrau Keller Bier are still the best (European) versions of the style to have entered my glass.","BuckeyeNation","Sep 24, 2010"
4.35,14.5,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"T: The taste echos the aroma, as usual, but it takes a turn - a few sips into it, the taste buds adjust to the sweetness of the malt and the hops become more prominent. They're more spicy than the nose suggests, and along with a solid bitterness, they round it out nicely. It starts with rich malt that's gently caramelish and toasty, and then the hops kick in with a spicy dryness and lots of floral notes. Rather than finishing sweet, it actually ends up being fairly dry and refreshingly bitter.","NeroFiddled","Sep 08, 2010"

3.28,-13.7,3.5,3,3,3.5,4,"Partly cloudy golden with a one finger head that quickly went down to a collar. I did not get much of an aroma. Nor flavor either for that matter. Kind of a sweetish lager. Feel was medium/light bodied with little carbonation. Drinkability was good. A beer that 10 years ago I would have downed six without blinking an eye and been very satisfied. My how the tastes have changed. While still a good beer, there are too many better. Kubelbier just doesn't stand out.","kegger22","Jul 14, 2009"
3.88,2.1,4,3.5,4,4,4,"A good keller beer-zwickel beer is hard to find but I think this Austrian one is pretty solid.Poured a slight hazed light golden with a nice two finger crown atop that never completely settled.Aromas are of honey,toasted grain,and a metallic/iron note, a rather hefty mouthfeel but not overly so,just full and lush.Flavors are alot like the nose,lightly sweet honey with a bit of dough,toasty and crisp in the finish.A solid lager beer with some heft.","oberon","Jun 15, 2009"

3.98,4.7,4,3.5,4,4,4.5,"Hazy gold pour, true to style for a Zwickel or Kellerbier (listed as an Austrian Zwickel on the menu). Creamy froth and rings of sticky lace. Nose had a dry bready, papery sweetness. A building hop bitterness was a welcome surprise, as the malt flavor was light, and the body was similarly light and easy drinking. The hop character was a little bit grassy and earthy, not a dominant flavor, just lent a good amount of bitterness. It was a refreshing beer, and I would have had another despite the small pour.","emerge077","Jun 09, 2009"
4.02,5.8,3,3.5,4,4,5,"A hazy lager, which is okay in zwickel/kellerbier. Light orange hue. Not that pretty; not much head retention at all (dirty glass?), but a good earthy minty, hoppy smell. Somewhat minty and peppery hops mix well with earthiness which I'm guessing is contributed by the yeast. A very quaffable, spicy lager with some earthy notes and a bit of a yeast bite. This had more hop character than I expected.","marcobrau","Beers"
