4.3,-0.9,,,,,,"Taste is also nuanced and smooth, snappy, bready, and clean. This goes down so very smooth. Crisp with light yeasty presence, slight prickly carbonation. Mild cracker and bread crust. Very refreshing and so easy to drink, I hope this is a candidate for sixers. Paired well with spicy chile-infused food.","emerge077","Beers"
