3.17,-18.3,3,3.5,3,3.5,3,"I went with an aggro pour since it was meant to be unflitered and cloudy anyway so anything that I may have stirred up was not going to make a difference. I got just under a finger of fluffy bone-white head that held up nicely on this hot, humid afternoon. Color was a cloudy orangish-yellow. Nose was very malty and quite lager-like. I really enjoy adjunct-free lagers these days. Mouthfeel was big and soft, not full per se, but quite carbonated and the taste was sort of tangy, like wheat may have been involved. Finish had a lemon citrus quality, making it not only dry and refreshing but also reinforcing my belief that wheat may have been involved.","woodychandler","Jul 09, 2012"

4,3.1,4,4,4,4,4,"Cloudy pale yellow under a fluffy white head. Pale fruity, malt sweet aroma...bready yeast, honey, and soft noble hops. Nice pale malt base with a solid floral hoppiness on top. Sweet, somewhat peppery flavor and some honey and grape. Fresh and light, fairly crisp yet soft. Good, refreshingly clean lager.","wedge","Dec 01, 2011"

I'll be searching this one out!","AdamBear","Oct 17, 2011"
4.6,18.6,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,"Over all this German lager has every thing a beer geek would want from this style. A great balance of hops and barely and light body. Besides the price.... this is up there with the top German Lagers.","Luigi","Sep 29, 2011"
4.3,10.8,4.5,4.5,4.5,3.5,4,"This beer is crisp and refreshing, the sort of thing I'd be happy to drink if we ever get warm weather again. Yet, there's a real depth to it. Again, it's most similar to an unfiltered Pilsner, a style of which I've only had a few, and I'm not sure I could say categorically what makes this beer different from them. But what I can say is I will happily seek out this or other Zwickl beers in the future, and I hope American breweries start making some!","Errto","Sep 18, 2011"

4.29,10.6,4,5,4,4.5,4,"Arcobräu Zwickl Lager pours a very pretty hazy golden color with some blond hints here and there. Nice fluffy white head, sparse lace. Smell is my favorite part of the brew, it smells great with herbal hop scent, some grain with a nice spicy yeast in the back. Some faint fruitiness and just great scents. Taste does not deliver based on the nose but this is great delicious beer. European herbal hoppings with some grain, apple skin, faint nuts, and bready yeast backing, once again delish. Feel is a light bodied lager with some nice bubble activity and a crispness on the tounge. This is great beer and a growler on a Sunday would be an easy task.","BARFLYB","Sep 10, 2011"

3.93,1.3,4,3.5,4,4.5,4,"Pours a hazy pale orange with some bright white head. Cloudy but not murky. Nose is faint with some flowery notes and a little orange. Palate is crisp and juicy at the same time. Orange blossoms come to mind. Great, full mouthfeel for a layer. Really enjoyable!","SFLpunk","Aug 10, 2011"
3.62,-6.7,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Beer is light in body and wet on the palate, highly drinkable but light on flavor. I find it watery a little and wanting something on the finish. There is a mild earthy bitterness but it is too little too late. I might have it again but it would be more enjoyable if it had more flavor or body.","drabmuh","Aug 08, 2011"

4.03,3.9,4.5,4,4,4,4,"Overall though pretty tasty and a dense dough blast that comes off as refreshing.","smakawhat","Aug 04, 2011"
3.53,-9,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Pours a slightly-hazy light golden color with a good white head and some mild lacing. The nose brings a bit of very light hops, but mostly grainy malt. Too much grain, actually. The flavor is mostly raw grain and base malt without too much else going on. Light body and crisp carbonation. Decent enough, but not something I'd come back for.","Thorpe429","Jul 27, 2011"
4,3.1,4,4,4,4,4,"While definitely not a common style to be imported into the US, it's one that is admired by both consum- ers and brewers alike. Slightly yeast-hazed golden hue; the draping of white lace on the glass is an amaz- ing sight. Faint peppery notes, with grape skin, fresh-cut grass and bready nose. Refreshing with its snappy crispness, smoothness ensues in the back of the lighter body. Fresh dry grain and light, nutty yeast meld quite well together. Hops hone in for balance and give off a light herbal freshness. Finishes very dry with a clean grain-and-yeast aftertaste.","BeerAdvocate","Mar 23, 2011"
3.48,-10.3,4,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"D: The beer isn't that difficult to drink, although there's nothing really unique about the taste that would make me want to try it again.","metter98","Jan 26, 2011"
