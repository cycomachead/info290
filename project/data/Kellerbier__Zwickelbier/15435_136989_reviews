"Final Grade: 3.81, a B+. Dial ""Z" for Zwickel is a tasty, straightforward brew that supplies everything I tend to expect from this style - it is both light-drinking and full-flavoured, with a pleasant bitterness at the finish, courtesy of the German hop bill. This is an enjoyable beer, but I would not pay ""Wild Oats"" prices (six-to-eight dollars per bottle) for this one, assuming it ever becomes available in a more convenient format. Nice to try, but when I am in the mood for this sort of beer, Creemore remains my go-to."
"Overall - not a bad beer, but nothing spectacular either. Decent addition for the tasters pack, but the value here for great beer isn't so good."
"i enjoyed this beer and would try it again. Lots of German hops throughout."

"Very or too malty. Pils yeast are very strong. Mouthfeel is cereals and caramel. Not impressed"

"Overall, quite a nice copper lager. Impressed by the combination of a crisp refreshing feel and also a good deal of malty and spice notes. Very nice balance to it. This had some more heavy flavour to it than I would maybe expect but did a good job of holding with a crisp and pronounced yeasty character, fairly spicy and earthy. I liked it but its not something I would drink frequently."
"Bottle: Poured a light copper color with a medium size foamy head with OK retention and minimal lacing. Aroma consists of light cereal notes with some weird overcooked vegetable notes which are not too pleasant. Taste is also dominated by weird overcooked vegetable notes with some cereal notes and light sweet notes. Body is about average for style with OK carbonation. This one didn’t really work with me – too much vegetable notes for my own taste."
