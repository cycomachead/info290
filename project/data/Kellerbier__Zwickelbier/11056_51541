A few solids can be seen floating around. The head stands two fingers after the pour. Retention is impressive, its been sitting for at least 5 minutes and it has barely fallen. Smell is of light sweet malts, strawberries, slightly wild, truly delicious smelling. Taste is smooth and clean. I detect herbal hops, Some biscuit, some citrus.

3.34,-14.8,4,2.5,3.5,4,3.5,"O -- There is no bottling or best-by date on this beer, so I'm not sure if the mustiness is due to stale beer, or that's just the character of the brewery's yeast. Nevertheless, it gives this beer an odd character that might be overlooked in another style, but in a Pils it's rather damning -- even an unfiltered Pils.

Taste dominated by typical german pilsner hops and again, the fresh cut 'grassiness' of this beer shines brightly. Some more lemon zest and a hint of some mint here. Fairly long, dry finish with moderately-high bitterness. Drinkability is nice, I could do this 750 solo. Again, some nice stuff from LTM.","liamt07","Sep 07, 2010"
