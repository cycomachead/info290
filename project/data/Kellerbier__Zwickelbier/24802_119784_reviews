"Not too bad, but ultimately, a little forgettable."

"Overall OK, btu not as good as I hoped. The hops came though decently on the flavor but almost non-existant on the nose, and the malts were the opposite. Not very well balanced, and the lager base was OK but not great. Could use more work but still tasty and enjoyable."

"O - I would probably give this guy a whirl at room temp next time, as right now the flavors are very muted and tame. I expected a bit more... but on a hot summer night, and cold beer is welcome."
"This pilsner is more prickly than most. Although the hop provides some of this bite, I believe most of this comes from the very dry pale malt base. The swallow is dry and balanced. The aftertaste is relatively brief. The mouthfeel is a bit watery but this might be enhanced by the high level of effervescence."
