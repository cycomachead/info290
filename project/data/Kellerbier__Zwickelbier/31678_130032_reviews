review_text
"Gotta hand it to Off Color for brewing up a style that most brewers completely ignore.  This stuff pours a partly cloudy straw topped by a finger of lightly off-white foam.  The nose comprises sweet grain, sweetgrass, mild greens, and flowers.  The taste brings in more of the same, the flowery grassiness taking full root.  The body is a hefty light, with a light moderate carbonation and a rather fluid feel.  Overall, a solid zwickel, something easy to drink and unprepossessing.  Not bad at all."

"Tasted from draft at Firkin on February 27, 2015."

"Bready, light and well balanced.  Nicely carbed blonde zwickel with some hints of spice.  Tangy finish with a light bitterness."
