Pours a fairly cloudy, deep dark amber with a white foamy head. Aroma is mainly sweet with some yeast. Taste is very sweet. Like carmel and honey, with some toasted malt similar to a sweet, fresh baked dark bread. Also crisp like a pilsner, and a very faint hop bite. Finishes with a lingering candy sweetness, almost like some sort of sugar coated cereal. Nice lager.","WesMantooth","Aug 31, 2014"

It's toasty, fruity, mildly sweet and caramelly on the palate. There's a moderate hop bite to it as well, earthy in character. The finish is faintly mineral, hoppy, toasty, semi-sweet at first but ultimately drying. This is a perfectly decent beer, but it's hardly a kellerbier - more of a hoppy dunkel, perhaps.

Not as doughy in the flavor, more of a caramel malt presence, some buttery funk, rust, finishes with a grassy/peppery hop. The feel is moderate with active carbonation; finishes fairly light and sweet, unlike others that I have had for the style. From my limited experience with the style this seems to be a bit below average. It has the traditional munich malt flavor but also has some funk/grainy/veggie flavor to it.

Sadly that's not the case here, another semi sweet mildly toasted malt lager, a touch of brown sugar floods the light herbal hops tones. Flavor is semi roasty with some caramel notes just barely coming through, and sort of a tart character in the finish that actually works okay in this situation.

3.68,3.4,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"Good beer. Got this bottle a couple a weeks ago at Sam's in Chi. Poured with a light tan, foamy, frothy head and no lace. Head lasts a while. Color is a brownish dark amber. Aroma is toffee, malt, leather, a bit toasty, and a hint of hop. Flavor's about the same. Smooth, mouth filling body with good carbonation. Easy drinking. Not over sweet malty finish. Session beer.","drpimento","May 27, 2009"

Appearance is a light amber, fairly clear, with a white head that quickly fades with almost no lacing. Light malty aroma. Taste is pleasant if not exactly memorable. Light drinking, a little sweet with just a hint of hops. Finishes quite cleanly; this is a pretty easy drinking beer. Worth trying at $1.99/bottle, but not something I'd search out intentionally.","medic25","Feb 21, 2009"

3.5,-1.7,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Swing top bottle poured a fairly clear rich amber/light brown color with a puffy off white head. Thick lacing slowly slides down the glass, there is a lazy carbonation. Initial stinging malt scent, comes off sweet and grassy, a bit musty and strong. A little sticky to the palate but medium bodied and pleasant. Bready with a good heaping of sweet malts are the dominant flavors, yeasty with a solid earthiness. Very pleasant and interesting, nothing I'd make a habit out of though.","kinger","Sep 24, 2008"

Smells malty. The flavor is a tastey sweetness. Good drinkability. Comparing the lager and keller I'm not sure which I like better, as they are very similar in tastes. Good beer, but like all the Moosbacher's they are a bit pricey considering there is nothing too special about them.","engisch","Jun 23, 2008"

The taste like the aroma leans heavily on the malty side with a mild hop finish. The mouthfeel is a little on the thin size with a low amount of carbonation. Overall, this is a pretty decent Kellerbier that I think would be much much better if it was fresher. Too bad we have such a problem finding fresh beers on the shelves over here from Germany.","cjgator3","Apr 25, 2008"

The color is a nice, rich, clear, golden brown. The smell was faint at best, but what of it there was was malty sweet. The taste is malty up front, with an earthy flavour that lingered. Very little hop presence in this one, but it does have a slight bitter crispness in the finish. I like it, though I wouldn't say it is anything to actively seek out. However, for the 2 dollars I paid for the bottle, I certainly got more than 2 dollars worth of enjoyment. It is very drinkable.","Godot","Mar 20, 2008"

It has a nice malty scent that boasts of pale and crystal malts along with a clean lager yeast aroma. The taste is good. It has a very clean pilsner and light crystal malt flavor that goes down real easy and finishes dry with little hop character. The mouthfeel is good. It is a low/medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a good drinking beer. I'm lacking knowledge of the style, but from the Bros description this really doesn't fit well. It's not cloudy. The hop bitterness is low. It doesn't appear to be unfiltered. All in all, a pretty good brew.","WesWes","Beers"

A very clear, reddish-tinged, light amber in the glass with a white head that falls down to barely a covering within a minute. Aroma is of grain husk, and has a very pronounced European malt aroma. Flavors include very slight caramel, pilsner malt, and a bit of toast with some bitterness coming into play midway rather than at the end. Mouthfeel is light-medium with a crisp carbonation. This beer goes down very well. It has a smooth flavor and mouthfeel, and it leans pretty heavy on the malt side.

Lightly roasted malt in the nose with a touch of bitterness perceptible in the scent. Taste is all malt, with a nice fruity bitter hops flavor that balances the lightly carmelized taste of the malt perfectly. A bit on the thin side, but definitely not too thin, with delicate little bubbles. Very drinkable--and with a moderate ABV. Labeled a Kellerbier, but definitely has an Alt taste and color. Like the best of both styles in one. A great find that came in a 4-pack of large bottles.","tugdriver7","Jan 11, 2007"

It has a light flavor, but I can detect caramel, toasted malts, a faint smokiness, some sweetness, and light, spicy hops that contribute a mild bitterness. The body is medium and fairly smooth, drying, with lightly tingly carbonation. Overall an average German lager I'd say, almost reminiscent of a dunkel. Not bad, but not great.","mmmbeer","Dec 10, 2006"
