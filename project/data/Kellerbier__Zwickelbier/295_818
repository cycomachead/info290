Poured a murky brownish-amber with a half-inch, fizzy, off-white head that quickly dispersed into a broken, bubbly froth before settling into a tight band around the perimeter - zero lacing on this one. Nose reveals sugary caramel/toffee, biscuity and citrusy notes. Taste consistent with nose; however, more muted with some dark fruit in the mix (prunes?) and a bit of skunkiness a la Heinekin, that lingers between quaffs. Mouthfeel is light/medium, a little oily on the tongue, with a level background carbonation that evens out the body. My first Keller Bier. Pretty enjoyable except for the aftertaste. Quite flavorful and sessionable, given the abv.","Jwale73","Oct 07, 2009"

I enjoyed this beverage several times while in Bamberg, but most noticeably at the Sandkerwa street festival. It pours a yellow/brownish color and has a very frothy thick head. The taste is mostly smooth with a little bit of bitterness towards the end. This beer should be enjoyed either in a tall seidel or in the traditional St. Georgenbrau ceramic krug. It goes great with white meats, schnitzel and pommes.","germanbeer1","Nov 24, 2008"

This beer pours a pond water brown with a big 2 inch frothy head that leaves ample lacing as the beer resides. The aroma is best described as raw. Heavy oak, raw grains, fresh malt, hay, and a bit of earthiness to it. The taste is just as complex with raw grains dominating the flavor, with earth, hay, and what reminds me of just a bit of cream and the finish. The mouthfeel is medium bodied and leaves a nice oily coating holding the flavors in. As one of the more rare styles of beer I would love to see a revival of it. I find it really tasty.

Medium to full-bodied and smooth and creamy with a good chunk of cocoa and roasted malts along with some citric hopiness. Contains hints of huskiness and veginess, and finishes great with a dry backbite. Some dark fruits like cherries and/or apples and maybe some figs are in the body also.

After the aroma of shipping and handling dissipate, you're left with a very bready malt. That malt continues into the flavor, but with a grassy hops flavor that properly over-balances the malt and lingers into the aftertaste with a slight mineral tinge.

I see the yeasties in the bottle so I'll get some in here as well, but there's not a lot of em and most have settled in the bottle pretty solidly. Head is pretty stiff and laces nicely. First impression is big perfumy floral hops and an earthy/chalky undertone. Fairly dry, with a moderate mouthfeel and a splash of fruitiness. I'm tasting some dry nuttiness, coarse graininess and a moderate bitter finish. 2nd impression is some honey sweetness in this nose, but not in flavour, but there's a bit of citrus in the taste now. Fairly hoppy actually, and a bit of an astringent mouthfeel.

As for drinkability, this is amazing quaffable, as I'm already trying to figure out ways to acquire more of this stuff.

Crisp carbonation that softened as the beer warmed, decent mouthfeel. But the taste... What a fantastic example of the style. Rich biscuity malt with both a bitterness and a slightly spicy hops flavor, balanced with just enough sweetness to make it hit the tongue and go down smoothly.

4.1,5.9,3.5,3.5,4.5,3.5,4.5,"I would give this one a more extensive review, but Ive never had this style before. However, from what I can taste, it isnt wildly different from many other types of German lagers. Its got that special maltiness that is at once smooth, rich and subtly multi-layered. The most dominant characteristic is a really tasty, slightly toasted caramel flavor, but it is nicely blended with other mellow but delicious malt flavors. And its all balanced by a firm hop bite. I would definitely say that this one emphasizes the malt, but because everything is so well blended and balanced, it doesnt stand out as a flaw. To sum it up, it kind of reminds me of a well-done, slightly hoppier Vienna lager. Drinkable and very enjoyable, I highly recommend this one.","arguemaniac","Sep 19, 2006"

I can report that it poured much darker thanI thought it would, and had a bit of sediment and debris floating about. It was a very cloudy brown leather colour, and had a white soapy head that faded rather quickly. Smell was malty and a bit sour.Taste was sour up front, and bitter on the finish. Unlike anything I have had before, but I must admit, I rather enjoyed it. Its mouthfeel was a bit thin, while carbonation was nearly non-existent. Seemed quite easy to drink. Most unusual, but interesting and pleasant at the same time. I'll probably buy this again.","SilentSabre","Aug 27, 2006"

Toasted malt sweetness and herbal/spicy hops in the nose. A bit of earthiness and fruity esters too. Moderate bitterness balances the toasty malt and hint of caramel. Hop flavour is fairly pronounced, especially towards the end, and a nice combination of malt and hops lingers. Soft palate, moderate carbonation, and light bodied.

It looked quite good with a soft but steady carbonation, and a small head. The smell was yeasty with a touch of noble hop spiciness. The initial flavor was quite hoppy for a German beer. The hops were riding atop a seemingly weak pale malt base tasting a little like Juicy Fruit chewing gum. The malt became thicker and more caramelized mid palette ending in a note of sourness in the aftertaste.

There are a few flocculent yeast particles. Mouthfeel is soft, smooth, medium bodied. This brew begs to be drunk but I try to savour it. Keller biers are an under rated style IMHO.

4,3.4,4,4,4,4,4,"pours out an extremely hazy amberish/copper color, a creamy white head that sticks and leaves minimal lace on the glass. extremely aromatic, big nose of toasty malts and floral hops, with hints of musty fruitiness. quite complex and rich in taste... very earthy; bready and toasted caramel malts, and hints of woodiness. buttery, a bit tart, with hints of sourness too. medium bodied and very smooth; the flavors all melt together quite nicely with a light touch of crispness in the finish, i suspect from the hopping. a warming alcohol presence sort of sneaks up in the end too. balanced with a spicy undertone that lingers in the aftertaste. this is a very odd but quite nice brew. strange belgian qualities for a german pilsener, but apparently "keller bier" is a style unto itself. i really liked it but could see where some might be put off by it, expecting a more traditional german pils.","budgood1","Jan 14, 2003"
4,3.4,4,4,4,4,4,"it has a lot of citrus in the flavor. you are first hit with orange peels and some lemon, then a nice spicy blend of hops comes into the mix. this is very intersting for a german pils because it is not dominated by malts, and it has that very interesting citrus flavor. it is very crisp and clean with mild but sufficient carbonation. it is very complex with a pretty light body, and it is a very good drinker.","ElGuapo","Jan 13, 2003"
1.6,-58.7,3,3,1,1,1,"When I poured this beer, it was of a copper yellow with a creamy foam. The smell was of a citrus sort with a hint of hops. But, when I tasted it, I flinched at the sour taste that followed. It was so bad, that it was one of the few times that I poured it down the drain without taking a second sip. This has to be one of my all time low beers that I've tasted in a long time!","BeerManDan","Dec 25, 2002"
3.53,-8.8,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Dark gold to copper in color.  Head seems to go away fairly quickly.  I notice some caramel taste and a bit of sweetness.  I get a little taste of hops.  This beer actually reminded me a little of the Pennsylvania Brewing Oktoberfest that I picked up.  I thought it was OK but this is not one of my preferred styles of beer.  I think you could do a lot worse in this style of beer.","mjohn27603","Oct 26, 2002"
4.97,28.4,4.5,5,5,5,5,"Cloudy bronze. Great head retention. A smell that is both earthy and fruity, with notes of sedimentary rock, autumn leaves, fresh rye bread (sans caraway), and dried fruit. Round, supple, velvety, and completely dry. It is the absolute definition of "seamless." The integration of flavor is like no other beer. While it may be possible to unpack all of the ingredients, roasted malt, hops etc, they are stitched together in such a beautiful and natural whole, why would you want to? This is a great beer. The result of great ingredients and insane patience.","putnam","Oct 02, 2002"
3.55,-8.3,4,4,3.5,3.5,3,"I wouldn't consider this a pilsner-- it's falls way beyond the style guidelines all around.  Taste it as a beer in itself. The copper hued brew is effervescently bubbly and has a bit of an ale - like haze.   The aroma is comprised of candy -like sweetness w/ notes of honey-- lightly fruity yeast esters are perceptible as well and certainly are odd for a "pilsner."  Caramel malt sweetness is there as well in aroma, thus making the overall aroma odd, yet enjoyable.  Any hop nose is overpowered by the sweet malt notes.  Flavorwise, this brew has more caramel malt sweetness than any other lager I've tasted, and initally is quite sweet, but hop bitterness asserts itself towards the end of the sip and lingers sufficiently to provide for a pleasantly bittersweet finish. This Keller Beer is an odd brew... although flavorful and certainly unique, there's an overall lack of balance.  My palette is left confused.  It's defintely worth a taste, however.","marc77","Jun 17, 2002"
3.75,-3.1,3.5,3.5,4,4,3.5,"500 ml bottle. Thick foamy off white lace that is held together from a big bubbles rising to the top of the glass. Hazy amber colour from it being unfiltered. Grassy honey sweet aroma with earthy undertones. Raw palate of fresh milled grain, bitter leaf hop and earthy yeast. Bit too raw for me, I know is it an old style that does not want to change but it is not a beer I would sit down with that often given the choice.","Jason","May 29, 2002"

4.1,5.9,4,4,4,4,4.5,"Pours a slightly foggy amber or bronze color. I believe this is my first Keller Bier if that is actually a style with in itself. Slightly malted on the nose as well as some fruit aromas. The taste is just excellent, just the right amount of hop bite, with a nice malt backdrop, and nice fruit flavors / green apples I think stood out? All that and more can be tasted on the palate...balanced very well. I agree with Thrasher I would kill to try other Keller type beersOverall an excellent brew!","WilliamPhilaPa","May 16, 2002"
4.43,14.5,4.5,4,4.5,5,4.5,"Cloudy amber lager with ample head. Not sure if this is a pilsener, in fact I think keller should be its own category, although I suppose it could also be considered an unfiltered pilsner. This bottled sample is slightly damaged, either from age or travel; otherwise it would get 5's on taste from me. This is a terrific beer, full and malty in the mouth with just the right amount of hop prickliness. Roasty apple and whole grain (oatmeal?) bread flavor, simple clean finish; a great all around beer. Would kill to try other keller type beers; to me it's more satisfying and versatile than a pilsner.","Thrasher","May 10, 2002"
