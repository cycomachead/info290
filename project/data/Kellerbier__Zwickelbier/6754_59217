Of course it all makes sense: the malt that they're using would surely mimic what was being produced in the early 1900's; and given their location to the southwest of Munich a brown, semi-malty ale would have still been the norm.","NeroFiddled","Nov 24, 2014"

I imagine this as a cross flavor wise between a dunkel and pilsner- a very sweet pilsner. Nothing offputting if a bit corny Would taste horrible warm.

Pleasant grassy hops on the finish, refreshing yet full of flavor. Malts border on chocolate, but mostly stay in the caramel range. I am digging on this, I got this as a single, but will certainly pick up a sixer next time I am downtown.","twiggamortis420","0"

3.88,14.1,4,3.5,3.5,4,5,"Conclusion: A very solid little beer. It tasted like a very refined lager, that is, it had a more softer polished finished compared to other lagers I've had. I enjoyed this one, it made me want to explore the Keller Bier/Zwickel Bier style","LacquerHead","Sep 21, 2010"
3.53,3.8,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Atmosphere is pretty nice. Pretty nice rich look, and a thick tight head. Nose has a variety of grain tones. Nothing profound, but nicely balanced. Flavor, again, grain filled goodness. Overall, this is a really nice quaff.","bmwats","Sep 21, 2010"
3.73,9.7,3.5,3,4,4,4,"Thanks to wagenvolks for the extra! 11.2oz bottle into a DFH Signature glass pours a slightly hazy dark orange with a thin off white head that diminishes to a ring and leaves no lacing on the glass. Aroma is mild sweet malts, burnt caramel and brown sugar. The taste is an interesting blend of sweet malts and fruit with a nice kick of brown sugar in the finish. The beer is quite light and crisp with decent carbonation. This is a very interesting beer, one I'm glad I got the opportunity to try and would certainly have again.","atsprings","Aug 31, 2010"

2.86,-15.9,3,2,3,4,3,"Probably not quite as bad as I make it sound, but I can't really describe it any better either. (ie I will drink the other 5 bottles, but I will probably never buy this beer again)","BeerZack","Aug 05, 2010"

3.83,12.6,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,"a cloud stale orange color. something between a hef and duklewiess really. nose is german lager yeast and a mild sour apple funk. mild floral sweet... sort of wheat malt and hop blend in odor. licorice... no banana though. palate is apple with a funky grit of something astringent acidic. a mild sweet... some pollen and clove. not smoky like an alt on the brink of herbal, unstable bitter funk, and germany body. great style. consistent example. nice body.","rtepiak","Jun 18, 2010"
3.76,10.6,4,3,4,4,4,"Tastier than expected, that's for sure, Zeppelin packs on the flavor with lots of browned fruit flesh notes from the yeast. Hops taste zesty and alive on the palate, with a refreshing bite that lingers into the finish and suggests (mildly) pine and orange peel. Malts boast a superb balance of caramel and toffee sweetness. Again, very musty and organic. Mouthfeel is light-bodied, crisp and refreshing, but the carbonation is a bit too aggressive at times, leaving the tongue raw with effervescence. Overall, I found Zeppelin to be a pleasant surprise, and a damn tasty German import. Recommended.","wagenvolks","Jun 14, 2010"
