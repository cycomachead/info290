"The overall experience of this wonderful cloudy beer is outstanding. From the medieval letters to the residue on the glass walls. Top Notch!"
""
"Taste: Attack is refreshing with a good balance between the flavors, then it gets dry, astringent with low persistence of after taste"

"Outstanding example of a cellar beer, get involved."

"Had on tap in Hallstatt Austria. This was definitely a very unique beer. A very hazy color hits you right away with a 3 finger foam head. Very carbonated and refreshing taste. As everyone wrote, not a common beer and it struck me at first as a pilsner but I was wrong. Very florally and vibrant smell and the taste was the same. Nice yeasty taste with a mild amount of hops. I can't put my finger on this one, but something I may need to bring back to Boston. Great find."

"If I could go back to Austria tomorrow for a few more 6-packs I would."

"Happy to find this on tap in Chicago and excited to drink again on a planned trip to Austria this fall."

"Pours a hazy pale gold topped with a thick, creamy two finger bright white head. Superb retention and thick, splotchy lacing. Light fruit, hints of grass, floral notes, and fresh bread dough on the nose. Opens with grass and grain notes, joined by bready, yeasty malt, a touch of honey and sweet cream, apple blossoms, and apple and pearskin. Heavy light body to very light medium body. Silky mouthfeel with a touch of creaminess. This is one darn good brew and my favorite zwickl to date. Highly recommended."
"O: tasty and highly drinkable."

"O - Hands down, this is a tasty beer and one of the best unfiltered lagers I've had to date. Refreshing, drinkable and flavourful. I'm glad I picked this one at that supermarket in Austria."

"It's always a charming session when rediscovering old world recipes and enjoying their results. Only a few tastes are necessary to understand the 'give' and 'take' that recent developments have caused to the brewing scene. Though I appreciate the cleaner, crisper flavors and textures of today's well made lagers, it's easy to see that this process removes some of the rich flavor that this beer exhibits very well."
"O: My first zwickel and I really enjoyed it. Light and refreshing with some substance to back it up. Good stuff."
"One of the better Austrian brews."
"Delicious...."
"Nice on a summer day."
"O: One of the better beers I've had in quite some time. Hopefully I get to have this one again."
"I was pleasantly surprised--pours a dark straw in an awesome glass with an impressively steady head and good lacing. Smells kind of boringly lagery with a hint of skunk but what can you expect from the style. Taste, on the other hand, is clean bready malts, light citrus/grass hops, some apple notes from the yeast, lots of yeast, as there should be, giving it a good creamy/gritty mouthfeel. Nice Zwickl and there should be more in the US."
"D - I generally enjoyed knocking back a liter and a half. so i guess its not too hard to get down. It has a dry finish that makes you drink quickly."
"Overall: I really dig this brew.. it's interesting, refreshing & highly drinkable. If you're a fan of hefeweizens, and more complex lagers, than check this Zwickl out."
"A beautiful zwickl with a lot of elegant flavours."
"This is quite the beer, the best thing I've had from Stiegl so far. Shame it's not frequently distributed to the US."
"I said it before, I'll say it again, I could drink this all day."
"It was a dark gold color, very cloudy. The taste was malty and a bit sweet, though balanced and refreshing, with a big mouth feel. On the richer side of a good sessionable beer. Very happy that I tried it."
"Mellow, slightly murky flavor with decent maltiness. Rather tart. Hint of wheat beer flavors and a grainy sweetness. Hops are restrained but reasonably balanced. An unassuming, modest kind of beer but very satisfying. Good mouthfeel-- not rich but robust."
"Body is creamy as hell, almost to German Hefe levels. Smooth from the high quantities of unfiltered yeast, giving it a pretty full mouthfeel for a lager. Session-worthy for sure, the bigger body doesn't hinder it at all. Get it while you can, this will only be around for the season."
"D - Can't stand it, get this feeling in my mouth afterwards like I've been drinking hydrogen peroxide. Couldn't drink much of it at all. My first exposure to this style, but if this is what they're like it may well be my last."
"As far as lagers go, this is easily one of the best ones out there. Not my style of choice, but if I wanted a balanced, good tasting, session lager I'd go for this."
"A session beer that draws some flavor similarities to lighter and less famous hefes."
"D: Pleasantly surprised. After I read the basics of the Zwickl style I was somewhat tentative, not being a huge fan of overly hopped, grassy German pilsners. But this is nothing like those styles, being very, very well-balanced and complex, with a light-medium body and great taste. I would have no problem putting away a six pack of this, and as this is my only bottle, I'm sad to see it go. I sorta want some more..."
"A relatively hazy orange clear beer with a nice white head.. Quite refresing and slightly hoppy. Well balanced and slightly grassy. The aroma is plainly sweet and malty combined with some notes of hops. The flavor is dry hoppy - combined with notes of caramel, the body is thin."
"little head and otherwise behaved like a cloudy pale lager"
