3.6,0.8,3.25,3.75,3.5,4,3.5,"Poured into...well a stein a murly tea color with a thin minimal head,alot of chunkines and floaties around.Sweet doughy aromas with mild toast,faint lemon is detected as well.A fuller mellow feel is nice making it go down easily.Sweetish on the palate with caramel/dough flavors with slight drying and peppery hop in the finish.Not bad but it's not up there with the better traditional kellerbiers out there.","oberon","Jan 01, 2014"

2.95,-17.4,2,2.5,3.25,3.25,3,"Surprisingly cloudy. Caramel and a touch of apricot in the aroma along with some we cardboard. Caramel taste with a little toffee in the dry finish. Dry. Very easy drinking in part due to light carbonation. No head when poured, beer goes almost flat about half way through drinking this one. Not horrible, not that good, probably just old and poorly kept.","marcobrau","Jun 29, 2013"

3.7,3.6,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"Turbid amber with blonde highlights when backlit and a creamy tan head that leaves fine lace on the glass. Light toasted caramel, citrus notes and herbal hops in the aroma. Mild malty sweetness and a nice bit of caramel no doubt from the addition of hot stones in this beer. Medium light bodied with mild carbonation. With no other Steinbier to compare this to I can only say that this is a nice beer.","biggred1","Nov 14, 2012"
3.67,2.8,3,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"I didn't know what to expect from a beer that has a really hot stone dropped into it: but you can't tell the process has taken place to be honest. Nothing wrong with it, just not out of the ordinary like I hoped for.","BlackHaddock","Oct 23, 2012"
3.85,7.8,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"OVERALL: A fine lager here from the Leikeim brewery . Solid German brew direct from the source. I'd love to pair this with beer simmered sausage and kraut.","Stinkypuss","Jun 21, 2012"
3.97,11.2,3.5,4,4,4,4,"The beer is medium-bodied, with medium-low carbonation, that results in a super-smooth and semi-bubbly mouthfeel, which is just a pleasure to drink. Finishes semi-dry, with modest stickiness across the palate.","falloutsnow","Jun 15, 2012"
2.39,-33.1,4,2.5,2,3.5,2,"Dear Leikeim, please double check the assurance of your sell-by dates. That's two I've had from you that were consumed well before the date, and two that tasted like they were already old. This is another no-go.","DoubleJ","Apr 14, 2012"
3.97,11.2,3.5,4,4,4,4,"O: A solid, sturdy well made beer. Drinkable.","avalon07","Mar 18, 2012"
3.97,11.2,3.5,4,4,4,4,"Simple, straight ahead, but really good. Not every really good beet has to have a million flavors going on. Give me 2-3 really good ones and I'm happy.","Domingo","Mar 13, 2012"
3.68,3.1,4,3.5,4,3,3.5,"O- Very good drinkabilty despite it's peculiar character. A very interesting beer and i'm glad i tried it. Maybe a bit too much on the sweet side, not really feeling the urge to have it again","Cozzatoad","Beers"
3.68,3.1,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"Similar flavors of caramelized malts, bready and smooth, not all that sweet really. Lingering multigrain bread notes, smooth creamy feel and medium bodied. Pretty easy to drink, would be nice if there was some smoke to it though, if it is in fact a Steinbier.","emerge077","0"
3.33,-6.7,4,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,"Picked up a swing-top bottle from Euro Market for $3.50. Best by 10/2012. Poured a hazy amber with a short white head. There's a mild yeast bread aroma. The flavor has more caramel malt than most keller beers. I'm not picking up any hops character, but there's maybe a touch of earthyness from the yeast. I'd expect more character from a kellerbier. This is too bland.","tempest","Feb 05, 2011"
3.49,-2.2,3.5,4.5,3.5,2,3,"I really appreciate the painstaking process undertaken to brew this beer, but in terms of flavor, the results aren't that spectacular.","dasenebler","Sep 17, 2010"
4.62,29.4,4,4.5,5,4,4.5,"---This is what I would imagine for the German Brewer as a kellerbier, rustic, yet somehoe new-age hoppy and fruity-spicy. It's as if the brewer brewed it, and kept it to himself because it turned out so different from tradition, but too damn good to share. Fitting in with a style that was the ""brewers reserve""--the beautiful bready rusticality mixed with the modern hoppy touch is too good to be true. Easily one of the best Zwickel beers I've had, and I've drank Zwickel in farmhouses in Bavaria.Wow, all I can say..","czfreeman","Jul 22, 2010"

3.6,0.8,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"Taste is light bready and biscuity with grains and a hint of smoke. Bitterness is low at first, but when swallowed the beer leaves a slight bitter at the back of my tongue. The yeast is clean and only adds a mineralic twist. A solid brew.","Absumaster","Beers"
3.91,9.5,4.5,3.5,4,4,4,"It says something about the tradition of Frankischen Kellerbiere on the back so that's the style I went with.","HappyHourHero","0"
