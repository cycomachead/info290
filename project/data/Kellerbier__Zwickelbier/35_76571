The temperature with which it was served was a little warmer than I prefer, maybe 45F, and that may have affected the overall expectation, however, what struck me most was the lack of 'zest' in the body and bitterness. Good for a hot summer day, as a very light, refreshing alternative, I'd imagine.","StewPedascho","Jan 24, 2014"

3.67,4.9,3.75,3.5,3.75,3.5,3.75,"Obtained a bottle from a ""pick six"" craft beer wall here in Calgary. This beer certainly looks like it diverges from other members of the lager clan, a murky peach color with a few inches of white head. One is immediately struck by the yeasty, spicy nose. Smells like bakery shop yeast, bready but with some peppery spice and green herb that perhaps recalls celery. You can discern some sweetness as well, perhaps stone fruit and mild citrus. Palate reflects all these components and this beer is something of a mishmash ... The aforementioned yeast jumps out first, followed by sourdough bread, honey sweet malt, weedy green hops that recall fresh grass, hints of unripe apple and quince, subtle orange and lemon citrus, vitamin tablets, and something else herbal that is hard to pin down (licorice?). Eventually these malty and fresh zesty flavors give way and things become sweeter, bringing the stone fruit from the aroma back to mind. Plenty fizzy and this serves to amplify the overall sour, fruity, and yeasty vibe than I can only assume is unique to lagers that have not been purged of yeast remnants. Alcohol is detectable. Hops were not as assertive as the label suggests (""Hopped With Tettnang""!) but there certainly is a citrus node in the flavor matrix. Medium bodied with a pleasant creamy mouthfeel. The total package is crisp and dry enough to pass muster as a pilsener family member but with considerable residual sweetness and more fruit elements. I'd enjoy this in greater quantities as a warm-weather sessional.","CalgaryFMC","Dec 14, 2013"

3.49,-0.3,4,3.75,3.25,3.5,3.5,"Pours a pretty honey gold. Cloudy with great retention and lacing. Really engages the eye. Nose is soft. Yeast, a little floral and citrus hops, not really bright. Considerable malt profile in the nose. Bread and biscuit, sweet honey, cracker and lots of doughy malt. Hops come back to the nose with some sweet citrus as it warms and a little earth. Opens up with orange and lemon. The taste is grassy hops, the tart fruits in back of the hay and earth and hardy with toasted grains and doughy breaddy malt. It’s lightly dry, soft and pleasant enough. But, while it drinks friendly, it is a little bland. It doesn’t really linger and seems to be a kind of mix of styles. Looks like a belgian, smells like a lager, drinks like a bit heavy pils. Nothing really stands out as excellent but it is rich and smooth. Low alcohol content and if you like malt you could drink a few of these.","utopiajane","Jun 12, 2013"

Body is quite full for style with good carbonation. Very well brewed with easy drinkability and enough complexity form the dry floral hoppy notes with light citrus undertones.

Poured a cloudy gold with about two fingers of creamy white head that lasts quite a while and leaves nice lacing on the glass. Aroma was pretty nice, sweet with fruity notes and little bit of hop bitterness. Taste is primarily malty, with bready notes balanced out against the hops. It has a nice, if slightly understated, flavor and it's obvious it was well made. The mouthfeel has some slight carbonation at the beginning but is otherwise quite smooth and a little bit thicker. The flavors don't knock you out, but it is still a well-crafted and flavorful beer.","delta490","Apr 19, 2013"

A grainy note persists in the finish alongside very gentle bitterness. Almost medium-bodied with low carbonation. Feels smooth and a little bit creamy on the palate. Good beer, but I prefer the bolder Noble Pils. With Noble Pils not being available this year in Ontario, I would consider buying this again.","mintjellie","Mar 21, 2013"

3.5,0,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"eh, had higher hopes for this one. pours mostly clear even though its said to be unfiltered, really light yellow in color with a very nice white head. the nose is pretty hoppy, lemony and light, with a lighter grain makeup as well, maybe some wheat in here, and plenty of pale and crystal malt. the flavor is more balanced than the nose, and therefore the hops don't really get big until the finish, which is clean and fresh, brisk, like early spring itself. it also has a minerally character, elemental, not metallic, but off just a bit. its super easy drinking, light and interesting enough, with really bright carbonation and a less than medium body. it does get a little filling after a few though, which is sort of odd, but this is a decent choice for the spring box. if I reach into the box blind and grab one of these, im not disappointed, although I probably wont seek this out again.","StonedTrippin","Mar 16, 2013"

Aroma is the best part: fresh beery, malt, hop, yeast. Flavor's like nose and brings out some fruit - grapefruit and apricot, sweet that controlled by mainly carbonic tang and a bit of bitter. Despite that tang, carbonation seems a bit tame with good body. Finish is like flavor and fairly long. Easy drinking brew. Good for the spring time.","drpimento","Feb 28, 2013"

Pours hazy golden straw color with a nice 2 finger fluffy off white head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Spotty foamy lacing clings on the glass, with plenty of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big lemon, apple, pear, grape, bread, wheat, honey, floral, grass, light pepper, and herbal earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance, strength, and complexity of fruity esters, malt, and hop notes. Taste of lemon, pear, apple, biscuit, honey, wheat, floral, grass, light pepper, and herbal earthiness. Lingering notes of light fruits, biscuit, honey, floral, grass, light pepper, and herbal earthiness on the finish. Damn nice flavor balance and complexity of hop. malt, and fruity esters; with a nice amount of robustness; and zero cloying flavors present after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a creamy and fairly crisp mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with hardly any warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is an excellent kellerbier lager! Very nice amount of well balanced flavors with good complexity; and extremely smooth to drink. A highly enjoyable offering.","superspak","Feb 26, 2013"

The name is Alpine Spring, but I could easily sit out on my deck in the summer and quaff this one. A good choice if you want something that has some nice flavor, but will also quench your thirst.

There are a ton of different very subtle flavors in this beer which is pretty amazing for a light beer from the largest ""craft brewery"" in the country. There is citrus, balanced perfectly with the hop bitterness. Then, the beer is unfiltered so it has a light-medium mouth-feel to it and a bit of fruity flavor similar to wheat beers. Will definitely buy it again and try to stock up in case they stop selling it in the summer.","mttfrog13","Feb 18, 2013"

Smells tangy with citrus and bread flavors that are wrapped up in a earthy and floral blanket. The taste has a tight bitterness with notes of fresh citrus, including a little zesty lemon and orange. Bready malt mixes in along back to gives this a strong twang across the back. Dry and bitter finish. Medium bodied with a firm and crisp bite that gets a little softer underneath. This is easy drinking stuff with the sweetness of a lighter Bock beer but then a crisp citric presence that really gave this a nice snap in the mouth as well. Decent stuff.","Kegatron","Feb 14, 2013"

Hoppy notes of citrus and pine with a nice malt backbone. The taste is citrusy with a strong grassy malt finish. It has a crisp mouthfeel with moderate, prickly carbonation.

3.7,5.7,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"On the lighter end of medium bodied with a nice earthy hop presence up front that provides a decent amount of dry bitterness which lingers over the sweeter notes into a slightly dry finish. Dry and sticky with some grassy pine needle flavor which is countered by citrus and tropical fruit notes, notably mango, pineapple, grapefruit and citrus rind. Hop profile is more complex and flavorful than the nose suggests. Malt presence is a bit stronger than expected with hints of biscuit and graham cracker but it doesn't interfere with the hop flavor too much. Decently balanced and refreshing. Nothing extraordinary but pretty solid.","corby112","Jun 26, 2012"

Bright grassy notes, lemon, lime, white pepper. Balanced herbal bitterness against some clean, almost honey-sweet malt. Clean and grainy. Light sulfur note gives a more authentic feel, as does the slightly rustic yeasty haze. Good beer. Love the return to lager brewing by American breweries lately and Sam Adams seems to be at the forefront with Alpine Spring and the excellent Nobel Pils.","bump8628","Jun 18, 2012"

Pale metallic orange in hue, slightly yellow at the rims, a few very scattered bubbles randomly arrayed. The nose is not soft per se, however, it does recline into your nostrils with non-aggressive warm bread, flowers, honey and peach pit scents, picks it up some via herbaceous and salty notes, some dried white citrus pith too, strikes a nice balance between accommodating and interesting. Medium-bodied, the carbonation lends it added creaminess, gently fills the mouth. Here the citrus and peach, apple, apricot fruit sweeter, especially as it warms. The honey to brown sugar element fits in just fine here, although tends to cover up the floral side some. The salt and pepper, dried grass and mineral notes dry it out as it gets nearer the finish. Again, neither hops nor malts predominate, any bitterness simply brings needed freshness vis-à-vis the underlying sweetness. Maintains its grip long after you swallow, while easy to drink could as easily be underestimated.","farrago","Mar 30, 2012"

Hops provide a nice bite, and there are some discernible citric/spice hop notes, but this isn't too complex and I can't really say any sweetness from the malts arrives for balance (although I'm not going to call this beer bitter or watery b/c there is some balance).","clayrock81","Mar 24, 2012"

The smell is dominated by the peppery and citrus tettnang hops which are backed by bready caramel and pale malts. The hop aroma may be a bit strong for a german lager but I like it. The taste too is dominated by the hops with the pepper, citrus and grassy flavors all coming through. The malt base is assertive enough but could have been fuller as the hops seem a bit overly brash for a lager. The mouthfeel is very crisp, light and refreshing with a clean finish that leaves only a hint of the hop flavors. Overall this is a pretty good beer. I've also had this on tap and think it is better there than out of the bottle as it tastes fresher but even in the bottle it is a great offering for the spring.","fank2788","Mar 16, 2012"

3.95,12.9,4,4,4,3.5,4,"Sam Adams Alpine Springs pours a hazy dark yellow that's almost orange in color. There's about a finger of white foam that crowns the beer, displaying good head retention and leaving a bit of lacing behind. The nose is pretty solid carrying notes of crisp bready malts and lemon zest. The malt in the flavor profile is still definitely bready, but it's a bit more rounded and chewy than in the aroma. There's a light wave of bitterness that comes through mid palate before some floral and lemon-focused citrus flavors provide a nice finish. The beer is nice and full bodied, but the accompanying carbonation is just a little too prickly on my tongue. Alpine Spring is a fairly straightforward beer, but the combination of pale ale like hoppiness, and the smooth maltiness of a traditional lager, results in a tasty, easy-drinking beer.","axeman9182","Mar 08, 2012"

Any brewer is going to let a clunker slip through every so often, and so is the case with Alpine Spring. What I find surprising, however, is that this is a major seasonal offering, not just a one-of that didn't work out. The brewer lists some lofty inspirations and ingredients, but here the sum is less than the parts. Grainy, rough and unpolished are the descriptors that come to mind. A distinct raw grain flavor dominates, and the hops are blunt and nondescript.","Brent","Feb 29, 2012"

Pours a dull, light, tangerine hue with a semi-hazy clarity and a loose, quarter inch, cream-colored head. Nose expresses citrus zest, a noble hops presence and a slightly metallic aroma. Taste consistent with nose; however, there is also a distinct earthy wheat character with a hint of cereal grain sweetness at the finish. Also the metallic quality detected in the nose is not present in the flavor profile. Mouthfeel is medium-light with a lively, almost crisp carbonation and a pleasant, easy acidity. All and all, of the few Keller biers that I've tried, this one does not seem overly style consistent.

A smoothly inviting aroma. Taste is a continuation and wonderful progression of the nose. Big malt front with a bakery display of breads and rolls on my tongue. Hops are expertly done with a gentle amping up of a traditional Keller but not in a way that leaves the style. This is a superb take on the style. Finish is clean, artfully hoppy and balanced. A light dryness in the mouth lingers with faint bread notes. Feel is crisp and creamy at the same time. Smooth swallow as well.

The draft version kept a respectable head on it pretty much the whole glass. The bottle version dropped pretty quickly. Otherwise, I like the showcase of hops that coexists nicely with the malt in the finish to give you a balanced flavor to linger long after the sip.

The smell of lemon was evident and the first taste was thirst quenching. I could taste some citrus and light hops. This brew is full bodied but yet light on flavor.

2.68,-23.4,3,2.5,2.5,4,2.5,"Poured on-tap and served in a tumbler pint, the beer is a hazy, unfiltered, pale, yellow-orange coloring with a sparse coating of film. Good solid lacing along the glass as the beer moves around. Aromas are very light, with a slight lemon zest and clove spicing, but not much of anything else. Flavors are roasty and toasty, with a grainy cereal backbone, and some extremely subtle hops and citrus tones. The hops take over into the aftertaste, with a dry, peppery profile. The finish is slightly dry, with a hint of cloves left behind. Aromas and palate are weak overall, but the body and finish are well put together. Could be a good beer with a liitle more ""oomph"" on the palate.","GarthDanielson","Jan 29, 2012"

The beer is flavorful and fresh...a little tart. There is a little fruit in the flavor, orange and apple, but it's essentially a clean beer. Medium-light in body. The beer has a notable malt sweetness that continues through the taste. Not much hop bitterness or flavor, just a little for balance.","Suds","Jan 29, 2012"

Decent little bite of hops in the back that give the sweet/tart thing some balance. Wheaty malts that create a solid backbone. Subtly complex, despite the refreshing qualities, with a nice balance througout. Juicy in the middle and dry in the finish, effervescent texture near the end from a higher carbonation.

3.1,-11.4,3,3,3,4,3,"Overall I thought that was a pretty average beer, since I have never had this style before I really didn't know what to expect but what I got was a little boring and didn't keep me entertained, I don't know if this was a bland attempt at the style or if they are suppose to be like that. It did have some pretty good drinkability and I have no doubt that this would make a pretty refreshing summer beer that would be easy to drink a lot of, but right now it just doesn't hold my attention and make me want to grab another bottle. What I liked most about this beer was the mouthfeel, it fit this beer nicely and was just what it should be. What I liked least about this beer was the bland flavor and aroma and the lack hops, mainly of the citrus variety, if it had some more hops it would help balance out all those dominating bready malts. I wouldn't seek this beer out, it just doesn't stick out to me. If you want a smooth easy drinking warm weather beer this may make a good choice, but to me it isn't that interesting. This beer was very middle of the road with nothing about it being memorable. As a whole I wasn't too impressed with this years brewers choice pack, all the new beers seemed pretty lackluster and it's safe to say that I enjoyed the old beers in this pack more then the new beers, I guess I was just expecting more from their brewers choice pack, I hope the next one turns out better.","StoutHunter","Jan 27, 2012"

A pretty sweet and malty lager up front with some citrus and finishes with biscuit malts and honey sweetness really maibock like in the flavor. I miss the dry Noble hops and a bit lighter body, this one has more girth to it than the last spring seasonal. There has to be a low level of hop bitterness I'm guessing 20 to 25 tops on the IBUs, carbonation is smooth and yeast flavor tends to stick around between sips since it's pretty much suspended in the beers appearance.

3.68,5.1,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"Gotta love perks of the job, especially sample bottles. This one pours a cloudy gold topped by maybe a finger or so of white foam. The nose comprises heavy bread yeast hanging over light lemon and sweet flowers. The taste comes in pretty similarly, though the yeast is now joined (and somewhat cut) by some wheat. Very lager-y, as some might say, but not bad by any stretch. The flowers really come through big time. The body is a hefty light, with a light moderate carbonation and a pretty smooth feel. Overall, a simple but highly enjoyable little Spring drinker. Right on, Sam Adams.","TMoney2591","Jan 02, 2012"
3.41,-2.6,4,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Mild and bready, light grassy bitterness, lemon and doughy yeast flavors. Lightly dry residual bitterness that hangs around for a few moments. Light bodied, slightly fuller feel due to the added yeast. Smooth feel, easygoing carbonation. Something i'd drink again, though Noble Pils is still a favorite.","emerge077","Jan 01, 2012"

2.72,-22.3,3,3.5,2.5,2,2.5,"Taste falls apart for me, the honeyed malt falls squarely in between a watery floral hop flavor and a flabby bitterness at the end. The taste overall has no flow and is a total trainwreck of a beer. I rarely have trouble finishing a sixer of anything, but this one I was happy to be able to pawn off two of the six bottles and will surely never, ever buy this atrocity again. Shame on you BBC. If this replaces the Noble Pils I will be sorely disappointed.","twiggamortis420","Dec 31, 2011"
3.7,5.7,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"Pours out a hazy yellow color with a creamy looking head, slight lacing. The smell is citrusy, some herbal hop smells in there like a pilsner. Also has a sweet smell from the malts. The taste has a tangy citrus flavor, with some herbal notes with a slightly sweet finish. Hmm, finish can be a bit dry as well. Interesting. Anyway mouthfeel is kinda prickly from the carbonation. Overall this is a good brew but not too remarkable. Wish they would have taken a bolder route and had the Whitewater IPA as their spring seasonal. This beer is too much like their summer seasonal.","Star80","Dec 31, 2011"

3.46,-1.1,4,3,3.5,4,3.5,"Had a bottle sample of this at work the other night,I guess it's taking the spring seasonal spot next year with the Noble Pils becoming year around.Poured lighter hazed golden with a well formed 1/2 finger sticky white head atop.Some honey malt in the nose and that is basically it,faint lemon as well.Sweetish honey flavors at the onset with some firm toasted grain flavors,a smattering herbal hops in the finish with faint lemon.Not bad I think it is a good selection for a spring seasonal,its lighter but with a little substance.","oberon","Dec 23, 2011"

The balance makes this an awesome session beer. Sam really did well with this new seasonal..","BDIMike","Dec 21, 2011"
