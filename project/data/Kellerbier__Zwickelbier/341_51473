4.02,6.9,3.5,4,4.25,3.5,4,"This beer pours with about a finger of foamy white head. Despite the unfiltered nature of the brew, there is little cloudiness (I will swirl the next one, I know I can get those tasty yeasts to comply!). In the aroma you get lots of grain and bread; almost cracker-like. The flavor comes off as largely the same as the aroma, very bready, almost like taking a fist full of pale (pilsner?) malt in your mouth (this Keller bier is definitely infinitely tastier I am certain). Although the complexity is nothing like something with various adjuncts and a major ABV, this beer is very refreshing and really fits the bill when you want to have a few beers without feeling too bloated or drunk.","LiquidCucumber","Feb 27, 2013"

Light in alcohol and refreshing, this is a great summer beer, or for anytime you want a nice flavorful beer that isnt going to wreck your taste buds or sobriety. This is only my second keller/zwickel, and i will definitely seek out more. I think this edges out fat head's example by being slightly more complex. Will buy again for sure and hope i can score some more before it's gone for the year.","headbucket","Aug 16, 2012"

The smell is loaded with a sweet light graininess and no bitterness whatsoever. The taste is super drinkable, with the taste dominated by corn and grain. I love this German beer from what Ive learned is on of the better small breweries in OH.","VncentLIFE","Jul 24, 2012"

4.03,7.2,4.5,4,4,4,4,"Pours a semi clouded yellow golden color with massive white head flowing thick, big chunky head at that with velvet smooth texture. Lacing is scattered nice and random around my big oversized glass. Aroma has lemon essence with biscuit dough rising in the morning kitchen, flavorwise it's a beautiful thing fresh with biscuit dough bread lightly toasted malt sweetness. Ample German hops to balance out the sweetness leaving a semi dry finish, perfect summer beer these guys from Columbus brewing are dead on. Mouthfeel is light ample lively carbonation jumps off the palate and into my senses, amazing flowing beer with enough girth from yeast sediment to truly fulfill your thirst and hunger. Overall intense simple complexity to breed drinkability if that makes sense.","WVbeergeek","May 23, 2012"
3.8,1.1,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Summer Teeth is a nice Kellerbier. It’s not a style that features a ton of pizzazz, but this is a nice release. It’s pretty straight forward, tasty, and easy to drink.

3.58,-4.8,4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"12 ounce bottle (2011 batch with new label). Served in a mug, the beer pours a hazy gold color with about an inch off-white head. Head retention and lacing are both good. Aroma is grainy (wheat?) and sweet malt, citrusy hops (lemon peel), and a bit of grassy hops. Taste is similar to the aroma, it tastes mostly like grain/wheat/bready malt and some citrusy hops (lemon peel). Mouthfeel/body is light, it's crisp and easy to drink. I think it's a nice refreshing brew, a good choice for summertime. I can't believe I haven't tried this before, I might have to pick up some of this over the summer. Definitely worth a try.","bluejacket74","Apr 14, 2011"

Not terribly strong. Taste is pretty clean - bready, little bit of honey, slight hop bitterness toward the end. Light mouthfeel - very appropriate. This is a great summer beer - easy to drink, goes well with all the summer foods.","ndekke39","0"
