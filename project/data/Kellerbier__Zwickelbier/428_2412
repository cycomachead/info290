Some sheets of lacing is seen when sipped. The aroma is mostly of sweet malts for the most part including caramel malts. Pretty much is said for the taste which also includes a hint of citrus, which is probably orange. Goes down easy with no bitter or hoppy finish. Smooth and well balanced brew. Medium-bodied with medium carbonation. Overall, a good brew.","BeerWithMike","Feb 15, 2015"

Nevertheless, the beer has nice flavors, drinks easily, and doesn't beat your palate down with overwhelming booziness, sweetness, coffee, bourbon barrel, or whatever.

Pours a dull, orange-gold with a semi-hazy clarity and a four inch, voluminous, off-white head. Head exhibits excellent retention and there are thick, textured bands of lacing present during the tasting. Great nose - grassy, lager yeast, faint light fruit towards the back, pilsener malt throughout and a trace of noble hops. Taste consistent with nose; however, there is also a light, lemony presence towards the back. Mouthfeel is light in body with a pleasant, lively carbonation and a clean finish. Overall, a great beer. Simple, yet well done and highly drinkable. One of the few places I didn't get to visit while in Bamberg, so I'm glad to have had the opportunity to try it.","Jwale73","Mar 09, 2014"

4.18,5,4,4,4.25,4.25,4.25,"Pours a light amber gold color. Glowy. It's quite hazy from all that yeast, I assume. Yellowish white head. Puffs up nicely at first. Some lacing, decent retention. The aroma is all sweet, fresh grain. It smells like high quality malt. Not an off note to be found. Just light doughy flavors with a floral hop background. The taste is similar. There's a wonderful, bready malt flavor and a bit more hops than come across in the aroma. It's a bit drier than expected. It's got a good amount of sweet malt flavor, but it pretty much dries out by the finish, and the beer finishes clean and pretty crisp. Nice floral, grassy hop flavor throughout the taste. Some light fruitiness - apples, apricots, pears - but it really tastes more like straight, clean grain. Lots of flavor for the abv. Light mouthfeel but the flavor still fills out the palate. Carbonation seems a bit low, which probably helps with that creamy yet light feel. Very refreshing and easy to drink. I grabbed this bottle before it even hit the shelf - came off the truck at a local store two days ago - so it's pretty much as fresh as I'm going to find it around here, and it definitely shows. I'd love for more American breweries to produce beers like this. It's right and light, and there's not even a hint of an off note. Very tasty stuff.","popery","Jul 12, 2013"

It has a lot of yeast and malt synergy with dry and creamy qualities and the smoothness is delicious in a refreshing flavorful way.

The palate opens with a blend of bread-like sweetness, a surprising fruit character, one that I'm not used to encountering in a kellerbier. The hops are fairly muted, I can't really say I pick much up. Much sweeter than I expected, there's some caramel, some bread present. The sweetness does linger *slightly* into the finish, providing a touch of yeasty character. Medium-light in body with moderate carbonation, this beer is solid.

Nice and malty on the palate, with notes of grain, grass, and just a hint of sweetness.

The taste is fantastic, rich and malty. It's light at first sip, but continues to blossom in your mouth. There is a light hop presence, but it sits in the backseat behind the rich grain and bread flavors. Finish is a light lingering bitterness, with the full malty taste hanging around.

It starts malty, with bread and a slight sweetness, and is followed with a light, lemony hop finish that cleanses the palate for the next sip.

3.11,-21.9,4,3,3,3.5,3,"Described by Marrikka's Bierstube as an unfiltered lager. The beer pours a 'more hazy than expected' golden / straw color with low-lying carbonation, and thick head formation and good staying power. All in all, a dull rusty appearance. Aromas of English Pale Ale fruitiness hits upfront with a soft herbal hop character. Solid pilsner malt sweetness along with hints of caramelized malts, and a deep barley richness came across not very lager-like. Flavors of rich malt blends set the stage for over-ripened apples, peaches, apricots, and oranges give complexity usually seen in those aged English beers. The low carbonation gives a sense of cask-conditioning with a soft, heavy texture. Lightly oily and flat late. Finishes with lingering malt and fruit flavor, showing hints of corn and grain if the aftertaste. Quite bohemian and traditional albeit on the diry side.

Prickly carbonation could act as a palate cleanser between bites of your favorite fish dish whether that's an almond crusted salmon fillet or say a Thai red snapper with spicy tamarind sauce.

Taste is not as good. A bit of a soapyness in there. Not the cleanest but still solid. Kind of a yeasty spice bread base with light hops and herbs and sugars. A decent beer. A good balance of hops and malts and yeast. Body is not the smoothest and a little more carbonation would have been nice. Finishes a bit citric leaving some orange notes. Not bad, I am going to try this fresh and see how much of a difference there is.","granger10","Apr 10, 2006"

The aroma is malty with herbs and grass. The flavor is malty with a zesty lemon flavor. Grassy hops come in at the bitter finish. Medium to full mouthfeel. Carbonation is a little high.

The head is thick, stable, and solidit leaves an agreeable lace too. Im into this aroma: yeast and fruit smells of moderate intensity, but very enjoyable. I smell berries, peach, bread, and a musty, rustic background. Theres bits of an unmashed pale malt aroma as well. Not bad at all. Fairly high carbonation. The brew is on the dry side, and has a nicely balanced finish. Worth a try or two.","Suds","Jan 21, 2006"

Taste is also good beeing full, malty, good bitterness with litle yeasty note and only a slight sweetness. To bad this one is so high in diacetyl that after a while when it heats up gets more and more noticable. Still yes this is a quiet good example of a refreshing kellerbeer with good mouthfeel and fine carbonisation making it enjoyable and dinkable even with the diacethyl taste.","paterlodie","Sep 19, 2005"

Poured out to a slighly cloudy medium light orange color with a nice head and rings of lace around the glass. Aromas of weak fruit and some floral notes. Hints of grassy grains and malt are also detected. Taste is straight-forward and this brew has a very no-frills feeling. Flavors of malt, with buttery hops and some light fruit character. Well balanced mouthfeel. This is a damned good beer, with a highl level of drinkability, this could be a daily brew for me. Recommended.","Frozensoul327","Sep 04, 2005"

3.13,-21.4,4,3.5,3,2.5,3,".5 l bottle from Whole Foods, Chicago. Pours a nice yellowish head, like an whipped egg. Head sure sticks around and adds to a heady hop aroma. In fact, hops are the first thing I taste, almost roaming into APA territory, rather than floweriness of a pilsener. Body is pale as any lager, but its malts have a nice toasty quality. Thought it was pretty clear for an unfiltered beer. Towards the end, though, the cheese and wet peanut shell smell of old lager yeast comes in. Well, the bottle was seven months old, probably past its shelf life, and they did seem to brew it to compensate for that possibility.","DrunkMcDermott","Jul 25, 2005"

It has a slightly tart and breadlike smell. The taste is good as well. It has a smooth pale malt flavor that goes down easy and finishes fruity and slightly metallic. I love the taste of this beer. It has a sweet palate. They must be using Munich malts to add the extra color and maltiness. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium bodied beer with good carbonation. This is one tastey beer.

4.5,13.1,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Mahr's Kellerbier might possibly be the best beer out of their line-up! It pours a typical kellerbier appearance with a cloudy golden-orange body beneath a huge head of frothy white foam. The head retention is excellent and it leaves brilliant rings of lace at the outset of the glass. The nose delivers a brilliant combination of grainy malt and floral, herbal, grassy, and hay-like hops! The body is medium, and it's very fine-bubbled carbonation gives a gentle zest to the tongue before fading smoothly away. The flavor is really nicely balanced with rich, grainy and bready malt slathered in herbal, grassy hops; backed by a solid bitterness. It's a little bit more malty than many examples, and that gives it an edge; yet it still manages to finish dry and hoppy with a lingering dulled bitterness. It's an excellent German pils with it's bitterness permeating every nuance of its flavor without becoming overbearing. Brilliant!","NeroFiddled","Nov 21, 2004"

Smells grainy, and lightly floral. Taste is quite sharp, first some sweetness, light malt a fair amount of bitterness then a nice crisp floral finish. Carbonation ( lots of it) and body (light) were appropriate for this beer. Overall, I thought this was pretty darn good. Very drinkable, I would have this again.","Bierguy5","May 19, 2004"

Along with gentle malt aromas, a good dose of hop crops up. Some tartness in the aroma as well. Flavors are suprisingly hoppy for the style, and the welcome bitter is appreciated. This is a gutsy lager. The mouthfeel is nice and round with good crispness. Flavors linger and feature sweet malt, citrusy hop, and a slightly soapy flavor? Perhaps this bottle is not in the best shape? A candidate for re-sampling.","moulefrite","Apr 05, 2004"

4,0.5,4,4,4,4,4,"Pours a slight hazy bronze color with a huge, mountainous beige head. Very active carbonation; but then subsided once the entire contents are poured. There's a slight twang in the aroma of tartness, most likely from the fact that it is unfiltered. The rest of the aroma suggests breadiness, wild yeast, and hops. Very rich for a lager in terms of mouthfeel. Quite pleasant malty feel with some astringency in the finish, hops. Odd. I'm going out on a limb and saying it has a ""Farmhouse"" feel to it, only classic German lager style. A nice artisinal beer. Very carbonated and easy to drink.

Aroma: Mild here but the sweet lighter malts used here give off a semi lemongrass like scent it's soothing with some balancing hops used here giving it a slightly herbal quality. Taste: Flavor has a soft sweetness bready very nice hard describe butterscotch like sweetness with some fruity tones but than it finishes witth a whopping rush of dryness immediately cleaning the palate forming that crisp lager quality, quite bitter in the end as well. Mouthfeel: Light to medium in body spritzy carbonation tickles the back of the throat definitely bringing out the belches.

4.03,1.3,4.5,4,4,4,4,"The aroma of cut hay and hops is fairly pronounced (no guessing). The body is fuller than it appears. A fine herbal quality rides in a lightly sweet malt. A mild lemon and lime tartness along with a bit of metallic bite provides a good separation of flavors early in the pour. Bits of yeast float about in suspended animation.
