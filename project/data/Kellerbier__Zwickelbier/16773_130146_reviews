"O:  Really good, I definitely recommend.  As noted above, deviates from the original style but in a good way."

"I paired this with a slice of apple pie and it was exquisite.  The apples cut the kind of heavy yeast-hop feel that the beer has (and I feel like a lot of Kellerbiers have) while the sweetness kind of brought out the sweaty, funky yeast character of the beer.  Would definitely recommend it!"
