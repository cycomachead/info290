"Overall: Pleasant and refreshing with enough character to keep it interesting. Quite drinkable."

"The beer has a wonderful light crisp malt body, possibly with wheat. A beautiful touch of sweetness with notes of fruity honey. An extremely drinkable brew with a wonderful balance of sweetness and crisp German brewing."
"The head on this beer is amazing. Retention and lacing are very good. It's got a bit of chill haze, which seems to accentuate the dark orange colour. The smell is characteristic of a Kellerbier, but even so it's never been one of my favourite things about this type of beer. It smells quite musty, with a little grass and sour cherry. The taste is actually quite neutral - refreshing, light, grainy, but not too much emphasis on either the malts or the hops. Mouthfeel is very dry, with a medium body. It's hard to score a Kellerbier high, but this one's one of the better examples in Bavaria."

"Overall, not bad."
"I really like this style. But I would like to have even more of those complex unclean flavours!"
