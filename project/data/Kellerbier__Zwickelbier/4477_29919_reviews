"D: A decent example of the style, but nothing outstanding here. Simple and worth picking up on a hot afternoon."
"Color is Hefeweizen gold with a tinge of orange hue; it's fairly cloudy with a bit of yeast settling on the bottom. Head pours large and pretty thick and leaves lace. Yes, a mass produced beer (from Austria's biggest brewery) that leaves lace and a fair amount of it. Flavor is a bit grainy, dry, and light...not a flattering description, but actually quite good...is complemented very well by a bit of lemon. Carbonation is full...though today is far from warm, Ive finished a few of these quite easily on hot days."
"Zum wohl!!!"
"Pours a cloudy straw gold under a one finger slightly off-white head that fades fairly quickly to film and collar but is too thin and runny to generate any lace. The nose is strong and malty, with a definite wheat tone along with a touch of metallic spice. The mouth is light and quite well carbonated. Mild, pleasant enough taste, slightly sweet at first but primarily dry and bitter, a bit of rust intruding on the espresso in the hops. There's definitely a rough edge here, which both appeals and repells. The aftertaste is spicey bitter, lasting long as it fades to espresso dry. Not bad at all, I could see downing a few pitchers of this some evening."
"A Draught beer sampled at the brewery tap. A golden slightly hazy beer with little head retention of a white head. Initially a pale malty/sherberty taste, following through as the hop character builds to a medium end where both flavors subside together in a slighty sticky end. Not a bad beer, this Zwickelbeer."
