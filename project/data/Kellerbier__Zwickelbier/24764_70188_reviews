"If you want the taste of Germany go for this easy drinker"
"Very unfiltered But not overwhelming."
""
"Overall, the best non European Bavarian Lager I have had."
""

"O -- As the beer warms a little more I realize that it's really reminding me of Spaten Helles from years back and Munich trips.  The breadiness is definitely a yeasty character more than a melanoidin breadiness, but a little of that comes through in the aftertaste.  Overall, this beer is a very good rendition of a Bavarian lager and will stand up to the best.  I hope to be enjoying more of this over the summer months to come!"

"Would absolutely purchase and drink again."
"Although just a basic lager, if I had to choose a simple lager to drink, this is where I'd go."

"On tap at Kaiser Tiger in Chicago.  Maybe there was a tap line issue, because this was not impressive.  Could have passed as a domestic macro."

"this is a really good lager...  my first offering from them. I like it"
""
"Very smooth great tasting beer"
"Overall: Not impressed with this one. I wouldn't seek it out again. But then again I am not crazy about the style to begin with."
""
"I love a good lager, it is not always my style, but a solid well made version can be very rewarding.  This one is exceptional.  It is slightly hazy, and golden.  Effervescent with a white head.  The smell is of bread and hops....slight peppery hop scent, and very clean.  The flavor is crisp, with a little up front sweetness and breads malt.  Wonderful."

"Overall: This is only the third zwickel that I have ever sampled. The first thing that I thought of when I took my first wiff and taste of this beer was a beer that is similiar to an Octoberfest style beer.  If I would have gotten a blind pour and did not know who the brewer was... I would have guessed that Dan Carey brewed this beer. And we all know that Dan Carey is the master when it comes to brewing German lagers. This is definately a high quality german lager and it is on the same level as any of Dan's German lagers that he brews. I give this beer high regards, so get a sample of this brew from Urban Chestnut!  What a gem!"

"Peppery, pleasantly grassy and with a herbal bite, the finish comes quick and dry. Its refreshing taste gives the medium-light lager an effervescent tingle with aftertaste of floral bouquet and pepper."
""
""
"A hint of sulfury pilsner malt character, with slightly spicy and grassy hops. Flavor is crackery, with an interesting citrus tartness at the finish."
""
""
"Great traditional German lager taste."

"I'll try it again in the future and change my rating if it's any different, but suffice to say I'm very disappointed."

"This is a well crafted Zwickel, no off flavors, moderate bitterness, crisp, and most importantly easy drinking. If I lived in Urban Chestnut's distribution area I would buy this by the case often. Such a great beer to have on hand at all times. Thanks again, Mark!"

"I don't usually seek out lagers because they are not usually very complex. In that respect, this beer is better than any commercial lager out there. But it's still approachable to the uninitiated Bud drinker. But it still leaves something to be desired. Definitely a sessionable beer, though."

"This had been judged from the perspective of someone who doesn't really like lagers**"
"Golden hued with great clarity. Minimal head. Aroma is slightly nutty with a bit of pale malt. Mouthfeel is salty and light. Flavor is strong in terms of light malt and somewhat salty and buttery. There's just something underwhelming here. This is not one of my favorites."
""

"beers in this style, and from the the brewery."
"Overall. This is a delicious and drinkable lager."
""
"O - Exellent lager and a style that I have not had before. An easy drinknig local beer with lots of flavor."
""
""
"Drinks so easy, compares favorably with most of the kellerbiers I had in Germany. I would buy this if they actually distributed in SW Mizzou"
""
""
""
"O: Enjoyable beer. A very sessionable beer that goes down easy."
""
"Ehh. Its alright. Herbal character seems to dominate in the aftertaste. Easy to drink though."

"Overall, this is the first of the Euro-lagers with the skunky flavor profile that I actually kind of like. Flavor is complex with light grains and malts melding into a slightly fruity and hoppy finish. I can see this as being an everyday with dinner type of beer."

"Overall: This is very nice all around lager. Every aspect of this beer is well done. I will definitely pick some up next time I'm in St. Louis."

"Not sure where he got it, but my boy Matt hooked me up with a bottle o' this stuff during our last get-together. It pours a cloudy straw topped by a finger of lightly cream-white foam. The nose comprises cracked wheat, light biscuit, and grass. The taste brings in more of the same, but everything comes through dry, listless, and strangely bitter (that isn't to say that the bitterness was necessarily unexpected, but rather it was unexpectedly expressed). The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a dry finish. Overall, an okay beer, but it just didn't sit too well with me (nor with anyone else present)."

"At $8.99 a 4-pk, this is definitely something this ale drinker would gladly pick up from time to time when craving a well-crafted lager. 91/100"
"16oz bottle, pours hazy deep golden color with a fluffy white head, decent retention and lacing on the glass. Aromas are fruity, grassy, noble hop, smells German - nice. Tastes are nice and sharp, crisp, biscuity, grassy, fruity with ample hop bitterness. Body is lighter but creamy and smooth. Finishes so clean and refreshing! This is a nice representation of the style. I'd guess this was brewed in Germany if I tasted it blindly. Great work! I'll need to pick up more from this brewery on my next trip to St. Louis."

"This beer pours a cloudy, light bodied pale pale gold in color with an effervescent and smooth bright white head. The nose is light and pretty straight forward. It features blond German esque malt, slight hop character, and a bit of corn as well. It smells like a fresh helles. The flavors are a little more complex. The pale malt offers a slight sweetness off the bat. The bitterness is mellow and you get plenty of that German helles character with a touch of yeast, pretty spot on for a Zwickel. It drinks light in body with good carbonation. Overall this is pretty good for the style. The freshness is probably this beer's greatest strongpoint and it's hard to find this type of unfiltered lager fresh."

"O - This is a pretty tasty beer. I might have to have more at the bar."

"Served this Zwickel style Bier in a Stein at the brewery. Poured a hazy copper color, produced a excellent creamy white head, great retention and ample lacing. The aroma consists of sweet malted grain, yeast and hops. Moderate body, this traditional style beer had an off the charts mouthfeel- one of the smoothest beers I have ever had- . A base of sweet pale malt, well balanced, crisp and clean- balanced well with hops. Excellent Session beer- I really enjoyed this. Prost!"

"Pours a hazy, copper color. 1/4 inch head of a white color. Good retention and slight lacing. Smells of pale malt, slight sweet malt, hint of yeast, and a hint of hops. Fits the style of a Keller Bier / Zwickel Bier. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of pale malt, hint of yeast, slight sweet malt, and a hint of hop. Overall, good appearance, blend, and body."

"D - this is a light and refreshing beer. I have been drinking a lot of it over the last couple of months and was shocked when I realized I haven't reviewed it yet. Being one of the flagship brews, I think UC chose an effective way to introduce people to the brewery."
"Overall Impression- This wasn't what I remember as the Zwickel style but I'll take it as it is. I looked up common attributes for this style and this beer almost everything fit every category. There are much better brews from U.C. but I enjoyed this greatly. Had no other choice since coming from a Growler."
"Really this beer was quite delicious and a really interesting find. I will be back to the loop district again and I certainly hope this one stays on the menu in the future. Excellent brew!"
"D: I love this beer! My new favorite...too bad it is not going to be around long. Might have to move to St. Louis..."
"Poured a clear golden yellow with a small, delicate, white head. Grassy aroma, pale malts, and light yeast. More of the same in the taste, crisp, light, grassy, crackery pale malts; not much in the way of hops, but there was a little bit of spicy bitterness in the aftertaste. Light bodied and refreshing, and easily drinkable."
