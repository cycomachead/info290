"Pours a nice hazy straw colour with a thin head. The nose presents a sweet honey, with cereal and lemon. Teh taste is similar to the nose with the same attributes coming forward. the mouthfeel is that of hard mineral water. I think it's fairly well balanced. A pretty tasty beverage"

"O - An rather odd style, but very enjoyable."

"O: This is definitely a solid beer. The pithy/mineral/metallic nature of this beer makes it tough to think about drinking more than one, but for one bottle I find it to be really pleasant and different."

"This is Beer 14 from the Rieder advent calendar. Pale yellow, hazy, no head and very little lacing. The aroma is very grassy, and I swear I smell cotton candy. The flavour is really quite sweet, with a cloying wheat finish. Whatever, it's an average wheat-based lager, not bad not great. Too sweet to session."
"A pretty tasty German-style lager. I'm liking these less commonly available styles from that country (and its immediate neighbours, obviously) more and more as of late. Could see sessioning this one in a bierhall-type establishment some day."

"I could smash a few of these with no problems at all, well rounded beer that I'd drink often if available in something other then my 100$ Advent Calendar"

"While the bottled versions always show a few signs of age (that can't be helped), I will still pick this up again if I see it."

"Half finger head with little retention and decent lacing on a clear golden body. Light malt aroma. Not getting much on the nose. Flavor is sour citrus with wheat and malt. This is my first of the genre. I like this one but can't really judge it on its quality amongst others in the genre. Light body and moderate to high carbonation."
"Overall an interesting and pleasing beer. While the style does not seem to be produced or available much, I enjoyed this, and would happily accept another."

"Pours a cloudy orangish amber with large head that dies quick and some lace. Has a dry pils-like grainy malt aroma along with burts of citric hops. REeal light and dry as the pils malt makes it pleasant and balances w/ a touch of yeast so the beer remains smooth w/ a touch of sweetness. There is a touch of minor floral hoppiness in the body as well and it finishes nicely with a crisp backbite. Overall a simple but real good beer to relax with."
"O- The green bitterness is the dominate flavor with the rest of it being very soft and a bit of a metallic quality is off putting."
"O - A beautiful golden brew, unfiltered, hazy, thirst quenching and sweet."
"D: A solid, drinkable beer."
"I have respect for the style (and this beer), but not one I'd want to do very often. I perfer my lagers to be cleaner."
"prepare for expensive session beer. fantastic in its own sense... but one dimensional when too old."
"Fuller bodied than expected and very earthy up front with floral, pine hop bitterness and a prominent zesty spice character. Hints of peppery, coriander and clove followed by bread yeast that adds to the mouthfeel as well as banana and citrus peel. A bit too spice heavy, overpowering the other flavors and an astringent metallic aftertaste hurts drinkabilty. I preferred this much more on draft."
"Brauerei Hofstetten Krammer Kubelbier isn't exactly lackluster, but it's close. Once the hops fade, this stuff will go downhill like a fat kid on greased sled runners. Wolnzacher Hell Naturtrub and St. Georgenbrau Keller Bier are still the best (European) versions of the style to have entered my glass."
"T: The taste echos the aroma, as usual, but it takes a turn - a few sips into it, the taste buds adjust to the sweetness of the malt and the hops become more prominent. They're more spicy than the nose suggests, and along with a solid bitterness, they round it out nicely. It starts with rich malt that's gently caramelish and toasty, and then the hops kick in with a spicy dryness and lots of floral notes. Rather than finishing sweet, it actually ends up being fairly dry and refreshingly bitter."
"2.5/3.5/2.5/4/3"
"The beer is clean and crisp but finishes a little dry. Its interesting and odd. THere is almost a tartness to it in the back of my mouth, no real bitterness to speak of. Highly drinkable, a pretty good keller."
"Simply a good beer, well executed."
"D: Definitely an interesting beer. Very true to the style (kellers at least, I've never had a zwickel), and a beer that has a lot of complexity. Always a fun style for me, a great old fashioned Germanic lagerbier."
"It is a good beer, the best Kellerbier i have had as of yet."
"D: The unfiltered nature of this beer makes it rather tasty. I would definitely want to try this beer again."
"A decent lager - though I expect an imported bottle isn't as true to form as a fresh cask..."
"T- That is a wonderful malt taste. Vegetable/grain tasting it has a nice hop kick once in and a crisp clean aftertaste. This was a small slice of heaven."
"overall a nice keller."
"Drinkability? This is a good beer to sit down with and have a bottle or 2 for sure cuz it *is* an easy drinker. Cool."
"D - A tasty unfiltered brew - I would like to try more beers of the style to get a handle on wether it lives up to my assessment- I have a had a handful and this seems like a pretty good example of the style - a highly drinkable beer"
"Pours a five finger off-white head that fades slowly to a thin layer, leaving a good lace. Slightly hazy amber color. Some malt, some hops nose. Medium carbonation and medium bodied. Flavor is woody and hoppy. Lingering bitter after taste. $4.75 for a 500ml bottle from Tully's Beer & Wine Wells, Me."
"D: Drinkability was fairly enjoyable by the pound but wouldn't venture much after that. Middle of the road overall."
"Drinkability - This is an easy drinker. The ABV was not listed but it did not seem high. The carbonation was just right, nice balance, the beer finished clean, and I didn't feel full afterward. I'd definitely have another (if it were not't so expensive)!"
"An all-around good beer. I'd love to try it fresh, vom fas."
"Decent bier, nothing exceptional, found at Premier. Pours light body although very decent creamy off-white head. Neutral aroma. Mouthfeel is average, taste is OK, drinkable but not very drinkable to the extent of 500 ml.Being unfiltered led to something but not all that much."
"Overall, a nice session beer. A lager with a little bit more oomph. Would probably drink it again if it were less expensive."
"Overall, this was a great impulse purchase. The big bottle is just the right size, and this is a surprising sipper. Nothing you'd chug, but it seems like you should be able to (!). A grown up beer for sure, and not a campfire swiller by any means. Absolutely worth seeking out."
"D- Wow... this may be my new favorite session beer (I know I'm stretching the term ""session"" here). Im my mind, the experience drinking this brew is comparable to what Michael Jackson describes as a ""restorative"". Refereshing, satisfying, big chewy mouthfeel, and totally sessionable. I could drink this all night for days on end!!!"
"This is lovely stuff."
"I served this in a mug. The beer was an orange color with a small white head. It had a sweet honey aroma. Taste was honey, fruity, with a tiny bit of hops. Crisp in the mouth. A refreshing beer, one that I would like to drink again. Nice beer for the summer. Try it."
"Partly cloudy golden with a one finger head that quickly went down to a collar. I did not get much of an aroma. Nor flavor either for that matter. Kind of a sweetish lager. Feel was medium/light bodied with little carbonation. Drinkability was good. A beer that 10 years ago I would have downed six without blinking an eye and been very satisfied. My how the tastes have changed. While still a good beer, there are too many better. Kubelbier just doesn't stand out."
"A good keller beer-zwickel beer is hard to find but I think this Austrian one is pretty solid.Poured a slight hazed light golden with a nice two finger crown atop that never completely settled.Aromas are of honey,toasted grain,and a metallic/iron note, a rather hefty mouthfeel but not overly so,just full and lush.Flavors are alot like the nose,lightly sweet honey with a bit of dough,toasty and crisp in the finish.A solid lager beer with some heft."
"Good light body lager. I like the style. and could have a good time drinking more of this."
"Hazy gold pour, true to style for a Zwickel or Kellerbier (listed as an Austrian Zwickel on the menu). Creamy froth and rings of sticky lace. Nose had a dry bready, papery sweetness. A building hop bitterness was a welcome surprise, as the malt flavor was light, and the body was similarly light and easy drinking. The hop character was a little bit grassy and earthy, not a dominant flavor, just lent a good amount of bitterness. It was a refreshing beer, and I would have had another despite the small pour."
"A hazy lager, which is okay in zwickel/kellerbier. Light orange hue. Not that pretty; not much head retention at all (dirty glass?), but a good earthy minty, hoppy smell. Somewhat minty and peppery hops mix well with earthiness which I'm guessing is contributed by the yeast. A very quaffable, spicy lager with some earthy notes and a bit of a yeast bite. This had more hop character than I expected."
"Whatever...it's very good, and at 5.6%....I think I have found my summer session beer !"
