"Really cool label on the bottle, and really cool beer inside. Very different from the typical hoppy American lager."

"Actually quite good – Voodoo calls it a pilsner but it’s still good – well worth buying again."

"A really amazing beer. The combination of hops and pilsner is great. The beer is not bitter at all and not overly hopped. Not a strong smell to it, but the hop flavors are definitely in there. Very crisp and refreshing with a little hop aftertaste. But again it is not bitter it is more of a floral/spice taste."

"Poured from a brown 22 oz. bottle. Has a cloudy golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of malts, some hops. Taste is well hopped, piney, a bit spicy, some malts, not bad, but over hopped for the style. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a decent beer."

"I'd happily drink it again, but don't know if I'd seek it out."
"An incredible American take on the style."

"Pours a hazy orange with a foamy orange-tan head that settles to a small cap on top of the beer. Foamy streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, citrus zest, and grassy aromas. Taste is much the same with citrus zest and grassy flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer with a nice balance of citrus and grassy qualities."
"Pours into a becker a dull medium golden with a large blooming white head that settles very slowly into a soapy-like mass leaving multiple broken rings of lace behind.Grainy with honey malt notes in the nose,a little grain alcohol is detected.Grainy and bready on the palate with some alcohol-like sweetness a leafy/herbal finsih dryes it out a little more.It seems bigger than what it is ut it's a nice lager beer and it goes well with some kassler and kraut."

""
"Overall – This is really one very enjoyable brew. It has a great flavor profile with a large degree of complexity, but yet is still very easy to drink and appreciate. This is one I am definitely going to seek out more often."
"O: Perhaps a tad too malty for a Pilsner. Some traces of booze can also be found. I used to really love this stuff...so either this beer has changed or I have changed."

"This beer poured a hazy, golden, light-amber color with white foam that was moderate in height and settled to a thin layer but clung to the glass leaving some lacing. The smell was modest but with a sweet malt aroma and light aromatic hops. The taste was sweet up front followed by some aromatic noble hops flavors. Modest bitterness as it is overpower somewhat by the sweet maltiness. The flavor of alcohol could also be discerned. The finish left the taste of hops together with some grainy malt. The body was medium to medium-full with low overall carbonation feel and a sweetness throughout. Hops lingered in the finish. This was not an unpleasant beer, but unlike any German Kellerbier I have had in Germany, and too strong and sweet to be a Pils, though it could fit into the Imperial Pilsner category. I had this beer on my Wants list for over 5 years, and I am glad I finally got to drink a bottle."

"Drinks thin and flat. Border line lame."

"Compared to the traditional lagers of Germany, this upscaled and asserted version tramples the taste buds and never apologizes for it. It's bold for its own sake and dares you to revel in it. It's a seriously taste lager that will find favor with any fan of IPA- just remember this beer has European roots."
""
""
""
""
""
"Very drinkable flavorful lager, easy to enjoy, would go good with food or on its own, would definitely have this again."
""
"An interesting enough beer, but I prefer the lower alcohol, more drinkable versions from the Vaterland."
""
"Pilzilla is very delicious. It's like a pils on steroids and I guess could be called an Imperial Pilsner. I like the smooth character and the lagered taste yet it is much more robust. The head sticks around for a good long time and plenty of lacing clings to the side of the glass. I wish there were more around like it."
"Cheers!"
""
"Right out of the bottle this lovely sticky little burnished gold brew is a delight to see. Decent lacing ok head retention but that might be because the poor little thing had to travel all the way from PA to Chicago before I could taste it. The aromas were a bit subdued compared to the taste, which was FANTASTIC! Cream feel on the tongue but an explosion of flavor! Great work on this one gentlemen! I am sure glad I scored a taste case back in PA!"
"Nebulous peachy gold with only a fine layer of white creaminess on top. Aromas are floral and grassy...hay, melon, oranges, spicy hops, cereal grain sweetness. Softly sweet, doughy flavor upfront. Citrus, honey, and plenty of floral hops quickly balance the malt. Drying, bitter, and crisp which increases the drinkability, despite the heavier-than-usual mouthfeel. Not quite as good as I hoped it would be, but still pretty tasty and interesting. I'd like to try it on tap sometime."
""
""
"Great hoppy beer that breaks out of the IPA category."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Very enjoyable, easy to drink, and a very nice pairing with spicy foods (in my case Malaysian). I have tried a previous year's years and like the fact that it changes a little bit (subtly) each year."
"O: Not quite within style parameters for a pils, but tasty nonetheless. I definitely enjoyed it, and wouldnt hesitate to drink it again should I come across it."
""
""
""
"It's a rather enjoyable beer. For some reason, I didn't expect a ton, but I'll admit to ending up very pleased. If this were available around here, I could see drinking it regularly. Tasty stuff."

"O - Voodoo's PILZILLA is an enjoyable and hoppy lager that is a great beer for hopheads who want a lager. Prosit!"
""
"Pours a slightly cloudy, straw color with one finger of tight white head. The aroma is really nice. I get a very clean lager yeast and bread/biscuit malt flavor with a nice array of hops behind it. The hops stray towards the herbal, spicy spectrum and complement the clean malt aroma. The taste is okay. Both of the elements of the aroma are still present but I just didn't feel like they integrated very well. Still good, just not as integrated as I was hoping for. The mouthfeel was good, like a good lager it was very drinkable. Overall this was an interesting beer, glad I got to try it and I will give it another shot next year when they tweak the recipe again."
""
"Drink- Much better than the moosacher version. Much more alive and vibrant and polished. Sweet, savory and rich. A very good version of the style."
""
""
"O/D - This beer was good, but the hop profile doesn't quite do it for me. Too much herbal and grassy quality. It's definitely a unique beer, easily the hoppiest lager I've ever had."
"Pappy Says So...."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"D: i could CRUSH these. what a great showcase of european hops in an unfitered lager."
"O- Looking at this beer and seeing it in the same style as Surly Hell I'm blown away by this beer and what the bounderies of this style can be."
""
"O: This is a good lager with a complex and interesting taste."
"Sorry this beer just isnt for me. Dont call your beer pilzilla if the beer isn't a pilsner. I detest wheat beers but love pilsners and i have no idea why one would try to combine the two styles. It's either a wheat or a pilsner, not both. This beer had the appearance of a wheat but the body of a pilsner and when you name a beer Pilzilla it should look and taste like a pilsner. The beer is basically a pale wheat. Just call it what it fucking is."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Otherwise, Pilzilla has been an amazingly refreshing change of pace in my everyday beer tasting. I like that the guys at Voodoo Brewery aren't afraid to mess around with styles. I'll have to try more of their stuff."
""
""
"mouthfeel - wonderful body with great carbonation and just beautifully drinkable. well done here."
""
""

"Overall this is a great beer, one of the best I have ever had. Will get it again in the future without a doubt, will probably make the rounds for upcoming christmas gifts too."

"O - Not a bad beer, just a little too sweet for me. Wouldn't mind it again but wouldn't seek it out."
"Overall: Two words...try this beer. It's so delicious."
"O: Have I mentioned this is an easy drinking beer? Flavorful too. I would drink this constantly if it were available. Thanks again, Josh!"
"I like the finish, but the middle of the palate is too sweet for me. It did grow on me a bit as I got through it, but nothing exceptional."
"Falls between a sharp, zippy pilsner and an amber lager in flavor. There's a bready body with some lemony tones. Drinks like a few double pilsners that I've had, on the less dry side of that spectrum. The pour creates a sculptable head and laces the glass like crazy as you drink it down. Heavy on the saaz hops. Alcohol content is very well hidden for the strength. Anyone who likes the pale lager style and wants some deeper, richer, toastier flavors should have a fine time with this beer."
"Overall -- Pretty good! An admittedly narrow field in the US, this was pretty nice. My only significant critique is the high carbonation level: well beyond crisp lager and into the saison/bier brut category."
"The beer pours a hazy yellow color with a white head. The aroma is a great mix of pilsner malt with some peaches and grass from the hops mixed in. The flavor is also very nice. I get a lot of pine and grass notes from the hops, as well as some biscuit and pilsner malt. There is also a nice spice component that really adds to the flavor. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"D/O - Drinkability is decent.I found myself really enjoying the grape, citrus, and apple notes in this beer a bit more than the malts, which are clearly overshadowed. The hops are really a slam on the palate, and while refreshing at first, I found it growing heavy near the end of the glass."
"A very nice surprise. Not sure what to expect, but got more than I hoped for. Good warm weather drinker."
"Too sweet and missing that crispness with a creamy body that doesn't feel right in a pils. Unique hop flavor that i enjoyed, but not sure if i enjoyed the malt component."
"Split out of a 22oz bottle. Was better than average, just expected better. A full flavored pilsner, easy drinking, but more frutiy flavor and thinkness than your normal pilsner. Being a big fan of a crisp crafty pils, this one jsut was above average for me. Defintiley worth a try in a 6 pack or 22oz. bottle."
"O: This beer was super cold when I poured it, which may have influenced the utter lack of any discernible head. Otherwise, I'd have to conclude I got a bad bottle. This thing was flat, waxy, and extremely unlikable. Maybe it's the style, but I can't believe this is what the brewer's intended. An utter disappointment. Will revisit if given the chance to determine what exactly in the hell this was."
"D - Nicely executed... Subtle and powerful both at the same time... Quaffable... Loaded with character... Loaded with flavor... Loaded with complexity... This one is also a bargain to boot... Voodoo is a very underrated appreciated brewery that deserves wider attention... This is very good stuff and highly recommended..."
"O - it's good."
"O: The aroma was quite nice, but the flavor fell short, especially with the bitterness and aspirin notes."
"Never had this style before, so it seemed like a good beer for new beer Sunday. I've also never tried a Voodoo beer. Here we go. I poured the beer from a bomber into a tulip glass. Big, fluffy head, with a hazy, golden body underneath. Has a bit of floral, spicy scent. Hmm. This is an interesting taste, unlike any beer I've ever had. Kind of an earthy, pungent grassy taste. Not sure what kind of hops bring that to the table. There's a slightly bitter aftertaste. The mouthfeel is standard. Not too thick, slightly carbonated. This is pretty tasty, but probably not my favorite type of beer. I might have one every now and then. I'd like to try more of Voodoo's beers."
"my first beer of this rare style, glad I tried it."
"Not a pilsner for sure, so if you are looking for that in this beer, forget it. Maybe it fits the Zwickel category better but it's not a keller or classic pils if you ask me. A decent beer, but not something I would ever seek out. I think all of our awesome other PA pils kills my taste buds for this beer. Shame, because I love the dark Voodoo beers."
"Poured a light yellow/honey color, mildly hazy but nothing to detract from. Fluffy white head. Aroma is light, very slightly bready, sweet, and a peculiar lemon drop bouquet. A very hoppy beer. Lots of grass, lemon peel, touch of earthy bitterness in the finish. An effervescent, light, and easy drinking beer. Quite delicious."
"Overall, its really good. Wish they had bottle dates so I could buy it more consistently."
"Drinkability is good. Easy to drink, with no noticeable alcohol, and quite tasty."
"This brew pours out as a golden yellow color with a fluffy white head on it. The lacing isn't too bad. The smell is a lot like a pilsner but its also has a nice hop aroma too. The taste is hoppy enough to mask the grassy flavor. The mouthfeel is pretty carbonated and had a light body. Overall not a bad beer at all, I could drink this one again."
"O - I've always liked this beer, it's dialed in for the real hop heads in the crowd and delivers the goods in a very aggressive manner for a Pils. Great job Voodoo! Fist pump!"
"D/O - Drinkability is great, and overall, this is a rich and tasty frankenstein of a pils! Lovin' it!"
"Beer is thin and wet up front but finishes rather dry with an odd bitterness to it. It is almost sandy on the finish, gritty. Are these from the hops? It is not an unenjoyable beer, it is about what you'd expect from a keller but there is something about that that makes it not measure up in my mind. I think the finish was just too harsh for my tastes. I'd have ti again on draft, out of the bottle probably too. It was fine."
"This was a great beer of a style I really need to try again. Well-done Voodoo."
"im not really a huge fan of pilsners or lagers in general, but i definatly have respect for this one. has a very nice hoppy bite too it. definatly try this if you can find it. just as good if not better than pilsner urquell IMHO."
"A very hazy beer for a pils. nice gold/orangey color with one finger of head that fades quickly. lots of bready and lager yeast smells backed up by a good hop profile. mild sweetness from pils malt upfront, definitely taste the variety of hops used and finishes with some nice spiciness. Feels a little thin for what I was expecting. An enjoyable drink. Not a classic Pilsner but they are trying to be. enjoy"
"O: Really liked this one, has a nice mouthfeel and tasted very fresh. My first sampling of this style, and it came off kind of like a hoppy pilsner, sort of similar to DFH My Antonia, but certainly not as hoppy."
"Pours a slightly murky gold. Visible carbonation and a medium sized, persistent head. Smell is somewhat unique. Very floral, sweet and mellow. Taste is immediately bitter hops. Herbal hop finish. A very subtle cakey sweetness rounds it out although it's really just a background note to the hops. Still it adds a really nice unique note to this beer that I really like. Full bodied and well carbonated. Very easily drinkable. I really love a good pils (or keller bier). And I've enjoyed some other American takes on some of these German styles (like Victory's Prima Pils). This is perhaps the best example of this- really great stuffl."
"Overall this is a great enjoyable beer and one to have again some day for sure! My first for this style and this is a winner right here! Very tolerable alcohol level and hardly noticeable, before I knew how much I was enjoying it, I wanted more and it was all gone! She went fast. Delicious!"
"The CPJ"
"I was disappointed with this beer because it lacked many of the classic qualities of a czech pisener. Too much biscuit malt and hops ruined the style. A royal smack in the face to the true czech pilsner style."
"D - Very solid and much better on tap versus the bottle I reviewed some time ago. On tap is definitely the way to go with pilsners. Pilzilla is nice and hoppy!"
"D - As I mentioned, I thought the flavors were really well balanced...I was expecting pilsner flavors here...which I got...with a little more hops added...this one was easy to drink"
"A - 3.75 S -3.75 M -4 T- 4 O-4"
"Pours an electic hazy yellow with a slight off white head which gives way to some spotty lacing. The aroma is of grassy notes with some lemon and citrus and a touch of breadiness. The taste is of grass and floral hops with a slight hint of sweetness to it. The mouthfeel is moderately carbonated. Drinkability is good a nice balance and a some and easy drink. The taste has enough complexity to keep you interested."
"d- really nice, this beer goes down very easily and is enjoyable. it's my first keller/zwickel bier - very tasty though."
"This is a medium bodied brew with a modest amount of carbonation. It is well balanced and enjoyable to drink. It finishes quite crisp with the hops lasting inside the mouth in both flavor and bitterness. I for one am not familiar with other examples of the Keller Bier / Zwickel Bier style but I approached this as if it was going to be a pilsner and I was pleasantly surprised. It shares some similarities to a pilsner only it is much more hearty in all aspects. It has been too long since I last had this brew, I would certainly have it again."
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied with carbonation being on the higher side. Drinkability was pretty decent, I liked the fruity and bitter hoppiness it brought. Pretty nice beer overall and went down pretty easy this evening."
"D: This is a great lager to drink. A little more hop character than expected but it certainly does not take away from the beer. I would definitely enjoy this again and again."
"D - An interesting take on the style. A better hop/malt balance would enhance this one quite a bit. A bit too bitter for what would otherwise be a great summer beer. I'm enjoying, but I think one bottle is enough in a sitting and time to try something else."
"Very drinkable, great flavor just enough hop bitterness and aroma with great pilsner malt flavors."
"D= Not that strong pretty decent taste would try again and wouldn't mind having a couple of these."
"Murky dark yellow in color with a strong foamy light head. Lots of thick sticky lacings. The light malt aroma is trumped by the dominant hop aromas - lemon and grass. There's a hint of yeast aroma that sneaks through after a few sips. Medium to full bodied and very creamy. Malty flavor in the beginning that leads to lemon citrus hop flavors, a hint of yeast and pine hop finish. A very unique lager that went down very smoothly and easily. Glad I bought more than one."
"Pours a cloudy slightly-darkened yellow that is very hazy. A nice, lofty white head forms and sits for quite some time. Nice and thick with good, sticky lace on the way down. The nose brings some light citrus notes along with light, sweet grain. The taste brings some Noble hops with a bit of flowers in addition to some light fruit, grain, and dough. Mouthfeel is nice and thin with good carbonation. This is a really good American rendition on an underutilized style."
"5.0 D: Overall this is one hell of a beer. There isn't a damn thing wrong with it and so much right. Goes down super easy as well. This is only my second Voodoo beer (BBVD is one of my favorite beers, period) and I have no idea why it took so long to get to this second beer. If I'm not stupid, I need to try to whole lineup ASAP."
"Pilzilla Lager is one of the most flavorful and hoppy lagers I have consumed. The 9 varieties of German, Czech and Polish hops should say it all - Nice job Voodoo."
"I poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a SA perfect pint glass. The brew is light gold in color with a slight white head. Zesty lemon, and wet hay on the nose. Thfe flavor is light, grassy, and a decent amount of bitterness. The finish lingers for a bit. Nice light body and well carbonated, a smooth, easy drinker. I liked it, IMO it taste like and Imperial pilsner."
"Bottle. Pours a slightly hazed golden color with a fluffy white head that coasters on top. Good lace already. Smells clean and crisp with that very distinct Czech style aroma. Some hops as well. The taste is clean and crisp as well with a slightly sweet start with hops that then kick in. Pine type bitterness that isn't too harsh. Pretty decent for a lager. Light/medium mouthfeel"
"Overall, a very interesting take on the style. Decent, but the taste has a bit of an odd flavor to it. Not as clean as I would like it to be. Decent drinkability."
"D - I'm not sure how fresh this bottle was, but it was quite good. Would definitely have this one again. Very easy to drink, with the perfect levels of carbonation and bitterness."
"Cheers..."
"D: This is like a German Style IPA... but lagered. All in all very enjoyable."
"Good but not great overall. I expected more. Maybe it's not too fresh."
"D-well balanced and hopped up pilzner, it has a strong yeast presence with great hop profile and a soft creamy feel. well done beer."
"Long live American Craft Brewers! Raw, flavorful and a little complex, yet very drinkable. This is proof that more brewers need to bring a hoppy lager to the table."
"D: I like it! I wish we had this one here."
"Tasted from 12oz bottle obtained in a trade. Pours cloudy bright orange with a smallish white head that quickly recedes to minimal lace. Nose of light hops with some citrus, yeast and cereal malt. There is more hops citrus and bitterness than I had expected along with the same cereal/bread malt and some yeastiness as well. The body is fairly light with average carbonation and a medium finish that features citrus bitterness. The alcohol is a little out of balance, but this beer is still very drinkable."
"D - I am a bit let down. It sounder better than it was."
"This is very drinkable and refreshing. Not sure why it took me so long to try this one, but I will keep a lot of these stocked!"
"Drinkability: An odd beer but one I found rather enjoyable."
"G311 sent me a bottle of this. Thanks, Vince! This smells and tastes nicer than. Lightly soapy on the nose, but still intensely German hop character. Not really a deep pilsner malt nose, but with some dough. Opening with plenty of hop flavor and a pleasant bitterness, this is a bastardized pilsner that's actually rather enjoyable. A lot drier than the 12oz bottle I last had as well.The mouthfeel is also great, I'm really digging this. I'm upping the M score by 0.5"
"Great looking webbed lacing. Finishes bitter and clean. Very nice."
"This is just an all-around fantastically drinkable beer. If I had it available to me it would be my year-round session beer for sure even though the ABV is a bit higher than I would like for that purpose. Highly recommended."
"EDIT: The pepper subsided after a bit, leaving a decent bready character. Decent, but not great enough to bump the overall taste up substantially (moved from 2.0 to 2.5)."
"Pours a hazy, pale orange color with a large white head that had excellant retention. Patches of merange type lacing. Quite a bit of European hops in the aroma. It smells spicy, floral, and earthy. A little cracker-like malt as well. The hops give more of a bitter quality than adding much of a flavor component. Dry qualities from the malt with some lemon and pepper in the finish. It has good flavor, just wish a little more hop flavor from the 50 IBUs. With the 7% ABV, alcohol is well masked and barely detectable. The body is light and crisp. Nice carbonation. Good lager qualities. A different take on an European lager that is very good. Would definately like to try this again."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, spritzy, crisp, and dry."
"Morey's Bottom Line: Well....I'm an ale guy. That being said, this is a well crafted lager that I could see myself drinking from time to time (especially in the warmer months). The only down side is the price tag."
"D - Defiantly better than my last review of tire bite. This has renewed my faith from the hate from BMC on my T-buds that pilsner's are a watery bitter mess."
"Pours a golden pale orange color with tons of pinpoint sized active bubbles which leave a big head that lasts pretty long. Smell is of earthy, freshly dried grains, hay, grass, faint roasted nuts with touches of citrusy lemon and earthy hops. Taste follows scent, very nice fresh taste to this beer, definitely not bold or clean, just good. Medium bodied, slightly creamy, despite all of the crazy little bubbles. A nice beer, good alternative for BMC drinkers and those likeing a cleaner, fresher tasting brew as well as those who appreciate a finely crafted beer."
"pour is nearly clear but with a tinge of cloudiness. color is close to yellow but maybe a little orange in there. puffy head recedes quickly but leaves a happy trail down the glass. zesty grassy aroma and taste. finish is not as clean as i would expect, and it comes across a little hot. although the abv is only 6.7%, i might put this in the imperial pilsner category. could use a little more carbonation."
"D: Damn! One of the best lagers I've ever had. This and the 4 Seasons rocked me!"
"*Trader's Note: Many thanks to msulinski for hooking me up with this fine elixir!"
"Overall I really didn't care for this at all. Maybe I'll give it another chance in the future and update this review if my impressions change."
"again, Voodoo offers another interesting take on a style. i appreciate the uniqueness and look forward to many good things coming out of this somewhat local brewery in the future."
"Mouthfeel is light bodied with medium carbonation, a bit of a disappointment."
"Drinkability: Light-Medium body, no hint of the 7% ABV. Not overly spicy either. Certainly an interesting brew worth trying each year as the recipe is always changing."
"d: By far the best big pils I've tried, though I haven't tried many. It manages to maintain its pilsner roots while becoming something bigger and all together different."
"Really appreciating this beer."
"D: Decent drinkability with fairly good regards here but wouldn't go to far out of my way for this one. Dry, grassy but lacks crispness and the spicy saaz hops which get muddled in with the other 8 varieties. Overall this beer is probably worth checking out but doesn't do much for defining the style. Much more suited for 6 packs and sharing with friends then a single bomber. Not a bad beer to kick back with for a summer quencher that drinks more like a hoppy wheat in my opinion."
"Pours a very nice semi-cloudy golden straw color with fantastic head and lacing. Very nice scent, sweet and malty without being cloying, with a nice butterscotch/bubble-gum aroma and slight spice in the nose. Fantastic taste; smooth and sweet with a great near-wheat semi-butterscotch/bubble-gum flavor; tiny bit of spice and a nice pelt of hops at the end to make it wonderfully balanced. Extremely smooth. A wonderful beer!"
"A nice beer to toast the impending end of summer."
"Perhaps I was thrown by the name and expecting more, but what I find is a hoppy lager that clocks in at around 70 IBUs and 7% abv without much pedigree. It's OK, but refinement and focus are needed."
"Na Zdravje!"
"I am not sure of the age of this, but I got it in November of 2008, but it is still drinking quite nicely; the hop character is still quite vibrant, and there is a nice malt character that is just noticeable so that this beer achieves some balance. I wouldn't be surprised if this beer is close to peaking (though I wouldn't necessarily guess that a Pils type beer should be drink any way except as fresh as possible). This is a nice beer that is quite enjoyable."
"Too big for a keller. Too confused for an imperial pils. Needs a little tinkering but not without hope."
"Medium body with a good amount of carbonation. Pretty easy to drink. Overall, not bad."
"On tap a Capone's, this one comes out with an ample white head lacing ok and a ton of carbonation. Color is on the yellow orange side. When you bring this to the nose you will smell hops and a lot. Many different hop smells from grapefruit to grassy pine. The taste is hoppy at first and then seems to calm down some, had a hard time tasting the grains. This is a hopped up Pils to say the least. Good mouth feel except for the slight over carbonation. I enjoyed this beer but would limit myself to one at a time. Later"
"Excellently drinkable with a manageable abv. Perfect for this time of year. The flavors really do not get old and offer refreshing bursts of flavor with every sip."
"I finally review this great brew after a few conversations with the brewer. A big pil with grassy, grainy notes. So floral smell crisp clean easy too drink with the taste of corn. About an inch of lace and foam clings to the side of the glass. Absolutely a favorite."
"This is a great brew I wish I had a pizza to go along with it but I'll settle for a nice sunny day instead. It is incredibly drinkable; I already wish I had another. Voodoo has done it again another fine beer in my book"
"hazy straw color w a nice white head that held well and left good lace. if no one told me, i wouldn't have guessed keller beer, but i can definitely see it. nose and taste were very well balanced mix of grassy, herbal hops and a sweet(ish) bready maltiness. i swear i was even getting something like grass flavored bubblegum. nice, creamy medium body with a long finish. supremely drinkable and a lovely early summer evening beer."
"Bottle Pours a cloudy straw color with a big creamy white head. The head lasts well and laces nicely. Has a nice aroma of grain, earthy, bread, and some floral. Has a high carbonation. The flavor is sweet but kind of grainy. Not bad but a touch differnt. Has a dry texture. A light medium body. The finish is good and the aftertaste lingers well. This is a fairly good beer."
"Obtained in trade with Scott Holland. Many thanks."
"D- As i said I ordered more after having it for the first time. I always passed this up when browsing the beer store isles but that's not the case no more, Pilzilla is officially on my radar, this truely exceeded my expectations."
"Overall an interesting and tasty go forward unfiltered lager."
"Voodoo for me has been a hit or miss brewery, with a couple of excellent beers & a couple of swings & missed like Dave Kingman at a Charlie Hough knuckler. This is one of the latter, unfortunately. Too many moving parts to this one that aren't just average, but actively disagreeable."
"Perfect carbonation, medium body and the alcohol so well masked in every aspect. A truly remarkable beer that I would drink weekly if only it was available. A great offering from Voodoo, can't wait to try some of their others. And yet another big thanks to Aaron, for making this possible...Cheers!"
"Drinkability: a nice beer that was quite quaffable. Big flavor will keep you interested for a while."
" prosit!"
"Drinkability: Cut down a tad on the carbonation and this brew would be outstanding; as it is, it is not too shabby, at all"
"This beer pours a very light and clear amber with a 1 fingered head, high carbonation and nice lacing. The smell is nice of malt and piney hops. The flavor is nicely balanced and for a hop head like myself the hop presence is very nice :) Big pine hop after taste balance with a really nice malt base. The mouthfeel is nice, the carbonationk level seems a little high. The only thing that holds this beer back on drinkablility is the carbonation, overall a good brew, worth a try!"
"Recommended..."
"22 ounce bottle received in a trade with JohnTravolta21, thanks for this interesting brew Sara, drank yesterday afternoon, poured into a slender mug, color is a cloudy golden yellow and has lots of light brown flakes in it that look like somebody sprinkled cinnamon in my beer, huge two inch soapy white head, good retention, and lacing, aroma consists of European hops that are pretty floral, lemon juice, lots of yeast that is typical of a lager, toasted bread, and earthiness, flavor starts of dry with hops that have a little citrus zestiness to them, middle is bready malt and a little sweetness, finish is very bitter with hops and yeast, both floral and citrusy later on when it warms and some of the dry bitterness mellows a bit, bitter beer lovers will enjoy this one, dry, bitter, and toasty mouthfeel, medium bodied, lots of carbonation, taste lingers a long time, could drink a lot of this stuff, alcohol is hidden very well, goes down easy and is smooth regardless of how dry it is, first beer from Voodoo and my first Keller Bier, both were good introductions, not much to go off on the style but it is similar to imperial pilsners I have in the passed along with heavily hopped lagers, would drink this again, look forward to seeing when they stop adding a different hop variety and bump up the alcohol content because they do both every single year this stuff is released, after awhile it is going to be a beast of a beer in both strength and bitterness, recommended"
"D - Drinkability is good. The Pilzilla doesn't really have any faults that can easily be pointed out. All categories come together to make a solid beer in my opinion. I could stick with this beer for a session and be totally content. Glad I got the chance to try it out."
"Pilzilla is excellent beer. This is my first beer from Voodoo and I'm extremely impressed. I'm anxious to try out more of their releases. This is also my first experience with the style, so I don't really have much to go on for comparison. But, I don't have any big complaints about this one. It's all-around very, very impressive. Highly recommended."
"Notes: Such a treat to try this beer from true artisans, Matt and co. at Voodoo."
"Drinkability is good - not sure if I could put this down as a session beer."
"Pours a pale yellow with a huge chunky white head that leaves amazing lacing and completely covers the top for most of the tasting. The smell is crisp and clean with a hop bitterness, bready and doughy malt and a spice and lemon that almost hints of mint. The taste is very spicy upfront with a biscuit malt and a nice hop bitterness. This is my first time with this style and I love it. Obscure, German beers tend to be my favorite. The mint hits the back of the throat after a nice dry finish. The mouthfeel is creamy and thick. There is a lot of body to this beer. Voodoo makes some good beer and I think this is now my favorite from them. I could drink this one all night long and I will be looking for it on tap while I am out."
"I poured a 22oz bottle into my Tripel Karmeliet tulip. This beer pours a crystal clear gold with a huge rocky white head. The aroma of this beer is pretty straight up noble hops. There is a great grassy aroma with just a bit of lemon zest. The flavor is much the same. Grass, lemon zest, and just a bit sulfur. Straight forward, not a lot of complexity but masterfully blended. Everything that goes into it fits perfectly together. The mouthfeel is light and crisp. I wish the carbonation was just a bit more, but that's really just a little complaint. This is a masterful lager. I would love to have access to this on a daily basis. Great beer."
"D: This is really interesting and different beer, though I would say it's not very well balanced, just an explosion of flavors. I wouldn't be able to drink too many of them at a time either. Other than that it's definitely interesting, like I said, there aren't too many pilsners as hoppy as this. I really liked this beer and would recommend trying it."
"Besides a fairly fetching name, it has a wealth of pilsener flavor that pushes a bit and impresses nicely for the effort. Yet you never lose track of its identity. The notably crisp nature and self-cleaning utility make it a joy and a breeze to drink. It's fun, it's brassy, and it's a done-deal definite do-over."
"There's an interesting combo of pils flavors - staying on the hoppy side of things - An interesting brew, for sure - and a very nice one, at that!"
"Opened the bomber and foam started erupting gently out of the bottle. Poured a hazy golden yellow. Smelled grassy and of lemon with a hint of pine. The taste was awesome. It was peppery and refreshing with a mildly bitter aftertaste. The way the beer opened I thought the beer was going to be overly carbonated, it wasn't at all. This is an excellent beer that I will be enjoying again and again."
"Once splashed on my tongue, a lot of alcohol and some grains are immediately noticeable and overpowering enough to provide a very off taste that corroborates well with the smell, but poorly on the taste buds. Really bitter and tart, and not really for me."
"D: Really different beer. Totally enjoyable. Glad I was able to try this."
"Drinkability: It was truly a unique beer experience. How could it not with this beer's high level of grassy hops? I enjoyed Voodoo's interpretation of the Keller Bier style. Would I ever buy it again? I would if I was even in the mood for some grassy hops. If you want to try an Americanized hopped up Keller Bier, then give Pilzilla a whirl."
"7/3/7/3/14/3.4"
"More mega-props out to BA RblWthACoz for another winner."
"Pours a slightly hazy deep yellow color with a huge creamy frothy white head and lots of sticking, a really great looking beer. Crystal clean, and quality, pale malt in the nose with a good helping of bitter, peppery and slightly lemon zesty hops. Strong presence leading up to the tongue, assertive and bright with carbonation, leafy hops, melon fruit notes mid palate, peppery hops and a clean malt backbone through out. Definitely bigger in body than i had expected but it really needs that boldness, a flat or watery body would not do good compliments to this beer. Damn good overall. Pilsner fans... meet Goliath."
"Above average drinkable beer."
"I picked up a bomber for $5.99 at Champane's in Warren. The beer was pale yellow, hazy, with a thick rocky foam. The smell was all hops, very pilsner-esque. A little grass or musk mixed in, similar to Urquell. The taste was mostly slightly bitter hops, but with malt sweetness to counterbalance. There was a slightly biting after-taste, like from pepper. The mouthfeel was on the thick side for a pils, and the flavor kept me going at it until the bomber was gone."
"drinkability is definitely harmed by the high carbonation, but gets better once it's been given a little time to settle. the bitterness also feels like a bit much. by half way through the glass the carbonation has settled a little and i'm growing a little numb to the bitterness, so it gets better. rough around the edges up front, but mellows out a little."
"Pours a clear light golden colour, touch of amber, huge thick soapy white head forms, lots of little bubbles coming up to the top, big pillowy head and lots of lacing, good retention. Smell is nice, very malty, bread and honey, wheat, caramel, citrus hops, some floral, earthy, grassy, sharp lemony sour note. Taste is nice and malty, caramel and bread, a bit sugary, heavy grassy and herbal note, citrus, oranges, floral, really neat hoppiness, very assertive grassy bitterness, nicely balanced still, the malts are really well done. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied with high carbonation, very drinkable pils, although the carbonation is a touch rough. Just the right amount of bitterness, sessionable stuff. Thanks Jason!"
"D - Not overtly complicated, but easy and nice. I would do this for a session EASY."
"Pours cloudly pale yellow with pretty thick white bubly head. Smell is hoppy, a bit floral and bready. Alcohol is noticable. Taste - lots of hops, hint of citrus, some nice bitterness is there as well. Very complex, alcohol is also noticable, but is inoffencive. Smooth and somewhat thick, good carbonation. It is drinkable, but i found it pretty filling, so I'd do no more than couple of those at the time. And start over next day:) It is delicious brew. Definately recommended!"
"Pours a hazy golden pale yellow color, nice carbonation, huge two-finger foamy white head, which leaves tons of foamy sticky lacing behind. The nose is malty, with tons of hops, very slight citrus, with some spice. The taste is slightly malty, hoppy, bitter, very slight citrus, and spicy. Medium body. Drinkable, this is a very nice brew, different, recommended."
"PS: I appreciate the warning about the carbonation, Scott - no spills. And thanks again for the chance to try this one."
"Notes: I can't help but rate this as a ""good"" brew... it's nothing super standout, but it's definitely not gross. For a big lager, this hits the spot. After hearing so much about Voodoo, I'm glad I was able to go to the beer store and grab this."
"D- This is a very nice beer. Not a style that I am all to familar with-but I would nescribe this as a more complex pilsner. This would make a great summer beer."
"I'd have no objection to drinking this beer again. Good session beer that would probably also be a great candidate for a hoppy pils fan with a kegerator."
"M/D: Mouthfeel was good, it was really smooth and slid down the palate. However, the taste just killed the drinkability component for me."
"a menagerie of floral hops in the aroma..flavor is a cascading tour of European hop fields..in the background is a soft bready malt presence. The oily hop bitterness here is impressive even for a modern-day pils, but it doesn't distract from the drinkability of this one bit. A big, agressive pils for sure, but i like the direction this brew is headed..i've had enough ""extreme"" stouts and ipa's... more imperial browns, imperial pils, imperial macros!! ok..i may have gone a bit too far.. that being said, this is a damn fine creation from Voodoo Brewing.."
"Overall I was thoroughly impressed with this one for sure. It was much more balanced then I thought it was going to be and that was awesome. Smooth and rich, this was a very nice pale ale, or at least I think that's what it is, it kind of straddled styles more or less. Still though very solid and I could see myself in this one again."
"Cloudy yellow with a big, pillowy white head. Great head retention with lots of chunky lace. Crackery malt aroma, maybe a bit of toasted bread, with lots of hop character (lemony, grassy, spicy, just a hint of sulfur). Really fragrant and smells great. Strong bitterness that wasn't harsh, but was also reigned in by some sweetness mid-palate. Notes of bread and crackers were light compared to the intense hop flavour, lots of lemon and freshly cut grass, a bit spicier towards the end. Hoppy bitterness lingered. The ample carbonation gave it a fullness of body that wouldn't have been there otherwise, though the beer itself was not thin by any means. The texture remained creamy throughout. This stuff tastes great and was a pleasure to drink. I'm glad it came in a bomber, because 12oz would have left me wanting more."
"Matt makes some very unique beers and this is no exception. Cheers to Voodoo!"
"Poursa hazy yellow color with a big, yeasty white head. In the aroma, balanced European hops and a sweet maltiness. In the taste, nice big European hops, saaz, with a balanced maltiness. A bitter and lighter mouthfeel, with a semi dry, hoppy, yet clean aftertaste. A pils with big hops, a nice sweet malt and a decent balance."
"M/D - Medium bodied and very well carbonated and crisp."
"This was a smooth, clean, refreshing and rather easy-drinking brew. If you are a fan of hoppy or imperial pilsners, you will likely enjoy this beer as well."
"D: Not bad if you like lots o hops in your pils. That being said I am sort of tired of pouring these fizzy nightmares."
"About as drinkable as it gets if you ask me, I could go for a keg of this stuff, it's damn tasty stuff. A permanent add to my wants list."
"It reminds me a lot of Small Craft Warning Uber Pils by Clipper City in Baltimore and Old Domininion's Spring Brew. For those hop head ale drinkers who don't like most lagers, give this one a try. It may suprise you..."
"Notes: Got this one from Darkerthebetter as an extra - thanks a ton! Very interesting stuff here, unique and well-crafted. It's good to see American breweries experimenting with these obscure styles."
"This is one hoppy ass lager and I love it. This is hoppy in the realm of imperial pilsners. It's also a damn good beer. A must try."
"This is like taking Pilsner Urquell and turning the volume up to 11. Get this beer if you love a good pilsner."
"Taste is pretty bitter, lots of hop flavor--like a big pils on steroids. The mouthfeel was light, dry and thin but the carbonation was too much. If they had cut down the carbonation by about a third I think this would have been amazing. Drinkability is limited by the huge hop character and the way over the top carbonation. Very good and if you happen to see it, definately pick it up."
"Recommended."
"T: Despite ridiculous carbonation, I let this sit for a while and mouthfeel is remarkably smooth. Medium bodied with high carbonation, but very pleasant. Starts off slightly bitter but by finish is surprisingly mildly sweet. Very earthy, citrus lemon, pepper, herb, floral taste in body. Great malt backbone to this. Overall, exceptionally drinkable and am happy I know have easy access to Voodoo beers."
"This Voodoo Company brew is probably best thought of as a double pilsner, despite what the brewery claims. Having said that, they do refer to it as a pilsner on their website and they obviously chose the name for a reason. In any case, PILZILLA is outstanding beer that would, no doubt, cause the same panicked stampede among Bud drinkers as Godzilla caused in Tokyo."
"I could drink this beer all night except for two things: It would take forever to wait for the foam to go away, and it is 8 bucks a bottle."
"My second Keller/Zwickel beer, and it's a good one. Very easy drinking, somewhat complex, and unique as far as lagers go. My only complaint would be the price, which at $8 is a bit high for a good, nearly sessionable beer. Worth seeking a bottle out."
"I love this beer. This is a pilsner that ale-obsessed hopheads will love as much as pilsner fans. I had it in a 22 oz bottle. It pours a beautiful hazy golden with a light, lacy head. It has that delicious, crisp lagery aroma, but it has a surprisingly meaty mouthfeel and an unexpected hop bite - not a lot of hop aroma, but a nice bitterness on the back end. It's crisp, with a good, light, refreshing taste of grain, which will please the pilsner fan, but a sneaky tingle on the back edges of the tongue that will please the hophead. Unexpected and delicious all around. I look forward to trying this beer again (and seeing of I can come even close to replicating it in my home brew tanks)."
"Simple, yet effective. Get this, and your vitamins!"
"Holy head, Batman. Pours a slightly hazed gold with a massive creme head. Nose is clean and mild. Flavor is heavier on dough than anything with a decent earthy edge and too noticeable a sweet tone on the start. Feel is typical. It is easy to drink and certainly over-carbonated. A bit more hoppy than I would expect, but it's nice enough."
"Drinkability is good. An interesting beer that reminds me a bit of a strong Pilsner. I like it, and will enjoy this bomber a lot. My only complaint is that I paid way too much money for this bottle. But with that said, will someone else buy me another?"
"Pours a foggy bronze with a huge fluffy two finger white head that never seems to die down. Stickiness is a thick layer that stays forever. Lots of bubbles racing to the top of the glass. Smell is a spicey yeast aroma with a nice blend of noble hops. Pepper and lemongrass tickle the nose as well. Some buttery biscuit scents make an appearance too. Very complex smell, fresh and clean. Floral hops up front with an underlying yeast flavor. A white bread like taste as well as some citric hop flow over the tongue. A honey sweetness emerges as well as a bit of malt which helps balance this monster quite well. Aftertaste is spicey noble hops, very enjoyable. Medium bodied mouthfeel with a strong carbonation that leaves a dry feeling. I can't say I've ever had a beer like this before. I had New Glarus' Yokel, but Pilzilla has way more flavor. Definitely seek this one out."
"Pours a very light yellow and slightly watery looking at first, but then some of the sediment falls in and makes it look cool and exciting. Patchy white head, not very Godzilla-like, but a lot like a pils. Odor is soft, of light malfs and lightly spiced hops. Some sweetness on the nose as well, but not detectable alcohol. ooh, but the taste is great. I was expecting a massive, overhopped high alcohol mess of a lager, one of those ""American's are awesome because they can make beer styles CRAZY"" type of beers. But this is not really that at all. Here, you have a fantastically crafted and tremendously tasty spin on your classic European Pils. Sure, is slightly hoppier and slightly higher in alcohol than your average pilsner, but that's what it claims to be. What it's not is over the top, and i like it. Nicely spiced malt backbone melds supremely well with the hops. Creamy quality and somewhat lemony. Hops linger, but not harshly. Medium bodied. Very drinkable and and extremely pleasant surprize."
"Very refreshing in the mouth with an aftertaste of just a bit of white pepper to go with the citrus peel hop."
"Drinkability: Easily would have enjoyed a second 22 oz. Easily would have enjoyed buying a six pack. Easily would have enjoyed paying less, but certainly worth it. (5.0)"
"Appears an unfiltered golden haze beautiful thick white head chunk even lacing with each sip. Aromatics contain lucious layers of grassy hop bursts mild pine with upfront citrus hops mild skunk but not in an off way. Pale biscuit soft malt tones bring mild sweetness to the party but the hops are shining, a touch of perfume mild honey flow. Flavor mild sweetness flows nicely with a touch honey, sturdy hop bitterness fresh cut grass with citrus peel accents such a well structured pils bigger than most I welcome the kellerbier style this beer brings adding both flavor and texture. Mouthfeel carbonation is adequate flows nicely hop crispness leaves a dryness on the palate, slightly sticky with hops oils. Drinkability by the bomber for sure something that I would love to imbibe on in number, and I plan to."
"Overall, a great pilsner-type beer; in fact, the label calls it a ""bastardizded German, Czech, Polish Pils."" Highly recommended."
"D - Near perfection. The 6.7%abv not noticeable at all. I would call this beer dangerous as I could easily finish this bomber and reach for another. Highly recommend beer and another winner from Voodoo."
