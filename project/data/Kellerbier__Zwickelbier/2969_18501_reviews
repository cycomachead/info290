"overall: Why is this brew so good. For some reason this is a great beer and I love it but it doesn't taste like much and it really isn't very filling. Its just a generally good beer. And the wife loves it."
"O - Although very light and mainly dominated by yeasty and citrusy flavours (something I'm not normally a huge fan of), something about this beer was really enjoyable. It has such a crisp, summery feel to it that it feels like you can drink it anytime. My .5L BÃ¼gelflasche was purchased at a CenterParcs in Germany, and for a bit under 2 euros, I'd say it's quite a steal."
"Remarks: Did not score A, T, S, M at that time; disregard those scores"

"I was disappointed in this beer. Today I went to the speciality beer shop in Berlin, and i decided to buy 8 or so beers with the only criteria that each cost more than e2.00/ltr (or e1.00 for a standard 1/2l bottle). This approach probably weeds out 80-90% of the multitude of offerings. So tonight I've had a cracking couple of beers. But I hate to say it, this one is doing very little for me indeed, despite it's price."

"Interesting and easy to drink beer. I'm not crazy about it but I would try it again."

"Probably not something I'd buy again, but not bad at all and totally drinkable."
"Taste is a light and has a raw malt smell, some straw and floury notes. The beer has yeast in it, and that comes through in the taste. A fleshy taste."
"Light but really tasty and very easy to drink."
"I believe that it's ""a genuine fresh product," as the label claims, and it's certainly interesting, but I'm just kind of underwhelmed by this one."
"The softness of the flavour and feel make it reasonably drinkable, but not incredibly so. It's not something for all occasions, either. For watching a EuroCup final, it's not unsuitable but not ideal. Slightly above average, overall."
"The dry sourness does stay in the mouth, but the overall feel is only average, the brewer hasn't pushed any boats out. This is a run of the mill kellerbier, I was hoping for more from an old Pilsner brewery I used to support when living in Germany."
"This is a little chewy and well bodied, even for the lower alcohol content. The left over yeasts leave behind a unique texture."
"Best before 30-04-05. Pours in fine and gives a nice head that stays quiet well. Golden color with a fine opalizing cloud. Nose is fine too, sweet malty, fresh and delicate yeastfruit. Taste is litle empty though; lightly malted, watery and dry. That with a poor hopping giving just a light aftertaste and mouthfeel. Only that mouthfeel is a litle tinkled by the carbon dioxide. Drinkability is ok but am a litle dissapointed in this one being a German Urtyp Unfiltriert! Nothing wrong with it though."
"This beer has weizen like looks. Pours a cloudy light yellow. A thick white head meets the top of the glass but rapidly fades away. Aroma of yeast is present. Not a weizen yeast but a musty smell. Taste is more pilsner like with a yeast backing. Thin body and a watery feel kilss this beer. Overall an O.K brew to try."
