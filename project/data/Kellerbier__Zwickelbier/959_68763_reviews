"It may have been 30 degrees outside and thanksgiving plans are in the air, but I still enjoyed this beer immensely and quickly, maybe sneaking in happy thoughts of sunshine and bbq grills. As far as the style goes, this could easily be my go-to lager. I imagine if I tried a fresher bottle or straight from the tap the aroma situation would be significantly better,"

"Rather bitter aftertaste after some sipping. Yeasty flavors further down the bottle. Definitely unfiltered. From the 22 oz bottle purchased at Malt & Vine in Redmond, Washington."

"Taste clean crisp and bold. Quite hoppy for this fairly light beer. Hop flavor is saaz-like tinny with some pear and apricot fruity. Works great with the sharp spicy zip in the hop bitter, similar to the zip in a Bohemian Pils. Crisp sharp fine carbonation complements with the flavors and zip. Finishes with a bit of honey sweet. Nice beer, but is this style supposed to be just a bohemian pils that's allowed to be cloudy?"

"Pours a hazy golden orange with a foamy bone head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, and citrus fruit aromas. Taste is much the same with citrus zest and grassy flavors on the finish. There is a medium amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that is fairly refreshing and easy to drink."

"Overall- Very solid beer. It doesn't wow me but it is definitely worth a try. The only area in which lacks is aroma but that is to be expected with a lighter style."
"The body was smooth and even, with a nicely dry finish. Drinkability was good, it went down smooth and quick, and I'll certainly have another. Overall, a very nice brew, one that'll be a choice when you're in the mood for something lighter, certainly worth a shot when you see it."

"Overall: this beer is highly refreshing and drinkable. I'll definitely be picking this one up again."

"Poured into a Celebrator pokal. Pours a clear golden orange amber, thin fine white head leaves a long lasting thin film and ring around the glass and wispy lacing. Aroma is bready malt, simple stright forward lager. Flavor is bisquity and bready malt with a hint of citrus and yeast with a pleasant hop kick in the finish. Medium bodied with a hint of creaminess; excellent for a low ABV lager. Deceptively simple, the flavor is complex enough to keep my interest throughout the bottle. An enjoyable lager, the unfiltered process definitely adds more flavor and body to this beer. I wil buy this again."

"love the color on this thing. dark for a lager, a tad bit hazy, and not much head... the smell is the weakest part for me, some sour/sweet thing going on for the nose. the sweet aspect smells cheap to me, kind of a cough drop thing goin on. the taste makes up for it. honey, bit of grass, pear and green tea. ends crisp. too bad these aren't in sixers, they'd make a good summer session."
"All in all a very drinkable beer and one that I will enjoy if Summer ever joins us here in the Northwest!"
"O: Very good and very easy to drink"
"Pours a hazy golden orange, with ample off-white head; lacing lingers in a thick cap. Smell is slight sulfur, orange, mango, slight sweetness reminiscent of an APA. Taste is biscut, bready malt and a yeast kick, slight citrus with a slight hop bite. Very well balanced and smooth, the lager yeast makes what would be a mild APA a great sessionable lager. Carbonation is medium high and prickly, clean smooth body, a hair thicker than normal lagers, piney after taste lingers well with the biscut flavors. Very drinkable indeed!"
