The aroma is a simple doughy barley with a hint of toast and caramel and the slightest earthy mineral touch that carries over into the flavor with the malts. The body is smooth and balanced with a touch of sweetness. It reminds me more of a low-hop Czech lager, or a lighter Dortmund Export lager than a kellerbier, but it's a damn fine beer to have at the end of the day. I'd drink more if I had one, but I don't get to Sconie that often.","tempest","Jul 28, 2014"

It's certainly an easy drinking beer for the season with no big flaws to steer anyone away, but overall it's rather lackluster -- especially for a beer that's supposed to be bringing some carry-over from the brewing ingredients in the weight of residual ingredients not filtered (or settled) away. I'm giving it slightly better than okay in "Overall" because it's smoother and a step better in flavor than the usual macro brew.","steveh","Jun 17, 2014"

I love the flavor of this, it starts off with that dry baguette like character that is sometimes found in a fine biere de garde. The flavor is wonderfully complex, with lemon, crisp nicely bitter noble hops, some corn (and for the first time in my life, not in a bad way), some honey, a light spiciness, and a light floral character.

Spice, white pepper, light stonefruit; complex. Up front fruitiness on the palate, sweet pale malt, faintly yeasty, peppery spice, slight and pleasant buttery slickness.

Almost has me believing there's some wheat in here. Flavor is pilsener perfection. This is exactly the malt profile I want in a pilsener. Some taste like corn, some taste like cereal grains, some taste like pure pale malt, but this tastes like fresh bread, with a light honeyed character giving it some sweetness. Again I'm detecting a mild pithy banana note in there that points to wheat, but maybe it's just some sort of yeasty note? A little grassiness on the finish, which is super crisp. Reminds me of Reality Czeck to an extent, but more traditional (i.e. not hopped to delicious oblivion). Dry and very refreshing. Not too thin and not at all fizzy. Just sublime.

Yokel is no exception, with its tasty notes of butter squash, zesty yeast spize, clover honey, and a ton of German hops. Mouthfeel is light, with a peppery body and carbonation level.

Smell is a sweet lemongrass, noble hops, and some yeasty notes. Very crisp and clean on the nose. Taste is a sweet bread like flavor with some grain as well. Very refreshing beer, definitely one I could enjoy during the summer. Aftertaste is somewhat candy like and enjoyable. Light bodied with a good amount of carbonation. Very interesting beer and goes down very well. I could see one leading to another, and then another...etc. Another beer that proves New Glarus knows what they're doing.","BeerTruth","Oct 10, 2007"

Delicious. A little bit of grain, barnyard hay, and wheat creep in. Yeast chunk pour (maybe I shouldnt) of clear yellow. Soapy white head, fading fast. Flavor is a medium-bodied, yet fulfilling middle malt with a nip of corn husk and a long, clean malt ride. Not much depth or nuance, but fairly cleanly, drinkable and bright. Why have Totally Naked when you have this? At least this maintains a few apple notes and light grain flavor in the face of lightness.

It just suits my taste; and I wish they had this at the UW rathskellar so I could sit by the lake and enjoy a few with my girlfriend as the sun went down. Anyway, It's golden (and I certainly don't mind the haze from the yeast) with a frothy dollop of bright white foam atop. The head retention is quite good and it leaves nice lace. The nose is malty and just slightly hoppy - I could use some more hops, but at least it's not overly hopped. It's smooth and lightly creamy in the mouth, and sweetish in the flavor with a nice, fresh maltiness and some spicy and floral hops - even a touch citrusy in the background.

Clarity is good, with just a slight haze and no carbonation is apparent. Nose is enticing. I get notes of lightly honey coated grain, and herbal to grassy hop. Light toastyness is apparent, but not strong. Flavor is much the same as the nose. The toasted bread character is more prevalent, balanced with a sweet and grainey character. This is backed by a moderate herbal noble hop, finishing with just a kiss of bitterness and a lemony zest. The aftertase is almost like a honey bread, with a sweet and melanoidan toastyness. I like the aftertaste a lot. Mouthfeel is moderate with a light and very fine carbonation, which works well with the flavors found in the brew. I have not had many brews in this style, so I don't have much to judge by, but this one is tasty. The solid melamoidan flavors marry well with the lighter grainyness and the herbal to floral noble hop. This is a nice take on a German style by a US brewer.","kmpitz2","Apr 09, 2006"

4.45,14.7,4,4,4.5,4.5,5,"Pours a slightly cloudy golden color with a bit of an orange hue. Had a nice white head that dissipated quickly, leaving small amounts of lacing and a nice ring around the glass. Smell is pretty nice with some lemon smells, biscuit, a bit of corn, and some floralness. Not great, but pretty interesting and enjoyable. Taste is slightly bready with a definate lemon zest in there as well, hops are present but faintly. There is even a bit of corn flavor in there that I think pairs well with this. Not a whole lot of carbonation, and a light to medium body on this one. I like that it is not overcarbonated like most beers of this style. Drinkability is definately deserving of a perfect. This beer is great for almost any occasion and can be enjoyed by virtually anyone.","badbeer","Mar 20, 2006"

It will satisfy both the micro and macro beer drinkers. This is a beer that will be very satisfying come summer. I will be purchasing this beer again.","ClearDog","Feb 20, 2006"

3,-22.7,2.5,2.5,3,3.5,3.5,"12 ounce bottle. New Glarus Yokel pours out a slightly cloudy yellow color with very little head. Strong aroma of bread dough and leafy hops. Grain flavor with lots of yeast. Not too sweet, thankfully. The bitter, hoppy finish is the best aspect of the flavor. Medium mouthfeel and carbonation. I sampled this beer fresh, and it is only average. Even fresh it seems to be on the verge of skunkiness. A glorified spotted cow.","beveragecaptain","Feb 13, 2006"

Gulp after gulp after guld, this beer dissapeared quickly. Well made and balanced to perfection. I gotta give it to NG, this is damn tasty.","Skidz","Feb 12, 2006"
