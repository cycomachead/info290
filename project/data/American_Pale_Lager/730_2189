Palate is sweet cornbread with a touch of noble hop spice. The hops do exert a subtle wintergreen effect on the palate. A bit of baker's yeast. Quite sweet for a pale lager and admittedly enjoyable on this level. Fairly dry finish and the hops do assert themselves a bit as you go.

The beer pours a straw yellow, with nice lacing and it's got that sweet citrus aroma that most pilsners do. It looks like your typical Canuck lager but it tastes much better than any adjunct lagers out there. This is the beer you give to someone who declares that they will ""never drink that expensive craft beer", and the price point is right in line with the big boys of the world.","zachloveshisbeer","Beers"

The first beer poured (into a tall, slim glass stein) with no head and the second with a small amount of white, creamy head that stayed there entire time. The body is clear yellow, with a slight golden tinge. The aroma has apple, grape, and grain (presumably from the hops). The taste has that noble hops quality continued. It is a lightly flavoured beer; the flavour is similar to buttered bread. It is light to medium bodied with an almost perfect carbonation (little bit more would have been great). It feels very smooth. Overall, I find it to be a good, decent pilsner. I would gladly drink it again (would be a good session beer). I think I understand its popularity: it is light enough for mass appeal, but with a distinctive enough taste for people to think it is something unique and amazing.","maclean25","Aug 13, 2012"

Lots of sweet corn flavours begin to come out more as it warms. Modest body with plenty of sharp, somewhat harsh carbonation. I've had this on occasion but never had the opportunity to review it.

Very, very easy to drink...I could find myself drinking a boat load of this without realising it. That is how easy this beer is going down. A keeper folks!","Shadman","Nov 04, 2006"
4.25,23.2,4,4,4.5,3.5,4.5,"Had at Bierbistro in Toronto. Wasn't expecting this from a Ontario beer (most everything on-tap was malty) but passes as a very good current Pilsener. Light on the hops (I prefer a 40-50 IBU in Pilsners) with very good taste structure. Finishes well. Recommended for Pils fans.","Niniimaa","Oct 24, 2006"
4.18,21.2,4,3.5,4.5,4,4.5,"It's a clean smooth brew, that has only 4 basic ingredients and no preservatives which leaves it smooth and crisp and you could drink these all night and not be hung over the next day. I would compare this to Budvar and probably rank it right after it. This is a great beer!","eze153","Sep 10, 2006"

4.13,19.7,4.5,4,4,4,4.5,"Not only on-tap, but on-tap at the brewery in generous glasses as part of their tour. It was handed to me with a big, foamy, bone-white head. The color was a bright lemon-yellow and the Saaz hops were evident on the nose. The mouthfeel was medium, with a great,dry hoppiness on the tongue. The finish lingered with hops and left me licking my lips for more. I had some in a bottle later, but this was just fantastic!","woodychandler","Jun 08, 2006"
3.88,12.5,4,3.5,4,4,4,"This poured into a styrofoam cup (Yeah, i know. It's all I could get there..) nicely with a very thick creamy head that stuck around for the while time, quite nice. Smell was a bit hoppy but a tad skunky as well. The prominence of the hops in this brew were evident in the flavor, Bitter but not excessive. This was quite easy going down and was a very good BBQ beer, After all these years I learned to appreciate this one a bit more, and see it for what it is afterall, a pretty decent locally produced pilsener style beer.","funkengruven","May 02, 2006"

3.68,6.7,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"*Note* What a difference temperature makes. This brew becomes more enjoyable as it warms up a bit, so don't drink it ice-cold. However, if you must drink a beer ice-cold, I suggest drinking this from the bottle intead of pouring.","jayc333","Apr 22, 2005"
2.07,-40,3.5,1.5,2,3,2,"Pale straw yellow colour with brilliant clarity and a thin white head that showed some lacing. The aroma was packed full of DMS, vegetal sweetness and sulfury hops. Veggie sweetness carried into the flavour. Bitterness was much harsher than it should have been, given the moderate hopping level. Light body, high carbonation. Not an impressive offering, at least to my palate.","DrJay","Jan 02, 2005"
3.63,5.2,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"In general, I would say this is the type of beer that would be quite good on a hot day. Light and refreshing, but enough hops to let you know you're still drinking a beer.","smcdowell","Oct 25, 2004"
3.58,3.8,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,4.5,"This beer often gets trashed and is actually classed in the wrong style category as an ajunct lager. It is 100% malted barley, no corn. I find it pleasing and nuanced in its flavours, making it an ideal camping beer or thirst quencher. Points go to Steam Whistle for packaging this beer in enclosed cardboard boxes after bottling it in green glass.","Beersignal","Oct 03, 2004"
3,-13,3,3,3,3,3,"Tap: Clear yellow beer with small head with below average retention. Aroma is quite sweet with more or less malt. Taste was quite enjoyable with some refreshing sweetness. Lacking a bit of character and body to make this truly good but better then some other lager that I had the misfortune of drinking over the years.","Phyl21ca","Oct 03, 2004"
3.55,2.9,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,4,"Bender Factor: Their concept is cool. Steam Whistle is located in an old railroad roundhouse next to the Skydome. I really like their marketing ploy. The way that they have the samples and tours set up is outstanding.","wailingwench","Aug 13, 2004"
3.5,1.4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"This Ontario micro is a pale gold color with a foamy medium sized head that leaves a little lace on the glass. The aroma is weak, a mix of bready malts and floral noble hops. The taste is quite nice with a unique doughy malt profile and a bit of spicy, floral hops. The mouthfeel is light with a spritzy carbonation. The finish is bland and shortlived. This beer is a good pilsner though its a bit vapid.","CAMRAhardliner","Jul 31, 2004"
3.2,-7.2,3,3,3.5,3,3,"Drinkability: hmm, not really a traditional Pils as it claims to be but on the other hand, it's not half bad. i admit this isn't a world class pils but it is drinkable and less offensive than most generic macros.","Popsinc","Jul 30, 2004"
3.41,-1.2,4,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"I woudn't go out of my way for this. I would recommend this to a Coors, Coors Light, or Busch drinker looking for something of quality.","canoehornpoint","Jul 13, 2004"
2.81,-18.6,3,2,3,2.5,3.5,"Overall though this would make a good session beer, good summer beer but at $11.95 for a 6pack its waaay overpriced. For the same price I can get 6 500ml cans of Bitburger, Konig and other euro pilsners at the LCBO.","SaunaKing","Jan 04, 2004"
3.26,-5.5,4,3,3,3,4,"PS. For $6, the tour, souvenir pint glass and all the samples you want, and a chance to pull their genuine steam whistle, it's a good deal.","baiser","Dec 09, 2003"
2.25,-34.8,2.5,2.5,2,2,2.5,"Drinkability: Pilsener does not equal watery, light, and fizzy. Clashing tastes and no body make for a bad beer experience.","ManekiNeko","Jun 15, 2003"
3.05,-11.6,3,3,3,3.5,3,"Ok beer in a retro green bottle. Enjoyed best at their brewery where there is often hoopla. Sweet floral taste with dry astringent aftertaste. Would have enough rather than a national Canadian brand but rank is weak compared to other microbrewery peers.","Sammy","Apr 29, 2003"
3.17,-8.1,2.5,3,3,3,4,"However this stuff is pretty drinkable, I'll give it that. Yet I drank most of the case after chilling it in the freezer for about 15 minutes, and then directly out of the bottle. Great for barbequing. The glass pour exposes where it falls short.","IronDjinn","Mar 12, 2003"

3.11,-9.9,3.5,2.5,3.5,3,3,"Hmm, a below average pilsner, but alright too try once. Attractive green bottle with history on the back. Dangerous in that green can cause skunk, but the beers were fine. Poured into the mug with a whooosh of carbonation, causing a fast rising head that dissipated even faster. Smell of barley and pine were apparent in this brew. Taste was crisp and sweet with malt, but lacked the necessary hop balance. Mouthfeel was crisp at first, but after a few sips became annoyingly sticky. Drinkable, but not something I would want to consume alot of at once.","slitherySOB","Feb 03, 2003"
4.1,18.8,4,4,4,4,4.5,"Aside form the biasing factors of the brewery's cool location (in an old locomotive repair warehouse in downtown Toronto near the CN tower and Sky dome) and the functioning steam whistle that they let you blow at the end of the brewery tour, this beer is quite good. While it is a bit sweet for a pilaster, possibly explained by its extra long barley mash, it is hopped enough to give good balance. Seam Whistle Pilsner has a lovely golden color and a nice sweetish smell, piney notes are followed by a citrus laced finish.","Bcant","Oct 23, 2002"
2.05,-40.6,2.5,2.5,1.5,3,2,"Not acceptable...Sorry but I did not care for this brew as it left me wanting...no hops in evidence here and the sweet malty taste carried through into the after taste...the packaging was probobly its strong point and that reminded me of a circus clown of low character..","Shiloh","Oct 20, 2002"
2.53,-26.7,3,2.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,"The pour a clear and gold color with the head frothy in texture and the color white, size is average with the lace a thin covering upon the glass. Nose is malt and sweet, crisp and fresh, front sweet with a fair malt profile, the top skimpy in feel. Finish has a decent hop presence and the acidity stinging, quite dry aftertaste, drinkable but not much else to be said unfortunately.","Gusler","Beers"
3.6,4.3,3,3,4,3,4,"Revisted this beer as a new brewmaster was brought on line at SW. This is now a very nive malt biased pilsner...I love the tart biscuit finish now....smutty yeast taste is gone and the maly body is significantly improved....this is a micro pils for those who like a malt accent to this style","pootz","0"
