"An excellent session later that I could drink all night..."

"Overall this is very nice. I think Jack's Abby is doing something different, but in the right direction, with this beer. I think a typical Bud Light, Miller Light, or Coors Light drinker could pick one of these up on occasion and be happy with it. I'm giving the beer a B+ and an 87/100. Nice lager with a good hop hick."

"Another good session from Jack's Abbey."

"O - Perfect lawnmower beer.  Would be fairer to label it a light lager, but my rating reflect the BA style label.  Otherwise, I'd give it a 4.5."

"Cheers!"
"Got in a BIF from ZebraCakez. 12 ounce bottle into lager glass, no bottle dating. Pours lightly hazy bright golden color with a 1 finger dense white head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty lacing clings on the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation retaining the cap. Aromas of big grapefruit, lemon zest, orange peel, cracker, bread, herbal, floral, grass, light pine, and herbal/grassy earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance of bright citrus/floral hops and light-moderate pale malt notes; with good strength. Taste of grapefruit, lemon zest, orange peel, cracker, bread, herbal, floral, grass, light pine, and herbal/grassy earthiness. Light herbal/grassy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of grapefruit, lemon/orange zest, cracker, bread, and herbal/grassy earthiness for a short bit. Very nice balance of bright citrus/floral hops and light-moderate pale malt flavors; with a good malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. The finish has a good amount of dryness as well; and is very clean on lager flavor with zero yeast ester notes present. Medium carbonation and light-medium bodied; with a very smooth, crisp, and slightly bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with zero warming present after the finish as expected of 4.5%. Overall this is a damn nice pale lager style. All around great balance of bright citrus/floral hops and light-moderate pale malt flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A very enjoyable offering."

"O- a great session lager with high drinkability and plenty of crisp toasted malty notes"
""
"Very smooth lager flavour, with fairly sweet yet mellow malts and slight biscuit and nutty flavours. More citrus hops than common for lagers, but nicely balanced."

"Overall: A pretty great beer, and one I certainly would enjoy again. However, given the availability of cheaper session IPAs, if I want a hoppy, low ABV beer, I'll probably reach for one of those over this, as I find the lager style adds little to no obvious complexity to the beer, as the lager subtleties are drowned out by the hops in this one."

"This is the best bottled lager I've ever had. Also, it's consistently delicious."
""
"The tip of the tongue is immediately hit with crispness that softens and spreads out over the palate.  It gets fluffy and stays crisp but light, the body also light and bitterness adding a dry and, in a sense, ""earthy"" aspect as it relates to mouthfeel."

"O: [3.50] I am not a fan of wheat beers.  That is what this tasted like to me at first.  It improved as I continued drinking.  The taste got sweeter from the malts.  I have really liked all of the Jack's Abby beers - but this one I would pass on.  I am not a fan of the style.  It seems solid - but it is not my cup of tea (beer)."

"AVAILABILITY: Year-round"
"On tap at New York Pizza. Pours a translucent dark golden color with an inch of head. Minimal lacing. The aroma is some lightly toasted malts with some citrus and grassy hops. The taste is more of the same. Bready malts mixed with some grassy hop bitterness. Some citrus near the end with floral and grassy hop notes. The finish is more of the malts with some light bitterness. Light mouthfeel and a bit watery. Very easy to drink and refreshing. This would be a solid canned session beer, but there are better options out there. Still good, though. Overall, not the best Jack's Abby has to offer but not a bad beer by any strech of the imagination."

" The taste is very good with lager-like malt flavor with slight dank hops which are herbal and the toasted grain supports this combination well with light earthy weed hoppiness and low sweetness in the taste with a dry finish and light resinous aspect that adds a citrus tanginess with gentle yeast in the finish with mild caramel quality from the malt. Overall I consider this well above average for the style -very good hop flavor in a sessionable lager strength with a slight raw hop quality."
"Looks like a lager and tastes like a lager. Very limited bitterness. Nice bready malt sweetness. No off flavors that sometimes pair with craft lagers. This beer is clean and crisp and very enjoyable on a warm day. Jack's Abby makes really well crafted lager bodies, which show in the smooth mouthfeel. Reminds me a lot of New Glarus lagers, which is a good thing."
""
"o. Not being a typical Lager guy, I may have just found my go to lager"
""
"O- Super easy to drink, fairly flavourful for a pale malt. No off-flavours, enjoyable."
""
""
"Nailed it. Nice deep golden color. I'll have to pour  the next one so I get a good look at the head. Cascades on the nose, maybe a little grapefruit. Light, fruity hops up front, clean slightly toasty finish. There is that grapefruit again. Nice body. A terrific lager."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O: Very nice beer, again, sort of unique tasting, the combination of American hops and German lager taste is interesting, and tasty. I would order this again."

"Easy, but you can taste the quality. A lager, not a pils, so only 20 IBUs, no matter what I want it to be. Yet also thin and underdeveloped. I've had this idea done better (i.e. Session Lager)."
""
""
""
""
"Bottle picked up locally enjoyed from a jack's abby snifter. Brew pours a soft transparent yellow orange with a thin fizzy head gone quick. Nose is subtle pilsner malt with a hint of grain. Taste is also fairly mellow. A true session lager. But well made. Malty with a lager bite."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Hmm. It's hard to rate this one. I think they really hit their mark with making a highly drinkable sessionable beer. I'd like to have more out of this beer but based on what they were going for I think they really did a great job. Light hop presence, small input from the lager yeast, moderate but light malts...how do I feel? This wouldn't be my first choice out of a random 100 beers but I think they accomplished what they were going for and for that I say kudos."
"Overall: The smell was the best thing about this for me. If I wanted to get drunk I'd go for it but truthfully might go to other mass produced American Lagers. This beer isn't bad but definitely the Jack's Abbey I like the least so far. Although I haven't reviewed many I really like great lager's. this just isn't one."

"Great beer. Awesome alternative to the ""name your session ipa"" beers. Completely clean, fresh and packed with character."
""
""
"Overall: A very enjoyable APL from the Framingham bros. This is going to be a good warm weather beer."
""
"Simply put, this is a beautiful beer. Wonderful hop aroma of citrus, tropical fruit, and fresh-cut grass weaves beautifully into a canvas of mild cracker and bread undertones layered with very light bitterness and American hop notes. Everything is balanced extremely well, which beckons one to quaff as many pints as he or she wants to. If this isn't the epitome of a world-class session beer, it's damn close."
"Easily beats most lagers in the drinkability category but i expected a bit more flavor coming from this brewer."
""
""
""
""
""
"Compared to some of this brewery's other offerings, this is more of a standard, Munich style lager - but it's one of the best renditions I've had on the style thus far in America. I could easily stock up on this during the warmer months, in spite of its light, crisp feel. In a world propelled with breweries trying to outdo each other with high gravity, ridiculous recipes, this is a nice breath of fresh air (for now)."

"Clear light gold colour with a thin whitish cap. Good head retention, kind of sticky. Bright lemony aroma, citrus and a bit of spiciness, doughy malt, really nice. Tangerines up front, toasted malt, slight green/grassy hop character, slight spice. Short finish with minty bitterness lingering on the palate. Light bodied, average CO2, off-dry. Quite good and very refreshing."
"The flavor follows with a bit of citrus, but mostly grassy lager hops. It has a substantial bready malt in there. A well made beer in the line of pilsners and helles. Traditional in flavor, but nothing surprising."
"There is a citrusy, orange, and apple taste up front. The hop finish is mild hut lingers. It works for the style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this would be a great deck beer in the summer. Loads of flavor with a low enough ABV to enjoy the whole sixer on a warm day."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The palate is what you'd expect from the description. A really nice blend of bready and doughy malt with a touch of honey, this is pretty refreshing. The mid palate brings the hops to the forefront, with a moderate bitterness and mild citrus character. Bready on the finish with a clean, lingering bitterness, this beer is medium light in body and is crisply carbonated. The carbonation does have a mild acidity that doesn't wholly work with the sweeter malt flavors IMO. A delightful little beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - An ideal session beer, exactly as its label suggests."
""
"This is a light bodied brew with modest carbonation. A very clean, crisp and enjoyable offering that I could effortlessly throw a few pints back without getting bogged down. This is worth seeking out."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: So this is what a very good American Pale Lager can taste like. A great post-lawnmowing beer or one to have when you're having more than one. If this were a little cheaper, I'd buy it by the case in the summer. If it finished just a bit more crisp then I would be completely enamored with this beer. As it is, I'm still quite happy with it."
"Sort of mix of helles, but not as soft, and a pils, but not as crispy hoppy. Lives up to its session lager goal, but I'd prefer something more true to either style I mentioned."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Excellent lager. Like the idea this is a session at 4.5% One of the better craft lagers I've enjoyed."

"Solid golden yellow, a little bit of haze, with a large, stable head on top. Floral hops upfront in the nose along with some bready malt, spicy/leafy notes, and lager yeast. Flavor continues along the spicy, grassy line, joined by some toasted grain and earth. Clean and pretty light. Obviously real easy to drink, though I wish the malt came through a bit more."
"Nice head for a lager....about an inch high. Golden straw colored brew. Aroma is lightly sweet with brisk floral hops. Refreshing and nice to consume. Yes, sessionable indeed. Fresh crackery bread malt and zesty floral hop in the flavor. Fresh, simple, and well done."
""
""
""
""
""
" Could drink a bunch of these"
"A great easy drinking session lager from Jack's Abby. Their flagship, I believe."
""
""
""
"Looks and smells good, taste is too light. You could chug a lug a lot of this beer without a heavy taste interfering with your quaffing."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Very lightly hopped. The hop flavor is quickly overtaken by the malt. Good for a lager. Not what I usually drink but it definitely hits the spot today."
""
""
"o: An ok lager. Darker in color and slightly tastier than the average mainstream lager. I would not go out of my way to buy this again. Still really liking Jack's Hoponius Union IPL and 2nd Anniversary DIPL though."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This would be awesome in a can. It's most certainly worth picking up and would go down well after a long day of yard work."
""
""

""
""
"Pours a golden color with a solid sheet of light cream foam. Smells of grassy and piney hops with some dry grain in the background. Flavor is cereal grains, slight bitterness, some nice grass hops and a little bit of butter underneath it all; well played. Medium bodied with tight, snappy carb and a semi dry finish. Nice beer. Like the ABV on it. 3.75/4/4/3.75/4"

"O: This beer is extremely easy to drink and is perfectly sessionable."
""
""
"O - Light session lager with a touch of hop citrus."
""
"This is an easy drinking, well balanced beer. I could definitely drink a couple of these at one sitting."
""
""
""
""
"Had to down grade my first review. Nice aroma and color. Balance of bitter and malt is very good,not great. Mouth feel is the issue- tastes dissipates too quickly and is watery. It's comparable to a taking a lick off a lollipop. There are better and cheaper IPL's and Imperial Pilsner's out there."
""
""
""
""
"This lager is crisp, clean and smooth with a burst of flavorful floral hops and citrus up front that goes down easy and leaves a nice sweet bready taste in your mouth. This is one of the three staples in Jack’s Abby Brewery’s year-round brews and rightfully so. At 4 and a half percent ABV, this is their “session” offering and compared to their heavy hitting Black Lager and India Pale Lager it sure seems that way but don’t be fooled into thinking this is just any old regular lager because it has the character to prove otherwise."
""

"O - I only wish I could sit down with a friend and 8 of these bottles for an actual ""drinking session"". Haven't had one of those in a long time. Wonderful beer."

"Pale golden orange colour, one finger of white head with a good amount of lace present here as well, good head retention also. Smell is of crisp noble hops, grassy and earthy notes mixed with a lemony citrus, toasted grainy malts as well. Taste is of toasted malt with a moderate earthy bitter hop flavour, more lemony and lighter citrus fruits, grassy more earthy hops in the finish and aftertaste. Medium carbonation, crisp medium body. Absolutley one of the best pale lagers I have ever tried, I could easily drink much more of this over, really good stuff here."

"Poured into SA perfect pint glass. Appearance is a pale straw color with nice clarity and fizzy appearance. layer of head retention which leave decent amount of lacing. The nose is full of cereal malts which present a very bready dry malt profile. Light grassy hops follow and make for a nice balanced nose, especially considering the style. The taste is what you would expect given the aroma, dry grainy profile up front with mild sweetness next, finished by light earthy hop character. Flavors aren't overly huge, but they are present and well balanced. Mouthfeel is light and refreshing. Overall, this is a very nice take on a style that I otherwise am not a fan of. This brew would be perfect for a session on a warm day. Worth a try!"
""
""
""
""
"O: Another solid brew from JA. Doesn't look or feel like a light ""session"" beer, but given the 4.5% there is no arguing that it is. Plenty flavorful and very affordable. Get some"

"O-a decent session lager but lacks a little in flavor"
"The beer pours a pink-tinted yellow-gold with a huge head on top that sits as just slightly off-white in color with some creamy and soapy bubbles. The beer’s body is really quite clean with a slow but steady flow of bubbles traveling to replenish the head. The beer’s lacing is fat and poofy, like little clouds leaving a patchwork on my glass. On the nose, the beer smells clean but surprisingly layered and nuanced for this style of beer. It smells like spicy wheat bread alongside light touches of citrus and pine. The spice in the smell actually reminds me of rye, which is odd but quite intriguing. The grainy wheat bread smell has lovely light nuances of caramel and cereal grains, which further add to the complexity of the smells. On the tongue, the beer’s taste follows the nose and adds to it with decadent cereal grain and wheat notes, and very light kiss of hops to balance the beer out. This is what a pale lager should taste like! The taste begins with a citrus pine bite that has you thinking IPA, but that is quickly gentled and washed away by sweet wheat flake flavors which blossom into caramelly and cereal flavors with a touch of succulent wood flavoring that mellows the sweet beautifully. Underneath everything the hop bitters continue to act as a beautiful stabilizer for this beer, while hardly effecting the flavor at all. The finish stays strong with the wheat flake flavoring, stepping beautifully into Kellog-zone while never getting too sweet, and remaining remarkably refreshing. The aftertaste is clean and light with tasty cereal and wheat notes. On the mouth, this beer feels lager clean, lager crisp, and lager refreshing. The beer’s body is light with just enough oomf to let you know you’re drinking something tasty. The wheat notes seem to add just a touch of syrupy body to the beer, which is lovely. After the beer leaves, the mouth is left clean with a light sheen of saliva that invites further sips. Overall this beer is amazingly tasty. I could knock this beer back all night and not feel bad. It’s sessionable and it’s tasty, which are not always the easiest things to marry together in a beer. Yet another success from Jack’s Abby; this beer’s flavors are sure to woo Ale fans, while its lager characteristics should appease even the acolytes of Bud-Heavy. Try this beer."

"O - Very drinkable lager. Really appreciate this one. Not enough high quality American lagers like this being made these days. Jack's Abby is awesome."
""
""
""
""
"Jack's Abby is rapidly becoming one of my favorite out there breweries. They have lagers dialed in. This one is flavorful, yet incredibly light and sessionable. Before I knew it my 16 oz was gone. Really digging something under 5% that has actual flavor."
"O – This is a fantastic lager with a ton of flavor for a session beer. This is really a fantastic beer. I know that there are a lot of beer enthusiasts out there that aren’t quite sold on lagers. This one should change their mind."
"O: real solid beer for what it is not great but for a session beer I'd drink the hell out of this over anything a big brewery can offer I like it I will be back"
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: The balance of this beer is spot on. So easy to drink. I would definitely say this is a winner."
""
"I've had a lot of experience with lagers, and while good, this beer really isn't very flavorful. The hops are muffled, and the malt character is dull. Clean, drinkable, and solid, as far as American lagers go. (3)"
""
"Reviewed from journal notes"
"O: Very tasty, goes down quite easily, not too filling, mild kick, very good representation of style, this is an excellent beer to session with for a very long time."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is a solid session lager, and while it doesn’t necessarily wow the tasetebuds, it does deliver a solid drinking experience, featuring a good range of hop and malt flavors, and thus provides a fantastic (and certainly far superior) alternative to Anheuser-Busch fare."
"O - A tasty and unique beer. Very sessionable and very flavorful. Craft lagers, they do work!"
"O: Easy drinking, sessionable and tasty. Another lager done right by Jack's Abby, too bad the macro lagers couldn't be like this, they could learn a thing or two from JA. Would like to see this in a 6 pack as apposed to the 4 pack pint bottles it comes in."
"Overall: Again a great beer. Looking forward to going to the brewery in Framingham in order to take a tour and get some brewery fresh beer!"
""
""
"O: I feel as though the coarseness of the wheat, the high level of carbonation, and the slight lack of smoothness should detract from the drinkability, but they really don't . Not much, at least. Perhaps not quite as refined as the other Jack's Abby offerings, but still more than worth a try."
""
"D - This is pretty much what I want from an American Pale Lager. Drinks like a really clean blend of American and English Pale Ales. Crushable at 4.5%, albeit significantly more subtle than Hoponius Union. This might be a good way to win over lovers of fizzy yellow beer."
""
""
"Taste starts with sweet, quickly overpowered by almost skunky hops, which carry through the close which has ample bitterness. Mouthfeel is smooth, and drinkability is easy. Says session on the bottle, and that works for me."
"Pours a crystal clear deep medium golden color with a huge fluffy white head that sticks around forever. Smells of bready pilsner and sweet Munich malts with a floral and earthy hop aroma as well as a spicy component that reminds me of wheat. The flavor is earthy hops up front with a bit of bready malt beneath it. Middle and finish showcase some earthy spicy wheat and hops. Medium to light body with a moderate level of carbonation and a slick almost spicy resinous mouthfeel. This was not at all what I was expecting, but I thoroughly enjoyed it just the same. Jack's Abby continues to impress me with their offerings."
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured into a Squatters True Pint glass a very nice dark golden yellow color, very nice carbonation, with a nice one-finger white creamy head, with some nice sticky lacing left behind. The nose is hoppy, malty, slight citrus note. The taste is malty, with a nice hop note. A very nice smooth session brew, many can be had. Almost half gone in a matter of minutes. Medium body, like the label sez, starts off hoppy, finishes malty, with some slight bitterness. Overall a very nice brew for a hot day. Thanks Bill!"
""
""
"O: Another great lager from JA. Could drink this beer all the time without a problem."
"Beer pours a clear yellow-gold with a thin white head. Smell is of bready malt and some nice citrus and flowery hops, though the hops aren't nearly as overpowering in the smell as Hoponius Union. This one smells a lot more like a traditional lager. The taste follows the smell - it's exceptionally clean and crisp but has a finish that's a little more bitter than your typical lager. There's also a little bit of the fruitiness from the hops in the flavor, but it mixes very nicely with the graininess of the lager. Mouthfeel is light-bodied. Overall, I have to say that this is one of my favorite lagers out there and maybe even a notch above Dortmunder Gold (one of my favorites) for a session-type lager. It's a perfect summer beer and the hops give it a nice little extra bite that you don't find in most lagers, but it's far from overwhelming. If you're looking for something more traditional from Jack's Abby, this is the lager for you. Damn good."
""
""
"o - Overall I thought this was a great lager; one of the better ones I've had in a while. Between this, Smoke & Dagger, and Hoponious Union, I'm becoming a huge fan of this brewery. Being able to get a 16.9 oz bottle of this for $2.50 at the brewery, I'd be there all the time if I lived in MA. Insanely drinkable and while not quite as hoppy or flavorful as Hoponious, easier to drink a few of and a great beer. Highly recommended."
""
"O- This was very good for a sessionable American Pale lager. Lots of flavor and tons of nice fruity flavors that balance very well with the pale malts. Definitely one of my favorite lagers and $11/4-pack of 500ml bottles you definitely can't go wrong. Definitely recommend trying this. Jack's Abby makes some great lagers."
""
"The pour is a clear yellow color with a white head. A very good hoppiness to the nose. Citrus and floral hops dominate up front. Sweet biscuit malt comes through as the hops fade away. A nice mild sweetness on the palate which is complemented nicely by the citrusy and floral hop profile. Very light bitterness and just a very good beer all around."
"Very nice session beer!"
"Verdict: Pretty decent beer. Pale lagers, session beers and the like aren't really known for their exciting flavors or provocative creativity but this hits the spot on a hot day. Thanks to Rudzud for this extra!"
""
""
"Appearance is a bright golden color with two fingers or white head. Its` nose contains pine, grass, some hops. Had been hearing about Jack`s Abby for some time now and was excited to finally try them. Take a sip and I taste malts, some hops, a little bitter. Mouthfeel is light, finishes crisp with some more of that bitterness. As noted on the label, this is a session beer and a damn fine one at that. Maybe with some time, this will make its` way down to CT !"
"Notes: This is a dam tasty Lager very well hopped with a good dry finish. Cheers."
"Overall a worthwhile beer to drink in the summer."
""
""
"Well, call me a fanboy. I think I have my pale american lager of choice. It's sad that I can't get this in 12 packs. I don't want this in half liter bottles. I want a bunch of it on hand at all times, all the summer long."
""
"This beer sure has a lot more going on than your average American pale lager. The boys at Jack's Abby have once again taken a pretty mundane style and created an extreme version of it. Nicely done."
""
""
"O: A fantastic example of the style. Easily one of the best that I've tried. Another fine beer from Jack's Abby!"
"Though I technically enjoyed it less than Hoponius Union, I do think this is a better example of the ""American hoppy lager"" they're going for, just about an even balance here with good characteristics from both sides. Definitely legit, good stuff."
""
""
""
"Overall: Given the style, this one is very good. It is a nice and hoppy lager that I would look for again and an excellent value. That said, if I was not grading to style, my marks would be closer to a 3.5. While this is clean and very well done, there is just something missing that I cannot put my finger on."
""
"Overall (3.5/5): Jabby Brau is definitely decent beer; perhaps not my style, but I think the brewers achieved their goal of creating a light and accessible beer made for summer quaffing. You could definitely throw back a few of these in one sitting. To me, though, it's just not that interesting of a beer; while any beer geek can appreciate what it represents, few will love it."
""
"O: This session lager lives up to its name. I would enjoy drinking this all the time. Thanks again, SneezyAchew!"

"Packs a lot of flavor into a 4.5% lager. Good blend of yeast, malt and hop influence."
"Cost: $3.99 for a 16.9 oz bottle."
""
"Overall, liked this the more I drank it. Worth a try. Surprising and different and very obviously well made."
""
"O: it's a nice beer and a good break from other more popular craft styles."
"O/D-I have been dying to try anything from Jack's Abby. This is an absolute steal for $2.50 per half liter. I absolutely love this beer and may have to go and by six more of these just to have lying around."
"Gold in color with one finger of white head. When fresh, the aroma gives off a touch of leafy citric hops along side the very clean, dry malt. Faint corn. It's flavor is similar to the Aroma in that you notice notes of leafy hops up front which then gives way to slightly sweeter malts that taste fairly short and dry. Smooth, especially as it warmed up. Typically one might think a session lager works cold, almost like lawn mower beer, but the malt profile brings macros to mind when cold. When at room temperature, it's a bit more interesting and smoother. i just wish the malt backbone wasn't so generic. i wish it was either strictly a pils malt profile, or something a bit more malty (i really wish they had a full time pils in economical 6 packs). Overall, the hop notes are a real nice touch for a session brew like this, but when it isn't under 2 months old, it's a bit too boring characterless because after the hop touch, there isn't much else to get excited about. There are much better session beers out there."

"Overall: I'm really digging everything I've had so far from Jack's Abby and this is no exception. I love having a beer with so much flavor and so little alcohol. A great session beer."
""
"I have not one complaint."
"This wasn't horrible but kind of clunky and disjointed for a drinkable lager."
""

"Mouthfeel is of course incredibly light- extra light body with moderate to full carbonation. A little resin-y but pretty negligible. Good session beer and you can't beat the price."
"Low alcohol but plenty of flavor (and a very affordable price of $3/bottle), you can easily enjoy a few of these in one sitting and not feel it in the head or the wallet. It is definitely a beer worth drinking, and one I look forward to drinking again and again."
"O: Amazing beer for the style. Simple and pretty light of course but wow, great balance with just a hint of hops, a touch of wheat and it's just perfectly smooth. Drinkability is off the scale. If Budweiser tasted like this, the craft beer movement never would have gotten off the ground. Another great beer from Jack's Abby."

"Very sessionable. I have to say that I would not necessarily go for this as a first choice given other beers that Jack's Abby puts out. So I can't say I would buy a growler of it. However, amongst other beers in this category its amazing. This is what a pale session lager should be. Very refreshing and drinkable."
"O: deffinatley not my favorite jacks Abby... I feel like this brew could use more hops and less malty breadiness... Really nothing spectacular.... It is flavorful for a session beer, I'm just not a huge fan of the flavor on display... Perhaps it's because I'm not that huge of a wheat beer fan... Or perhaps this is just not my thing. I am a little dissapointed."

"O - Overall, this is a good beer from Jack's Abby. I prefer their big, juicy hop offerings though. While a good beer, its no Kiwi Rising."
"Poured a 2.5"" white head with decent lifespan. The body is a clear straw yellow but with more radiance than typical. It smells a little of malt and a lot of citrusy piney hops, already much more to this than your typical lager. The taste flips with a little citrusy piney hops followed by a lot of malt. Nice long nutty lager finish. Dare to say this brewery claims to specialize in lagers and it shows, and yes I'm proud this is a local brewer to my state."

"The aroma is citrusy hop, while the flavor is more blunt with some fruitiness up front and strong bitter finish. I also detected ""bubblegum""--this was surprisingly attractive. The combination works. I describe the body as a cross between oily and creamy."
""
"I'll be honest, I'm not a pilsner/lager guy and even when it comes to JA's beer's prefer their big 7-10%ABV hop monster, but this may be one of the most perfect simple session lagers out there. This may be the first beer I've ever tasted that both a BMC drinker and beer snob could agree on as a great beer."

"Overall delicious, maybe their best yet. Perfect balance of pilsner with noble hop taste and american hop aroma. Crisp, clean, super sessionable, I need to get me a growler of this. I really hope this is year round now."
