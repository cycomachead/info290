The smell is sweet with some grans and hops.  So far the is nothing bad about this brew.  The taste is bold with flavor but it has a smoothness to it.  They did a nice job with this one I really like this one. There is nothing over powering in this brew it has a nice balance to it.  The mouthfeel is nice clean and crisps. Overall I'm giving this brew a 4 out of 5.  I would buy this brew again.  This was better than what I was expecting.","nicholas2121","Sep 16, 2014"

I am rather surprised at its atrocious grades, but I am going to attribute those to a combination of the difficulty involved in finding a fresh sample of this beer, and BAs not really liking this sort of style in general. Probably my favourite Japanese lager to date... keeping in mind that all of the Japanese beer I've tried has been contract-brewed somewhere else.","thehyperduck","Aug 22, 2014"

2.54,-3.8,3.5,2.5,2.5,2.25,2.5,"Bottle poured into a glass at a Japanese restaurant in Calgary. Label indicates ""100% Malt"" and also describes the contents as one of the world's most unique beer drinking experiences. Um, OK. I will concur that the color is unique for the style, an almost mango yellow-orange with a light spattering of white bubbles. Aroma nearly non-existent except for a generic graininess tempered by just a dollop of bread-like sweetness. Taste is similarly grainy and quite astringent, faintly sour with very subtle grape and custard notes. Some buttery yeast peeks in and out as well. Rather bitter and not in a particularly positive way, the hops are coarse and some floral notes do little to diminish this effect. Uber-carbonated of course. What tannins are present at least serve to provide some flavor. Ugh. It is perhaps unfair to single this particular brew out, but whenever I go to an Asian restaurant (and I love Asian food) I feel the need to try something ""local"" and frankly its just depressing that this sort of thing still dominates folks' beer schemas across damn near the entire world. I shall have to bust out something Hitachino this weekend to restore my faith.","CalgaryFMC","Jul 24, 2014"

And i'm surprised you can get this taste with no hops at all.(I'll keep this in mind when i start brewing my own!!). At 5% ABV this is a nice beer to drink and it has what i'm looking for...which is the opposite of a beer called hopalicious... I usually like darker beers but this has a blond pale ale look. The smell and taste is sweet malty... and i like it!! Overall i'm pleasantly surprised and look forward to my next bottle...","guitarkirk","Jul 07, 2014"

The taste is average for a pale lager and actually better than I would have ever imagined being an AB-InBev/Japanese brew. This is a step up from the big breweries that make pale lagers with cheap ingredient fillers. I’m also getting some sweet hints of banana in the taste as well. A pretty decent brew by the Bud guys as painful as that is for me to say lol. But then again it said freshest within 180 days, I'm closer to 400 days so maybe that's a reason why it's better.","Lemke10","Nov 01, 2012"

2.85,8,2.5,2.5,3,3,3,"somehow i think this is better than many other asian beers on offer at sushi places. i had 3 of these with an outstanding dinner at nobu in las vegas. pours a light golden color with a thin white head, lots of bubbles, but very very thin. smells light malty and crisp, which it is in the flavor too. a little bready, but balanced off by some generic hopping. feel is average too, extremely light body with medium to bright carbonation. quite drinkable and palate cleansing between fish courses. overall this is far from a great beer, but when lined up with many of its asian counterparts, it is one of the most tolerable in my opinion.","StonedTrippin","Apr 23, 2012"

Definitely a lot of butterscotch in the flavor and a hint of breadiness, but no other complexity to be seen. Light body with high carbonation and a dry finish with no lingering after taste.

Easily one of the most drinkable beers out there. One interesting side note for any of you familiar with our macro-light offerings... If someone were to ask me what Kirin Ichiban tastes like, I'd say my first impression is that it reminded me of Coors Light, only with a richer taste and decent body. I guess it's what Coors Light wants to be if it were to ""grow up"" and become a ""real beer."" Easily one of my favorite ""go to"" beers when out on the town.

The grain smell is unusual and it is remniscent of rice, coming across sort of like rice-chex cereal. Not a complex profile, but interesting. Taste is mild and watery, to say the least. Gentle malt sweet with mushroom and pumpkin. Overcarbonated and the acrid bubbles that form on my tongue are a bother, so I will swirl to release some gas. The head refomed, much more sticky and attractive this time. The smell is much more like that of an american macro (corn is present) and now I also get a very faint hint of chili powder. That is really weird. The taste is much smoother now. The beer has two phases...early is a gentle sweet and this changes to a dry finish that comes across as bland grain fiber mixed with an aromatic from a hop (flavor is too faint for me to hazard a guess).

1.91,-27.7,2.5,1.5,2,2,2,"Not a pleasing beer by any means. I've had worse, but for a premium-import price the beer shouldn't taste this cheap. Those who like the flavor of Grolsch/Heineken might want to give this a try, but I wouldn't recommend this to anyone else.","Beastdog75","Aug 27, 2003"
2.72,3,4,2,2.5,3,3.5,"Gold color, small white head. Aroma is grainy, fruity and sweet. Light and crisp taste. Good flavor. Good balance of hops and malts. Simple clean taste. Some hoppyness and slight tingle on tongue. Finish is crisp and clean. Aftertaste is slightly bitter.","beerguy101","Aug 26, 2003"
1.85,-29.9,1.5,1.5,2,2,2,"Something is definately wrong with this beer. Poured it out of its can, into a glass...and the color was....I guess it's kinda gold, with an eye towards....green? This doesn't instill confidence. Figured it was one of those ""mythical Japanese creature"" things (Yea, I know it's brewed in L.A.). Gave it a sniff, and it smells a doctor prescribed it for a heinous infection. Took a sip. Tastes like it could give me a heinous infection. I'm not really sure this is beer. In fact, I'd be prepared to just label it a by-product of a hollywood face-lift lab. Simply a nasty, foul smelling brew.","SetarconeX","Aug 03, 2003"
2.23,-15.5,2.5,2,2,2,3,"Pale lightish yellow with a short lsting macro head of about 15 seconds of gas. No real lace generation. The smells are understated and vaquely vegetal overall, similar to Miller High Life. Flavor is thin, straight sucrose malt countered by an aggressive carbonation and a drying but lighly metallic hop. Vapor-like mouthfeel. Not a lot here, not a disagreeable aftertaste but I can't see choosing this over others in ordinary Lager category.","ADR","Aug 03, 2003"

2.07,-21.6,3,3.5,1.5,1.5,1.5,"This brew poured a medium head of fine to medium sized white bubbles that quickly disappeared and a carbonated weak straw yellow body. It has a strong hop aroma and a fizzy hop flavor without much character. This brew is not impressive in the least and I will probably never buy another one.","TheDM","Jun 22, 2003"
1.68,-36.4,2.5,2,1.5,1.5,1.5,"This lager poured a small white head with fine-small bubbles that quickly dissolved. There was no lacing on the sides of my glass. There was a lot of carbonation observed rising to the top. The body was gold in color. There was a bitter taste and an aftertaste observed with this lager. This lager lacked character and I was not impressed with this lager.","hotstuff","Jun 11, 2003"
1.66,-37.1,3,2,1.5,1,1.5,"Once upon a time, in a magical land far, far away I used to actually drink this stuff every once in a while, and didn't mind it that much. But I drank it iced cold and straight out of the bottle. Those days have reached the point of folklore by now. If you want a Japanese lager, this isn't it.","IronDjinn","May 30, 2003"
2.06,-22,3,2,2,2,2,"Watery lager and almost like Miller light or Coors light. Clear light gold with little flavor. I've had it before in bottle and was hoping it might be marginally better on draught but no luck. Great for quenching thirst but not satisfying as a beer.","BierReise","May 11, 2003"
2.23,-15.5,3,2.5,2,2.5,2,"Drinkability? Yeah, you can drink them, if you've got nothing better to do, nothing better to drink, and a mean streak of masochism...","feloniousmonk","May 04, 2003"
2.45,-7.2,2.5,2.5,2.5,2,2.5,"Color is clear yellow with a gold quality, but a vigorous pour produced very little head or foam. Smell is thin malt and grain of rice or corn. Taste is mostly watered down malt, corn, and rice with real no flavor. Barely sweet. Feel is water, thin, weak, empty, nothing, have a glass a water with a lemon. Very sorry I even tried it. What's A-B doing in Japan anyways, ruining more of their super awesome, and very old culture? Japan gives us nothing but the best in electronics and we give em A-B. For shame.","tavernjef","Apr 10, 2003"
1.78,-32.6,2,1.5,2,2,1.5,"Well, this is nothing I will ever drink again. It could have been a lot better and just a little bit worse. I paid nothing for it, so it was not a big deal. Very little flavor, and the flavor that is there is just a bit skunky with some graininess. Special Premium Reserve. That will have me laughing for ages.","ElGuapo","Mar 26, 2003"
2.13,-19.3,2.5,2,2,2,2.5,"Can't say I expected much out of this beer and it held up to that expectation. It poured very clear and golden with a very thin and quickly dissapating head. The smell was entirely pedestrian, almost like Budweiser. On contact, it has a sort of cereal taste and texture to it. I'm also noticing a little bit of a floral background. It finishes bitterly without much taste. This is not a great beer, basically a glorified Budweiser.","Hhawk06","Mar 16, 2003"
3.7,40.2,3,3,4,4,4,"Very light golden color here with a thin white head that fades quickly. There is almost no nose here with a barely detectable malt and hop scent that would be good if it had more presence. However, this is a surprisingly well balanced flavor of beer here. The hops and malt are very good with a minimal amount of room for improvement. There is also little to no aftertaste. This is not a great beer - but it will do.","AtrumAnimus","Feb 26, 2003"
3.92,48.5,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"Not a bad effort. The luxurious single wort (or first press) process yields a unique, complex flavor. With this gold label and ""Special Premium Reserve"" appellation, Ichiban outclasses and outperforms other japanese beers. 4.95% alcohol by volume. Don't be fooled -- this is a great beer that goes with anything especially sushi.","stoutman","Jan 20, 2003"

2.16,-18.2,3,2,2,2,2.5,"This was my first Asian beer and I was not impressed. Golden yellow in color with a small white head that didn't last. Smelled like wet, dirty corn. The flavor, what little there is, was metallic. I might have tasted a hint of hops in the end but I was probably digging. Overall, don't bother. Blah, no flavor.","CharlesRiver","Dec 29, 2002"
2.31,-12.5,3,2,2,2.5,3,"Golden color, light in everyway. Thin taste, thin body, thin aroma. What little aroma it has, it just smells like beer. I guess saying that this has a malt dominated nose is a more flattering way to say that, but with something as devoid of character as this, I would never think to flatter this beer. As the previous advocate, so correctly described this beer as One Dimensional. I would also say this beer is exceedingly boring, which is how most Japanese brews are. There is however a pleasant bitterness to this beer which is why I am giving this beer such a high rating depsite its defects.","Naerhu","Dec 28, 2002"
2.26,-14.4,3,2,2,2,3,"The beer has the typical lager/pils color, a cloudless golden straw, with a pertinent white head and adequate lace. Malt dominates the nose, the start lightly sweet, the top skinny in feel, with a bitingly acidic finish, the hops detectable, dry aftertaste. Is it me or all these beers ""One Dimensional", I've tasted dozens of Pacific Rim Beers, and the only difference is the label, or is it that I'm and ""Anti-Lager"" Snob?","Gusler","Dec 20, 2002"
2.38,-9.8,2.5,2,2.5,2.5,2.5,"Pours a medium gold with a small head that resembles dishwashing soap lather.  Lots of fat bubbles rise to the surface quickly but fail to sustain the head, although the lace is decent.  A striking resemblance to Budweiser, as others have noted.  Aroma is mildly skunky and sulphurous, with cooked vegetables as well.  Taste begins with a lot of carbonation sting and a little malt, turns slightly sweet towards the middle.  Finish is rather bitter, but the bitterness seems contrived and artificial.  In all fairness, this beer is not awful, but is lacking in character.  Packaged in a 22-ounce can, shelved with and probably competing against malt liquors.","Pegasus","Nov 13, 2002"
2.05,-22.3,3.5,1,2.5,3,1.5,"The taste is really not that bad.....Not sure....the aroma maybe clouding my judgement.","Shiloh","Nov 12, 2002"
1.78,-32.6,2,1.5,2,2,1.5,"The draught version was better, which isn't really saying much. Tastes like what it is, A-B's version of an Asian lager. Stale and bitter flavor. Very little body or texture. Blah.","Dogbrick","Nov 07, 2002"
2.15,-18.6,1.5,1.5,2,3,3,"Brewed by Bud, and guess what taste like Bud. This is not a dry beer, it leaves an aftertaste on your tongue that you will try to scrap off. This beer taste like it smells, so do yourself a favor smell it first, I'm sure you will go no further. Wish I could say more on the flavor characteristics, but I don't know what the hell they were.","boblinneman","Oct 12, 2002"
2.25,-14.8,2.5,2.5,2,2,2.5,"Well when a friend brought this over my house, I said Wow a japanese beer that I have never tasted before.  While reading the label I see ""brewed under the strict supervision of Kirins brewmaster by Anheuser-Busch, Inc.""  I said what the hell, oh well I will give it a shot.  Pourd a non-existent head that leaves a nice lace behind.  The light color leads me to understand the brewer.  The taste is like a high-end Bud.  No hops and very little malt.  Not a very good choice on my friends part but I will allow him back in house with a different kind of beer.","kunzbrew","Oct 10, 2002"
2.16,-18.2,2.5,1.5,2,2.5,3,"I ordered this beer in a Japanese Tebanyaki Steak house.  I figured I would have a Japanese beer (I didn't know until I read the label it was brewed by AB).  I was disappointed by this beer.  It was pale in color (looked like a macro) and just didn't have much flavor.  It did remind me a little of other imported lager's like Heineken or Amstel, but it's not quite on their level (and that's not saying much).  I did however enjoy the meal so much that it didn't even matter that I had an uninteristing beer, and in fact it did go well with the meal (in that it knew better than to get in the way!).","JeffreyG","Aug 19, 2002"

2.8,6.1,3,3,2.5,3,3,"Free leftovers.....This reminded me alot of the ol Michelob light, which I used to drink, before I saw the light at the end of the beer aisle. Pale yellow straw color, with some light head. Nothing real outstanding on the nose. Taste was thin, not much, very thin and watery. Some crispness to it, but mostly watered down malt flavors. The first of the Japanese beers, I have had. Although I was probably prejudiced, since it is owned by AB.","StevieW","Jun 06, 2002"
1.76,-33.3,2,1,2,2,2,"Not as good as Sapporo.  I thought the waiter had brought me a Bud light.  But no, it was better.  As I ate tons of spicey dishes, this beer seemed to dissapear, leaving just enough alcohol behind to cool down the heat.","AaronRed","Nov 16, 2001"
2,-24.2,2,2,2,2,2,"I think this is supposed to be a premium version of Kirin lager.  I didn't try them side-by-side, but I'm not sure I could tell any difference.","Brent","Aug 16, 2001"
