"I Pop!ped the cap and initiated a very gentle pour because I did not want to rouse any lees that may have settled on the punt of the bottle. The lack of discernible head simply meant that I had to employ the bartender's trick, netting me two fingers of tawny head that appeared briefly and fell, leaving good lacing in its wake. Color was Deep Amber/Light Copper to Copper (SRM = > 13, "
"Loved this and want more beer camps."
"Overall it's slightly more chalky as I sip but easy to quaff back. Quite good!"

"If available in a six pack I'd buy one."

"Taste-Up-front citrus hops,toasted malt, creamy, lingering bitterness to the finish. Nicely balanced and a nice match for a spicy food pairing"

"Edit: This does hide it's 8.5% ABV very well."

"Mouthfeel is light, crisp and on the thin side, with below average carbonation and the aforementioned dry, clean finish. This was good and easy to drink, but it let me down a little as it started off strong but finished lazy, for a lack of better word. Could easily be a session beer if it amped up the hops more since it hid the ABV masterfully."

"Interesting beer.  Might be a little too rich to imbibe several at a sitting and the I think winter is not the season, this feels more like a hot summer day enjoying being outside."

"10/30...BCAA 3/12...pours bright copper with high foam, leaving a sticky layer clinging to the edges. Sunny floral nose, fruity, fresh meadows. Clean crisp taste with a tight bitter hop back. More bitter and grapefruit as progressed."

"Another mediocre offering, has a nice flavor profile. Really just lacks complexity and substance. Enjoyable also rather forgettable~"

"Overall:  The last of Beer Camp to review.  Out of the whole 12 pack, this is one of my favorites.   Hope to get a few more pints."

"Interesting and enjoyable."
"I forgot I had one more Beer Camp Across America pack, finally cracked it open this past week. First time drinking Electric Ray, a collab IPL between Sierra Nevada and Balllast Point. The beer is an orangish copper color, not quite clear with one finger of fluffy eggshell colored head. Very nice retention and lacing. Aroma is somewhat muted, which is not surprising considering it's age. I do get some faint bready notes, along with a whiff of citrus. The taste is pretty malty up front, but I get some nice grapefruit and slight pineapple in the finish. The mouthfeel was pretty light, with just a touch of carbonation. Overall, this was a dang good beer considering it is probably well past it's prime. Sadly, I didn't get to taste one of these fresh (shared the other Beer Camp boxes), I'm thinking it was pretty good when fresh."

"Piney and bitter up front with faint fruit presence on the finish. Standard but, solid."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"4.00 | 90 | B+"
""
""
"O - A tasty brew for sure"
""
""
"Pours a golden honey color, aroma is very faint of malt, no smell of hops. Almost smells like nothing. Thick white head, guiness like consistency. Tastes floral with a hint of hops. Not bad, a good collaboration from Sierra Nevada and ballast point."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- This is a little too sweet for me to consider it a great lager. I'd like it to be more crisp and a cleaner drink. The sweetness really sticks, especially with the existence extra hops."

"I am drinking the beer at just over two months old. It has a floral, citrusy hop nose over light grains with a slight sweetness but does not smell like 70 IBU (international Bittering Units – a measure of bitterness). It pours brilliant amber with a light copper tint under a 1” snow white persistent foam cap. Electric Ray starts very creamy on the tongue, slightly sweet with clean light malt flavors supporting citrusy, floral hops finishing dry with a touch of astringency from the hops.  Electric Ray has the lager cleanness and smoothness but it has bigger malt and a much bigger hop flavor and aroma. The body is bigger than a lager without being fat or flabby. The carbonation is creamy, fine and soft. Everything is very well balanced."
"Pours golden orange with a medium white lasting head. Aroma is sweet fruity, yeast, grains and grass notes. Taste is grains and grass flavors, yeast upfront with some good amount of sweet fruity candied sugar and alcohol on the end. Palate is a med to full body, good carbonation. Finish is grains, yeast, malt sweet candied sugar on the end with moderate bitterness. Overall considering the alcohol content of 8.5, it wasn’t too overwhelming, simply drink slowly, a good drinking brew."

"A beautiful active swirling pour yields a full fingers worth of fluffy crisp slightly off-white colored head...  The color is a slightly pale medium gold...  Loaded with medium paced carbonation...  Gobs of lacing cling to the sides of the glass...  A bright vibrant aroma that can be detected even without bringing one's nose to the glass...  A nice sturdy hop presence sits atop a base of cracker and biscuit...  Excellent balance...  The flavor is as expected based on the nose...  A good mostly piney hop bite...  Lemon zest...  A strong graham cracker and biscuit malts base...  On the fuller side of medium bodied...  Sturdy and slightly chewy...  Brisk and vibrant carbonation...  An outstanding beer all around that I would indulge in with regularity if this were a year round offering...  Very nicely done...  Kudos to both Sierra Nevada and Ballast Point... By far my favorite of the Beer Camp Across America to date (though I still have a couple to go)..."

"O:  good pilsner.  Hoppy.  More hop than not."
"Mouthfeel is malty sweet at first then lightly bitter on the finish, bitterness is stronger than most hoppy bocks"

"So far the Beer Camp series is 4/4 in my book. No the beers have not been game-changing but if you consider the logistics of the whole box and read what they were going for in each beer they are solid brews."
"O-decent collaboration, would prefer it to be a little lighter in ABV and body"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Copper body with a thick white head. Aromas of pine, alcohol, caramel malt, bread. Zippy carbonation with a bitter finish. A balance of hops and malt, with lingering pine and subtle earth tones. Mediocre."
""
""
""
"dark golden color, mostly clear.  head is thin and white in color.  the aroma is strong of citrus fruits and herbal flowery flavors.   bready malt and strong bitter hop flavors, finishing dry.   thinner body, medium carbonation level."
""
"Pours a clear golden color with a finger width foamy head.  Head retention and lacing are minimal.  Aroma consists of citrus, apples and some floral notes.  Malty taste up front with a grassy hop bitterness at the end.  Bitter apple aftertaste.  The hoppiness is strong and not quite smooth.  There could be a better transition from the malts to the hops.  It is still an enjoyable beer, though."
""
"Love Ballast point and this one was amazing as expected.  A lot of hops and very nice citrus tastes with a smooth pine finish."
""
""
""
"O - Very good combination of full flavor and maximum drinkability. One of the better brews from the Beer Camp 12 pack."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall:  I am almost always disappointed by Imperial hoppy lagers whether they be Imperial Pilsners or IIPLs and this is no exception, with the overwhelming sweetness in the malt bill competing with the hops and masking the crisp finish that might otherwise be appealing in a lager"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Excellent beer. Very hoppy and refreshing. I'd buy a six pack of these."
""
""
"O: I can understand where they might have been trying to go with this (a stronger IPA but not an IPA),  but I think they missed the mark when they decided to make it as high in alcohol as it is. For me, a lower % and a lighter more balanced body would have made this one shine. It's not terrible, but it could have been better."
"Pretty citrusy with an oily texture.  Not what I was expecting, but not bad either."
"Love this."
""
"This statement should not surprise anyone (myself included), but this reminds me of Torpedo. The hop profile is similar, except this is more bitter. This is supposedly a lager, but it really feels like an IPA (not just because it is hoppy - it really has the mouthfeel of a pale ale). Regardless, this is the best-tasting thing I've had from the Beer Camp pack so far."
""
""
""
"Not sure about this one. Damn near tastes like it was brewed with lime peels or something."
""
"D:  Drinkability is off the charts with this one.  Its light, crisp, and refreshingly hoppy.  Easily one of top picks from the pack with such fine balance.  Could easily crush cans of this one on the regular.  Please make it so."
"Bottle: Poured a bright yellow color lager with a nice white foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma consists of nice light cereal notes with plenty of floral and dry hoppy notes with a touch of citrus hops. Taste is also dominated by clean cereal notes with some nice flora and dry hoppy notes with some citrus notes also noticeable. Body is about average for style with good carbonation. What more can you ask than a crisp lager with a nice hoppy finish and great drinkability."
""
""
""
""
""
"Easily achievable 2 inch head with a strong pour.  Head is off white in tone.  Body is a deep golden straw color.  Nose is faint but does highlight rustic hops that are on the woodsy side.  Lager malts are really bold and totally overpower the hops as a whole.  The hop profile is rather piney and grassy.  Really a bold rustic feel as described in the nose.  Mouthfeel is dry and accompanied by a dirty bitter profile.  Overall quite easy to drink and a sold brew."
""
""
""
""
"This was one of the more enjoyable Beer Camp collabs I have had."
""
""
""
""
"This beer is well balanced and is really good."
"This might be my favorite of the Beer Camp Across America pack. Well done."
"Overall: A sparkling and bright tasting hoppy beer.  The lager character contributes to the clean crispness, but the yeast throws me off a bit.  I like this a lot but I'd rather drink a Ballast Point Palate Wrecker!"
""
" The taste has a good mix of citrus with light caramel in the malt and subtle pineapple and gentle mango mix of hop flavor with light yeast tanginess with mild citrus -tangerine and herbal hops stand out as the finish is mostly dry. Very good India Pale lager was sufficiently hoppy with lots of flavor and only mild sweetness -pretty smooth as far as bitterness goes, very drinkable"
""
""
""
"I've really been looking forward to trying this collaboration between Sierra Nevada and Ballast Point. Served from a 12 oz. bottle this beer is a pale slightly amber gold. It has a decent head with good retention that leaves moderate lacing. Aroma is full-bodied with big orange and pine notes right up front.  Taste continues with bold hop and citrus presence as well as a nice alcohol wallop lurking in the background. Not especially surprising from an 8.5 % ABV brew categorized as an imperial pale lager. Mouthfeel is a little thinner than I expected, but still pretty decent with a level of carbonation that is not overwhelming. This is a potent brew with plenty of hops as I would expect from these two breweries, but definitely not to be classified as sessionable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Lightly crisp from start to finish with some drying late. Easy to consume despite higher ABV."
"Eh.  Nothing really separates this from several dozen other big IPAs.  Worth drinking, but I was kinda hoping for more."
""
""
""
""
""
"Ok. now on to the more important stuff - taste.  Love love it.  Nice lingering aftertaste with a carryover of the bitterness that first hits.  No shortness of malt - all in all my favorite of this year's offering so far.  If they made this in a year round offering I'd put it right next to my Dirt Wolf 7 Gubna!"
"O: No flaws just not much stands out"

"Despite the high abv, this still feels like a crisp, light lager,.  Nothing exception but a nice light refreshing beer that just happens to have a higher alcohol content."
"Pours a copper color with a short lived white head.  Aroma of hops and malt sweetness, lager yeast, just like a hoppy ale but perhaps more bready.  The taste is big on piney hop bitterness, nice and earthy, standing up to a fair to strong toffee like malt sweetness but with crispness of a lager.  Nice bitterness.  Full bodied for a lager, but not a bad thing.  Good strong carbonation on this one.  Overall, a pretty awesome lager from the Beer Camp Collaborations.  I'd get this again some time."
""

"O-A decent beer, especially for a style I'm not big on."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"o; A very pleasant IPL,. Although darker in color and heavier in body than most lagers I have had, the solid malt base well balances the hops to make an enjoyable and refreshing yet substantial brew."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I really enjoyed this.  I like the crisp lager feel and finish, with a nice sweet, malty flavor present as well. I know this opinion is probably not popular, but I like the malty presence of the Beer Camp beers that I've tried thus far."
""
"O:  A smooth, sessionable brew.  I really enjoyed this one. (3.9)"
""
""
"Overall: Great IPL, could have used more aroma but everything else was spot on (4.20)"
""
""
"Lemony, fruity hops hit the nose with a bit of rind, pith, pine and resin. The flavor is an interesting array of divergent flavors. I get honey, tea leaves, caramel, lime, lemon, toffee, molasses, seltzer and some cracker or barley. The complexity is fantastic but it's served in a rather thin and light package. Quite good but very thin this is yet another fine addition to Beer Camp."
""
""
""
""

"A fairly bland IPL.  Needs more malt body imo."

"Overall - Decent, but very malty."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A solid IPL with great hop-forward notes that work nicely with the lager yeast and maltiness. A bit more of a sipper because it's approaching 9% and is certainly hop-forward. A highlight of the 12-pack"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Interesting India Pale Lager that is very drinkable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A very solid take on a IPL. Good mix of upfront hop notes with a nice lager backing."
""
""
""
"Overall – A rather tasty double IPA overall. A decent level of dryness and crispness with a good level of flavor and a nice malt, sweet, and hop profile. Overall a rather nice drinking double IPA."

"Overall, nice enough, and definitely hoppy, but it doesn't really hit my preferred flavor notes."
""
"Not exactly drinkable, unless you're chugging one to get ready for Friday night, just sweet as sin with a hoppy, woody flavor. Lots of wood, resins, and something that makes me think of eucalyptus. From the 12 oz bottle purchased in San Diego in the 2014 Beer Camp 12-pack."

"There are a lot of aspects to this beer that I really like. Firstly, it has wonderful aromas of citrus and pine with a slight tropical note. It also looks so nice when poured with a thick frothy head and a light amber body. My first taste threw me off a little but that is just because I don't drink many IPLs'. It still has a very solid and bright taste due to the hops. However, it finishes with a classic malt flavor that adds some depth to it. Overall, its a great beer!"
""
"Overall bleh, you call this a lager?! This has no lager qualities at all, malt profile is meh, hops are even more meh, barely even enjoyable. This is a kinda beer that seems like a noob slapped together random hops and malts to make this beer."

"O: A nice ""IPL"" from Ballast & SN. Would drink again if i saw it on tap somewhere"
""
""
""
""
"The body was smooth and reasonably full, which was something of a surprise given the lack of malt on the palate. Drinkability was nice, but the bitter finish was a bit unpleasant. Overall, a nice enough brew, but like others from this box, it's one-and-done for me."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is easily the best of the bunch through the first third of the box. Subtle yet assertive, somehow dry while leaving the impression of sweetness. This is what an IPL should be like in my opinion. I would likely buy this one as a regular offering."
"O: Damn good and worth a try if you can get Beer Camp this year."
"Sam Adams Perfect Pint glass poured straight down the middle. Huge head. Good carbonation. Nice golden straw color. Smell is very light but clean and refreshing. Some grassy and light floral hop is present. Beer is well crafted but the taste is not desirable to me. It seems just light and bland with a balance and light mouth-feel. Alcohol is very well hidden. A second sip and smell brings the hoppiness into play. Now getting some resin and pine but still it tastes at the finish not so desirable. Once finished the glass is smothered in beautiful lace. Probably would not buy this again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"o: Good stuff."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The mouthfeel is moderate carbonation on a moderate body. However, the feel feels foamy instead of smooth, and feels a little off. Overall, an okay collaboration, and worth getting once."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, it's a bit overly sweet and I don't care for the hop character."
""
""
""
""
"D: this is really good and drinks super easy. only had a few of the variety brews thus far, but this is definitely high up on my list."
""
""
""
"O: a nice hop-forward beer from the Beer Camp box - doesn't quite deliver the way I'd expected - presents a good beer but nothing particularly noteworthy with so many similar beers out there"
""
"Part of the Beer Camp compilation. Collaboration between Sierra Nevada and Ballast Point. Pours a clear dark golden color with plenty of white froth. Some bright piney/citrus hop notes on the nose. IPL is a strange breed. I thoroughly enjoy the hops on this guy but like most IPLs, the super hoppy lager is just odd. Nice carmely malts with that very forward citrus hop presence. Light mouthfeel, not bad overall but I don't think I would drink a lot of these. Something just isn't harmonious here but it's hard to put my finger on it."
""
"Aroma of green citric hops and a faint whiff of ethanol along with some muddled light caramel notes. Taste is smooth and similar in nature, bit of spritzy citrus up front, lightly 'oily' in the middle and finishing with a brief linger of hop spice. Firm in feel and lightly coarse in nature yet creamy at the same time given the hop balance. Warming brings forth more robust and resinous hop notes and a fuller less oily feel. Smoooth and easy. The initial waft of ethanol is now masked by the hop charge. I suspect we'll be seeing this one again. Nicely done."
""
""
""
""
""
" Yep I would like to see this brewed up as maybe a seasonal offering, and hopefully other reviews will see this point and agree, and they do it. Very drinkable."
""
""
"Split with my buddy in a sierra nevada tulip and ipa glass. Great transparent orange yellow with nice head spotty lace. Nose had a real nice tropical thing going on, the Fruit carries into the taste. Super refreshing and tasty brew. Prob my fav so far in the set. Best of the hoppy brews for me."
"O: This beer has the hoppy flavors you would expect from an IPL and finishes very clean."

"o: i was trying to compare this with Fathom originally. if i were to do that, Fathom would win. but on its own this can stand pretty well. my 'issue' is that it feels a little too much like a DIPA. i like the clean taste the lager yeast provides, but this is a little heavier than that. on its own though, its tasty. very dangerous too at >8%"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I'm really falling in love with hoppy pilsners, because they are far and few between but are a still hoppy but just different enough to break up all the IPAs."
""

"12 ounce bottle into lager glass, bottled on 6/3/2014. Pours crystal clear deep gold color with a 1-2 finger dense and rocky off white head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of grapefruit, mango, pineapple, lemon zest, orange peel, floral, grass, light pine, light caramel, bread, and floral/grassy earthiness. Very nice aromas with good complexity and balance of bright citrus/tropical hops and moderate malt sweetness; with good strength. Taste of big grapefruit, mango, pineapple, lemon zest, orange peel, floral, grass, light pine, light caramel, bread, and floral/grassy earthiness. Good amount of pine/grassy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of grapefruit, pineapple, mango, lemon/orange zest, floral, grass, light pine, light caramel, bread, and floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice complexity and balance of bright citrus/tropical hops and moderate malt sweetness; with a nice malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth, crisp, and lightly creamy/sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very nice IPL style. All around good complexity and balance of bright citrus/tropical hops and moderate malt sweetness; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A very enjoyable offering."
""
""
""
""
""
"The Verdict: It’s good. Not very well balanced for an IPL, and the hop bitterness feels over the top without any corresponding depth of flavor to my tongue. Stone fans will probably love this one. The flavor does improve as it warms."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured into a large tulip for review. Pours clear copper color with large whit head. Lacing clings to glass walls. Smells a lot like Torpedo. Citrus hops, like Citra, dominate the profile. A little pine and hop resin. Tastes clean with pronounced hop flavors. Lemon and citrus with a semi-sweet malt profile. Feels medium light with crisp bitterness and easy drinking quality. Nicely done."
""
""
""

"Overall, I enjoyed this beer and would buy this if offered on its own. Definitely one of the top Beer Camp beers."

"12oz bottle. Pours a bright amber color with a 1/4 inch of head. Lots of lacing. The aroma is sweet citrus and floral hops. Light breadiness. The taste is grapefruit, resin, and floral hops. Some doughy/bready flavor as well. Lots of flowery hops. Finishes with more of the sweet grapefruit and floral hops. Hints of honey and lemon. Light mouthfeel. Slightly oily. Flavorful yet a tad on the lighter side. I am absolutely shocked this beer is 8.5%. Dangerously drinkable and tasty. Overall, one of the best of the pack. Hoping this gets made again."

"DELIGHTFUL; WORTH A TRY!"
""
""
""
"O: There's shades of Nugget Nectar in this one, particularly in how the hops are featured. Upon further research, the mystery ingredient I couldn't pin was oats. That definitely explains the nice body, but I did find the earthy/starchiness to be a bit distracting in both taste and smell. Not enough to undermine a solid effort though. This was still a satisfying brew."

"Overall - A good, flavorful, and sweet ipa. A little much for all the citric notes, the malts and added spices. Still, easy to drink but I don't think id want too many of these in one session."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - This would be a good beer for Halloween in a candy corn kind of way. It's sweet, easy to drink and has a big orange flavor. There's enough hop bitterness to provide some balance. While I enjoyed this beer, it is too sweet and not complex enough for me to make it a regular (if that were even possible)."
""
"A good but not stellar take on the style. Hopped like a pro, which is expected and appreciated."
"Overall this really started off well, but the beer just comes off too boozy and it really seems to destroy much of its hinting impressive quality you think is coming."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Its crisp and malty-dry finish is creamy, light and and of wafer-thin bread with an unmasking grain bite. Piquant in its lingering bitterness, a tangy wine, juniper and spruce character leaves lasting impressions."
""
""
"Pours a nice medium amber-ish gold color. The liquid has excellent clarity. Fine bubbles in the head, which is pure white. There’s a little bit of lacing and the head has ok retention for a lager. The aroma is sweet with malt and hops. The malt is honey with light caramel. Rather sugary. Floral, pine and citrus hoppiness. Citrus is probably the strongest of the three. Mostly grapefruit. It smells like pine needles and grapefruit rind in honey with a dose of lager yeastiness. The taste is similarly on the sweet side. The beer dries out some in the finish, but it’s a bit too big for its own good, in my opinion. There’s a fair bit of malt character, more of that sweet honeyed grain flavor. Citrus and pine hop character with only moderate bitterness. Some booze. Very nice mouthfeel. Light on the palate for the abv. Fairly easy to drink. Almost crisp. Some hop oiliness. I just think the sweetness and booze creeps in a bit too much, particularly if you let it warm up at all."

"O: This is an enjoyable hop-forward lager and definitely one that I would gladly have again, I wish I came across more quality IPLs. There is a slightly present alcohol to this beer but it seems to fade as the beer warms up. Very easy to drink."
""
""
""
""
"O: a fine IPL worth seeking out. More balanced than an average American IPA, this may lack the hop hit desired by some."

"O- Not a fan of how this one was done. For one thing, it might as well be an IPA with a lot of bittering hops. I don't get as much of that characteristic crisp breadiness that comes with lagers, it simply gets boozy as it warms and the hops altogether seem to be solely for bittering. I'd like more contribution to aroma rather than just plain bitterness. That being said, it's not horrible, just not good."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, I’m a west coast IPA/IPL fanboy and this is why…these guys have mastered the use of hops!"
""
""
"Clean maltiness with a striking bitterness. Dried citrus and floral qualities. It's aiiiiggghhttt."
"An easy drinking beer in the mix of some that are more out there. The appearance was dark yellow with a good head. The smell was mostly hops but had some toasted malt and fruit smells. The taste was straightforward with a mellow beginning and a crisp finish with a bit of bitterness from the hops. The mouthfeel was nice for the summer. Very enjoyable."
""
""
""
"Overall: Well brewed, high gravity lager. I would like more hop presence to combat the alcohol. I also don't get a lot of hop flavor."

"Fantastic tropical fruit brew... nobody does hops like Ballast Point. Lovely caramel colored brew with minimal lacing, tight malt balance and the hops... my god... the hops. This is the best of the beer camp brews I've had so far. Creamy and balanced, brilliant mouthfeel. Yum."
"12oz. bottle served in a shaker pint. Pours a dull orange hue with a translucent clarity and a sizzling, half-inch, bright white head that settles into a consistent skim. Nose is very subdued - citrus zest and a trace of floral hoppiness. Taste reveals a spiciness upfront, followed by more citrus zest and floral hops that leave a residual bite at the finish. Mouthfeel is light in body with a bright carbonation and some astringency that lightly stimulates the sides of the cheeks and the tongue. A decent IPL, but I don't love the hops profile (Hoponius Union has spoiled me)."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Solid beer overall. The aroma is a bit lacking, but the flavor is solid. Not my favorite from Beer Camp Across America, but it's worth a try."
"I'm not a lager lover, generally, and I wish the fruity hop character were more pronounced. Fairly drinkable, but not really my cup of tea."
""
""
"Overall a decent well crafted beer, but it left me disappointed, no wow factor for me."
""
""
""
""
"The flavor starts out with toasted biscuit malts and then the earthy hops erupt and take it over to the bitter finish. This is not floral, grassy, or flowery but it is definitely earthy. Another nice beer from this Beer Camp 2014 set."
""
""
"Taste is very sharp and hoppy with a solid caramel malt back one for support. Body is heavy, for sure, not obscuring the heavy alcohol content here (8.5%). Tasty but definitely a sipper."
""
""
""
""
""
"Let's read the label, alright? ""This nautically named India Pale Lager combines intense citrusy, floral American hops with the clean, classic malt body of a blonde lager."" Also, this: ""As ever, San Diego's Ballast Point looked to the sea for inspiration. A play on the fish's scientific name--Torpedo californica--Electric Ray pays homage to our Hop Torpedo, the source of much of this beer's big flavor. It's massive grapefruit and floral notes deliver a high-voltage hit of hop flavor."""
""
"Poured on-tap at a Beer Camp tap takeover, the beer was served in a shaker pint. The beer is a bright, hazy, golden-copper coloring with a light, clingy, bright white head. Nose of grapefruit, subtle caramel, lemon, and grassy notes. Flavors are resinous and grapefruit forward, with a subtle pine and grassy blend to highlight. Very hoppy, with a subtle toasted grain backbone. Smooth and light in mouth, with a grassy, hoppy, bitter aftertaste. The finish is bitter, slightly dry, with a hop-heavy linger. This is one of my favorites out of the bunch."
""
""
"Overall- It's damn good. A unique beer somewhere between an IPA, barleywine and an altbier or something else malt forward."

"Overall: Wow, I cannot remember ever drinking such a potent India Pale Lager (maybe DFH's My Antonia? No, I don't think so.) I feel like I'm drinking a Torpedo/Hoptimum/possibly even Sculpin recipe fermented with a lager yeast (although you would never know). Tastes like a standard DIPA to me."
"O- Not having much on the nose and a lack of balance to mask the alcohol hurt the beer for me personally. A decent brew, certainly not my favorite beer in the world but worth trying!"
""
"O. A very good IPL. It has a bright, effervescent bouquet and flavor profile. Very citrus heavy, mostly mango and pineapple. The finish is drying with that classic pilsner type feel. The only complaint is that it is a touch too sweet, in my opinion. That certainly doesn't make it bad, though. Seek and enjoy."
""
""
""
"Overall: drinkable and tasty, this is an interesting beer. There's a very slight homebrew-tasting element to the hops, but maybe that's just my own palate making assumptions. Otherwise, it's dangerously drinkable for its strength -- I could find myself accidentally quite wrecked on this stuff."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - This could have been very, very good with a better hop profile. The miss was the lack of citrus notes in the taste. The nose was terribly weak as well. I enjoyed this one but it could have been so much better."
""
""
""
"The flavor has a rounded hop character, with just enough malt on it to let it shine. There's a drying finish as well. Another enjoyable one. The second bottle I tried was even more delightful than the first."

"Pours a barely foggy amber. Minimal head. Bland nose. Beer seemed thick, syrupy, and off the mark at first. Thankfully things get back on track fairly quickly. The hops start to show through in a decently spiced way. The body still retains a degree of syrupy thickness, which continues to be a detractor for me, to be honest. But what is there is still a pretty nice drinker. I still liked the previous two better than this one though."

"Overall this is excellent, I hope the rest of the 12 pack is half as good as this!"

"12 ounce bottle, part of the Beer Camp Across America 12-pack. Served in a Sam Adams Boston Lager glass, the beer pours a mostly clear golden/amber color with an inch frothy off-white head that stayed around for a long time. There's a decent amount of lacing. The brew smells like floral and citrusy (grapefruit, tropical fruit) hops, and some caramel and bready malt. I think the taste is just like the aroma, it's all floral/citrus hops and caramel/bready malt. There's a nice bitter hoppy finish. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, it's a bit slick and creamy and is well carbonated. Overall I thought it was a solid brew, but unfortunately I liked it less the longer I drank it."
""
""
""
""
"Pours into a becker a deep orange hued medium golden with a great looking full two finger bone white head that settles very slowly,just a great head with a slower pour.Caramel and sweet dough with a little booze mixed with some piney hops in the back end,Iam a little surprised by the extent of the booziness.Flavors of sweet dough and more booze with some cutting spicy and piney hops in the finish.I like it,it's a little sweeter than most for the style but I like it just the same."

"As a ballast point fan this was one of the reasons I bought the mix pack. I was a little let down. Nice coppery orange color. Decent head that lacked retention. Real nice nose. Smells like good weed. Malty taste underscored with hops. I can taste the booze but theres no burn. Medium body. Solid one off, but not the best ballast point beer."
"Overall (4.25): Not everything is perfect about this beer, but it’s goddamn solid in pretty much every single regard. I’d rank this up there with the best IPLs out there, personally, and it’s awesome to see Sierra Nevada (granted, with Ballast Point in tow) nail a lager. If only this could be a regular release . . . excellent, as expected."
"O: I’m not sure what was going on in this one but I wasn’t a fan. The hop varieties didn’t work for me or something."
"Big chunky foam kicks up over a golden beer. Sticky clumps of lace cling to the glass. Attractive. Smells of citrus pith and pine resin and a hint of hay. Pretty classic. Taste is moderately bitter, citrusy grapefruit pith to a bit puckering, the malt is pretty minimal so the hop oils are rather intense almost coming off as garlic or oniony at times. Body is medium. Mouthfeel is average. Good experiment but not something I'd buy again."
""
""

"Alright beer number 2 out of the pack. I love Ballast Point, its one of my favorite breweries right now. This beer is about like its cousin Fathom. I understand this is a collaboration but Sierra Nevada is doing this to bring what the individual breweries in the pack do. Showcasing them, if you will. This is not Ballast Point's best effort, but it is much better than the first one I tried from the much lauded Three Floyd's. This is a hoppy lager. Its a fine beer. The aroma is there but if you look at reviews (including my own about Fathom) you will get a pretty good picture of what this beer is all about. The only difference is that this one is a bit more boozy than Fathom. Its a solid beer but I am hoping there is a knock your socks off one coming soon! Russian River I am looking you dead in the eyes!"

"appearance: hazy honey colored, orange tint. 2 finger head, quickly diminished. smell: gingery? some sort of spiciness, mixed with citrus. taste: overwhelmingly grapefruit at first sip. white floral lingers after a couple tastes. mouthfeel: smooth with a burst of tart flavor (again, because of the grapefruit). overall, we're feeling some brunch vibes. would buy again."

"Overall - fantastic beer. Ballast has some great beers and this one proves it once again!"

"This is a clear copper beer with a tiny initial head that fades very quickly. The nose offers an abundance of piney hop scent, with a little malt sweetness. The flavor is quite bitter, lots of typical American-hop flavor, good malt balance--actually it's hard to write this review because there's nothing special about this beer. It's a generic IPA with a lager yeast, which does little to make it stand out. It's basically the same as a thousand other IPAs I've had in the past."

"Overall: I have never been that impressed with Imperial/Double Lagers/Pilsners or India Pale Lagers. This is kind of a cross between those two, but it is a slam dunk. I love this beer and it shows that extreme lagers can work."

"possibly my favorite from the box so far, love me some ballast point, and love me some ipl. this is excellent, blonde and hoppy, well carbonated, biscuity, insanely light for how strong it is alcoholically, and just a supremely well made beer overall that makes the box almost worth it regardless of the other eleven beers. i thought so anyway. looks dead sexy in a teku glass, with a nice white ring on top and rising bubbles even time i flick the glass, active and clear. there is just enough pilsener type malt to give backbone for the muscular hops to be supported by, but they dont need much help here. this is the hoppiest beer in the box ive had (im about seven beers into it). clean finishing, floral and still somehow delicate without being aggressively bitter or harsh in any way. i would never had known it was so strong either, aside from the buzz it amplified. a very nice example of the style, id love to see this one become a full time offering from either brewery, its that good."

"Pours a hazy honey orange with a foamy beige head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Thin streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, citrus fruit, and citrus zest aromas. Taste is much the same with citrus fruit and candied citrus zest flavors on the finish. There is a medium amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer with nice crisp citrus forward hop characteristics in both the smell and taste."
""
""
"Pours out a light copper body with a moderate head. Nose is clean yeast, soft caramel, and loads of citrus hops. Big on grapefruit. Flavor is very smooth. Yeast is really clean. Malts give a toasty caramel flavor. Middling sweetness. Hops are very oily: tons of grapefruit and a touch of orange blossom floral character. Mouthfeel is moderate to full with a creamy yet slightly prickly carbonation. Great beer. Wish it had a little less alcohol, but it's well hidden."
"12 oz fresh bottle pour, into mini pilsner glass, head is light in body with big bubbles, and a khaki froth staying around. color of the beer is between gold and chestnut brown. has decent amount of malt detected with a little roastiness. Not much on the nose, a little fruit such as apple and pine needles to bring in some earthiness. Taste is apple, pine, a little grapefruit, some malted notes such as cocoa and carmel to finish with the hops. Drinks a lot like a Maibock, with slightly more piney and citrusy notes in there. Mouthfeel is crisp and light, good for the Lager yeast style. Dry finish and very nice balance of fruitiness, and mildness of the yeast lends to a good mouthfeel and finish. Overall, should pair nice with some German foods, such as: Brats, Mustard, Veal, and Pretzel."
""
"Overall- An above average beer in my opinion but I can see why some would like it. It's an okay representation of the style- not that I have much to compare it to (it certainly isn't in the same league as Humulus Lager). If I were you, I would give it a shot though. But only if you like in your face hops."

""

"O- I have no problem with a hoppy lager. What I do have a problem with is imperial lagers that are lacking in malt body and that's what this is. The mouthfeel especially suffers in this attempt at a high gravity, highly hopped lager."

"O) A good start to this year's camp. I could see myself buying a sixer of this if it were available in that format. Now which one should I try next???"
"Feels crisp and clean with hoppy IPA properties, again a mild taste of citrus and grass clippings. Slightly resinous, with a lingering dry bitter aftertaste. Overall it's pretty drinkable, one of the better ones in the series in my opinion."

"Clear light copper colored pour with a white one-finger head and lots of carbonation. Big citrusy aroma. Really great flavor that has grapefruit upfront with just a touch of caramel. Medium body also has flavors of citrus, floral hops, and bread. Finishes dry with a very mild lingering floral hop bitterness. Very well done beer and can really tell it's a Sierra Nevada beer."
"Mouthfeel is thick and rich. Overall, quite good."

"Poured a clear amber orange with three fingers of fluffy white head that slowly receded to a ring of white that left abundant lacing down the glass. Quite the nice looking beer, more IPA or amber lager than golden lager. Scents of grassy hops, tropical fruits, sweet orange flesh, citrus zest, a hint of pine and faint notes of grainy malt. A very nice, crisp, clean hop-forward aroma that also has a nice malt balance. Quite appealing. Flavor begins balanced between sweet malt flavors, bitterness and hop character with notes of tropical fruit, grapefruit peel and pith and slight floral hops. This moves into a balanced middle with sweet malt mingling with flavors of melon, pine resin, and hints of alcohol with a moderate level of bitterness. Finish is similarly balanced though a bit more bitter, with notes of grapefruit pith and peel, floral hop notes, a bit of pine resin, a sweet malt backbone and a hint of alcohol. Aftertaste is bitter with. Toes of floral hops, pine resin, grapefruit peel and a slight bit of grainy malt. A very nice flavor profile, quite similar to an IPA with very little indication of the lagering making it through the hops and high ABV. Still quite nice and very balanced between a high level of bitterness and sweet malt, which lends the beer its moderate bitterness level overall and its complexity. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and smooth with low carbonation and a slightly silky feel. Very nice and quite easy to drink, masking its ABV nicely. Overall this is a good hoppy beer. It balances the hops and malt nicely in the flavor and has a pleasant aroma and mouthfeel that make it quite pleasant to drink. A good effort from two great breweries."

"Overall - IPA or IPL? Hard to tell as it's one of the heavier and more flavorful IPL's I've had to date... guess we'll have to take the brewers' word for it! In any event, it's pretty good, though frankly I see more Sierra Nevada influence in this beer than Ballast Point."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Interesting and enjoyable, the ABV is hidden but does creep up."
"Pours an almost clear light orange, thick dense cream colored head, a few rings of lace down the glass. Smell: resin, peach, grapefruit peel, biscuit and light caramel back. Taste: tangerine, resiny, light milk caramel, ripe peach. Medium bodied, citrusy and stone fruit finish. Pretty nice."
""
""
""
"Paired with Italian dinner. Not a fan of the IPL or IPA, but overall this isn't the worst I've had. Smell is sweet and flowery. Taste is not harsh, isn't giving that lock jaw effect. No lingering bitter on the back of the tongue. Appearance is a golden hue with some lace."
""
""
""
"O- Very solid beer to kick off the Beer Camp pack with. Very fruit forward with some unique notes of lime. Can't believe this is 8.5% ABV, no trace of alcohol warming or flavor at all."
"I liked this better as a sample on tap, but it's still very, very tasty. Quite different, likely, than what you might expect. A very good beer, perhaps a bit oversweet, but with nicely balanced bitterness and a hop profile that isn't overwhelming."
""
""
"Overall 4.25: Excellent beer. Great blending and balancing of over the top hops and malt. BIG (8.6%) ABV on this baby, so be careful driving your hovercrafts after drinking it. Would highly recommend and hope it somehow gets a life of its own after Beer Camp."

"Poured into a Seattle Beer Week pint glass. Pours a medium golden amber with a fine, one finger white head with great retention and lots of lacing. Interesting aroma of bready malt and a quite unusual hop component that is has grassy, floral, light citrus and honeydew melon characters, unique and enticing. Flavor is caramel and bready malts, with the same very nice hop blend of grassy, floral and melon family flavors. Almost a potpourri taste that kept me coming back for more tastes. Medium bodied. I'm quite impressed by the hop flavors in this one. I'm familiar with both Sierra Nevada and Ballast Point hopped beers and this is nothing like either, an interesting and complex hopping. I think if this was a bit more floral, it could actually get cloying, but I did not get tired of tasting this. If this went into production, it would be on my rotation list. I seem to like this more than most reviewers, but this one really hit all the buttons for me. Very nice."
