"O:  i'm both in love and disappointed by this one. there's not enough malty sweetness or bread flavor typical of the Old World lager, so that sucks, yet the lager qualities are undeniable -- in the look and feel mainly.  a truly unique brew and if nothing else, it's so well made that whatever my personal tastes, it's making me want to try more Hops & Grain brews.  the average American craft beer drinker will LOVE this brew."

"I enjoyed a recently brewed Hops & Grain The One They Call Zoe, a pale lager. Hops & Grain is  small brewery in Austin. Zoe is 5.2% abv, and has a deeply golden color, on the edge of amber. The head is light and small, disappears quickly with a bit of lacing. The aroma was of orange blossoms, fresh and tangy. My first sip also struck a citrusy, slightly sweet but hoppy taste, with a mildly bitter finish that doesn't linger very long - clean and refreshing! Overall - deeelicious!"

"Overall: A nice canned lager - strikes a good balance between session drink ability and full, hoppy flavor."

"Overall just a very impressive lager, feels and tastes like spicy hop fruit punch more than it does beer."

"Pours golden colored with half a finger width foamy head. Only a small amount of lacing on the side. Aroma is that of tropical fruits and hops. Citrusy. Has a hint of apples as well. Malty taste with hints of citrusy tropical fruit up front, quickly followed by a grassy hoppy taste. You can discern that malty lager taste right at the end but only for a split second. Nice bitter aftertaste. I am generally not a fan of lagers, but this one definitely will do. Excellent beer. I wish it is more available at the Spec's near me."

"fun beer, was given a can that may have sat around awhile, maybe gotten warm, but it hasnt effected this beer much i cant imagine, it still seems fresh to me. big wheat and pale malt base, heavier for a lager, with some pretty solid hopping. tangerine or orange or something to them. pale hazy dense wheat beer color, yellow and orange, heady, bubbly. the nose has a lot more hops than the conventional lager, but without sacrificing grain character. the malt is fresh too, bready or crackery, with a touch of lady finger cakey sweetness. minimal bitterness and lots of hops on the finish, grassy and orange zesty. i thought all the body and the big carbonation was a nice feel for the flavors, they evolve together slowly, from malt to hops. a well flavored lager, anything but boring, but it lacks in the session department for me, a handful of these is plenty. my first beer from these guys though is enough to make me want more."

"A thanks to the creator of the canquest, woodychandler, for this beer. Poured from a 12 oz. can. Has a golden color with a 1 inch head. Smell is malty, a bit of lemons. Taste is lemony, malts, some grains, very easy drinking. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall the sum is greater than the parts, a good session beer."

"O: a great take on an otherwise regular lager, the dry-hopping adds more complexity and balance to the aromas and flavor profile. This one you'll definitely want to keep on drinking!"

"I am savoring this moment, which has been a long time in coming. It begins with a loud Crack!, revealing yet another brimful craft CAN, followed by an inverted Glug. I decided to wait a moment or so when some puffy foam began to extrude itself from within the CAN. Oooh, an active beer! When it showed no sign of relenting, I proceeded incautiously, resulting in ~ three fingers of dense, foamy, tawny head with good retention. Color was a cloudy orangish-yellow (SRM = > 7, < 9), suggesting that it was unfiltered. Good! Filtration only strips away flavor and I am not a fan. Nose had a nice, malty sweetness unencumbered by adjuncts. One of the unintended CANsequences of The CANQuest (TM) has been the number of AALs that I have had to CANsume, so I know from whence I speak. Mouthfeel was medium and the flavor was hoppier than the nose had led me to expect! It had a honey-malt flavor intermingled with a minty grassiness and if I had been asked to guess, I might have gone with a Czech Pils. Finish was semi-dry and quite refreshing. I might enjoy it more on a hot, humid summer's day than on a (literally) freezing cold morning like this one, hence school being closed. YMMV."

"Overall: I enjoyed this. Flavor could have been stronger, but I could definitely see myself drinking a lot of this. Very easy to drink, and for the price you really can't go wrong."
"What a treat, a real classy lady. The One They Call Zoe is a fantastically hopped lager with bright citrus and flowery esters, a truly bewitching arsenal of aromas. The palate lets the drinker down slightly, but remains an incredibly easy drinking experience. Calling a let down ""incredible"" should give one an idea of just how good this beer is, well done Hops & Grain!"

"Absolutely great job on this one, a truly fine pale lager and a top notch beer in all respects."

"Overall: I've been waiting to try Zoe for some time now and I am not disappointed. When I think of a lager, this will be my standard to measure with. Excellent aroma and flavor. There might be better out there, but this one pleases on all fronts."
""
"This one has become a staple in my fridge.... goes great with anything. I need to try the rest of their lineup. This beer is tremendous."
"o - overall, what a pleasant surprise this one was. wish i knew this was hoppy, would've jumped on it right away, but even with some time on it...quite tasty. worth checking out."

"Got in a trade with Cyde. 12 ounce can into lager glass; no canning date, but should be pretty fresh. Pours lightly hazy golden amber color with a 1 finger fairly dense white head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty lacing clings down the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big tangerine, lemon zest, peach, mango, pineapple, floral, grass, bread, light caramel, and floral/yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good complexity and balance of hop, malt, and yeast notes; with good strength. Taste of tangerine, grapefruit, lemon zest, peach, mango, pineapple, bread, light caramel, floral, grass, and floral/yeast earthiness. Light floral bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, pineapple, peach, mango, bread, light caramel, floral, grass, and floral earthiness on finish. Very nice complexity of citrus/tropical hop flavors with balanced malt sweetness; with a great malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth and lightly crisp mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very nice hoppy pale lager style. Nice complexity and balance of hop and malt flavors; and very smooth to drink. A very enjoyable offering."

"Is it just me, or does ""The One They Call Zoe"" sound like either a badass western or a badass horror movie? Anyway, this stuff pours a lightly-hazy sunset auburn-amber topped by a finger or so of off-white foam. The nose comprises light toffee, very light biscuit, mild candied orange peel, and a touch of grassy flowers. The taste brings in more of the same, eliciting thoughts of amber ales and the like. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a rather fluid feel. Overall, a nice beer; like I said above, it reminds me more of a nice amber ale than anything that calls itself a pale lager these days, but that doesn't hurt its enjoyment any. I could easily see drinking plenty of this as an everyday drinker, were it available 'round these parts."

"O: I'm enjoying the mix of american and german flavors in this beer. If it were a bit drier it would be much more sessionable, but a solid beer overall."
""
""
""
"O - This is an excellent lager that I could drink all day. I find myself going back to this beer very often. While there isn't anything outrageous it's just done very well and deserves a lot of recognition. I can't say enough good things about it."
""
"There's nothing huge or outrageous about this beer it just does everything right. A full flavored and thirst quenching beer that puts all pale lagers to shame. It pours a golden orange with a bit of hops and fruit on the nose. The taste zips on your tongue with citrusy fruit and apricot flavors and a mild bitterness to give it a nice dry finish. Very crisp and very refreshing. The Zoe is a bountiful beer in a can and a total home run from Hops and Grain."
"Hops and Grains really overachieved with this beer and I find myself still thinking about it long after my sampling was through. Itâ€™s the best Hops and Grain beer I have tried so far and I enthusiastically look forward to trying more."

"Im having a tough time thinking of a better hoppy lager than this. It is super delicious, thirst-quenching and has great tropical dry-hop flavor. Im already on my second six-pack and will surely buy more - perfect Texas summer beer - aka great when it is hot as hell. Mothfeel is plenty full for the style and well carbonated. Awesome beer! Well done H&G...well done indeed."
""
""
"I get a crisp, piney flavor from the first sip onward, with an upfront bitterness which gives it definition. Tapers off with a light touch of a caramel-malt finish. Pleasing, effervescent, and all too tasty. I think Iâ€™ll have five more."

"An absolutely fantastic and highly original lager. This is my favorite local beer made in Austin. It has a tart, crisp character that reminds me of grapefruit, but it isn't a fruity beer, at all. It has wonderful, balanced hop characteristics and a fantastic finish. A perfect beer. I only buy it now for special occaisons because I literally drink it too fast. I can't sip it like many other beers, I open a can, pour it in a glass, blink and its gone."

"Pours gold with a thin, white head. Smell is heavy on Euro hops. Pretty tasty overall. Very hop forwarded. Nice soft malts. A little sweetness in the end. The mouthfeel could be a little bubblier for me, but it's solid. With this and Sympathy for the Lager, I'm hoping and praying for a trend of hoppy canned lagers in TX."

"I gotta hand it to Hops and Grain. I'll be drinking a ton of Zoe in the upcoming months."

"This is an excellent session like lager. At 5.2% ABV, it is just a bit high for a true session beer, but why nit pick? One of the better new (to me) Texas beers I have had so far this year. Highly recommended."

"12oz can from a 6 pack I got at Specs Midtown (Houston TX). I'm happy to see Hops & Grain here as this has been an Austin local till now. Aggressive pour leaves a golden color with a finger of white head that fades fast and leaves a thin white line with little lacing as the glass goes down. I love the smell on this beer, right as a pop the can I get big fresh hop scent from this pale session lager. The taste is much more mild, slightly fruity, maybe a little grapefruite and brown sugar. I can see myself having multiples of this in one sitting. This is a perfect session beer, especially for the hot summertime months we have ahead of us here in Texas. I am very thankful that this is available to me now."

"A full bodied American lager. Yellow to golden with a minimal head and very little lace. Malty aroma and flavor. Biscuity, grainy, lightly toasted malt. Big body for the style with a medium plus hopped finish. Medium carbonation. Much closer to a German Pilsener than an American adjunct. Makes a great hot weather beer."
