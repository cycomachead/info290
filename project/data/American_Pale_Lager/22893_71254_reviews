"Flat beer. Tons of head."
"Classic lager look; bone white, thinish, soapy head. Mildly hazy, maybe chill haze. Glowing sunflower yellow to light. Looks great.  Aroma is a potent punch of hops oil, you can almost taste the hops, the aroma is so strong! Underneath the wall of alpha oils,you can detect pear, honey and grapefruit. The taste is appropriately hoppy for the smell; not  buzzsaw of bitterness, but is a well hopped lager, leaning toawrds an IPL. Pale lager malts are mild and add just enough countering sweetness. Sort of a blandly bitter impression, overall."

"yeasty-looking, hazy. nice hop aroma, very nice taste. very recommendable."
"This pours a hazy, yellow color with a slight white head. The aroma is full of wheat, citrus and other floral hints. The taste is very smooth easy drinking. While it is light and simple, this is the type of beer that will get your macro drinkers into craft. Very clean and light finish."

"Poured from a bomber (Batch #20) into a big ass mug, the beer is a hazy, bright, straw gold coloring with a filmy, fluffy, bright white head, and a ton of carbonation action throughout the body.  The aromas are toasted grain forward, with a healthy dose of floral hops characteristics, tart lemon notes, and medicinal highlights.  Flavors are bitter and spiced hops forward, with a healthy dose of moss, pepper, and grass.  Lemon rind highlights, floral accents, and a cracker backbone.  Smooth, but light and crisp in mouth.  The aftertaste is tart, resinous, and bitter, with more of the hops spice lingering on.  Crisp, effervesced, dry finish.  Very drinkable."

"The taste is a nifty freshness that the site should be. Extremely refreshing. Gimme a six of these babies. The aftertaste has the same freshness. Something nice to  linger on the palate. This is a tough beer to make. There are so many crappy american ones, but they made the effort and came up with one worth drinking."

"Classic golden pilsner appearance, I also think the can itself I really nice looking. Light smell, pale malts, some sweet floral notes. Not really bitter, but hoppy tasting, light citrus and fruit notes and some candy sweetness. Crisp and easy drinking."

"A nice summer time beer for hop heads! I love the bright hoppy flavors paired with such a light and effervescent pils. Certainly not the most authentic beer, but definitely worth a try if you like hops and are looking for a refreshing, low-alcohol alternative to IPA. Like most light lagers, it is a bit underrated on BA because too many people have hang ups about this style. Just because something is in the same family as a PBR or Bud doesn't mean it's bad!"

"O - This was a fun lager style beer to drink that has some distinct and unique flavors. I thought that they all came together really well and could enjoy this beer any hot day."
"Overall this is a super tasty Pils from the heart of Mormon Country."

"Subtlety in aroma and taste is the key with this lager, almost delicate in character, yet the hop bitterness is rather robust. Don't look for any massive, 2x4 between-the-eyes punch but, rather, an easy drinking, light-bodied beer that still provides plenty of sensory enjoyment."

"nobody told me this was a lager when I first ordered one. the nose didn't give it away either, light fruity hops emitting from a crystal clear pale yellow body with soapy lace all over the place. bright carbonation is evident, and the hops are so pungent they trump what I would normally be able to easily detect as lager yeast. the taste is a little less cloaked, as the hops aromatics give way to almost pilsener malt lightness, like a fresh baked biscuit getting softened butter, this has a meal type grain bill, even though its so light in color. nice balance towards the finish, not as well hopped as the name suggests it should be, but it is fruity and clean, refreshing. excellent carbonation keep up the hoppy vibe through the finish, and the light body and abv make it a really easy drinking beer. epic is doing some really cool stuff, and I love this one as a lager, different from the rest, this could have been a jacks abbey beer."
"On tap at the brewery in Denver. Gold color, looks pretty good. Aroma is a ho-hum lager. All malt and not a hop to speak of. Flavor was pretty standard lager with almost no hop character until a very bitter finish which I just didn't feel meshed well with the taste. Another bummer from the new brewery but hey at least I didn't buy a bottle right?"

"Appreciate the fact there's a lot more flavour than is typical for lower ABV beers, but this is definitely a lager and my personal preference lies with ales..."

"Poured from 22oz bottle into tulip. Well, its a lager alright...clear straw color but has a nice chewey head. Subtle piney hop with citrus crisp lager aromas. Taste is similar...there is a bit of fruitiness mixed well with the hops. Its crisp and chugable, but its no Jacks Abbey IPL...refreshing nonetheless. Good nit great, but for $3.99 for 22oz, its not bad."

"O: Easy to drink, hop forward lager. Could easily be classified as a IPL."

"Overall-Perfect for summer. Light and refreshing. Crisp and clean at the end."
"Poured a pale lighter yellow with a large blossoming white head that left three full rings of lace as it settled very slowly,just a great looking head and a nice spritzy look.Aromas are cleaner with a bit of toasted grain and faint honey sweetness,there is a shot of herbal hops in there as well.Somewhat dry on the palate up front with some toasted grain,a pretty good dose of herbal/leafy hops really stand out,the honey-like sweetness is there in the finish.This isn't a bad lager,it's fresh tasting and made for hot humid days like today."

"Poured into a Dogfish Head pint glass. Pours a light, lemony amber with a half finger white head that dissipates to a thin film leaving a lot of lacing. Aroma of light sweet biscuit malt and citrus, light generic hops, a bit grainy. Flavor of biscuit malt, light piney and citrus hops, citrus. Starts with nice hops and finishes with citrus and dry malt. Light bodied. The flavor profile is quite similar to a classic pilsner, but with fresher hops. I have to imagine that this is what Czech and German pilsners might taste like if fresh, which I've never experienced. Flavors are pleasant, but understated. Interesting to have a lager with fresher hop taste."

"Pours hazy golden color with plenty of white head that laces nicely as the pint goes down. Nose is on the lighter & cleaner side for me with some hints of grass, herbs, and citrus. Mouthfeel is pleasingly smooth with good carbonation, light bready flavors, lemony citrus hops to balance, and more of the herbal components mixed in. Finishes with some hoppy aftertaste that is nice."

"22 ounce bottle into pilsener glass; Release 7, bottled 5/24/2012. Pours hazy golden straw color with a 1 finger dense white head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing on the glass; with a nice amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of lemon, pear, apple, pepper, grass, floral, cracker, bready grain, and earthy hop spiciness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance and complexity. Taste of lemon, pear, apple, orange zest, floral, grass, cracker, bread, pepper, pine, and herbal hop spiciness. Fair amount of lemony pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, light fruits, floral, grass, pepper, cracker, bread, pine, and herbal hop spiciness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice flavor balance with good complexity; good hop/malt balance; and almost zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a crisp, prickly, and lightly sticky mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is very well hidden with nearly zero warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a very good hoppy pale lager. Nice hop/malt flavor balance with solid complexity; and extremely smooth and crisp to drink. I enjoyed this quite a bit, very well done."
"O: Overall this is a very nice beer, that is easy to drink, sessionable, and quite refreshing. A nice low ABV for an easy drinking beer is one that I could easily have all day long and it pairs nicely with food - in my case, ribs."

"A great example of a usually not very inspiring style. From the 22 oz bottle bought at the Utah Liquor Store in Sugar House."

"D: some flaws that i cant really overlook. any lager shouldnt have this much haze and i cant really get over the soap on the nose. if they can clean a few things up this would be pretty solid."
"O - Very refreshing lager. I really enjoyed the added hops to this beer"
""
"Medium bodied with a crisp, spicy hop bite up front that provides some dry bitterness which lingers over the sweeter notes into a dry finish. Earthy and slightly resinous with some grassy pine flavor followed by some light fruit and pilsner malt. Hints of hay, biscuit and grainy cracker give this beer a nice pale malt backbone that counters the other flavors. Not overly complex but well balanced, flavorful and easy to drink."
"So, this seems less like a syndrome and more like a kersniffle, at first. As time goes on though, the beer does grow on me and I appreciate it more. There is a mild fruit tone to it that I find interesting and a somewhat herbal and oddly minty thing as well. But overall, it's just a pretty easy drinkin' lager with nice earthy tones. I would have loved a lot (or a little) more hop influence or something that makes this one stand out a bit more, but no matter. If I were out, I'd probably order this on-tap if I saw it."
"This is a really nice, hoppy, smooth lager. The hops are intense and definitely give it character. A bit more balance would help, but overall this was a very enjoyable offering."

"Would buy again, but the finish leaves a bit to be desired."
"O: An interesting new lager beer, it's a weird hybrid of Bohemia and CA, and it works pretty well. The malt is tough to find, but the hops are good, and it is refreshing and easy drinking. Good price as well."
"D: This is a nice, flavorful lager with a good bit of character. Obviously hop-focused, and a bit more yeast character than usual for a pale lager, but this was enjoyable."
""
"Bottle: Poured a hazy golden color lager with a large foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of fruity hops with lightly sweet malt base is very interesting. Taste is a good mix between some floral and lightly sweet malt base with some fruity hops undertones and a light bitter finish. Body is above average for style with good carbonation. Really enjoyed this one and this is something I would drink more often if it was locally available."

"A good solid tasting lager, I'll have another."
"O - A good lager, although not my favorite. If I'm going to reach for a lager, I'll go with the Germans."
"I got this as a gift - I won't be seeking out another bottle, but have no real criticisms other than it just doesn't excite my palate."
""
""
"Good beer, enjoyable but does leave you wanting more. I brighter hop aroma and flavor would really take this beer to another level. If this beer were sold in six packs I would purchase it for various barbecues or other summer activities, the bottle size is not the most my favorite for the style."
""
"Pours a clear light yellow with a foamy white head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Foamy streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, citrus fruit, and citrus zest. Taste is the same with a mild bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that is drinkable but somewhat light in my opinion."
"O: It's a mildly above average lager with a little bigger hops presence."
"interesting hybrid brew from epic. what struck me first was the greenish tinge when poured into my epic logo pint. frothy white head with larger bubbles rising from the bottom, but it didn't stick around. herbal, almost medicinal aromas wafting out of this one; increased in intensity as the beer warmed up a few degrees. something grassy, too. light body as expected with a dry, dry finish. not as thirst quenching as i would have expected; those american hops really dry this beer out. taste is like a german pilsner that received an extra dose of u.s. hops. i suppose that's what they were going for in this one. certainly ok, but i wouldn't rush out to find another."
"Overall: This is a very hoppy, bitter lager. Too bitter for the low abv and light malts IMO. Quite simply there is not enough oomph or taste to back up the bitterness. Just as a point of comparison, Victory Prima Pils is also very bitter, but has the necessary taste to make it a world class beer."
"A very solid lager all around, the hopping is obviously the showcase here but the maltiness does hold its own. Very drinkable."

"Thanks, Douglass88, for the opportunity"
"No dating on the bottle but the description, the label, and the big greenhop on the label grabbed my attention. Beautiful looking beer it's almost glowing a neon lemon slight haziness but it's bright looking. Glistening white head with thick layers of tiny bubbles filling the top portion of the glass. Aroma has a bright lemon citrus quality, the label says their American hops with American yeast, and German pilsner malt. The smell is great I just keep smelling fresh picked ups with green, herbal, bright lemon citrus, and earthiness jump out of the glass. Flavor has a clean lemon citrus punch that brings with it layers of grassy/herbal quality, dusted with some yeast nuttiness and pale malt sweetness. Becomes a bit hop pellet focused with each sip, but I really can't hate on the hops this is a delicious hoppy lager that is their #5 relase in the Exponential series. This bottle label says 5% abv, which is still right in the sessionable level, 22 ounce bomber for 6 bucks well worth it for my tastes. Mouthfeel is light bodied with slick hop oils lubricating the palate this beer is actually making me salivate from all of the hop additions. Carbonation is dead on not overdone but sturdy enough to carry it all through with each sip. Quite the enjoyable creative hopped up lager, that I wish I had regular access to."

"Light body, but not too thin. Carbonation is good. If it was hot outside, this may hit the spot. Not very interesting, but not terribly flawed."
""
"o - Overall a pretty average pale ale. Easy to drink but the nose is very muted, though the taste is a bit better. Not something I'd probably seek out again."
"PS: This is Release #4."
""

"O- I struggled with this one and was glad it was finally gone. Pretty one dimensional and boring. I'll pass on this one."
"A decent beer, to be sure, but not one of Epic's better efforts. Dry, slightly skunky, and light bodied, there's not a lot going on here, and what is happening is something I could take or leave. Better to grab a Smoked and Oaked if you're looking for something Epic."
"O: Def drinkable, my first Epic from CO experience , and I enjoyed it"
"O: Overall a crisp offering with its fair share of hops makes for a great summer time drink. The hops overshadow the fine german pilsner malt, but this is an American pale lager not a pilsner so much can be forgiven. Would like to see this in six packs. Very good drinkability."
"Overall: I think this is a solid beer. The American Pale Lager is a tough category because it is dominated by the big boy on the macro market. Many craft drinkers will hold their noses up as they walk past this one to get something a little stronger. This is a shining example of a beer that can be used to win over craft converts. It tastes familiar enough to them, and yet is still well made with a solid taste."
"Overall, a nice lager, though not as big and hoppy as I expected from the name and packaging. I was thinking something along the lines of an imperial pilsner. Not bad, but somewhat overpriced."
"Overall: easy to quaff lager that is mildly refreshing too. Pretty good beer after doing some yard work and you need to quench the thirst."
"D - not the best flavor but fairly easy to drink, I probably wouldn't pick up another, but then again, i'm not the biggest lager fan."
"Poured straw-yellow, slightly hazed, with a thin white head that receded to a thin ringlet. Noticeable carbonation. Clean, light aroma, decent balance of sweet malts and citrusy hops. Basic taste of grains and sweet malts, lightly hopped for a good balance and a mostly dry finish. A little bitter. Light body, crisp, and pretty drinkable. Not bad for a lager."
"Overall, very similar to an above average euro lager with a little more hops."
"O- By American Pale Lager standards this is near the top. I would gladly pick this up for tailgating, or as my beer for over the course of a night. It doesn't push the boundaries quite so much as it advertises, but it still tastes good and that's what counts."
"O - This particular beer in the Exponential series doesn't do it for me. It's hoppier than the average lager but compared to the other beers I've tried in the Exponential Series from Epic, it seems out of place. Yeah, it's hoppier, but it's only 5.1%, I don't see how this would be classified in the same category as some of their bigger beers...maybe I'm missing something?"
"O: Once I let this warm up to about 45-50 degrees rather than the colder temperatures lagers are traditionally enjoyed at, the beer became more than just your average pale lager, yet not as hoppy as advertised. So good for the style, but falls short of expectations of a hoppy lager, and probably my least favorite Epic offering as of yet."
"Notes: Excellent for the style. Torn here, as it is a high dollar for an American lager but it is a truly excellent, well made beer and definitely satisfies more than most pale US lagers. A worthwhile buy, even for a style that people generally don't associate with high quality, non-adjunct laden ingredient bills."
"D- very very drinkable and bright. Perfect summer quencher."
