"Wonderful hop aroma, crisp body with a distinct lager finish. Unique take on the expected IPA experience. Obviously - whether or not you like lagers will determine how much you will enjoy the overall taste, especially the end when the malt comes on strongest and lingers after the glass is put down."
""
"Overall: An excellent, easily drinkable yet heavy lager. Can't wait till JA starts distributing in Rhode Island liquor stores, because this lager will vault to the top of the list for any lager purchases I'll make. Yummy!"

"up front tropical and zesty citrus with a light biscuity underpinning.  Medium feel that is creamy in feel but finishes crisp, refreshing and clean.  Another great beer from this brewery.  They are changing my opinion on what lagers can be."
""
"I don't get the ratings. This beer is completely lacking balls. It's neutered. Easy drinking pale ale/ barely an ipa. Where are the kahunas??"

"Pours from the bottle a clear amber with a finger of white head. Nice aroma of tropical fruits, pine and malt. You get the malt first, but then there's a nice transition to the citrusy hops. The bitterness lingers without being overpowering. Medium mouth and very smooth. This is a great IPL. Much better than SN's Hoppy Beer Camp."

"3.77/5: One of the better IPLs I've sampled"
""
"Standard IPA / IPL done really well--I get a nuttiness from the hop or malt bill that makes this pretty interesting."
"Poured into a willy glass.  Super clear golden yellow with a half finger or so white whispy head that leaves enormous lace.  Aroma is not real prominent but I did pick up some citrus and pine.  Taste is nice, super clean, with some malty sweetness followed by pine and citrus.  Mouth is great.  Overall, a really enjoyable hoppy lager"
"I mean wow, this is the ipl that all others wish they were.  Absolutely fantastic and a must try."
""
""
"I have several IPAs that I love but this beer is a real treat.  It's got a great flavor profile and I find it slightly creamier than the IPAs I typically enjoy.  Every time I have one I'm pleasantly surprised, and I'm now buying it by the case at my local Costco.  This is a truly delicious beer that I often recommend."
""
"Overall: Everything I have had from Jack's Abby in the recent past has been a nice treat.  This is no exception.  I like it, but prefer beer with more ""Zing."""

"Surprisingly good beer. Not quite an IPA.  Not quite a lager. Very nice overall taste and drinkability."
""
"This beer is very tasty! I love fact how they made this beer so earthy and a hint of citrus. The smell to me almost has a weed smell. awesome beer, and good buy."
"Everything I love in a beer. Citrus and earthy hops. Nice feel."

"Unexpectedly amazing beer. Great hop flavor and smooth lager finish."

"Also, I just tried to the SN 2015 spring beer camp.  It's just like this beer.  So, I was inspired to add this review when I reviewed it.  Neither is better than the other, honestly.  These two beers are like clones."
"Cheers!!!"

"I love this beer; This little Massachusetts brewery is doing wonderful things right meow."

"Well I should have expected the super bitter hoppiness, but it seemed to far for me"
""
""
"For a hoppy brew I'm not too turned off by it."
""
"A great beer, indeed. Pours with a nice, foamy head. The aroma is not too strong, that of hops and fruit (lemons), maybe a slight malt kick. The taste is just an absolutely perfect example of a smooth, hoppy pale ale that hits all the right notes and strongly resembles the nose. Hops on the initial impact, and a nice citrus finish. The malt is present, but the 6.7%ABV certainly is not. This is the kind of thing that can open a mindless sud-water drinker to a world of well balanced, fantastic craft alternatives. Nothing too crazy, a good beer for almost any situation."

"Overall: A marvelous beer, and one in a category all of its own. I'd like to see Jack's Abby be able to preserve the lager subtleties but add solid hop flavor in a low ABV offering, such as a traditional south-west German Pils or other hoppier-than-usual lager styles. However, for now, if I want a hoppy beer that's crisper than an ale, I'll gladly reach for a sixer of this stuff. Would highly recommend."
""
"Pours into a pokal an orange tinged medium golden with a sticky full one finger bone white head atop.Tropical fruits all over the place in the nose along with light toasted cereal grain.Grainy feel with some dry toasted malt underneath tropical fruit-like hops that linger in the finish.Seems mush small er than 6.7%,one of the more hopped up lagers I have had."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a straw yellow with a head that trails the glass. The scent is full of pine from the hops. The taste was fantastic with a focus on the hops, but with a nice balance with the malt to create an exceptionally clean finish. Great focus and execution of the style. Loved it right away."

""
""

"It's excellent, but just not my favorite style. They do sure excel at lagers though."
"Sweeetness doesn't keep the dry nature of this beer from showing in the feel one bit.  If anything, it only starts sweet and ends quite dry.  Crispness kicks the whole time off a soft, strong carbonation that creates lots of smoothness."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Bottle as an extra in trade. Thanks! Pours hazy golden colored with a one finger white head. Aroma is grassy hops, tropical fruit, lager yeast sweet aromas. Flavor is sweet tropical fruits, pineapples, grapefruits, mango, some honey sweetness, lightly crisp grassy pine, but not particularly bitter. Smooth body, medium plus heaviness especially for the style, with medium plus carbonation. Crisp finish and easy drinking. Very nice."

"Hazy and almost no head, as to be expected with a beer full of hop oils.  Smells fairly mild for a beer billed as an ""india"" whosawhatsit.  Hoppy for sure, but nothing compared to heady west coast style IPA I grew accustomed to in Denver.  The flavor was another story.  The malt starts things off pretty mildly, with predictable toasty sweetness, but hops quickly take over.  Body is there, as is a gentle carbonation level.  I feel like I'd be more comfortable with a blast of soapy pilsy or grassy german hops, but the american hops coupled with lagered malt cleanliness is unique and singular to this beer. It is unusual and not unenjoyable, especially after years of ""moar hopz"" west coast beers.  Think of a fresh bottle of Urquell poured half and half with a Smuttynose IPA.  Bizarre but delicious.  It's really good, but I'd still opt for SNPA or Bells Two Hearted Ale since they're easier to get and world class outstanding beers.  If I saw this one in the same cooler, I'd definitely grab it for a change of pace, but I fail to see it as anything really out of the ordinary in terms of flavor."
""
""
"Overall: This is one of those beers I got tired of hearing about and tried in part so I could say the hype is wrong. Well, I failed. This is a really excellent beer - one to seek out, worth sipping and enjoying, but also the right balance for cookouts and outdoor goings-on."
""
"O:  For the style, there really is nothing like it. Those who purchased it thinking it was a standard IPA didn't read carefully enough, and shouldn't hold that against it. An IPL done well is a rare thing, and this is the prime example."

"O: This is an interesting twist on a lager or IPA. The sweetness helps balance the hops - but they are still there to enrich the experience. There is no sense of alcohol at all. This is an enjoyable beer and I will seek out more from Jack's Abbey."
""
"Golden straw with a quarter inch head and good lacing. Some grain and malt on the nose. The flavor is of citrus, notably orange, and the presence of hops. Good carbonation, and mild bitterness. I am not generally a lager drinker, but this is good stuff. We'll balanced and wonderfully crafted, as would be expected from Jack's Abby."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Full mouthfeel, semi-slick, finishes tingly. Good beer."
""
""
""
"I'm sick so it probably affects my tastes considering how much the aroma of this beer is supposed to be really great. It's crisp and easy to drink but the taste doesn't hit too hard."
""
""
"Overall: A pretty tasty treat from Jack's Abby. I really liked how well the hop and citrus flavors melded and flowed across the tongue. Wish I had regular access to this beer. Definitely recommend."
""
""
""
""
""
"By now everyone knows the quality brewing going on with lagers at Jack's Abby, and the locally sourced ingredients fueling their beers. Hoponius Union has a nice bite at the beginning, but mellows out with subtle sweet flavors resembling grapefruit mixed with almost a nutmeg richness. It's easy to drink 2-3 of these at a sitting. A nice substantial taste, but not overly filling. One of my favorite beers of all time."
"Overall an amazing beer, one that I am happy to have regular access to."

"I made a solemn promise to The Old Lady last summer that if a beer in any way indicates that it is bottle-conditioned, I would treat it as gently as I would her. The fact that she would beat my ass within an inch of my life if I ever mistreated her notwithstanding, I went with a VERY gentle pour. I have said before, she is as tough as nails, which is part of the attraction for me. I got a brief skim of bone-white head across the top of the beer before it faded into mere wisps. Color was a sunshine-yellow (SRM = 4) with just the faintest of haze visible in the glass. I promise you, I was extremely gentle, but there may have been something in suspension. Nose smelled deeply of citrus-grapefruit rind hops. Wow! As a lifelong Pennsylvanian, I know the difficulty behind making a Lager and to make one that comes off with this level of hoppiness is just amazing. Mouthfeel was thin-to-medium. The taste was all hops and for a hophead, that was just fine by me. I cannot say that I would have identified it as a lager of any stripe, but perhaps that is part of the mystique. I do know that the light, spritzy mouthfeel made it very easy to drink on a Summer day, where an AIPA might have been more to handle. The finish was extremely dry and I really had a tough time believing that this was a lager. I had put the remainder of what was left in the bottle back in the reefer to settle and when I went to pour some more into the glass, I noticed that the haze had cleared! Impressive. Warming, I got some of the honey notes that I always think of as characteristic of well-made lagers, but the hops continued to carry the day."

"a little too lageresque for me but it is very nice. would recommend for a nice hot afternoon. (it's 93 here now)."
""
"The beer pours a nice white and foamy head that dissipates quickly. The head is white. The beer itself is a clear orange with some brown notes. The beer smell has a strong hoppy smell with malt sweetness taking the edge off of some of it. The hops are a nice orange citrus, which mixes well with the bready sweetness from the malts. The beer taste is similar to the smell with a strong hoppy note but very little of the malt present in the smell. The hop still a strong citrus taste to it. The mouthfeel is fairly smooth to the point where it is slightly creamy.Carbonation. Medium bodied but still fels light. Overall, a very good lager and worth getting. I enjoyed greatly and most definitely lives up to the hype."

"O- Quite a good beer. A wonderful melding of styles."
""
""
""

"Fizzy and chill-hazed yellow-orange in color like a lager. The off-white froth is stagnant. Citrus hops feature prominently aromatically, like and IPA, but the lager yeast is noticed, veiled, and just behind. Tastes of citrus, lemon peel and grain. The hoppiness is subdued, as if it was stopped in mid-sentence while trying to make a very brilliant point. Mouth-feel is medium and the body is crisp with a bit of heat in the finish. While this one is pretty damn tasty, I'm left ambivalent, wondering if I would rather just have one or the other."

"A bottled beer? From woodychandler? Yes, it's true. And what a bottle to come through with, many thanks. Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a deep golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of hops, citrus. Taste is smooth and refreshing. I could drink these all day long. Some solid hops, malts, citrus, well done. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a high quality beer."

"O. This is a really good Pale Lager. Very hoppy but incredibly well-balanced and has a very classic pilsner finish, with spice and grain providing a very crisp, refreshing experience. I love this beer and would make it a staple in my fridge were it available in my part of the country."
""
"Overall, feels like a more crisp American IPA, with a German malt base and perfectly balanced hops. Extremely drinkable (watch out for the abv) and tasty."

"Surprisingly my first taste of Hoponius and I certainly wasn't disappointed. This is a beautiful looking beer in it's color. Not the hoppiest smell I was hoping for so it may not have been the freshest bottle. The Mouthfeel was a little too much of a bite but that's just being nit-picky. Overall really loved this brew!"

"O - A great session beer; smooth, full flavored, well balanced, easy drinking."
""
""
"Clear golden pour, with a nice, thick, foamy cap of white head; nice retention and some patchy lacing on the glass. Aroma was very light, notes of herbal hops, and biscuity malt sweetness. The taste was mostly sweet up front, biscuity malts, toffee, fruit punch, giving way to toasted grains, and a lightly bitter, herbal hop finish. Light-medium body, moderate carbonation, pretty easily drinkable. Overall decent, especially for a lager, but still probably not something I'd go for again."
"Just another great beer from Jack's Abbey. Aroma starts off with a big burst of citrus and slight caramel malt presence. The taste starts off with a bright citrus flavor, but then transitions to a more pungent tropical fruit taste such as mango most notably. Not alot of bitterness on this at all, and sweet caramel malt rounds things out. The  drinkability and taste is superior to the slew of session ipas that have come out recently. This is a must try beer and as a full strength IPL I personally feel this is a much better alternative to most session ipas. (93/100)"

"O: I thoroughly enjoyed this beer, and tried to compensate for some lower individual marks in this category. I will say that it is lager-like in one sense: it loses a bit of a appeal as it warms."
"pours a more or less opaque golden hue with a generous frothy head. Smells strongly of citrussy hops- orangey, floraly and mildly piney notes- west coast inspired I assume. Defiantly pick up on the yeasty lager components here. Citrus hops hit first while the piney notes come in the background, not an overly bitter hop profile and finishes with a clean and refreshing lager characteristic. Mild alcohol presence, carbonation is on point and an overall very clean IPL. On the whole this is a very well crafted IPL that certainly makes me want to come back for more."
""
""
""
""

"The feel of this beer is light and is quit drinkable. This is really smooth with ever the smallest bump in the road of bitterness. This makes a good early spring beer."

"Bottle poured fresh from brewey and cold into a glass. Golden with semi rushing bubbles a spotty off white legs. Smell strong citrus and floral accented by a bit if earthiness. Taste and feel impressive at first getting a pleasant grapefruit and line leading into a the lager profile which is a bit hard to explain but almost a toasted bread which probably is the yeast or spelt? Overall feel, depth are outstanding with a unique flavor profile. Welcome change from the regular apa/IPA"
""

"poured from a bottle into a tulip shaped glass. Appearance is great, big head, golden-copper lagerish color, minimal lacing. Smell is good-ish, Lagers never smell as good as ales IMO. Plenty o' bubbles, great taste. Nice and fruity, no bitterness, very drinkable. I really like this beer, it might be better then their Mass Rising."

"O: This is a very nice beer. Hoppy, but sessionable by my standards. Would have liked to have experienced more hops on the nose. Not sure on the price of this one as I received it as an extra in a trade, but if I had access to this one, I could see these being a very respectable go-to beer."

"Draught @ Noho Brewfest: This one pours a clear golden color. There was a small white head on it. The nose is good: piney and citrus hops. The taste is good also. IT has a pretty good hop bite. Pine and resinous hops dominate the flavor. Medium bodied. This tastes really good and is easy to drink."
"Mildly hazy body the color of honey. Thick head, tiny patchwork of lacing leaves an imprint. Creamy gobs remain in the glass. Glorious resiny hops with slices of fresh fruit in the aroma. Flavor is geared more to the fruit side of hops, juicy and has a mineral flavor in the back. Bitterness is sustained yet present. Digging almost everything these guys are doing."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Indeed, the only difference between Hoponius Union and a West-Coast IPA - aside from the fact that it's brewed in Massachusetts - is that it's been lagered. This offering only further reinforces my opinion that people (beer educators specifically) put far too much emphasis on the 'lager vs. ale' comparison; there's obviously so many more important factors that distinguish a beer."

"Overall, a wonderful experience for my first Jack's Abby beer. Of course, I'm a bit of a hop addict, so my opinion is skewed, but I think I'm being fair when I say that this doesn't lose sight of the fact that it is not an IPA. It retains the bready, crisp characteristics that you expect from the style. From what I've heard, these guys know their way around lagering, and based on this first example, I'm inclined to agree."

"Orange/gold and clear with a short, dense off-white cap. Thick lacing and great head retention. Fresh hop aroma, lots of citrus, grapefruit, pith, slight pineapple. Really well constructed, with citrus hops throughout but mild malt up front and tropical/spicy notes in the bitter finish. Moderate carbonation, on the creamy side while still retaining some crispness, nice texture. I really enjoyed this beer. Bright hops all the way through yet still refined and refreshing."

"a touch too sweet to go nuts for my personal taste but there is not much wrong with this beer. solid in all fazes of the game, I definitely would have this on tap if I saw it (unless there was something ungodly on the other tap(s))"

"I'm drinking on this beer as I'm writing this message.. This nice golden look with a nice hoppy lager smell.. The taste is unbelievable .. Soon as you open the bottle you can smell the fresh IPL hoppy smell.. Leaves a nice taste on on tongue.. Jack Abby's continues to create classic beers.. Cheers!!!!"

"O: A nice IPL."

"The palate opens with a clean, quenching bitterness, mildly resiny and extremely citrusy, with orange zest, orange juice and grapefruit present by the bucketful. A mild pine sap bitterness is present as well. The mid-palate brings out the hop flavor, the blend of floral citrus and a little bit of grass. Malt character is minimal, with just a little bit of a burnt sugar/ toffee/honey sweetness present, pairing really well with the citrus hops. With the classic lager smoothness/slickness on the palate, this beer is ridiculously clean and has a nice, biting bitterness on the finish. Medium-light in body with moderate carbonation, this beer is excellent on the palate. Very highly recommended. In the pantheon of IPLs, there aren't many that better this."
"O- I'm impressed with this beer. Wish I had ready access to it as I really enjoyed it and think it'd also be a good beer for my dad. He enjoys craft, but most times when I let him try an IPA he smacks his lips, wrinkles his nose, and says, ""Grapefruit juice."" All in all, really well done beer."

"This is a pretty decent beer, I don't have much experience with craft lagers but this is pretty tasty. That said, I definitely prefer ales to Lagers."

"O: Pretty darn tasty, and it certainly makes a good argument against the ""lagers are tasteless"" crowd. Still, it wouldn't necessarily be a go-to for me in the face of other choices - there are a lot of readily available IPAs that are just plain better."

"O - a tasty beer, and probably the best Jack's Abby I've had (of the four I've tried). It's got a nice hop profile and isn't overwhelming at all. A little bitter for my taste, but, objectively, very good."
"This beer kept the quality of a lager and added just the right amount of hops to show them off a little but not get carried away. Extremely food friendly with just a hint of sweetness. This beer is uncomplicated by the hops and is quite engaging."

"Bold yellow/orange body that is completely translucent with a crisp finger width white head. Good looking beer in the glass. Some pine and citrus on the nose. Aggressively hopped and quite bitter with a solid lager base. The lager base is my favorite part of this beer. Very well made with a great mouthfeel. The hopping is a bit too aggressively west coast for my taste. It is certainly interesting with the lager body though. Worth a try for west coast IPA fans indeed."

"This is light to medium bodied. The carbonation is sharp. Overall this is very enjoyable. I will definitely be picking up more of this."

"Overall: The smell is just fantastic, and following that, this is a nice, easy drinking, balanced IPL. Very crisp and refreshing. Incredible value as well. Definitely recommend trying some of this."
""
"O - A very good beer. I just didn't find any lager qualities. I absolutely love Jack Abby's 2nd Anniversary Lager, as it combines lots and lots of quality hops with the clean and crisp finish of a lager. This tastes more like an IPA to me. A very good one actually. Great tasting beer which I will certainly try again, but I was disappointed in not finding that lager crispness. Still highly recommended."
""
"Thanks to Boston_Steve for the trade! Pours a golden amber with fluffy white head that dissipates quickly. Nice lacing. Aroma is all about hops - floral, citrus, pine, some grassiness - a very nice smelling beer. Taste follows nose, bitter throughout but nicely balanced by sweet malt backbone. A very quaffable beer. Smooth, with a light-medium body and effervescent carbonation. Overall a well crafted lager. I've only had one other IPL, that from Boston Beer Company, and I do like the style! An IPA(L) that one can serve cold, I'll be looking for these come summer!"
""
"Overall: The lager flavor mixed with the strong hop profile doesn't completely work for me. It's a good beer and very unique, but maybe a little too much on the dry side. I wasn't in the mood for a second one. Glad I got to try this on-tap, regardless."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Well it really is that good, something you could definitely drink a few of, I think there's also some great examples of the style already out there, but this one is popular for a reason."
""
""
""
"Pours a bit cloudy with a small head that persists. An IPL it is, tasting quite like many a great IPA while having a lighter body and clean finish reminiscent of a lager. This is a good drinking beer which goes down easy and doesn't pack a major ABV wallop. Very fine beer, this!"

"Pours a nice bright gold with a big puffy head, a light cream color. Lots of lacing, very good retention, in case you're curious. The aroma is quite hoppy. Big on bright citrus with a little tropical fruit in the mix. Nice floral note, as well. Sugary, doughy malt underneath all of those hops. Taste is similar. Lots of hop flavor. It pretty much drinks like an IPA. It's just a bit cleaner for better and worse. The hops start with sweet floral and citrus flavors but get a bit bland in the finish. It's just not quite as juicy as I'd like. Nice dry finish, otherwise. Light mouthfeel with a little bit of hop oiliness. Very good beer."

""
""
""
"Overall, a very cool beer. The second ""IPL"" I've had, and this one is the better of the two. Lots of great hop flavor, with a good dose of bitterness; couple that with the lager maltiness, and this reminds me of a super-hoppy version of an English IPA. Delicious!"
""
""
""
""
"Light body and well carbonated. An interesting beer, but I feel this bottle might have been past its prime."
"this india pale lager style is really taking off, and this is one of the better examples, but I hate to say like I always do, that humulus from the bruery set the bar impossibly high for other brewers. this is excellent, until you have a humulus. it pours a nice radiant orange color with an inch of fading white fluff. a nose of crisp clean pine family hops, with a pronounced bitter close. lager yeast is evident upon the first sip, its dry but not at snappy as some. it lets the cereal grains come through a lot to balance the hops, which have a sort of punctuated citrus and pine bitterness back and forth going on. the beer would be better if it didn't come across so filling. bigger malt base than necessary here I think, fuller than most lagers, but its carbonated well and the bitter finish is quite dry, encouraging quick consumption. overall a great beer, but underwhelming in some ways, especially when put up against the gold standard for the genre."
""
""
""
"Bottle from gn0sis, thanks! Poured into a snifter. The beer is burnished golden orange with two fingers of soapy white froth. Lots of lacing clings to the glass. The nose is clean with a pleasantly bright hop fruitiness that's dripping with tangerine, mango, passion fruit, and orange redolence. Warming brings out herbal and floral character with a touch of spiciness. Malt presents no sweetness and brings to mind saltine cracker and maybe a touch of biscuit. The flavor catches your attention immediately with a firm but gentle bitterness that's accompanied by orange pith and flesh, grapefruit, herbal and floral notes, and a light mango presence. There's less hop fruitiness in the flavor than in the nose, with the herbal and citrus pith being more dominant. The finish is clean, bitter, and quite dry, with a hint of alcohol. Excellent stuff. I'd drink this often if it were fresh and available around here."

"Pouts a somewhat clear, somewhat lighter orange color with a beige finger of head. Dissipates to a frothy foam. Aroma has lots of floral, grassy and pungent grapefruit. Malt profile is mild. Tastes of juicy grapefruit, mango, orange, floral hops and grassy, herbal hops. Lighter sweetness, touches of caramel. Body is light, oil, slick, crisp, and down right beautiful...lager body, IPA boldness. Drinks like a charm, overall excellent!"

""

"Overall it's a solid beer. Telling the difference from this lager and the IPA's would not be an easy task for me. I'm happy to try this at least once. Unfortunately this beer was not fresh as I hoped it would be. This is a great beer but I wonder how it would taste if it was less than 30 days old."

"Lightly hazed blonde, 1.5 fingers of white head, some lace as well. Smell is full of tropical fruits and citrus, grapefruit, pineapple and oprange, a persistant grainy malt, but quite hte hefty hop bill here. Taste is of fruity citrusy hops, grapefruit and orange, fishihes with a bit of crisp larger malt, bitterness throughout and felt in the cheeks, heavily hopped. Lightly carbonated, medium feel and oily on the back of the pallate. An incredible lager here, would gladly revisit this again, great drinkability."

"$5.99 for 500 ml bottle."

"A surprising IPL that drinks like IPA but at lower temperature. Very well balanced beer that should grace every hophead's list. I'm lucky enough to have local distribution, but I have little doubt this brand will go national before the next presidential elections. The entire lineup is quite good, with HU and Framnghammer clearly the most popular entries."

"Pour is transparent amber with a lot of fluffy white head and some large bubbles. Nose is light, clean and fresh. Some grain, a touch doughy, strong hop punch, tropical fruits light, grassy and herbal. Taste is the same, well attenuated, clean grain notes, a touch doughy, with a strong hop punch. More tropical fruit, grapefruit, grassy hop behind, and light bitterness with a dry well carbonated finish and lighter body."

""
""
""

"O: A very nice beer. The lager base is complemented quite well by the plentiful hopping, but it remains central to the character of this beer. A strongly bitter lager, to be sure, but retaining a lot of the drinkability of the style. Definitely a beer I'd be happy to have again at some point."

"Mouthfeel is a bit thinner than I'd like as I prefer my hoppy beer to have some substance to them but this certainly nothing to be too picky about. Refreshing and highly drinkable. I'd challenge any BA to correctly identify this as a lager in a blind taste test."
""
""
""
"Pours a fairly clear deep golden color with a decent sized creamy white head that dissipates rather quickly. Aromas of sweet bready malty with hint of spice and fruit with a light spicy earthy hop aroma to round it all out. The flavor holds a creamy bready malty taste with lots of spicy earthy hops to balance it out. Medium body with a moderate level of carbonation and a slick almost sweet mouthfeel. Another great brew from Jack's, but not one I would seek out again."
""
"It's easy to become seduced by thinking of this beer as a hoppy lager. But the counterpart could be taken too- that this is an IPA with quivering support and exposed hop-derived astringency."

"I loved this one. Heard a lot about it and am glad I was lucky enough to finally get to try it!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Pours a hazy, bubbly golden-orange with a large lasting frothy off-white head. Some lacing on the glass. Really nice aroma is fruity and hoppy, with lots of citrus hops and tropical fruit along with beady malt and some herbal and floral notes. Flavor is just as nice, lots of citrusy hops and plenty fruity, with citrus and tropical fruit and a long moderate bitter finish."

""
"Overall: tasty, refreshing and wonderfully creamy. Bam!"

"On it's own it's much better than Jack Brau by a mile and but not in the class as say Victory Prima Pils."

""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Very nice beer. This is something that I would drink more of if it was available in my area. A great summer beer, but also something that you'd want all year round. Solid."
""

"T: Lots of grapefruit and pine upfront with a light but sturdy biscuity malt backbone. Finish brings a touch of pine resin, but finishes very smooth and clean. This beer is fantastic. Why can't we get this in San Diego? Why???"

"Lines are blurred when it comes to traditional styles these days, and crossover beers seem to be emerging all the time. Somehow this lager bridges the gap to hopville, and is an enjoyable change of pace, but I'm not completely floored either. Worthy of trying for both IPA fans and lager fans, I'm not getting the world class ratings on this one: good but not incredible."
""
""
"O: Another home-run from Jack's Abby. I would take this beer over most IPAs out there."
""
""
"O - Finally a lager with good ipa qualities. This one lived up to the hype for me."
""
""
""
"Wouldn't hesitate to drink this over and over again. Not quite humulus lager, but better than SA IPL. I'm really liking this IPL trend. . ."

""
""
""

"Drink- Im not a lager fan, but these hoppy lagers are really starting to do it for me."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"What a fantastic beer! I would love to try it fresher, as I could only imagine what the hop profile does then. The fact that this is a lager makes this a far crisper and easier to drink beer than its hoppy counterparts, and as a result really sets a standard for making more delicious hoppy and flavorful lagers in the country. I seriously want to see more beers like these - preferably out West. A world class lager!"
""
"OK, it's hard to really determine what I feel about this beer in relation to any others of its kind, but I will say that my first impression is that this is a very solid beer that carries the torch well in the IPA category. There isn't much that I would consider ""delicate"" about this beer, and so any of the qualities I would be looking for in a pale lager are essentially hidden. That said, I enjoyed this beer and would certainly try it again."

"O - This is a great IPA/lager combination! If I did a blind taste, I would call this an IPA. The only thing preventing this from being DIPA status is the lighter mouthfeel and alcohol content. A really solid beer that I had my doubts about, but was proven wrong very quickly. I would grab this one all day long if it was available in my area, but sadly it's not. So a big thanks to Jageraholic for letting me expierence this great brew! Great extra, cheers to you my friend!"

"This is not your dad's APL. An interesting blend of styles that works. The crisp lager flavors compliment the hops. Dry, crisp low end with juicy tropical up top. This is a winner for sure."
""
"This brew profiles very much like an IPA but categorization aside, the hops are the main event and in this regard, this beer kicks ass. At the outset (and probably 5-10 degrees too cold), the finish was a little thin and lacking body. As I write this, the finish has filled out more and the maltiness balances things out very nicely. Delicious."
""
""
""
""
""
"Damn it. I thought perfect was a dream. This is one of America's finest beers. I've imbibed many a growler from the brewery in Framingham, and hope that folks elsewhere will discover this superfine ale. A hophead delight! If you're in the area, visit Jack's Abby. Knowledgeable folks and brilliant brewers."
""

""
""
""

"Overall this is one of the most flavorful lagers I have ever had to date and clearly well crafted and the recipe must have been tweaked many times to arrive at such a great, hihgly drinkable balance. High marks for this one."
""
""
""
"If I had to pick on this beer for one thing, I would comment on how it's rather odd how hard it tries not to be a lager. But it is. And it's tasty. The oily, earthy aftertaste kind of tires my tastebuds, but the bottle size is quite ideal. Definitely worth a try."
"An excellent representation of an uncommon style. All hopheads should seek this one out. Comparable to an IPA but less aromatic and a little more modestly flavored, yet extremely delicious."

"O- crisp and dry, a well hopped lager. This is my staple local everyday drinker for sure."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This was solid, but it was definitely hyped up in my head as being the best lager in the world. While it was very easy drinking and I would have again, I wouldn't put it in the upper echelon."
""
"O: Really enjoyed this. Wish I could stock my fridge with this beer this summer. I hope to get to drink it again... either that or that my favorite local breweries (looking at you, Pipeworks) would start perfecting their own IPLs. Great beer!"
""
""
"O - it's a great example of a IPL, a style I wish more breweries would tinker with."
""
""
""
"O: An impressively hoppy lager with huge aromas of citrus and a crisp, balanced taste. Great price point to boot. More than worthy of a purchase"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- good beer, but very bitter which makes it more dry than I would like. Leans more towards bitter pine, grassy notes than the citrus."
""
"O- It looks and smells good, tastes OK, but has no body. It needs an element to tie it together. It is a light tasting lager one second, then a hop bomb the next. Not bad, though."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured into a 13 oz tulip glass, bottled on 2/12/13 FRESH! Pours a light orange, with a fluffy white head, that leaves plenty of lacing. Smell is earthy hops, citrus, cut grass, lemon, and hints of biscuit. The taste is similar, starts subtle with a grapefruit and lemon bittering finish. Body is almost medium, plenty of life, a little dry, and easy drinking. This is a nice beer and different than most."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - The best IPL on the market. Great beer and a must try for all beer lovers. Excellent job Jack's Abby."
""
""
""
""
"O-a great lager beer with nice IPA characteristics and good balance, great drinking beer"
""
""
""
""
"Wow! Very solid brew here. It doesn't really exhibit the normal characteristics you'd expect from a lager, mainly because the identifiable yeast flavors are mostly covered up by the hops. You could easily mistake this beer as an IPA. The only real tell-tale sign is the dry, crispiness in the end. Nevertheless, this one shows exceptional balance and great execution for a very drinkable, hoppy-ass brew."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a clear, light golden color with an impressive white head. Speaking of impressive, the nose on this lager is a big surprise. Grapefruit and pine a plenty. A nice medium-bodied mouthfeel that has adequate carbonation and dryness at the finish paves the way for grapefruit, pine, and floral flavors make this extremely drinkable lager very tasty."
"Aroma is simply amazing...I was not expecting this! Crazy cotton candy and pine hop aromas with a crisp lager clean finish. Taste is very similar...sweet candy and pine hop, some pineapple. There is a certain crispness and hearty mouthfeel - must be the lager; but works so well with the crazy hop presence. Its not bitter at all but has fantastic flavor. Great great brew!"
"Overall - This was one refreshing and delicious IPL. I love the fact that it has the smells/tastes of an IPA with light body of lager. This is a very drinkable beer with little bitterness on the back end from the hops. A great beer that I recommend to all and I can't wait to enjoy the remaining bottles from the 4-pack."

"Overall this is a nice beer. I had it with my dinner and it has enough flavor to stand on its own against a nice thai curry, but it is also light enough that I don't feel full after drinking it. Glad I got the chance to try it, I will definitely seek out more Jack's Abby next time I visit relatives in the NE."

"Deep golden orange with a humongous frothy head that subsided to a tight layer with tons of lacing start to finish. Aroma was malty, earthy, some yeast, citrus fruit, a slight but of pine resin. The citrus aroma reminds me of lemon lime hard candies. Get the malts immediately on he sip, then a huge blast of citrus more grapefruit than the nose suggested. Earthy underneath, nice hit of bitterness, not overwhelming. Tiny bit of breadiness or yeast, slightly toasty. Flavor hits and passes quickly, and grapefruit and maybe mango linger just a bit. Very clean and refreshing, light on the palate. Finishes dry and makes you want more. The carbonation is light and refreshing. Very drinkable and can see this on a hot summer day. Subtle, complex enough to be interesting, well balanced. Another winner from Jacks Abby."

"Overall, a very tasty lager. Very refreshing and super drinkable, would be a treat on a warm day."
"Big thanks goes out to MSquared2 for sharing this one during one of our random Sunday tastings! Served from bottle into Sweetwater 15th Anniversary snifter. Poured a pale golden yellow with a half finger white head that subsided to a minimal amount quickly. Maintained excellent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, earth, earth hop, marijuana, fruit hop, and pine resin. The flavor was of sweet malt, earth, marijuana, pine, pine resin, earth hop, and spicy hop. It had a light feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this was a good brew. There were quite a few different components going on in both the nose and flavor of this one that really kept me on my toes. With having a few brews from this brewery that night I can honestly say that they have aromas pinned down. With just a little more robustness this could definitely be a standout for the style. I suggest you get your hands on some of these or other brews from them if you get the chance. You won’t regret it."
"O – This is a really nice lager. It’s crazy how these guys get so much flavor in these beers. You’d never think that they’re lagers. I’m not trying to badmouth lagers; it’s just that ales tend to have more complex flavor arrangements than lagers. Not so with Jack’s Abby. A major plus with these beers is that they still have the nice clean, refreshing feel of a lager with the vast range of flavors of an ale. Really tasty and drinkable beer."

"O – This is a great beer, and I completely understand the Hype. My only gripe is that a lager shouldn’t be so high in ABV. When I chose to drink a lager or pilsner I do it usually to not have such a high ABV beer. Notwithstanding that, this is a great beer and is incredibly drinkable."
""
"Overall: This is a beer I would choose over most IPAs. Just fantastic."
"Golden - mostly clear with a sticky, rocky white head. Plenty of visible carbonation with little bubbles clinging to the bottom of the glass. Really like the smell: grassy, weedy, lemony. I take a big easy swig and it’s very refreshing: earthy, crisp, and bitter, this can quench a thirst and a buzz. Nice finish though I could use a little more carbo. I love lagers so I’m lucky enough to live in the distro zone. Seek this one out."
"Overall: This one smelled fantastic but I thought the taste fell a bit short. It was still quite good, but I wouldn't call it fantastic. I'd have more to see if my opinion changes."
"Overall: Hoponius is the first India pale lager I have had and it was absolutely fantastic. The crispness derived from the lager yeast certainly make this one of the most refreshing beers around. It was 40 degrees Celsius today and this just hit the spot - I would kill for this to be my summer staple."
""
""
""
""
"I feel like this level of crispness and refreshment can be found in a top-fermented IPA. There's really nothing exclusive or interesting about this beer being an ""IPL"". I enjoy it, it's well-made, but at the end of the day, I reach for a lager when I feel like drinking something more traditionally German or Czech. When I want hops, I reach for a local, dry-hopped ale that can be consumed within weeks after fermentation, not months. If I lived in Framingham, I'd get growlers of this beer and be slightly confused, but pleasantly drunk. (3.5)"
"O: I was really excited to try this beer as I've heard a lot of good things about it. I have to say I was pretty underwhelmed by it. I'll definitely give it another try in a bottle, but it was a bit too thin-bodied and dry for my tastes."

"Overall these lagers Jack's Abby makes are some of the greatest beers today. Affordable and oh so delicious, the Hoponius Union is the kind of beer I wish I could drink more regularly."
""
"I’ll be blunt and open with the end of this review - Hoponius Union is exceptional. Jack’s Abby has certainly taken a step in the right direction with this beer, and other breweries could certainly learn from their ideas."

"This is a medium bodied brew with a modest amount of carbonation. It is earthy herbal and cheesy with plenty of bitterness and a veggie hop flavoring. I would have this again if the opportunity presented itself."

"So I guess this brew is an APL or an IPL... either way it seems to be an ""Ale"" inspired lager. Thanks to cbeer88 for sending this one my way. Appearance is slightly hazy and orange. Fluffy white head forms and retains nicely, heavy lacing left behind. The aroma features lemon, earthy, pine, and grass. Very hoppy with notes of cracker underneath. The taste starts with a touch of malty graininess followed by a touch of sweetness. Then comes a wave of hoppy bitterness in the form of grass and pine. It finishes off with more cracker and bread notes. Very nice range of flavors here with good balance. Mouthfeel is moderate with appropriate carbonation. Overall, this is a lager I could get in to. Definitely one to try for the hop heads out there."
""
"O - Big fan for many reasons - gratifying and very pleasurable beer from a MA brewery with some ingredients from MA. (Thank you, Kelly's Package Store!)"
""
""
"O - Jacks's Abby knows lagers and this is the best one I've tried from them yet. Takes the best elements of an Indian pale ale and a pale lager to create an incredibly delicious and sessionable beer."
""
""
""
"O: Despite the disappointment of the mouthfeel, this is a fun beer to drink with big time hoppiness in a leaner package."
""

""

"The beer pours a beautiful and lagery yellow with slight amber and golding, while appearing very clean in the body with a huge rocky white head that appears creamy and soft on top and leaves sticky patches of splattering lacing on the sides of the glass. Carbonation is steady but not torrential, and this beer looks nice and clean with the just the slightest hint of haze appearing in the beer. On the nose, this beer is everything you would want it to be; big and resiny, with a smell that just begs for the nose to be shoved in it. Sticky pine melds with faint lemon citrus, mango, passion fruit, big grassy notes, and a faint light hint of sweet biscuit bread. The beer has a great smell, and is probably the best lager I have ever smelled. On the taste, the beer is superb. It begins surprisingly malty with grassy and cereal notes before opening into biscuity malts and then big bitter hits and snuggles into the cavities of your mouth. Grass is huge in the hop flavor, providing perfect balance to creamy malts which linger in the sides of your mouth, even as the bitter bites. Pine and citrus also are present in the hops and provide lovely flavors reminiscent of a West Coast IPA. The mouthfeel is clean and slightly crisp with just the right amount of bitters to kiss the tongue even as the beer takes on a creamy feel as it caresses your mouth. The mouth is left dry and bitter on the roof of the mouth and on the tongue while slight trickles of saliva run on along the sides of the mouth. Overall, this beer is superb. A new style perfectly created. I have been hearing so many calls for an India Pale Lager from so many people in the craft beer world that I just figured it wasn’t doable, and yet here Hoponius Union sits as just that. IPA lovers should try this beer, lager lovers should try this beer, and everyone should try this beer! It is superb, and represents the perfect union and balance between hops, malts, and the clean-beer-feel that lager yeast creates. Just like this country is the perfect union of all that other stuff! Try this beer!"

"Overall (4.5): Overall, I’d say this beer kinda kicks ass. I don’t think I’ve enjoyed a lager this much since I was about seven deep during my sophomore year, and that was for entirely different reasons. It brings the hops in a very clear, balanced way: it’s not BLINDINGLY bitter, but has plenty of hop strength and character, enough to give lots of hop bombs a run for their money, flavor-wise. And the composition of the hop profile is excellent. As for the malt, it’s very well-done and balanced just right—bready, crackery, not sweet by any means, but solid and well-defined. And finally, it’s clearly a lager—a fantastic one. That fact that you can get 4-packs of 0.5l bottles of this for about $11 is almost criminal. If you see it, buy it and drink as soon as you can. Damn."

"A flavorful, hop-driven lager that is by no means boring. For beer, this may be the definition of refreshing."
"O: This is a really solid hoppy beer and definitely the best lager I've ever had."
"O: Hot damn, this puts all other lagers to shame. An excellent twist on the style, its like if an IPA bred with a Pale Lager, this would be its super offspring. All you lager haters out there, this will change your mind, I'm most certain. Cheers to Jack's Abby."

"O: I’m loving this brewery. This beer takes lager to a whole new level. Definitely a lager ipa, and freaking great at that. Definitely check this out. Thanks again, Michael."

"Poured into a Squatters True Pint glass a very nice cloudy dark golden yellow color, very nice carbonation, with a nice one-finger white creamy head, with some nice sticky lacing left behind. The nose is hoppy, malty, with a nice citrus note. The taste is hoppy, nice little touch of malts, and some citrus notes. Medium body, with a nice slightly dry/bitter finish. Overall a very nice brew. Thanks Bill!"
""
"Great beer! Not to compare to others, but I look at this beer as sort of a Heady Topper Jr. Similar hopping and flavor, just not as big in any aspect."
""
"I prefer a bit more hop assertiveness in my brew, but overall this is a nice, light drinker and a good beer."
""

"Cheers!"
"O: Very impressed with this. This is my first beer from Jacks Abby and I'm really happy to have gotten to try it. One of the most interesting ""yellow fizzy"" beers I've had."

"Jack Hendler, you knocked this one out of the park sir! A constant space reserved in this in the fridge for this, either bottle or growler!"
"d: Much more drinkable than I would have thought--almost too much so. I was expecting more of a bite. Still, if you're looking for a lager that tastes like an ipa, this is your beer."
"From the chilled bottle into the big tumbler I see a clear, golden light amber colored lager with a decent but broken fluffy white head with healthy lacing. The aroma makes itself known quickly from a distance with a decidedly tart citrus hop and biscuit base. Very impressive and unlike any lager I've had the pleasure of knowing before (other than this same brew on tap). The flavor is such a pleasure with more of the same biscuit and citrus hop blend and maybe some rye grain and light grass ideas. It's peppery, tart and clean with a light but lively carbonation that offers an effervescent feel over a medium body. More grass and grapefruit lemon pours over the tongue with quite some bite, especially unheard of for a lager but as the label explains, this is simply a lagered IPA and the unique flavors are definitely successful and worth a try."
"Pours a dark yellow with a frothy white head that sticks around for awhile. The smell is dominated by the hops, subtle citrus in there as well. The flavor starts slightly bitter up front with huge hops following. The flavor finishes bitter and sticks around through the aftertaste. A solid flavor that doesn't have many complexities and doesn't change much. A nice medium mouthfeel, almost heavy, like chewing on hops. This is a solid IPA, definitely like sucking on some hops. There isn't much more to this beer than that, but that is ok because it is done well."
"Palate: This could easily be mistaken for an IPA, albeit an unusually clean and light one. Bitterness is mild, but there are big hop flavors. It leans toward the floral side of things (centennial?), with a touch of citrus and stone fruit. There's a touch of coarse grain flavor, though it's a very dry, very hop forward beer overall. Within the IPL style, I'd say this is a notch below Humulus Lager, and probably Fathom as well, but it's a delicious beer nonetheless and I'd drink it often were it local."
""

"o - Overall I thought this was a fantastic hoppy lager. I've been pretty impressed with their beers and this might be the best one I've had so far. Tons of hops and fruit in the nose and taste, and pretty easy to drink for 6.7% ABV. Would love to have it again."

"Golden in color with a white head. A very nice citrus hop aroma and plenty of floral notes to go with it. There are some pine notes to it as well as a light grass note. Very little in terms of malt. The palate is on the dry side with a lot of hop flavor to it. Citrus fruit and peel, lots of floral notes, pine, and a hint of grass. Just a bit of biscuit and cracker malt flavor. Very well done."
""
"Overall I really enjoyed this, my only review of a Lager yet. The brewers up in the North East sure take brewing to a new level. Best Lager I've had."
""
"Notes: It's drinkable and the citrus notes add a good touch. Cheers."

"Clean, delicious and refershing. Love the idea of an IPL. It's almost like performing without a safety next because there is no fruity ale yeast esters to cover up any inbalances. Great beer and would buy again."
"Ah, yes. Perfect for IPA day.. I guess it is an IPL, but whose counting?? Refreshing for a hot summer day. A (near) perfect example of an IPL. Great style, becoming one of my favorite. Highly recommended."
"Flavor has some grainy sweetness, though light. There's lots of citrus here, with a hint of tropicality, too. Mostly, though, it's piney, pithy, resiny hoppage hitting the palate. Has plenty of bitterness, but finishes dryly. Would personally like a tad more balancing sweetness, but this is solid nonetheless. Prosit!"
"1484"
"Pours a hazy light orange with a foamy tan head that settles to a small cap on top of the beer. Foamy streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, citrus zest, and herbal hop aromas. Taste is much the same with a fresh hop flavor and a mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good beer that is tasty and easy to drink."
"Distinctive taste- superb when warming."

"Bites big and juicy in the front. Has that pungent (well, pungent ""taste"") right up the malty middle. Sort of cheesy, nutty, grainy. Trails out with a familiar, but pleasant, and mild grapefruit pith . . . that brings you back for more. There is a LOT going on in the taste and feel that I am inadequate at sketching out here. Slick and wildly drinkable. Just great. I can't believe I've had 5 beers, from a place I've never tried, and I've absolutely loved 4 of them. These guys are hitting hard!! More Jack's Abby!"
"O: You got to try this. The appearance and taste are both good, but the aroma and feel really bring this together. They've taken the best part of IPA and best part of Lagers and combined them to make magic."

"500ml bottle served in a cervoise. Pours a semi-hazy straw gold with a bright white, creamy half inch head. Nose is clean, light and bright and expresses citrus zest, a slightly earthy character and a hint of tropical fruit. Taste consistent with nose with the addition of some hops bittering that lingers between quaffs. Mouthfeel is light and lively with a pleasant, palate cleansing acidity. Overall, I'm not sure if I can rate this beer to style as I think it is a bit more of an Americanized version of the style; nonetheless, this is an excellent and extremely drinkable brew. I see a trip to the brewery in my near future."
"If I could find these easier, it would be my everyday beer. I just works on so many levels. It rings all levels on my palate, front to back."

"Overall: I will be seeking out this style during the warm weather months! I am really impressed by this East Coast Brewery. Great beer!"
"500mL bottle. Pours a hazy golden ornage color with an inch of thick, frothy head. Lots of lacing. Big hop aroma. Grassy and citrus hops. Slightly tropical as well; maybe mango. The taste is a bit more subdued than the aroma but its still hoppy. Grassy upfront with some citrus notes. Hints of the tropical fruits. Bitter, grassy finish. Orange peel aftertaste. Creamy, crisp mouthfeel. This tastes like a hopped up Lager. Overall, certainly worth having again."

"O: This is the first beer I've had by Jack's Abby, and boy is it a winner. The use of the lager yeast here really puts the raw hop profile front and center, with no distractions. It's American hops as you've never tasted them before. A hop-head's delight, and a very interesting and most welcome change of pace."

"O - Not my cup 'o tea. Just too hoppy and over-the-top to enjoy much of. I opened a Pliny the Elder directly after this and it seemed to be more balanced and enjoyable then this beer, which says a lot to me right there."

"Wow all around. This beer is clean, tasty, and full of flavor, but not so overpowering that you couldn't session a couple of them. And the best part, the pint bottle runs 2.95 at my local. 2.95 for a spectacular, local craft! These guys are a bit under the radar right now, but not for long. Get in now so you can say you were there when..."
"O: Great brew, I believe the hype. Has the hoppyness of a big west coast ipa. Great body, complex, very ""bright"" tasting. Never had a lager quite like it. Get some fresh!"
"Pours a clear yellow-orange with a medium white head. Smell is a nice mix of citrus hops combined with a more traditional lager aroma - very interesting, but doesn't stand out. The flavor, however, is a different story. The blend of hops here is absolutely incredible, and the lager base really supports it so much better than I could have expected. It's a great citrus hops flavor, and I would never know it's a lager flavor-wise, as it tastes more like something along the lines of Zombie Dust. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied with nice carbonation. Overall, this beer is incredibly impressive, quite unlike anything I've ever had before. The best hoppy lager I've had."

"Poured on-tap and served in a tumbler pint, the beer is a slightly hazed, steadily carbonated, copper-golden coloring with a low profile, thin, off-white filmy coating. Aromas of resiny hops, with basil and hemp characteristics, as well as a slight peppering. Flavors are hop forward, with that heavy pepper/basil combo blasting the tastebuds. Light toasted backbone supports the hops presence, and the beer is light bodied and smooth in mouth. Great cling along the glass as you go. The aftertaste is light and bitter, with a slight floral highlight. Resiny, bitter finish, with the clean feel typical of a lager. Very tasty."
""

"This is an insanely good beer that lives up to my expectations and would be outstanding on tap. I would definitely try this beer again considering its reasonable price, local availability, and the unique style it offers."
"O/D-Absolutely love this beer. It is so unique but does not sacrifice incredible flavor in order to stand out as a uniquely crafted brew. Shockingly hoppy. Also, a half-liter bottle comes in at $2.50. What an absolute steal. Jack's Abby is amazing. This beer really made me happy."
"You gotta try this."
"This is a very smooth lager with a strong hop bite, which takes this beer out of the style. Nevertheless, this is an exceptionally easy-to-drink beer. The aftertaste Is a long lasting bite of bittering hop. The body is rich for a lager, but the carbonation provides decent balance."

"O: Great brew. It's like one of the best IPAs I can think of, but it has the smoothness and drinkability of a lager. It's the best of both worlds. Really tasty and goes down easy. What else could you ask for?"
"This is an excellent beer. If it didn't say it was a lager on the bottle (or the tap list when I've had it on draft), I would think it was an IPA or a highly hopped APA. It drinks very clean and seems to have no room for error. The fact that it's as good as it is shows the craftsmanship that has been put into it. Definitely a beer I'll be returning to over and over."
"O- This was definitely an interesting brew. A mix between a lager and an IPA. On the bottle label they say that they use lager yeast fermentation while the beer is cold and then age it with west coast IPA hops for extended periods of time. This definitely creates an unique flavor that is a mix in taste between your typical lager and a west Coast IPA. It smells just like your typical West Coast IPA and has the citrusy taste but also has the typical lager taste. At first I wasn't sure if I was too excited by the taste of this beer since it was a little bit different then I was expecting it to be, but it definitely grew on me and by the end I really enjoyed it. I would definitely recommend giving this beer a try and I'm sure you will enjoy it."
"O - Shhh, this lager thinks it's an IPA (don't tell it). I haven't had a lager this hoppy since fresh Southern Tier Krampus. Never heard of this brewer before and I'm already looking forward to next year's batch. Very unique and dialed in for the hoppy IPA heads. Very well done!"

"Pale yellow in color. Has a hint of hop/citrus aroma. This beer has a nice balance of maltiness, bitterness and aroma hops. The citrus hop flavor is fairly prominent relative to typical IPAs, which I like very much. The light carbonation made this smooth and easy to drink. Very good, overall."
""
"Overall: A nice and smooth lager. This one is a lot hoppier than others in the style. Better as a beer than for the style. A sipper that I will get again but one per sitting."

""
""
"Mouthfeel: Clean and smooth mouthfeel with a decent medium carbonation (I do feel that the beer could have a slight bump in carbonation level). I love the dry finish, which really helps the hop flavors pop towards the end."
"The beer is clear and golden hued with a small head that leaves sparse lacing on the tulip. Lots of fresh hop character in both the nose and taste. This drinks much more like an IPA than a German lager. And while this beer is tasty, it does lack the distinctive characteristics of a Dortmunder lager. The body is light and the finish is dry, offering a hint of lager yeast. Overall, a tasty brew. Easy to drink and flavorful, just don't expect an authentic example of the style. I would definitely have this again."
"Pours a clear golden amber with a thin white head, quickly fading to a thin collar and no lace. Clean, dry aroma with a subtle hop bite, mildly fruity, with light yeast. Medium thick body with soft carbonation and a bready, biscuit finish. Slight fruity sweetness from a strong hop bitterness. Not quite a real dortmunder, but an expectional lager/IPA hybrid. Really enjoyed this."

"Pours a clear light golden color with a nice white head and some spotty lacing as it goes down. Thin collar throughout. The nose brings some nice tropical fruits with a bit of citrus and resin there as well. The flavor profile is along the same line and is really fantastic. Beautiful fruits and a nice hoppiness throughout. Moderate bitterness throughout and a dry finish. Body is fairly light. Finish is fantastic. This is a very, very impressive beer."

""
"Chewy pine resin with clean floral finish. Makes me want to drink another. A very fine beer."
"It tastes as good as it smells, and its actually pretty hard to tell its a lager. A touch of initial sweetness turns into a manageable bitterness in the aftertaste. Very well constructed, this was smooth and flavorful. I could definitely go for a whole lot more of this beer, surprised I never heard of it before. I'll have to try to stop here sometime in the future!"

"On tap at Stone's Public House in Ashland. Served in a standard pint glass. Bright yellow color. Nice white head. Good amount of carbonation. Great hop aroma for a lager. Taste was surprisingly good. Well balanced hop flavor, but not overboard. Amazing they can pack that much hop taste into a lager. Mouthfeel was smooth but crisp. This is a really great beer, and it's easily their best offering I have had to date."

"I know this beer is a lager, but... come on.... this beer is a pure resin IPA (sans the ale yeast). Kudos to Jack's Abby for showing the world that not all Lager's need be boring macro land.

"This beer runs rings around Prima Pils IMO. Seek it out."
"I like this beer quite a bit. Additionally, I know learn the brewery is in Framingham. Since this is the next town to where I live, I am quite excited. I’ll be looking to try more of their beers. Definitely seek this out."
"Overall, easily the best, most well rounded beer currently offered by jack's abby. I have a feeling that this one is the favorite of the brewer himself. It seems very well crafted and I can imagine the recipe was tinkered with for many many homebrew batches before we tasted it. Cannot wait for their wet hop lager coming out soon!!!"
"This was a nice treat from a brewery I had no clue existed."
"Not an overly hoppy beer for what it's supposed to be. My rating is sort of a balance between rating it a hoppy lager and an IPA, I guess. It's really an IPA at heart. I doubt many people would think it was a lager if they didn't know. It came out pretty rad. If rated like an IPA, I think I would have to say it's missing that extra level of depth in hop flavor that the big West Coast style ones have. Nevertheless, I will be filling up my growler every time I hit up the Natick mall for some fresh kicks."
"Going into the Metrowest area anyways why not stop by a brand new brewery. Crystal clear and a vibrant yellow/gold. Big bubbly head about two-three fingers high. Nose is fresh, floral hops. Smells like I just cracked open a bag of whole flower (cascade?) hops. Light grainy malt background but that is dominated by the hops. Flavor is just like the nose. Grains are popping out more crackers and biscuit but then the hops just wash over all of it. Fresh flowery hops and a lot of lemon/lime A sweet tartness but overall it light and crisp, very refreshing. They called it a India Pale Lager at the brewery."
"Overall good, great hop flavors but overpowers the nice lager underneath, and a weird finish as well as a bit astringent."
"O - Overall I Enjoyed this beer. A very nice hoppy beer with a good crisp bitter finish."
" If you're around the Framingham area stop in and try this one (and their other offerings) plus the guys are super friendly."
"O- Very impressed. This is hoppy, like an IPA, but very clean. Awesome job on dry hopping. The nose is fantastic, very dank and awesome navel orange smell. This is something that I will be going back to get another growler of until the bottling line is in place next year."
"Medium bodied for the style, light overall. Finishes dry. Dangerously drinkable as the almost 7% ABV sneaks up on you."
