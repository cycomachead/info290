As a native Pennsylvanian, I know how hard it CAN be to use lager yeast and since we have centuries of experience, PA lagers are some of the finest outside of Germany and the Czech Republic, IMHO. That said, I tend to be hard on craft CANned lagers. I got a finger of foamy, bone-white head with moderate retention from my pour. Color was a pale yellow with NE-quality clarity. Nose was lightly grassy, leading me to wonder what happened to those lovely hops, along with a very characteristic honey-like lager sweetness. Sofa. Sofa, so good, because when I CAN smell the honey characteristic of the malt, it means that NO adjuncts were involved. Mouthfeel was medium, about right for the style, and I got grassy hops on the tongue, but not as prevalently as I might have liked. Finish was both grassy and slightly metallic. It was not a bad beer, per se, but as a lager, it was found by me to be lacking. Keep tweaking this one, fellows.","woodychandler","Aug 03, 2013"

By that I mean that they want simplicity, bold and easy to identify flavors, and constantly are seeking to "one-up" the beer they drank yesterday. Thus a mild flavored, low ABV, easy drinking beer such as this will score low. What if Upslope intended to keep everything mild mannered? And if so, why is that mandate a low score? I digress. This beer could almost pass as a kolsch as it is fruitier and slightly sweeter than the standard lager. Warmer fermentation perhaps? Either way, this is light, drinkable, and quiet tasty.","allforbetterbeer","Feb 14, 2013"
