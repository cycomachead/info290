Crisp, malty aroma has a sweet and fruity overtone, mainly pear. Flavor is crisp and malty with a grassy hoppy undertone and more than a hint of fruit. Smooth texture has good body and a fine fizz.

4,9.9,,,,,,"Poured a semi-clear golden body with a thin cap of white head that quickly dissipated. A classic looking lager, true to form and quite nice. Scents of lager yeast, Pilsner malt with a soft sweetness, fresh cut grass hop aromas, spicy, floral hops at lower, but discernible levels and a light sulphur aroma like in some German Pilsners. Overall impression of aroma is of a classic American-style Pilsner that comes across much like its German counterparts in aroma, with a nice balance of sweet malt and classic Noble hop style aromas. Very nice. Flavor begins lightly bitter with a grainy and softly sweet malt presence balancing and floral, spicy Noble hop flavors. This moves into a medium bitter middle with notes of grassy, floral, spicy Noble-like hops and a light sweetness from malt and a graininess. Finish is medium-dry with the Noble hop flavors continuing alongside light grainy malt and biscuit-like malt. Aftertaste is grainy and biscuit malt with a medium level of floral, grassy, spicy Noble hop bitterness. Overall impression of flavor is of a crisp, flavorful, straight forward Pilsner. It doesn't have a wealth of complexity, which is perfectly fine for the style. It is simply a straight-forward, easy to drink, classic beer. Mouthfeel is medium-light bodied with moderate carbonation and a smooth, creamy feel. Overall impression of mouthfeel is of a classic, true to style American Pilsner. Quite nice. Overall this is quite the nice treat. It is a crisp, refreshing, simple American Pilsner that is flavorful, fairly aromatic and quite pleasant on the tongue. It is very well executed and a fine example of a classic, and rather hard to find, American style. Highly recommended.","Auraan","Nov 08, 2014"

The malt comes across as crackery and the hops have some herbal and floral character. While both are present in the aroma, they are not strongly so; both become more apparent in the mouth. The sweetness of the malt is light; the beer leans more to hoppy bitterness. While not a flavor bomb, it also is not dumbed down. I find it tasty, to style, and quite refreshing.","pweis909","Nov 03, 2013"

Mild cloudiness to the otherwise brightly glowing yellow hued liquid, scattered tiny bubbles throughout. The nose has a sharp profile to it, salt and pepper along with sour lemons and a pinch of dried lawn grass, more earth than dough or bread, barest hint of apricot but no real fruit presence nor is there anything you’d really call sweet per se, deepens into the nostrils well. Medium-bodied, highly carbonated but tightens up into little pinpricks as it progresses through the palate. Grains, grass, earth, minerals and iron flecks predominate, more biting and bitter than fresh, although does invigorate. White grapefruit joins the lemon citrus and a slight uptick in the apricot, peach, red apple fruit department. Some sourdough to rye bread notes. Hard to discern a meaningful sweet malt presence.

3.35,-8,3.5,3.5,3,4,3.5,"The summer season for pilsners kicked off this year with Avery's Joe Pils, canned for your camping convenience, and wrapped in aluminum for easy chilling in your refrigerator, a stream or a lake. Wherever you take this beer, this beer takes you to a wonderful and cooling place, crisp and lively with all the flavors of summer. The head is light and fluffy, like a rolling summer cloud, with an intensely cloudy body reminding me more of a witbier than a crystal clear pils. The aroma has a light touch of hops, more assertive than other pilsners, light and crisp and refreshing even in the nose. It's a medium bodied beer, with a sharp carbonation. The flavor starts with a bite of flowery hops, carried by a roiling stream of carbonation. The pilsner astringency is well matched against an alcohol bite. Also, not a touch of skunkiness or sulfur. I suspect the opacity of the can helps here, but whatever the reason, this is a local and very refreshing take on a classic and cooling style.

3.72,2.2,3,3.5,4,4,3.5,"In the pint Avery's pilsner looks light straw gold with barely a whimper in terms of even a cap on tap, looks rather dead, no stick because there is nothing to stick. Smell is fairly simple, earthy with noble hops out the wazoo and some pale malts in there. The taste is str8 forward simple, floral with German hops and American abundance of volume in using these hops, in a word, alot. Pale malts. Light bodied and refreshing after a brisk walk in NYC. While not carbed up in looks, this beer is certainly not dead, crisp. a great simple beer.","BARFLYB","Apr 27, 2011"

4,9.9,4,4,4,4,4,"The beer pours a very light, clear yellow color with a white head. The aroma is that of a basic pilsener. I get a lot of pils malt as well as some grain notes and a little bit of grass. The flavor is heavy on the pils malt along with some grass and orange citrus notes from the hops. I also get a little bit of spice and the bitterness is low to medium. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. A very nice American-made pils.","Mora2000","Apr 22, 2011"

I suppose the malt is a bit more grainy and dry than a German pils. I love a good IPA or pils, but the bitterness here is just a touch close to astringent. Otherwise this is a heck of a pilsner.","tempest","Mar 05, 2011"

And indeed it proves to be quite tasty, not too mention surprisingly full-bodied. Crisp and easy-drinking, but those hops are quite potent, earthy at first, then quite bitter in the finish. As a pilsner, this would get decent marks. As an American pale lager, it's pretty damned good.","PDXHops","Mar 02, 2011"

3.73,2.5,3.5,3,3.5,5,4.5,"Overall: I think Avery achieved a good balance that helped me answer the questions I stated above. This beer has elements of European lagers, but it is distinctively unique and way better versions of BMC swil-style adjunct lagers. It has a sweetness that is subdued and a hoppiness that is strong enough to achieve balance, but not take over. This isn't a great beer, but it is a good beer.","soze47","Feb 28, 2011"
3.23,-11.3,4.5,4,2.5,4,3,"OK Avery, I hope you are reading this. I know there is a huge hop following, and many hop heads all over the place, and there's a big contest for who can bitter their beer the most, or cram the most hop profile. But there's a time and place for hops, and a hop profile for each style. I understand trying to break down the walls and expand the various styles, but this is just overboard. A nice pilsner with some light noble hops, something like Noble Pils actually, adds a nice touch to it. This, however, i just waaay to much. I'm a hophead actually, I love hops in many ways, but when I'm drinking a pilsner, I don't want my hops to overpower it so much I think I'm drinking hop juice! A pilsner is delicate and sessionable, a summer/spring beer mostly, but this just smacks it in the face and drags it out to the curb to be runover by the bus and have the neighbors dog piss on it, piss a golden shower of hops... OK maybe a little too much imagery, but seriously, too much!","jlindros","Feb 27, 2011"

3.25,-10.7,3.5,3.5,3,3,3.5,"Even calling this an "American Pilsner" is a misnomer. This is a lager that has a bit of malt but lacks the hops and crispness of anything remotely resembling a pilsner. With that said, this wasn't a terrible beer and had no obvious flaws in the brew process. I wouldn't have a problem with this beer if it were simply classified as a pilsner; however, Avery decided to use "pilsner" in the name. I think it's better-classified as an American Pale Lager, which has been done here on BA.","Thorpe429","Feb 22, 2011"

The Glug looked like pale yellow (ahem!) running into the glass, resulting in two fingers' worth of fluffy, bone-white head with great retention. Color was a slightly hazy lemon-yellow, in total, it resembled lemonade. The nose danced, no, sparkled with grassy, lemony Noble hops. Hot damn! Yep, PapPap's beer would have been the Prohibition- era (or after) swill that we are still stuck with. Mouthfeel was medium but the hops were unencumbered, filling my mouth and sinuses with a grassiness that made me long for summer (or the next visit to my dealer). I initially pooh-poohed lager-style beers until somebody turned me onto classically- made beers, vice AALs. This was fantastic! Tasty, dry on the finish, refreshing, no off flavors.

Light malt biscuit cracker barely any sweetness noticed. Super dry finish, upfront barrage of green hops from the can. A nice flow with each gulp a couple of these cans could vanish so easily. Nice cracker light pale malts provide just enough sweetness with a big bitter hop profile with citrus/grassy/herbal accents kicking around on the palate.
