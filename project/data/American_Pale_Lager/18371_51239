4.22,7.4,4.25,4,4.5,4,4,"First beer from Pretty Things, has a faint aroma of grass and earth with some bread aftertones. Really nice flavor profile for an ale, has a bit of a heavy aftertaste/hoppy feeling that's carried by the relatively high ABV for an ale. Drinks really easily though and overall is a great beer I would have again. Love the marketing as a ""lawnmower beer"" - the beer you should enjoy while mowing the lawn. Well said, and encapsulates a lot of what this beer is.","TheHudgeSF","Dec 30, 2013"
3.94,0.3,4,3.75,4,4,4,"Poured into a Dogfish Head pint glass. Pours a light golden amber with active carbonation that keeps a one finger creamy white head growing slightly in the glass. Aroma of sweet pale and biscuit malt with light grassy hops. Flavor is biscuit and crystal malt with grassy hops, finishing with a mild cream corn and lingering pilsner style hop bitterness. Medium bodied with a nice mouth feel. A well made light lager that has a nice hop bill that is complemented by the full biscuit malt body. Not an exciting style, but as usual for Pretty Things, nicely made and great to drink.","LiquidAmber","Dec 13, 2013"
3.61,-8.1,4.25,3.75,3.5,3.5,3.5,"thanks to drlovemd87 for hooking me up with YET ANOTHER wonderful beer, this guy deserves a medal. better than your average summer type lawnmower beer, this is sweeter, richer, and far more malty. its nose and smell match its color wheel pinpoint, where yellow just begins to melt into brown, dim but lively. heady and lacy and fit for some white summer wedding. the smell and taste are decadently malted and only bittered on the hop front. its definitely a lager too, with a bready and dry quick finishing yeast that hints at old school european stuff. grassy hops round it out, but yeast and sweet malt are whats memorable for me here. my critique of this beer, and it is indeed substantial, is the 7% alcohol by volume. such strength is not useful in this style, makes it heavier, and honestly sacrifices some of the better properties of a good lager to pursue such strength. the beer works in flavor, but bomber is a tough dose when you are flying solo, and when you want to jump around beers and styles, this gets a little chewy, but its a cool brew, i just wish for reduced residual sweetness and booze, not that i can taste the alcohol, but i can feel it, and with all the sugar thats still in this beer, it gets a bit terminal. that said, these guys are clearly brewing some of the best beer in mass, and i am grateful for the opportunity to drink this one. not really late december beer, but nevermind that.","StonedTrippin","Dec 11, 2013"

3.98,1.3,4.5,4,4,3.5,4,"That's this tasty beer. Beauty of a poor -nice head, nice retention, straw/golden yellow, tiny seltzer-like bubbles constantly making their trip. Sweet grassy nose; mainland Europe noble hop presence. It's more of a BIG adjunct in flavor, even though it's all barley, and even though it's a bunch of hallertau. The sweetness of the malt just reminds me of that corn sweetness you get in some adjuncts. Super pale lager, maybe strong lager should be the style? It's fantastic, but there is a bit of a viscous texture combined with that sometimes corn syrupy sweetness that makes it not as refreshing as the style typically can be. 7% is a tall order too. Anyhow, get one of these if you're at all interesting in the ""yellow"" side of lagers.","CheezyBlaster","Jun 22, 2012"

Malt tastes are complex and shifty, thanks to the decoction mashing and the resulting melanoidin action. Tastes a little hot this year though, I don't remember the alcohol being quite as prominent when I had this in the past. Worth a try if you're into German-style lagers.","ryan1788a5","Jun 20, 2012"

Small bit of white pepper lingering in the background.

This one seems pretty average or maybe a hairline above average, but only malt and missing something of quality. Bittery malty flavor which leaves something to be desired in my opinion. All-in-all I am really not a big fan of Lagers and ultimately I could not get through the full bottle and have to give up just because drinking it reminded me too much of my BMC days and it just made me nauseous...but that's the style.

The aroma is sweet from the pale malt, some honey notes and a bit of grain husk. Light hop detected. Very one dimensional. The taste has some honey notes as well. The sweetness is slightly balanced by a grassy hop bitterness. There seems to be an odd spice or herbal characteristic to this brew which doesn't really work well with the malt. Kind of has a funk flavor to it. The hop profile is not bad but the malt just doesn't work for me. The feel is of a moderate body with fizzy carbonation; starts sweet but finishes with a grassy hop bitterness. Really not a fan of this beer. The malt seems too doughy and sweet and the grassy hops don't help enough. Perhaps if more of a citrus hop was used it would be better.","Gmann","Nov 09, 2010"

I'm always impressed with how this brewery continues to put out beers that are at the same time a great representation of the style, yet always a unique interpretation that pushes the boundaries a bit. This particular beer - the great American lager, but sturdy-ed up a bit and a nice nod to the lagers of Germany it seems. Like most lagers it's a pale yellowish straw color, showing a nice lively head, a good sign for the style. Lots of light doughy malts in the nose, something reminiscent of sweet cooked corn, and nice herbal hops, something of the Noble variety I'd guess. The hops are even a bit more out front at first sip, a subtle bitter finish. This is not necessarily a hoppy beer compared to others (IPA etc) but I do like the way the hops are a main characteristic of this lager. Along with a perfectly crisp malty goodness, this is perfectly balanced and a really delicious beer. Substantial on the palate yet uber drinkable and refreshing, even at 7%. I remember it was around last summer for literally about one week. Glad to see it's making a comeback and hopefully will be around a bit more, as this could easily be an all-the-time beer. I hope this beer inspires other US brewers to do some more artfully crafted lagers, because we need them here in 'Merica. Cheers to Pretty Things!","twelvsies","Aug 24, 2010"

The body is rather light, with a light carbonation and a fairly crisp finish.

4.53,15.3,4.5,4,5,4,4.5,"Drinkability is stellar. clean and refreshing, with a hop note that's just a bit more prominent than is usual for the style. A bit cleaner and this is a 5, but with the perfect flavor going for it, I don't think they want to change a thing.","JohnQVegas","Sep 12, 2009"
3.91,-0.5,4,3,4,4.5,4.5,"Pours clear and golden with very little head. Little smell at all. The taste is awesome. All the crispness and drinkability of a light lager with some extra hop taste and a lot of punch. The hop taste sticks in the mouth a little longer than I'd like given the style, but it's one of th emore drinkable beers I've ever had.","degerbah","Sep 07, 2009"
4.45,13.2,4,4,4.5,4.5,5,"M/D - Here's where this beer really shines. This has a fantastic clean and easy drinking mouthfeel that I could easily see myself getting a keg of to share with friends. Shame that I can't get more of this locally.","mwa423","Sep 06, 2009"
4.29,9.2,5,3.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"D- near perfect lawnmower beer. I would probably pick prima pils or a saison dupont over this, but I wouldn't turn this beer down if offered.","organicbrewer","Sep 03, 2009"
3.8,-3.3,4,4,3.5,4,4,"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 3/4"" bright white head over the clear pale yellow brew. Head falls at a moderate pace, eventually settling at an uneven but frothy in areas cap, with average to good lacing. Aroma is pale sweetness, with a light floral hoppiness. Taste is pale malt with lemon twinges, with crisp hoppiness coming on towards the close, and a slightly earthy aftertaste. Mouthfeel is prickly like you would except from a pale lager, with good drinkability. Good representation of the style.","ppoitras","Sep 02, 2009"

4.32,9.9,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"My first beer from PT and I was very impressed. This is a great summer beer. If you have a few of these I'm afraid you may do some irreplaceable harm to your lawn.","mjl21","Aug 25, 2009"
4.5,14.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Had a few of these up in the 1000 Islands in Ontario. Pours a golden color with a decent head. Smell is very pleasing with a fruity, malty twang. The flavor is excellent. I normally do not like lagers, but this has expectional taste. Perfect for a humid evening. Drinkability is excellent, but beware abv is 7% so you could be out of control quickly (Might be a good thing). Pretty Things is producing some great beer. Highly recommended!","ralflord","Aug 22, 2009"
4.27,8.7,4,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,"Bright, crisp and clear golden color with a steady stream of bubble of carbonation supporting a large, frothy off white head that leaves spots of lacing. Amazing aroma for the style, malt, slight ripe fruit, faint hops, and lemon grass. Fairly typical pale lager taste but actually rather flavorful. Slightly grainy, crisp malt background with a stronger fruit (sweeter than the aroma) balance and a strong hop kick in the finish resulting in a very clean, dry aftertaste. Body is light and refreshing with a fair amount of carbonation. Very flavorful and enjoyable, realistically a pale lager isn't exactly the most exciting style but for this quality not too hard to justify the price versus a 12 pack of whatever.","yourefragile","Aug 22, 2009"
3.65,-7.1,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,4,"D: Tasty, goes down pretty easily, not too filling, good kick, good representation of style, this is a solid and refreshing ""lawnmower beer"" that is worth pounding down for a long period of time.","TheManiacalOne","Aug 21, 2009"
4.27,8.7,4,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,"Mouthfeel is light bodied and crisp, making it nice and drinkable.","paco1029384756","Aug 20, 2009"

3.88,-1.3,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Notes: A nice pale lager for sure. As others have said one of the better American lagers and a nice alternative to import lagers. Has a personality independent from just a basic lager.","dpodratsky3","Aug 10, 2009"
3.86,-1.8,4,3,4,4,4.5,"D: Too strong to session but this is one of the better non german lagers that I have had. Their beers do not blow your mind but they are always good.","aerozeppl","Aug 08, 2009"
3.68,-6.4,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"22oz. bomber - Bottled July 2009, First Batch indicated on a paper swatch covering the cap. Served in a pilsener glass. Poured a translucent straw-gold with a two inch bright white cap with copious amounts of tiny bubbles effervescing from the base of the glass to the underside of the cap. Head eventually settles into a solid quarter inch cap - some spots of lacing present during the tasting. Nose is mild - just getting cereals grains and a light citrus character on this one. Taste follows nose; however, citrus really comes out in the front and leaves a residual lemony astringency at the finish. Mouthfeel is light-bodied and effervescent with some astringency lingering between quaffs. Easy drinking. Not my favorite style, but fairly tasty.","Jwale73","Aug 03, 2009"
3.8,-3.3,4,4,3.5,4,4,"My first reaction to this beer was similar to the other PT offerings I've tried: not bad, but not really so great as the stuff I've read about it. For a summer lager, it's got a rather high ABV; if you drink a bottle after you mow the lawn (as illustrated on the label), you'll probably be buzzed enough to be dangerous with the mower. That's a mark against it. However, the aroma is nice-- lemons and honey, grass and a bright tinge to it that reminded me of a Weihenstephan premium. The beer has a bubbly texture and a hoppy tang that hits nicely on a hot day, with more lemon and just a bit of malt. Overall, it's nicely subdued. Quite decent. If PT would lower the ABV, this would be nearly great.","gfreed","Beers"

4.28,8.9,4,3.5,4.5,4,5,"Drinkability - Excellent. The flavors that linger on the tongue after each sip beckon for the next drink. Can not believe this beer is 7%. Wish it came in a sixer, but the $5 bomber is hardly a bank breaker.","schinebd","Jul 23, 2009"

4.36,10.9,5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Final thoughts: another great one from pretty things, the hops are surprising for being a lager but very drinkable, especially for summer. They have been right on with every beer they make.","jlindros","Jul 16, 2009"
4.3,9.4,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"D - This is probably one of the best summertime lagers I've yet come across. Wonderfully crisp and refreshing. Not too light-bodied and watery, as it seems many summer-drinking lagers come across. I'm surprised a bit at the 7% ABV - the alcohol remains well-hidden behind the sturdy malt and hop profiles. Very well done, Dann.","vrazionale","Jul 16, 2009"
4.43,12.7,4.5,4,4.5,4,5,"Pours a nice clear yellow with a bubbly head. Nice touch of hops in the aroma, sweet on the nose. The flavor is outstanding, just enough body to give it some substance and a slight hop in the aftertaste. Just enough. This is just a really well balanced lager. Very drinkable. Definitely my favorite of the Pretty Things. It's really nice to see new beers keep pouring in. Keep em comin!","jfunkk79","Jul 16, 2009"
4.65,18.3,4,4,5,4.5,5,"I wish it came in 6 packs, and I could drink this all day. This could be a kegerator staple (if I had the option), and extremely approachable for craft noobs.","admiralcrunch","Beers"
4.2,6.9,4,4,4.5,4,4,"This is the newest release from one of my favorite new local breweries: Pretty Things. It looks as if this is their interpretation of a Summer lager. Pours a nice clear gold, with a large amount of white heading (which stays). Grainy start to the smell, followed by some biscuit, bread crust, and perhaps a touch of fruit. The Hallertau hops are the first thing I think of when sipping this beer, and they stay for the whole ride. The depth of malt complexity is very deep despite the big hoppy flavors. The tastes make me think of being outside; Very earth like and floral. Mouthfeel is crisp and refreshing, and despite being a slightly bigger lager, the alcohol is well hidden. Drinkability is top notch, and would make for a perfect Summer barbecue beer. This is another home run for Pretty Things (maybe my favorite next to Jack D'or). We need more great lagers like this that bring the good when it comes to the style.","jamie2dope","0"
