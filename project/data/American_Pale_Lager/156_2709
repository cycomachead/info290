3.83,17.8,4,3.5,4,3.5,4," The crisp malt begins the flavor portion with mild toasted grain and slightly noble tasting hops which give subtle lemony pith elements to the taste with a subtle herbal mild flavor. The citrus edge adds to the flavor since it gives a contrast to the sweet elements in the malt and the hops seem slightly spiced which gives the impression of a pilsner at that level almost since the yeast flavor is dry as it finishes it could go either way. I liked this since I found it to be a good american pale lager with some nice hop flavoring. This lager is good quality since there are flew noticeable flaws and it finishes rather smooth and quaffable.","Slatetank","Jun 10, 2011"
3.6,10.8,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"O: It has a good balance of malts and hops, and a nice crisp finish. A very good choice on a HOT summer day (the kind we get here in S. Florida everyday). One should not buy this beer and try to fing complexity in it. It's not characteristic for American Pale Lager.","SouthFLBeerLover","May 09, 2011"

All the flavors you would expect from a lager were there, and nice and light like they should be. This would make a good summertime beer, I could see drinking a couple of these while mowing the lawn or playing some disc golf. I don't know if I would buy a six pack of this, but it is a welcome addition to Tommyknocker's mixed six pack. I would recommend Alpine Glacier Lager to anybody that likes a nice light refreshing lager.","StoutHunter","Mar 02, 2011"
3.61,11.1,4.5,3.5,3.5,3,4,"Now, the nose was light and the taste followed but for what the bottle said it should be like it was spot on. biscuits, and earthy notes, lemon and honey. Some fruity, yeasty notes. The taste is light, not overly watery with a malt forward biscuit, bready front end with earthy hops in the back and hints of lemon. Very light, crisp, clean, smooth and refreshing. Clean finish. Very easy to drink.","JayS2629","Feb 20, 2011"

The taste was malt, hops, and spice with a little bitterness. The finish was dry with more spice and light bitterness. The mouthfeel was good with just less than medium in body with medium carbonation. Drinkability was also good. This is a good pale lager and worth trying out.","afinepilsner","Beers"

Nothing overpowering on the nose, just some regular lagered malts. Nice light pale malts are the main part of the taste, nice little kiss of hops as well.

A good drinking beer but a bit pricey for what it is.","MTNboy","Sep 18, 2009"

3.43,5.5,3.5,3,3.5,4,3.5,"This beer pours a clear yellow-golden color. The head is one inch in height, and recedes slowly into nice lacing. The bready malt, hints of toffee, and very faint hints of spicy hops. The taste more forthcoming than the aroma. The is the same bready malt with a lot more of a hops character. The mouthfeel is a little fuller than light bodied with appropriate carbonation, and a velvety texture. Overall, this isn't the more complex beer of this style I've tasted, but it is good enough that I find it enjoyable. I could drink this again.","KarlHungus","Apr 29, 2009"

Smells of some tart malt, sweet malt, slight hops, some slight pine notes, and some slight yeast cleanliness. Fits the style of an American Pale Lager. Mouth feel is smooth and crisp with a high carbonation level. Tastes of lager cleanliness, slight hops, some sweet malt, and some hints of pine causing a little dryness. Overall, a great improvement over an American Adjunct, though still lacking in body for my taste. This would be a good beer to enjoy in quantity, though.","Tone","Mar 24, 2009"

3.27,0.6,2.5,3,3,3,4.5,"Well, it's pretty drinkable, that's for sure.

If you're looking for a lager with taste I'd look elsewhere.. a little lackluster, but still better than a Bud or Coors.","oriolesfan4","Sep 20, 2008"
3.4,4.6,3,3,3.5,3,4,"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, beer is a slightly hazy, straw-yellow color with a thin, creamy looking head. The smell is pretty neutral, slighlty sweet with grainy malt. The flavor has the same sweet grainy malt with a decent hopping to balance, finishes slightly bitter. The mouthfeel is light in body with a touch of mouthburning carbonation. Drinkability is good just by the nature of the beer, light, crisp and easy to drink.

A good amount of hops in this beer but they don't really go anywhere. Some sour fruitish taste, but it does go down smooth and has a nice backbite.

For an all-malt lager, this is stunning...but as beer in general it's a little above average. This is one of those beers that doesn't stun you with complexity or bombastic flavor, but wins you over with it's easy-drinkin' attitude and general combination of flavors.

Mouth is on the light side but dosn't drift completely to watery. Overall this one is OK. Certainly better that BMC and a potential cross over beer for the non craft beer lover.

It is just a quality, easy drinking beer, thats what makes it great. Poured into a glass, the color was mostly golden with a hint of something a little darker. A one finger head was apparent for a short time, quickly becoming lacing which stuck around as I polished of the beer. The smell of malt was very prevalent, very little hoppy smell here. I can see where other reviewers get the grassy smell from. Upon my first sip, there was some carbonation that was evident. The taste was very crisp and refreshing. Finished clean and didn't hang on the tongue long. Left you wanting another sip. It has a medium bodied mouth full, nothing to heavy, but not a coors light/bud light feel to it either.

The taste has a very clean lager taste that is just amazing. It's very clean, and tastes like a perfect all-malt. For what this is, it's great. There's no noticeable hop character, but it works for this beer. I'm sure its there, preventing it from getting too sweet. The mouth is surprisingly thick, with very fine carbonation.

At the first taste, I thought it would be rather thin and boring--a bit more carbonation than I expected. But a few swallows into the glass I realized that there was a very pleasant, fruity hops flavor in the back that really put a nice zip into the beer. Not overwhelming, just enough to really make a refreshing taste. I admit I liked it. It would be an excellent party or session beer; and would be great for a summer BBQ.

Pretty seemless combination of simple malt and a good hop sense to start of -- slightly medicinal but fairly well-integrated and with a bit of oiled and conditioned leather.

2.43,-25.2,2.5,2,2.5,2,3,"This Lager scales new heights in blandness. Pours a pale and lightly fizzy yellow color with a thin white head. Aroma is barely detectable hops. Rather thin bodied and clean, with a weak hops flavor. Finish is crisp. I'd take this over a macro lager on a hot summer day, but that's about it.","Dogbrick","Beers"
2.98,-8.3,3,2.5,4,2,2,"This brew poured a very small head of fine white bubbles that quickly disappeared and a straw yellow weak looking typical lager body. Its aroma was that of a mild malt variety. Its ratgher weak hop flavor was nothing to write home about. A lack of character brings this ones ratings down.","TheDM","0"
1.91,-41.2,2.5,1.5,2,2,2,"This Lager poured a small white quick diminishing head with fine-small bubbles. The body is cloudy with carbonation and the hue is pale yellow. The aroma is fruity and sweet. There was fair lacing on the sides of my glass. It has a sweet hoppy taste and it is thin and watery in my opinion. There is nothing very special that I have to say about this brew as it lacks character.","hotstuff","May 05, 2003"
3.25,0,3,3,3.5,3.5,3,"Color is a medium golden yellow. Has some chill haze. Poured with very little head. Aroma is a light malt with perhaps a touch of apple. Taste is very clean and crisp. It could stand to be a bit more hoppy. Average carbonation. A non offensive aftertaste. Not a great brew, but still decent and drinkable. If the macros were more like this I would buy them much more often, which now is NEVER!! This one would be great an a hot summers night at the ball game.","sabrills70","Mar 07, 2003"
3.37,3.7,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,"Pours a clear, medium golden color, topped by a crisp white head. Aroma is very malty and clean. Very inviting, it begs to be tasted. The first sip is clean and malt-driven, with a slight sweetness as well. Very little bitterness, but a clean finish. A subtle fruitiness becomes apparent as you quaff. The mouthfeel is full for a lager, and the drinkability is decent. Nothing really outstanding, but a very good beer. This would be a great conversion beer, and if macros tasted like this, I'd always have some around the house. A decent session beer that seems like a lager/ale hybrid.","aaronh","Jan 31, 2003"
3.47,6.8,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"The smell is a slightly nutty lagerfunk. The front is sweetish. The middle is lagery, somewhat buttery and fairly full. The finish is crisp, bitter, slightly watery. Overall, this is an ok beer.","kbub6f","Nov 04, 2002"
3.45,6.2,3,3,3.5,3.5,4,"Pours a very pale light golden color with a thin white head. Looks a lot like a hard cider. Nose is light sweet malts and grains and is a bit herbal. Taste up front is sweet malts with a touch of honey followed by some citrus notes. Good balance of bitter hops in the finish. Light, crisp, and refreshing. A nice step up from the macros.","Morris729","Oct 29, 2002"
3.95,21.5,3.5,3.5,4,4,4.5,"Pours a slightly hazed pale golden color with a small white head that dissipates rather quickly.  The smell is mild as most lagers are but also has hints of hops that got me anxious.  This lager has some character.  Mild, yet lightly hopped and I can taste no adjuncts.  A good brew to bring someone away from the typical macros.  It has a light earthy and grainy taste along with the hops and finishes crisp and clean.  This is a light bodied brew and drinks down easy!  My review numbers are based on this style and although its not my favorite style, it is a good interpretation of a lager.  A very pleasant surprise!  Cheers!","BeerAngel","Oct 16, 2002"
3.28,0.9,2,4,3,3,3.5,"This beer is a very pale light golden with slight haze and no head.  Clean malt aroma with subtle notes of grain.  The taste is a notch up from your typical marco lager, but not that much better.  Some grain notes are present.  Fairly smooth maltiness.  Minimal amounts of hop contributions.  It goes down rather easily.  Almost like water, but with more taste.  It's not bad by any means, but not one I'll purchase again anytime soon.","Bighuge","Sep 03, 2002"
3.61,11.1,2.5,4,3.5,4,3.5,"Straw colored but cloudy....nose actually has a bit of a spicy hop note to it...taste is corny sweet...almost tastes like a honey beer....body is about right for this style...pretty decent for a basic lager...I'd drink it again...","ZAP","Aug 18, 2002"
3.69,13.5,3,4,3.5,3.5,4,"This lager pours a very light golden color with a white lace on the glass.  The aroma is sharp and sweet with hints of honey. The light flavor possesses a hint of malt on top of a sharp body with a very clean finish.  Light all around, but quite refreshing.","beernut7","Feb 06, 2002"
3.5,7.7,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"This beer's color is unlike any I have ever seen, a murky light brown color, resembling pear juice.  Lots of fine bubbles with a small off-white head, decent lace.  Aroma consists of herbal and botanical aromas.  Flavor begins with mild maltiness, which is soon overwhelmed by bitter citrus hop flavors, finish is clean and a bit dry.  An odd beer, all in all, perhaps its a bit old, as the date stamp is 03/12/2002.","Pegasus","Beers"
3.96,21.8,4,3,4,4,5,"nothing on their web site about this beer....clear golden color, pours a thin head that barely sticks all the way down.  has a medium body and a slightly grainy aroma.   well.....nothing special but it's solid and smooth and has some mouthfeel. for a lager it's very good and easily ranks at or above the budmgdhighlifecoorsmichelobpbrbuscholdmil conundrum.  my sixer was bought on special because it wasn't fresh but was still pretty good.","budgood1","0"
