Smell denotes the onset of undesirable qualities, but not really present in the taste. The beer I had was probably a couple months past the best before date, but has not gone bad yet. Similar flavor and feel to a Dos Equis Lager Especial, but less sweet and less crisp. Slightly watery, not as carbonated as similar lagers, but then, as I said, it's past BBD.","Libeertarian","Feb 28, 2015"

It seems like all Shiner beers have the same appearance with different colors. And none seem to have anything going for the nose. This one has nohing wrong with it, very easy to drink. But it also does not really have anything good about it. Basically, meh, easy drinking but, again, meh.","JamieDuncan","Beers"
