3,-13.5,,,,,,"02/06/13  On tap at Rattle n Hum, NYC. Pretty standard lager flavor but definitely more substantial body-wise. I look to lagers for a clean crispness that this lacks. Don't get me wrong, it's good, but kind of like a lager on steroids.","seedyone","Nov 10, 2014"
3.68,6.1,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"12 ounce bottle into lager glass, best before 7/12/2013. Moderate gusher upon opening. Pours lightly hazy deep golden color with a 1 finger dense off white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of lemon, pear, cracker, biscuit, light honey, herbal, floral, grass, light pepper, and yeast earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance of pale malt, earthy hops, and yeast ester notes; with solid strength. Taste of lemon, pear, cracker, biscuit, light honey, herbal, floral, grass, slight pepper, and yeast earthiness. Light earthy herbal bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of lemon, pear, cracker, biscuit, light honey, herbal, grass, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Nice balance and robustness of pale malt, earthy hops, and yeast ester flavors; with a good malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Fairly clean on lager flavors with only some light yeast ester notes present. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, crisp, and slightly creamy/bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with zero warming present after the finish as expected of 4.7%. Overall this is a nice pale lager style. All around good robustness and balance of pale malt, earthy hops, and yeast ester flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A nicely enjoyable offering.","superspak","Nov 07, 2014"

The hops are out in full force, especially for a lager, with pine, citrus, grain, and general dryness on the nose and mouth. Malt is minimal here. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with average carbonation. Overall, I can't say I'm impressed, as the hops make this a bit too dry and don't give it enough complexity. However, this is an enjoyable beer, a lager that tastes like a beer rather than an adjunct-filled macro brew. Give me a wider malt flavor and I'd be a happy man.","DeFaz","Aug 11, 2013"

This one pours a clear golden straw topped by a good amount of lightly off-white foam. The nose comprises grass, lemon zest, very light lime zest, flowers, and honey. The taste brings in more of the same, with a solid amount of biscuit in the background for the sake of balance. Frankly, I think this over-balances things (if that even makes sense), but it's still pretty solid. The body straddles the border between hefty light and light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a slightly drying finish. Overall, a solid Atlantic lager (I like that name for the style), one that shows that you can hop up a relatively low-alcohol lager and still make it enjoyable. We need more of these...","TMoney2591","Nov 10, 2012"

3.68,6.1,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"O - Flying Dog nailed it here. A session lager, keeping with the old school "no frills" lager beer that remains flavorful and easy drinking, but definitely exhibits quality with every sip.","EStreet20","Jun 09, 2012"
3.27,-5.8,2.5,3,3.5,3,3.5,"O: Flying Dog has done a good job of stepping their game up lately, and this is a very solid (if not quite exceptional) lager that's a big improvement over Tire Bite (which this replaces). Not my favorite by any means, but I'll gladly chug this one down while picking crabs.","ThisWangsChung","Jun 09, 2012"

3.7,6.6,3,3,4,4,4,"12oz bottle. Poured into a pint glass. Pours a straw gold with a thin white head on top. Minor lace globs left behind. The nose smells cheap, with mild graininess, husk, lemon-lime. Crisply carbonated mouth, but not overdone. Refreshing feel. Nice hop bite at the onset, faint bitter finish. Refreshing mild citrus tones back it up. With the low alcohol on this one, this is the perfect summer beer for me. I’ll be stocking up on some more.","Onenote81","Jun 08, 2012"
3.87,11.5,3.5,4,4,4,3.5,"Overall again Flying Dog impressed me with making a pretty nice lager. Those who compare it to BMC have had "one too many"","DrDemento456","Jun 06, 2012"
3.35,-3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,3,"O= better than a US macro only because of the hops florals and bitters, and more like a Macro Light with strong hops bitters.","therica","Jun 05, 2012"

3.78,8.9,4.5,4,3.5,3.5,4,"Overall nothing crazy here, but its definitely an easy drinker and one to enjoy on a hot summer day. Could be a bit crisper and exciting, maybe a touch more carbonation on the tongue? Either way, I'd say give it a try if you're in the mood for a decent spring or summer beer.","chodinheaven","May 25, 2012"
4.03,16.1,4.5,4,4,4,4,"Poured into a pilsner a clear light golden with a large fluffy crown that settled ever so slowly leaving multiple broken chunks of lace behind.Mild toasted grain,iron,and lightly sweet caramel malts in the nose,it's not a clean nose wich to me is a good thing.Toasted bready malt with some herbal hop notes on the palate,again mild caramle and iron finish out the flavor profile.This is a damn nice lager here,Iam gonna be drinking this on Monday while out grilling.","oberon","May 24, 2012"
3.83,10.4,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,"O: This is a great tasting and easy to drink beer for the style. I wouldn’t mind trying it at a summer picnic or as a lawnmower beer, especially since it is also available in cans.","metter98","May 23, 2012"

Sessionable and great for a summer BBQ with a mixed crowd. I wish we were getting the cans of this...","bump8628","May 09, 2012"

3.97,14.4,3.5,4,4,4,4,"Overall - crisp and clean with a sharp bite in the finish (not as painful as the bite occurring in the artwork below, see the can on the far left). You've got to hand it to Flying Dog for putting this one in cans. It should be a great summer brew and one that should appeal to the masses. So, if you've got some folks who are lager drinkers and aren't ready for anything else, see if they'll give this one a shot. It's certainly several steps up from some of those industrial cans filling a lot of summertime coolers.","indiapaleale","May 05, 2012"

4.13,19,4.5,4,4,4,4.5,"Pours a brilliant pale golden color with a bright white thicket of head forming so nicely. Aroma has a nice citric nose with biscuit malt character weighing with a nice bread dough appeal. Flavor has a nice grassiness evident hop backend with citric peel and grassy herbal qualities amongst a pale malt breadiness this is the best summer beer around right now. Light refreshing about the same alcohol content as a Bud Light, with actual hop flavor and bready grains. I fully approve of the sessionable alcohol level the label is a bit weird as smaller dog sitting on a barrel trying to bite some balls hanging down from a bigger dog. What the hell is Ralph Steadman drawing? I don't know about the art on the label but the art in the bottle is working just fine. Excellent beer pounding out much drinkability blended with enough citric hops to keep anybody interested in the good stuff. Carbonation is sturdy carries the lighter bodied beer very well, extremely sessionable and keeps you wanting another and another beer.","WVbeergeek","Apr 27, 2012"
