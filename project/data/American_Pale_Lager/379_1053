Not heavy whatsoever, a beer i could certainly drink all night.  A great intro to Moosehead Lager, my new favorite beer!  I drank 8 bottles and woke up with no headache whatsover, which tells me that clean, natural ingredients are used by the brewery.  Highly recommended!","JobiWanKenob","Thursday at 05:57 PM"

3.13,3,3.5,3,3,3.5,3.25,"this is one of my dads favorite brews, so naturally I have consumed my share of it. my issue with it is the green bottle, so when it shows up in the states, even in the northeast, it often has that green bottle skunk to it, really frustrating because this can be quite nice when its fresh. the color is clear straw colored, richer than other yellow lagers, and although the head fades fast, its tall and bone white. the nose often has a skunk on it, but shows a pale and pils malt base that's quite light, and the cleanness of patient lagering. the flavor actually has some hops to it too, a lot more than other American takes on the style. its clean drinking beer, very refreshing and has a unique malt flavor that sets it apart from its peers. the handling and packaging of it are extremely problematic, but when once in awhile a fresh sixer is found, it can be tremendously refreshing. it is occasionally proof that cheap yellow beer can be delicious. orders of magnitude better than the BMC stuff here in the states, even at its worst.","StonedTrippin","Aug 13, 2014"

AROMA: heavy dough and biscuit; hops are slightly aromatic;, but more corny than floral; enough tin to suggest a metallic base... PALATE: medium-bodied, refreshingly swift in the aftertaste; a bit grassy and slightly beefy... TASTE: beefy, meaty malts are strong and dominate the profile; subtler flowers include metallic water hose and, to a lesser extent, honey...

This is a great ""lawnmower"" beer as they call them. Not offensive in any way, easy to gulp down, but just not that interesting that I'd want to drink it all night. In fact, the very grainy finish starts to fatigue after a while and I start to crave richer barley malt. Sorry Stahl, this doesn't stand up to the German imports I can get... even if they aren't independent.","steveh","Feb 14, 2014"

Happened to be a few kicking around at last night's house party and it was early enough in the evening to actually focus on the characteristics and produce an acceptable review. Aroma was fairly fresh sweet grains, some fruity citrus esters, maybe a hint of herbal hops. More pleasant than expected considering the green bottle. I did not get much skunk, presumably thanks to this example being fairly fresh and properly handled. Palate was a bit interesting. There was too much fizz, way too much, but there was also quite a bit of lemon zest, a little peach, a whiff of floral vanilla. A lot of esters for a lager and these added something to the pedestrian sweetish lager malt backbone. Hops are buried deep, not really tasting them at all. Finish was sweetish but reasonably clean. Few obvious faults although things were a tad medicinal and this combined with the aforementioned lemon notes made me think of cold medicine like Neo-Citran or something of that ilk. Still, surprisingly unskunky and with some fresh sweet character than would make me sample again, particularly if the other options are the adjunct lager standards that usually appear at parties (looking at you, Lucky Lager).","CalgaryFMC","Nov 01, 2013"

3.1,2,3,3,3,4,3,"Pours a clear gold with a foamy off-white head that settles to a partial film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace slowly drip into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, and sugary aromas. Taste is much the same with sweet grain flavors on the finish. There is a very mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is an average beer that is drinkable but nothing too exciting going on here.","UCLABrewN84","May 25, 2013"

I have found it for around $11.99 for a 12 pack. If you don't like this beer then something is wrong with you.","Aretis","May 20, 2013"
3,-1.3,,,,,," The taste is lackluster for me, malty entry with stale grain and slightly sweet cereal-like quality with low spice and mild creaminess with light smoothness of diacetyl and husky grainy taste as it finishes semi-dry. Overall I could probably find a better lager, maybe just a tad above most mass produced pale lagers...there is a mild herbal hop in this that I like","Slatetank","May 20, 2013"

4.32,42.1,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Moosehead lager is my favorite canadian beer and one of my top lager choices. I consider it to be an adjunct since I believe corn is used in the recipe but not sure. Moosehead's bottling means 6 packs are prone to skunkiness, therefore stick with 12 packs. It is brewed only 150 miles away so it always seems fresh and enjoyable here. Appearance is golden with limited head that fades away. The smell is hoppy with floral overtones, some malt/grain. The taste has a very nice blend of distinct hop bite and crisp lager flavor. Mouthfeel is crisp and refreshing, very drinkable. Mooshead seems to be the only canadian brewer that still tastes like I remember from 20 years ago.","adjunctjonez","Apr 02, 2012"

Too bad I can only get it in the green bottle in my area because it inevitably comes off as skunked. The pour is pale to golden yellow with a fizzy white head. Trying to block the skunkiness out of my mind I can get a solid malty scent on the nose and some crisp clean but vague hop esthers. The body is light to medium and average for the style. The taste also has a creamy, maltiness to it with a bitter hop bite playing tag on the end. In the 1980's this was a beer I drank quite often. Times and tastes change but it still is a halfway decent Canadian pale lager on occasion.","puboflyons","Feb 27, 2012"

The Canadians did something right when the made this brew. Pour a little on you steak as you grill. The philsner taste will give your ribeye the extra edge you have been looking for.

Lots of stray carbs running up to the top of the brew, seeking escape. It has a very sweet, malty, and rag weedish aroma to it, sort of skunky, but in a good way. There could be some faint hop aromas amidst the rag weed, but it is hard to differentiate. This beer smells like what I considered beer to smell like growing up as a young lad. As for the taste, the base malt profile slams your palate at first, with a slightly sweet,tangy and bready barrage to the tastebuds, followed by a hint of citrus, although very faint. As the brew makes its way down, there is a slight, short-lived hop bitterness, quickly followed by an immense amount of carbonation that brings a moderate burn to the back of the throat, with a sweet aftertaste to mellow things out. With that being said, this is a great session beer when you are looking for something with a little more body and character than your average go to cheap brew, not too much going on overall, but a solid lager in my opinion.","jsdunlop","Dec 23, 2010"

Either that, or they are selling this stuff too cheap. It definitely stands up to beers in a higher price range, and is much better than other Canadian beers like Molson and Labatt's. The color is pale, the carbonation is fine, and the flavor is full without any bitterness or astringency. It's clean with a very slight citrus flavor and rich grain throughout. This is a perfect ""chugger"" if you're really in the mood for 3-4 good tasting beers in rapid succession. This would go down smooth any time and I can't think of any reason not to recommend it as a straightforward, high quality medium lager.

Received this one from a friend randomly around Xmas time, hope its not skunked (green and clear bottles are risky). Here goes nothing. Does not smell skunked, smells just like an American adjunct initially. Pours out about as clear as a beer could get. The only thing keeping it from being water colored is a faint yellow, almost golden tint. The pale white head actually has pretty good retention making this a decent looking beer. The only bad part is how unappetizing the pale yellow color looks. Medium lacing starts to be left as the head dies down. I really can't bash the appearance of this beer at all. Next comes smell. This beer just smells like Coors, Bud Light, Corona etc. I can't even describe the smell it is so strange, that of any cheap adjunct lager. Maybe just a bit lemony and malty, hard to describe but everyone that has had a cheap beer knows the smell. I do not enjoy this smell at all. It does follow the style/goal pretty well and I have to give it some credit for that. Taste brings me back to my very old college days, before Sam Adams and Sierra Nevada came into play. This one reminds me of a sweeter Coors with a tiny hint of citrus. The sweetness is hard to adjust to even on the first sips. Still, just a pretty common taste for a cheap lager. I have had worse and this one still follows the styles ways so I have to give it some credit on taste. The malt lingers around in the after taste. Mouthfeel actually surprised me a bit on this one. The carbonation is not overdone like some lagers of this sort and the body is relatively creamy and enjoyable. It goes down pretty smooth and feels pretty good on the tongue (taste not included). I am certainly not gonna lie, the mouthfeel is better than some beers I have had that were 2-3x the price of this. Drinkability is hard to describe. The beer is cheap and not filling at all. If I was given a ton of these to session, I probably would do it since I can block out bad tasting beer pretty well. I definitely would not buy one of these to do that though.

The nose welcomes you with a beautiful combination of sweetish grainy malt and herbal and floral hops. That combination carries over in the flavor where the hops really come into their own. Initially they seem more herbal, but as it warms a bit some of the more floral nuances appear. The malt doesn't appear as sweet as the nose suggests, and it's also backed by a solid bitterness. In combination with the crisp carbonation and medium-light body, the bitterness cuts through nicely. It finishes dry with some quickly passing, lightly sweet malt up front; a slap of floral hops; and then lingering herbal hops amidst a long-lasting bitterness.

Grains, bland malts and not much in the way of hops. Lots of adjuncts on the finish and in the aftertaste. This beer is pretty bad.","chaduvel","Nov 06, 2003"

3.5,15.1,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Known to people in New Brunswick as Moose Green (the label is green). A near perfect clear gold that has a small but aromatic releasing head. The smell of malt is very pleasant and you can taste it. But you can also taste the hops too. Feels pretty good in the mouth and is still refreshing after its gone down. It stands alone well on a summer afternoon or with a hamburger done on the BBQ on a cold January First. Its a better lager than most.","PiratePete","Sep 25, 2003"
3.6,18.4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"It's an over-all above average average lager, and tops any macro I've had on the market. Clear golden body, not much head. Nose is sweet grainy malt. Flavour is crisp sweet malt, with a hint of floral hops in there if you imagine hard enough. Refreshing, smooth, very drinkable. Straight and simple. A session lager for pool, darts or karaoke, it lets you focus on what you are doing rather than on what you are drinking--lets you get down to business.","IronDjinn","Sep 22, 2003"
2.26,-25.7,3,2,2.5,2,2,"Very pale gold color, small head. A light malt aroma. A medium bodied sweet tasting lager. There is some maltyness and some hoppyness but its masked by the sweetness. Very carbonated. Better than most of the Euro-lagers, but still not very good. I used to love this stuff, either my tastes have changed or this beer is really different. Mouthfeel is full. Finish is clean. Aftertaste is slightly bitter.","beerguy101","Sep 02, 2003"

2.87,-5.6,2.5,3,2.5,3,3.5,"This one looked like a normal lager but definitely not light which is good. Smelled sweet and nice. Taste is of generic malts and little hops.

3.6,18.4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"On-Tap: Color is straw gold, somewhat pale, thin loose white head with small spots of lacing. Smell is of fresh grains with good malted barley sweetness and clean easy hops. Taste is crisp medium maltyness, very clean, a bit breadish, hops linger in quickly with a small amount of bitterness and then leaves with a fresh drying grain texture that kinda pulls any harsh sweetness away lending a crisp, clean after taste. And since it comes in a green bottle; that harsh sweetness can be overbearing if its old and been exposed to alot of light, thats why I stick with it being on-tap. Its much fresher in this form and makes for some pretty easy drinkin'.","tavernjef","Jul 19, 2003"

3.48,14.5,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,4,"Huge snow-white head with modest carbonation and thick lace; crystal-clear medium golden color. Aroma is extremely skunky, so much so that my fiancee's cat, who was nearby when I poured this, wrinkled her nose. Also notable in the aroma is a strong grain component and slightly spicy hops. Taste begins with solid light malt flavors and a sweet, almost honey-like note, carbonation is quite smooth. Towards the finish there is a brief spike of spicy hops, there and then gone quite quickly. The finish is utterly clean. A smooth and wonderfully drinkable beer. This was a favorite of mine during college when I could afford it, just as good as I remembered it to be.","Pegasus","Feb 15, 2003"

Pours medium yellow with a good head. The taste is malty with decent hoppiness. Has a crisp, distinct flavor. A little skunk did not deter the experience. I liked this. I wish all macros tasted this good. I have also tried this from a keg and it is excellent. OH CANADA!!!","Rifrafboy","Feb 11, 2003"

3.78,24.3,4,3.5,4,3,4,"Slightly more rich and golden than straw in color, the beer was topped with a dense layer of fine white foam which was sticking slightly to the glass. It smelled very clean like pale malt and hops, maybe a little bit of husk too. Ill have to have another since I was a little stuffed up. Malt flavor was present which was a bit of a surprise given the style and what Ive had in the past. Bitterness, too, was at decent levels but without any lingering. The hop bitterness along with some alcohol dried out the finish making it a very enjoyable gulping beer. Compared to many other beers of the style, Moosehead is great.","yen157","Jan 29, 2003"

Again like in the aromas the flavors are of light hop and malt, and a bit of grain flavors. Moosehead is a very smooth, crisp, clean lager, which makes it go down really easy. It has more flavor than your average mainstream American lagers.","BeerBuilder","Nov 25, 2002"
3.3,8.6,3,3,3,4,4,"Before a good friend by the name of Hootie introduced me to the beauty of good beer with my first Hoegardden on tap at D's this was one of my favorite beers. I still like it but my no means or to any extent does it touch my top 40 list. Smell is a little grainy. Taste is smooth smooth smooth. I always thought its had almost a 'creamy' taste to it, but by reading the reviews of many other BA's, Im starting to think that just may have been me. Flavor is far more malty than hops; hop taste is insignificant. Mouthfeel is excellent and one of the highlights of this brew. Feels great on the tongue, palate, and the rest of the way down. Many people knock this brew as 'just another Canadien Import' but it is far superior to anything that comes into my distributor (while I may in defense say I am in Meadville where the public tend to have less teeth that grades of high school completed). It just makes no sense to me that this bottle is green; why take a chance of skunkiness? Also Ive tended to stay away from this brew to its price and the fact that well the same company imports this as Corona (could that be the reason for high prices?).","allboutbierge","Nov 20, 2002"

Although not at all complex this is an extremely smooth beer with a little character to please as well.  Mild carb bite in the beginning with maybe a hint of hops and grain contained in a semi-sweet maybe light to medium bodied brew.  Very drinkable.  Although this is a very simple beer, it is an ""easy-like"" beer, but just like music ""easy-like"" you tend to get bored with it sooner than one that has to grow on you.  Good beer in comparison to others in this style.  Cheers!","BeerAngel","Oct 18, 2002"

The taste is refreshing and crisp, malt notes lead at first followed by a well-balanced hop bitterness lingering into a slightly dry mouthfeel.

2.95,-3,3,3,3,2.5,3,"Clear straw hue topped by a fluffy white head.  Generic sweetness, light sulfur with a very subdued floral hop nose in aroma.  The typically bland flavor profile is comprised of a quick snap of hop bitterness upfront, followed by dextrin sweetness and pronounced corn notes.  When coupled with the watery mouthfeel, this brew goes down easy, but is uttery unremarkable.  Moosehead is only a notch above typical megaswill in enjoyment.","marc77","Jul 01, 2002"

Decent hop crispness, mouthfeel is very light aside from carbonation.  The malts really fall down in quality of flavor and in providing balance.  What remains is a slightly bitter, watery, and gassy beer that's not very pleasant to swallow.  A slightly skunked macro in taste and impression.","ADR","Jun 17, 2002"
