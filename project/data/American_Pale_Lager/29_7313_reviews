"Serving type: bottle"
"uhhh it wants me to justify not giving it a higher score??   Adjuncty as hell, a bit bready, no real nose to it"
""

"Overall--a little on the light side flavor-wise but certainly drinkable, and actually pretty nice alongside a good meal.  While I wouldn't run out and buy a pack of it at the store or anything, Michelob's not a bad choice at all if you're in the mood for a beer or two but you're at a restaurant that doesn't have anything really amazing on the menu, especially if the imports (and even Yuengling!) are priced a dollar or more higher."
""
"Piss-poor beer at double the price."
""
"Nothing special, but a solid beer."
"cheap price, cheap tasting beer"
"Good middle of the road macro lager.  A little adjuncty but very little to complain about."
""
""
""
"No longer equipped with the foil labels, but still good !!!"
"Looks great, but not a lot of taste but very drinkable and pretty much everyone will drink it.  I like this one more than I like most american lagers."
"a very nice refreshing macro lager. Would drink again"
""
""
""
""
"Maybe it's not the most common choice for that, but it's absolutely my favourite as it's good enough for me to feel that I am not wasting or drinking garbage, and its price is still good enough for a beer to buy often."
""
"Overall (3.74) : I was really impressed here. I wish I would have bought more. I like it a lot and can't wait to try their ""light"" offering. Much better than youd expect. Almost German-esque."

"I took a trip to Las Vegas recently and one of the Casinos on the strip, Casino Royal had these for 1.00. Haven't had a Michelob for years and to my surprise it had a nice smooth malty taste, much fuller than I expected with just the right amount of hops. I was in complete disbelief that a domestic beer could taste this good. I generally have to pay 9.99-10.99 a six pack for the really tasty stuff but this is a nice brew to pack your fridge with if you like to pound down a six pack or two during a football game with the boys. Give it a try."

"Overall â€“ The taste on this one really surprised me as it was much more robust and flavorful then I was expecting; a nice unexpected find. The mouthfeel and smell took away from the brew overall however, making it an only OK brew overall."

"It's the full body American Pale Ale that set the bar and standard for all American domestic beers. It provides a beer that from the gold clear look to the beautiful aroma and refreshing taste makes Michelob the Lager to emulate."
""
""

"Overall: a delicious beer. By far the best AB product I have tried."

"Overall: Three things strike me: (1) It is pretty decent for what it is ($7.50/6-pack!); (2) it is not going to win any awards; and (3) it tastes exactly as I remember it as a youngster, taking a sip of Dad's. Beer snobs everywhere can flame on, but I like this casual and unpretentious beer. It is greater than the sum of its parts."

"Michelob is One of the Best Anheuser Busch Beers.  This brew pours out a rich amber color with a nice white head. The taste is bold with flavor and malts. The smell is rich with grains and malts. Michelob is brewed with finest grains and malts. This brew is full of flavor,  there is nothing over powering in this brew. Michelob has a nice balance to it. It dose not get any better than original Michelob. I would Take this over any other beer out there on the market. Michelob is a Great Beer for the Price. Overall I'm giving this brew a solid 5 out of 5."

"When I think of Michelob, the first thing that comes to mind is their commercial from the '80s featuring Genesis's ""In The Air Tonight."" While this beer's heyday has certainly come and gone, it would likely hit the spot on a hot day (or night)."

"One can hope that appearances may bode well for a beer, but Michelob just doesn't deliver. It's rough around the edges for a lager with too much carbonation in the feel and a metallic twang and bite that really detracts from what malts are used in the grain bill. Complexity and depth -- forget about it. Well, had to revisit this one since I haven't had one (probably) in several decades. Can't say I've missed much of anything over the years..."

"Descent but missing a solid scent and taste profile."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

""
""
"Barley malts up front, slightly sweet and toasted, there some hint of hay. Hop bitterness is mild towards the finish, spicy-citrus. Body is light-medium, crisp, slight dry aftertaste, carbonation is soft."

"Overall, a good beer to wash down barbecue with but that's about it. Not something I would really seek out."
""
""
""
"Not an awful beer. As far as macros goes this is better than most. It is grainy and sweet but it does have a bit of hop character in the finish. Overall, it's definitely one of the better macros."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I could think of a number of worse beers to have (say, any BMC light lager or many adjuncts) but this 5% ABV ""all-malt"" American lager is just a pale beer to kick some heat or wolf a bowling alley cheese pizza. None of it appeals to me, but it's just about average for what it is."

"O- This is pretty much a heavier Michelob Ultra with a little more flavor. Nothing really worthwile unfortunately."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Still it's not outright bad and is probably a good starter brew."
"Poured into a glass mug. Pours pale golden with a tall, frothy white head. Plenty of bubbles can be seen rising from the bottom of the glass. Lacing is not left on the glass as the head dissipates. Only a small amount of lacing is left on the surface fo the beer. Some lacing is left on the side of the glass during consumption. There are aromas of hops and pale malts. It smells bready, sweet, and clean. The taste follows the nose. There's a malty sweetness as well as some hops on the back end. It's clean tasting and bready. The body is light with adequate carbonation. The finish is crisp and dry. The drinkability is high. Overall, this is an excellent lager. Give AB credit where credit is due for making this one."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Well they didn't! And after all these years, and all the different and expensive beers I've consumed, and thoroughly enjoyed , this is STILL a halfway decent beer, and one of my *on occasion* favorites. Its laid back flavor is indeed unique which is something many beers cannot lay claim to...That says something in my book."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a standard macro. A million cheaper beers are just as good. Also, there's a saltiness about it that bothers me."
""
""
""
""
""

"O: there is nothing complex about this beer, but just a standard decent beer that can pretty much go with anything"

"I think it is a really easy drinking beer that goes great with just lounging around and actually wanting more than just one, with this brew you can. Anyway I like to call it a glorified Budweiser because same taste with a vamp. The appearance is typical of this type of lager, smell was nice lot sharper than expected taste blew me away because I like Budweiser as a daily but this thing is Bud with more flavor surely note a hint of hops that is not there with my Budweiser, Turn one up very smooth mouthfeel and easy to drink!"

"Overall Drinkability - Comparable to Budweiser. Perhaps not as complex and flavorful. Which, in this style, isn't saying much. Easy drink. Decent in style."
"Pours golden yellow not much head, despite fizzy body!Tastes malty, slightly sweet, a barest touch of hops perhaps, but no corn or rice flavours. It does not seem to be as I remember it 30 years ago, it may have been more bitter then. Overall nice for a mass market macro!"
"-Overall 3.0: In spite of my negative feelings about the carbonation, this beer TASTES good. An average lager and one that you could depend on. I don't understand why they are going for over $6 for a 6 pack in Georgia, but there you go."
"I have been pleasantly surprised with some of Michelob's recent offerings."
"A higher gravity brew and the addition of a few more hops might make this a pretty drinkable brew."
"Not much aroma or flavor, typical of American-style pale lagers. Tastes and smells grainy with faint metallic hop tinge. Heavier than other pale lagers, smooth and drinkable but nothing special. Preferred over Bud and others, but itâ€™s usually more expensive and not worth the extra money."
"D: Overall it was very light flavored, very light bodied, a mediocre lager at best, but not bad for being mass produced."
"The beer that started it all for me. Smooth to drink. Good enough balance of taste so long as it is cold. Does not warm quickly and is easy to forget how many of these you have had. Easy drink to have regularly. Nothing special, but then again, you never forget your first."
"The body was OK, a touch fuller than I expected, and was smooth and even. Drinkability was surprisingly good, it went down smoothly and easily, and except for the sweetness, was pleasant and repeatable. Overall, this beer was better than I was expected. A local restaurant sells these for $2 during happy hour. I think I'll keep that in mind during budget crunch days."
"D: A bit of flavor to it, goes down easily, not too filling, mild kick, standard representation of style, itâ€™s got a little more substance than your typical A-B product but itâ€™s still another fizzy yellow beer."
"Overall: For all of the BMC-bashing that goes on, you have to figure AB does something right. In this beer, I'd say they are doing something headed in the right direction and something that, at the least, can start to compete with the craft beer world in terms of flavor."
"Better than Bud, I suppose. And that ain't saying much. Pours a pale straw color, very carbonated, with a thin head of quickly dissipating bubbles. Light aroma of pale malts, skunk, and old corn. More of the same in the taste; skunky with rotten hay and stale grains, leaving an acrid aftertaste. To be avoided."
"I must admit, while I won't be buying this again any time soon, it's really not too bad for what it is. I certainly wouldn't call this ""a distinctive, high-quality beer for connoisseurs," but in a tight pinch like the one I was in when I bought it, this will be my go-to BMC beer."
"Overall- Very refreshing and could be one of my favorite Michelob products. I have never seen this Lager available and especially at a gas station?!?! Very cool! Drinkability was exceeded my expectations as well."
"*Paired with chedder brats"
"This is the next best beer that Michelob puts out beside there amber bock. This beer has a little bit of good flavor in it. It's still the boring yellow pale color but its at least drinkable. I still can't pick up on too many hops here which still is a bummer."
"Light bodied flavor with some lightly sweet husky grain notes. Touch of lemon bread from the hops and with a nice subtle carbonation to lend a bit of creaminess to the mouthfeel. Finishes a bit sweet and simple, decent and straightforward yet without much character."
"Despite some bad reviews and I am not saying this is a great beer my any means it better than a lot of beers that have great ratings on this site. I just think there is a stigma about this beer. It is not bad looking. The body was nice gold color that was clear with tight lace and rocky foam. It has sweet malty and corny flavor with very mild hop tones. The mouthfeel is average with some tickling carbonation. The aroma is average for this style."
"drinkability: I'm not crazy about the flavor but it's not bad. I think the most I would want to drink of Michelob Lager would be 2. It's certainly different and seems like it would take awhile to get used to drinking it on a regular basis. I'll probably buy this again in another year or so."
"Very, very light bodied but with lots of mouth filling carbonation makes it feel a bit fuller than it probably is. This is a surprisingly drinkable beer. It's been many a year since I had one. It was better than I thought it would be."
"D: I might have to put Michelob on the top of my American mass produced lager list."
"D- Easy and smooth to drink, very boring."
"D: An American macro take on Helles? Pretty good for the price point. I like the background floral note in this one. And it has a decent dose of hop character and flavor. But it is a bit too well attenuated when combined with relatively high CO2 level. Goes a bit harsh rather than being refreshing, and lets the grainy husk character through to much. If AB would mute the bean counters and dial back the efficiency, then this brew (and probably others) would benefit qualitatively."
"Its not the worst beer I've ever had but its not winning any awards if I'm the judge. Pretty simple and standard. Exactly what I expect from Michelob."
"I have to say, even if this beer has nothing else going going for it, the label on this bottle looked fantastic. Unfortunately, that's where the positives stop. This tastes veryyy fake and pretty much like a hoppier Budweiser in my opinion, but in an artificial way that's drinkable but not enjoyable. It's not something I'd go for again."
"Interesting move to make this beer all-malt. Obviously a sign of the times, meaning most palates are tired of being dumbed down. Either way, not half bad--refreshingly clean and tasty. Pair it with a plate of Colombian-style steak soft tacos with rice and beans."
"I am drinking this at my Moose lodge because it is on special for a dollar. Little do they know that this is probably the best beer they have in this BMC haven. Shhhh! Don't tell them! I won't mind drinking this here at all since Bud Light is probably my only other alternative. This beer actually isn't too bad, given its creator. If faced with no other option, this one won't disappoint."
"Good initial head during the pour and as it settled there was some great lace, but it quickly slid down the glass. Color is a light amber, rating a 6 on the SRM chart. Smells like damp straw and corn husks. Taste is mild with hints of wheat, corn, and malt. Seems to have a little going for it in mouthfeel, some body and frothiness, but leaves my tongue dry. Not really to my liking as far as drinking more than this one. Not bad, but I will not search for it the next time I am out for some tasty brew."
"D- I'm pleasantly surprised by this, I was expecting much worse. I could kick back a few of these without having to choke them down. This is a decent pale lager/lager with enough of a refreshing taste and experience to be a good drinking brew. It doesn't taste like stale corn like its competitors."
"Pours a yellow straw color with a thick white head and little lacing. Smells of grain, corn, rice, some sweetness and a little hop aroma. Tastes a little bitter from a little hops, grainy and sweet from a little malts. Mouthfeel is not bad. And drinkability is as well"
"RJT"
"Atmosphere is okay. Appearance is pretty nondescript, as is the nose. Flavor, again nothing special, but nothing off-putting either. Overall, this is a pretty middle of the road quaff."
"From the 12 fl. oz. bottle. Sampled on 10/10/10 while watching NFL Football on TV. This is the kind of beer you drink for football games. It pours a well-carbonated pale yellow with a fizzy head the bursts forth and settles down. The aroma has a touch of malts and adjuncts in it. And yes it has that famous American pale lager taste with adjuncts, light hops, and a slightly tart ending. Very typical but great with peanuts and football."
"Pours a moderate golden color with a white head that doesn't recede too quickly and brings a tad bit of lacing. Smell brings forward a bit of grain without too much husk. Taste brings the same and isn't too offputting. Merely a bit. Mouthfeel is light with low carbonation. Drinks okay and is better than many in this style."
"Drinkability - not a lot of complexity to this one, so not a lot to keep you thinking. But decent enough in taste to keep you drinking."
"D - Wouldn't mind drinking this again, not nearly as flavorful as some beers that I've had, but if I wanted a domestic to drink I'd probably choose this again."
"overall a classic lager apparently, but the lack of depth was alarming, still though i have had worse."
"Surprisingly sweet, even with expectations well in check. I can see why this is not in the same style as Bud, but, really we're splitting tongue-scraping hairs here, folks..."
"D- As far as mass produced lagers go, this is a decent enough beer. It has a good deal going for it, but it just seems to lack a flavor profile direction."
"Bottom line, if you're going to drink BMC macros, get Michelob."
"A fairly basic American lager. Not as watered down as the big ones, but only a half-step above."
"Seeing a theme here? Sure it isn't a great lager like some of those actually from central Europe, but neither is it an awful abomination. Would I drink it again, sure I would, nice and cold, by the beach, wanting a beer without wanting to think too much about it, jaded with all these ridiculous hop bombs, grab and fairly standard lager. This one will do the job."
"D: a rather bland lager offered at an affordable price. Definitely a step up from other AB offerings, but nothing compared to some of the Munich helles that the label states to be this brew's influence."
"Overall: I definitely wouldn't mind this beer every once in a while. It has much much more flavor than other typical American macro lagers, which is a plus for me. Honestly, it doesn't hold its own after a while. If it had increased complexity at the end, or even just not lost its complexity towards the end, this would be better."
"Taste is surprising...quite a nice drinking lager. Can tell right off the bat this is an all-malted barley beer. Nice and velvety cream feeling in the mouth. Fairly sweet with a slight hop touch at the end. I would like a bit more hop flavor and bitterness, but all the malt components are there for a tasty, refreshing beer. This was an impulse supermarket 6-pack purchase and I am not regretting it one bit! Pretty good bargain at six bucks, I am sure there will be a future purchase on down the trail at some point."
"Notes - Not exactly the all malt lager classic I was hoping for but not bad either."
"I have had way better lagers."
"Pours a clear light golden with a small white head. Aroma of malt, corn, and slight hops. Taste of the same with a bit of sweetness. This light bodied brew is not bad but not good. Might be good to swill after a softball game. Definitely would prefer this over a Bud."
"Pours a light yellow color, nice carbonation, small white head, with some sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, with some hops, slight caramel. The taste is slightly sweet, malty, slight hop note. Light body. Not drinkable, would not buy again."
"D: This is a beer that I will drink again"
"Golden straw yellow in color with a small white head. It smells sweet. Unlike Buschbeer, whose keg I raided, I felt sweetness was the only real detectable smell. It showed up less in the taste, which was better than Bud or Bud Light. Pretty typical, pretty plain, and just ok."
"Cheers!"
"Overall beer was not bad and I may buy again to bring to a party where I prefer more flavor than the standard light beers found at a party."
"Notes: A step up from some of the Macros, not a great beer but not horrible."
"D - This is where this beer shines. It has a decent taste, it has no off flavors, and it's great for putting a few back after mowing the lawn on a hot day."
"Poured from a 12 ounce bottle with freshness date on the bottle. Poured into my pint glass a golden tone. Smell is a little malty. Balanced hops and malts nothing to extra special. The taste is not really appealing or offensive. Not exactly the beer I remember trying years ago. Mouthfeel is some what watery. Drinkable nature is okay. Not exactly something I would reach for again."
"Cheers"
"Pours a pale golden yellow color, with slight head and no retention or lacing. Smell is of lightly toasted white bread, sugared breakfast cereal and paper. Taste is a somewhat bland combination of faint grains, slight corn, sugary cereal and metallic tastes, lacks a lage twang. Minimal carbonation makes you think this is thicker than it is. Meh... nothing horrible, just a few off notes and carbonation issues."
"CAN we please have a review? Sure. Here goes. My pour created two fingers' worth of foamy, bubbly, fluffy bone-white head with decent retention. The color was a light golden-yellow with NE-quality clarity. The nose was very lager-like, sweet with a slight hoppiness that was a welcome change from the adjunct lagers to which the CANQuest has exposed me. Mouthfeel ws medium with a clean lager sweetness on the tongue. Clean, free of adjuncts, welcome by yours truly. It strikes me that there might have been a real reason that I like this as a younger man. It is actually half-decent. Finish was likewise clean, semi-dry and very refreshing. It may not supplant Stoudt's Gold Lager in my reefer, but it will do in a pinch."
"Not a bad beer overall as far as macros go, just not great. Appearance is typical of your run-of-the-mill macro, straw colored, clear with rapidly fading white head. Smell is sweet, a bit of corn and maybe some pale malt. Taste isn't that bad, sweet again with maybe a hint of spiciness, subtle hint that something in there has been roasted. That's better than most, I guess. MF is typical, soda-like. Drinkability isn't bad, not a bad beer to have while watching football, etc."
"D - I love it. Definitely would make a fine session beer. Tasty and satisfying. Not too heavy but much better than most macro-lagers."
"d: reasonable"
"Drinkability: Its easy to go down but the taste makes the drinkability go down a bit. Smooth and light and refreshing but doesnt taste all that good."
"Serving type: bottle"
"Overall, very average and nothing to differentiate it from less expensive macros except the price."
"Overall I was slightly disappointed by this offering with stated it used European aroma hops."
"D - I'm nearing the bottom of the glass and find myself surprised it hasn't hit the drain yet. Not from dislike but out of total disregard. Definitely a drinkable lager I wouldn't pass up but would never seek out."
"Pale gold color with a white foamy head which doesn't last long. Smells of grain and not much else. Taste is mostly water, a little sweet, with grain. Has a thin and watery feeling to it, with decent carbonation. As far as drinkability goes, I won't make it a high priority to try this again, although it is better than Budweiser and Miller."
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a pale yellow color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is mild, some malts. Taste is crisp With some notes of malts and hops. Not a whole lot of flavor. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and has good drinkability. Overall this is a decent beer."
"D: At least it goes down easily. If this were ice cold and I'd just mowed the lawn, I wouldn't object to it. I'd rather have something that's a little crisper and cleaner, but it's not bad."
"I would drink it again but I'd never buy it and there are many beers that are at least as good or better for less money."
"Taste is totally ordinary. Not repulsive, but watery, basically tasteless. Tastes, feels, and goes down like water. No aftertaste, so I spose you could have several if you wanted a beer with no flavor."
"D - Wouldn't mind drinking this again, not nearly as flavorful as some beers that I've had, but if I wanted a domestic to drink I'd probably choose this again."
"I give it good marks overall on drinkability - one of those no brainer beers, that you could knock thru a few of without thinking about the complexities, likes, or dislikes."
"D-I know people who only drink this. I can only imagine that they aren't BA members."
"12 pack from the store, i havent drank it in a long time, this beer is probably the best domestic i have ever had. Really smooth taste almost sweet and after taste was very pleasant. pours a golden stream with a thick head. A very bubbly taste. I normally like a darker, a little more bolder taste, but hey, its only american beer, but not bad at all. I will buy this again."
"There are some beers that benefit from the addition of some corn. Hey, I had a bottle of sorghum beer the other day and found it pretty good. I like beer, I don't like snobs who think that just because a beer tastes this way or that that it is somehow skunk water."
"Very light bodied with a lot of carbonation. So anyway, we're sitting by a friend's pool when he opens up an ice chest filled with nothing but Michelob. It was about 98 degrees out, I figured what the hell. On a hot day like that, a cold one of these went down like water just quick and easy. Whatever, it was better than the typical macro, take it for what its worth. I won't be buying these myself but I'm not beyond taking one that's offered to me in a social setting."
"Drinkability: Frankly, I was expecting worse from this beer, but it's not bad. It's not great, but not awful."
"D is a 4.0, as noted above. Reminds me a of a full malt Miller High Life, if you like the Champagne of beers, you should try this one..."
"Germans and Czechs build the best lagers. Their water is limestone. So, maybe Pennsylvania or the Great Lakes region could craft a great pilsner, and Prima is a good drink, but not subtle enough to match the masters of the style."
"D- Drinkablity is great and very refreshing for the style. Very recomended for a session. Kudos for Mic."
"mid-light body. good carbonation. not a bad beer."
"Michelob Original Lager is your standard American lager with a bit more malt and hop flavor than B, M, or C. The taste is definitely grainy with hints of corn and citrus. Slight hop bitterness and a dry aftertaste. Compared to the competitors in this arena, I would say this actually has some merit with regards to flavor. The other major brands, as mentioned previously, are too reliant on adjuncts and thus the flavor suffers. Michelob seems to be less adjunct reliant. Keyword here is ""seems""."
"Overall I'm happy with this beer. It's not the best I've ever had but it is slightly above average."
"I don't suppose there's any reason not to try it if nothing else is available."
"I'm surprised this hasn't gotten better reviews, it's a really solid beer. Good malt, good hops, good bitterness. I'd imagine that this is what beer in the United States tasted like at the turn of the last century. Now, admittedly, it is a little out of balance for my taste, but what do I know. I just think the kind of raspy, spicy hops are a bit much. I'd prefer them to be a bit more floral, but that's just me. And I can't fault it anywhere, really. It looks great, nice and clear and golden; and the frothy bright white head holds pretty well and leaves some decent lacing on the glass. I get some nice malt and hops out of the nose, and the same follow in the flavor. It's a Munich-style helles, and a pretty good one at that. I'll agree that it's maybe a bit fuller than some of the softer, sweeter versions out there now, but that doesn't mean that that's the style. If that was the case, who knows what Oktoberfests would taste like in a few years, they seemed to get a little bit more watered down every year. Good beer. I certainly like it a whole hell of a lot better than Yuengling Traditional Lager. Cheers!"
"Mouthfeel / Drinkability: The body of the beer is light but not watery. The carbonation is active and works well with the beer overall. The drinkability is pretty good over all. I could toss a few of these back as a lawnmower beer. Well done."
"D= anyone who actually enjoys this or is stuck at a party where it's the ""best available"" can make a night of it, I'm sure. I only bought it because I ran out of good stuff and at 01:00 the only thing open that sold beer was 7-11."
"Not bad if you want an ice cold summer beer to slug after mowing the yard. For the price, I'd much rather drink the Michelob Porter or Dunkel Weizen. The Pale Ale is next to try on the list. Ho hum."
"Clear gold color with one finger of white head. Earthy hop aroma. Nice clean malty taste. Good amount of earthy euro hop fllavor. Clean crisp finish. One of the best regular American macros. Leaning toward the sweet side but not unusual for the style. If this is all that is available on tap at your favorite restaurant it will be O.K. with your meal."
"Michelob is one of my favorite beers. It is very smooth and at the same time crisp and bold enough to make for some good drinking. They explain on the label about the quality malt and imported hops. I like the bottles better than your standard longneck, but it seems like they don't hold as much, haha. Every time I pick it up it's nearly empty."
"If I only have five bucks and need a six pack, I hope this one's on sale."
"Avoid."
"A good pilsner, no standout qualities, just a easy drinking smooth sailer. I'll be happy to have another from my sixer, and if offered one."
"Drinkability: Better than I expected. I'd drink this again, and even choose it given the typical college scene selection. Really not bad! Disappeared from my mug quick enough."
"Drinkability- fairly high. I had a hard time being ultra critical, and with an open mind came a pretty reasonable beer."
"Pours a pale, clear golden color with decent white head. Moderate lacing diminishing through finish. Smell - just pretty sour to me like most other A-B beers. Just not a very good aroma. Not sure where the hops and malts are. To me a glorified Bud Light. Not as distinct a taste as Budweiser. Not much there for me, and not worth a premium price. Less than average in its price."
"D- It had a nice refreshing feel that made it very drinkable, but not really my type of beer. I found the flavor to be rather flat and pedestrain. Lagers aren't really my thing but I have definatly had better ones. It's also definatly not the worst beer I have ever had. I would drink again at a cook out or something but probaly won't buy again. Cheers!"
"D - I'm a snob so I really didn't like this. That said it wasn't that bad it just didn't have anything to make it any different than most beers."
"This lager pours a clear yellow color with a thin, fizzy white head. The aroma is faintly hoppy with some malty, grainy notes. Up front, it has a smooth body with crisp carbonation and a mildly malty flavor with some graininess. The finish is crisp and slightly malty. Drinkable and not bad for an American standard lager."
"Not bad, and for the style it's quite decent. Just make sure to pour this one into a glass, as it does wonders."
"D: Not worth the premium over Bud, even if it is an all malt brew. Bland and unexciting."
"pours a crystal clear golden color with a white frothy head, looks a bit darker than say budweiser, or any other macro-lager. smell is dominated by water and corn, little hop or malt at all. taste is pretty bland, like most macro-lagers, i'd be hard pressed to tell the differnce between this and budweiser. mouthfeel is watery and not that great, its drinkability is ok, just depends on the event"
"Drinkability is ok. For an American Macro lager this isn't so bad. This is easy to drink, it's pretty basic, and not all the interesting, but it goes down easy and is pretty refreshing."
"drinkability: smooth and east to drink"
"I would have to say that the best characteristic of this beer is color. It pours a nice darker than average color and that really adds to the overall experience of the beer. Smell is decent, better than regular Budweiser but still not a stand-out feature in this brew. Most of the time I just have this one right out of the bottle with cook-out foods. Other than a cook-out, this beer doesn't have to much else to offer."
"Taste is a bit off, a bit metallic, It's a simple beer, should be more drinkable but I'm really not wanting another. If I'm buying another Micholob product it'll be the Amber Bock, or Porter."
"They said I need more characters, there's not much to this beer to really say except that it's what Americans were used to drinking before the craft beer movement."
"Mouthfeel was medium/light in body and pleasantly not over-carbonated."
"Drinkability is average. It doesn't push you away or draw you back for another. If you know what to expect, this can be an okay beer."
"Light golden color with monster white head and surprisingly decent lacing. Smell: almost nothing - a little bit of grain, a little bit of noble hops. Taste: pale malts, slightly grainy, ever so slight noble hop grassiness/spiciness. Semi-dry, semi-sticky finish. If they put a bunch more hops in this it would be a decent session beer. As it is, just kind of boring."
"For the price, this is a pretty good option when you want a decent beer and are light in the wallet. Leaps and bounds ahead of Coors/Miller/Bud in terms of being widely available and cheap. Still too light bodied, but it has some flavor and is very smooth."
"Pours a golden straw body with a healthy white crisp whispy head that falls to two fingers...glass is alive with effervescence.. and actually, not bad tracings of lace... oats and pilsner malts assault the nostrils, as expected... a bit of cereal makes this not far from malt liquor in general... thin, crisp and drinkable, if not forceful at the throat... sweet like caramel syrup--no hop balance at the teeth; burnt grains, almost like alcohol, simmer at the swallow...the bottle--always attractive--reminds me of my father's Sunday afternoons of sports TV at the Kisatsky home...otherwise, nothing special about this brew...an Ommegang brewer recently said the Buschs seem to get the best hops at picking time, but this kind of beer makes wonder what they do it all when they get it home..."
"I like the new all-malt recipe for this. I think its a nice improvement over the previous one. This is one I enjoyed, and will buy again if the opportunity comes around."
"I had been curious to try this ever since I found out it was an all malt beer again. Easily the best thing I've tried from AB. If all you can find in a place is macros, this is easily the best option out there."
"Thanks to my pops for having some of these in the fridge, it's been a while since I've had a Michelob. This one is slightly better than Bud but not by much. Aroma and appearance are the same but this one is smoother and has a cleaner finish. The taste is alright but it's still A-B mass produced lager."
"D: Overall a very decent macro lager that has a good balance and goes down with ease. It's good to see that it's all malt, but it could use a bit more character in my opinion. I would (and do) when the need arises go for this over Bud. Also, i really dig the lava lamp bottle , glad they brought it back!"
"The beer pours a light gold with a thin white head. The aroma is light and malty. The taste is mainly of a light sweet malt, no real hop taste. The feel is light and wet with a bit of malt aftertaste. This is a beer that's about average. The all barley malt leaves it with a pleasant taste, but it could definately do with more malt and hops. The hops are present obviously as it isn't overly sweet, but you can't taste them. A beer that would be OK for a barbecue or picnic, but not one that you'd go out of your way to find."
"Drink: It depends, I'm really impressed Michelob to me it was a lot worse, like a Blatz. Now I would get this regularly. Drink is average because it could go either way. You like it or you don't?"
"A little more expensive than most others but not bad at all."
"Taste is a bit of yeastiness, a touch of balancing hops, and maybe some grain malt. Not bad tasting, actually, for a macrobrew. Just nothing to write home about. It is a bit too watery and overly carbonated, which goes with the territory."
"Overall, not a bad beer really. Easy drinking and a decent flavor. Good for AB for switching back to all malt with this one."
"Yeesh, slightly skunky flavor leaves me miffed. Sweet and vexing like Grain Belt, at twice the price. Flat well before it should be. Uncomplicated, needs more malt and everything else. I'd avoid."
"Avg beer to put in the water category."
"D - Could work as a thirst quencher on a hot day. Has a little more to it than other macros which makes it more tolerable."
"Overall, choosing between this and Budweiser, this is the one to go for."
"Michelob come sin a cool shaped bottle to help mask what's inside. The yellow carbonated liquid has a dismal white head, gone in seconds. The nose and taste are both harshly grainy. Body is light and passes over the palate with difficulty. Not a pleasant drinking experience for me."
"D - Easy to drink but uninteresting and with the syrupy finish, this makes for a bland unrefreshing lager. Pass!"
"D - This is easy drinking and is worth a try when given limited options (Ex. at a wedding or other function with free beer)."
"This is very clean and crisp. It was a good idea for AB to go back to the grind stone with this recipe, and produce a beverage that can hold its own head up."
"Yellow colored lager with a thick head that stays for a while.Taste is clean and refreshing with no bitter aftertaste.Another good beer by AB that when it's cold you just can't beat with any of these microbreweries.I have drank this beer in the past and I will continue to drink it in the future!!"
"As far as the beer goes-- well, hey... Prosit!"
"D-You have to pour this into a class....the rounded bottles are cool but this tastes pretty average out of the bottle..pour it into a glass and it separates itself from the pack. Definitely a top notch Macro lager...perhaps the best of the lot although I'd have to do some blind tastings to determine that."
"Appearance pale yellow and clear very little head retention. Smell clean malt and some hops. Taste Clean malt some hops and refreshing. Mouthfeel light to mediem carbonation is high. Drinkability for a mass market lager its not bad I can drink this one and might even pick it if not much else was avalible."
"I could drink these one after the other all day."
"This brew is drinkable to the max and quite satisfying at the same time. Overall I really like this one. Going back to an all-malt recipe was a smart move; it sure payed off big time. Clearly a notch above most. Recommended!"
"D - Very light and easy to drink with a malt character that is a distinct improvement over that of the standard light macro lager. This is really a pretty decent beer, for what it is."
"D - Not so good."
"As far as the style, this is one of my favorites. It just needs something. A touch more malt and hops and they might have something here. I mean I know it's all malt and all, just why so watery? As it is...fairly nice effort just needs a tad more finishing school."
"D - Like water but why bother"
"Finishes a bit dry, and easy to drink. Far superior to Budweiser, but nothing to tell your grandkids about."
"Drinkability : less than n average beer in the style American malt lager"
"D: Not really a bad beer, though nothing really stands out. Fairly easy to drink."
"Pours a crystal clear light golden with a tiny white head that fades away fast. Smells slightly of sulfur, and yeast. Does not smell good at all. Taste however, is better. It does have a hint of the BMC sickly sweetness but not too bad. Tastes very light and malty, with a surprising amount of hops to balance. The mouthfeel is very thin and carbonation levels quite high though. Very drinkable though, its so smooth and light it is a very easy drinking beer. However, there really isnt much to the flavor, so I doubt I will be drinking this much in the future. Still to the style it tastes ok. I much prefer this over Budwieser."
"Cheers!"
"The re-vamped Michelob, complete with new bottle and all-malt-and-noble-hop recipe. ""Born-on"" 7/8/07 and sampled two months after that. Pours into the glass light gold, with medium carbonation and a finger of white head that releases aromas of light fruitiness and some watered-down malts. Tastes of toasted malts and a touch of caramel, with light, green hops and perhaps some notes of lemon and banana. The body is light, crisp and tingly, and imparts a light finish. Not too bad, but for an all-malt brew with noble hops it should taste better than this. Kudos to A-B for at least trying to cater to the craft beer drinkers."
"These can grow on you if you are at a bar and the draft special is running, but I wouldn't buy a 6-pack of this stuff or anything."
"Taste: Better than remembered. I guess going to all malt has indeed helped it. Nice, malt flavor, with a slight, slight hint of hops. Much more agreeable than a run-of-the-mill macro lager."
"Drinkablity: This brew seems to taste better that I remember. I am impressed with the quality. It has excellent flavor and body. A classic."
"For a mass-produced beer, this isn't bad at all. No off-flavors, clean, and extremely sessionable."
"Overall a better than average macro."
"D: I enjoyed two of these at a Vietnamese Restaurant with a spicy Saigon pancake. This beer goes well with spicy food."
"Poured into a Chimay Chalice (Probably not the right glassware). Pours a straw yellow with little head that disappears quickly. I'm not knocking the aroma down because it smells bad but because there is really no aroma. Taste is a little malt with a little hops. Tastes like a supped up version of Budweiser. Mouthfeel is average. A perfect session beer when you want to drink all night."
"Pours a very light golden color with lots of bubbles. Minimal head, no lacing really. Smells of light malts, nothing really standing out. Taste is also of light malts, a faint hop spiciness, not much really. It is what it is, although better than Bud or Coors, etc. Mouthfeel is very carbonated and watery. Very drinkable if you're not looking for much flavor and going to be out drinking all night long."
"Overall, if Macros are are that is available, this one gets the call."
"biÃ¨re blonde industrielle, avec une mousse chimique, sans grand intÃ©rÃªt. odeur de malt, maÃ¯s et autres produits substitut, en bouche elle est liquide, rafraichissante, elle est sans grand intÃ©rÃªt pour les amateurs."
"But, there will be no round two, my friends. Sure. Michelob is a step above your usual macro offering, but that's damning with faint praise. It has little identity or character, and so it is just part of a big, non-descript pack. Sure, it drinks easily, but that's long established as a non-asset when there's nothing else to really recommend it. The one positive I'll note is it is, thus far, the sole A-B product that does not act as a laxative."
"Not bad, not bad at all. It's pretty plain overall, but there's a nice balance of very light caramel malts with small amount of hops that make this a decent beer - maybe A-B's best mass-brewed beer. There's no stinging mouthfeel like a lot of macro's, just a light bitterness in the finish. I'd order this in a pinch."
"Pours a light toasted straw color with a small white head that dissipated into a very light ring. The smell is almost nothing, some light grain, that's about it. The taste is of extremely light malt, a bit grainy but no adjuncty flavors. The taste is probably not average for an all malt lager but it has no off putting flavors so that is what I am going with. The feel is watery and fizzy, finishes with a slight grainy sweetness. Very easy to drink this beer with none of the AB adjuncts to kill the drinkability. Not something I would seek out but was just curious to try to ""new"" Michelob."
"Slightly darker than most macro lagers. Smell was simply that of a macro lager beer (nothing great but nothing offensive). The taste is an improvement -- I tried this early last summer when the all-malt conversion took place and it was flat-- however this time it actually tasted good, overall: good carbonation, mild hop taste and smooth. Enjoyable beer for the style could pair well with Chinese, pizza, and/or barbeque."
"As macro lagers go..probably one of my favorites and one of the beers that became a staple for me in my younger years. Pours a straw yellow with decent carbonation. Taste is better than most of the macros in my opinion with much less rice in there. Overall if I'm going to drink on the cheap this would be a choice for me or if I were out and they dind't offer any other acceptable alternatives"
"pay more?"
"Easy to drink a lot of these beers. . . but I'm hoping that I never have to."
"Drinkability- Not so bad. A good after mowing the lawn beer. Refreshing."
"Pours a light yellow with ample carbonation. A good whiff of beer and malt. Clean refreshing light hop, bubbly taste. I like michelob, always have, always will. Next time i'm in a piano bar romancing a menopausal stockyard channing, i'll be drinking michelob."
"b) it gives you a weird uneasy buzz."
"This is really not terrible at all, and has a decent amount of malt flavor. Would be a viable choice when no craft beer is available."
"Drinkability: Refreshing, inexpensive, and not nearly as bothersome as the vast majority of the other macro beers, so really I can't complain."
"This lager poured a medium light yellow with average foam and no lace what so ever. The smell was of a sour nature and even on the verge of being out dated. The taste was super bitter and tart and again, very sour and tart. All I could taste was a sour and bitter hop and hardly any flavor at all. No good, not even for a summer quincher. Worst beer from Michelob I've tasted lately!"
"D: Not a bad beer from AB, certainly better than some of the other products that I have had from them, but not on par with some of the better craft lagers, easy to drink though, it would be a good choice for a six-pack on the cheap, but with some flavour."
"Pours a medium yellow color with a nice head that holds its own. Aroma is pretty much that of malt and only malt. Somewhat sweet smelling. Reminds me of a brown ale (only because of the maltiness). Taste is somewhat sweet and tart. Leaves a nice dry maltiness on the tongue, which goes pretty much beyond A-B's other offerings. A second sip confirms pretty much the same except that the aftertaste is somewhat salty/dry on my tongue. Not bad. No adjuncts to be detected. I have to give A-B props for what they've chosen to do with this brew. A decent all-malt lager."
"Overall this is a nice easy drinking beer, they add up effortlessly. It's a good brand I'm glad A-B is trying to do something with it, the new bottle is a nice touch."
"On the fuller side of light bodied; some wateriness despite the aggressive carbonation. A very decent product."
""
"Bought it due to the inexplicable return (though less elegant design) of the bottle; I enjoy design as much as the craft. Poured into a pint glass, a nice gold color, topped with a two-finger head that quickly disappears. Sweet malt in the nose with barely a hint of hop. It tastes the same, imbued with nothing beyond the visual, sweet malt enclosed within a medium body. Shed a tear for that mouthfeel incongruent with the light and bland flavor. Smooth, but leaves no lacing, no lasting imprint upon the palate nor the mind. To be kind, one of the better domestic macros, one I would choose among its competition in a cooler, but rather boring outside its context."
"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, beer is a perfect golden color with a plethora of bubbles rising through the beer and a thin bubbly head. Smell is malty sweet; a slight amber-ness about it. The taste isn't bad, but not spectacular. I do applaud AB for going back to their all-malt formula and for reviving the sexier bottle. The mouthfeel is light to medium bodied and finishes very smooth. Overall, this beer isn't anything to get too excited about but it is a step in the right direction for American Macros."
"That is how I feel about it. Man, don't get me wrong, this is better than Bud Light (though it is roughly on par with Bud) but this isn't an impressive beer outside of that rough comparison."
"I cant see myself drinking this beer again since I drink micros now.It was very bland and boring."
"Pours to a thin white head that sticks around and pale golden color. Aroma is very clean and light with malt sweetness evident. Flavor is very bland: there is some slight maltiness but for what is now being touted as an ""all malt lager"" it lacks the malt character you would find in its European counterparts. Finishes clean and much like a top-notch American lager. Drinks like water--it lacks flavor but is well-made nonetheless."
"At $5 for a 6-pack, it's better than most items from the big 3. However it's still no match for any craft or (fresh) German lagers I can recall offhand."
"Overall, this is a decent 'average' beer. This is an excellent for a multi-national company like A-B. I typically buy this beer for grilling brats and I don't mind the leftovers so much. It's decent thirst quencher. Also, if this is available in almost every bar in America, that's not a bad thing."
"The crowd consumed the Michelob without much thought and I had at least 7 pints of the beer to help them kick the keg. Some of this same crowd will be at my Halloween party where they will be floored by Sixpoint Ales and then they will not miss the Michelob, other than a passing taste."
"This is a very drinkable macro-lager. It pours alight godlen straw and has alot of grain in the nose as well as some hopiness but very faint. The taste is very suprising for a macro its very malty and grainny and pleasent. A very good refreshing beer that quenches the thisrst of summer grilling."
"Drinkability: A-B done good with this one."
"This is a pretty good All-Malt Lager. The taste was obviously very big on the sweet malts. It wasn't sparse. The taste was sweet, thick and full. Like a hint of bread with a lot of rice ... or maybe Chex Mix. The rest of the beer was good too. It was nice and foamy but not overly carbonated. The beer also had good drinkability. I was able to crack one open and take a good long chug. However, it is expensive. And just being above average doesn't warrant an expensive price tag. Oh well, it isn't like I bought it this time. It is the best All-Malt I've ever had. The last time I had it I was pretty drunk. Plus, this time I haven't had a (good) brew in a while."
"the all malt version of michelob is a blur between the lines of bud and other full flavoured offerings from A-B. not worth paying any more than bud."
"Overall everything about this takes me back a handful of years, which is why I most likely still favor this over any other AB product."
"D- simple and tasty sessionable lager, not a brew i would ever crave, but this is where i now point people who are trying to break into better beer. wish it was little less sweet though"
"Thin up front and then slightly astringent on the finish. Not doing it for me. This is certainly not the worst tasting beer I've had but there's absolutely nothing good about it either. I could see drinking this in lieu of water after mowing the lawn."
"Overall impression: Still not a thrilling beer - but this one doesn't have the adjunct flavors of many macro offerings. I would put this a step above many other BMC offerings right now."
"Not worth the ""few pennies more"" they used to sing about in their commercials. I knew I should have stuck with Budweiser. Next time I will."
"Completely unimpressed with the new incarnation of this beer, but who knows? Maybe A-B is taking small steps and we'll be able to watch this beer evolve into something?"
"Pours a light golden color with a large head that fades fast. Aroma- slight cereal grain along with some faint citrusy notes, otherwise not much else. Taste was equally unexciting. Slight malt character in the flavor and lots of sweet lemony notes and also that cooked vege taste that reminds me of every other American style macro lager. Also, hop flavor was not noticeable in the least. If this is supposed to be all-malt, AB must not have used much of it. Mouthfeel was light and watery. I'd have to say the drinkability was pretty good though. On a warm late winter day it was easy to drink."
"I knew it, I knew it, I knew it! I have been saying that AB changed Michelob's receipe when they changed to the longneck bottle. It got too sweet and yuck! But hey, I had one of the new ones in the rocket bottles at my Dad's and I'll say, it is back to being a good macro beer. No micro, but excellent for a macro. Smell is average, the appearance is awful and pissy yellow, but tastes good, nothing offensive. Not bad."
"Appears a very light yellow in color, with a small off white head that dissolves right away. Moderate to light in carbonation and bubbles. No hop aroma, in fact very little smell at all. Mouthfeel is somewhat bland to me, with no bite when drinking and no bitterness whatsoever. A classic ""lawnmover beer", one of the many mass produced american beers. I got this in a gift box and drank it just for a quick drink, nothing I would buy when out on the town."
"Pours out a pale gold to almost straw body with a thin head that soon becomes a ring of bubbles. Bubbles are scant in the body. Smells an awful lot like an adjunct lager with all the harsh grain in the nose. Sweet nose. Faint malts. Taste is a mix of malt and grain with grain showing more muscle. There is a faint bitterness in the finish. Finally I get some half-decent bready malt in the aftertaste. Body is kind of sticky and oily in a way. Pricks the tongue too much considering the lack of bubbles in the appearance. I'm just not impressed with this and reminds me of a poor Mexican lager. I'll take a Bohemia over this anyday."
"Like AB's other attempts at classiness, this one is rather half-assed."
"Taste is very clean, short lived on the palate. Slightly sweet maltiness is balanced by a light hoppiness that comes out in the finish. Tingly carbonation seems appropriate for this brew. Mouthfeel is somewhere between thin and medium. Actually not a bad brew, I think it would be a good accompaniment to pizza or some good bbq."
"A medium yellow color, with a light foamy head that dissipates quickly. The carbonation remains throughout. I can best describe the smell as ""flat"". Taste is no surprise compared to any other american macro lager. Light to medium bodied. I wouldn't turn this beer away, but I wouldn't crave it either."
"Good summer brew when your mind is on something else."
"Drinkability - More drinkable than the old version. but still not exciting. It could be easily drank to quench your thirst in the Summer and its not too offensive to refuse. Either Way for an all malt lager go for the Brooklyn, unless you are in my neck of the woods go for some palmetto"
"Example: I could bring a case of this over to my bro-in-law's house, knock it off with him during a Yankee game and feel no pain in the morning."
"Clear, pale apple cider tone. Thin off white head that has no retention and little lacing ability. Aroma is sweet, grainy and just a little adjuncty. Taste is very plain. Nothing bad, but not a lot good about it either. I could see drinking a few of these in the summer or after a salty dinner, but really not much other use for this beer. What flavor that is there is clean. Slight impressions of malt and sweetness. Spritzy carbonation. Weak body. Actually a decent macro, but nothing I'd turn to very often."
"I didn't pay for it, and I never will, but certainly not the worst of the American macros. Remember when Genesis were sponsored by Michelob on the 'Invisible Touch' tour? Crappy beer, crappy album...makes sense."
"Clear golden in color with bubbly, champagne-like carbonation. Thin head that forms minor traces of lacing. The nose is sweet malts, and thatÂ’s about it. A crisp delivery of grainy malts, with the almost a-typical AB adjunct paste. The mouthfeel and palate and left clean, and somewhat creamy, which is a plus. Finishes just a touch on the sweet side. Certainly not one of the best lagers, yet not the worst. LetÂ’s not get carried away though, ok?"
"Drink-Ability: Not the worst lager IÂ’ve drunken from a macro brewer but save your money on spend it on something better."
"Mouthfeel is as bad as any beer I've ever had. Way overcarbonated and watery. Just gross. Drinkability, well, I'd rather have this than a Budweiser, but that's not saying a lot. If it's between this and water, I'll probably go with water."
"Cheers!"
"Michelob came served in a pilsner, it was a typical pale yellow with almost no head. The aroma, well, it didn't smell like much. Adjunct predominates. Taste, well, there weren't any off flavors as such, just nothing special. Decent for lawnmower beer."
"Not really much to this beer. A step above the BMC macro big ticket beers. but not much. This is really not a bad beer, just does not have any of the characteristics that I have found make a good or great beer. It will do for a beer in a restaurant before dinner when nothing better is available (which is how I had it) but not worth buying when there are better chioices."
"This is so thin that I would have thought it to be a macro light if I didn't know better. It's not completely undrinkable, but is ridiculously thin and almost tasteless."
"Definitely drink this cold, as it tastes better that way. I"
"I was at a wedding recently and they had Bud, Coors Light, and this--so I decided to go with this. Slightly better than Bud, the smell was slightly fruity and the taste was dry. Good amount of carbonation, OK mouthfeel, and the drinkability was fair-good. This would be a good beer to have...at a wedding when the other choices are Bud and Coors Light."
" I would only reccomend this to someone who this beer is beer like a bud light fan other than that, I wouldn't reccomend this to any real beer drinkers."
"Eric"
"..fairly boring macro beer...not offensive but nothing unique either....a let down for all the hype about it being a super premium macro"
"That is long gone."
"I tend to rate all styles together, so thus the low score."
"Another of those ""I thought I'd already rated it"" beers. Any review of a American macro lager must be done in context of the field against which the beer competes. I won't hold Mich out as an example of a fine lager, but, as macro lagers go, it has more body and depth than most. A bit more emphasis on malt than most of AB's lagers, with a disconcerting but not overwhelming husky nature. Hopping is nondescript, but noticeably present and sufficient. Presents itself as a premium product, and manages to be adequate, which, perhaps, is all a macro lager can hope for."
"Poured this brew into a goblet and the head was firm but dissapated quickly leaving minimal lacing. Yellow golden color with a fisome rising carbonation. Smell is like a honeydew but faint. Taste is bittersweet with a more sweet aftertaste but the finish is fruity and passes very quickly. Rather bland and uneventful. I can drink it if it's the best there is to offer. However, if weekends were made for Michelob I'll be quaffing my brews on weekdays."
"Decent."
"I've been drinking this beer since I was 2 so the smell is deeply ingrained in my mind. It pours with an okay head, but this stuff is completely clear and shiny. I would prefer the chill hase be left in myself, without it the beer looks very strange. Dark yellow. Smells like your typical AB lager, full of grain of some kind probably rice and corn. God I've never seen a more translucent beer than this! Strange mouthfeel, once it gets beyond the front of my mouth it doesn't even have a mouthfeel. No real aftertaste to speak of. It's a little strange to spend so much time on a macro american lager, but for some reason the image of Bud with better ingredients seemed interesting, plus it was free. Michelob... As with Budweis, AB steals the name of another Czech town. This stuff is so boring and mediocre I had a hard time even finishing the bottle. I think budweiser might even be better."
"The paper wrapper about the throat of the bottle makes one feel this is an above average beer. It's not."
"This is reasonably drinkable. If not reviewing, I'd probably have just consumed it straight from the bottle. Better than many macros, but nothing a beer geek should actively seek out."
"D- Not a horrible premium American lager it missed its mark totally for any kind of substantial flavor. But that is what a macro-lager is right? It does not live up to its manly advertisements in Playboy back in the 1970's."
"You can't mess w/ Michelob. Its my dad's drink for god's sake. If you haven't had one, get one immediately. It is what it is, but please try it. Gotta love the Michelob. No need for a real review. It has a slight bitterness to it and can have a little bit of an aftertaste. Not the best beer in the world, but better than budweiser, for god's sake."
"Pours a dull, but crystal clear golden amber with a poorly retained white head tha leaves no lace whatsoever. Mostly a moderate grain aroma in the nose, with very subtle hints of honey and alcohol. The taste includes dissapointingly mild traces of caramel, grain, very slight alcohol, and a barely detectable hop flavor. A nearly non-existent finish with a thin mouthfeel and very little carbonation. Not recommended."
"Better than most mass-produced American lagers, in that there are no off-flavors. There's not much good either."
"Well, by the time I drank that beer, I was too far from the Beer fan I am now. It was very nice, in th emiddle of being a dark lager, but it was not annoying, after all. That is what counts from a macro lager for me. NOt refreshing at all, but you can have a good time with it, no aditives being bad in it."
"The best of michelob family, i try this beer in its new extruded aluminum bottle; superior over its sisters; appearance like a real lager, smell hops, rice, bit of malt, taste acceptable; mouthfeel not impressed; drinkability over the average; try with american food; 80% recommended"
"Notes: awful brew,it is better to drink spring water"
"Drinkability: In the world of lagers, this beer is quite weak. But compared to other American macros, this isnÂ’t too shabby (and probably one of the best A-B brews), so it has to get some points for that."
"Does 'all-malt' beers deserve better praise that their adjunct ladden counterparts? Anheuser Busch thinks so with their Michelob brand. The beer begins with a malt profile that hits on light bread / toast / caramel character, and does a better job of balancing out the sulfer compounds and tart astringencies that hinder the Busch and Bud brands. However the weak malts come across a bit raw with a touch of cola and bread dough character. Hops may balance the sweetness, but don't offer much in the way of bitterness, flavor or aroma. Though all malt, an over sparged-type astringency comes through as the sweetness fades in the finish. Perhaps a better beer than the more pale Light Lagers, but only marginally."
"Pours golden clear with a thick white head that quickly vanishes before your eyes. Rather bland nose, quite unremarkable. Very unremarkable appearance; it looks flat. Very slightly bitter with the faintest hint of hops and malt. Drinkability is average (typical lawn mowing beer). Overall, quite unimpressive though unfortunately I have had much worse (Bud Light in the can springs to mind). So essentially: itÂ’s got no head, no nose, looks flat, tastes flat, and basically has all the worst qualities of a macro lager. I would avoid this beer."
"Michelob strikes me as lousy beer, even for a macro lager. I remember drinking this stuff in my late teens (okay, mid-teens) when I thought it was a special treat, a step or two above the usual. Well it isn't. In fact, I can't even pick it over a lesser known macro with a big red bulldog on the can. I'm beginning to realize that I prefer Miller products over A-B products. However, it's only in a 'lesser of two evils' kind of way."
"Drinkability: This is supposed to be the high end AB product. Vastly overpriced IMO. I'll stick to Bud."
"poured a medium yellow color with large white head. Smell is slightly of hops with a background sweetness. Taste is light with a bit of maltiness but little if any hops detected. Refeshing in the mouth but nothing to get excited about. If you want an American Macro lager, go cheap. This costs too much."
"Pours golden with a quickly fading head. has a slightly malt smell, and thats about all you can taste as well, but not overpowering. Good carbonation and lacing, so it's fairly drinkable, but nothing that sets it apart from any other american macro."
"Poured a 2 finger white head over a very pale tan crystal clear liquid. Smells faintly of munich malt, but mostly of metalic floral saaz hops. Tastes creamy sweet with some mild metalic hop bitter. Pretty mild in flavor. The malt sweet is crisp and clean, like a lager. A hint of munich malt quality. I'm actually surprised at the amount of floral hop in the late swallow. Much more than I was expecting from a macro beer. Light body and light carbonation. Carbonation is good for the style, as it does not add any acrid foul to the beer that needs to be smooth."
"If you run low on money and this is the choice between BMC, go with this, but not if you can help it."
"This may very well be the best brew that AB makes. Pours out to a solid golden color, with a decent head that hangs around for a few moments before bubbling away. Medium carbonation, and scents of hops and barely are noted. Flavor is of your typcial lager, but a bit strong on the flavor of corn. Finished a bit watery, but had a decent aftertaste of malt. Worth a try, but there are far better lagers out there at a fraction of the price."
"Presentation: Packaged in a twelve ounce brown glass longneck with a twist off crown, served in a standard tap glass."
"Not particularly ""interesting"" but it will definitely do the job on a hot day with just about any food."
"Today, IÂ’m trying to approach this brew from an objective point of view. ItÂ’s absolutely clear, a brilliant yellow-gold color, and has a fizzy, white head. It sure is one highly carbonated, effervescent beer. The aroma is faintly hoppy, grassy, and grainy. ThereÂ’s a bit more hops than most macro brews, but their not worth getting excited about. ItÂ’s crisp, carbonic, and has a distinct dry taste. Continental hop flavor and finish. The brew is fairly watery, but other then that, thereÂ’s nothing offensive. Actually, itÂ’s an uninteresting everyday brewÂ…probably a little better than most, but IÂ’d grab a lot of other brews before settling on this one."
"Overall-while many macro lagers look fine and taste bad this lager is the opposite, it looks bad and tastes fairly good. I'll take the latter anyday. While it is an AB product and a macro, Michelob manages to have much more flavor than most macros and thus, when at a sub-standard bar, it will do in a pinch. Deserves credit for its flavor and while it won't change the world and is by no means a top notch beer (or even lager) its passable."
"Thanks to whomever left this at my St. PatrickÂ’s Day party, I thinkÂ…."
"Drinkability suffers from that grainy harshness with a touch of skunk or something. Gets worse as it goes down."
"But it is what it is, like a $5 bottle of wine, you get what pay for, and at $4.99 for a 6 pack I got what I paid for. Good for a Macro, but I'd rather be drinking something else."
"This is a decent macro lager. Pours a slightly darker than yellow piss color. Close to a cider I guess. Decent head holds up and some bubbles. Aroma actually has a hoppiness to it and a strong grainy flavor. Taste follows. It is on the bland side but I've had much blander macro lagers. There's no real off flavors and the finish is super clean. There's a biting, acidic kick right before the finish and then nothing. Too clean for my liking. Not worth the price and nothing too great about this beer but its better than most other American macros."
"WEAK, very very weak"
"So, overall, I have to give Michelob a ""thumbs down."" It's better than no beer at all, but that's about all I can say for it."
"Overall Impression: Ugh. Macrobrew. There just isnÂ’t any going back to drinking this stuff. Positive notes, dry (crisp?), and although I donÂ’t find it so, I could see others thinking it easy to drink and refreshing. IÂ’m not going to finish this one however."
"I have to admit... I have a bit of a bias toward Michelob as it was my beer of choice through the last half of the 70's, through the 80's, and well into the 90's... well before I discovered better beer. I drank it then because I thought it was smoother than Bud and tasted better than Coors. The fact that it had a slightly classier image than the other mainstream beers probably didn't hurt either. Michelob pours light gold and absolutely clear. The white head was small and didn't last very long at all. Aroma is very light. Taste is lightly malty with a bit of sweetness, with a tiny bit of hop bitterness on the finish and a tangy aftertaste. Nothing offensive, and no off flavors. Body is watery and fizzy. Very easy to drink... I could drink these all night long (and have on many occasions.)"
"Tasted: 12/19/04"
"Drinkability- Wish I would have brought my own beer. Hey at leastI get to rate it! Trying to figure out if that's bad or good though in this case."
"What do you really say about these macrobrews. I mean, who wants to come on BA and check the reviews for michelob??? anyway.... beer comes out at a light golden color, nothing special. Small head quickly goes away. Body is fuller than bud, but not that good. taste seem to be a little sweeter to me like corn syrup compared to other macros. overall i think ok for the price.... drinkable to get drunk off of. plus i like it more because it seems to be less popular than budweiser, coors or miller."
"Yeah, it's drinkable as most macros are, but there are many macros that can suit this purpose at a lower price."
"This beer pours golden and clear with very little aroma at all, maybe a hint of its claim of all imported hops. The taste is lacking everything that makes a beer good. The mouthfeel is similar to drinking a gingerale( you would be better off drinking one!). The beer is easy to drink but I wouldn't bother."
"Drinkability. For anyone whose fallback brew is something with a decent amount of body and flavor, which is probably most BA's, this has a drinkability of 5. You can imbibe this like bottled water. Not something I'll ever purchase again, though. When I'm in the mood for bland macro, I'll take PBR or High Life any day of the week, thank you very much."
"drinkability: not bad, it's nothing to rave about, for sure! but if I had a few in the fridge, I would drink them, good lawnmower beer!, and a tad better than Bud!"
"Bought this on special for $2.50 at the Silver Slipper Saloon. I can honestly say I've never tried Michelob before now...even in my college years. When the bartender handed me the bottle I noticed ""All Imported Hops"" written across the top. Hmmm..interesting I thought. Once I sat down and took my first swig I was utterly unimpressed. If there are indeed imported hops in this beer I sure as hell cannot taste them. Maybe they are imported from somewhere where the word ""hops"" references some sort of shitty cereal grain. I dunno. This had a slightly better flavor than the majority of the macro brews....but I would not drink this by choice ever again. The blatant marketing scam on the bottle is ridiculous and it pisses me off. Steer clear unless you enjoy crappy beer."
"The beer after its extraction from the 12-ounce brown bottle sets in the glass an unclouded gold with a moderate sized frothy white head and the resultant lace a thin curtain to obscure the glass. Nose is malt dominated, slightly sweet, crisp and clean with the start slightly sweet, the malt profile fair and the top light. Finish is stinging in its acidity, the hops standard for the style, a drinkable beer and I must add of all the macros this is my favorite."
"A beer that was left over after a party and it reminded me why I do not buy this stuff. This stuff is Bud with a different name. Same straw color, nearly the same grainy smell only this one added a bit of malt in there. The taste was full of corn and was not smoothe and the mouthfeel was very thick and cloying. Not recommended."
"If the bar's having a special you just can't pass on, this is drinkable. Move on to something with substance otherwise."
"Having a ""born on"" date is also a plus because you can shop for the freshest beer and if the store has not been carefull, you can tell if it's too old."
"thid beer has a fairly thick taste, not what you would expect from anheiser. first tryed it with a coworker, wasnt expecting much but suprisingly it was pretty good. a thicker version of a cheap american beer. not nearly as good as some beers out there, but also better than a lot too."
"The taste was... well, average. Light malt, some hoppines (but not bitter). An overall average beer. I could drink more of it, but only if it were the only thing available... rather go for a good IPA though. Or even a medium IPA."
"There is the faintest hint of the ""finest imported hops"" touted all over the bottle, but otherwise this beer mainly delivers alcohol in as painless a fashion as it possibly can. It is described as ""bitter"" by Miller-light aficiandos, but I find that bitterness to be fairly elusive. On the positive side, it's refreshing when ice-cold and washes a burger down handily."
"Not to bad from AB, much better than other lagers they brew. Smell is grainy with subtle hops to speak of. Taste is of rice and little malts, hop detected but very faint. Almost cheerio tasting. Feels crisp but light and is actually drinkable on a hot day, much better lagers out there, and at 5 bucks a six pack I'd rather pick up some Birra Moretti."
"Lots of fizz. Pleasant and crisp per the style. An easy beer to drink. Given the style, it's a pretty plain beer, but no major faults."
"Another macro guff brew"
"s.d."
"Overall 6/10"
"Clean short-lived white head, pale yellow liquid with ample carbonation. Weak corny nose with some very light clean yeast fruitiness. Taste is somewhat watery, with crisp fleeting maltiness, little (very little) hoppiness, it's there and *poof* it's gone. Finishes brief with adjuncty flavors left on the palate. Michelob must be Czech for ""Lawnmower Beer""."
"Note: just no reason to buy it, spend an extra couple bucks on a nice brew"
"Poured a light yellow colour with a modest white head. The smell is light with a slight malt and hop aroma to it. The taste is more of adjuncts than anything. A lot of corn. There was a fair ballance of hops and malts. But ot wasn't a bad beer. I would drink it if placed in front of me."
"Drinkable by being mostly non-offensive, the sweetest beer this manufacturer makes."
"Light feel, clean and crisp. Not good, way too light but not a horrible macro."
"Smell was lots of corn and some malt. Flavor was bready with some more of that corn. All that corn isn't so bad - itÂ’s actually OK tasting with the slight malt and bready flavors that are also in the beer. The big prob is that it keeps reminding you that youÂ’re drinking cheap ass beer. This is one of those beers that the common macro drinker brings to a party in order to be different (they don't bring bud or coors light, etc...) and every time you take a sip of it you ask yourself "" who's the idiot that tried to be cool by bringing this crap!"""
"Drunk straight from the bottle. A golden coloured brew. Aromas are of sweet malts, and decent german(?) hops. The taste is quite well balanced and light. This tastes like ""beer"" but it is much better than a Bud. The mouthfeel is MOR and the drinkability is decent. Not bad for an AB brew."
"This beer poured a clear, fizzy yellow with a thin white foam head that settled. The smell was minimal with hints of malt and hops. The taste was on the sweet side but very thin. Some malt flavors, but low on hops. The mouthfeel was fairly smooth and thin, with medium light body and medium carbonation. Overall not really offensive, but not big on flavor or body."
"Stopped for a slice, and this was the best beer choice available (!) The waitress actually brought me a plastic cup!!! I asked for a glass, and she told me they don't have any! I drank it from the bottle. Years ago, when I only drank macros, this was my favorite. It is still better than most of them, with some taste and mouthfeel (albeit not much). I would only drink this under circumstances like tonight, but it is better than Bud, Corona, and many other swill lagers."
"not worthy of beer drinker's attention. might be good for a kids' drinking game?"
"The beer pours a light gold color with a lacey white head. The aroma is weak with that tradtional clean pale malt lager scent. The taste is good. It is a clean tasting macro with decent flavor. It isn't complex, but the masses will enjoy it. The mouthfeel is excellent. Like most macros, it is low bodied and highly carbonated. If this is cold enough, it is highly drinkable and rather enjoyable for those large party crowds."
"Can you tell that I have a Michelob Sampler Pack in my fridge right now? :)"
"Average. That is it. Better than extremely cheap beers, worse than expensive ones. A non-offensive beer that doesn't take any chances. This is supposed to be AB's premium line of beers, i wonder where all that money went? If you don't want anything interesting to drink, grab a Michelob."
"Surprisingly enough I have actually found an Anheuiser Busch product I actually like (other then Michelob Ultra). This beer was much better then I had expected. It really did not have that much of a bite, and it went down very smoothly as well. I drank this right before I had my first ever Sam Adams, and I have to admit, I like Michelob a heckuva lot better then I like Sammy."
"Poured in the typical fizzy yellow beer profile. Head was nonexistent within 15 seconds - I counted. Light smell of malt and hops can be barely discerned above the smell of air surrounding the top of the beer. Good hop character for a FYB, but nothing at all amazing. Mouthfeel is thin - par for the course. Not a bad rendition, but no reason to rush out and try it. I bought the sampler case because it had two free glasses in it. I'm a sucker for free glasses, even if it means drinking my way through 18 mediocre brews."
"It's got a nuttier, fuller flavor than most of the cheap American macrobrews. I still have trouble drinking the stuff. If I'm going for a cheap beer, I'll usually just grab something that has no flavor instead of one that's a little more expensive with mediocre flavor."
"The first thing that I noted was the can said that it contained ""All Imported Hops"". I thought that AB grew most of their own hops in Washington at Elk Mountain (Remember the short-lived brews by that name?). Anyway, it could have used some of those hops. Not very aromatic. The color is a shade darker than the typical macro yellow (almost golden). Big white head. The taste is a malty sweet, with a lighter body. It has the signature Michelob sweet aftertaste that is typical in all of its beers. At least it was cold!"
"I was not expecting much out of this beer but it did show me that it's taste wasn't half bad and that it was drinkable. It didn't look or smell any different than the other macros but it did taste ok. This is probably because it wasn't the light version. Not a great brew or even one I would rely on. Just a decent macro."
"This beer poured into the glass a crystal clear golden color, and good carbonation bubbles present. The head that was produced was fluffy and white in color. Some last (a few seconds) then fell to nothing. There was no lace present. The aroma was very-very light. I did manage to get some sweet malt and grains from it. But that was it. The flavors were also fairly weak in nature. I tasted some light malt, and grains that was it. No hops detected even though it states that they were imported. No aftertaste. This beer is crisp and light, it managed to quench my thirst, and that was all I was looking for at the moment. Over all impression, OK, I guess. A little pricey for a macro six pack, but when you have limited choices this is the one to chose."
"Average....pours a clean golden tone with a nice medium white head, some carbonation and little to no lacing. Weak wheaty/malty smell with perhaps a bit of hops. A decent taste, with full bodied robust maltyness with some carbonation enhancing it, while the end is complimented with a nice and easy going bitterness (it preaches all imported hops). This all provides for a nice mouthfeel, and the easy it is to drink gives room for a second. That makes it a nice lager all-in-all."
"""born"" on June 23, 2003"
"Comments Â– Sorry to diss this one. I was well-intentioned at the onset after looking and sniffing, but I hate being lied to. I tossed this in the freezer for half an hour before tasting, too. How disappointing."
"To be honest, this is a very drinkable beer. It pours out to the standard, golden color of its style. Slightly sweet with a non-offensive, even lightly hopped taste. Acceptable, but not remarkable. Better than most of the AB offerings. I'd take it over a Heineken."
"A friend of mine gave me a bottle of this to try (wouldn't buy it on my own), she seems to like it a fair bit, but also drinks it from the bottles. I however can smell a rat the moment I pop off the bottle cap. Pale clear straw colour, leaning more towards the anemic end of the spectrum. Small ring after head quickly fades. Aroma is a bit caustic, grainy but not much else. Flavour rips a grainy strip across the tongue, leaving an unwelcome aftertaste in its wake. Corn adjuncts abound. Pehaps I should have stuck it in the freezer for half an hour and drank it straight out of the bottle. Nope, I wouldn't even accept this for free next time."
"Yellow fizzy in appearance white thin head quickly dissipates into nothing not much of anything going on here just ""American"" beer with as the label reads ""All Imported Hops"". Aromatics well has some detectable hops going on here just a touch with the corn and rice adjuncts also coming through with sweetness overall unoffensive to passive for me. Flavor consists of a sharp sweet adjunct ridden tone with the hop bitterness coming in to create a mediocre American light lager that should be the flagship beer of Anheuser Busch when compared to Budweiser. Not bad for AB but let's just say in the realm of lagers this is on the bottom of the pile but it's available everywhere and more drinkable then most macro products. Mouthfeel is thin and light bodied no texture extreme carbonation like a soda. Drinkability give me something worth my time glad I didn't purchase this one."
"In conclusion, a decent AB beer that I'm not ashamed to buy, and it probably goes well with a burger or steak."
"I won't be getting this again, but if you see it, and that's your only beer choice, it won't be the worst beer ever. I would think it would make a decent session beer, or a beer to have when among non BA-ers...it would give them a familiar name, and a slightly more interesting beer. Basically inofensive, no off-tastes that I could pick up on. Pat"
"Pale golden in color with a white head. Mouthfeel is thin and fizzy. Bland and uninspired taste consisted mainly of watered down malt and some mild hop bitterness. With all the hoopla on the label about the ""Imported Hops", I would have thought this beer might have been a little more inspired. Oh well, the choice at where I was was at was either this or Miller High Life Light, so I went with the Michelob. For the uninitiated, this functions as a pretty non-offensive beer. Nothing special here."
"Ultra translucent, no animation, dull. Smallish white head, fair retention, minimal. Sweet malt/adjunct nose, itÂ’s a mess. The flavors on the palate are light, slightly sweet but not completely offensiveÂ… some graininess. Lacks any influence of the Â“all imported hops.Â” The malt backbone is fragile. Quick finish. Medium-light body with minimal carbonation. All in all, this isnÂ’t half bad but it still induced a headache."
"Drinkability: Prepare to burp often, very filling."
"This is one of the better beers when you want to drink higher class beers and you don't have a lot of money. Not as good as a Molson or Fosters this beer is average. The beer has a clean refreshing taste and goes down easily. It is best drank out of the bottle. The worst part of this beer like all Bud products would have to be the quick loss of carbonation."
"I mentioned the wedding reception early because I sampled this out other choices of Natural Light and Heineken. Unfortunately I had the Heineken first. Fortunately I was very surprised by this Michelob and have a new default macro if no better choice presents itself. That being said I hope there is always a better choice."
"ah, michelob. it's a shame that on a rare occasion i would find myself making this purchase solely for the lava lamp shaped bottles (kinda like foster's for the big-ass oil can...low on cash, at least get something fun). sadly, where have ye gone? michelob out of a normal bottle just makes the nastiness even more apparent. pours the standard a-b piss yellow with a lovely watery taste that hints of rice and corn (perhaps?). nothing unexpected here. overall, another very boring brew from a very boring brewery."
"NOTE: I think given the horrid appearance and non-descript aroma this beer is better drank right from the bottle."
"Somewhat better than average for an A-B beer. The pour creates a standard looking macro beer with light color and dissipating head. The smell is largely of malt with a small sense of adjunts. Fairly standard A-B taste with less bite in the flavor than usual. A bit of astringency in the finish."
"Mouth feel was very light and after drinking it in a thirsty condition, it was quite refreshing. Other beers I can think of would also fit the bill, but I feel this one of the best of the macro brewers. Given the choice of whatÂ’s available in many bars, this may be one of the better choices. Take that for what itÂ’s worth."
"Very clear gold color...total ""stabilizer"" head of very white foam with bubbles hanging beneath the surface -- lasts about 20 seconds. Sweet cream corn aroma. Starts with some maple malt and medium body but quickly deconstructs and thins to grainy mid mouth. Not as overcarbonated as some. Hops show some juicy qualities but little overall character -- but prevent an unpleasant, if over sweet, swallow. There are worse, I suppose, but nothing of any character in the malt department."
"I was forced to buy this since it came in a 12-pack with some others that are only available in this ""special"" 12-pack. I know, the pains of being a bottle collector. What is the big deal about imported hops (splashed on the label), there wasn't many and we have a ton of good ones in this country. Good carbonation and head, leaves a lace and not much else. Very light bodied, almost watery not much taste at all I am glad there are only two of these. The ABV is 5.0%."
"Another disappointing beer from AB. It comes off as a ""premium"" beer, but is anything but that. It pours with almost no head. Smell is of adjuncts and grain. Taste has very little if any hop signature. Malt is present, but weak. Aftertaste is grainy and dry. I am sorry to say, I had trouble finishing this beer. It was if all the ingredients were played out before the brewing process began. Disappointed."
"for one of the big guys, i am not impressed at all. As bland as the other big beers are, they are mostly clean and crisp which i feel that michelob is not. in fact, the smell is rather offensive."
"Very typical of Michelob/AB. Nice colouring and limited head. The taste is very similar to the Michelob Marzen...every thing about this product is similar to the Marzen, only the label is different. Certainly drinkable, but with reservations."
" but refreshing when ice cold !"
"Did not seek thisone out but had it offered with pizza at the inlaws. Wasn't bad with the meal. Appears a clear straw gold with a white head that maintained ok though a tad fizzy.Even alittle lace. A slightly sweet taste & aroma. Slight hop balances this to a crisp clean ( dry ) mouthfeel. Like I said, not bad with piz & inlaws!"
"Like the majority of American-Style Lagers, this one is very drinkable, and refreshing.  This one being a Premium lager, it has a bit more flavor to it.  It pours to a brilliant, clear straw color with a white head that quickly diminishes.  However, it does leave a bit of lace-work when sipped down.  It has a faint hop aroma, with a bit of grainy smell.  Again, there is a bit of grain in the flavor with low malt and hop flavor.  This beer is light-bodied, and it has a carbonic bite.  Overall, it is a smooth, easy drinking beer, with a bit more flavor than your Standard, and Light American Lagers."
"goes down smooth and crisp with a little fruitiness in the backround. it is definitely drinkable, much better than other Anh-busch products. no immediate headache. there is not a whole lot of flavor, but for what it is, it is better than its brothers."
