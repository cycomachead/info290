It's nice to find a brew of this style without the fillers that the mass-market beers consist of.

The taste brings in more of the same, but with more corn, which is now even sweeter than before. The body is fairly light, with a light moderate carbonation and a sorta watery feel.

There is maybe a dash of hops added- clean brew, nothing exciting but that is more of a result of style.

Aroma is starchy and plain with an off-sweetness of corn husk and dulled grasses, maintains a slight crispness, but comes across way too starchy for my liking Although, that resides as it warms. The taste is about what you'd expect, a bit sweet, not as starchy as the smell but its there, dulled hops, crisp sweet malts, lingering husk grain thats a bit raw and the kind of bittering that I just don't like where its kinda metalic and twingey with a sharp hard water tone. Some of that fades though as it warms. The feel is actually pretty darn good considering. Nice crispness in the middle. One of the better, more full pale lagers I've come across. If it weren't for the finish of off bittering it would be perfect I think. But that said its still a bit on the boring side, the sweetness isn't to bad once it warms up a bit in both the smell and flavor.

4,35.1,4,4,4,4,4,"I guess I'm not a true beer snob after all. I like this brew. It looks good. It has decent head retention and nice color. It smells sweet and inviting. It tastes tangy and sweet with a touch of hop flavor and aroma. Finishes clean and refreshes. For what it is, a light-flavored session beer, it hits the spot.","EagleTalon","Aug 30, 2003"
3.41,15.2,4,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"I sought this beer while on vacation in Oklahoma. I found this and the bock only, in the Shiner line, and found I enjoyed the Blonde the most. As with the other reviews, it poured a clear straw/gold color. The head was a nice two inch, medium carbonation no fizz, white. The aroma was of sweet grain. The taste was also a sweeter grainy malt with little hop but a slight bitter finish. What sold me on this blonde was the creamy feel I noticed on the mouth. A very smooth, drinkable brew. When given the chance, i'll pick up somemore. It makes a good summer gold beer.","chilidog","Aug 30, 2003"
2.7,-8.8,3,3,2.5,3,2.5,"This beer works hard to stay within the limits defined by the typical American macro lager - and does nothing to distinguish itself. Sweet, grainy malt does all the talking. Hops barely make a peep, which is not uncharacteristic for the style. Turns a touch tart at the end, with a noteworthy astringency at the finish that helps clean up the palate and adds a touch of interest to the beer. This brew is solidly entrenched in the lawnmower lineup.","Brent","May 06, 2003"
3,1.4,3,3,3,3,3,"The beer is a translucent straw or gold color if you prefer with a modest head and a frothy texture, the color a bright white and the remaining lace a thin curtain to cover the glass. Nose is clean and fresh malt dominated and slightly sweet with the front sweet, the top cadaverous. The finish is benign in its acidic bite; the hops are purposeful and a touch spicy, dry as a bleached desert bone aftertaste. Shiner beers are drinkable, great No, but they do make fine lawn mower beer, so whats wrong with that? Nothing in my books, and better than many beers Ive drank.","Gusler","Dec 01, 2002"
2.98,0.7,3,2.5,3,3,3.5,"Pours a light pale golden color with a thin white head that quickly dissipates. Almost no aroma at allperhaps a faint hop bitterness. Flavor is of light hops and grains and is quite crisp. A definite step up from the macros and would be nice on a hot day.","Morris729","Nov 18, 2002"
2.75,-7.1,3,3,2.5,2.5,3,"Pale gold with a big head that disappears very quickly and is macro foam-like in character.  Sense of some candy corn to the aroma along with decent hop.  The flavor is seriously macro-like to my tongue, quite a bit of corn syrup with a leaning toward overcarbonation and the same brief hop cut of a Bud.  Ranks close to other regional Lagers like Grain Belt, Rolling Rock, etc...i.e. -- worthy of support from locals.","ADR","Oct 14, 2002"
3.28,10.8,3.5,3,3,3.5,4,"Good drinkable pale lager.  Better taste than your average Bud product.  Light color, average flavor, but better than most.  One step up.  Not the best, better than bad.  Substitute this one for the others if you're on the  fence.","TAMU99","Oct 04, 2002"
2.78,-6.1,3,2.5,2.5,3,3.5,"Pours a very pale yellow with a a 1 1/2 finger white head that dissipates very rapidly.  The smell is that of sweet corn and not much else.  Reminds me of a beer that is slightly more dry than an American macro.  Not much in the flavor department.  Just a clean crisp light bodied beer with no character.  Not much going on here.  Cheers nonetheless!","BeerAngel","Sep 18, 2002"
2.88,-2.7,3,2.5,3,3,3,"It is "Distinctly Shiner" though!","bditty187","Sep 04, 2002"
3.18,7.4,3.5,3,3,3.5,3.5,"Medium golden color with a nice white cloudtop head, lots of carbonation, slight lace.  Aroma of cooked grains and some hops, not much else.  Fairly smooth taste, begins with understated malts which soon fade as the hops begin to assert themselves, finishes crisp, dry and a touch bitter.  Overall, a fairly insubstantial beer, but easy to drink, and with nothing to offend.  A decent hot weather beer, goes well with barbeque or southwestern cuisine.","Pegasus","Aug 02, 2002"
3.1,4.7,3.5,3.5,3,2.5,3,"Straw hue w/ a moderate head that sticks.  Typical grainy notes in aroma, but an unexpected mild Saaz hop spiciness is present. A bit more character than the typical American lager.  Thin mouthfeel and weak body...  It's quite dry and very attenuated probably from the adjuncts.  There's very little malt flavor, and nothing memorable in flavor all around.  Hop bitterness is paltry.  Finishes bland, dry, and clean. It's a brew to quaff and forget about.  Only slightly better than the typical macrobrew. I'd rather drink this than soda, however.","marc77","Apr 27, 2002"
3.06,3.4,3,2,3,4,4,"Notes: On par with the big three (Bud, Miller, Coors) if not a tad better, that is a hard thing to do being that beers this small have to be flawless regardless if they have little flavour or not. On a hot sweaty day this would be a perfect ice cold beer to grab.","Jason","Nov 19, 2001"
