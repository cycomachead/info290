4.3,50.3,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.25,"Yuengling Premium Beer brew by Yuengling Brewery, with an ABV of 4.40% This brew pours out a nice amber color with a nice white head.  The smell is sweet with grains and malts. You pick up a hit of hops in the smell of this brew.  Now for the taste it is sweet with grains and malts. Not bad but not great.  Yuengling Premium Beer has a nice balance to it, there is nothing overpowering in this brew.  The mouthfeel of  Yuengling Premium Beer is nice,clean and smooth.  There is nothing bad about this brew. I like how this brew goes down smooth.  Overall I'm giving Yuengling Premium Beer a 4.25 out 5. This brew is a nice drinking brew.  Nothing fancy but nothing cheap.  I would buy this brew again.  Thank you Yuengling Brewery","nicholas2121","Feb 02, 2015"

If at a party drinking many beers with many wings I think it is a good choice.  Pleasant taste and aroma.  Looks light in color and has a clean smooth taste to match.  Poured with a decent head, but it did not last long.  Very mild hop aroma.  Some say it has a corn flavor??  I cannot say I detect that, but it is certainly light in flavor.  If I were going to drink one beer each night, I would pick something more full bodied...but as a party brew, this is pretty good.","UKBeerman","Nov 23, 2014"

It's got some nice bready hop and banana that set it apart from the rest and actually reminds me a little of Natural Ice. I'm not secretly aching inside wishing they sold it here in my part of the country, but I'd try it again if offered. It is a capable and tasty adjunct lager.","The-Adjunct-Hippie","Oct 27, 2014"

3.08,7.7,3,2.5,3,3,4,"I had high, high hopes for this beer when I tried it. Yuengling Premium! It must be a step above the Traditional right? How awesome would that be? Well I guess we'll never know (from the Yuengling Brewery that is) because this is definately NOT a step above traditional. It is a step below. It turns out that ""Premium"" is a euphamism for ""Macro"". That's what this is, Yuengling Brewery doing a Macro style beer, as opposed to Traditional, which is well traditional (That's Amber American Lager, it was a style which was a much bigger pre-prohibition staple in America). Anyway the color is a sort of clear-gold. Not nearly as deep as say Urquell but noticably more amber than most macros. Compared to the Traditional its lighter and clearer. Smell is pretty boring. A little sweet grain and a lot of hops. The hops are kind of hard to describe. I guess I'd call them metallic or typical macro if I found them objectionable, but I don't. They're pretty bitter, but leave no unpleasant aftertaste. They're clean and surprisingly strong for the style, but still not too interesting. I guess the best way to describe them would be typical macro hops if typical macro hops were't disgusting. They are balanced by light malts that are slightly sweet. Mouthfeel is all about carbonation. Maybe this would feel thin if not for all those bubbles, but I honestly can't tell you. I could taste the beer fine, but carbonation was all the mouthfeel I could get. Drinkability is fine. You could definately drink these all night. The hops don't get in my way, the taste isn't bad, nothing is wrong with this except that no store or bar exists that carries this unless they carry the Traditional Lager as well, so why bother? This is obviously what Yuengling brewed to catch the Budweiser crowd. And the result? Well it splits the difference. It definately kicks Budweiser's ass by not being the least bit nasty or looking anything like urine. But Traditional Lager in turn kicks its ass by looking the way real beer should look and packing a lot more taste. Uses? Serving to my friends who when I tell them my favorite beer say ""Yuengling? That's like liquid bread"" or ""Wow that's really strong beer."" This would be a good compromise for them, maybe even a good gateway to discovery of the fact that there are more than 3 breweries in this country. I would call this the best macro-style out there except who the hell wants a macro-style beer from a regional brewery even if they do a good job? The Traditional owns this and the easily outsells it besides.","casualbeerman","Jan 04, 2006"
3,4.9,3,3,3,3,3,"This beer poured a crystal clear yellow color with a one figne frothy white head, which went down quickly. Streams of bubbles arose from the bottom. Smell was malty. Taste consisted of light malt which became fuller throughout. A slightly sweet quality was also detected, as was a metallic quality to the beer. Light in the mouth, but not too watery. An okay brew.

3.78,32.2,4,3.5,4,3,4,"IMHO, rating beer is ike rating pies or sandwiches. You can't compare dutch apple to pumpkin if you're not a pumpkin fan (which I am, by the way). Likewise, a PBJ will never measure up to a BLT (unless you truly prefer peanut butter). Yuengling is going out on a limb to call this beer ""premium," but in the realm of comparing similarly priced adjunct (regional) macro lagers, this is a keeper. Smooth, easy to drink, nicely carbonated, refreshing, balanced taste, and (given its limited distribution area) quite fresh to boot. Much different than the Traditional Lager, yet equally unique in its quality. Yuengling has a reputation for taking the macro-brew to a whole new level of taste. This one is no exception!","tugdriver7","Aug 29, 2005"

The head isnt worth much: thin turning to non-existence. Mild aromas: cereal grains, CO2, faint hops. It has very watery and muted tastes, similar to the aroma. In its defense, its easy to drink, and would probably be a good summertime lawn-mowing thirst-quencher. All in all, though, I wont be trying it again.","Suds","Apr 03, 2005"

It has a very light and refreshing flavor, but it lacks in beer taste. It tastes really watered down. The mouthfeel is good. It is a low bodied beer with good carbonation. This is a good adjunct lager. It's not at all skunky or musty and it goes down quick. I like the aroma and the taste is better than most. This is a good drinker.","WesWes","Feb 22, 2005"

Pale straw to golden with tight carbonation streamers up the glass and a modest head. Aroma was a bit sweet, with some grain notes. Light flavor, with some sweet grain.

Body is definitely more substantial than more American lagers. Goes down pretty easily, it's a good session beer.

3.03,5.9,3.5,3,3,3,3,"A crystal-clear straw-gold body is topped by a good-sized head of creamy bright white foam. The retention is good, and although it drops in size rather quickly, it also maintains a thin surface covering for some time. Additionally, some nice lace is also present and adds greatly to the appearance. The nose is fresh and clean, delivering a straight-forward grainy malt and some minor yeast character. The body is light and crisp. The flavor is exactly as the aroma suggests with a lightly grainy malt, a very subtle background hop flavor, and an underlying bitterness. It finishes short and dry. There's not enough going on in the flavor to keep it interesting, but at least it's not as sweet as some of the mainstream macros available right now. At the very least, it's a refreshing, crisp and clean lager that's perfect for extended outdoor activities during hot summer days.","NeroFiddled","Jun 17, 2003"

2.9,1.4,2.5,2.5,3,2.5,3.5,"Spotted this one out at Chicken Chuck's been meaning to give the premium beer a whirl since I have had all of Yuengling's other products. Besides the bottle is a short stubby quart that just looks vintage and classic at the same time. The appearance of this beer is a golden yellow with a very bright white head decent head retention going on here. The aroma though is of faint malt sweetness along with semi harsh slighlty cooked vegetable tones mainly corn and rice. Very similar to other macros in appearance and aroma, but the taste is much better than most. Very clean and refreshing crispness that does of some malted barley somewhere and there no off flavors attempting to induce my gag reflex. So, all in all this beer aims for mediocrity and comes out a winner. This is nothing special just good ol' American light lager compares with Iron City to me. Lighter bodied beer designed to be drank on a hot summer day after mowing the lawn, I enjoy this beer for the time.

3.57,24.8,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"In Pottsville and the surrounding communities, this beer is simply known as ""Premium."" It's been a staple for Yuengling and helped to maintain the brewery during the lean times before the Lager was reintroduced. For an American Lager, Premium isn't too bad. From the tap, this beer poured a translucent, pale yellow color, with a thin head that retained for only a few minutes. Faint floral hints and a strong maltiness defined the aroma. An immediate sweetness greeted the tongue upon tasting, and a hint of hops was also detected after swallowing. While I often drink this beer, upon reviewing it I was a bit surprised at how much the malt character actually overpowers the hops. Still, it had a good taste, and a decent mouthfeel. One of the beer's enduring qualities, however, is its drinkability. This is an excellent session beer, and whenever it's on tap and I'm planning on staying a while, I always request Premium. It's a great altermative to macros, and it never disappoints.","SchmichaelJ","Dec 15, 2002"

Has a hoppy bite in it and mellow maltness to it. Color is slightly lighter than the lager but head and its retention is identical. Extremely drinkable as the flavors keep this beer from boring your palate after a few and a six pack wont fill up your stomach. Doesnt have that overpower sweet taste the lager does after one or two. This brew's mouthfeel isnt really anything special. The lager has a silkyness to it when swallowed. Thats the only characteristic that it is superior in though.","allboutbierge","Dec 05, 2002"
