"O: A good go at a yellow lager, much better than an adjunct. I'm glad I gave it a whirl. As a malthead, I'd have liked a little less grass and a little more biscuit, but I know I'm in a minority in that respect."

"O: Wow, not what I was expecting. Appearance and aroma is so-so but the flavors are sharp, bold and crisp. Very flavorful for 5.8%. Great crispness and I'm honestly blown away by the strength of flavors given that this is lower ABV and is not a hop bomb or a sour. Drinks great, tastes great, really impressed by this one from Pretty Things."

"O - An unpronounced lager here, I enjoyed it very much. Doesn't go overboard with the flavorings, this is a beer when you are looking for something fresh on a summer night. Won't weigh you down."

"First beer from Pretty Things, has a faint aroma of grass and earth with some bread aftertones. Really nice flavor profile for an ale, has a bit of a heavy aftertaste/hoppy feeling that's carried by the relatively high ABV for an ale. Drinks really easily though and overall is a great beer I would have again. Love the marketing as a ""lawnmower beer"" - the beer you should enjoy while mowing the lawn. Well said, and encapsulates a lot of what this beer is."
"Poured into a Dogfish Head pint glass. Pours a light golden amber with active carbonation that keeps a one finger creamy white head growing slightly in the glass. Aroma of sweet pale and biscuit malt with light grassy hops. Flavor is biscuit and crystal malt with grassy hops, finishing with a mild cream corn and lingering pilsner style hop bitterness. Medium bodied with a nice mouth feel. A well made light lager that has a nice hop bill that is complemented by the full biscuit malt body. Not an exciting style, but as usual for Pretty Things, nicely made and great to drink."
"thanks to drlovemd87 for hooking me up with YET ANOTHER wonderful beer, this guy deserves a medal. better than your average summer type lawnmower beer, this is sweeter, richer, and far more malty. its nose and smell match its color wheel pinpoint, where yellow just begins to melt into brown, dim but lively. heady and lacy and fit for some white summer wedding. the smell and taste are decadently malted and only bittered on the hop front. its definitely a lager too, with a bready and dry quick finishing yeast that hints at old school european stuff. grassy hops round it out, but yeast and sweet malt are whats memorable for me here. my critique of this beer, and it is indeed substantial, is the 7% alcohol by volume. such strength is not useful in this style, makes it heavier, and honestly sacrifices some of the better properties of a good lager to pursue such strength. the beer works in flavor, but bomber is a tough dose when you are flying solo, and when you want to jump around beers and styles, this gets a little chewy, but its a cool brew, i just wish for reduced residual sweetness and booze, not that i can taste the alcohol, but i can feel it, and with all the sugar thats still in this beer, it gets a bit terminal. that said, these guys are clearly brewing some of the best beer in mass, and i am grateful for the opportunity to drink this one. not really late december beer, but nevermind that."
"This right here is ""The Great American Lager," my children."
"O: If this is a ""true lager"" as the label claims, I want more! This is a delicious, drinkable, interesting, impressive beer. Highly recommended to all."

"American Darling is almost a mockery of what the industrial macro-brewing culture has done to beers. Even as it displays a few warts in ts portrayal, it also highlights how these flavors would have beer prevailed in beers from even a hundred years ago."
""

"Overall this is a solid brew from Pretty Things. Next time I'd like to try it fresh."

"O: Good brew and not your typical mild flavored lager."
"O: The label on the bottle says 5.8% abv, so I'll go with that and say that regardless of the abv, it's very easy to drink. It definitely has that grainy and huskiness going on so if you like that in your lager, then this will be a great beer for you. Not too shabby for under $6 for a bomber, either. Recommended"

"i've liked every beer pretty things made so far. this is my least favorite and so far, the only one i won't pick up again. the alcohol taste is completely rugged.. like nikoff vodka was just mixed in with the wort."
""
""
""
"My overall impression is that this is a delicious beer. Sure to impress “yellow” beer drinkers who have not strayed from big macro brews (may even convert a few)."
""
""
""
"O: Another fine beer from Pretty Things! Can they make a bad beer? I don't think so."
""
"A big step up from the typical lager. Poured a 2"" custard head with decent retention time. The body is a slightly hazed golden yellow. It smells mildly of toasted malt. The taste is a little sweet but with stronger than expected toasted malt, a saltiness, and yeastyness. In fact it's kind of like a concentrated lager except for the absence of the grassiness and bitterness so common. Fairly long finish."
""
""
"Overall: Why can't every pale lager be this delicious? Because of the high ABV, I'm not sure I'd drink it while mowing the lawn (despite the label) but it's a nice summer beer."
""
""
""
"That's this tasty beer. Beauty of a poor -nice head, nice retention, straw/golden yellow, tiny seltzer-like bubbles constantly making their trip. Sweet grassy nose; mainland Europe noble hop presence. It's more of a BIG adjunct in flavor, even though it's all barley, and even though it's a bunch of hallertau. The sweetness of the malt just reminds me of that corn sweetness you get in some adjuncts. Super pale lager, maybe strong lager should be the style? It's fantastic, but there is a bit of a viscous texture combined with that sometimes corn syrupy sweetness that makes it not as refreshing as the style typically can be. 7% is a tall order too. Anyhow, get one of these if you're at all interesting in the ""yellow"" side of lagers."
""
"O: The nose and the taste are nearly opposites in terms of balance. The nose is a bit more hop-forward, while the malt is more dominant in the taste. Malt tastes are complex and shifty, thanks to the decoction mashing and the resulting melanoidin action. Tastes a little hot this year though, I don't remember the alcohol being quite as prominent when I had this in the past. Worth a try if you're into German-style lagers."
""
"Mouthfeel is a little too sticky for me- medium light body with light carbonation; a little chewy. Not quite my idea of a summer refresher but decent. I won't get it again."

"From the 22 oz bottle dated June 2010, Batch 2. Probably over the hill. Bought at the Old Philly Ale House, not noticing the bottle date, so beware if you shop there."
"Poured from a brown 22 oz. bottle. Has a deep golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of grains, some malts. Taste is alcohol up front, some grains, a touch of malts, makes me wonder if something is wrong with my bottle as more alcohol flavors are coming through. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a decent beer."
"This is drinkable enough, but not anything I am really that excited about. This definetly a proper lawn mower brew"

"o - Overall a pretty nice pale lager, though I wonder what it was like fresh in July. The lemon was very up front in the nose and taste, and there were some floral and citrus hops still there, but I imagine 5 months ago this was even better. Would like to have fresh and worth checking out, though I probably wouldn't buy a 6 month old bottle again."

"The aroma was light. Lots of light grain and bready malts abound here. Small light fruit notes and an overall light profile. Taste was more of the same, light grain, light fruits, small doses of grain. A crisp, clean, and refreshing profile. Very light feel with an almost non existently light feel. Super drinkable"

"Overall a very impressive full tasting bodied beer."
"O - Overall really liked this Pretty Things offering. Definately a sessionable summer beer."
"Tastes mad adjuncty, but not in a bad way. Bitter cereal malt starts things off, getting sweet and grassy in the middle and then ending on middle strength bitterdry hops. Nothing relays the fairly large ABV, though there's still a bit too much going on here for this to be a considered a lanwmower beer. But since it'd be nuts to fault a beer for being too flavorful, I think I'll let that one slide."
"O: I don't particularly dislike this beer, but I also don't feel like it's to style or what I expected. For a ""lawnmower beer"" (even going so far as to make that image the focus of the label) it's just not all that refreshing. And 7% ABV is a bit much."
" Really the balance is what I am liking so much about this beer, the balance is just so spot on. This is far more enjoyable than I was expecting, though to be honest I was expecting something interesting from this no matter what."
"Yellow and slightly hazy served in a goblet. Small amount of head but it dissipated almost completely. Nose is grainy pils malt and some peppery hop zest. Yeast character is strong for a pale lager. The spicy yeast and peppery hops are a great combination over the malt. Flavor is just like the nose a light body with a strong pale malt character. On top is a lot of the peppery hop and yeast combo. Crisp bite up front with the middle being all malt and yeast. Finishes light and dry with a large amount of carbonation and the spicy hops."
"Mouthfeel is very light and crisp, with a light body, high carbonation and a dry zesty finish. A definite session beer, this was a fantastic lager with a lot of flavor to go along with the light feel. This is what is session beer should be like, and again I will mention that this great taste completely hides the ABV. Go get one!"
"Poured into a traditional pilsner glass. Nice golden yellow hue with a frothy 2 finger head. Aroma has some pale malt mixed with light floral hops with a spritz of lemon. All of this is subdued however. Taste is much much more prominent than the smell. Nice light malt background with some great lager hops. Some nice grass/dry hay notes mixed in with a floral bouquet. Small bit of white pepper lingering in the background. Mouthfeel is on the thinner side of medium but it has a good carbonation level and a great crisp bite on a hot day where again it was pushing 100 degrees around here. Would definitely seek this out again. The more Pretty Things I get to try the more I like them."
"Overall: This is a great summer beer. I love the fact that they actually hopped this beer. The bitterness in the finish is quite good. I would definitely have another."
"The CPJ"
"Many thanks to Nuggethops for the chance to taste this. A very generous extra included in our recent trade. Poured into my dfh snifter, pours a gorgeous bright yellow color, visible bubbles from the bottom. awesome fluffy cloudlike white head fills the glass and then recedes, nice retention. Smell- fresh cut grass, lemon peel, cracked pepper. Why does this remind me of a Saison? Taste- just a really crisp, smooth, yet hoppy lager. wonderful. Mouthfeel- tight carbonation makes for a really nice dry finish. Drinkability. 6.5% wow- could have fooled me. This is just a solid, well made brew."
"overall i typically do not gun for lagers but am enjoying this, especially on this 90+ degree day. another above-average offering from pretty things."
"Love this is being pitched as lawnmower beer. It is a true summer quencher with some character. Another good one from these guys."
"I had American Darling on tap last summer and really enjoyed it, and I'm glad to see that this second batch is equally enjoyable. This is a great seasonal from Pretty Things – it’s hard not to like this one. If it were in cans, I'd pick up a sixer weekly."
"Shockingly, at one year old, this beer is actually GOOD. I can't imagine with a little more crispness (this had gone a touch flabby) and some bright hop flavors this isn't spectacular. Hopefully I can find out, and hopefully, I'm right."
"Overall: Surprisingly light in every aspect but carbonation. Flavours are nice and balanced, no boozy flavour either considering the ABV and possible increase of a year of cellaring."
"Pours a mostly-clear straw color with a good white head that is quite large. It's fizzy and goes down quickly, leaving some spotty lacing. The nose brings a moderate amount of malt with some bread, grain, and straw. Behind that are some herbal and floral hops. The flavor takes through a light amount of grainy sweetness along with some moderate bitterness, with floral hops coming through in the finish. Good carbonation on a light body with a dry and somewhat bitter finish. Pretty good beer. Huge thanks, Vince!"
"O: Wow."
"a fantastic little lager of a beer that is a perfect transitional for mass produced stuff to a particular beer specialist. A lager with a english hint and brisk grass american tingle. Pour is yellow almost soft green. Nice froth bread carbonation. Nose of honey, assam tea, and lemon pulp. Palate is that with a malty caramel and a grassy bitter hint."
"Very easy to drink!"
"D. Great for a lager. I like this a lot."
"Pours a pale yellow. a bit murky with a bit of white head that hangs around. Pretty solid appearance for a light lager like this. Smells GREAT. Apple, floral aromas and some nice light citrus. Tastes sweet. Like candied belgian yumminess. Lots of apple and other light fruit flavours. Very tasty and balanced. Some light hops as well. Nice solid mouthfeel. Very nice overall"
"For a lager, it's pretty damn flavorful."
"Been working through the locals, and am on the Pretty Things line up now. this beer was a surprise to me. Looks great with a starw body, dood head, good lace. Smells, hoppy, malty, yeast. The taste was a great balance of a smooth lager with some nice hop bite thrown in. Very nice carbonation and mouthfeel. Will revisit in the summer!"
"No bad. The only things holding this back were the slightly harsh finish and the overly prickly feel, which does get a bit distracting at times. Overall though, I found this to be mostly flavorful and enjoyable. You just have to let that carbonation settle down a bit in the mouth."
"d-Overall, not super impressed. Typical lager, but with a touch of something different, but not necessarily something much better from my perspective. This one seems pretty average or maybe a hairline above average, but only malt and missing something of quality. Bittery malty flavor which leaves something to be desired in my opinion. All-in-all I am really not a big fan of Lagers and ultimately I could not get through the full bottle and have to give up just because drinking it reminded me too much of my BMC days and it just made me nauseous...but that's the style. If you like BMC, this one is a real treat, but if you don't, expect a slightly better version of american adjunct lager."
"d- good, tasty beer here, i haven't had a pretty things beer that i've been disappointed with, this included. big fan of this brewery."
"D- Drinks quite well, and the EtOH is very well hidden in this one. I could enjoy several of these in any weather!"
"D- This stuff is really good. Its just too bad that my least favorite part is the taste. I really how no idea what this is. I think my final guess will be a tripel."
"Very drinkable beer. A little big for a lawnmover beer, unless you've cleared the rest of your afternoon for a nap. But still very nice."
"22oz bottle poured into an imperial pint glass. Color was a light amber with a thin white head. Aroma was malty and earthy grains. Taste was slighty sweet and fruity, but quickly transitioned to malts with a bit of hops. Very balanced and well rounded. Felt good in the mouth, well carbonated, slightly tingly in the mouth. Very drinkable, a very good summer beer."
"A very enjoyable beer. Not a great deal of complexity, but there really isn't supposed to be."
"Pours a hazy golden straw color with a big pillowy pure white head that slowly settles into a solid cap. The aroma is sweet from the pale malt, some honey notes and a bit of grain husk. Light hop detected. Very one dimensional. The taste has some honey notes as well. The sweetness is slightly balanced by a grassy hop bitterness. There seems to be an odd spice or herbal characteristic to this brew which doesn't really work well with the malt. Kind of has a funk flavor to it. The hop profile is not bad but the malt just doesn't work for me. The feel is of a moderate body with fizzy carbonation; starts sweet but finishes with a grassy hop bitterness. Really not a fan of this beer. The malt seems too doughy and sweet and the grassy hops don't help enough. Perhaps if more of a citrus hop was used it would be better."
"Dam fine lager...Easy drinking and refreshing...I cant wait to try this beer fresher...next summer!"
"Overall I was very surprised by the 7% ABV as it drinks much easier than that. Well worth a shot."
"22oz bomber. Bottled June 2010 Batch Two. $7.99 at Nikki's Liquor. Pours a slightly hazy yellow with a small head. Aroma is slightly sour with smells of cut grass and earthiness. This brew almost tastes like an American Adjunct Lager. An earthy taste with some slight malts. I have to say this is a bit disappointing. I've heard good things about this brewery but this beer is pretty average. The bottle has a picture of a lawnmower on it and this is certainly a mowing the grass beer but for 7.99 I could get a 6 pack of an as good, if not better mowing the grass beer."
"At 7% ABV, it's probably a bit too strong for a summer beer that you'd drink fast or for refreshment."
"D: Good. A light, refreshing, easy drinking beer. Not sure it is worth the trouble trying to track this one down, but overall a beer worth trying."
"D- Easy to drink and refreshing. Nothing really special here."
"M/D: Well carbonated, nice bubbles on the tongue. Probably inbetween light and medium bodied. A very nice lager. I didn't know til I came to review it that it was 7%. Very good beer."
"Overall for a lager its really flavorful and worth a try."
"Pours a four finger white head that fades quickly to a thin layer leaving some lace. Light-medium carbonation and medium bodied. Clear pale golden amber color. Nose is light hops. Flavor is mainly citric hops but some sweetness from the malts. Lingering bitter finish. $8.45 for a 22oz bottle from Colonial Spirits, Acton, MA. Bottled Jun 2010."
"This is one of the better summer lagers I had this year. Refreshing, flavorful, and crisp. Bullseye."
"Overall: This is an excellent lager. It's not your typical lager however at 7% abv. It's more like a mix between a lager,a pale ale and a saison. Lots of flavor and mouthfeel for such a light bodied beer. Pretty Things Beer and Ale Project are making some really good beers."
"American Darling is another solid beer from Pretty Things. With it, Pretty Things manages to take a light, crisp, style and make it bigger and bolder with completely destroying it."
"The beer pours a beautiful gold color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a nice pilsner malt scent along with a wonderful bouquet of German hops and a dry lager yeast aroma. It's bitter with a solid malt balance. The taste is great! It has a smooth, pilsner malt flavor, crisp and clean, with a killer hop bitterness and a dry finish. The hop character is outstanding. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a damn fine American lager. It's bold in it's bitterness, yet balanced enough to ensure extreme drinkability."
"This is interesting. There are elements of a run-of-the-mill APA (malt-hop balance, for example). There are also elements of some experimentation (the rich body for a pale lager and the higher alcohol content). Kudos for testing the waters."
"D- I like pretty things."
"D- very drinkable and enjoyable. Haven't had a bad beer from pretty things and this one does not disappoint. If ya have the chance check it out."
"Overall, a really nice and drinkable lager. Perfect type of beer for a hot summer day. Lots of flavor and balance and the sweet notes only get more prominent as the beer warms. Highly recommended."
"D: Drinkability falters a little on this one, an extremely flavorful lager with a 7% strength that had me sipping rather than gulping. A pretty fun beer to try and plenty well-made, just not quite to my liking enough that I'm itching for more yardwork to 'earn' another. What took it down for me was the tremendous bout of acid reflux I had after this beer finished...too bad."
"this is a great lager, nice and complex. i wish these were 12oz bottles and not a 22 though."
"Good time lager from Pretty Things. I'm always impressed with how this brewery continues to put out beers that are at the same time a great representation of the style, yet always a unique interpretation that pushes the boundaries a bit. This particular beer - the great American lager, but sturdy-ed up a bit and a nice nod to the lagers of Germany it seems. Like most lagers it's a pale yellowish straw color, showing a nice lively head, a good sign for the style. Lots of light doughy malts in the nose, something reminiscent of sweet cooked corn, and nice herbal hops, something of the Noble variety I'd guess. The hops are even a bit more out front at first sip, a subtle bitter finish. This is not necessarily a hoppy beer compared to others (IPA etc) but I do like the way the hops are a main characteristic of this lager. Along with a perfectly crisp malty goodness, this is perfectly balanced and a really delicious beer. Substantial on the palate yet uber drinkable and refreshing, even at 7%. I remember it was around last summer for literally about one week. Glad to see it's making a comeback and hopefully will be around a bit more, as this could easily be an all-the-time beer. I hope this beer inspires other US brewers to do some more artfully crafted lagers, because we need them here in 'Merica. Cheers to Pretty Things!"
"My first Pretty Things brew, and, as an extra, something of a surprise. It pours a clear golden straw topped by a finger or so of white foam. The nose comprises corn tortillas, wheat, and a very light strain of caramel. The taste is mostly composed of wheat and slightly chalky florals, along with a small contingent of light toffee. The body is rather light, with a light carbonation and a fairly crisp finish. Overall, a nice bit o' pale lagerishness, highly drinkable and good for those hot summer days (if you're into the seasonal thing)."
"VERY drinkable for a 7% brew. This is one summer brew that doesn't let me down...and most do. I was worried as it looked like a becks or st. pauli girl...but the taste is far better."
"D - not as drinkable as i would like this beer to be (seeing as there is a lawn mower on the label it should go down real smooth). The metallic aftertaste really slows it down."
"A great beer to introduce macro lovers to craft I think..."
"D-For 7% its quite drinkable. Best drinking lager i've had."
"Makes me think if the brewer pondered this question: ""what would a summer maibock taste like?"" 'Cause that's the impression American Darling gave me."
"The folks at Pretty Things like to put a Belgian twist on their American-style beers. American Darling however tasted like an American twist on a Belgian IPA. Needless to say, this is a phenomenal example of the style. Do not be fooled by the lawnmower on the bottle."
"Drinkability suffers a bit from the alcohol level."
"Beer is medium to light in body that is mildly sweet up front and finishes rather nice. There is a bitterness to it on the late palate that grows into an aftertaste. Its nice and for a relatively big pilsner its really well done."
"A really nice beer, very hoppy with big herbal notes and enough spiciness to make it pop in your mouth. Not something i could drink a lot of, but enjoyable."
"D: Although it's relatively strong for the style, any traces of alcohol are completely hidden from the taste. I would consider having this again on a summer day if I was looking for a pale lager with flavor or something to pair with food."
"very drinkable, the 7% abv is well hidden."
"Overall this is a good beer"
"D - Another unique and enjoyable offering from Pretty Things... Teetering in Pilsner territory... No trouble finishing here, but falls a bit short of recommending or seeking out again in the future..."
"D: Session."
"Pours clear and deep gold with a short white cap of fine and medium sized bubbles. Decent head retention, settling to a thick collar after a few minutes that left some spotty lacing on the glass. Mild aroma with notes of cereal grains, floral hops, and slight citrus. Solid bitterness, more than mild but still nicely balanced with a little bit of malt sweetness. Clean with a slight doughy and lemony finish. Light to medium bodied with average carbonation, nice texture but not very crisp. Faint alcohol warmth and tingle on the palate. Pretty tasty. I liked the light, lingering bitterness quite a bit."
"The taste is quite good. This is a well carbonated beer, it is medium bodied, it is creamy and smooth, and is more substantial than is typical for the style. There is a peppery bite in the finish, there is plenty of yeasty florals, herbal grass notes, some very tart lemon hints too. The beer is refreshing, has a higher than average ABV for the style, and is just a slightly more complex lager than what I'm used to. This is a good thing mind you. The peppery bit, slightly saltene flavor in the finish, with that tart lemon really defines this beer, along with its creamy medium body. It's worth seeking out."
"D - Super refreshing beer. One bomber just might not be enough! One pint definitely wasn't..."
"I would have liked this with a little lower ABV I think, but all in all, this is a great beer, and great representation of the style. One of the best!"
"D: Goes down very easily, nicely balanced, digging the spicier nature of this brew. Mild kick, nice take on the style, a highly enjoyable summer beverage. I've yet to be disappointed by Pretty Things!"
"Reminds me slightly of a saison. very drinkable and refreshing."
"Good summer quaff."
"Drinkability: An excellent summer sipper. Tastes very pilsner like. I could have several of these."
"Poured this into a tulip. Pours clear golden with about an inch of fluffy white head. Really nice sticky lacing. Not a bad smell here but not much complexity. Big malty nose with a hint of bitter hops. Smells like I would expect a pale lager to smell. Very inviting at the end of a hot week like this one. The taste is good a crisp. Grains and sweet malts start and this finishes with a subtle and bitter hop flavor. This is a great summer beer. Wonderful mouthfeel, nice carbonation and the perfectly light body makes this refreshing and easy to drink."
"The beer pours a radiant gold, with a 2 finger white head that has a little bit of staying power. The nose has a little bit of malt presence, but spicy and floral hops stand out more. The taste brings more of the same, but there's also a mineral quality to it that I think works with the beer. The body is great, light enough to ramp up the drinkability without being watery. If I had my way there'd just be a touch more carbonation, but that really is a minor quibble. They really hit the sweet spot with this beer, a ton of flavor in that bottle but still incredibly easy drinking. One of the better summer beers out there."
"D - While couln't give high marks on the other parts the drinkability is unbelievable it is what another reviewer said it is what a BMC product should be. The picture on the bottle is perfect as it is of a lawnmower."
"D - Attention, Pretty Things! Bottle this beer (at the very least) in 6 packs! Love this beer as a crisp summer time refreshment."
"Good pale color with decent carbonation and a very clean flavor and aroma. A little on the strong side for a lager but pretty balanced overall. I hope to see this again."
"A pint at Eastern Standard by Fenway Park. Golden and clear with very tiny carbonation bubbles. Lots of head and lace. Aroma was typical of a lager, a bit grainy with hints of hops. Clean front and middle of the palate taste with a mouthfeel slightly on the heavy (for the style) side. Bitterness comes out in the finish. Very, very refreshing."
"Drinkability: Perhaps it is the age, perhaps it is the style, but I just cannot get excited about this beer"
"D - Would drink this all day."
"Very drinkable and excellent for the style overall. This is more or less what BMC beers should aspire to in my opinion. Can't believe this is 7% ABV. I would have guessed 5%."
"Pours a very pale gold with plenty of carbonation. One might think it was a macro if not for the lovely pillowy white head. Good retention and downright messy lacing. Smell is of white bread malt and slightly spicy floral hops with a touch of honey. Taste is quite balanced. A white bread malt sweetness is equaled out with a nice bite from the hops. Plenty of herbal and floral hop flavor, with a bit of spice. With 7% ABV some of the alcohol works its way into the flavor. This beer was bottled in July of 2009, but it seems to have held up very well. Body is light to medium and the finish is perfect, not too dry and not too sweet. I have to say, if I was to throw a few of these back while mowing the lawn, I may end up with a few less toes. I will be on the lookout for a fresh example of this beer come summertime."
"American Darling isn't a great beer, but it is easy, and drinkable, and clean and good. I'd buy it."
"D: I'm not a lager guy and this one blew me away! So far I've loved everything I've had from this brewery. And this is no exception!"
"Taste is subjective. A good pale lager, but as slight & limited the flavor of this style is, a single bomber really isn't worth the price of 6-7 tallboys of Baltika(or whatever your preference is). Even a better choice, a competitively priced growler fill at 64 ounces a clip. Bad style choice for the pricey 22 format."
"Pours a crystal clear light gold color with a two finger cloudy white head with great retention leaving rings of lace down the glass. Little bubbles rise from the bottom throughout, a perfect looking beer. Earthy grass aromas blend with noble hops. Clean grain flavor, pale malt, mild lemon hop bitterness with virtually no aftertaste. This is a clean, crisp well balanced lager with good carbonation. Easy drinking, this would be a great selection for summer BBQs."
"Drinkability is stellar. clean and refreshing, with a hop note that's just a bit more prominent than is usual for the style. A bit cleaner and this is a 5, but with the perfect flavor going for it, I don't think they want to change a thing."
"Pours clear and golden with very little head. Little smell at all. The taste is awesome. All the crispness and drinkability of a light lager with some extra hop taste and a lot of punch. The hop taste sticks in the mouth a little longer than I'd like given the style, but it's one of th emore drinkable beers I've ever had."
"M/D - Here's where this beer really shines. This has a fantastic clean and easy drinking mouthfeel that I could easily see myself getting a keg of to share with friends. Shame that I can't get more of this locally."
"D- near perfect lawnmower beer. I would probably pick prima pils or a saison dupont over this, but I wouldn't turn this beer down if offered."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 3/4"" bright white head over the clear pale yellow brew. Head falls at a moderate pace, eventually settling at an uneven but frothy in areas cap, with average to good lacing. Aroma is pale sweetness, with a light floral hoppiness. Taste is pale malt with lemon twinges, with crisp hoppiness coming on towards the close, and a slightly earthy aftertaste. Mouthfeel is prickly like you would except from a pale lager, with good drinkability. Good representation of the style."
"Get yourself some while it's still hot out."
"My first beer from PT and I was very impressed. This is a great summer beer. If you have a few of these I'm afraid you may do some irreplaceable harm to your lawn."
"Had a few of these up in the 1000 Islands in Ontario. Pours a golden color with a decent head. Smell is very pleasing with a fruity, malty twang. The flavor is excellent. I normally do not like lagers, but this has expectional taste. Perfect for a humid evening. Drinkability is excellent, but beware abv is 7% so you could be out of control quickly (Might be a good thing). Pretty Things is producing some great beer. Highly recommended!"
"Bright, crisp and clear golden color with a steady stream of bubble of carbonation supporting a large, frothy off white head that leaves spots of lacing. Amazing aroma for the style, malt, slight ripe fruit, faint hops, and lemon grass. Fairly typical pale lager taste but actually rather flavorful. Slightly grainy, crisp malt background with a stronger fruit (sweeter than the aroma) balance and a strong hop kick in the finish resulting in a very clean, dry aftertaste. Body is light and refreshing with a fair amount of carbonation. Very flavorful and enjoyable, realistically a pale lager isn't exactly the most exciting style but for this quality not too hard to justify the price versus a 12 pack of whatever."
"D: Tasty, goes down pretty easily, not too filling, good kick, good representation of style, this is a solid and refreshing ""lawnmower beer"" that is worth pounding down for a long period of time."
"Mouthfeel is light bodied and crisp, making it nice and drinkable."
"For the style it's quite good. Maybe not earth-shattering but extremely solid and well-constructed."
"Notes: A nice pale lager for sure. As others have said one of the better American lagers and a nice alternative to import lagers. Has a personality independent from just a basic lager."
"D: Too strong to session but this is one of the better non german lagers that I have had. Their beers do not blow your mind but they are always good."
"22oz. bomber - Bottled July 2009, First Batch indicated on a paper swatch covering the cap. Served in a pilsener glass. Poured a translucent straw-gold with a two inch bright white cap with copious amounts of tiny bubbles effervescing from the base of the glass to the underside of the cap. Head eventually settles into a solid quarter inch cap - some spots of lacing present during the tasting. Nose is mild - just getting cereals grains and a light citrus character on this one. Taste follows nose; however, citrus really comes out in the front and leaves a residual lemony astringency at the finish. Mouthfeel is light-bodied and effervescent with some astringency lingering between quaffs. Easy drinking. Not my favorite style, but fairly tasty."
"My first reaction to this beer was similar to the other PT offerings I've tried: not bad, but not really so great as the stuff I've read about it. For a summer lager, it's got a rather high ABV; if you drink a bottle after you mow the lawn (as illustrated on the label), you'll probably be buzzed enough to be dangerous with the mower. That's a mark against it. However, the aroma is nice-- lemons and honey, grass and a bright tinge to it that reminded me of a Weihenstephan premium. The beer has a bubbly texture and a hoppy tang that hits nicely on a hot day, with more lemon and just a bit of malt. Overall, it's nicely subdued. Quite decent. If PT would lower the ABV, this would be nearly great."
"A difficult style of Beer to brew well, great stuff."
"Drinkability - Excellent. The flavors that linger on the tongue after each sip beckon for the next drink. Can not believe this beer is 7%. Wish it came in a sixer, but the $5 bomber is hardly a bank breaker."
"PS - this beer was in commemoration of mowing my OWN lawn for the very first time today."
"D- High, but watch out for the 7% ABV. Goes down pretty smooth."
"Final thoughts: another great one from pretty things, the hops are surprising for being a lager but very drinkable, especially for summer. They have been right on with every beer they make."
"D - This is probably one of the best summertime lagers I've yet come across. Wonderfully crisp and refreshing. Not too light-bodied and watery, as it seems many summer-drinking lagers come across. I'm surprised a bit at the 7% ABV - the alcohol remains well-hidden behind the sturdy malt and hop profiles. Very well done, Dann."
"Pours a nice clear yellow with a bubbly head. Nice touch of hops in the aroma, sweet on the nose. The flavor is outstanding, just enough body to give it some substance and a slight hop in the aftertaste. Just enough. This is just a really well balanced lager. Very drinkable. Definitely my favorite of the Pretty Things. It's really nice to see new beers keep pouring in. Keep em comin!"
"I wish it came in 6 packs, and I could drink this all day. This could be a kegerator staple (if I had the option), and extremely approachable for craft noobs."
"This is the newest release from one of my favorite new local breweries: Pretty Things. It looks as if this is their interpretation of a Summer lager. Pours a nice clear gold, with a large amount of white heading (which stays). Grainy start to the smell, followed by some biscuit, bread crust, and perhaps a touch of fruit. The Hallertau hops are the first thing I think of when sipping this beer, and they stay for the whole ride. The depth of malt complexity is very deep despite the big hoppy flavors. The tastes make me think of being outside; Very earth like and floral. Mouthfeel is crisp and refreshing, and despite being a slightly bigger lager, the alcohol is well hidden. Drinkability is top notch, and would make for a perfect Summer barbecue beer. This is another home run for Pretty Things (maybe my favorite next to Jack D'or). We need more great lagers like this that bring the good when it comes to the style."
