Clean, light caramel malts step forward in the flavor with a subtle hop balance. The beer is on the sweet side, but is by no means thick. It's a tasty golden, malty lager—a type of beer that's hard to come by and New Glarus does an excellent job.","tempest","Jun 17, 2014"

But I feel his skill as a brewer is just about all Totally Naked has going for it because there's little about this beer that's otherwise interesting. As they say, ""this is beer at its most basic"" - completely free of any sort of flaw but also lacking much of any reason to drink it, I feel. Just a vehicle for introducing alcohol to the blood stream, Totally Naked, along side Spotted Cow are two perfect beers to draw the ""big beer"" drinkers into craft.","BeerFMAndy","Jun 10, 2014"

Nice easy drinking lager with a pleasant taste. Mouthfeel is light and well carbonated.

The nose didn't invite further investigation, but to respect the style I went for it anyway, despite that I new the hops would be hard to find. Taste is beer, just as it was billed...totally naked, up front, refreshing, and not at all complex. That's it. Mouthfeel was smooth, light and a bit dry. Overall a fine, straight up approach to brewing, but really not what I'm looking in a craft beer...even in light of my strong respect of NG beers. Goes fast! I'd buy something other than this when turning to NG. (And it still deserves respect...and should be noted that my mum-in-law, who isn't a regular beer drinker, really did appreciate the approach...so for someone with a bit of fear of the bitter bombs out there, this one might just be grand).","Bitter_Echo","Aug 19, 2012"

At first there seems to be a bit of off notes, but it sort of dissipates. Now I notice some grassy hop notes and a very light mildly bready aroma. Taste is very very light crisp and refreshing. Mildly bready as well, grassy, floral, earthy hop notes, but all very light and subtle. Mouthfeel is exactly where it should be. Light and refreshing with a moderate amount of carbonation.

This beer is an example of the motto ""less is more"" done correctly. It does not have that weird off-smell that BMC has, rather it gives the impression of clean freshness with every sip. It keeps the basics, um, well... Naked! , and doesn't mess with the fundamental nature. The hops are just light enough to be used as flavor accents without contributing excessive bitterness to the brew. Can easily be used as a thirst-quencher on a hot summer day.

Besides that, it's well-made, and really, not a bad beer at all, it's just simplistic. It's got a good malt flavor to it with a slightly honeyish edge, and some very nice lemony, grassy, and floral hops. And it's balanced, albeit it a little towards the sweet side. Sure it could have a little more hops in the aroma, but it is what it is; my only complaint is that the head retention and lacing should be better (and they could be, that all goes to brewing practice).

I understand the concept, a summer thirst quencher that you keep ice cold and guzzle on a hot day. It does work for that purpose, but so does miller lite.

Bit of a generic beery smell, some slight bready aromas, and lemon. Taste really impressed me....super-clean and crisp, a lemony zing, gentle grass hop taste, and a slight lingering sweetness.

Light fluffy body with a smooth feel and subtle carbonation. Very enjoyable beer for the season. Luckily I have one bottle left, but I know it won't last long.

Freshly squeeze lemon juice over crisp, clean apple slices. Beautiful. Pours a sweet golden, with a fuming core and a silky white soap of head. Flavor holds a standard, lightly tart malt, with edges of aged lemon rind and weak sugar syrup. A nip of sweet corn slides in. Thin grain sugars dominate the palate, leaving it a little undesirable with some DMS. However, finishes mostly clean, save for some almonds, before smacking with the faintest hint of distant hop leaves. Acceptable, nothing to write home about.","CharlesDarwin","Jul 21, 2007"
