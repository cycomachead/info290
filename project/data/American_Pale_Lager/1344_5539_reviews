"Billed as a Helles lager, it lacks the malt sweetness found in some of the better versions of the style.  When speaking with Cricket Hill Founder, Rick Reed, he mentioned the East Coast Lager is pretty much all he drinks at the brewery.  It is easy drinking and crisp, so I can see why."

"Always the first thing to start with for the beginner at Cricket Hill. Better than any Budweiser, Miller Light, or Coors you will ever have"

"10/26...pours clear light gold, mostly see through. Wisps of foam, little else. Mild straw, bread, grassy smell. Light taste, small hop bite. A touch chewy. Smooth flavorful lager. When compared to the style, real good."

"Overall, what we liked best about this beer was its simplicity, and its nice, crisp drinkability. This guy is a surprisingly invigorating hybrid of craft and macro, and we can see how aspects of this would be appealing to both crowds of drinkers. There has actually been a big push for this kind of thing lately, at least in Michigan where we are currently holed up, with breweries like Shorts. It is actually an interesting, almost full-circle transition we are witnessing before our eyes. This is the kind of beer that, if produced and labeled by a BMC, would be considered subpar, but since its coming from the smalltime, and with perhaps a more interesting or robust use of hops, or some random ingredient, we enjoy it with much less conviction. Observational diatribe over. Despite the enhancing bitterness of this beer with warmth, and its dimming appeal, it goes down smoothly enough and can be enjoyed."

"O: While this beer is easy to drink, it comes across as being rather bland in both the smell and taste."
""

""

"O: Very easy to drink and sessionable but not one of the more interesting beers that I have tried in my experiences in drinking craft beers - there are good flavors and aromas but the beer is rather bland overall."

"Pours a straw yellow with a high white head. Smell is your standard biscuit and herbs, with some minerals for good measure. It's malty and clean up front, mildly bitter with a touch of sulfur in the finish. Clean and crisp in the mouth. All in all a nice local lager, better than most other such options I can find in a bottle - will probably get it again."

"Lightly toasted grainy bread up front. Spicy, herbal, noble hop flavor and bitterness soon follows. Sweetish honey and cereal malts mid-palate. Dry finish with lingering noble bitterness and honey. Moderate body with some prickly carbonation. Not bad."

"Whatchy'all know 'bout tha ECL!? ... This stuff pours a clear golden straw topped by a finger or so of white foam. The nose comprises white bread, sweet bread (think cornbread without the corn...), grass, and a touch of greens. The taste brings in more of the same, with an overarching sense of mildness pervading everything. That may sound outwardly negative, but it actually works for this beer. Trust me. The body is a hefty light, with a light moderate carbonation and a wet feel. Overall, a nice little beer, nothing too major in any category, but an easy-drinker all the way."

"Very well blended flavors that go together well. Malt body backs up the hop presence well for a great balance. Very nice."
"12 oz bottle. Pours golden with a thick white head, a lot of lacing and carbonation. Aroma is of pale malt and grassy hops. Medium, crisp body. A good amount of herbal hops is balanced by biscuit malt on the palate. Finish is long, clean and hoppy. I did not expect much from this brew, but I actually enjoyed it."

"O: 0 for 2 for Cricket Hill and not sure they're going to have another crack."
""

"Overall: A nice if not slightly above average beer. There is big time hops in the middle for hop heads. I would probably get this again if I were more of a hop head, but this in my mind is just above average for the style."
"O: Pretty average lager, not bad, not great. Some more carbonation would help make it a bit more crisp and refreshing."
"Pale straw colored with a fizzy white head that shrinks to a skim. Raw grain and floral, herbal hops. Light for sure but flavorful and tasty with plenty of earthy hop flavor and a lean malt backbone. Irony, mineraly flavors are present. Light bodied with seltzery carbonation. A really good and tasty example of the style."
"Some assertive hop flavors in the second half of this sip make this worthwhile. The bitterness is brief but refreshing and shows some zest and vitality missing in a lot of American lagers. Biscuit themed malts and a mellow finish are nothing out of the ordinary, but the overall package is neat and faithful to the style. This is reasonably satisfying and I would drink this again."
"This was shared with a couple BAs at work. It poured a very BMC esque bright and clear gold with no head. It smelled of pale malt and tortilla chips. The flavor was solely of tortilla chips, minus the salt. It had literally nothing else at all going on. It was so grainy it was ridiculous. It drank light and smooth as it should have. It left that annoying grainy, corn tortilla flavor behind. And this beer has a 97 rating on ratebeer? How?!? Overall this is awful and is a definite avoid!"
"Enjoyed 4 of these on a long round of disc golf, broke the other one as it smashed to the ground outside the elevator of my apartment (beer in pockets + moving in = regrettable and unfortunate decision-making). It is a very pleasant outdoors beer for a warm spring day."
"Overall: It's drinkable, it's decent, easy on the flavor, but goes down easy, too."
"I don't know what has been going on with Cricket Hills' beers in bottles lately but they have been falling short on taste. I remember better tasting beers in the past. When I visited the brewery, not too long ago, the beers didn't taste this bland. I don't know if it's the Stores I am buying from; if they're keeping them longer than they should, they're no expiration dates on the bottles."
"Overall not bad, I am not the biggest fan of the style, but I have to admit this was much better then most. It at least had a slight variation and some flavor to it. An easy choice for a party or beach day. I don't know if I would purchase again, but if I saw it around I would have no issue in having one."
"Just a bit hoppy for the first few sips. Then it starts to pick up and a six pack later, its smooth. Pouring it in a frosty mug seems to help the drinkability of this beer. I have been to the brewery and even volunteered there. Their IPA is very good and strong."
"Sure, its a nice bottle, got a cricket on it, says east coast lager, I live on the east coast! I like lager! I must like this. This was more of a Pale Ale. I like Lager, don't get me wrong, but this beer was all hops, with a nice little bready hoppy citrus match up, which really doesn't sound much like a lager to me."
"M/D - medium body, easy to drink. Nothing fancy, decent local lager."
"D: A little tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, mild kick, decent representation of style, this is a decent lighter beer that is worth drinking for a while."
"I'd drink it again if the no other selection was calling out to me. It's a known quantity, therefore it would be ok for drinking in the future"
"Pours yellow gold with a pure white head. It smells clean and smooth, with a hint of malt. Not a very strong odor. The taste is smooth and easy. A great drinking lager. Goes down smooth, with a little hint of bitterness at the end. A really good summer drinking beer."
"Drinkable. Not the best lager I've had nor the worst."
"Drinkability: Had no trouble drinking it, but given an options I would select another beer."
"feels wonderful on the tongue and drinks like a champ. it's like a schaefer with micro quality. very tasty beer to throw back on a summer day or anytime for that matter"
"D: At 4% ABV, this is a good candidate lawnmower beer. It hit the spot today, on the first warmish day we've had this year."
"Pours slightly hazy orange-golden with a slight, bubbly head. The aroma is sharp, pale malt with a bitter orange background. The flavor is malty, a bit toasted, with a spritzy bitter orange hop character and a pointed bitterness down the tongue. The mouthfeel is tingly and light. There is a faintly syrupy edge to the mouthfeel that is not entirely welcome."
"Overall - Not too bad"
"East Coast Lager is a 4.0% American pale lager with hopitude, something that isn't very common in the world of craft beer. It goes without saying, but I'll say it anyway.... this stuff is orders of magnitude better than anything of this style churned out by BMC."
"D: Using my rubric that a C represents an average for the style, this is slightly below average... Though not bad by any means."
"Not a very impressive beer but i was looking for something light in the fridge. Very light in color, not great carbonation, overall a pretty average beer."
"D: Drinks pretty decent but there are plenty of better and more interesting American Lagers out there."
"This beer is good. Better than say, Victory Lager, which I didn't care for."
"Overall, bland and uninteresting, but at least no off-flavors and decently drinkable when cold."
"Relatively light bodied, crisp and refreshing beer that finishes crisp while it's cold, but became tiny bit winy at the finish as it warmed up."
"jwc215 sent this one! It pours a light orange color with a healthy white head, leaving lacing all the way down. Smells of yeast, and tastes mildy of malt with a biscuity flavor too. Carbonation is just about right, very drinkable. Overall, a pretty decent lager, but leans a bit too much in the yeasty direction."
"poured had a nice head ..off white.. a yellowish color to the beer and good amount of carbination.. sweet smells to the nose .. when first tasted had a funk taste to it.. then i got used to it.. good but like any pale larger.. i like it.. drinkablity is high.. even on a hot day.. cheers"
"Notes from: 9/19/04 - Note to self, seek this one out again to see if it is any different."
"an ok beer I could mow the lawn with, but nothing to go out of your way for."
"Pours light yellow, some hops on the nose. No real lacing to speak of. Taste is mildly hoppy, smooth, light, easy to drink. Some malt. Not too much presence, but enjoyable. Adequate carbonation. This is a good local beer."
"Bottom line: This is a nice Lager; Tasty, good mouthfeel, and quite drinkable. I'm very happy that I got a chance to try it as it is a well brewed product, imho. I'd drink it again. No problem."
"Drinks easy, nothing mid-blowing here, but worthy of sixer while BBQing or watching the game"
"D: Again, hard to rate higher than the sum of the parts here, but seriously, it's unique and interesting for a lager (addition of the Simcoe). One of the more interesting, unique lagers I've had."
"if i had a kid i would bring these to its <insert sport here> game and sit my lawn chair outside the fence so some school official didn't bother me while i drank them and jeered the other kids for being so much less talented than mine and the coach for not fully recognizing the sheer athletic prowess of my spawn, then id go home and drink more while i berated my kid for ruining my second chance at living through them with their obvious lack of hustle and focus"
"Pours a slight hazy golden color, nice carbonation, nice little foamy white head, which leaves some sticky lacing behind. The nose is malty, slight hops, grassy, and caramel. The taste is malty, slight hoppy, some grassy, and caramel. Light-Medium body. Drinkable, not too bad."
"drinkability - I never saw this brand before, and thought I would try it. Wasn't anything great. Was ok, wouldn't buy it again. Seemed like macro lager that I was drinking."
"This is better than your average lawnmower beer. Perhaps the smell was only off on this bottle; the flavoring was made up for it."
"A great pale lager that's relatively full-flavored and well-balanced. The malts are clean and biscuity while the hops are crisp with floral and citrus flavors. The malt is a touch grainy, but not in a bad way. Rather it just adds to the flavor. I found this to be a great pairing with an opening course at dinner or as a stand alone appetizer. Worth trying if you're into lagers."
"Another on-premise sample from Wine and Beverage Depot in Totowa... props to the guys for the tastings... Copper-colored with not too much going by ways of appearance... grain, corn, slight hops aroma... bread and butter taste, very light, easy-going, session-drinkable beer... not too heavy on flavor, but about average taste... crisp, refreshing... good for a hot summer day... All in all, not exciting or wonderfully appealing, but a good beer to kick back with some friends... a sociable brew but don't look for much in terms of flavor or character..."
"Overall- The flavor very comes out further into the beer. A nice clean, easy to drink lager. A good beer to have on an afternoon or anyother time, I will buy it again. Red White And Brew in Mount Holly NJ carries Cricket Hill and Stacey (the owner) referred me to the beer and I LOVE IT"
"Not bad, support local beers!"
"Overall- The flavor very comes out further into the beer. A nice clean, easy to drink lager. A good beer to have on an afternoon sail."
"This beer pours a grassy, yellow body with a small, white head. The retention is prettt fast, but the remaining lacing is pretty good. The smell was very malty and sweet. The taste was not as malty as the smell and it tasted a little sweet, like a pilsner. The mouthfeel could have been a bit thicker; it felt fairly thin. Overall, this is an easy going beer and very drinkable. A little like a Czech pils, but not as sweet and definitely not as thick. Its light and refreshing characteristics makes it a good beer to drink."
"Fresh bottle. Pale yellow with initial white fizzy head. Gazzy overcarbonated, with metallic in aftertaste. The lagerish taste is overwhelmed by the process, much like a macro. Not much taste here, a tad hops and more malt. Not finishable, but perhaps meat tenderizer."
"Would be easy to drink, but I don't know if the floral notes in a lager, esp. this one, does it for me. Not much going on here, besides."
"Very nice, easy drinking, hopped up lager."
"Very pale, straw color-carbonation level looks a bit low. Low aroma-somewhat crisp and clean smelling. Malty flavor with a decent balance of hop bitterness. Nice crisp flavor. Reminds me of a decent Eur pils. Good balance between the two. Body could use a kick in the pants. Overall very drinkable and enjoyable. have wanted to try this brewery for a while since it is close to where I am from. Good effort."
"A nice refreshing lager; has a lot of flavor similarities to some good American Bitter Ales with a lighter lager body. This makes it very drinkable, it was gone before I knew it."
"Cheers!"
"This beer is like a clutch hitter. The appearance, smell, and finish were nothing to get excited about, but there beer actually tasted pretty damn good. Cricket Hill Lager poured cloudy with a head thinner than Nicole Richie (ouch, zinger). The nose was nearly non-existen, with the exception of a faint apricot. As I tasted the beer, I got an initial hop bite that I wasn't expecting, then the palate launched into peach, apricot, and papaya. It finished a tad syrupy, with a slightly cloying fruityness that lingered."
"Poured a golden, translucent color with plenty of carbonation and a thick, white colored head that remained intact for minutes. Aromas of hops, malt, along with floral accents. The taste was very light and flowery with a bit of hop bitterness to match the sweet malt. The carbonation added texture to this thin, soft brew. Somewhat refreshing, but not complex or overly flavorful at all. I enjoyed this beer with some nachos and the two worked well together. A decent beer with a soft character that allows it to be enjoyed more than once."
"Like other Cricket Hill Brews, there's nothing overly spectacular about this lager, but it hits the spot in a solid way. Looks like it should, nice golden slightly orangey color. Smells perfumey, with some grassy hoppyness going on. Tastes fruitier than expected, with more grassy hops and sweet malts going throughout. Mouthfeel was fabulous, just lovely. Very drinkable, another hot day thirst quencher. I'd keep a few in my fridge."
"The beer pours a brilliantly clear, straw-gold color that sits beneath a frothy pale cream colored head that is an ample 2.5 fingers thick in my small tulip glass. The aroma is fairly clean with some spicy herbal notes, a bit of lemon and a clean, sweet grainy maltiness. For a pale lager the aroma is pretty nice, makes it seem refreshing and inviting to drink on a warm summer afternoon. The beer is quite crisp, with an astringent herbal hoppiness that moves to a nice bitterness as the beer passes through my mouth. This beer is quite refreshing; this would be nice on a hot summers day. It is certainly a big step up from your standard BMC; I really like the spicy, lemon tinted, herbal hop notes in this beer. The key to this beer is to drink it pretty cold, I cant see this tasting nearly as well if I allowed it to warm up to even ale temperatures, as is it is a good rendition of the style."
"Beer is good. Happy beering."
"Drinkability: Just didnt enjoy this one. No its not awful, but there are far better ones out there. The finish and mouthfeel ruined it for me."
"Big foamy head goes down slowly. Clear pale yellow beer. 12 oz. bottle with a picture of a cricket. No freshness dating found. Aromas detected were malty with a hint of hops and skunk. Taste was malty, with slight spice, possible hint of corn. Lightly bitter finish with a strange aftertaste of raw hops. Mouthfeel is light and watery. Sure you could drink a lot of this beer, but why would you. An average offering in my opinion."
"This one is very basic and has no real flaws, but isn't really enticing at all either. It'd be a nice brew to begin converting macro drinkers, I think. Aside from maybe stocking up on this for a party to do just that, I don't really think I'll be drinking much of this brew anytime soon."
"Our minds drift discovering all the flavors involved feeling a beer that speaks our language when we say Lager"
"Honestly, it's so light and unassuming there's really nothing to distinguish it from the masses of continental euro-lagers congesting the shelves. Perhaps a little maltier, with a more pronounced apple flavor, but I honestly feel like I'm flailing for some kind of flavor. There's really nothing there. I'd rather drink this because it's domestic, but I'd prefer their american ale. Nothing I'd buy again unless faced with a poor selection."
"Pours and looks like a macro. Except this has no head and is a bit cloudy. No lacing and almost no carbonation. Well, this experience has started off poorly, I must say. The aroma is faint with lemony grains with a touch of honey malt. The flavors come together nicely after the first few sips. Theres a decent maltiness along with a pleasant hop bitterness. Clean drinking and enjoyable. The beer goes down smoothly and finishes clean. This beer did an about face from just moments ago. Not bad."
"This beer was a light yellow, like very weak tea. There wasn't much aroma, maybe a little malt if you tried real hard. The taste was kind of a sour malt with a small amount of herbs. The second part was so light it was hard to pick anything out. It's texture was watery. This one was not so unpleasant I couldn't drink it to be polite, but I had to work to finish the pint."
"p.s.- slightly unrelated, but it says ""Jersey shore pour"" on the bottle. I found this strange being that Fairfield NJ is no where near the shore. In fact, its at least an hour and change away from the closest beach. Hmmm."
"Pours a very clear and lightly golden with a very thin lace. The aroma is thin and watery with barely a hint of hop addition or malt for that matter. The first taste is sharp and clean with a mild malt character and a very mild bitterness. This is a very light brew, but also quite refreshing on a warm summer day. Possesses just a bit of fruity zest through the finish. The body is smooth and makes for an overall very easy drinking concoction."
"A yellow-gold body is capped by a decent-sized head of creamy bright-white foam. The retention is good and it keeps a thin surface covering throughout the glass, leaving very nice lace as it goes! The aroma is fresh and inviting with floral hops entwined in bright, grainy malt. The body is medium and it's crisp-then-creamy in the mouth due to a very fine carbonation. The floral hops promised in the aroma are delivered in both flavor and firm bitterness that's equally balanced by semi-rich grainy malt. It finishes short and dry with a lingering note of floral/grassy hops. Very nice! Much more of a European lager than I expected, with a respectable amount of hops and a solid maltiness. Kudos!"
"Pours a slightly dark golden color with a thick, dense, blanket like head. Respectable lace. Excessive carbonation is notable in the appearance and the mouthfeel. Grassy, lighly malty flavors. Noble hop aroma and charachter thoughout. A very tasty and drinkable beer."
"Pours a golden color the supports a nice, medium head. Laces well. Nose of malt and hops and grassy tones. Great hop and malt flavor. Nice body and hop bitterness gives this one its character. Finishes crisp and clean."
"pours golden with the same citrus aroma as out of the bottle. i found this on tap not to have as much flavor. then again, it was the first out of the keg. it did get better as i went through it. nothing is lost as far as the crisp brew that follows. a unique lager that is great to drink."
"This beer poured a beautiful golden yellow with a slight orange tint. It smells a little of citrus and hops, but the main scent is that of malt. This was a great tasting beer, with plesant bitterness, fair body, and appropriate carbonation. The dominant taste was grains, but there was a little malt dept as well. The bitterness was responsible for a pretty dry finish for this one as well as a grassy taste in on the back of the roof of the mouth.."
"One more thing. It says in small letters on the bottle, and in very large letters on the case, ONLY AVAILABLE FOR SALE IN NEW JERSEY. Hellllll yesssssssssssssssssss"
