3.67,10.5,4,3.75,3.5,3.75,3.75,"Overall, what we liked best about this beer was its simplicity, and its nice, crisp drinkability. This guy is a surprisingly invigorating hybrid of craft and macro, and we can see how aspects of this would be appealing to both crowds of drinkers. There has actually been a big push for this kind of thing lately, at least in Michigan where we are currently holed up, with breweries like Shorts. It is actually an interesting, almost full-circle transition we are witnessing before our eyes. This is the kind of beer that, if produced and labeled by a BMC, would be considered subpar, but since its coming from the smalltime, and with perhaps a more interesting or robust use of hops, or some random ingredient, we enjoy it with much less conviction. Observational diatribe over. Despite the enhancing bitterness of this beer with warmth, and its dimming appeal, it goes down smoothly enough and can be enjoyed.","TheBrewo","Oct 21, 2013"

The taste was not as malty as the smell and it tasted a little sweet, like a pilsner. The mouthfeel could have been a bit thicker; it felt fairly thin. Overall, this is an easy going beer and very drinkable. A little like a Czech pils, but not as sweet and definitely not as thick. Its light and refreshing characteristics makes it a good beer to drink.","maddogruss","May 08, 2007"
2.6,-21.7,3,3,2.5,2,2.5,"Fresh bottle. Pale yellow with initial white fizzy head. Gazzy overcarbonated, with metallic in aftertaste. The lagerish taste is overwhelmed by the process, much like a macro. Not much taste here, a tad hops and more malt. Not finishable, but perhaps meat tenderizer.","Sammy","Apr 19, 2007"
3.03,-8.7,3.5,3,3,3,3,"Would be easy to drink, but I don't know if the floral notes in a lager, esp. this one, does it for me. Not much going on here, besides.","jwc215","Feb 17, 2007"

3.3,-0.6,3,3,3.5,3,3.5,"Very pale, straw color-carbonation level looks a bit low. Low aroma-somewhat crisp and clean smelling. Malty flavor with a decent balance of hop bitterness. Nice crisp flavor. Reminds me of a decent Eur pils. Good balance between the two. Body could use a kick in the pants. Overall very drinkable and enjoyable. have wanted to try this brewery for a while since it is close to where I am from. Good effort.","lackenhauser","0"
3.95,19,3.5,3.5,4,4,4.5,"A nice refreshing lager; has a lot of flavor similarities to some good American Bitter Ales with a lighter lager body. This makes it very drinkable, it was gone before I knew it.","Cadyfatcat","Aug 08, 2006"

3.22,-3,2,2.5,4,3,3,"This beer is like a clutch hitter. The appearance, smell, and finish were nothing to get excited about, but there beer actually tasted pretty damn good. Cricket Hill Lager poured cloudy with a head thinner than Nicole Richie (ouch, zinger). The nose was nearly non-existen, with the exception of a faint apricot. As I tasted the beer, I got an initial hop bite that I wasn't expecting, then the palate launched into peach, apricot, and papaya. It finished a tad syrupy, with a slightly cloying fruityness that lingered.","dherling","Jan 24, 2006"
3.26,-1.8,4,3,3.5,3,3,"Poured a golden, translucent color with plenty of carbonation and a thick, white colored head that remained intact for minutes. Aromas of hops, malt, along with floral accents. The taste was very light and flowery with a bit of hop bitterness to match the sweet malt. The carbonation added texture to this thin, soft brew. Somewhat refreshing, but not complex or overly flavorful at all. I enjoyed this beer with some nachos and the two worked well together. A decent beer with a soft character that allows it to be enjoyed more than once.","jaluria","Oct 23, 2005"
3.73,12.3,4,3.5,3.5,4.5,4,"Like other Cricket Hill Brews, there's nothing overly spectacular about this lager, but it hits the spot in a solid way. Looks like it should, nice golden slightly orangey color. Smells perfumey, with some grassy hoppyness going on. Tastes fruitier than expected, with more grassy hops and sweet malts going throughout. Mouthfeel was fabulous, just lovely. Very drinkable, another hot day thirst quencher. I'd keep a few in my fridge.","scooter231","Jul 17, 2005"
3.48,4.8,4,3.5,3.5,4,3,"The beer pours a brilliantly clear, straw-gold color that sits beneath a frothy pale cream colored head that is an ample 2.5 fingers thick in my small tulip glass. The aroma is fairly clean with some spicy herbal notes, a bit of lemon and a clean, sweet grainy maltiness. For a pale lager the aroma is pretty nice, makes it seem refreshing and inviting to drink on a warm summer afternoon. The beer is quite crisp, with an astringent herbal hoppiness that moves to a nice bitterness as the beer passes through my mouth. This beer is quite refreshing; this would be nice on a hot summers day. It is certainly a big step up from your standard BMC; I really like the spicy, lemon tinted, herbal hop notes in this beer. The key to this beer is to drink it pretty cold, I cant see this tasting nearly as well if I allowed it to warm up to even ale temperatures, as is it is a good rendition of the style.","Gueuzedude","Jul 13, 2005"

2.73,-17.8,3,2.5,3,2.5,2.5,"Big foamy head goes down slowly. Clear pale yellow beer. 12 oz. bottle with a picture of a cricket. No freshness dating found. Aromas detected were malty with a hint of hops and skunk. Taste was malty, with slight spice, possible hint of corn. Lightly bitter finish with a strange aftertaste of raw hops. Mouthfeel is light and watery. Sure you could drink a lot of this beer, but why would you. An average offering in my opinion.","tomthumbsblues","Mar 18, 2005"
3.32,0,3,3.5,3.5,3,3,"This one is very basic and has no real flaws, but isn't really enticing at all either. It'd be a nice brew to begin converting macro drinkers, I think.

2.78,-16.3,3.5,3,2.5,3.5,2.5,"Honestly, it's so light and unassuming there's really nothing to distinguish it from the masses of continental euro-lagers congesting the shelves. Perhaps a little maltier, with a more pronounced apple flavor, but I honestly feel like I'm flailing for some kind of flavor. There's really nothing there. I'd rather drink this because it's domestic, but I'd prefer their american ale. Nothing I'd buy again unless faced with a poor selection.","UnionMade","Sep 25, 2004"
3.64,9.6,2,3,4,4,4,"Pours and looks like a macro. Except this has no head and is a bit cloudy. No lacing and almost no carbonation. Well, this experience has started off poorly, I must say. The aroma is faint with lemony grains with a touch of honey malt. The flavors come together nicely after the first few sips. Theres a decent maltiness along with a pleasant hop bitterness. Clean drinking and enjoyable. The beer goes down smoothly and finishes clean. This beer did an about face from just moments ago. Not bad.","pezoids","Jan 23, 2004"
2.02,-39.2,2,2.5,2,2,1.5,"This beer was a light yellow, like very weak tea. There wasn't much aroma, maybe a little malt if you tried real hard. The taste was kind of a sour malt with a small amount of herbs. The second part was so light it was hard to pick anything out. It's texture was watery. This one was not so unpleasant I couldn't drink it to be polite, but I had to work to finish the pint.","claytri","Aug 31, 2003"
3.43,3.3,3.5,3,3.5,3,4,"p.s.- slightly unrelated, but it says ""Jersey shore pour"" on the bottle. I found this strange being that Fairfield NJ is no where near the shore. In fact, its at least an hour and change away from the closest beach. Hmmm.","Ieatlambfries","Jun 05, 2003"
3.83,15.4,3.5,3,4,4,4.5,"Pours a very clear and lightly golden with a very thin lace. The aroma is thin and watery with barely a hint of hop addition or malt for that matter. The first taste is sharp and clean with a mild malt character and a very mild bitterness. This is a very light brew, but also quite refreshing on a warm summer day. Possesses just a bit of fruity zest through the finish. The body is smooth and makes for an overall very easy drinking concoction.","beernut7","Feb 09, 2003"
3.98,19.9,4,3.5,4,4,4.5,"A yellow-gold body is capped by a decent-sized head of creamy bright-white foam. The retention is good and it keeps a thin surface covering throughout the glass, leaving very nice lace as it goes! The aroma is fresh and inviting with floral hops entwined in bright, grainy malt. The body is medium and it's crisp-then-creamy in the mouth due to a very fine carbonation. The floral hops promised in the aroma are delivered in both flavor and firm bitterness that's equally balanced by semi-rich grainy malt. It finishes short and dry with a lingering note of floral/grassy hops. Very nice! Much more of a European lager than I expected, with a respectable amount of hops and a solid maltiness. Kudos!","NeroFiddled","Dec 11, 2002"
3.83,15.4,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Pours a slightly dark golden color with a thick, dense, blanket like head. Respectable lace. Excessive carbonation is notable in the appearance and the mouthfeel.

4.25,28,4,4,4.5,4.5,4,"Pours a golden color the supports a nice, medium head. Laces well. Nose of malt and hops and grassy tones. Great hop and malt flavor. Nice body and hop bitterness gives this one its character. Finishes crisp and clean.","Mick","Sep 25, 2002"
3.77,13.6,3.5,4,3.5,4,4,"pours golden with the same citrus aroma as out of the bottle. i found this on tap not to have as much flavor. then again, it was the first out of the keg. it did get better as i went through it. nothing is lost as far as the crisp brew that follows. a unique lager that is great to drink.","ElGuapo","Aug 17, 2002"
4.03,21.4,4,3.5,4.5,3.5,4,"This beer poured a beautiful golden yellow with a slight orange tint. It smells a little of citrus and hops, but the main scent is that of malt. This was a great tasting beer, with plesant bitterness, fair body, and appropriate carbonation. The dominant taste was grains, but there was a little malt dept as well. The bitterness was responsible for a pretty dry finish for this one as well as a grassy taste in on the back of the roof of the mouth..","yen157","Beers"
