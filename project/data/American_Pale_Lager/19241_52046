3.36,2.1,3.5,3,3.25,3.75,3.75,"Overall, this is a fresh brewery for us.  They certainly advertise this brewing company across Omaha locally enough, but we are kinda happy we got a sampling chance on this visit.  We had just finished “pint night” actually at a local beer bar, and were coming back to the hotel to finish out our night in the room.  In passing the snack area of the hotel lobby we came across a beer cooler, and obviously happily selected any local beverages that required rating, including this one.  This, as we expected from the description, was a simple lager.  It had a nice drinking face to it, but the flavor just wasn’t there in full force.  To retract, the flavor and nose were there in simplicity, but didn’t make you want to drink many more of these.  Perhaps if you’re going after a non-exclusively craft audience then it’s okay, but you’re not going to sway any IPA or stout seekers with this one.  The job is done, and one can move on from there.","TheBrewo","Dec 13, 2014"

Mouthfeel is light and crisp, with a bit of the hop and barley hull coming back in the aftertaste. Altogether a pretty unassuming brew, but as with beers like New Glarus Spotted Cow and August Schell's Nordeast, it is designed to be a step above the macro lagers- a gateway for the curious drinker used to beers brewed and marketed more as bulk commodities than as a hometown brew...","shadow1961","Jul 22, 2011"

3.13,-4.9,3.5,3,3,3,3.5,"Lucky Bucket Pre-Prohibition Style Lager was amber in color with good clarity. It had a beige head with decent retention. The smell was light malt with a little sweetness. The taste was lightly malty with a hint of sweetness upfront and some light hop flavor with a touch of bitterness coming through towards the finish. The mouthfeel was average with a light body and light carbonation. Drinkability was about average. It is a decent lager and worth a try.","afinepilsner","Sep 08, 2010"
3,-8.8,3,3,3,3,3,"The body is light....er, carbonation is quite crisp at the start and leaves a slight tingle through the finish. I say this is an average beer, because I wasn't the fondest of the flavor. If the flavor hits the spot for someone else, it may be very enjoyable.","climax","Jul 12, 2010"
3.55,7.9,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"It hit me on the 2nd bottle that this is basically an altbier. It has that kind of sharp worcestershire taste and the same color as an altbier. If you like that style - this is a good one!","brewduck","Jun 22, 2010"
3.23,-1.8,3.5,3,3,4,3.5,"Pours a pale yellow with small head. Not too much lacing. The smell has a very faint grassy flavour, but very mellow. Taste was quite mellow as well. Carbonation level was pretty much on for the sytle. A pleasant enough beer, but I didn't find it a ton better than some macro lagers.","kwjd","Jun 14, 2010"
2.75,-16.4,3,3,2.5,2.5,3,"Passable lager gotten in trade. Some malty aroma, some white head on light golden colour. A tad light mouthfeel, easy drinking. Pure example of style. A bit of hops, clean, crisp, and refreshing.Not overall exciting but that's the style, the kind of beer that was craft available in the Late Seventies.","Sammy","May 28, 2010"
3.56,8.2,4,3,3.5,4,4,"Ah, we pine for the days before all that Prohibitive nonsense, don't we? Just as we pine for the fjords whilst preening our lovely plumage? Yup. This guy pours every shade of auburn from a tiger eye (from the darker amber on top to a pale straw at the base, with several gradients in between) with a minor bubbly head. Imagine a close-up photo of a tiger cub's left eye (the right looks different...we think it's some sort of genetic defect...). The nose is faint, with hints of light wheat and what I struggle to perceive to be caramel. Luckily (hey, that bucket worked! Fuck that dirty ol' rabbit's foot!) the taste has more strength to it, with notes of wheat (slightly darker than in the nose), random grains, raw corn (or, as the Indians call it, maize), and a very mild bitterness. The body is quite smooth and light, with moderate carbonation and a crisp finish. Why can't more lagers be this solid? I guess we're just gonna haveta hog-tie Peabody, jack his Way-Back, and rock our way to the days before those damn early progressives caved to pressures from...whoa, curse these historian's impulses!","TMoney2591","May 06, 2010"
3.86,17.3,4.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,"D - Easy drinking. ABV is well within sessionability. Lightly filling at times. Malting is pretty assertive, leaving a sweet finish.","katan","Mar 31, 2010"
3.7,12.5,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"D - This is a decent session beer and a nice gateway to craft brews. There are no off flavors, but there's not much to this beer. I would recommend this to a friend that isn't into craft beer, but not to a veteran.","scoobybrew","Mar 25, 2010"
4.33,31.6,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Overall, I'm very impressed for this first offering from this upstart brewery. A little history.... the brewery was started by the former brewmaster of Upstream brewery... a local brewpub. Zach, the head brewmaster here has his masters in brewing, and has hit the ball out of the park! VERY NICE ZACH! Can't wait to see what's next!","Icehouse57","Dec 02, 2009"
3.35,1.8,3.5,3.5,3,3,4,"Picked this up because it is local; brewed in Nebraska. Interesting style choice for a small craft brewer, I guess they were trying to pull in BMC drinker, because there is not a lot here for most dedicated craft drinkers. Will I get it again? At the typical price I see it of $6.99, no. If it were cheaper, maybe if I'm in the mood to pound lagers.","BigRedN","Nov 05, 2009"
3.65,10.9,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,4,"Lucky Bucket is a very drinkable beer. Goes down easy and is very refreshing. Probably something I'd prefer in the summer, but I'm impressed in December, too.","NStLincoln","Aug 23, 2009"
3.66,11.2,4,3,3.5,4,4.5,"Very drinkable. One to keep stocked in your fridge in the summer. Would be a good beer to have in cans.","wcudwight","Beers"
