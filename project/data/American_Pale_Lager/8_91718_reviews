"kinda plain some good bitter in there"
"Glass- shaker pint"
""
"Similar to what Sierra Nevada tried with their Beer Camp Hoppy Lager and what Pyramid did with their IPL, I guess I crave the malt backing that a normal IPA provides to counter the bitter hops. Lots of grapefruit and citrus but no real malt presence. I think I'll just steer clear of this style- it's not for me."
""
""
"I know we are supposed to rate beers according to style, but I still don't understand the point of IPLs when you have IPAs."

"O: the flavor is a little disappointing;"
""
""
""
"Overall : if you're a fan of India lagers or ales, this is right up your alley. This is for sure a bitter and potent India style pale. On its own merit its a decent offering. Good for a taste but unfortunately overwhelming for me so I'm gonna drain the rest and save my workout calories for an old stand-by or two."
""
""
"Clear golden pour with minimal head—no lacing. Aroma of grass and biscuit. Flavor is semisweet, malty with a herbal bitterness. Very enjoyable up front, but a lingering dryness to the finish."
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Simply not a great beer: weak nose, fairly bland for an ""India"" style hoppy beer, dense body feel, and a very strange (but faint) chlorine-like off-note. Consumed within best by date, so freshness is not an issue. There's just not a lot good to say about this - one of the things you look for in a lager is a crisp, clean, and refreshing beer, and this one just doesn't really deliver. It's not the worst beer, but it sure ain't a great one. Very mediocre."
""
""
""
""
""

"Aroma is citrus, light pine and malts.  The flavor is citrus, light tropical fruit, hop resin, malts and a bitter/mildly earthy finish."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - This was ok.  The sweet flavors are a bit cloying and the mouthfeel is too sticky making it not very refreshing."

"Overall: an interesting hybrid beer that truly tastes like you combined a lager with an IPA."
""
""
""
"As decent beer. Pale, straw color in the glass. Crisp, dry, and with noticeable carbonation. Some fruit notes, noticeably lemon, and pine. A hint of wheat, and a long, dry finish. Nothing too bold, or overly original here, but a drinkable IPL. Worth a try at $9 for the six."

"Poured straight down into a large tulip. One finger head that settles down in under two minutes into white froth on the surface of the beer with noticeable lacing. Appearance is clear deep gold. Nose is somewhat subdued and features sweet, light malt with hints of sweet toasted grains, light orange and apricot, subtle grassy notes, and florally hops. Taste is sweet up front with the bitterness of the hops hitting on the midpalate. The flavors are nicely arranged with bittersweet grapefruit dominating, though not completely overpowering, a very pleasant floral, light honey sweetness showing sweet orange peel. Mouthfeel is slightly slick and very light with moderate, pleasant carbonation. The finish, which is surprisingly thin and short, is dominated by the bitter grapefruit as well as a slightly fruity sweetness with hints of ripe honeydew, orange, and apricot. This is the first time I’ve had an India Pale Lager (IPL), and if they’re all like this, then I’m sold. As others have pointed out, you get a light, crisp beer that also features both the floral complexity of a hoppy IPA as well as a nice dose of bitter citrus. This is almost the definition of perfect, sessionable, warm weather beer, though the well-hidden abv of 6.7 could pack an unexpected wallop."

"O) I liked the beer but thought it was a little harsh on the finish. I love IPAs and was expecting the bitterness, but it didn't feel balanced to me."
""
""
""
"O-nice hoppy lager, pretty solid flavor and easy drinking"
""
""
"Drank this in Maui and I must say that this is spot on for the style. Hoppy and yet clean as the style demands. Great nose and great finish on this beer. Would buy it quite a bit if it was available in BC. I can see this style becoming a common one just like DIPAs and IDAs."

"I'd buy this on tap happily but it doesn't do anything I haven't seen before and it more reminds me of a session IPA than an IPL. The content makes it a tough session though. Not sure what this beer is aiming for, but I suppose that's why it is rotational. Not bad, but not impressive."
"This was a suprisingly lovely IPL--we didn't realize it was an IPA until inspecting the label closer"
""
""
""
""
""
"A nice take on hoppy beers. Worth a try. I could see this as a good summertime staple."
""
""
"taste is thin. almost pilsner-y. for an IPA ? ? ? ? idunno. easy going down, for sure. very easy. not very ""stylish"". or ""authentic"". I suppose I could drink several of these in a row, and for the abv, that would be a good thing. but it calls itself an IPA.... I don't think so.... date on side is Oct 13... could it be old?"

"O: This was my first IPL (before the purchase, I was not even familiar with the style), and so I did not know what to expect, nor did I have a frame of reference for this tasting. It turned out to be exactly what I would think it would be based on the name of the style - the appearance and mouthfeel of a lighter lager with the pleasant hop profile of an APA. Since I'm getting too old to knock back 4-6 IPAs or even pale ales, this is a wonderfully sessionable beer. I would definitely recommend this to someone who likes hop profile but wants something nice and easy. I'll definitely be going back for more."

"The Hopside Down is a decent IPA from Widmer. There is nothing that separates itself from other westcoast IPAs....but it is a decent and sessionable offering. The scent is mild with fresh hop that provides hints of pine and citrus. The taste is a decent balance between bitter hops and a sweet malt. The bitterness starts and then the sweetness takes over. The mouthfeel is medium in body....with good carbonation. Overall this is a solid beer and a 6 or 12 would be in order."
""
""
"O: Could have been hopped more in my opinion. Not a bad pale lager/India pale lager, but nothing remarkable."
"Poured into a 13 oz snifter, bottled 10/4/13. Pours a dark yellow, with a one inch white head that leaves behind plenty of lacing. Smell is crisp pine, grapefruit, ginger, lemon, and pear. Taste is really crisp, lot of grapefruit and pine along with other tropical flavors. Body is maybe medium, lots of carbonation, a little dry, and easy drinking,will look for this in the summer. This is very good, I like the style and The Widmer Bros always make solid beers."
""
""
"Smells like an IPA but drinks like a lager. Aroma floral with some yeast/bready qualities maybe a little orange or other citrus lightly present. Appearance is clear golden yellow lacing present throughout with a nice creamy head that stays throughout. Taste is crisp with a slightly salty bitterness that is pine and roasted malts and pepper. Great balance and it finishes peppery but not bitter. Lager like finish with hops everywhere. This is almost a sessionable IPA/IPL from Widmer’s rotator series. Its exceptional medium to light body with good carbonation and a long finish. Its what I expect from the series which has featured amazing others including O’Ryely and Falconers IPA’s. Its a perfect IPA choice for someone who normally doesn’t like IPA’s."

"Overall: An IPL. I don't like them as much as IPAs. I'm sure it's possible to make one I'll like, but I haven't found one yet. This one is middle of the road; nothing wrong, not much to love. The hops are loud and forward, but the blend is a bit bitter and earthy. Some dried orange taste comes close to fruity, but almost cloved orange. Big punch for the abv, worth a shot but I'll pass on a 6er."
""
""
"Drinkability is low - I would definitely recommend this beer to anyone craving hops, as it's really interesting, but I would never want two of these in a row. Nonetheless, pretty clean and good-tasting start to finish, and overall, an interesting, very hop-forward take on the hoppy lager trend."
""
"A clear yellow with a dense, white head with decent retention and lacing, this is a solid IPL. The nose is full of hops, bright, citrusy, mildly rind-like and moderately pith-like. Clean, snappy and refreshing, this is solid. A touch of sweetness is present. The palate opens with a moderate bitterness, rather resiny with pine and citrus. This is followed with a rather clean hop flavor - grapefruit, pine, some orange - with no real grassy flavors. The mid-palate has a little bit of caramel, but what is striking is the mineral character on the finish that works really nicely with the snappy, resiny hops. Medium-light in body and moderately carbonated, this feels decent on the palate and has a nice, hoppy finish. Alcohol is a lot higher than it needs to be (IMO) but otherwise, this is a winner."

"India Style Pale Lager; quite a handle that sums up how this beer tastes and drinks. A very tasty hybrid that is refreshing and easy to drink and one I would consume on a regular basis. I liked this a lot and recommend trying it."
"This is a medium bodied brew with a modest amount of carbonation. It is crisp, refreshing and very easy drinking. Worth having a go at for sure."
""
""
""
"It's a great mixture of lager and IPA. Nicely hopped with a clear body and a clean finish."

"Pours a hazy honey orange with a foamy bone head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Thin swaths of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, citrus fruit, and some perfume-like aromas. Taste is much the same with grapefruit and citrus zest flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer with an interesting mix of citrus and perfume-like hop aromas that makes the smell slightly better than the taste in my opinion."
"Good to drink if your ""thirsty"" not looking to ""enjoy"""

"Which side is the hopside? Is it the same as turning something topwise? Anyway, this stuff pours a clear brass topped by a bit more than a finger of dirty white foam. The nose comprises mixed greens, mild pine resin, and a soft caress of cereal grains (I'm leaning toward clean oatmeal here). The taste brings in more of the same, with the pine a bit sharper and the grains coming across more like a light bit of cornbread. The body straddles the border between hefty light and light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a fluid feel. Overall, a nice little hoppy lager, nothing worth writing poetry over, but it'll do for a clean hop fix."

"This is a pretty solid beer. Not bad at all."

"O: Interesting style, I can't say I've ever seen something advertised as an India-style lager before. This keeps true to the style with its lightness & pure flavors, even so it could use a bit more complexity"
""
""
""
""
"Not sure how different a IPL is from an IPA, but this is a very tasty and hoppy brew. Big citrus and herb nose; slightly piney and resiny, with a malted cereal smell, like cream of wheat. Taste follows the nose with a very caramel, toasted flavor coming in after the initial hop charge. Not as bitter a backbone as other IPAs's (even though this is not an IPA), and slightly drier than one would expect considering the strong caramel flavors. The lager yeast gives this beer a clean and dry finish that is very appealing, leaving only the flavor of citrus hops and malty bread to linger. Not the bitter hop bomb that most drinkers seem to want, but still a drinkable and everyday hop heads beer."

"Man, I was anxious! I popped the cap, got an aggro pour going and I was off to the races, baby! Two dense, foamy fingers of French Vanilla-colored head with great retention and I had to wait. It looked like the top of an ice cream cone before it began to fall. Color was a deep, golden-yellow with NE-plus quality clarity, allowing me to see into the future. I will be drinking beer! SRM = 5 to 6 and the triumvirate of Croesus, Mammon and King Midas were all slathering. Not today, boys. Nose smelled like the interior of a pine forest. This is a lager?!? What hath man wrought? Mouthfeel was big, full and creamy, soft as well and the pine hops were like everything of Baby Bear's - just right. Man, I wonder how long they had to tweak this recipe becuase it could have easily been overpowered by the hops. One long draught later and sticky lacing was already beginning to appear. Finish was, indeed, clean and crisp with a lingering taste of hops. Gimme more!"

"O they accomplished what they wanted with gets the hops of an IPA combined with the crispness of a lager, but I wouldnt be jumping at the bit to buy a case any time soon. Had from bottle in sam adams glass."

"Poured into a Seattle Beer Week pint glass. Pours a light to medium golden amber with a thin white head that persists as a thick ring around the glass. Aroma of estery orange family juice, banana and light tropical fruit, light grassy hops, very refreshing fruit smell. Flavor follows with sweet bready malt, nicely mixed citrus and stone fruit juices and some suprisingly robust citrus hops in the flavor and finish. Good balance. Medium bodied with some creaminess. A nice lager that could pass as a low key American IPA, which probably would be a better style designation for it, although it would be in tougher competition. Much better than I expected and fun to drink. I will definitely buy this again when I want a nice malty IPA style but not looking for a hop bomb."
""
""
""
""
""
"The body was smooth and even, although perhaps just a bit too thick and sticky, and had a nice dry finish. Drinkability was good, I could see a few of these disappearing too easily at a cookout. Overall, a nicely enjoyable brew, not one that'll make the Uber beer nerds wet themselves, but one that;s certainly worth throwing a sixer of in the fridge or cooler."

"O: Found this one to be pretty enjoyable with really well hidden alcohol - this India Pale Lager hybrid style is becoming more popular recently and this is probably one of the better versions that I have come across. Easy to drink and one I could easily have a couple during a session - enough complexity /interest to keep me from getting bored with it but not a palate wrecker."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This would be hard to pick out as a lager in a blind tasting because of the pronounced hops, specifically the pineapple and grapefruit that come through. It is more like a pale ale but there is enough of that pale stale bread and big carbonation to see that its a lager. Extremely drinkable, you could easily pound a sixer of this. A good balanced malt and hop. /87"
""
"O: An aggressive lager that shows how far Widmer has come along. Does a lot of things right, including allowing for the consumption of multiples if you’re so inclined. A little more complexity and this would be a real stunner at a great price."
"The Verdict: It’s ok. Hophead may love it, but I was rather disappointed. Widmer generally brews some good balanced beers, but this one just came off as a bitter lager."
""
""
""
""
""
"overall a pleasant surprise in a uniquely brewed package. i like hoppy lagers, and this one reminds me somewhat of the SA varieties a few years back. recommended!"
""
"O- Not bad but there are definately better Ipas out there."

"Appears pale copper bright white head with fine lace. Aroma has citrus and floral hops with clean cereal grains. Flavor brings out a clean rolling bitterness mainly citrus pith from the hop additions. Mouthfeel, light carbonation light to medium bodied pulls off a crisp finish much like a lager except for more oily alpha acids here. Overall enjoyable but lacks some complexity crisp and hoppy."
""
" The taste is crisp which is expected from lagering, but has a nice amount of tangy hop flavor up front too, it is somewhat peach from first taste until mid palate and becomes a little more citrus and grapefruity into the finish with light astringency in the taste and slight malt toastiness backing up the hops with a gently sweet finish. Overall I am pleased to try this it has a fresh hop vibrancy and is very drinkable -Well done Widmer!"
"Overall: Good beer overall, nothing spectacular but pleasant to drink as none of the flavors are particularly overpowering and has a light crisp mouthfeel. This is what I'd imagine an IPA would taste like if it came as a light beer. You'd never know this thing was almost 7% ABV. I enjoyed this, definitely something you could have 2-3 of if the ABV wasn't so heavy. Summer beer in my opinion."
"O. The taste is very strong at first, but once you get used to it is fairly basic. It's easy and enjoyable, but nothing that stands out."
""
""
""
"This is really a solid offering. I think IPL are quickly becoming one of my favorite emerging styles. This can hang with any IPA that Widmer has put out in the rotator series. The hops are aggressive, assertive, bitter, and balanced, and the malt character is sweet which I like in IPAs and offers a solid backbone. Well done."
"A good stab at the India Pale Lager, pretty drinkable even for its size."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Bottle. I’m actually quite a fan of this emerging style... I was excited to try this one. Nose is decently hoppy with some grass elements coming off this one to me and just a little bit of that lager corn smell in there. Taste is much the same, with a hefty amount of bitterness from the hops and a hint of the lagery sweetness at the end."
""
""
""
"Overall a tasty and brawny hop bomb."
"A bit disappointed when comparing it to their other seasonal IPA’s. Good beer for the summer I suppose."
""
""
""
"O: I always have high hopes for an IPA coming from the West Coast because of the long line of amazing IPAs that comes from that part of the country but this does not fall into that category."
""
""
"Overall, kind of a mess of sweetness and bitterness."
""
"Poured from a bottle into a shaker pint, the beer is a bright, vibrant, crisp, clear, yellow-gold coloring with a thin, filmy, bright white head that quickly settles into a sparse surface coating. Aromas of biscuit, cedar pitch, pepper, canibus, and a lemon and grapefruit tart sweetness. Very balanced nose. Flavors are very bitter forward, with a dry, resinous cedar and grass character, blended with floral highlights and a toasted grain backbone. Resin and citrus sweet plows straight through to the aftertaste, with a bitter, dry, slightly resinous finish. This is a tasty beer, and much more hop-centric than other IPLs have been able to accomplish."
""
""
"O - Really enjoyed this one from the Widmer crew, great flavor and easy drinkability...real easy to get 3-4 or deep on this stuff"
""
""
""
""
"Overall this is one of the best beers I have tasted this year."
""
""
""
"Overall, this a nice hoppy lager at an agreeable price point. I just wish it was a touch lighter in body and with a bit less ABV. Widmer has been putting out some pretty good beers lately, and this is another solid offering."
""
""
""
""
"Overall - A solid brew in this relatively new style, though the style doesn't seem necessary, IMO, as there are several light-bodied IPAs on the market."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Taste is really pleasingly well-hopped, with a bitter citrus bite and underlying toastiness backing it all up. Would easily pass for a solid IPA from some breweries. Very enjoyable and a well-done stylistic twist. Bravo!"

"I generally find all of Widmer Brothers rotating IPAs to be solid, though not necessarily memorable brews. Hopside down continues this trend. Certainly a unique brew, combining the aspects of both an IPA and an all malt lager. However this proves to be a double edged sword. While this beer is more refreshing than your standard IPA thanks to the cleaner finish and lighter mouthfeel, it also looses complexity and aroma characters. On the flip side, it is more interesting than your standard lager, but not nearly as refreshing due mostly to the strong hop aftertaste. I commend this beer for trying something new and would gladly drink it again, but don't see myself going too far out of my way to get it."
""
"O/D-The hot new style. I respect the attempt. I am spoiled because I can get Jack's Abby whenever I feel the need so this brew sadly can't beat that out."
"O: Certainly one of the best IPLs I've tried, but then there haven't been many. Nonetheless, this easy drinking and refreshing beer is recommended for those seeking something like an APA. Also may serve as a major upgrade from a macro-brewed lager."
""
""
"Nice hop snap to this one, very refreshing indeed!"

"Brewed on April 7th 2013.Poured into a pokal clear light to medium golden with a great looking two finger bone white head that clung to the glass like glue,it settled into a moon surface-looking mass after quite awhile.A mix of toasted bread,wet graininess,and grassy/spicy hops,a nice mix with all coming together really well.Flavors of bread dough and mild honey upfront with a nice toasted crispness midway that melds into a ""green"" spicy/herbal hoppy finish.I gotta say I really liked this beer,Widmer did themselves proud on this hybrid beer wich to me is alot like a uber hopped spring bock."

"O: IPL isn't something you see everyday. This is a solis example. An easy drinking good beer as I've come to expect from Widmer."

"Thoroughly decent. Real hop presence, round body, and a bite in the aftertaste. A pleasant surprise."
""
""
"O: Better than most of the American Pale Lagers you'll find out there, but a bit uneven. Still, a drinkable enough beer."
""
""
"Atmosphere is really nice. Lots of effervescence, giant head, and plenty of lacing. Nose is malty, earthy, and hoppy. Malt, hop, citrus with plenty of pungent bitterness. Overall, this is a really good quaff."
""
"Pours a clear, gold with a 1 finger width, off-white head. Bubbles rapidly raise from the bottom of the glass. Smells and tastes of floral hops along with a balance of toasted, bready malts. The mouthfeel starts with some strong carbonation with a light to medium body. A bitter finish as well. A solid India Pale Lager, would be a great sessionable, flavorable brew if it weren't for its 6.7% ABV."
""
""
""
"Overall a good brew for an over-hopped lager. I think there are better IPAs even in the Widmer rotator series."
""
""
""
""
"More complex in aroma than flavor. Bitterness is on par for the style, albeit but the crisp finish makes it too overwhelming for my palate, and malt supports the hops fairly well. Hop character is a bit too resiny for my liking."
""

"Overall I'm a fan of where this style is headed and glad to see Widmer jumping on it. A good one for not only hopheads but some more adventurous lager drinkers."

"Picked up a sixer of this because it was cheaper than Sam Adams Double Agent IPL and I was hoping for the same effect. Dark orange color, good suds. Aroma was some hops, bit of malt, boring. Alas, this is not as good. It does have a grassy hop flavor and it is definitely a lager but the alcohol was a bit much for me given the style. I'd go back to the Sam Adams offering every time."

"4/3.5/3.5/3.75/3.75"

"Picked this up from the Widmer's brewery. An Indian Styled Pale Lager...I classified as an IPA since it is part of Widmer's Rotator IPA Series. Poured from the bottle....clear looking amber color and a decent one finger head. This is a weird one from a smell and taste perspective. Has all the crisp clean features you like from a lager, but there is a nice follow through of hops that makes it a much more interesting beer. I think this is a very good beer...Widmer's did well on this one."
