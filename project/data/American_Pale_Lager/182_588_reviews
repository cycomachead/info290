"Yuengling Premium Beer brew by Yuengling Brewery, with an ABV of 4.40% This brew pours out a nice amber color with a nice white head.  The smell is sweet with grains and malts. You pick up a hit of hops in the smell of this brew.  Now for the taste it is sweet with grains and malts. Not bad but not great.  Yuengling Premium Beer has a nice balance to it, there is nothing overpowering in this brew.  The mouthfeel of  Yuengling Premium Beer is nice,clean and smooth.  There is nothing bad about this brew. I like how this brew goes down smooth.  Overall I'm giving Yuengling Premium Beer a 4.25 out 5. This brew is a nice drinking brew.  Nothing fancy but nothing cheap.  I would buy this brew again.  Thank you Yuengling Brewery"

"Looks like the average American adjunct. Smell is of yeast. Taste is of corn and yeast. I did not like this"

"I think this is a pretty goo beer for the particular 'style'.  That is to say that it is a good easy drinking session beer.  If at a party drinking many beers with many wings I think it is a good choice.  Pleasant taste and aroma.  Looks light in color and has a clean smooth taste to match.  Poured with a decent head, but it did not last long.  Very mild hop aroma.  Some say it has a corn flavor??  I cannot say I detect that, but it is certainly light in flavor.  If I were going to drink one beer each night, I would pick something more full bodied...but as a party brew, this is pretty good."

"Overall (3.37) : It's a competent lager with some traditional B/M/C characteristics. It's got some nice bready hop and banana that set it apart from the rest and actually reminds me a little of Natural Ice. I'm not secretly aching inside wishing they sold it here in my part of the country, but I'd try it again if offered. It is a capable and tasty adjunct lager."

"overall- again, at 5.00 a 6 pack you can't go wrong. In my opinion, puts Miller, Bud, and Coors all to shame and saves you money in the process."

"Poured from a 12 oz can into a 14 oz ""pint"" glass. Pours translucent straw with a fluffy white head. Smells of sweet cereal grain, a tad bit of corn, very sweet. Tastes of cereal grain, but much more flavorful than most adjuncts. Beer is light bodied, easy drinking, good carbonation. Overall, a slightly above average beer."
""
""
""
"O: not bad... the fruity-ish, bubblegum/citrus peel elements could be toned down a touch, but they're not all that off-putting... actually, the level of dryness balances that out nicely... would prefer to have more of a grainy, bready taste here, but this has enough flavor not to be completely insipid"
""
""
""
"Overall: Well, it's chuggable and cheap."

"DATE TASTED: 9/4/2014... GLASSWARE: Ommegang 10-year pokal...OCCASION: the NFL begins again... APPEARANCE: white, fizzy, foamy head that fizzles quickly; clear golden yellow body--random lacing... AROMA: sharp doughy cracker malts and roasted toffee melt together with a rust copper aroma--oddly familiar but, under scrutiny, not so desirable... PALATE: fizzy and slightly oily/buttery; easily drinkable, as it no doubt is designed to be...TASTE: sweet, malty and metallic, as remembered...a distinct central PA lemongrass and hard water combination...OVERALL: familiar but significantly less frequented than the traditional lager, the premium carries less weight than the lager but has a little more taste than the light--but not enough to elicit comparison or deeper analysis..."

"I'm no connoisseur, but I enjoy fancy beers. Having said that, this is my ""go-to"" beer when all I can reach is the local gas station before kick-off. Gotta love the oldest brew in the states. Great for Saturday afternoons watching football."
""
""
""
""

"Kinda sweet and malty with a hint of metallic hops on the nose. Maybe a hint of cooked corn and dirty dishwater as it warms. Flavor is right there too; sweet malt, metallic hops and cooked corn. Moderately low carbonation lends a pleasant, creamy mouthfeel. Somewhat lengthy mouth-coating impression keeps it from being a “clean” finish, even though it's mostly flavorless."

"I like this beer regardless of what others say this beer taste better than Coors and Budweiser beers. The beer is used to drink as my regular beer and I still but six pack now again. A good drinking beer when you don't want a lager or a Ale and just want a plain good beer to drink."

"Big Time disappointment. Yuengling makes it a point to call this premium beer, but it's average at best (and that's basing average on the BudMillerCoors standard crap)."

"Poured very pale yellow, straw color with a white suddsy head. Clear with obvious carbonation showing. Not very aromatic, hints of malt, maybe corn, and grass. Beer also smells like its starting to skunk. Taste is slightly sweet up front with just a little bitterness on the finish. Thin mouthfeel, slightly dry, but very drinkable. An easy pick over other the macro-AALs out there since it actually has some flavor and some aroma."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The body was the typical thin and crisp expected from the style. Drinkabilty was OK, the beer went quickly and with much effort. Overall, an OK beer, it is what it is, and you probably know what you're getting when you buy the beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Crisp and refreshing, as most light lagers can be, but clean with a body actually veering toward medium."

"Overall: Typical AAL profile, although a bit subpar. Fans of BMC would enjoy this, but I'd recommend Yuengling Traditional any day."
""
""
""
"Overall – Easy drinking beer with a moderate level of flavor. A very standard American lager."
""
""
""
""
"This is a very sessionable lager. In drinkability it's not unlike the Traditional Lager, but in flavor it's rather weak and disappointing."
""

"This is a very easy drinking, well balanced beer. A great lager for a hot summer day."

"I seen this for the first time last week and I cant find it anymore. I'm very familiar with the traditional lager but this poured a little lighter in color but seemed to have more flavor a sweeter aroma. It was crisp and refreshing and for $4.29 for 4 pint cans its a good deal."

" The flavor is dry and grainy with a corny slightly sugary taste w/ a hint of toast. The taste is slick like canned corn with the malt light. The overall flavor is clean expect for the DMS which is distracting although the crisp finish is like eating a corn pop - it leaves little in the way of taste after the swallow, just comes and goes like a pop song. Overall I don't fault this it is not terrible, just not impressive and a lackluster flavor in general. I think it might appeal to those who may like other mass produced lagers"

"This is one of the few beers that I actually prefer from a can. That and the fact that we could get a case of pounders in college for about $15! Nothing really stands out about this ""premium"" offering from America's oldest brewery. If all you want to do is get hammered with a couple buddies, you could do worse than this beer...but not much."
"overall: basic pilsner, has all the elements one would expect for a ""premium."""
"Poured into a red Solo cup (muahaha), a pale straw-yellow color, fizzy, with a finger or two of bubbly white head that receded quite a bit rather quickly. Aroma of boring grains, light floral hops, and a bit of citrus zest. The taste followed the smell pretty closely, with grains, pale malts, light floral hops, all a bit metallic, but not entirely unbearable. Light mouthfeel, and fairly drinkable particularly if nothing else is available."
"This beer sucks."
"Pours straw-gold and clear, with fizzy white topping of foam. Smell is grainy. and macroish. Reminds me of PBR, or Genny red, or high life, or many many others. Taste is simple, grainy also with just a faint hop bitterness. Mouthfeel is crisp, thin and finishes clean. Overall this is similar to Yuengling Lager except for the color, and this also lacks the distinct sulphur character. Decent enough brew, low ABV makes for easy drinking. Hard to find except at some distributors."
"Straw yellow in color, pleasant aroma, typical pale taste, very middle of the road but also refreshingly drinkable. An excellent choice for hanging out with friends in the bar! It goes very nicely with seafood, this I tried at a Red Lobster here on Long Island."
"East-coasters dump on this plenty, but to be honest, this definitely outpaces a lot of mediocre craft APL's I've had in my time."
"O-listed as a pale lager? no, thats wrong. this is an adjunct, and its terrible even for an adjunct...its just that bad. the tastes themselves aren't horrible, but the overall lack of taste is just upsetting."
"completely blah beer."
"Obviously not a craft beer, but I have no serious complaints."
"I am not impressed, this is a very mediocre beer. it is half way between yuegling light and their lager. I am a big fan of the Lager so I thought I would give this one a chance. I know not to do that again. It has a very tinny metallic flavor that I assume comes from the can , which when i have had the Lager in the can is not present. I think this is the biggest disappointment from Yuegling I have had."
"A pale golden lager with thin head that goes away rather quickly. Smell is of light malt and mild hops. Taste is lightly sweet and with a doughy breadiness. Thinnish feel with fizzy carbonation that has a light crispness. I have heard this referred to a Pennsylvania's Bud. Inbev should only be so lucky. Not a bad beer and for the style a solid player with real flavor and refreshment."
"O: A little flavorful, goes down easily, not too filling, mild kick, good representation of style, this beer has a little bit more flavor and substance than your typical macro but over a it’s really just a mediocre beer."
"Po'd up in lil cup at the Tampa Yuengling Brewery. I cannot imagine what is 'Premium' about this. I like Yuengling products, nearly across the board, but this is terrible. It looks like garden variety light fizzy swill, but smells far worse than the average adjunct lager. It literally reeks of urine, or goats, take your pick. It tastes pretty bad too, but just like cheap watery beer (maybe a tad sweaty); it is not scary-bad like the smell. Do not fall for the label; this is vastly inferior to all other Yuengling products."
"O: Yinz know? Kinda fun to drink (PS I have no idea if that's proper Pittsburgh-ese, but it's fun to say/think/type 'Yinz'!). I'm no big fan of Pale Lagers, but this happens to be a pleasant and nicely drinkable one - rather benign, but light and refreshing, and without a completely watery disposition. Thanks, Woody!"
"Can - poured half into a pint glass, drank the other half right from the can. Pours a crystal clear, straw-yellow. A big frothy white head rests atop though. Minor lace. Nose is average for the style, some graininess, faint lemon zest, mildly floral. Crisp, clean mouthfeel. Light and easy to drink. Buttery breads, faintest of bitterness, mild citrus. This really reminds me of Coors Banquet, which I like. Extremely drinkable and not all that bad. Has more flavor than its peers for the most part. Perfect summer gulper. Thanks to woodychandler for this toss-in in a surprise box!"
"This is probably my least favorite release from Yuengling. This beer is very generic, I can't honestly say that there is anything special in this that would make someone seek it out. I've had one bottle of this and it was pretty much just your typical run of the mill brew. Yellow in color, taste is of some malts and corn, not much hops to speak of."
"Overall it's a decent beer for the price. I'm a fan of traditional Yuengling and I haven't ever had a ""bad"" beer from those guys at Pottsville, PA."
"Tastes like a typical macro. Nearly no hop, weak, but grainy malt. Thin bodied with a crisp mouthfeel. simply said, a lawn mower beer."
"D- Easy to drink, not complex. Simple."
"Honestly, I've killed about three cases of these in the past half year, and every time I buy one, I remember why I hadn't for a while. They give me gas and make me queasy. On average it's one of the cheaper lagers out there. But drop the $2 extra and buy the Premium's older, more sophisticated brother: The Yuengling Original."
"D: I could drink a fair amount of it, but I would probably chose not to. It isn't offensive or even bad, just not appealing to me, I'd much rather have the traditional lager from Yuengling. Glad to try it."
"Good value for the price."
"Pours a thin yellow straw color with a sickly thin white head and no real lacing to speak of. Smells of adjuncts such as corn, rice, and simple grain. Some malty sweetness in the nose as well. No hops to be found. Tastes mostly the same some sweet corn and malt and a little biscuit or yeast bread. Mouthfeel is very thin and not too wonderful. Drinkability is not great."
"Pours a light golden color with a white head and a bit of lacing. The nose brings some slight Noble hops as well as grain. The taste is grain and a bit if bread. Some slight bitterness in a lift body. Drinks okay and is much better than High Life and the like, but not too great."
"Poured from a 16 oz. can. Has a light golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is a bit sweet, some malts. Taste is crisp, grains and malts, some sweetness, very refreshing. Feels light in the mouth and is very drinkable. Overall this is a pretty good beer."
"Not quite sure what makes it premium but this is a good everyday lager. Nuthin' fancy but drinkable nonetheless."
"A fine beer overall, for what it is."
"Drinks easy, nothing special here, but I could do a few on hot summer's day, like today. Better than most of it's ilk, a pleasant suprise"
"Reigning champ of cheap beer! This and Miller High Life are my budget go to brew. Considering I am located approximate 2 hrs from the brewery and my local shop sells a ton of this -- I get it nice and fresh. This is classic beer ""beer"". Nothing fancy. Tastes crisp and clean with a touch of body and grain/hops. Ice cold it's a great BBQ or boating beer. No one will be offended or not enjoy one out of the ice box. A sixer goes down quick as the ABV is a mere 4.4%. Kinda nice for a long, relaxed brew session. In some ways, I prefer to the Yuengling lager. Also, at $11-12 bucks a case, easy on the wallet."
"d- okay, this is a very reasonable (aka super cheap $13-14/case) beer that goes down easy, and is nice and refreshing. you really can't go wrong with yuengling."
"A bland, unappealing lager with a particularly unpleasant finish. No different from any typical BMC product. Stick with the traditional lager if you can, this stuff is pretty bland."
"Pours a pale golden straw color with a 2 finger fizzy head that settles quickly. Slightly hazy when held to the light. Smell is fairly nuetral with a bit of sweet malts coming through. A slight scent of something metallic. Taste is decent. Nothing crazy or unique but extremely clean, classic american pale lager flavor. Mild light malt flavor with just enough hops for balance. No major off-flavors here. Mouthfeel is fluid and crisp. This went down quickly and I am not a fizzy yellow beer fan. For what it is, it's done well."
"D: This is a supremely drinkable summertime beer. I, just very recently, drank a metric shit ton of their Trad. Lager down in the FL keys and that is nowhere as enjoyable as this. I understand that this sells for about $12 for a 24-pack. You can't beat that!"
"D: This is better than BMC, but I much prefer PBR if I am forced to drink an mass-produced American lager."
"D: This is a good beer to drink over and over again"
"D - this beer is quite sessionable."
"Cheers!"
"very easy to throw back but if you're gonna get yuengling you should just get the traditional lager, this is like the pbr (not that there's anything wrong with that) of yuenglings family.. i'd rather just drink a schaefer."
"Yuengling Premium Beer, was a much lighter color, with a decent head. There wasnt much in the way as a smell, and the taste was okay. There were no strong flavors that stood, out and there really wasnt a srong hoppy taste, but no Yuengling really has this. It taste pretty similar to thier traditional lager, and that included that slightly stale taste. Even though its light, and has a weak taste, I really wouldnt enjoy having more then 1 or 2. Overall its a very average beer, better then alot of other stuff you could buy, but you can pick up Yuengling Premium Beer for a pretty cheap price."
"Pours a straw color with a lively white head, only fair retention and little to not lacing evident. Aroma is comprised of chiefly grassy and straw elements, interestingly spot on actually. This comes across pretty close to a traditional pilsner on the nose, it could probably use a little bit more malt to balance it out. The taste has a pleasant straw and grassy character with good moderate bitterness. There is a touch of a plastic and grain to it, but the flavors are mostly hitting the mark here. For the style, this is pretty good, and for the price yes indeed again. Light bodied with fizzy carbonation. Drinks fairly well, this is a beer I'd like to have available for the days when a less expensive/complex brew is in need."
"Very drinkable"
"M/D - Mouthfeel is weak, but not surprising. I would call this very drinkable if you were looking for a lawnmower beer."
"a good beer but not my favorite from Yuengling"
"Yuengling's offerings are among my favorites."
"A finger-plus of off-white head with decent retention. Col.or was a lemony, sunshine-yellow with NE-quality clarity. If nothing else, it looked like sunshine/summer in a glass. Nose had a solid lager sweetness, none of that adjunct B. S. Mouthfeel was full with a lot of carbonation scrubbing away all of the B. S. on my tongue as I swirled it around. Taste was light, but clean. Again, this was more like a real Lager than their own Lager! It had a refreshingly mild sweetness along with a palatable flavor. I think that I was poisoned as a kid when when I heard adults sneer about it as ""Coal Country Beer"" while swigging Rolling Rock. What was that? ""Steel Country Beer"" woulda been Arn, ya jagovs! How would yinz have characterized Rolling Rock back inna day? Coal, Shmoal, it is a decent lager. Hey, take this to the beach in place of TenFidy and you'll only be thanking me. I still want to have Lord Chet in a CAN before I make my final pronouncement from on high in CANdom Come. Finish was lager sweet, but sans adjunct flavors. A nice, simple, German-style lager from PA. I am starting to doubt my own prejudices."
"The feel is easy drinking. Just smooth enough to be a pleasure with a little bit of a bitterness that comes through as it goes down."
"EDIT (2+ years later)...right up there with PBR and other slightly sweet brews...need to buy the porter soon so i can transform this back into a black and tan. i still prefer the 60s formula Schlitz as the go-to macro. all said and done, give this a moment and it will deliver a delicate kiss of hops after the thankfully dry sweet notes fade fast. does this come in a bottle? i can't remember. whatever, it will be great after a 2 hour romp on the singlespeed 29er. or a 40+ minute cyclocross race ;)"
"D- Great session beer for eleven bucks a case at my local distributor. The sweetness in my opinion holds it back slightly, reminds me somewhat of drinking a soda. Still will have no problem finishing the case very quickly."
"Drinkability is real good. A great lawnmower beer. Solid. Yes, I love my Victory Lager, Brooklyn Lager and my Saisons on a warm summer day. But I still keep some Yuengling Premium in the fridge as well. Old habits die hard."
"D- i couldnt drink anymore after this one. Its not bad but its not good."
" D: I find this beer very drinkable due to the fact that back in the day this is the only thing me and my budies would drink (im glad we got out of that) I rarley buy it any more but if its on tap ata weding or someone has a case at a party i will surley take it over the miller or the coores"
"Had a bottle at Volpe's in Emmaus, PA. I have to say I prefer this to Yuengling Lager. There's a similar, but toned-down, malt sweetness that actually tastes like pale barley (not corn). Still a bit watery overall, but the bar was hot and this was refreshing. Worth a try if you're curious about what else Yuengling makes."
"Poured from a 12 ounce bottle into my shaker ""pint"" glass. Appears a crystal clear, bright yellow color with about half an inch of quickly fading off white foam. The foam settles into a thin layer within seconds. Smells and tastes of super bready grains, crisp fruitiness, mild corniness. Crisp and thin in both body and carbonation. It'll do in a pinch around here."
"Drinkability: Well, I guess its drinkable based on the other factors, as in, you could pound a few of these without any trouble. But I personally wouldn't do that"
"Comes out of the tap a clear, orangy amber with a fluffy beige head. Aroma is malty, slightly fruity and slightly sweet. Flavor is satisfying, if not complex, malty with an undertone of apple, sweet hints, and a touch of hops. Texture is smooth and nicely tingly. Not great, but OK."
"O: Premium is a great summer beer, drink it when cutting the grass or working on the car to quench your thirst."
"One of my favorite macros. Head that dissipates rapidly and pours a slightly darker than usual color. Aroma is a little metallic but very subtle. The best quality in this beer is it's taste is more complex than your average macro. The downside to this often overlooked brew, is that it is only served in an odd number of states. (ohio is not one of them so we sometimes have to cruise over the border to Sharon PA to get our hands on some of it.)"
"D. Pretty average drinking. Not bad given the style, but pay the extra dimes and get the traditional lager."
"D: Drinkability pretty much mirrors mouthful. Premium???"
"Drinkability: is very high..very light beer goes down great ...easy tailgate beer"
"Notes: It could have been a lot worse,but I tried this because a few friends told me they were really feeling this beer and I said I would give it a chance. If I were at some stadium and I had to choose between this and a Bud, it's a Bud all the way."
"This is one of my favorite choices for a macro lager. Has something special I can't put my finger on that makes it stand out to me from other macros. While there are definitely some hints of corn as an adjunct ingredient, it has some nice grainy and floral aromas and a bitter, sharp, and dry flavor profile. I group it with good ol' PBR as far as macros go, high above the big three. This is a favorite of my Pennsylvania friends, and I usually have some when I'm in the area."
"Bought in Emmaus Pa. at Shangy's Beer Heaven for $12.99 a case."
"Pale yellow colored beer with a rapidly fading head.Taste and aroma are like most macros.This beer has a decent fresh taste with nothing offensive.A decent brew that is perfect for summer outings or Sunday football games.I would have no problem buying this again."
"Poured a light gold with minor head that receeded with lacings a little. A husky, grainy smell with some minor earth tones from hops. A light-bodied beer with a sharp bite from the hops and a little citric notes in the taste, but not much. Not well balanced as it seemed a little dry for my liking. It is like a pale ale, but w/o the distinct taste and more like a real bitter cheap macro. Never understood why Yuengling makes this beer - unlike the Lager which is immensely popular and on tap in almost every SW bar in PA, the beer is almost unseen (and unliked)."
"poured a clear golden color with a little bit of white head. Smell is kinda hoppy with a little malt presence to balance it out. Taste is just bite of a tin can with a little bit of beer. Mouth is crisp and carbonated for a refreshing drink. Not the best beer, but not the worst."
"I have this beer offten and I like it very much. It is more to my taste then their Lager I really don't care for their Lager. I have had it on draft,bottle and can and it awalys has a nice grainy smell. It pours pale yellow and has a small head and light lacing on the glass.To me it tastes great smooth and refreshing, and easy to drink they made their fortune on this one way back. You can sit down and drink a few and not feel full or like you had too much. In your mouth it gives a nice refreshing feel and you can enjoy a few of these doing stuff like the lawn whatever and each one is enjoyable till your done no after taste. If you have never tried this one give it a try."
"D: Not an easy drinker, I certainly would not buy it and would probably would only drink it if I was desperate."
"However, this one was rather refreshing and enjoyable. Although it doesn't have the complexity of the top rated beers on the site, it servers its purpose, and does it well. If you're mowing the lawn or out on a boat with non-craft beer friends, there probably isn't a better beer (although you can probably find another AML that's almost the same). Recommended, in its place."
"Pours a clean/clear pale yellow color, nice carbonation, huge white end that dissappears quickly to some islands, basically not sticky lacing on this one. The nose is malty/hoppy, rice, and some caramel. The taste is slightly sweet, malty/hoppy, rice. Light body. I would not buy this if it was available here in Utah, nice to try it once though."
"Eric"
"If you have this against other macro brews, take this one. Its not great, but its very good for the style."
"Don't drink and review."
"This one of those Macro Smackdowns that is a battle of attrition rather than a glorious victory followed by a ticker-tape parade. Yuengling Premium, although nothing even remotely special, is the winner by virtue of its classic flavor profile and its lack of off-flavors. Amazingly, it's still better than just about anything you're likely to find clogging up the coolers at your local Quickie Mart."
"A light colored lager with some hop ""kiss"" - nice drinkability - refreshing - smooth - a session beer at its best."
"Had this among others this weekend and to be honest this is the one I kept coming back to over the course of my weekend. This has a more complex malt taste than a lot of the other lagers offered out there and a nice little hop bite compared to most macro lagers. I would say that if you're going to be drinking macro lagers this is in my opinion close to top of the list"
"An average beer. This is a great beer for hot dogs and burgers on the grill. Nothing to try and go out of your way for. A slightly above average choice in a field of weak beer."
"This isn't completely undrinkable, but there is an astringency not found in many other macro-types. Unimpressive, even for style. While there is a hop presence, it is too bitter and the corn smell and taste just interferes without adding flavor or light-bodiedness (so what is the point?) Well, it is cheap. But, you get what you pay for in this case..."
"Didn't really prefer this beer much from the bottle and was hoping for better off the tap. But, while is South Carolina, it was the most sevice-able beer to wash down the Jambalaya. The beer was severy very cold, but once it warmed, it shows some malt / caramel flavors and aromas above a timid body and cola-like appearance. Seemed to go down fine with a mild grain flavor and sticky feel in the finish. Certainly prefered to an Amber Bock or the Black and Tan."
"I'd recommend it to the Yuengling fans, for it's half of the ingredients to your almighty Black and Tan. (They use the Premium and Porter for that.) Not bad at all, and a nice backyard bbq brew. Cheers my BA friends!!!"
"Overall an easy drinking macro. Not too bad ice cold."
"Bottom line: This is a thirst quencher and, in my book, totally inoffensive. I like it. My thanks to jwc215 for sending me this one!"
"This is a good drinkable beer, I could hit it hard if I had to. A much better choice than a typical BMC would be."
"Pours very pale gold with almost no head retention or aroma. It's better than most macro lagers I have tasted (there's actually some bitterness trying to come through, I think) but still not anything to write home about. I'm pretty sure there's corn in this too."
"Cheers!"
"Clear medium-pale yellow with a small, white, creamy head with good retention. Smells grassy and grainy. Light, but not too bad. Taste is of weak grain and hops that dont really balance all that well. Some light apple and a bitter finish with a touch of citrus rind. It has a medium-thin body, dry texture and low carbonation. Its not a terrible beer, but nothing Id ever really have again by choice."
"Anthor good environment, but it wasnt the BEST beer ever. Pale limp kinda unimpresive but it had a deffinate drinkability. I liked the mouthfeel but didnt love it but it was pretty ok. THis was a brew bought with some anticipation but didnt live u the hype my brother gave it It was fair enough but if something ese better is on tap take it."
"It tasted balanced, a little corn flavor maybe, but maybe I was imagining it. Not a bad beer for a ball game, but nothing to savor at home."
"Even though the classification of American Macro Lager can be like a figurative scarlet letter. I'd have to say it is one of the better ones. I'm a born and raised Philadelphian that ""grew up"" on this stuff, which can be seen from my various Yuengling apparel, bottle openers, and glassware. So even though I have and will continue to encounter stronger and more flavorful brews. I'll always have a desire to pick up some of this every now and then."
"Musings: This is a lager I drink in the summer quite a bit. Hence my interest in the cans. It's not a terrible brew - actually for the price point it is right up near the top. However, it does have the ""whats that taste"" characteristic to it that needs to be explained."
"From a one quart ""stubbie on steroids"" bottle. Pours out to a clear golden color with a big white head of foam that quickly calms to about 1/8th inch. No lacing. Medium to medium high levels of carbonation. Aromas are light, some floral hops and malt. Smells fresh. Taste is mediocre; some malt, grain, and a definite whisky like flavor toward the finish. Mouthfeel is uninspiring, yet not dead, as the carbonation keeps things alive on the palate. Fair drinkability. I think I like regular Yuengling better, but this bottle is bad-ass. Thanks goes out to MaltyGoodness for the sample."
"I had high, high hopes for this beer when I tried it. Yuengling Premium! It must be a step above the Traditional right? How awesome would that be? Well I guess we'll never know (from the Yuengling Brewery that is) because this is definately NOT a step above traditional. It is a step below. It turns out that ""Premium"" is a euphamism for ""Macro"". That's what this is, Yuengling Brewery doing a Macro style beer, as opposed to Traditional, which is well traditional (That's Amber American Lager, it was a style which was a much bigger pre-prohibition staple in America). Anyway the color is a sort of clear-gold. Not nearly as deep as say Urquell but noticably more amber than most macros. Compared to the Traditional its lighter and clearer. Smell is pretty boring. A little sweet grain and a lot of hops. The hops are kind of hard to describe. I guess I'd call them metallic or typical macro if I found them objectionable, but I don't. They're pretty bitter, but leave no unpleasant aftertaste. They're clean and surprisingly strong for the style, but still not too interesting. I guess the best way to describe them would be typical macro hops if typical macro hops were't disgusting. They are balanced by light malts that are slightly sweet. Mouthfeel is all about carbonation. Maybe this would feel thin if not for all those bubbles, but I honestly can't tell you. I could taste the beer fine, but carbonation was all the mouthfeel I could get. Drinkability is fine. You could definately drink these all night. The hops don't get in my way, the taste isn't bad, nothing is wrong with this except that no store or bar exists that carries this unless they carry the Traditional Lager as well, so why bother? This is obviously what Yuengling brewed to catch the Budweiser crowd. And the result? Well it splits the difference. It definately kicks Budweiser's ass by not being the least bit nasty or looking anything like urine. But Traditional Lager in turn kicks its ass by looking the way real beer should look and packing a lot more taste. Uses? Serving to my friends who when I tell them my favorite beer say ""Yuengling? That's like liquid bread"" or ""Wow that's really strong beer."" This would be a good compromise for them, maybe even a good gateway to discovery of the fact that there are more than 3 breweries in this country. I would call this the best macro-style out there except who the hell wants a macro-style beer from a regional brewery even if they do a good job? The Traditional owns this and the easily outsells it besides."
"This beer poured a crystal clear yellow color with a one figne frothy white head, which went down quickly. Streams of bubbles arose from the bottom. Smell was malty. Taste consisted of light malt which became fuller throughout. A slightly sweet quality was also detected, as was a metallic quality to the beer. Light in the mouth, but not too watery. An okay brew. Definitely not as good as Yuengling Lager."
"IMHO, rating beer is ike rating pies or sandwiches. You can't compare dutch apple to pumpkin if you're not a pumpkin fan (which I am, by the way). Likewise, a PBJ will never measure up to a BLT (unless you truly prefer peanut butter). Yuengling is going out on a limb to call this beer ""premium," but in the realm of comparing similarly priced adjunct (regional) macro lagers, this is a keeper. Smooth, easy to drink, nicely carbonated, refreshing, balanced taste, and (given its limited distribution area) quite fresh to boot. Much different than the Traditional Lager, yet equally unique in its quality. Yuengling has a reputation for taking the macro-brew to a whole new level of taste. This one is no exception!"
"Drinkablity: Drank 12 within the weekend. Really easy beverage to drink, especially when it was hot, I'd consider this again over any of the BMC and Genny and PBR."
"Drinkability: standard"
"poured a clear light amber color with white puffy head that has good staying power. Smell is on the sweet side with a mild malt background. Taste is light, refreshing with no pleasant notes. Mouth feel is refreshing. An easy drinking beer on a hot afternoon."
"I was pretty disappointed in this one. Its barely this side of an under-done macro. Pours a pale, clear yellow with above average effervescence. The head isnt worth much: thin turning to non-existence. Mild aromas: cereal grains, CO2, faint hops. It has very watery and muted tastes, similar to the aroma. In its defense, its easy to drink, and would probably be a good summertime lawn-mowing thirst-quencher. All in all, though, I wont be trying it again."
"Just didnt care for this one from them  did like the B&T ! Pour was OK but the aroma was missing. Taste was bland, no real flavor and something spunky about it. Not something I would go to get or have over a session. Had it on tap so I can't really blame it on a skunky bottle."
"The beer pours a pale gold color with a thick frothy white head that quickly fades to lacing. The aroma is decent. It's not very complex, but as far as adjunct lagers are concerned it has a ""premium"" aroma. It boasts of pale malts and lager yeast. It's light and mildly fruity. The taste is average. It has a very light and refreshing flavor, but it lacks in beer taste. It tastes really watered down. The mouthfeel is good. It is a low bodied beer with good carbonation. This is a good adjunct lager. It's not at all skunky or musty and it goes down quick. I like the aroma and the taste is better than most. This is a good drinker."
"Ah, it's ok. It's one of those beers to wash down pizza at a party. Or a lawnmower beer."
"Not a craft beer, but when you see it on tap, have a couple."
"Waiting in the bar area of a small restaurant outside Baltimore for a table to open (the place was reputed to have the best crab cakes, and it was worth the wait) - this was the only non A-B offering available. Pale straw to golden with tight carbonation streamers up the glass and a modest head. Aroma was a bit sweet, with some grain notes. Light flavor, with some sweet grain. Slipped into a bit of astringency toward the end, with a relatively clean finish. Solidly average (an oxymoron?)"
"Pours a pale amber with a foamy head that evaporates pretty quickly, leaving a very still-looking beer. Not much aroma - light hints of malt, adjunct, and a little bit of astringency. Palate is lightly malty, a touch of hops, and a light sweetness. Body is definitely more substantial than more American lagers. Goes down pretty easily, it's a good session beer. At its premium price, though, I'd rather drink Pabst and save the money."
"I truly enjoy their flagship Lager, so how do they justify the Premium labeling of this product? Oh well, back to the Lager."
"Yuenglings answer to BMC. Drunk straight from the can I have to dock this a point for appearance. The Aromas are of faint hops, and slight malts and they are more subdued from the can version of this brew. The Taste follows suit. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and crisp. Drinkability is decent for a macro. Not bad. Definately better in the bottle than in the can."
"Light gold color body with a thin foamy head. Smell was a little corny and bready. Light light malt aroma. Taste was of corn and citrus. A mellow tasting brew though the hops seem to jump out every other sip. A weird hopness to it. Kind of dry throughout. A little watery. Drinkable, but definitely not something I would go out looking for."
"Enjoyable."
"I usually really enjoy Yuengling products, but next time, I'm just buying empty bottles at my LHBS."
"A crystal-clear straw-gold body is topped by a good-sized head of creamy bright white foam. The retention is good, and although it drops in size rather quickly, it also maintains a thin surface covering for some time. Additionally, some nice lace is also present and adds greatly to the appearance. The nose is fresh and clean, delivering a straight-forward grainy malt and some minor yeast character. The body is light and crisp. The flavor is exactly as the aroma suggests with a lightly grainy malt, a very subtle background hop flavor, and an underlying bitterness. It finishes short and dry. There's not enough going on in the flavor to keep it interesting, but at least it's not as sweet as some of the mainstream macros available right now. At the very least, it's a refreshing, crisp and clean lager that's perfect for extended outdoor activities during hot summer days."
"You know, this is just another American lager, and as such is kinda thin and whimpy, but you can't argue with it very much wneh comparing it with the brethern. Light in color and taste, light head ... light light light. Easy drinking, a good beer to pass around on the street when those adhoc meetings with the neighbors occur. Too bad only a Pennsylvania distribution."
"Bought this in a quart bottle at the pizzaria around the block,what a waiste of $2.50.Poured a yellowish color with some head,not much smell out of this at all maybe a little breadlike?Taste was almost skunky,very bitter and nothing really stood out but the bitterness in my mind.I'll make sure not to make the mistake in buying this again."
"Spotted this one out at Chicken Chuck's been meaning to give the premium beer a whirl since I have had all of Yuengling's other products. Besides the bottle is a short stubby quart that just looks vintage and classic at the same time. The appearance of this beer is a golden yellow with a very bright white head decent head retention going on here. The aroma though is of faint malt sweetness along with semi harsh slighlty cooked vegetable tones mainly corn and rice. Very similar to other macros in appearance and aroma, but the taste is much better than most. Very clean and refreshing crispness that does of some malted barley somewhere and there no off flavors attempting to induce my gag reflex. So, all in all this beer aims for mediocrity and comes out a winner. This is nothing special just good ol' American light lager compares with Iron City to me. Lighter bodied beer designed to be drank on a hot summer day after mowing the lawn, I enjoy this beer for the time. I just can't picture wasting to much time with a beer of that's just alright.."
"The most horrible aspect of this beer is the aftertaste, it makes me crave a natty ice."
"This is a decent, clean tasting beer (I thought of rice when I was drinking this) and is a little bit better than those mass-produced fizzy yellow beers, but overall this beer isn't too exciting. I would stick with the Yuengling Traditional Lager over this."
"Pale straw in color with a very thin, quickly dissipating head. The aroma is grainy with a mild earthy hop aroma -- a bit musty. The flavor seems to be really affected by the use of corn, which detracts from the crispness of the flavor. More of a bitter character than most beers of this type, but still a bit uninteresting and off-putting, with a slightly soapy finish."
"In Pottsville and the surrounding communities, this beer is simply known as ""Premium."" It's been a staple for Yuengling and helped to maintain the brewery during the lean times before the Lager was reintroduced. For an American Lager, Premium isn't too bad. From the tap, this beer poured a translucent, pale yellow color, with a thin head that retained for only a few minutes. Faint floral hints and a strong maltiness defined the aroma. An immediate sweetness greeted the tongue upon tasting, and a hint of hops was also detected after swallowing. While I often drink this beer, upon reviewing it I was a bit surprised at how much the malt character actually overpowers the hops. Still, it had a good taste, and a decent mouthfeel. One of the beer's enduring qualities, however, is its drinkability. This is an excellent session beer, and whenever it's on tap and I'm planning on staying a while, I always request Premium. It's a great altermative to macros, and it never disappoints."
"For a buck a bottle everyday at the local college bar it can not be beat. I enjoy the premium more than the lager actually. Has a hoppy bite in it and mellow maltness to it. Color is slightly lighter than the lager but head and its retention is identical. Extremely drinkable as the flavors keep this beer from boring your palate after a few and a six pack wont fill up your stomach. Doesnt have that overpower sweet taste the lager does after one or two. This brew's mouthfeel isnt really anything special. The lager has a silkyness to it when swallowed. Thats the only characteristic that it is superior in though."
" I recomend this one its like beer flavored bud!"
"Pours a very clear-pale yellow, small white head, and some lace. Floral and malt aromas. Medium body and smooth mouthfeel, nice for a lager. Starts malt sweet, and then some hops to balance. Finishes slightly dry. Very good for an American Lager, decent among the rest. Very easy to drink, a good session brew."
"Pale lager, slightly stronger than your average ""quicky mart"" beers.  Flavor is more complex.  Godd drinkability with a slight sharp taste.  This is my baseline beer.   Once you drink this for a awhile, you can really tell where BudLight falls short.  Choose Yuengling instead."
"Not much going on here folks! Pours with the average white head over slightly pale-yellow liquid. Nose is a bit of sweet malt, with some adjuncty undertones. Taste is somewhat sweet at first, with a half-hearted hop flash, somewhat weak in body. Finishes with a quick dry note...seems it would appeal to the Bud drinker, but a bit bland and pedestrian on the palate."
"A good Yuengling product."
"This is in no way as good as their Traditional Lager.  Somewhat of a burnt malt taste with a very, tough to describe aftertaste.  Its reminiscent of soap (hey, when I was kid, if ya swore, they washed you mouth out with soap...I still remember that!!!)."
"I has a good balance of hops and malt, with a slight hint of the grain adjuncts used in the brewing.  Clear yellow, nice formed head with small packed bubbles.  Goes down easily and smoothly. Very drinkable."
"First off, I have to admit I'm not much of a lager fan, so I'm trying to rate this against the few lagers I have had. On every level, this seems like an average example: no better, but certainly no worse. Typical yellow, bubbly appearance, with a light white head that disappeared fairly quickly. Not much aroma, slightly malty. The taste is fairly bland, but refreshing, with a slightly nutty finish. If you're a lager fan, you won't go wrong here. If you're not, this won't convert you."
"Yuengling has always been a staple beer for me. I really love the Porter, Black & Tan, Traditional, and the Chesterfield as well. This has a good amount of hoppiness in the flavor and a mellow maltness to it. Color is slightly lighter than the traditional but head and its retention is identical. Although, I drink this the least out of Yuenglings line of brews, it still is a extremely drinkable brew."
"not bad. actually, pretty good."
"Thanks to my neighbor Sandra for the donation, and for bringing the Yuenglings all the way up from Philly."
