"I found this lager to be very well done, drank straight from the bottle it was clean, crisp with nice hop and cereal hints. Not heavy whatsoever, a beer i could certainly drink all night.  A great intro to Moosehead Lager, my new favorite beer!  I drank 8 bottles and woke up with no headache whatsover, which tells me that clean, natural ingredients are used by the brewery.  Highly recommended!"
"rated from previous tasting notes"
"I have had this once and it was the definition of a skunky beer. I can't speak for how this normally tastes, but what I had was definitely beer gone bad"
"Never had it, thought I'd try it, it's a beer."

"This shouldn't even be brewed."

"Gross canadian garbage tastes gross."
""
"I don't care what anyone says, this stuff is tasty, not expensive and has a great overall taste and feel...very refreshing on a hot day..."
""
"A good lager with a nice crisp finish"
"Good skunky beer. First few sips are a little much, but it tones down."
""
""
""
""
""
"As far as basic and inexpensive North American lagers go, this as close to perfect as you will find. At $9.99 a 12-pack, this is my go to beer."
""
""
""
""
"An easy drinking smooth lager. My go to bbq beer."
"Best go to beer in ontario if you're on a budget. Very drinkable and refreshing. Good balance and feel, never disappoints."
""
""
""
"smells awful, barest hint of foam on a clear body."
"Buy this when it is fresh, otherwise you will get some nasty beer. It's not a bad bbq beer"
""
"Tastes exactly like you would expect from the Canadians Yuengling. Its slightly more flavorful than Labatt's or Kokanee. Good Stuff"
"o: not a terrible macro lager, but not something to go back to"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Nothing special, but a solid beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a rock solid alternative to macro lagers. Proudly independent for as long as Canada has been a nation, Moosehead deserves a pat on the back and a Wiser's slow clap for sticking with a winning formula. This beer reminds me of Henry Weinhard's Blue Boar Ale and brings back great memories. In short, it's a nicely hopped lager that smells like a canoe cooler on a hot day. It's easy to down several of these in hurry - be forewarned!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I always liked Moosehead, although I haven't had one in years. Nice body, flavor balance, and finish make this a solid and easy to drink beer. Kind of sweetish finish. Clean, easy to like. Very respectable, but there are other brews more interesting these days. Definitely born of the 80's."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"So overall would I recommend it ? No, there is not enough for me to recommend it. It is not a easy drinking beer. A bit disappointed. There is something that this beer is missing. Even the Grolsch Premium Lager is much better than this one."

"faint skunk taste with heavy corn undertones"

"this is one of my dads favorite brews, so naturally I have consumed my share of it. my issue with it is the green bottle, so when it shows up in the states, even in the northeast, it often has that green bottle skunk to it, really frustrating because this can be quite nice when its fresh. the color is clear straw colored, richer than other yellow lagers, and although the head fades fast, its tall and bone white. the nose often has a skunk on it, but shows a pale and pils malt base that's quite light, and the cleanness of patient lagering. the flavor actually has some hops to it too, a lot more than other American takes on the style. its clean drinking beer, very refreshing and has a unique malt flavor that sets it apart from its peers. the handling and packaging of it are extremely problematic, but when once in awhile a fresh sixer is found, it can be tremendously refreshing. it is occasionally proof that cheap yellow beer can be delicious. orders of magnitude better than the BMC stuff here in the states, even at its worst."

"DATE REVIEWED: July 19, 2014... GLASSWARE: Warsteiner pokal... OCCASION: family visiting day completed...APPEARANCE: lively, effervescent body of pale yellow straw; thick, two-finger foamy head that creates surprisingly beautiful white lacing; wonderful cirrus clouds ring the glass... AROMA: heavy dough and biscuit; hops are slightly aromatic;, but more corny than floral; enough tin to suggest a metallic base... PALATE: medium-bodied, refreshingly swift in the aftertaste; a bit grassy and slightly beefy... TASTE: beefy, meaty malts are strong and dominate the profile; subtler flowers include metallic water hose and, to a lesser extent, honey... OVERALL: a college indulgence--just as step above the Natty Lights of the world--becomes a decent Saturday night lager; requires some attention while sipping..."

"Type: bottle poured into a pint glass. Pours a thin white head that disappears quickly.  Clear golden color. The taste is slightly hoppy. The mouthfeel is good as well. This is far from the best beer in the world, but it's good after a long hot day. I would drink it again if offered."

"An old favorite from my young man days. The beer is still pretty drinkable if unexciting. It borders on blandness but manages to deliver a modicum of flavor. Nope, it wouldn't be my first choice for a light lager beer, but depending on other options, Moosehead is still a fair consideration."

"A traditional mass produced Canadian beer. It pours light golden, with a faint aroma, and a medium white foamy head. It has a light lager taste, that leaves your palate dry and somewhat unquenched. It does have hints of cereal, wheat, and grassy flavors. They are easy to drink and filling, leaving you feeling kind of bloated. I was able to procure this beer at Feldman's Market in McAllen, Texas."

"O -- My first swallow reminded me of some of the regional premiums from my early beer days; Augsburger, Berghoff, even Andeker. This is a great ""lawnmower"" beer as they call them. Not offensive in any way, easy to gulp down, but just not that interesting that I'd want to drink it all night. In fact, the very grainy finish starts to fatigue after a while and I start to crave richer barley malt. Sorry Stahl, this doesn't stand up to the German imports I can get... even if they aren't independent."
""

"Nice and drinkable."
"Overall - A fine beer with that is an easy daily drinker. This used to be my beer of choice before I really started looking for new things. I thought then when i revisited it, I would rate it significantly lower. While this has occurred to a certain extent it still holds up over time, and isn't like to suffer the drop upon re-review that many AAL's will. A solid choice that is extremely accessible and superior to a lot of the macro beer available in Canada."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This beer is easy to drink and isn't overly malty or sweet. Although it came in a green bottle, no skunk is perceptible."

"This is the first I have tasted Moosehead Lager in over 20 years. It does bring back memories. I received a case for Christmas from my brother-in-law and decided to give it a test run tonight. I am not disappointed. I think it is much better than the big 3 lagers."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I was impressed by this beer which I foolishly assumed was similar to bud, etc.,. Wrong! This is a quality beer with all the flavor. It might just need some carapils for mouthfeel but does taste/smells great!! Must be made with a fine brewing process."
""
"Overall, I can't rate this too highly (I don't like Pale beers)."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This beer is perfect for my taste. It exceptional simple and clean, refreshing lager with some good beer taste to it. Moosehead beers beats out 99.99 lagers out on the market even European Lagers without the European Lager high price."
""
"A pale straw color with white lace, poured from a green bottle. This beer is a bit of a Canadian cult classic but I am only trying it now ... Happened to be a few kicking around at last night's house party and it was early enough in the evening to actually focus on the characteristics and produce an acceptable review. Aroma was fairly fresh sweet grains, some fruity citrus esters, maybe a hint of herbal hops. More pleasant than expected considering the green bottle. I did not get much skunk, presumably thanks to this example being fairly fresh and properly handled. Palate was a bit interesting. There was too much fizz, way too much, but there was also quite a bit of lemon zest, a little peach, a whiff of floral vanilla. A lot of esters for a lager and these added something to the pedestrian sweetish lager malt backbone. Hops are buried deep, not really tasting them at all. Finish was sweetish but reasonably clean. Few obvious faults although things were a tad medicinal and this combined with the aforementioned lemon notes made me think of cold medicine like Neo-Citran or something of that ilk. Still, surprisingly unskunky and with some fresh sweet character than would make me sample again, particularly if the other options are the adjunct lager standards that usually appear at parties (looking at you, Lucky Lager)."

"If I were to be honest about it the smell and taste rating should have been 0 but I've had the beer before and I know that it isn't really that bad."

"You get more than what you pay for, with this one. I do like this beer and I do think I'll have another!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I know Labatt and Molson are not upscale beers with wholesome flavors, but I think both are preferable to Moosehead Lager."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I buy macro two or three times a year tops, and Moosehead (along with Labatt 50 and Molson Stock Ale, plus the even better Moose Red) remains my swill of choice. Call me a sentimental Canadian, but I'd say this is worth trying at least once."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Moosehead is a solid beer for a warmer day. The beer poured a pale yellow with white head that left some lacing. The scent carried grain and faint alcohol. The taste was a decent balance between malt and bittering hops. The mouthfeel was lighter in body with good carbonation. Overall its ok and easy to drink."
""
"I grab a case of this from time to time, partly cause I'm a good Canadian like that, but also because it's just a simple, refreshing, but well made beer. This is one of the Canadian beers to start with if you're going to try our beer for the first time."
""
""
"Pours a clear gold with a foamy off-white head that settles to a partial film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace slowly drip into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, and sugary aromas. Taste is much the same with sweet grain flavors on the finish. There is a very mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is an average beer that is drinkable but nothing too exciting going on here."
""
"Moosehead has a phenomenal taste. Easily the best beer I've ever had. It has a very pleasing feel in your mouth and is good year round. The price is decent too. I have found it for around $11.99 for a 12 pack. If you don't like this beer then something is wrong with you."
" The taste is lackluster for me, malty entry with stale grain and slightly sweet cereal-like quality with low spice and mild creaminess with light smoothness of diacetyl and husky grainy taste as it finishes semi-dry. Overall I could probably find a better lager, maybe just a tad above most mass produced pale lagers...there is a mild herbal hop in this that I like"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I really can't understand how this beer consistently gets decent ratings. Every single one I've ever had from a bottle has been skunky. I cannot understand green bottles. I've had it on draft and its decent then but green bottles no thank you."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"D- For what it is, not bad. That said it is on the lacking side of taste and aroma."
""
""
""
"Out of the bottle the beer was your normal, everyday looking beer. It puts w thing but white and foamy head with no staying power. Smell was typical as well. Highly car instead with a watery taste not exactly what I was expecting. Overall, I scored it a little above average because of the distinct hint of sweetness to the beer. Not sure what it was but I liked it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Probably one of the better examples of the AAL style with slightly more flavor than I expected (and not quite as thin or watery as most). I remember as a child thinking that Moosehead was some kind of fancy import beer - man times have changed."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- this isn't my style, but its one if the better ones that I've had. It's very clean and there's not much too it. But the taste isn't off-puting like many others of the style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"this is a pretty lousy beer. don't know if it's cheap, but tastes like it should be around $3 a 6pk."

"O - Overall, a step above your average run of the mill mass produced beer. I actually like this more than any cheap beer that I have ever had. I would definitely get this again for a party"
"This is the best beer to drink any time of the year. It is a true go-to for any occasion. Great for the cottage or even when you're skiing. It is a very drinkable and refreshing lager. It has a great mix of hops and malts to provide a drinkable and tasty beverage. It is the true Canadian beer, owned and brewed by Canadians. And Canadians have been enjoying it since confederation."
"I pour 2 at a time into a big tumbler. I sprinkle a little sea-salt in for a bit of zest (and less trips to the toilet ...)"
"If you are looking for a good example of a golden lager, Moosehead fits the bill. Great golden coler with good foam retention on draft, this beer has a nice malty finish to go along with the lager taste. Fresh scent when first poured, the beer is best when served in an imperial pint glass. For pairings this beer does well with fresh seafood, as it comes from the east coast of Canada!"
""
"Because of the green bottle, it is very sensitive to light so in order to avoid it being light struck, protect it from light as much as possible. I enjoy it with a slice of lime as well."
""
"It's very smooth, but full bodied. Not over the top with hoppiness, much easier to drink. A perfect beer to have after a long day of work. It has a nice golden color and is very smooth on the way down. It is not a highly alcoholic drink, but as far as lagers go it does have a nice kick without being too much to enjoy. Overall it's an easy drinking lager with a full body and mouthfeel. A great beer."
"A comfortable lager beer, with a nice golden colour. Not too heavy and easy to drink. Has more of the actual beer taste I am after when I drink a non amber lager. I find Moosehead Lager to be quite refreshing, and I am glad to see that it uses 100% Canadian Barley Malt. I also like the fact that this brand is still Canadian owned, and privately operated."
""
"The green bottle certainly distinguishes this iconic Canadian brand apart from it's competition. Best served chilled- resulting in a crisp lager taste with a nice, soft clean finish. Great summer time beer, particularly when grilling lighter cuisine. Highly drinkable!"
"Have been enjoying Moosehead for years. Very happy when it came out in a Light version. I find it flavorful, no after taste and it smells good. Make sure it is REALLY cold. Goes great with everything especially steak. Mix it with Clamato juice 50/50 fry up some hashbrowns, eggs and steak or ham and you have an awesome saturday morning breakfast."
"A classic style lager with a hint of the noble hallertau hop, rich mouth feel and refreshing taste. Golden staw colour with a creamy white froth. Finishes slightly sweet with very little aftertaste, the bottom of the pint has you craving for the next pint."
""
"I bought a 12 pack for a party I was hosting, hoping my friends would be as nostalgic as I was and enjoy pounding these beers and thinking about when we first had them in the mid-80’s; they were a hit and most were downed except this one used for the review. The taste is always average, but it’s a solid beer and a classic lager that is always enjoyable."

"O - Aside from the skunky nose this beer isn't too bad. Ive had worse in the style. I wouldn't recommend it but you could do worse."
""
""
"I thought the beer would be kinda harsh. Actually this is one of my favorites now. It really is a refreshing lager. Be perfect for the summer doing yard work. Overall a real good beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"One of my all-time favorites. You would expect to be overwhelmed by the smell, but the first drink is just as refreshing as the last. a mid-yellow in color, this beer has a strong scent of hops but the taste is not that strong. You expect it to be somewhat harsh, but this beer is so smoothe that there is no harshness found. Very balanced in elements, I wouldn't classify this as sweet or dry, bitter or bland, this beer is just downright smoothe. Best just sitting on the couch and relaxing."

""
""
"o: this is my first experience with Moosehead and I am not disappointed because it's great for what I got it for -- sipping while doing some yardwork in the 85 degree Alabama spring. This is a very good, albeit somewhat light, lager. 3/5"
"O - classic lager flavours, though still rather mild, nothing spectacular, but easily drinkable"
""
""
""
""

"Moosehead lager is my favorite canadian beer and one of my top lager choices. I consider it to be an adjunct since I believe corn is used in the recipe but not sure. Moosehead's bottling means 6 packs are prone to skunkiness, therefore stick with 12 packs. It is brewed only 150 miles away so it always seems fresh and enjoyable here. Appearance is golden with limited head that fades away. The smell is hoppy with floral overtones, some malt/grain. The taste has a very nice blend of distinct hop bite and crisp lager flavor. Mouthfeel is crisp and refreshing, very drinkable. Mooshead seems to be the only canadian brewer that still tastes like I remember from 20 years ago."
""
""
""
""
"overall - 4/5 - I had little expectations for this beer, but was surprised to find it somewhat refreshing and while not my style, certainly workable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This beer to me is good for what it is style wise, it is crisp clean and refreshing. It is certainly one that you could session all night long and not get sick of the flavor. It has just enough to it it going on that it is enjoyable to me as compared to many regular adjunct lagers that I find to be extremely undrinkable. Is it complex no but it is it refreshing and drinkable yes, could take place as occasional go to when looking for easy drinking lager."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"From the 12 fl. oz. bottle marked GO411-12:15. Sampled on February 27, 2012. Too bad I can only get it in the green bottle in my area because it inevitably comes off as skunked. The pour is pale to golden yellow with a fizzy white head. Trying to block the skunkiness out of my mind I can get a solid malty scent on the nose and some crisp clean but vague hop esthers. The body is light to medium and average for the style. The taste also has a creamy, maltiness to it with a bitter hop bite playing tag on the end. In the 1980's this was a beer I drank quite often. Times and tastes change but it still is a halfway decent Canadian pale lager on occasion."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A decent beer that really just tastes like an above average AAL. Corny and refreshing."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured a 2"" white soap suds head, fading pretty fast. The color is standard BMC clear straw yellow and continues post-pour with a decent amount of effervescence. It smells like grass and corn. Taste is against standard BMC but it's decent. There's not much of a finish. Yes, a thoroughly average and boring mainstream beer, but there's nothing actually wrong with it. You could substitute for any BMC."
"this used to be my go to canadian lager. it is better than canadian, blue, and other macro canadian lagers. however, after expanding my lager horizons so to speak, Sam Adams Boston Lager is significantly better and costs only slightly more. suprisingly, Pabst Blue Ribbon is slightly better costs significantly less."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I'd say that it is a middle-of-the-road, ""go-to"" beer if you are unsure at a bar."
""
""
"Drink- Well my boss tried. I dont work with beer drinkers so I got stuck with this one. Wont be coming back to it."
""
""
""
"O/D-Another lager that came at a good deal. A good beer for someone who's looking to get drunk and doesn't want to go down the Bud Light path."
""
""
""
""
"I will have to say, Moosehead beer has always been one of my favorites. I usually drink dark beers, but Moosehead can hold it's own. Don't let its lite complexion detour you. Mooshead is full of flavor. It has the strong American Lager taste with a hint of a Philsner after taste. Very smooth with little bite. The Canadians did something right when the made this brew. Pour a little on you steak as you grill. The philsner taste will give your ribeye the extra edge you have been looking for. Either way, I always figured it was better to drink Moosehead, than it is to give it."

"A pleasant, inexpensive surprise. For its price this is a very good lager. My first impression was of a lighter German style beer, maybe edging toward Reinheitsgebot varieties. I assume it competes with Rolling Rock, and for my money, has a bit more character and flavor per $. Overall, I think it is a crisp, refreshing brew, and I would wholeheartedly recommend it as a beer to go with a weeknight dinner."
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Overall the beer is kinda flat, has some grassy and nutty flavors that entwine with a very light weight, light colored lager."

"O: In my opinion, vastly superior to its main Canadian competitors. Great beer if you need something to go the distance with on a long winter night of hockey watching and hot tubbing. Simple, yet hard to get sick of."
"Pours a fizzy straw yellow, light haze, quick plume of head, gone quickly. Scent is pale with a hint of lightly sweet malt. Taste again is light and pale with some splashes of clean malt and fresh grain... the best thing this brew has going for it is no off notes. Light bodied, bubbly, clean and crisp. A decent alternative to the BMCs of the world."
"O: Not the worst lager, but it's meh... I'm not a fan of the skunk that follows into the mouth. I don't have much to say, but it's not something to yearn for."
"O: I generally don't care for beers of this style, but I do have a big soft spot for Moosehead. It's cheap, readily available, and consistently solid. It won't blow you away, but honestly are you expecting it to? Quite good for what it is."
"Overall – I think I prefer this beer out of the bottle. I've had it out of a can recently and it seemed to have a little more taste from the bottle. Probably just my imagination. Anyways, at the end of the day this is still just another drinkable but forgettable lager."
"O: a good pale lager, one of the better ones, but not world changing."
"Not A+ material, but very respectable for its price. It's very easy going down and very crisp and refreshing. Does not leave a strong after taste or skunky flavour. I'm happy I tried this beer and I'll be buying it again! The lack of bite after swallowing it is the part that I enjoy the most!"
"Very drinkable but void of any real flavor."
"I had this for the first time in Canada, on tap. I really enjoyed it, given the style. I wish it was available on tap at more bars. Also, I wish it was more widely available in cans."
"This beer is my favorite by far. For only $8 for a 12 pk of bottles you can not go wrong. The taste is very crisp and refreshing. No skunky or bitter after taste and just all around, in my opinion, the best beer. I am sure many will not agree with me on this and i respect that. But this is just my opinion."
"The beer poured out as a clear golden color with a thin fizzy head on it. There is no lacing on brew. The smell of grains a malts on the nose with the slight hop aroma in there. The taste of the beer is crisp and had a sharp hop character to it with some sweet grainy malts in there too. The mouthfeel is clean and Simple. Overall, like I said before, if I had to pick a lager to drink for the rest of my life this would probably be in the top 5."
"Pale straw yellow colour with an airy white head that struggles and quickly fails to cling to the sides of the glass. Typical BMC lager smell, sweet and grainy, with a subtle hint of wet cardboard. Crisp and clean, but it's a struggle to point out actual flavours in the beer. Some sweet grainy malt with little to no hop flavour or bitterness. Thin body and highly carbed. Very easy drinking, it's no surprise this was one of my go-to's when I first became of age. Not all that pleasant but not offensive, it seems like a great option for my 19 year old self!"
"A very good lager for what it is. The appearance and smell are similar to any American/Canadian lager - nothing special. The taste is actually quite crisp and refreshing. Whether it be the winter or summer, I can always go back to this beer and be satisfied when finished. A simple beer from start to finish, but a delicious beer that hits the spot nonetheless."
"O: This is definitely my favourite Canadian macro lager, it’s on par with others in appearance, smell, and mouthfeel but it has a much better, more distinctive taste."
"Final Grade: 3.25, a C+."
"Overall, I buy cases of this stuff, and for about $1/beer like it is here in Pennsylvania, I say its a fair price for the quality of beer you get."
"Pours a clear straw color with a small, white head that fizzles out rather quickly. Not much in the smell other than skunk and some light malts. About the same in the taste: stale malts and lots of skunk. Fizzy and weak, light bodied, and none to drinkable. Please avoid."
"Prost!!!"
"O: Nothing remarkable, but a good alternative to your standard macrobrew."
"Light, refreshing, well carbonated. A pretty good offering from a major"
"O- Awesome cookout beer. Great change from BMC garbage. Oh, Canada, you make some great beer."
"M - pleasant and drinkable. Refreshing when cold. Good summer and hot-time beer; worthy of being a house staple or for making radler."
"Overall: Definitely an enjoyable beer. Better than Labatt, not quite as good as Molson."
"O: Average drinking if you get one that is not too badly skunked. Always a crap shoot with this beer, it seems."
"D- A much better option to BMC, I'll pick it up again to have some on stand by for a barbecue or when company comes over."
"Good clean taste and very refreshing. Making this my common beer."
"Cheers!"
"I hate to see bad reviews for this. Its obviously better than Stella Artois. So the smell aint' the best, you're drinking a lager, not much characteristics in them despite what people say. This and Molson taste way better than what most people by for the fridge or a gathering. Personally I like ales for session, but i have no problem making this a go-to lager. Give it a try, you won't be sorry."
"I thoroughly enjoyed this beer. I regularly buy the twelve packs because they are cheap and sometimes they have collectible bottle openers. This beer is your standard light and very drinkable beer. It is overcarbonated and doesn't have a whole lot of taste. It is extremely refreshing and crisp."
"Not one of my favorites, there are many other Lagers that are very more interesting than this one."
"From notes: Pours a light straw color, high carbonation, small white head that goes to nothing but a ring....slight grassy hop smells mingled with sweet boiled grains....sharp start, medium-light body with a clean balanced finish. Better balanced in malt sweetness and hop astringency than most commercial lagers....but still average."
"Drinkability: It's a very smooth drinkable beer accompanied with bland flavours and aromas. It's definitly a good summer beer."
"D - One of my least favorite macro-Canadian beers. If the taste and odor weren't so below average, I could down a case in a heartbeart. If you want good Canadian macro, check out, Labatt and Molson."
"for me this might me my go to beer for my non craft beer drinking friends."
"It's not too bad of a beer. If not for the smell, I'd probably really like it."
"Overall, this is a pretty generic beer to me. I enjoyed the six pack I purchased and actually think it tastes better straight from the bottle. I actually liked its over carbonation, it at least made it a little different from other beers."
"Supremely skunky brew. More flavor than Bud or Coors. Maybe skunkier because I'm down here in Texas, I like that though. I think this is darn good beer. Crisp and very enjoyable to drink, nice labeling, attractive green bottle. It reminds me of something- I think Mickey's Malt Liquor lol, maybe not. Just bought a six pack and this is the first Moosehead I've ever drank. Six packs are the dumbest invention- beer should not be sold in packaging of less than 12."
"-Bye"
"Nice and light golden color to the pour with a whispy, thin head that somehow managed to hang around for quite some time with minimal lacing. Lots of stray carbs running up to the top of the brew, seeking escape. It has a very sweet, malty, and rag weedish aroma to it, sort of skunky, but in a good way. There could be some faint hop aromas amidst the rag weed, but it is hard to differentiate. This beer smells like what I considered beer to smell like growing up as a young lad. As for the taste, the base malt profile slams your palate at first, with a slightly sweet,tangy and bready barrage to the tastebuds, followed by a hint of citrus, although very faint. As the brew makes its way down, there is a slight, short-lived hop bitterness, quickly followed by an immense amount of carbonation that brings a moderate burn to the back of the throat, with a sweet aftertaste to mellow things out. With that being said, this is a great session beer when you are looking for something with a little more body and character than your average go to cheap brew, not too much going on overall, but a solid lager in my opinion."
"Crystal clear straw yellow with a fizzy white cap that disappeared quickly. Floral, sulfury hop aroma with some sweet cereal grains. Low bitterness, a bit lemony in flavour with mild malt sweetness, acidic, slightly spicy. The carbonation was coarse, partly due to the light body, on the dry side. Overall though, not bad compared to other national brands."
"RJT"
"On tap at Mike's rehearsal dinner, poured into a pint glass...Piss colored with very little carbonation...The aroma and taste are both skunk, and lots of it. I can pull a little grain and corn, but nothing good. I try to drink this and I could only drink about half of this. This is not very good or worth trying."
"After all is said and done, my opinion of this beer remains favorable. It withstood an honest beer review and will remain a mainstay in my fridge. It really has no flaws, unlike several beers of it's genre. Excellent for sessioning, slamming, or enjoying. Easily available and modestly priced, this really is a decent beer."
"d- probably my favorite adjunt lager if that means anything, perfect for getting hammered"
"Overall, this is a clean and simple beer. It lacks anything inherently complex, but then again, it is undoubtedly designed to be a straightforward, laid back brew."
"As to be expected, this beer pours yellow with a white head, retention cold be better though. Still a nice film remains throughout the drink with ok lacing. Smells of malts and some citrus hops, both are pretty neutral and compliment each other. Before I was as educated on beer styles, to me this was like a high quality Labatt. The malts try to be sweet but the hops keep them down a bit in a good, not overpowering way. There is a definate crisp, bitterness in the finish of this beer that I have grown to love. A perfect beer for camping and fishing in Canada and this one is dear to me. In general, I dislike this style of beer but I can make an exception for Moosehead, well done."
"better then most big Canadian beers but that's not saying much"
"This lager produced a half finger head which faded quickly to a island of light covering and slight lacing. Rating a 5 on the SRM chart, this beer is crystal clear with small bubble action. Smell is a light aroma of corn, and wheat with a hint of lime peel. Sort of a straw and corn taste with a light hop finish, nothing special, but not a bad assault on my taste buds. Suitable feeling of fullness and smoothness in my mouth, but just a little bite on the back of my upper palate. This lager goes down well enough to have a six at an yard event, but I would go past it to buy some better on the local beer aisle."
"I rank this beer with Beck's and Carlsberg: skunky. This is a very good version of that style flavor. Though Moosehead seems not to be highly favored here, neither is it disliked overall. I think it's a good drinkable beer that looks and smells nice. It tastes just fine, so long as you know it has a little funky kick to it. I've always liked it - a good thirst quencher."
"Overall Average Beer, Decent head with strong lacing and heavy carbonation. a little bit too much for my liking. kinda tasting alcohol and some sort of sour hop taste.maybe a bit of lemon? I feel like theres nothing overly special about this beer. carbonation very heavy. looks good but tastes pretty average."
"D - Overall this is an average lager nothing special but easy to drink while watching football on a Sunday afternoon"
"D: Pretty low ABV & refreshing make it pretty damn drinkable, but.... There are other beers out the very much like this.... Not a bad little beer, been years since I had it..."
"Final Thoughts: Would reccommend. For a ""green bottle"" beer this is one of the best I've had. In comparison to other lagers I've had, this ranks more positively than not."
"Of the Canadian macros, this is one of the best. It's fairly flavorful, and easy drinking."
"D: Although not the most enjoyable or exciting lager, I suppose it is fairly drinkable."
"I like this beer, and would probably recommend it based on the name alone...however, it's not going to be on any top-ten lists for me any time soon. Just so-so."
"Poured into a beer glass fairly stiffly. Clear and straw yellow with no head, just the fizzy stuff you expect from a macro such as this and wait, what's that? LACING? On a macro? Nice. Aromas are corn and a bit of vegetal, while the body is thin and watery with a bit of corn and bread flavour that lingers decently. The taste really surprises me as having something more than I would have otherwise expected... Finishes cleanly, a nice drinkable macro lager."
"Usual mouthfeel for the style but it's a pretty darned drinkable drop. For me, occasional use isn't out of the question."
"Cheers!"
"Overall another in a long line of not very goo beers that I tried over the last week."
"D-Sky high. Its very refreshing and clean. There is not much to this beer but it is beloved by me. Affordable and simple. Best thing to come out of Canada? I say yay. I 100% agree with GNR4life2 on the Chesterfield similarities."
"Value: Surprised to see the mant harsh reviews on Moosehead Lager on here. I mean, if you're expecting the best beer you've ever had, you should plan on spending more than ten bucks for a 12 pack. For the money, it's tough to beat."
"Tastes dry, grassy, & earthy, but clean nonetheless. A very mild feel to the brew. It offers a clean & inoffensive finish or aftertaste. While it doesn't force me to scream in utter praise, there's not much to complain about. Moosehead Lager is a very balanced traditional American Pale Lager."
"Semi-sweet grains make up the flavor profile. Some slight honey-sweetness followed by lemon zest. Low-to-absent bitterness. Not a bad Pale Lager at all. I could have a few of these (and did for that matter), but it's just nothing noteworthy. Better than macro offerings, but better lighter beers out there for sure."
"Poured a straw yellow with surprisingly good head. No head retention or lacing whatsoever though. Smell has a faint grassy note to it, without much else. Taste is almost as muted, but it isn't bad or off. Slight bitterness and malt. Just a standard macro style lager that isn't offensive or bad. Carbonation was a bit prickly, which hurts the mouthfeel and drinkability, but I did finish off a pitcher so it wasn't un-drinkable."
"A very, very bitter beer. In order to drink Moosehead, it has to be theonly beer available at the time. This to me is one of the most overrated beers I have ever encountered and is so plain and average, you might just fall asleep before the end of the beer. Not the worst beer ever, but definitely nothing to write home about"
"D- An okay beer.Pick Up Lord Chesterfield ale for a cheaper price plus a higher alcohol content. ;)"
"I got a finger of bubbling bone-white head that fizzled out like a cheap piece of fireworks off of my pour. Color was a light sunshine-yellow with NE-quality clarity. Nose had a very characteristic lager sweetness. It was a welcome change from its adjunct-laden counterparts as well as a nice contrast to my buddy's skunked green bottles in 1986/'87, a smell that still haunts me. Mouthfeel was medium with a pleasant lager sweetness on the tongue. It was definitely NOT skunked, making another solid case for beer in a CAN, vice out of a green bottle. Finish was smooth, slightly sweet, definitely drinkable. This is definitely cooler-worthy."
"Drinkability: A fantastic session beer. Goes down super easily and crisply making it a pretty cheap and unbeatable staple."
"This is good beer by any standards you could measure it in its price range and its macro-import class. It is crisp and bright flavor-wise and demonstrates the brewery's ability to construct a very good beer with what must be assumed to be somewhat low cost ingredients, judging by the price ($8.99 for 12 bottles at Foremost in Chicago). Either that, or they are selling this stuff too cheap. It definitely stands up to beers in a higher price range, and is much better than other Canadian beers like Molson and Labatt's. The color is pale, the carbonation is fine, and the flavor is full without any bitterness or astringency. It's clean with a very slight citrus flavor and rich grain throughout. This is a perfect ""chugger"" if you're really in the mood for 3-4 good tasting beers in rapid succession. This would go down smooth any time and I can't think of any reason not to recommend it as a straightforward, high quality medium lager. Light the campfire and pull out the iced Moosehead and you will have pure enjoyment. The reputation as ""skunk"" beer is received wisdom and repeated without really tasting this beer."
"D: Can't say I enjoyed this lager much."
"While not as bad in flavor or aroma as the bottles I've had, it's still not very good."
"Moosehead Breweries Limited, Saint John, New Brunswick, Canada--Moosehead Lager--2004 12 oz. Bottle. 5.00% ABV. 20 IBU's? (3.75 / 5.0) Pale Lager. Mild lace fizzy white head. Clear bright thin yellow color. Mild crisp grassy hop front. Smooth all malt crisp mild butter Pale caramel body. Mild zest tangy hint hop spice very refreshing end. Nice Macro. Sampled 4/18/2007."
"Moosehead is the largest and oldest independant brewery in Canada"
"Mouthfeel is light bodied with a medium amount of carbonation."
"Clean and balanced."
"Notes: This is a nice drinkable lager. It is better than other comparable beers like Molson Golden."
"D: Well, it's easy to swallow, even though it's honestly not that refreshing. Overall, definitely not one of the ""best beers of the world"" -- far from it, I'd say. The only thing distinctly Canadian about this one is that it has ""Moose"" in it's name."
"D - You could do worse for a standard chug-a-chug lager, but I'd pick Labatt's over this any day, not to mention that, like any other ""American pale lager"" that's not actually brewed in the United States, they've got us beat at our own game. Its still a pretty wimpy brew though."
"Back in college, Moosehead was one of my first steps out of BMC. I haven't had it in a while but it seemed right to have one while in Canada. It's pretty good for what it is; a reliable thirst quenching session beer."
"The Moose is Loose!"
"The CANquest is spreading!"
"This is one of the best lager Ive had, even tho I am not a big lager fan! This is better than molson, has better taste, color! It is more refreshing as well! I hope recommend this lager to a friend, if there was nothing else on tap macrobrews. Cheers!"
" I still like it. It's got a taste that I like. Will buy it again."
"This beer pours a pale straw colour. However, that is the only really decent quality about the beer. Due to it being in a glass bottle, skunk cabbage reins throughout with some corn and rice rounding it out. Mouthfeel is somewhat watery, and I regret having purchased a twelver of this shit. This is just plain not a worthy beer."
"The Moose is loose in the wild Manitoba snows."
"The beer goes down smoothly, the taste doesn't linger, feels good and tastes what you'd expect from a lager."
"Botlle 341ml. Light gold, very skunky aroma and smoked grain. Taste is standard lager, light lemon a little sweet. Light but Sticky palate. An horrible interlude in somewhat a perfect christmas tasting ... nothing much to say concerning this standard macro beer."
"Taste: The skunk isn't as noticeable in the taste, thankfully. Skunk aside this is a pretty decent pale lager. Perhaps a little too sweet for my liking, though."
"Refreshing, crisp, and very drinkable. Drinks like a light Lager, almost like a cheap end Pilsner, but better. Good taste, and the ability to get you drunk quick if you don't watch out, due to it's easy consumption. A good beer to have around for tail-gating, barbecues, and with heavy foods. I liked this beer, it wasn't to bad."
"D: You get drunk very quickly, was the official beer of my group of friends."
"Taste, thin, but not offensive, decent hop zest, but nothing to write home about. Better than most mass produced lagers. Mouthfeel, eh, not much to savor, but again, it isn't offensive. It's drinkable for sure, and it will get better. Pair with hot food, barbecue."
"Long story short, you could drink plenty of worse things than this. It's fairly agreeable (fresher might help) and unobtrusive. Hence macro."
"Tried to twist this one off and had no luck, gotta get out the bottle opener. Received this one from a friend randomly around Xmas time, hope its not skunked (green and clear bottles are risky). Here goes nothing. Does not smell skunked, smells just like an American adjunct initially. Pours out about as clear as a beer could get. The only thing keeping it from being water colored is a faint yellow, almost golden tint. The pale white head actually has pretty good retention making this a decent looking beer. The only bad part is how unappetizing the pale yellow color looks. Medium lacing starts to be left as the head dies down. I really can't bash the appearance of this beer at all. Next comes smell. This beer just smells like Coors, Bud Light, Corona etc. I can't even describe the smell it is so strange, that of any cheap adjunct lager. Maybe just a bit lemony and malty, hard to describe but everyone that has had a cheap beer knows the smell. I do not enjoy this smell at all. It does follow the style/goal pretty well and I have to give it some credit for that. Taste brings me back to my very old college days, before Sam Adams and Sierra Nevada came into play. This one reminds me of a sweeter Coors with a tiny hint of citrus. The sweetness is hard to adjust to even on the first sips. Still, just a pretty common taste for a cheap lager. I have had worse and this one still follows the styles ways so I have to give it some credit on taste. The malt lingers around in the after taste. Mouthfeel actually surprised me a bit on this one. The carbonation is not overdone like some lagers of this sort and the body is relatively creamy and enjoyable. It goes down pretty smooth and feels pretty good on the tongue (taste not included). I am certainly not gonna lie, the mouthfeel is better than some beers I have had that were 2-3x the price of this. Drinkability is hard to describe. The beer is cheap and not filling at all. If I was given a ton of these to session, I probably would do it since I can block out bad tasting beer pretty well. I definitely would not buy one of these to do that though. I would say the DB is right down the middle. It could be very sessionable but I would not choose to do so."
"I poured this just average stinking beer into my tumbler at 50 degrees. The beer was a light pale color with a nice white frothy head. However that went away very soon. It did have decent lacing like that means a lot. The smell was skunky and green. The taste was slightly sweet candy yuk. though the beer was refreshing it is not a great beer and I will not buy again as I hate smelling skunk when getting drunk."
"D: it'll do; just right for the occasion"
"It is an average lager with a light mouth feel and very good drinkability - an easy session beer. I have recently switched to this from Coors as my everyday beer to supplement the micros in the fridge."
"Had this on tap at a few bars, and in bottle. Pours a typical golden clear pale colour with a little bit of foam. Well it doesn't taste as shitty as the other canadian macro brews and you might as well throw in the main american macro brews as well. Its still pretty damn average at best though. It just has that flat taste to it, but I had no other options lastnight. Not sure what else I can say about this."
"A beer that I have not had in close to 20 years. On sale at a local store. Pours a pale yellow color with a large white head that had decent retention. Quite a bit of lacing is left on the glass. Starts of with a bit of grassy and spicey hop aroma but that settles down and graininess comes through. Actually smells nice. The flavor is on the sweeter side of things but not too sweet. I like my beers on the dry side but I can tolerate this lager. Some noble hop flavor but mostly malt. Bitterness is low. Light body but overlycarbonated. This is a fine pale lager. Came with a bottle opener in the 12 pack so that was a bonus."
"D - This isn't a bad beer. It's not strong, but it's not watery, and the aftertaste isn't entirely unpleasant. I could imagine having a couple of these outside with some friends in the summer, and I'd have one if they were being chilled at a party, and for the price I might pick it up as a session/party beer if I'm bored with Yuengling. Good, but nothing new."
":)"
"Operative term for this beer is humble: nothing bold or particularly flavorful, sort of an agreeable grain flavored seltzer. Certainly easy enough to put away and lacking in obvious flaws; it's the lack of assertiveness that ultimately relegates this beer to the ""boring"" section."
"From experience this beer seems to get skunky real quick when in bottles but even from a can it's not too impressive. It's just an average brew. There's better Canadian Lagers out there than this."
"D: i preffer this over adjunct lager any day of the week"
"Overall not a good lager with no hop presence and lacking in any positive taste."
"Drinkability: An acceptable, easily drinkable lager that, forgiving the minor skunkiness, is just a hair more distinctive than the rest of the macro lagers out there."
"This beer pours a clear pale straw color. The head is half an inch in height, and recedes into light lacing. The aroma is of faint bready malt with a hint of sweet corn. The taste is rather lively for the style, but very simple overall. There is a nice bready malt taste, and not much else. The mouthfeel is light bodied with moderate carbonation. Overall, this is a decent beer. It is very inoffensive, but has some flavor. I have ordered this beer in bars numerous time when there wasn't anything better, and I can see myself doing so again in the future."
"I know Moosehead is revered for being the last of the Canadian ownership holdouts among macro brewers, but their flagship beer is nothing that I would seek out - it's barely more palatable than the adjunct-laden offerings of their bigger competitors."
"D - I hate these types of beers because they offer nothing besides drinkability. Sure it's not offensive but its only good for one thing: mass consumption. Good flavor is totally absent."
"Poured from a green bottle into a weizen glass. Has a gold color with a 1/2 inch head. Mild smell, slightly skunky. Taste is crisp but not overly flavorfull. Feels somewhat watery in the mouth. Drinkability is decent. Overall a slightly above average beer."
"UGH. What do I do with the other 22?"
"This is one of the best beers of its mass-produced type."
"Drinkability is good. This is very light and refreshing. Nice beer for a macro; it isn't an interesting beer but would probably make a great session beer on a hot day."
"Very easy to drink. This is probably one of the better American Lagers I've had. Very refreshing."
"Moosehead has long been one of my favorite all-purpose beers. It's very malty, with a substantial feel in my mouth. A bit of a mild aftertaste, and only the slightest bit of hop bitterness. Easy drinking, but it does start to fill you up after a while; I don't think I'd want to pound it all day. If you haven't tried Moosehead, I'd highly recommend - if nothing else, I'd be hard pressed to find anything objectionable about it unless you're a die-hard flavorphobic Coors Light fanatic."
"D - due to the lack of mouthfell and little taste these can cruise down."
"Overall there is absolutely no reason to buy this beer."
"Drinkability I can finish what I have left but wont be buying it again"
"Salutations"
"This doesn't drink too badly but it gets warm quickly. Not for savoring."
"I picked up a six pack (on sale!) to commemorate the Chicago Blackhawks' ascension to the post season ranks. Why not get blitzed with some good 'ol Canadian beer? As is custom, I had to write a review for at least one of these, so here I am. This beer isn't anything special, but it's a good brew at a (relatively) cheap price. I would recommend drinking it with some kind of BBQ and/or during a hockey game! It's not something that I would go out of my way to get on a regular basis, but it's worth having every now and then."
"Overall a good beer, happy that i made the purchase it. good beer for its price."
"How could I turn down having the good ole moose. Somehow between the thinner yellow color and even thinner taste, I didn't manage to pour this one out. Its not totally offensive as say for instance Busch Light. Its bland, but not skunked. It's what we call a lawnmower beer when all other lawnmower beers have been exhausted."
"Nice beer for a thirst quencher on a summer's day."
"pours light gold in color with a quickly fading white head and thin fading lace. smells of fresh cut grass and corn. taste is fresh and clean with no funky after taste your its your basic lager only brewed in canada. mouthfeel and carbonation both are good. not much else to say on the plus side other than it would be ok for something quick and cold on a hot summer day."
"Drinkability - same comments. Many nights have been spent pounding back numerous of these. How can it not be a 5 for me?"
"My dad calls it ""moose piss"" and now I get why. PBR is a better all around beer in my opinion."
"Drinkability: If you like sugar water, you will probably like Moosehead"
"This is pizza swill (or in this case, Thai). I suppose that an icy bucket of these on a hot day would hit the spot (and I remember buying this by the case when I was in my 20's, so more than a few of these were tipped by me after a hot day at work). Not exactly the sipper -- just not enough complexity here. Still, not a horrific effort."
"It is drinkable in the same way water is drinkable. I'd drink it again only if it was free."
"Golden straw in color, beer looks lifeless, no head and minimal carbonation. I can't smell anything from this beer, I'll give it a 2.0 since I guess it's better to smell nothing then to smell something bad. Taste is what I expected from this style. Mild maltiness and then some grains and mild hop finish. Easy to drink but similar to water in mouthfeel. I wouldn't recommend this unless you like beer that is odorless and minimal in flavor."
"Moosehead Lager is a pretty decent Canadian lager. There isn't anything particularly noteworthy about it, just kind of an average lager. It has a bit of a skunky taste, not unlike Heineken, but once you get used to that, it's actually kind of refreshing. The smell isn't all that wonderful, so I don't recommend pouring it into a glass. But straight from the bottle, Moosehead Lager is an alright beer."
"Drinkability: It's an ideal drinking brew for all you kids out there. The perfect bottle beer. After seven or eight Don Cherry might look chic."
"Final Thoughts - For the most part, this beer is slightly above average. It's nothing worthy going out of your way for, but it's also not a bad choice. Really, I find myself drinking this beer because I don't have a more interesting option and I feel it's certainly a step up from the standard macro offerings."
"it's been 5 years since i've had this paticular beer, and i know the reason it has been so long this beer is not good it has less taste than most of the macro beers i've had, it probably would go good with a funnel. it also had kind of a skunky smell, probably due to the green bottle or the age of the beer"
"Very easy drinking, possibly ok for beach/bbq, if you can get over how watery this is."
"Yeesh! Maybe good for a fishing trip when it's cold enough that your lips don't taste much, but not good for here on the sofa."
"Overall: Moosehead!"
"Overall: Not very good beer, but better than some I have had. I will definately never have this one again."
" D: I find this beer very easy to drink i take it to the dirt track races in the summer, (no bottles allowed) and always find myself with a empty coloer on the way out"
"Mouth: Surprising heft of flavor. Not as watery as your average pale lager. Lightly toasted cereal grains with a touch of adjunct sweetness. Inoffensive. Semidry, sort of slimy and astringent on the palate. High drinkability, low desirability."
"Comments: This is better then expected and the taste is better then the smell but still not great."
"D - If it were really hot and I was really thirsty.... sure. But I am neither so not really."
"D - Very drinkable. Something I will definitely have again."
"Pours a clear, pale yellow. Good 1/2 inch head of a white color. Slight retention and slight lacing. Smells of a Euro Lager, lots of yeast. Fits the style. Smooth, crisp, and low carbonation. Low malt flavor along with the lager taste. Doesn't really taste clearly of adjuncts. Also, an associated skunk aroma and taste but not very strong. If this skunk flavor wasn't there, the beer would be pretty darn good, oh well."
"Drinkability: Honestly, am I drinking beer or sparkling water? Better than most macros but still nothing good."
"A decent lager, always a better choice than Budweiser. Pours clear gold, white head. Sweet, grassy aroma with pale malt. Sweeter tasting, smoother, with an okay finish. This beer will easily skunk. If so, the taste will stay with you for a while. Similar to the taste you will have the next morning with that ringing hangover."
"Drinkability: Refreshing and not too bad, but nothing I would buy normally. Better than most American macros, but not a standout."
"Pick it up as a single from the liquor store. The beer was pour in an English pint glass. The smell of this beer could threw me off, but the flavor compensates for it. A light color with some flavor and a bit of malt. After being in the pint glass the aroma dissipated."
"Thin, watery, and drinkable."
"Pours a very pale, straw-like color with lots of bubbles rising to the surface. Minimal head. Not a heck of a lot of aroma...some faint grains, and a weird, almost skunky smell. Taste is also not very impressive or even shows much flavors except some light grains and adjunct flavors. Finishes with an off flavor. Lots of carbonation, very prickly, crisp. Grab something else if it's available."
"Mouthfeel and drinkability effected by the non-taste and general blandness of the product."
"I don't recomend this beer."
"Drinkability: Absolutely do not want another one of these. Worse than almost every other macro lager I've ever had. Won't buy this ever again. Can't believe Canada's oldest independent brewery has been around this long. i thought Canadian beer was supposed to be good?"
"Drinkability: Better than your run-of-the-mill American lager. and something that we wouldn't mind drinking this again."
"I recommend this beer if you want something easy to drink."
"D: Not great, but certainly a step up from the average macro. A safe bed for someone moving up from the BMC standards."
"This is a decent beer for the style; better than Canadian or Blue. In a can there is a freshness and crispness that have not had in a bottle. To my tastes this beer lacks the corny finish of other macro lagers. At least unlike Keith's it simply is a lager with no pretences"
"This beer pours a light golden/straw color with a one finger head that quickly disappears. Smells of German pills with some hops. The taste is watery with that is sweet at first and ends bitter. The mouthfeel is light, crisp and refreshing. This beer is quite drinkable and unoffensive."
"D - In the end this beer is fairly flavorless. It's not as bad as others out there but it isn't anything to seek out again."
"Out of the bottle this Canuck brew was a light straw gold color with a foamy white head. The retention and lacing were mediocre and the aroma malty in a musty kind of way. The flavors were not much better, above average for a Macro lager but little more than that. Malt lager in the aftertaste and assorted wet grains in the middle with a undertone of minerals. The body was light/medium, the mouthfeel ok and the carbonation the same. Just a C class beer in general."
"Well I admire the marketing for Moosehead. The company's image I think is marketed very well to Canadians as being strongly independent etc. The beer isnt very great though unfortunately. I won't bother trying to describe the appearance or aroma there's nothing to talk about. The flavour is quite bland and the beer is overcarbonated. Stale tasting usually and sour. I personally drink it at bars so I don't give any more money to Labbatt or Molson or the other beer monopolies here in Canada. The bottle is nice too"
"D - Eh.. I guess it's drinkable, if you like chewing on minty blades of grass, this one is for you."
"Serving type: bottle"
"Meh, another fairly bland lager. The aroma is all DMS and cooked corn once this warms, no good. The flavor is pale, clean barley with a slight herbal bitterness at the end. Light in body and easy to drink, there isn't a lot of flavor, but it's ok lawnmower beer. Once the green-bottle skunk clears out, its mostly inoffensive."
"The beer poured a light gingerale color with a small head that didn't last long. The smell very indicative of a macro, some grain and some malt. The taste is almost all malt with a bit of hops towards the finish and little to no residual aftertaste. The mouthfeel is a little watery, but crisp due to the carbonation. This is a very drinkable beer and could easily be enjoyed by the six-pack on a hot summer day."
"A buddy brought me a few of these from Canada. I was pleasantly surprised, but I was comparing it to typical swill. At least it wasn't foul tasting. Pretty smooth with a sweet malty flavor mixed in with some grains. A touch watery but that's expected. Drinkable and refreshing. I'd have it again."
"Poured into a 22 oz. tall glass. Light straw color with a large creamy foam head. The carbonation is medium. The aroma is mild malts with a a touch of wet blankets. The taste is a not a overpowering in any direction. The malt aftertaste comes through with a good amount sweetness. The body is light and if your out of good options or you want something light this is better than most macros; and cheap."
"D. Very drinkable, and I was obviously pretty buzzed by the time I started drinking these. I had 3 and could have had more."
"This is my favorite of the standard Canadian lagers. Slightly above average in all categories. Easy drinking and tastes real good when it's nice and cold. I like to come back to this beer once in a while and most of the bars around here have it on tap so it's better than most of the other choices."
"Hmmm, this isn't doing the job for me. That's a shame, because I have a fond memory of drinking this beer on-tap on New Year's Eve 2006 in Toronto. If wasn't really ""off"" as it was bland."
"D: Drinkable, one of the better Canadian beers I've had had thus far."
"Pours a decent golden-yellow/straw color with some nice head, but little lacing. Very clean and crisp scent, not near as skunky as a typical macro lager, with a nice malt sweetness. Good taste, crisp and refreshing, very little hoppiness, but a great malt flavor. It goes down extremely smooth, a very nice beer to have after mowing the grass."
"I may have a new favorite picnic beer. I should note, however, that I bought a boxed-in 12 pack and so there was no chance for this beer to get exposed to light. I don't think it could handle a skunking. As is, though, it's supremely drinkable and really one of the best surprises I've had in a long time."
"D- Very drinkable like most macro lager"
"The Lager style is not my favorite but this is a darn good beer and for it's style it's better than most."
"Pours from the bottle a Pale straw yellow with a small head and lacing. Smell a bit skunky with corn smell. It has a slight Sweetness to it and is very flavorful in your Mouth. It is easy to drink and you can just sit and enjoy a few. I like this I had not had it for 20 yrs but now I have I will be getting it again. A very nice lager Beer."
"MF&D - Thin bodied and easy drinking. Great summer session Lager."
"D: Not very flavorful, goes down easily enough, not filling at all, mild kick, there's really not much of anything here that would make me want to drink this beer again."
"Finish is rather clean. Very, very drinkable beer that has no flaws, given what the brewers were aiming for. One of the very best for this style, hands down."
"The best of the ""big three"" Canadian macro lagers I've tasted. Certainly more hop character than your average North American lager."
"D: Very drinkable. Definately something you could chill on the patio with and drink. Oddly, it goes well with cigars."
"Body and drinkability are medium. This is one of those beers I used to really enjoy back in the 90's. My how things have changed."
"Great for a day to just pound a few down, I'll probably buy this again during football season and see if my dad digs on it. This seems like a beer my old man would appreciate."
"drinkability is decent. this is a standard pale lager, without anything special. could use a bit more in profile, but not bad otherwise."
"Notes: I will say it beats the American competition for the style and I paid very little for the taste. I really do not prefer beers of this style,but I can appreciate a good one and this beer is worth having every now and then. On a really hot day I can see myself having one or two,but not for session."
"I decide to pour this one into a Flying Fish standard pint glass. What came out was a really clear straw yellow with an OK less than 1/2 inch head of white foam. It quickly dissipated into a few white rings along the edge. It didn't bother to leave any white lace behind. The aroma was very grainy with malted corn and rice, a drop of apple juice, and a hint of juicy fruits in the back. The taste was nothing but grains. No subtle fruit or hops, just malted corn and rice with a hint of malted wheat in the background. It was clearly a light beer with a grainy aftertaste of malted corn and rice. What kind of aftertaste could I have been expecting after a very grainy taste? In the end, it's better than some of the macro lagers I've had and I wouldn't really mind on having another one of these. If you like drinking youir grains, you have to drink a Moosehead!"
"M + D: Maybe a little flat feeling, but decently smooth and finishes semi-dry. An easy drinker, though not something I think I would session, really... wouldn't complain about it sitting in the fridge, though, either."
"The taste is mostly lightly sweet with very faint bitterness, brief but clean and cleansing. It's smooth and fairly full-bodied for what it is, whit a nice, firm, long-lasting grain flavour with faint hints of juniper, apple, and flowers. It's very drinkable and pleasant and far superior to many macro lagers."
"D - This is still a pretty good lager. It is easy drinking and very sessionable."
" This is really not a bad choice for something cheap."
"It's much grainier than other lagers, which more of a wheatlike bread flavor rather than the standard corn. Very clean and crisp, and easy to drink."
"American all malt lager or Munich Helles lager? I have been looking for a good refressing beer that will not break the bank. I think I may have found it. This beer has a very light color with a head that went away fast. Very little hop taste mildly sweet malt. Much better then B/M/C. I compared this beer to Victory lager and found them to be pretty similar. I am partial to Penn. craft brews but when I dont want a beer that is to complex I would buy this again. One note : my bottle says 3.2 alcohol by weight. That is 4.0 abv not 5"
" ~ I'm sitting here trying to really enjoy this brew and finding it difficult to do. I'll pass on another round."
"Overall, a decent lawnmower beer, I might like it more on a hot day. Better than some, worse than others."
"Pale straw yellow with skiff of a head and some carbonation. Clean hoppy smell with some sweetness. Tastes a lot like it smells with citrus and a hoppy bite, clean and smooth, nice balance of hops and malt. Easy to drink and beats most American lagers of the same style."
"Best when cold. Overall not that bad. It is what it is. Going well with chips, salsa and sour cream."
"Why the aversion to brown bottles among Moosehead and Molson, I'll never know. But green in this sense does not mean go, certainly not for me."
"Drinkability is good, goes well with burgers and other standard pub fare."
"Light golden color with a medium thickness white creamy head. Smell is slight skunk at first followed by some malt. Taste is clean, smooth, creamy, and a tad watery. Of the pale lagers I've had, this is definitely the best. Has a hint of bitterness, but finishes with a fairly pleasant bitter-sweetness. This isn't a jaw dropping beer, but for the style, this is very drinkable, and much better tasting than your standard bud/miller/coors selection, with slightly more body, even though it is still a bit watery."
"the taste and aroma of the beer act alike. the clear and crisp bite that feels great on my tongue. this beer is very good going down and is hard to keep away. there are not many Canadian beers in the USA but this one hits the top of my list. I will drink this beer again."
"For a macro lager its fairly decent, because it's Canadian, it's not as watered down as the more common American cousins."
"One taste and I was transported back to my early twenties, when Moosehead seemed to represent a step up from the standard issue macro lager. Even now, it is still upscale in comparison. It's just that now, I know how much higher in quality beer can really be. Regardless, the clean, crisp character makes it drinkable, but getting around the aroma is a challenge now that really didn't present itself decades ago. But hey, if you want to stick one in my hand, I'll find a way to get it past my nose."
"Moosehead is the best bang for your buck. It's just a good smooth lager that has that typical Canadian lager taste; a little bitter and refreshing. This is a great beer to take camping or fishing in the summer. There's nothing like Moosehead after working out."
"A light golden in appearance with a thin head that dissapated rather quickly. Smell is skunky, but clean. I can taste the malt with some grass that is slightly bitter sweet. Mouthfeel is light with a good spike of carbonation. One of the better macro lagers I can enjoy."
"Drinkability: Solid brew. Very refreshing while also satisfying the taste buds."
"Pours a very clear yellow color with a thick, foamy head. Aroma is skunky with some malt and not much else. Skunkiness kind of overwhelms here. Taste is very smooth, crisp and malty. Inoffensive and average are two words I'd use to describe this beer. It's certainly not much impressive. A good lawn-mower beer and nothing more."
"Recommended over some American lagers, but I would stay away from it otherwise"
"If it's on sale."
"This"
"Pours a bright yellow color with virtually no head left once I poured. Smell is of grain, corn and a slight skunky smell. The taste on this one is initially bitter followed by a slight sweetness and more bittering skunk kind of flavor. Body is light and somewhat watery. Carbonation is active and somewhat filling. Better than the average macro lager."
"D: Good. this beer is good on a hot day and in the Winter as well. I give her a B."
"Medium mouthfeel with a refreshment feel to it.Very easy to consume in mass quantities,not bad,better than what i could remember from when i first tried it.I would have again,nothing special though,don't want to get everyone's hope's up."
"A slight--very slight--improvement over Budweiser."
"Light bodied, smooth, inoffensive. It beats most macros, but I can think of so many better lagers...A decent choice to bring to a party of macro drinkers as it is easy but has something to it."
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability : Very nice to drink,this beer reminds why you like beer"
"Taste is crisp and clean and totally inoffensive. Texture is thinner than I'd like and a little oversweet in the aftertaste but not a dealkiller. I honestly could drink a twelver of these and be quite pleased. They go down smooth and easy and very quickly. Not unbelieveable, but honest and dependable."
"I think this is my favorite canadian if had. way better then molson products and labatt products."
"Moosehead lager pours a golden yellow with a thick white head from a green twelve ounce bottle. The aroma is sweet malt and grain. The flavor is mostly sweet malt and a touch of hops and grain. Inoffensive, but not inspiring. A reasonably better alternative to b/m/c."
"Pours a decent looking clear pale color with nice white head that dissipated quickly and left a little bit of lacing on the glass. Aroma was skunky. Flavor was less skunky and a light grassy flavor. Carbonation was heavy while mouthfeel was light. Nothing I would ever seek out again."
"Can't figure out why these breweries don't wise up with the green glass thing. First thing I noticed upon pouring this was the skunky aroma. Had a nice big frothy head though. Some lace. That all faded pretty quickly. Lovely golden color. Maybe over carbonated. Skunkiness wasn't as apparent in the flavor. Which was dominated with some play between bitterness and some grainy sweetness. Sweet finish. Not as good as I recalled."
"D: Good, but didn't feel like having another, it just got boring at the end. Not a bad beer, but it just didn't make an impression on me."
""
"It pours a golden yellow colour that is very clear. The aroma is grainy with some yeasty aftersmells. The mouthfeel is crisp and clear as a lager should be, some mild carbonation on the tongue. The taste is bland and non-descript with some hints of malt and grass."
"Too bad about the green bottle though. oh well, I guess it looks ""cool""."
"This beer didn't wow me in any sense, but it really wasn't bad either. It's less corn/cereal-heavy than its American counterparts and much smoother with less skunk than the Euro pale lagers. So in that regard Moosehead is successful. Again, it's really just an average lager, but it did have a pretty nice aftertaste, and is pretty drinkable."
"man, when i was 16 this was high-end shit. looks like your normal macro lager, smells like your normal macro lager, and tastes like your normal macro lager. corn adjuncts. spritzy. the difference is that there is a bit more going on than bmc, but not much. would only drink this if bmc were the only other options and i absolutely needed a beer."
"Nice pour  clear straw yellow, decent white head and laces. I can sure notice the euro yeast skunk now, and the taste has a ton of corn and cooked veggies in there, even though its suppose to be all malt. Crisp and dry, it has enough redeeming qualities to give it a thumbs up."
"Pale, clear lager yellow. Not much head to speak of, pretty decent lacing. Faint smell of grainy malt. Crisp malt taste at the front end, followed by a vert quick bite of hops that exit almost imediately. Went a bit watery before ending with a dry, almost tart aftertaste. Smooth mouthfeel, a nice, easy to drink lager."
"A decent lager."
"This used to be my favorite beer (I was born in Canada) and I hadn't drunk any in quite a while. I did my best to suppress any prejudices in favor of it; even so, I found it rather pleasant to drink. Color is a typical golden-yellow, not much head. Aroma is sharp and malty. The crisp, malty taste is not complex but is refreshing. It definitely has an ""edge"" to the flavor and mouthfeel that most lagers lack. This is a good party beer."
"In my pre-micro brew days, this was one of my alltime favorites. I had tried this a few years ago and swear when Moosehead got bought out, they changed the formula. Nonetheless, this beer looks like yellow piss. Will leave some lacing, and has a candy like taste on the nose. Terrific session beer and the cornyness dwindles if drank very cold. Goes down easily and is about the same price it was 20 years ago when I first loved it. Better than most american macros."
"D- Easy to drink, refreshing but far too bland. Nothing really wrong with this beer, but it lacks any real character."
"Drinks pretty easy, a little more complexity would help. Nice revist to a blast from my past (84-90 I drank a fare amount of this stuff)"
"D - highly drinkable because of how refreshing it is, not an amazing lager but one you could throw down a bunch of, with no real turn-offs; it's lacking in the skunkiness of a Heineken but doesn't really bring a whole lot to the table for itself either"
"Nose of metal, and cats pee (for those of who that dont know cats pee is a legitimate smell description often used by winos.) Taste is watery, grainy and rather sweet. A cloying sweetness with faint hints of artificial grape flavor is present instead of bittering. This is a nasty beer. It seems so innocuous, and I have never encountered any American macros I simply could not handle, but this one will go down as the first. I gave this one to my roommate. Puke"
"Moosehead is a lager with a light straw hue and a euro lager taste. It's not as 'skunky' as grolsch or heiny but this is headed in that direction. The malt is right up front and comes off crisp....with a bite from the alcohol. little to no head or lacing. very drinkable though. I prefer this very cold...and in that state it is easily the best canadian lager(masspro) other than labatts 50...maybe...but definately better than blue or molsen. However, if it warms the negative qualities(alcohol/skunkiness) become more prominent. A good thirst quencher but not an award winner by any means. Priced right for a decent import."
"Poured a pale golden color with a foamy head. Some lacing on the glass. Smell was of malt, hops, grain and a slight hint of corn. Taste was good for basically a ""run-of-the-mill"" lager, with the malt and corn taste coming through with a slight sweetness. A goood amount of carbonation. A step above a Bud I'd say. With easy drinkability, this could be a good session beer."
"It poured a drak straw yellow with a head that lasted a few seconds. Its a great beer for the awesome and sometimes hot (2 days a year) WNY weather during the summer. It has a somewhat plain taste but its overall a good brew to have alot during the summer"
"It's a light thirst quenching lager, once thought Canadian beers like this were good. Fizzy head pale color, very little nose to the beer. It's a good summer beer with enough ommphh and goes well with burgers and pizza. Quite drinkable on hot days."
"Notes: While I haven't had a moosehead in quite some time I will be back for more when I'm in the mood. Right up there with Pabst Blue Ribbon as the finest examples of macro lagers. You gotta get this fresh though and without any markings on the bottle its a crap shoot. This one was very fresh w/ zero off flavor. Thumbs up to a Brewery that is very important to St John's economy."
"I've seen these green bottles in open six packs as far West as California and as far East as Poland. I've never had an issue with it, but I'd advise a change because ""Canada's oldest independent brewery"" does in fact offer a lager a little cleaner drinking than its now foreign owned counterparts. Drink it cold, and expect what is to be expected."
"Easy to drink. A step above your normal lager."
"¡Salud !"
"Overall: I enjoyed this beer, one of the better ones to come out of Canada."
"Cheap, refreshing Canadian beer...accomplishes what it set out to do."
"Nothing offensive here. Very basic. Would be good with food."
"Would love to try some of the breweries other offerings."
"Final Statement: I poured it in a glass for this review, however I prefer to leave it in the nice green bottle. This is a beer of choice for me on hot summer days, goes down smooth, it's crisp and refreshing, especially on a hot maritime day by the water. It is what it is..."
"Moosehead Lager was a clear pale golden color with a white head that had poor retention. The smell was skunky with a little malt in the backround. The taste was fairly light and clean with a bitter finish. The mouthfeel was light with medium carbontion. It's a fairly drinkable light tasting lager."
"Get my buzz on- n"
"This lager poured a clear, yellow color with white foam that settled quickly. There was very little carbonation apparent from the bottom of the glass. The smell was lightly sweet (perhaps corn? hard to tell) with a bit of malt. The taste was lightly sweet with very minimal hoppiness. The mouthfeel was smooth with medium-light body and light carbonation. Thin flavor overall. This was an OK, inoffensive macro lager."
"Taste tends to get a little bit on the cheap ""beery"" side as this one warms, but when cold the malts are clean and there's a citric acidity that makes this beer a little more interesting and well-balanced than most Canadian macro lagers. A good thirst quencher at any rate. Carbonation is medium-high, with a thick creamy mouthfeel, lots of body. I stand by this beer, but serve cold and make sure you get one that hasn't been light-struck. It can get brutally skunky."
"Cheers!"
"Not bad for what it is. Unattractive light gold color, not much of a head, and average clarity. Not much of an aroma. Smells a bit of mixed malt and floral scents. Taste is slightly blah but compared to other beers in this category its not bad. Light bodied but good carbonation gives it a decent feel. Like this style and the APA's it can be drank at whatever pace you like, great drinkability."
"Not bad for a mass produced Canadian beer, but not a lot to offer either. Probably best after you have had a couple good beers (like some Canadian Unibroue offerings), and taste and quality is not as big an issue...then several of these will hit the spot."
"NOTE: Its been a long time since I had a Moosehead. There was a day 25+ years ago when we thought this was a great beer. The craft beer movement wasnt nearly what it is today, and Moosehead was imported. In retrospect we didnt know jack, but Ill always have fond memories of Moosehead just the same."
"Moosehead pours a crystal-clear, dark gold body beneath a thick finger of bright-white foam that holds remarkably well and leaves some very nice lace about the glass. The nose welcomes you with a beautiful combination of sweetish grainy malt and herbal and floral hops. That combination carries over in the flavor where the hops really come into their own. Initially they seem more herbal, but as it warms a bit some of the more floral nuances appear. The malt doesn't appear as sweet as the nose suggests, and it's also backed by a solid bitterness. In combination with the crisp carbonation and medium-light body, the bitterness cuts through nicely. It finishes dry with some quickly passing, lightly sweet malt up front; a slap of floral hops; and then lingering herbal hops amidst a long-lasting bitterness. Refreshing, satisfying, and highly drinkable!"
"No better sound than the crack of an ice cold can of beer on a hot summer's day. Pours out a crystal clear golden color. Starts with a pretty thick white head, looks impressive but doesn't last. Smell is of sweet grainy malt. Flavor is clean sweet maltiness, with the slightest floral hop. Clean and refreshing, no aftertaste. Smooth, very drinkable. Slightly above average for a lager, much better than the big brewers Molson or Labatt for a sessional."
"Surprisingly crisp, pale colored, nice tasting all malt lager. Easy to drink. Has a bitterness, but it's not offensive. It's good, but not good enough for me to pay extra money to drink it. If there is a drink special where you can get one of these cheap, try it out. You can drink a lot of these and not get too full."
"(I guess not a real problem in northern Canada. *grin*)"
"Pours a very clear straw yellow with a small, fizzy, white head that dissipates quickly and leaves no lacing. Smell is slightly skunked, but with a decent malt profile underneath. Taste is light and malty, with a touch of hops in the finish and nothing offensive to get in the way. Mouthfeel is pretty crisp and well carbonated, and drinkability isn't bad at all. I had this at a wedding, where I was beset by limited choices, and it's really not that bad. Not something I'd buy for myself, but if I was offered one I'd drink it without much complaint."
"Light to medium body, no presence of alcohol so to speak, an easy enough of a drinker. Overall it's an average Macro tasting Lager, brewed by the mighty Canadians...Cheers!"
"Sparkling 8 karat gold topped with a brilliant white head of loosely packed medium bubbles. Ample vibrant carbonation streams jet to the surface. The head settles to nothing shortly after pouring leaving no lacing. The smell is fresh and clean, sweet with fresh grain and some hop edge. The taste is crisp initially, giving way to a distinct sweetness, which is a tad heavy. Finishes with a soft but firm hop edge that doesn't linger. Light body and filled with roiling carbonation which somewhat offsets the medium sweetness. Nice and crisp and good for a warm day. A good ball park beer."
"A very drinkable Canadian lager. Head and shoulders above the other Canadian lagers. Beats a Keith's."
"I bought the beer on a whim and was surprised. I expected little from the lager, I was just hoping against Bud Light in a different bottle. This beer is a great recommendation for drinkers who don't care for dark beers; certainly a high lager."
"Dthis one is ok. I can see it being highly drinkable on a hot day. I bought a 12 pack since it was on sale. Ill save the rest for next month when I can sit outside on the deck."
"Overall - An average beer... worth a try once...."
"tried this drink last night and i don't think my experience with this beer was as good as expected. the smell of this one was very skunky...almost unbearable, i do believe this was light struck. nonetheless i drank it and it was alright, nice head that stayed ok. plenty of carbonation. tasted nice and hoppy, i'll try this drink again, hopefully with a better review."
"Typical for 'green bottled' beer. Pungent odors emit from the bottle. Aromas of light skunk, earthy, and grain. Getting into the flavor, the odors subside a bit, leaving a cereal grain flavor with a mouthfeel of light huskiness and graininess. Malt sweetness and breadiness is moderate and improves until the sharp and almost astringent finish. Leaving a grain-like aftertaste. Though I've had worse, this is not likely to be a beer that I will revisit."
"One of my favorite popular Canadian Lagers, the taste is not as strong as some beers, but it's definitely good in it's own way. Would recommend."
"There is a good golden color with poor head retention. This beer makes you suspect that the color might be artificial. It smells every so slightly hoppy but there are no presence of malts. You can defeinetly smell that skunk though. Again the taste is skunk. This overpowers and other hops or malts. The beer is watery but there is good carbonation. This could be artificial too though. Maybe if this beer was cold enough, your tastebuds cold be numbed enough just to enjoy a buzz."
"A light golden color with a small head,although it does have alot of carbonation bubbles.The smell has a slight hoppiness,but nothing else.The taste is, light,weak,and watery.It has a slight carmel aftertaste,but this is pretty bad.The m/f is like the taste,weak and watery.I can't imagine ever having this again."
"Overall, this is fairly drinkable, more so than many macro lagers, but obviously not something I'd seek out. Drink it out of the bottle if you're going to drink it at all -- it's better if you can't get the smell as much. In a pinch, I'd drink one or two of these."
"Overall: Not too much of an improvement over several other more commercially-marketed American lagers, but I have to say that it is better than some."
"This is worse than Bud. The vegetal flavors are too prominent."
"I think this beer is close to being really good but is just a bit light on flavor, it is better than most American Macros however, and not a bad beer at all."
"A real good beer, little better than its sister; smell clean, like green malt, taste light bitter, wide and round, full bodied, special for the american food; try with mexican and goat cheese´s; drink from the bottle and in a pilsner glass; try too in a mug; 90% recommended."
"Pale yellow in colour with loads of carbonation. There's some faint grassy/spicy hop aroma to this one. I suspect its Tettnanger, but I could be wrong. There's a touch of light malt and sulphur too, but not enough to be offensive. Light malt flavors abound, with the spice element of the hops coming though a bit more clearly. The bitterness is slightly higher than most North American macros, but still on the low side generally speaking. This beer is my last fall back when it comes to eating/drinking at places that don't have much (or any) good beer."
"Overall this is an ok beer. Im suprised its panned as much as it is. Its nothing special, but its not bad by any stretch of the imagination."
"Pours golden clear with a thick white head that fades quickly to nothing. Pleasant, citrus and malt nose. Flavor is about average for a typical lager: slightly bitter with yeast, wheat, and malt, with the same citrus notes and a hint of hops. Finish is again citrus, and slightly bitter. Mouth is watery, bubbly, and refreshing, lending toward slightly above average drinkability. In all, about an average lager."
"Pours a golden yellow, clear, big white head, no lace. Smell is sweet malt, some spicy hops. Taste is lagery and sweet, some spicy hops in the middle, slight bitterness in the finish. Mouthfeel is acidic, high carbonation, light body. I remembered this being a lot worse, not as bad as some."
"A good hot weather beer - mild, crisp and fairly refreshing."
"This brew poured a light golden yellow with a thin white head that dispersed rapidly. Nose was crisp with well blended hops and malts. Taste was a refreshing dry malt start with a clean hop finish. Mouthfeel was pretty average, nothing noteworthy. Overall drinkability is OK, makes for an easy drinking session beer."
"Would I drink this again? Maybe, I wouldn't turn down a freebie. I doubt I'd actually buy it. I remember drinking this in my earlier uneducated days just because it was from Canada. Same reason I drank Molson, Labatt, etcetera."
"Solid gold with a thin head that quickly fades to good lacing. Rich hoppy smell, blended well with malt. Skunk aftertaste makes this a sipping beer, and it is very filling. But the smooth mouthfeel and crisp, well balanced taste boost an otherwise very low drinkabilty. A full flavored lager, less expensive than other inferior canadian imports. Extra style points."
"Kind of a dull beer. Not much off taste but nothing great to detect either. Good but not that lasting head, golden collored and clear beer. Nose is some maltarome, litle citric note litle aplearome but all dosed very low. As taste is; litle maltarome, litle sweetness, little bitter, fresh but overal a dull brew. Drinkable but so is Molson"
"I tried this with high hopes that it would be as good as the movie Never Cry Wolf made it sound. Appearance is standard golden, with white foam and soon-gone lace. Aroma contains barley, sweet malt and mild hops. Initial taste is clean and mildly carbonated, a bit of malt, and a snappish hop kick. Finish is dry and leaves no aftertaste. Okay, but not great."
"It tastes like your average lager and that's about it. Grains, malts, hoppy at times. Goes down quick and easy which makes it great for a hot afternoon when you want something to gulp."
"12 oz bottle obtained from a local grocery store (HyVee) and consumed a couple days later. Pours a two-finger white fluffy head over a crystal clear light straw liquid. Streams up bubbles race to the top. Smells tinny (like Saaz hops) with a very gentle malt sweetness. Cut dried hay, like my in-laws barn (but not dirty smelling). Taste starts rough bitter then a gentle malt sweet rolls in. Mild and clean. There also is a watery flavor. Later, a mild floral hangs around in the aftertaste. Sharp carbonation that's not too distracting, but carbonation is part of the flavor profile. Super-thin mouthfeel."
"The moose is a cool animal but does this beer offer more than the coolness of the moose? The aroma contains skunkiness but overall fairly clean. The white head dissapears quickly. The taste is so damn malty and sweet. Not pickin much up in terms of hoppage though. The sweet plastic tasting nastiness is really gross. At first this was fairly easy to drink but the taste just got more and more annoying. Now i don't like budwesier but this is worse, it is jsut plain queer. Really dissapointing. They tried to complicate something that was meant to be simple."
"12 oz. with no freshness date - served chilled in a pilsner glass. Pours a pale gold/straw with lots of streams of carbonation and a 1/2 inch head that fades fairly quickly but doesn't die, leaving some lacing toward the end. Has the grassy/skunky/metallic scent of a Euro macro. On the palate there is sweet grain, hops, skunk, and wet paper. It's the last flavor that ruins it for me and leads me to believe it's a bad bottle. The body is light and tingly with not much aftertaste and I'm sure I could make a session beer out of some fresh ones (which I would then re-review)."
"A very decent lager that is rather affordable and doesn't use/have the adjunct flavor of other lower price brews."
"One of the best examples of the best Canadian macros out there (eat your heart out, Labatt and Molson). This is a crisp, clean and very drinkable beer. Color is crystal clear gold, moderate head. Smell is cereal grain and malt, slightly grassy. Clean, and no off flavors. No Unibroue, but still one of my favorite Canadian Lagers."
"Pours with a two-finger white head that fades quickly leaving traces of lace. Clear amber color. Light carbonation and light bodied. Slight hoppy/skunky nose. Starts with a mix of hops and sweetness, finish is clean, better than American lagers. $1.50 for a 12oz green bottle from Colonial Spirits Acton, Ma."
"Pair with moose head soup, boiled moose nose, moose tongue sandwich."
"¡Salud!"
"Pale yellow color with a white lace for a head. Smells grainy with some sweet malts and clean mild hops. Taste like grains and sweet malts. A clean hop background and a clean finish. A good amount of carbonation and a meduim light body. All around tasty easy to drink lager."
"Drinkability: Not really drinkable. Some bottles might be ok, but it is usally crap you will get with this brand. It's sad, but I don't know why. If I am in the Maritimes, I will rather drink Alexander Keith's or Alpine. Moosehead sounds better to me for its hockey team rather than its premium beer."
"Holy skunk, Batman! Usually the first thing I comment on id the appearance, but I didnt even get it out of the bottle before this NASTY wave of skunk hit me. Didnt get any better when I pour it into the glass. Lets let it sit for a bit and see if the stink subsides a bit. Its a pale gold brew with a small, white, rapidly diminishing, fizzy head. OK, the stink did go away a bit, but its still not pleasing. Now I can pick up a corny, grainy, adjunct smell with a little floral hop to it. Taste is vegetable-like, with a skunk kick. Even my belch is skunky. This is just wrong, and its going down the drain. I remember back in the day, I used to like this stuff. Maybe its a bad bottle, but looking at the past few reviews, Im thinking its just a crappy beer. Avoid."
"This is one of the worst samples I've tried of Moosehead. I'll re-review this beer from a case or twelve pack that hasn't been light struck, as it's not usually this skunky."
"Moosehead Lager is an unoffensive rehydrater. Hey, at least I didn't make any moose <liquid waste product> references."
"Drinkability: No problem putting these away, and I'll likely purchase again sometime in the future."
"Thanks for the beer, Pop."
"Drinkability- Nope, sorry, it was all I could do to finish the bottle. I'll pass on these in the future."
"Reviewing this as an American Macro Lager. Pours a crystal clear gold with a 1 1/2 finger head. The head did hang around for 3 or 4 minutes and left a very thin head with ok lace. Smells of a typical macro, some malt with some bitternes mixed with a bit of rice and corn. As far as taste it has a bit more flavor than the average. A sweet malt finished by some mild hop bitternes. Some rice and corn notes come through as well. Finishes a bit dry. As far as typical macros, this one is better than the average, but there are still better choices out there (Upper Canada Lager comes to mind). A good beer to always have available due to its drinkability."
"Give it a pass. The rest of this one goes down the sink."
"I tried this beer for the second time last night (being from new orleans moosehead isn't really a beer worth getting other than trying it out). from a bottle i poured out a light golden beer with little head. The aroma smelled extremely grainy and very potent. My friend could smell it from across the room as another thought it smelled like cereal. The taste was very typical lager flavor, a little more grainy than others i thought. Average body for a lager, nothing to get worked up on. Wasn't a bad beer just not all that good and i probably won't have one for a long while since i thought there wasn't anything special in this one."
"I don't know why, but I've never had a good experience with Moosehead in cans, in bottles it's your typical North American macro lager but better. I've almost come to order them by default in places with limited selection...I've never noticed the skunk thing that others have mentioned. If you find any Moosehead cans with Spanish on them outside of Mexico, the police in New Brunswick are looking for several thousand."
"This was one of my first beers outside the BMC ring, albeit it's not much different. Although I assume that i'll always have a little soft spot for the moose. Definately won't be purchasing in bulk anytime soon but a bottle every 6 months or so brings back some memories. Pours a super light straw color with a head consisting of rather large bubbles and the air is filled with that skunked funk (which I actually don't mind that much). Taste is very similiar to american macros, but there is a little little little (can't emphasize this enough) taste of some hoppiness. Mouthfeel is very light. Despite the blandness of this beer, I don't really mind it. But I don't see why I always seemed to purchase this in times past."
"Very drinkable, if you can get past the smell."
"whispy, white head. Soon thina nd blue. Light gold body with quite active carbination. A refreshing nose, but quite vacatn: adjuncty and malty - what is there. In ta glass, this beer seems a lot sweeter than in the bottle, which is too sweet. Long and sweet finish with a slight carb sting on the back of the tongue. lingering cloyness. mouthfeel is pretty creamy and good, but is should have kept this in the bottle."
"A good beer to drink if you don't want to be challenged in any form.. neither flavorful nor off-putting, but more drinkable than the typical macro."
"The beer pours from the 12 ounce green bottle a translucent gold with a bountiful bright white head that is spumescent in texture and the residual lace a velum like sheet to coat the glass. Nose is malt, somewhat fresh, Moosehead always at the first sniff smell like its skunked, but does seem to smooth out after a few minutes. Start is sweet and fair to middling in the malt arena, top is skimpy in its feel upon the palate, finish is benignly acidic, and the hops apropos to the style, most likely will be another 4 years before I try this or the others again."
"This beer was ok but something about it did not really agree with me. It poured your standard macro lager color with a bit of a white frothy head that faded quick but left decent lace on my glass. The smell was overly sweet with malt and grain. The flavor was way too sweet and had little to no bitterness to balance it out. The grain flavors snuck in as well but the overly sweet flavor dominated too much. Not recommended at all."
"A watery mouthfeel finsih but it is oddly quaffable on this hot summer night."
"It's very plain, but at least it remains tolerable."
"I remembered this beer being better than this, but that was quite some time ago. I suppose that my tastes have changed as I have sampled more varieties."
"Average...thats all I can come up with that stands out about Moosehead. There was a day when it seemed head and body better than most of the commercial yellow fizzy drinks produced by Canuck mega brewers but there is so much micro brew out there now ""the moose"" just seems average. Pours a light straw color, high carbonation, small white head that goes to nothing but a ring....slight grassy hop smells mingled with sweet boiled grains....sharp start, medium-light body with a clean balanced finish. Better balanced in malt sweetness and hop astringency than most commercial lagers....but still average."
"ah, moosehead. it was actually a beer of choice of mine back in the day. not so much now, but i still enjoy it on occasion. it pours an unimpressive light golden colour. it's highly bubbly and looks alot closer to champagne than beer at times. the smell is typical of lagers packaged in green bottles: a bit grainy and a bit skunked. nothing more to say. luckily, this doesn't carry over into the flavour, which is nice and crisp and quite refreshing. it's nothing that breaks the bank, but it's better than any US macro, and probably better than all of the canadian ones as well. this is a relatively smooth brew overall that's quite quaffable, especially in the summer months. not great overall, but it'll quench your thirst."
"MOOSE! Great packaging, obviously... Moosehead tends to be skunky in a 6 pack, but recently i had it from a case, so it was kept in the dark. Not so skunky. I think I prefer the skunk. Not as good as Molson Canadian in my opinion. It's a clear, light gold with some white fizzy head, smells a bit hoppy, grainy. tastes, well skunky and grainy, a little sweet maybe but not too much, maybe a bit like cornflakes but less sweet. Not bad. Mouthfeel is thin, but that adds to drinkability? I could drink a few in a night but given better choices I probably wouldn't."
"Not a bad pale lager. Too Euroskunky and doughy to have more than a couple."
"ng"
"This is the first beer i ever remember tasting, having a sip from my dads when i was a nipper"
"Most industrial lagers are offensively sweet. This beer demonstrates balance."
"At the moosehead bar in paris' chich 6th arrondisement, monday nights is 2 for 1 nights on the Moosehead lager. Why? it's obvious you rarely get a bottled beer on such a discount of it's any good. But this macro, served at extreme freezing temperatures (like just pulled out of freakin north canada) is nothing to preach favourably about. Gassy, flavourless and overhopped (when balanced against the rest of the content), it proves what the spirit of the moosehead's monday night 2 for 1 is: quantity over quality."
"The drink was very clean and refreshing. I just wasn't that impressed with it. I guess I was hopeing for alot more hop presense. It would make a great lawnmower beer."
"This is a better than average canadian lager. Served out of a green bottle (ack), but should be okay due to the 12 pack packaging. Nice malty-sweet taste to the beer. A head that lasts longer than most, and I was a bit surpised by the amount of lacing that this beer left, given the fact it is a macro. Slight smell of malted barley, perhaps some corn and or rice, but not as present as most macros. Could use another shot of hops, but very, very drinkable as it is."
"The beer pours a very pale gold color with a thick frothy white head that fades to lacing. The aroma is decent. It is light with a slight malt scent and a pleasant green bottle skunky smell. The taste is good. It is light and refreshing with a nice skunky green bottle flavor and slightly bitter aftertaste. The mouthfeel is good. It is a low bodied beer with good carbonation. This is a fine Canadian lager. It has a decent aroma and good lager flavor."
"Pours to a bubbly white head that fades to a tiny ring of foam. Color is pale yellow. Aroma is initially skunky, mostly due to age and poor handling that it receives in Oklahoma. The skunk fades away to reveal a crisp, sweet malt aroma backed up by alcohol and noble hops. Tastes malty and tart--not as sweet as the aroma suggests. Rather dry and mildly bitter. Decent balance with residual malt sweetness and carbonation bite in the finish. Easy to drink, tastes better than I remember it being."
"This would be drinkable enough at a summer party or the like..small step up from the likes of Michelob etc."
"Better than the national brands by a moose whisker. If youa re surrounded by national brands, you can get by on one of these if you sip it as some maltiness and carbonation. Unattractive Yellow and short but immense sudsy foam. Grainy, more drinkable with food."
"All in all this is a quality beer."
"Good Drinkability, but here this isn't exactly cheap. I remember when this was the GREATEST beer ever! its OK."
"Drinkability: Perfect session beer. Carbonated just enough to keep it crisp, and have it go down smoothly - clean, easy drinking taste, and a touch of character. I really do love this beer, I'll never call it great, but it -is- good. I consider this to be a quintessential Canadian beer."
"Yep, pretty much the same after twenty years, still sporting that funky olive flavor that I've yet to find in any other beer. Otherwise, Moosehead is a pretty uninspiring, unremarkable beer that I can wait another twenty years before trying again."
"Drinkability  I cant believe that I used to like this beer."
"Drinkable and decent."
"Pours out clear yellow with a decent white head. Aroma is weak, with some slight skunkiness and a whiff of grains. Taste starts of OK, basically alot like a heineken, some faint hops and grains, then everything turns to nastiness. A saccarine sweetness kicks in halfway through your sip, with no flavor, just sweetness, like powdered sugar, making this one nasty brew. Mouthfeel is OK but that taste lingers. Drinkablity is decent if you can get past that sweetness. Pick up a cheaper macro instead."
"Quite impressive lager. Pours a golden colour topped by an acceptable white head that settled after a couple of sips. This beer is slightly more bitter in the flavour than other lagers though it is VERY drinkable and i wouldn't mind drinking this beer all night long."
"Tried this one for the first time and found it to be a unique beer. Each one had a hint of skunky flavor, but not to the extent that it ruined all the flavor (from earlier postings, i suppose this is the effect that this brew is supposed to have). Besides the touch of stale flavor, it was rather smooth and crisp, with a aftertaste that was not all that displeasing. Poured out to a lighter golden color with a decent over bubbly head. For some reason this beer was not what I thought it would be, not better, not worse, just different. I don't know if i'd buy this brew again as it was kind of expensive for the overall experience, but it may be for you. Worth a try if you are open to a different kind of beer."
"Straw golden hue with a creamy mountainous white head very nicely textured leaves behind thickests of lacing. Primarily smells of sweet grain not bad at all but there is a hop aroma here to balance the sweetness good representation of a solid all around drinkable lager, very clean and inviting but there have been times when I've had 6 packs this time I sided with a 12 pack split with a friend only five bucks a piece not bad eh? Taste, is full on sweetness fresh cracked grains a malty lager with a nice bite of hops in the finish considered flavorful side by side other macro North American lagers. Could be a staple for the right price, mouthfeel is slightly creamy medium to light in body good carbonation solid brew. Drinkability, tasty, refreshing, and all around decent brew."
"On-tap at Mother Hubbard's in Chicago. Pale golden, ahh the color of urine. Decent head, not bad retention. Smell is very clean mostly grain and rice. Taste is similar. Grains, bland malts and not much in the way of hops. Lots of adjuncts on the finish and in the aftertaste. This beer is pretty bad."
"Nice golden brew with a generous head. Strong skunky taste with a small malt aftertaste. This is a very light brew. This is one of the worst macro I had for a while. I don't see the need to drink this again and again why are they using light green bottle..."
"Known to people in New Brunswick as Moose Green (the label is green). A near perfect clear gold that has a small but aromatic releasing head. The smell of malt is very pleasant and you can taste it. But you can also taste the hops too. Feels pretty good in the mouth and is still refreshing after its gone down. It stands alone well on a summer afternoon or with a hamburger done on the BBQ on a cold January First. Its a better lager than most."
"It's an over-all above average average lager, and tops any macro I've had on the market. Clear golden body, not much head. Nose is sweet grainy malt. Flavour is crisp sweet malt, with a hint of floral hops in there if you imagine hard enough. Refreshing, smooth, very drinkable. Straight and simple. A session lager for pool, darts or karaoke, it lets you focus on what you are doing rather than on what you are drinking--lets you get down to business."
"Very pale gold color, small head. A light malt aroma. A medium bodied sweet tasting lager. There is some maltyness and some hoppyness but its masked by the sweetness. Very carbonated. Better than most of the Euro-lagers, but still not very good. I used to love this stuff, either my tastes have changed or this beer is really different. Mouthfeel is full. Finish is clean. Aftertaste is slightly bitter."
"Another mundane Canadian beer. This beer is yellow with little to no head and nothing interesting about it. Very average beer but very drinkable as well. It fits in with the other Canadian beers like Lebatt and Molson. ""Nothing to see here folks, move along."""
"This one looked like a normal lager but definitely not light which is good. Smelled sweet and nice. Taste is of generic malts and little hops. Finishes better than most lagers but nothing stands out. Too much money for its quality. Better from the tap than from the bottle."
"On-Tap: Color is straw gold, somewhat pale, thin loose white head with small spots of lacing. Smell is of fresh grains with good malted barley sweetness and clean easy hops. Taste is crisp medium maltyness, very clean, a bit breadish, hops linger in quickly with a small amount of bitterness and then leaves with a fresh drying grain texture that kinda pulls any harsh sweetness away lending a crisp, clean after taste. And since it comes in a green bottle; that harsh sweetness can be overbearing if its old and been exposed to alot of light, thats why I stick with it being on-tap. Its much fresher in this form and makes for some pretty easy drinkin'."
"No freshness date."
"Still a simple, good lager. Gold, dare I say maple tree colour? with a 1/2 head that lasted. Barley malt smell, little floral hops. Sweet malt taste, slight hop bitter/spicyness, but not well balanced. Thirst quenching mouthfeel and very drinkable. Simple, good lager."
"I'd probably rate this better if the skunk didn't get to it first, but overall, this beer seems like a average macro and is probably quite refreshing if it's a fresh batch."
"Cheers!,"
"Boring, but not bad flavor out of the tap for this one. It is a bit better than the bottled version. Slightly bitter, but mostly sweet with a lot of grains. It is easy to drink, and it is definitely not the worst thing you could fall back on at the bar."
"Overall this is a pleasant, if not impressive beer. The color, smell and taste are all quite average. Nice head, little retention. I like the packaging even though the green bottle creates the less than optimum taste and smell. This is a thirst quenching, inexpensive, and enjoyable summer beer."
"Huge snow-white head with modest carbonation and thick lace; crystal-clear medium golden color. Aroma is extremely skunky, so much so that my fiancee's cat, who was nearby when I poured this, wrinkled her nose. Also notable in the aroma is a strong grain component and slightly spicy hops. Taste begins with solid light malt flavors and a sweet, almost honey-like note, carbonation is quite smooth. Towards the finish there is a brief spike of spicy hops, there and then gone quite quickly. The finish is utterly clean. A smooth and wonderfully drinkable beer. This was a favorite of mine during college when I could afford it, just as good as I remembered it to be."
"All around, an average beer, but it is a little better than I'd thought it'd be."
"This is THE Canadian beer in my book. It's definately a mass produced beer, but the quality shows through. It is average to above average in all respects. Pours medium yellow with a good head. The taste is malty with decent hoppiness. Has a crisp, distinct flavor. A little skunk did not deter the experience. I liked this. I wish all macros tasted this good. I have also tried this from a keg and it is excellent. OH CANADA!!!"
"moosehead pours out a clear darker golden color. an ample head and a bit of lace adorns my glass. pleasant aromas of malt and grain with some light floral hopping. nice malty and grainy flavors. a definite hop character appears and fades, just for show. medium to light in body....smooth and satisfying. easy drinking and of good character. no green bottle euro skunk. 100% north american characteristics. finishes with a slight bit of crispness, and an enjoyable malt and hop aftertaste. this lager has character, and gives hope to those who think all mass produced american style lagers suck. moosehead is a canadian classic and a lager to be respected."
"Slightly more rich and golden than straw in color, the beer was topped with a dense layer of fine white foam which was sticking slightly to the glass. It smelled very clean like pale malt and hops, maybe a little bit of husk too. Ill have to have another since I was a little stuffed up. Malt flavor was present which was a bit of a surprise given the style and what Ive had in the past. Bitterness, too, was at decent levels but without any lingering. The hop bitterness along with some alcohol dried out the finish making it a very enjoyable gulping beer. Compared to many other beers of the style, Moosehead is great."
"I won't buy this often because I can't rationalize spending premium $$ on American Lagers but if they were all priced the same and I wanted an American lager this would be the choice....no questions asked.."
"Hey, Moosehead chuck the green bottles!"
"Poured to a brilliant golden color with a thick white head that lasts. The aromas are of light malt and hops, with a bit of grain aromas as well. Again like in the aromas the flavors are of light hop and malt, and a bit of grain flavors. Moosehead is a very smooth, crisp, clean lager, which makes it go down really easy. It has more flavor than your average mainstream American lagers."
"Before a good friend by the name of Hootie introduced me to the beauty of good beer with my first Hoegardden on tap at D's this was one of my favorite beers. I still like it but my no means or to any extent does it touch my top 40 list. Smell is a little grainy. Taste is smooth smooth smooth. I always thought its had almost a 'creamy' taste to it, but by reading the reviews of many other BA's, Im starting to think that just may have been me. Flavor is far more malty than hops; hop taste is insignificant. Mouthfeel is excellent and one of the highlights of this brew. Feels great on the tongue, palate, and the rest of the way down. Many people knock this brew as 'just another Canadien Import' but it is far superior to anything that comes into my distributor (while I may in defense say I am in Meadville where the public tend to have less teeth that grades of high school completed). It just makes no sense to me that this bottle is green; why take a chance of skunkiness? Also Ive tended to stay away from this brew to its price and the fact that well the same company imports this as Corona (could that be the reason for high prices?)."
"                     good plain beer nothing special butt not bad"
"Smells of sweet corn and grain come from this ultra-clear pale yellow/orange beer.  It pours a large 2 1/2 finger white head that is quite impressive for the style.  Although not at all complex this is an extremely smooth beer with a little character to please as well.  Mild carb bite in the beginning with maybe a hint of hops and grain contained in a semi-sweet maybe light to medium bodied brew.  Very drinkable.  Although this is a very simple beer, it is an ""easy-like"" beer, but just like music ""easy-like"" you tend to get bored with it sooner than one that has to grow on you.  Good beer in comparison to others in this style.  Cheers!"
"In high school, this was the ""exotic"" canadian import. Tastes pretty much like Molson, although the moose really inspires me. Good outdoor beer (we were in high school). The taste is pleasant enough and after three, who really tasted it anyways?"
"Think I will crack one open now...."
"This is as good as any other Canadian. The difference I experience in the Canadians is the smooth drinkability. It seems to be their marquee note. The overall appearance is good; smell and taste are what you would expect from an above average lager. Present tones of spice and hop aromas. Goes down smooth and stays there."
"When fresh, Moosehead Lager can be refreshing and crisp, but when light struck, youll want to hold your nose."
"A pale golden well-carbonated body forms a beautiful compact and foamy white head that lasts.  The aroma has a hint of hop spiciness, but not much.  The taste is refreshing and crisp, malt notes lead at first followed by a well-balanced hop bitterness lingering into a slightly dry mouthfeel.  The Canadian version is a very nicely-brewed North American lager, too bad the same cannot be said for its American-imported version."
"Nothing great but nothing bad about this brew. A clean and quick to drink lager. Better than many US lagers with a bit more quality and the same drinkability. No one aspect blows you away but not bad all together."
"Slightly sweet apple notes (or maybe it was the green bottle-ugh), but bottom line nothing struck me about this beer that would make me want to try it again. Luckily I didn't get a skunky bottle."
"Clear straw hue topped by a fluffy white head.  Generic sweetness, light sulfur with a very subdued floral hop nose in aroma.  The typically bland flavor profile is comprised of a quick snap of hop bitterness upfront, followed by dextrin sweetness and pronounced corn notes.  When coupled with the watery mouthfeel, this brew goes down easy, but is uttery unremarkable.  Moosehead is only a notch above typical megaswill in enjoyment."
"Well, I hate to be such a conformist, but this is a really bad brew.  The only good thing I can think of is the head, which was there but not too thick nor thin.  The aroma was that of formaldehide or something similar.  The beer is actually drinkable, but I think it is the bottle that is green that is causing all of the problems."
"This is skunky.  It seems like a bit more watery Heineken.  It was very pale, had a slight bubbley head that dissipated quickly.  It starts with a skunky taste and finishes with an even skunkier aftertaste."
"The only thing I can really say about this brew is the attractive logo on the bottle.  The smell really tuned me off before I even tasted it and then the taste confirmed it.  Very skunky and such a bad after taste.  I'm sure some like this beer, but its not my cup of tea or should I say beer lol.......CHEERS"
"Yellow straw with crisp almost soda like carobnaton, Quickly dissapearing head.  Smells pilsner like with hoppy floral aroma. Taste is nicely blended between sweet malt and sharp biting hops.  Very clean and crisp. Finishes somewhat dry."
"Clear gold color, decent head at 1/2 inch but adjunct in quality and duration.  Slightly hoppy aroma, notes of skunk.  Decent hop crispness, mouthfeel is very light aside from carbonation.  The malts really fall down in quality of flavor and in providing balance.  What remains is a slightly bitter, watery, and gassy beer that's not very pleasant to swallow.  A slightly skunked macro in taste and impression."
"Good, crisp, lager (better than budwieser)..   however, this moose pee is better as a dilutive effect (about 30%) for a great black and tan (with Guiness stout being the other 70%, of course)."
"This beer poured a pale yellow color and formed a bubbly white head that left no lace as it subsided. An aroma of hops and grain. The flavor was of hops and grain. The body is fairly light and mostly bite to hide any type of finish. I had friends in college from Canada, so I always had them introducing different beers to me from there nation. One of them loved this beer, but I have never been that impressed with it. I found the taste, mouthfeel and smell not very good at all."
"Funky skunk taste, watery, weak, and a waste of money for what you pay for, $16 Aussie dollars a sixer( around $8US), tastes like evry other mass produced lager ever made, quite sweet, very one dimensional mass market style lager. zzzzzzzz............"
"Not too bad. I'd drink it over Budweiser anyday. A little light on the flavor side and a little watery, but definitely drinkable. It'd be an option for a summer cookout beer."
"Notes: A clean and quick to drink lager, better than its US counterpart while leaving a touch more quality without taking away from the swift drinkability of most American lagers."
"Very drinkable lager ( if fresh) , better then Budweiser lager. I thought it was crisp with a clean finish."
"The ""poor"" smell is for the semi-occasional skunky bottle.  Otherwise, a very drinkable golden brew with a decently clean finish. Good lawnmower beer. And I've yet to find a beer that, in all seriousness, causes people to belch as much as Moosehead. Is it the carbonation? I have no idea."
"Not a bad Canadien lager. Best drunk when cold and fresh. Can be extremely skunky."
"Good body and fairly well balanced.  Consistent from start to finish.  Easy to drink, and although it does not have a lot of depth of flavor, it is probably a little more flavorful than the average American lager."
