"Super grapefruit citrus aroma. Nice copper body with a 2 finger head that laces up nicely. Bitter start that smooths out quickly. Hint of a sour finish but is otherwise smooth. Like this one very much. If you like west coast pale ale or IPA’s it’s worth the a try"
""
""
""
""
"Probably won't seek out and purchase again, but would drink if available."
""
"Very good thick creamy head. Good flavor very good ipl"
""
""
"Overall, Double Agent is a nice hoppy lager that doesn't go ""overboard"" with bitterness."

"I enjoyed this brew. A little toned down for those that don't like intense hops. This would be a great crossover beer."

"Pours a copper with a small head. Mild to low carbonation. Smells biscuity, not much hop presence in the nose. Very smooth and crisp going down. I don't much care for lagers, but I am starting to open up to these IPLs."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - I am not huge into hoppy beers but this one is actually good.  Has an actual nice hoppy taste without being extremely bitter."
""
"Poured into a Seattle Beer Week pint glass. Pours a medium coppery amber with a thin white head that dissipates to patches. Aroma of sweet biscuit malt, light piney and grassy hops. Flavor is biscuit malt, grassy hops with light piney and citrus elements. Finishes with grapefruit and citrus hop bitterness and citrus rind. Medium bodied. Exactly what is expected from a India pale lager, with a classic lager body with distinctive grassy hops with piney and light resinous notes. The hops are well balanced with the crackery malt. A little of the distinctive Boston Beer light butteriness in the finish."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Although this is a lager, It does laps around your standard BMC beers, boasting stronger malt flavor and lovely hop bitterness. The bitterness isn't overwhelming, so I think many people would enjoy this beer. I sure did!"
""
""
""
""
"A little different than a standard IPA and much more interesting than a good many lagers.  This beer isn't great, but is worth a try. Went well with dinner."

"Very fruity. The hops impart a very tropical fruit and grapefruit flavor. Not my usual thing, but it is very good. Very interesting beer. Maybe being a lager helps give it such a unique touch."

"I am not a fan of IPA/IPL beer in general and this one does nothing to change my thinking."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Looking at the quality of Sam Adam's products, this beer matches a lot of there best brews. I may be a little biased because I am a huge fan of IPA's but this IPL still gives me that hop flavor that I crave. It would be a great beer for people that like IPA's but do not want that bitter hops flavor. Overall a really good beer."

"O: Excellent brew, and a great presentation on an emerging style. Bought in Pensacola, FL, drank in Montgomery Alabama July 31st, 2014."
""
""
""
"O - I've tried this 3 times before and it was always skunky and obnoxiously bitter. A very good lager, but be careful with the expiration date and where you buy it. Cheers!"
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This starts out like an APA, then when you expect that malt backbone to come in at the end, it just drops off. Despite that, it doesn't feel out of balance the way many west-coast IPA's do. Instead, it just feels sort of empty. Beautiful to look at & smell, and would certainly be a go-to for a hoppy session beer; but if drinking just one, it leaves a lot wanting."

"Served in the sexy, curvy Samuel Adams glass. Clear golden body with moderate effervescence. An inch and a half of foamy white head. Aromas of lager yeast, piney hops, biscuit malt, earth and floral notes. Almost like a hoppier version of Samuel Adams Boston Lager. Medium bitterness. Clean and refreshing. Lasting notes of earthy hops and a bitter tang. Honestly, this is much better than I expected. I haven't been too impressed with the many hoppy offerings in the Samuel Adams lineup, but I'd have this again."

"BBD 9/14. Pours a light amber, just a shade above golden, with a slight ruby tint. Massive head with superb lacing and retention. Nice light nose of citrus, grapefruit and sweet tropical, over a bit of biscuit. Light medium body with a smooth texture. Slightly above normal carbonation which imparts a nice effervescence on the finish. The flavor profile is a blend of hop flavor with very little bitterness. The hop flavor is citric, with a focus on grapefruit initially. The middle gets more tropical and ends with a nice biscuit crispness. On the finish, a nice light grapefruit rind bitterness lingers a bit."
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured a dark gold body with good head and lace. The aroma is mostly hoppy with a little bit of grainy malts in there. These citric hops dominate the flavor profile but the beer is more fuller body and not quite smooth like some IPAs. Not much sweetness in this beer as it is mostly dry and hoppy. Easy finish and a good, hearty, filling beer worth sipping on."

"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass. This beer is a dark amber color and produces a nice, long lasting head. The taste is very hoppy, in fact more hoppy than I like. I hate IPAs, but I'd thought aid give an IPL a try. I don't hate it as much as the IPAs, but I'll stick with the original Boston Lager next time."
"Pours a clear light copper with over a finger of head that lingers for a decent amount of time. The nose is mildly hoppy. The malt profile is present, but relatively light in character. The hop bitterness is present on the finish. This is basically SA’s classic Boston Lager with a little less malt and a little more hops."
""

""
""
""

""

"O: This has a lot going for it, I'm just not sure why the palate tastes burnt given the rest of the beer is decent, but that makes me not a fan"

"This beer goes down easily with its lager lightness and relatively mild malt grain flavors. The hop aroma and flavor character provide the real character and uniqueness to this brew. It's not as aggressively hoppy like a West coast IPA nor as smooth as a classic Czech or German styled pilsner yet does a good job of combining these styles in an approachable way. No, it probably won't blow anyone's mind who likes a classic IPA or pilsner style by itself (well, maybe the pilsner lovers may find more in common with this hybrid brew), yet I'd wager most people wouldn't turn down having another if given a chance. Fine and refreshing."

"O - Really great hop flavor, especially in a beer with such moderate ABV. This is a great thirst quencher and I intend to use it as such."
""
""
""
"A solid “meh”, not too exciting lager with a little more hops than most, but still not close to an IPA."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a hazy golden yellow amber with a long lasting white head and lacing. Aroma and Taste of pine citrus hops, caramel malt, sweet fruity notes and mild bitterness, some light grapefruit tangy notes. A medium palate, crisp with moderate carbonation. Has a nice malt finish balance by pine citrus and slight tangy grapefruit notes. Has a bit of lager in it. Overall a good drinking brew."
""
""
"Overall: Pretty decent flavor overall, hit the spot for a hop craving."

""
""
""
""
""
"Poured from a bottle with a transparent amber color, plenty of bubbles, and a foamy, long-lasting white head. Has a grapefruit and pine aroma. Taste is the same, with a little bit of hops. Has a crisp medium-body feel with medium carbonation. This is a very nice session beer that doesn’t sit heavy on the stomach and tastes delicious."
""
""
""
"Frankly, it's a thin beer that has just-average IPA flavors and it just doesn't get to join the ""Awesome IPA"" family..."

"D: A decent IPL with some enjoyable hop flavors. Would not turn this one down as it was probably my favorite of the Hop Tour but it still leaves a little something more to be desired."
""
""
""
""
""
"O-This would be a beer I would purchase again and has a nice cold dry lager flavor."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The hoppy lager is a welcome attempt to do what IPA's do best. Promote hops while suppressing malts. This IPL is a rather effortless taste, even if somewhat underwhelming."
""
"O: Not bad at all. I can really appreciate the clean separation of malt and hop flavors in this beer."
"Number 3 on the Hop Tour. Pours a rich copper amber with a short lasting frothy white head that gives way to...well, nothing. The beer does have some legs and leaves a little lacing but on the whole is quite thin. The aroma is pleasant with a large amount of citrusy hops and a nice malty backbone. The flavor follows the nose with a hop forward bitterness and a generous amount of citrus and grassy notes. This is an enjoyable pour; nothing outstanding but a great beer on a hot day or after a long shift. Definitely enjoyable but not of note."

"ALOT of head. this beer poured with more head than beer at first. I'm not a fan AT ALL of IPAs so I thought I'd try an IPL, since I'm a lager fan. the aging didn't help at all, lol, I still don't like IPAs. I'm not sure YET, as to what makes it have that ""IPA"" flavor, I think it's the hops, but whatever it is, I don't like the hops flavor."

"O- This is a pretty good beer. Its on the lighter side, but is nicely balanced and flavorful. There was a nice toasty, bread-like character that went well with the west coast hops. The tart lemon flavor added a nice dimension as well. I can see this being a really good session beer."

"Grabbed a sixer for Thanksgiving. Pours from the bottle a mostly clear dark golden color with small white head. Aroma of bready malts, lemon peel, sweet honey, grapefruit. Smells like a malty DIPA. Flavor follows as expected, big bready malts, lemon peels, sweetness, really like a malty DIPA. Slick body, medium high carbonation, big flavor for only 5%. Not bad, but was hoping for a lighter on the malt body and bigger aromatic hop profile."
""
""
""
""
"This one tastes really good to me. Poured a nice golden iced-tea color with about 1/2"" of off-white head. Lots of tiny bubble trails from the bottom of the glass. I smell a good amount of grapefruit and other citrus. The grapefruit isn't as strong in the taste. Slight amount of pine in there. Mouthfeel is great. I wasn't expecting much from this beer, but it has turned out to be quite good."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-I quite enjoyed this beer. It drinks way above its 5% ABV and packs more than enough hoppy punch to go up against some of the better IPAs out there. There is a bit of grainy flavor in there to remind you that this is a lager, but I could definitely see drinking a few of these on a warm day next spring."
""
"Excellent beer! If only it wouldn't have been kept under fluorescent lights at the store. Poured at a good temperature with a decent, foamy, frothy, thick, long lasting, cream-colored head and plenty of lace. Color is a clear orange amber with loads of bubble trails. Aroma is hop, malt, fruit, bit of skunk. Flavor is like nose, largely loses the skunk, has a great balance between bitter, tang, and sweet right up front and dance around each other in the mouth. Body is spot on; ditto carbonation. Finish is like flavor, has good length and is great drinking! Hope to get more of this."
"Overall - It tasted just like the Boston Lager but with a pine aftertaste."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Taste / Palate: The flavor picks up all the hop notes from the nose and adds them to a nice bread base malt. It has a solid medium body with balanced carbonation and mellow bitter finish."

""
""
"Presentation: packaged in a custom twelve-ounce brown glass long neck bottle with a pry-off crown, served in a New Belgium Brewing chalice."

"Pleasantly surprised."
""
""
""
""
""

""
""
""
""
"Overall impression: A good beer with an identity crisis. Smells like an IPA, tastes like a pale ale, and claims to be a lager. I don't care what it is but it's a finely crafted beer and I'll gladly have another."
""
"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass. The smell was fantastic with a strong earthy scent. Every time I brought the glass up to taste I enjoyed the smell. Not much head but decent lacing. Nice gold color. Drinks easy with a lingering hoppyess. I can’t pick out flavors yet, but it’s good!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Had this beer once before and liked it very much so picked up a six to see if it as good as I originally thought. Very strong appearance with an excellent smell. Not quite the hoppy smell or the bitter bite of the typical IPA which is good and bad. Overall this is an excellent beer and one I like very much and will but anytime in the future. Sam Adams got this one right."
""
""
""
""
"O: This is a fun beer; I really like how complex and yet still crisp this lager is"
""
""
"Leave it to sam adams to mix these two beer styles so perfectly. This beer has tremendous flavor but is not the least bit harsh. it doesn't numb you with bitterness. It doesn't defeat you with a high abv. The mouthfeel is light to medium and the carbonation is perfect with a little bite to it. It is gentle enough and the lager character does indeed make it easy drinking."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I found this to be pretty enjoyable. Recommended if you're in the mood for something a little different."
""
""
""
"Light to medium bodied with nice carbonation. Smooth and easy to drink, with a grapefruit and floral hop aftertaste. A very nice India Pale Lager, which I will buy again."
""
""
""
"O-The knock is that as it warmed it went downhill. Drink cold."
"O: Overall good, not amazing.. Interesting, but not overwhelmingly good."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"For an American Pale Lager, this beer is quite something. Lots of flavor, but does not sacrifice any of its thirst-quenching attributes. A really nice beer from Boston Beer Co. Not designed to blow anyone away, but rather a good all-around lazing-around-the-TV-watching-a-ballgame beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Worth a try, to enjoy, and come to your own conclusion."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"There is a vague butterscotch note on the taste at first but it is quickly overtaken by the earthy hops and tropical fruitiness. Uniquely enjoyable for a pale lager."
""
""
""
"O - Nice beer from SA given the price. I enjoyed it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This was a very tasty beer, one of the best sam adams beers in my opinion."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Overall, pretty good. Better than I thought it was going to be actually, not because I am a Sam Adams hater (which I am not), but because I tend to not like lager styles. This is a tasty beer though. I wouldn't seek it out but I may drink it again if its the only non BMC on tap somewhere."
""
""
""
"D/O Drinkability is meh. Overall this is “as advertised:” on overly hopped Lager. I found myself wishing that it was a lager since I appreciate the taste of a standard lager over this rather gimicky beer. 2.0"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a nice clean/clear golden amber color, nice carbonation, with a very nice one-finger creamy white head, with some nice sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, with some hop notes, sweet. The taste is malty, slightly hoppy. Medium body with a dry/bitter finish. Overall a tasty brew, but would probably not buy again, we'll see."
""
""
""
"O: tasty and solid. I'd drink again. Not memorable but not bad either. I'd prefer more body."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

""

"I highly recommend."
"A very crisp lager that holds a good amount of hoppy flavor, even at its lower ABV. Reminds me of Peekskill Hop Common, another delicious hoppy lager. A really enjoyable beer that Sam Adams has brewed."
"O - This is a tasty but not a challenging brew. Unlike Victory Prima Pils, this brew doesn't let you know it is first and foremost a lager. I enjoyed it but it won't make it into rotation."
""
"Seems like a good summer session beer, but with a little extra hop flavor – not a bad thing. Reminds me of Iron Goat’s ISA. Not bad at all."

"O-Samuel Adams makes a great beer once again! I enjoyed this lager, but would have never guessed it was a lager had it not said on the bottle."
""
""
""
"This is a pretty nice drink that while not too surprising is something I could drink six of and still enjoy. Though I enjoy the Noble Pils better than this when I want a hoppy Sam Adams lager, this Double Agent IPL bridges the gap between lager and ale quite nicely. Give it a try, you may enjoy it."
""
""
""
"O: I wouldn’t call this a superb beer, but I would say it’s one of my favorites from Sam Adams. Put me in a bar or restaurant where this is on draft and I’ll be a happy man."

"3.81/5.00"

"Drinkability- It was ok, not the best but still ok. It was very light. I don't usually like stuff this light. Good chance I won't be drinking it again but I don't really like stuff that light. Probably pretty good cold on a hot day though"
"Poured a nice amber with a one finger white head. Very pretty. Scents of pine and citrus, heavy on grapefruit, with some very faint lager fruitiness. Quite enticing. Flavor is of citrus, grapefruit pith and grapefruit heavy, pine notes dominate on the finish which is quite bitter. Malt and lager yeast flavors are minimal, leaving the hops to dominate. Mouthfeel is light bodied with high carbonation, very much like a lager. This beer is excellent, showcasing the West Coast hops, with minimal interference from malty sweetness. I thought I would have to homebrew an IPL, but apparently I wasn't the only one to think of trying this, and it seems to work quite well. A hit by Boston Beer Company."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"When I can taste what I smell or smell what I taste, I have convinced myself with this brew that that's what I look for in a beer. Although it pours a relatively nice golden color with a frothy lightly tanned, white head (good lacing all the way down), what blew me away was its odor. You are assaulted with a mix of lemon, orange, pears, peaches, apples, and other citrusy scents. The same goes for the taste - I think I can taste them all and then some. As a lager, it also poses as a Indian Pale Ale (not something I really like) but it balances the fruity taste just right. I was simply blown away from the start - gotta hand it to Sam Adams..."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Remarks: not bad overall for an American IPA"
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours to a generous white head and excellent lacing. Bright copper color. Aroma is hop-dominant with citrus and pine prominent. No esters. Flavor is clean and lager-like as advertised with a hoppy finish. Mouthfeel is light and easy. Overall, a good tasting hoppy lager that defies style conventions."
""
""
"O: Looks and smells great. Just wish they could have gotten more of the awesome fruity boquet into the taste of the beer. The lager yeast and the West Coast hop varietals don't seem to get along very well."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I am left wanting more. Pleasantly surprising and easily the best rendition of an IPL or hoppy pilsner I have tried. Sorry Victory and Jack Abby. Kudos to BBC and all apologies for assuming an affordable quaff can't be top shelf. Thanks for setting me straight. Round two-ding!"
"O - another solid offering from Sam Adams, hoppy and refreshing. Good when paired with food"
"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, Double Agent is a clear peachy-orange color with a two-finger, soapy white head. The nose is as advertised, all west-coast hops. Piney and citrusy, pleasant boquette. The name Double Agent is well used, the hop flavor and aroma is there but the lingering bitterness you would expect from an IPA is abscent. Seems like a good ""wet hopped"" beer. Intense flavor, none of the bitterness - well done. Mouthfeel is medium to full in body with a minimal, inactive carbonation. Overall, this is possibly one of my new favorites, I hope SA keeps it around for a while."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The Rest: There were two of these in the mix pack, and I drank the first one the other day and didn't think it was anything special. After sitting down to review the second one, I'm much more impressed. It would be a decent IPA in it's own right, but the unique, lager finish really makes this an interesting beer."

"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a 14 oz ""pint"" glass. Pours a translucent orange with a small white head. Smells of floral hops with hints of pine. Tastes of earthy and piney hops, but with a nice lager taste. A little over carbonated, but light bodied goes down great. Overall, a very good beer."
""

"Atmosphere is really nice. Nice hue, plenty of carbonation, great head, lots of persistent lacing. Nose is grainy and piney. Malt flavor with a biting hop, offset with something of an out-of-place twang. Overall, this is an interesting, and good quaff."

"The best I have had to date of these hoppy agers. Floral hops. Thanks Americo for sharing the growler. Herbal, somewhat A nice mouthfeel. lacy and creamy head on a golden body, a dry and hoppy finish. Citrus, good drinkability. A good hoppiness, great for the summer."
""
""
""
"A successful beer to this drinker. I enjoyed this one more than any other Sam Adams beer I have had, and I have had quite a few. Wish more brewers would do hoppy lagers. Not enough of them on the market."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A decent beer. Not much different than other SA beers but a nice change of pace from a traditional pale lager."
""
""
""
"This is a real enjoyable beer, glad I picked this up."
""
"Overall: A really new and refreshing beer. I'm glad I decided to finally try one of these. The appearance and smell are great (if a bit subdued), and the mouthfeel is perfect. Taste is my biggest complaint, and of course that is an important one. I love the initial taste but there is some definite funky earth stuff going on that I am not a fan of. I would easily drink this one again, but wouldn't necessarily seek it out."
""
"Good flavorful ale-like lager, very enjoyable and sessionable. Would have it again for sure."
""
"O- Pretty well done based on the intentions. This is a hoppy lager with some floral and tropical notes and it seems like that was the exact intention."
"Overall - actually surprised how much I'm enjoying this offering. Pretty delicious lager."
""
""
""
"Highly recommended; in fact, @buzzlitebeer and I plan to brew something like this as a model."
""
""
"Bright copper, clear with a two finger tall white head of a mix of fine and coarse bubbles. The nose is nearly all west coast hops, pine, grapefruit and floral not much of the malt in the smell. The taste is much like the smell with the hop flavors coming out front here the grapefruit really takes over. Along with the hop flavors there is a pretty good amount of bitterness on the level of a strong pale ale or weak IPA. Biscuity caramel malts are in there as well to provide a base but it is clear that the hops are the main focus here. The mouthfeel is interesting while the hops make one think of an IPA body is all lager. Light body with a nice clean, crispness that you just cant get in an ale. There is a good bit of carbonation in there that combined with the bitterness keep things tingly. The finish is a touch sweet with lasting bitterness that lingers on the tongue. Overall I'm a fan of this one, although it is kind of playing tricks on my mind. A good combination of a nice hoppy ale and a crisp clean lager."

"O: Surprisingly good offering from BBC. I'm not surprised by them trying a hoppy IPL given the explosion of Jack's Abby in the last year or two. This certainly isn't a hoponious union but it's like the 60minute version. Balanced, smooth, drinkable. Not bad!"
"Clear solid gold color with a grand, fluffy head that deflates to a thin, tight-bubbled cap. Smells floral and citrusy over a bready base. Oily, zesty citrus flavor; a crisp hoppiness that becomes dry, grassy, and a little resinous before giving way to some cracker-like malts. The moderate bitterness lingers well into the finish. Fairly light bodied and snappy, making it easy to suck down. Not really any lager qualities coming through...this could pass as one of those hip, new session IPAs everyone's talking about."
""
""
"Overall: Meh. It's like a double Pils, maybe not even that, just a really hoppy Pils. A bit boring truth be told. Don't know what I was expecting from Sam Adams, this is like a restrained, focus group tested version of daring innovation."
""
""
"A highly drinkable beer, and definitely more interesting than the typical lager."
"Sampled from a Stella Artois chalice. A nice frothy off white head is roused with the pour, nice lacing as it settles. Clear deep gold with small bubbles of carbonation rising. Intense hoppy nose...getting alot of Simcoe at first whiff. I'm gonna blaspheme here and admit I'm more of an ""old school"" hop guy...Simcoes and the newer varieties don't do it for me like Cascades, Saaz and Bullions do but anyways, quite a noseful here. The taste follows the aroma, lots of hops, some sweetness from the malt but the hop is the main attraction here. Finshes on a piney note backed with some sweetness and light tropical fruit. I don't care what Sam calls it, to me it has a hoppier Pale Ale written all over it. Nice as a one-off purchase but I won't be a repeat customer of this."

"O: Tasty, goes down very easily, not too filling, mild kick, this is a nice poundable beer to drink for a long time."

"Being that boston beer makes pretty safe beers, this is even a little bit of a stretch for them and doesn't work perfectly so I'd be surprised to see other breweries take it to the next level only to make a sloppier beer."

"Overall, this is the best beer Sam Adams makes. Easy to drink, great hops flavors, and smooth as can be. I will reiterate the sentiments of others here, Jim Koch, please keep making this."
"overall i would say that this is a overly hopped lager that SA does a nice job with, in the tradition of their past hop heavy lagers. i find an ""empty"" spot somewhere in the body/mouthfeel that really sticks out to me and distracts just a bit. i think this would pair with some crackers and cheese, popcorn or other bar snacks just to keep it interesting."

"O: This is easily one of my biggest beer surprises this year, if not of all-time. Double Agent is tasty, easy drinking, and makes you want to keep putting glass to lips. The single best beer I've had from Sam Adams without a doubt. Can't wait to put a sixer of this on ice during the summer. Note to Jim Koch, keep making Double Agent IPL!"

"Pours a bright copper crystal clear hue with an off white cream colored head forms thick, cloudy textured large bands of lace as it settles. Aroma straight up hops, citrus peels, cut grass, even some grapefruit action. It's like a light IPA, or IPL in this case smooth breadiness malt back bone action sweeps the bittering hops in the background, citrus, floral notes, and cut grass make up the flavors I'm getting in the hops. A nice blend of a lighter more sessionable hoppy beer. Mouthfeel has a medium to light body with hop oils texture in there a nice bitter finish carbonation moves the beer on very well, this is really good with different foods. Overall a style that Sam Adams should keep around I could picture having this around on hand more often."
"Overall found this to be enjoyable highly drinkable, very flavorful, can see buying more of this as the temps warm up. I know some will knock it because its a Sam Adams but certainly worth a try."
""
"This is perfect with meaty sandwiches, bratwurst, or gyros (to help balance the feta), but also a great introduction to the more hop heavy world of IPAs and such. A great palate cleanser, perhaps your third or forth to wake up those taste buds. Cheers!"

"This did not act like a lager on the pour, producing a massive, dense two-plus fingers of tawny head that formed following a cascading-like action. Color was a deep-gold with NE-plus quality clarity and Croesus and Midas sat across from me, rubbing their hands together. The nose was grapefruit and pine and thanks to my deep inhalation, my eyes watered a little at its intensity. My mouth also began to water, but that was a separate issue. I could not wait any longer and went for my first sip. Mouthfeel was medium but the hops were intense on the tongue, burning away the old, dead taste buds and paving the way for a lot of taste. The taste showed that the hops had not been squandered, instead, intermingling and giving a real bite to a style that can often be unobtrusive. Finish was very dry, just the way this hophead likes his beers. I really like what they are doing with hops up there in Boston!"
""
""
"I really enjoyed this lager. But, because of the aggressive IPA style hops there is really no style to compare this beer to. Overall a solid brew for the hophead in all of us."
"The veer looked very nice in the Pilsner glass I chose, with a golden colored clear body, a two finger thick head, and lots of fine carbonation. The smell was typical of a West Coast IPA, with lots of grapefruit, orange peel, and some pine, as well as some spicy smells. The taste was juicy, citric, very clean, and had some bubblegum notes in mid sip, with clean finish. I drank the beer warm from the grocery store yesterday, and it taste a bit lifeless. With time to chill today, the beer was much more lively. The mouthfeel was very soft, aided by the pillowy head, and about a billion finely textured carbonation bubbles. This is one the best beers to ever come out of the Sam Adams brewery collections."
""
""
"While enjoyable, this IPL won't be taking the place of any of my favorite APAs or IPAs. I do prefer it over the Sam Adams Alpine Spring, though."
""
""
"Well balanced with a lingering but mild bitterness at the end of the crisp finish. Very drinkable beer, I will buy it again."
""
""
"Taste-Faint, piney hops, mellow citrus zest, light-bodied but pretty flavorfull for a lager. Would make a nice""crossover"" craft brew for the newby craft beer drinker."
""
""
""
""
"D - Fairly easy to drink. Wish there was a bigger hop presence."
""
""
""
""
"The brewery can call it an ""India Pale Lager"" if they must; to me, this is simply a flavorful, sessionable and refreshing lager that I will enjoy often during the warm months ahead."
""
""
""
""
""
"Not an equal to the Imperial Pilsner of a few years past."
"I liked the hops qualities of this beer but the light soapy, for lack of a better way to describe it, aspects of this beer were a turn off for me."
""
""
"O- Overall, I really enjoyed this one. I purchased this as part of a mixed pack with other Sam Adams beers but this one really stands out as something I would puchase again in the future on its own."
"This sounded like an interesting concept, a heavily hopped lager. I just don't think it worked. The hops seemed odd with the level of carbonation and crispness of this lager. Gave the beer a nice aroma of citrus and flowers but seemed to clash with the taste. Stick to Boston Lager if you want a refreshing lager or just pick up an IPA if you are in the mood for hops."
"12 ounce bottle into lager glass, best before August 2013. Pours fairly crystal clear golden amber color with a 1 finger dense white head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of grapefruit, lemon zest, orange zest, tangerine, pineapple, floral, light pine, light bread, and floral earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance and complexity of hop notes; a bit weak on strength. Taste of grapefruit, lemon zest, orange zest, orange rind, tangerine, pineapple, floral, light pine, light bread, and floral earthiness. Fair amount of floral citrus bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, citrus zest, pineapple, floral, light pine, and floral earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and complexity of hop flavors; with a moderate malt backbone and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth and fairly sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with hardly any warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a very nice hoppy lager. Great balance and complexity of hop flavors; and very smooth to drink. A very enjoyable offering."
""
"Overall a decent brew yet a bit nondescript as well. Lacking in bitterness vs. what I expected from the label, what with 'double' and 'IPL' mentioned, though I'm referring largely to the 'IPL' here as double is obviously not an ABV reference. And at 5.0% it drinks like a citrusy Pale Ale. Low carbonation is surely a deterring factor for this particular bottle. A decent Pale Lager yet not representative of expections."

""
""
""
"O: Overall this was alright, might have liked it a bit more if it wasn't a IPA, but not too bad. Would probably have again but wouldn't seek it out."

"O- Not a bad beer and you cant go wrong with too many sam adams. a nce fail safe if out at a bar and its on tap with BMC's."
""

""
""
""
""
"Overall, it's a good beer. Very easy to drink and almost a session beer so in the summer you can enjoy a cooler full of them. Kind of strange, but a nice change of pace."
"Pours a transparent, pale orange color wih a thin but lingering head. Citrusy, west coast IPA hop aroma, pleasant and familiar somehow (Long Trail IPA?). Very smooth and easy drinking; definitely a lager in that regard. Beyond that one trait, it's more IPA than Lager for sure. Hop character dominates, but not too sticky on the palate. Definitely worth a try on a spring day."
""
""
"Served in a standard shaker on 4/6/13. Pours a golden amber color with a strong 1cm of fizzy head that evaporates into islands of fuzz on the top of the beer. It leaves thin lacing that persists rather well. The beer is very clear and has absolutely no haze to it with great light penetration. The nose is a gorgeous citrus hop bomb recalibrated with that biscuit-like breadiness of a good lager. It really does open your eyes and I found myself very impressed with how well they worked well together. The taste was very good. It was crisp like a good lager, tasting of warm baked bread, but it has a strong resin and citurs punch as well. It was full of lime peel, resinous pine flavor, and a strong flavor of oranges and magoes. Very good and clean on the palate, perfect carbonation overall. This is a very good offerening from a very good beer company. This gives you the hop flavor a hop-head would love at a very sessionable 5% and the twist of the lager yeast just makes it nice and refreshing."
"Heard some chatter so I picked up a bottle of this. Thick orange color, good suds. Smell is quite hoppy, citrus, floral, pine, almost west coast. Flavor matches the smell pretty well but not as fruity as an IPA. Crisp lager finish. This was a solid beer, low alcohol, strong hops. I went back for another sixer not too long after."
""
""
"Better then average hop package, especially for the style. Easy drinking and pleasing brew, decent sessioner at 5%. Nothing special, but would work just fine in a pinch, sort of a hoppy brew with training wheels. Good one to encourage a hoppy beer newbie to check out."
"O - nice attempt. I have never searched this combo out, and not sure it completely works, but it may open up some lager only palates out there."
""
""
""
""
""
""
" The taste has a genlty herbal but not really grassy taste more subtle and finessed with smooth bitterness blending with light citrus flavor and a pleasant lemon accent with mild dry herbal hop mixed with a peppery quality reminiscent of saaz with some slight grapefruit tinges in the back and a pretty dry finish flavor wise. This is a great hoppy lager which is smooth enough to warrant a second taste and very drinkable with nice hop flavor and subtlety w/ residual bitterness that brings you back after the swallow."
""
"Nice Job on this one. I really enjoy this beer and hope that it is one I will be able to purchase year round. These are becoming harder to find in 12 packs, I'm guessing thats because it was a one time brew. The case I bought the other day has a best buy date of July 2013, I'm guessing they were brewed around january. They still are tasting very good to me."
""
"Judging it as a hoppy pale ale. Solid, i could see this working in the future. Although, i don't really get the point of lagering a beer with so much fruity hoppiness."
""
"O - I have had hoppy lagers in the past, but this was done better. Malty, nutty, and grain charateristics of a lager mesh well with the floral, fruity, pine of the hops. This is a crisp, refreshing beer with a low ABV, well suited for good weather outdoor drinking. I am glad I gave this a try."
""
""
""
"Overall: A really good spin on a lager. The hops make it seem like a solid West Coast IPA."
""
"O- This beer is a pretty easy-drinker, and the addition of extra hops makes it all the more enjoyable."
""
"If I ever wanted a lager, this is the lager that I'd choose. In between the lager and the IPA, it leans closer to the zest of an IPA. It has such a refreshing, citrusy smell and taste. The smell and taste really is dead-on grapefruit. This is definitely one of my favorite non-Imperial Series Sam Adams brews. I would get this again."
"Dried orange taste, bready pale malt, lingering herbal hop bitterness. LIght bodied, reminiscent of a light bodied IPA, so they achieved that at least. However the IPA model is fairly dull here. Seems as if it could use a fair amount of tweaking to improve, though the product isn't at all bad, just a little uninspired."
"O: Overall heard alot of good things about this, i usually like sam adams and thier easy approach to drinkability while maintaining just the right amount of flavor, balance, and style regards. An easy drinking ipa, though hardcore ipa fiends may find this a little under-par either by bitterness or prejudice of brewery still worthy a single try."

" A good sessionable beer based on its 5% ABV. And it would be an excellent paring with food, since it is not as overpowering as a strong IPA style. I could down 4-5 of these pretty quikly- It makes for a nice Spring/Summer type beer."
""
""
"Overall - I was surprised how much I enjoyed this."

"O- Quite impressive to see hops being used in such a plentiful and effective manner by a brewery who usually keeps them toned down. A Sam Adams beer I would not mind having a few of."
""
""
"Pours a slightly hazy orange with a foamy orange-tan head that settles to a partial film on top of the beer. Thin streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grapefruit juice, citrus fruit, and citrus zest. Taste is much the same with malty and citrus zest flavors on the finish. There is a medium amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer with some nice hoppy aromas and flavors."

"O. Mild and unassuming, but a good session-like lager."
"O: While this beer might smell and taste similar to an IPA, you can definitely tell it's a lager by the lack of crispness and clean mouthfeel. In this aspect, I thought this was a very unique and enjoyable beer. The drinkability also makes it rather sessionable."
""
"O- I really enjoyed this beer and could see this becoming my summer/outdoors go-to if available in 6packs this summer. The hops add just enough flavor, yet doesn't overpower those traditional lager flavors. A welcomed style!"
"Cheers!"
"Surprised. A nice sessionable APA. Well done."
""
"I have to score this pretty high since it's a very tasty brew in a run-down neighborhood of a beer style. From a 12 oz bottle in the inevitable mixed 12-pack bought at a local supermarket."
""
""
""
""
"Final Thoughts: I'm not sure how fresh the bottle is because it only has a mark for when it will be best by (July). However, I tend to think any hop forward beer tastes the best within a month of being bottled/canned. After that length of time it's possible that the dank onion and garlic flavors could be more perceptible as the citrus/tropical fruit characteristics fade. That being said, I enjoyed Double Agent IPL if for no other reason than it was a great idea by Samuel Adams to create a super hoppy lager. I think it's an interesting avenue to go down that hasn't been experimented with nearly enough. Would I drink it again? Yes, the fresher the better."
"I give this the same B to B+ that I always seem to give sam adams regular releases. its good not great, feels more mass produced than crafted, but that said, is still a very enjoyable brew. the pour is a little more orange than the standard lager, and the head is an inch high and bone white but doesn't last long. smells hoppy, really hoppy actually, oily fruity hops, like gummy bears, with the familiar smell of a lager yeast. the flavor is less hoppy than the nose, which is okay in this setting. the beer is crisp and clean and very refreshing, but is lacking something. I think all well hopped lagers will be lacking for awhile, as I recently had humulus from the bruery and it blew my head off while setting the bar for the style. this one comes off a little thin and contrived, but its good nonetheless. lighter feel, great carbonation, medium hoppy finish, a good beer to ease in the warmer weather, but don't come into it expecting to be floored."
""
""
"Burst of pine greets you upon opening the bottle, comes out hazy golden with a creamy white head. The malt holds it own against the intense American hops giving it good balance. Medium light body with a bite to it. Overall- can't tell you what the lager yeast brings to it, you could have told me it was an IPA and believed you."

"Mouthfeel: Clean, crisp, and light bodied"
""
"Taste/feel: It's a Boston Lager in IPA form, I think... and it's fantastic. It's a lot like an IPA on the front, but the finish is sweet, with that classic biscuit/cracker aftertaste that I get from Boston Ale/Lager, and now this. The mouthfeel is of about medium carbonation with a slight creamy feel. Truly one of the, if not THEE, best Samuel Adams beers that I've had. I hope this is a year round offering that's available in six-packs. $8.49 for a six pack? Sign me up."

"O - Meh at best. I was excited to try this beer, and it did not fulfil my expectations. Does not have the bold and varied flavors promised, but it is at least a decent price, and fairly drinkable."
""

"Overall: A very hoppy lager makes you think for a second ""am I drinking an IPA?", pretty rich but nothing really that would separate it from the rest. It's definitely worth grabbing and depending on availability it's an easy go to. Salud!"

"The hops stay alive and kickin' throughout the entire mouthfeel. Prickly, pithy, snappy. Always herbal. Plenty of bitterness. I'm not sure if these are just a bunch of noble hops of or not, but they are pretty potent, without obscuring what makes this a lager. Dry, hoppy, lagery."

"12oz bottle, pours golden with a frothy off-white head, excellent retention with tons of carbonation helping it holds steady, along with some nice lacing as it fades down. Aromas are fresh citrusy hops with grapefruit pith, biscuity malt, pine. Tastes are biscuity malt, toasty grain, lager yeast, grapefruit pith again, finishes insanely clean. Nice, smooth medium body with plenty of creaminess and carbonation. Overall, nice idea and a solid beer from Sam Adams."
"D/O: The heir-apparent to what was Noble Pils, this hoppy beer is redolent with Columbus hops qualities. That said, the hops are not unappealing--there is not a whiff of plastic or chemicals that might sometimes be associated with late additions of the cultivar. It may be a cleaner beer than Noble Pils, which could be a feather in its cap considering its style category. Clean does not mean balanced, however. This beer puts a potent emphasis on its hops qualities."
""

"O: In my opinion, one of the better new beers that Sam Adams has introduced in the last couple of years. I like the combination of APA/IPA like flavors blended with those of a lager. Easy to drink and enjoyable, matches well with food."

"O - A great, smooth, hoppy beer from SA. Definitely sessionable where the bitterness and taste aren't too pronounced and the finish is fairly clean. I'm impressed."

""
"Overall I really like this beer. It has a lot of characteristics that all work in conjunction with each other and make for a great, all-season, average ABV beer. Maybe the best beer Sam Adams has out right now..."
"Overall / Drinkability: Well, it drinks exactly as the brewer meant it - a combination of a west coast IPA and a lager. I'll give it high marks for creativity and for meeting exactly what they described it to be...except for the smoothness of the lager. That's missing because I think the hop wallop you get with this beer you need the higher level of sweetness from an ale yeast + caramel malts to balance against the hop bitterness. The lager is under there, but it's not sweet enough and when that sweetness comes out between the hop start and finish, it's odd...like its artificial or saccharine. So interesting concept, but for me, it's not working. One is enough - and I had a hard time finishing this one. Nice looking beer though - that lacing you get with the hops is certainly pleasant to look at."

"This is a light bodied brew with a modest amount of carbonation. Just like the name suggests, this is a sort of hybrid fresh and hoppy pale ale blended into a lager. I gotta admit, I am a fan of this. It has plenty of fresh juicy hop flavoring but that crisp and clean lager feel. This is something I would not only drink again but I would buy this to drink several of while doing yard work or other yard activities during warmer weather. The best of both worlds in each previously mentioned style in my opinion."

"O -- Why? I mean, why not just brew another APA? This beer is really lager in name only -- whether or not it uses bottom-fermentation or cold aging -- its hop profile and malt body place it directly into the APA range. It doesn't have a smooth malt backbone as most lagers do, it's not clean in the finish as a lager ought to be. It's obvious that BBC is trying to reach all of the lager nay-sayers to show them a lager can be made to their palate -- but there really is no reason since there are plenty of Pale Ales to make that contingent happy."
"Poured into a pokal a clear medium golden with a nice looking one finger fluffy white crown that left multiple chunks of lace behind as it settles very slowly.Grapefruit rind and piney hops stand out in the nose,like an old school ipa,light toasted grain comes into play as well.Flavors start with a punch citric hops with a more pronounced malty bread-like presence,it finishes a little watery though wich nipped everything in the bud a little.A good beer,take away the watery finish and this outstanding,as is it's still pretty good."

"Pours very clear light copper, virtually no foam. Empty Smell, touch of pine., but minor at best. Taste opens hop, evolves into citrus, gets a touch sweet and then finishes quick. Little lemon touch at the end. If the goal was a hoppy lager, mission accomplished. Interesting but not extraordinary."

"Poured this American Pale Lager from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. This lager poured a clear copper color, produced a nice white head, very nice retention and ample lacing stuck on the glass. The aroma consisted of toasted pale malt, pine and citrus. Medium bodied, there is a foundation of toasted pale malted grain, fresh pine needles, citrus and spicy pepper. Smooth, bitter and dry finish. This is an awesome beer, well balanced you get the smoothness of a lager but with hop flavor and bitterness. The dry finish begs you to take another sip. One of the best American Lager's I have sampled."
""
""
"Not sure when this Hopology Collection started, but this was an impressive introduction to this series. It is extremely easy to drink and to me a session beer that would be perfect year round. I put this right behind New Belgium’s Shift Pale Lager as the best and tastiest new beers in this category. I definitely recommend trying this beer."

"O – A hoppy hoppy hopppy lager, the hops are there, but its still covered by a sticky sweet lager body. It's drinkable, and worth a try. Good thinking just putting two in a sampler though."
""

""
"Pours a clear amber with a thin, creamy off-white head. Nice lacing that clings to the glass. The smell is a hint of citrus peel. Taste begins with some toffee sweetness, followed by some some citric flavors, then a pounding of pine cones and grapefruit in the finish. Surprisingly hoppy for a SA beer. Mouthfeel is good. Overall quite a nice beer. Plenty of hop flavor here."
""
"D - An interesting hybrid. It has a lager-like smoothness to the malt profile, but the hops bring fruity, spicy notes that mark it as something else. It might have benefited from a touch more bitterness to balance the thick malt and really drive the hop character home."
"O: Not bad, but not that good either. I'm really partial to hopped up lagers and while this one smelled really nice, it just didn't quite live up overall. Decent drinkability, but I wouldn't get this again."
""
"Overall (4.0): This is a very, very solid beer. Doesn’t blow you out of the water in any respect, but they got what they were going for and made a very pleasing, quenching lager with a respectable hops character. What’s especially cool about this beer is that I could easily see it pleasing folks who are accustomed to light, swishy lagers as much as people who like old-school craft beer like SNPA and Boston Lager. So, good for Sam Adams—if any beer bridges the divide, as it were, this might be it."
""

"O: Probably the hoppiest lager I have ever had, yet well balanced and highly drinkable. A pale lager hopped up to the level of an Amer. Pale Ale."

"O - This is another good solid brew BBC/SA can add to their recent efforts. While there's not a whole lot of IPL's around, this might inspire other breweries to take a stab at it.

I look forward to buying this in summer and fall to enjoy."

"Poured from a bottle into a tumbler pint, the beer is a bright, orange-hued yellow coloring with a steady flow of carbonation and a filmy, white, clingy head. Aromas of resiny hops and a toasty grain backbone. Tangy and bitter hops in the nose, with a touch of tropical and citrus. Smells good. Flavors of toasted bread, with tropical fruit sweetness and a touch of peppery and bitter hops. Balanced, and tangy throughout. Sweet and bitter balanced throughout, with a slightly hoppy and dry aftertaste. Smooth, slightly drying finish. Different style, and pretty tasty."
"Poured into a Samuel Adams perfect pint glass from a 12 ounce bottle. The beer pours clear golden with a thick, slowly dissipating white head. There are lots of tiny rising streaming bubbles in the beer. A path of lacing creeps down the glass as the head retreats. The aroma is of piney, resinous, grassy, and citrus type hops with some caramel notes from the malt. Make no mistake about it. The aroma is hop forward and the dankness was pretty apparent even when the bottle was just cracked open. The flavor is of a sessionable IPA with lager characteristics, which is what it should be since it is a lager. The hops are quite bright and forward with the pine, resin, grassy, and citrus flavors that were detectable in the nose. It has that grapefruit type flavor along with some tropical fruit. The malt backbone is also present with some caramel and biscuit type notes. The body is light to medium with moderate carbonation. The finish is crisp and slightly dry. There's a pleasant hoppy aftertaste that lingers in the mouth after each sip. This is an excellent beer."

"12oz bottle with a Best Before Date notched at July 2013. Pours a clear light amberish gold with virtually no head. Good amount of lacing. Smells pretty good. The aroma is of spicy and citrus hops. Hints of pine as well. The taste is of spicy and piney hops. Biscuity. Good amount of hop bitterness. Really drinkable. Resinous, bitter finish. Mouthfeel is very light and crisp. This is a perfect balance of hops and drinkability. This was a nice surprise to find in the Mix 12 pack. Hopefully this one finds its way into its own 6 pack. Overall, worth seeking out."
""
"O: This beer has been compared to Hoponius Union around these parts. The comparison is a bit unfair, in my opinion. This is a different ball of wax. The bitter, West-coast influenced hop profile is there, but like Latitude 48, it has a bigger malt backbone to anchor it. It's a good beer, but I think the drinkability suffers just a tad due to the heftier malt body. Still my pick as the best beer from the Spring Thaw variety pack."

"O: I see why my friend didn't like this because he doesn't like anything hoppy. Really good stuff. I'm struggling to come up with anything clever to write. Oh well, I guess after 1100+ reviews, I've learned they can't all be witty."
"Very well done! The hop character of an IPA with a smoothness of a lager."
""
"Samuel Adams really outdid themselves with this one. Reminds me of the highly ranked APAs, especially due to it's tropical nature. I'm convinced that if this wasn't a Sam Adams beer it would be rated 10 points higher. Recommendable."
""
"Aroma is very nice, with assertive, complex flavoring hops and a light malt backbone. Flavor falls a bit short, offering less complexity and a lack of bitterness for the style, which is ok by me."

"O: This is a good beer no doubt. Comparing it to the best IPL - Humulus Lager, this beer gets its butt kicked. Enjoy it for what it is, but this isn't a beer to make anyone go crazy with hop euphoria."
""
"(O)- I do not have a ton of experience with this particular style, but this showcases the hops quite well and is definitely easy to polish off a few of them without loosing interest."
""
""

"This is a double agent! This lager is bursting with fruit flavor. This could easily pass as an ale. Tons of flavor packed into a sessionable 5.00 ABV. This is one of the most impressive beers I've had this year. Hats off to Jim Koch for this awesome beer."
""
"I poured this average beer IPA whatever!! into my tumbler at 45 degrees. To my delight it poured a monster creamy head that piled up over the rim of the glass. The 2nd Sam Adams of the night to do so! The beer was a goldy straw color. The smell was defiantly piney as suggested on the bottle. More like a spruce I would say. The head went away very fast as did my liking of the beer. Way too hoppy. I will not buy again."
""
""
""
"Overall - True to it's name, though it sounds better than what's actually presented here. Malts are near absent, and when presented with the forward citrus hop profile, it comes across as somewhat hollow. All in all, it's decent, but if I'm looking for a hoppy brew, I'm reaching for an assertive APA or a nice IPA."
""
""
""
"12 oz bottle. Pours deep golden with long lasting, foamy, white head and lively carbonation. Aroma is of orange, citrusy hops and bready malt. Body is medium and slightly crisp. Citrusy hops, bready and caramel malt some cotton candy fill the moth. Finish is long IPA like. There is some mismatch of flavors but, on the whole, it is good brew."
""
""
""
"Overall - Pretty good beer. Nice mix of ipa and lager, and it works. Rather flavorful being 5%, and really smooth and drinkable. The balance is nice also, makes this even more enjoyable. Would recommend and drink again."
""
"O/D-Sam Adams did a nice job with this one. Its not on the same tier as some of the best Jack's Abby brews (Hoponius Union and Kiwi Rising) but its certainly delicious. I think the IPL has plenty of potential and this beer is excellent evidence of my belief."
""
"Overall- A decent enough beer. Better than the standard IPA but nothing special."
""
"I've never had a lager that worked so well with hops. Sam Adam's has always been great with lagers IMO and this really proves it. I would easily compare this to Daisy Cutter or DayTime in hop profile. The lager yeast is a real advantage and makes this beer incredibly smooth and easy drinking."
""
"Golden straw appearance with decent head. Really hoppy aroma--smells like an IPA. Initially it tastes like an IPA and then you get hit with that lager taste. Really hoppy of course and the grapefruit notes are readily apparent. To someone who doesn't really like IPA it tastes like an overly hoppy fruity lager or an overly stated pale ale. Finishes a bit more bitter."
"Overall- A very nice drinking and hoppy brew. Quite tasty and delicious."
""
""
""
"O: If I rated to style, this would be around a 4.5 or so - I don't know if there's a better pale lager out there (and obviously I haven't had anything from Jack's Abby, either). In terms of personal preference, it does a good job of showing off the hop profile, but it's niggles keep it from reaching greatness."
"O- Nice effort by Sam Adams. Drinkable and not at all unpleasant. For a strange style, this is a nice beer."
""
"Pretty damn good for a 5% ABV lager - this is something you could definitely session with. Not the tastiest thing on the planet, but it's certainly worth the price and content for the low alcohol tax."
"O - I love it. I would look for it and buy it. I got this bottle out of the Sam Adams Spring Sampler pack and its my favorite by far. I had never had an IPL before. Kudos to Boston Beer Company for making this one available."
""
"This will be an excellent option in the summer months, especially at this price."
""
"O: Big flavors for a 5% ABV, crazy. More of a hopped up pilsner than a ""IPL"". I like this alot though, one of the best sam offerings, especially for the hop forward beers. Like a munich helles with a complex mix of west coast ipa hops. Europe meets cali."
"12oz. bottle served in a standard pint. Best before July 2013 notched on the label. Pours a light copper hue with a translucent clarity and a fizzy, one inch, bright white head that quickly sizzles and pops as it recedes into a sudsy film. Nose reveals light, toasted malts with a slightly sweet character, citrus notes and a hint of earthiness. Taste consistent with nose; however, citrus character is expressed more as acidity than any specific fruit. Malt profile also comes off a little less sweet; however, light, earthy bitterness is still evident towards the back. Mouthfeel is light-medium in body (but closer to light) with a lively, almost prickly, carbonation and a semi-dry finish. Overall, a pleasant, easy-drinking APL. Nothing really stands out per se, but I wouldn't pass one up if offered. Definitely worth experiencing."
"O - This is a clean easy drinking IPA. Not the most exciting but for someone who is just getting into drinking IPA's this one would be a good on to try, because its a easy clean drinking beer. I could see sessioning this one when it becomes warmer outside. I might have to try that, cheers."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - this is fine, easy drinking, nothing special. Smells nice."
""
"IP...L? Yes, this brew actually delivers on the strange combination!"
"So this is just a quite hop forward lager? Okay cool, I can dig that. Good earthy influence on there with a strong malt sweetness (that I could do with a little less of honestly). Feel is pretty good. Carbonation strikes a bit firmly. For the beer nerds, this is a good one to go for. With the less experienced and those looking for standard lager type beers, this might strike as too heavy and abrasive."
""
""
""
""
""
"I may seek out another 6-pack of these if I can find it!"
""
"O - the is a great beer, the hops are very delicious and well balanced with the malt crispness. I was very happy, haven't been keen on SA IPAs and this is probably the best I have had from them, also being an IPL and nothing I have had I find it an interesting idea and very refreshing."
"Overall I think this beer is a success. I hope it will become a regular seasonal if not a permanent part of their lineup."
""
"O: Overall I thought it was fairly average. It was decent tasting, but it's not anything I would actively seek out. The catty flavor and smell dominated, so I would only recommend it to people who enjoy that. It has an rustic edge that is similar to crusty breads. It would pair well with these breads, and something like goulash and potatoes."
""

"This poured out as a really nice clear copper color with a nice white head on top. The retention is pretty solid and the lacing is scattered. The smell of the beer isn't quite as hoppy as I was hoping for. The aroma is pretty mild , hops are in there but the malt and yeast take over. The taste is pretty good. There is a nice bitter flavor from start to finish with a fruity essence and earthy back bone. The mouthfeel is sharp and clean, very drinkable. Overall this is a really nice beer. It's an interesting take on what could be an Ale but made into a Lager."
"Overall a pretty nice beer, nice hops that bring enough bitterness to be an ipl but light enough not to destroy the lager underneath. Tasty soft and enjoyable. Reminds me of a slightly kicked up version of the original Noble Pils (not the crap they put out now and pretend to call it noble pils)."
"Pours a yellowish orange with a frothy white head. Smell is strong with hops, citrus, pine and subtle sweetness. Taste is more subtle then the smell would suggest. Hoppy all the way through the sip but they aren't strong till the end/aftertaste. There is some malt and citrus at the beginning and ends with the strong hop punch. A nice medium mouthfeel, good body for this beer. Overall an enjoyable beer a nice malt presence that is not usually found in an IPA. My first IPL and it was tasty."
""
"I'm glad I bought six of these, even though I only had one in this particular sitting. Like SNPA or the Sammy Boston Lager, this beer can be enjoyed year-round and deserves to be in anyone's rotation. This certainly pushed the edge to what a Lager can look and taste like and will please just about anyone who plunks $10 and gives this a go. Enthusiastically recommended!"
""
""
""
""
"This is one of the better Pale Lagers I have ever had. It definitely delivers the hops that it promises. It has tremendous drinkability, and doesn't disappoint. I won't buy the whole mix-pack again for this, but if I came across it elsewhere, I would definitely get it again."
""
""
""
""
"It pours a orange color with excellent clarity and a good head with slight lacing and mild retention. It smells really hoppy and made me excited about this lager. It tastes pretty damn amazing considering that it is a lager and I am not a huge lager fan. It has an interesting hop character and I would like to know what hops they used. It has a pretty good body considering that lagers don't have a lot of body and is well carbonated. This is a good beer and I would like it if they sold it in six packs."
"A solid hoppy brew. I like the malt and what they did to keep it in balance with the hops. Pretty decent. Not an earth-shattering beer though. A little safe, but that's ok."
""
""
"I liked this beer, but the lager theme was completely lost in the pungent hop profile that Boston Beer managed to achieve with this one."
""
"Overall, one of the better beers I have had from Sam Adams. I really love the hops and the crispness the lager yeast gives. This beer is highly drinkable and provides an added bonus of great flavor. Definitely one to pick up."
""
"Strong citrus aroma, taste precisly follows; very grapefruit/ mandarine orange flavors. Nice crisp finish. Appearance was very appealing; poured clear orange-yellow with full white head. Head lingers and laces the glass well. Although it is from their ""Hopology"" collection, it does not seem to be all that ""hoppy", much milder and smoother than many IPA's I have tried. Give this one a go!"
""
""
""
"Overall: A good/great IPA that I could drink all night, though it wouldn't be my first choice from the Spring Thaw pack from Sam Adams."
""
"Overall, this is a very balanced and refreshing beer. Very drinkable at 5% and not overly bitter(not sure what the ibus clock in at). I can't wait until someone amps up the abv and ibus to see what happens. DIPL anyone? Anyway, This is worth a try."
"Overall a better Sammy sample than most. I say bottle this one."
""
""
""
"One of the better Sam Adams beers I have tried in a long time, maybe the best I have had. Really hits that tropical fruit flavor but drinks smoothly and mildly making it a session beer candidate. I would laugh if people claim this is one-dimensional or something because it really is similar to 80% of the IPAs/hoppy Pales out there today."
""
""
"O: I happen to like Sam Adams as a casual drinking beer, but this is really good even for them. Well balanced, nice blend of citrus and pine, lots of flavor for a 5% ABV. It isn't a surprising or particularly interesting brew, but it's very drinkable, and I would definitely buy it again."
"O: Decent drinker but suffers from a lack of diversity and depth in flavors. Still a pretty nice pale lager with some ample hopping. A good value too."
""
"I hear there's a mole in the agency. ...Or maybe it was the garden... Anyway, this stuff pours clear sunrise amber topped by a finger of off-white foam. The nose comprises candied orange peel, light leek, sweet caramel, and grass. The taste holds notes of orange rind, light lemon rind, grapefruit peel, mild caramel, and a bit of honey dripping from a tall blade of grass. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a fluid feel. Overall, a nice little hoppy lager, nothing overtly special, but a generally enjoyable experience."
"O- Another delicious brew by Sam Adams. Reminded me a lot of the Boston lager, only a little bit more hoppy and less roasty. I have been a fan of the Boston lager, but I think I like this even more. I will be picking it up again when I get the chance. It is both delicious and well priced."
"overall... A rather suprising one from Sam Adams. A solid ipa-ish brew with plenty of hop character and no real flaws. Impressive."
"And for the category it falls in? American pale lager..i.e..BMC bullshit..this really blows the competition away."
""
"O - I had high hopes for this beer. It is a delicious lager and would make a great session beer. This is only my second IPL. The previous one must have spoiled me. Even though it didn't live up to my expectations I would still buy this again. It would make a great session lager."

"Love life... drink beer!!!"

"Samuel Adams Double Agent IPL ---3.5/5"
""
"i really like this double agant ipl from sam adams. the color is a nice golden. the smell is thick with rich piney hops. theres a bold hoppiness in the taste. somehow they capture the hoppy flavor without the face squishing bitterness of some other really hoppy beers. being that this is an ""ipl"" i think sam adams did just what they sat out to do with this one. it is a very smooth very drinkable, hoppy ipa (l) beer."
"O- double agent ipl is a good piney hopped up lager. Very concentrated and flavorful all the while sessionable as heck"
""
""
""
""
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass, best by June 2013. This pours a clear yellow / light golden color with a large off white head. The smells are very crisp and of nice grassy and floral hops, a very nice smelling beer. The feel is medium to light mid carbonation. The taste is pretty good alight crisp grassy, and hoppy taste. This is a very good lager."
""
""
"Clear tawny color with white head that leaves sugary lacing. Hop aroma of grass, mint leaves, lemon skin, soap, and blood orange. Hops are in the forefront in flavor: grass, mint leaves, lemon skin, pine towards the finish, bitter but clean, cereal in the background. Light in body with medium carbonation that is prickly. Very clean, hop-forward lager that makes for some easy drinkin'. Interesting, sessionable, and enjoyable. Very refreshing when served cold as shit."
""
""
"Overall it is OK but I don't need a six pack of the stuff."
""
"O- not a bad beer at all, but it reminds me a lot of the Summer Ale with that soapy flavor I'm getting out of it"
""
"Crisp mouthfeel, as advertised. Two went down pretty quickly and easily."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Well done, Sam old egg. This one's up there with the dear old Noble Pils, which ought to be returned to the 12-pack format too. Meantime this'll do very nicely while it lasts."
""
""
""
"O- straightforward and simple, but it's well done. hopefully, they come out with this in a six pack."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a crystal clear medium copper color with a huge bubbly and sticky bone white head that slowly recedes and sticks itself all over the glass on the way down. Smells of floral pine and resin in spades with hints of bread onion and garlic. Wow the aroma on this one shocked me! The flavor is light bready and caramel malt with a ton of hop flavor. Earth pine and resinous hop flavors tip the scale heavily to the hop side. Medium body with a medium to high level of carbonation and a slick resinous mouthfeel. This is nice beer, I was quite surprised by this one."
""
""
""
""
"On the lighter end of medium bodied with a crisp hop bite which provides some dry bitterness that lingers over the lager yeast into a slightly dry finish. Some sticky pine needle and grassy hop notes but again, the citrus and tropical fruit notes are undetectable to my palate. Caramel malt backbone with hints of caramel, toffee, bread and biscuit. Really disappointing considering what I was expecting. The idea of a west coast style hoppy lager is intriguing but this was just a boring lager with a slightly aggressive, one dimensional hop profile."

"An American Pale Lager, eh? Yeah, this is the tits. Now, the fun part. I get to rate it to style..."
""
"O - This is a really tasty lager. It doesn't even taste like a lager."
""
""
"This is a tasty, easy drinking beer. Wish there were more beers like this being made these days. It combines an IPA hoppiness with a lager drinkability (not saying IPA's aren't drinkable but a lot push up to 7-8% ABV)....well done..."
""
""
"A pretty decent IPL, easy to drink and about on par with another sam adams stand out Noble Pils."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Minty, herbal bitterness up front. Some citrus tang as well. Toasted malts come on, but soon turn crackery with notes of caramel. Spicy, peppery hop flavors accent the palate. Herbal, resinous bitterness in the dry finish. Some lingering citrus and caramel-cracker. Moderate body with a slightly sticky feel. Very refreshing and appetizing. Should be a year rounder!"
"Very decent, would definitely have again."
"O - IPA flavor with the smoothness of a lager; not bad"
""
"O: The lagering process of this beer mellows out the hops just enough for them to still rule over the malts and breadiness. The yeast also obviously makes it different from an IPA, but this is one solid brew. I wish this was available outside of the Spring pack... Here's to hoping"
""
""
""
""
""
"I would happily buy a twelve pack of this. Next time I'm in the grocery store, I'll see if they have sixers or twelvskies. Great job on this one!"
""
""
""
""
"Overall: It's not bad just not my kind of beer. I don't really like hoppy beers but my friend who loves IPA and similar beer absolutely loves this one. For my preference I didn't like it but for those of you that like these kinds of beer it seems to be pretty good. Loved the aroma though."
""
""
"Overall: It's a hoppy lager. I can get behind that."
"O: I had high hopes for this one and am extremely pleased with it. Make this a 6-pack offering!"
""
""
"Overall I thought this was a nice beer and nice example of the style, it was a hoppy lager, just as promised, but the profile seemed to lack the balance I wish it had. This beer had good drinkability, it was fairly smooth, and the taste did an ok job at holding my attention, but I think one would be enough since I would get tired of the spicy hops. What I liked the most about this beer was the mouthfeel, it was just how it should be. What I liked the least about this beer was that the spicy hops were a little to overpowering, if the spicy and citrus hops were at the same level I think it would make this beer much more enjoyable. I don't think I would buy this beer on it's own, I would much rather have a Shift from New Belgium, that beer is a little better in just about every aspect, but I would still recommend giving it a try. All in All I thought this beer was solid, it was nice for what it is, I am happy that Samuel Adam's took a shot at this style, nice work guys, keep being creative."
"This beer is a completely clear, pale gold color. The foam is white and long lasting. The aroma is heavy with floral, herbal, and woody-smelling hops. Grass and malt are ther as well. Not fruity, but the hops do have a touch of citric in the background. Nice flavor! Balanced and drinkable. Nice up front sweetness and malt. Lots of hop flavor throughout the taste. Medium body. Very good."

"For a pale lager, this is very good. The aroma, flavor, and feel are all top notch."

"It pours a clear golden amber with a frothy white head. Head retention is excellent and the lacing is moderate. It smells of piney hops with a bit of citrus and a subtle malt background. The taste comes across as grapefruit to me, almost entirely. the malt does shine through at moments, but the finish is definitely pure grapfruit. The mouthfeel in light and crisp with light, prickly carbonation. I have mentioned In previous reviews that I am not terribly fond of Samuel Adams, but I don't have any serious problems drinking this beer. It may be a little simple as far as flavor and taste go, but is shines brilliantly with Its bitter hops and malty highlights. Mmmm. I am very glad that this is in the Spring Variety pack."
"Pours a clear light golden color with a fairly thick white head. Good retention and lacing. Smell is pretty faint, not much to it. Very light hop notes, slight sulfur character. Taste is fairly bitter, with no truly discernible unique hop characteristics. Maybe a slight earthiness. Definitely got the flavor of a lager, the sulfur character carries to the taste. Medium carbonation and light body. Overall this beer is pretty disappointing, very bland with the character of a poorly executed standard lager. Definitely none of the ""india pale"" character you may be expecting. I will not be having this beer again."

"A pretty good beer, especially after looking at the label after I rated it. Thought it was an IPA, but apparently it’s an IPA-lager hybrid. Beer Advocate calls it an American Pale Lager. Either way, I’ll be having this again."

"Overall, this is probably the best beer in this classification as I have had. Not a great beer, but for a pale lager..."
""
""

"O: I think this beer is a very nice twist on an IPA, nobody does innovation like Sam Adams thats for sure. This can be a great any occasion beer for standard Macro beer drinkers and craft beer enthusiasts alike."

"Double Agent IPL pours a clear golden color, with a very nice lacing head. There is a strong hoppy floral aroma. The taste is very well balanced, good floral notes, but not overerly bitter, with a good solid malty backbone. Good full and crisp flavor. Overall a very nice beer, the hops don't make this beer, but instead add on to it."
"Double Agent IPL is just the new beer Samuel Adams needed. It's a unique year-round offering for most of the country, and has enough hops to satisfy a hop head like me with a very low ABV. The hop profile is actually rather reminiscent of Laguntias's DayTime."
"O - I'm not a huge fan of Sam Adams because I prefer my beers to be less balanced and more hop forward, SA has stepped out of the box on this one and hopped it to high heaven. I would say next to the Hallertau Imperial Pils they brewed years ago this is the next hoppiest beer I've ever had from them. Nicely done and with an ABV of only 5% I can easily get my hop fix and not worry about losing my wits, this is a perfect session beer for the hop lovers. I can see the reviews being all over the board on this one as it deviates from the typical balanced beers they tend to brew."
"12oz bottle purchased as part of the Spring mix pack. Pours a crystal clear amber with a good inch of off white head. Smells like pine and citrus. Citrus, pine, cattiness dominate the flavor with a slight biscuity flavor for balance. Medium in body and carbonation. Not bad. A good hop bomb."
"OVERALL: Hoppy lagers have existed in Europe for centuries, and if it takes the ""India"" label to make the product marketable so be it. A nice alternative to the standard flagship and also hopped up Boston Lager. I'm onboard with this , more hoppy lagers please."
""
"I'd like to see a big IPA fan who is also a lager fan review this... I'm just going by how it tastes to me... and it's just ok."
