"Overall: Not very good honestly. Oh well, had to try it."

"Pours very pale yellow color.  Virtually no head.  What is there is carbonated.  No lacing.  Sour fruit aroma, yeasty.  Bready with some spicy bitterness in taste.  Nothing special.  Drinkable but would only drink if nothing else present and really wanted a beer."

"Pours out to a thin white sudsy head that lasts but does not lace. Very pale yellow and lots of carbonation bubbles. Aroma is very light and grainy and slightly grassy. Flavor is very light and thin. Not much going on. Reminds me of another all malt low-cal/low-carb beer that is no longer brewed. For what it is it is OK."

"Overall: One of the most watery, boring, flavorless ""craft"" beers I've ever had."

"Overall-Not a true replacement of the Shiner Blonde, it bears little in taste resemblance to that beer to me. I do like the fact that Spoetzl is trying to work a light beer and for that I will try to keep a six or two in the lager for friends who prefer light beers."

"Atmosphere is fair. Lots of effervescence and a giant head, also some persistent lacing. Nose is light grain, with a strange sweetness, and pervasive odor of methane gas. Very light and shallow flavor, almost indistinct. Overall, this is not so good quaff."

"Poured from a bottle into a shaker pint, the beer is a bright, light, straw coloring with a thin, low profile, sparse white filmy surface coating. Aromas of toast, floral highlights, and some funky esther. Flavors are tangy and light, with an effervescent character keeping the body crisp. Toasted grain backbone with some buttery highlights. The aftertaste is light, with a toasty character. Frothy, slightly sharp finish."

"It's really not much different from your typical light American lager."
"O - This is a light easy drinking lager. Nothing fabulous but okay."

"O- Meh ... Certainly a step down from other Shiner brews. I guess it's probably a step up from the so-called yellow fizzy beers and at least your money goes to a smaller brewery than InBev or Miller-Coors ... Am I grasping at straws?"

"O: Probably good on a hot day."

"Overall Impression- While the Blonde by Shiner (Spoetzl) is relatively easy going also, I had no trouble putting this one down in under 5 gulps. A bit too watered down for my taste. I know its a Light Blonde, but why have a style this easy? Enjoyed the beer for what it was!"

"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass, I got my girlfriend to split it with me, I have pretty low expectations. This pours a pale straw yellow with a small white head which quickly dissipates. The smells are somewhat sweet and light no real hop presence. The feel is very light. Taste is like what I expected very light adjunct.beer, but better than the big three lights."

"This transparent yellow beverage smelled a bit like hops, I thought. I tasted none, though. It was like lightly beerish flavoured carbonated water. And I don't like carbonated water. I'm an American. I was outside on a hot day, and I still would have preferred a Shiner Bock. Even those are pretty watery, though."
"The beer pours a clear yellow color with a white head. The aroma is heavy on the grain with nothing else going on. The flavor is more of the same. I get a lot of grain and some grassy notes. This beer tastes almost exactly like Miller Lite, which I assume is what the brewers were going for., Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"D: Easily drinkable. Low ABV. Nothing wrong with the beer; just nothing notable."
