"As usual Abita brews very refreshing with high drinkability, I guess that reflects what the local staggering hot climate demands. But this is way too bland, which is fine they want to get a piece of the mass brews with something better."

"Overall: A nice clean tasting beer. Light enough to drink all summer long. This is not your watered down TV light; has a decent flavor."

"O: A non-offensive beer that reminds me of a dull Euro Lager."
""
"Overall, I do like this beer but feel the sweetness could be toned down just a bit. Drinkability is somewhat limited by this but I could still put back a few of these."

"Clear and a pale, yellowish colour with a creamy cap of white foam. Great head retention. Not one of my favourite hop aromas - really sulfury and floral, slight sweet and sour smell in the background. Taste is mild, slight hop flavour (again sort of floral) with a bit of malt, low bitterness, hint of citrus in the finish. Light bodied, moderate carbonation, decent texture for a light beer. Not bad overall, just not something I'm that into."

"Pours out to a 1 inch head that falls to a 1/8 inch layer. Minimal lacing. Pale gold-yellow color. Aroma is a clean hit of grass, lemon, and light graininess. Flavor is a muted mixture of clean, pale malt and noble hops with a slightly spicy and biscuity finish. Mouthfeel is super light and well carbonated. This beer is what most american ""light"" lagers should be, light, but with a decent malt and hop character and a clean crisp finish. The labeling now mentions it is brewed in the style of a Munich helles. It's not exactly there but close enough to draw such a comparison."

"O: Nothing bad about it, but not great either. I was rather disappointed in how watery it tasted."

"Poured into a pint glass. Pours pale gold with a two-finger length white head. There are plenty of bubbles rising from the bottom of the glass, indicating plentiful carbonation. The head dissipates slowly. There isn't much lacing. It has the classic pale lager smell. There are light bready malts aroma. It smells clean and grassy. The flavor is of pale malt. It's slightly sweet and bready. There isn't much hop bitterness to speak of. It's a very clean flavor. The body is light and there is adequate carbonation. The finish is crisp and dry. The drinkability is high. Overall, this is a good beer. It is a drinkable pale lager that is refreshing on a hot day. Abita accomplished what it set out to do with this beer."

"Pass."
"Just ok. Descent flavor but most of the other characteristics could use much improvement."
"pours clear golden with a small white ring for a head that disappears as quick as it showed up. smell and taste is your typical adjunct beer. mouthfeel is thin and watery. overall i dont think i was expecting much but this is a disappointment. this might be worse than coors light. not worth seeeking out. guess i had high hopes because i liked turbo dog."
"The Rest: This beer is just so-so. Not a lot of flavor and a pretty thin body make this an unremarkable beer."
"This beer pours a clear, yellow with minimal head and no lace. The aroma is of citrus, dough, and vanilla. It's flavor has lemon and banana notes with a faint hint of lime. It has a light mouthfeel with a nice amount of carbonation. Like beer flavored champagne. Abita Golden is a decent beer, crisp and very refreshing. Recommended."
"Overall: My first beer in New Orleans post Katrina had to be from Abita, the brewery I have drunk so often when rooting on the Saints. This version is a very sessionable lager that is borderline pils. Nothing too fancy, but a good light beer that I could have a six of."
"D: more co2 and more of a hop presence woulda vastly improved this beer. not bad, but meh."
"D: Low ABV and very easy to drink... Not a great deal of flavors here.... just your normal APL...."
"D: This is a great alternative to your generic macro lager, but not much more. It doesn't offer anything in the way of exciting flavors or complexities, but it's one of the easiest drinking beers I know. I have a soft spot for Abita beers, even if this isn't the best example."
"D- Very drinkable. While there is nothing truly outstanding about this beer, it is, at the very least, easy to drink."
"Pours into a pint glass a very, very pale yellow with just a little bit of foam. Weak smell is mostly grain - reminds me of a macro light beer. Flavor is... strange. Is it skunked? Still has a light beer flavor, but with a slightly bitter, oily body behind it. It's hard to get through even one glass, let alone have it in any quantity. I'm starting to gather that Abita has a certain characteristic body, and this is another example. I can't find anything to recommend this, but you might like it if you like Turbodog."
"Geez, these guys can make great beer when they want to. Why o why do they put stuff like this out there? Poured with a small white head and no lace. Color is a hazy gold. Aroma is a bit skunky malt cereal. Flavor is like aroma plus a generous dash of kerosene. Body is not bad, but carbonation is razor sharp.Finish is like flavor and best forgotton. Which is easy to do in this case."
"There's nothing offensive about this beer, but neither is there anything particularly awesome. It's refreshing, grainy and lemony, without much hops. It's got a haze that isn't all that attractive. Overall, this feels like cheap beer at expensive beer prices."
"RJT"
"And high marks for drinkability as well. This is far from my favorite Abita beer but I could still kick back a few while watching LSU play or destroying a crawfish boil."
"D/M: Good mouthfeel and drinkability but it was the expense of any flavor in the brew."
"Poured from a brown bottle into a weizen glass. Has a golden color with 1/2 inch head. Aroma is mild, slightly grainy. Taste is crisp and refreshing. Some maltiness but not very strong flavor. Feels good in mouth and is a very drinkable warm weather beer. Overall this is a quality brew."
"Holy head, Batman! The two-plus fingers of foamy, bone-white head could have been used in advertising, what with its great retention. The nose had a slight Saaz quality. Color was a slightly hazy lemon yellow. Taste was more Pilsner-ish than Lager. Mouthfeel was medium. Finish was slightly dry. This was a table beer if i ever had one."
"Overall-solid beer, I have no problems with it, definitely get yourself a sample."
"A very golden beer which pours a nice head that soon dissipates. It may be just this particular beer I got, but it has somewhat of a flat taste, needs more bite. I thought the smell was pretty desirable, enough of an aroma to give you something to like, smells like some citrus. I'll have to try another one to see if maybe just this particular beer is a bit flat, and not the beer overall. If not, the score could be lowered considerably. I typically have like what I've had from Abita though."
"Really nice atmosphere. Solid appearance, a really strong head and substantial lacing; plus a fairly complex nose. Flavor is not bad, but also not much there. This leaves the feel a little flat as well, of course. Does have good drinkability. Because it's so mild and light, it has a certain refreshing quality. If you're looking for something serviceable to just power through a few of, this is a good candidate. Nice quaff."
"D - This beer would be a very drinkable beer in the summertime to quench the thirst, if not for the high amounts of carbonation, which seems to accompany most Abitas."
"I would not recommend this to a freind."
"Notes from 7/25/08"
"As American lagers go, this one is better than most. It has a grassy hop aroma with plenty of malt. The appearance is pale gold and the head is small. The flavor is evenly balanced between bitter and sweet. The malt is bread like and there is a hay like quality to it. The palate is average for the style and there is a little bit of a corn taste in the finish but I have to say this is a good lager. It doesn't have the metallic or garbage taste so common to macro lagers."
"I will buy this again, a solid summertime quencher from Abita."
"Pours a crystal clear gold. Overall a nice tasty brew. Very light with medium carbonation. A very nice representative of the style. I would buy a case of this. It's just nice. Nothing really exciting going on with this brew. It's just generally an all around tasty brew that would be good for sitting around with some friends."
"3/12/2008. Well this is your typical slug in the sun kind of beer with a fancy name (at least I've never heard of them). Golden colored, small head, some lacing. It looks slightly better than a Bud, Coors or Miller. Somewhat grassy tasting with a touch of hops and lemon but overall it's watery. It's important to note that there is no skunk or foul taste to this. It's very easy drinking but there's just not much to it. I won't buy it again as I'll just buy the cheap stuff to suit this purpose but I'll drink one if someone gives it to me."
"Thin-bodied and watery, the drink is refreshing and easy on the palate."
"Drinkability is pretty good, especially on a cool, summer day. Not a bad beer from Abita at all, and it's pretty tasty for a lager. It just needs a little more to it."
"Very drinkable due to the lightness of the drink. It would be easy to drink several of these on a warm afternoon."
"D - This beer really lacked much flavor. It didn't taste like most All-Malt Lagers."
"http://jbojangles.blogspot.com/2008/05/twelve-pack-review-abita-party-pack.html"
"It's funny to see microbrew references in movies. An Abita Purple Haze sign is seen in the background of Larry the Cable Guy's Health Inspector. They also drink Dogfish Head a lot in Reno 911. But anyway, I enjoyed Purple Haze so I decided to try the golden ale. Served it well chilled in a pint glass. Poured a wan golden color with a decent head. The smell was corny, sweet like a cup of Kelloggs Corn Flakes. Taste was similar bt not as sweet, mild hop background. I would stick with Purple Haze."
"This was not a good beer, unless you like sucking on nickels...otherwise, you might as well just have a bud lite."
"Poured from a brown bottle that was in an Abita Party Pack into a Sam Adams pint glass. Had a clear Golden color, hence the name with a white 1"" head that reduced to minimal lacing. No sheen, no Charlie Sheen and no Emilio Estevez. Smells like clean water and sweet corn. Had a well balanced crisp taste, the colder the better. Good carbonation and very drinkable. Similar to most mass produced American beers with a less watery feel. I could throw back an icecold 6 pack at a BBQ or ballgame very easily."
"Appears a pale fizzy golden only a few shades lighter than the Abita Light, a standard crystal clear pale Helles style lager look with a bit more fizzy carbonation that a German version. Lacing is sporadic and light as the thick bright white head quickly dwindles down to a collar. Aroma light two row bring out cereal grains with a touch of honey sweetness, more biscuit pale malts really are nice here with a touch of Hallertau herbal hop bouquet. Flavor is creamy smooth and crisp with those biscuit malts really coming out in liquid cereal nature with a smidge of finishing herbal hops to add in that signature hop burp. I'm sure they sell a ton of this around the brewery, but I see why it doesn't get much attention up this away. It's only incrementally better than your standard BMC, mouthfeel is still light syrup with tickling carbonation that really effects the back of the throat. Drinkability is downright effortless yet not complex enough in flavor to keep me coming back again and again, pretty damn boring."
"pours a nearly clear piss yellow color, has hardly any color at all, i think natty light has more color and carbonation. smell is barely tangible, and what little smell there is, is just corn and water. taste is also non existant, i'm trying hard not to bash this beer, but there isn't much to even bash about its basically boring without hardly any substance, i'd avoid."
"O: An ok session beer."
"Poured a clear golden/yellow color with small white head that dissipated rather quickly. Aroma was not real prominent, but a bit malty. Flavor was malty without any real hop presence. Very easy drinking and smooth. Drinkability is very high on this one. Not very complex and not meant to be. Good sessionable lager."
"Pured a golden color. So I guess the name is appropriate. Formed a tight bubbled half inch heead. Smelled sweet and corny. The odor was a little offputting. the taaste was good however. Not very sweet, good grainy taste. Nicely carbonated. No problem knocking back a few of these. Beats a BMC."
"It was a great beer, something I'd have again."
"D- This beer is easy to drink. you could definetly drink more then one because the taste is not to heavy. Id say buy a six it is worth it."
"Golden yellow transparent pilsner body; head is swift in its descent and thins to a partial white... Hallertau hops noticeable and metallic malt is present,...predicatble, but not annoying...slow, effervescent bubbles... creamy, soft palate with a late malt kick... crisp, soft rather unobtrusive flavor... golden, yes--consistent in its modesty and a true member of its style..."
"Pours as is expected: clear straw. No head. Nose smells like a skunks ass. Is this a bad beer. Or is it...just a bad beer overall? Flavor is okay. Kind of grainy and metallic with a very slight sweet tone to it. Leaves a pretty decent sweet aftertaste. Feel is thin on the liquid and pretty good with the carbonation. Overall it has a decent drinkability factor. I mean it is a malt lager and doesn't really have a strong quality to it. If this is your thing, go for it. If not, I'd say consider passing."
"Into a pint glass, pours a light straw yellow with a respectable white head, a little bit of lacing but not much. The aroma is light on malt and has a slight grassy hop in there. The taste is also light-weight, a slight bit of tangy spicy something, a malt somewhere between cardboard and stale crackers, a decent hop bittering, rather bland but drinkable. The body is light to medium, but the saving grace is a nice effervescent carbonation that activates any slight flavor. In all, drinkable, but enjoyable? Eh."
"D-Overall not a bad beer at all...The aroma is pretty inviting and the taste and feel doesn't let me down from there. Not an all-time great but I could see drinking a few of these with some cajun food...."
"Drinkability- This is a good beer for tailgating at Southern Miss games. It's easy to drink, is flavorful, yet light enough to drink in quantity."
"12oz bottle poured into a pint glass. Pours a pale golden yellow color with a fizzy white head. The aroma is pale grainy malt and a touch of spicy hallertauer hops. The taste is clean and crisp with the typical light lager flavors. Mouthfeel is light bodied and prickly from the carbonation. Overall, this is a decent lager that is very refreshing but nothing special."
"If you consider the style, it's not too bad; it has more taste than the standard macro lager, but otherwise, not too much better than the macro lager."
"Poured from a 12 oz into pint glass. Aroma is nasty and wont be missed. The head was crisp with tony bubbles and disappeared rather quickly. Poured a straw color. There is a good malty flavor with biscuit hints and a sweet aftertaste. An average golden ale and for $7 a six pack wasn't a bad deal. Wont buy again however because it really takes a special golden ale for me to be a repeat buyer. This one was not that."
"I enjoyed the nice slightly tart and crisp carbonation lifted malt hop team. Adjuncts seem to be kept low in the grain bill. I could almost taste hop bitterness and malt sweetness in the last swallow."
"Abita Golden pours a golden color with a white head from a brown twelve ounce bottle. The aroma is almost non-existent, just a slight grainy smell. The flavor is also grainy with kind of an off flavor that I can't quite put my finger on. Almost like stale cigarette smoke. I'd pass on this one."
"LAST AND FINAL CHANCE FOR THIS BREWERY TO IMPRESS ME. Yet another soda water fucking beer. I do not get the appeal of this brewery. Their beers taste like water and alcohol with some artificial flavorings and soda water type carbonation. Do they brew with carbonated water? The last beer I will ever try from them. I have given this brewery chance after chance. The turbo dog was decent, but this brewery produces beers that are offensive to my taste buds. Maybe you will like them. Maybe they just hit me the wrong way, but damn dude."
"Poured from a 12oz. bottle with a freshness date on the label, into a pint glass. The beer pours a very light clear gold, forming a very thin white head, and leaving no lacing. Very little carbonation. Aroma is malt and grain. Nothing exciting or complex in the aroma. The taste is thick malts, a semi-sweet caramel flavoring, and ending with the not-so-harsh grainy finish. Medium mouthfeel. An easy enough beer to drink, but the lack of flavor keeps this from being a sessionable beer. Overall, tastes a little better than Olde English 800. Worth a try."
"Got in a sampler. Poured from a 12oz bottle with a best by date on back label. Had a clear golden color with a good head that quickly dissipated to trace of foam and no lacing. The smell was not that pleasant and was straight malt - no sweetness or hops. The taste was bland and just north of a Miller Lite. Only worth drinking if nothing better around or if you just want to drink a bunch of beer and don't care about taste. (3, NA, Tie, N)"
"the third beer in tha abita party pack.my patience is begining to wear thin with them. poured a nice one finger head that lasted about a minute.no lacing and the taste was weak.this could actually be a light beer.clear and light haze in the glass.well three more to go i hope it gets better."
"I got this 12 ounze bottle from an Abita Party Pack at Kunda Bev. I poured into a large 20 ounze glass. There was less than a finger of head. The head had decent retention but produced no lace at all, absolutly none. The color was the clearest gold I have ever seen. There was a complete absence of smell. The taste was pretty good and wellblended. The mouthfeel was decent. A fair beer. Don't drink and review."
"When drinking, it was a very bland, no real apparent taste with a slight sour note at the end. Almost flat like in flavor but just enough there to keep me guessing what it was I was missing in its taste."
"Overall good for the style, but it's pretty plain."
"Overall, a light golden that fails on all aspects except for its watery quenching abilities."
"An excellent lager, and one of my favorites on the Abita lineup."
"Straw/gold color that isn't very remarkable, and in fact lends itself to a typical macro-brew. The taste doesn't necessarily stand out either as far as lagers go. It's a medium lager, though within this genre I feel like it tastes lighter than traditional lagers. According to the label, it contains pilsner malts which I think contributes to its body and taste. Abita very accurately matches creole food with this beer. While the Amber will remain my favorite, for a humid night and good food, Golden acquites itself well."
"Hazy, pale gold with a small, white, foamy, rapidly diminishing head. Smell is of sweet grain & orange. Smells light but refreshing . Taste is more of the same. Juicy orange and light bready malt. Crisp, short finish. It has a medium-light body, lightly crisp texture and moderate carbonation. Nothing great, but it made a very good grilling beer."
"Overall this is a pleasant brew but there's little to recommend it. It would be a fine first step in introducing macro drinkers to the world of craft beer but there's not be enough personality to make it a standout."
"Wouldn't buy it again, though."
"Grassy aroma with malts that smell vaguely of cornbread. Bright golden color with a quickly diminishing two finger thick head. Light and sweet fore tastes a bit of cornbread and karo syrup. Has a decent feel to it. Very low hop profile. This is a lager I could drink a few of."
"No obvious faults, but this is one very boring beer."
"I read a few other comments that said this might be lighter than their Light beer, and I think they're right. Smelled pretty light, too...gave off a decent head, though. I did end up liking the taste - very creamy in my mouth and going down was pretty smooth. Overall, a pretty good beer from Abita...ya just have to give it a chance."
"Insanely light and clear. I think this is lighter than their light beer...wtf? The smell is weak malt and grain. Corny too. This is really grainey in taste but there is obnoxious sweetnes in here that is just plain weird. I would prefer their light beer to this. The taste plain sucks. Medium body here. Ehh, kinda drinkable but this is too weird for me."
"Hazy, dull gold, faint hops and some grassy notes on the nose, blah. Grainy malts, some earthy tones, slightly watered down factor here. The taste of day old biscuits, even some adjuncts, very thin and chalky. Finishes with a carbonated, just sipped champagne feel; wet cardboard left on the palate. Next time, punt."
"Overall a pretty good session beer when in the mood for a simple tasting craft lager to quench your thirst, but nothing to go ranting and raving about."
"Very attractive beer that is clean, crisp, and very drinkable. One of the better Abita brews to my taste. A nice session beer. Thanks to BigLove for the opportunity to try this one."
"Poured pale gold in color with a slight haze. No head but there was carbonation on the tongue. Nose is malty. Flavor is more of the same, some sugary mals but the hops are really only noticeable when I burp. Mouthfeel is heavy but has a crisp-ish finish. Almost feels like wet moss in the mouth. Heavy and sticky at first but finishes nicely. A satisfying drink after running around all day."
"thanks goes to biglove . from the bottle. poured a golden color with a small white head. aroma got some malt and hops, grainsand hints of corn. flavor, the corn comes out a little bit stronger than in the aroma, than came hints of malts and hops. this is a decent summer beer to drink after mowing the lawn."
"This is a worthy example of the style. Crisp, refreshing, wqith a nice light malt base. Tasty beer."
"Well, it's a light lager. There's nothing at all wrong with it. There's nothing that really stands out for me. It's easy to drink and goes down well on a hot summer day! It's almost yellow, has little head, very little nose, not much going on for flavor, a fairly light body, little in the way of aftertaste."
"D&N: Crisp and clean, very refreshing and oh so easy to drink a few of. This is a great summer beer. Pairs well with a nice breakfast plate ( I just finished working the night shift, so bacon and eggs and beer at 8AM isn't so strange.) Not a beer that is going to rewrite the book on beer, but this is a damn solid brew that is very enjoyable and fits in well to the summer beer niche."
"Poured a light amber color with moderate white head. Smell is slightly hoppy with a bread-like background. Taste is excellent and pleasantly suprising. Very refreshing with a bite at the finish. First class beer. My favorite from the sampler pack. glad I saved it until last."
"Abita Golden may be an acceptable thirst quencher in the Big Easy and it may be a decent, inexpensive accompaniment to some a' that fine 'Nawlins spicy food (that I remember with such fondness). Solo though, it's little better than its more popular cousins from up North."
"Light aroma with slight hints of U.S. barley and European hops. Clean and sensable medium golden apearance. Low bodied, yet refreshing. Well carbinated for nice efforvescence. Head retention is surprisingly well formed. Flavors and aromas weaken toward the finish. Dry finish."
"Pale yellow color with a thin white lace for a head. Smells like sweet grains and faint hops. Very clean taste. A bit malty and grany. Some hops come out to balance the grains. Clean finish and light bodied. This beer is a great beer for a summer day. Thirst quenching, nothing too comlex, and still tasty. Goes good with a burger."
"Thin but good carbonation. Easy enough to drink, but even in NOLA better options exist."
"pale colored with wispy foam. slightly carbonated with a sweet nutty aroma with strong corn notes. abita tortilla. taste is a tad watery for my liking, but finishes with mild hops and raw nuts, which is tasty. sweet and refreshing without a bad or metallic aftertaste. very drinkable, just not my style."
"12 ouncer sampled, does have best before dating but good luck trying to figure it out. Pours very light amber, moderate bubble whie head. Cabadgy nose. This one, I found to be thin and watery and lacking in most departments. Limited in complexity and interest in general, expensive, lawn mower libation at best"
"Nevertheless, when I first cracked open the bottle, The smell was not that bad, but nothing hardly notable about it. The taste was just like any golden beer, but there was almost no carbonation to speak of. Very thin and watery, beginning to leave a very bad aftertaste as I desperatly searched for some type of flavor or fizz or anything at all. This beer reminded me of a flat Coors Original from a can. Nothing special at all. Not recommended (unless its dirt cheap)."
"Drinkability  Sorry, this just wasnt my cup of tea."
"Foamy, small, white head. Clear, dirty yellow beer. Nuts and fruit in the nose: almost candy. Lemony fresh, nutty front; tingly, light fruity middle; very fresh, nutty, dry finish. This is actually pretty good. Nice, citrusy, fresh and nutty. This style turns out to be a nice base for Abita's peanuttiness."
"This was nothing really special. Pretty much the typical craft beer lager. Decent malt body, clean with a slight bit of citrus in the flavor. Very slight aroma doesnt really do anything for or against the beer. The hops are almost a no show except for the bit of bitterness in the back. Pretty crisp and drinkable, but nothing special."
"True to it's name Abita Golden pours a bright golden color with average head size. Smell is standard grain smell, clean, but nothing special. Taste is crisp, with a touch of sweetness in the finish. This is probably what macros would taste like if the used quality ingredients and took time with their beer. This is a standard American lager that works best in sessions or as a lawnmower beer. I enjoyed Abita Golden, but I would recommend most of their other beers before this one."
"Pale, sickly yellow in hue, dull and the lack of animation only amplifies this notion. The white head was a slight half finger in height at the zenith but it quickly faded to a soapy cap. The appearance is completely unimpressive, an adjunct free lager of this nature, IMO, should have a richer color. The subsequent lacing was almost nonexistent. The nose is distinctly Abita (or Iowas Millstream as both breweries beers smell identical to me). The yeast strain these two brewers use is obviously German. This beer has soft notes of grain, malty like a typical but decent macro lager. Luckily the hints of lemon, flowers, and hay increase the likeability of the bouquet. Moderate potency. Decent. The palate is very well crafted; it is much tastier than the nose indicated. The appearance screams, macro lager, but my tongue detected a good amount of hops (for the style). Lemon, hay, and grass upfront. The bitterness is moderate but firm enough to balance the malt profile ideally. The malt adds some sweetness, its bready as well. Clean finish. Simple tasting but very pleasant; I liked it. Medium in body, low carbonation, the mouthfeel is pleasant. The beer is very drinkable and I am sure it would be a hit the with B/M/C crowd. It is nothing I need to seek out again in the future. Still, thank you Morris729 for the bottle!"
"This beer is very mild, but it's a step up from any American macro. The quintessential lawnmower beer, this could be chugged in pints back to back, ice-cold. Refreshing and light. Probably the easiest drinking beer I've ever had. An EXCELLENT CROSSOVER for your macro-lovin' picnic attending co-workers."
"Pours a clear light golden color with a tall foamy white head that soon fades into a trace amount of lace. Nose is slightly stale grains with a bit of sweet malt and floral hops. Light to medium in body and quite crisp in texture. Taste starts a bit sweet turning a bit grassy and herbal towards the middle with a decent amount of hop bitterness coming through in the finish. A good thirst quencher for a hot day."
"This is a very refreshing brew. Certainly better than the macro lagers and a fine thing to drink on a hot day in Florida."
"Very pale yellow and clear, low carbination. Poured with alot of head that mellowed out to a very thin, almost non-existant coating. Not too much scent, you can catch a drift of lemon... Taste is not strong in any flavor, a very light flavored beer. Good session beer. Slight taste of citrus, taste of water, nothing really jumps at you. The body is very light with good drinkability."
"From a bottle this one poured a very clear and bright golden color. Small head, with low carbonation. Small grainy, lemon and grassy notes emanate from the beer. The taste is light and crisp. Nothing that outstanding, but highly quaffable. The bitterness is low and there is some citrus character in the flavor. A very drinkable and attractive golden lager."
"The beer pours a very pale gold color with a white lace head. The aroma is weak and watery. There is a slight pale malt scent, but not much else. The taste is less than average. It is of pale malts and nothing more. It is watery and clean. This hardly tastes like beer. The mouthfeel is good. It is a very low bodied beer with good carbonation. It drinks well, but who would want it."
"This is a very drinkable beer. It came in a sampler pack. I probably won't go out of my way for one, but I might by a sixer sometime for a change."
"Pours a light yellowish golden hue with a pretty decent size white head. Moderate mouthfeel with a smooth taste and a little bit of hop bite. A small step away from macrodom. Filler for a gift pack. I wouldnt turn one down, but I wouldnt go out of my way to find it."
"watering hole but not one that i would buy."
"A light straw colored ale that is thin in body and no lasting head after initial pour taste is flat and not impressive and on the hoppy side. Drinkable only in the sense of being low in alcohol content and not very refreshing. Worth a try at a beer festival but otherwise not a great overall impression."
"Pours a clear light gold color with a thin white head. Somewhat bubbly with thin lacing. Aroma is light hops, just a tad floral. Light, crisp and refreshing with notes of hops and citrus, and even a little malt. Finish is a little hoppy and a little fruity, and fairly clean. I have had lots of worse Lagers than this to be sure."
"A clear golden color with a small white head. Little residual head or lace. The nose is typical lager with mostly a malt sense. Good lager flavor and decent body strength. This is an easy drinking lager that is very average, that is to say, better than most macros. Like other Abitas this is served in its standard packaging, convenient and practical. Not a bad lager choice overall."
"Again this is another textbook style example put out by Abita who uses spring water and good ingredients, with this example being of a light lager. I don't know if I would put it in the lager, pale category that it is in, but Abita has put out another great beer."
"there is a little bit of fruitiness, but the flavor is not very complex at all. in fact, I would call it simple. Grain and grain, oh well. nothin special."
"hazy golden color...high carbonation produces a healthy head which leaves a thin lace around the glass. corny aroma. really sweet grainy flavors. carbonation produces a fizziness that accentuates the crispness. no hop flavors. medium body feels fuller than it really is due to the sweetness. corn sugar galore. would be really good to drink with a mega spicy pizza or some hot mexican food."
"Pours a hazy golden body topped by a quick to dissipate white head. It keeps an alright collar but maintains very little surface covering and leaves no lace. The aroma is minimal with just some light maltiness. The body is light with a very fine bubbled, moderate carbonation that leaves it quite smooth in the mouth. The flavor is a lightly sweet, somewhat husky, and mildly tangy malt that's well balanced with hop bitterness. Finishes dry with a gently lingering maltiness. This is a light, minimally flavored, crisp and clean, easy drinking beer that would fit in nicely at tailgate parties and BBQ's. It's certainly not a Munich-style Helles as suggested in the listing here."
"Good, healthy pee-yellow color. And there's that sour peanut smell again. Like a pile of dusty peanut shells. Seems inappropriate. The taste is manageable with dry, slick flavors of water, shredded wheat and yogurt. Dusty mouthfeel. Drink if you must."
"Aroma is quite subdued, a little malt and some sharp grain flavors.  Taste is initially slightly sweet and malty with stinging carbonation, rises to a tart and slightly sour finish.  Not a bad beer, just a bit lacking in character.  Best if used by date of 11/18."
"Notes: Just some down right easy drinking here, an excellent brew to pair with spicy Szechwan or some Creole that has been kicked up a notch. None the less your all around dependable beer to drink without thinking about what you are drinking."
"Reserved almost to the point of being bland.  The primary character was an astringent tartness, not sour or unpleasant, but that is pretty much what you get.  Not much depth to the flavor, but, at the same time, I found the beer to be quite drinkable.  I put this in my ""backyard BBQ"" class."
