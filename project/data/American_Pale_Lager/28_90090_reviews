"Probably best lager I've had"
""
""
""

"Pours a clear golden color.  Lager yeast and floral hops.  The taste is hoppy, yet bready and clean.  Slight bitterness on a bready, not even buttery but lively palate.  Crisp, clean, faint citrus and husk grain.  Medium bodied, well carbonated and crisp.  This is a beer, and a good one."
"American Lagers have not represented IMO. This one does. Reminds me of the old days IE Old Style in keg shaped bottles."
"Been wanting to try this one for a while. Very refreshing and a solid add to my mix a 6."
"TASTE: Perfect crispness, moderate-sized body, smooth, grassy, clean, peppery, ample hop bitterness, rustic bread, mild orange pith, slightly herbal, long grainy finish, ends dry"
""
""
"Light to medium bodied with crisp carbonation. Smooth and easy to drink. Worth buying again."
""
""
"O: An 'ancient ale' that isn't gimmicky, and pretty good despite it's rustic, limited roots."
""
""
""
"Beer started off cold, tasting and smelling as probably intended.  As it warmed, the aroma became awful with cabbage-like DMS.  Could barely finish the pint."
""
""
""
"Wasn't a huge fan but worth trying.  Sort of an OK but unremarkable lager, but with more hop character."
"3/6 (Bottle) - Pour a solid orange pour, minimal white head and nominal carbonation. Sweet orange, malt aroma, and a good texture. Taste was minimal, which was surprising based on the aroma. Lighter beer than I typically drink may have been a factor."
"Bottle of california lager drank."
""
""
"Run of the mill lager with a small note of hops"
"O:  this beer is FANTASTIC!  it's malty, it's hoppy, it's crisp, light, drinkable ... so much flavor, and the weird hint of orange something is a twist I've not tasted in any other brew -- it's hard for me to call it ""orange"" for it's a floral-orange-lemon thing bouncing off the malt that is truly unique.  a beer I will buy over and over and over ..."
"A new stand by for my fridge and collection. Into rotation. Goes right next to my NB Shift Pale Lager and Session Lager. Lucky to have this offering in my local Smith's grocery store. I like to pair this with meats and spicy dishes. Has a dry yet interesting finish. Feels like a Pilsner but not as grassy.  Very refreshing and not boring. Sessionable and enjoyable. Well done Anchor. Quality shows."
"Just now getting back into lagers, this will probably end up being a favorite."
"A solid good drinking everyday lager."
""
""
"O: Overall pretty good, something a little more interesting that the typical lager, although not as amazing as some other lagers in the same vein."
""
""
""
"Not bad. Very refreshing. Crisp and clean, with a bit of a hop bite in the end."
""
""
"O:  Good, but very simple."
""
"The taste is something ridiculously close to an AAL. Not a fan at all."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Bright toasted gold, fine fluffy head. Lighter lager nose, light wheat, very subtle hop. Clean, crisp and bitter. Not bad."
""
""
"Overall: A solid lager"
""
""
""
"Overall, I highly recommend you check this beer out. If you like the Yuengling lager or even Anchor Stream beer, you'll like this beer. The major turnoff to this brew is it's $9.99 a 6 pack. I don't think for what you get it's worth that price on a consistent basis. I'll stick with Miller High Life consistently if I just want an easy drinking, cheap, but very well made American beer. But in general, this beer is worthy of your time!"

"Good crisp light colored lager"
"I had never drank this Anchor brand before, but, I must say, I was impressed.  It's so much tastier than the macro lagers.  I particularly enjoy the bite at the end of a mouthful.  Not too bitter, but just enough to remind you this is a beer to enjoy.  It holds its head and carbonation fairly long, and like all beers, it is much better when poured into a glass.  I hope to find this beer in a bottle next time instead of a can. I'll bet it's even tastier."
"This one was a very nice Anchor offering, not their best by any means but certainly not their worst either, a great pale lager that comes out miles ahead of the run-of-the-mill macro crap. The clean and crisp taste with the hints of citrus were excellent and the beer was a very easy one to drink; a beer well worth picking up."
"Why can't I leave just a number rating?"
"Looks golden, very bubbly, beautiful head. Light&tasty"
""
""
""
""
"A thick and clingy off-white head tops this golden-orange brew.  Smells sweet and grassy.  Crisp and fruit-forward with a hint of spice and a slightly bitter finish.  Exceptionally well-mannered with a super clean body.  Absolutely top-notch drinking right here."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a clear gold color.  1/3 inch head of an off-white color.  Good retention and good lacing.  Smells of pale malt, yeast, hint of sweet malt, hint of hops, and a doughy bread aroma.  Fits the style of an American Pale Lager.  Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level.  Tastes of strong pale malt, slight sweet malt, slight yeast, and a hint of hop.  Overall, an average to good American pale lager.  Nothing outstanding, but a simple, flavorful, beer."
""
""
"O - Surprisingly bitter. Tastes a lot like a hoppy Pils. I enjoyed it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Transparent wheat field color with bubbly white head that fades. Aroma of fresh grains, cereal, mild honey. Tastes crisp: cereal, fresh grains, honey, cereal sweetness, and dry. Light in body with light carbonation. Crisp and mildly sweet."

"Had this poured into a pint glass, my fourth Anchor review. Not usually a big lager guy, but I was in the mood, and this one wasn't bad I must say. The color is a clear golden, dark for a lager though. Limited head, but good lacing for a lager. The taste was malt and biscuits, definitely a slight sweetness to it. Mild aroma, nothing too exciting. Decent."

"Overall I thought this was a good beer and I thought it was a very nice example of the style, it had pretty much all the aspects that I look for in the style, but this one managed to have more flavor and more of a body while still keeping those nice crisp and clean lager characteristics,  This beer had good drinkability, it was smooth, very crisp, fairly clean, a little prickly, just slightly filling and the taste did a decent job at holding my attention, I could drink a few of these, but they might start to get just a little filling if I really start to session it.  What I liked the most about this beer was the taste and the mouthfeel, I liked how they managed to give this beer a bigger body while still keeping it very lager like.  What I like the least about this beer was nothing, there isn't a single aspect that I didn't fit into the style and there's nothing that I would change since it's good just the way it is.  I would buy this beer again when in the mood for a good Lager and I recommend this to anyone who is a fan of the style.  All in all I thought this was a tasty Lager and I enjoyed drinking it.  It's now one of my favorite Lagers and I think it's one of the better beers that Anchor makes.  Good job guys, this was one tasty Lager, keep up the hard work."

"Golden color with a big white head, it's light bodied and well carbonated. Has that classic lager aroma with a little lemon and slight banana esters. Taste had a slight tang which I didn't fault it for, it was malty and finished clean, but I definitely didn't note it for any complexity. A versatile beer that's refreshing any time."
"I would like it except for that bitterness."
""
""
""
""
""
"A nice full-bodied lager beer.  Different in flavor from German style lagers such as Beck's or St. Pauli Girl."
"Initially tasty and refreshing, don't really like the after taste"

"Overall – Crisp, crackery, and somewhat moderately hopped for a lager.  This is a nice summer time brew with a good flavor, but having a quite refreshing taste and feel."

"Overall:  This is a pretty good beer.  Nice flavors of toasted malt and caramel-like sweetness.  The only knock I have against it is that, to my taste, there’s a touch too much hops.  I much prefer Anchor’s Steam beer over this one.  Hop heads should really like this one, though."

"Overall- a really good beer from Anchor, not as good as their Anchor Steam or Porter offerings but worth a try."

"A super, historical salute!  A great pale lager, hopped just right, and a tribute to Anchor's diversification!  Love the cans !!! (though I'd suggest doing away with the red background, making it gold, and keeping the crest red.)"
""
""
""
""
"12 oz. bottle.  Poured in glass.  Taste of hops.  A bit of a lingering malt aftertaste.  Reminds me of a pale ale."
""
""
""
""
""
"This might be one of the best pre-prohibition lagers I have had. It is a very clean beer with just enough bitterness to balance things out. It's crazy to think this is what American lagers used to taste like"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured from a 12 oz. can. Has a golden color with a 1 inch head. Smell is of malts, sweet. Taste is malty, light hops, a bit of sweetness and grains, very easy drinking. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a solid lager and good session beer."
""
"Overall: Too thick, too dry, too hoppy. Not a fan."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall if your looking for a smooth lager with a good hop bitterness pick this up. Love the label with the bear."
"Overall it’s easy to drink and quite pleasurable to consume I recommend at least a six pack to absorb it all in."
""
"Presentation: Packaged in a custom brown glass bottle, with a twist-off crown, served in a Samuel Adams Boston Lager sensory glass. The label art, with its retro theme is really apropos, it feels like a beer rescued from an ancient cellar."
""
""
""
""
"Wow, that can went quickly. Proof positive, that I dig it."
""
""
""

"O: A good and sessionable lager, fine for summer cookouts. Everyone will like this one."

"Overall: I was expecting to be underwhelmed but this is actually rather good; a great crossover beer to bring to a BBQ"
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a golden honey in color with a good 1/2 finger white thick head that lasts the whole drink. Lots of lacing is seen when sipped that clings along the sides of the glass. The aroma is of malts with a slight hint of caramel as well. More going on with the taste actually as the malts, crackers & biscuit and grassy hops comes together with a slightly dry finish. Crisp and clean with no harsh or bitter aftertaste. Perfect carbonation. Usually not a big fan of Pale Ales but this one is very good."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - I found this to be enjoyable. Uncomplicated, clean and pretty well balanced. A unique tasting lager."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Almost to simplistic, but so clean and enjoyable for the summer. Not my favorite lager, but already growing on me more as I finish the bottle. Something I really enjoy and will revisit."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall (4.25): This, in my opinion, is an outstanding example of the style, hitting all the right notes while still incorporating some distinct flourishes—light but not too light, refreshing but not without character, flavorful but not overpowering, etc. Awesome beer, and even better that it’s in a can."
""
""
"Very clean. True barley grain flavors with a moderate bitterness level. Low in hop flavor, with some light grassiness. Easy drinking mouthfeel with balanced flavors, carbonation, and light body."

"A little different from other good lagers. Not necessarily better, but different."
""
"M - Great amount of carbonation to this style. Goes down well and one of the only lagers you can drink slowly and enjoy."
"EDIT 6/10/14 - I've been spending a lot more time with this beer and have upped my ratings a bit. I now consider this my personal favorite lager produced in the US. It possesses all the cleanliness, crispness and breadth/depth of flavor of the finest German lagers but is quintessentially 100% American. I will usually have 6 or 8 different brands and styles of craft beer in my fridge, all great brews, but when the CA Lager is amongst them, I almost always find myself instinctively reaching for just another one of them until they're gone. An absolute gem of a lager that stands up to anything produced in the world today."
""
""
""
""
"12 oz bottle. Pours golden with tall, long lasting, fluffy white head and nice lacing. Aroma is of piney hops and biscuit malt. Body is medium and crisp. Good amount of herbal hops balanced by biscuit malt on the palate. Finish is long and herbal. Nice summer brew."
""
"A nicely balanced, clean and crisp lager on the palate with a bready malt flavor and a floral hop note coming along as well. A light touch of bitterness before it goes down oh so smooth. Medium-bodied with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, an excellent go-to beer that shows that yellow and fizzy pale lagers CAN be good!"
""
""
""
"O: This is an above average lager that's definitely refreshing after a long day of work. Paired well with my expertly cooked turkey burger. I can see this being a great summer lager. I only picked up a single, but I'm definitely going to grab a six pack of it. Nothing mind blowing, but it's one of the better lagers I've had lately."
"Pours clear gold color with a ton of bubbles racing up it to a 1 finger snow white head that faded and left minimal lacing and a thin layer on top; typical boring lager looks. Smells of malt, grains, light caramel and faint floral hops; smells like a sweet bready lager with a hint of fruit – pretty cut and dry nose with no exciting aspects. Tastes like malt, grains, wheat bread crust, caramel, light floral hops, herbs and pear with a little hoppy bitterness. The finish is malty with a lemon zest zing that trails off dry. Mouthfeel is light and crisp, with light carbonation, a very light body and a slightly bitter malty finish on the dry side. An above average malty lager, but not one I’d run out to get again anytime soon."
""
""
""
"New Anchor, at least in Texas. It forms a pale gold beer in the glass with a dense though small head. The nose offers mostly grainy malt, though with a nice floral hop underpinning. The taste is decent for a session lager: some nice initial bitterness up front, light hop flavor, and clean malt that's only slightly grainy. Though fairly generic, it is pretty drinkable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I'm really impressed with this lager. Any drier and it would (vaguely) resemble that Carling Dry I had a few weeks back."
""
""
""
""
"Taste / Palate: I am picking up the same biscuity and white bready maltiness. It’s dry overall and finishes with some mild grassy/herbal/botanical hop bitterness. The palate is light with a well carbonated feel."
"Nice color, good head. Nice clean hop flavor and a slightly caramel flavor. A good beer if drinking just a few, but may get a little heavy after several...just sayin"". Anchor beers are dependably consistent and this one does not let you down. Also, a touch of bread/yeast???. Head maintains and dissipates slowly..."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - easy to drink lager that does not offend. Nothing particularly complex or interesting, just tasty."
""
"Taste: This is a great tasting lager, I know people will say. Its a lager nothing special there, but this one is a better than normal lager. A ""California"" lager apparently which has a slightly different take on the style but well worth the pursuit, if you run across it for a decent price, which I did."
""
""
""
""
""
"Home tasting, 12oz bottle into Tulip Glass. 5/4/14."
""
"Overall - A simple and sessionable lager. Good bitter hops in the taste, along with bready malts that makes this an excellent choice for summer."
""
""
"O: This is a very good, confident lager from Anchor. It's not a very sexy style at the moment, but this beer is executed nicely and draws you in sip by sip."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Well done!"

"I am someone who loves all types of beers and have been into craft beer for decades. in general I believe that lager beers don't get the respect they deserve where some of the best beers on planet earth are lagers, dark lagers, light lagers, bocks, doube bocks, pilsners, etc. etc. anyway, I love a hoppy pilsner and have tried them all but this Anchor Lager, not exactly a pilsner, but simply the best hoppy lager I have ever tried. this beats Victory or Firestone Walker by a mile. I can't get enough of this beer. I have gone through like three cases and the beer stores in AZ are running out. please brew more and ship to Arizona."
""
""
""
"At first glug, all I could think of was how much this resembles Anchor's purportedly (and thankfully) distinct steam beer (trademark duly omitted) - that weird yeastiness, bordering on some sort of unwelcome bacterial action, and an everyman pale maltiness. Colour me still uninterested, yet at the same time thankful for the freebie, in the sense that I didn't blow north of 15 bucks on a wasted (in the entirely wrong sense of word) sixer."
""
""
"I wish this particular beer was more readily available in my region. We seem to get a rather limited subset of the Anchor lineup to date. I had yet to see this one here in Alberta at all until today, on tap at Beer Revolution and going in 12 oz. tulip glasses. Coolness. You know a brewery is shooting for historical accuracy when they single-hop a beer with Cluster, which is surprisingly still grown in this era during which Cascade is now considered old-fashioned by some. Somewhat unusual color for the style, a golden apple juice hue that is just darkening into a coppery bronze, with maybe an inch of white bubbles on top. Aroma is rather vinous and citric, evoking white wine, lemon zest, fresh grass, and subdued doughy malt. Tingles the nose. Taste includes these elements as well, with extremely crisp and dry middle and end sections. Some faint grass and green tea notes accompany something else that evokes sour fruit and tannins (think quinine from tonic water, perhaps), with a hint of butter (diacetyl?). The total package is just a hair thicker than the usual aggressively carbonated lager. Leaves a nice sheetweb lacing on the glass. If this could be found in bottles here I'd gladly pony up the extra dough the next time I need a 6-pack of yard beer. Like an AAL crafted to have more floral, spicy hop notes and none of that cloying artificial sweetener character. You'll obviously be able to find more aggressively hopped lagers if you are so inclined, but this take on an American classic hits crisp and refreshing clear out of the ballpark despite a slightly thicker mouthfeel."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, for the style, I'd say this is an excellent American lager and certainly worth having in the fridge. I only had one of these in my recent mixed case from Craft Beer Cellar. I'll have to see if I can get a six pack locally."

"Overall- A definite lawnmower, BBQ, and Asian food beer. Above average to good. Not my favorite style but I would drink this if it were offered. A must try if you've never had a pre-Prohibition style lager before."
""
""
"Pours a golden hue with a rather creamy three finger head and lacing everywhere,the smell is very beery it's herbal hops,pale malts and yeast,the feel is creamy,smooth bodied and well carbonated with tastes exactly like the nose it's herbal zesty hops evened out with those pale malts and yeah there is nothing exciting about it but a well executed lager and a nice session brew cheers."

"12 ounce bottle into lager glass, bottled on 12/3/2013. Pours crystal clear pale golden amber color with a 1-2 finger fairly dense white head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of lemon, pear, apple, cracker, bread, herbal, floral, grass, light pepper, and herbal/yeast earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance of malt, hop, and yeast ester notes; with solid strength. Taste of lemon, pear, apple, cracker, bread, herbal, floral, grass, light pepper, and herbal/yeast earthiness. Slight earthy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of cracker, bread, pear, apple, herbal, floral, grass, light pepper, and herbal/yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very pleasant, clean, and well balanced malt, hop, and yeast ester flavors; with solid robustness without feeling watery, and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth and crisp mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a nice pale lager style. Well balanced hop, malt, and yeast ester flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A nicely enjoyable offering."

"Pretty good - a nicely crafted lager. The yeast profile is reminiscent of Anchor's Steam Beer; I presume the same strain was used for this. Looks great, while the aroma and flavour are light and vaguely fruity. A faint harshness in the background detracts from the flavour. Decent body. Goes down easily enough, and has spades more character than a typical American macro. Worth sampling if you come across it."

"Poured one and a half bottles into a 1/2 liter stein with a clear golden color with a frothy one finger white top.Aromas of toasted grain and minerla mainly,a tinge of caramel sweetness.A nice flavor profile that mildly sweet,lightly toasted grain along with some honey and sweetish pizza dough.A pretty damn solid American lager,will be good to throw back while smoking some sausage and shoulders this spring."
""
"Overall, not a bad lager."

"12oz bottle. Pours a clear golden color with no head. Some lacing. The aroma is of sweet cereal and malts. Slightly sour with some caramel and toasted malts. The taste is more of that sweet cereal with the caramel and toasted malts. Hints of floral hops. Lots of bread and cereal flavor. Light mouthfeel with a medium body. Very drinkable with not much of an alcohol presence but that's expected. Overall, a decent easily quaffed beer with a good amount of flavor."
""
""
""
"Overall this is an enjoyable lager showing there was much better beer around pre-prohibition than there was in the 80's. Worth a try if you like lagers."
""
"Overall OK but not great, started OK but got a little syrupy sweet and not too crisp, hops are a little stronger than expected but not bad, so a decent beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Decent, but much fruitier than I expected. I thought that this would be similar to Anchor Steam and maybe that's where the problem came in. Just a bit too grainy and appley for me."
""
""
""
""
"O: This beer is easy to drink and doesn't have very strong aromas or flavors so it seems like it would pair well with lighter fare meals."
""
""
""
""
""
"Notes: Never had a pale lager like this before, it has elements of a Pilsner and Helles. This is a unique and delicious beer."
""
""
""
"I only bought one bottle of this but since it was so light on the alcohol, I could have easily had a few more in one sitting. Those who love the Steam or the seasonals may be a bit disappointed here since this fell just a bit short of those but like everything else they brew, this was true to stylistic form and enjoyable, in a subtle way that increases by each sip."
""""Overall: Brisk, clean, refreshing.""". Yeah I have to agree. It finishes crisp, just like I like my Lagers to. This is an above average Lager and Im kinda sorry I only bought one bottle in a sample 6."
""
""
""
"Overall: Brisk, clean, refreshing."
"Poured to a light head, white, with mild retention and little lacing. Appearence was clear with a golden straw color. Aroma was light with grain and some floral notes. Taste had notes of grass, light hops and some citrus. Mouthfeel was mild to light with a dry aftertaste and a nice bitter bite at the end."
""
"Poured into a Seattle Beer Week pint glass. Pours a light to medium golden amber with a brief white head dissipating quickly to a thin ring around the glass. Mild lager aroma of bready malt, light apple juice and a hint of hops. Flavor follows, with mild bready and biscuit malt, light apple juice, and a pleasant light neutral hop finish. Light to medium bodied. A pleasant low key lager, but similar enough to Anchor's other light beers that I can't really tell them apart from memory. A nice recreation of a historical style, but maybe I've moved on since the 1800s."
"O: A competent lager and a nice history lesson, just not very exciting. It's rather boring, frankly, but it would go well with food."
"Serving type: bottle"

"Overall a well-crafted lager from Anchor, enjoyable and balanced."
"Overall- easy drinking, could drink a whole six pack."

"Pours a clear golden yellow with a foamy bone head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, and grassy aromas. Taste is much the same with grain, grass, and fruity flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that is tasty but has a slightly better smell to me."
""
"Overall: Very interesting and I am glad this made it's way to Maryland. Only problem is that at $11.99 a six pack, I wouldn't make this a regular go to."
"And it smells almost as good. Fresh grain – like really good Middle Eastern bread, or a sack of malts, or caramel corn. Dandeliony hops give the slightest of nods. Chewy and airy, balanced and zesty – a lager to sink your teeth into. It is first and foremost a showcase for pure malt flavor – I involuntarily picture amber waves of grain when I take a sip. Bready and substantial, with a rich nuttiness like halva. The hops creep in, along with the bubbles, with their slightly soapy lemon-lavender flavor, to whip the malts into shape. Juicy. Refreshing. Balanced. Full of character. Superb!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall / Drinkability: I like just about everything that Anchor puts out so I'm trying to be objective here but I will wonder out loud if I'm not capable of that. Nicely hoppy, with a different hop profile than all the other hoppy CA beers out. If this is what beer was like in CA in the late 1800s, I'd be happy if this was all there was. I do think it would be better with food, and I'm thinking some stronger tasting seafood, as one is enough for me without food. Nice at the end of the day, but I'm not wanting another right now. Another tomorrow yes, and maybe another one the day after that, but not one right after the other. The only thing I didn't quite care for was the carbonation - but Lagers are supposed to have a bit more carbonation. I think it's just me wanting thicker and less carbonated beers lately."

"O: A solid re-creation of a ""classic"" 19th century lager. Just enough flavor and aroma to make it appealing and highly drinkable. For the classic American lager fans"
""

"Overall a tasty session lager."

"If you had this blind you wouldn't believe it was a 4.8% pale lager. This is heavily hopped, full flavored and full bodied making for an excellent session beer."
"It seems Anchor is still in good hands."

"lots of lagers this month for me, and maybe none more satisfying than this one all things considered. I like anchor this fall, bottling (or at least distributing) a few new ones. this is a full bodied and full flavored lager, caramel in color and boasting almost an inch of just off white suds on top, airy but patient. it smells like it should, slightly rich, dry though, with a complex grain engine and delicate hop accents. the flavor is spot on, not sweet at all, not bitter, not thick not thin, not sharp and muted, but balanced in a sense of the term reserved for the best of the best. definitely malt forward, but there a lot of complex subtleties to this. heavier than some, I cant drink a sixer in a sitting, but I don't need to be able to in order to enjoy this one. a little filling, a lot flavorful, well done again by the brewery that can do no wrong. a lager worthy of repeating."

"O: Easy drinking and with the low ABV, definitely sessionable. Not sure how many of these I would desire to have in a single session as there is not that much interesting to the flavors of the beer. Probably would have made a great beer for enjoying as I grilled but I only got the chance to sample it as the grilling season is starting to wind down (only grilling out about 1 time per week vs. 2-3 nights over the summer when it is to hot to run the oven in the house)."

"Medium/light bodied with a moderate amount of carbonation and finishes very clean. Perfectly balanced flavor and refreshing. This could be one of top all malt American pale lagers I have had ever tasted. If you see it buy it!"

"After my first round of tasting this lager I was sure it had at least three kinds of hops. It's nicely bittered, has an herbal leafy hop flavor, and it has a very pleasant and gentle hoppy aroma. To my surprise I learned that in fact this lager is only brewed with cluster hops. This beer has given me a greater appreciation for the complexity and versatility of that strain. I'll be using more of it in my home brews in the future. I highly recommend this lager I thoroughly enjoyed it."
""
""
""
"O - This beer really took me by surprise. Was expecting a traditional pils/lager flavor based on the aroma and appearance, but then wow - what a kick! ...but in a good way. Love the complexity of the flavors. Would not hesitate in coming back to this beer."
""
""
"Overall: Smells like commercial domestic, but tastes like a cradt brewery. Good stuff."
""
""
""
""
""
"A good well made brew."
"O - Definitely worth a try. Seeing this style come out from Anchor is very exciting, and as usual they did not disappoint. It is great to see them not have to fallow in the ""let's just make a [insert style] and load it with American hops"" like both craft brewers big and small do today."

"Soft and supple feel, biscuity malt, light apple and a vague herbal bitterness in the aftertaste. Smooth and very drinkable, simple but still flavorful. Prototypical example of the APL style."
""
"The lager is surprisingly crisp, clean and refreshing as it shows no apparent off flavors and keeps its balance well in tact. Its a fabulous beer that is sure to fare exquisitely with sushi and Cobb salad."

"Overall, a superlative and flavorful lager."
""
"Interesting and quite drinkable, but on the sharp and thin side. I like what they say is a historic use of Cluster hops. Maybe this is a good niche for Anchor-- interpreting classic brews from the past-- that don't involve Babylonian recipes. From the 12 oz bottle purchased at Bottlecraft in San Diego."
""
""
""
"Sparklingly clear golden color with a small, sticky head above. Clean, simple aroma of surprisingly fruity lager yeast and a little floral character. Clean yeast, slight biscuit and cereal grain, and light fruit such as pear and grape. Light and soft with a satisfactorily crisp end. A pretty nice, neat little beer that I might pick up in the future if I'm looking for something on the less-hoppy end of the pale lager spectrum."
""
""
""
"Excellent label. Pours a clear vibrant gold with a nice build of white foam. Cluster hop forward with its dirty, spicy, rustic flavor. Malt lends a clean cereal flavor with a pleasant faint corn note that gives it a nice old school American lager feel. Firm bitterness on the finish. Yeast throws off just a hint of apple and sulfur adding complexity. Surprisingly full bodied. Anchor knocked this one out of the park - a great example of an historic American lager that still holds its own today. Love the aggressive Cluster hopping and sub 5% ABV."
""
""
"There's a sweetness I never expected--almost like strawberries. Good hop counter-balance in the swallow. Full-bodied particularly for a light colored lager. High carbonation. Not necessarily as light and refreshing as you'd expect from a pale lager. It truly lands like an ale."
""
""
""

"Really nicely done for the style. If you're a Budweiser or Coors drinker, you could do worse than to give this beer a try."
""
"O: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, mild kick, good representation of style, this is a solid poundable beer to drink for a long time."
"I could do one or two of these, then it would be time to move on to something with a more agreeable flavor profile, was hoping for more from these guys"
""

"Overall, this is a craft version of a macro style lager even more than the steam beer is. Good flavors, but nothing special as far as a breakout from the style."

"O-Easily one of the better American Lagers I've had the malt worked well with the light citrus flavors."

"Low C"
"California Lager?!? It seems like a contradiction on terms to me, but I promise to give it a fair shake, as I do for every beer. This is a very carbonated beer, so even a gentle pour seems to create a lot of dense, pillowy, French-vanilla colored head which also gives the beer a pseudo-cascading effect as it settles. Color was a deep-gold with NE-quality clarity and once more, Croesus and King Midas were fighting over it, now joined in the fray by Mammon. I have no time for their antics, so I leaned in for a sniff. The nose was clean, very much a lager, with a grainy maltiness and a grassy hoppiness that put me in mind of a German Pils. Mmmm. Mouthfeel was soft, I mean like as in soft water and the taste was very grassy, very much Noble hops, although I was not getting the malt the way that I did on the nose. Finish was dry and refreshing, but I kept thinking that I wished that they had allowed the malt to play better with the grassy hops. Not bad, but I know several PA breweries that make lagers that I will stick with/to, at least for the time being."
""
"As a fan of Anchor Porter and lagers in general, when I saw this recently I had to pick up a six pack. Unfortunately, I was very disappointed with this one. It smells and tastes like an IPA, not a lager. The grassy hops pervade the nose and leave a lingering potent bitterness that only IPA lovers would enjoy. Yes, there is substantial maltiness up front, but it is quickly overcome by the strong hops. If the hops were cut to about a quarter of the current level this would be an outstanding lager."
"It's not bad, but it's not the smooth lager it's building itself up to be. I was hoping for something a la ""Totally Naked"" by New Glarus, but I got a light pale ale. Considering Anchor's bock, they over-hop their lagers. Again, not a BAD brew, but not a very good lager (especially considering the billing)."

"12oz bottle, brilliantly golden with a creamy, white head that holds decent retention and leaves a little lace. Aromas are typical for the style - lager yeast, grassy hops, biscuity grain. Tastes are fresh & crisp, grassy hops, yeast, easy drinking. Creamy, lighter body, moderate carbonation. Overall, nothing wrong with this one - good example of the style."
""
""
""

"It is good to see a world class brewery presenting a standard and flavorful lager. I will probably have this one again this summer."
""
""
"A refreshing and simple (in a good way) way lager that is true to the style. Could be an excellent crossover beer for someone."

"Nice structure with this beer. Nothing fancy, but a nice clean lager. A little on the bitter side, and that can work well with food. These guys found a nice summer beer here."
""
""
""
"Overall, a pretty nice lager. It's a bit too thick and sweet to me, and I wish it was more crisp, clean and dry tasting. Still a pretty good beer though."
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a very solid offering from Anchor. While I still prefer Trumer, this would be great on a hot day. If they were to get more attenuation or just bring down the sweetness in another way then this would be a great brew."
"Overall- A tasty and easy drinking lager."
"O -- I'd like to think this is what a true pre-prohibition beer tasted like, though I have the feeling the hop-rate is a little bigger in this one. Nonetheless, this is a great tasting beer that's perfect for quaffing every day. Has a good, though mild malt character and a good amount of hop bitterness to be paid attention. A damn fine take that ought to make some macro drinkers (old or nuveau) take note."

"I really enjoy that this is available year round as of this year - but I especially love using this as a replacement for all of the rather generic summer beers that come around this time of the year. I could have a ton of these in one session. Anchor really made an everyday, crowd-pleasing beer here... But it's quite tasty and one of the best German style lagers I've had in America in a long time."

"It pours a manila tan-gold color with generous foaming. There’s a light honeyed aroma with just a hint of that signature Anchor Steam yeast character. It’s delicately hopped. The flavor is crisp with just a touch of the hop character. Finishes effervescent & light. Overall I found this a tasty take on the much maligned lager. Paired well with tacos."
"Pours what some may refer to as ""fizzy yellow beer"" though I hate to associate such a great brewery with such a morbid description, but I have to call a spade a spade here. Smell is sweet and malty with some grassy notes in there as well. Taste is also sweet and malty, slightly herbal and mildly bitter. Finish is very clean, lively carbonated and a lingering bitterness from the hops. Has moments of coming across like and English pale in flavor but has a light body. Extreme easy drinker - great session beer for the long warm California days of summer."

"O: not bad at all.... the ""missing link"" between the macro swill and the quite-malty domestic all-malts I've enjoyed"

"O: A solidly bitter and very flavorful light lager. I could see myself buying this to always have a refreshing beer on hand."
""
"O: This is an excellent drinking pale lager, well worth a try if you're in Cali."

"Overall it's a great lager that reminds me of a German Octoberfest beer. I would like to try this on draft as a comparison."
"This is pretty much what I'll be comparing future American lagers to, for the foreseeable future."

"If I was purely rating to style, my score would be even higher. This beer is very clean, light and refreshing with no real off-flavors. On top of that, it doesn't cheat by loading the beer up with hops and comes in at a low price point. It's a good looking lager, too. Nice bright yellow-gold color with a creamy white head that sticks around for quite a long time. Perfectly transparent. The aroma is so clean that I'm not quite sure how to rate it. There's a little bit of sweetly yeasty, doughy malt flavor and a touch of floral/herbal hops, maybe a tad bit citric. The taste starts sweet with squeaky clean, fresh, bright malt. Quickly, an herbal hop bitterness combines with a tart yeast flavor to dry the beer out. The finish is lightly malt sweet with more hop flavor/bitterness and tart yeastiness. It reminds me of a toned down German pilsener with that refreshing hard water crispness. The finish particularly has a lingering mineral character. The beer drinks very easily and sits on the palate as light as can be. I'm not exactly about to run out to the store to buy more, but if I needed a macro lager substitute, I would go with this beer."
"O: good beer. Would I order another?! Still thinking about that..."
"O: Simple and straightforward, I can see why this would be a popular beer for the working class in the 19th century. While this isn't something I would actively seek out, it's good to get some perspective on much how beer has changed in the last 100 or so years."

"In terms of an APL how can this not be close to perfect for the style? Beautiful old gold sunset with the slightest crimson hue. Beautiful clarity with a billowy cap of eggshell foam, sticky cobwebs all over as i drink this one down. Nose brings cereal, cornflakes, some graham as well as a light floral/herbaceous character to go along with a light, pleasant bitterness. Would i rate it as high compared to my fav stouts and ipas? No way but i am rating it to style and it deserves the high marks - expertly crafted and extremely drinkable."
""
" I am not particularly a lager drinker, but this one would rate as one of my favorites. It would probably be my go to lager were it not for the price. That, however, may just be because it is not available in the supermarkets in my area and I purchased it at a small specialty store."
"Live life drink beer!!!:-)"

"Overall a nice clean lager from Anchor Stream, something lighter that is well suited to drink with lunch."
"I think Anchor has got something nice here. It's like a fancy coors ha. This will replace a lot of summertime beers for me."
"Tasted from draft at Anchor Brewing's tasting room. More hoppy than a typical lager, which is appropriate for California beer if atypical for the style. Pleasant piney taste with crisp, mouthwatering finish. Thin lacing. Pleasant effervescence. Crispness makes it right at home in the ranks of German lagers- interesting, since the crispness seems to come from hops instead of water minerality. I'll be having lots of this while I visit the Bay Area!"
