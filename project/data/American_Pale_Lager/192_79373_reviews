"Good rendition of a full flavor extra hoppy lager. A little ""tinny"". I'd buy again if I wanted that style but didn't feel like an AAL. Mouthfeel is a little bit sticky so not overly refreshing, might be better ice cold"

"I came across a 12-pack variety of New Belgium and decided to try the pale lager. I haven't been entirely impressed with these types of beers from other brewers but from New Belgium it was very good.  The pale lager has a dark tinge with a beautiful white and puffy head along with really good lacing - the best I've seen in quite some time. I was also impressed with the wheaty scent along with the distinctive IPA smell (and the other plus for me was there was none of the over bitterness that comes with an IPA).  Overall, it was a great beer and I'm glad I've got a few more to go through."
""
""
"Had this one in a can.  Good flavor, and a slightly different version of the usual pale.  Not super-hoppy as some of their newer offerings tend to be, and I could taste a bit of the fruity flavor that is advertised.  It's a little atypical for this brewery, and I'm glad they took a chance to make this style."
""
""
""

"Pours a very nice dark golden color, very nice carbonation, two-finger creamy white head, which leaves tons of sticky lacing behind. The nose is hoppy with a nice touch of malts, some citrus, very slight yeast note. The taste is very nice hoppy, with some maltiness, nice touch of citrus. Medium body, with a nice bitter/dry finish. Overall a pretty tasty brew, would buy again."

"Aroma of hoppy fruits, apricots or apples. Honey and pale malts, lots of bready aromas. Taste has a bright upfront fruity taste with a lingering malty finish, minimal bitterness. Crisp and tasty, good addition to NB lineup."
""
""
"Pours a clear bright yellow in color with a good 2-finger foamy white head that settles down to a good 3mm or so after a bit. A good amount of lacing is seen when sipped, almost rings. The aroma is nothing real special, just of some grains with a light hint of sulfur. Bit more going on with the taste as there is a slight hint of fruit and citrus zest in the mix as well. Does have a tad of a hoppy finish. Lighter bodied with a good amount of carbonation. Not a big fan of this style of brew overall."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Refreshing with a good balance between the hops and the malts."
""

"Very fruit beer with a slight tartness, though something was out of balance here."

"I don't have much to say about this one.. Mostly that the taste is a bit metallic ...or something. I don't know, but I'm not all that impressed by this New Belgium. That's not to say its a bad beer or that I would turn one down, but it wouldn't be my first choice for a pale ale."
""
""
""
""
""
"Not the cleanest and most refined of lagers, but definitely a lot of flavor in a refreshing beer. Slightly disappointed I just have the one can of this one - would be curious to see how it strikes me on another day."

"Beer: Golden color; no distinct flavors, but hints of wheat, honey, vague malt and citrus (very vague). I don't know if I taste much of anything here, still it has a nice taste. Strange, but totally enjoyable. A lingering taste."

"Golden amber pour with a bright white a frothy head. This beer is crystal clear with lots of carbonation rising from the bottom of the glass. The lacing is fine but irregular but does stay with the glass. The aroma is classic lager- biscuit and grassy, mild hops. There are hints of tropical fruits, but they are illusive at best. The body of this beer is heavier than expected from a lager, but the difference is welcoming. The palate is crisp and clean with nice malty notes balanced nicely with a piney hop bitterness. The hops continue through the finish and linger for a good 20 seconds. Overall, a very well done lager and a fantastic sessionable beer."

"A rather good amalgam of styles, very altbier-esque. Fruity, vinous, and pretty enjoyable - I hope to see the canned version available up here by summertime!"
""
"Overall - Decent beer, has a nice sweet citric flavor mixed in with pale malts. I guess the only knock about the beer is none of the flavors jump out at you, and you are left feeling a little unsatisfied. Great price, and its in cans, so its worth a drink for sure."

"Pale golden fresh cut hay with a bit of an orange copper glow, brilliant white head forms thick and fills the chalice with love. Aromatics offer up biscuit malt, mild grassy citric notes crisp blend of malts, hops, water...almost a pungent tartness in the nose. Flavor perfectly complex drinking lager, all malted barley goes along way with flavor...biscuit malts bring a bready resilience with the herbal/mineral/citric notes coming from the hops very clean snappy finish. Those hops stick around more than the average end of shift lager that this country knows all too well. I saw it labeled for 16.99 a 12 pack, which I didn't jump on however I did grab about four cans for $1.69 just enough to wet the whistle. Crisp even carbonation perfect mouthfeel semi dry finish linger hops accent the breadiness perfectly it's a true American Lager thank heavens for New Belgium. Overall I will definitely grab more of this class expression of true drinking beer."

"This is one of the better offerings from this brewery, at least that make it to my area. I can't do their ""Flat Tire""- too sweet, too ""Beech Nut"" tobacco-y, and too biscuit-y, and could really use some hops. This provides one reason why most of my ratings are on the high side- I don't like to drink beer that I don't like! Cheers, fellow imbibers! :)"

"At cooler temperatures the bright, tropical fruit notes fade a bit and this becomes more herbaceous and green in its hop character, but that Sauvignon Blanc like grape character also starts to come out, which wasn’t noticeable previously. I definitely like this on the warm side of cool 55°F or a bit warmer is better for this particular beer; this is certainly a bit atypical for a lager."

"A decent session lager and worth going through every once in a while."
"Pours brilliant gold with an off-white two-inch creamy head. Settling to a 1-inch pocketed head. Hops and cut grass in the nose. Crisp forwardness with a light malt palate. Fresh, bright and delectably sharp with cereal notes (Corn Flakes?!), however, this is all malt!? My palate must be at odds with reality today. Modest carbonation. Broad Belgian lace forms. It is very nice. May not seek it again, but would not decline if offered."

"Shift pours a dark golden color with a nice large lacing white head. There is a sweet and malty aroma. The taste is also very sweet, malty, and almost has a sugary flavor. Drinkable and has a nice feel, but too sugary. Overall its a very OKAY beer, not horrible but a bit too sugary."

"O- This is a decent beer, but I wouldn't seek it out. Nothing about it is particularly special, but it is easy to drink."

"Pours a yellowy golden with a off white head. A hoppy and earthy aroma of some straw, some grass, some sweet fruit, and some malt. Taste was grainy, a little caramel malt, fruity, and grassy. Mildly bitter. A active but creamy mouthfeel. Overall, probably the lone beer in their regular lineup I like even if this isn't the most well constructed beer out there. Makes for a nice, easy drinking summer session beer. And as a sucker for just about anything to do with nelson sauvin hops, this one is right up my alley."

""
""
""
""
""
""

"O- As it opens it becomes a bit bitey and dry but it is well lagered with the malt a little soft the hops come through and grow in bitterness more than flavor but some woody hop notes start to add a bit of depth as it opens."

"Beer is light to medium-light in body, with enough carbonation to gently foam the beer completely upon the palate. The resulting mouthfeel is soft, foamy, and somewhat creamy. Closes mostly dry, with little residual stickiness hanging on the palate."

"Overall: Very pretty, tastes good. Very New Belgium, tastes like a lot of their brews. Like a band that writes every song in the same key."
"-Overall 3.5: Good, basic beer. I guess the ""shift"" thing is New Belgium's attempt to appeal to the ""common man"" with this beer. While I find that condescending and a bit insulting, nonetheless, the brew itself is pretty good. Certainly not a prize-winner, but that is true of most beer coming from the self-important and (I suppose this goes hand in hand) ""wind powered"" brewery."
""
""
""
""
""
"Atmosphere is very nice. Great head and tons of lacing. Plenty of persistent effervescence too. Nose is Bready and nutty with a little spice. Very well-balance and pronounced. Flavor an equally well-balanced combination of bread, spice, and some punchy hops. Overall, this is a really good quaff."

"O> A pretty average beer that has a few things going for it. It's a reasonably priced beer that comes in a can (cans are perfect for the summer) and it has just enough character to keep things interesting. Perhaps the strangest thing about this beer is the mouthfeel was the highlight. Although this beer is uneventful and inoffensive (I imagine anyone could enjoy this on a warm day) it's lager, and perhaps even a bit adventurous for the style. All around a good beer and I know later this summer when I'm heading to the river, I will grab a couple of these."

"Light bodied with plenty of carbonation. Has an unpleasant aftertaste. I'm glad I only picked up one of these. Not a fan, and I won't be trying this again."

""
"Not a style I visit much, but certainly seems like a good representation."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"The body is light to moderate. Not as crisp as I would have liked. The lingering yeast notes are a bit of a distraction as well. Overall a bit muddled and would like more lager/pils notes and less yeast/esters."

"16 ounce can into pilsener glass, best before 1/27/2013. Pours slightly hazy golden straw color with a nice 1-2 finger dense white head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of lemon zest, apple, pear, cracker, bready grain, floral, grass, pepper, and herbal earthiness. Damn nice and pleasant aromas with good balance and strength. Taste of lemon zest, pear, pepper, apple, cracker, bready grain, floral, grass, and herbal earthiness. Lingering notes of light fruits, pepper, cracker, bread, floral, grass, and herbal on the finish for a bit. Very nice flavor balance and good complexity of hop/malt notes; with zero cloying flavors present after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth and crisp mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with hardly any warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a very nice pale lager. Very nice balance of hop/malt flavors; and extremely smooth and crisp to drink. A very enjoyable and refreshing offering."

"D - Good beer. I would have another."

"Overall: I have been on a bit of an emotional rollercoaster with this beer since I bought a four pack and then a subsequent case (6 x 4 pack) about a week or two ago. The first sip of the first can was an explosion of Nelson Sauvin hops and I immediately declared this beer my new favorite. After a couple more cans over the next couple of days, I was fighting to detect that strong Nelson Sauvin hoppiness I so love and cherish (especially in a beer like Bulletproof Tiger). But since then, I have been literally pounding this beer on a near daily basis. It is just so damn drinkable, balanced, and great tasting (read: LOTS OF FLAVOR FOR A LOW ABV LAGER), if not delicious. Very satisfying from the can or in a glass. This could possibly be my session, daily drinker, beer for life when Sierra Nevada Summerfest is out of season. The only knock is the somewhat high price - I calculated that this works out to about a $40 standard case (as opposed to $30 for Summerfest in my area.) I would love to see more brewers doing more with Nelson Sauvin hops - my new favorite hop alongside Saaz (with Citra running a close third!)"

""
""
""

"I love seeing breweries come out with a fresh, flavorful lager for a change. Lots of malt character in this one adds heart to the brew. Tasty, refreshing and highly sessionable."
"Comes in a pack of 4 cans"
""
""
"My only complaint is that the cans looked a lot like Red Bull."
""
""
""
""
"Overall a super tasty session ale that has enough hoppiness to please the hop snob (like myself) but approachable enough for those of you not buying into the hop craze."
""
""
""
"This beer tastes about the same. Pretty average I suppose for a pale lager, i'm just glad this style is making a name for itself. Compared to other lagers, this brew is a bit hoppier. It's a good thing too."
""
"D- This is one of my favorite warm weather beers, or just a beer to enjoy and not be too serious about. It is a bit on the expensive side, but it is worth trying."
""
""
""
""
""
"Final Thoughts: Not bad. Average average brew but nothing too interesting. I think they were going for a session beer and basically accomplished that goal. Would I drink it again? Probably not."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I did not enjoy the abundance of corn that I was tasting... it wasn't awful, but it wasn't enjoyable, either. Lackluster beer overall, there are many better pale lagers out there. Hell, I'd probably take a PBR over this. Uninspired and blah."
""
"This is a very solid lager. Consistent with the high quality and drinkability of most beers from New Belgium."
""
""
"O - Very solid pale lager. Big flavor for the 5.0% alcohol. This is a must try, and I'll try it again."
""
""
"Taste is spicy-peppery bit with hints of citrus up front, while faint yeasty juiciness and faint honey breadiness with light minerally quality join later. It has lingering light peppery-spicy bitterness with hints of resiny citrus rind (grapefruit). It's good, but a bit thin and flat in character and a bit too sharply bitter, with that element lingering a little too much without anything else"
""
""
""
"O: every American pale lager made by the big three should be embarrassed that they don't taste like this beer, if you have shied away from the pale lager style due to the abuse it has received try this to be pleasantly surprised"
""
""
""
"Not a bad beer overall, especially for a lager, but I was hoping for something more."
""
""
""
"Okay, I'm normally rather unimpressed with New Belgium's standard offerings, but this is pretty good. This is what a ""pale lager"" should be."
""
""
"O: Glad to see a decent, solid lager from these guys. I would probably buy this again and would order another. A nice beer to bring to a party. I'm glad NB is now in MI!"

"Overall a tasty, easy drinking lager that can be enjoyed by anyone who likes beer."
""
"Sometimes simpler is better, and New Belgium get it with thier Shift Lager. It's a golden colored beer, leaving a good proportion of lace around the glass. The nose is no-frills but does the job, bringing floral, crackers, and bread to the mix. And while the taste may also be no-frills to some, there's something about the way this beer seduces me that I can't help but like. Its taste is lead by honey, bready, and floral flavors, and pair that with the flavors having harmony with one another, it wins. Light bodied and moderately crisp, this lager is very easy to drink and very refreshing without boring your palate."
"Overall: I was pleasantly surprised by this beer. I was expecting a slightly varied lager that still fell flat but got a unique beer that's well worth the price!"
""
"Overall: This is a surprising beer. I wasn't sure what to expect, but I certainly enjoyed. This is a sessionable, hoppy lager and though this one was reviewed from a glass I can attest it drinks very well from the tallboy can."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This is a tasty pale lager, one of the best I have had. It still has some of the drawbacks that almost all in the style have, and just won't be able to stand up to the broad complexity of pale ales. But still, if you are not in the mood for to much body and want something to wash down some lunch, this would be a great choice."
""
""
""
""
"Shift was great out of the can and in a glass, and the name is quite fitting as this is a perfect quenching beer to throw down after any shift. Outstanding drinkability, I could drink this on a regular basis and always be happy."
""
""
""
""
""
"Flavorwise this is definitely an easy drinker. It’s lightly bodied and smooth with a clean finish. I get some hints of the hop character on the end, but again it’s there and then gone. This beer ain’t half bad—but next one I have will be to finish a round of drinking rather than the one that gets the fresh palate’s attention. And for the price there’s better options."
""
""
"definitely not my stlye of beer, but i appreciate this one a lot for what it is. it pours a mostly clear wheat beer color, with an active white head that lasts a few minutes before fading down to froth. it smells very malty, without much hops to speak of. the flavor is distinctly czech as far at the malt profile goes. its dry and biscuity, sturdy for such a light brew. it also has a touch of sweetness and a little more hops than the nose suggests, with a bittering conclusion. mouthfeel i like, it has more body than most beers from this genre, and the carbonation is just right. stays bubbly even as it warms, although this is a beer to drink quickly. refreshing and appropriate in any season. this is a pretty decent can of beer, although i liked the mothership wit that it replaced a lot better."
""
""
""

"Overall, this is a good pale lager. New Belgium seldom disappoints. I can't wait for them to come to Ohio."

"O= I enjoyed it. a nice addition to the already great beer selection we enjoy here in MI."
""
""
"Pours a clear gold with a thin white head that fades to a slight haze and soapy ring. Crisp aromas of light, grainy malt, floral hops, and white wine grapes. Love the Nelson Sauvin hops. Taste is similarly crisp, with mild hops, light malt, grass, orange peel, and grapes. Mouthfeel is light and crisp (yes, again), with a medium-thin body and solid carbonation. Overall a lovely session beer, and solid addition to the New Belgium line-up."
""
""
""
"16oz can, canned on 9/2/12, poured into a pint glass. Pours a hazy honey-gold with a frothy head on top. Great sticky lace clings to the glass. Orange zest, lemon, green hops in the nose. The body is crisp, but thins out on the finish. Could use a little more 'snap' to it. NB comes through with big bitter hops as expected. They couldn't just brew a simple refreshing lager, no, this beer is like a MIPA (mild IPA). The bitter character is short-lived though, and there's not a lot else here. It's not the most flavorful beer, other than the oily hops. This was decent, but not what I expected."
""

"Canned lager, great that craft breweries can get their slice of the pie. Pricewise I'd pass on this, it is a heavier take on a lager with a good balance but not even NB's best. I'd take a Blue Paddle over this any day."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Session beer I'd drink more if if it was a little less expensive."
""
"M- Medium bodied, dry finish. Nice session beer and available year around. I can drink this without hesitation."
"Overall I liked and was impressed by this beer and I thought it was a very good example of an American Pale Lager and so far the best one I have tried. It had really good drinkability, it was really smooth, crisp, refreshing, and the flavors did a great job at holding my attention, I could see taking out a four pack on a nice warm summer day, this beer is pretty much the definition of drinkable. What I liked most about this beer was how nice the hop aspect to this beer was and how nicely it was balanced by the bread malts, the balance is really impressive and the drinkability was really nice. What I liked least about this beer was nothing, there isn't anything that I would want to change with this beer, it's great just the way it is. I would for sure buy this beer again, in fact I already got two more four packs before the store jacks the price up, I highly recommend this to anyone and this would make a great choice for someone just getting into craft beer. All in All I was flat out impressed by this beer and it could be one of the best lagers I have ever had, New Belgium hit it out of the park with this one, they gave the people what they wanted, a lager that doesn't suck, great job guys this beer just earned a spot in my beer fridge."

"Bought a can of this at the US Pro Cycling challenge before I realized there was another booth with Ranger. Can't comment on the appearance since I drank it straight from the can so I'll just assume and rate it good. Smell is sort of ""beery"" typical lager smells. Flavor has a nice grassiness followed by malt and lager yeast. This must have been pretty fresh. Honestly though I would never but this beer at a store because its completely overpriced at $9 per four pack. This needs to be in six packs of 12oz cans for like $8. not sure why anyone in Colorado would ever pick this up over OB Mama's Lil Pils..."

"This is a light-bodied sessional to say the least, an excellent ""lawnmower"" beer worthy of several pours. However, it will not overwhelm and could become tiresome after a few. Still a pleasantly drinkable lager and one worthy after a hard day at work."

"O: A terrific go at what beer can be to those folks who may never reach for a barley wine or an imperial stout. It's exactly what it aims to be: a tasty beer after a long day on the job."

"Shift Pale ale is a good beer. The beer poured golden clear with frothy white head that is lacing nicely. The smell has a nice malt character. The taste includes the typical New Belgium Belgium malt. The mouthfeel is light to medium in body with good carboantion. Overall....I like it."

"Golden in color with a white head. Nice clean lager aroma with floral hop notes and a hint of citrus. A bit of yeast and bread, maybe a touch of biscuit in there, too. Flavor is somewhat sweet with a touch of hop bitterness. Good floral notes, light citrus, and a bit of grass. Mild yeast and esters. Well done lager."

"O: A very easy drinking beer. A good alternative to macros when you want to have a few and not not get too full or drunk."
"shift is, as i reckon it was intended to be, a session beer when you want something simple, yet interesting that you can consume multiple rounds without feeling too full or too buzzed. pours a golden yellow lager color, but leaves rings of suds on the side of the glass unlike the typical american macros. the aromas are my favorite part: chardonnay-like tropical fruit from the nelson(?) hops with notes of lemon peel. maybe a bit of crystal malt in the back. i get more mango as the beer slides over the palate. the drawback? a very thin mouthfeel gives this beer a watery feeling. still, i like it and would definitely bring this one along to a cans only venue or a hiking trip. added bonus - the blue and silver can looks mighty close to a red bull can. this might make for a good street sipper or road beer."

"Smooth. Tangy. Medium body. Slight oily. Very soft carbonation."
"O- Passable, drinkable beer with a nice American Pale Ale sort of taste, with a Lager body. Nothing special though."
"Pours out to a fluffy everlasting head, sexy lacing and light gold color. Aroma is grassy and spicy hops and faint grain and lemon. Flavor is spicy hops with lemon, coriander and pilsner malt in the backbone. Mouthfeel is sticky and rough. Light body and appropriate co2. Overall, another beer style that has been newbelgified. Not bad but I've had better."

"Ultimately, I'm not a huge fan of the beer, but it is a lot better than many lagers around. It was an easy second purchase when I went into Total Wine and saw a palate of 4 packs going for only $2.99. No brainer there."
"O: Good drinkability, though I wouldn't want more than two or so pints. I can see what they are going for for sure, but I would like this to be a bit more dry, crisp and a little less sweet."
"Shift Pale Lager pours a crystal clear orange, with some tangerine and lemon highlights coming through. There's a little more than a finger of white foam, with decent head retention and lacing for the style. The nose is a bit on the dull side, but there is some soft grainy sweetness apparent, along with a light aroma of melon from the Nelson Sauvin hops. The flavor starts of similarly, with lightly bready malt notes. The bitterness that flows through next is perceptible, but just barely. Again, the fruity melon finish is very mild. The craft beer hophead in me wishes is was a bit more ""in your face", but as is it works decently as part of an easy drinking lager. The body has just a little bit of sturdyness to it, and the carbonation is pleasantly active. The overall impression of the mouthfeel is definitely very crisp. I was really excited to try Shift Pale Lager because I'm a big fan of Nelson Sauvin hops. Having only had them in hop forward IPAs before, I think my expectation of how hoppy this beer would be could have been a little more tempered. A solid warm weather sessionable beer from New Belgium."

"Shoulda saved myself three dollars and got PBR instead. Woulda got two more to boot!"
"New Belgium Shift Pale Lager: The New Belgium Brewery has a great product set. Their Belgian style Tripel & Dubble are very good and a bargain compared to an expensive imported bomber of the same. So why go head to head with the Buds and PBR’s of the world? The Shift has a darker golden color and a nice billowy head. The aroma of malt and hops is pleasing and indicative of a handmade product vs. the more industrial notes you get from more mass produced products. Good flavor with some bitterness up front, then thinning out into a clean aftertaste. More body than the standard American Adjunct Lager, but still light enough to be easy drinking. So yes, the Shift is a better brew than any of the mass produced lagers from the big brewers. I expected as much from New Belgium, and they delivered. But $9 for four tall boys? The Shift is not that much better than a PBR or a Bud. New Belgium made it big with Fat Tire, which is worth the premium over a Bud if you are in the mood for a good ale vs. a light lager. But if you want a light lager will you pay a premium for a Shift? Not in my book."

"16 ounce can, best before October 7, 2012. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours a clear golden/amber color with an inch off-white head. Head retention and lacing is both good. Aroma is grainy malt, and grassy and citrusy (orange peel, grapefruit) hops. Taste is pretty much just like the aroma, but the bitter hops stand out a little bit more in comparison to the aroma. The flavors also seem a bit stronger than the aroma would lead you to think. Mouthfeel/body is light, it's a bit slick and very easy to drink. Good carbonation. I think this is a good summer brew (and good brew overall). I keep hoping New Belgium will distribute to Ohio in the near future...."

"3.5 D: Decent, easy drinking brew, but there are better ones out there."

"The palate opens mildly bitter with the chalky, powdery Cascade hop flavor and bitterness being most dominant flavor. This is followed by a mild honeyed, toasty, bruleed-sugar malt character. The mid-palate, though, completely vanishes - watery and empty, there's a shocking lack of flavor here. A modest mineral character is present, which complements the hop profile. Drying on the finish with a blend of toast, light bitterness and mild citrus flavors. Light in body with a medium-high carbonation that works, and despite the watery mid-palate, the hops provide just enough resin character to tie the palate together. Solid, definitely worthy."

"The Crack & Glug was music to mine ears! The two fingers of thick tawny head began to fall pretty quickly, leaving some pretty, sticky lacing in its wake. Color was a deep golden-yellow with NE-quality clarity and both King Midas and Croesus called to express their jealousy. Sorry, fellas, but you gotta score your own CAN, dig? I recently listened to Greg Koch rail against fizzy yellow beers (again) and all I CAN say is, more for me! The nose made me weep for what Prohibition has wrought. One adverse aspect of The CANQuest (TM) has been the plethora of AALs from a CAN and I have more than had my fill of them, although there is no end in sight. This smelled not just of the expected malt sweetness, but there were also hops readily evident on the nose! Be still, my heart. Mouthfeel was full, almost creamy, with a wonderful intermingling of biscuit malt initially, followed by a brief rush of minty hops on the tongue. Finish was quite dry with the biscuit malt and hops combination acting nicely in tandem. Great Caesar's Ghost, but this is definitely cooler-worthy and just in time for summer! Get some!"

"The beer pours a golden orange color with a white head. The aroma is a mix of resin and orange citrus from the hops, as well as some biscuit. The flavor also has a good amount of bitterness. I get some lightly toasted malt, as well as some pine, resin and orange citrus. There is also some biscuit malt. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"O=I wan anticipating something more like a Sam Adams' lager, and was hit with a citrus fruit bomb. No way would I consider this a session beer to drink after work. Very sweet and fruity...I was diaappointed."

"16oz Tall Boy with a Best By Date of 23 SEP 12 on the bottom of the can. Lots of lacing. Pours a translucent amber color with over an inch of frothy head. Aromas of tropical and citrus fruits with some dank hop aroma as well. Taste is more of the tropical fruits. Some nice bitterness towards the end. Very flavorful. Nice mouthfeel with lots of carbonation. Had to wait for the head to fade to drink it but it wasnt too long. Overall a well made Pale Lager with alot of flavor thats worth having again."
"O: Easy drinker, quite enjoyable. Can put away a few of these with no problem"

"Drinkability: This is lager for hopheads. I am impressed. At first I was miffed about the price but now think it is partly justified."
"Poured from can into Karbach pint glass. Pours a nice golden pale color, nice head on the top of the beer. Looks like a lager. Smell- grassy hops, bread. Not much more there to describe, but the hoppiness of this is apparent. Taste- Nice grassy assertive hops, not much backbone behind it. Lacking a bit in balance. Really tight carbonation, borderline stingy. This is a nice, refreshing lager, full of hops flavor, and I could easily pound this beer. I'll be coming back to this one for sure again this summer."
"Overall: A fairly fine, tasty lager."

"O: Solid drinker for the lager fans. Tallboy, low abv, modest hopping. I'd say this is a winner."

"This would be good after a long ride or run, but without much flavor, I would reach for something else most of the time."

"This is a medium bodied brew with a modest amount of carbonation. It is light and lively inside the mouth with a crisp finish that you expect from the style. What keeps this back from being above-average for me is the way the buttery notes do not easily transition into the hops and then malt quality. Instead, each aspect seems singular and does not really come together. Overall, it is not a bad brew. It does however include a bit more of an alcohol punch than you would expect for the listed 5% abv."
""
"O: A very good simple pale Helles type lager. This is how the big boys should make them. I was quite impressed by how good this is."
""

"Overall, I was pleasantly surprised. When I see and hear the words ""Pale Lager"" [sic], I generally avoid. Have this beer, and celebrate a new, and better form of this beer style."
""
""
""
"O- This beer isnt bad, its just a little disappointing. Miles ahead of other american adjunct lagers but behind most craft beer and and I would expect something a bit more from New Belgium. Having said that, it is a session-able beer and its good at being just that."
""
""
""
"Overall Shift is very drinkable, but considering its price point, I feel like I should be getting a bit more flavor for my bucks. Money aside, these are easy-drinking beers with a subtle, unique twist thanks to those New Zealand Nelson Sauvin hops and will go down quickly and enjoyably on hot days."
"Great mouthfeel includes a light body, moderate carbonation, a dry finish, and incredibly refreshing! Overall, this could be a favorite pale lager."
""

"Cheers!"
""
""
"For a lager this is a pretty good beer. Poured into a shaker pint, nice golden color, not your piss colored adjunct lager. Smells hoppy for a lager. Taste surprisingly does not live up to the smell. Overall though this is a good good beer, wish it was cheaper though."
"A nice lager that rivals Brewfarm Select for pale lager in cans. A nice addition to New Belgium's portfolio."
"16 oz can, from a beer of the the month six pack from Vintage Cellar in Blacksburg, Virginia, poured into a pint glass. Pours a real nice straw color with a nice white head that dissipates quickly, but leaves nice lacing. Smells of great sweet grain, and a little floral hop smell. Tastes of sweet grain, but unlike most pale lagers, has a nice hop bite. Beer goes down real smooth for this light bodied beer. Overall, a very good beer."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a light golden color with a thick frothy white head. The aroma is mainly grainy with a hint of caramel, lemon peel and more citrus from the hops. It has a nice bready flavor with a touch of sweetness and a slightly bitter finish with lemony and grassy hops. The beer is nice and light with moderate carbonation and a dry finish. For a Pale American Lager this has got to be one of the best, very enjoyable and simple."
""
""
""
"pour is a light golden orange, crystal clear and off white head. The nose is very nice, well balanced grain to faint sweet malt and a zesty herbal hop. The taste follows the nose, great grain presence, very fresh, subtle caramel malt and herbal hops in the back with an assertive carbonation and gentle bitterness. Soft velvety body and crisp clean finish. This is victory esq."
""
"Overall, a pleasant, easy-drinking lager, not crisp but quite smooth. The aroma has a mix of fresh bread and mild fruity hops. The hops character is an easy mix of earthy tangerine and grapefruit with only a hit of bitter rind in the finish. This beer remind me more of cream ale (like a dialed back Sixpoint Sweet Action) for the gentle hops and light barley with a more medium body. Still, I wouldn't mind having a few on a hot day, or any day really."
"O: A nice beer, especially for summer evenings on the patio or porch. It certainly seems to accomplish what it set out to. But the question I ask myself is: why buy NB's Shift for $8.99 a four pack, when I can get a sixer of GL's superior Dortmunder for $10.99?"
""
""
"Overall a tasty quaffable lager."
"D/O: This remarkable beer outshines its modest labeling as a ""pale lager"" by challenging the palate and forcing the drinker to take notice. The look of it alone demands a recalibration of expectations, pouring a deep and healthy honey golden color, rather than the expected light yellow that is more characteristic of the style. Hop qualities are featured throughout, manifesting their extract-like plant attributes in a way that refuses to apologize or appease the masses. Comparisons to Sam Adams Noble Pils come easily, with this beer's flavor profile being not quite as interesting."
""
"From the tall can. I'm always glad to see more variety in canned beers. If we can't have reusable bottles for commercial brews, maybe we can have less weight and easier recycling. This seems like a good choice for a picnic beer."
""
""
""
""
"Clear gold, topped by an airy, yet persistent white head. Grassy, herbal hops are first to the nose...soft, warm, bready grain and some dankness. Crisp spicy hop flavor with mild citrus, clean lager yeast, and dry, almost biscuity malt. There's a nice leafy/oily hop note tying it all together nicely. Medium-light in the mouth - crisp and tidy. They were going for a quality, refreshing, general-purpose lager, and I think they succeeded. I could down a few of these, but the price is a little high from what I've seen."
"Starts nice with a good appearance - pale golden, honeyed look, with medium sized white head that laces well. Nose was alright too with some floral citrus, which was a bit surprising for a LAGER. Palate though had some soft malt sweetness, but then also this quasi-ureic quality that was off-putting, but also not clearly a flawed or ruined example (it wasn't lightstruck, infected, etc.). The floral citrus just sort of runs into a urea like flavor that isn't so nice. Finishes semi sweet. Seems ale-like in many ways."
""
"16oz can, poured into my 20oz New Holland glass, body is golden in color with excellent clarity. Tall white head holds good retention and eventually dissipates into a foam atop the ale, leaving good lacing on the glass. Aromas are overly sweet, with grain, grass, and grape-like scents. Tastes are sharp and clean, with fruity characteristics - maybe apple juice or white grape juice, grain, sweet, with some herbal/grassy/earthy hops to help balance it out. Mouth is thin-to-medium bodied and smooth, finishes just dry enough to warrant another quenching taste of the lager. Overall, good, crafty interpretation of a style I prefer not to drink too often. Good for the try, but probably won't buy it again."
"Drinkability was good, the can went down quick and easy and I could see maybe taking some of these to a cookout or tubing on the Nooksack. Overall, a nice little beer that'll probably find a place in your summer rotation."
""
"O - not overly plussed with the four pack (lagers need six, don't they?), but it is drinkable, and a step above the macros."
"Overall, better than macro lagers but not my thing. Vegetal notes, too much biscuit malt with earthy notes."
""
""
""
"Regretting not picking up more than a single now, but will get more soon."
"I'm giving it a mediocre rating because I doubt I'll buy it again."
""
""
"The aroma is typical nasty lager, but the taste is nicely bitter and has a cool hop character that is unfamiliar but delicious. Good summer brew. I wonder how it would taste with just a bit of dry hop at the end of the lagering period."
"Pours a bright golden color with a quick flourish of white head that settles down prety quickly. NIce, clean aroma of bready malt and piney hops. Crisp, clean taste that's malt-forward and accented with some distinct lager yeast. Finish is a little tart and pleasantly bitter. I'll probably drink more than a few of these this summer."
"This is what an easy-drinking summertime beer should taste like. Very good beer for its style, or any style for that matter."
""
"clear golden yellow with 1/8"" of white head, excellent acing. smells of honey, lemongrass, bread. tastes slightly bitter from hops with a bready backbone.. tastes more like an american pale ale than a lager, which is a GREAT thing in my book. a very refreshing beer, light bodied, thirst quenching with a dry finish. this is an excellent session beer. unfortunately for me i only received one can through a trade, but if i had this available, i think this would be a go to for session drinking. it's light tasting with a moderate abv, refreshing for a hot summer day (or when you wake up in the middle of the night, such as now, with a dry mouth). it's just overall a nice session beer."
""

"Overall: this one was a surprise to me. New Belgium does not always produce my favorite beers, but Shift is darn good. I'm glad I gave it a try."
"I feel bad bashing this, as I really want to like it, but...it's just so-so. Cool packaging/can design for sure, and nice to see cans of craft I can take tailgating for baseball season. In other news, it sure beats the cheesy marketing of other canned beer lately, such as the Miller ""Punch Top"" can!"
"Taste is light on the palate up front, but full of hopped-up citrus notes upon finish. Drinks much like a pale ale, and a solid one at that. I would buy this regularly if the price wasn't so prohibitive ($9 for 4 pint cans)."
"O: I think deserves a higher rating for sure and will keep this one in mind come pool season."
""
"D - Light and easy drinking. I applaud the attempt at the style though I think it's poorly executed, simple and imbalanced."
""
"O -- Not what I'd expect in picking up a beer labeled ""Pale Lager," but it doesn't turn me off either. If I didn't have some true Pale Lager waiting in the wings, I might have been disappointed, but the refreshing flavor and body of this new beer makes for a good first drink of the afternoon."
""
"This was a borderline IPL at times with those American hops really adding a lot of character to this. Maybe a bit too much though, as this got REALLY herbal feeling as things warmed up. I recommend having at this one while it’s still fairly cold, as it’s got quite a flavorful and crisp hop bite before things start loosening up. It’s nice to see New Belgium going with the tall boys now."
""
""
""
"Low C-"
""
""
"Pours a clear orange with a 2 inch foamy orange-white head that settles to a thin cap on top of the beer. Foamy patches of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of metal, grain, and some herbal hop aromas. Taste is of tangy malt and some herbal hop flavors. There is a mild bitterness on the palate after each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good lager but I was expecting a crisper level of carbonation."
""
""
"Tasty and drinkable for a long night or day."
""
""
""
"I'm sure a few of these will go down great out on the lake or chilling this summer; but this is a little too stripped down for me, give more hops & or malt please. I doubt this will even make my summer canned beer rotation this year..."

"Smell is clean biscuit, taste has some real character--some spice, some tart apple, dried grass, a crisp finish with a punch of hop. Very drinkable, clean lager which is actually quite enjoyable to drink *during* work."
"There isn't a ton going on with this brew but it would be great for sessioning. This could potentially be a good gateway beer from BMC."
"Heard good things about this, poured from can to pilsner glass the beer arrives a translucent orange copper yellow with a nice 2 finger white head, good retention, and good lacing. The nose is a little light but not bad, consisting of a light floral earthy hop and a touch of caramel. The flavor improves on the nose with a light but pleasant hop earthy flavor and mild bitterness, hints of caramel sweetness and light pilsen malt. Finishes crisp and clean. Light bodied and well carbonated. Overall, good. This will be enjoyed more and more as the temperature heats up!"
"All in all, it's not all that bad. Very sessionable. And for it's style, it's something I'd reach for on a hot day if it were lying around."
"Poured from a 16 oz. can. Has a rich golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of malts, lemons, some sweetness. Taste is crisp, tart, citrus, some hops, more pale ale like than lager. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is an easy drinking and enjoyable beer."
""
"O - This is a pretty tasty lager. I'm impressed. I could see people taking this good canned beer on camping trips, etc."
""
"O: The American Pale Lager style doesn't lend itself to complexity, and this beer won't win any prizes for that. However, it's an easy to drinkable likeable beer."
""
""
""
"Overall: This is essentially a Helles but with New World hops. Surprisingly, I enjoy this almost as much as Surly Hell. I also think that other than the Lips of Faith series, this is the best standard New Belgium beer along with Belgo. Very happly surprised by this."
""
""
"I think it's safe to say NB came out flat on this over-hyped brew. If they tried to brew a Bud Light clone using a slightly different recipe, well, they succeeded. There is zero complexity to this brew. This brew never quite shifted my gear to become recommendable. It's far from craft and closer to Macro, drinks great from a can and very poor from a glass. Give ME an Avery Joe's!"

"This is a really solid pale lager. It has a great hop character and great balance and flavor for the style. This would be a great trade off for the usual BMC drinker."

"My personal bias is that I’d rather see someone make a good “American helles” instead of all of these hop-forward lagers featuring unusual hopping. To me this is an ale brewer making a lager and as a result you get similar strengths and weaknesses. Hop heads might like this, but I wonder if it’s enough to satisfy them either. It’s an odd one, but who knows – maybe this could be a huge conversion beer?"
""
"Overall, beer does what it says, but it reminds me of eating white cake flour at times with a yeasty bent. But I am usually not a fan of New Belgium, but this is a pretty easy going and enjoyable brew."
"Poured into a pilsner a clear medium golden with a a thinner white head that didi leave a few broken rings of lace as it settled.Caramel sweetness,lightly toasted grain,and a decent shot of herbal hops in the back end.Caramel induced sweetness upfront on the palate with mild grainy notes,and again a shot of herbal/leafy hops in the finish.It's not a clean lager it's actually a little sweet but the hop profile is nice,above average but not great."
"Pours light amber, lots of white billowed foam. Earthy hops and reserved, amber malts. Nice nose for a session IMO. Some corn pops up front, some malts, and some hints of wood. Meh. Thin bodied and hi carb, as expected. Has a semi dry finish. I would say this is great for 80 degree weather honestly, not that bad, but not that great. Slightly sweet."
""
""
""
"Appearance is a slightly dark golden color awesome some grassy notes cereal some hops... Initial tasting slight bitterness not much sweetness can taste some hops and grain carbonation bubbles on the tongue very easily drinkable could put back the whole 4 pk of pints on a hot day off for sure. mouthfeel is light crispy pleasant."
""

"Clean, fresh tasting, very light lager - maybe not the best value, but worth a try if you want to mow the lawn in style."
"- This is a pretty simple review for a simple beer. But this beer is pretty damn good. Perfect for a hot day and as they have noted, perfect for after a shift of work. Very well balanced, and slightly better than other lagers due to their interesting and zesty combination of hops. This just proves that even the simplest of styles can still come out on top."
""

"O: Definitely a step above most American pale lagers. If this were in the same price range as BMC this would have gotten 5's across the board. Ah, well. You get what you pay for."
"Overall a good lager. It does have that New Belgium signature burnt sugar trace in it."
"Toasty mlats, earthy, a little musty hops. Finish is toasty and a little tinny, and earthy hops. So very easy to drink this beer. Going on my session list!"

"It's a damn good beer. I'd even say it's the best pale lager I've ever had, though that's probably because it tastes like anything but. If taking a pedestrian style and showing what it can achieve with the proper effort was their aim, then they succeeded, and I only have one suggestion: a high gravity variant called Overdrive."
"O: I was looking forward to trying this beer, but now I regret that I have 3 more in the fridge. I can't recommend this one."

"O- very drinkable smooth and creamy PA"
"I'm trying to figure out if I need to have this in my regular rotation once the weather gets more predictable. At $8 something a 4 pack for Shift, Schlitz 70s formula and Olympia 95% Malt are about as good though different and a lot cheaper."
"O: A tough style to rate. May not be the best beer ever, but within the pale lager category, this one is excellent. This is definitely a summer beer that has good flavor and is still light and refreshing. Has all the right qualities."
"D- very drinkable. A solid session brew."
"It's light in feel and carbonated. I'd have it again on certain moods, or if it's really hot outside."

"Excited for future outdoor events of all kinds, but mostly praying this appears at the ballpark at some point. For backpacking, I'll still go with Dale's Pale Ale for a smaller size, but can't wait to bring a four-pack of these to my next car-camping trip."

"all 3.5"
"Overall. I'm quite conflicted about this. If their goal was the ideal tailgating beer, they hit this out of the park! I can really see myself taking this camping, grilling, tailgating, ""bike rides"" anytime I need a solid beer that is going to taste good for several cans, and might be ok if it warms up a bit. On the other hand, the beer didn't really impress on the whole scale of things. I wish they could have shoved a bit more ABV into it or made it a bit more flavorful."

"Overall - While this isn't my favourite taste to find in a beer, for the style is very well done. Those who enjoy straw/hay/herbal flavours mixed with noble hops will surely enjoy."
"O: An exceptional beer that you must try. Well done New Belgium!"
""
"O - Hellooo tailgating beer! Well constructed and flavorful, Shift offers a simple but tasty marriage of malt and hops for a summer beer that will refresh wonderfully. Appealing to all masses, the triple hops brewed crowd will shift gears with this great gateway beer while craft drinkers will reach for it's clean lager characteristics and smooth flavor."
"Overall the beer is better than average but not great. A little heavier than expected but nothing that makes it exceptional."
"Served from can into a New Belgium globe. Poured golden yellow with a half finger purewhite head that subsided to a minimal amount quickly. Maintained phenomenal lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, wheat, fruit, metallic, and citrus hop. The flavor was of sweet malt, wheat, fruit, metallic, citrus hop, skunk, skunk hop, and earth. It had a light feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this was a decent brew. While the flavor on this one was quite complex as far as things going on, it just didn’t fire on all cylinders for my palate. However, there was a definite metallic characteristic going on in this one. Not sure if it was a part of the brew or from the can itself, but this wasn’t overly appealing. Worth trying if you are curious, but I wouldn’t go out of my way personally."

"OI: Excellent example of the style, one of the best I've had. If macros could make this, the world would be a better place."
"O- overall quite a nice beer. reminds me of most other New Belgium brews, i.e. better than average but nothing world class. quite a sessionable beer (16 oz.) although i don't understand tall cans. i would rather have two 12 oz cans. i like that the brew is 5%abv though. hops were nice but not present enough for my liking. probably won't be returning to this beer unless offered for free as i feel that it is somewhat easy to forget. i also don't like the serving type."

"Does this mean that 2013 will be year of the lager and New Belgium is just ahead of the curve on this one? The did get it right with opting for tall-boy size and at 5.0% it is still within the ""sessionable"" range. Very well balanced and great use of hops here which makes this one of the most interesting pale lagers on the market today."
