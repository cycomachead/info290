"O - A bit better than any big manufactured lager I've had, but overall, average."

"O: There's nothing overly special about this beer, but it seems a cut above most American Adjunct Lagers. It's easy to drink and seems like it would pair well to cool off some spicy vindaloo if you are eating Indian food."

"Ok brew. The malt and bitterness isn't cloying or horribly out of balance. Worked well with my meal."
"Pours a clear yellow with a foamy light beige head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace slowly drip into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is fairly faint but I am getting some malt, grain, and some grassy aromas. Taste is much the same with grain, fruit, and grassy flavors on the finish. There is a very mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is an average beer that is drinkable but nothing all that memorable in my opinion."

"Flying Horse Royal Lager Beer ---3/5."
""
""

"Somewhere between a German pilsner and an American light adjunct lager, this beer was light and easy drinking with German bittering hops, a nice strain of lager yeast, and corn being the predominant flavors. The color and nose were nothing special, inoffensive at best, boring at worst. Mouthfeel was what you would expect; heavy carbonation and thin without being watery. Not a bad beer by any means and much better than Taj Mahal brand lager, but not something would willingly drink again, as pedestrian light lagers aren't my thing."

"This pours what is worthy of calling a “piss yellow” color with a carbonated head that disappears quickly. Pour this in a glass and hand it to someone, they might think its tainted water. The aroma is cheap, full of cheap grains with that classic adjunct scent. Wow this light taste rivals that “beer” called Miller 64. Really light and taste less other than cheap corn syrup. You really can skip over this one!"
""

"I got a finger of fizzy, bone-white head with low retention from my pour. Nose was grainy and malty and I began to wonder if its classification as an AAL was correct. Color was a light-yellow with NE-quality clarity. Mouthfeel was medium and the taste was honey-like, the hallmark of real unadulterated lager. The CANQuest (TM) has caused me to come in contact with far too many AALs not to be able to tell the difference. Finish was semi-dry and quite refreshing. I was very glad that I decided to give this one a whirl. That, and the price was well worthwhile."

"Nice yellow golden in color, fuller than expected for a lager with a 1/4 inch of bubbly head that quickly fades. Smells of common cereal grains, mild lager yeasts, and a bit of fruity corn. Taste was better than expected for an average beer with good sweetness and a crisp bite. Not something I would seek out again but worth trying lagers of India."

"O: a little more character than I'm used to for the style, not something is go back to, but good its own right"

"I don't see any reason to pay the relative expensive price for yellow beer that doesn't even have a funny/stupid ad campaign. I mean, what exactly does this stuff cost more than Sierra Nevada for anyways? Might fool some chicks into thinking you drink exotic palatable beer, but I can't recommend that greasy lifestyle based on a lie."
""
"All that said, it is an Adjunct beer. The flavors are mild, but for a lawnmower beer, it is good. So, I would order it again in a pinch."
"O: Not a bad lager really. Refreshing and rather crisp, and went very well with my spicy Chicken Tikka Masala."

"Tried this out of curiosity, but I'd have to call it even worse than usual deck wash. Apparently countries can do without a national airline, but they still have to have a cheap lager (apologies to Frank Z.)"
"I wouldn't go out of my way to purchase it again, but I'm happy that something from India presented itself for me to try."
"Overall, Flying Horse is decent and drinkable. Nothing more. Nothing less."
"This is a olden colored beer, slightly hazy, with a very slight head. There is a serious cereal smell...vegetable, grass, and healthy dose of sulfur-like scents. Dry and grainy, this beer is not really complex. Still, the slight pale malt and bitterness is not distasteful. It's a typical macro-style lager. Light in body, moderately effervescent, and soft. Not a bad particularly beer, although also not very drinkable."
"It pours a straw yellow, but has a heavier body than it looks. Goes down very easy. I would have liked more head. But I will definitely get this again when I go to another Indian restaurant."
"Drinkability was good. Clean and light profile."
"Unremarkable, uninteresting, and rather forgettable."
"Good drinker but again, too spritzy!!!"
"Poured from a 22oz bomber, this beer presents with a decent 1-1/2"" head on top of a gold-ish color beer. There is a dank, light barley smell on the pour, which is followed by the typical lager taste. There is a malt undertone to the crisp flavor that is present in this brew. Sour undertones to the effervescent nature of this beer. It is very light and smooth on the tongue and in your mouth, and there is little to no aftertaste. It would be easy to consume multiple bottles of this beer, but I can think of many better ways to spend an afternoon..."
"D: Very much your run-of-the-mill Indian macro-lager, but refreshing nonetheless (not as torturous to drink as one might think), and also a good complement to flavorful Indian food."
"Grabbed a bottle of this at Cork and Fork in Gainesville. 650ml bottle poured into a Eggenberg pilsner glass. Paired with chipolte apple glazed steak over rice with green beans. Aroma is sweeter and more fragrant than expected from an adjunct lager. Carbonation is beautiful, thick two inches of pure white head and continual fine streams of bubbles throughout the beer. Flavor is a bit too sweet and has a strong corn backbone. Almost no hop bitterness in this beer. This is a beer I would buy again, and great to get a cautious BMC drinker into deeper waters."
"boring and not recommended."
"D - This is not a good beer theres no reason to buy this beer its that bad this is not an easy drinking beer don't waste your money on it"
"Ordered for $6.75 while at Himalayan Bistro in West Roxbury. Split with my wife and poured into pilsner glasses. Average looking beer, clear yellow color, lots of carbonation. Smells like a macro, lots of rice and corn qualities. Taste was not horrible, but nothing great. Matched well with spicy food, as it did not overpower. Slightly sticky on the palate at the end. Worth trying once, but price would probably steer me towards a different alternative with my next meal."
"Not even the suitable environment could save it."
"Not awful, not particularly memorable either, and I could have had a decent sixer for the price."
"Drinkability: This beer is good for what it is..an adjunct lager. It is drinkable and I could have a couple in a sitting. Not a bad beer for the style, nothing to go out of the way for either."
"Drinkable alone, but if that's the case you can do better. But if you're having a curry, then your meal will benefit from this beer."
"Took this from a 22 oz. bomber into a pilsener. Pours a nice crystal clear light straw yellow with a wispy head and minimal lacing. Smells like superficial and light malt, the some citrusy notes, noble hops. Taste is just average. Not too much more than a mass produced lager. Mouthfeel is thin, drinkability isn't bad."
"Flying Horse Royal Lager is a descent beer to enjoy while dining on Indian Cuisine. Stand alone, I would not buy it off the shelf. It pours a nice golden color out of a 22oz bottle, with a moderately sized foamy head. Smell is somewhat yeasty. Taste is pleasant, with a crisp."
"Pale Yellow, with huge carbonation bubbles coming up keeping a firm cap on top of the beer that didn't last long. Aroma is very interesting. It's not quite skunked, but has some very herbal, earthy, and grassy aromas. There's also a certain toastiness to the nose. Flavor matches up with the nose. Some sweet honey like malts, cooked veggieness, with a dose of herbal earthy hoppiness. Not tasting much in the way of adjuncts such as corn. This is light to medium bodied, utterly drying and crisp. Fairly drinkable, but these particular flavors aren't really my thing."
"D - Easy enough to drink, just not very interesting."
"D: As lagers go, this one is decent. That doesn't make it a good beer. Some components of it were alright, but on the whole it was an uninteresting beer."
"I'm not quite sure why this beer is rated so low -- my buddy and I split a bomber and found it an exceptional lager. Maybe another tasting will disappoint but this one was memorable."
"The taste is fairly sweet and malty with pear and grain as well as hints of apple and hay. This is offset with a light hoppy bitterness with faint light grass and apple peel. It has a faint, interesting, musty quality, as well. It's also clean and easy to drink."
"Split a bottle of this with a friend over a meal of spicy Indian food. Undistinguished pale yellow with a thin bubbly head and all kinds of carbonation. The latter is probably the best thing about this beer, as the fizz helps cut the spice in the food, just like seltzer water does. In fact, the body is akin to seltzer water, and the taste isn't far from that, either. I detected a bit of lemon and hay, plus some green vegetables in both the taste and the aroma. Not much else of interest in this one. I imagine this is best taken with food, as it doesn't have much flavor on its own and is suitable for rinsing before taking the next bite."
"Comments: too bad I didn't have any spicy, curry-ladened foods to go along with this beer, as the annoying bitter aftertaste wouldn't dissipate on it's own. This was a gift, and I am glad that I didn't pay money for this beer."
"D= An ok macro style lager that paired well with spicy Indian food."
"The flavor is rather clean with the emphasis on cereal grain flavors. I like the carbonation level that prickles the tongue. The finish is provides a mini hop snap. A middle of the road lager that is quite drinkable."
"This one pours a bright straw yellow with a tall slightly off-white head that retains suprisingly well and also leaves small amounts of lace.The nose is sweet with hints of corn and grains.The taste upfront is similar to the nose with malts controling the start,midway a nice shift to some slightly spicy hops blends with a earthy dryness that lasts longer than expected.The finish is semi burnt feeling(strange for such a light brew) and very dry.Unique,but not offensive or that interesting either."
"Pours a pale yellow with a light foamy head of 2-3 fingers easily that quickly dissipates. Nose is not skunky, but not complex. Taste isn't skunky, either, and light but good. Reminds me of the Steel Rail of Indian beers. I could kick back a few large bottles without a problem."
"stuff."
"Like many Asian lagers, this is best suited for drinking with food, in my opinion. While decent on it's own, it fails to impress me... Thus I will probably only have this again unless I'm at an Indian restaurant or something similar."
"Overall, I tried this along with authentic Indian food at a local restaurant, Cafe Tandoori, and was a good compliment to the spicy food. By itself though, the flavors seemed a bit off(maybe due to an old bottle), like stale bread and cardboard."
"Drank below average, not sure I'd have this one again. Probably only if it was a choice between BMC & this & then it's more about princible than taste. Left about 4ozs in the glass, I usually never waste beer"
"It wasn't my favorite style of beer but it went well with the spicy Indian food we were eating. Same thing as drinking Kirin at a Japanese restaurant, it's just about right for the food."
"The more I drink this it gives a sourish flavor..."
"D: This beer must go with food, which is how I enjoyed it - I scored it slightly above average for that reason. My dinner was masala-spiced prawns and aromatic rice; the beer provided a nice clean backdrop on which to enjoy those flavors. I suppose I could have said the same about any of a number of macro lagers, still it was a novelty trying one from India and having it paired with Indian cuisine...though probably my first AND last Flying Horse, it was good enough for me on this night."
"As far as United Breweries beer goes, Flying Horse loses to Taj Mahal by a nose and finishes quite a few lengths ahead of Kingfisher. Like most beer from this country, I would never buy a bottle to enjoy on its own, but would have no problem ordering it in an Indian restaurant to douse the heat from a plate of vindaloo curry."
"Drinkability  This was drinkable. Barely so, but drinkable."
"Meh. An overall average beer. Nothing special, but not terrible, either. I'd drink it again, but it wouldn't be my first choice. I will mention that it went very well with my lamb curry. I did notice that the carbonation level was a bit high, as noted by other reviewers, but I didn't have a problem with it. The hop flavor and aroma was definitely superior to NAILs, but that's about the highest praise I can give it."
"Mouthfeel is round with a little bite on the tongue. A very refreshing, lighter style of beer, that's worth a try...cheers."
"Poured a pretty normal head with poor retention. Decent lacing mixed with a noon day sun color. Smell is avery grassy with pilsner malts. Taste is a watery, yet natural malt character. Tastes like Indian sunshine. The palate is pretty light and refreshing, making this beer very easy to drink."
"The beer pours a pale gold color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is decent. It has a light pale malt scent along with a slight bitterness. It's clean with a dry lager yeast aroma. The taste is decent as well. It has a smooth pale malt flavor that seems a bit grainy and slightly earthy on the finish. It's crisp and refreshing, but lacking any real character. The mouthfeel is decent. It is a low bodied beer with good carbonation. This is a good lager. It has a flavor that I enjoy as well as good drinkability."
"Crisp, refreshing, well balanced, very drinkable. A very decent lager"
"Somehow I always revisit beers I know I still won't like. Pours golden-yellow with so much carbonation that it looks like bad champagne momentarily. Overly aired head that fades quickly. Nose is OK with hints of grain and grass, some hops. Nothing offensive, nothing attractive, average. Taste is not good at all, really poor IMO. It has some wheat undertones that give way to spice which is not what I'd expect. The hoppiness that I did experience felt like it was coming from a jar, really strange kick to it. The carbonation really hurt any attempt at having it with the food being served as it amplified all the tastes and aromas while simultaneously contaminating them."
"I went to pick up my Indian carry-out order a few minutes early so I could belly up to the bar and drain one. I initially picked Taj Mahal, but at the last minute changed my mind to this one. I don't think I've had it before, and in comparison I was getting an extra 0.3% ABV (bang for my buck!). It's to the point now where any new lager I try is expected to be fairly boring, but I'm always hoping for some unique characteristic to shine through. With Flying Horse, there is a noticable hint of sweet corn. The morning-urine yellow appearance reinforces this trait, which is normally a reminder that I'm drinking cheaply produced swill. It reminds me a lot of Red Stripe which I think also imparts this same sweet grain flavor, but Flying Horse is more extreme in this regard. Did I just use the word ""extreme"" in a lager review? Well, not extreme, but very noticable when put up against any other standard import lager from Europe or elsewhere. I rather enjoyed this beer, though in the ""Macro Lager"" catagory it doesn't take a whole lot to impress."
"Not much to speak of, bland, adjunct crap."
"I wouldn't buy this again, standard run of the mill lager, but my first from India. Why is it that everyone but Europe and America makes ultralight beers?"
"650 ml bottle- this was a drain pour for about 450 ml. Not recommended."
"Ok after finishing my bottle of Taj Mahal I decided to try something different, and picked this baby. Oh my was it bad. Taj Mahal is not a great beer, but paired with Indian food I find it tasty and satisfying. This was neither. Pale, tasteless and the faint smell of straw was all this beer could muster. They can't all be 5's...or 4's for that matter. Maybe the Kingfisher will be better, I'll try that next time."
"Pretty well-charged, a big fizzy head of an inch on a slow pour. Vanishes quickly though. Medium gold and clear appearance. Little lace, mostly dots on the glass. Straw aroma, quite a bit of green apple skin. Some honey to the malt, but very fruity flavor, tart and with more decided apple tones, approaching fermented cider mid mouth. Light body, medium carbonation. Hands off to a crisp hoppiness near the close but with tangy notes remaining. Has a little character, not a favorite of mine, but makes more of an impression than other United Breweries Lagers like Taj Mahal."
"I look forward to ordering more of these."
"Flying Horse pours an absolutely crystal-clear, deep-golden body that teems with swirling clouds of tiny, effervescent bubbles beneath a long-lasting head of frothy bright-white foam that holds quite well and leaves some nice lacing about the glass. The aroma offers a soft, grainy maltiness and a mildly herbal and grassy hoppiness that's very European. The body is medium with a fine-bubbled carbonation that's crisp on the tongue before allowing it to smoothly fade away. The flavor delivers a unusual maltiness that's a touch sweetish and grainy with an odd, nuttiness to it (as if some wheat was included in the grain bill). The grassy, herbal, and delicately spicy hop flavors are perfectly balanced against the malt and backed by a solid bitterness that could be a bit sharper but still gets the job done. (It's less bitter than most German pilseners, but there's definitely something going on). It finishes dry with a lingering maltiness that's bumped by a swirl of hops and then residual bitterness. It's an impressive lager considering that it's coming out of India (a country not known for it's beer!). And interestingly, this ""pils"" has a softness and lingering quality to it that works really well with Indian foods. It pairs exceptionally well with the creaminess, delicate spiciness, subtle raisin fruitiness, and cashew nuttiness of Navratan Korma. More of a ""food beer"" than a Friday night quaffer, but still pretty good regardless."
"An OK brew drinkable yet different"
"Perfectly clear and golden straw in color. Topped with frothy white head that quickly dies out and leaves little lace. Sweet grains dominate the rather nondescript nose--not unpleasant but lacking depth and daring. The same is true of the taste, which is dominated by the almost syrupy malts that far overshadow the hops, though there's a pleasant bit of crispness at the outset. The mouthfeel is reasonably well-balanced, and this beer is surely quite drinkable. But I'm bound to reach for something that promises more character."
"The taste is fairly subtle, but decent. Like most Indian beers I've had the taste is not all that broad. However, elements such as the slight woodiness and sweetness round out the taste enough to bring it up one notch above average. It has a lovely way of bringing out a kind of pepperiness in the Indian food, but aside from that pairing I doubt I'd seek out this beer."
"This came in a big 22oz bottle with a little note attached - very impressive and made me expect a good, quality beer. To the review: Pours a boring yellow/golden color with little head and leaves no lacing. The aroma is a bit skunky and yeasty with a bread-like appeal. The flavor is a little sweet, but still has a slight bit of skunkiness to it. Clean taste. Mostly malt in the flavor - very average for a lager. Not hard to drink, but not wonderful either. Nothing special here."
"Light gold color, small white foamy head. Aroma is grainy and sweet. A malt liquor/lager. Light malt taste, with a very definite alcohol tang. Good malt/hop balance. Mouthfeel is crisp. Finish is also crisp. Aftertaste is slightly bitter. Better than Kingfisher, I think.."
"When poured into my glass, this beer had a medium sized white creamy head with small bubbles. The body was clear with carbonation present. The hue was light gold and the lacing was only fair on the sides of glass. the nose was citrusy and fruity. The flavor was bitter with an aftertaste and the mouthfeel was tingly."
"650ml bottle. Pours straw golden in color with a moderate head the slowly receded, leaving a fine lacing on the glass. Aroma of malt is present along with an almost floral scent. Taste is that of most traditional lagers, clean and crisp. Good carbonation and throughly enjoyable."
"With a little note tied to the bottle and a brewed on date, I sort of anticipated something special, but alas a Flying Horse relieves itself the same as a field horse. Straw/Gold in color with a thin to medium corn malt body. A cornhusk and cardboard-like aroma leaves something to be desired...hops. The white head disappeared before I could fully examine it. The hops appear to be an afterthought. That said, this mildly sweet and dry beer is still quite drinkable"
"Pours a light yellow with thinly bubbled head. Malty, slight yeast presence, but not really very prevalent. Nicely balanced. Bready, yesty flavors come through with a clean finish. Not overly sweet, but still a touch of sweetness. Though it's not a beer I would activrly seek out, it went well with Indian food and had a nice palate cleansing effect. Not a bad lager, but nothing special either."
"Wasnt expecting much,but I was somewhat pleasantly suprised.Poured straw color with good head, smelled rather yeasty and breadlike.Tasted like a traditional lager was somewhat floral and to me very yeasty.To me it was the equivalent of Molson in a lotta ways so it was to bad got it for free so I am not complaining."
"The prototypical lager pour, a translucent gold color, the head impressive, the color bright white and the texture frothy. As it evanesces the lace left behind is a fine covering sheet upon the glass. Quintessential lager nose, all malt, somewhat sweet, with the start also mostly malt and lightly sweet, the top thin and unimpressive, the finish lightly hopped, mild on the carbonation, the aftertaste dry and lingering. Another Average"" lager, drinkable, but nothing that would make me buy it again."
"Notes: A decent pale lager that does a good job of cleansing the mouth for the next sip beer or bite of food."
"I really enjoy this beer on it's own or with spicy hot Indian food. Very nicely hopped."
