Head and shoulders better than a typical Pudsqueezer, Millers, etc. My taste for American pilsners has been somewhat warped by the Czech, Pislner Urquel which is a magnificent example of what a commercial pilsner can be. Still, this beer is completely pleasant, easily drinkable (even for a novice) fishin' beer. AND in Utah at the liquor store it is less expensive than average (almost a buck a bottle cheaper than Pilsner Urquel).","ibaconi","Jun 07, 2014"

It was an ale taste for a lager - not what I was expecting but good. Lighter an less bitter than a pale ale but with a strong lager taste. Overall, it was a good beer.

Color was a sunshine-yellow with NE-quality clarity and evidence of carbonation. Nose was slightly metallic with a biscuit malt base and a grassy hop smell. Mouthfeel was medium and the taste was about what I remember from nearly 27 years ago! It was a mildly hopped grassy flavor that I first noticed in the mouth and the finish had a bready/biscuit-like sweetness to it. I remember thinking that although it was not something wildly different like a Belgian ale, neither was it gag-inducing like so many mass-produced lagers of the time. I was not totally hip to the difference between lagers and ales, but I knew that one existed. This was a really pleasant semi-dry lager and a definite nod to the original. Obviously, they are not going to cop to their adherence to the original recipe, but this was a solid beer. Now, if they would just start CANning Henry's ...","woodychandler","Feb 09, 2013"

Pours a crystal clear platinum with a good head that dwindles to a thin ring. Aroma of yeast mustiness. The malts are strong and sweet, with bread crust flavors. A hop crispness balances the beer with a firm but restrained bitterness. Mouthfeel thin, but the hops get some good traction on the tongue and inner cheeks. The beer, as a whole, is clean and fresh-tasting, without any glaring off flavors.

The head vanishes after a few minutes but traces of foam will stick to your glass through out. The smell is of hops with a hint of grain.

Hey, this is a NW beer! Don't try to tell me you couldn't find any hops! This IS very drinkable, with its very mild demands upon the palate and relatively low abv. This is a sweetish (as opposed to Swedish) easygoing beer that would be good company drunk from the bottle while watching a game (Go 'Hawks, Dawgs, Eags, Mariners, 'Zags, Sups), and wouldn't screw up the flavor of Mac & Cheese from a box, but its really not worthy of anything else.
