"Prost!"
""
""
"Overall: Otter Creek is doing some great stuff. This is a good example. BA has this ranked #2 among American pale lagers (to Hoponius Union), and I concur."
""
"clear, light yellow in color, white head.  nice citrus hop flavors in the aroma.  hop dominated taste, very mild malt flavor.  thin to medium body."
"Served in a pint glass. Cloudy dark yellow in color with thick creamy head that lasts. Great, rich hoppy citrus taste and aroma. A really, really good beer."
""
"Very good ipa.  This would be a junior of the great vermont ipa's.  Not quite as juicy and fruity but close.  It does lack a little on the nose but tastes great.  If you love citra hops like I do search this one out."
"A pleasant surprise, as Otter Creek underwhelmed me otherwise. Just enough citrus notes, but an easy drinker. Best when fresh, it seems to lose it's character rapidly."
"Overall- One hoppy lager here! The use of citra hops was more than clear. Could have used a bit more malt additions though for balance. Different though. Very sessionable as well."
""
""
""
""
""
"A very good brew, can't say I've ever had an 'india style' pilsner before."
""
""
"O: nice citra showcase;"
""
"Pretty good, funky aftertaste. Not worth the price point"
""
""
""
""
""
"This didn't even taste like beer and had a weird aftertaste.  Maybe this was a bad keg."
""
""
""
"Draft at Roosevelt Tavern in York PA.  Poured a hazy pale gold with a solid white head; nice lacing on the glass.  Very citrusy - moderate carbonation - not at all over-the-top hoppy. Fresh, clean mouthfeel.  Would be a decent session choice."
""
""
"Poured a nice lager gold color with about two fingers worth of white head and left a good deal of lacing that is still lingering. Smells of several things. Getting some lemon, grapefruit, lots of hops. Taste is surprisingly good. Expected too much of a bitter hop taste but you get lots of flavor from the citrus and fruits. Feel is nice and smooth with a little carbonation but goes down like melted butter. Overall is much better than I was expecting."
"Decent beverage.  Has a slight off taste but very good otherwise."
""
"Awesome!  Loads and loads of flavor!  Lemon, grapefruit, orange, and pineapple all blended together.  Looks fantastic.  Makes a great springtime or summer beer.  Could drink this all day long!"
""
""
"Maybe I'm missing all the hoopla on this, certainly an attractive looking beer. The flavour profile is tasty and flavourful, easy to knock back a couple on a warm afternoon, but I would sooner move on to something with a bit more to it and going on. I notice some of the citra off-flavours on this creeping into the palate, the slightly 'cat-piss' note, and overall it comes across as fairly standard. A good lager offering and with a nice hop charge, but its not especially crisp and the hops seem muddled and catty."
""
""
""
"Slightly hazy straw color.  The nose has a clean hop essence to it.  The body is light. The flavor profile is crisp with a nice hoppy finish."
"Lots of pithy citrus in the nose, plus a little cat pee. Biscuits and short bread for malt balance. Not as hop forward on the tongue. Plenty of earthy citrus, not as fresh and zesty as the smell. Sugar cookies and short bread at the finish. Very pleasantly surprised, this was damn tasty and went down quickly."

""
""
"Very good ipa. First time I've had it and I thought it was very good.. Nice hop up front and malt finish"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I think the IBUs might be a tad higher then 55 like it says.....the hops are a bit bitter...but overall this is a really nice light refreshing spring summer brew.....well a lot lighter then the stouts I have been drinking lately!"
""
""
"Really a nice hoppy beer. Great with food or just to drink. Marries a great IPA with a solid lager, and makes them both better."
"I am very surprised with how good this is. I was really caught off guard. The hops really shine on this unique beer. It is a nice cross of an ipa and crisp lager. Well done."
""
""
"Two fingers worth of late to develop slightly off-white colored crisp froth with a slightly rocky top comprised of loads of big chunky bubbles...  Decent retention...  The color is a pale lemony yellow gold with a very faint haziness...  A light to moderate bit of sluggish carbonation...  The first descriptor that comes to mind is dank...  An odd mix of citrus and leather...  Cold cuts???  Thirteen hundred plus reviews and I can't say I've ever used that term...  I struggle to tell whether the aroma is enticing or slightly off putting, probably a bit more of the latter but it's not to the point of being a deal breaker...  The flavor profile is a slightly muted version of the nose...  Dank and hoppy with a few unusual notes mixed in...  The hoppiness intensifies on the finish...  The mouthfeel is medium bodied and quite sturdy...  Smooth carbonation...  Somewhat dense...  Goes down smoothly...  The finish is a bit chalky as the hops resurgence occurs on the finish...  A rather unique and somewhat satisfying offering...  Not sure that I would drink this with regularity, but the world needs more hoppy lagers and this one certainly fits the bill (even with the odd cold cut aroma)..."
""
"This is a strange one. The hop nose is a little subdued, and the flavor has a bit of a lager ""funk"" that I'm not all that used to. Probably won't be going back to this one."
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a great brew. Well executed. This would be awesome during the summer."
""
""
""
""
"solid 4 across the board, nice light golden pilsner color, white head.  India style comes through beautifully with hoppy citrus flavors and light malt taste.  Not a huge pilsner fan but this one blends IPA hop flavor with a classic pilsner drinkability."
"One of the best IPL's out there.  Great citrus aroma, tastes follows."
""
""
""
""
""
"A unique concoction that hits the mark in every way...by that I mean the brewery's description actually holds up here. Wonderful citrus  fruit complexities that shine through but don't overwhelm..."
""
""
"Very disappointing no malt balance."
""
""
""
""
""
"I like it.  Duvel glassed it from a 12oz bottle. Nothing bad to say. I like citrus, but this is a little bit  one note, overipened lemon/grapefruit , with a  bit of peel, grapefruit peel, sour,  which I'm cool with, maybe too summer. I'd get it again, but as a selection in a mixpack....or a sixer if the weather was a bit warmer. This would be my go to beer if it was released midsummer ....alas, it's 10 degrees and I'm onto more maltier  fare."

"Chimney Rock Inn on draft 2/14/15. Tastes skunky. Maybe it was a dirty draft line. Would like to try again."
""
""
""
"Pours a medium golden orange with a white foam that laces well.  The aroma is bright with citrus being the standout.  The taste has a grapefruit, unripe clementine orange flavor that is quite nice.  Fair bitterness but this one is more quenching than palate-scorching. Medium bodied, well carbonated brew.  Very nice product all in all.  Reinventing the style, and it's delicious."
""
""
"Dense head of about a finger’s height, pale white, smooth surface, mostly uniform foam, the lacing is thin, however, produces many streaks and they all stick with determination. Light filminess to the golden hued light, translucent and difficult to see through, only a few bubbles but they are fat. Very pure and fresh nose, abounds with a cornucopia of tart citrus, leafy herbal matter and toasted bread crust, some peppery notes as well, the white pit fruit and pineapple scents are plush and do what the can to soften the contours, overall has a high energy profile. Medium-bodied, somewhat creamy texture at first then it becomes successively drier although stops short of bitter. The bite in the pineapple, papaya, nectarine fruit trumps any juicier apricot or peach. The floral element more pronounced here, the citrus seems to settle on a mix of pink and white grapefruit. The graininess and herbaceousness stiffen the mouth feel after the attack and the mild maltiness appears mostly after the show has ended. To its credit, the whole is greater than the sum of the parts and it’s best to just enjoy it than parse it."

"Solid spring release from mike and da boys at otter creek"

"Good IPL, only complaint is a slight diacetyl finish.  Other than that, this is very competitive with Jack's Abby and Founders IPL versions out there."
""

"solid IPL, Jacks Abby still my fave though"

"The taste doesn't quite match the aroma, it's a bit short on the fruit side, but that is probably a style point in the relatively new IPL category. Easy drinking without the sense of ""something's missing"" that comes with session IPAs. Definitely worth trying."

"Overall - As advertised, a lager that has been hopped to hell. Good, not great."
""
"this beer is awesome, and otter creek has come a long way since the early days! love this stuff, i need it in 30 packs of cans for the summer, its perfect. a citra hopped up lager with a nice pilsener grain front end, light and fresh and a great takeoff point for one heck of a refreshing hop profile. clear and sunny colored blonde beer, excellent carbonation, short but fizzy and active white bubble head. the nose is a balance between the fresh light grain and the citra hops, which aren't overdone and oily, but simply clean and refreshing and rather delicate in their use. this is great beer because it bridges the gap between the pale lager drinker and the ipa drinker, where both are satisfied. its also perfect golf course or boat beer, just as summery as they come, no heaviness, no bitterness, just good clean beer full of flavor. that lemon tint to the citra is perfect, and the lager finish is quick but not too dry, perfectly refreshing. slammable beer of the highest order here."
""

"The only thing good about this beer is the look of it. I really don't understand how BA rates this so highly. The smell is of old hops and fruit, and the initial taste is a bitterness that even a bitter beer lover as myself cannot stand. As someone who really loves grapefruit, this made me taste a flavor of grapefruit that may have ruined grapefruits for me for good. What an absolutely horrible beer. The beer looks great in a glass. Very nice head, delicious-looking color, how very very deceptive. Once the bitterness hits the tongue and you think the worst part is over, the back of the mouth feel is even more disgusting. Swallowing this beer is one of the most horrible things i've ever had to do in my life. Unfortunately I bought a 6 pack of it at my local grocery store (Wegmanns) and have to finish the pack. I have 3 left to go, and was so compelled by the horrible taste I actually signed up for an account just to review how horrible this beer was."
"Poured a pale golden body with two finger head and lace with a dirty, earty, grainy citric hop and malt profile along with minor grape/sweet fruit notes. Beer is smooth and citric flavored hoppy and yet also grainy/dry with a crisp finish. I don't have too much to say to this beer other than the hops hit you pretty good and it has balance with the other main taste being a dry, grainy, crackerlike maltiness. Good beer that is easy to drink and refreshing."
""
"The head on this beer is outstanding. Rocky and like meringue in the glass. From beginning to end the citra hop shines here. bright citrus and grapefruit rind. the lager smoothness makes this one very sessionable. Love that its unfiltered to get the full experience. This one is fresh and delicious and I am going to try to get a keg of it for my kegerator. nuff said"

"Wow! What a great beer. I wish they made this consistently in the spring-summer months. It's a very simple concept; a lager with a substantial amount of citra hops. If you like citra, you'll love this. Doesn't pack the malt/booze package that a citra IPA would. I would label this as a solid hop head lawnmower beer. You could knock back a six of this over a warm summer evening. Otter Creek should really be marketing this as a summer beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall a tasty hop forward lager."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Super light honey pilsner look. Tons of Citra in the smell with some sweet malt and other tropical fruit flavors. Taste is a hop charged lager for sure. Certainly a new style for me. Still very good and crisp. A very nice refreshing summer beer."
""
""
"I dig it."
""
""
"Overall I could get this one again. I got the White IPA to try next as well!"
""
""
""
"O - Really happy I got to try this. Its one of the better hoppy lagers I've had."
""
""
""
"O: This is a really solid IPL. I'm sure it would have better fresh, but right now it's still drinking nicely. I actually wish I had more than a single bottle, so I guess this one was a success - doubly so considering it's not a complex beer (though it doesn't need to be)."
""
""
""
""
"o - overall another solid offering from otter creek. Might as well just make an IPA but hot dog if it isn't super tasty as a pils."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- This beer is deceivingly hop forward. It has the bite of an IPA but is restrained in its flavor, aroma and viscosity. Would love to session this during the summer but I feel like, after a few, I'd be reaching for something with more character."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"D/O- I could guzzle a few of these every night forever and be pretty pumped about it. For the style? Nearly a masterpiece. An extremely pleasant surprise. Thanks a ton Marc (mj0126)!"

"Outstanding beer. Living here in vermont I tend to get a little bit sick of IPAs. I do love my Heady, Lawsons, and Hillfarm...But I do miss Lawnmower Beers. This beer to me is the perfect blend of both. It is however noticeably different on tap and tends to lead to a bit of a headache the next morning"
""
""
""
""
""
"O- now this is my ideal pilsner! Just enough of my favorite hop added to a classic pils flavor, while still maintaining a superior drinkability. If thus were available in my market, I'd drink it all spring"
""
"O - Torn. I usually do not like lagers. This one is impressive for a style I don't care for so I'll give it a bit of a bump. If you don't like lagers this won't make you a convert."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - This is my fourth time around on this beer in a bottle before reviewing it. I do think the spice could be toned down a bit, and maybe the malt, the citra hops get a little hidden in taste, but its a very well rounded beer."
""
""
""
""
"O/D - Nice but it didn't exactly smack me with Citra. Properly light and hoppy and seemed stronger than it actually is. They could've done lot's more with this, but I'll take it as is."
""
""
"It's nice having options for hoppy lagers these days. This one has a great crispness without being too Ichiban noodle tasting (I often get that from ISA's). Huge citrusy aroma up front, knocks my hair out of my face. Dry, mild bitterness on the backend, but pretty subdued. Very clear golden appearance, slight head. A fairly drinkable beer, but not inspiring."
""
""
""
""
"O) A delicious brew. I will definitely have another one!"
"To me, a better option than most session IPAs, but still only a consideration if low ABV is sought.  It's too dry for a summer quencher, also."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - I remember when I first had this beer I was pretty blown away, and my admiration for it remains several weeks and a couple six packs later. Just a super clean lager that has been beautifully hopped with one of my favorite varietals. After this, Kind Ryed and Double Dose, Otter Creek has really been batting a thousand lately. By far my favorite IPL, and in fact better than a lot of IPAs out there, this gets a perfect 5 from me (my first and so far only) because I just don't see how anyone could possibly improve upon it, although admittedly the playing field seems to be rather small right now."
""
""
""
""
"O: This is the latter half of a sixer I scooped in VT, but I swear the first four didn’t taste this good. Really showcases the power of citra, pretty effective stuff that holds up nicely on its own. Haven’t had much experience with the American Pale Lager, but this is a nice first round. Recommended"
""
""
"Overall - Really impressive beer. Very strong hop profile mixed with the lager malts creates a really big, bold drink. Finishes pretty smooth and leaves a nice hop flavor. Best ipl ive had so far."
"D - fairly drinkable"
""
"The alcohol was just a notch too strong but that's only because I'm used to this style being relatively weak in that department. While not a true session beer, I could have easily had another in a sitting if I didn't have anything else on hand. I love beers that push the edge of what's available and what the norms are and this certainly fit that bill. Like the Sam Adams IPL, I hope this is a start of a new trend that still has a long way to go in terms of what else is possible when it comes to lagers of this sort. Nice job by Otter Creek with this new offering!"
""
""
""
"O: Very tasty, goes down quite easily, not too filling, mild kick, good representation of style, this is a nice hoppy lager to pound down for a long time."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours yellow with some of the dregs making their way into the glass, slowly adding a wispy fog to the top half. The head is huge and lumpy, leaving ample chunky lacy deposits on the glass. Fresh, fruity citrus greets the nose: tangerine, grapefruit, and lime along with some straw, green leafiness, and oily pine. A toasted cereal malt sweetness lingers in the background, but is noticeable. Big, fresh hoppiness continues into the flavor...grassy, bitter lemon zest, pine resin, tea, and grapefruit. Juicy citrus oils linger on the tongue as does a solid bitterness. Medium-light and moderately creamy in the finish. Other than a certain cleanliness to the aroma, I'm not sure I would recognize this as a lager. Very hoppy, crisp, and drinkable. Good stuff...I could drink many!"
""
""
""

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"The smell is classic citra; rich, deep musky hops and that's pretty much what you get in the taste too, though as it warms, you can catch more of the citrus notes. Aside from the hops, you're basically just tasting a nice, refreshing lager. It all works though and this is a very enjoyable beer and easily the best offering I've ever had from Otter Creek. Solid beer!"
""
""
""
""
"It's a well rounded Citra hop featured IPA - must try."
"O: Very drinkable, hoppy, dry tropical notes, great co2 backing as well a pale grain backing. Keg/case worthy, very enjoyable, great repeat factor. So far a sleeper that hasnt really drawn the attention perhaps it should. One last note is i thought this was an ipa, but is listed as a pale lager. This would be an A- ipa imho, perhaps a bit better per style as a pale lager, what ever you call it, its just an outstanding beer. The more time passed since i had, this the better the perception has become. Otter creek has made a stand out brew."
""
"After this I'm thinking the next big thing should be session IPLs, taking the session IPA thing to the next level of easy drinking hop forward beers."
""
"Overall this is an interesting take on the Pilsner/Pale Lager style. The Citrus and the Lemon do not overwhelm and is very drinkable. Well done by Otter Creek here."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A well made American pilsner/IPL. Similar to the vein of what Jack’s Abby is doing."
""
""
""
"O - Otter Creek has really stepped up their game. This is much better than any previous stuff I've had of theirs. Overall love this Citra bomb"
""
""
""

""
""

""
""
""
""
""
""
"Cheers!!"
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This was great, and it makes me want to check out more of their small amount of offerings. I need to get myself a Kind Ryed. I really hope it isn't a one off, but is actually a seasonal. Probably the hoppiest lager I've ever had and a good one at that."

"Citra Mantra, wow Mike Gerhart (? spelling) has tamed the hops. Badass label of him levitating with citra hop buds in each palm. Since his early days with DFH, this guy has been making solid beer but after the recent hoppy beers Otter Creek has released one of them being a collaboration with Lawson's. Unfiltered golden body slightly hazed bright white head perfect keller style pils appearance, but dip your nares into this one and a tropical hop explosion goes off in your senses. Think dank mary jane, tropical fruit notes (mango/passionfruit), and grapefruit peel with just raw hops a bit of biscuit toned pils malt for a touch of perceived sweetness. Dry purely raucous hop expression, bitterness leaves resinous oils on the palate, hops are just tattooed on the palate light brush of biscuit malts, but this is a true hop monster. Only 55 IBUs but I perceive more hop flavor and bitterness than many maltier DIPAs that report 100 IBUs. Carbonation is perfect dead on, one of the best IPLs I've come across thus far in the beer journeys. Sign me up for a case of hops!!! Citra Mantra!!!"
""
""
"When did Otter Creek start making better then decent beer? Poured into a pint glass, slightly hazy deep yellow color. Bottle clearly says it is unfiltered so the haze is expected. Pillowy white head, some light sheeting, good retention. Looks like a lager. The aroma is stand out. Great pop of citra hops, orange zest, lemon, grapefruit, that sorta thing. The hops really pop out of the glass. There is also a lovely and welcome lager-esque quality arriving in the form of a hint of sulfur on the nose, these aromas play well together surprisingly. Its funny I did not notice this lager quality in the first bottle I drank several days ago. Taste: the malt part of the taste is cracker like. Hops are nice, bitter at first creating a welcome bite and then a flavorful wave of well citrus fruits of course. I enjoy the fact that the beer is so hoppy without that cloying hop sticky resin thing. The beer is dry and thirst quenching with a lingering bitterness. Good carbonation. Overall this beer is going to be in my regular rotation. This is just the type of beer I love, better then the sum of its parts for sure. Full of flavor, dry and crisp, and with a moderate alcohol level allowing you to enjoy more than one."
""
"O - A really nice beer that totally satisfies my hop fix. I had a more typical pilsner yesterday from Jack's Abby that I rated slightly lower, but I think I would prefer to have it if I were having more than one. The hop flavor in this one is really quite potent. Again, as long as I'm only having one its fantastic."
"Iam really digging the ""IPL' style I have to say.Pours a clear dull light golden with a lemon tinge to it,a full two finger bone white clingy head atop,a great pour.The aromas are just dripping with citra goodness,the grapefruit and fresh cut grass is just jumping out at me,a bit of lemon oil is also thrown in to the hoppy mix.Citrusy oily hops upfront on the palate with a nice crisp note in the finish,the hops don't really punch you in the face they just linger nicely.Probably the best of the style I have had to date,a great hopped up lager beer."
""

"Hey, I'm rating an American Pale Lager. For that, this is outstanding. More brewers need to put their signature on a hoppy version of this style."
""
""
"The taste makes me think I am walking through a garden of fruit with all of the floral characteristics. Lingering bitterness at the end. Nicely done."
""
""
""
"Pours a slightly hazy medium straw color with a huge tightly bubbled bone white head that persists forever being constantly fed buy a stream of carb bubbles. Aromas of floral, pine, grass, citrus, and a hint of sulfur atop a light bready pilsner malt base. The flavor is very light crackery malt with a fair amount of spicy earthy citrusy hops. Hop bitterness is quite present as there is little in the way of malt body to counter it. Light body with a moderate to high level of carbonation and a slick resinous mouthfeel. Smells pretty damn good, tastes ok but really needs a hint more body for my tastes."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"o: A fine refresher which nonetheless feels substantial in your mouth. Fun to sip. Would make a good session brew despite being on the heavy mouthfeel side. Rounds out the VW Bus series with another hit. I'll be wanting more of this."
""
""
""
"Taste starts with thick white bread and a touch of sweetness. Moving to herbal hops and hay in the middle. With a bitter dank, grapefruit, finish. Feel is right on, what you would expect from a ""india style pils lager"" (whatever that is hahah), I would like more carbonation in here though, has some nice creaminess."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"More breweries should be putting out beers like this. Presently ranked #3 of its style for a reason."
""
""
""
""
"They hit the bull's eye here, so damn drinkable with a very well rounded Citra hop character that does not even get catty ... not that a touch of that would be a bad thing."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"My beer guru shared what he called a hippie beer. Decent looking beer with an excellent smell that had me thinking IPA. Excellent taste without any bad bitter has me savoring the beer. Not sure about cost but enjoyed very much and will look to revisit again as I felt this was an excellent beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"Citra flavor comes in waves without fatiguing the palate and satisfying my hop desires. I hope Otter Creek keeps this series going perhaps with different hops being emphasized."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Really nice hoppy lager. Just a ridiculous amount of hop aroma and flavor and great use of citra hops."
""
"Overall: Draft or bottle and this beer is solid either way."
""
""
""
""
"O- Overall a very tastey and well balanced. If you like Citra hops, you'll love this beer."
""
""
""
"O - Although this is a Pilsner, it is more dank and bitter than a Victory Prima Pils. A nice exploration into the IPA-like lager territory. Had this side-by-side with a Troegs Cultivator and preferred the Cultivator, which leaned more towards the malty side of the equation. I like these experimental brews from Otter Creek although this one isn't in the same league as the Double Dose collaboration with Lawson's Finest Liquids."
"Poured on tap into a ""pint"" glass. Pours very cloudy straw with a tiny white head. Smells of citrus and slight earthy hops, very inviting. Tastes of citrus and earthy hop tones, very much as strong as most IPAs. Beer is slightly heavily carbonated but light bodied and very drinkable. Overall a very good beer."
""
""
"This is another new (to me) otter creek beer.. And the best of the last 3 I've tried. This is overall a solid variety pack considering the price ($14 for 12 beers ranging from above average to solid - this being the latter)."
""
""
"Overall: I can certainly see where this beer wouldn't be for everyone. Hopped like an ipa but brewed like a lager without any darker malt to support the bitterness. Works for me though - a bitter, pale showcase of the Citra hop"
""
""
""
""
"O- otter creek has been killing it with the hop on the bus series. This is a great showcase of citra hops with a bit more complexity from the pils and lagering than your typical single hop brew."
"O: the drinkability of a lager with the hoppiness of an ipa. Beautiful."
""
"Overall this is a solid lager with a real heavy dose of hops. Doesnt loose its lager roots by maintaining the malt and yeast qualities but instead pushes the style further with a load of citra hops."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: this lager features characteristics I am more familiar with in an IPA, and it had a nice bright, brisk, and clean feel that I enjoyed. I'm sure this is a hit with anyone who enjoys Citra hops. Easily session-able - something you can get really comfortable with."
""
""
""
""
""
"Enjoyed on tap at Plan B in Simsbury CT.  Really happy with Otter Creek lately!  Kind Ryed, now this.  Clear light straw color with a decent head on the pour.  Head dissipated pretty quickly but left nice lacing.  Mild hop on nose, touch of lager dankness, which made me a little scared, but did not come across in taste. Taste was crisp and citra hop left nice bitterness on palate with a dry finish. Overall a delicious hoppy lager."
"This beer hits every idiosyncratic me-virtue that can exist in a beer, so much so that I really don't know if I can unbiasedly suggest the beer to people. I have to assume they'll realize it's great, but maybe I'm just too far in dry, cerealy, Citra heaven. I hope this beer is released again."

"light, pale, yellowish/straw color with a foamy white head that recedes to a coating of mostly tiny white bubbles. smell is dominated by the citra - grapefruit, a little grassy, a little lemon. The taste follows the nose well and the malt sweetness is there but not central, a little unpleasant mineral flavor at the end, with a distinctively sort of biting lager yeast and cleanliness at the end. goes down easy, though the body is a little too light for me. not my favorite but still quite good."
"This started out magnificently & ended very good. The hops ring true in this beer; if Otter Creek could stuff the nose into the taste, this would be one of the best out there."

"O: Good stuff; a nice transition-into-Spring-type beer (though I'm drinking it after shoveling a foot of snow), with lively, citrusy flavors awakening the senses, while the lighter body (and strength - this is ""just"" 5.75%) keeps it drinkable."

"Overall – A nicely hopped and rather tasty brew overall. At only 5.75 % abv it packs a good deal of hop flavor into its modest body. Quite tasty and crisp."
"O- overall a great IPL that would great in the summer."

"Hoppy lager that actually tastes like a lager. Citra is good choice of hops for a beer like this due to its parentage (Hallertauer Mittlefuh, US Tettanger) as it provides melon, tropical fruit, citrus as well as herbal character. Aroma is a little sulfury, fruity, and herbal (cat tails). Sweet haylike and melon flavor upfront, biscuity middle, and a lingering dry/bitter finish. Seems a littel disjointed at first, but the more you drink the better the balance becomes and a single theme develops. Great example of what can become the modern american pils style."

"O - Citra hopped lager, huh? I'll try it. Certainly worth it! Different, as I'm used to the thickness of ale's when dealing with American hopped beers, but this is a great beer, and I'd recommend it to any beer fan. Lager fans will appreciate it's crispness and drinkability, and Ale fans will appreciate it's depth of flavor."

"This is a light bodied brew with a modest amount of carbonation. It is crisp and feels good but the bitterness lasts on the tongue without that much flavor. Quite unbalanced and really not that drinkable compared to other ""IPL offerings."" Interesting and worth a try but not sonething id seek out or buy any quantity of."

"At 55 IBUs, this is a very bitter beer. The bitterness is not complex, and it does dominate any pale malt that may be there. A borderline extreme beer. Decent body and a lower carbonation makes it feel thicker than a typical lager. Hop heads will love this."

"A very amped up lager, but one that while drinkable and for the hop fan still comes up a little too bitter and unbalanced."

"Otter Creek is stepping it up. I first had a bottle of this and didn't love it, but the kegged version is much better- felt a bit cleaner."
""

"O: Not a bad tasting beer, but not as advertised. Was expecting something a bit lighter in terms of mouthfeel and certainly more tropical aroma and flavor. The bitterness and mouthfeel is high enough to not make it very sessionable. I would not particularly seek this out again. Although I do like the name (maybe for another beer though)."

"Pale, hazy yellow. Cool white head that holds on. Very aromatic when you pop the cap. Herbaceous--almost minty, lemon peel, tropical fruit. Fine carbonation is appreciated at first sip, which contributes greatly to the drinkability as the flavors are not as inviting as the aroma. Cereal malt gives it a medium body. As I drink more of this I do get more flavors, while subtle, of grass, mango, pineapple, and lemon oil. Still, they get knocked out by hop bitterness, and I like it a lot! I would not recommend this for the uninitiated, but I'm really enjoying the juxtaposition of biting bitterness and smoothness. Otter Creek is yet another east coast brewery that is renewing interest, and the price tag doesn't hurt, either."
"O/D-Great beer. Otter Creek has amped up their game; better labels and far better beers. They're stealing a page from the IPL pioneers-Jack's Abby. Citra Mantra is great but I wouldn't be surprised if Jack's Abby could do it better! (Edit:2/14/14) I have had this beer several times now and I don't want to compare it to Jack's Abby; I don't even think Jack's Abby could do it better. This beer is underrated and violently scrumptious."

"Overall this is easy drinking with enough to please. I may be a bit tainted by the hopper lagers from Jack's Abby which this does not live up to. However, I can't say for sure what Otter Creek was going for here. If they were going for a more balanced approach, they succeeded. But if they were trying to showcase citra hops over a simple malt backbone, then they could have turned up the late addition hops more. I feel that when brewers choose to use Citra, they typically want to showcase it because geeks love it. It's rare that I find Citra in a balanced beer. But kudos to Otter Creek if that's what they were going for....balance is underrated and welcome...even to this hop head. This is a hoppy pils I'd rather drink over Prima pils."

"12oz. bottle served in a shaker pint. Pours a translucent straw yellow with a fluffy, 1.5 inch bright white head that settles into a creamy, quarter inch cap. Textured clusters of lacing are revealed during the tasting. Nose expresses light citrus notes, including zest, and a grassy quality. Taste is really quite nice - sweet citrus followed by rind, yeast and a pleasant, herbal bittering at the finish. Mouthfeel is light and bright with a lively carbonation and a slight astringency. I love what Otter Creek has been doing with these one-offs. This beer gives JA's Hoponius Union a run for its money!"

"Overall not bad, the nose was great as it just presented lots of citra with a faint toasty malt underneath, the flavor however, brought way too much straw toasty malt to the front, although I normally love these flavors, it's hard to like them when they stomp on the delicious citra hops. However, they eventually come through and bring a nice harmony. The more I sip the more the malts seem to fade into the hops and it's more citra, but then they keep coming back a bit on the back end with more straw and grainy flavors. This is a good beer, but it could have been a great beer."

"Decent brew.. could put down a few but nothing to seek out considering all the citra hop beers on the market these days."
"12oz bottle with a Botlled On Date of 010614. Pours a translucent golden color with almost no head. Some lacing. Aromas of citrus hops, bread, and grass. The taste is citrus hops upfront followed by some pine and floral notes. Bready malts with some orange peel towards the end. Pine and bitter orange peel finish. The bitterness increases with each sip. Light and crisp. I hate the label, but love the beer. Between this, Double Dose and Kind Ryed Otter Creek has really been putting out some really good hoppy offerings lately. Overall, drinkable and bitter, this is a good beer to have on hand often."
"O - A high quality brew from Otter Creek. Walks the tight rope of a session pale lager and one to sit back and enjoy. Very balanced with good grassy pine characteristics and citrusy fruit. Well done!"

"Brewmaster Mike is on a roll with yet another great beer! If you loved Kind Ryed, you will probably enjoy Citra Mantra. Tasty, highly drinkable and I'll be on the lookout for a 12 pack if a such thing comes around!"

"This is a really similar beer to Hop Ranch. I like it better. This is a very, very tasty beer, showcasing Citra hops front and center."

"Overall - It is good and I'm loving Otter Creek's efforts lately, but I have to say that this doesn't hold a candle to the kings of lagering, Jack's Abby. With this much Citra i feel they should have added more malt body to even it out and boost the abv a bit, it would have resulted in a more well-rounded brew. It takes finesse but I'm confident that they will tweak it over time to make it better. I'd still recommend this because it's different and different is good!"
""
"Pours a pale yellow/light copper color, not too much sediment with a nice foamy head. Smell is almost completely of citra hops with a very faint lager yeast in the distance, however what else would you expect? Taste is certainly strongly represented by the citra hop and not a whole lot else. Not very malty to speak of nor too bitter, and slightly missing the lager aspects. Good and light mouthfeel as the citra hops don't at all overwhelm the palate. In a way it reminded me of All Day IPA, yet distinct in its own right. I think the Lager components could be improved, however I wouldn't call this OCB'S strong suit by any stretch. As with OCB'S past few new brews, I enjoyed this brew from the self acclaimed Brewmasater MIke and I would certainly try it again if offered."
