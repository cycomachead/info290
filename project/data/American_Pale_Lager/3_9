This beer is what most american ""light"" lagers should be, light, but with a decent malt and hop character and a clean crisp finish. The labeling now mentions it is brewed in the style of a Munich helles. It's not exactly there but close enough to draw such a comparison.","EagleTalon","Nov 21, 2012"

Is it skunked? Still has a light beer flavor, but with a slightly bitter, oily body behind it. It's hard to get through even one glass, let alone have it in any quantity.

I'll have to try another one to see if maybe just this particular beer is a bit flat, and not the beer overall. If not, the score could be lowered considerably.

The palate is average for the style and there is a little bit of a corn taste in the finish but I have to say this is a good lager.

Lacing is sporadic and light as the thick bright white head quickly dwindles down to a collar. Aroma light two row bring out cereal grains with a touch of honey sweetness, more biscuit pale malts really are nice here with a touch of Hallertau herbal hop bouquet. Flavor is creamy smooth and crisp with those biscuit malts really coming out in liquid cereal nature with a smidge of finishing herbal hops to add in that signature hop burp. I'm sure they sell a ton of this around the brewery, but I see why it doesn't get much attention up this away. It's only incrementally better than your standard BMC, mouthfeel is still light syrup with tickling carbonation that really effects the back of the throat.

The appearance is completely unimpressive, an adjunct free lager of this nature, IMO, should have a richer color. The subsequent lacing was almost nonexistent. The nose is distinctly Abita (or Iowas Millstream as both breweries beers smell identical to me). The yeast strain these two brewers use is obviously German. This beer has soft notes of grain, malty like a typical but decent macro lager. Luckily the hints of lemon, flowers, and hay increase the likeability of the bouquet. Moderate potency. Decent. The palate is very well crafted; it is much tastier than the nose indicated. The appearance screams, macro lager, but my tongue detected a good amount of hops (for the style). Lemon, hay, and grass upfront. The bitterness is moderate but firm enough to balance the malt profile ideally. The malt adds some sweetness, its bready as well. Clean finish. Simple tasting but very pleasant; I liked it. Medium in body, low carbonation, the mouthfeel is pleasant. The beer is very drinkable and I am sure it would be a hit the with B/M/C crowd.
