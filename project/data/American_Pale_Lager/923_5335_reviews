"Used this to make mexican beer chili and micheladas (con Ojo Rojo!). Not a fan of the style, but would definitely choose this one over Dos Equis or a Corona if forced."

"This beer is extremely smooth.  That is an understatement to be honest.  I was not sure what to think about this brew as Ska are hit or miss.  This beer poured very average out of the can, with no distinct hints or aromas.  I thought it would be average, but it wasn't!  This beer has an extremely crisp and pure taste to it and a great mouthfeel as it goes down smoothly.  The taste is of malted hops and barley, and I would definitely give props to Ska for this one, even though I haven't been as kind to them in the past.  Cool name, cool can, awesome name, smooth taste... What more could you ask for?"

"Saaz and lager yeast atop a pale cereal grain malt base. Spicy, grassy and bready with a crisp refreshing feel."

"Pours a clear light golden-yellow with a foamy bone head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace slowly drip into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, and grass aromas. Taste is much the same with grain and grass flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that is tasty and easy to drink."

"D a real session beer - missing on quality taste - but if you can find em cheap, guzzle away! at least its better than bud!"

"This is a craft cervaza, I guess. Pair this ice-cold with some spicy taco truck food on a blisteringly hot day, and this beer is a winner; crisp, refreshing. Easy drinking. Don't look for too much in this one, just drink it and remember not all beer needs to be complex to be pretty damn good."

"D) Incredibly easy to drink and it remains tasty even after hitting room temperature."

"O- This beer is dry and fizzy without much flavor and the hops that are a bit dull and one-dimensional."

"Pours out to a 1 inch white foamy head that falls to a 1/8 inch permanent head with intermittent lacing. Color is pale straw-gold. Aroma is sweet grains and grassy, herbal hops. Flavor picks up with the aroma on sweet grains, slightly biscuity note and mildly hoppy/bitter finish. It has good balance and a clean, crisp taste, Mouthfeel suffers from something. I get this rough after-feel from some canned beers that is hard to describe. It's not astringency, just a dry, chalky feel on the tongue. Overall, this is a beer that is better than Corona and Tecate but not by much."
""

"Overall Drinkability: If it weren't for the mouthfeel, I would love this. Very refreshing beer."

"I find this to be a really lovely lager, and an exceptional summer beer. on tap for awhile at illegal petes near DU. it was served with a lime wedge, which I don't think it needs, but it helps bring out some of the fruity and floral notes in the aroma, which is light and summer with a touch of citrus. the color is clear and light, with a quarter inch of thick white fluff, well beyond what I am used to in a lager. the head doesn't last, but the creamy texture it represented does. this beer is expansive in the mouth, yet always light. I love that marriage of feelings here. the flavor is mild, good crisp finish and flavor from the lager yeast, and only enough hops to clean up the soft malt sweetness. this is infinitely sessionable at a super low abv and a lot of interesting flavors for the style. its no bruery humulus, the standard by which I will measure every other lager I ever drink, but its a good summer session beer, and its damn good with a burrito. I think this is savagely underrated here on BA."

"A nice, light-bodied lager overall, but nothing to get excited about."

"This pours a clear, golden yellow color with a slight, white head. The scent is weak with some cheap grains. The taste is weak and not too flavorful. Some basic malts and hops in the mix. There is crispness to the beer with a slight spice. Nothing all that special other than the fact this tastes a 100 times better than cheap Mexican beer. Very drinkable, but also one of those you can skip over."
""
"O: Very refreshing and very thirst quenching - super easy to drink and sessionable (great beer for lawn mowing or other yard work). Not the most flavorful beer or my favorite style but I would happily enjoy a couple of these."
""
"This has potential. The Saaz hops are fantastic but the malt character is a bit unbalanced. If they're trying to make a hoppier version of a Mexican-style lager, they'll have to scale back the bread notes and lighten the malt. It's drinkable and sessionable, but I won't be buying it again."

"A light bodied beer that just seemed to lighten my pocket without giving me much needed tastes."
""
"Sorry folks, I didn’t have a pilsner to pour this one into so I used a pint glass. It pours out a nice crystal clear blonde color topped off with a light white head that quickly thins out into a layer of sporadic bubbles hugged by some minor lacing. It has a very light aroma, some wheat smells and mild spice comes through but not much else. Light on the tongue and light in mouthfeel too, this beer does have that skunked quality some Mexican lagers have, it’s not very powerful but the mild skunked taste is there(but is absent in the aroma). It’s slightly bitter on the side of your mouth and you can pick up some orange and lemon zest. Malts are present when its heads toward the back of your throat. Not a bad lager overall"
""
"D/O: This beer appears to be an all-malt pale lager that follows the archetype closely but does it well. Flavors and textures seem under tight control, if not particularly exciting. The smell has less appeal, not really matching the sensory profile of the flavor, while the beer appears to try to hide in the glass and not draw attention to itself."
""

"The Mexican logger is a sound good american pale ale. Its appearance is typical....average....smell includes the Saaz hop similar to others. The taste to me is much better balanced than the big marcos put out. The body is a nice medium to loght with good carbonation. overall a very tastee beer....probably one of the better american pales I've had."

"From the 12 oz can courtesy of Grapevine Liquors in Denver. This has the new, politically-correct artwork on the can. More Saaz, less snooze."

"Close to two fingers of very loose and dimpled bright white foam, sizzles down to the surface in no time, the lacing forms thicker stripes and sticks better than expected. Simple golden hued liquid, a few lazy bubbles drift here and there. Sweet and full nose of corn syrup, malt, cocoa, honey, peach fuzz and a brief shot of grassy hops, not that interesting yet plenty of richness in what’s there. Medium-bodied, some carbonation tickle while overall heavy and clings to the palate. More sweetness via honey, corn, molasses and malted milk balls, peach to apricot fruit and a splash of mixed citrus. Simple bread grains and oats, little about it seems hoppy. Mild metallic ring near the finish. Certainly not offensive, just leaves you with very little to say about it. So, that’s all there is to say."

"O: Good summer beer that goes down easy. Nothing fancy just a nice relaxing beer without all the hype."

"#BOTG 48 is Ska Mexican Logger! Its pretty freakin hot outside, and nice to get a craft alternative to Mexican shitty lager from Ska. Poured from can into Brooklyn tulip. Pours a super cloudy sunshine yellow color. Crazy, not what I expected for color. No head whatsoever. Smell- not much of anything. Maybe a little whiff of corn. Taste- very smooth, clean, crisp. Some sweetness on the end. A little bit of bitterness from the hops. This neither smells or tastes like anything. But, I could see POUNDING this at the pool this summer. Much better than AAL, but nothing special here. But, I will buy this instead of Corona, Dos Equis, etc anyday."
""
"Overall: Fantastic and so refreshing. And I love that it's canned. And low ABV. Perfect warm weather beer."
"O - Excellent example of the style. Very similar to other adjunct lagers, but with distinctly fresher, more aggressive notes. I guess the only thing that makes it 'mexican' is the marketing, but that's consistent with authentic Mexico beers I've had."
""
"Great summer party beer, for sure. Paired well with up-to-medium spicy Mexican dishes...and cake"

"O- sorry SKA but this one fails for me. not worth the price. if i want a mexican beer i will go for modelo over this anyday. better price same quality"

"Overall Drinkability - Possibly the best lager I've had."
"A big shout out to woodychandler for yet another canned beer. Poured from a 12 oz. can. Has a yellow color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of malts and grains, slightly sweet. Taste is the same, grains, malts, refreshing. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is an easy drinking and good session beer."
"O- you could drink these all day. a great summer beer to have at a party/bbq, out on the water, or just to cool off after some yard work. I also feel like this could be a good beer to show people who think Corona the fancy shit."
"There's an old saying... ""life is like a bag of tacos, sometimes you get the chorizo."" However, this chorizo is the premium stuff, may I have another!"
"overall: above average. really enjoyable. I will return again and again. dramatically better than Bud while not being complex or taking itself too seriously...quaffable. The scores I posted are an average of the river review, and the more serious review...though I think this beer is made to be gulped while participating in outdoor activities. In which case it is worth more than the sum of its parts."
"O: Better than the macros, and it's nice that it's in a can, but I'd prefer Mama's Little Yellow Pils."
"Overall Impression: As expected, this was a lighter beer. However, it was obvious that this wasn’t a watered down beer made with rice. It had a good, almost pilsner-like, bready maltiness, and the Saaz hops flavor in the finish added a nice bit of bitterness. The flavors proved the quality of the beer, but it was very drinkable, and went down very easily. Don’t let the name make you think you’re getting something watery, like a Corona. It’s a good drinkable beer for a hot day."
"O: Pretty boring, but would be a decent beer to share with people around the campfire, or to go with tacos. I have to say that I'm a little disappointed, and expected a little more from Ska with this one."
"(I know Pale Lager is not a popular style around these parts, but I am surprised how low the scores are for this)"
"This is a beer that I plan on enjoying for the rest of the summer. I find that it is a great example that a light colored lager can buck the trend and have a full flavors. If you are looking for something to quench in this crazy summer heat, look no further. Ska steps outside the box of typical brewing and makes a beautiful lager. Prost!"
"Would I buy more of it? - I'd love to get some more of these as we're heading into another week of heat and humidity. If you've passed this one up for any reason it's time to go back and grab a six-pack or two."
"The Crack revealed a beer ready to come out and greet the day! It had a nice two-day ride from Media back to Lancaster with a hiatus in the 30th Street Station baggage room, so it may have been shaken to some extent. The Glug got me two foamy fingers of bone-white head with good retention. Color was a fizzy sunshine-yellow with NE-quality clarity. Nose was kind of weak, as if the chainsaw was the only thing going Saaz. Instead, it was more on the malty side with some light grassiness underneath. Mouthfeel was medium with a slight malt sweetness and a mild grassiness. What I did not like was a metallic taste on the finish and I do not want to hear about it being in a CAN! I deCANted it into a glass and if you are not aware of modern CANs' lining, I am not going to explain it to you. It just was not a very tasty beer and not worthy of cooler space."
"Easy drinking for the summer months, but I can think of quite of few others that I would gravitate towards before this one."
"D-This one is alright, but I don't think I'd seek it out again. I;m just not digging the taste on this one."
"O- not meant to be anything more than a lawnmower beer, this is something that could probably appeal to the masses. id easily take one over the things they usually drink anyways. easy enough to put a dent in my sixer after an evening."
"Overall impression: summer time beer.. This is pretty light, but highly drinkable and has a bit more flavor than your average offering from one of the bigger brewers. Local bar servers these as a 20 oz imperial, and on a warm day it is highly appreciated."
"The taste is a little corny, but still has a strong malt base with some zesty grass and citric hops for balance. The palate is watery , and dilutes some of this lagers flavor. All in all, a good lawnmower beer in my opnion. In, fact, I reviewed this beer after mowing the lawn today."
"o: expected a little bit more from this beer.. a definite step up from all the macros out there.. still prefer Gusto Schlitz."
"Overall this beer is about as good as you can expect. I intentionally had it on a hot day after working in the yard since I think that is kind of the point of this beer. This is a step up from an adjunct and fits its purpose very well. The problem though is the price point.... 9 a 6er is just too much for this style and in the end kind of defeats the purpose."
"2.5 D: Not impressed. I'm drink this over a lot of AALs, but not because it's good. Rather, because it's slightly less bad."
"Taste shows some grainy malt, but it really lacks the cleanliness of a well-brewed lager. The yeast is biscuity and even has some light fruit. Hops provide a snappy bitterness on the finish, but I wouldnt mind a little hop flavor here. Not really all that impressed with this one, and waaay too expensive at $10 a sixer to compete in a mundane style category. Id rather buy Michelob at less than 7 bucks if I want a crisp all-malt pale lager."
"Overall -- I'll be honest, there are much better readily-available American Lagers out there, and having this pack next to Modus Hoperandi isn't helping it's case, either. In the end it struggles to be average. I expected more from Ska."
"Iam not sure what a Mexican style lager is,I guess this is it.Poured two cans into a stein,light golden with a thinner clingy white head.Clean aromas,only light toasted grain,and a hint of honey.Very light feel to the beer,wich is ok for a hot day,flavors are pretty clean but there is a decent toastiness to it,a subtle honey sweet ending.Hops provide a light smattering of herbalness as I drink more.Hey its not anything great but it fits a good role for summertime drinking."
"Overall: What can you say really? They were targeting a Mexican lager they nailed it. If I had the choice between this and some other Mexican lager, I would choose this, but it’s just not a style I particularly like, so I probably wouldn’t buy it again."
"This beer getting a B- isn't to bad considering the top beers in the style only gets a B+."
"Pleasant lager ideal for kicking back in the summer months, a bit too sweet for my liking but the flavors were full and finishes clean leaving you ready for another."
"Pours a clear, gold color. 1/4 inch head of an off-white color. Decent retention and decent lacing. Smells of sweet malt, pale malt, slight yeast, and slight grain. Fits the style of an American Pale Lager. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of sweet malt, slight pale malt, slight citrus hops, hint of roasted malt, and slight yeast. Overall, appearance, aroma, and feel were average at best, but the body and blend were refreshing and tasty."
"O - This is a nice pale lager. Very sessionable and nice for a summer barbeque."
"Cheers!"
"Crisp, snappy bite, some light noble hop bitterness that fades quickly into a clean pilsner crackeriness. Vague grassy spice from the Saaz. The taste doesn't linger long on the palate, just for a few moments and its gone. Dry crisp aftertaste. Body is light, no off flavors at all. A bit nondescript overall, tailored for warm weather session drinking. Went well with the BLT I had, and i'd imagine it would compliment most foods."
"D - Not bad for a lager; better than most macros"
"The mouthfeel is a lot heavier than a typical Mexican lager like Corona. Even though there is more body it finishes dry. It is still very easy to drink and I have been enjoying this six pack steadily over the last couple of days."
"Picked up a couple of cans of this one as part of a mixed six pack last week. Poured a light golden color with an inch or so of white foam on top. Very mild on the nose, a little hops and some light malt. On the palate this one is fairly light bodied, with some spicy hops and a little malt. A decent, but unremarkable, beer."
"O – With the great name, Ska is hitting what they have aimed for. A step above the macro brews of the style. 3"
"12oz can, I think the sixer was $8.49. Gold color, about what you would expect from this style. Smell is cheap lager, nothing special. The taste was good and while it distinctively reminded me of Corona it was much better with an earthy quality. Great beer for summertime."
"Overall, not nearly as bad as I feared. It's kind of a cross between a Mexican lager and a Pilsner. A pretty well balanced light beer. A bit too much corny malt for me though."
"It's not going to win any awards or wow any geeks, but this is a warm weather beer I can get behind."
"Golden with a fair amount of haze and a thin head with little retention. Muted aroma, mostly grains. Light carbonation, malty sweetness around the middle, more than I'd expect. Barely perceptible back end bitterness. Light body. Not bad, but boring."
"I had this on tap at Local Option...Pours a pissy clear light gold with some watery carbonation...Not much aroma a little hops mostly light skunk...The taste is the same, light watery, boring, tasteless, just plain old garbage from SKA...The feel is lighter than water."
"D: This beer is light and would make a great barbecue or beach drink."
"Out of the bomber this beer poured a clear, straw gold color with a fizzy white head. Some lacing but not much retention. The aromas were quite subtle, malty sweetness with some herbal hops undertones. The taste was dry and crisp, a lean hops character with pale malts. Very sessionable and quite understated in general but obviously done on purpose and done well too. The flavors are mild but enjoyable. The body is quite light and the moderate carbonation good but the mouthfeel a bit light."
"The beer dispenses from the 12-ounce brown bottle a sun bleached straw color with a modest bright white frothy head that evaporates leaving a thin but concealing sheet of lace. Nose is fresh and crisp with a fair malt sweetness pretty much standard for a lager, start is mildly sweet, grain presence adequate, top is light in its feel to the palate. Finish has the customary lager acidity with the hops understated, dry and thirst quenching on this 110 degree day in Arizona, cant complain about that."
"The taste is light up front, initially dry, but quickly picks up a sweet grain note that carries through to the finish. The finish has that sort of adjunct grain thinness to it that makes me think they must have added something other than malt to this. Very light and refreshing, the hops add a nice spiciness to this beer that almost offsets the adjunct notes. I get hints of lemon zest, and an herbal sort of grassy note. They really hit the parameters for this style; darn clean, to non-existent yeast profile and it even gets the macro brew taste down. Having said that, there are a million other beers that I would rather be drinking, but that is because I am not a fan of the style."
