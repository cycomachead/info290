"My staple while living here in Taiwan, a good macro brew, slightly sweet but v drinkable"
""
""
"Crisp and refreshing, nothing wrong with this."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall- Kirin Ichiban is not ""number one"" in my book when it comes to Japanese macros.  I find Asahi and Orion to be far superior in flavor both in Japan and imported into the states."

""
"No disrespect it's just not for me."
""
""
"For some reason I really like the taste of this beer"
""
""
""
""
"It's not a good beer"
""
""
"Very watery beer.  Also, not Japanese."
""
"Very bad japanese beer. I do not recommend"
""
""
""
""
"Very watery lager but also very clean."
""
""
"Not terrible by any means, would prefer this over American macros."
"malt is there & not much else"
"Light flavored American style lager.  All the malt and taste is up front and has a smooth clean finish.  It tastes better than it's slightly skunky smell."
"Good Japan beer brewed here."
"Sooo to date this is the worst beer I have ever drank. If it's your thing I say to each their  own."
""
"based on my memory of what budweiser tastes like, this is that"
""
""
"Yep, it is really that bad..."
""
"Surprisingly tasty, and that's that it is from a bottle."
""
""
""
"Thought it was a decent lighter beer"
"Smells good tastes better. Good beer"
""
""
"Pairs ok with spicy food"
""
""
"Beer flavored saki. Adjunct madness."
""
""
"Very nice for mass produced beer.  Tried the original Japan made version, there are other country specific origins but when having to taste review do the original?"
""
""
"More of a situational beer. If you're at a Japanese restaurant, it definitely adds to the ambiance."

"    Overall a 3 for Kirin Ichiban - Kirin Brewery Company, Limited. I may buy this brew again, but I highly doubt it."
""
""
""
""
""
"Review based on the BJCP2008 guidelines (style 1C). Bottle 33 cl - Batch unknown. AROMA: sweet and grainy (corn like) malt aroma. very faint hop aromas. APPEARANCE: gold color and very clear. thin white head with low persistance. TASTE: dry flavour with low malt sweetness. low bitterness. PALATE: thin body with low carbonation. OVERALL: yet another diluted pale lager that doesnt impress."

"Kirin Ichiban brewed by Kirin Brewery Company Limited with an ABV of 5.0% This brew pours out a nice amber color with a small white head.  This brew has the look of an American Lager. The smell is sweet with some grans and hops.  So far the is nothing bad about this brew.  The taste is bold with flavor but it has a smoothness to it.  They did a nice job with this one I really like this one. There is nothing over powering in this brew it has a nice balance to it.  The mouthfeel is nice clean and crisps. Overall I'm giving this brew a 4 out of 5.  I would buy this brew again.  This was better than what I was expecting."
""
""
""

"I thought this Lager was really good. Had a fruity taste and aroma. Very easy drinking beer. Went well with my HuHot."

"Final Grade: 3.43, a serviceable B-. Kirin Ichiban is certainly not an interesting beer, but there's nothing inherently wrong with it. I am rather surprised at its atrocious grades, but I am going to attribute those to a combination of the difficulty involved in finding a fresh sample of this beer, and BAs not really liking this sort of style in general. Probably my favourite Japanese lager to date... keeping in mind that all of the Japanese beer I've tried has been contract-brewed somewhere else."

"Bottle poured into a glass at a Japanese restaurant in Calgary. Label indicates ""100% Malt"" and also describes the contents as one of the world's most unique beer drinking experiences. Um, OK. I will concur that the color is unique for the style, an almost mango yellow-orange with a light spattering of white bubbles. Aroma nearly non-existent except for a generic graininess tempered by just a dollop of bread-like sweetness. Taste is similarly grainy and quite astringent, faintly sour with very subtle grape and custard notes. Some buttery yeast peeks in and out as well. Rather bitter and not in a particularly positive way, the hops are coarse and some floral notes do little to diminish this effect. Uber-carbonated of course. What tannins are present at least serve to provide some flavor. Ugh. It is perhaps unfair to single this particular brew out, but whenever I go to an Asian restaurant (and I love Asian food) I feel the need to try something ""local"" and frankly its just depressing that this sort of thing still dominates folks' beer schemas across damn near the entire world. I shall have to bust out something Hitachino this weekend to restore my faith."

"I got this because i found i don't like hops very much and this says 100% malt on the label. Well, i have to say i love this beer! And i'm surprised you can get this taste with no hops at all.(I'll keep this in mind when i start brewing my own!!). At 5% ABV this is a nice beer to drink and it has what i'm looking for...which is the opposite of a beer called hopalicious... I usually like darker beers but this has a blond pale ale look. The smell and taste is sweet malty... and i like it!! Overall i'm pleasantly surprised and look forward to my next bottle..."

"This beer has almost no flavor. It pours a pale yellow with a quickly fading head. If I had wanted yellow water I would have drank a bud light. Definitely not worth the price, and not as good as I remember."

"The taste expresses itself a bit better than the aroma with a notable barley and pale malt character kicking in. Sweet. Clean, crisp finish. Easy to drink. It is not as bad as all that."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A very mild beer, very light flavour and mouthfeel, almost watery. Nice crispness and pretty fresh. It went well with semi-spicy sushi, but I wouldn't drink it on it's own."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall: a decent and enjoyable lager, but not outstanding."

"Bright yellow in color with excellent clarity. Poured with a short, bright white foam that maintained fairly well. Light bready malt and earthy grain aromas with no hint of hops. On the lighter side of medium bodied with refreshing, fuzzy carbonation through the middle. Light biscuity malt flavors up front with a light, bitter tanginess through the middle. Finished with a stale bready aftertaste."
""
"I've had this beer several times over the years, but have finally gotten around to trying it again and it a rating. Not much to say about this brew as it doesn't entirely impress, but to be fair it's not altogether that bad. Appearance-wise, there's no head or lacing to mention and it's color if fairly common. The odor is not bad - it's has the normal scents of barley and yeast - but not overpowering. Mouthfeel was mostly carbonation - it felt a bit water as well to me and taste-wise it was okay - just like a rated it (and I gave it a plus-up in the overall category since it did taste pretty decent."

"O - Nothing special in this ""100% malt"" beer. Would like to see something special for the exotic beer price."
"O - Very close to be one of the usual pale lagers,which is not so good,but it have some touch of decent lager."

"A lightweight all-malt lager that just doesn't pull anything together. Drinkable but pretty nondescript and blasé."

"But anyway, the beer itself is nothing special, leaving my to trust the debriefing from my companion. A nice golden color to give no doubt to its claim of 100% Malt. That distinctly frat house smell, not repulsive but certain to bring about memories of hangovers past. A smooth passing past the tongue with a taste of relatively little other than a slight bittery finish. I doubt I will ever again buy this beer on merit alone, but should I ever find myself in the far East with a need to get wrecked beyond imagination, I will certainly know where to turn."

""
""
""

""

"There is some initial sweetness followed by a very pleasant bitter hoppiness. The aftertaste is also slightly bittery which is all very nice and enjoyable. A nice effort."

""
""
""
""
""

"No real reason to get this beer. There is no taste and no satisfaction. Will not pick up again probably."

"Drinkability that is hard to beat, that's what a mass driven brew could be to please all. Sure no thrills but with no off-flavors. Great session beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-This beer is not a good beer, but it pairs alright with sushi or other Japanese food, which is how I enjoyed it for this review. The flavors are semi-sweet and bland as you would expect for mass-brewed swill, but the metallic notes are turned down compared to many macro lagers, which is nice."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Not a beer to drink standalone, as it leaves much to be desired in all facets."

"O- Okay at best. Fruitiness is a little much for this style. Supposedly they don't sparge the mash in Japan, but who knows if AB follows suit in the US. I'd like to try it overseas."

""
""
""

""

"Grainy aroma. OK."
""
""
""
"Final Thoughts: I can't up but think of the wrestling Curry Man when I see this beer, because Curry Man is ICHIBAN! Although seriously, this was a disappointment. There's not a lot to this beer. Nothing outrageously bad mind you, but nothing wondrous. Pass"
""
""
""
"Aftertaste: If there is anything to write home about here, it's the aftertaste. If I did write home, it wouldn't be a long letter. There is a subtle dryness in the finish, but it's a dryness that leaves me wanting to drink something else. I am not sure how big the craft beer industry is in Japan, but they are missing out if this is a beer they are known for. Like I said, this pairs well with food… but that's about it. Unless you are eating, skip it. You can thank me later!"

"O- there isn't anything to recommend this because there isn't anything there. Other than it looks like a lager. Everything else that makes a lager a lager is lacking."
""
""
"Not going to bother with a full review here. Very mediocre beer with a faint sweetness that I didn't particularly care for. Beer arrived with no head, minimal carbonation, and no retention. Not much smell here at all. Sad that this was the beat option available."
""
""
""
""
"The feel is similarly bland, just a touch of crispness livening things up in this light-bodied brew. It's not as bad as a lot of what I've read."

"Pours a pale gold/yellow with minimal head and nice clarity. The nose comprises of faintly sweet malts, bread, corn, and a light hoppy grassy bitterness. Taste is again malty and a touch sweetness. Relatively clean flavor for the style, no off putting qualities that I typically find. Mouthfeel is light with high carbonation. Not a bad brew to pair with some sushi when it's all that available on the menu, but I'm certainly not going to seek this one out."

"If your in Japan you'll struggle not to try Kirin and Asahi, if not, I wouldn't bother."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A solid easy-drinking pilsner which works better on keg and is definitely a go-to when not much choice is on at macro establishments. I'd like to have it off the FV at Kirin when I expect the off-tastes will not be there."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Light straw appearance. Not much aroma. Tastes like a fruity floral carbonated lager. Tastes almost like a light beer--tastes like beer. Remember college? No depth at all. Finishes as it starts. Moderately carbonated. Pretty much no real redeeming qualities that we can write of."
""
""
""
""
""
"Not my first choice of the foreign imports, but not bad."

"There's not much here to separate this from the other examples of this style and had I not seen the bottle, I would have never have guessed that this came from Japan. The carbonation must have been deceptively high since I had quite a bit of gas as I drank this but it's still not as bad as the big mass-market beers. I wouldn't pair this with Japanese food like sushi but compared to its North American counterparts, this held its own."

"It pours a clear, yellowish color with only a slight white head. The scent is sweet with malts and grassy grains. The taste is average for a pale lager and actually better than I would have ever imagined being an AB-InBev/Japanese brew. This is a step up from the big breweries that make pale lagers with cheap ingredient fillers. I’m also getting some sweet hints of banana in the taste as well. A pretty decent brew by the Bud guys as painful as that is for me to say lol. But then again it said freshest within 180 days, I'm closer to 400 days so maybe that's a reason why it's better."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall-I was ruluctant to rate this brew because I knew I would not have good things to say about it. I have had this a lot (especially at Japanese retaurants). Objectively speaking, it is good when travelling through Asia. If I had to pick a beer from Northeast Asia it would be this one or Sapporo. Overall, this beer is not the best lager and there are many other good lagers out there."
""
"Meh."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall an Ok taste of Japan."

""
""
"O: This beer is easy to drink and a little more malty than I had expected considering the style and lightness of the beer. Not a bad flavor but nothing that really stands out - traditional offering at many Japanese restaurants so I will eventually have it again but not a beer I would seek out."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This beer is rather malty for a light-bodied beer but there’s nothing interesting about the taste."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - OK for quenching on a hot day. I would not seek out to buy this though."
""
""
""
"Pretty good - a fair imitation of a German pilsner. Pleasantly dry, with a hint of noble hop character to give it an edge. Goes down easily enough and would quench a thirst on a hot day. Worth trying."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: well it isn't terrible, very simple and therefore drinkable."
""
""
""
""
"O: Nothing especially noteworthy, but it was a good thirst quencher. I wouldn't go out of my way to find this, but I would drink it again."
""
""
""
""
"Either my tastes have changed or the tap version is much better. Maybe both."
""
""
""
"This is a hrash beer. The metallic, bitter, warm off flavors are immensely off putting. There really isn't anything good to report here. Even the drinkability is slowed by the off flavors despite its light, smooth mouthfeel. I'll avoid this in the future."
"12 ounce bottle, bottled on 18 Jan 2012, the bottle says freshest taste within 180 days so I think I'm still good there. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours a clear gold color with about an inch off-white head. Head retention and lacing is average. Aroma is sweet malt and corn, and not much else. Taste is the same as the aroma. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, it is light and goes down easy. For the style of beer it is, it's not too bad. Worth a try if you can pick up a single bottle somewhere."
""
""
"Served a pale straw color in a pint glass. The head was thin and very fizzy. I get crackery grains and crisp lager yeast on the nose. The taste is refreshing and light, and the flavors consist of pretty much just pale malts, bready dough, and lager yeast. I’m not really getting any hops. The body is ultra-light, the mouthfeel is medium-thin and watery, and the carbonation is very fizzy. This beer went well with the fish, and for what it is it’s decent, but I would never drink this regularly."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a pale straw color with a large white head that diminishes quickly and leave no lacing. Aroma of corn, and faint hops. Taste is somewhat sweet with a bit of bitterness at the finish. Taste is fairly clean. Although there is hop bitterness, it's hard to make out any real hop flavor. The mouthfeel is watery. Overall it is not an offensive beer and easy to drink. There is just not much there."
"somehow i think this is better than many other asian beers on offer at sushi places. i had 3 of these with an outstanding dinner at nobu in las vegas. pours a light golden color with a thin white head, lots of bubbles, but very very thin. smells light malty and crisp, which it is in the flavor too. a little bready, but balanced off by some generic hopping. feel is average too, extremely light body with medium to bright carbonation. quite drinkable and palate cleansing between fish courses. overall this is far from a great beer, but when lined up with many of its asian counterparts, it is one of the most tolerable in my opinion."
"This beer pours a hazy yellow color on my glass. It has a medium head (white) with medium retention. High carbonation. Taste is too bitter for me, high hops presence. It is not the beer I can drink too often. I prefer beers with less hop amount. It is nice, but I think I never will buy it"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"It is what it is, and it isn't much."
"O- This tastes very similar to what I remember Sapporo tasting like. It doesn't have much taste, it's kind of watery. If you can find it cheap it's not terrible, however I wouldn't pay a lot of money or go out of my way to get it. Definitely better then most of your average cheap mass-produced beers, but doesn't compare to most craft beers."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Light bodied, plenty of carbonation, putrid aftertaste which makes me wish I never tried this. Not sure if this is a bad bottle, or if it usually tastes like this. At any rate, not good."
""
"Mouthfeel: Crisp carbonated stands out above its flavor. Easy to drink as there's little going on."
""
"Had this with my dinner at a chinese restaurant. It was between this and the Bud family so I gave it a try. Pours a very light straw yellow with a big foamy head that disappears rather quickly. No lacing on the glass to speak of. Aroma of corn, and rice. No hoppy smell. Taste is much of the same with a tad bit of funky bitterness at the end. Better than bud, but that's not saying much."
""
"Not as good as I remember at Tachikawa AFB but I would drink again at a restaurant but would not buy for home."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"M. Lighter thin body with a pilsner-like level of carbonation. Dry finish. Nothing in particular has gone awry in the mouthfeel category, at least."
""
"Pours a translucent stray/pale yellow with a fluffy white head that fades into a thin patch in the center of the beer. Sweet malt, perhaps rice and or corn and butterscotch. Originally I thought to myself while smelling it; this is not too bad; this beer will probably taste ok. That was an incorrect assumption, the taste was far worse. Definitely a lot of butterscotch in the flavor and a hint of breadiness, but no other complexity to be seen. Light body with high carbonation and a dry finish with no lingering after taste. Overall I’ve had worse light lagers, but I certainly cannot say this is one of the best."
"O: Weird beer – I guess it cost a lot to make this beer because they have to use more malted barley due to the fact they don’t sparge the mash, hence the name Ichiban meaning “First Press” – or only one draining of the wort. I have to say using a more expensive process to make beer fails here. This beer was a little better than a Budweiser at best."

"I suspect my beer (brewed in the UK) tastes very different to the US version. So my review will not be a lot of good to most BA users, but hey ho, it might interest one or two who read it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I would drink this beer if given to me, but I wouldn’t seek it out as one of my must-haves. I would consume it at the hibachi restaurant as part of the ‘Japanese experience’, but that’s about it. It’s better than I thought it would be, but that’s not saying much. And with that, I’m off to the Super Bowl party. Go G-Men!"
""
"Overall a below average beer. There are much better beers out there in this category."
""
""
""
"Pours a clear straw yellow color with a two finger stark white head which gives way skim. There is thick sheets of lace left up and down the glass. The aroma is of bread and grassyness. The taste follows suit, it is all malt. The taste is of lager yeast and grass along with hints of bread. The mouthfeel is thin. Overall it was and easy drink and it is crisp and clean, but there is just not a lot going on with this on."
""
"DOA"
"M&D: due to the low serving temp., the fizziness doesn’t seem to bother that much, overall refreshing anyway. This beer’s promise lags way behind its performance, I’m afraid. Albeit adjunct free, the taste and body don’t seem to benefit directly from this fact, while the alc. content stands out where the flavour wanes, which is a critical failure in terms of production and balance, IMO."
""
"Poured a 2"" white head. The body is a clear straw yellow and exhausts most effervescence on the pour. The smells is mildly of malt and grass. The taste is a little sweet with malt and grain. There's a slight fizz in the mouth in the finish. In a blind taste test I'd bet I'd have thought it was a Bud relative. It may be a Japanese beer but my sample says it was ""Brewed under the strict supervision of Kirin's brewmaster by Anheuser-Busch, Inc, Los Angeles, CA"". Could that be why?"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - 3/5 - I would drink it at a Japanese restaurant if they had no nigori sake, but would never buy it as it just isn't very interesting."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is the only Japanese beer I've tried, unfortunately. I hear Japan has a burgeoning craft beer scene, so I look forward to trying more from there (and maybe trying Kirin again, fresh)."
""
""
"O - Slightly better than the average mass-produced lager. Interesting malt profile."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Ok brew. Not as much flavor as I was hoping for yet nothing offensive."
""
"Not a very low end BMC lager but is still just a tad bland as far as hops and malts go."
""
"O: Not that bad. Quite drinkable"
""
""

"Overall - I'm confused as to why the site says this is a pale lager but the bottle says 100% malt. I figured this was a malt liquor.. and it tastes exactly like one."

"Overall: Not a beer I will chose again. I don't think I would recommend it to BMC drinkers because it is no better and probably more expensive."
"I can't think of any scenario where I would recommend this. No wait, mortal enemies."
"D - drinkable, yes. Not a whole lot going on, and its not much better than other American macro-lagers. It is cheap though..."
"O: Refreshing simplistic brew. Not great but not terrible."
"O: One of the better basic Japanese beers. Easy to drink, and compliments Japanese food perfectly."
"D: Goes down like water, but nothing really sets it apart from adjuncts in my opinion."
"Not a nice beer at all."
"O- It's decent, not a terrible beer. If you're looking for something crisp and easy-drinking without much to it then this is a good choice, as long as you know what you're buying."
"Poured from a 12 oz can into my Dale's Pale Ale Shaker Glass. Looks like BEER. Generic yellow with lots of bubbles. A finger of head that dies quickly, but actually leaves a little lacing. Smells like BEER. Corn, veggies, barley, some light hops. Tastes a littly funky vegetabley, but otherwise some sort of generic offering of light biscuit, corn, sweetish malt with a really bad lingering vegetable bitterness on the finish. Very bubbly looking, but very thin on carbonation when it actually hits your tongue. I would never pay for this beer."
"Color is medium yellow, bland taste, no hops to speak of , watery. At least it doesn't spoil the taste of the unagi!"
"Exactly what I expect from a Japanese beer, no offense to their people, but beer is not their forte."
"I picked up a tall boy can of this while on a grocery store run. I wanted something cold and mild on a blisteringly hot day, just a little something to tide me over until company arrived for dinner. Dinner was served with several high gravity home brews so I wanted a beer that was refreshing and wouldn't color my palate before dinner (I just made up that pretentious nonsense) and this fit the bill. Completely average in every way, but sometimes average is OK. I would never buy a six-pack of this stuff, but an occasional tall boy is affordable and fun."
"This beer pours a light yellow w/ a small white one finger head. Almost completely clear in appearance. No carbonation and almost no lacing. Smell is that of corn, malt, and that's about it. Taste is about the same. Very one dimensional, and not that enjoyable. Mouthfeel is very thin, and not much there. Overall, this is an extremely one dimensional beer that can't be recommended."
"Inoffensive and bland."
"Overall I wouldn't get it again unless at Benihana. Not a good time for beer at all!"
"I tried this beer on May 19, 2011 at ""Smokeless Joe"" in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The beer poured a translucent pale yellow with a medium sized white head. The aroma was grass, weak hops, and sour stuff. The mouthfeel was medium bodied with medium carbonation. The flavour was sour grains, weak hops, and bitter."
"T: its just like a soda, crispy on tonge, refreshing, flavour is so flat, there is no after taste"
"Pours an extremely clear light yellow with a 2 inch off-white head that fades to a small cap. Random patterns of lace form on the glass on the drink down. Smells of sweet grain and maybe some subtle hop aromas. Taste is of sweet grain and a grape-like light fruit flavor. This beer has low carbonation and is slightly thick in the mouth. Overall, this is a pretty poor beer with a bad mouthfeel. I wouldn't get this one again."
"Cheers!"
"For a “big beer,” this one is surprisingly decent. Don’t tell anyone I said that."
"The beer poured a clear light yellow liquid, with a pretty big head, but it dissipated pretty quickly and faded into a spotty cap. The beer gave off a rather light corn aroma with maybe a hint of hops, maybe. The taste, on par perhaps with other beers of its stature, light, grainy and not at all that enjoyable. The beer had a light, fizzy feel to it, probably a result of too much carbonation. Overall, I would not buy this again as there are other beers in this class that are better."
"http://abarwithnoname.wordpress.com"
"O- I went for this beer for an afternoon ballgame drinking opportunity, and it's not a bad choice, not the best beer, but better than a normal BMC in my book."
"Overall I got this when I mixed and matched at my local place and man was I pissed on this one. A slight side step to typical BMC, but not much as its just as hard to keep down. Average beer at best."
"Overall Drinkability - Can't tell if it's infected. Bottle isn't old enough to taste this bad. Will have to re-rate another time."
"Overall – The beer is not offensive and it's fairly drinkable. The taste is well balanced and although I wouldn't buy it again - I also wouldn't turn one away if offered."
"Taste-wise I recognized this beer as MUCH heftier than Tsingtao, which I've found to be the lightest of all beers ever (the ONE that I tried at least). It was malty, full, hoppy, and flavorful. I really liked it! I thought it was full and flavorful, but in a ""white rice"" way that made it excellent with starchy Asian food, and the hops were present in such a way as to make me thirsty but not without need. This beer was wonderful with Japanese and Thai food."
"Got the tall can from the store, so my expectations weren't high to begin with. Was a thin yellow pour with minimal head, and the smell reminded me of a stinky Miller Lite (no offense, giant beer company). The taste was actually drinkable though, and very refreshing. I'd say it'd be good for a baseball game, maybe with some hot dogs or something. Not a beer drinker's beer though, unless you're a Japanese girl (no offense, Japanese girls). Was thin in the mouth, not much there at all. Overall it's drinkable, and like most beers of this ilk, a good drink to have a few of and not have to worry about having blurred vision or feeling full."
"Pours a thin golden yellow color with a fizzy white head that all but dissipates. Mulched grass aroma, and a slight sensation of hops detectable. Overall skunked, but crisp to the point where it doesn't leave an unbearable aftertaste. Grass and stale grains. Light, thin body and not much flavor. There are good light / pale beers out there, but this isn't one of them."
"overall this is a refreshing brew without a lot of positives but with no glaring negatives, something to have with sushi or to chug as a first beer on a hot day."
"O: Really not a good beer. Could stick with typical American macro-brew and get about the same beer."
"Brewed by AB now for US sales? Jeez...too bad."
"Very disappointing encounter with japanese beer. The widely available macro lagers are better even.... and cheaper."
"D-Not bad on drinkability, but this could be the blandest beer I've tasted so far."
"Overall, this isn't as bad as I expected it to be. Maybe it's because I tend to like Japanese lagers. Still not super impressed, and I'd still rather have a Sapporo."
"I have never really tried oriental or Japanese beers. The only other Japan beer is Sapporo. This was a dark beer that really wasn't all that fond of. It had a pretty good taste without a lot of bite or bitterness. It is average at best. As expected it was very dark but without the dark taste. I don't believe I will have this beer again unless I feeling frisky."
"O: As American pale lagers go, it is o.k."
"I change my ratings 'up' for the simple reason that very few 'light' or lager type brews can still hold their own or be impressive after a night of indulging in the heavier, darker side."
"This beer was one of the first Japanese brews I had. Although this doesn't really differ from any traditional lager that's made anywhere else in the world, this beer had a big rice backbone to it. The aftertaste is all rice. The beer is yellow in color and doesn't have much lacing or head. It looks pretty much just like a miller lite. This isn't much to brag about here."
"Pale lager is not a style that I (nor most people) have a tough time appreciating, that is if it's done right. There are a few brands of pale lager that comprise some of my favourite, most frequently drank beers, but they resemble nothing like the diluted, corrupted, bastardized examples that most Asian breweries put out. Kirin Ichiban, on the other hand, as much as it surprises me to admit, actually does. Don't assume too much about this one..."
"Pours a lite, golden yellow. Very clear. Whitish head soon rings up. Smell is faint and biscuity, and a bit of mineral and bitterness. Taste is decent at best. Not a whole lot of complexity at all, and even the basic profiles were just.. lite. Slightly bitter aftertaste. Even tho my bottle was fresh, the beer felt a bit flat. Overall, while by no means terrible, I wouldn't seek this out again."
"Overall: Wouldn't buy it if it was the last beer on earth. At that point, I'd actually consider switching to wine (consider is the key word... I'd more than likely just figure out how to brew my own). This stuff is the Japanese equivalent of Budweiser or Coors... though somehow worse because I expected better out of Japan..."
"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was the look. It appeared potentially refreshing or thirst quenching, and light enough to cool off with on a warm evening. The taste, however, was offensive from the beginning. There was an extreme bitterness to it, but not describable to any flavor in particular. It was bitterness in its purest, obtrusive form. Other than that, there was little recovery in any aspect to make up for its initial misgivings."
"D - I thought it went well with my meal at P.F. Chang's, but their meals are so salty that any beverage is refreshing. I had two, but again...long day."
"Dr: Never again - by choice. Is this what they forcefed to the Chinese during the WWII medical experiments? Given the choice, a vivisection might be preferable. It should be said that it's probably better than a lot of American macros, and it's relatively cheap."
"Pours a clear gold with a soda-fizz head that quickly dissipates. Aromas are subdued and simple - I only detect a faint graininess. Flavor is boring. There's nothing offensive about it, but neither is interesting in the least. Characterless malts linger longer on the finish than they're welcome. Pass."
"RJT"
"D - A beer for a days hard labor. Not outstanding but fills a need for the overworked salary men that fill this land"
"Summary: A good beer for beer-pong."
"A nice well balanced beer, went well with sushi."
"Very clear straw colored. Bright white head that was very fizzy with little retention or lacing. This looks like a ""macro"" for sure. Several bubbles streaming to the top. The aromas was corn and grain. Some malt character. Maybe a faint biscuit. Everything was very faint. The taste was of a cereal grain and corn. Some minute bitterness. Not a real pleasing taste. Tastes like a ""macro"" also. Getting a stale, metallic taste too. The mouthfeel was light and watery. It is refreshing and crisp yet I will only have when dining at an asian establishment."
"Drinkability: I could have more than one. This beer compares well with similar beers of the style."
"Kirin is an easy-to-drink light beer, and would probably be fine alongside a nice spicy Thai noodle dish, but as a drinking beer, this one fails."
"D: Not very flavorful, goes down easily and not too filling since there isn't much to it, mild kick, decent representation of style, it's better than I had expected but there are several other beers in the style that I would choose first."
"This is my second try on this beer and the first only got a score of 2.13. This score will probably be better but not by much."
"D-I switched after one, but its not offensive so many could be drank in a session, if you desired to do so."
"Drinkability - This might be fairly refreshing if it was 110 degrees in the shade. I probably wouldn't want this under any other circumstances however. I could finish it, which is always positive I guess. Does have a cool little label on the bottle though."
"Pretty boring, yellow with a white head, pretty good retention and lacing. An easy beer to drink, definitely refreshing, goes well with a meal. Besides that, pretty unimpressive. Taste a bit like an American macro, not much hop flavors though. Malty dryness is the only real flavor I can get from this beer, pretty simple."
"D: Decent drinker, good for a couple."
"tried this for first time lat night, not something i would get again."
"Drinkability: Served ice cold, it has the potential to be enjoyed maybe once a month. Not a bad beer, but one I will not actively seek out again."
"D - Not a great beer, but again, enough of a surprise for me to finish it. Decent drinkability. If you're short on cash, and don't feel like driving any farther than the local grocery store, it's worth a try. I might pick this up again sometime in the future."
"What a mistake. I was eating sushi and wanted an imported Japanese beer to drink with our meal, so in a rush and without first consulting BA, I ordered this because of the label and, alas, it was very disappointing and had very little value as a beverage. other than it was coid. So, this American made drink is an average beer at best and something I hope to avoid in the future."
"Went to a Japanese restaurant in San Francisco so I decided to try this. Pours a straw yellow colour with very thin white head. No real lacing. Smells of grain with some mild grassy hops. Flavour is fairly faint. Carbonation is much smoother than other similar lagers, which was nice. The beer wasn't particularly good, but inoffensive enough to go well with sushi."
"Overall, Kirin Ichiban is a wonderful example of mediocrity in brewing. It is not special, premium, nor is it a beer that anyone should keep in reserve (unless it is to refrain from drinking it). I will, in all likelihood, not be reaching for this one again."
"Bottle from a Japanese restaurant. I saw the beer in the book ""300 beers to try before you die"". Well, I could live without ever trying it. Pours a straw color with thin head. Aroma is light with notes of pine hops, lemon grass, and biscuit malt. Light body. Flavor is light pine hops, some citrus and sweet malt. Finish is long but barely noticeable. On a plus side I did not notice any adjuncts, but it still tastes like a pale lager to me."
"Drinkability: Chug with your sushi. Its not a beer for either relaxing or having a"
"D: An OK beer to pair with various Asian cuisine, but not something worth drinking by itself."
"I haven't had many of this style, so I cannot say if being this tame is typical but this beer does do well as a refresher if a person doesn't want to think about the beer or have any impediments to putting them down fast."
"Overall, this seems like a beer to chug if you had to much wasabi. Otherwise, a watery introduction to rice lager."
"It's like beer flavored water. Not a whole lot of carbonation either. Very typical for the style. If for some reason you're in the market for a Japanese beer, the best one I have had is Yebisu, and I have only seen it at my local sushi joint."
"Not impressed with the drinkability. Even for a sushi bar offering, it's not what I'd order next time."
"Mouthfeel is pretty bad. Very wattery, kind of sour and nothing clean about it. Not very pleasant. Similar on the drinkability. Can't completely say I regret trying it, but I don't think I'd get it again."
"D- Not bad for sessioning at a baseball game(get it?). only for the times that call for watery popped collar college beer-pong league kid brews will I get this again. abd those situations are becoming more and more rare for me."
"Another mediocre pale lager."
"Drinkability: It goes down without a problem, I'd just never buy one again."
"Atmosphere is okay I guess, at least in t part. The appearance is not bad. Pure golden hue, and a giant foamy head. It's kinda' downhill from there though. Nose is very non-distinct...just not much there. Flavor is really really off. A weird cloying sweetness, and it seems flat or something. Overall, this is a pretty weak quaff."
"D- Eh. I like this as it is, for what it is, but it's not something I'll probably buy again. Getting this again is pretty unlikely unless I pair it with some sushi, but my favorite sushi bar has Xingu so not likely. Average, but just not that great."
"Started out ok, and got much less drinkable as this warmed. Nothing horrific, but why even bother with this? One and done."
"Kirn poured a bright, urine like yellow, with no head, a good amount of carbonation though. There really wasnt any smell. Taste was weak, a bit stronger then other adjuct lagers, with a bit of a citrius taste that was a bit acidic. The taste was very weak, certinaly cant savor after a sip. Very easy to drink. Overall an OKAY beer, not too bad on a hot day."
"Had this one at a sushi restaurant in Rancho Bernardo on my recent vacation. Not surprisingly, every time I go out for sushi, I have a giant bottle of Japanese BMC. This time was no different. Along with plum wine, distilled sake and fiery sushi, I enjoyed 22 ounces of this beer. It was golden colored, cold and otherwise not nearly as memorable as those jalapeno rolls I indulged in."
"I would say if you're two or three beers deep in a couple hours and are half tipsy, the beer becomes drinkable. Other than that, stay away. It's good to drink this I guess to not drink all your good beer if you're really going for it at the cookout or whatever other occasion you happen to be drinking it."
"D: Its not like I can't drink it, but why. Has little to offer."
"D- It's a japanese take on American macros. I guess it's a fair representation of that. If you're going to call it an import lager though... maybe not up to snuff."
"Notes: This did not stand up to the other beers in our bracket (Kalik Gold, Red Stripe, Stella, LaBatt's, Brooklyn Lager, Fosters, and PBR). The best way to describe the flavor, as my dad put it so eloquently, is sour dishrag (which we also found in PBR and Fosters)."
"Drinkability: Easy drinkability, very good."
"Drinkability is pretty good with this one as it is fairly smooth and fairly refreshing. I wouldn't turn one down if offered."
"Whenever I'm at PH Changs this is my go to beer. Its light straw and way to fizzy. The aroma is lighte with a hint of skunk but not as bad as much macros. The taste is a little skunk as well with a bite at the end that on its own would make it undrinkable, but have some spicy chinese and this is fine to drink."
"D: For what this beer is and the meal I had it with, it worked quite well. I don't really think I'll be sitting down with a sixer of Kirin Ichiban all the time, but it's a nice light beer."
"Tastes, again, not at all bad. A good degree sweeter than your average American macro--maybe even a little more sweet than Grain Belt--but it's nearly hopless and there's only the tiniest bit of generic bitterness near the backend, which doesn't do a very good job of balancing things out."
"D: very drinkable beer that was really good paired with sushi and teppan grill chicken and shrimp."
"D: I could session this. Not a beer to drink for the sake of drinking great beer, but not the typical cheap offerings either."
"Drinkability: though it is a very low-flavor beer, it's pretty light and refreshing. For me, this is filling the bill right now."
"F: Finishes a little bleh with a lingering skunk flavor, little sticky sweetness light lager. Better than most beers of the style but not great."
"The beer pours a straw yellow color with a white head. The aroma is rice, corn and some grassy hops. The flavor is very sweet. I get a lot of grass along with some corn and bready malts. Thin mouthfeel and medium carbonation. Not as bad as expected but not something I care to try again."
"Notes: Looks like the label is the best that this beer has to offer!"
"O: Would be decent if it was cheap. Now that it isn't I would choose something else since the taste is nothing speical."
"Appearance is a light golden straw with a thick crisp head and surprised by the lace left behind. Smell of very light adjunct grains and hops. Taste has a light graininess leaving an undesirable bitter aftertaste. Mouthfeel is light with a good spike of carbonation. I'll just say that I've had much better Japanese beers."
"This was the first ""Japanese"" beer I've tried, though it's brewed in California and is very similar to American macro lagers. Pours a pale straw-colored, thin. Has an average-sized foamy head that dissipates quickly, not much lacing on the glass. Taste and smell is not very pleasant, has a bitter skunkiness to it at first, and the best comparison I can make would be a cheap Budweiser or Coors, maybe a bit of rice flavor in the background. Mouthfeel is average of a lager, a bit watery. Drinkability could be OK for someone who is a fan of this style,but I'd have to pass."
"The only good thing about this beer is the appearance. Pale and light with an okay head. Inhale the scent of this beer and you will unlock a light-struck mess, very Heinekenesque. the taste is astringent, quickly bitter, and unpleasant. When I drank this beer, I had bought to bring to friend's houde who only likes light, crappy beer, he loved it, I hated it. Probably one of the worst beers I have ever suffered through."
"Beer is medium to light in body, actually has more body to it than I expected. Interesting. I've had a lot of cheap lagers and I can say without hyperbole that this is the bottom of the barrel. Its acrid and harsh without an aftertaste but the dry finish reveals this horrible bitterness from what I can only assume is rice and corn. Its not a drain pour kind of accident but its about there. I doubt I will venture into the Kirin world again."
"D: poundable due to light mouthfeel and flavor."
"Overall: See drinkability."
"It is a tasty, lightly colored lager with a malt palate and a semi-dry hop finish. I really enjoyed, and will order another one some time."
"Drinkability: Quite good for a Japanese Rice Lager. Easy to drink with a nice dry finish, leaving you begging for more."
"3.5/3/3/3.5/4"
"Drinkability: Unremarkable, unmemorable lager, though, it does serve to provide a modicum of refreshment. Still, it's not particularly pleasant and one I don't see myself revisiting, even at the local sushi joint, as I tend to stick to the sake. It did look nice, but if that was enough, then I could skip the beer store and just cruise Google Image."
"Its not that this is a bad beer, but there certainly isn't anything memorable about it. Just so so."
"Drinkability: Not the worst beer on the market but definitely nothing worth having often. It goes down easy and isn't THAT offensive in taste. Pretty standard macro lager, in my opinion."
"Overall - Ick!!"
"Drinkability 3.0: One or two beers could definitely be consumed in one sitting, but it would probably not be my preference. However, I do respect it as a quality brewed beer."
"My first Japanese beer... nothing to special but worth a try to get my feet wet in Japanese beer... I might try a few more of these..."
"D - Reasonably drinkable with decent flavor for what it is. It'll pair well with most Asian food and that's generally when I have it. Definitely sessionable."
"D: I could drink a few of these. The flavor isn't anything special, but it's not disgusting either. If this were cheap I might have a few in my fridge on a regular basis. Unfortunately, there are other beers out there that are far superior for the price. If only this had been an import from Japan, it would at least lend it some cultural novelty. Instead, it's just another American macro."
"Notes: Taste a lot like a macro. A bit more sweet and grain taste than other Macros, but that's not necessarily a good or bad thing."
"So basically, imagine going out and eating the worst food ever. I mean like rotted eel in Cambodia, having a horrible intestinal infection, shitting all over yourself for a week, letting the excrement bake in the sun for a few days, then mixing it with water and bottling it. That's pretty much the taste that Kirin offers. I'll just leave it at that."
"Pretty drinkable. This'd be a great beer in university if it was really cheap. Not too much to it, and goes down easy."
"As usual, hardly something worthy of seeking out on its own, but given a place next to its country of origin's food (especially if it's of the spicy sort), these kinds of lagers seem to work - here, it was a decent enough serving for one when used for washing down some chili tuna maki rolls and beef tataki."
"I'd call the Kirin Ichiban at least as drinkable as Budweiser. It is not a good beer by any stretch of the definition, but it is not offensive either."
"D – It is on the better side for macro-beer, but certainly not anything to be excited about. Passable, not desirable."
"Bottle , Brewed By AB in the US . A clear light straw color pour with a thin fizzy short lasting white head , no lacing , medium carbonation . Aroma is slightly grainy ,a little corn and a hint of sweetness in the background , faint hops . Flavor is light and crisp , again a very light sweetness with some faint hop notes , nothing offensive , light body , thin watery mouthfeel typical of the style , light grainy finish , sessionable and drinkable , a good try but probably nothing I would buy again . . . meh"
"Yet another disappointing Japanese brew... Anyone know of anything better from there as I am unwilling to write off the whole country (and don't say Hitachino, not impressed there either)."
"Overall: Another so-so rice lager. I have yet to try an example of this style that is unique from a mediocre light macro lager. This example however isn't even brewed in Japan, so it does not even get credit for being a culturally interesting import."
"Drinkability: No. Just no. Never again."
"D: Maybe one could use this to cut through Japanese cuisine, but I think it'd actually wind up hurting the dish. Can't really recommend it on its own, but if you're like me, you're willing to try any brew at least once, right?"
"Drinkability: I enjoyed this beer, but it did not stand out as having any significant flavor or mouthfeel. It's a good lager for a warm day and moderately priced."
"D: Fairly generic lager. I don't really see the appeal of this one."
"Thin body with lots of carbonation and a clean, dry finish. Easily quaffable."
"Don't let the mass production scare you away, this is a pretty good beer! Kanpai!"
"D- All things aside, it was very drinkable. Nothing too offensive about it, just not that impressive."
"D - Fairly easy to drink, but not something I will probably buy again. Just not all that impressed."
"Very bland, truthfully I'm disappointed, it's not as I remember it, then again I used to drink crap. None the less I find this one of the better Japanese lager offerings."
"D - Not the worst beer ever, but far fromt eh best. This seems as I would epect for a Jap Rice based beer. Not bad, drinkable, but would not be my first choice if I had other options."
"Drinkability: I am not against the style, but I could not finish this one. This was my first drain pour in a long time. The taste has some bitter that is very off putting. Two sips are sadly enough."
"This is an easy brew to find in these here parts. By Japanese standards (quality and pricing), it's a reasonable investment if you're buying in bulk."
"Oh Good Lord this is bad. I can't even remember why I had it in my fridge. Someone must have left it there. So this might not be the freshest example, but I honestly can't believe that would make a differance. It doesn't look as bad is tastes. There's a positive. Smell is hard to explain. Like grainy vinegar, pickle brine soy sauce kind of thing. Soy sauce that expired in your fridge eighteen months ago. The taste is similar, dry, bitter in the worst way possible. Not a hop presance, just burning chemical bitter. Theres a very unpleasant metalic aftertaste. I get that soy sauce thing again. To quote Ralph Wiggum, ""It tastes like...burning."" I couldn't come close to putting all twelve ounces in me. There are no redeaming qualities to this beer."
"D: Goes down smooth and isn't too heavy so you could have quite a few."
"D - Yeah, its ok to order a Kirin at a Sushi bar"
"Pours a pale yellow with a small white head that dissipates quickly without any lacing. The aroma is a little bit of grainy sweetness and almost no hop presence. The taste is grainy and mildly sweet. Mouthfeel is light with quite a bit of carbonation. Drinkability is okay in that it goes down easy, but nothing to really bring me back to it."
"Not incredible, but I'd choose it over other Asian macro lagers (maybe not Yebisu) and any North American one."
"D - I like this in a Japanese restaurant but otherwise I dont really drink it."
"Nothing offensive but worth mentioning"
"Pours a light golden color with a pretty large head... not much lacing to be seen here. Faint skunky beer aroma to it. Taste is medium bodied, pretty surprised as I was definitely expecting this to be lighter than ever. But even though it has nice consistency to it, the mouthfeel and taste are non existent. You can swish it around your mouth for 30 seconds and all you taste is a slight tinge of hops, rest of it just a watery mass. Just import swill right here, wouldn't recommend."
"Poured from a brown 22 oz. bottle. Has a golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Virtually no smell here, some hints of rice. Taste is crisp and mild, finishing dry. Not a whole lot of flavor here. Feels light in the mouth and has pretty good drinkability. Overall a fairly average beer."
"Typical adjunct macro lager, but not a beer that you would want to dink for the flavor alone. Good to pair with spicy food but it can't stand alone."
"Pours effervescent into the glass, with a burst of white head that readily dissappears. Carbonation starts and ends with a flash as well. Looks typically golden yellow and clear, clear, clear. Smells of adjunct-based alcohol and little else. Flavor agrees with the color and the smell. Thinking hard enough, there is some very light malt flavor in the aftertaste, covered up with some non-hop bitterness. This beer is rather drinkable however, with asian food (of course) or anything spicy."
"Mouthfeel/drinkability: Light bodied and in taste overall I this is a great beer with oriental cuisine. By its self it is nothing special but pair it up with some sushi or Thai food and it is wonderful."
"D: Worked well with the Chinese food I'd ordered. It's light, simple, and not much else. My favorite of the big three Japanese beers."
"Developed a nice head which persisted for awhile and a golden color. Aroma was like an average pilsener. Mouthfeel was watery and taste was unsubstantial. Not a bad brew, but not remarkable in any way. Not worth the premium price."
"D: Not my cup of tea, a very anonymous beer with little aroma and taste."
"Pours a golden yellow with little to no head. Light smell of grains but nothing distinct. Tastes like it smells, nothing special, just some light grains. Goes down pretty easily, like water. It has a odd aftertaste that pretty much kills the beer. Overall, something to drink when there isn't any other option available. Just slightly better than a Coors Light or Bud."
"I liked this beer goes great with sushi has a bit of a rice flavor and goes great with a wedge of lemon crushed into it, finishes pretty clean and goes down smooth when it is ice cold and the outside temp is in the 90's. Maybe it is the heat outside but this beer really hit the spot."
"D: Not the most tasty but goes down okay when it's all there is on the menu at my sushi spot."
"So there's a time and a place for every beer, and this one belongs in a 30+ humid Japanese summer. The heat somehow takes your mind off what you are drinking and it actually becomes enjoyable. Strangely it seems to be being replaced in some joints by Kirin Braumeister, a slight, but imperceptible upgrade."
"The bitterness prevails, with an odd aftertaste, not very nice at all"
"This STYLE would be best paired with heavier sauced dishes and/or take-out Chinese food; especially cooked veggies or light game. But I seriously would advise against this beer, especially to pair it with anything."
"Poured a fairly deep yellow. Thin soapy bubbles on top that fade to nothing in minutes. I remember this being lighter in color. Smells faintly of grains and not much else. I know these Asian rice lagers are supposed to be very simple and dry, but this beer is too simple and dry. Theres no real funky flavors that you might run into in a cheap American lager, so thats nice. You really have to hunt for the dry, husky, grainy flavor it has. Not horrible but most the time this would be too damn expensive to pay for at import prices."
"I could really knock back a few of these on a hot day (or any day). This is defitely a sessionable beer."
"D: OK drinkability. Very light and simple tastes, good with sushi."
"Pale yellow appearance with not much head retention. Almost no aroma to speak of. Flavor is very malty, can be perceived as sweet, and actually very pleasant. Finishes with a light pleasant bitterness. It remains a very nice complement to spicy tuna rolls."
"The adjuncts are hard and heavy here, with a nasty aftertaste that sits on the top of the mouth. The mouthfeel is thin but fits the taste well. I don't like this brew, but it is refreshing. Conceivably it could pass for lawnmower fodder in sweltering temps. Whatever."
"I guess with alot of greasy chinese food? Not gonna buy this one again."
"D, notes: Watery and boring. I guess this bland taste would go well with sushi and other Japanese cuisine."
"NOTE: This beer has recently been re-released!! The NEW Ichiban Shibori is 100% malt!! I was so gung-ho when I first read the news! However, this review is for the ""old style"". I've only had it a few times since then. I'll add the new type Ichiban Shibori and review it for you later. It's a bit different!"
"Overall - This was served to me very cold in a 21 oz bottle. It seemed to hit the spot with the salty sushi."
"An average rice beer here. You probably should avoid it if rice isn't your thing."
"I'm not trying to be funny. I'm not trying to be mean. And I'm not familiar with Japanese beers, so I don't know if this is good Japanese beer or not. But I am saying that I will not be buying Kirin Ichiban in the future."
"D - This isn't a great tasting lager but it still quite drinkable for the style. That being said, I wouldn't run out and buy a case."
"Mouthfeel is thin, watery and fizzy."
"D- This isn't a great beer but it did well washing down my popcorn, but PBR could do that, and at a fraction of the cost."
"The taste offers a slight improvement--there's a minimal amount of hop present, particularly in the swallow. Also, for a ""rice"" brew, this has a surprising solid body. It also has a very high carbonation level, giving the mouthfeel a definitive spritziness. Thin malt flavor. Overall, a step above the traditional macros...barely."
"Not awful for what it is and in hot weather, it's not a bad choice."
"Out of a 22oz ""Special Reserve"" can this beer was a perfectly clear, straw-gold color. The head was one-finger and off white, the retention decent, the lacing mediocre. The aroma was a blend of dry grains and pale malt, just general macro lager. The flavors were crisp and refreshing. Slightly tart. A simple but well-balanced blend of pale malt, dry grains, slight hops and rice. The mouthfeel was good, the carbonation good, the body medium. Similar to Singh and a great choice for pairing with Asian food."
"Pours a clear, pale yellow. 1/2 inch head with slight lacing and slight retention. Smells of the cleanliness of a lager. Fits the style. Has a smooth and crisp mouth feel. There was an average carbonation level. Tastes mostly of a clean lager. A little more body and less adjunct flavor than Budweiser type products. Overall, not bad compared to adjunct lagers, but otherwise not that great."
"Drinkability: Overall pretty average, but the unnatural rubber taste totally makes this beer one to avoid."
"I like the drinkability of this one. Its not going to blow anyone away with a huge range of tastes and its not a high quality beer, but for what it is it gets the job done."
"Drinkability: Carbonation can be considered ""refreshing", but that really is all this thing has going for it, with a non-offensive taste that makes it drinkable, but not much else."
"D: Went well with sushi, but wouldn't have it as a stand alone. A bit too carbonated to have too many, as well."
"Ordered a bottle with sushi and soup at the Japanese place at DTW airport. This beer masters the style just like Bud Light and the American light lager. This isn't a delicious beer in the grand scheme of thing, but for a Japanese rice lager, it's quite nice. Unfortunately, right off the bat this beer has an odd rubber aroma, but that quickly fades to leave a very clean beer. The malt has a subtle toasted bread flavor and there's a hint of spicy hops. Very drinkable and worth a try next time you sit down for sushi."
" more kung pao please!!"
" Nothing great about this beer at all and there are enough faults to keep me from ever getting it again."
"D- this is like a miller lite in Japan. Very dull and if you like BMC beers you will love this!"
"(rated May 14, 2008)"
"I guess this would be my frist Japanese Rice Lager. Pours clear yellow, white head, nothing unexpected. Aroma is ricey and sweet, nothing different froma a Bud Light. Very dry beer. Instead of being heavily sweet, it is more starchy-rice-dry. This is a decent Japanese lager, perfect to have with Asian food. Light but sharp flavor, dry aftertaste. Nothing exciting."
"Drinkability : an average beer in the style Japanese rice lager."
"Reviewed 11/26/08."
"330 ml bottle. Very pale crsitaline colour, foamy head that doesn't hold much. Grainy and herbs smell with maybe some citric. Anodyne watery flavor, taste of herbs with some malty sweetness and bitter end. Just another beer more, I've drunk some worst ones."
"Overall, it was worth a try, if only because now I know.. Never again to spend my hard-earned cash on this ""water with slight amber food coloring added"" beer."
"Overall, nothing I would ever recommend or buy again. Very light beer, I'd rather spend money on an American marco."
"From an 18 ounce bottle at a sushi bar with the usual poor selection (why can't they at least carry SNPA?). Not much to look at - pale and watery looking, closely matching the taste. Mouthfeel was very thin. The beer was light and slightly nasty. Would have been better off with the budweiser - I guess I like corn better than rice for my macro beers. The Japanese make some nice sakes - why are there no decent Japanese beers?"
"D: It goes down pretty easy, but the taste is not enjoyable."
"Pours a very pale yellow straw colored body. Small white head, very quickly diminishing. Malty sweet aroma, with some graininess. Grainy malty taste, maybe rice or corn. Fizzy, and there's some alcoholic aftertaste present. Goes okay with spicy kung pao."
"Pale color with a head that disappears almost immediately, very very slight lacing. There was a yeasty smell, with mild grain undertone. Based on the smell I thought it would be ""chewy"" when I tasted it. That wasn't the case. The beer turned out to be very thin with a flat aftertaste. I've had better asian beer."
"Prost!"
"Pours a yellow color, nice carbonation, little one-finger white head had that does not last long, basically no sticky lacing. The nose is malty, ricy, grainy. The taste is malty, ricy/grainy, slightly sweet. Light body. Not drinkable, not too bad, but would not buy again."
"Drinkability is fairly low. Flavor is just not good. No thanks."
"Poured the beer from the bottle into a pint glass. The beer is a light orange with a foamy frothy white head that sticks around for a minute or two. The nose sweet and malty, maybe a little skunky and the taste follows with a refreshing dry finish. If there is anything that saves this beer is the bone dry finish which I find extremely refreshing. Not my favorite beer, but I don't think that it is horrible eithier. I think for the type of beer it is; it does it's job."
"Sampled from the bottle. Golden colored, poured a pretty decent head but halfway through the beer it was pretty much gone. You can smell all you want but there isn't much aroma at all. This is what it is. Very light-bodied, slightly sweet and grassy. It's refreshing and during a hot summer day I can think of worse, but there just isn't enough here to warrant anything higher."
"There is nothing special about it. The aftertaste is a little annoying and it seems like it could be so much more than what it is. I would drink it again but only under the same circumstances. I am not seeking this out otherwise."
"D- It won't kill you."
"D: not on my life. Cleaned my sink drain pretty good."
"Average drinker. I didn't really enjoy this beer at all. I don't think I will ever drink this again unless it's a last resort."
"Not too much I can say about this. I didn't expect much and didn't get much in return. I paired this up with some take-out sushi and it did little more than wet my whistle. Same thing I could have gotten from a glass of water. Still, its' pretty cheap for a 24 oz can, which probably bumps up the drinkibility a 1/2 notch."
"Good, very easy to drink and refreshing beer."
"Poured a light golden with a medium white head that dissipated quickly. Aroma was a slight skunkiness. Taste was definetly skunky and could not pull much more flavor from it, pretty bland. Very watery texture, not much mouthfeel. Overall I was not pleased with this beer. The aroma and taste was terrible, and woulc not recommend trying this beer."
"I don't know what to think of this - the strong rice aroma and flavor make me think I'm drinking sake even though this is (supposed to be) a beer. I'm not really impressed with it, but I wouldn't turn it down if someone offered me one (afterall - it IS still ""beer""). I typically like heavier/darker beers, but I've definately had better Japanese beers before (of both same/different styles). You wouldn't miss out on too much if you didn't try this out."
"It wasn't a particularly bad beer, but not something I'd drink regularly. There are better beers to be had for what I paid for this."
""
"D - Not a bad beer, but nothing I'd seek out. Washed down the ol' hibachi food welll but only a half notch above it's American counterparts, if that."
"D - This is an easy to drink beer thats typical of the style its light and refreshing with a good taste this is a pretty good summer beer"
"D: Drinkable but didn't stand out to me. If offered I would drink but don't think I'll be paying for again."
"Just to be sure, could I be drinking a Budweiser in a Japanese bottle??"
"D: This is not a bad beer by any means. I mean it is not the hot Japanese Anime chick that showed up to the party, but she isn't one that you would kick out of bed either. Solid brew that goes down easy and refreshes. Enjoyed."
"Pours a clear straw gold with a small white head that disappears quickly. The smell is nice with a sweet malt and floral scents. The taste is crisp and clean,but with little flavor. This is pretty much a ""Macro"" lager. The m/f is light with the weakish flavors mixing well. This is OK,but is very much ""Bud""like."
"Drinkability surprisingly is very good. You can drink a good few pints of these and catch a good buzz. Not a bad Japanese lager. This stuff really is a paradox of the senses."
"Mediocore at best..."
"This is what it is. I find in some oriental restaurants it is very difficult to find a ""good"" beer. Sometimes you need to play the hand you are dealt. This seems to be a better end of the common beers you may find in such a place. Of course your other option is Sapporo in most cases. Personally I think this is just a hair better on my taste buds. So why do I keep going back to these restaurants you may ask. I love sushi. Maybe it is safer to stick to the saki though."
"This pours a bright gold with a thin bubbly head that leaves a sad amount of lacing as it quickly drops to nothing,some bubbles cascade to the top,but not much to look at here besides the artwork on the bottle.This smells like inexpensive malt liquor(oe800,colt45,bull ice)a slight dry rice smell as well as some light grains.The taste is similar to the nose except it is not offensive like the taste that is expected from the homewreckers I named before.There are some nice simple malts in good balance with some bitter hops.A little to much carbonation,but it is suited well to the style,along with a very light body it is needed for any mouthfeel at all.I had this alongside Kobe beef,so I was a little distracted by the $100 steak being cooked in front of me,wish I had somthing good to say about this boaring brew! nice bottle."
"Drinkability? It ISN'T DRINKABLE. Enough said."
"Review adjusted for a better can in 2010."
"Pours golden with a head that fades quickly to a thin swirl on top but leaves some slight lacing. Smells clean, light, slight minerally and with a noticeable smell of rice. fresh smelling as well. I think the can makes a difference in stopping the skunking of this beer. The taste is similar. Slight yeastiness, some light pleasant rice flavors, clean and fresh tasting with a light bitterness on the finish. Smooth and somewhat crisp. I was looking for a lawnmower beer and this fit the bill. Not bad for what it is, but obviously not the end all be all either."
"This one was pleasant when paired with other lagers, but I'm not a pale lager fan. At any rate, easy to drink, reasonably balanced with minimal hops/malt. ok beer. A bit biscuity and again, very easy drinking. Pale yellow with same soapy head. Soft at least."
"This brew reminds me more of Mexico than Japan. It is a clear yellow color with a middling white head. The taste and nose are light but skunky. I find old grassy hops and ricey malts. The body is light and overly carbonated. Not the most drinkable brew due to multiple factors."
"It's an okay drink, nothing I'd go out of the way to purchase, but not a bad thirst quencher."
"24 Fl Oz., to be precise. My pour produced two fingers of rocky, bone-white head. The nose had a very characteristic lager sweetness to it. Color was a pale lemon-yellow with NE-quality clarity. Mouthfeel was medium with a mostly lager-like sweetness on the tongue, although like a previous reviewer, I did catch a light smokiness. I wonder what drives that? Lots of carbonation evident in terms of bubbles. Say, whatever happened to ""Bubbles"" McGough, a high school classmate of mine? Prosit, Bubs, wherever you may be! Finish was slightly sweet, nothing terrible, but not great, either. For the $, it was decent. Taking into consideration the portability of the packaging plus the size, it was a bargain."
"avoid at all costs, just drink the free water instead"
"The bear poured out of the bottle a straw golden color with a big white head that dissipated quickly. Aroma is pale malt with some other grain also present, rice I suppose. Light on the palate with the feel of some carbonation. The flavor is very light, almost not there, but hints of malt and again a somewhat unpleasing and unidentified flavor. A very slight bitterness at the end. Not the greatest."
"Got this one when I made a call for ""interesting beers"" from my buddies. Poured a macro-looking yellow color with a weak head that dissolves to a fine film. Pretty weak. Nose smells like cooked rice, barbecue, maybe some light roasted malt. Weird. Flavor is lots of rice, grainy malt. No real hop bitterness. Doesn't taste good, although the flavor's a lot more present than your BMC - that weird kind of smoky thing. Feel is thin with high carbonation. Overall, it's not good. I won't drink it again unless someone sticks"
"I guess I would consider this the Budweiser of Japan. Pours a pale lemon yellow with a white, quick fizzling head. Smells of very faint hops and a dash of cooked rice. Taste pretty baron with very small hops and a minute detection of rice. Carbonation makes it hard to quaff."
"D - i ordered this at a japanese restaurant as it was the only draught option. i've had it before and never quite enjoyed it, but often it is the only option. i think i've probably had it in america for the last time though."
"D- not quite what i expected (i wanted something to go with my oriental take-out). maybe this is why people in japan drink budweiser. do they? but nonetheless it scored in the D zone for being like barley flavored water. bonsai!"
"No way. I'd rather have any American macro than this macro from Japan. I'm going to finish it, because I'm not one to waste $2.49, but I'm not going to like it."
"After being informed that my favorite Sushi Beer was out of stock, I was stuck with a Kirin Ichiban. Overall, I was not at all impressed. A pale yellow leads to a bitter smell with an overwhelming smell and taste of alcohol. I might have been upset about not having a Saporro, but the Kirin simply didn't settle well. I began to feel bloated from the over-carbonation."
"Ordered a bottle last weekend at a sushi restaurant on Comm Ave. Pours with a pale yellow color, small bubbly head, and lots of carbonation. Smelled like all other Macros out there. Taste-wise, it was much more like a corn based lager than rice based. Not much different than BMC. Just a plain lager that doesn't do much to overpower the food. It's a decent beer to have with sushi, but I'd prefer a Sapporo with dinner."
"The beer looks like any mass produced lager, crystal clear and the color of straw with a thick white head. The aroma is mostly neutral, but on the malty side if anything. Paradoxically the flavor is on the hoppy side of neutral, if only from the bitterness in the after-taste. Everything about this is neutral but that's the style so I'm not scoring it too low. The drinkability is high, as is the drinkability of water."
"Fairly bland and tasteless. Now I know what a Japanese Rice Lager is like I guess. No better or worse than an American Macro Lager I suppose."
"drinkability is decent. this is a standard light lager, which could use a bit more character. overall not bad, just a bit watery."
"Drinkability: Not a bad beer but not a sipper."
"Pale clear gold with fair fuzzy white head, and solid lace. Wheat cereal aroma with apple grape highlights. Tart grain flavor, weak but fizzy carbonation salvages the overall experience. Very drinkable but whimpier than expected. Pretty disappointing yet refreshing."
"I highly recommend this beer option if available and you are at a bar with nothing but domestic swill available."
"D - This isn't anything other than what it's supposed to be. An easy drinking food beer, or an excellent pick for an all night super-session. This is a nice beer for gulping, not sipping."
"Suprisingly young, bottled on January 4th, 2008 in Los Angeles. Aroma is moderate malts, light grassy hops along with wet cardboard and urine. Pours with a forced carbonation large soapy white head. Supprisingly it has fair lacing. Flavor is pretty bitter. Goes down dry. I still believe this is the best of the main stream Jappanese beers."
"Light to medium gold with a fair amount of white head. Definite lacing as I drink. Smell is of honey sweet malt mostly. Taste is refreshing, slightly watery, with a touch of bitter and sweet malt up front followed by a smooth lightly sweet rice-like finish. I really like this one, and it is definitely my favorite light lager. Very easy drinking and refreshing with a hot meal, or on a hot day and exactly what I'm looking for when I want a cold beer to cool me off."
"D - Could be worse. I can drink it, but most people probably wouldn't like this. No reco's here."
"Had a bottle of this at the excellent Shogun restaurant (though I had to ask for a glass). Pours a transparent yellow with no real head and no lacing. Could easily see objects through the glass. Did not bode well. I could hardly smell anything, though what I did smell was unimpressive. It tasted just like any old American lager - that is to say there was almost no taste. I noticed some rice notes as it warmed a little bit, but this kind of stuff is better ""enjoyed"" cold. Mouthfeel is extremely light, but very carbonated. The carbonation at least made it a bit more interesting than stagnant water. The ABV is low enough to make this a good session beer...but why would you want another one?"
"Drinkability was good and it is easy to put back. Not a beer to drink if you want to take it slow and have a good flavor to savor for a while."
"Overall it's good for the style. Great to have with light meals such as sushi...hmmmm...it's a Japanese beer...probably not a coincidence. Also great for sake bombs. You have to rate this beer against other of it's styles."
"D - This one is not very good and one that I won't get again. Even for the rice lager style it just does not come across as very good at all"
"This is a pretty rotten beer. Tastes just like any old American macrobrew, that is to say, it had no taste at all. It's very much like Budweiser in all respects: Light appearance, muted and unimpressive smell and no discernible taste. Should definitely be avoided."
"Very light straw color with tons of carbonation. Pouring gently into my pilsner glass gave an inch of head. It smells lightly of malt, and otherwise has little smell to speak of. Taste is like american light beer. Mouthful is thin and reminds me of rice. However, I imagine this would be a good chugger for a hot evening in the Pachinko parlor."
"I was hoping that this beer was going to be something akin to Asahi in taste but it fell dismally short. It poured a light amber colour with a finger width of head that almost disappeared instantaneously. It strongly smelled of hops and not much else. Tastes very ricey and it is very fizzy. Mouthfeel is a little light and it is really watery. I wasn't so impressed with this as I was with Asahi beer. I don't think I'll be actively seeking this one out again."
"Edit: didn't even notice that this is brewed by AB, well good for them that they brewed this, stop the prejudice...although I will try to sample some authentic Japanese competition."
"pours a clear straw color with a white head that fades quickly to just beer. smell of spoiled veggies . taste the same thats all i wish to say about that. mouthfeel is light, carbonation is ok. way over priced for a maco brewed beer and not a very good one at that definitely will not buy again."
"Suitable perhaps for sake bombing, just to get into the spirit of things, but pretty awful."
"if you're like me and can only get kirin ichiban and sapporo draft, and occasionally asahi in your area but want to try a nice japanese drink, i'd recommend going for a good quality sake or even some simple japanese teas (matcha is wonderful!) rather than the beers that are more commonly imported to the US. perhaps people on the west coast can get the good beers?"
"Pours a pale golden color with a decent amount of fluffy white head that fades away leaving a thin layer on top. Smells faintly of hops and a little of yeast. No malty aroma there. The taste is fairly clean, some nondescript sweetness. There's also some hop bitterness there as well, but it's hard to make out any real hop flavor. The mouthfeel is a little tingly, but mostly watery. Overall, it's very drinkable, only because there's not much to object to. Pretty standard asian macro beer."
"Whatever...It's a macro-like beer that is hurt by an unusual astringency. Why bother with this one..."
"I'm glad I tried it, definitely not the best Japanese beer I've had, but pretty decent."
"D-Not particularly offensive or notable in any way. Typical mass produced lager with a certain industrial feel. I sometimes have this when I am not in the mood for sake. To be honest anything with too aggressive of a flavour profile would get in the way of the delicate raw fish."
" I ain't mad atcha, Kirin."
"Pours out a pale golden color, with a little head, no lacing, and a fair amount of carbonation. No real scent to speak of, just a general malty scent, but rather bland. Same for the taste, it's quite bland and nothing really speaks out. It goes down fine, and this could possibly be a thirst quencher on a hot day, but water would work just as well without the expectations. Worth a try if you want a Japanese beer, but that's about it."
"The nose is skunk right off the pour,which sticks around and lingers lightly the whole time your drinking this brew.Some mild grass and maybe grains or rice kinda smell in there also.Taste is crisp and refreshing with the mild grass coming thru,goes down nice and easy with some mild bitterness and has a mild carb feel to it.Kinda thin on the way down but very high on the consumable list.Not a bad beer at all."
"served in a bottle at Buddha Sushi in the USVI. Pours like a common macro from the states.Has a big brew smell,nothing that stands out.Carbonation is good for this brew.Minor malt detection with the hint of hops and way too much rice flare.I'm sure this is a very common beer in Japan as Bud,Miller and Coors are here.This is nothing special at all and has no home in my fridge."
"Pours out a golden straw without much carbonation in the body. Head is thin, but leaves specks of lace. Nose is really faint and clean. Hints of cooked rice. Malt is weak in the flavor, but has a very VERY clean overall flavor profile. Nice subdued sweetness and a finish that is dry. Slight bitterness in the aftertaste. Mouthfeel is really light and fizzy. This is refreshing, I'll give it that, but, even for a beer made with rice adjuncts, this is kind of lacking. Not bad, really. I'd take this over a Pabst."
"Drinkability- Basically the japanese version of BMC, not recomended."
"This beer started out good, but lost it. I really think that this could've been an excellent beer, but lost it late."
"Very light tasting beer with an adjunct flavor. Tastes like a cheap macro, not super bad, but not good. Has a decent appearance, an adjunct filled smell. Taste suffers slightly from a little bit of out of control tannins, but the flavor is just light shit with adjuncts to appeal to the masses. Take a pass on this beer, there are better beers out there by far."
"D - A very clean, easy drinkin' sessionable lager that is crisp and refreshing. I could have one as a lawnmower beer - it goes well with just about any pre-packaged food incl. mac & cheese."
"Not a bad Japanese beer"
"Pours a yellow straw with a soapy foam head that laces. Smells of faint warm sake and grain. Tastes of watery malt and not much else. A little bite that reminds me of hops. Light in the mouth and drinkable for colored water. To be honest, its not that bad it just doesnt boast craft beer flavor. It does compliment my sushi very well being that its refreshing and renews the palate for picking out the subtle delicious flavors of the nigiri at hand."
"Brought to me in a pilsener glass with a white head that died down to leave lacing around the top of the glass. Smell has some sweetness, and smells a little bit of rice and grains. At first I did not taste much but then I tasted some hoppiness with a bittering mouthfeel that follows. Highly carbonated and tastes watery."
"Described as ""rice lager."" That's really all you need to know."
"Poured pale yellow with white head that dissipated quickly. Typical pale lager smell, mostly benign, nothing notable. Mouthfeel was thin and watery while carbonation was very noticeable and high. Taste was bland with no real hops character. Not much different than a typical macro and just found out this is brewed by Anheuser-Busch"
"D: We are doomed!! American consumer should rather spend less money on Bud light rather than drink this! Ahhh!!!"
"Not a bad beer but not a great beer. Very average and fairly drinkable (but not overly so)."
"Kirin Ichiban is the term Nabihci Nirik spelled backwards. It might as well be, cause this beer is no good and tough to consume."
"Certainly not one I'd go out of my way to try, and I doubt I'll be drinking this again."
"Taste is pretty nondescript, it was hard to pinpoint rice from corn, but that seemed to be the only flavor. Very clean & dry aftertaste, not much of anything really. Crisp, prickly mouthfeel, lots of fizzy carbonation. It was easy to drink a pint with Chinese food, but it was definitely not memorable."
"Overall, it was characterless, bland and empty. Not a chance it will pass through my throat again."
"22oz bomber depicting a mythical horse/dragon creature on the label - nice packaging, but it's downhill from there. The body is clear yellow with a short-lived fizzy head. The smell and taste are dominated by a thin and one-dimensional sweetness, a bit cloying. Not much of a hop presence, just a brief bitterness in the finish. Thin-bodied with large bubbles that make for a slightly harsh carbonation. Not a particularly impressive lager - best avoided unless you're desperate for a beer."
"330 ml bottle, bought in Norway at Vinmonopolet. ABV is 5.0%. Brewed by ""Wells & Youngs Brewing Co. Ltd., Bedford, UK for and under license from Kirin Brewery Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan"". Website www.kirineurope.com . Crystal clear very pale golden colour, large and lingering head. Fairly strong sweetish fruity and flowery aroma, notes of artificial candy, hints of grass and honey. Fairly bland and dry flavour but not offensive, very moderate hops. Moderate carbonation, soft mouthfeel. Not very interesting."
"I will not get a bottle again, as apart from the rice-lager tag, it is nothing special. The only reason for paying a premium beer price for this beer is to show off to your mates, as it doesn't taste a whole lot different than most macro lagers, and it is worse than some."
"Poured a dull pale golden yellwo with a big white head, lots of carbonation. No real smell, slightly grainey and bland would be st describe it. The taste followed suit, nothing really to write home baout. It went well with the dinner, but I would definatly not seek this one out on a regular basis, just nothing real special about it at all."
"Appeared a dark straw yellow with a thin white head. Not much of an aroma at all to speak of, to tell the truth. Maybe a little bit of malt. The taste was overwhelmingly malty sweet with some yeastiness on the finish that overwhelmed an oh-so-faint hoppy bite. Not particularly crisp, but not particularly flat in the mouth. Slightly thin. Not terrible in terms of drinkability, but nothing to put yourself out for either. By no means as bad (at least on tap) as many of the reviews would indicate, but far from a great beer either. Basically, it's acceptable to wash down a meal, but next time I'm at our local Japanese restaurant, I'll go back to the Harpoon IPA (the best of an uninteresting selection) at the same price."
"Poured a an off-yellow, straw color, 1/2 finger head. Smell was weak, only picked up a little bit of slightly sweet malts. Taste is pretty good: crisp and very dry. A nice balance of malt and hop, I could definately pick up the rice flavor, which came off as a pleasant, grainy taste. A nice bitter kick at the end, but slightly too carbonated for my liking. A great session beer, which pairs very well with Japanese food. I think this is my favorite of the famous Japanese big-time breweries."
"D- Average light lager, acceptable."
"Personally for the style, and the correct setting -""This is a non-offensive beer, and definitely something to enjoy and kick back some food with."""
"maybe the most watery lager I've tried so far..starts to go flat tasting rather quickly as well. Easy enough to drink.The bottle says 'special premium reserve'...well don't save anymore for me..1 is good."
"Drinkability - Average beer, aquired this in a trade. Not worth a try i think. Not an awful beer though. Average."
"Pretty good for what I paid for it but not something I'll purchase regularly."
"Another easy to drink quaffing beer, but far from a quality brew."
"Pale amber in color, it has a good head but otherwise there is nothing distinctive about its appearance. Taste and smell are about average; it has a bit of a bite but no bitterness. Kirin feels zingy and goes down smoothly, so while it is not a spectacular or distinctive beer, it makes a good companion to a meal or something to sip while watching a game or movie."
"Okay drink to accompany a meal, too weak to stand alone. It also has a cool dragon on the label - can't go wrong with dragons, even if this is AB."
"Poured a soapy like white head that dissolved into nothing. No lacing present. Lots of bubbling carbonation. It is a clear straw yellow color. Slight bitterness on the finish. It is suprisingly very dry like a seltzer water. Dry wheat taste with a touch of sweet malt. Reminds me of all the headache beers i've drank. Typical cheap macro-beer taste.Not even worth importing into the US."
"poured out into a your typical yellowish color topped off with a small head. the smell mildly resembles that of old english, but Kirin Ichiban goes down a lot smoother.it has semi dry feel to it with a slightly bitter after taste but not bad over all."
"An ok drink but nothing special"
"Pretty typical lager, decent flavors, good mouthfeel, easy drinkability. I enjoyed this lager at a recent trip to a Japanese steak house, it fit the mood, was easy to drink, didn't override or hurt any of the food taste. A pretty nondescript beer, but good considering the Japanese are not well known for incredible brews, I would rate this just above Sapporo, definitely worth a try."
"Slightly better than your average macro lager but it's still not bringing much to the table."
"this is what i remember it tasting like when i was a young sailor.nothing spectacular here.comes in a brown long neck bottle with a born on date.you can taste the alcohol i think it is higher than listed.pours and has moderate head.even lacing down the glass.taste ok i wouldnt turn it down."
"Lived in Japan for awhile (back in my non-drinking days). The advertising for Kirin was all over the place. So I was intensely curious when I found it in a bottle at the Japanese steakhouse. Nice golden color, with a bit of fizziness that quickly disappates. The rice adjuncts are rather obvious, but I found the taste silky smooth, light, and crisp. It went very well with Japanese food and would, I'm sure, be great with just about anything. Easily one of the most drinkable beers out there. One interesting side note for any of you familiar with our macro-light offerings... If someone were to ask me what Kirin Ichiban tastes like, I'd say my first impression is that it reminded me of Coors Light, only with a richer taste and decent body. I guess it's what Coors Light wants to be if it were to ""grow up"" and become a ""real beer."" Easily one of my favorite ""go to"" beers when out on the town. Not quite Sapporo, but great for a session beer--especially at Benihana's."
"The carbonation is just about right, but it's still watery. Drinkable like water, but it would be more thirst quenching if it had at least a little more hops."
"Kirin Ichiban, even the Special Premium Reserve, is a very average, extremely nondescript lager. If you've had Sapporo, that's pretty much Kirin Ichiban. It pours gold with minimal white head and minimal lacing. It tastes the same as many macro lagers that use rice and has the same thin mouthfeel. It goes down easily, but it's completely forgettable."
"People generally give Ichiban average or bad reviews but I want to upgrade this style of beer. It's refreshing and thirst quneching just as a good pilsener. It poured with a pale, yellow color but the smell was full of flowers, bread and citrus. The foam disappeared quickly but it was still very fizzy. The taste was dry with pronounced notes of citrus and bread. It tastes great well-chilled. Licensed brewed in the UK."
"D- Not much, 1 pint and so bloated, wont seek out again!"
"Tried this beer last night.. was not impressed. Couldn't smell much of anything, very clean scent. Mouthfeel was decent, but the taste was very bland and watered down. Detected a slight rice flavor, but not much of anything else. Would not order this again, there are plenty others that represent this style much better."
"GET MY BUZZ ON-n"
"Another sample from my AB rep friend. Not a bad beer altogether but nothing really going on. would of liked it better had it actually been brewed with Japanese water. Taste strikingly similiar to an American Macro, so I'm sure many people out there would find it very drinkable, (only reason it doesn't get a lower drinkability score.)"
"I only hope that the original ""at source"" brew is better. But, I won't be in a hurry to find out. I dumped the second half of the glass, not worth the effort drinking this; life is too short!"
"Finishes dryly, light/medium bitterness, not much aftertaste."
"Overall a nice beer to accompany sushi. Nothing really exciting though."
"Kirin Ichiban was a clear golden color with a white head that was quick to dissapear. The aroma was light with a little malt and some hops. The taste was light with a dry finish. The body was light with medium carbonation. It's just another boring lager in the same league as b-m-c. You can do better with your money."
"This is decent beer. There's absolutly nothing outstanding about it but it's better that most American macro brews. It pours a deep gold color with weak head and decent lacing. It smells very crisp to me, not really like vegetable matter like some other have said. It has a dry lagery taste that's typical of beers from nihon. The mouthfeel is a noticeably smooth though. I like it. It's a little hoppier and not quite as dry as asahi super dry."
"The bottle artwork is pretty cool, though."
"Like Sapporo, very average beer. Apperance was light amber with a small white head; very little lacing on the glass. Had this with spicy asian food and it was a good pairing, but not much of a smell/taste--light hops & malt aroma/taste. Mild beer that went well with the Asian food I was eating, but I would not have it on its own."
"D - Overall, not too bad. Can't say it's flavourful, but then again, it wouldn't be reasonable to be so. Better than I expected."
"Drinkability: None"
"Overall: Feels and taste like an AB light lager. Very easy to drink nothing special, went well with a grilled chicken entrée."
"One is enough for now. Although, this may go well on a warm summer day or with some sushi. Probably best served cold. I found no improvements in flavor when it warmed."
"Japanese lager brewed in LA? Hmm... I seem to remember this being better in the past, but I could be imagining things. That said, while I don't think this is a particularly good beer, it's not bad. While I'm sure I won't get it at the store again, I'll continue to get this when I go out for sushi (goes quite well with it, because it's not heavy, has a light flavor, and has a spicyness)."
"Drinkability: This is good for a multi-session beer, and I could probably drink a bunch of these in succession. However, this is not something I would drink for flavor or enjoyment. Very average overall."
"I found this to be an all around average beer with nothing at all special about it. I ordered it at a seafood restaraunt Dixie Crossroads in Flordia with some shrimp and scallops. It poured a rich golden color with a very small head. It smelled of mellow hops, and light malts. Nothing unique at all. It tastes alright and is fairly thirst quenching but overall far to mild."
"On its own not so good"
"Drinkability: This is a very good beer, ably representing its style. I could have had many more, if only I weren't driving..."
"Overall: A strange brew overall: a kind of unbalanced combinaton that makes it rather unpleasant."
"This crystal clear beer has a light yellow tint. There is a thin white layer with some mottling and the aroma is faint hops, rice, and mostly old penny smell. Tastes like rice, booze, and sugar, but you have to concentrate to really taste anything. Grippy mouthfeel, chalky aftertaste. Whatever."
"Can't recommend this one, unless you like sweet, American Macro piss...sorry. (I mean: too sweet, yellow, fizzy, watery beer?)"
"First sip is an awkward bite of alcohol and over-sweet malt character. There's a slight hop bitterness and dryness on the way back. Weird soapiness as well... This beer is very confused, rather than striking any sort of pleasant balance of flavours, it's just a mish-mash that tries to be something it's not. Watery and rather thin in the mouth. Good for washing down Sushi, that's about it."
"Drinkability: I think I'd like some more! A good match for a variety of Japanese foods - sushi, okonomiyaki, yakisoba, tempura, ramen, etc. - just don't try it with anything too spicy."
"Overall, another consistent but unchallenging macro lager. I see no real reason to order this over Bud or Bud Light at the local Sushi bar. Thankfully, I only paid a buck for a 22 oz bottle on sale."
"Cheers2Beers"
"Overall, nothing to get excited about, but not offensive. Clean and crisp, but lacking personality. Perhaps with some sashimi it could work. I've given it mostly ""average"" ratings based on the style, but certainly not a beer I will seek out for future consumption."
"22 ounce bomber purchased at Piggly-Wiggly in Charleston, SC. I thought this would go good with some fresh boiled shrimp I was preparing. Boy was I wrong. Pours a pale golden yellow with a thin head that quickly dissipates. Aroma is of cut grass and hay. Taste is much of the same but there is some hop bitterness. Mouthfeel is too dry for my tastes. At least it was not a total loss, I can use the bottle for my homebrew."
"Drinkability: It's drinkable, but if forced to chose a beer from Japan, I would probably pick something else."
"The only real detraction is that it's brewed by Budweiser in Los Angeles and if you have been to LA, you know that the water quality there is not very good."
"Cheers!"
"Packed with carbonation, it did have a fairly crisp bite to it. On tap, I had no problem finishing it, but there are too many other good offerings to sit with this one for more than a pint."
"This baby was not from Japan but ""a product of the USA Anheuser-Busch. Los Angeles"". Technically still an import in Canada but the label leads you to think it's from Japan."
"The body is light. Overall this is a little to skunky for my flavor but if you drink it cold it tastes better."
"Okay, but what makes it ""Special Premium Reserve""?"
"Purchased a 24 ounce can at the grocery store. Pours a pale yellow with a thick head. Very little aroma, very little taste, in a word its bland, even by American lager standards. The can says ""Brewed under the strict supervision of Kirin's brewmaster by Anheuser-Busch, Inc., Los Angeles, CA"" Not recommended."
"Had this on tap at the local pub recently. Pours a very clear yellow color with a small white head that falls fast and doesn't leave much lacing on the glass. The aroma is mostly grainy with a very faint hop scent. Not much there. The flavor just is not very good at all. Grainy flavors tend to be overpowering and there's nothing there to balance it. Few hops, low maltiness. Slightly more tasty than a normal macro lager, but that doesn't make it good."
"I think my fellow BAers are way to kind with this one. I think it's horrible beer; expecially since they try to pass it off as if it were a quality brew. Looks promising in the off set with a strong straw color and fluffy retention, but the aromas tell the tale. Smells quite grainy with the malts, light on the hops and with little character. Tastes of cereal grains everywhere with a modest barley malt flavor. All flavors are fleeting leaving a grain and husk flavor and texture. Aftertaste is similar to American Lite beers. In fact, this whole beer resembled American Lagers, but with twice the price. Not worth it."
"Crisp, light and refreshing as long as it's ice cold, similar to American mass market lagers."
"My first of the style, not bad, but it reminds a bit too much of you average macro, adjunct lager. Still, recommended, if only for how light and refreshing it is."
"Taste: Shouldn't have ordered a 22 oz bottle the free water was going down better. Next time i'll get the sushi to go over chance the sapporro (sp?) or Asai, can't be any worse..."
"D = Have I mentioned the grassy taste? Well that about sums it up. Ain't going to be drinking this in a hurry."
"Pours a light straw yellow with a tons of carbonation, finger of bright white head, some small amount of lacing. Nose is very grainy, not much there but unoffensive. Taste is a light sweet caramel malt, slightly grassy, a slight bitter finish. Thin mouthfeel with a nice lively carbonation and a crisp finish. This is a simple lager, slightly better than American macros, easy enough to wash teriyaki down with."
"As I'm wondering why the hell I'm drinking this, I read the label and find out that this is actually brewed in the USA by Anheuser-Busch. There is also a production date in very small print in the bottom left hand corner of the label (12May05) Yikes, 7 month old beer. Had this happen a couple times in the last batch of singles. Guess I better start looking more carefully. I don't think the age has hurt or helped it. There's no skunk at all, but I still can't drink this. Drain pour."
"overall- i wasnt expecting something good, but just something refreshing and easy to drink. what i got wasnt really either. the initial taste is pretty decent but it finishes with a nasty skunk flavor that ruins the beer."
"Overall, not worth drinking if you want good beer. As an easy-drinking beverage, it's not awful, though. Decent macro."
"This is an atrocious beer. I mean really, really awful. One of the worst beers I've ever tasted. Offensive and undrinkable. I cannot recommend enough that you stay away from this shit."
"Pours a very clear strong yellow color with a 2 finger head that falls to a small coating over top. Nose is crisp. Light hop, very clean but without much else. Flavor is clean, big grainy, very modest noble hop. Its not all that bad. Feel is a light moderate with a moderate carbonation. Overall, a pretty okay beer. I'd take this over a macro any day."
"Pours a crystal clear straw, with a thin white head. Weak retention and lacing. Smells of adjuncts and spent hops, with a fruity ester scent. Rice adjunct flavor that does not make up enough malt presence to balance the mildly bitter hops; or hide the tangy ester taste. The light body and average carbonation fail to hide the cloying skunk, and it soon becomes overwhelming. You'll find the finish astringent and dry, if you make it that far."
"nondescript."
"Special premium reserve. Must be good stuff. Born on 19JUL05. Pours a half finger large bubbled nearly white head over a crystal clear dull light straw-golden liquid. Smells lightly sweet and very grainy. There is also a dark musty that stings the nose, which I think is floral hops, possibly mixed with some alcohol. The grain smell is unusual and it is remniscent of rice, coming across sort of like rice-chex cereal. Not a complex profile, but interesting. Taste is mild and watery, to say the least. Gentle malt sweet with mushroom and pumpkin. Overcarbonated and the acrid bubbles that form on my tongue are a bother, so I will swirl to release some gas. The head refomed, much more sticky and attractive this time. The smell is much more like that of an american macro (corn is present) and now I also get a very faint hint of chili powder. That is really weird. The taste is much smoother now. The beer has two phases...early is a gentle sweet and this changes to a dry finish that comes across as bland grain fiber mixed with an aromatic from a hop (flavor is too faint for me to hazard a guess). Thin body and easy drinking. This beer is pretty much fits the bill for the style, which is how I've rated it (not to my preferences, mind you)."
"Not a bad beer at all, seems more like a darkened Macro lager (contract brewed by AB too). More body than most other beers available at sushi places except for the everpresent SNPA."
"Sampled in a 24 ounce can. Note, this beer is brewed in LA by Anhueser Busch. I feel cheated already. Straw to gold in color with a quickly disapating head and nice lace. Nose is absent, shoved my face in the glass, a void, the least nose of any beer I have ever had. Sweet malt and adjunct flavor, not offensive, not eventful. Very light on the tonque and in the mouth. Very drinkable but I prefer flavor."
"Pours an amber clear color with a large fluffy white head that fades slowly: one point in its favor. The nose is unimpressive, smelling faintly of malt. Flavor is typical macro lager but somewhat more bitter, which is a nice plus. Mouth is watery and refreshing; this is a drinkable beer. Theres a slight bitter finish. Overall, this is a slightly better than average lager-type beer. But at $7.50 plus per sixer, it's probably not worth the price."
"I expected more of a rounded, firm malty character, with moderate bitterness, and a dry finish. I was very disappointed, this is not a desirable Japanese Rice Lager."
"On-tap at PF Changs in Woodland Hills, CA. It's like night-and-day versus the bottle or can. Yellow-orange pour with a fluffy white head. Mild hops and wheat grass on the nose. A decent acidic hoppiness on the tongue with a bit of grain feel to it. Somewhat dry. It matches most of the cuisine well as it isn't overpowering nor does it amplify the spices in the food too much."
"I had a couple of bottles of this brew over sushi at a Japanese restaurant. The food was great, the beer was so-so. The bottle says that this is brewed by A-B, Los Angeles, CA. It pours a light gold color, with a thin fizzy head. It has very little hop aroma, and a little malt-ish flavor in the front-taste. Dry, grainy, and simple. This is a one-dimensional brew. Its not unappealing, just hollow."
"I have no idea why this is popular in Japan. Appearance is golden, with a good head of foam and lace that remains a while. Aroma is very sulphurous and skunky  with some overcooked vegetables thrown in. The initial taste is fizzy and sharp on the tongue, grain and malt are present, but one is left with a terrible taste in the mouth. A good beer to skip."
"Shrug. A good beer to drink with copiuos amounts of Sushi. It is gold color and has a head that kicks quickly and leaves no lace. It smells of puffed rice and grainy alcohol. No real malt taste and if there are hops in here they all died. Standard low body beer and easy to drink quickly."
"Nothing to seek out, but also nothing to pass if offered."
"Pours a golden pilsner in color with a fizzy accumulation of foam on top that reminds of a glass of pop. The smell is similar to a Bud or Coors Light, only a touch sweeter. The taste is unwelcome. Its actually okay at first sip, but midway through a strange-tasting bitterness takes over. The drink is concluded with a very watery mouthfeel and a flavor to match. Blah. I also notice a bready aftertaste towards the end of the beer."
"Drinkability: Better than most Asian macros. For the style, quite good and refreshing. I'd have another one, only I've got a Polish beer to review. Bye."
"Hmm let's see. Pale yellow color with an ok lace around the glass for a head. Smells kind of skunky and semi-sweet. A little bit of grains are present. Has a light carbonated body like all adjunct lagers. But since this is a Japanese beer they call it a rice lager? (Budweiser?) The taste is just the same old cooked grains and faint hop bitterness. Has a odd metallic finish. Really nothing new going on with this beer. Well this is the Budweiser of Japan. Scary part is, this beer is brewed Anheuser-Busch! I think I should have just saved a dollar and picked up a can of Budweiser. Their is really no difference."
"If I ever drank this beer again it would be (excepting of course situations in which a beer is needed but selection is limited) to blow everyone's mind with the dragon deer. If I weren't drinking from a tall can, I would feel superior to most beer drinkers. I'm sure the good folks at Kirin will keep our little secret."
"Light and drinkable, but I'd rather cut off my foot than have another one."
"D-This is very unique even from other adjunct beers. It accents the rice in the beer instead of masking it. The smell kind of puts me off but the taste in surprisingly interesting. I didn't find the beer all that well rounded just unique. I didn't notice any malt and only faint hints of hops."
"This beer used to be at a bar me and my friend go to. When they first had it, we had it off the tap. It really wasnt bad. It had a bit of a different taste, but wasnt bad. sort of smooth, nothing bad. However about a week later, we had another one, and yuck, it tasted foul, smelt off, just wasnt good. So i guess if your going to try this, try to amke sure it's fresh, otherwise dont expect much."
"This beer is a light, crisp lager without too much character. It is not bad with light Asian meals such as sushi, but I feel that there are better beers out there, such as Sapporo and even Tsingtao. This beer is refreshing, but there is simply nothing remarkable about it."
"($2.29 / 24 oz. tall can)"
"I was able to drink it with no problems as I had my somewhat spicy Chinese food. Went fairly well with it. By no means a good beer, but it was, over all, ok. Probably won't have again."
"This beer reminds me of a slightly better Coors. Actually maybe more like Coors light. Very little flavor and the body is very light. There's a dry malt, grainy flavors with that unique Asian hop flavor. This is very similar to the other Asian lagered beers out there. Nothing special here."
"Pretty drinkable with some sushi, but far from the best Japanese rice lager."
"Oh shit...I'm hit...the creature has cut me with its powerful tail. Darting forward I slash the vile half deer, half dragon's throat, rendering it lifeless in a massive pool of blood. Intrigued by the scent of the blood and dehydrated from my journey I bend down and cup my hand taking a large sip. It's light and watery with very little flavor. Grainy, rice like sweetness with subtle hints of grass and herbal spice. I was expecting more from such a mythical creature. It flows into my stomach like water with tiny bubbling carbonation. I may have won the fight, but my reward is not very sweet. I fear it is time for me to move on, as there are many other creatures to do battle with. I am proud to have conquered the fabled half deer, half dragon...but I am left wondering if it was worth the fight and nearly losing my life."
"Pale color with a head that disappears immediately. Had a yeasty smell that made me think it would almost be ""chewy"" when I tasted it. However it turned out to be thin with a flat aftertaste. I'm not familair with oriental beer so maybe it is supposed to be this way. I was not impressed."
"Thin mouthfeel and average drinkability. I guess this is ok, but a better beer would have made the sushi even more enjoyable."
"Overall average. Nothing stood out about this one, and I don't think I will seek it out again."
"12oz bottle. Poured a light golden/straw color with little foam or carbonation. I'm a fan of the regular Kirin Ichiban so I was expecting a little more from this beer. The smell was slightly skunky with a light hoppy overtune. The taste was pretty bland and unimpressive. Won't be filling my fridge with this anytime soon. PR 2.0/5 below ML."
"Straw colored and clear with a column of co2 rising from the bottom of the glass. Head is full and white, but dies relatively quickly. Smells a little skunky, fruity and sweet with a hoppy background. Flavor is much blander than expected. A light sweet start with a kind of Styrofoam middle and an effervescent/dry finish. Mouthfeel is quite lively, but does not make up for the almost empty taste. Quite void of character. Not bad, just bland."
"(I took one last look at the label before tossing the bottle and saw ""brewed under the strict supervision of Kirin's brewmaster by Anheuser-Busch Inc."" That explains a lot)."
"This yellow brew poured a non sustaining head. Nothing notable about the smell. Taste was OK, mostly notable for it's dry hop finish. This is a very thin beer, very watery. Overall it complimented the spicy dish I had fairly well and would be tasty to quench one's thirst after laboring in the yard but it is one that I would not purchase."
"This is a very pale beer. The palest yellow I have ever seen! Reminds of water mixed with a very small amount of lemonade. Doesn't even have a bit of gold or urine colour, just a very pale yellow. And no head. Lots of lace, but no head. Bland smell. I cannot stress how bland this smells. Rice is the dominant scent, but it's still very faint. Some kind of grass smell as well. Could it be hops? Tastes like a low budget Budweiser when cold. Rice adjunct, white bread taste. Obvious thirst quencher, but only when cold. And I mean ice cold. Cuz as this liquid warms, it gets nasty. A horrible, cardboard taste that's surprisingly and terribly sour. And another flavour that is bad. Bitter? Yeah. But not the good bitter. This is a bad bitter. Don't know what makes it a bad bitter, but it is. No hops detected. Then again, my tongue has been bombarded with this awful taste that it can't even detect the spicyness of my meal after I drank this. But it is okay when cold, so I'll give it an extra half point for that. Mouthfeel is very flat. Very little carbonation. My toilet water has more carbonation after I fart taking a crap. Drinkable like water when cold. Undrinkable at any other temperature. This has to be near absolute zero before I could ever touch this again."
"Very dissapointing. Pours a pale yellow with a little fizzy head. The smell was of skunk and wet rice, slight toasty grains, very little sweetness. The taste was much the same, light rice taste with nothing else attacking the taste buds, picked this up with some sushi and it did not compliment the dish at all. Won't go with this again, Try Tsingtao or Sapporo, much much better."
"The pour is golden, clear, smallish short-lasting white head. Faint malt aroma, slight cereal touch. Refreshing. Surprisingly not that bad. Rice comes in somehow oily. Very mild vegetal bitterness. Just don't seek big sensations while drinking this, but this is better than sapporo."
"I am a bit surprised at the reviews for this one. Went to a local chinese restaraunt, saw this on the draft menu, asked if they went through a lot of it, and ended up having two of them. Brilliant gold dubloon color, no head. Aroma was slightly green grass, very faint. Mouthfeel was just shy of medium, but still decent. Carbonation wasn't overwhelming, in fact seemed a bit larger than I expected. Taste overall was a non-threatening lager, no odd or off tastes. I found it easy to drink, ended up ordering two. Would I get it again? Probably not at the beer store, but if I went to the restaraunt again, then sure. My pint glasses looked like 20 oz size."
"going by the label, kirin think this is a pretty good beer. as this is brewed by lion nathan for australia, i think someone must have forgotten to tell mr. nathan"
"Pours a very light yellow with a pillowy white head (mispour by the waitress) they head however doesnt stick around for long. The aroma is a bit sweet with an almost metallic undertone. Taste is a bit sweet with just a bit of hops at the end to try and dry it out. The flavour just seems to be light and weak.Not much to offer. Mouthfeel isnt bad as it is well carbonated and does a decent job of cleansing the palate after soy and wasabi dipped sashimi. I cant recommend this beer on its own merits, but as far as beers usually carried in Japanese restaurants this is probably one of the better choices usually available. I just wish nice sushi places would upgrade their beer choices. Oh well thats what I get for not getting the good sake."
"Everyone mentioned the weak taste, and I'll agree, but with two caveats. The first is that the Ichiban is better tasting than the regular Kirin. It has a deeper flavor that is hoppier with hints of wheat and a some malt. Second, think of it as a tool for the meal. Sushi in particular, and much japanese food in general, has a delicate taste to it. This is a beer that will refresh you with some carbonation and not overpower the flavor of the dish. Would I buy a six pack of this at the store? No, but I wouldn't want to drink an Expedition stout while eating Toro either. Kirin plays a role in the culinary arena, and it does it well."
"The smell wasnt very eloquant, it reminded me of some sweet beverage, I cant even target a specific smell. The taste wasnt that bad, nothing great, but very refreshing. A shy soft hoppish taste was present but nothing to throw myself on the wall. A beer I would get drunk on it, but once a year is enought!"
"Pours with a two-finger white head that leaves some lace. Clear pale amber color. Very light bodied and light carbonation. Slightly hoppy nose. Starts sweet with some hoppy overtones, finish is bland and watery. Works as a lawn mower beer and not much more. $1.60 for 12 oz bottle from Colonial Spirits, Acton, Ma."
"Nothing too great about this one. Had it on tap at a ""hip"" japanese restraunt in downtown Charleston, SC. The head was nice, but died out kinda quick. The smell was of light hops, citrus, a tiny bit of malt, and a little alcohol. The taste was similar, but more of a watery feel. Nothing I would get again, but I figured I would try if for the sake of being a BA."
"The heads foamy and quite irregular. The body is of a still transparent yellow color. Some surprizing smoked notes in the smell, which is mostly citric and grainy. The taste is pretty basic. Kind of watery, some fruitiness and citrus, but not much going on. Low carbonation too. Grassy hoppiness. Mouthfeel is round but very weak. Not more than average."
"This is not good. Its a dull pale gold with a wisp of head. Its got the bottling date on the bottle (brewed by Anheuser Busch for Kirin) and its fresh, but its still a little skunky. The flavor has a little straw malt, but also has something thats making me think of bile."
"Ichiban means number one in English, but this certainly is not Japan's best. Try a Sapporo instead."
"-Oelergud"
"Overall, this isn't a beer. It went ok with the chinese food I was eating but I wouldn't choose this otherwise."
"Pours a golden liquid with a white foamy head. The head disappeared very quickly. There was no lacing on the glass at all. Not much of a smell. Mostly, that macro smell, kind of like corn and rice. The taste was a bit sweet, not much bitterness at all. It did taste a bit dry in the finish. Pretty average on the mouthfeel, thin that is. It was fairly drinkable, but I am not sure why you would want to."
"Drinkability  Ive found that I seem to appreciate Japanese beers a little better than most on the site. Again, I wouldnt call this one a winner, but I think its much more drinkable than the 2.45 average that it has on the site."
"Drinkable, But I would find a Sapparo"
"Drinkability - Another fine session beer from Kirin. What I thought, however, was gonna be an evening of sampling a few Japanese beers turned out, in fact, to be a sampling of beers brewed by a Kirin brewmaster at Anheuser-Busch in California. <sigh> Whatever, it's good."
"The appearance is kinda lame, ordinary, but has a pretty nice sticky cobweb lacing. The taste is cool, distinctly grainy. It's neither strong in hops nor malt...just grain--which I actually like. A little sweet, going with the Japanese taste (my opinion), but too heavy for major drinking bouts. It definitely deserves the title ""beer"" though, so I'm glad it's sold as such."
"Pours a bubbly clear yellow gold under a very small, thin and short-lived white head. The nose is lemonade sweet, with a touch of musty corn. The mouth is heavy like wet blankets and quite prickly. The taste is pretty darn bad - sweet corn starch and old socks, followed by boiled rice and moth-eaten sweaters. No hops, no bite, no benefit. Yuck."
"Overall, I thought Kirin Ichiban was a tasty, easy-to-drink, medium-bodied import. Needless to say, i found it to be much better than Asahi. If ever I need a decidedly foreign premium beer again, I'll gladly choose Ichiban."
"This beer poured a light yellow color that was crystal clear and well carbonated. It produced a pure white head that lasted only a short time then fell to nothing but a ring on the edges of the glass. The ring produced ring like lace on the sides about half way down the glass. The aromas that came from the glass were of some hops, allot of vegetable matter, some citrus seemed to be present and a light pepper spice was also present on a few whiffs. Over all impression of the aroma was very light and hard to detect at times. Which is a good thing because the vegetable smell seemed to overpower the other aromas making it unpleasant. I hoped that the flavors were better. The tastes were kind of corn grain/husky, some malt seemed to be present, but well masked, a light bitter hop, and yeasty bread near the end of the swallow. The aftertaste was dominated by the bread. Light bodied. Over all impression of the flavors, well they were better then the aromas. Not particularly fond of all the cornhusk flavors that were present. This beer reminded me of an Anheuser-Busch product, and low and behold I read on the label that it is brewed under their strict supervision. Next bottle I believe I will pass, not worth the flavors and aromas that I experienced. Not the worst, but near the bottom."
"Fluted draft glass 24 oz. at buddies Japanese steakhouse. The hibachi surf & turf was awesome. Ichiban, the best I can guess means ""the best", maybe like Cuvee or Grand Cru... Looks just like any other lager, maybe a touch more gold than your average macrodomestic light. No head really to speak of, lower carbonation, too. Sweeter malt and subtle hop finish made this beer somewhat enjoyable. My friend, who doesn't venture much beyond Chardonnay said it tasted like C**rs Light. How dare she blasphemize such a beer? Trust me, much better then [insert random swill beer here]. It has a natural taste to it. It tastes like beer, just not really altogether good."
"They served it to me in a pilsener glass which was frosted (I waited 'till the glass warmed up to room temp). It was a clear gold color on the pour, with a big white head. Smells of malt and grain. That is also what it tasted like. Lots of malt, not enough balance. A very sub par beer."
"By itself, Kirin Ichiban is nothing to get excited about. In fact, its a barely average beer. Paired with sushi or Okinawan soba and its found its niche."
"unzari"
"Drinkability: I only drink this when having sushi. Otherwise, why bother? That said, I still think it pairs well with the cuisine, IMHO. Well, it doesn't compete with it, in any case. I'm still waiting on the sushi bar with a kickass beer selection."
"It pours a crystal clear golden body topped by a full and foamy bright white head that holds very well before dropping to a razor thin surface covering. It leaves next to no lace about the glass. The carbonation is quite fine, leaving thin steady streams of tiny bubbles rising steadily to the surface. Very nice appearance! The nose is limited to a ""generic"" beer aroma with some lightly grainy malt; low-level, undiscernable hops; some lager-fermentation sulphur; and a thin thread of alcohol. The body is light/medium with a gentle carbonation that's crisp in the mouth. The flavor delivers a clean and straight-forward grainy malt that's delicately touched by hop flavor but backed by a firm bitterness. A mild note of apple or dried golden fruit (pear, perhaps?) adds a hint of character to it. It finishes short and dry with a light note of residual malt and sublime hop bitteress. Refreshing!"
"Note: More than half a decade later, this review is kind of embarrassing. But it's where I was as a fledgling beer drinker, so I'll keep it for historic purposes."
"Not a pleasing beer by any means. I've had worse, but for a premium-import price the beer shouldn't taste this cheap. Those who like the flavor of Grolsch/Heineken might want to give this a try, but I wouldn't recommend this to anyone else."
"Gold color, small white head. Aroma is grainy, fruity and sweet. Light and crisp taste. Good flavor. Good balance of hops and malts. Simple clean taste. Some hoppyness and slight tingle on tongue. Finish is crisp and clean. Aftertaste is slightly bitter."
"Something is definately wrong with this beer. Poured it out of its can, into a glass...and the color was....I guess it's kinda gold, with an eye towards....green? This doesn't instill confidence. Figured it was one of those ""mythical Japanese creature"" things (Yea, I know it's brewed in L.A.). Gave it a sniff, and it smells a doctor prescribed it for a heinous infection. Took a sip. Tastes like it could give me a heinous infection. I'm not really sure this is beer. In fact, I'd be prepared to just label it a by-product of a hollywood face-lift lab. Simply a nasty, foul smelling brew."
"Pale lightish yellow with a short lsting macro head of about 15 seconds of gas. No real lace generation. The smells are understated and vaquely vegetal overall, similar to Miller High Life. Flavor is thin, straight sucrose malt countered by an aggressive carbonation and a drying but lighly metallic hop. Vapor-like mouthfeel. Not a lot here, not a disagreeable aftertaste but I can't see choosing this over others in ordinary Lager category."
"ng"
"NOt drinkable to me at all..even with sushi..I'll buy Sapporo Reserve next time."
"This brew poured a medium head of fine to medium sized white bubbles that quickly disappeared and a carbonated weak straw yellow body. It has a strong hop aroma and a fizzy hop flavor without much character. This brew is not impressive in the least and I will probably never buy another one."
"This lager poured a small white head with fine-small bubbles that quickly dissolved. There was no lacing on the sides of my glass. There was a lot of carbonation observed rising to the top. The body was gold in color. There was a bitter taste and an aftertaste observed with this lager. This lager lacked character and I was not impressed with this lager."
"Once upon a time, in a magical land far, far away I used to actually drink this stuff every once in a while, and didn't mind it that much. But I drank it iced cold and straight out of the bottle. Those days have reached the point of folklore by now. If you want a Japanese lager, this isn't it."
"Watery lager and almost like Miller light or Coors light. Clear light gold with little flavor. I've had it before in bottle and was hoping it might be marginally better on draught but no luck. Great for quenching thirst but not satisfying as a beer."
"Drinkability? Yeah, you can drink them, if you've got nothing better to do, nothing better to drink, and a mean streak of masochism..."
"Color is clear yellow with a gold quality, but a vigorous pour produced very little head or foam. Smell is thin malt and grain of rice or corn. Taste is mostly watered down malt, corn, and rice with real no flavor. Barely sweet. Feel is water, thin, weak, empty, nothing, have a glass a water with a lemon. Very sorry I even tried it. What's A-B doing in Japan anyways, ruining more of their super awesome, and very old culture? Japan gives us nothing but the best in electronics and we give em A-B. For shame."
"Well, this is nothing I will ever drink again. It could have been a lot better and just a little bit worse. I paid nothing for it, so it was not a big deal. Very little flavor, and the flavor that is there is just a bit skunky with some graininess. Special Premium Reserve. That will have me laughing for ages."
"Can't say I expected much out of this beer and it held up to that expectation. It poured very clear and golden with a very thin and quickly dissapating head. The smell was entirely pedestrian, almost like Budweiser. On contact, it has a sort of cereal taste and texture to it. I'm also noticing a little bit of a floral background. It finishes bitterly without much taste. This is not a great beer, basically a glorified Budweiser."
"Very light golden color here with a thin white head that fades quickly. There is almost no nose here with a barely detectable malt and hop scent that would be good if it had more presence. However, this is a surprisingly well balanced flavor of beer here. The hops and malt are very good with a minimal amount of room for improvement. There is also little to no aftertaste. This is not a great beer - but it will do."
"Not a bad effort. The luxurious single wort (or first press) process yields a unique, complex flavor. With this gold label and ""Special Premium Reserve"" appellation, Ichiban outclasses and outperforms other japanese beers. 4.95% alcohol by volume. Don't be fooled -- this is a great beer that goes with anything especially sushi."
"Kirin Ichiban is Japanese for, dont ****ing bother with this beer."
"This was my first Asian beer and I was not impressed. Golden yellow in color with a small white head that didn't last. Smelled like wet, dirty corn. The flavor, what little there is, was metallic. I might have tasted a hint of hops in the end but I was probably digging. Overall, don't bother. Blah, no flavor."
"Golden color, light in everyway. Thin taste, thin body, thin aroma. What little aroma it has, it just smells like beer. I guess saying that this has a malt dominated nose is a more flattering way to say that, but with something as devoid of character as this, I would never think to flatter this beer. As the previous advocate, so correctly described this beer as One Dimensional. I would also say this beer is exceedingly boring, which is how most Japanese brews are. There is however a pleasant bitterness to this beer which is why I am giving this beer such a high rating depsite its defects."
"The beer has the typical lager/pils color, a cloudless golden straw, with a pertinent white head and adequate lace. Malt dominates the nose, the start lightly sweet, the top skinny in feel, with a bitingly acidic finish, the hops detectable, dry aftertaste. Is it me or all these beers ""One Dimensional", I've tasted dozens of Pacific Rim Beers, and the only difference is the label, or is it that I'm and ""Anti-Lager"" Snob?"
"Pours a medium gold with a small head that resembles dishwashing soap lather.  Lots of fat bubbles rise to the surface quickly but fail to sustain the head, although the lace is decent.  A striking resemblance to Budweiser, as others have noted.  Aroma is mildly skunky and sulphurous, with cooked vegetables as well.  Taste begins with a lot of carbonation sting and a little malt, turns slightly sweet towards the middle.  Finish is rather bitter, but the bitterness seems contrived and artificial.  In all fairness, this beer is not awful, but is lacking in character.  Packaged in a 22-ounce can, shelved with and probably competing against malt liquors."
"The taste is really not that bad.....Not sure....the aroma maybe clouding my judgement."
"The draught version was better, which isn't really saying much. Tastes like what it is, A-B's version of an Asian lager. Stale and bitter flavor. Very little body or texture. Blah."
"Brewed by Bud, and guess what taste like Bud. This is not a dry beer, it leaves an aftertaste on your tongue that you will try to scrap off. This beer taste like it smells, so do yourself a favor smell it first, I'm sure you will go no further. Wish I could say more on the flavor characteristics, but I don't know what the hell they were."
"Well when a friend brought this over my house, I said Wow a japanese beer that I have never tasted before.  While reading the label I see ""brewed under the strict supervision of Kirins brewmaster by Anheuser-Busch, Inc.""  I said what the hell, oh well I will give it a shot.  Pourd a non-existent head that leaves a nice lace behind.  The light color leads me to understand the brewer.  The taste is like a high-end Bud.  No hops and very little malt.  Not a very good choice on my friends part but I will allow him back in house with a different kind of beer."
"I ordered this beer in a Japanese Tebanyaki Steak house.  I figured I would have a Japanese beer (I didn't know until I read the label it was brewed by AB).  I was disappointed by this beer.  It was pale in color (looked like a macro) and just didn't have much flavor.  It did remind me a little of other imported lager's like Heineken or Amstel, but it's not quite on their level (and that's not saying much).  I did however enjoy the meal so much that it didn't even matter that I had an uninteristing beer, and in fact it did go well with the meal (in that it knew better than to get in the way!)."
"Made me want to ralph"
"Skunky smells.  Tasted like a macro with something amiss.  Ended up pouring the beer down the drain after a quarter of a glass.  The bottle very well may have gone bad.  Will re-evaluate."
"Free leftovers.....This reminded me alot of the ol Michelob light, which I used to drink, before I saw the light at the end of the beer aisle. Pale yellow straw color, with some light head. Nothing real outstanding on the nose. Taste was thin, not much, very thin and watery. Some crispness to it, but mostly watered down malt flavors. The first of the Japanese beers, I have had. Although I was probably prejudiced, since it is owned by AB."
"Not as good as Sapporo.  I thought the waiter had brought me a Bud light.  But no, it was better.  As I ate tons of spicey dishes, this beer seemed to dissapear, leaving just enough alcohol behind to cool down the heat."
"I think this is supposed to be a premium version of Kirin lager.  I didn't try them side-by-side, but I'm not sure I could tell any difference."
