"Anyone rating this beer poorly clearly missed the ""american lager"" labeling on the bottle. This is supposed to take like a macro adjunct and I think it's a fantastic take. Puts yuengling to shame."

"Pours to a generous head and pale gold color. Aroma is ....tbc"

"Bottle of Guinness blonde drank."

"12 oz into a pint glass.  Clear golden-orange with thickish head upon vigorous pour.  Quick fade to virtually nothing.  No visible carbonation.  Not much on the nose, a bit bready.  Tastes bready, sweet with hints of diacetyl and apple juice.  Mild hops finish.  Feel is water, slightly crisp.  Overall: OK, not bad but not especially good either.  Would not seek out again, especially at a ""premium beer"" price."

"not a beer judgment as much as a palate preference"
"I think this is geared for the Budweiser crowd in Ireland. As such, it succeeds. I will not, however, order this again."
"Enjoyable and easy taste for those not into über hoppy IPAs and not light.  A good happy-medium"

"This was an interesting beer which had a lot of complexity going on. Lots of different flavors and aromas and such. However, I don't really know if it all meshed together great. It wasn't a bad brew, just seems like nothing particularly impressive."
""
""
"Overall: Not bad. Typical american style lager."
""
""
"Just a hint of Mosaic, nothing special."
"Served in a Pilsner glass"

"Appearance has a golden orange color supporting a healthy head leaving nill lace.  Smells like an American lager with corn and adjunct grains.  Taste has a fuller flavor than traditional American lagers leaving it a bit smoother in the end.  Mouthfeel is light with good carbonation.  This was originally $10.99/sixer, but got it for $7.77 and glad I did, what makes them think it's worth $10.99 I don't know."
"For something that I thought would be terrible, I am pleasantly surprised."
"Nice smooth lager from Guiness."
"Overall : I think at what they were aiming for was a big miss, but I love yeasty beers so I'm gonna give this one a thumbs up and probably buy more."
""
"Not a bland lager. Just the right amount of hops for both flavor and aroma"
""
""
""
""
""
"I was pleasantly surprised by this one. I have not been a huge fan, but like the straw ruby color, crisp aroma from the Mosaic and Willamette, which leaves a nice bite. The taste and mouth feel are really dry, giving fresh life to the Guiness tradition."
""
""
"I actually think this tastes like an upscale version of Pabst, which can also have this pungent bite on the finish- a lager with some flavor.  Overall, this is interesting enough to merit a try."

"Probably my favorite among the lager family. It definitely has a crisp taste and would go well with summer weather. And since I'm not much of a stout guy this is a great Guiness alternative but not the classic. Worth trying just for the heck of it!"
"How can anyone say this taste good? The beer taste like chalk with some sort of flavor. Just disgusting, no doubt about that."
""
""
"Obviously, I don't like it. I'll stick to my Foreign Extra Stout."
""
"I enjoyed this one, very good."

"Great beer to be honest"

"Aftertaste is identical to semi sweet iced tea with lemon. Not a bad drink."
"After popping the Discovery Series cap it pours in to a proper Guinness pint glass, forming a 2-finger head of cream colored foam. The beer has a striking golden/orange hue with impressive clarity. Fantastic staying power on the lumpy, sudsy foam. Pale malts, biscuit and light citric hop scents greet the nose. Hints of berry sweetness and a bit of buttery diacetyl are also present in the aroma. The flavor is... odd. Surprising. It's a strange blend of malty cracker goodness with a bizarre, unique quality. Perhaps from their traditional Guinness yeast strain. It's a little funky, but compelling. The finish is mildly bitter, with a faint lemon citrus and traces of earthy, minty hops. Somewhat incongruous, but distinct. The body of the beer is moderate, with assertive carbonation that lends a creamy effect. This one is a bit of an enigma. It's like stripping a Guinness stout to the bones to accentuate the unique flavors that the yeast imparts. I found this one oddly appealing."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The Mosaic hops certainly shine through in the aroma. The combination of Mosaic and Willamette hops also give this beer a strong finishing bitterness. The malt character is pretty subdued although one can readily detect some nice toasted grain flavors. Perhaps a bit too dry in some respects, but not a bad choice if one wants to take a walk down the lager pathway."
"I've always hated Guinness.  I was in a Kroger so there weren't a lot of options for good beer, so I decided I'd give this a try because I was in the mood for just a drinkable Lager.  When I poured it, there was virtually no head on the beer.  However when I took a swig, I was extremely surprised.  Carbonation is great, it basically tastes like a decent nondescript lager.  Just your normal caramelly/malty taste.  For a drinkable beer that you can sit there and enjoy a 6-pack, it's great.  Mouth feel is exactly what I want, nice and crisp with very little aftertaste."
""
""
""
"Pours a clear, deep gold producing 1.5 fingers of a shortlived, foamy & pillow, white head that recedes to a nice surface layer & collar ring leaving only a few wisps & motes of lace above the collar. Aroma is cracker/biscuit, graham crackers & floral hops. Taste is lager malt, cracker/biscuit, sweet, honey & vanilla hints, predominantly leafy, grassy hops producing a bittersweet finish & a somewhat balanced aftertaste. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, moderate carbonation, crisp, clean & smooth."
""
""
""
""
""
"Very standard lager. Nothing amazing or unique. Exactly what you'd expect from Guiness' attempt at an American beer"
""
""
""
""
""
"The way an American beer SHOULD be brewed"

"Not that good, front taste is not there after taste not horrible but not good."

"Very enjoyable pale lager with super smooth drinkability.  I actually enjoy this more than their stout although the appearance & aroma scores wont contribute to giving this a higher score than its worth."
"Good, lite, summer on the deck, drinkable brew. Not a regular in my frig."
"Its alright to me..  could drink it again."
""
""
""
"It's crisp but too fluffy, definitely a little too much spritz to the light body.  It could use a little cleaning up in the finish, too.  Not bad though."
""
""
""
"It's an okay brew.   Nice head of about one-half inch that dissipates slowly.  The taste is rather full bodied and very drinkable to me.  Overall, I might buy another six pack from time to time.  If it was cheaper, I might actually make it my lawnmower beer."
"No wow factor, but easy to drink.  Had it on tap which may have helped it."
"Recommended by a friend, not too shabby"
"Personally one of my favorite lagers. Smooth and creamy with that slight distinct Guinness taste. Very bready undertones."
"Overall: pretty drinkable, and there's none of the lingering chemical aftertaste that you  might expect of a lager made by a giant brewery.  I could see putting down a lot of these in the right setting."
""
"Good tasting beer. Went down smooth. Something different from my normal intake of IPA's. I'd buy it again."

"Very enjoyable and a huge surprise."
"Guinness Blonde American Lager brewed by  Guinness Ltd., with an ABV of 5.0% This brew pours out a deep amber color, with a nice white head. The smell is rich with grains, malts and some hops. Now for the taste, it is rich with flavor.  You pick up malts and grains in this brew.  It tastes like a lager. There is nothing overpowering in this brew, it has a nice balance to it.  Guinness Blonde American Lager has a nice drinking brew. The mouthfeel is nice and clean.  This is my kind of beer.  Overall I'm giving  Guinness Blonde American Lager a solid 4.75 out of 5. Guinness Ltd., did a nice job with this one. I would buy this brew again."
"Just as awful as the Black Lager. No taste, no smell, absolutely dreadful."
""
""
"You know, I was quite impressed. Didn't knock my socks off, but wasn't bad at all. Pretty spicy as a bit more complex than the adjuncts of course, but there are better American Lagers available."
"Waste of time and effort."
""
"Guinness Blond was a surprising beer.  I expected something much lighter.  Good color, and pretty good flavor.  Not a bad attempt at trying to make a good American lager."
""
""
""
"Exceptionaly drinkable, very smooth and light"
"Not bad for first try"
""
"Just an  ok beer. Nothing Special"
""
""
""
"Lager"
"Not impressed with this attempt at an ""American"" brew"
"This one wasn't much more than an average low end beer that we already get in America. In fact, it was disappointing that it is part of the Guinness family of beers. Had to try it at least once and once was enough for me."
"Just an incredibly boring offering. Not sure why this was necessary"
""
"Boring. Mixed this in with a ""Brewmaster"" six pack. Last of the six tried, sucked. Wouldn't buy again. Zero lacing, minimal head, no flavor or scent. Meh at best."
""
"Kind of ""meh"" overall.  Drinkable, not terrible, not great.  Not much aroma or flavor, but no real off notes either.  Light, dry finish."
"An American style lager more than a blonde. No bitterness, no lacing on the glass, and very little taste. This is the kind of beer you drink to get drunk with when playing drinking games or something. Not a beer you enjoy. Had been wanting to try it for a while out of more curiosity than anything. I should've left it on the shelf."
""
""
"I'll drink it and enjoy it if it's given to me but I doubt if I buy it again. I'll take Harp or Newcastle over Blonde"
""
"Mixed six Christmas gift from Uncle Mike."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Very smooth, very drinkable. This could be a very refreshing summer time beer!"
"O - Good mid range blonde.  Not my favorite but not my least favorite either.  Light enough to be able to drink several of these at a time.  3.5/5"
""
"This was a disappointing take on a larger from Guiness. There was really no head or flavor. I've had better mouth feel from light beers."
"Just not a good beer. Looked forward to trying this. Highly disappointed."
"Looks like a decent lager but the smell was very foul, ""puke like"" for lack of a better description. Tastes a bit better than it smells thankfully;fruit like sweetness with a thick sticky mouthfeel. Halfway through there is no head at all and it looks like apple juice. It does finish ok crisp with a touch op hops. Overall this isn't that good at all and this will be my first and last."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Did not enjoy this beer. nothing stood. Just real grainy/grassy with a minor sour aftertaste"
""
""
""
""
"Sulfer smell but otherwise a great beer. No smell of a bad adjunct."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"It is a Awesome Larger !"
"Very good taste smell and look"
"Very drinkable, smooth, without bitter hoppy aftertaste."
""
"Mosaic? My reason for the low score is mainly due to the marketing ploy claiming this beer is hopped up with Mosaic and Willamette. It tastes like an average adjunct for the price of quality craft. If I'm in the mood for an average lager I'll grab a 12 pack of Bud for the price of this 6. Disappointing."
""
""
"Poured a nice blonde, could just taste the hops, just.  Could be a littler hoppier.  Crisp with some back bite.  Overall I could drink several of these at one go."
""
"Overall – A pretty standard lager overall.  Pretty crisp and refreshing, but by no means a flavor powerhouse.  Just a decent brew overall."
""
""
"Overall: I really wanted to love this beer, but it's just a mess. On the other hand, Guinness stout is a mess as well, but we've learned to love its quirkiness. Shifting gears, given the sweetness of it, and the 'implied' caramel that it has, I fear that this might be intended to go up against Yuengling's Traditional Lager. Well I'm not a fan, but I'd take that over this any day of the year. Thumbs down."

"Pours a nice light amber/rich golden color. Has a strange sour or hopp aroma that I can't quite put my finger on  and it slightly affects taste. I like the dry hippy finish though. I like it. about what I expected and maybe a little more. They should figure that smell out though."
""

"Interesting beer. Has all the appearance of a good American lager. Tastes bad and smells even worse. Has a sour taste and smell. I would put it below a PBR...really! Now I have to figure out what to do with the other five in my fridge."
""
""
""
""
""
"I thought this beer was terrible. Sour off taste that was just not good. I will not ever buy this beer again that's for sure. The beer poured a nice head and was frothy. But the head dropped really fast. Beer smelled sour also. A horrible product from Guinness."
""
"This beer is what I expected it to be.  Was impressed with the look of the beer, but the aroma is not pleasant.  Taste was OK - better than a bud or coors, but barely.  The two finger head calms down to a film of foam that retains through the glass.  The color is sunset yellow or golden."

"Grainy, with floral and savory hop character and a lightly bitter finish."

"From a 12 oz. bottle into a standard pint glass. Pours a tarnished gold with a white 1-2 finger head. Plenty of nice carbonation with bubbles rising from the bottom of the glass. The aroma is predominantly sweet with fruity sour Belgian yeast a hint of banana bread and grass. Nicely crisp up front with the American hops providing a short burst before yielding to more Belgian sweetness. That's pretty much all there is to speak of as the beer takes on a very standard lager personality with a semi-dry finish. I''m not a lager aficionado, but this is definitely drinkable and certainly not offensive. I would say that it is superior to Full Sail Session Lager and also to Budweiser."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall an OK beer but the Black Lager is better."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"It's not a bad beer, it's just an average forgettable beer. This is what you give to people who like Bud and Miller but want to act like they are drinking something special without actually having to do so. Very pedestrian."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A decent take on an American style light lager. Nice notes of biscuit and caramel."
""
""
""
"I expected to find the classic Guinness in there somewhere but no.  *thinking*  ... Nope.. nothing.  Still, it was definitely unique and enjoyable enough. Refreshingly crisp, mainly bitter with a faint tail of hops.  I've found it to be quite nice when paired with spicy foods."
""
""
"Tart lager clear clean finish"
""
""
"I feel like Blonde Ales are usual non-offensive beers with not much going on. Holds true to this one, easy to drink, non offensive, but probably won't knock your socks off. I could see this being the best option at a place with a sub-par beer list, glad I tried it so I know its a good option."

"Different than what I've had. Taste is in the name. Guinness but blonde."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Tastes a lot like Budweiser but with a chemical backend taste that's not so pleasant. Drank one and gave the rest away."

"Balanced, Hoppy lager.... great on draught"
"i was drawn by the sale price and the fact they advertised a lager with mosaic and willamette hops.  pours a light coppery tone with a persistent white head; very long retention on that part.  aroma is fruity - much more in line with british pale ale, with notes of toffee and cereal grains; not very lager-like to me.  the bottle mentions they use guinness ale yeast, so is it even lagered?  i've had single-hop mosaic beers before, and i don't remember these characteristics.  mid palate is syrupy, and then finishes with a bitter quality that does not mesh with the attack.  all in all, much more of a blonde ale than an american pale lager.  regret the six pack, as i'm not really drawn to this one.  i've had worse, but i don't want to drink another."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: a very good lager, not outstanding, but nothing bad about it either."

"Guiness should stick to what they know best, Irish stouts and draught, not American lagers. I had one and wouldn't recomend it to anyone"
""
""
""
"If this is No. 1 in the Discovery Series, they need to step up a bit closer to the plate for the next one."
"1st one, great! second one tasted like yeasty straw with a vanilla? aftertaste. I think Shiner makes a better product from Tx. BTW Red Stripe is brewed in Latrobe too, shame on Arnie."
"Overall it lacks a good aroma and a balanced flavor profile."
""
""
"Tried it once. It wasnt what i expected. Good to sip on"
""
""

"Taste-Pale malt, subtle fruity hop note. Quaffable, decent lager offering."
""
""
""
""
""
"This is by far one of the better lagers I have had in quite some time.  It definitely is a gorgeous looking beer in the pint glass - a perfect, dark golden color that is so appealing to the eyes.  It had a better than average scent - not your typical lager smell.  Feel-wise was good as well, not too carbonated.  I enjoyed the rich, more flavorful (i.e., not so watery tasting) lager.  Overall, I found this to be your better than average lager - a great offering from Guinness."

""
""
""
""

"Clear golden color with a tight white head. Very grainy/bready aroma. Oh god but the taste is putrid. a little like sour dough with a splash of misused hops gives off this clashing of american citric bite and acidity. Drinkable but not good at all. After taste is has some mild pleasantness with some lingering fruity hop flavor and bread crust but the two don't sync up at any point."
"Just an OK everyday drinking beer. Tastes more like a honey amber ale than a crisp American Lager."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, if anyone out there likes this and wants a few free beers hit me up.  This will be in my fridge for a long time, and not in a good way."

"O: Doesn't feel or taste like a lager, seems like it is an ale in construction. There is nothing very exciting about this beer and the body/mouthfeel is a touch too much for the style. I wish there was a slightly more pronounced hop flavor and aroma and a cleaner mouthfeel."
"Typical lager taste with a curious after funk. Do not want to have again."
"Horrible. As good as Guinness has been on their other beers, they went horribly wrong with this. It almost has no taste, and what taste it has is horrible. I will NEVER drink this again."
""
""
""
"Pours with a thin sticky head, almost insignificant. Aroma is faint, mostly grain with little to no hops. Taste is a little too sweet and it lacks the crispness that I look for in a good lager. Hops are really subdued as the flavor is mostly grain with a honey like sweetness. Doesn't live up to all the hype that Guinness has been giving this brew. My curiosity has been satisfied and I won't be buying this one again, there's much better lagers out there."
"Full disclosure, I tried one of the taste batches for this beer. It was a lot more drinkable and a lot cleaner with more of a pronounced Mosaic hop flavor. This simply tastes like an Amber Ale with a smidgen of hop flavor does not come across well at all IMO. Bring this one back to the drawning board ... the potential is there, was there, and they should not be afraid to make a bold statement in the US market."
""
""
""
""
""
"tasted similar to an IPA not iimpressed, I won't buy another"

"Pours a golden color with a fizzy head that does not trail the glass. The smell was very faint. The taste was mostly grain with a little bit of hops on the end. I was a bit disappointed and found the beer to be bland and forgettable."
""
"O: nothing about this beer makes me want to try it again;"
"Overall, what's the point of a discovery series this bad.  For the record I love well made lagers!!!"
""
"The bartender said it's called an American blonde lager because they decided to use American malts and hops, even though they kept their European lager yeast.  It's de4cent."
"OVERALL:  I Enjoyed and would Recommend this Quality Lager"
""
""
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a dark golden color with a 1 inch head. Smell is of honey, some grains. Taste is clean, malts, some honey sweetness, a bit of grains, highly refreshing. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a smooth session beer."
""
""
""
"Overall: Guinness took a decent shot at the American Lager style. They could have done better, but also a lot worse. The inclusion of mosaic hops was interesting, and adds a unique spin on the beer that isn't too gimmicky. Guinness Blonde is at least worth a try.  With that said, there are other American lagers I would prefer in this price range."

"This is an enjoyable, easy-drinking brew.  Within style, it's a good beer!"

"go figure, guinness makes a blonde american lager, so many things wrong with that if you are a traditionalist, but i guess they need something to compete with the other macros and crappy imports, read heineken and stella. the packaging says there is mosaic hops in here, which really has me curious, didnt know supply andprice point worked for such a big brand with that varietal, but apparently it does. not much of that new zealand fruitiness to the hops though, i can only barley get the mosaic in the nose. the beer is a shade darker than its new rivals, not yellow but brassy golden, and it has a lot of body too compared to those, which makes it better than them for me. its got some hops in the finish, but mostly bitterness, and a salted buttery cracker malt base that actually tastes like something other than adjuncts. frothy feel too, with expressive carbonation and a longer finish. in the context of what its competing against, i think its a great success actually. in the context of craft lager though, no, its not real great. for a macro i think it has every reason to do well."
""
""
"I was expecting this to suck but it's surprisingly, very good.  Solid malt character. Can't detect any adjuncts.  Leafy hop character. Excellent balance. Light to medium body. Very well carbonated.  Crisp finish. Drinks exactly to way any quality lager should. Well done."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A little tasty, goes down ok, not too filling, mild kick, decent representation of style, there are definitely several choices better than this beer."

"Poured into a Pint glass from a 12oz bottle showed an awesome 2 finger dense Snow White head sitting atop a beautiful Copper Golden clear brew, sweet malt smell hits the nose and is followed in the taste very well. What starts out with malty sweetness and a smooth and refreshing middle ends with a slight and welcomed bitter, this is a very drinkable and tasty beer that supports the style and is a solid brew overall. I for one like to explore all the styles and new offerings with an open mind and won't be swayed by the popular vote...I like what I like and rate it as how true to the style a beer is and my take on the taste of the beer....as true as I can be...this is a winner."
""
""
""
""
""
"Deep golden color with a huge frothy white head. Sweet bready caramel malt aromas with a fleeting hint of floral hops. Bready caramel faint spicy hop flavor. Meh, not bad I could take it of leave it."
""
""
"O: I don't know... took me a bit to peg it but, going sheerly on faint memories, this tastes like a fairly bitter-er,  Lion's Head lager(?)... did they bitter with Mosaic here?!... what exactly were they going for?... 'rich and delicious' does not adequately describe this... I'd honestly, each and every time, prefer PBR or Piels over this"
""
""
""
""
"O - I was hoping the Mosaic hops were going to shine through more, so that was a bit disappointing. It did meet expectations, however. I don't think I'd buy this particular one again, but I do plan on trying all of the beers from the  Discovery Series."
""
""

""
""
"3.71/5.00"
"Aroma is citrus, earth and mild/medium sweetness.  The flavor is citrus, fruit, mild sweetness/malts, a hint of tropical fruit and a mix of very slight heat and tart in the finish."
"Pours a pretty amber in color with about a 1/2 finger of a off-white thick creamy head that settles down fairly quick to just a very thin layering mostly on the sides of the glass. Some spotty lacing is seen but not much. The aroma is of hops and yeast for the most part. The taste is more complex with some light fruit in there as well. Really didn't go down all that easy and there was a bitter aftertaste that lasted a bit more for my liking. Really not my style."
""
""
""
"3.5/5: It could have sucked...but it just doesn't"
""
""
"Pretty much 'meh' as far as the eye can see on this one. It's nice to see them trying something new here, but it compromises too much. Thin, light, unimpressive. Rushed aroma on the nose like a cheap lager. Flavor is... flat-chested. Mouthfeel is open and drinkable, perhaps the best feature."
""
""
""
""
"It's a beautiful copper colored beer with that classic foamy meringue colored head. When I stick my nose in it, I get sweet aromas, and fruity ones such as pear. I take a sip, and sweet malts play their part with that fruity pear taste in the finish, as well as some grassy notes. It goes down the hatch like a cheap adjunct -- watery. I'm neither offended or impressed by this. Keep in mind I reviewed this after drinking a Ten Fidy, so I can't wait to revisit this beer with a clean palate. Ha!"
