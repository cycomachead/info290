"Kenzinger, a nice beer when your having more than 10. Phila. Brewing Co. has a wide variety of beer. And if you stop in make your own case for only 27$$. From unfiltered Walt Wit to Newbold IPA to Kenzinger lager, something for all."
"A very average beer overall."
"An enjoyable beer."

"I cannot find this anywhere outside of the city limits of Philadelphia, and thus, get at least one when in the city."

"This is a great everday drinking beer.  It is very crisp, refreshing, full bodied and hoppy.  I really call this my perfect go to beer.  I can bring a case of this anywhere and it seems to please all beer drinkers alike.  It is always bright and fresh and beats drinking cheap domestic brews from the brewing GIANTS.   It has a certain bite to it that I find to be delicious.  I will always back this beer!"

"It's definitely an American take on lager rather than a traditional one, but if you want a light, crisp, hoppy lager, this is a good way to go. This is the beer Budweiser should be."

"O: This beer is easy to drink but doesn't seem to be a good representation of the style—the malts do not taste like those in a German helles."
"O: This one does not really fit well into any specific style but it is an interesting beer to try - I did not love it but I didn't hate it either. Pretty easy to drink and sessionable but not super interesting."

"Pale yellow in color with perfect clarity. Poured with a short white foam that quickly reduced to a soapy cap. Bready, biscuity aromas with light floral hop and earthy, grassy notes at the end. On the lighter side of medium bodied with crisp carbination. Flavor is similar with bready, biscuity malt up front with floral hop flavor through the middle to the end. Finishes clean and crisp with a tangy floral hop bite followed by a bready, maltiness."

"An easy but not too ordinary drink. One can easily enjoy more than one of those on a warm summer evening."

"Good job by Phila. Brewing co. but maybe some fine tuning in what it's being marketed as."
""
""
""
""
"Like I said, this is what I give to people looking to try something new with only experience in Miller/Coors/Bud/Keystone/whatever or Yuengling lager. It does its job, plus it keeps me satisfied on the cheap in quite a few bars."

"O: Good bitter beer. Also, decently affordable. Before this I wasn't familiar with the boys at the Philadelphia Brewing Company. After this I think I'll get friendly with some of their other brews. It's a nice balance of bitter and savory, enough to interest a seasoned beer drinker, drinkable enough not to drive away an amateur."

"o - Overall a decent better, though the nose has nothing going on. The taste is nice and it is easy to drink; worth checking out once if you're in the mood for a kolsch."

" Light body, taste starts out slightly grass, citrus, hop bitterness, then turns sort of dry with a bit of a tart finish. Overall a good easy to drink beer."

"12oz. bottle: This one pours a clear, golden yellow color. There was a bit of a white head on it that didn’t leave much lacing. Bit of a hoppy nose to it. Slight citrus and floral notes. The taste is pretty decent. A bit of malts, some bitterness, and a fairly clean, crisp taste. Very nice on a hot day. Worth haveing again."
"Quite a staple beer here in Philly the last 5+ years. Pours a clear gold with fluffy white head. Smells of noble hops, mostly a delicate floral. Some sweet tasting malt character. Tastes light & refreshing with a nice crisp hop bite. A tad too sweet to be an excellently rounded beer but the eveness is mostly there. A great session beer clocking in at only 4.5% ABV. Surprised to see this classified as a Kolsch. Always figured it was a hoppy pale ale. Overall, a solid contender in the the ""everyday beer"" category."
"A good drinkin' beer. As stated above, its too bitter for the style, but I like it. Actually, it's probably my favorite kolsch ever."
"D- This was a fine example of an IPA; it is surely not a Kolsch, pilsner, or even a lager. Not what I was wanting or expecting."
"I didn't love this one when I thought that it was some sort of over-hopped pilsner. When I learned that a Kolsch sort of over0hopped pilsner, it is fair to say I might have liked it a little bit less. Not a horrible beer, but not something that I would really want another glass of either."
"overall; not really a bad beer but the balance is all wrong for the style."
"Notes: A Micro-Macro lager. Nothing to write home about but I won't pour it down the drain either."
"A tasty, inexpensive blonde ale, but not the best that PBC has to offer. Poured a clear golden-yellow with a small but lace-friendly white head. Grains and floral hops in the nose. Similar taste with light floral hops, lightly toasted grains, pale malts, grass, and a bit of lemon zest. Light body, and easily drinkable. And usually cheap."
"Taste mirrors the aroma: freshly dried grains, slight citrusy hop presence. Very light, very carbonated, semi dry on the mouth...definitely a decent beer, doesn't do anything groundbreaking, but doesn't disappoint."
"Overall, Kenzinger is one of my favorite local beers. It's the perfect craft alternative to your run of the mill backyard beer. I find myself wanting it as soon as the weather in the City of Brotherly love turns warmers."
"Medium body, higher carbonation, tingly and a bit dry. Drinkable and refreshing, alright for a happy hour beer or something during a baseball game, but nothing I'd go out and buy often."
"HV"
"Exceptionally drinkable, I'll drink this a go to brew any day and all day."
"Pours brings a golden-colored, transparent beer with a bit of spotty lacing. No real visible carbonation. Nose brings forward a pretty strong grainy presence along with a slight amount of Noble hops, though not enough of the latter to really call this a pilsner. The flavor is mildly fruit with a bit of grain and some mild Noble hops. Fairly chewy, though still a bit light. Carbonation is moderate, though it seems like it should be a bit higher. Light body. Drinks pretty well overall. My guess is either a kolsch or a Munich Helles. Going with the former given the fruitiness and lack of true ""bready"" flavor."
"Comes to me looking the part with a pale golden color that's a bit yellowish on the sides. Not much of a cap off of the spout and once it reached me there was nothing, not a very good looker, no cling. Scents include pale malt heavy, some faint apple and well, thats it. Taste is laid back, if this is a kolsch, it's not a very good one. I remember thinking this was a biere de garde, but I could be wrong. Pale malt without the sweet caramel and light apple juice like tastes, nothing in terms of hop flavor, just a small earthiness. Feel is a step above light and not very carby, this just goes down kinda dead like, bottles seem to be a bit livlier. This is not a beer that i'll be getting alot. I remember getting a mixed case of fresh PBC beer and drank one of these than gave the rest of the five bottles to the cooler at a party to try to get rid of them."
"Overall I didn't think this was crisp enough to be a traditional kolsch but it was still a fairly drinkable beer. Not worth seeking out but a decent beer that's worth a shot if you see it around."
"d- refreshing, but the best kolsch but it's drinkable."
"A careful pour still produced a large and foamy head. Retention and lacing are top notch. Color is pale yellow. Smell is different for a kolsch. More of a corn smell than anything else. Taste is bitter and a little dry. Some corn husk, lemon zest and grassy hops. Mouthfeel is fluid but there is certainly some weight on the tongue. Doesn't seem like a traditional kolsch and isn't really my thing."
"D. Ok for a hot night, but I was disappointed that the waiter at an upscale restaurant would recommend this. Someone trying to convert from macros to micros might find this a step in the right direction (albeit a small one)."
"I wouldn't go so far to say it finishes as crisp as say a Gaffel. A heavier feel takes it just beyond the realm of being ""refreshing"" as well. It's still quite tasty and easy to drink. Good job! Now fix your other beers, because them prices be right."
"I got the best mix of brews to session with this weekend ranging from the four brews from PBA found in the Burgh right now to some Southampton Keller Pils and Sierra Nevada Kellerweiss and Summerfest in the DBF. Appears a slightly hazed golden hue in the body with fine haziness suspended in the glass, full on thicket of bright white head forms nicely. Lacing is sporadic on my hop tulip pint glass from Sierra Nevada, aroma has a slight metallic hint to it with a nice mellow citrus playful malt and hop ratio. Flavor has a nice zesty citric hop mix going with some light toasted malts it has a light IPA flavor going on with the massive amounts of alpha acids from American hop additions. Mouthfeel is dry in the finish a nice unrelenting hop bitterness in a lighter styled brew, carbonation is sturdy even a bit much at times overall feel is a solidly dry hoppy finish that brings the hop burps cooking. Drinkability overall just due to the flavors provided and enjoyment of the product is very high. Add the sessionability to your drinkable score and this one rises substantially."
"M/D - Light mouthfeel, really easy to drink."
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a cloudy golden color with a 1.5 inch head. I drank 3 of these in each had a large head despite a careful pour. Smell is mild, some hops. Taste is crisp, well balanced malts and hops. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and has good drinkability. Overall this is a good quality beer."
"D - high drinkability, typical of a lager"
"It fiills the mouth just fine, but I am going to ding the drinkability for the overhopping. It really does detract--excessive hops, that is."
"-D- Not bad but not my favorite."
"A: Thick and dense head with lots of sticky lacing, a medium gold color - 4.00, S: Quite earthy aroma, dry and somewhat medicinal - 3.00, T: Quite tart and extremely citrusy, without a date on the bottle it is hard to know whether this beer's flavor profile is being accurately reflected or if this particular bottle is old, but after reading a few other reviews the characteristics that I am picking up seem consistent with other reviewers, a little on the dry side and with a slight hop bite - 2.25, M: 2.75, D: As far as Kolsh's go Kenzinger seems to miss the mark, the lemony flavors are somewhat off-putting, it is unlikely I would buy this particular beer again - 2.00"
"D- Not the best Kolsch I've ever had, but an interesting take on the style."
"D) Just average, not much more to it."
"Good to style. Really enjoy this one."
"Pours a clear, bright golden yellow. Fluffy white head, retention good, minimal lacing. Smell is of freshly dried grains and a hint of lemony citrus. Taste is of freshly dried grains, slight citrusy hop presence. Very light, very carbonated, semi dry. Decent light beer, doesnt do anything wrong which makes it stand slightly above light BMC products."
"D: A pretty solid Kolsch here. Flavors are clean, crisp, and refreshing. I feel that this beer, with its faux-retro label, is probably targeted at the boho-hipster crowd to ironically appreciate, but that doesn't detract from enjoying what is a pretty tasty brew."
"D: This is a beer that you can drink over and over again."
"A 12 ounce bottle poured into my shaker glass. The kolsch appears a pale golden yellow color with an inch of fluffy bone white foam. Nose and flavor are of lightly toasted cereal grains, floral, fruity hops, citrus fruits, mild caramel. Crisp, medium body with adequate carbonation. A tasty warm weather drink."
"20 ounce drafts. Gotta love 'em. I loved this one in particular. Clear and golden honey appearance; doughy and vinous nose. Flavor is very pleasant blend on bread-dough, wheat grains and lemony citrus hops. Balanced, light-bodied, crisp carbonation and an easy drinker. It has positive characteristics of an all-malt lager, pilsener and american wheat all in one. Very enjoyable and if more Kolsh's are like this one it might just be my new favorite style!"
"Poured into a Sierra Nevada tulip a hazy yellow-orange color with a voluminous, pillowy head. I think this bottle may have been a little shaken before I opened it. There appears to be little spherical spices at the bottom of the glass... coriander? Aroma is yeasty, crisp, with some citrus and grass. Mouthfeel is a little heavy but with good carbonation despite the frothy explosion on the pour. Taste is smooth, crisp, citrus, yeast, orange, very spicy. Overall I enjoy this brew and would try it again."
"Overall-I love a good Kolsch (one of my favorite beers to brew) and this hits the mark solidly. Nice job."
"D: Really simple yet delicious. So easy to drink quite a few in a session. Highly recommend this as one of the best Kolsch beers brewed in the US."
"D: A quaffable ale, no doubt about it. The low alcohol level is a feather in its cap."
"Overall it was ok, though nothing to write home about. I dont think I would revisit this one again,"
"D- an easy session beer to pound back. A case of this would be good for the Dave show!"
"A truly sessionable beer."
"Gold with some haze and a thin cap of fizzy white bubbles. Lots of spotty lacing. Floral and lemon hops were prominent in the aroma, backed by some citrus sweetness and cereal grains. Balanced flavour. Bitterness was light, but stayed solid underneath the malt until the sweetness faded, leaving it to linger in the finish. Lemon hops up front, a bit floral, with a hint of spice. A bit biscuity and bready, but not overly so. Light bodied with ample carbonation, crisp and on the dry side. More powerful in character than I expected, this one has a solid hop presence. Quite refreshing."
"D - you could make an afternoon out of these but if you did so, I think you'd be aiming for a buzz instead of just enjoyin the beer."
"drinkability: very high. This beer had grown on me a lot. the first few timesi had it i wasn't impressed, but it is a great session beer with some unique characteristics and flavors, that come together to make this a tasty, refreshing beer. I like how this beer is the session beer at many bars in philly now, ($3 kenzingers at many places). if you like session beers, then try this one. Oh, by the way, I don't think this is much like a kolsch, except they may use a kolsch yeast, as there are some interesting and subtle flavors going on."
"Drink is very good easy to enjoy a couple of these."
"Overall, not a fan of this beer. While I've had few of this style, I am sure there are better examples out there."
"Gold colored beer with a rapidly fading head.Aroma smells like a macro.Taste is bready with some citrus and malts.I have nothing really bad to say about this.I enjoyed it but it's kind of boring and run of the mill.With that being said the beer as whole was good."
"I've this several times now as I have purchased the variety pack a few times. It's okay, but I wouldn't pursue it ."
"Drinkability: All in all, a pretty nice version of the style"
"d: Complex, full-flavored, and sessionable. This one's a winner."
"Looks like they worked some bugs out"
"Nice offering from PBC, I will definitely seek this out during the warm summer months."
"Pours a clear golden yelow color with a thin white head. Aroma and flavor are both quite bland with no noteworthy traits. Crisp and easy to swallow but nothing about the flavor stands out. Not as hoppy as advertised. Another bland and boring offering from this dissapointing brewery."
"Drinkability: An odd beer and not in a fun, quirky way. I didn't particularly care for it. Not recommended."
"From a brown 22oz bottle - Pours a cloudy light pale color with almost no head and well below average carbonation. Smells of light malts and a tad of hops in the nose. First sip is sweet with a light malt backbone. Very light bodied, lightly hopped, but not too light. Nicely carbonated."
"D: Really enjoyed this one and am envious of those who have access to this great tasting beer. Although not extreme it is a great tasting beer that I recommend."
"Poured into a pint glass from the bottle. The beer is the color of honey. A 1"" foamy white head formed. Nice lacing was left as the head subsided. Very nice lacing was left down the entire glass once I was finished. Smells sweet with hints of caramel and bread. Can taste some bitter hops and biscuity malt. Mouthfeel is medium with crisp carbonation. A very good beer."
"Drinkability: I'm fortunate to sample this less than a week after bottling... I'm blown away by this one... especially after the Newbold... complete opposite... this one does Philly proud... I wanna throw one in the freezer so I can enjoy it in a few minutes."
"The aroma was surprising: fruity, spicy, and yeast--definitely European. The aroma was my favorite part of this beer. A sharp bite from the hops attacks the palate followed by grainy malt character. Finishes with a quick flash of bitterness. There is a lingering bitterness throughout. A little different than other Kolsh beers I have had, but definitely worth trying."
"O: Overall this is a great light- to medium-bodied summer session brew, though I wish it were a tad smoother. I'm not to familiar with the Kölsch style, but this seems quite hoppy and bitter, which is thirst-quenching and quite enjoyable. Actually rather complex given the unassuming ABV and lesser-known style."
"D: Good marks as session material. A bright citrusy hop zing makes this a summer time quencher that is case worthy."
"D: It is quite drinkable. I could easily drink a few of these but there are better Kolsch-style beers around that I would go to first."
"Perfect for the summertime. A nice light body with a bitter hop kick that is just enough for this time of year."
"Clean, crisp and refreshing. A characterful session brew. A bit hoppy for the style - but I'm not complaining!"
"This is not my type of Beer but it is a good beer if you want something that has some extra power to it!"
"T: Very flavorful and full bodied for what to me is an unassuming beer given style and ABV. Bready malt body up front that has an earthy, grainy body and finishes with a slightly bitter hop taste. Very clean, creamy body with lots of carbonation. This beer is very refreshing and easy to drink. By no means exceptional, even for the style, but great to stick with for a night."
"Clear yellow brew with foam white head, holds its own. Crisp light malty aroma. A very fresh, homey flavor, minimal bitterness, lots of crispness and good flavor. Nicely balanced and very drinkable; screams session beer, immediately makes you want to grab another. Perect for summer."
"Perfect drinkability. This beer was gone before I knew it. Flavorful, yet easy on the palate."
"D: very drinkable, even with the hoppier flavor. Actually, I kind of preferred this one over most Kolsch biers. Definitely worth a try."
"This is one hell of a session beer that I need to pick up often now that I enjoy the style and the beer itself.One fine beer and thanks again PBC!"
"philadelphia brewing company's kenzinger is a decent beer for what it's worth, but doesn't really stand up next to other pale ales that are out there. seems a bit grainy, so much so that i almost felt like i could taste more malt than hops, which for me, defeats the point of it being a pale ale. could use a bit more hops to balance things out. color and aroma are good, and overall, i could drink a few of these in one sitting, but wouldn't over the choice of a better pale ale if available."
"The is as described on the website... ""a real drinkin' beer!"""
"Rich golden color, frothy head. Bright scent, slightly spicey in the nose. Taste is slighty hoppy with a nice yeast finish--very nice balance. Light in the mouth, very easy to drink. A true session brew, its easy to drink several of these without even begining to feel full from it. A perfect year round brew great for bbq in the summer or watching football when its cold outside--a good brew to get your buddies away from that other stuff they keep around if you know what I mean."
"Overall- Quite tasty and a surpise to me cause I didn't know what style this was until I started to drink and review it. A really good BBQ beer!"
"The body was on the lighter side of medium and the mouthfeel was great. For many, this will be a great beer, for me, I just didn't connect with it. My hopes sank faster than TBIO's stock!!"
"Drinkability: flavorful and very easy to drink. This is a great example of a session beer."
"Pours a clear gold with a thin white head. Nose is almost citric and sweet toned. Flavor is interesting. Definitely some complexity there. Citrus and a minor dough. Mild bitter tone. Bitter citrus cuts in on the back side. Feel has a bit of a bite on the carbonation and the liquid is good too. This is actually pretty tasty. I will admit that when I see the word ""kölsch"" I am prepared for a much milder flavor experience shall we say. This exceeded that and was pretty tasty. Well worth trying. A good intro to the PBC. I bet this would be nice on cask."
"D-This is a quality, all malt, sessionable, beer drinkers beer. I would happily have this on hand as my Bud. This beer, along with the newly revived Reading Premium, shows that you can make a beer that has flavour, low ABV and made to please even beer geeks such as myself!"
"Pours a nice deep golden color. Good carbonation. I also thought this felt similar to an American Pale Ale. Strong citrus hints and floral hops on the nose. The taste is mainly citrusy/grapfruit; biscuit; grassy flavor. This was a very stable and balanced brew and for a great price. Another good one from PBC. I really like the Row House Red...the Kenzinger is not far behind."
"D: Nothing great but nothing wrong with it. A good session beer thats worth a try. Looking forward to this brewery's other beers and this is a good start."
"Maybe the flavor could work a little harder in catching up to the aroma, but the end result is a fine first sampling from a newly labeled local brewery. The subdued flavor actually helps in making this one seriously sessionable beer. I can think of very few times when I wouldn't be fine with one of these in my hand. I'll have to make sure it happens again."
"Cheers to PBC!"
