"Very ""flat"" tasting.  Just not my thing"
""
"Overall, this is a fresh brewery for us.  They certainly advertise this brewing company across Omaha locally enough, but we are kinda happy we got a sampling chance on this visit.  We had just finished “pint night” actually at a local beer bar, and were coming back to the hotel to finish out our night in the room.  In passing the snack area of the hotel lobby we came across a beer cooler, and obviously happily selected any local beverages that required rating, including this one.  This, as we expected from the description, was a simple lager.  It had a nice drinking face to it, but the flavor just wasn’t there in full force.  To retract, the flavor and nose were there in simplicity, but didn’t make you want to drink many more of these.  Perhaps if you’re going after a non-exclusively craft audience then it’s okay, but you’re not going to sway any IPA or stout seekers with this one.  The job is done, and one can move on from there."

"Overall (4.09) : Can Lucky Bucket do no wrong? I'm starting to believe it. I'm still amazed these guys have such ""mediocre"" ratings overall... I've been drinking beer for awhile and their brews are some of the best I've had - period. This is most certainly the best pre-pro lager I've had, by a mile. You owe it to yourself to check this out."

"O - This is an average beer. Nothing to complex, but enjoyable nonetheless."
""
"Overall - Just like the mouthfeel, this beer is not bad, but not good either. It elicited a collective ""meh"" from my palate. I was not expecting much, and it lived up to the low expectation I set for it. Don't go out of your way to drink it, but its worth a try one time."

"Poured into a Nebraska Cornhuskers pint glass. Pours a nice reddish/amber color with minimal head. Takes on all of the characteristics of a good lager. Mouthfeel is just right for this style. Hint of caramel in the taste with a malty finish. A quality lager indeed. This beer has become a staple around Omaha bars/restaurants, as well as popular events such as the College World Series. A good brew to enjoy year round."

"better than the scores indicate here. an amber lager in color, with a little more depth and sweetness than most. clear copper color, short lived half inch of white head. a nose of English pale and caramel malt, slightly out of place, and of course bready fresh lager yeast. the flavor is the same, equal parts yeast and grain, im missing hops here. well structured through a clean, but big and semisweet finish. more body than the standard lager, but also a bit heavier in a bad way, filling, not sessionable as it should be. carbonation is fine, and even with a moderate metallic aftertaste, I still enjoyed this beer, sorft of a fall lager with a little more heft than the standard issue. nothing world class here, but a fine local beer from lucky bucket if you are an eastern Nebraska resident or visitor."

"Pre-Prohibition lager pours a golden color with a dissipating head. There wasn't any aroma from this beer. The taste had crisp malt undertones, with a strong overly sweet fruity, almost apple like taste. Hard to drink, and way to sweet. Overall its a very sweet and fruity like lager."

"I poured this beer into my tumbler at 45 degrees. The beer was a light amber color and poured a fair head. The beer smelled terrible like it was sour or something. Whew!. The taste was not sour but it was dry and hoppy and I did not like it at all so I will not be buying this one again."
""
"Overall: this is a nicely flavorful lager that is a serious session beer. This represents the style well."

"O: I don't generally like lagers, but this one gets my seal of approval. Consumable, interesting, and goes great with food."

"overall, pretty average, but not bad"
"Clean malty nose with light spice, and, with a deep breathe, a hint of apple underneath. Smooth and full bodied, the spice, caramel and sweetness jump out on the tongue and linger--not typical lager characteristics, but a reason why I like this one. Refreshing on a hot day--a perfect reason to drink a lager."

"Overall – A easy drinking fairly nice flavor profile makes for a decent session beer. Not bad, but nothing to go out of your way for."
"OVERALL: A solid, serviceable lager from Lucky Bucket. Drinks easily with mellow and agreeable flavor. A perfect companion for a hearty meal, this would go great with a loaded burger and fries."
""
""

"Overall, just an easy drinking lager that tastes pretty good and smells even better. For what it is, this beer does just fine as an easy to drink refresher."
"I really liked this beer it's like the lager equivalent to an American Pale Ale as far as hops flavor and bitterness just that it has a malty backbone and that clean lager yeast character to it. Beers like remind me that there is more to beer than ales and it's about time I tried my hand at brewing a lager."

"D - An honest, but uninspired attempt... Not something I would drink again nor recommend... Even at the highly accessible 4.5% ABV, I'm not sure this one is worth seeking out... The slightly odd flavor is a killer for me..."
""
""
""
"O- A pleasant beer to drink a few of. Not really a great beer in my opinion, but a nice one to have and not think too much about. Tastes great, Less filling, but for real! This a go to easy drinking beer for me. It's regularly available at the local Whole Foods."

"O- Drinkable but not memorable."
""
""
""
"This tastes nice. It's crisp and simple, but it's not quite like anything I've ever had before. It's sweet but not agressively so. Not particularly well balanced, but that's par for the style."
""
""
""
"Overall, its a good beer that I drink every once in awhile. I don't drink it a lot because I want a different taste in a beer. I like LB's IPA better."
""
"D: Never again. No way pre-prohibition beer was like this. If it were, no one would've been fighting for repeal. Gross."
""
""
"Overall - It's nothing special in terms of flavor, but at the same time, it serves its purpose as a beer and gets the job done as a light, easy to drink beer; albeit a very average beer"
"M: medium body, lots of fizz."
"A decent lager made locally.... so bonus points for that, haha. Slight aromas of malt, a white head, and a medium golden color. Mouthfeel is light which makes this beer an easy drinker. A pretty straight forward lager. Clean, crisp, and somewhat dry finish. Nothing special, but nothing to complain about."
"The beer is a dark amber color with just a wisp of foam. The aroma is caramel malt with a few off-fruity notes lingering in the shadow. This continues onto the palate where the sweetness goes awry midway through conjuring up unpleasant thoughts. The off flavors are strangely sour. These aspects are not so objectionable to make it undrinkable, but they are noticeable. The beer finishes with a whimper. Whether pre-prohibition or post-prohibition, the beer is not historic."
"Quite solid for an American Lager-a decent example of a fancy lawn mower beer if you will. I just wish that it finished a little bit crisper-as it is, it feels just a little flabby."
"Lucky Bucket Lager pours a fat head that collapses pretty quickly into a disk of foam over a slightly cloudy yellow brew. Carbonation is slow but steady, the nose lager yeast funk and sour apple notes. Flavor is mild light barley malt, starting slightly tart with the tiniest bite of hebal hop off the back. Mouthfeel is light and crisp, with a bit of the hop and barley hull coming back in the aftertaste. Altogether a pretty unassuming brew, but as with beers like New Glarus Spotted Cow and August Schell's Nordeast, it is designed to be a step above the macro lagers- a gateway for the curious drinker used to beers brewed and marketed more as bulk commodities than as a hometown brew..."
"Overall Impression: This beer was given to me as a gift, and I don’t know what it had been through or how long it took to get to me, so take that into consideration. I hope to try a fresh one someday, as this was one of the worst beers I’ve ever had. The fruity, sour, tart flavor seemed very misplaced, and it reminded me of something someone from my homebrew club to bring to a meeting and ask what’s wrong with it. I definitely do not recommend this beer based on the two bottles of it that I had."
"O: You know, this is a fine little lager; it is what it is but it's balanced and refreshing and sessionable"
"Overall: On my fourth bottle of the six pack. Perfectly drinkable and Lucky Bucket did a fair job recreating the old lager style, it certainly has the taste. But it never was that good to begin with, was it?"
"Great balance, excellent pad de deau between the factors. Ultimately satisfactory. I can drink this, that's for sure. As a non-lager-lover, I'm not ultimately going to turn to this often, but it's fine for what it is."
"O- an average lager"
"This beer pours a cloudy golden color. The head is half an inch in height, and recedes within seconds into almost no lacing. The aroma is of light caramel with hints of floral hops. For the style the aroma is rather strong. The taste is similar to the aroma, but fuller. It finishes clean with a mild pale malt taste that lingers for a few seconds then goes away. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation, and a smooth texture. Overall, this is a nice easy drinking beer. I could drink this again without complaints, but there are better beers in this style that I would choose first."
"Definitely not my favorite beer, and though it's quite drinkable, the dominating sourness just isn't my bag."
"Got a bottle from the beer of the month club. The beer pours golden in color with a little bit of haze. A head forms but retreats quickly. The smell doesn't strike me with much of anything. The taste is pretty good for a lager but for the most part it is kind of forgettable. It tastes like a pretty good lager. Not a bad thing I guess but if you are on this site you look for more. A step up from BMC but not aimed at the serious drinker."
"I got this as part of a BOTMC. I poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a SA perfect pint glass. The pour is pale yellow with a moderate white head. The aroma is non descript, hay, grass, sweet. Taste like a typicla lager, light and easy drinking. A decent all around lager."
"O: Hmm...not great. But not terrible either. I wouldn't turn it down if it was given to me but I don't think I'd buy it unless my other options were BMC stuff."
"O - I wasn't expecting too much from this beer - I figured it'd be a middle-of-the-pack lawnmower beer, but it didn't meet those expectations. Maybe I got an old beer -- I don't know since there wasn't a date on the bottle. Would not seek again."
"Clear bodied, but there is a haze. Small white head. Darker gold. Pale malt nose, biscuity. Taste is nice pale malt, light hop, fairly malty for the style. Maybe a hint of fruit. Light mouth, kinda dry. I guess a bit more malt would make it a bit better, but its certainly not bad at all. A nice summer sipper."
"O= probably fine for table beer or for a social event, I think the sourness might catch up with me after a few, though."
"Drinkability:See mouthfeel & taste. A great, straightforward brew for drinking on a summer day."
"For some reason I really like this beer and my number scores I noted earlier before sitting down to type. A bit confused with the hop profile and body of this beer. I'm gonna let this review stand and come back to it later. Only fair..."
"It's a good thing that IPA was my first offering from Lucky Bucket and not Pre-Prohibition Style Lager. My opinion of these guys is still (mostly) positive, but they'll have to impress next time out to keep it there."
"This beer finishes clean and quick. Good drinkablity."
"I suppose something good CAN come out of Nebraska. It's a pretty light copper color with light carbonation. The aroma kinda light with hops and a touch of floral. The taste is a bit light also, with some citrus, flowers, and honey. The finish is a bit tart but lessens when the glass warms up. This isn't too bad for a lager, definitely better than many of the style I've had."
"D - This is a pretty interesting pale lager. It is quite tasty and could be very sessionable."
"Lucky Bucket Pre-Prohibition Style Lager was amber in color with good clarity. It had a beige head with decent retention. The smell was light malt with a little sweetness. The taste was lightly malty with a hint of sweetness upfront and some light hop flavor with a touch of bitterness coming through towards the finish. The mouthfeel was average with a light body and light carbonation. Drinkability was about average. It is a decent lager and worth a try."
"The body is light....er, carbonation is quite crisp at the start and leaves a slight tingle through the finish. I say this is an average beer, because I wasn't the fondest of the flavor. If the flavor hits the spot for someone else, it may be very enjoyable."
"It hit me on the 2nd bottle that this is basically an altbier. It has that kind of sharp worcestershire taste and the same color as an altbier. If you like that style - this is a good one!"
"Pours a pale yellow with small head. Not too much lacing. The smell has a very faint grassy flavour, but very mellow. Taste was quite mellow as well. Carbonation level was pretty much on for the sytle. A pleasant enough beer, but I didn't find it a ton better than some macro lagers."
"Passable lager gotten in trade. Some malty aroma, some white head on light golden colour. A tad light mouthfeel, easy drinking. Pure example of style. A bit of hops, clean, crisp, and refreshing.Not overall exciting but that's the style, the kind of beer that was craft available in the Late Seventies."
"Ah, we pine for the days before all that Prohibitive nonsense, don't we? Just as we pine for the fjords whilst preening our lovely plumage? Yup. This guy pours every shade of auburn from a tiger eye (from the darker amber on top to a pale straw at the base, with several gradients in between) with a minor bubbly head. Imagine a close-up photo of a tiger cub's left eye (the right looks different...we think it's some sort of genetic defect...). The nose is faint, with hints of light wheat and what I struggle to perceive to be caramel. Luckily (hey, that bucket worked! Fuck that dirty ol' rabbit's foot!) the taste has more strength to it, with notes of wheat (slightly darker than in the nose), random grains, raw corn (or, as the Indians call it, maize), and a very mild bitterness. The body is quite smooth and light, with moderate carbonation and a crisp finish. Why can't more lagers be this solid? I guess we're just gonna haveta hog-tie Peabody, jack his Way-Back, and rock our way to the days before those damn early progressives caved to pressures from...whoa, curse these historian's impulses!"
"D - Easy drinking. ABV is well within sessionability. Lightly filling at times. Malting is pretty assertive, leaving a sweet finish."
"D - This is a decent session beer and a nice gateway to craft brews. There are no off flavors, but there's not much to this beer. I would recommend this to a friend that isn't into craft beer, but not to a veteran."
"Overall, I'm very impressed for this first offering from this upstart brewery. A little history.... the brewery was started by the former brewmaster of Upstream brewery... a local brewpub. Zach, the head brewmaster here has his masters in brewing, and has hit the ball out of the park! VERY NICE ZACH! Can't wait to see what's next!"
"Picked this up because it is local; brewed in Nebraska. Interesting style choice for a small craft brewer, I guess they were trying to pull in BMC drinker, because there is not a lot here for most dedicated craft drinkers. Will I get it again? At the typical price I see it of $6.99, no. If it were cheaper, maybe if I'm in the mood to pound lagers."
"Lucky Bucket is a very drinkable beer. Goes down easy and is very refreshing. Probably something I'd prefer in the summer, but I'm impressed in December, too."
"Very drinkable. One to keep stocked in your fridge in the summer. Would be a good beer to have in cans."
"D - very drinkable, could easily have many of these at once. A good first effort from a local Nebraska brewer."
