"Light in color and very flavorful.  Smooth beer with an interesting aftertaste."
"light, golden in color. Refreshing and crisp. I would drink this on a sandy beach."
""
"Grainy and floral aroma. Flavor is grainy and floral, as well, with a bready finish. I burp sulfur. There's also some light fruity character present. Clean finish, but nondescript."

"Crisp clean flavor, slight hop bitterness on the front end, maintains its clean taste to the end.  It can sit with you and is not bad as it moves towards room temperature.  No need to pound these, the taste is worth taking your time."

""
"Fluffy head that hangs around for a bit; great lacing and legs; color of honey with a head of light khaki; taste is biscuity delicious with some very subtle bitterness at the front. Goes great with a fat Angus burger."

"great example of a lager. Very drinkable refreshing session beer. taste,smell,look..perfect example of a classic beer. this beer is great after having a stout or porter!"

"Extremely good beer. Very good balance of strength and flavors. Nice complexity without being overblown or stilted. Highly recommended."

"      Overall 3.25 is given to Bell's Lager Of The Lakes - Bell's Brewery, Inc. A very refreshing brew, I may pick this up again."
"I would buy this brew again."

"The beer pours a white bubbly head that dissipates quickly. The beer itself is a clear and pale gold color. The beer smell has a strong sweet malt smell. The smell also has yeast notes and a bit of a light hop profile that create a bitter banana smell. The beer taste is similar to the smell but that the notes are stronger and that hops are more noticeable than in the smell. The beer is very refreshing but a little sticky. The beer has a very light body and very smooth. It also has very little carbonation. Overall, a pretty good beer worth getting."

"I think this is a very underrated lager. It doesnt blow me away but it is very clean and the flavors employed balance out very smoothly. This is what summer brews should be like."
""
""
""
"Poured on tap and served in a shaker pint, the beer is a bright, crystal clear, straw gold coloring, with a sparse filmy white surface coat. Nose of toasted grains, subtle berry sweetness, and floral hops. Flavors are fruit and floral forward, with a tangy caramel nackbone, some hops resin, and subtle pine notes. Fruitier than I would have expected. Smooth, light bodied, with a tangy, sweet, berry fruit aftertaste. Smooth, slick finish."

"For what it is, it’s enjoyable. This pours a clear, light straw color. Light aroma, some bready and lemony notes. Crisply flavored with a touch of breadiness and a quick finish. Makes me burp—take that for what it’s worth—but with no nasty aftereffects."

"I am generally a fan of Bell's, so I picked up a six pack of this when I was in Chicago (the Great Lakes area, if not actually Michigan.) Just off the bat, I love the elegant label and the name. The beer is not bad at all either. It tastes crisp and clean, with a clear hop element that is refreshing, not overpowering. Not a ton of flavor but pretty tasty for a lager. Easy to drink."

"Bell's Lager Of The Lakes ---3.5/5"
""
""
""
""
"A delicious beer, though not outstanding when compared to some of Bells' better known ales. I would have liked a little less sharpness on the finish. Good as always for the sun, but a lager with enough zing for three seasons."
""
""
"o: Okay but unexceptional lager. The hint of soapiness could not have come from the glass, which was thoroughly rinsed before using, and its ongoing presence detracted from the experience."
""

"This beer was light bodied. It was refreshing, a working-outside-in-summer kind of beer. It left no residue but ended slightly dry."
""
""
""
"Full Sail's session line is much better."
"Simple and straightforward like a Lager should be. Great for summer."
""
""
""
""

"O: Well this is refreshing. Nice and easy to drink. More flavors than your typical macro lager and the flavors that are there aren't bad at all. It goes down super easy. Reminds me of back in the day when i first started drinking. I could easily crush a ton of these. /78"
"overall: If you live in Michigan, and drink shitty lagers, you are an idiot. Why buy Bud or Coors when you can get this, for cheap... what a lager is supposed to taste like, just enough flavor to be enjoyable."
""
"O: This isn't a bad beer for the style considering that adjunct-like flavors do not prominently stand out."
""

""
""
""
""

"Overall: Very drinkable and refreshing. Good Lager!"
"Aroma & Taste: Round crisp beer with moderate bitterness and an average duration. Pilsner style with some bitter hoppy notes, mixed with some toasted malt grains. Round, full beer with some earthy tones to it."
"This lager is a pale brilliant gold. It smells a lot like apples, and in fact, tastes like them too. The front of the taste is very sweet and appley, while the hops bring up the rear for a nice balance of sweet and bitter. The front of the taste almost reminds me of a white wine like a pinot grigio."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"It's a good lager for macro fans to try but doesn't inspire me. I did enjoy it but a lot of tasty options for the money. If its summer your outside doing something active, would be a choice."
""
""
""
"O-A boring run of the mill lager. Nothing stands out."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of grains and malts. Taste is crisp, lots of grains, some malts, earthy, bitter at the finish. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a good session beer, probably better enjoyed during the summer."
""
""
""
""
"Overall- not worth the price at $10 a sixer, this is as average of a beer you can get. The only plus I can give it is its easy to drink. 3"
""
""
""
"Overall: I like it, but i get too many skunky sips. its really a good tasting beer but sometimes it just goes down wrong. It shouldn't be spoiled as it was bottled a month ago and refrigerated at the store."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a fair camping/lawn mower/beach beer, but other than that, eh. Not a terrible beer, but not something that even warrants being poured into a pint glass. The smell's a bit of a turn off, but it's not too bad as a whole. Wouldn't buy a six pack, but would be a fair choice of light beer to have on a hot day in Michigan."
""
""
""
"nothing special as far as bell's goes, but as far as lagers, one of the best."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This beer is very well balanced as it does not exhibit the sweetness that you often find with the more malty beers but it is not overly hoppy or bitter either. Easy to drink and definitely sessionable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Decent. I might order another, but i doubt I'd buy 6. It's not bad, just not great."

"O - Really quite good. It's simple like it should be. A nice and drinkable, refreshing pale lager. What more could you ask for?"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Memorable for having slightly more flavor and depth than most American Pale Lagers I've had...but that's not particularly difficult to do in this category."
"Bell's never seems to disappoint (that I can recall), and this is no exception. As a lager, it's a bit too rustic for my personal tastes, but it definitely works. I have to wonder what this would be like on cask with the character it is presenting. Regardless, this is another good beer from Bell's."
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a decent, light, easily drinkable beer. It is brewed to style so there is nothing that jumps out at you. It's just a refreshing, lighter offering that is rather enjoyable on a hot day."
""
""
""
"Poured from a bottle into a lager glass. Pours a standard lager yellow with about 2 fingers of head. At least, That's what I had gotten out of it. The smell is of strong citrus. And I mean STRONG. An appealing citrus though. The taste is a wee bit of corn flakes with an ever stronger hit of citrus coming through in the end. The mouthfeel is terrible. Tastes like Lemon pledge and soap suds. Overall, This is an alright beer for the summer, So long as you can actually choke it down"
"Bottled 03/09/2012. 12 Oz. bottle into a plastic cup. Pours a golden straw yellow body. Small white head settles to some thin edging. Smell is sweet, bready, and bland. No hops, just some sweaty off flavors. Nice carbonation and mouth feel. Taste is identical. Not a bad lager, but not a great beer."

""

"Clear golden yellow with a good bit of carbonation streaming up from the bottom of the glass. Finger or two of white head, moderate retention and OK lace. Toasty, grainy bread on the nose with subtle hopping. Perhaps a bit earthy/vegetal, and doughy. Tastes about the same, grainy and crackery. Crisp hoppiness. Light body and medium carbonation. A simple beer, and nice for the style. I'd take this over their Third Coast Beer."
""
""
""
""
"Pours out a straw colored yellow with a thin white fizzy head. Has a bit of a sour smell to it at first Very clear with many noticeable carbonation bubbles. Smell is somewhat bitter and hoppy as well. Somewhat grassy with a slight malty graininess to it. Has a nice straight forward pale grassy bitterness to it. The maltiness is more earthy and grainy going along very well with the mild hop bitterness. It has a nice strong flavorfull slightly bitter yet balanced finish. Very drinkable and very awesome if your not quite into craft beer. I would definitely buy this again. It is just a perfect all around lager for any kind of beer lover, and very session-able."

"I really like this beer. For a lager it's tasty, light, and refreshing. I could very easily drink an entire 6er of this after a day in the yard or at the ball park."

"D/O: This American-brewed lager cultivates pre-prohibition imagery in the mind of the drinker, as if referring back to an era when American lager suggested advancement rather than surrender. Strong all-around and about as good of a representative of the style as one can hope to find, this might be the beer that Boston Beer Co. had in mind before brewing their ponderous Alpine Spring seasonal. Balance is struck here, with easy fluid qualities scaling well to significant hops and unobtrusive yet defining malt."
""
"Taste is similar, simple grains and yeast, and with a nice hops twang at the finish. Tasty and quite sessionable. Well-done!"
"Served from tap into a sampler tumbler. Poured a pale yellow with a half finger white head that subsided to a minimal amount slowly. Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, nutty, wheat, and perfume. The flavor was of sweet malt, nutty, wheat, and floral. It had a light feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a good brew. The aroma was a little off-putting on this one as the perfume (at least how I would describe it) note was quite strong. I was quite concerned that this would be an overpowering flavor as well. However, it was subdued in the flavor and came across more of a floral note than anything. This one was quite easy to drink and a good changeup for the night. Glad I got the chance to try this one on tap."
"o - overall, i didn't think i could find a lager that i would dig, but i've found it. i'm now REALLY excited to try the bottle of Quinannan Falls that i have!"

"DRINKABILITY: This is an all-day beer. We quafed them down while sitting at the pool and the beer was close to perfect for the occasion. Value was terrific and I would definitely buy it again. As a matter of fact, there are a half-dozen sitting in the refrigerator right now. The beer presents a good balance between malt and hops with a decent hoppy finish. It would be a good beer for entertaining friends (as we were) and is almost a West Coast lager but barely missed the sweet spot in just about every category."
""
"O: I'll go on the record as say the American Pale Lager is not my favorite style, but this is a very good beer."

"O - Nice lager, light."
"Aroma of cereal grains and small flowery hop. In the taste, clean lagery flavor. Cracker like malt, restrained bitterness and a clean finish. Actually similar to alot of the macro lagers, but more unoffensive than most. Mouthfeel is light and carbonation is decent. Overall, Bells proves they can brew a ""working class"" beer. Standard American Lager, with no frills."
"Overall: A pretty solid lager. Nice level of hop bitterness for a pale lager."
"Mouthfeel: Refreshingly crisp carbonation explodes with flavor elements settling lightly on the pallet."
"O - Meh. Taste about like an adjunct lager. Not bad if you want something simple and want to stray away from a Bud."
"O- A good pale lager. Easy drinking and enjoyable. Worth a shot."
"O - An extremely tasty light lager. Great for a day on the lake or tailgating, when you want to have multiples but not buzz too much. I will buy this again"
"Notes: The subtitle of this beer (on the label) is “Lager of the Lakes.” I don’t think so. I think that Great Lakes Dortmunder Gold is closer to deserving that honor."
"The flavor is okay. Tastes more like a pale ale than say a Helles lager."
"O - A good lager. Crisp, clean, with some nice subtle tones and a surprising bitterness for the style."
"O: For a pale lager, it's ok. I am in about 100 degree weather right now and this was perfect for the heat."
"O: This is likely the best APL that I have come across. A pretty boring style that allows no flaws. This is a great job of balance & style adherence. A no-brainer replacement for the BMC crowd."
"If you have never given Bell's a chance, don't let this style be your first. I'm probably being overly harsh, but this falls well short of the many great styles to come from this Michigan brewery."
"Overall: An average beer. Not a good pale lager, not a good beer. Getting a little tired of Michigan beers not living up to their state's great reputation."
"This one pours a very bright and very clear straw gold in color with a light white lacing around the glass. It smells of crisp pale malts and adjuncts, nothing noteworthy. The flavor is of clean and crisp pale malts. It has a light bitterness and is just really light all around. That said, it tastes of a quality lager. It is what it is. It drinks light and is crisp and refreshing. This is actually really good for the style. I'm a fan. It's an undervalued style but this is one of the better ones."
"O - A decent lager. Not great, but very refreshing and very clean tasting. Would be a nice beer for out fishing on the lake on a hot summer day."
"o - Overall not one of Bell's better beers. Seems very average and the smell wasn't great. Wouldn't seek it out again considering all the other great beers they make."
"Beer is thin and biting, it gets better the more I drink it but the finish is dry with a mild bitterness that is a little harsh. I don't really like it or understand how this could really be the #10 lager but I guess it is an indication that this style sucks. I won't have it again, I semi-regret having it to begin with."
"This is a great looking lager, it pours a transparent pale gold color with a big head that retains quite well. Looks very refreshing. Aroma is good, there's some nice grainy, sweet, and light malts over a bit of noble hops. A bit watery. The taste is that of a very clean, high quality lager. There's a solid amount of bittering hops on the finish. There's really no way to better describe it. The mouthfeel is good, it's crisp at first, but ends semi-dry. The drinkability is also good. Overall, a solid, well-orchestrated lager."
"Overall I was very happy drinking a growler of this beer. Easy to drink and worth a shot."
"Reviewed from notes. Yep...smells like a lager. Poured into pint glass a golden straw color w/thin lacy white head. Being a fan of Bell's I was interested in trying this one. However, I was surprised @ the bold almost bitter taste on the front end followed by an average to underwhelming finish. 1st impressions as the rest of the sixer grew on me, however I would by other offerings from Bell's before returning to this crisp, yet slightly bitter offering. Worth the try, but not high on my return to list."
"This lager is a well made beer that goes down easily. It is refreshing, crisp and clean. It is also ultimately not that interesting to me. Not one I would seek out again, but also not one that I would avoid."
"Overall: Very drinkable. Very flavorful. Refreshing. a knockout in my opinion. My favorite lager I will be buying more of this."
"Decent lager, which I know I've had in a bottle before, and if memory serves, is much better on draft. Still, it is decent at best; have it after you've had your first and secnod choices of the evening."
"overall this is a pretty drinkable session beer...but def worth the price....9.39!...yea american dollars"
"Overall: This really is a beer of ""almosts"". This is so close to a world class lager, but just misses the mark in every category."
"M./O. The mouthfeel is nice smooth and crisp and overall it is a nice easy drinking beer for the nice summer weather."
"something I'd drink again I'm just not going to go looking for it, and if Bells were on the shelf I'm sure I'd be buying some of their other stuff"
"Pours a fizzy gold, capped with a short-lived with wisp of froth. This beer is more herbal-hoppy in the nose than an average APL or general Lager, but otherwise it is straightforward as they come. Pale grain, faint sweetness, light earthy and floral notes, and a refreashing, light body comprise this brew. Not bad, not great either."
"D- a good drink but nothing to blow you away. Bells took a what I think to be a boring style and improved it a little. I give them extra credit for doing that and having a sub 5.0%abv. If you enjoy a lighter beer I'd check it out."
"Overall-This was a very hard difficult to review. Would I drink this again? Probably not. I'd definitely prefer other sessionable beers, but for the style it's good, clean and refreshing. I would like to give this to my Dad and see what he thinks as a BMC drinker."
"O: I'm sure this beer will rate a little better when I get my hands on a fresh one, but honestly I thought this beer held up pretty well for a 10 month old low ABV lager."
"D- 3.5 Though I could drink plenty of this I probably wouldn't want to have more than a couple. It just doesn't have that much going for it. Rather bland for Bell's as I have come to know it."
"M - It's got a pretty thin, mildly oily texture that's very pleasant with the substantial carbonation"
"Figured I'd start the drinkin' day with something on the lighter side. It pours a very lightly hazy pale straw topped by a finger of white foam. The nose comprises wheat, light lemon zest, coriander, and a very mild touch of orange sherbet. The taste musks things up a bit, dirtying up the wheat and adding a pinch of black pepper (which, in these surroundings, goes a pretty long way). According to the label, this isn't an out-of-date bottle, so I'm not really sure what to think here. The body is pretty light, with a moderate carbonation and a wet feel. Overall, a pretty nice pale lager, though I'm not too big a fan of the taste profile I got."
"Although the look and the smell weren't promising, Bell's Lager proved to be a quality lager with a good bit of hops. Refreshing and easy to drink."
"This is one delicious golden lager. Highly sessionable, clean, nice mouthfeel, moderately carbonated. Very easy to drink and one of the better summer refreshers I've had. Personally, I have Bells as overrated in most categories, but this is a knockout for the style. When I'm in the mood for an easy drinking, great tasting brew...this one hits the spot. I mean...why drink Bud when this is around!! Will purchase again"
"It pours deep yellow with a white short lived head, lots of bubles. On the nose there's some burn-sweet like scent, the taste is pure malt, it leaves a bitter-sweet taste, medium body with plenty of carbonation. Feels the mouth in a good way, very easy to drink, I never had a lager like this before."
"Light blonde with cornsilk highlights and a stiff white head that leaves a little fine lace on the glass. Untoasted grain, pale malts and an earthy, herbal hop aroma. Light and well balanced with a nice balance between grain and herbal hops. Light bodied with crisp carbonation. Good stuff, one of the better lawnmower beers."
"D: A pretty rare miss from Bells, at least in terms of their regular lineup."
"Aroma and flavors are grainy and earthy from the noble hops. Slightly nutty with a musky straw and a corn likenes, crisp in that dark earthy sense. Flavors finish clean with just a bit of residual lingering. A well made brew that would appeal to others more then myself, the dark earthy aspects are probally what lowers it for me, i'd have prefered to see more of a bright balance."
"Drinkability: Its a good daytime summer beer where you can easily put away a case"
"Poured a bright golden amber with a nice frothy and fizzy white head that quickly faed leaving behind simply an average looking macro like lager. The aroma was full of grain, tons of it and that was about all there was. A hint of corn in the back, but a predominant musty breadlike aroma. The taste was pretty bland to be honest. Not horrible mind you, just terribly average. Lots of corn and grain and bread again. This was your typical macro kinda lager, nothing really great at all, better then a bud light but I think I will pass."
"Chris"
"Drinkability: It's okay. Nothing special. Better than some lagers I've had, but not the best. The lingering hop bitterness in this one I think cuts the wrong way against the nice crisp start of the beer. Oh well. Not a waste but I probably won't get it again."
"D \ I could have a bunch of these. Yummy stuff that goes down easy and tastes great next to a meal or a snack."
"Crisp bite, with some ghostly herbal hop flavor appearing in the background. Grainy and simple, some pilsner malt, and very mild hop flavor. Feels a bit flaccid, but the crispness saves it from being too bland. Pretty clean with no off flavors, just a simple straightforward lager. More of a lawnmower beer perfect for hot weather and barbecues."
"Drinkability: No fancy tricks, no barrel-aging, no over-the-top hop profile, just a fine, serviceable, quaffable lager. Exactly what I needed on this mid-afternoon!"
"D- Definitely drinkable, not a great beer in any sense though but that is an issue with the style. Would much rather be drinking these all night than an mass-brew beer, but would expect to pay the same price for it."
"Overall: Nothing I really loved and kind of bland."
"D - It fits the style. Problem is, I'm not a huge fan of the style."
"D- Overall there isn't much flavor to this brew but it's pretty easy to drink."
"Mouthfeel was very light. It was very nice and very easy to drink but still enough flavor to keep you satisfied."
"D- This beer, while not terrible, really just fades into the fray for me. With so many other great session beers out there i'm not quite sure why you would pick this one."
"D - Solid pale lager; do your BMC friends a favor and introduce them to this, they will thank you for it. Very sessionable. This is not amazing, just a nice lager for a hot day."
"This brew pours clear straw yellow with a thick white head that diminished to a thin skim and left a little lacing. The aroma is moderately malty, grainy and sweet along with a bit of clean, European Pils yeast character if that makes any sense. The flavor is initially rather malty, crackers and grain with just a little sweetness. The beer transitions to moderately bitter with a pleasant, spicy, floral hop flavor and a dry, crisp finish. The carbonation is appropriately medium-high with medium body. Overall this is a well made very tasty American Pils. If all American Pils had always been made this way, the craft brew revolution may have never started; satisfying and refreshing."
"D - This is a very drinkable beer. One of the best lagers I've had so far. It goes down easy, and it is a very smooth beer. Overall I think this is a very good beer. Bell's did a good job on this one."
"D - Goes down easy. I will have to remember this one for the springtime or summer. Very good combination of flavors and mouthfeel."
"D: The beer is decently drinkable, but for what I expected to be an easy drinking lager is less drinkable than expected."
"D: Easily the most sessionable beer I've had in awhile. While it doesn't have much going on in the aroma or taste, it makes up for in sessionable drinkability. It is simply very easy to drink."
"M/D: The beer had a light feel to it, as expected. The beer was clean, crisp and very easy to drink. Overall, this beer is an excellent alternative to a BMC beer."
"Pours a golden yellow color with a thick white head and a little bit of lacing. Smells of grain and some floral hoppiness with a little bit of vanilla. Tastes pretty bitter for your average lager (not really a characteristic of its style. Some decent malt to even out some of the thick hop bitterness. Mouthfeel is medium and very nice. Highly drinkable."
"Overall this is one good lager, i always knew this style could be done much better then most macros and Bell's proves it. This beer just might be my go to micro lager. Good job bell's."
"The flavor is sweet malt with a thin, but satisfying grassy hop edge balancing out the end. Not too complex, for a lager it has a great mouth feel and body. Over all a good easy summer time drinker, or any time really. Unpretentious, humble, and worthy."
"O: Great stepping stone beer. Sneak this one to a reluctant guest and see what happens."
"Not bad at all. Crisp....clean."
"No doubt, this is a nice lager, but it's still a lager and, as such, not something I would drink frequently."
"Pours very clear, nice head. I can't tell if it's a dark amber or a dark yellow, in the low light of the bar. I'll give it the benefit of the doubt. smells grassy/earthy. iit's got that much odd complexity going on, it tastes that much like a hayfield. Only, while great all malts almost magically filter out everything but the flowery sunshine of a hayfield, good all malts let a few allergens through. After all the roses and whatfor there's a slightly icky aftertaste that doesn't ruin the beer but doesn't leave a good impression, either."
"D= This is basically a basic lager nothing to get to excited about."
"D: Easily the best lager I've ever had (although it should be noted that lager is perhaps my favourite style). Very light, drinkable, and pleasant. I probably won't have many more, but Bell's Lager is recommended."
"Bell's has crafted one of the world's great lagers. Heady malt and floral hop aromas, are mirrored on the palate. There is a magical balance of hedonistic flavors and delicacy that it's nothing short of impressive. This is the beer world's answer to a Grand Cru Chablis."
"This is a good enough beer to sit around and drink, but nothing to write home about. I could see this as a good session beer but not much else."
"Drinkability: True to style, but nothing to get excited about. I like how Bells usually takes ordinary styles and does something extraordinary with it. Here I do not get that same feeling. Perfectly drinkable, but nothing I will seek out again."
"The mouthfeel is light with carbonation is high. Drinkability is pretty good for the style. It had a bit more hop flavor to it then a lot of others in the style which I liked. Easy drinking, relatively flavorful and a decent beer overall."
"D: Refreshing and smooth. A good selection any day."
"The beer pours a brilliant gold, with a just off white crown that rises initially to two fingers in height and stubbornly sticks around for a while. Lacing is definitely above average. The nose is of sweat, slightly bready malts and herbal, flowery hops. Each sip brings a carbon copy of the nose. It's straightforward, but very well executed. Carbonation is fine, and the body is impressively rich for a beer of this style and size. Bell's Lager is fairly drinkable beer, but then again I'd be alarmed if a 4.5% pale lager wasn't. Pale Lager isn't a flashy style, there aren't any bells and whistles to hide behind, and so it's a beer like this that really highlights the talent of the Bell's brewers."
"The drinkability is pretty good, nice step up from an adjunct."
"Golden color with plenty of bubbling to keep the white head at a millimeter or so. Good retention and a little lacing. Very bright. Nose has some grain-husk earthiness and German accents that are interesting and add some complexity to an otherwise run of the mill affair. Lots of Munich malt flavor, fairly light in general. Toasted and pale malt. Dry, crisp finish, with some bitterness. Quite snappy overall, with pretty good balance and enough flavor to be interesting."
"D - Very easy to drink and much better than others in its class."
"Poured an almost clear straw color with a nice white head that diminishes quickly. Never had too many craft lagers, so this should be interesting. Smells very sweet and i get a light mixture of bready yeast, malts, grain, and hops. The taste is definitely the best lager I've ever had. Not used to lagers tasting this good. Nice sweetness combined with the hops and grain to make a very nice tasting lager. Great for this hot summer weather. Drinkability is VERY high on this one!"
"Clear straw colored brew, just a touch of haze but hardly any. Sizeable white head, good lacing. Scent is clean and sweet pale malt. Sweet malt on the taste with a fair amount of grain flavor. Kiss of floral hops rounds it out. Thin mouth, fairly acidic. Very refreshing brew."
"Judged to style, this is a quality offering. Not quite as complex as a Czech or German pils, but certainly more enjoyable than the standard Euro-American macro lager InBev grinds out."
"Drinkability - This is the first pale lager that I can say that I am actually fond of. Add to that a relatively weak abv and you have a very drinkable beer."
"D - Just a nice lager, I could see having this in the summer, but I think this would be a good beer to introduce BMC drinkers into the craft beer world."
"D -- Very easy to drink, nothing amazing. A solid czech style pilsner, almost indistinct from Pilsner Urquell aside from the different grain profile. Good, but not mindblowing."
"Good lager which is slightly overpriced @ 10 a sixer in DC."
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability: Very clean but might not leave enough of a presence on the taste buds to be a stellar beer. Solid lager with a subtle carbonation which really tickles the tongue."
"D: Overall solid lager which drinks rather light, would be a good session beer."
"D: Drinkability is through the roof. Quite a sessionable brew."
"Drinkability is very high. This is an incredibly clean, crisp lager. I could drink a gallon without batting an eye. I can see myself grabbing more as the weather warms."
"Lager of the Lakes is a great pale lager that works as a great ""stepping stone"" beer. Do you have a friend that drinks Miller Lite and they dont like the stuff you bring over? Give them this and they will begin to see the light. Not too much flavor but a nice light ""pilsner-esque"" taste that will be the life of the summer party for your ""uncultured"" friends."
"Mouthfeel is medium-bodied with a dry finish. Highly carbonated which gives it a little bite. But the unbalanced bitterness doesn't lend this beer to more than one or two in a sitting."
"D: A fine example of the Pils style. Sorry BA, but even the description calls this a Pils. If they cleared it up, it would be near perfect."
"Lager of the Lakes has become my favorite Bell's beer. This has all the great qualities of Bell's (smoothness, full flavor, and obvious, ""made with care"" quality all-around) without the negative qualities (the chewiness, overdone flavors and syrupy aftertaste of the heavier Amber, Two Hearted Ale, Best Brown, etc.) This is a straight-ahead no pretenses beer with full flavor and excellent drinkability. Refreshing without being light bodied, crisp, clean and very enjoyable. It's kind of an overlooked Bell's offering, but for those who just want a great no nonsense beer, this is it. They also have a ""Third Coast Beer"" which seems to be in the same category as Lager of the Lakes. Not sure what they're thinking, since I've tried both and they seem incredibly similar, except the Lager reviewed here is better tasting."
"Reviewed on 12/11/2009. Bottle. Pours a clear light yellow with a small white head, very piss-like. Aroma of sweet wheat malt, bready malt. Flavor of stale bready malt, a touch of light fruits but only slight. I'm a bit disappointed with this beer -- overall, a boring pale lager."
"Pours a slightly clouded yellow golden body with a bright white two fingered depth head creamy textured with specks of yeast floating in it. As the head dwindles it forms speckled even lacing with each sip. Aroma is full of biscuit and bready cracker like malt sweetness nice cerealg grains with a zesty dose of citric hops and a semi metallic mineral edge with an herbal grassy hop nose as well. Flavor has some lively carbonation more biscuit and bready malt flavors with ample bitterness from the grassy and citric hop edge a very nice agressive but sessionable lager full of flavor and thirst quenching characteristics. Mouthfeel is lighter bodied but not watery, carbonation is natural and the unfiltered yeast adds some nice textures crips clean finish perfect balance. Drinkability is dead on for any season I could make this a go to beer if I had more readily available I've never seen this one with all of the Bell's I've drank since 2001."
"I've had quite a few different brews from Bell's and have not had anything approaching this poor. I have to imagine that I picked up a badly handled bottle."
"Out of a 12 ounce bottle and into my shaker glass. the lager appears a clear golden yellow color with about two fingers of pillowy off white foam. Notes of toasted bread, sweet caramel malt, fruity apples, grassy, prickly hops, and some biscuits make up the majority of the nose and taste here. Medium bodied and amply carbonated. Quite easy to drink and a nice session lager."
"Taste: Reminds me a lot of their Third Coast Beer. Probably using the same hops for both beers. Nice lingering spice from the hops."
"This beer pours a clear golden color. The head is an inch in height, and recedes slowly into nice lacing. The aroma of bready malt, with hints of spicy and fruity hops. The taste is more balanced than the aroma. There is a nice lingering spiciness. The mouthfeel is slightly lighter than medium bodied with ample carbonation, and a smooth texture. Overall, I really like this beer. It has more than enough going on in the taste/aroma to keep me interested, yet is still light enough to make it very sessionable."
"Very assertive hoppiness for a lager. Overall, another quality product from Bell's."
"D: Take a wild guess."
"Pours a perfectly clear, deep golden color with a steady stream of bubbles rising to the surface that support a fluffy white head that leaves streaks of lacing. Aroma is fairly mundane, toasted malt, typical American lager, light hops, ho hum. Body is fairly light, watery in the finish, but supported by strong carbonation and a hoppy finish. Strong flavor of grain and toasted malt, obviously not the most remarkable Bell's beer, but a very flavorful lager compared to others in this class. I'd still prefer Great Lakes Dortmunder for the price and availability for this ""class"" of beer, but still worth a six pack in the summer."
"All around a great beer and a benchmark for lagers. Larry, how do you do it?"
"D: I couldn't, but someone without tastebuds could."
"This is the closest microbrew I've had to a standard American Adjunct Lager, but it still has more flavor and character than Bud or MGD. I think this would be a good beer for someone used to those beers to begin branching out."
"Quaffable, light summer time lawn-mower beer"
"D: Very drinkable, kick-back-and-relax kind of brew."
"Very nice and easy to drink on a hot day!"
"I could definitely drink more than one, which I did, but I guess I wanted more from what I consider to be my favorite brewery right now."
"A very drinkable lager for a craft drinker."
"T:"
"Poured a maze colored haze, with creamy 3/4 inch head. Lacing is nice but quick. Smelled like a jar of worms. Grains, slightly sweet malts come through. Piney hops, that finish crisp. This is very good. Mouth is smooth in middle and sharp bite at finish. Overall this is tasty and satisfying. Great beer for summer in the sun. Enjoyed thoroughly."
"Pours a crystal clear straw yellow, very light in colour, thin white head forms, quickly drops down to a thin ring, few lace spots stick. Smell is nice, sweet and malty, very clean, some toast, oats and cereal, light floral and grassy hops. Taste is similar, really full and clean maltiness, a touch sweet, oats and cereal again, some toast, light floral, grass, touch of bitterness in the finish. Mouthfeel is light bodied with low to medium carbonation, goes down easy. A real nice everyday lager."
"Mouth feel is lively and crisp. This is one easy drinking brew with enough going on to keep things interesting. It's almost up there with Prima Pils in the hops department, and I'd say it is pretty comparable to that fine lager. I'll be buying it again. Nice to find a top shelf lager from my home state."
"D -- Very good -- 5.0 from the Bell's site, not 4.5 as listed here. I like this one for a no-nonsense quaffer. Try it on your macro-drinking friends."
"D: Very much drinkable."
"A straw colored lager that releases a light to moderate amount of foam when poured. Some sticky bits of lace are left behind as the head falls. Very hay-like smell. Tastes very crisp, light with some toasted malt and fairly bracing peppery and bitter finish. Quite dry. A delicious lager beer. A little more refined and maybe drier than the Third Coast Beer which I think is an ale anyways. Bitterness coats the tongue after a few sips. Very nice."
"light to mid body. adequate carbonation. i like this beer. i would drink again."
"The beer is poured a brilliantly clear pale straw colour with a nice big fluffy head. The carbonation in the beer is quite evident just by looking at it because of the clarity. When smelling the beer a rich malty flavour comes through, but it's mostly grainy notes. The beer has a fairly assertive bitterness that I wasn't expecting with a nice floral/spicy hop character backed up nicely by a rather subtle grainy flavour. The flavour is very good; the crisp balance between the noble hops and the maltiness is grand. The mouthfeel is slightly creamy with, but light enough for the style. I don't know how much I could drink of this, even though it's pretty damn tasty."
"Poured from a 12oz bottle. The beer was pale yellow color, crystal clear, with a thin wet head. The aroma was clean, neutral, no real flavors beyond light malt. The beer was tasty but the flavor is not strong, kind of muted and malty. Medium body, easy drinking, definition of a session beer."
"pour is a sunflower yellow with a light tint of green. no murkiness what so ever. nice carbonation. consistent bubbles coming up from bottom of glass. smell is a light hop of mint. palate a wood pulp malt and apple with as not sweet but mealy apricot finish. will have again."
"This is a very drinkable brew and a good offering from Bell's."
"Alcohol is 5%, not 4.5 as BA notes."
"D: Definitely drinkable, but not the best example of the style--after one, I think I'd probably opt for a different beer."
"Clean, quenching, and fairly boring. Reminds me of Budweiser."
"Mouthfeel is very thin, highly carobonated. Spices tingle the tongue."
"I may have to give this lager another try. I'm wondering if I got a skunked brew. I love the Kalamazoo Stout by Bell's so this one is leaving me unfulfilled."
"Bottle,batch #8654. A bright clear golden color with a medium fizzy white head,lots of carbonation going on here.A nice clean citrus hop and mild dry grain aroma,a little grassy,maybe some lemon. Flavor is very fresh and crisp, just mildly hoppy with some lemon,grass spice and kind of a light bready grain and then finishes slightly dry with just a bit more of the citrus zest . A nice easy drinker ."
"D: Well, I paid 10 bucks for this 6er, which I would do anytime for a nice craft beer. But, for about 3 bucks less, I can find Ray Hill's, which is this beers' equal. I really dig this beer, and wanted to like it more, but the price doesn't allow me to. But, then again, it is less than 2 bucks a bottle, which is actually not bad I guess..Confusing, but, would buy again. Smoetimes, a guy just wants to sit down, and have a great , refreshing American Lager!!"
"M/D - the mouthfeel is as thin as the taste. I could easily drink this any time but the price is as high as I have ever seen in the style"
"Straightforward but delicious, Bell's Lager is one that would be a very good session beer."
"This beer poured a clear golden color with a decent white head. Almost no smell is present, maybe a touch of spice? The taste is very clean, not much going on but good. Overall this is a OK lager, but at the price it's going to be hard to buy a sixer."
"Bells Lager poured a pale straw color with a small head, with ok lacing. The smell was strong with loads of citrusy hops. Taste was full of citrusy hops with hints of malty sweetness. Mouthfeel was good, and the drinkability was nice. This beer was refreshing. Overall this was not a bad beer. A little lighter then some of the other American Lagers. Good beer probably more meant for the summer, but a nice lager. Would buy again."
"D-Drinkability is good. It was a refreshing beer, which made it very easy to put down. This would certainly be an appropriate beer for a warm summer day cruising on the pontoon, but it seemed a little off drinking it on a cold January evening. Regardless, pretty tasty."
"A few sips into the second beer and all of the flavors sort of came together. Perhaps it was the initial hop shock of the first sip of the first bottle that put me off, but down the road it came together. That begs the prerequisite for this beer: drink one of these before you have your first one of these. What does this mean? It took two beers before I started liking the taste. Maybe it's more of a toleration factor than it is a liking. I'll say that this beer is a unique taste experience over time."
"The first thing that caught my eye as I poured this beer was its haziness. I give it props for this unexpected trait in a lager that would otherwise just be your typical, light golden brew with a small white head. Smells very grainy, with a honey sweetness and grassy hops. Taste is bizarre in that it seems slightly sweet and mostly zesty on the palate but then leaves you with a kinda stinky finish that just ruins it for me. I tend to like most of Bell's styles but this lager is one of the exceptions."
"This was an enjoyable beer, which was easy to drink. Nothing overly rememberable about it, it tastes good, but it really is a run of the mill lager. The flavor is kind of like a pilsner, but it has a medium body to it. Realistically it's a good meal beer; you can drink this with a burger because the flavor won't affect the flavor of the food."
"A decent beer overall but at $10.00 a six'r not sure it's something I would consider a session beer."
"D: The lager tastes fuller than it is. I'd very impressed with this one."
"D - Fuck this. I'm not sure what Bells was aiming for, but it's hard to fathom that this beer was the intended product. I'm having to choke this down as it is; this is surely destined for a drain pour. This tastes more like beer on the way back up."
"M/D - overall not a bad beer, light bodied and refreshing, a good drinking beer."
"If they could just do a pilsner like Lammsbrau's....mmm...."
"The taste is firm, strong grain body with a lot of herb, lemon, hints of pine and grass. Again, it is a very flavourful, complex interpretation of the American-style lager, clearly within that tradition yet with great firmness and some complexity. It also is more hoppy and bitter than usual for the style and yet clean, crisp, and nicely crafted."
"D: In terms of flavor, this beats the pants off of most other American lagers in this style, but the bite is not only atypical, it throws the balance a little too off-kilter in my opinion. It seems stuck somewhere between lager and pilsner."
"Poured to a one fingered head that didnt hang around very long. Beer was light yellow in color and head was white. Did have some bubbles around the edges that left some decent lacing. Smelled of hops, malt, and maybe a little grainy. Tasted a little on the bitter side that had a slightly dry bitter after taste. This wasnt a bad thing. Also of hops and malt. Felt good in the mouth. carbonation was good. I would love to try a session with this Bells product. Alcohol wasnt real high, so I think this would make a good all nighter."
"As lagers go, it's a little dry and hoppy for sessioning. Solidly crafted, though... a very good lager."
"Slightly hazed pale yellow with a compact soapy white head. Aromas of earthy grain, herbal hops, and some lager yeast...clean overall. Flavor follows the smell...cereal grains, solid crisp hoppy bitterness, and a touch of sweetness. Medium-light body, dry and crisp. Not too shabby."
"D - Fairly drinkable, refreshing brew. Very accessible, but with some good flavour."
"I really cannot rate this beer so much on appearance as due to the circumstances I had to drink from the bottle. However since it was a hot summer day in Michigan and I was on a lake that was perfect with me. I will give the bottle props as being a MI native it features an old looking map with some symbols of ""Michigan things"" around it. The smell was grassy, straw-like with a biscuit and malt smell as well. The taste was about the same. Grassy and earthy with a nice malt backbone and dry grassy hops. The mouthfeel was light and crisp with high carbonation. Overall a good beer and good summer thirst quencher. I could see this beer appealing to many macro lovers."
"Taste & mouthfeel: Pale malts up front, bready and semi-sweet. There's a bit of floral/herbal hop flavor as well, but not to the extent that you'd find in a pilsner. Light and quaffable, but still full of flavor - this is what American macro lagers should taste like. There's a bit of soda cracker-like flavor near the finish, followed by a pleasing dryness with firm but light hop bitterness. Nice stuff, I could session the hell out of this were it locally available."
"Pours a hazy golden/ yellow with a white head. In the aroma, small hop, and sweet light malt. In the taste, light sweetness and a standard kind of lager. A light bitterness and a light mouthfeel, with a dry, small hop in the aftertaste. A standard kind of lager, yet nice and fresh."
"M + D: Light, easy going, and quite refreshing with a decent carbonation to complement it all. An easy session-brew, and a good 'lawnmower' beer without giving up flavour."
"It's a lager, which is admittedly not my favorite style of beer. This does seem to me like a decent lager. However, there is a bit of bubbly feeling arising from drinking this beer. It just doesn't agree with me--if you sense what I mean."
"I really all all-malt lagers. So much flavor. Pours a pretty golden color with some heavy carbonation. Thick white head that ever quite dissolves. Nose is biscuits and toast. Flavor is full of toasted malts. Slight hop bitterness keeps the sweet malts in check. Light mouthfeel that thickens as the beer warms."
"Seek this out. A great summer beer."
"Overall, a good hopped-up pils thats great with grilled foods and is easily drinkable. A good lager that's worth trying out if you see it."
"Picked up a 6-pack while in Indy. Pours a dark yellow, small white head that died off, but left a ring around my glass (overall well carbonated). Crystal clear. Malty aroma, a little bready and a hint of toast. Munich malt dominates the taste. Beer is fairly bitter, but well balanced. Hop flavor is spicy but not overpowering. They say the Amber Ale is their flagship brand, but I would say this beer gives it a run for that title. This is one beer I could come back to time and time again, but they don't sell it here!"
"Revisiting this one. What an excellent beer. Bready and honey/honeydew melon malt on the nose, a touch of earthy and lemony (not grassy) hop character, excellent balance of flavors all-round. Scores stand."
"12oz bottle poured into a Sam Adams Boston Lager glass, poured a crisp straw yellow with a thin diminishing head. Aroma was some weak pale malts, but almost nonexistent. The taste was quite disappointing, barely any better than anything by BMC. The beer was very light and crisp with decent carbonation, just what you'd expect from a cold Budweiser. Even in a lager, I expected more from Bell's, I'm glad I only bought one bottle and that I've got a tulip of Two Hearted to get back to."
"Although this is not my favorite style of beer these go down fairly easy, quite drinkable."
"M/D - Very crisp and clean in the mouth. A very drinkable lager."
"Pours an almost unearthly clear pale yellow with a slight head and great lacing. The smell is bracing - fresh, Pilsner-like with a hint of lemon. The flavor is honey-like and grainy, with just a hunt of plum and a whiff of floral hops. The mouthfeel is pleasantly thin and watery, just what you'd be looking for on a hot summer day."
"Eric"
"Mellow carbonation lightens a dense medium-bodied feel. The drink is dry and crisp with superb drinkability."
"Thanks to nmajdan for the opportunity. Pours a crisp clear golden straw color with intense carbonation that feeds a small yet impressive head. Good lacing. Smell isn't all that great, sweet light malts and perhaps a little noble hops too. Taste is kind of balanced, leans heavily on the spiciness of the hops. Refreshingly crisp. An American ""Pils"" perhaps?"
""
"Pours a dark yellow with a frothy white head that sticks around for a bit. The smell is strong on the malt and grain, not much else going on, maybe a bit of sweetness, but not a whole lot is going on here. The taste was a nice surprise considering the smell was not very powerful. The taste is crisp starting and finishing somewhat bitter with very little aftertaste. I have been searching for a lager that isn't afraid to pack some flavor in, and I think I found one. The mouthfeel is a lighter medium with plenty of carbonation and a good balanced taste. This is a very enjoyable beer that is not very overwhelming but still delivers, a great lager!"
"drinkability:"
"Poured into a pilsner a dull light golden with a nice formed but quick to fade white head leaving no lace behind,bready malt and wet grain aromas mainly and not much hop presence.Flavors are malt tilted very bready and toasty with a touch of honey-like sweetness with just a light smattering of floral hop in the finish.A solid malt tilted lager here not wimpy by any means,pretty good."
"Definately drinkable. I compared it to Henekin, but it's a little better than Henekin. If my wife didn't dig on it so much, I doubt I'd be buying it again. I wouldn't turn it down if it was offered to me, but I wouldn't seek it out either"
"Overall a remarkable pilsner. One of my favorites. I do enjoy a good Pilsner Urquell when I can get some on draft and I do think this beats it. Unfortunately it is a $8.99 a 6 pack, so I'll have to enjoy it sparingly."
"I'd recommend this beer."
"Pours a sunshne golden yellow, with slow moving, small bubbles. Great, thick merengue like foam with sporadic lacing. The aroma is a slightly funky, grassy mlt, and very earthy hop aroma. The The earthy hops jump right up front to the palate, slowly receding to grassy malts in some very soft water. The finish is a standard, light hop citrus. Astringent palate with a well balanced hop and malt bill. Very refreshing and easy to drink lager."
"drinkability is great. this is a light bodied lager that boasts some great flavors and a solid profile. a macro body with a craft profile."
"Nice texture with a crisp smooth taste. Hit the style there. Light on carbonation but very smooth with just a tad residuals. I guess for style this is a nice easy drinking beer that is to hoppy for style but still good. Easy drinking for sure."
"D: Solid, but nothing special. There are several other American lagers that are more distinctive and enjoyable."
"D - Forgettable, this one was completely average. Bell's can do much better. I guess if you didn't want to think about what you were drinking, this wouldn't be bad."
"Poured a light honey-gold w/thick white head that slowly faded into a think cap, and left thick traces of lacing. There is also a suspended haze. Smell is of rich, grainy Pilsner malt, light hops, spice, and faint citrus. Taste and mouthfeel is full and dry, with nice malts and slightly discernible rye, bitter citrus and spicy hops, and faint herbaceous notes. I really enjoyed this lager's simplicity, and light, yet rugged character."
"-Oelergud"
"The pour was a golden color with a slight white head. It had a citrus smell laced with a hop aroma. The citrus flavor was made present in this beer, but hops and wheat came through as well. It was almost like a Bud meets a Rolling Rock. It was easy to drink and it could definitely be a session beer for many. The mouthfeel was good but it was lacking something that should have been there. There was no bite."
"M/D: this has an easy drinking feel, the mouth feel is a bit crisp and i cold enjoy a few, but would not be my first choice for this style"
"Pale gold color. Clear, except for some whitish particulates that are floating about. Possibly chill haze? Small amount of white foam does not persist long, although the beer is well-carbonated. The initial whiff presents sulfide, which gives way to familiar pilsner malt aroma and light hops that are both spicy and citrusy. The taste is gently sweet up front, with a crisp finish. This beer is maltier and hoppier than American macro-style lagers, making it an interesting option as a thirst quenching spring or summer brew. The mouthfeel is smooth, with a slightly creamy texture. It's balanced flavors and moderate alcohol content make this a highly drinkable brew. A personal favorite among US lager types."
"Pours a gorgeous clear, sparkling rich golden color with plentiful brilliant white head. Really nice tracing as well. Trully one of the most beautiful lagers I've seen. Aroma is mostly coming from the Munich and Pils malts, a slight sulfur touch, and a little DMS. It finishes with some hop aroma and a little caramel. Incredibly bready on the palate, malts are very complex, ranging from whole grain crackers to whole wheat bread to fresh biscuits. The hops are certainly in there; not so much in flavor but with a quite bitter finish. Stylistically, it is lower in abv as a typical DME, and I would imagine on the high end for hop levels. It finishes also with a bright citrus flavor, coming from either Hallertau or Styrian hops, and a fruitier than normal yeast flavor. Overall, I thoroughly enjoy this beer like most from Bell's given its strong malt backbone and bitter Noble hop bite."
"Final Thought: Not worth the price, but a classic example of what PBR can become if they substitute more malt for corn."
"Overall Impression: Hard to get excited about this style. It's a hard one to do well, and this is better than many I've tasted. It's pretty well balanced. Eh, it's an American Lager."
"A light taste mostly of sweet malt. I didn't pick up any hops. Since it is a lager best served cold I didn't let it sit long to warm up which might reveal some more flavors, both good and bad. It feels light with adequate carbonation. It goes down fast and with a decent taste makes a 6-pack disappear quickly. But it is sold at a typical Bell's price which is a bit much for this beer. I could buy 2x more macro product that doesn't suffer from that much less taste. A good beer by style but what is the point at this price?"
"I felt it was a bit flat. Maybe it needed some more carbonation? I'm no expert, but it was lacking somewhere in the feel depaartment. I don't want to feel like I'm drinking pop rocks, but a little crisper finish would have been nice."
"Much darker than macrobrews but still relatively light. Moderate white head that goes away sort of quickly. There's an earthy cereal grain kind of odor that dominates the smell. It's decent but there's some undescribable strange chemical funk that I'm picking up... Yet I don't hate it. It's a decent lager. Way better than your typical Millers and Budweisers but not as good as German Lagers. Not a whole lot of sweetness either. Nice fizz and easy to drink, however. Not bad."
"REVIEW REVISED. Had again in December 2009. Much better this time with a nice balance of malty grains and floral hops. May have had an older or bad bottle earlier."
"Drinkability: This one had session Lager written all over it. After the disappointing appearance and aroma, I had my doubts that this wasn't going to be a very good beer, but it made up for itself where it counts. Not one of my favorite Bell's beer, but I wouldn't pass it down if I got another shot at it."
"Overall- The fresh taste would make for a good summer beer. It was a good example of the style."
"D - Great. I can drink this all day. Most of my friends don't understand my obsession with beer and don't like most of the beers i make them try. They mostly drin BMC's variety of beers. I don't understand how they can drink those and not stuff like this."
"Clear golden color with a 1 inch coarse head. Plenty of lacing and retention. Aroma of mown hay wonderfully represents the style. Taste is crisp and clean, finishes bitter to dry. All in all very refreshing  a lager you can really taste. I am enjoying it as a stand alone but it begs for pizza."
"D: Easy, easy drinking here. A perfect session beer. Highly recommended."
"D: A nice beer and better than BMC but nothing really memorable. Probably not worth the price given that there are better Bell's beer out there. This is definitely not my style of beer so this is hard to review."
"Golden color with two fingers of head, leaves a touch of lacing on the edges. Nose is strong on grain, light citrus. Flavor is likewise - lots of citrus, some niver roasted-ness offset. Some almost bitter grain later on, giving it some added complexity compared with standard macros. Body is medium with good carbonation. This one's definitely a step up from most lagers out there, but not one of my favorites from Bell's."
"D: Pretty nice I was washing down some whole dried anchovies with slices of fresh ginger with it, and I had steak with it the night before. this beer goes good with food. I give her a B."
"Nice lager from Bell's. Crisp, clean, hoppy, like a German pils. Golden straw color, nice white head, herbal and vegetal notes in the nose and on the palate. Very refreshing, dry, some citrusy fruitiness, plenty of character, a real sleeper hit. Recommended."
"refreshing, and balanced. They got the big rep for a reason. Tasty."
"Based on the taste of the first bottle, I was ready to highly recommend this brew; however, there may be a lack of consistency with this one which is surprising coming from Bell's."
"12 oz. bottle, batch 7761 - packaged on 1/11/07. It pours crystal-clear gold, with a few floaties, light carbonation, and a loose, white, three-finger head that leaves decent lacing. In the nose there is lemon, citrus rind, spicy hops, and a touch of malts - fairly mild, but you can tell that there's some good stuff down there. And the flavor is where you can tell that this is true; lots of lemony, grassy, spicy/skunky, and earthy hops deliver a medium bitterness, backed by lightly toasted and pale malts, and a slight sea-saltiness - all of which combine to impart a pleasant, lingering finish. The body is light to medium, with an initial crispness that is quick to even out, gliding easily across the tongue, drying the palate a bit as I drink. Damn that is a tasty lager. It is a supreme session beer whose taste and mouthfeel combine to create a great beer experience - a wonderful example of just how delicious a plain-old American lager can be."
"The taste is light and crisp as you would expect from a lager with a thin mouthfeel. This beer is very drinkable. Bells is a brewery for which I carry the highest regard. I have to say this beer is the least distinguished of the bunch. While this may be my least favorite Bells it is a very drinkable good beer. For a crisp summertime brew this is head and shoulders above rest in its style."
"The beer pours a pale gold color with a thin white head that fades to spotty lacing. The aroma is decent. It has a light, pale malt, lager yeast, and German hop aroma. It's crisp and refreshing with a mild hop spiciness. The taste is decent as well. It has a crisp, pale and Munich malt flavor that goes down easy and finishes clean and refreshing. There is a mild hop bitterness in the finish as well as light Munich presence in the malt profile. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a low bodied beer with good carbonation. This is a good drinking beer. It's an above average lager, but nothing too special."
"So not a bad beer, by all means it could be consumed in mass quantities but there are better beers from Bells for that."
"D: What can I say? Bell's knows how to make great beer, and not just the dark stuff. This is a lager that provides a bit of hoppiness that can be savored, but with precise balance. A real treat in the lager category."
"Recommended"
"Not crazy about this style, but this is a very drinkable beer. Good summer thirst quencher. Pours a decent head that fades quickly leaving no lacing. Taste of noble german hops on the back and some decent hallertau. Washes down clean and dry. Pours a golden color. A little steep for the price, considering it is a session beer, but that being said, this is a good beer I will buy again."
"12 oz bottle. This brew is pale straqw in color with a finger of head that falls to a bubbly coat over top with a few stray bubbles cascading up. There is a moderate haze in this one. The nose is mild with a peppery hop spiceyness, a touch of doughy sweetness and kiss of grain. It is very nice and crisp. The flavor is moderate grain and bready with a moderate spicey hop that moves to a mild bitterness on the finish. It is rather flavorfull and well balanced. Mouthfeel is moderate with a moderate carbonation. This brew is very easy drinking. The flavors really meld well. It certainly transcends what I expect from most brews in this style."
"Mouthfeel and Drinkbaility: I'd say that this beer is medium-light bodied with a slightly dry finish. Not much in the way of aftertaste, however this brew is a great session beer. Higher levels of carbonation really accentuate the cleanliness of this brew. This is a highly drinkable brew, as I said before its a great session beer. However, I don't know if I'll buy it again, without trying others first. The style really doesn't interest me all the much."
"Overall very good for the style ,a nice session beer."
"Pours a golden straw color with a sparkly foam head on top. Some lace remnants linger behind as the beer recedes. Pretty, but not uncommon among lagers. I am not a fan, however, of this aroma. It reminds me of wilted lettuce. Or, worse, of sour honey-flavored yogurt. I'm not sure what's going on in this beer to create such a malodorous aroma here, but it really is unpleasant. And it worsens as it warms up. Yet, despite the aroma that I find rather offensive, the beer tastes just fine. It's crisp and clean enough, and maintains less of the aroma in the mouthful than anticipated, that it cut throught the nonsense and gets to the heart of a pretty decent lager. It's malty, and a tad watery, but good enough to help cool off after a long hard day working in the yard. To the point, but not spectacular. An interesting beer, for sure. I'm not aware of any other beer in BA that I've been so up-and-down about in my rating scale over. A bizarre beer, this Lager of the Lakes."
"This is the first I have seen this beer in the stores I frequent in Columbus, so maybe they were scared of Bell's making a lager? This beer poured a light yellow gold color and formed a small bubbly white head that left latticed lace as it subsided. A small amount of carbonation is present. An aroma of malt, yeast, bread and slight aroma of hops. The flavor was of bread, yeast, some citrus and a touch of hops. The finish was light and crisp and would make a good session beer. I guess my one beef with Bells would be better pricing, since here selling the same as more potent ales like Oberon or Two Hearted means I wont pick this as a session beer."
"Hey, most of us would prefer other Bell's beers; they've made their name on big, assertive, delicious ales. But if you want something light to session with, to kick back with on the deck, something to work on for the entirety of a lazy summer afternoon without making you feel surly and clutzy, it would be hard to find a better pick than this."
"Thanks to dekker0 for this one - Glad I got to try it."
"This was a good, but slightly odd tasting beer. The malt and yeast profile made for a flavor that reminded me of meat, maybe roast beef. Still there's a nice toasted-like barley and pale malt flavor with a kiss of herbal hops. I could go either way, I think it's a good beer, but just not for me."
"Bottle into tulip glass. A: Nicely clear, orange-golden color. Good lacing and moderate head retention. S: Some really nice fruitiness under the bread, malt and yeast, minimal hops. Really clean. T: Nice firm malt upfront with hoppy bitterness following, dry finish. M: Moderate carbonation, smooth. D: Im not usually one for light lagers, but this is really enjoyable. Very straight-forward but very good at what it does."
"Bell's did it--finely brewed a beer to compete with Budweiser. It's not bad, a stepped up macro, which seems to be the intention. Macro-yellow color, or a bit darker and a white head that actually hung around for a bit to form some lace. Apple and spice in the nose like Bud but cleaner. Medium body, not bad, fills the mouth at least. Strong carbononation along with a spicy, peppery taste in the beer. Good and should've waited for a hotter summer day for this one, but not bad. I don't want six of them, but one was fine."
"Malty all the way. Toasted grain notes with a trace of sweet caramel thrown in for good measure. Relatively crisp and slick across the palate. Refreshing with a subtle bitter dryness in the finish. Hops are in there somewhere, you just have to search for them a bit. A very nice one from Bell's. Spring and summer are just around the corner and this would make for a fine session brew if it's available to you."
"A nice refreshing beer. Good job Bells Brewery!!!"
"This brew brings out the best characteristics of the style. Though I haven't read any other reveiews of this on BA yet, I'm sure some will slam it only because they prefer big ales and the like. But this is a wonderful Lager. I forsee a lot of this brew thoughout my summer."
"Drinkability - this is good and sessionable."
"Pours a small head, but that doesn't go away right away, it leaves a good 2/8"" head and has a clear yellow color. The smell is a nice lager smell, not too bad. It's bready, but not very bready, it has some good flavors too. The taste finishes with a slight bitter of hops and some breadiness like a regular lager, but this is the first one I have ever had that doesn't make me cringe. I like this one. Mouthfeel was pretty smooth with some crispness. Overall I would drink this instead of any other other lager any day."
"Definite session beer here...not dazzling the taste buds, but plenty to keep it occupied...would love it on tap."
"Overall, this is what an American Macro-lager should be. But, if thats what I wanted I'd buy a 30 of High Life instead."
"Drinkability: Refreshing and well-crafted; right for the style"
"A very good session ale, very complex for the style."
"Well, it is what it is--A lager from Bell's. The name is plain and simple, just like the beer. Basically average on all flavor profiles, but with a well formulated recipe and precisely executed brewing technique, the balance rises beyond just average. The aroma, look, flavors, and feel are what you would expect from other very good lagers. But with no identifiable characteristics, is difficult to praise. Delicate and very drinkable beer--one to drink all night or to chase a pizza."
"Mouthfeel is smooth and easy drinking. Nice body that's not too light but not too heavy. Steady carbonation throughout. Nearly perfect IMHO. Drinkability here is quite huge. I could see myself taking down a six pack of this on a hot summer day without blinking an eye. A solid, tasty lager from Bell's that doesn't fail to impress me with its subtle nuances. If I could get it again in IL I would!!"
"The smell consists of pilsner malt with a hint of bready munich malts. Also has a nice spicy, herbal, and floral noble hops bouquet. The taste is just as I would have expected from the nose. Has a nice bitter, lingering finish. Very crisp and clean and fairly dry. One of the better lagers I've had. I could drink it all night. It will make a good substitution for Victory Prima Pils, though not a replacement."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 3/4 bright white head over the clear light gold (yellow?) brew. Head fades moderately, with reasonable amounts of sticky delicate lace decorating the glass sides. Aroma is sweet pale malt coupled with a slightly tangy grassiness. Taste follows along the nose's guidelines, with the grassy hops melding pretty well with the grain character, and a crisp clean close. Mouthfeel and drinkability are pretty good as well. Wouldn't mind having this one as a local everyday drinker."
"D - I am not a big fan of this style but Bell's has made a nice tasty version of this style."
"Bought a single 12 oz bottle of this. Comes from batch 7613, packaged on October 5, 2006. Pours clear golden with a bright white head, very little retention. Smells like a crisp pale lager. Nice clean hoppiness to it. Hints of honey. Tastes clean and crisp. Seems the standard taste of an All-Malt Lager. Nice grainy aftertaste, very strong, comes in waves. A touch of bitter in the aftertaste, too. Nice fizzy bite to the mouthfeel. Very clean, sharp, easily drinkable beer."
"Mouthfeel was smooth and rounded with a drying finish. Medium/light body. A very nice, classic malt-lager. I will seek this one out again."
"Pours out a crystal clear with a light copper color, some white head. The aroma is dry, with notes of bread and yeast. Not bad. The flavor is simple, as you'd expect with a lager - crisp, and with a wave of bitterness at the end. It was similar in the mouth - sort of refreshing and clean, but nothing spectacular. It was relatively easy to drink, with no lingering aftertaste. Overall, it was fine - nothing offensive, but nothing that's really urging me to be it again."
"Pours quite pale, crystal clear & straw-colored with a thin & tight bright white head. Smells... lager-ish, with some old-fashioned American hops, and a nice grainy aroma. Body is quite light and crisp, with a bitterness that sneaks up on you and an explosion of hop flavor at the end. While the body is light and fizzy, the taste is nice and chewy and gives you something to come back for."
"Originally reviewed on October 29, 2006. Light rotting corn ester and fusel destruction in the aroma. The malt is stinky. A light waft of hop field grass blows in from over the hill. Pours a crystalline clear pale yellow. Very thin rim of head. Flavor is a more piquantly hopped version of the aroma, a biting terse grassy overtone plays over all the off corn sugar flavors. The malt disagrees with my tongue in more than one way. Its not possibly skunked, as its fresh off the delivery truck. Theres a light edge of creaminess to the grain sugars, but mostly a fusely off-note. Some light sweet orange rises from the hop smack in the backend. This beer is a sellout. Not even a good pilsener."
"Overall Impression: First off, I would have never know this was a Bell's beer. Not only being a Lager but this is the clearest Bell's beer I have ever seen. Clean fermented and you can tell this was lagered for sometime as this is a crisp refreshing, thirst quenching beer. Anheuser-Busch look out!"
"D - It has a bit more character than the average lager, but offerings like Brooklyn Lager just make this not worth it. Honestly, the way the grassy hops mesh with the metallic taste is just unpleasant enough that I would likely turn this one down in the future if it was offered to me. It could be sessioned, but I'd rather not. This one just didn't work for me."
"single bottle from Whole Foods Cary, no batch number"
"Despite my intolerance for Munich malt, I'm finding that I'm feeling better about Bell's Lager as the ounces disappear. There's so much hoppiness that I'm able to focus on that characteristic and ignore all the rest. In fact, I'm going to bump the flavor score to the more deserving number. From where I sit, this is good beer that could be great beer with one small recipe change."
"If nothing else, this is good beer for thought."
"Light golden color....nice bready malt aroma..taste is very dry...more German Pilsnerish than anything....cracker like maltiness and German noble hop style hoppiness....crisp mouthfeel...a little too dry in my opinion....not one I will seek out again"
"d -- i think this might be about as drinkable as beer can get. every sip is delicious and refreshing, without diminishing returns. this could be an absolute staple beer for sessioning."
"The taste has a reasonable fullness to it, at least for something with a name like this, it could have been like water, which it certainly is not. Still, this is light and quaffable. It has a dry perception to it that is driven by cracker-like malt notes and a nice contributing bitterness that is found throughout the flavor profile of this beer. A herbal hop character is also quite noticeable and almost takes on a minty note. This is certainly a nice beer, quite a bit more flavorful than I was expecting (I will admit to expecting it to lean more towards the macro side of things). Nicely quaffable, yet still has a certain fullness to it that allows the malt to stick to the palate. In fact the lingering notes that stick to the mouth are that of caramel and a hop bitterness. This beer strikes a nice balance between malt and hop throughout the flavor profile of this beer."
"It definitely has a lot more body than most lagers. Clean, crisp, flavorful and easy drinking. A very nice lager."
"drinkability: very high"
"I mean not to pan with faint praise. It's quite a fine lager. Problem is, I'm just not moved by them, no mater how good they are...though this hits it, and I really hope they have success with it. Certainly would be my choice if a gun were cocked and set next to my temples and I was told I had to drink a lager."
"Not a favorite style of mine, but interesting."
"Lager of the Lakes, declares the mappy, lake-ridden label. Pale yellow, straw, clean, clear. Fat cushion of lake foam white head. Crisp, snappy hop aroma. Cat pee, sea air, and rancid honey. Underbelly of sweetish, clean, biscuit malt. Toasted, bitter, spicy hop taste up front. Mellow honey and bread malt middle, with noble, herbal, hop bitterness increasing to a smooth, refreshing finish. Moderate body with a lively, yet creamy feel. This is a stand-up example of an all-malt lager. All those little cabin-supported taverns in N. Michigan should have this on a permanent tap."
"Clear golden body. Thin, airy white head. Lace comes in rings. Nice mix of malt and hops on the nose. Bready malts with crisp, floral hops. Medium-full body. Active carbonation. Malts are bready and cracker like. Hops add some bitterness and a little bit to this beer. Goes down pretty easy after a workout."
"This beer is very smooth. The hops and the malt are just exactly how I like a lager to be. This thing has a great malt flavor to it, very much like bread or a biscuit. Very refreshing. I really like this and could probably drink this all day. Highly recommend."
"Notes: Solid lager. Lots of flavor."
"The bottom line: a nice, middle of the road basic beer by Bell's, but which happens to hit the right notes with me. I like malt dominated beers, and this is definitely that, but yet it still has enough hops left to give the beer a tad of floral edge and a good finishing bite. Glad to see Bell's version of ""standard beer"" is a solid one."
"This is a really great lager, only marred by a yeasty nose which is initially off-putting, but thankfully overpowered by hops and malts. Not quite up there with Prima, but the glorious mouthfeel and nice drinkability more than makes up for it. Recommended."
"Again a very solid lager. Big full mouth great balance and length. Hints of honey comb, full of freshly baked buiscuts, with a big yeasty malty finish. Very drinkable and good lager. Could drink quite a few of these."
"Quite drinkable despite its flaws. We took some on the hiking trail the other day and it really hit the spot as we took in the fall colors along a ridge lined by cedar, oak, and elm."
"Clear bright gold color, small pale head, incomplete ring laces. Smell of honey, powdered sugar, and a strange bit of sourness. Mouthfeel is fairly sturdy, medium with higher than average carbonation. Good balance of malt and dry bittering hops that have just about the right amount of snap to balance the mild breadiness. Straightforward and drinkable beer, less so out of the bottle as many might consume it, some elements of the aroma are noticeable enough to detract from the beer somewhat."
"D- This beer has all the makings of a run-of-the-mill lager that is not very interesting but it is fresh."
"A solid, easy to drink, crisp lager from Bell's. This one pours out to a bright gold in the glass with a decent-sized head. The aroma is light, but gives off hints of citrus and bread. The taste is very good. There is a bread-like taste to this beer, which combined with a nice dose of hops, finishes off with a slight bitterness. Its not quite in the vein of a Euro-lager, but reminded me of Pilsner Urquell Meets Larry Bell, with Larry's crew putting their touches on it. This beer is extremely easy to drink and refreshing."
