The major turnoff to this brew is it's $9.99 a 6 pack. I don't think for what you get it's worth that price on a consistent basis. I'll stick with Miller High Life consistently if I just want an easy drinking, cheap, but very well made American beer.

I particularly enjoy the bite at the end of a mouthful.  Not too bitter, but just enough to remind you this is a beer to enjoy.  It holds its head and carbonation fairly long, and like all beers, it is much better when poured into a glass.  I hope to find this beer in a bottle next time instead of a can. I'll bet it's even tastier.","kd45-music","Dec 24, 2014"

What I liked the most about this beer was the taste and the mouthfeel, I liked how they managed to give this beer a bigger body while still keeping it very lager like.  What I like the least about this beer was nothing, there isn't a single aspect that I didn't fit into the style and there's nothing that I would change since it's good just the way it is.  I would buy this beer again when in the mood for a good Lager and I recommend this to anyone who is a fan of the style.  All in all I thought this was a tasty Lager and I enjoyed drinking it.  It's now one of my favorite Lagers and I think it's one of the better beers that Anchor makes.  Good job guys, this was one tasty Lager, keep up the hard work.","StoutHunter","Nov 02, 2014"

It possesses all the cleanliness, crispness and breadth/depth of flavor of the finest German lagers but is quintessentially 100% American. I will usually have 6 or 8 different brands and styles of craft beer in my fridge, all great brews, but when the CA Lager is amongst them, I almost always find myself instinctively reaching for just another one of them until they're gone.

Smells of malt, grains, light caramel and faint floral hops; smells like a sweet bready lager with a hint of fruit – pretty cut and dry nose with no exciting aspects. Tastes like malt, grains, wheat bread crust, caramel, light floral hops, herbs and pear with a little hoppy bitterness. The finish is malty with a lemon zest zing that trails off dry. Mouthfeel is light and crisp, with light carbonation, a very light body and a slightly bitter malty finish on the dry side.

3.92,6.8,4,3.75,4,3.75,4,"I wish this particular beer was more readily available in my region. We seem to get a rather limited subset of the Anchor lineup to date. I had yet to see this one here in Alberta at all until today, on tap at Beer Revolution and going in 12 oz. tulip glasses. Coolness. You know a brewery is shooting for historical accuracy when they single-hop a beer with Cluster, which is surprisingly still grown in this era during which Cascade is now considered old-fashioned by some. Somewhat unusual color for the style, a golden apple juice hue that is just darkening into a coppery bronze, with maybe an inch of white bubbles on top. Aroma is rather vinous and citric, evoking white wine, lemon zest, fresh grass, and subdued doughy malt. Tingles the nose. Taste includes these elements as well, with extremely crisp and dry middle and end sections. Some faint grass and green tea notes accompany something else that evokes sour fruit and tannins (think quinine from tonic water, perhaps), with a hint of butter (diacetyl?). The total package is just a hair thicker than the usual aggressively carbonated lager. Leaves a nice sheetweb lacing on the glass. If this could be found in bottles here I'd gladly pony up the extra dough the next time I need a 6-pack of yard beer. Like an AAL crafted to have more floral, spicy hop notes and none of that cloying artificial sweetener character. You'll obviously be able to find more aggressively hopped lagers if you are so inclined, but this take on an American classic hits crisp and refreshing clear out of the ballpark despite a slightly thicker mouthfeel.","CalgaryFMC","Apr 13, 2014"

Pours crystal clear pale golden amber color with a 1-2 finger fairly dense white head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of lemon, pear, apple, cracker, bread, herbal, floral, grass, light pepper, and herbal/yeast earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance of malt, hop, and yeast ester notes; with solid strength. Taste of lemon, pear, apple, cracker, bread, herbal, floral, grass, light pepper, and herbal/yeast earthiness. Slight earthy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of cracker, bread, pear, apple, herbal, floral, grass, light pepper, and herbal/yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very pleasant, clean, and well balanced malt, hop, and yeast ester flavors; with solid robustness without feeling watery, and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth and crisp mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a nice pale lager style. Well balanced hop, malt, and yeast ester flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A nicely enjoyable offering.","superspak","Feb 22, 2014"

Chewy and airy, balanced and zesty – a lager to sink your teeth into. It is first and foremost a showcase for pure malt flavor – I involuntarily picture amber waves of grain when I take a sip. Bready and substantial, with a rich nuttiness like halva. The hops creep in, along with the bubbles, with their slightly soapy lemon-lavender flavor, to whip the malts into shape. Juicy. Refreshing.

Nicely hoppy, with a different hop profile than all the other hoppy CA beers out. If this is what beer was like in CA in the late 1800s, I'd be happy if this was all there was. I do think it would be better with food, and I'm thinking some stronger tasting seafood, as one is enough for me without food. Nice at the end of the day, but I'm not wanting another right now. Another tomorrow yes, and maybe another one the day after that, but not one right after the other. The only thing I didn't quite care for was the carbonation - but Lagers are supposed to have a bit more carbonation. I think it's just me wanting thicker and less carbonated beers lately.","damndirtyape","Oct 11, 2013"

3.75,2.2,4,4,3.5,4,3.75,"California Lager?!? It seems like a contradiction on terms to me, but I promise to give it a fair shake, as I do for every beer. This is a very carbonated beer, so even a gentle pour seems to create a lot of dense, pillowy, French-vanilla colored head which also gives the beer a pseudo-cascading effect as it settles. Color was a deep-gold with NE-quality clarity and once more, Croesus and King Midas were fighting over it, now joined in the fray by Mammon. I have no time for their antics, so I leaned in for a sniff. The nose was clean, very much a lager, with a grainy maltiness and a grassy hoppiness that put me in mind of a German Pils. Mmmm. Mouthfeel was soft, I mean like as in soft water and the taste was very grassy, very much Noble hops, although I was not getting the malt the way that I did on the nose. Finish was dry and refreshing, but I kept thinking that I wished that they had allowed the malt to play better with the grassy hops. Not bad, but I know several PA breweries that make lagers that I will stick with/to, at least for the time being.","woodychandler","Jul 13, 2013"

It smells and tastes like an IPA, not a lager. The grassy hops pervade the nose and leave a lingering potent bitterness that only IPA lovers would enjoy. Yes, there is substantial maltiness up front, but it is quickly overcome by the strong hops. If the hops were cut to about a quarter of the current level this would be an outstanding lager.","wattoclone","Jul 11, 2013"

Considering Anchor's bock, they over-hop their lagers. Again, not a BAD brew, but not a very good lager (especially considering the billing).","TheSSG","Jul 10, 2013"

Smell is sweet and malty with some grassy notes in there as well. Taste is also sweet and malty, slightly herbal and mildly bitter. Finish is very clean, lively carbonated and a lingering bitterness from the hops. Has moments of coming across like and English pale in flavor but has a light body.

3.86,5.2,4,3.5,4,4.25,3.75,"If I was purely rating to style, my score would be even higher. This beer is very clean, light and refreshing with no real off-flavors. On top of that, it doesn't cheat by loading the beer up with hops and comes in at a low price point. It's a good looking lager, too. Nice bright yellow-gold color with a creamy white head that sticks around for quite a long time. Perfectly transparent. The aroma is so clean that I'm not quite sure how to rate it. There's a little bit of sweetly yeasty, doughy malt flavor and a touch of floral/herbal hops, maybe a tad bit citric. The taste starts sweet with squeaky clean, fresh, bright malt. Quickly, an herbal hop bitterness combines with a tart yeast flavor to dry the beer out. The finish is lightly malt sweet with more hop flavor/bitterness and tart yeastiness. It reminds me of a toned down German pilsener with that refreshing hard water crispness. The finish particularly has a lingering mineral character. The beer drinks very easily and sits on the palate as light as can be. I'm not exactly about to run out to the store to buy more, but if I needed a macro lager substitute, I would go with this beer.","popery","Mar 10, 2013"
