"Comes out of the can a clear, bright, bubbly solar yellow with a thick and rather persistent snow-white head. Crisp, malty aroma has a sweet and fruity overtone, mainly pear. Flavor is crisp and malty with a grassy hoppy undertone and more than a hint of fruit. Smooth texture has good body and a fine fizz. A satisfying pilsner."
"Full of Noble German hop flavor riding crisp, clean water. Not much pilsner malt flavor"
""
"Nose of malt, grass, straw, floral, herbal, lemon. Taste lemon, floral, cereal, noble hops, malt. Nice Pils!"
""

"Good. Nothing mind blowing. But super sessionable."

"Poured a semi-clear golden body with a thin cap of white head that quickly dissipated. A classic looking lager, true to form and quite nice. Scents of lager yeast, Pilsner malt with a soft sweetness, fresh cut grass hop aromas, spicy, floral hops at lower, but discernible levels and a light sulphur aroma like in some German Pilsners. Overall impression of aroma is of a classic American-style Pilsner that comes across much like its German counterparts in aroma, with a nice balance of sweet malt and classic Noble hop style aromas. Very nice. Flavor begins lightly bitter with a grainy and softly sweet malt presence balancing and floral, spicy Noble hop flavors. This moves into a medium bitter middle with notes of grassy, floral, spicy Noble-like hops and a light sweetness from malt and a graininess. Finish is medium-dry with the Noble hop flavors continuing alongside light grainy malt and biscuit-like malt. Aftertaste is grainy and biscuit malt with a medium level of floral, grassy, spicy Noble hop bitterness. Overall impression of flavor is of a crisp, flavorful, straight forward Pilsner. It doesn't have a wealth of complexity, which is perfectly fine for the style. It is simply a straight-forward, easy to drink, classic beer. Mouthfeel is medium-light bodied with moderate carbonation and a smooth, creamy feel. Overall impression of mouthfeel is of a classic, true to style American Pilsner. Quite nice. Overall this is quite the nice treat. It is a crisp, refreshing, simple American Pilsner that is flavorful, fairly aromatic and quite pleasant on the tongue. It is very well executed and a fine example of a classic, and rather hard to find, American style. Highly recommended."

"Bottom line; a hoppier pilsner that is both sessionable and enjoyably complex. Bold tastes, much more here than your avergae pils. Good stuff."
""
"It has a sharp bite to it. It does have a floral character in the finish that gives it a bitter dryness. It's a ""different"" pils/pale lager. A raw pils/pale lager. More hops doesn't necessarily make a better beer. Even still, it was ""interesting"". A fine choice for a hoppier lager."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Perfectly executed, balanced and utterly pleasant Pilsner, though I was expecting some extreme hopping. A Pils to have it always in the fridge when you are craving the style. I would not trade this one by relatively boring traditional Pils."
""
""

""
""

"Mouth: Light bodied and heavily carbonated. Refreshing and effervescent. I think this can may have been slightly overcarbed, as it foamed when opened and is making me burp A LOT."
"American pils that wants to be German. Light side without appearing watery. A bit too mild but highly drinkable just the same."
""
"Avery Joe's Premium American Pilsner ---4/5."
"Pours very pale golden color with modest head that recedes to a thin layer within minutes. Nose is light but a little herbal, clean, perhaps floral and grainy. Lighter body but not watery. Sweet, soft grain comes through with floral hops to round things out. Short finish. Far superior to any adjunct lager, but seems a little uninteresting... even for this American Pale Lager style."
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a craft version of the fizzy yellow pils. It is straw colored and clear a thick white foam that recedes but persists. The malt comes across as crackery and the hops have some herbal and floral character. While both are present in the aroma, they are not strongly so; both become more apparent in the mouth. The sweetness of the malt is light; the beer leans more to hoppy bitterness. While not a flavor bomb, it also is not dumbed down. I find it tasty, to style, and quite refreshing."

""

""

"A tasty, pilsner-esque (I wonder why) pale lager, flavourful, and easy to put back in numbers, I presume. Just a bit of astringent gasohol (despite the low ABV) does well to bolster this impression, as well as pour water on this whole American concept of claiming ideas as their own."

"O- Pretty good take on a pilsner, I could definitely knock a few of these out."

"I will rank this amongst my very favorite in the the world of lagers as it tastes good, is light and easy but holds a different level of complexity for this style."

"A stand-up job. I must say, there are few beers this pale a color that I enjoy this much, short of Belgian pales and American wilds. Light, but sprite. So sessionable, it's ridiculous."
"O: a solid pilsner with some hops bite that is always appreciated"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Pretty impressed by the hoppiness and complexity of this beer for the style. It's nice to see craft beer companies putting out American Pilsners to give people a real taste of the style aside from the typical commercial garbage pilasters."
""
""
""
"Note: According to some websites, the date code on this could very well represent a brewed-on date of June 2011. I really doubt that a lager could hold up that long, but if it did: hell yes, Avery! Next time I’m in town I’ll have to try it fresh."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Overall the laquery-vinyl off flavor could just be a batch oriented occurence, but was very noticeable, especially upon warmer temps. May be just a bad batch, but otherwise would still garnish ordinary results from me."
""
""
""
""
"A pretty good pilsner overall. I would definitely have it again."

"Super drinkability, really like this one for the style, would buy this again during the dog days of Summer, which will be here in about 3 weeks :P"

"Poured into pint glass. Appearance is ridiculously pale, a few shades darker than water. Frothy white head forms and retains leaving splotchy markings on side of glass. The nose has firm cereal grain profile paired with light herbal hops and notes of lemon rind and grass. Taste is mild up front and has a grainy backbone that shines on the finish. Mouthfeel is feather light with moderate carbonation. Overall, a simple beer with mild flavor. Tastier than adjunct lagers, but not a whole lot going on."
""
""
"This is a nice, hoppy, refreshing lager. This is definitely a beer worth trying."
"Finishing sourness is a little off-putting. This is alright. I like the can."
""
""
"Poured into a Sam Adams glass, light head developed which lasted a short while and some modest lacing. Appearance was a slightly hazy, straw color. Aroma was of a light citrus, not much else. Taste was a slightly bitter citrus with a slight sour on the back. Mouthfeel was light and aftertaste was slightly bitter and sour."
""
"Pours very pale yellow color, but appearance recovers with a full creamy head. Head lingers well throughout consumption and leaves nice lacing on the glass. Aroma is pretty full pilsner hops - floral with some spices. Flavor is milder than the aroma - more floral and some spices with some pilsner presence."
""
""
"Tastes a little Adjunct-laden. Corn and apple?? Kind of weird..."
""
""
"Excellent, refreshing version of a pilsner. The best lager beer that I've tried. The appearance is clear and clean in the glass. The beer is smooth enough to drink from the can. The aroma gives a light bitter presence. The beer is crisp and smooth. The mouthfeel is not just refreshing, but more satisfying than you would expect. It is slightly richer and doesn't just wash past your palate."

"A couple of these and visions of summer are already dancing in my wintery head."

"O – This is a pretty good pilsner. It’s a little too hoppy for my liking. Easing back on them would probably do the beer some good, balancing out the bitterness with the malty sweetness. Still, it’s a pretty tasty and drinkable beer. I probably wouldn’t seek it out again due to the offsetting hoppiness, but I can never really complain about using too many hops."
""
""
"Seems like a basic pilsner style beer, nothing bad about it but not of the outstanding or noteworthy variety either."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall / Drinkability: A very interesting take on this style of American beer, and definitely quite hoppy. I'm not sure if it is as drinkable as the brewer claims, but I could see this beer pairing with a lot of American dishes as well, and I find it enjoyable enough that I wouldn't mind having another one another time....but not in one sitting. It's too hoppy and not light and refreshing enough. A good beer, but not a highly drinkable pilsener as described on the can."
""
""
""
""
""

""
""
"Overall - Rather flavorful for the lighter abv. but retaining a nice taste profile. Quite nice and easy drinking."
"The color is pale yellow. Fluffy white head. It is a b it cloudy and has lots of carbonation. The smell and the taste are both sweet and bitter. The sweet in the smell is the citrus hops, lemon. The taste has only a small hop bite, it could use a bit more.Very light and easy to drink. This is a good conversion from macro beer."
"D - This isn't doing much for me. I'm all for craft lagers, but American ""pilsner"" as a craft beer style just doesn't make sense to me. Pre-prohibition style or not, it's bland and kind of harsh and in the end it just isn't a very good beer."
"Overall: this one has a lot of nice flavors, they are just all understated which in turn really helps drinability."
""
"O: A great pilsner. One of the better ones I've had in a long time. Great drinkability."
"Cheers!"
""
""
"Decent brew, worth a try, but don’t expect anything special. Hops and crispness add to the drinkability and the overall worthiness of this offering."
""
""
""
""
"On tap at Avery’s tap room in Boulder, CO. Pours clear-golden with white, long lasting head and lively carbonation. Aroma is of pale malt and perfume hops. Body is light and very crisp. Herbal, perfume hops are balanced on the palate by biscuit malt. Finish is long and dry. Very nice Pilz."
""
"Avery Joe’s Pilsner: It’s a crystal clear bright yellow beer with light carbonation topped with a pure white head. Faint on the aroma. The flavor is dry all the way through with notes of lime and grapefruit on the finish. A good pils. Avery keeps rising in my estimation. They brew a great whit and fine IPA. All of their bomber offerings are wonderful. This pils keeps with the tradition."
""
""
""
"Overall: This is a sold APL beer from Avery. A nice alternative to my hoppy and high octane beer drinking. This was enjoyed very easily."
"This can of pilsner poured a clear medium dark golden color with a fine cap of foam. The aroma is citrus, pepper and grass mixed with pale malt. The malt more than sneaks through on the palate with clean bread and biscuit. The herbal bitterness speaks to the noble hops. This is a clean, solid pilsner."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a semi-clear straw yellow color with some bit particles floating about. Head shrinks to a thin lacing. Nice soft-like doughy grain aroma with subtle floral hop aroma. Tastes okay. Nice for a lager but nothing seems to pop. No flaws in this brew. Clean lager flavors. Nice & light. Decent beer."
""
"*Overall, this is a lager that has a good taste. The taste that separates it from any American adjunct lager is the slight spicy and hoppy finish. It's real thurst quenching and refreshing. Solid flavors. Got a can in clearance for $0.99, but did pay around $8.99 for a 6-pack once. That's the beer's only other downfall (the first being it's similar in flavor profile to an adjunct lager)."
""
"This is slightly above average for this cheesy category, but when it's so hot and dry, it has its virtues. From the 12 oz can bought at Grapevine in Denver."
"O-Pretty decent pilsner, nothing fancy to me at least."
""
""
"Notes: Excellent Pale Lager. Malt flavor is spot on and just enough hops to keep me interested. Clean and quenches my thirst. Great beer for a style that is often not that good."
""
"O: OK. Not worth $11.49 for a six-pack, that's for sure. But inoffensive and easily quaffed."
""
"Can enjoyed at Star Bar in Denver. Slightly hazed straw gold with sticky, white foam that clings to the glass. Gobs of hops all around - resinous, herbal, peppery, with some bright lemon oil. Firm bitterness that doesn't overwhelm the lean malt body. Assertively hoppy beer that manages to remain in balance with this sub 5% ABV beer. This is exactly what I expected from an Avery-brewed lager."
""
""
"A perfect beer for a hot day out in the sun or with BBQ. Definitely recommended!"
""
"O: One of the better pale lagers I've experienced, smooth with excellent flavor and fragrance, low ABV but strong in intensity"
"O) An alright pilsner. A too light and thin on the flavor."
""
""
"O= An impressive American Pilsner. I actually like this quite a bit. Super drinkable and yet complex enough to really be tasty. Check this one out and enjoy it on a summer day."
""
""
""
"D- Just got back from a long bike ride and this hit the spot. I imagine any sort of activity you need to cool down from this could be refreshing. It's so light and easy drinking it would be perfect almost anytime."

"Overall, this is a very well-made pale lager, and it might be one of my favourite go-to summer beers. It's refreshing, clean, and very sessionable. Well done Avery."
"O: A great beer, perfect for after working out in the yard and relaxing. Highly sessionable, and in general just a great lager. Well done."
"Notes: Drinkable definately great for a warm summer day. Cheers."
""
""
""
""
"An American Pale Lager with a good measure of good hops in it. Very nicely done."
""
""
"O- drinkable and light tasty pils ,not my 1st choice when in the mood for a pils but worth trying"
""
"Once again I’ve taken too long to try a beer I’ve seen for so long on the shelf. I will be buying a lot more of Avery Joe’s, especially with the warmer weather."
"Very pale yellow color with half a finger of head that did not last long before settling to a thin skim. A few bits of spotty lacing is left down the glass. Pale malt aroma with some bready and grainyness. Not picking up the hops. There is some bitterness in the flavor with a faint Noble hop flavor. What I do get is the pale malt and dry bread flavor. Nice and dry. Light body and the carbonation is far from lively. Nothing very exciting about this beer but it has nice clean, dry flavor that makes it very easy drinking."
""
"an uneventful pilsner here, but a well made one. pours a nearly clear straw yellow with a small white foamy head. smells like a beer, some lighter german style malts and some noticable yeast aroma, slightly fruity, not soapy like a hefe. flavor is crisp, with a reasonable hop bitterness on the back end. feel is nice, very very light and good with a big heavy greasy meal. good carbonation as well. overall not one of avery's more remarkable products, but its good for the lighter beer drinker in you life."
"Overall: Fairly decent, though, I preferred the recent Southern Tier Eurotrash Pils over this."
"Overall, this is a solid pils. Very drinkable with a good amount of flavor. I could slam a lot of these."
"Joe's Premium American Pilsner is quite good. The beer pours a clear golden color with this white head that is leaving some lacing. The smell is nil....common for the beer type. The taste is really good, very well balance lager with nice hop and malt. The mouthfeel is light to medium body with good carbonation. Overall very good...and definitely sessionable."
""
""
"OVERALL: To be fair, I can't drink this beer without comparing it to Oskar Blues' Mama's Little Yella Pils and I love that beer. The Joe's is a decent example of the style and I'll drink it again, but this is one of those rare occasions where Oskar Blues beats out Avery."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a nice clear yellow – it actually looks exactly like hard cider with a finger of foam. Head dissipates quickly leaving light lacing. Not a whole lot of aroma – kinda piney with a little lime zest. Light bitterness that coats the tongue, not overwhelming, a very smooth drinkable beer. A good mouthfeel – light, perfectly carbonated. Overall, drinkable... I could dig this on a summer day."
"O- A pleasant smooth nice little hoppy pilsner. Pretty good all around."
""
"O- This beer is surprisingly average. I was expecting more."
"O: This is a pretty decent little pale lager, but it is a bit rough around the edges. In some respects, it just doesn't come together that well. I'm glad I tried it, but I doubt that I will revisit it in the near future."
"I recall having this in a can a year or so ago and being unimpressed, but having it on tap makes me think I may have been a bit premature in my judgement. A good pils example."
"I think I know the guy on the can from somewhere... Anyway, this stuff pours a clear pale straw topped by a nice finger of white foam. The nose comprises very mild wheat, sweet flowers, grass, and the smallest possible touch of minerals. The taste brings in more of the same, though the flowers may come off a bit sweeter here (not enough to elicit true sugary sweetness or anything, mind you). The body is a hefty light, with a light moderate carbonation, a decidedly smooth feel, and a very clean finish. Overall a damn good pils, probably one of the best American takes on the style I've yet come across. It just goes down so smoothly, so cleanly, so nicely..."
"Clear yellow in color with an impressive inch and a half of head, slightly sticky lace. Smell is of typical skunk Pils Malt, a touch of citrus pine and grains. Taste is very clean of a pilsner with a slight bit of hopping and no aggressive grains or malts. Clean Tasting. Mouthfeel is light but very drinkable. Overall not my favorite style but another win for Avery since it's a very tasty Pilsner."
"This beer pours a clear pale golden color. The head is one inch in height, and recedes quickly into a nice cap of lacing. The aroma is of bready malt with spicy hops, and a hint of grapefruit. The taste is a bit hoppier than the aroma with the malt backing this up. There is a nice lingering spiciness that I really enjoy. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with a smooth texture, and lively carbonation. Overall, this is a really good beer that I will certainly drink again."
""
""
"Dr: Quite drinkable, but a bit boring. Certainly drinkable, but far from exemplary. I'd have it again, but I wouldn't look forward to it too much."
"Overall: For an American-style Pale lager (not a Pilsner, Helles, Dortmunder, etc.), this is definitely the best I have ever had. I am drinking a single can of this during the bitter month of January, but may need to get a six pack come summer."
"D - This is one I'll be coming back to. Sessionable, high quality, and flavorful without being overbearing."
"Overall: A pretty solid take on the style. Nice use of hops for a pilsner. Easy drinking and flavorful."
""
"OK but nothing special."
""
"Overall pretty solid and enjoyable to drink"
""
""
""
""
""
"Opinion: Overall this is a pretty darn good beer in a sea of mediocrity. It still isn't my favorite style, but this is a good example of one. All this coming from a guy who has drank four of these already, so it must not be that bad. If you drink ""the big three"" or know someone who does...this may be a good stocking stuffer this Christmas."
""
""
""
"It's a light golden color with a finger of white head, tons of carbonation. Aroma is brightly hoppy, and the taste follows with crisp malts and floral hops. A solid American-style pilsner, for sure. The mouthfeel is very crisp and highly carbonated, with just a bit of drying feel. The drinkability is very, very good. Overall, a great beer that I'm going to be keeping around, probably going to be rotating with Noble and Prima Pils in my fridge all year round."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I personally hate to sound like a critic but few pilsners have wowed me. Avery does make incredible beers and like all breweries you need to satisfy all types of clientelle. ""Joe's"" is a pretty good beer but personally I would prefer something little more hoppy and little fuller taste."
""
"As far as an American pale lager goes, it's pretty good. In terms of beer overall? Well, meh, it's clearing a very low bar. It's not too bad, and I like that it has genuine hop characters to it, but it's certainly below par when it comes to the ""Avery"" measure."
"This hoppy, refreshing lager is ideal after some heavy eating at Thanksgiving, though I prefer the more traditional style."
""

"From the can marked 1124581-10:46268. Sampled on November 18, 2011. The pour is a pale straw yellow with a burst of fizzy head that lingers longer than other pilseners but eventually goes to a ring. Grains, malts, and sugars are noted in the aroma right off with a clean hoppy character too. The body is thin to medium which is just about right. Grains and sugars in the taste are followed by a clean hopped ending. This is a likeable Pilsener and much more conducive to the style."
""

"A decent American pilsner, a bit strong in the carbonation and lemon."
"O: A nice drinking Pilsner, but not one of my favorites thus far. The overall flavor profile is a bit lacking in depth, but perhaps that was the style from these olden times that this beer harkens back to, so who knows?"
"Overall: I guess I expected more out of this beer. Could use a little more sweetness and hops."
"D/O- Reviewed to style. Very drinkable with just enough of a hop profile to keep it interesting for the style. Would recommend to a BMC-type loyalist."
"Grabbed at beerforia in Boise id."
"O- The taste is the main area this beer scores, and it's mainly due to the creativity. Glad to see a twist on a traditional style."
"I'd recommend it to a friend who wants a fun, distinct, unique and drinkable beer with a bit of a kick."
"O - Quickly becoming a hot weather go-to brew. Quite a nice beer at the end of a long weekend."
"This is a decent beer but certainly not exceptional."
"Drinkable and starts off great, but the finish is lacking indeed."
"I'm glad to have this but it isn't a sessionable beer like it lays claim to."
"3.5 D: Pretty standard clean, refreshing pale lager. Good flavors, but nothing too impressive."
"Pours a slightly hazy light yellow with a 2 inch fizzy white head that settles to a small cap. Random dots of lace form on the glass on the drink down. Smell is of grains and some grassy hops. Taste is of sweet grain and some herbal and grassy hops on the finish. Medium hop bitterness lingers on the tongue after each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp and clean mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good lager with a nice hop punch but nothing all that special."
"Moonlight's Reality Czeck cannot be bought in a 6-pack, and until it is, Joe's Premium American Pilsner is the best 6-pack American yellow lager that I can buy, and don't worry I didn't forget about Prima Pils. Avery didn't pussyfoot around this one, future 6-pack purchases await!"
"This pilsner is an absolute delight to drink! Ideally formulated with the well exectured malt flavor and dryness to the assertive yet restrained hop balance, and then with the clean refreshing finish that all Pilsners require. An exquisite beer on all levels."
"Thin but creamy bone white head of moderate staying power, a minute or so later dissolves off to a dusting across the surface, the lacing forms a solid sheet at first but it too doesn’t stick around long. Mild cloudiness to the otherwise brightly glowing yellow hued liquid, scattered tiny bubbles throughout. The nose has a sharp profile to it, salt and pepper along with sour lemons and a pinch of dried lawn grass, more earth than dough or bread, barest hint of apricot but no real fruit presence nor is there anything you’d really call sweet per se, deepens into the nostrils well. Medium-bodied, highly carbonated but tightens up into little pinpricks as it progresses through the palate. Grains, grass, earth, minerals and iron flecks predominate, more biting and bitter than fresh, although does invigorate. White grapefruit joins the lemon citrus and a slight uptick in the apricot, peach, red apple fruit department. Some sourdough to rye bread notes. Hard to discern a meaningful sweet malt presence. Certainly very active and energetic, however, not a beer you can easily relax with."
"Overall: A very relaxing pilsner for sure. I can definitely drink these at a football game. Nice and light tasting pilsner. Love the look of this beer. Cheers!"
"This is certainly not for everyone, especially someone hoping for a light flavorless adjunct lager."
"American breweries suck at pilseners and it is a joke that people think this is good for a pils. Sure it stands up to a bud, but it is a dud."
"O: Very dissapointed with this brew, especially after trying out some of the other offerings from Avery. I definitely will not revisit this one and will steer others clear of it. I'm really not a fan of American pale lagers, but this was advertised as a German-style pilsener so I expected something quite different. Hopefully I just got a bad batch and it's not as bad as what I got. Cheers!"
"M: Crisp and light bodied as this type of beer should be. Above average finish for this style."
"Overall a very nice ""American PIlsner"""
"Overall Impression- If Gatorade wasn't around, this would be the Thirst Quencher of our new Generation! Refreshing, very light, and easy to drink. I could go for many more of these!"
"The beer, poured from a can, appeared a nice, clear golden color that produced a nice big, foamy white head that had decent retention. The beer gave off a nice hoppy aroma, floral and earthy with a hint of grain. The taste of the beer is good...a well-balanced beer with both the grain and the hops present. The beer is light bodied, dry, crisp and very easy to drink. Overall, a very good beer and possibly a second choice after Victory's Prima Pils."
"O - An excellent pilsner! Delicious on a hot summer day, or any time you want to drink a few beers but not be hungover because of a high abv"
"Overall: this is a strongly sessionable Pilsner of which I am sure I could consume a lot. I'm actually quite pleased with it."
"O: Hard to believe this is fresh, but it's also hard to know the difference (hint, hint). This is my last one."
"Not a great pilsner but definitely a good one made for summer pleasures with the six-pack of cans."
"Fairly simple, but enjoyable. A nice everyday beer. Not the best lager I have had, but a good summer beer. Overall something I would recommend."
"O - This is a pretty good lager. It makes a nice summer drinker."
"O- As pilsners go, not my favorite, like i said above, not bad but not great. Hops really dominate every aspect of this beer and as a result becomes a bit monotonous IMO. i doubt i will be buying this again."
"Quenching and suited well for hot weather sessions and barbecues."
"Plain and simple, this is what I want in an American Pale Lager. Well done Avery and thank you."
"Poured from 12 ounce can into a tulip. Straw yellow in color. Good clarity. Fluffy white head, good retention, mild lacing. Aroma is lemony with a touch of malt sweetness. Taste is biscuity, not very hoppy, not too sweet. Not a tremendous amount of flavor but it is there in just the right amount to make this tasty and very, vertpy easy to drink. Excellent gateway offering by avery."
"For those that like a lager/pilsner with some extra ‘ooomph’ this is the brew for you! This brew pours up a vibrant straw colored body (almost like Mello Yello!) and a nice fizzy head that tapers down quickly to a thin film and leaves minimal lacing on the sides of the glass. Strong aromas of hops hit you right upon opening. Flavors filled to the brim with hops (if you like bitter then you will like this brew!) followed up with a slightly sweet, somewhat biscuit-like flavors and finish. Very light bodied and easy to drink."
"Went up to the Meretrix release Saturday afternoon and saw this one offered on cask. I'd never had a cask lager before so I gave it a shot. Poured a nice light golden color with a big fluffy white head. Good hoppy aromas, lead to a light bodied and somewhat hollow palate, with light biscuit and hop flavors."
"D- I like a hoppy pils, but the bitterness should pull back about half way through and not wear out it's welcome. Still very glad I picked this one up."
"This pours a light straw like color with a large foamy white head. The smell is of floral hops, sweet malts. The mouth feel is medium light and crisp. The taste is good, some bitter hops (more than most pilsners), a little bit of biscuit malts, a bitter after flavor. Overall a decent beer, I'm not sure how I feel about it compared to other pilsners and for a session beer I prefer ales anyways, not bad though I'm willing to try it again."
"The summer season for pilsners kicked off this year with Avery's Joe Pils, canned for your camping convenience, and wrapped in aluminum for easy chilling in your refrigerator, a stream or a lake. Wherever you take this beer, this beer takes you to a wonderful and cooling place, crisp and lively with all the flavors of summer. The head is light and fluffy, like a rolling summer cloud, with an intensely cloudy body reminding me more of a witbier than a crystal clear pils. The aroma has a light touch of hops, more assertive than other pilsners, light and crisp and refreshing even in the nose. It's a medium bodied beer, with a sharp carbonation. The flavor starts with a bite of flowery hops, carried by a roiling stream of carbonation. The pilsner astringency is well matched against an alcohol bite. Also, not a touch of skunkiness or sulfur. I suspect the opacity of the can helps here, but whatever the reason, this is a local and very refreshing take on a classic and cooling style. I'd love to learn more about the 'classic' and 'contemporary' elements in the Joe Pils."

"Summer is here, and so is the beer for it. This is a great hot weather, “lawnmower” beer. If I do any camping this summer, some cans of this will be in my cooler."
"Tweak the flavor of this (a different kind of barley? Ease up on the hops?) and you have a good craft pilsner. As it stands now, it's a beer I want to like but fails in its execution."
"O: Goes down easy, very tasty, not filling, no kick, pretty good representation of style. I could totally hit this one up for an evening."
"Overall, I really like this beer. It's nothing flashy or too exciting but it works on many levels. It's got a good amount of bitterness for a hophead like me but drinks so clean and easy that one could easily finish a six pack on a nice summer day. Would definitely recommend for fishing/camping or tailgating."
"Crisp yet smooth, Joe's Premium American Pilsner makes me wish my grandfather favored beer over bourbon. This is the kind of beer I should be so lucky to stock with regularity in my fridge."
"Pours a pale, straw yellow. Mostly clear, with gobs of carbonation. A white head stays low and patches the glass nicely. Smell is very fresh, noble hops. Sweet, too. Taste starts off with a scoop of surprisingly bready malt before rising up to the tart, tight hops. Overall a very ""green"" tasting brew. Finishes dry and crisp. Feel is excellent. A darn good beer here!"
"Pours a light straw body with a generously apportioned white head that clings nicely to the glass. Aromas are grassy but mostly characterless. Tastewise, this beer is pleasantly hop-forward from beginning to end in a way that makes it thoroughly refreshing and palate cleansing to an array of vegetable and seafood dishes. It's body has a weight that I didn't expect, but made its palate-cleansing properties all the more pronounced. This is not your typical pisner. It's better."
"You can drink this stuff like water. It's not really my style but it is good for what it is."
"Very hoppy for a pilsner, but it’s a damn good beer. Highly drinkable, very sessionable. Only problem, this beer is too pricy."
"I'd drink a handful no problem."
"Crystal clear and a little darker than straw yellow. The soapy white cap lingered and produced a bit of spotty lacing. Lemony hops with some floral and herbal components, faint malty aroma. Solid bitterness, soft malt flavour, lemony and spicy hops, a bit floral. The carbonation was soft rather than crisp, light bodied, decent texture. Overall, pretty good, refreshing with some tasty hops."
"Fades a bit in the feel department. Bit of a citric finish and with little to speak of for redeeming pils qualities. A bit of a watery wanderer in the end."
"D: definitely a hopped up pils. on the nose and on the start of the palate. wish it was backed by some more malt. too watery in my opinion."
"Mouthfeel is creamy and slick, with light carbonation, a light body and a slight bitter finish. A very tasty session beer that went down easy; an any time/any where beer."
"Overall, this is a fine pilsner. The beer works well on all levels, giving it a unique drinkability for the style. It is slightly sweet, but balanced well with some good bitterness. The beer's clarity is superb, and a good drinking beer all around."
"O: Tasty, goes down very easily, not too filling, mild kick, good representation of the “American Pilsner” style, this is a nice poundable beer worth drinking for a long time."
"O - a very good example of an American Pilsner."
"This was great overall. I'm in the deep south, so there's nothing quite like a crisp, hoppy lager on a sweltering day, and I'm a damn sucker for em' when I find em! This is one of the best I've had!"
"A very drinkable and flavorful Pils, not much aroma so perhaps a good candidate to drink straight from the can."
"Good beach beer, a little expensive though."
"Drinkability isn't all that great, just a little too much bitterness here."
"O: Pretty good overall"
"Two fingers of fluffy white head over a very light straw golden. Foam retains and there's good lacing. Aromas are big bitter hop aromas. Flavor is very clean, bitter florals are heavy on the palate. The hops completely dominate the malts at first, and almost through to the end of the glass. Medium carbonation and a light mouthfeel make this beer incredibly drinkable."
"A solid pilsner. Its dangerously close to Prima Pils. I'd have quite of few of both in a day, if I could."
"This was a flavorful and easy drinking take on a Pale Lager with that alcohol content being right where it needs to be to make sure that you could have a couple of these in a sitting. This was a good selection by Avery to put in a can."
"I agree with others that this beer is too expensive . I was under the impression is costs distributors and brewers less money to can beer than to bottle."
"An excellent lawn mower beer to be sure but there's just not much here. Definitely not a top of the line pilsener."
"As far as an American-style pilsner goes, this has to be up there with the best. This will make for some fine beach refreshments this summer."
"GOOD STUFF, WORTH TRYING!"
"Nice drinking beer. Clean and flavorful without lots of carbonation of too crisp a feel. Nothing wrong with that; just a nice change of pace. As an American Pale Lager this is choice."
"D: While the mouthfeel was good, but not perfect, the flavor was excellent. Really solid beer."
"So excited to see more and more craft cans around this area, especially as the weather warms up. Poured this one into a pint glass. Pours a straw-yellow with slight haze to it, and a good 2-finger white head on top. This sticks around for almost the entire drink, and leaves plenty of sip rings in its wake. The nose is pretty basic with some lemon zest, pineapple, cut grass. The mouth is spritzy and palate-cleansing. Refreshing feel, really. Good crisp flavors with plenty of citrus and sharp hops on the finish. Clean and refreshing. Perfect beer for the upcoming blistering months."
"Notably thin bodied (even for a pilsner). The flavor starts with a modest grainy malt taste. The swallow and aftertaste are very bitter for the style--lots of peppery hop. High carbonation gives t his brew a spritzy feel. Overall, it is head and shoulders above the macros but it still has some of those elements (thin bodied, spritzy and grainy malt). The hop gives it a dose of character. In short, this is not a subtle pils."
"O: This is delicious and refreshing. It is worth purchasing a 6 pack of this."
"Lighter body, with good carbonation. Very easy to drink. A very well made beer."
"First of all i love these little cans and the brew pours a very light see through yellow dusk hue with beautiful carbonation that leaves behind a two finger head and lacing everywhere,the smell is only average with hints of salami,pale malts and herbal,grassy hops,it has a light bodied well carbonated mouthfeel that has tastes of pungent floral hops firstly followed by some pale,biscuty malts and then the floral,herbal hops come through again and you can tell it is nicely hopped and the finish is quite dry and moreish and overall its a brew that doesnt really rate ultra high with me for memorability factor but i would love a sixer of this in the fridge just for its drinkability/session factor and i will buy again."
"O - This is a beer that could easily be consumed, a lot, over the summer...it's portable, balanced, crisp, and refreshing...a nicely done pilsner by Avery"
"In the pint Avery's pilsner looks light straw gold with barely a whimper in terms of even a cap on tap, looks rather dead, no stick because there is nothing to stick. Smell is fairly simple, earthy with noble hops out the wazoo and some pale malts in there. The taste is str8 forward simple, floral with German hops and American abundance of volume in using these hops, in a word, alot. Pale malts. Light bodied and refreshing after a brisk walk in NYC. While not carbed up in looks, this beer is certainly not dead, crisp. a great simple beer."
"Overall, I'd recommend it in the right situation. I think it'll be a superior refreshment in the summer and good for cutting through the heat of spicy dishes. It's easy to enjoy though not as easy to remember."
"This is really solid pils and definitely one of the best brewed outside of PA that I have had. Avery is consistently one of my favorite breweries and this is another solid offering. Tasty and drinkable, and bonus points for coming in cans."
"The beer pours a very light, clear yellow color with a white head. The aroma is that of a basic pilsener. I get a lot of pils malt as well as some grain notes and a little bit of grass. The flavor is heavy on the pils malt along with some grass and orange citrus notes from the hops. I also get a little bit of spice and the bitterness is low to medium. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. A very nice American-made pils."
"o: a reasonably nice pilsner overall, the spice is strange and it's a little light in aroma/flavor, it's a little soft and smooth - that is to say not as crisp and snappy as I like the style, still worthwhile all told"
"D: Very drinkable, this could be my favorite pilsner."
"o - Overall a nice pilsner from Avery. Crisp and easy to drink, something I would have again if I were in the mood for a pilsner."
"D - Drinkable. Beery. I don't know if I'd want to drink a 6 of all these."
"Fairly good pilsner, highly drinkable especially if you appreciate the bitterness. I wish there was more flavor in the middle of the drink, the nose got me really excited for what this could be. Wouldn't pass it up but I can think of a couple Colorado lagers that can top it."
"Overall? This is a decent take on the Pilsner style that manages to be something different than its Czech and German progenitors. It's a worthwhile Summer purchase, especially if you can't buy Prima Pils where you live."
"Overall if you are a Pilsner lover I would recommend this one over any of the other's offered at Avery its pretty solid"
"This is an easy drinking beer with flavors of grains and cereals with an assertive hop snap on the finish. The presence of German Noble hops is unmistakable. We got a flavorful pilsner here."
"Not as grassy as I expected which is nice, It's got a slight hazy yellow appearance with a good amount of bubbles. Big fluffy white head. Aroma is grainy, there seems to be a bit of a hop kick in the flavor of this brew as well. Not overly bad. It's much better than most Pilsners but still just a Pilsner to me."
"D/O - Easy drinking, even if it isn't categorized as a pilsner, I see it as such. ABV is very manageable. Despite the strong bitterness for the style, i dont' fit it overwhelming."
"Pricey for what it is. Very much lacking. :/"
"D - pretty tasty for such a ""small"" beer. solid amount of hops and pretty good balance, yet goes down very easy."
"Poured into a pilsner a very light straw color with a fluffy one finger crown atop,multiple broken rings of lace were left behind as it settled.Herbal hops,lemon oil,and crushed malt aromas,lighter but pleasant.A healthy does of herbal hops stand out most on the palate mixed with a sturdy toasted malt bill,a lot of flavor in a ""small"" package.This to me is like a north German pilsner in a way with its sharp hop profile,its hefty malt bill goes great with it.A wonderful beer to have while grillin outside like I will be today."
"O: This is a prime example of a craft lawnmower beer. It's got summertime written all over it. Low ABV, big drinkability. On a hot and sticky day, pass me a Joe's."
"D: The lightness and mouthfeel are very nice. The taste isn't so great to me. The grassy hops are nice at first, but their is a sharp, bitterness that over powers and hangs over the malt in the after taste which I'm not so fond of."
"D-Solid, certainly nothing crazy here, but an aggressively hop and rather tasty and pleasant drinking American slanted light lager. A nice beer to have around for backyard BBQ's and family picnics."
"Drinkability: With the bright and spicy hop flavor and light body, this is very drinkable and enjoyable."
"D: considering the flavorful taste, great balance and relatively low ABV, this is session ready. Nice beer to ring in the spring and stick with in the summer."
"Had a can after work on Friday. Wow, I'm not sure what's so American about this at first with the big kick of spicy lemon herb hops. I suppose the malt is a bit more grainy and dry than a German pils. I love a good IPA or pils, but the bitterness here is just a touch close to astringent. Otherwise this is a heck of a pilsner."
"DB- Sort of a hard beer to go about reviewing. The flavors are fairly straight forward and light. A little bit sweet for me but pretty balanced and drinkable."
"I say clean, though it's not perfectly so. The mouthfeel is good, though, with an appropriate light-medium body and good crispness leading to an adequately smooth finish. Dry is the operating word here."
"Quite a clean nose, but hints of actual flavor are peeking through, toasted grains and pungent hops. And indeed it proves to be quite tasty, not too mention surprisingly full-bodied. Crisp and easy-drinking, but those hops are quite potent, earthy at first, then quite bitter in the finish. As a pilsner, this would get decent marks. As an American pale lager, it's pretty damned good."
"I hope to find this beer in the summer because it should be a very drinkable option during the hot weather. I noticed the picture featured a can, which makes it that much better."
"Overall: I think Avery achieved a good balance that helped me answer the questions I stated above. This beer has elements of European lagers, but it is distinctively unique and way better versions of BMC swil-style adjunct lagers. It has a sweetness that is subdued and a hoppiness that is strong enough to achieve balance, but not take over. This isn't a great beer, but it is a good beer."
"OK Avery, I hope you are reading this. I know there is a huge hop following, and many hop heads all over the place, and there's a big contest for who can bitter their beer the most, or cram the most hop profile. But there's a time and place for hops, and a hop profile for each style. I understand trying to break down the walls and expand the various styles, but this is just overboard. A nice pilsner with some light noble hops, something like Noble Pils actually, adds a nice touch to it. This, however, i just waaay to much. I'm a hophead actually, I love hops in many ways, but when I'm drinking a pilsner, I don't want my hops to overpower it so much I think I'm drinking hop juice! A pilsner is delicate and sessionable, a summer/spring beer mostly, but this just smacks it in the face and drags it out to the curb to be runover by the bus and have the neighbors dog piss on it, piss a golden shower of hops... OK maybe a little too much imagery, but seriously, too much!"
"D - There is good drinkability here. It goes down smooth, and has good flavor. There is a little more bitterness than I'm used to in a pilsner, but it's good."
"For fans of Tuppers Hop Pocket pils and Sam Adams Noble Pils."
"D: Definitely the best fizzy pale lager I've ever had. Both thirst-quenching and flavorful."
"D: easy drinking, smooth beer great tasting, this is a tasty brew well done extreamly clean..."
"Even calling this an ""American Pilsner"" is a misnomer. This is a lager that has a bit of malt but lacks the hops and crispness of anything remotely resembling a pilsner. With that said, this wasn't a terrible beer and had no obvious flaws in the brew process. I wouldn't have a problem with this beer if it were simply classified as a pilsner; however, Avery decided to use ""pilsner"" in the name. I think it's better-classified as an American Pale Lager, which has been done here on BA."
"D: This beer is very easy to drink and can be considered sessionable. I would definitely try this again if I am looking for something that's light-bodied and has a lot of bitterness."
"The mouthfeel is very crisp and light with a higher level of carbonation. This beer goes down easily, and is definitely enjoyable to drink."
"Lingering hop presence throughout. Good flavor for a lager. Session-worthy. Would pair nicely with a round of spicy appetizers or throw in a cooler for some float-fishin' and some homemade deer jerky."
"On tap at the brewery. Pale yellow, malt aroma, IBU a significant 42 and it's tehre and felt. Lacey, hoppy. arbonation is there though not obtrusive. Average muthfeel, a good American style pilsner. Served a little cold, as it would be at most bars."
"D: Overall, a well done, drinkable beer. This would be a good brew for the summer."
"Would I buy more of it? - absolutely! I'm bummed that this was my only one. I need more for when all the snow melts and its time to barbecue."
"All in all, Joe's Premium American Pilsner is a refreshing, natural-tasting pilsner with a slight bitter hop finish. Quite a radically different take on the American Pilsner."
"This is a really smooth drinking, enjoyable beer. I can see it being a big hit at the beach in a few months."
"Not too shabby. Certainly better than the last Avery beer I had (Karma). If Avery can maybe tweak the flavor a little, this one could take on Prima as my favorite for the style. If you like a pilsener to be a little hoppier, this one will be right up your alley."
"D: The hops seem really out of whack here, almost like someone accidentally added the flavor and aroma hops all at the bittering addition, and said "" ah screw it, I'm sure it will turn out fine.."" It's not bad, it just doesn't jive with me."
"The Crack reveled yet another craft beer filled to the brim with beer! The Glug looked like pale yellow (ahem!) running into the glass, resulting in two fingers' worth of fluffy, bone-white head with great retention. Color was a slightly hazy lemon-yellow, in total, it resembled lemonade. The nose danced, no, sparkled with grassy, lemony Noble hops. Hot damn! Yep, PapPap's beer would have been the Prohibition- era (or after) swill that we are still stuck with. Mouthfeel was medium but the hops were unencumbered, filling my mouth and sinuses with a grassiness that made me long for summer (or the next visit to my dealer). I initially pooh-poohed lager-style beers until somebody turned me onto classically- made beers, vice AALs. This was fantastic! Tasty, dry on the finish, refreshing, no off flavors. I would take an entire cooler full of this to the beach!"
"Subjectively, I don't like it. Objectively it is a very nice example, well made and appealing. I suspect that Pilsner lovers will find this a very good American example."
"Amazing balance, nice hop bitterness, again earthy, with grassy finish, cereal and biscuity malts. Crisp, refreshing and slighlty creamy. Tremendous carbonation and way to drinkable. Great rendition by Avery."
"D- High. Wish I could get this... would be a perfect summertime beer. Light and easy drinkin' with a nice hop snap."
"Overall: A mediocre at best pilsner."
"Overall a tremendously tasty pils that was a pleasure to drink. Highly quaffable."
"D: Very refreshing and easy drinking, good pils."
"Slainte."
"Very refreshing, though not quite cutting - a very good domestic example of a German classic...certainly gives Prima Pils a run for the money!"
"O: Interesting new take on a style. This is probably not a Czech Pils, and should not be rated as such. And, at 4.7, It's also not an imperial pils (like the other entry), so this really belongs in a new category. Rather hoppy and quite refreshing, I'll definitely drink Joe's next summer while grilling, and consider it in food pairings in the winter."
"This beer is crisp, light, refreshing, and bretty. Very bretty. The dry finish leaves my palate with a blank feeling of dry funk. Like I had been sucking on a piece of wood. I asked if this was the beer I ordered and she brought be 2 more ounces to be sure. I've read the other reviews of this beer (all in the can) and I can't reconcile their descriptors with mine. But this is the beer I was served and it was fermented, at least partially with Brettanomyces."
"Super pale straw golden color, forms thick white head with fine even bands of lacing. The nose gives off herbal citrus grassy notes, hints of pungent German hops going on. Light malt biscuit cracker barely any sweetness noticed. Super dry finish, upfront barrage of green hops from the can. A nice flow with each gulp a couple of these cans could vanish so easily. Nice cracker light pale malts provide just enough sweetness with a big bitter hop profile with citrus/grassy/herbal accents kicking around on the palate. Hop burps are plentiful carbonation is ample , again great experience drinking out the can. This isn't as good as the authentic German pils from PA, but these would definitely be people interst in living and restoring."
"The mouthfeel is accentuated by bubbly carbonation while the light to medium body and heavy malt makes it feel creamy as well. There is no discernible booze at all, which makes this at the top of the drinkability spectrum. A great new entry to the craft Pilsner market and a beer I plan on enjoying on a regular basis in the near future."
"D: Not a bad stab at the style, but a bit out of balanced, seems disjointed."
"Wow. Like that, a game-changing beer is born, demanding to be heard. ""This is Premium American Pilsner."" I couldn't agree more. Thank you Avery, thank you for making a Pilsner with balls."
"Overall, not bad for a pils. It's probably the hoppiest pilsener I've had. I like all the hops and the lower alcohol - could make for a nice session beer."
"D: This was a nice offering, but the grapefruit citrus flavors felt a bit too far out of style. Overall I'm glad I had it."
"Overall a really enjoyable beer. I wish it wasn't quite so expensive. $9 is a lot for a 6-pack of pils in cans."
"Not really my favorite and probably one I won't keep going back to, but I can imagine this being a BA favorite."
"D- I still feel like I'm not ""there yet"" when it comes to pilsners, but damn I am trying! I really like all the bright flavors, maybe I would turn down the soapy a tad. But probably one of my favorite pilsners so far."
"The color is a bright gold that is as clear as you can imagine. The head is amazing - Joe's doesn't produce head it produces a continuous stream of creamy meringue that climbs out of the glass. I've never seen head like this on any beer. The nose is strongly floral from the tons of noble hops. Flavor is very bright with loads of herbal German hops to extent that it makes a good Czech Pils seem not very hoppy in comparison. There is a nice breaddy malt backbone to keep the hops in check and the finish is clean without any off character. Superb."
"Great beer. Tops in my book."
