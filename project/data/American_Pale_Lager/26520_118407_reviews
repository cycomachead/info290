"No surprise for me here with Jacks Abby delivering another solid brew to the MA market. Calypso and Citra seem to compliment each other well bringing plenty of fruit but also nice floral and herbal notes."

"O: Overall this is a fantastic American Pale Lager.  This is the way lager should be done.  Its light and flavorful with a very drinkable bitterness level.  Easily my favorite Pale lager to date, which I am following up a few days after having Kiwi Rising also by Jacks Abby.  I will continue to support this brewery for sure."
"O: This is very nice essay drinking beer I think it lacks a little in the flavor department but it's crisp refreshing and has a very rich full mouthfeel which was very surprising"
""
"Bitterness to it but smooth."
""
"On tap..Tropical and dank...very nice."

"Bottle might have been old, but wasnt impressed with the flavor. Everything we had on tap from Jacks Abby was great. This was lacking any flavor or aroma at all."
"This is a weird combination of hops that creates an interesting spectrum of fruit flavors. I definitely like it, and I would try it again!"
"Overall:  I like how this series is going.  Keep it up boys."

"The palate opens bright, clean and fruity with the Citra hops dominating, lending their tropical and pine characteristics, along with the more delicate melony notes. Pine, orange, lemongrass, melon, mango and papaya  are all present. Light in body with a crisp, cracker-like malt backbone, this beer has moderate carbonation which allows the hop flavor to shine. Supple with a pleasant oiliness, this feels great on the palate. An excellent beer"

"Raw bitterness up front through the long aftertaste. Quite spicy, almost like red pepper flakes. Full bodied."

"Had a draft of this delicious IPL and found it to be nicely carbonated, well balanced and not overly hopy. Full of citrus flavors I definitely tasted some orange in with the lemon and grapefruit. Definitely worth trying if you can get your hands on some!"

"O: Overall, excellent brew from Jack's Abby. Great hop flavor without the hop bitterness usually associated with this much flavor. Looking forward to the rest of the hopstitution series."

"A great hoppy lager, this one smells amazing and tastes pretty good. I poured 3 glasses from the growler, it did get better the more I drank it."

"On tap at New York Pizza. Pours a translucent dark yellow with an inch of head. Tons of lacing. The aroma is a big whiff of tropical and citrus fruits. Some light malt notes too, but mainly its the fruity hops. The taste is bitter citrus and tropical fruits upfront. Toasted malts with a bitter citrus peel finish.Some floral and grassy notes as well. Lots of carbonation with a bit of an oily mouthfeel. Overall, solid hoppy Lager I'll grab again."

"O-While not one of their standouts, this is another tasty treat from the Le Abby de Framingham."
""
"Overall pretty nice, about what I expected the last Hopstitution to be, but either that was not very fresh, or just a bad batch perhaps as this seemed more like what they and everyone else described. Quite nice, enjoyable, good hop profile, nice light lager base with dry crisp finish that lets the hops stand out, and they don't got overboard. Although, the finish gets a bit too bitter and spicy."
""
""
""
"Light, refreshing, pungent, delicious. Smooth finish, great balance. Well done"
""
"O - Overall, a very tasty APL here. Like what the Calypso hops brought to the table with that underlining melon/pear. Well done."
""
""
""
"Pours a light straw color, a bit hazy and a nice, modest head. The smell is fantastic. I was not expecting it to be so strong and deliciously hoppy! The taste doesn't quite live up, but it's still very good. Like other beers I've had from them, it's only in the taste that you can tell you're drinking a lager and even then, you can forget. This tastes like a great IPA, with a bit of lagery aftertaste. Body is good and overall, a very solid beer. I'd drink this regularly if it were available."

"O: Interesting hop combo. It's basically a citra IPL but with some pear poking its neck out here and there. It adds a nice layer of complexity and helps keep this from being a little one-note, even if it's somewhat subdued compared to the spiciness and tropical fruitiness of the citra. Tasty and refreshing. My only real knock is that the citra dominates a little too completely."
