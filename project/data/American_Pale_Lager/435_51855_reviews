"The only good thing about the flavor is that there is not much of it."
"Light Cabernet buttery flavors hit the tongue with bubblegum, grain and cereal malt. This is much sweeter than your average adjunct and that's not good."
"Notes: I was under the impression that this was a Trader Joe's beer, but perhaps not. Regardless, it's one of the worst beers I've found at Trader Joe's. It's sweetish with no hops, bitterness, or malt flavor... just a thin 'corn' note. It's inexpensive, which is great, but it's not good enough that I wouldn't pay more to get a better 'retro' beer (Genesee Cream Ale is just $12.99 for a 30 pack, which equals .43 a can!)."

"Grabbed a can for a buck on a whim, thought it would just be a pounder after playing hockey, but this is a syrupy, thick, poor brew."

"Rather sweet in the flavor.  Reminds me a bit of some of those strong Polish lagers like Tatra and Zywiec, except this one can't boast 6-8% abv.  Those also taste cleaner with more hop flavor in the finish, and are generally enjoyable to drink.  This one has a rather assertive, artificial generifruit gummy candy or jellybean fruitiness in the finish and no hops to balance things out.  Not particularly dry, and weak in mouthfeel and body.  The first couple sips were ok, but I'm wishing I didn't have 5 more of these to drink.  The carbonation starts out very lively, but gets fairly flat about halfway through, and you're stuck with something akin to a less than great apple cider.  Definitely the worst beer I've had in a while."

"O: Again, not a bad AAL/American Pale Lager but certainly not an interesting beer. Slight chemical flavors in the aftertaste. Easy enough to drink, best served ice cold."
"Bought as ""Name Tag"" from Trader Joe’s. Pours clear pale golden, with thin white head. Sweet malt, and corn on the aroma, taste is pure sweet grains, with a fading sweet finish. Finishes fast. Somewhat watery mouth feel. A pale lager through and through, but refreshing on these hot summer days."

"O: After the first two lagers from TJ ended up being not terrible, it kind of gave me hope for the others. Too bad two okayish lagers would lead into two horrid ones. I'll give the slight edge to this over the Trader Jose crap, but only just. They're both easy drainpours either way."
""
"O: In all seriousness this is a terrible beer. But again - as a corn cider its drinkable."
""
""
""
""
""
"I'd reach for a Name Tag lager before I picked up an American Budweiser, but I can think of a few unappealing American macro lagers that I'd reach for before picking up one of these again."
""
"Very, very bad. If I didn't have another five to finish, I'd say I'd never try it again."
""
""
""
""

""
"The Verdict: Meh. Another cheap beer from Trader Joe's, it's a step up from Old Milwaukee and the like but it's still a cheap beer. For the same price I'll take the much better tasting Simpler Times from TJs. This one is too thin and watery."

"Minhas Name Tag Lager ---2.5/5"
"I am glad this beer does not say “superior”, “private reserve”, or “best”, because it is truly not any of them. For the price this beer is great to try or cook with, but it is nothing special. I vote, buy a six pack, drink one or two and cook some brats with the remainder."

"The appearance and smell are just average (not like the cheap pee smell some sub $1 beers have). The taste is great. Not bitter. A touch of sweetness and very smooth."
"Pretty sweet and estery for a lager. Just too sweet."
""
""
""
""
"This beer seems like a lemony Bud Light, I'll have to pass on drinking any more of these but I think those Bud Light Lime drinkers might like it."

"O: Want apple juice that says it's beer? This is for you!"

""

""
""
"O: With appropriately low expectations, you'll probably agree that this hits its target: a cheap but drinkable lager."
"Not especially bad, but not very enjoyable"
"On the flip side, this mixes extremely well with Trader Joe's orange juice!"
""
""
""
""
"Coarse bubbles, but not unpleasant mouthfeel. In the cheap swill department there are better choices."
""
"I am a fan of less sophisticated beers like old style or hamm's, most likely due to fond college memories of drinking them. And I usually do not shy away from a beer just because of price. But I should have known, even in the land of ""two buck chuck"" that $3.99 a sixer was too good to be true."

"Poured this 12 oz can of Name Tag American Pale Lager into a pint glass. Poured a pale straw color produced a thin white head with poor retention and it leaves no lacing behind. The aroma was fresh and clean, grain and corn. No hop aroma to speak of. Light in body, this lager is sweet, a nice mouthfeel, not much taste or character. There is some grain flavor with the taste of corn. Overall, its decent- there are worse American lagers out there- but honestly, its not something that I would purchase again. Even for the 50 cents that I paid for this can....yes...i paid 50 cents. How about that for a man soda? Prost!"
""
""
"O: For 50 cents a can you cant do much better. Great to keep on hand for a hot summer day. Its refreshing and not awful, enough said for 2.99 a sixer."
""
"I see this is brewed in Monroe which was the longtime home of Berghoff beers. At one time Berghoff had an advertising campaign that used name tags (hello my name is Berghoff..) I wonder is this a riff on or homage to the old campaign?"
"Only good thing I can say is it goes down rather smoothly. But that's it. Like I said, for fifty cents a can you can't really expect anything spectacular. This is something I'd drink on the beach or on a hot summer day if I have nothing else around."
"O: well this beer provides an experience. I will leave it at that."
"PBR is a very rich beer compared to this stuff. Extremely light-bodied with a flavor (or lack thereof) to match. I suppose that for $3 for a sixpack, I can't be blamed too much."
"12oz can purchased at Trader Joe's in Portland, ME. Pours a very light yellow crystal-clear body with no head to speak of. Grains (similar to a Triscuit cracker) and the slightest hint of citrissy hops jump out of the aroma, but only lightly. Bready and cracker-like notes make up most of the flavor with a hint of cooked vegetable and citrus to round things out. Light in body with medium carbonation. Overall not a bad beer I suppose. Very simple, nothing horribly wrong with it. About what you'd expect for $3.99 per six-pack I guess."
"Overall-- not terrible... But then again, neither is Miller Lite. Both are so flavorless that they don't offend, but also so weak that they really aren't worth my time drinking."
""
""
"At 2.99 a six-pack, I had to give this a try. This beer pours a golden yellow. The thin head dissipates quickly. The aroma was not too impressive. No hops to be found and a little stale. The taste was surprisingly sweet up front, with slight bitterness in the finish. The mouthfeel was light to medium. Medium carbonation. Overall, this beer is great for the price. It is many times better than anything else you can find for 50 cents a can."
"Ok, I did it. This has some potential, but needs work. I picture Trader Joes contracting to someone to make an ""all malt"" lager for cheap, but good. I feel like the recipe is fine, but there could be more attention to detail in the process to get a drier, cleaner brew."
"O: The price isn't bad which I guess brings this up a bit? An adequate substitute for your BMC."
"D/O- Rated to style. Drinkability is there for the BMC folk. Obviously there are better beers out there but at this price point it demands a purchase, if only to catch a buzz. Minhas sure does do everything NOT to show ownership in it's brews."
"O: To be quite honest, I'd drink this beer if it were closer to 5 bucks a six pack. I really enjoy it. It is simple and has no frills. At 50 cents a can, you'd be hard pressed to find more beer for your buck."
"I'd take it over Bud/Coors/Miller, but not over much else. It is slightly below average in every way, but it doesn't suck. For $2.99 per 6 pack, I ain't complaining."
"I'm surprised to see all the negative reviews, at $2.99 a 6 pack this is possibly the cheapest beer in America but blows away any of the macrobrews like Budweiser, PBR, Keystone, etc. To me it tastes like a cheap pilsner infact it reminds me of the SOB pilsner which is not a beer I'm crazy about but again at $2.99 a 6 pack this is more of a compliment then complaint. If you're looking for some cheap summer beer you can't go wrong here!"
"O: Not half bad for $2.99 for a six pack of cans at Trader Joe's. You could do worse and pay twice as much."
"O - Great on a hot summer day, or any time you want to drink a few beers but not be hungover because of a high abv"
"O - Overall, I have to say this was better than I was expecting. Better than BMC offerings, and half the cost? I know what I'll be having any time I feel like a lawnmower beer from here on out."
"Overall impression: I'm not sure I'd bother pouring this stuff into a glass again, but you could certainly do worse for a lawnmower/golf course brew."
"Please do yourself a favor and avoid this. Not even worth a tick."
"12 ounce can, 50 cents for a single from Trader Joe's. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours a clear gold color with a half inch white head that went away pretty quickly. There isn't much lacing at all. Aroma is sweet malt and corn. Taste is pretty much just like the aroma, it's mostly sweet malt and corn but there's also a slight bitter taste noticable. Overall, it's a little too sweet tasting for me. Mouthfeel/body is light, it's a little bit slick and it's well carbonated. It's not a bad brew, and there's nothing really offensive about it. For the style of beer it is, you could pick much worse. And for 50 cents a can, why not try it?"
"6 PACK,cans from Trader Joes,Salem. $2.99 Poured into a frosted mug its average lager looking..sunshine yellow with a nice frothy white head. Aroma is slightly unpleasant,..some nail varnish remover for an instant..its gone now..now just paper and corn. Taste is really just sweet corn and a bit of grass..not really bad . Actually OK on the palate for style..kinda has a smoothness to it. Overall drinkable and not too bad for $2.99 a six."
"Light golden color. Not much nose, just sugar. Tastes like someone poured a beer, then dumped a pint of water on top of it, and this is whats left. Soooo watery tasting. A hint of corn, but mostly just watered down junk. Even 3 bucks a 6 pack is too much money for me to every try this again."
"Name Tag Lager is a very clear, very sparkling, pale yellow beer with a small, white head that dissipates pretty much instantly. It has a corny, beer breath aroma. It's light bodied, pretty smooth and lively. The dry finish leaves the mouth a touch chalky. It has a corny flavor, not sweet or dry, with a barely detectable bitterness. The aftertaste almost seems a touch sweet... and corny. Did I mention corn? This is the beer I expected to taste when I looked at the can."
"Overall - Always fun to scour the single beers at Trader Joes and look for new things. Not really my favorite kind of beer so don't expect to buy again, but a decently made, refreshing lager."
"Definitely better examples of the style but far from the worst."
"O: A truly worthy beverage. Thanks for sharing, Bobby."
"I purchased a single can of this from Trader Joe's. This a golden brew has just a wisp of foam. Sweetish malt in the nose and more on the palate. The slightest hint of hops at the end. As it warms, the adjunct emerges and brings an unpleasantness to this thing."
"Tried this one at my buddy's house. Took it down from the can. Not too much comes through on the nose, not to me anyway. Taste was better than expected. Definitely not great though. Kind of bland. Went down easy. I probably wouldn't buy it, but if that's all that's available, it's OK."
"T: About as appealing as the smell. Nasty grain flavor with an off sweetness. Poorly made beer and not worth the $2.99 price tag. One of the worst I've ever had."
"12 oz. can from Trader Joe's. Pours a not-quite-crystal-clear golden, with a few particulates and medium carbonation that builds up an inch of white head. Adjunct-laden and metallic in the nose. Smooth and light flavor, sweet, with suggestions of grapey esters, perhaps some corn, and some lightly oily hops that hardly contribute any bitterness. Highly carbonated, with a light body. The sweetness detracts from the drinkability a bit, but not that bad of an example of the style."
"Pours extremely light gold with virtually no head, what's there is gone instantly.  Smells grainy and slight corn.  Tastes weird, a little rice and some sweetness. Man, this is not good, and I used to drink Big Bear and Mickey's.  Mouthfeel is extremely thin.  Drinkability is low."
"D: i got a 6-pack of this stuff at trader joe's for $2.99. ill drink them, but definitely not a beer i will seek out in the future."
"Taste: Better then expected but nothing special. Light in flavor with a slight bit of sweetness to balance a little bit of bitterness. The taste is slightly above other Light American Adjunct Lagers."
"Drinkability is only for quantity over quality. Plus it's wicked cheap, so if you're in a pinch, this is your ticket."
"This is one of the two cheap 6-packs in cans at Trader Joes. Name Tag is $2.99, Simpler Times is $3.99. I prefer this one because it doesn't taste like sugary cereal. This one tastes like water. Straight water and the faintest bit of malt on the finish. I like the can. I'm hoping that one day I can get a 6 of this on sale for $1.99! Just 'cause it would be very cheap and funny. The smell is malty. Mouthfeel is watery as can be. Drinkability is hard to say. This is very boring and watery. Sure, one could drink a sixer of this stuff but it wouldn't be that fun. More of a chore. Best bet is to drink about two if you're feeling a need to drink some brew just to quench your thirst. Goes down so easy."
"D- A good drinking adjunct lager. Once again it's a light flavor beer with sugary sweetness. More like sugar water really. Oh well can't have it all at times."
"Finished a Trader Joe's mixed sixer with this little guy. He pours a clear pale straw topped by a short-lived half-finger of fizzy white foam. The nose comprises light corn syrup, wheat, and hard water. The taste is very similar, though slightly sweeter and with an old green apple kinda flavor thrown in for bad measure. The body is rather light, with a moderate carbonation and a watery feel. Overall, not much goin' on here, but what is going on isn't very good."
"I find the mouthfeel to limit this beer's drinkability. If I want a beer in this style, I'll go for one that isn't as syrupy. It is hard to complain when you drink a beer that 50 cents a can though."
"-Cheerios"
"I had never had this beer before, but it still makes me feel kind of nostalgic, with its ultra-generic labeling and unmistakably adjunct-laden aroma and flavor. Overall, it is not a good beer, but at $2.99 per six-pack, it's not a bad lawnmower beer to have in the fridge."
"As an adjunct lager with bargain basement price, I have to thank Minhas and Trader Joe's for this, Red Oval, and other inexpensive beers. I'm a fan of Simpler Times lager and pilsner, especially to offer in comparison to other American mass-produced over-priced marketing abominations. I'd rather see this in the cooler than those other American ""beers."""
"I actually prefer this to Trader Joe's Simpler Times, given that this is a little easier to drink in session (I think ST is 6.2%). And with the dollar I saved I bought a scratch ticket. A wise investment indeed."
"While my review of this beer is probably not going to add up to a lot of points, I've got to say that this is a good value at $3 for a 6-pack. The look in the glass was all-american lager a.k.a. urine. The nose was very weak malt and bananas. I poured this can into a pint glass so I could get a better look and smell at it (bad idea really - neither characteristic being a strength), and the head took less than a second to dissipate, so I might as well get to the drinking. The taste was good actually, with sweet corn and froot loops being the major notes. The mouthfeel is above average, not overly foamy and pretty smooth. The drinkability is also above average, clocking in at about 15 minutes for ""first beer on a friday"". Better than the big guys, and cheaper."
"Pours your usual urine color characteristic of American adjunct lagers. Normal big fuzzy head, but it actually keeps a little layer instead of disappearing completely. I actually got some aroma just from opening the can. Not sure yet if that is a good thing. Smells sweet with a little corn aroma. Kind of funky in a bad way. A very light noble hop aroma that combines with the sweetness to make it kind of fruity smelling. Wow. For an adjunct lager it really doesn't taste bad at all! Fairly sweet with definite pilsner maltiness. Slight fruitiness, maybe a very light touch of corn. Not watery, but a little thin. It has a redeeming creaminess to it though. I really don't mind it."
"D- save your money and buy a 12ozer"
"I second what everybody else said...great price (although Trader Joe's seems to charge $3.99 for this in NY state and $2.99 everywhere else) and a you-get-what-you-pay-for lager -- no more, no less. Retro-looking '70s-style label...all it needs is the old-fashioned pop-top and you can almost see your mom's avocado-green appliances and smell the crock pot cooking while you watch Courtship Of Eddie's Father (or Julia, or Mannix, or Owen Marshall) on your Dad's Curtis-Mathis. Have A Nice Day! BTW, can now says 5% ABV."
"Well I drank it all, and even finished the six pack, but mostly out of obligation. It washes down food fine, and cleanses thirst ok, as long as it's cold. I'd probably spring for some of the big macro brews over this one though. Definitely give me PBR any day first. However, price is a big factor in my drinkability rating, which helps it out. A little more effort, Red Oval!"
"Light, fairly refreshing. The aftertaste would prevent me from seeking this out. Still not a horrible brew, would drink if there was nothing else around. As it stands tonight though, I can't finish this glass."
"PS: keeps one's irony quotient up as well, which is harder than ever now that I'm over 40."
"Edit 6/12/12: I grabbed one of these without realizing that I'd already reviewed it and am changing my numbers from all 3's to the 3/2/1.5/2/1.5 you see here. I found this second tasting to be a sticky sweet mess. Just a syrupy, grainless, hopless, yeastless trainwreck of a beer. Avoid."
"Serious bang for the buck. Totally passes this summertime feed your friends barbecue and beer freak!"
"Red Oval is a pretty dismal beer; at best it's unpleasant. I reckon I can't be too surprised; after all, this costs 50 cents per can. Still, it's really bad."
"Drinkability is OK for what it is, a $2.99 a six pack TJ beer. It is OK but no hidden gem."
"Well heck, it's not too bad at all. Drinkable, certainly, but if that's the best thing I can say about it, then I can live without ever having another one. Still, it's not awful, and I guess I expected so much worse..."
"d: it is what it is - an adjunct lager, nothing off, nothing interesting, but generally clean and drinkable"
"It's redeeming quality is possibly it's drinkability, because it does go down well, and it's somewhat quaffable, if there's little else around. A good filler beer for people who are BMC fans, but not much else."
"All in all, if you just want a beer, it's hard to argue with the price. Won't be winning any awards any time soon, but then again they never claimed to deserve one."
"This is a good one to share with a new neighbor who is obviously not into craft beer, which my neighbor, Jim, clearly is not. Boring. I'll reach for Simpler Times Lager any day of the week over this one. Oh well. $2.99/sixer, what did I expect?"
"This is a simple, under hopped lager with little character."
"Sure it's drinkable, but for those who have paid their dues, the overall impression leaves an intuitive wariness of having too many of these in one sitting."
"The overall BA rating of ""NOT WORTHY"" leads me to ask the question, ""not worthy of what, your majesty""?"
"Pale gold with a good sized white head and minimal lacings. Aroma is corny. Taste is corny sweet with a kiss of hop bitterness. Mouthfeel is average. Nothing wrong with this typical American Lager just no reason to drink it again unless this is your style. Value is good at $2.99 per six pack at Trader Joes."
"D: I think on a hot day, just after mowing the lawn, it would be fine, ice cold, with me lying in the hammock... Otherwise, save it for your Beer-stupid friends..."
"Drinkability: It's nothing complex, and it's nothing special, but it'll pass as beer."
"Worth every penny, at 50 cents each."
"F.T.- This beer is not for me, I need flavor in my beer. If you have any cheap beer drinking friends; do them a favor and turn them on to this."
"Drinkability: Certainly an uncomplicated beer, but, for me, it just comes up a bit short in both the aroma and the flavor department."
"yes! finally a beer that i can buy for less than $0.50 a can! ok, so there really isn't anything impressive but it does the trick when you're broke and have a TJ's in your neigborhood. VERY pale color. smells like a cheap lager. tastes a little 'syrupy' sweet with a hint of dryness. mouthfeel is average at best. on the flip side of everything, you can drink a ton of these easily....happy drinking!"
"D - All beer has it's place. It was what it was."
"Once again, an aggressive pour resulted in two fingers' worth of explosive, rocky bone-white head with low retention. It looked like the top of a lemon meringue pie just before it goes into the oven to brown the tips of the meringue. Whoops! In the short time that it took me to type that last, the head disappeared. Bye! Color was a slightly hazy lemon yellow. Nose was characteristic of the style - notes of bubble gum and cereal with a light lager-like sweetness. Mouthfeel was medium with an exceptionally sweet taste in the mouth, like drinking candy. Woof! Finish was equally candy-sweet in its intensity. I CAN really do without this sort of thing."
"D- I bought a sixer of this for three bucks and the first time I tried it I thought it was so bad I poured it out, and one of my fiends that was over poured it out as well. It was terrible. So I had the other four cans in the fridge for a couple of months and decided to try it again. It isn't good, but I finished the remaining four. It is good for the price if anything. I just won't buy it again, but I'm also a beer snob. :)"
"Ok, so initially the flavor was pretty bad. Slick on the tongue, sweet, slightly smokey. After eating a few spicy nachos however, it wasn't too bad."
"Weak, watery mouthfeel with medium carbonation. Easy to drink but hard to call this a ""craft"" brew."
"Beer pours like a typical macro, fizzy head that reduces to nothing. Beer smells and tastes like canned creamed corn and is cloyingly sweet. I get no hops at all,or malt I guess just corn. 50 cents well spent, glad I didn't get a six, still, there ar worse beers."
"M/D - Weak and easy to slam duing beer pong but short of that not impressive in any way."
"I prefer this to Simpler Times Lager as it doesn't have quite as much sticky sweetness to my palate... in comparison, after 2 STLs, I'm out, but I could go for a 3rd Red Oval. But beware--like any cheap beer this is best consumed COLD as the less flavor revealed the better. There is a reason why the big guys focus so much on ice cold beer..."
"Ok, keep in mind that this beer does not pretend to be anything else than it is. Cheap. All the connotations that go with it seem to apply. This does not damn the beer however. A wicked cheap offering from Minhas (Simple Times) via Trader Joe, it is fun order a case, barely marked behemoth of one that seems to impress TJ staff immensely. At 50c/can it is a bargain, but only if you want cheap-ass beer. Forget your trendy PBR, this is way better than your tasteless Bud Lites, &c , and actually has some flavor. Reminiscent of a Naragansett or Reading, it's worthwhile just for cheap bragging rights, and cheaper than the Portuguese-Polish-Indian cheapo lagers that seem overpriced to me. A bright yellow pisswasser appearance with frothy bright white head, Red Oval is better from the can than glass. Keep it honest. Corn-based & malty (like its pricier cousin, Simple Times),it is best served cold & in abundance. Would I prefer a Black Label? Yes. But again, 50c wins..."
"Overall: Great price, but I'll stick with Hamm's (first choice) or Old Milwaukee (second choice) if I'm on the lookout for a good budget-priced beer."
"Drinkability- Not bad at all considering. Would be right up there with some go to lagers (PBR and Rainier)."
"The aroma"
"D-I would drink it if it were free or the only beer I could afford.... preference is given to the Mountain Creek for cheap beer."
"Not in the ballpark of the sweet but tasty and potent Simpler Times but certainly not going to break the bank."
"At 50 cents a can, I had to try Red Oval. I was hoping that it would be a little bit better than Simpler Times, but it's really similar or worse. If there's some other lager you haven't had at Trader Joe's, I'd suggest you pick it up instead of this one."
"Once, when I was in seventh grade, our basement flooded during a spring rain. I was able to divert the water while my parents were still at work. As a reward, my mother offered me my first beer. Perhaps it was a Genny or a Utica Club or a Matts Lager. It was one of those thin, heavily adjuncted lagers. I drank only a quarter of it and didn't enjoy another beer until I was 23 years old. Red Oval could be that beer--corn syrupy sweet, fizzy, not a hint of hops or malt. The only thing going for it is a large head that dies slowly and a smidgen of lace on the glass. At $2.99 a six pack, one shouldn't complain, but still this one's destined for the kitchen sink."
"Touch of Noble hops on the nose blend with some light cereal adjuncts and make for an interesting brew. Has a relatively long, albeit simple, finish. A bit earthy as it settles. I think I'll return and pony up $2.99 for a full sixer to better judge this beer. Bring on the Jacuzzi!"
"Drinkability is pretty good for what it is. It's a flavorful lager, that might be a touch too strong or heavy. But still, with the $2.99 for a sixer price tag? Give it a shot, it's not bad."
