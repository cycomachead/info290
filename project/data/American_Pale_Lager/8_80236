Color was a crystal-clear Pale-Straw (SRM = 1 - 2). Nose had the honey-like sweetness that I usually associate with Lagers, but this was supposed to be G-F. WTF?!? Mind = blown. Mouthfeel was medium. Taste was reminiscent of summers on the farm - honey, hay, mown grass. Clean, light, easy-drinking, this was better than many AALs that I have been exposed to and it is G-F! Holy ... Finish was clean, semi-sweet and unquestionably the best of the lot so far.","woodychandler","Feb 28, 2015"

Ring-lacing is seen at first then slides back down after a few sips. The aroma is of grains for the most part with a light hint of corn also. More going on with the flavor as this actually doesn't taste like the typical 'Pale Ale' and even leaning towards a Hefeweizen (wheat beer) even. Great taste and goes down easy. No harsh or bitter aftertaste at all unlike some pale ales. Tasty brew. Lighter+ bodied with good carbonation. Overall I liked this one and don't care if if is ""Gluten-Free"" or not.","BeerWithMike","Feb 04, 2015"

This would be great on a hot day.  If I had Celiacs I would be all over this.  It doesn't seem to be missing anything in the flavor profile.","fscottkey","Jan 05, 2015"

Feels light in the mouth and overall, while not a very flavorful beer, it would make a good thirst quencher on a hot day.","tone77","Dec 29, 2014"

A pale yellow color should set you up for a clean, albeit simple taste. It finishes with the slightest hint of bitterness. To this beer's merit, it is slightly more complex than your generic ""'Murcian"" lager. Price tag aside, this beer is great option for ingredient-conscious drinkers who appreciate a cold, consistent, light(er) beer.","FishPhry","Oct 02, 2014"

Overall I like this about as well as most other light lagers, but this seems to have a little more body than most which makes it a skosh more enjoyable I would probably not be able to tell it is a gluten free product if I tried this blind, but I probably would not purchase this again even though it is ok for the most part.","Slatetank","Apr 18, 2014"

2.83,-11.3,3.25,2.75,2.75,3.25,2.75,"Continuing the expansion of my gluten-free beer horizons. This stuff pours a clear pale straw topped by a finger of relatively short-lived lightly off-white foam. The nose is nearly nonexistent, though there's a wafting of pure cellulose, like the water dripping from a piece of split celery. I can't say it's necessarily a bad thing, just a feeling like they weren't at all trying here. The taste holds notes of light wheat, light flowers, dried honey, and a vague sense of something sweet-ish that I can't quite put my finger on. The body is a hefty light, with a light moderate carbonation and a watery feel. Overall, a pretty weak brew, one that seems to compound some of the negative things I've heard about GF beers.","TMoney2591","Jan 13, 2013"

It doesnt compare to a truly full flavored beer, Ii it is intended to be a gluten free substitute for light lager it's a home run as there is nothing about it that (other than the poor foam) that screams gluten free and I would say it actually tastes like real beer.","nickfl","Jan 04, 2013"

I could read one of those optometrist's eye charts through this thing. Wow, very clean. Aromas of toasted grains, a slight buttery highlight, and some floral notes. Flavors of grain and cereal initially, with a slight roasting on the tail-end of the palate. Very light and clean in mouth, with a crisp, almost sharp finish. Roasty, slightly grainy aftertaste. This beer is clean and very well put together, but it just lacks a lot of substance. Interesting idea behind this line of brews, though.","GarthDanielson","Nov 05, 2012"

Aromas are typical for the style - lager yeast, grassy hop. Tastes are grassy, biscuity, sharp & clean, finishes semi-dry. Mouth-feel is rather thin and watery. This is better than the macro offerings of a light lager, but still not worth another purchase.","barnzy78","Oct 27, 2012"

Pours a crystal clear deep golden straw color with a smallish white head that dissipates quickly. Smells of spicy hops and sweet bready pilsner malt with a bit of a strange tartness that I can't put my finger on. The flavor holds a bit of spicy noble hops, a bit of pilsner like malt flavor and again a strange tartness that I wasn't expecting. Medium to light body with a moderate level of carbonation and a watery spritz y mouthfeel. Decent beer, really nothing special but probably the best GF beer I've tried. I rated this a bit higher just for the gluten free factor, If I were gluten intolerant I would probably get used to this.","johnnnniee","Sep 23, 2012"

Poured only an 1/8"" inch white head which didn't last long. The body is a clear straw yellow with very little effervescence. Smells of malt and grass. The taste mirrors the smell yet I'd say it's richer and creamier than mainstream lagers. Short finish but fairly long aftertaste. Better than I'd have expected.","MoreThanWine","Aug 31, 2012"
