4.36,22.1,5,4,4.25,4.5,4.75,"It would be a far shorter list to mention what's *not* drinkable about this beer. That would be a list with zero items. This is really, really well done. If you're into the "if it ain't eleventy jillion percent alcohol and infinity IBUs then don't call me" mode, you won't find this worth your time. This is a beer for a refined drinker who chases nuance and appreciates the art of brewing rather than one who enjoys getting slapped upside the head with huge flavor and jaw-clenching bitterness. It would also be great for a BMC drinker who wants to get into craft beer. I'll admit it bothers me a small amount when I see brews like this denigrated by craft beer drinkers who should know better. If one approaches this with the understanding of what it is supposed to be - a clean, mild, easy to drink and sessionable all-malt American style pilsner - rather than what it is not - a super-complex, rich, overhopped ale made from a recipe found in a UFO at Area 51, using the only known fruit from the last surviving species of a particular tree in the Amazon picked right before it was plowed under, barrel aged in Jesus' tomb, and carbonated with unicorn farts -- one can't help but be impressed. When drinking it, if you find yourself saying "man, I'm not really tasting such-and-such", well hello. Now you're starting to get it. I'm extremely happy with the beer. If you've made it past the "get me faced in one beer OR ELSE" phase, definitely give this one a shot. Delicate, yet well worth drinking. I'm very impressed with what Boulevard has done here.","jokelahoma","Feb 17, 2014"

3.88,8.7,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Pours to a thin white head with minimal lacing and intense golden yellow color. Aroma is grainy malt and hops. Flavor is a crisp, dry, balanced American lager without the blandness and corniness of the major brands. The hop flavor and bitterness offsets the residual sweetness of the malt. Flavor improves as it warms up and de-gasses a bit, which is rare for a pale lager. Light mouthfeel and generous CO2 to give it a refreshing feel. Overall, a solid beer in the tradition of pre-prohibition lagers known as "Classic American Pilsner (CAP)" . We can't get Full Sail Session Lager this far east and this product sort-of fills that "CAP gap".","EagleTalon","Aug 29, 2013"

The beer had almost no head and was golden in color. Malt sweetness came across in the smell and taste, but was still sufficiently balanced by hop. I'd think the malt is an American variety, which is fine for an American lager but not for a German Pils. It's a solid offering that is quite drinkable owing to the low ABV and mild flavors, but it is not especially distinguished, IMO.","pweis909","Dec 15, 2012"

So this is Pilsner. Nice. Reminds me champagne? Is that a good thing to say about Boulevard's offering? Label says it's a "Genuine American Lager". Whatever. It's a good beer and definitely a Pils.
