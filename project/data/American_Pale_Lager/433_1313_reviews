"Somewhat sweet.  Not bad though not my favorite"
""
""
"Clear, light golden color. Small head, lingers for a bit. Some lacing. Citrusy aroma amd taste. Crisp. Very much like a light beer. Slight tartness in the aftertaste. The bottle says, ""specially brewed for the unique flavor of an ale and a lager""but I'm not getting it. This is a garden-variety pilsner all the way. Drinkable but unremarkable."
""
"Interesting and not necessarily in a good way."
""
"Aroma of cereal, grass, corn, leaves, corn, malt. Taste sweet corn, malt, biscuit, caramel, grains. Ok Pale!"
""
""
""
"O: An easy drinking brew for a get-together or gathering. Has decent flavor and good drinkability. Not bad, but certainly not my first choice either"

"One of the lower Canadian Beers."

"Overall: Molson kind of lacks the charm of High Life and Pabst, but it's also much better than Budweiser and not appreciably worse than Heineken. As multinational macro lagers go, it's midrange. There's worse stuff to drink while watching hockey (eh), but it's very so-so."
""
""
"This has potential as a Pilsner like maltiness meets a rye like grain flavor meets slight bitterness and cracker dryness. It has a real ease of drinkability and it's not too harsh, rather crisp actually. There's just a weakness and a lack of assertiveness that ranks it below average."

"O - Top notch adjunct lager. Very refreshing and tasty! I didn't buy this for a while because I was wary of the dreaded green bottle. Six beers in and no skunk. Go get some."

"I have tried many American adjuncts and don't enjoy anything from A-B. I recently drain poured a Miller Fortune. Coors Light offends me. But I am glad to say that I discovered Molson Golden and will be keeping it around as a go-to for when I want to enjoy a neutral beer that doesn't pull me to any extreme. Sometimes you want an IPA or an imperial stout, but sometimes you just want ""a beer"" to kick back with. This is that beer. If you understand what I mean by that then I recommend giving this a shot."

"Sometimes note having a terribly thin, watery body can be a detractor for this style. Odd, I know. But this beer has a thickness and a certain slickness that's worse than if it had a weaker body, though it is light regardless. It's sort of a clash on the palate, though a bite of crispness cuts through it some."

"its molson golden...10.99 per !2er at pharmacy...no elaborate review here but 2.5 times Bud for overall drinkability..when it comes to this watery sweet style there is really only one other option i would consider for a nice mellow session: and that would have to be Coors Xtra Gold"
"O: This takes me back to the days of college in upstate NY where this was the beer of choice due to the cheap price compared with American BMC (this was in the early 1990s so there were not a lot of craft options available). Maybe not as quite as I expected it to be from my college memories...and I was surprised that it was not skunky at all considering the green glass bottle."

"Overall: I have no idea what I just drank. It could have been any number of mass produced American pale lagers."
""
""
""
"Overall- Disappointed. I was not expecting a whole lot however the earthiness of the beer dominated its entire presence. This is the definition of a chugging beer, because you do NOT want to just sip on it. I would recommend this as a lawn mower beer or when you invite your buddies over for the big game. This is not a one of a kind brew. CHEERS!"

"Has a light, yet good flavor. Nice and crisp, and has a unique sweetness to it reminiscent of carmel."
""
"D: I wish I had more to say about this brew, but between the unappealing aroma and lack of flavor it is tough to use more words in this review. if the purpose of drinking a beer is to drink some fizzy liquid that has alcohol in it, this could suffice. for everyone using this website, pass."

"O: This beer is easy to drink and has a very good balance between malts and hops for a light beer. While it came in a green bottle, I couldn’t detect any skunk in the smell or taste."

"The beer, like its name, pours out a beautiful golden color, rather appealing really. The smell and taste were surprising in a way, there was a distant hint of citrus I am certain I tasted. The single reason why I rated it better than average. Mouthfeel was average at best and it actually felt a bit watery sloshing around. Overall, it was better than what I expected and have enjoyed a few more than one since."
""
""
"How did I miss this stuff during my trip to Windsor those years ago...? Anyway, this stuff pours a clear pale gold topped by a relatively short-lived finger of lightly off-white foam. The nose comprises wheat, very light lemon peel, and mineral water. The taste brings in more of the same, with both the wheat and the lemon gaining that usual macro funk (one day I'll find a better way to describe that quality (or lack thereof)). The body is pretty light, with a light moderate carbonation and a watery feel. Overall, a meek, bland, sad little beer. 'Nuff said, really."
"A totally underrated beer. This pours clear, golden, beautiful. a nice head, not too much, not too little. the smell is as beer should be: hops, malt .. yum. It can get a little skunky, which to be honest, I really don't mind if it is not excessive. The alc kick is decent, and actually a little surprising as the flavor of alc doesn't come through at all. It is very, very drinkable, maybe a little too much so. I can down three of these in a half hour and not realise it.. until the buzz hits.. which is nice and smooth, not heavy and sickening. All around, a true favorite."

"O - Overall, it's a good cheap beer, somewhat above a large number of them, but nothing fancy by any means. Would I have it again? Yes."
""
""
""
""
"Taste is nice, creamy grain, malt-o-meal, light spritzy apple and grass. It's simple and light but fairly good. It seems a bit more flavourful and enjoyable than the Molson Canadian."

"there is much worse out these. pours see through and very light yellow color with a decent white head thats gone in an instant. smells kind of like the can, watery malt body, i dont know, just kind of like a stale beer. flavor is moderately better, drinkable and crisp, really watery taste, but there are some hops in the finish, just enough to remind you that its a beer, but there is nothing craft about this thing. metallic in the finish. feel isnt that bad, ultra light and well carbonated, which makes for good golf course beer some some similar application. i think its better than canadian, maybe equal to it, but not as good as export, which isnt bad at all. overall it has its place in the 18pack of cans hall of once a summer drinks."

"A clear but radiant golden color with an impressive white foam on top and lacing to match. The aroma brings out a slightly metallic wheat grain that fills out into a somewhat pleasant peppery-yeast bread idea. Quite nice actually, and the metallic hint pretty much disappears. The taste is relatively light cereal grain with a citrus kiss. There’s a mild malt backbone that brings a sweetness into the blend that becomes more prominent as you get near the end. It’s medium light bodied with a tingly midland feel. This was one of my favorite beers during my youthful barhopping years, and is actually one of the few revisits that didn’t make me think now “what was I thinking then?”. Really pleasant and refreshing and I’m happy to know I can happily accept one if that’s what the host is offering."

"From the green bottle marked APR1612-EO8050822. Sampled on January 14, 2012. The pour is golden yellow with a small but slightly lingering head. Green bottle aromas are not as noticeable as other instances but there is a mild skunkiness. Beyond that I get grains and crisp hops. The body is thin to medium and very typical. The taste is grainy with a clean enough finish. There is a reason this is a big seller."
""
""
""
""
""
"Medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Overall fairly clean and easy drinking as far as the style is concerned. This is one best enjoyed while colder as the sweet aftertaste increases as it warms."
""
""
"Poured a 1/2"" white soap suds head which dissipated quickly. Clear yellow body only slightly deeper than the standard straw yellow American-lager beers. Smells of grass. Taste too is straight BMC. The only plus is the texture is creamier than most of its peer beers."

"Overall: Compared to some other OTS Canadian beers, this one holds it's own. Recommended for drinking outdoors or at a party."

"Overall Drinkability - Must be a skunked bottle. Beers like this make me really wish breweries would get over green bottles. I have no sympathy because I feel the skunking is an almost inevitable part of the design of this product, as such."
"O: hmmm . . . not sure what to say on this part, but its originally Canadian, so might be good for watchin' hockey, eh?"
"overall = I was pleasantly surprised by this beer. I like it more than regular moson probably."
"D: A very drinkable beer, good ABV so you could drink a few.... But there is just not enough taste to make it really worth while. It is just a beer."
"interesting that I read on Molson's website that this is a blend of Ale and Lager. One of the better choices for cheap beer."
"This is yet another forgettable mass produced beer."
"The draft version is not much better but it is ubiquitous in Canada and better than Bud."
"$10.99 for a twelve pack in Acworth, GA."
"Not a bad taste actually, faint hop metallic bitterness, easy to drink, very light, no off flavors, small skunkiness. Lots of carbonation to give that spritzy vibe to it. Corn aroma did not lead to corn husk taste, which is nice. A decent hot weather pick, but they still charge too much for this stuff."
"O=Not quite what I was hoping for, but not bad...an okay session beer if you have friends over that like Canadian things and don't know beer."
"This beer it's a good social brew. There isn't too many charactoristics that can be described on this. The beer is light in color, golden like the label says. The nose has some skunk on it but not enough to gross me out. The beer has a good drinkablity to it. Not a lot of head but overall it's decent."
"First beer I've listed on here that I wouldn't drink again unless someone handed me a free one and there wasn't anything else to drink. I'd take a Molson Candian over this hands down. Not sure what Molson was thinking with this one."
"Good rich one finger head of dense foam, broken but clingy lace. Color is a 5 on the SRM Beer color grid. Smells of fresh cut wheat, sweet corn, and roasted barley. Taste is fresh, leading with roasted wheat, and cooked corn, then flavors of barley, and light citrus. Tangy, bite your tongue feeling in my mouth, too much carbonation for my liking. Refreshing taste that is clean and tart, but not bitter. This is a slightly better than yard work beer, but not as flavorful as the beer I like to share with my beer buddies."
"D- Good. i could have a few more of these. It's a pretty good tasting beer once you get past the skunkiness."
"D- Terribly ruined taste with strong doses of skunk and thin watery feel. Absolutely horrible drain pour."
"Overall: As cases go, this can work; as fortunate as I feel to be able to rate beer again, I was a bit foolish to welcome myself back with this watery fare; mouth-quenching with a bit of beef bite that doesn't make the beer as easy-drinking as it should be..."
"All things considered, though, the flavor wasn't *that* offputting. I slugged down a sixer. It's remarkably smooth, gave me no indigestion, and the back end was void of the burning fizziness that you get from a truly awful macro. Still, I won't be buying it again any time soon."
"Tastes like macro town although a little svelter and less clumsy than the American versions. Thin but not too watery in the mouth. Easy to drink and uncomplicated, but not completely lacking soul."
"This ones not too bad I'd be happy to drop a few in the cooler for friends and give them a slightly better option over ""cold water"""
"light aroma, mostly light grain and hints of corn. slight grassy hops, but very very light. this carried right over in the flavor which was again far too light for my tastes, but what can you do. small hop presence in the finish and a light cereal grain balance. nice feel, was not too light at all and overall not a terrible expierence by any means."
"All in all, not a remarkable beer as far as flavor is concerned but it's drinkable from the sheer standpoint that it will not offend."
"D- This beer is just unimpressive. And is it really a blonde ale?"
"Drinkability: Fairly decent for a macro lager, not too offensive which makes it fine for drinkingon a hot summer day."
"Upon opening, the almost skunky characteristic Molson aroma is just as I remember it from 30 years ago. It shows plenty of bubbles, but the head does not last long. The taste is mildly hoppy, with a hint of malt, but the excessive fizziness makes it hard to evaluate all the subtleties. A nice amount of floral hoppiness lingers on the palate. Mouthfeel is okay with the bubbles, as well as decent flavor for the style. This would be really nice on an 85 degree day."
"Taste is pretty standard Euro Pale Lager fare, sweet and grainy adjuncts with a light touch of sulfur and hops in the finish to balance things out somewhat. Nothing really off-putting about this one, but there is nothing here that makes you crave more. Tastes pretty fresh and crisp, with a decent amount of flavor. Body is medium, maybe even bordering on thin for a EPL (which I am rating this as), as a blonde ale it would fail miserably. Not too much different from the Canadian Lager IMHO."
"Pours a clean but dulled gold color with a quick puff of white, frothy head. No retention or lacing. Smell is very faint whiff of adjunct grains with no impurities or skunkyness. Taste is a very faint bite of mildly sweet adjunct grains, hint of hops with no impurities or skunyness. Body is light and watery, not over carbonated like other beers in its demographic. A very adequate substitute for the typical BMC fare for a backyard BBQ or tailgate."
"In the end, the beer fares about as well as Budweiser- where we are giving up on crispness and cleanliness we are adding fruity complexity and slightly more maltiness."
"Wow, did my pour ever result in some nice head - two finger's worth of thick, foamy, bone-white head with decent retention! Color was a golden-yellow with NE-quality clarity. Talk about truth in advertising ... Nose had a slightly sweet cast to it, more lager-like than ale. Mouthfeel was medium with a slightly sweet taste, not much hops in evidence, but not overwhelmed by malt, either, striking a nice balance. Finish was slightly dry, and quite tasty, especially compared to Molson CANadian. If you did not enjoy this in a bottle, I urge you to give it a re-visit in a CAN!"
"Poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a pint glass. Freshness date on bottle May 16 10. Basic gold/yellow color. About an inch of head that soon disappeared. Scents of corn and rice in the smell. Flavor is pretty plain and bland. Some maltlike notes, with also a very basic hop flavor. Not bad. Mouthfeel is pretty light and drinkable."
"This is a boring beer. I won't get it again. I don't what makes it so golden that's for sure."
"Nothing at all wrong with this beer, besides I'm sure in many folks opinion, the label. That and the stupidly skunk inducing green bottle that is."
"Drinkability- very drinkable and for the price especially a very nice sessionable lager, I really thing to most of the mass produced things molson puts out a pretty solid product, and served up ice cold you would have no problem enjoying a few of these, a refreshing lager when looking for a no fuss cheaper priced beer"
"D: Very drinkable because there really isn't too much to this beer."
"Pours a light golden yellow color with a faint head. The smell is of malt grains and some floral hops. Taste is of sweet corn and some floral hops, the taste is fairly weak, not offensive and not good. The mouthfeel is watery and moderately high carbonation. The drinkability is average nothing offensive and nothing very good."
"From a 12 oz. green bottle. Pours a pale yellow color with a 1 inch head. Smell is very skunky, not so pleasant. Taste is crisp with some maltiness but also a bit skunky. Feels well carbonated in the mouth and has decent drinkability. Overall this is an average beer."
"Overall: Blonde Ale? Really? No. I wouldn't mind giving it a higher rating if it was more run of the mill, but by labeling itself as an American Blonde Ale..I'm going to have to review it relative to that. Fails."
"Drinkability - this is another baffling aspect of this beer. Why would anyone put away several of these? But the key is - you do! It's like being beside a shrimp ring or a bowl of chips. Each ""last one"" leads to ""another one"". Boring as it may be, several more of these will be going down tonight."
"Drinkability - Below average, not the worst."
"Had a green bottle at Italiano Delight in Emmaus, PA. The bartender set it down with a frosted mug. Upon pouring the beer the a cloud of skunk hit the air. Man, this was bad, especially for a beer that was just in a cooler under a bar. Eventually the skunk cleared and I was left with a plain, light amber ale with a bready sweetness and not a lot of much else. Easy drinking, skunk aside."
"Overall, this is lawnmower beer. Bought it on a lark, mostly out of fond memories of teenage drinking binges when this was considered ""high end"" beer. Luckily I'm no longer in that phase. This is better than the Corona/Bud/Coors group of brews, but not much better. Some bitterness and balance put it a step above, but it is a shallow step. So much for the trip down memory lane."
"D - This is, to me, on par with the drinkability of most macros. I'll drink them, but if something else is available, i'll check that out first."
"Drinkability is amazing. Sweet enough to be tasty, but very light and drinkable."
"Drinkability: Eh, marginally average would probably be the best words to describe this beer."
"Out of a bottle this beer was a pure gold color with good clarity and lots of rising carbonation. The one finger head displayed good retention as a thin cap and very nice lacing too. The aroma was of corn, stale grains and lager malt. The flavors were not very impressive, dry grains, macro-lager malt, some earthy/dirty pale malt, a little bit of minerals and metal. The mouthfeel was average, the carbonation light/medium and the body medium/light. It really just looked much better than it was!"
"Drinkability: It's easy to drink because it's found a middle area between too light and light that is not half bad."
"D: given that it doesn't taste that bad, and it has a light body It's relatively drinkable."
"Well i had this molson offering last night. Pours out a nice deep golden color, with a small head that doesn't last, and then fades to a small ring of laceing. Looks decent. Smell was average for a macro, and that trademark corny molson smell. Better than Canadian's smell. This was a great tasteing brew tho, goes down smooth, well carbonated with a sweet, tart after taste. Quite pleasing. This is a beer that can be slammed all night, and that's what i did. I HIGHLY recommend this beer, its light years ahead of Canadian. Highly enjoyable, tastey and light! Highly recommended!"
"Drinkable like water, only a touch sweeter."
"(rated Jul 8, 2008)"
"Given the price I'm gonna go with Moosehead or LaBatt from here on out."
"I always feel white-trashy when I drink this beer. It does taste good, especially ice-cold out of a cooler. My real question is how this is classified as an American Blonde. It looks like one; gold pour, big white head. The aroma is sweet and grainy, with a bit of floral hops. But the taste is a lager. Pale malt, sweet, and grainy. Nothing special, but not a blonde, in my opinion."
"D -- Great for one, perhaps a bit too sweet for more than one"
"Drinkability - On the whole, not a bad beer. Possibly one of the upper level ""cheap"" beers to buy. The bitterness does make me question as to whether or not many can be drunk at a time."
"Pours a golden dark yellow colored body, and there is no head to speak of. It has a pale and bitter aroma, some malts. Does not have much flavor, but there is a light bitter-sweetness in the taste. Very light tasting. Yea macros."
"D: Liely its most favorable attributes is drinkability...a bit better than average smell and taste."
"Very similar to their Canadian this is an overall decent lager. Smooth faint aroma, light golden pour with minimal head retention, nice and easy mouthfeel, and a crisp flavor that is real basic. Not much to write home about but it's a solid choice for a simple quenching lager."
"Pours out very transparent golden yellow with a big-bubbled white head. Head fizzles out quickly and there's no lacing. There's a ""green-bottle"" funk in the odor accompanied by the smell of Cheerios. Tastes like how a can of corn smells... If that makes any sense. There's a cereal kind of essence to the tastes as well. Pretty watery but there's a decent semi-clean aftertaste. It's an OK beer. On par with any other Bud type beer I suppose."
"Overall this is a fine beer. I was very impressed by Canada's beers during a recent trip and wanted to try some more back home. Canada mass produces beer with flavor."
"D - I don't really care for blonde ales in general, but this is about as bad as it can get. Virtually flavorless, with a sickening sweetness accompanied by skunky hops. Top it off with a nearly flat mouthfeel, and this is one tough-to-stomach brew."
"Pours a light straw color with some very nice initial head, almost no lacing, and a lot of carbonation. Complete malt scent, but even that was a bit weak. Nice crisp flavor, but almost entirely malt, nearly a macro lager, no hop balance at all. Goes down very smoothly, though, even considering the amount of carbonation. A good thirst quencher if not a great beer."
"I bought this in a 6 pack at my local Hannaford (Maine) for 7.99 +tax &deposit.. Not as good as its brother Molson Canadian, its name doesn't lie, it is very deep yellow in appearance. The smell is strong. I didn't care for the taste a little bitter for me, its mouthfeel and drinkability were nothing to write home about. All in all if you want to try Molson, try Molson Canadian first."
"Serving type: bottle"
"My dad likes this beer, which is more of an indictment than an endorsement. Pours a dark yellow with some good head retention due to high carbonation. Has that typical grainy, adjunct smell, but it is light and not pungent like other cheap beers. Pale and dry, this tastes like a really generic beer/really cheap pils. Guess that minimal hop bite/dryness on the backbite makes it a ""beer"" rather than watery piss. I can't even see drinking this while eat hot wings or pizza during a hockey game when there's Labatt's or, excuse me, REAL beer."
"Probably the best of the Molsons I've had and I'd rather not try any more to see if I can find better. Golden colored, a thin white head with a little sticking arouund. Flavor is malty sweet, cereal, and a bit stale tasting but it's at least not skunked or foul (ie Molson Ice). Not horrible."
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability: Anyone could drink this all night. But why would you want to less you were trying to get smashed...even then I'd drink something tastier to get me going, then when real buzzed start on this shit. Light in body and on carbonation. There is nothing special about this beer's body, feel or drinkabilty. Its not a worthy beer so steer clear, less you really, really want to try it. I came by it for free so I figured I'd try and review this one bottle...."
"D= if you're having a great time at a picnic or party and this is all there is to drink, I believe you will survive without much complaint."
"D: Drinkable but I wouldn't seek out this beer."
"bought at specs as a broken six pack single, no glass ... not much smell .. very health wise head, lacing too ... quite a smooth lager with no real offensive lyrics ..some corn (cob) in the taste department (dmv?) a pretty easy going lager from america's hat ...P-A-R-T - why? b'cuz i gotta!!"
"D: One of the worst ive experienced even for a macro and that's not being biased. It's a dumper and my first 1.0 drinkability rating."
"Drinkability: Pretty gross, actually. The beer totally nose-dived after the appearance. Not recommended whatsoever."
"Do avoid."
"Pours very pale golden with a big fluffy head. The head dissipates quickly but does leave decent lacing for a mass-market beer. The beer has an astringent, but not unpleasant, aroma that carries through to the surprisingly malty flavor. There is a slight hop bite, though everything evaporates quickly, leaving hardly any finish. The mouthfeel is extremely watery. Not a bass mass market beer, but little more than that."
"Pours a clear gold with fast fading white head. Nice lacing. Smell: slight skunk, husky grain, slightly grassy. Taste: light pale malts, astringent off flavors, bit of dms, lemony, metallic. Mouthfeel: light bodied, smooth but a bit thin. Pretty easy drinking but nothing good."
"This is not a drinkable beer. It's a macro beer, made for the masses who don't want personality in a beer."
"Pours from the 12 oz green bottle (potential skunk alert!!!) the advertised golden color with a large foamy head that settles into a thin collar that clings to the sides of the glass. Good carbonation. The aroma is a mix of malt, corn, and a metallic, hoppy bitterness. Taste is somewhat dry and grainy, clean malt with mild hops bitterness. It has a kind of subdued pilsner flavor. Mouthfeel is good...light, but not watery. I could DEFINETLY still pound quite a few of these over the course of a night. Overall, my palate has changed, my tastes have changed, and this is no longer my absolute #1 favorite beer, but I think it is STILL head & shoulders above any other mass produced pale macro lager out there (yes I gave it a couple of nostalgia points, but no one said that's not allowed). When money's tight between paychecks, or i'm hanging out with macro drinking friends, this will remain my macro beer of choice."
"Overall a decent macro. Certainly Molson's best offering."
"Light bodied. Not bad overall for a macro. It has some blonde ale features. Overall, pretty bland and the grassy/sulfurish notes don't help it in any particular way."
"classique de la gamme Molson, la golden se révèle d'une belle couleur dorée (comme son nom) ressemble à la pluspart des autres bières molson, peu de houblon, peu de malt, vraiment ordinaire. le nez est presque absent, peu de goût, beaucoup de maux de tête!!"
"Molson Golden is imported, so it MUST be good, right? It pours a ... golden color. With that comes a foamy off-white head. Very, very little lacing on the glass. The smell is a bit sweet and grainy; taste follows suit. Kinda dry tho', which is nice. A good amount of carbonation makes this a crisp beer, with a nice mouthfeel, and therefore it could be a great session beer while watching football or eating burgers in the backyard on a hot summer day. Tasty swill. Better than Bud or Coors."
"Drinkability- You could have a lot of these, if you only want to get drunk."
"12oz green bottle poured into a pint glass. Pours a golden yellow color with a white head that has pretty decent retention and lacing. The aroma is slightly skunky with some faint grainy malt and hops. The taste is crisp and refreshing with some malt and a touch of hops in the finish. The taste is a little watery but has more flavor than most macro lagers on the market. Overall, there is nothing special about this brew, but it is certainly better than the average macro lager out there. Drink it while it is cold, because the taste quickly deteriorates as it heats up."
"Molson Golden pours a golden yellow with a thick white head from a green twelve ounce bottle. The aroma is grainy and mildly skunky. Flavor is very grainy, and quite a bit skunky too. There is also, for lack of a better description, a woody flavor. The green bottle is not doing this one a favor."
"Pours a light yellow/blond color with a decent head. Green bottle so there's some skunkiness (not a surprise). Decent foam though. Taste is somewhat malt-ish and dry, kind of bland up front. Nothing impressive. It's not much of a blonde ale either."
"Interesting nostalgic trip, but I'm good on this one for a while."
"Poured into a pint glass. Highly carbonated head, light straw color. The smell is much like an off euro-pale lager. The skunk of the beer comes through in the aroma and the taste. No crispness or smoothness. The mouthfeel is lacking, but I wouls say that sense is influenced by the previous two factors. All together the drinkability is brought down, but it is no different than drinking any of the euro-pale lagers."
"Anyway, the last time I tried this, the beer was golden in colour with almost no head. The aroma was weak with a grassy tinge to it. It was very crisp and clear on the tongue with weak carbonation. The taste was also weak, not watery, but not very beer-y either."
""
"Drinkability.... this is my wife's beer of choice.... I'll leave the rest for her..."
"Green bottle skunk--upon opening and through the pour and drink. The distinctive hops flavor overpowered any other flavors. Not in a strong way, but in a Euroskunk ""been in the sun too long"" way. This was a fresh bottle, but the ideas is the same. I've enjoyed it (and even bought it) before, but now that my beer palate is a bit more experienced, I can taste it for what it is--a Canadian macro. Would I turn it down? No. Would I buy it? Perhaps; for the right event. As macros go, this is probably the best Molson product available (at least in the US) and is much better than its sister Regular Coors (the hop'less wonder)."
"A very decent macro beer. Grainy, flavorful, and balanced. I bought a 6-pack of this when with some friends (it was the best available option). They normally only drink Miller Lite, but they really liked it. Flavorful enough for me to tolerate, not too flavorful for them to tolerate. It's a beer for the masses."
"Overall this is a very nice beer, nothing that leaps out at you, but nice. Would recommend a try."
"pours a clear light golden color with a large white head that fades quickly to just cover the beer, and with a minimal lacing. strong skunkly smell. taste is grainy malt up front with a skunked hop finish. mouthfeel is dry, light, lots of carbonation. very drinkable if you like the skunky smell and taste."
"This is a nice change from molson canadian, its not as good as canadian, but its pretty good. Poured a golden yellow with a lacy head. If your a fan of molson and the like pick this one up, it'll be in my rotation from now on. It's molson what else is there to say"
"The bottle was freshness dated (code) on the neck. The ale poured, as I would have expected, a light golden color. Smell was stronger than I'd anticipated. The body wasn't that of a craft brew but it wasn't as lacking as found in most macros. Very drinkable - wouldn't mind drinking this one at all on occasions where micros aren't available. I think it may earn a regular spot in my refrigerator - primarily for macro-drinking guests but also, on occasion, for me as a session brew."
"D - It is okay but not Canada's finest offering."
"When poured into a simple pint glass, the beer really wasn't a golden color, but a really pale yellow color with a minimal head of white foam. I was surprised that there was an aroma to this beer. It was just sweet grains, a pinch of citrus fruits, and a touch of alcohol at the end. Noting really good, but at least it didn't have any skunk in it. This beer tasted like beer, what more can say about it? It had a taste of crisp grains like corn and rice and a bit of hops at the end. It's beer all right! The mouthfeel was light, not too watery, which why it makes it so drinkable. I drank 4 of these in a row and felt nothing after it. I could drink these again if they were cheap or the way I got them, free!"
"The beer poured a light gold with a white head. The aroma was light malt and hops basic sour beer. The taste was of hops and malt. The beer was drinkable, but offered very little that was exciting or enticing. This one would be OK in a pinch, but not a very satisfying product."
"An OK beer, but not much else"
"Much more drinkable than a lot of the raw canadien lagers....this is smoother and creamier and to be honest much tastier. They bill it as a cross between a lager and an ale...not sure what it is exactly but it isn't bad...I'd buy a pitcher of this after a playing some hockey...slightly above average"
"Pale, apple cider colored yellow. Thin head. The collar leaves sparse amounts of lace. Aroma contains light amounts of sweetness and light amounts of skunk. That's about it. Not a lot on the nose. Skunkiness is minimal on the buds. Light graininess and almost a dortmunder kind of malt/hops blend. But not quite. Nonetheless, this isn't bad. I must have a relatively fresh one as the skunk quotient is low. Body checks in around medium and the carbonation is a little aggresive, but that's almost to be expected with ""macro"" style lagers sometimes. It's not annoying. In any case, this is a decent beer."
"Drinkability- good to have on a really hot day, but not anything too special."
"This is a pretty decent ""drinking"" beer. Its clean and clear, but not as golden as the title hints at. There is a lot of carbonation and the head fades quick. The smell is nothing special but not bad either. The taste is smooth and light with only a traditional ""beer"" taste about it. No subtle hints of anything else. The mouth feel is thin but refreshing, more so than any soda can provide. The over all drinkability is good I think for this one, and I was kind of suprised to see such a low mark. This is probably due to the fact its an enzyme manufactured beer and many have refined pallets."
"Cheers!"
"D: Quite drinkable if you don't let the ambiguous taste get to you."
"Pretty average overall. A beer that brings back great summer memories on the front porch in the middle summer circa 1997."
"Sketchy yellow body under a white foamy head. Reaks of skunk per usual. Phew! Tastes equally trustworthy, vaguest honeyish malt and some bitter hops.. overly carbonated. But these are great at Celtics games! I would not normally order Molson golden at a bar, but for some reason they work so well at sporting events and they are readily available."
"Stubby green 12 oz bottle with undecipherable freshness code lasered on the neck. Pours a clear, golden color with a nice fluffy head. Smell is of freshly cut grass and corn. Taste is pure macro, some maltiness, but mostly corn and a weak hop bitterness. Refreshing, but a lawnmover beer all the way. Drink ice cold."
"Drinkability - Definetely drinkable. Too bad the beer is imported and is slightly more expensive than the cheap macrobrews. Not bad for a macro, though."
"Pours a yellow pale color, not much carbonation, small head, not much lacing afterwards. Scents of sweet malts and citrus. The taste is kinda tangy and bland, not much of an aftertaste. Light-Medium body. Drinkable I guess, but not by much. For a macro it's not bad though."
"Appearance was a yellow/amber a little on the bright side. Head was small and quickly disapated with no lacing. Smell was a little sweet, some grain and something hard to describe. Kind of chemical-like but not real objectionable. The taste was (as is almost always the case) more of the same. It's kind of sweet, a little grainy, a little citrusy-sour, and there is a bit of chemical aftertaste. But its not too bitter and not too objectionable. Mouthfeel is average like almost mouthfeel almost always is. Drinkability is good, I could drink several of these. Bottom line- This quality isn't awesome, but tastes ok and its pretty interesting for such a pale beer. Maybe that's the ale yeast at work. If I hadn't repeatedly read that this was a type of ale I would swear its a lager. And if any Brits read this and then happen to get ahold of a Molson Golden DO NOT drink it warm. Your native ales taste fine warm (by which I mean Newcastle and Bass, I'm not a British Ale afficionado), but this beer does NOT warm well. I didn't deduct anything for that since I didn't give this beer a real high rating anyway and I don't drink beer warm on purpose, but you don't want this unless its at least cool."
"Clear as watered-down urine with a finely carbonated head that scatters to a mear film. Lots of carbonation running all over the glass. The mildly fruity aroma is followed by a wheat-like, grain dryness. Not much of anything going on in the smell, but not disgusting either. The taste is fruity up front with a creamy, but skunky, finish. The foul sourness (not good sourness) is a bit cloying. The mouthfeel is pretty dim and leaves a slick, oily taste which is not very enjoyable. Overall, is it bad....kind of, but it is a little better than your average BMC. One is plenty for me. Someone grab me a tripel!"
"Pours an ultra clear pale gold. Streaming carbonation under a quasi-dense 1 1/2 finger head that will stick for a while. Very decent waves of lace. Noble hops and some sweet fruits phenols like stawberries. Very mild malt presence, almost wheat-like; but a slight vinous character keeps the taste balanced well against light german hop flavors. Dry and somewhat tart aftertaste, but the mouthfeel remains crisp and refreshing. The all around flavor is a bit timid for the style, but the clean finish makes a great drinkability."
"Despite my ratings i drink Molson prodcuts as often as i can beacsue i enjoy them personally. I do realize this isnt the best beer, in fact far from it but I enjoy the easyness of it and the fact that i can have plenty and not feel full. Its very pale, and taste similar to molson canadian exept with some more malt to it."
"Clear green bottle; throws a light gold in color, a nearly non-existent patchy white head. Grains, malt and corn on the nose. Sweet malts, burnt cooked veggies and day old biscuits in the body, a raw-adjunct filled palate. Light in the body, dull and lackluster; skip it."
"Drinkability is very selective, it takes a special person in order to drink this. Unfortunately, I am not that person."
"I had this b/c a friend of mine loves it and gave me a bottle to try. Nothing great but not terrible either. Slight bready flavor and fruity flavor in there but they are really slight. Finish is wheaty and drying at the same time. Smooth and creamy. I do think the water content of this beer, and all of Molson's beers, seems better than most American macros. Not bad but not good either."
"Clear yellow color with a fizzy head that settles to a thin lace around the glass. clean aroma. Light malts, some grassy grains, and faint cooked veggies. Light-moderate bodied with a good amount of carbonation. Light sweet malts pull through with a light hop and faint citrust zest. No flavor is overpowering and is finishes of very clean. Clean, refreshing, and perfect for the summer time."
"Pouring it all you see is a very aggressive head that is short lived, leaving only a small rim of white around the edge of the glass. Kinda skunky, which is what to expect from a minimal flavored beer. Resembles Coors Original a little (not too suprising as they are the same company). Little pricey for the quality of beer, but as one of the guys said above, ""it's a good lawnmowing beer""."
"Pours a one-finger white head that fades fairly quickly leaving some lace. Clear amber color. Light-medium carbonation and light bodied. Strong skunky nose. Starts smooth and sweet - I was expecting skunk juice - but no real strong flavors, no hops to speak of. Good lawnmower beer. $1.65 for a 12oz bottle from Colonial Spirits Acton, Ma."
"I like this brew. Light yellow colour with medium high carbonation. White head dissipated quickly, but left a whisp on top. Light odors of corn and straw, but not much else detected. Flavor is light, yet full, quite smooth with hops, corn and grain overtones. Finshes clean. One of the better brews from Molson. Recommended."
"The beer is pale golden straw colored with a medium-sized, white, frothy head that was mostly gone before the first sip. The smell was a little stinky of corn and hay. The taste is bland, a slight malty sweetness and a tiny bitterness toward the finish. Thin body, watery texture, lively carbonation. Yes, I enjoyed it, but I think it was just due to the fact that it was really cold, and I got to drink at work, not because of the beers characteristics."
"Not a beer for a beer nerd but I would much rather see people drinking this as their mindless choice of a beer as opposed to many other macrobrews."
"Molson Goldon drinks like a dressed up, beefed up, smoothed out macro lager. The website describes it as 'a unique blend of an ale and a lager'. How is that even possible unless they actually blended two different beers? Is it good enough for those of us used to quality craft beer? Not as far as I'm concerned. In a roomful of macros though, Molson Golden might be one of the better options."
"12 ouncer sampled. It poured very light, pissy yellow, very clear, meager bright white head, minor lacing left behind. Nose is vegetal, cabadgy in fact. This is a fairly flavorful blond ale, skunky notes, corn, grainy, chalky hops. Amazing to think this was ""the good stuff"" back in the day...Probably a decent very warm weather brew."
"12 oz. green bottle.Pours a light golden color with a thick white fluffy head. Lots of bubbles streaming rapidly from the bottom of the glass. Pretty good head retention, and a fair amount of lace. Skunky and slight grainy aroma, combined with a hint of floral hops. Very pale malt flavor, smooth and just a slight amount of hop bitterness. Not much really going on here. Light body, high carbonation. Overall, not very exciting at all. Could be refreshing ice cold, but so is water."
"This was my ""elite"" brew of choice when I was stationed down in TX. It seems to have improved."
"Overall-a fine job for the style, I am satisfied with this beer, obviously it's nothing you'll get up and scream about but the quality is here from Molson. Not a bad brew at all."
"Pours a medium straw color with a 1 finger head and OK lace. Smells of sweet malt with some corn and rice notes. Not much hop presence detected. Tastes of sweet malt with some lingering hop bitterness on the sides of the tounge, not much, but some. Average micro mouthfeel. Very very easy drinking beer. A bit watery, even as Canadian macros go. It's still better than American macros though - not nearly the rice and corn flavors. Not much body or complexity here, which was probably the intent. Would be great on a hot summers day as a thirst quencher."
"Nothing complex about this one, but it's a clean, easy drinking, well balanced ale that would make for an ideal, session or ""lawnmower beer"". Refreshing and thirst quenching, but don't expect a lot of flavor or any complexity. Very decent for a Canadian macro."
"The beer pours a pale gold color with a thick frothy white head that quickly fades to lacing. The aroma is decent. It has a crisp, clean, pale malt scent that is slightly skunky and dry. The taste is average. It has a light, plain, pale malt flavor with a slightly skunky taste and a dry finish. The mouthfeel is average. It is a low bodied beer with a little too much carbonation. This is a decent drinking Canadian lager. It is devoid of complexity and flavor, but it goes down quick."
"Light gold/straw color. 1"" of white foamy head. Smells extremely grassy with light skunk nose. Taste is very cereal-grainy. If hops are there, they are hidden behind the malt. Not my cup of tea, but from a macro brewer it has a larger amount of character."
"Slight white head over light straw brew. Head gone bye-bye in a jiffy, little-to-no lacing. Negligible aroma. Taste is minimal, but what's there isn't offesive, just not much good to note. High point is it's cold, and goes down smooth with the sausage ginder and onion rings I enjoyed for lunch. I think all beers have their place, and this one worked today. Mouthfeel fine, and drinkability, for the situation, was great."
"Certainly not my all time favorite, but it is my favorite cheap beer. I won't really drink anything cheaper. Lots of carbonation, no head to speak of. I think it smells and tastes a little bit like green apples. Great on a hot day. Crisp and refreshing. I can even get my wife to drink it! Simply put, it's better than nothing, and it's not as much as the good stuff. Great value."
"This was a quite drinkable beer that in my mind would make a great lawnmower beer. It's quite refreshing but it just lacks in the taste department."
"The beer after departing the green bottle sets in the glass a limpid gold color with a moderate sized white head that is somewhat creamy in texture with the lace forming a tight curtain to drape the glass. Nose is all malt; fresh and crisp, start is sweet and decently malted the top skinny in its feel to the palate. Finish is moderately carbonated, the hops adequately spicy, dry aftertaste, and I see Ive not missed much over the last 4 years!"
"Poured from cans into a large pilsner glass on the back deck, this is a pale, clear, straw-colored brew. The head is puffy, white, and fairly large. It also leaves a surprising amount of lace. It's a pretty good looking beer. Not much aroma. Grainy and grassy, but not much else...neither maltiness nor flowery hops...(sigh). The taste is sweet...a lot sweeter than I remember. There's a little yeastiness and vegetable flavors, but it's all very subtle. It's a very light, almost watery beer. The finish is weak and sweeter than I'd like. A good dose of bittering hops would do this beer some good. All in all, however, it's a decent lawnmower brew."
"Well...this was 'the best' beer they had on the menu at a place we went. Yeah I could have had water, but as a BA I thought: what the heck. Since I poured it myself, I got a beer that was medium pale gold in color, buh no real head to speak of. I was dazzled at all the bubbles rising, but not so impressed by them when drinking. My notes next to aroma say: ? which leads me to think there wasn't that much at all. Medium mouthfeel, but I must say the taste isn't all that: there's some sweetness and jelly-candy notes, but over-all I would have to say it came across as very watery."
"Typical macro lager in appearance..light yellow with a small white head. Quite a strong ""pilsner"" like aroma..grassy and it seems fresh. Quite a smooth sweet taste then a small hop bite is detected..some bitterness left in the aftertaste. Average mouthfeel..though it does tend to become cloying. overall not that bad really for a Canadian lager."
"No more of ths for me."
"This beer looks nice, and is drinkable when cold, but is bland and somewhat unpleasant the warmer it gets. I would have given it higher ratings if the taste didn't disintegrate as it warmed."
"Snagged this from my roommates fridge. This is a very clean looking beer. It poured to a golden hue with an impressive head which didn't last too long unfortunately. Aroma is very similiar to BMC. I was expecting just a little bit of fruitiness or hops from this one. Taste is pretty bland as well. Everything about this beer is understated. This is nothing spectacular but then again it had no serious problems."
"drinkability: hmmm....due to its blandness and low alcohol content, this beer does go down without too many qualms, but the soulessness of this beer becomes obnoxious after like a half a beer, making a person want to get a beer thats not molson golden. this is a beer i am going to try to avoid"
"A drinkable brew, but just not a first choice type of beer."
"pours a medium golden colour with little to no head. smell is quite minimal, with it being basically a bit of sweetnes with some lemon and some malt perhaps. quite thin, but not nearly as bad a an american macro. the taste is quite average. not 'cheap' tastin, like bud, but not full of flavour either. this one is smooth throughout and has a basic taste that echoes the smell for the most part. again, better than an american macro and i could drink these if need be, but really only ordered it because i hadn't had one in a long time."
"This is a beer I rate just ahead of the macro crowd here in the USA. Lively on the tongue but bland in taste, it might be a fall-back refresher on a hot day but not something I'd stock my fridge with."
"Nothing much to write home about. A lawnmower beer at best that's priced too high compared to others. Certainly not something that I'd seek out again."
"The mouthfeel is decent, as it is light with some crispness. Dry aftertaste as slight bitterness seems to show up on the tongue after swallowing. Average drinkability for a macro."
"Drinkability  This one is on par with the other Molsons that Ive had. They arent putting out anything stellar, but they are a small notch above the other macros."
"Fairly easy to drink. Not the best example of the Canadian Brewers art"
"On the palate it is fruity with a pleasant bitter bite on the finish. There is, however, a fleeting impression of talc and medicine-box notes in the mid-palate which keeps this from acheiving appropriate heights of cleanness and balance."
"P-U! Upon opening and pouring I am greeted by the aroma of Pepe Le Pew's Quebecois cousin. That stench subsides enough that the glass of beer in front of me is at least drinkable. The head is thin but it is creamy enough to stick to the glass a bit. The color is yellow-gold and there are tons of floating little bits in it. Flavor is light-struck hops, adjunct and cheap malt. Finishes with a woody, bitter aftertaste. A lame and somewhat offensive fluid."
"Has a sweet taste and aftertaste to it, but is somewhat watery and devoid of any distinct character. It's not a bad beer, but it's not exceptional either, and I'm sure I would pass it by if other beers are available."
"This is my least favorite of the Molson products. Molson Canadian, while not a fabulous beer by any means, is better than this. However, I think of Molson Golden as one of those ""it is what it is"" beers. If you're thirsty, it'll do the job but if you want anything approaching tasty it just doesn't measure up."
"ah...Molson Golden. This beer pours a 'golden' colour with absolutely almost no head. This beer is pretty similar to moosehead but it does have a flowery pilsener-like taste to it(almost a bit like a Brooklyn Pilsener from the bottle..)This beer also features a thin mouthfeel that is not that great. a pretty drinkable, run-of-the-mill Molson product. not bad, but not something to search out. Canadian is better, and this is also better in Canada than in the US."
"Although this beer is quite drinkable it still remains average for the style. Enjoy it cold and as soon as it warms slightly dump it and crack another."
"This was the Fire Sale at the Flying Saucer last night. It poured a very clear light straw. An overall fine LOOKING beer. To bad I was not painting a picture but rather drinking a beer. The aroma was nill. The taste was similar to Coors (that is none) The mouthfeel was very light. This beer does not have much to recommend it. It was not bad so if you are with someone who wants to switch from Coors, maybe suggest this one, but other than that, skip it."
"This pours a perfectly clear golden color with a moderately fluffy lingering head that collapse to leave fine lacing down the sides of the glass. The flavor is sweet malt topped with sharp yet subtle hops. The aftertaste is mild lingering hops. The mouthfeel is pleasant and crisp carbonation. Overall a moderately good yet satisfying beer."
"I like Molson's Export Ale--I really do. The Golden, however, does not measure up; rather, it has all the shortcomings of the macro-brewery from which it comes. It pours light and fizzy, yet somehow the mouthfeel is thin and flat. The smell is indistinct, and the taste is too. There's a touch of hoppiness, which adds something, but unfortunately not enough."
"There is nothing here that will wow anyone. As I stated, it is kind of refreshing, but there is nothing here that will keep me coming back. Boring and bland seem to be the motifs with this beer."
"Notes: Plain tasting, bland. Could be refreshing if it was 100* F and it was ice cold but then I would not even be drinking it for the taste."
"As the oldest brewery (1786) in North American you would expect something more than a beer that appeals to the American Mass-produced mega-beer palette. And when you're expected to pay extra because it's an ""Imported"" beer, the value declines further. A Yellowish/Gold color is unimpressive. The thin/medium malt presents a somewhat mealy odd tasting flavor. The hops are a little more noticeable than some of the American mega-brew counterparts. The lightly skunky aroma is less than pleasant. I do not like this very much!"
"Yellow to light golden with a small white head that disappeared quickly. Little lacing. Grassy nose with some faint maltiness. The taste was of malt with a small hint of hops at the end. This is pleasant beer that neither offends or impresses. I found the highly carbonated mouthfeel to be one of the strongest impressions."
"pours out a clear darkish ""golden"" color...moderate head and a bit of lace. strong corn aromas....and a hint of floral hoppiness. sort of strange tasting....a dirty...or earthy maltiness....some adjuncts....a slight hop crispness in the finish. all this is propped up by a rather smooth and creamy mouthfeel that seems to be the only highly redeeming quality to this beer. not really impressed, and i clearly prefer the ""canadian"" molson over the ""golden"" counterpart."
"Crystal clear medium golden color with a thick snow-white head that fades, but remains to the end. Modest carbonation and very good lace. Aroma is very skunky and sulferous, not at all pleasant. Somewhere underneath all of the skunk, there seems to be some malt, hops, and hints of alcohol, but its hard to tell. Taste begins with slightly sweet maltiness which gives way to mild medicinal hop bitterness. Both malt and hops seem to fade to the end, with a clean and crisp finish. I suspect that this sample may be light struck (cursed be those who do not bottle beer in brown glass), but its really not that bad. Curious that this commonly-available beer has not garnered more reviews. And this is a pale ale??? Hard to believe..."
"Thankfully, I only paid 89c for a single of this beer."
"Personal Notes: This was pretty bad. The sad part is, this used to be a staple for me for about 7 years of my life. During that time, I had a Canadian girlfriend whose father asked me one day ""what are you drinking that stuff for?"". Now I know why."
"Clear dark yellow appearance, biggish head that clears to nothing in 20 seconds. No lacing in the pint glass. A blend of vague lemon and corn to the aroma, some tassel and pollen-like stuff going on. Taste is pretty stripped-down, a little bit of diacetyl and mild corn syrup, quite a bit of carbonation. Decent hop crispness late, not bad balance. The malts seem more at fault, this beer just doesn't generate a flavor profile. Can't really recommend this one."
"Nice golden colour with pleasing head which quickly disapates....having said that, the body is weak, taste is non-descript...Poor thing is rather ugly tasting in a pretty sort of way........Nuff said!"
"blahh just a bland beer with a slightly slightly sweet aftertaste.  After enjoying the craftwork of Bill and Ron at Victory--materialized in the art that is Golden Monkey, I can say this...This isn't a beer, but sadly in comparison of many macros this is a good macro, which is why in the grand scheme of things i rated it as only ""a little below average""."
"Molson Golden is aptly named, as it is a pale goden color and pours with about a one inch nice white head.  The head slowly dissipates and leaves no evidence of its earlier prescence.  The aroma is faint, but has a hint of hops florals in it.  It smells very ""fresh"".  On the taste, the malt is evident, and the hops clean the palate fairly well, but there is a hint of something tha lingers, and I want to say it is butterscotch.  But it is just a hint.  After a few moments, an unpleasant bitterness reappears as an aftertaste.  The mouthfeel is typical macro-thin, but the drinkability is better than most macros.  This beer gives a fair blend of macro swill and micro thrill."
"Can opens with a resounding ""poop"". Smell fills my nostrils as I close my eyes and bring the can to my lips. I take a can opener and pop another hole in the back of the can as I tilt my head and allow the sweet nector to fill my gullet. The only way to drink this ""beer"" is frat style. Not a sipping beer."
"Pours a very clear light color with a small white head that tries to leave a thin lace.  The smell is a heavy lemon twang with nothing else coming through.  The taste is a little better than the smell revealing an earthy taste with a little bit of hop bitterness, but it is rather faint.  It has traces of a light spice, but this definitely has more characteristics of a lager than an ale!  Just fair in my book.  I think this is Canada's very own Bud ;-)  Cheers!"
"Very light and smooth are the defining characteristics of this beer. Not much taste difference than any other simple cheaper beer, but a bit more flavorful, and certainly not as nasty smelling. Doesn't have that terrible corn flavor either. All in all a refreshing crisp beer that goes down smooth. Good, but certainly nothing special. And it beats dirty Molson Ice any day."
"In conclusion, Molson is marketing a well done hybrid product that is really worth the money."
"doesn't seem like an ale to me, but it is a little dark in flavor, and smooth for an economic beer. it goes down with great ease, and it is no problem to have a few. a decent to good brew that you can drink with a good flavor and a medium body"
"I have to say that I kind of like this beer. It reminds me of apple cider. Starts off with kind of an apple flavor followed up by a hint of light malt. The flavor is kind of thin, but this is really not a bad beer. Not something that'll make it to the top of my list, but not bad."
"This is a decent macro. Yes, my tastes are more along the lines of any IPA, but when fresh, this beer is decent. Pours out to a bright yellow with a quickly fading head. Very light aroma, somewhat that of corn and grains. Taste is slightly bitter and sweet at the same time, albeit very light. O'Canada...someone start singing already. Is Hockey Night in Canada on the tube? In the Detroit area, Labatt and Molson products sell quite well. At one time, this was a huge seller all over the U.S. This particular beer has seen better days sales-wise, but is overall a decent beer."
"There once was a time in the early '80's when my friends and I thought that this was the best beer! (It had to be...it cost $2.65 a six back then!) But as I'm drinking one now, I laugh at that thought. Now it just seems like any other light-bodied mass-produced lager/ale. Hell, which is it anyway? Not something I'd go out and purchase myself these days, this one was one of a fresh 12 pak given to me. I don't know if it's me and my palate growing more umm, sophisticated, or the brewery's recipe being doctored over the years."
"A very light ale with very little flavor."
"A very pleasant beer, with well balanced hops and slightly sweet malt.  I like this a little better than Molson Canadian Lager."
