Slight tartness in the aftertaste. The bottle says, ""specially brewed for the unique flavor of an ale and a lager""but I'm not getting it. This is a garden-variety pilsner all the way.

The taste brings in more of the same, with both the wheat and the lemon gaining that usual macro funk (one day I'll find a better way to describe that quality (or lack thereof)). The body is pretty light, with a light moderate carbonation and a watery feel. Overall, a meek, bland, sad little beer. 'Nuff said, really.","TMoney2591","Jan 04, 2013"

It can get a little skunky, which to be honest, I really don't mind if it is not excessive. The alc kick is decent, and actually a little surprising as the flavor of alc doesn't come through at all. It is very, very drinkable, maybe a little too much so. I can down three of these in a half hour and not realise it.. until the buzz hits.. which is nice and smooth, not heavy and sickening. All around, a true favorite.","Curtis","Dec 28, 2012"

The aroma brings out a slightly metallic wheat grain that fills out into a somewhat pleasant peppery-yeast bread idea. Quite nice actually, and the metallic hint pretty much disappears. The taste is relatively light cereal grain with a citrus kiss. There’s a mild malt backbone that brings a sweetness into the blend that becomes more prominent as you get near the end. It’s medium light bodied with a tingly midland feel. This was one of my favorite beers during my youthful barhopping years, and is actually one of the few revisits that didn’t make me think now “what was I thinking then?”. Really pleasant and refreshing and I’m happy to know I can happily accept one if that’s what the host is offering.","Durge","Apr 12, 2012"

Your native ales taste fine warm (by which I mean Newcastle and Bass, I'm not a British Ale afficionado), but this beer does NOT warm well.

2.73,1.5,2.5,2,2.5,4,3.5,"Notes: Plain tasting, bland. Could be refreshing if it was 100* F and it was ice cold but then I would not even be drinking it for the taste.","Jason","Apr 01, 2003"
1.88,-30.1,2,1.5,2,2,2,"As the oldest brewery (1786) in North American you would expect something more than a beer that appeals to the American Mass-produced mega-beer palette. And when you're expected to pay extra because it's an ""Imported"" beer, the value declines further. A Yellowish/Gold color is unimpressive. The thin/medium malt presents a somewhat mealy odd tasting flavor. The hops are a little more noticeable than some of the American mega-brew counterparts. The lightly skunky aroma is less than pleasant. I do not like this very much!","BeerResearcher","Mar 13, 2003"
3.03,12.6,3,2.5,3.5,2.5,3,"Yellow to light golden with a small white head that disappeared quickly. Little lacing. Grassy nose with some faint maltiness. The taste was of malt with a small hint of hops at the end. This is pleasant beer that neither offends or impresses. I found the highly carbonated mouthfeel to be one of the strongest impressions.","AtLagerHeads","Mar 11, 2003"
2.56,-4.8,3.5,2.5,2,3.5,3,"pours out a clear darkish ""golden"" color...moderate head and a bit of lace. strong corn aromas....and a hint of floral hoppiness. sort of strange tasting....a dirty...or earthy maltiness....some adjuncts....a slight hop crispness in the finish. all this is propped up by a rather smooth and creamy mouthfeel that seems to be the only highly redeeming quality to this beer. not really impressed, and i clearly prefer the ""canadian"" molson over the ""golden"" counterpart.","budgood1","Feb 21, 2003"
2.91,8.2,3.5,2.5,3,3,3,"Crystal clear medium golden color with a thick snow-white head that fades, but remains to the end. Modest carbonation and very good lace. Aroma is very skunky and sulferous, not at all pleasant. Somewhere underneath all of the skunk, there seems to be some malt, hops, and hints of alcohol, but its hard to tell. Taste begins with slightly sweet maltiness which gives way to mild medicinal hop bitterness. Both malt and hops seem to fade to the end, with a clean and crisp finish. I suspect that this sample may be light struck (cursed be those who do not bottle beer in brown glass), but its really not that bad. Curious that this commonly-available beer has not garnered more reviews. And this is a pale ale??? Hard to believe...","Pegasus","Feb 09, 2003"

2.4,-10.8,2.5,2.5,2,2.5,3,"Clear dark yellow appearance, biggish head that clears to nothing in 20 seconds. No lacing in the pint glass. A blend of vague lemon and corn to the aroma, some tassel and pollen-like stuff going on. Taste is pretty stripped-down, a little bit of diacetyl and mild corn syrup, quite a bit of carbonation. Decent hop crispness late, not bad balance. The malts seem more at fault, this beer just doesn't generate a flavor profile. Can't really recommend this one.","ADR","Jan 16, 2003"

After enjoying the craftwork of Bill and Ron at Victory--materialized in the art that is Golden Monkey, I can say this...This isn't a beer, but sadly in comparison of many macros this is a good macro, which is why in the grand scheme of things i rated it as only ""a little below average"".","allboutbierge","Oct 27, 2002"
2.99,11.2,4,2.5,3,2.5,3.5,"Molson Golden is aptly named, as it is a pale goden color and pours with about a one inch nice white head.  The head slowly dissipates and leaves no evidence of its earlier prescence.  The aroma is faint, but has a hint of hops florals in it.  It smells very ""fresh"".  On the taste, the malt is evident, and the hops clean the palate fairly well, but there is a hint of something tha lingers, and I want to say it is butterscotch.  But it is just a hint.  After a few moments, an unpleasant bitterness reappears as an aftertaste.  The mouthfeel is typical macro-thin, but the drinkability is better than most macros.  This beer gives a fair blend of macro swill and micro thrill.","aaronh","Oct 27, 2002"

I take a can opener and pop another hole in the back of the can as I tilt my head and allow the sweet nector to fill my gullet. The only way to drink this ""beer"" is frat style. Not a sipping beer.","bewareOFpenguin","Oct 18, 2002"
2.75,2.2,2,2,3,2.5,3.5,"Pours a very clear light color with a small white head that tries to leave a thin lace.  The smell is a heavy lemon twang with nothing else coming through.  The taste is a little better than the smell revealing an earthy taste with a little bit of hop bitterness, but it is rather faint.  It has traces of a light spice, but this definitely has more characteristics of a lager than an ale!  Just fair in my book.  I think this is Canada's very own Bud ;-)  Cheers!","BeerAngel","Oct 12, 2002"
3.5,30.1,3,3,3.5,4,4,"Very light and smooth are the defining characteristics of this beer. Not much taste difference than any other simple cheaper beer, but a bit more flavorful, and certainly not as nasty smelling. Doesn't have that terrible corn flavor either. All in all a refreshing crisp beer that goes down smooth. Good, but certainly nothing special. And it beats dirty Molson Ice any day.","IrishRedRock","Aug 02, 2002"

3.36,24.9,2,3.5,3.5,2,4,"I have to say that I kind of like this beer. It reminds me of apple cider. Starts off with kind of an apple flavor followed up by a hint of light malt. The flavor is kind of thin, but this is really not a bad beer. Not something that'll make it to the top of my list, but not bad.","aracauna","Jul 11, 2002"
3.08,14.5,3,2.5,3.5,3,3,"This is a decent macro. Yes, my tastes are more along the lines of any IPA, but when fresh, this beer is decent. Pours out to a bright yellow with a quickly fading head. Very light aroma, somewhat that of corn and grains. Taste is slightly bitter and sweet at the same time, albeit very light. O'Canada...someone start singing already. Is Hockey Night in Canada on the tube? In the Detroit area, Labatt and Molson products sell quite well. At one time, this was a huge seller all over the U.S. This particular beer has seen better days sales-wise, but is overall a decent beer.","proc","Apr 25, 2002"

But as I'm drinking one now, I laugh at that thought. Now it just seems like any other light-bodied mass-produced lager/ale. Hell, which is it anyway? Not something I'd go out and purchase myself these days, this one was one of a fresh 12 pak given to me. I don't know if it's me and my palate growing more umm, sophisticated, or the brewery's recipe being doctored over the years.","beerluvr","Apr 16, 2002"
