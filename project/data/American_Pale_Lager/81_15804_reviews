"Interesting lager that is tequila flavoured. Has a hidden 6% ABV due to its sweetness and is better than the common economic lagers you find in the supermarket - the tequila taste is not at all awful."
"Okay, not really a beer. But given the unique flavor profile I can't say it was bad."
"It's yellow and has bubbles. The aroma is funky - there is a hint of tequila in this, I think. The taste is like a bad, flat-ish beer with a half shot of tequila in it. It is as bad as that sounds. The big can was just as bad as the bottle."

"Taste is too much lime for my liking, not fresh lime either."
"Fanta (orange), not sure is there tequila, but isn't that bad, too."
""
""
"Overall- Not my type of beer,  it could easily be a session beer for those who like this style."
"Having said all that I have to say the beer isn’t that bad. Once you get over the initial shock at all the sweet tastes, you do grow into it, and it does become a relatively smooth enough beer to drink.  I think these beers would be a great accompaniment to a night on the town, perhaps have two or three to give you a little kick in your drinking during the night, or before you hit the clubs. Any more than that and I’m not sure how they would go down. I don’t think I could drink more than two or three to be honest. But overall its a good effort and I like the idea of Desperadoes. Have I found the taste of the tequila? Not sure, but then does it matter, the beer has a certain function which is to set you up for the party or the night, and this beer does that perfectly. A good party beer."
"this beer is absolutely atrocious"
"Bad beer , with an artificial flavor"

"Watery at first but with an awful aftertaste which should be like Tequila but is something between detergent and artificial sugar. Disappointing at best."
"Light, soda-like, headless beer with a good dose of ginger... disappointed."
"I will not drink this beer unless there are no other choices."
"This sweet tasting beer says tequila but really has a very sweet agave and citrus taste to it. Lightly carbonated. I served this extra cold and it was liked by most at the tasting.  It could've had something to do with it being over 40 degrees Celsius at the time but who knows."
"Tastes like champagne, slightly sweet, but poor aftertaste."

"I thoroughly enjoyed it!  It's become one of my most favorite beers.  Originally tried it in Gatlinburg, TN.  Can't find it in Texas, but am looking."

"Overall this is a definite pass."

"The beginning deceives, because the taste that goes down the Adam's apple and is left in the mouth is very bad. Should be good for those who love tequila, but I was desperate after I took !!!"

"Appearance-wise it wasn't anything that started out overly impressive to me. Decent head, but no staying power. The smell though was the first hint that this was special. The perfectly mixed odor of tequila with the barley and malt was so sweet to the nose. The mouthfeel accentuated the smell - thick, crisp, and bold. The taste was what really blew me away - the lager flavor mixed oh so well with the tequila - I wish I had thought of this idea myself. Overall, it's a great beer - I am so glad I still quite a few of these left."

"OVERALL: When I first moved to Germany in 2002, a mate of mine and myself drank this stuff by the boatload. It was everywhere in the north, and people in their late teens and early twenties drank it at bars and clubs quite regularly. It still is quite popular in Europe among young people, and I see why. It's much more palatable than some of the grainy lagers that are readily available at bars, and for a young person just wanting to get a buzz without having to choke something nasty down, this is a fine option. It doesn't exactly taste like beer per se, but it's not trying to either. Most people just rate it into the ground because it's easy and accepted. However, it's certainly decent for what it is, and brings back some fun memories..."

"Picked this up, as well as others, while grabbing a La Familiar at a tiny Hispanic store. Probably in the minority here, but I thought this was ok. In fact, better than Tequiza. To me, it almost tasted like ginger ale beer, with a very slight hint of woodiness. Not saying I would regularly pick up a 6er or deucey duce of it, but it was palatable."

"Overall I'd have to say that this is just a gimmicky beverage that will run its course and disappear shortly. Of course you never know. I wouldn't recommend it, but if you're like me and you just have to try it to see what it's like I can give the go ahead for that. You probably won't want a second one, but it is easy to drink and you won't have any trouble finishing it."

"16$ a 6er +tax +deposit? I'd never buy this for any reason but I don't quite understand its reputation as one of the worlds worst."
""
"o - Overall a really bad beer in my opinion; struggled to drink half the 33cl bottle and drain poured the other half. Tequila and sweet sugar throughout, and the nose sucked. Would not recommend."
""
""
"M/D: medium bodied lite carbonation and the taste throws the mouthfeel. Overall very hard to drink and I will by tossing the rest of the beer."

"On the good side, it seems they used just malts and the 5.9% alcohol cannot be felt, whatsoever."

"Overall: very interesting beer. Not something you want or see everyday."

"I don't see myself drinking this one any time soon, since I don't use to mix my beer with any other alcoholic drinks. Maybe if I was 15 again and this one was really really cheap, I would prefer it."

"Pours bright gold in color.Clear appearance.White crown & large bubbles.Surprising retention.Thick lacing too.On nose, citrics & hues of alcohol.Sweet at first sip develops a honey/sirupy tasting.A real alcoholic soda pop.Well, this is not a cocktail at all but artificial flavors & aromas indeed.Not refreshing at all.Light body,medium carbonation.Drinkability?? just a beverage to forget & avoid.Even if you like Tequila and/or beer, you must´n try this."
"Overall: Not a beer, more a soda."
"O: I would try another one if you point a gun to my head..."
"Every picture I've since seen of the beer online has a lime wedge or two in the glass, and I wonder: why? This thing already tastes like 50% lime cordial, why does it need more lime taste to it? A beer brewed with tequila should actually attempt to highlight the naturally dry, tangy flavors of tequila; this did nothing of the sort. I could hardly finish this; it took all of us at the table to drink it down. I can see why Mexico would want no part of this beer - this was terrible..."
"Overall, what we found most enjoyable about this brew was its unique intent. While the aroma is questionable, to say the very least, it takes some bravery to produce a beer that is supposed to share some aromatics with something as stark as tequila. As lovers of tequila (on the side) we were not able to detect anything of the sort. The utter lacking of the advertised flavors with a beer, instead, as sweet as key lime pie, makes for little to be desired."
"The more of this I drink, the worse it seems to get. It has an odd aftertaste... but never fear! Add some lime or lime juice as you would reular tequila, clears up the aftertaste and finishes it off well."
"More beer stuff on my blog: abarwithnoname.wordpress.com"
"Dr: Please, let me have another. But lower the price! I don't know why all the other reviews are so poor, but I genuinely think this is a great and underappreciated beer. It challenges the conventions of what a beer ""ought to be"" according to the snobs. If you're truly a beer-lover, you really ought to give this one a try, if only to see how they handle the unique flavour of tequila (or perhaps more importantly, how they hide it beneath the mouthfeel)."
"Once I got used to the tequila it wasn't too bad, but not what my mouth was looking for when my eyes saw a nice cold beer. The tequila in the beer also hampers its ability to calm down the jalapenos on the nachos."
"Very drinkable it pairs very well with pizza or a steak in a warm summer night."
"50cl can: After seeing this everywhere in France the last few years, and having a few co-workers who drink the stuff regularly I broke down and tried one. BIG MISTAKE! This one pours a golden yellow color that is absolutely crystal clear. There was a fairly foamy white head on it that dropped away rather quickly. It has sort of an artificial lime aroma to it, as well as a bit of hay to the nose. Maybe a whiff of some bad tequila also. Beer? I really didn't smell any in there. The taste is a bit astringent. Some artificial lime and tequila taste. Sort of sickly sweet. Beer? Didn't taste any of that either. I don't think I'll be trying the other 2 in their lineup."
"D-Like I said, I used to find these highly drinkable, but then I grew facial hair. Might go well with nachos and guacamole, but not better than a real margarita or a decent lager."
"Notes: Is fairly reminiscent of a lemon/lime soda pop. Tequila isn't all that present, and I don't know if I would have detected any if I weren't looking for it. The weird lime sweetness is as bad as some of the American macro faux lime taste though."
"Well, hardly the car wreck I was anticipating - this is actually not a bad tipple, the overall effect to me is that of a decent (I know) lime lager - the Tequila sure wasn't particularly evident, as I have a pretty strong aversion to that particular flavour. The best part about this whole deal is, however, the ingredients listed on the bottle: the first listed is ""Beer."" Well, no shit. A gimmick brew that doesn't fall flat, who'd a thunk it?"
"The nose reminds a little lime and some strange and dubious Mexican condiments, the mouth is almost similar although the taste of beer, and that of tequila (although it is usually flavored with it), or completely absent. The finish is very sweet but the body seems very artificial and does not differ much in a simple lemonade somewhat boosted by a touch of alcohol."
"Overall, I didn't find it as bad as most reviewers did. This could make a good summer refreshment."
"Overall, I found this to be quite gross. I couldn't bring myself to finish off the last few mouthfuls."
"Avoid this one."
"Not sure I'd put this in the Euro Plae Lager category, but then where do you put it? Have to admit it would be killer served ice cold on a 30 celcius Medicine July afternoon, but then again I could probably make my own from some Kokanee. a splas of Tequila, and some store bought tequila lime mixer."
"Drinkability- Lessoned learded somethings from your past should be left alone."
"It also drinks like a soda, meaning it's watery and insubstantial, but also very drinkable. It's something you can sit and enjoy with a bud, but it's not something you'll remember as great."
"Strange. That's what comes to mind with this beer. From a clear bottle with a decidedly southwestern theme, the beer is supposed to be flavored with tequila. It's a light gold color with a soft and small head. The flavor is odd. It honestly smells more like a lemon-lime soda than a beer. Sweet and citric. The taste is similar...soda-pop citrus and sugar. It's less like beer than like candy. It's clearly aimed at someone who doesn't like the taste of beer (looks like beer, but tastes nothing of the beverage). The beverage is moderately carbonated, and medium bodied. It would be cloyingly sweet, except for the lemon-lime tang at the finish. No hop and no malt character. Soda-pop disguised as beer."
"This was actually far better than what my expectations had me assume. When I feel like a ""beer"" - even on a hot summer day - I couldn't really be satisfied with this. Although, even despite being (very) a sub-par beer this certainly would have it's place among many (myself, perhaps, included). I can't drink those ""alco-pop"" coolers (I find them far too sweet, sugary and artificial) but this Desperados beer would make a welcome substitute."
"Sweet and fruity across the board, but not cloying. Suitable for washing down a load of hot chicken wings, but not something to be seeking out."
"Avoid this drink like you would the plague!"
"Beer imitating soda pop, that's all this stuff is."
"This one time at a bar in France called Latin Club (pronounced Lah-teen Cloob) I was eating a cheese pizza with arugala (latin food) and drinking a 7-up when all of the sudden I tasted a little tequila in my 7-up. I looked down at the bottle and noticed that it was brown rather than the usual green. I looked at the labeldesparados? WTF? I looked around the joint and as some sort of New Kids like song started playing all these French and Arab kids starting dancing like Michel Stipes circa 1987. I couldnt figure out why they were acting so ridiculous until I looked at their hands. Desarados everywhere. Everybody was drinking these things, even the Arabs and Arabs dont drink. I suddenly realized that I was in the Twilight Zone so I got the F out of there and rinsed my mouth out with a tall boy can of Bavaria 8.0 that I bought off an Anarchist bum on the corner."
"Fischer in France has put out some gimmicky beers in the past, and this seems to fit the mark. A pale lager with Tequila flavour. The bottle fits the South American-Mexican genre: clear with a green and red embossed label. The beer poured with a decent head, large bubbled. A clear honey colour. The head actually stayed quite nicely at about 4 cm, and did not seem to move till I drank from the glass; it was actually the best part of the beer, staying creamy and consistent throughout my drinking. The lacing is super-thick. The beer smells like a Mexican-style lager with lime in it. There is a soft hint of tequila, making for a unique if not wholly appetising aroma. However, the malting smells good enough: sweet and sugary, with just a touch of grassy hops in the background. The taste is like light lime-flavoured water at first. The finish is more palatable, with some good Pilsner-style maltiness and a little bitterness. This really tastes like lime-flavoured water though. The mouthfeel is light with a little carbonation. This is probably fine freezing cold on a hot day, but as for redrinking marks, this rates pretty low. Interesting concept, gimmicky execution."
"Got this in Germany. I was getting a doener (similar to a gyro, only better), and saw this in the beverage case, figured what the heck, give it a try. Beer was a golden color with an okay head. Smell was almost citrusy and a smell of tequila. Taste had some honey to it and tequila to it. Mouthfeel, well, it was there, but it wasn't pleasant. Drinkability, sure, I was able to finish the bottle. It's not as terrible as it sounds but it's no where close to good."
"I have learnt my lesson. I will never drink novelty beers again. Ok.. Maybe the Chilli beer. I really wanna know how bad can it be?"
"one finger head. medium to dark medium yellow color and quite clear. smells a typical pils profile plus i definitely smell tequila. i like beer. not tequila. there is a strong tequila smell and flavor here. lightly carbonated. heavier mouthfeel than expected. no, i did not buy this. it was a gift. i very much appreciate the spirit it was given in. i did not finish this. i poured it out."
"the taste was sweet, i thought like honey, but you could definetly taste the tequila they said they have it it... i still dont understand why a french beer has tequila in it. i think this one is one to try, but i gave it a bad drinkability because it cost like 7 euros for a bottle, and that it wasnt so balanced with the tequila.... tequila????"
"You've really done it, here, I didn't know anything could ever be so wrong."
