"Fizzy head with modest retention and decent lacing. As clear as one could ask, for the style. Pours a golden yellow into pilsner glass. Smell denotes the onset of undesirable qualities, but not really present in the taste. The beer I had was probably a couple months past the best before date, but has not gone bad yet. Similar flavor and feel to a Dos Equis Lager Especial, but less sweet and less crisp. Slightly watery, not as carbonated as similar lagers, but then, as I said, it's past BBD."

"Just taste like a cheap beer"

"Middle of the road, light beer appealing to as many people as possible."
"Overall: light and easy drinking. Pleasant and should pair well with many foods."
"Pretty bland and average at best."
"When beer is just beer."
""
"Was part of the reunion 6 pack. It's just a macro style lager, but a bit better than your average bud, miller, or whatever, but nothing special. I wouldn't ever seek it out on it's own."
"2/7 (Home) Bottle - Decent smell and taste, though very bland and average beer."
""
"Thin, astringent a touch and had alcohol heat in the finish.  A bit  lacking in malty flavor and finished carelessly with a hops bitter."
""
"Great beer its good  i like it"
"A easy drinking lager. A dime a dozen but still enjoyable"
"Feel: gone immediately"
"O - nothing special here. I'd rather just drink an MGD or something"
""
"Easy-drinking chugger from Spoetzl. Not a lot of smell or taste for that matter. Maybe a step up from standard US macro brews, maybe not. I wouldn't turn it down on a hot day."
""
"Overall: Nothing special about this beer. Glad I tried it."
""
"Tastes like a metallic step up from Keystone."
"Pours nicely into pint glass, with a fine white head that has some lacing. Very mild malt aroma.  The taste is very blase, not much to it.  Fine for lunch on a work day, or a hot summer day when you are thirsty."
""
"Not a fan. Would not purchase and would not likely drink if offered for free."

"Not my usual sort of beer, but for what it is, it's quite serviceable- would be a good summertime thirst quencher. If you can find it Shiner Premium would be good as a slightly more upscale replacement for the standard American mega-lagers."

"Overall (3.73) : A great beer that I would purchase again and again. Better than the macros for sure, and much cleaner finishing. The only hit I would give it is that its taste is a bit lacking, but overall it's very malty and pairs with food well. It does what it's supposed to. Not a craft beer with tiers of flavor, so don't judge it by that. For what it is, and it IS a basic, no frills lager, it does a great job."
"Slightly above average, sweet, and clean lager.  Would not be the first I would go to, but not one to turn down either."

"Overall - I think this is a decent beer for the price (cheap). It won't blow your hair back, but it's worth a taste. Condor recommended and approved."

"It was a screw-cap, so no Pop!, but plenty of Glug as I nearly upturned the bottle just to see what would happen. I got a brief pseudo-cascade followed by the creation of three fingers of dense, fizzy, bone-white head that began to fall fairly quickly, leaving nice lacing in its wake. Color was Straw-Yellow (SRM = > 2, "

"There is a sweetness to the malty character in the flavor with grainy notes and a nice, clean hop bite to finish."

"Overall: Nothing too fancy, I always really liked shiner blonde and I love the rebranding with the old-school packaging. Great easy-drinking pale american lager. The only issue I have is when it tries to be more fancy than it is such as price. But if it is at the same price point as the other macro beers where ever you may be, then this wins."

"A solidly decent lager. Nothing particularly outstanding to write home about, but definitely a good option compared with many of its American counterparts. It has a crisp and clean mouthfeel. Great clarity. It's well balanced, but doesn't end up tasting like much of anything particular."
""
""
""
""
""
"However, the fact that its price is that of a premium beer, one would expect much more than this..What gives????... In my opinion, and it's mine and mine alone, I think Shiner needs to pack this one up and forget it. Seriously, I was really disappointed and I like some of Shiner's brews. This is a marketing focus opinion for free and it's brutal, but I'm being honest. All successful Companies know that you give your customer what they want and not what you think they'll like or need."

"Pours a crystal clear medium golden color with a decent sized bubbly white head that quickly dissipates to wisps of foam on top. Aromas of light bready pilsner malt with a hint of either caramelized sugar or caramel flavoring and a hint of prune type fruits. Very faint aromas of earthy spicy hops round us out. The flavor is a bit sugary sweet with hints of prune or fruit. Little to no hop flavor and just enough bitterness to keep this from cloying. Medium body with a moderate level of carbonation. Decent brew, but nothing to go out of your way to try like I did."

"It's the shiner version of budlight only about 10X the taste and mouthfeel. This stuff is what I'll reach for next time I want to drink some cold american lager. Pours golden clear with a thick white head on top. You can smell the grains and hops in it. The taste is very good with a hint of malt. Some grains and kind of a sweet taste that I can't figure out. Well worth the money."

"O: I said a lot of negative things here, but nothing was really all too bad. I think my biggest complaint is that it just doesn't take a stand anywhere. It's boring. Tastes like a cheap mid 20th century American brew. On the plus side, it's drinkable and nice and would probably be a perfectly acceptable camping or beer pong brew. Certainly it's better than most American macrobrews."
"I bought this beer as part of a variety six pack for about $8.50."

"Overall (2.25) : Not very pleased with this beer, however, it does have some qualities. It's refreshing certainly, good for very casual drinkers, just not the most ""tasteful""."
"Overall It's a good lager much tastier than the typical Stegmeier I pick up. If I see it again for a buck I will try and score a six pack."

"Had this as part of Shiner variety pack. Could be the most bland beer I have ever had. Nothing bad to really say, nothing off putting. It seems like all Shiner beers have the same appearance with different colors. And none seem to have anything going for the nose. This one has nohing wrong with it, very easy to drink. But it also does not really have anything good about it. Basically, meh, easy drinking but, again, meh."

"Poured this beer producing a robust foamy head the quickly subsided with little remnant. A light pale, clear appearance. Vaguely fruity, but not unpleasant aroma. Mouthfeel is decent, if not memorable. Very light taste ... equally unmemorable. Not a bad beer, but nothing distinguished to share with others."
""
""
"To good health and inoffensive beer."

"O: Not a bad lager, pretty average for the style, pretty average for Shiner."

"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle. Has a pale yellow color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is mild, some malts. Taste is light, mild, some malts and grains, almost like a light beer. Feels light in the mouth and overall is a mediocre brew, nothing offensive, just bland."
"Pours a clear, straw color. 1/5 inch head of a white color. Poor retention and poor lacing. Smells of pale malt, slight sweet malt, hint of hop, and adjunct. Fits the style of an American Pale Lager. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of pale malt, hint of sweet malt, hint of hop, and adjunct. Overall, the aroma and body are dominated by adjunct. Weak appearance and poor blend."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This beer might look like an adjunct lager, is definitely a cut above with less aromas and flavors of corn adjuncts and a mouthfeel that isn't watery."
""

"Pours a clear light yellow with a foamy off-white head that fades to nothing. No lacing on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, and grassy aromas. Taste is much the same with grain and grassy flavors on the finish. There is a very mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is an average beer that is easy to drink but fairly boring all around."
""
""
""
""
"Appearance is typical pale golden lager color. Smell is also typical with a grainy sweetness. Taste reminds me of Bud Light, if perhaps slightly better. Mouthfeel is fine, good carbonation. At the very least, a drinkable beer. Not the kind I would enjoy on it's own when just sitting at home unless I was in the right mood."

"O: Not very good, the taste is way too watery and there aren't any standout flavors. I think this is just a mediocre beer that just barely has more flavor than macro lagers."
"This is a solid session beer but i drank 8 last night and it wasn't strong enough. Good beer though."
"It's not offensive, but there's just nothing here. Pretty generic."
""
""
""
""
"This isn't a bad beer by any stretch. It isn't a beer I'd be quick to label craft, but it is a beer that is far superior to any macro/adjunct lager. This beer does have the qualities such as good drinkability that one would look for in a beer such as this. It's also refreshing with a low abv which makes it an ideal lawnmower beer."
"Atmosphere is pretty good. Shallow hue, giant head, lots of effervescence, and some pretty solid lacing. Nose is pale and bready. White bread with a slight hop and a hint of sweetness. Earthy and light. Overall, this is decent quaff."
"Overall, there is not much to this beer at all. A very light and easy drinking beer but not at all interesting. Not something i will pick up again."
"O: No bad. Not memorable either."
""
""
"Overall, far superior to most macro beers or for that matter most pale lagers brewed by microbreweries."
""

"Overall: Light, and not that great from a craft brewer. PBR or Hamms is better."
""
""
"Pours to a nice 1"" head that falls to a thin ring of foam that is permanent. Lacing is minimal. Color is pale gold. Aroma leans toward malt and a bit of white grape juice. Some hops detected in nose. Flavor is clean, crisp and refreshing. Pilsner malts with a balancing noble hop bitterness. Mouthfeel is appropriate to style. This is well made and easy to drink. A good summer session lawnmower beer without all the damn spices, fruit or funky yeasts."

"A buddy brought me this back from Texas with him. The label art is pretty cool...retro look to it. Poured in a shaker pint, the beer is a bright, yellow-gold coloring with a frothy, white, light head that quickly disappears to leave a clear surface behind. Steady flow of carbonation bubbling throughout. Aromas of roasted grains and a buttery sweetness. Not much else, really. Flavors of toast and corn, with roasted qualities throughout. Light palate on a thin body. The aftertaste is roasty as well. Slick, clean finish. This one strikes closer to an adjunct than anything else I can put my finger on."
"O - This is an okay lager. Fairly typical for a Shiner."
