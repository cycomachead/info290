"Very nice balance between a lager and ipa"
""
"Poured from bottle. Pale gold and clear with fairly good lacing. Aroma is light and fresh, florals and some lemon citrus, also a fairly nice crisp maltiness. Taste starts with some bready malts and light floral hops, crisp lager yeast, and a fairly subdued hoppiness, gets a bit tired near the finish, some stale skunky notes. Mouthfeel is light, lots of carbonation, and overall its some and easily sessionable. A decent IPL that gets a fairly boring quickly but works decently as a session option. Hops are mostly floral, with a bit of a fruity edge, and are decently robust."
""
""
"This one just didn't do it for me. Tasted too light with little body and didn't hold head retention well. Mouthfeel wasn't there as well."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A very smooth drinkable beer"
""
"Just alright only really had me dreaming about my next (better) beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"This pours a copper golden color. Nicely rounded floral aroma notes with some light citrusy hops and a light hoppy kiss on the flavor."
""
""
"I haven't had much from Magic Hat, but the other brews I had were more enjoyable than this one.  I did not care for this.  In my opinion, there is nothing that really jumped out at me with this beer; it was borderline bland."
"Good taste. Smooth and drinkable."

"Pours a hazy deep gold/pale amber producing 2 fingers of foamy, shortlived, white head that recedes to a thick island cap leaving sheets, webs & streaks of lace. Aroma is mostly grapefruit, pineapple & hints of pine in terms of hops; pound cake and  little caramel malt in a background of pilsner yeast. Taste  is bready, lemon zest, resinous pine, tropical fruit, lager yeast & a little honey up front through mid-sip, finishes with a prominent grapefruit note becoming drier & more bitter with a rapidly diminishing bitter, but noticeably astringent, aftertaste. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with low moderate carbonation, silky & slightly creamy with a tongue coating bitterness that becomes an astringency on the back of the tongue & palate. Not really an IPA as it is made with lager rather than ale yeast. An interesting mixture of hops & yeast as are most of these IPLs."
""
""
""
"1/19...pours copper gold, high white foam, over an inch and lasting. Pleasant hoppy nose, toffee, malty. Light citrus. Clean, crisp taste, honey, floral, quick fade before the bitter closes. Good carbonation buzz. Very good."
""
"I really like this beer, good tasty beer, nice balance of malt and hops, first IPL I've tried."
"Decent lager, my camping beer."
""
"Not a very good one."
"Overall:  Wow, what a really nice beer.  I wasn’t sure what to expect, never having tasted an IPL, but this is really nice.  There’s a good balance between the hops and the malt.  Recommended."
""
"O: Not my favorite, but I could drink it if it was available."

"Not hoppy Enuff for an ipl, little bit of a metallic taste, but could be the draft equipment at this place, I would give it another shot at a different place, maybe the brewery"
""
""
""
"A very well rounded and drinkable pale lager."
""
"Nice IPL, clear hoppy taste. Well-crafted Lager for hopheads. Having this fresh, in my opinion this is definitely under rated. I would rather have this to almost all standard Lagers."
"Serving type: bottle"
"I like Dream Machine, but I don't love it. It's bitter enough to want to cook with rather than drink, and as a beer for cooking, it's quite good. I've used it in the crock pot with chicken a half dozen times and it really adds something to it."
""
""
""
""
"A nice discovery for a non-hophead. Good balance between hops and malt. Plenty of malty sweetness especially toward the end."

"This beer is ok.....it doesn't stack up to the Magic Hat.  The beer is lighter in body with good carbonation.  The color is  a hazy orangeish yellow with a creamy white head that is leaving a lace.  The taste is more bitter than anything.  Glad to have tried it but wouldn't go back to the well for this one."

"12 ounce bottle into lager glass, no bottle dating. Pours slightly hazy golden orange color with a 1 finger dense and rocky off white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of lemon zest, orange peel, pine, honey, cracker, biscuit, herbal, floral, grass, light pepper, and herbal/grassy earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance of citrus/pine hops and moderate bready malt notes; with solid strength. Taste of lemon zest, orange peel, pine, honey, cracker, biscuit, herbal, floral, grass, and herbal/grassy earthiness. Fair amount of pine/grassy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of lemon zest, orange peel, pine, honey, cracker, biscuit, and herbal/grassy earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Nice balance and robustness of citrus/pine hops and bready malt flavors; with a good malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Nice clean lager flavor with minimal yeast esters present. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth and fairly crisp/sticky mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very solid IPL style. Good robustness and balance of citrus/pine hops and bready malt flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A nicely enjoyable offering."
"Its quick finish keeps the body medium-light but lingers with the gripping and undeniable leafy astringency of the hop cone. Its chlorophyll linger onward along with bitter resins and waining tobacco herb."
""
""
"Overall, i enjoyed it, though it's not necessarily something I'd pick up again. It's well-balanced, but doesn't really offer much I'd seek out--drinkable and enjoyable, in an interesting style, but not something I'll be keeping an eye out for."
"Great citrus palet with a smooth finish. Well balanced."

"Pours a dark amber almost brown with a cream colored head that fizzes away pretty quickly. The smell is full of floral notes but there is a little bit of caramel from the malt. The taste is hop forward in the beginning and then mellows out to a refreshing finish with a sweet aftertaste. The mouthfeel was nice as well. A bit average on all fronts but a nice beer none the less."
"This Dream Machine style ""IPL"" was new to me. I enjoyed the different notes of flavor it provided."

"new summer seasonal is probably underrated here, its pretty nice on tap, and while obviously a step or two below the quality of say a jacks abby ipl, I think its a pretty reasonable take on the style. darker than most lagers, deep honey colored and a little hazy. head is tall and frothy in my pint glass, it looks real nice. nose is generic but hoppy like an ipa, they certainly didn't short cut the india part of this. some bittering citrus peel notes to the finish but mostly sappy bitterness, lots of texture for a lager, which I like a lot. well carbonated and refreshing, but not finishing up as quick as other lagers. the hops outlast the attempted quick finish, it doesn't work out real well, but it doesn't affect the overall enjoyment of this beer, just makes it feel more like an ipa. not sure why all the negative feedback on magic hat lately, I think they still do a really good job with a lot of their beer, and have enjoyed most of the new releases..."

"The appearance was an rich amber color. The smell had some fruit notes in it (apricot). . Not bitter or strong when going down, smooth. When poured a nice thick head forms. Nothing special otherwise about the beer Although I could see my self purchase another should the occasion arise."

" If this is what comes out of Dream Machine, I'd be frightened to taste Nightmare Machine."
""
""
""
"OVERALL: This is a pretty refreshing beer from Magic Hat. Essentially a hopped up Vienna Lager, and not a bad option."

"Magic Hat Dream Machine ---3.5/5"
""
""

"Dream Machine brewed by the Magic Hat Brewing Company, with an ABV of 5.7 % This brew pours out a nice dark amber color with a small, white head. Dream Machine is a filtered brew you can see right though it. The appearance is decent to this brew. The smell is bitter with hops and grains. There is some richness to this brew in this smell.Not too big on the smell of this brew. Dream Machine taste is ok with a bitter after taste of hops. The taste at first is smooth but it is over powered by bitterness. The bitterness to this brew is to much for my taste. Mouthfeel is nice at first but, bitter at the end. Not a bad finish to this brew. Overall In'm giving this brew a 3 out 5."
"O: an exceptional version of this style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - If I deciphered the code right, this was bottled on March 18th, so probably not too old to kill the hops, this is just a very average IPL that shows more malt than hop. It will be quickly forgotten."
""
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. has a caramel color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of citrus, hops, some malts. Taste is refreshing. Malts, some hops, a bit of citrus, smooth. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is how a pale lager should be."

"Overall great beer and glad it'll be year-round!"
"This was a very unique and interesting pale lager, and I liked it a lot."
""
""
"Quite lagery in flavor and body, has some component that is reminding me of using flaked corn in the grist in that there's a consistently sweet element in a beer that's really pretty dry. Body is fairly light and refreshing, with a sweet finish. Possibly a touch of diacetyl present. Hoppiness is pretty pronounced but not quite to the scale of any given modern American IPA; it's more like a crisp pale ale. An interesting choice, not really similar to other IPL's I've had."
""
"Pours a clear, copper color. 1/3 inch head of a white color. Good retention and great lacing. Smells of earthy malt, hops, slight alcohol, hint of yeast, and slight pine. Fits the style of an American Pale Lager. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of sweet malt, alcohol, hops, hint of floral, slight alcohol, and a hint of earthy malt. Overall, good appearance, aroma, and blend, the body is a little weak."
""
""
"Nice with some good flavor."
"Overall: A nice blend between the two. At first it is almost taste like an IPA, but then the malt kicks in. I would have it again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - sometimes you gotta tick. This beer is not horrible. It is drinkable, but extraordinary it is not. I'll not buy more, but I'd not turn down a free one either."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Straw yellow colored with fine bubbles rising up to a white tightly bubbled head that recedes quickly. Aroma of creamed corn and cotton candy, floral notes. Flavors of honey malt, peppery spiciness, some burnt rubber offering sharp bitterness. Hops are subtle, somewhat floral and spicy. Mouthfeel is a bit slick, but finishes tingly. Overall an okay beer."

" 3.75 overall, a favorable slot. I was very impressed on how this brew truly DOES maintain a great balance of IPA and lager tastes and sensations. I will probably buy this again."
"Dark honey, and somewhat cloudy, with a quarter inch quickly dissipating head, but good lacing. A fresh scent, but nothing of note on the nose. Nice carbonation, and drinkable. A nice hop bitterness that lingers, but lacks the fruitiness of the IPAs I prefer. A decent beer."

"Final Thoughts: I've had very few IPLs since the style has started taking off, but Dream Machine is definitely at the bottom of my list. The metallic flavor and lack of hop character make that decision an easy one. Would I drink it again? Probably not."

"Yes...it's actually pretty good.NO or is not amazing bit it has a nice bit to it on my palate and it has a drinkable factor to it because it is a lager. Is it my favorite beer? No. Is it am awesome version of a lager? Yes. I would definitely give this brew a shot before you judge. It has the awesome aroma of an IPA, along with the hoppy bite, however it's got the clean finish like a lager. Just drink one and decide.That is all..."

"Overall meh, not a well done lager, on top of that not the best grain profile, and even more so the poor hop choice, more like an English bitter than IPL, forest floor herbal medicinal hops that are not tasty, starts with almost no bitterness then huge bitterness on the back and and finish, just not a well done beer all around."
""
""
""
""
""
"overall...decent but I probably won't get it again."
"Overall I didn't think was a great beer and I didn't think that it was a good example of the style, when I got to the aroma I thought it was going in the right the direction, but it seemed like it took a turn for the worse when it got to the taste and all I was left with a bland lager with an almost equally bland hop profile. This didn't have the best drinkability, it was fairly smooth, a little clean, crisp, not too filling and the taste didn't do a good job at holding my attention, one is a little more than enough for me, no way I would want to drink another one in a row. What I liked the most about this beer was the appearance, aroma and mouthfeel, those were the highlights of this beer and they seemed to all be pretty true to style. What I liked the least about this beer was the taste, it was just bland all around and this is the first time in awhile that I have had a beer that didn't have any aftertaste. I wouldn't buy this beer again and I wouldn't recommend trying it either, it's priced nicely but it isn't a great example of the style. All in all I didn't like this beer, it had some nice aspects, but I thought the taste was a let down and it just didn't deliver what I wanted it too. So far this is one my least favorite beers from Magic Hat and there's not doubt that it is now my least favorite IPL or hoppy Lager. Better luck next time guys, this beer need some major work in the taste department."
""
""
"A hoppy brown lager? Seems what it's like to me strangely, and not too bad either. To style I am not so sure or what, but it's a decent beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Okay, I drank the damn thing, now where's my Untappd badge?!"
""
"It has a golden color body with a small thin, foamy head. The aroma gives off a pale, lager malt notes, no hops present. The tastefirst starts off with a lager flavor then some citrus hop come in on the finish. Thw mouthfeel is definitely more like a lager than a ipa. Overall its good but in my own opinion it needs to be more balanced."
""
"Man, how long has it been since I last had a Magic Hat? Regardless, this one pours a clear sunset amber topped by a finger of lightly off-white foam. The nose comprises mixed greens, nutty toffee, and grass. The taste starts off with a small wave of sweet fruits, but things quickly degenerate into a lasting riot of rotting greens, bad cabbage, and pennies. The echoes resonate for minutes. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a fluid feel. Overall, I have no idea what to say about this mess, beyond it is pretty terrible. Maybe there was a reason I haven't had a Magic Hat brew in a while..."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall nothing special but a decent IPL. Try it!"
""
""
"That first bit sounds like a a CANadian version of Dr. Timothy Leary, eh, hoser? My aggro pour netted two fingers of dense, rocky, tawny head with great retention. They know how to engineer their beers in Vermont, I'll tell you. Nose smelled much like being on a working farm and not in a bad way. The malts were prevalent, very fresh and grainy and the hops provided a fresh-mown grassiness that put me in mind of summers at my grandparents' house. Color defined amber (SRM = >7, < 9) with NE-quality clarity. Mouthfeel was soft and full, a nice change from some of the abrasive AIPAs that I have been drinking of late. Taste was not really up to expectations, however. It had an odd finish of hydrogen peroxide, a taste that I remember from having contracted trench mouth from someone at summer camp. Gentian violet and hydrogen peroxide were the watchwords and I have never forgotten the tastes. Initially, it was okay, but the finish finished me off. Oof."
""
""
""
""
""
"Easy on carbonation. They skimped a little there. The body is comparable. Drinks like a cinch. Could easily follow up with another one. Good stuff."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Quite bitter for only being 50 IBUs, it could definitely do with a bit more malt sweetness to balance it out. Definitely feels more like an ""English"" IPL than an ""American"" IPL, if you get my drift"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This one should please the bitter hop lovers."
" The flavor is not what I expect from a beer that promotes itself as an India Pale Lager...it has the lager characteristics with smooth flavor but bitterness level is medium, a little like a highly hopped pilsner with toasted malt taste and noble accent as it finishes very clean. Overall it is a decent lager, but doesn't fit the India Pale lager label in my opinion, drinkable for what it is"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall forgettable beer. I'll pass this over for something with more flare and flavor."
""
""
""
"o. Overall this is between a 3.25 and a 3.5, but will go higher to give benefit of the doubt. Would not revisit. Honestly expected more from this beer."
""
"This dissapointing ale pours a handsome amber hue with a nice white head and lasting lacing. The nose is an overly sweet floral mix of hops, malt , and European yeast. The mouth is smooth and easy to drink but given the taste why would you want to. The flavor follows the nose with way too much sweetness and a floral hop bill that does not help the sweetness. I enjoyed the last few Magic Hat releases but this is definitely a miss."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a clear honey orange with a foamy orange-tan head that settles to a partial film on top of the beer. Small streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, earth, and herbal hop aromas. Taste is much the same with earth and herbal hop flavors on the finish. There is a medium amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is an average beer that smells pretty good, but there is an odd metallic taste at first that only goes away as the beer warms up."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The taste is in the opposite order with a quick introduction of sweet, caramel malts and then an eruption of citrus hops to finish it off. But altogether it is entirely smooth. Fairly drinkable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is a solid pilsner, but the flavor profile feels funny."
""
""
""
"This beer is quite amber hued. Which is a nice lead that turns into a pretty bland ride. Minimal hop influence. Minimal everything really. It's just...bland. Too bad my next beer isn't chilled yet. Otherwise I'd be finishing this one as quickly as possible and moving on."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, mild kick, good representation of style, this is a solid beer to drink for while."
""
""
""
"Pours a classic, light pilsner color, pretty modest/weak head. Smell is classic pilsner with a nice subtle shot of citrusy hops. Taste is similar. You can absolutely taste the hops and this would be an enjoyable twist on the classic pilsner on a nice, hot day. Nothing to write home about, but good. I'd drink it again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- not a terrible beer, but I've had hoppier lagers that didn't boast the ipl label."
"I'm not sure how Magic Hat let such a weak, miserable example of this style out of their tanks. I have had several other examples that kick the ass of this pathetic shit, such as Brewmaster Mike's Citra Mantra (represent!)."
"Overall, this is an impressive beer, well worth the wait from Magic Hat. It has a great hoppiness to it that hopheads will love, without being too much, as some IPA/IPLs can be."
