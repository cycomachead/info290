Not a watery macro, but more along the lines of Coors Banquet. Real strong taste of honey upfront. I could even taste some light green tea like flavors (think a cup of ice green tea with three teaspoons of honey). I was feeling it but after awhile it got a little cloying; which contradicts the fact that it has a very thin mouthfeel. It's not bad, but it's not great either. I would try it again on a hot day, or even if I had a sore throat, because the honey in this beer would probably soothe it. I'd like to make a note that the ABV on this beer isn't 6.5%. Unless they changed it, because it states it's 5.5% on the label of the bottle I had.","KLAYNE87","Feb 10, 2012"

2.71,-6.6,3.5,2.5,2.5,3,3,"This was recommended by my firends at Knightly Spirits. It pours a light golden color with plenty of white foam and a meager lace. The aroma is definitely earthy, a bit stank and skunky, not real inviting. The flavor is a bit more encouraging where you pick up on the honey idea but it is only vaguely sweet, more leaning toward bready and bisuit with this over riding stagnant water affect that is not particularly rewarding. It is kind of unique, maybe worth a try for those that like variety. Personally I would actually like to have more of a sweet honey flavor than what this pilsner offers, but it's OK. I would drink it again but I won't seek it out. It offers an average mouth feel with moderate carbonation, easy enough to drink as a relatively light and refreshing beer but the stagnant water idea sort of turns you off from over indulgence. It is somewhat true to the pilsner form so proceed accordingly.","Durge","Nov 13, 2007"
1.67,-42.4,3.5,1.5,1.5,2,1.5,"The taste is a big mix of honey and orange that's slightly pungent...that's the good part. The honey, I think, is over done and drags the taste down with its earthy, semi sweet, not so tasty flavour. I think they need go a different route because this doesn't work too well. Hell of a retentive head of foam though!","Bitterbill","Oct 19, 2007"

The smell is grainy malt with a touch of sweet honey. The taste much like the aroma is grainy with a touch of sweetness from the honey flavors. Overall, this brew tastes pretty much like a macro-lager with some honey flavors. I really have no interest to try this again.","cjgator3","Sep 30, 2007"
3.15,8.6,3.5,3.5,3,3,3,"Clear, sharp, golden yellow color with more life than normally seen in a pilsner. An effervescent crush of bubbles right on the pour and then no head to speak of. A light bit of grain in the nose with a note of honey that is expected but nonetheless pleasant and authentic. Unfortunately, there's not much to the taste besides that honey, complemented by a hint of orange. The underlying grains have little character, but the honey at least doesn't overassert itself. Mouthfeel is a little watery but is partly redeemed by a nice bit of crispness in the finish. This one is fine for a fruit beer. Rather a one-trick pony but not so overdone as many fruit beers, but this one plays it too safe.","BitteBier","Jul 08, 2007"

Smell was sickeningly sweet and to be honest, there was almost a faint smell of natural gas present here. In short: It stinks. Taste is kind of hard to pinpoint. There is a faint element of honey here and it's a little bitter, but to really describe it is rather difficult. Mouthfeel is water thin. At the very least, now I can say that I've tried it. Totally not for me, though.","SilentSabre","Jul 02, 2007"

Light medium body with strong carbonation. Taste is unremarkable. American light lager characteristics dominate. Vegetal and corn syrup notes, but not strong enough to taste bad. Fizzy carbonation suggests a mass market lager. Not much to recommend it. Contract brewed in Maryland.","merlin48","Apr 23, 2007"

A bit of citrus character linger on through to the finish, but a thin watery-beer character is what wins out in the finish.

There is not much of a smell at all with the exception of faint orange aroma. The hop flavor is almost non existant which I found odd especially for a "pilsner". The overall lack of flavor is reminiscent of a macro however unlike a macro this beer does not contain stron rice or corn flavors. It has the "beer" taste to it with a faint orange added in but overall the taste is just weak. The mouthfeel is a tad watery but pretty average overall. As far as drinkability goes, it is hard to call a beer so mild undrinkable. The beer isnt so much bad as it is weak. It definitly could use some more hops.","MSchae1017","Jan 04, 2006"
