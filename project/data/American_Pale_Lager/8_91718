Consumed within best by date, so freshness is not an issue. There's just not a lot good to say about this - one of the things you look for in a lager is a crisp, clean, and refreshing beer, and this one just doesn't really deliver. It's not the worst beer, but it sure ain't a great one. Very mediocre.","Redneckwine","Jan 24, 2015"

3.88,4.6,3.75,3.75,4,4,3.75,"Poured straight down into a large tulip. One finger head that settles down in under two minutes into white froth on the surface of the beer with noticeable lacing. Appearance is clear deep gold. Nose is somewhat subdued and features sweet, light malt with hints of sweet toasted grains, light orange and apricot, subtle grassy notes, and florally hops. Taste is sweet up front with the bitterness of the hops hitting on the midpalate. The flavors are nicely arranged with bittersweet grapefruit dominating, though not completely overpowering, a very pleasant floral, light honey sweetness showing sweet orange peel. Mouthfeel is slightly slick and very light with moderate, pleasant carbonation. The finish, which is surprisingly thin and short, is dominated by the bitter grapefruit as well as a slightly fruity sweetness with hints of ripe honeydew, orange, and apricot. This is the first time I’ve had an India Pale Lager (IPL), and if they’re all like this, then I’m sold. As others have pointed out, you get a light, crisp beer that also features both the floral complexity of a hoppy IPA as well as a nice dose of bitter citrus. This is almost the definition of perfect, sessionable, warm weather beer, though the well-hidden abv of 6.7 could pack an unexpected wallop.","8stringfan","Apr 04, 2014"

It turned out to be exactly what I would think it would be based on the name of the style - the appearance and mouthfeel of a lighter lager with the pleasant hop profile of an APA. Since I'm getting too old to knock back 4-6 IPAs or even pale ales, this is a wonderfully sessionable beer. I would definitely recommend this to someone who likes hop profile but wants something nice and easy. I'll definitely be going back for more.","Beldark","Dec 11, 2013"

Appearance is clear golden yellow lacing present throughout with a nice creamy head that stays throughout. Taste is crisp with a slightly salty bitterness that is pine and roasted malts and pepper. Great balance and it finishes peppery but not bitter. Lager like finish with hops everywhere. This is almost a sessionable IPA/IPL from Widmer’s rotator series. Its exceptional medium to light body with good carbonation and a long finish. Its what I expect from the series which has featured amazing others including O’Ryely and Falconers IPA’s. Its a perfect IPA choice for someone who normally doesn’t like IPA’s.","JHS123","Nov 20, 2013"

This one is middle of the road; nothing wrong, not much to love. The hops are loud and forward, but the blend is a bit bitter and earthy. Some dried orange taste comes close to fruity, but almost cloved orange. Big punch for the abv, worth a shot but I'll pass on a 6er.","HardTarget","Nov 11, 2013"

The nose is full of hops, bright, citrusy, mildly rind-like and moderately pith-like. Clean, snappy and refreshing, this is solid. A touch of sweetness is present. The palate opens with a moderate bitterness, rather resiny with pine and citrus. This is followed with a rather clean hop flavor - grapefruit, pine, some orange - with no real grassy flavors. The mid-palate has a little bit of caramel, but what is striking is the mineral character on the finish that works really nicely with the snappy, resiny hops. Medium-light in body and moderately carbonated, this feels decent on the palate and has a nice, hoppy finish. Alcohol is a lot higher than it needs to be (IMO) but otherwise, this is a winner.","DefenCorps","Nov 07, 2013"

There is a mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel.

The nose comprises mixed greens, mild pine resin, and a soft caress of cereal grains (I'm leaning toward clean oatmeal here). The taste brings in more of the same, with the pine a bit sharper and the grains coming across more like a light bit of cornbread. The body straddles the border between hefty light and light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a fluid feel.

Big citrus and herb nose; slightly piney and resiny, with a malted cereal smell, like cream of wheat. Taste follows the nose with a very caramel, toasted flavor coming in after the initial hop charge. Not as bitter a backbone as other IPAs's (even though this is not an IPA), and slightly drier than one would expect considering the strong caramel flavors. The lager yeast gives this beer a clean and dry finish that is very appealing, leaving only the flavor of citrus hops and malty bread to linger. Not the bitter hop bomb that most drinkers seem to want, but still a drinkable and everyday hop heads beer.","Aaron_Ramson","Aug 29, 2013"

Flavor follows with sweet bready malt, nicely mixed citrus and stone fruit juices and some suprisingly robust citrus hops in the flavor and finish. Good balance. Medium bodied with some creaminess. A nice lager that could pass as a low key American IPA, which probably would be a better style designation for it, although it would be in tougher competition.

Nose is decently hoppy with some grass elements coming off this one to me and just a little bit of that lager corn smell in there. Taste is much the same, with a hefty amount of bitterness from the hops and a hint of the lagery sweetness at the end.","maxwelldeux","Jul 14, 2013"

Aromas of biscuit, cedar pitch, pepper, canibus, and a lemon and grapefruit tart sweetness. Very balanced nose. Flavors are very bitter forward, with a dry, resinous cedar and grass character, blended with floral highlights and a toasted grain backbone. Resin and citrus sweet plows straight through to the aftertaste, with a bitter, dry, slightly resinous finish. This is a tasty beer, and much more hop-centric than other IPLs have been able to accomplish.","GarthDanielson","Jul 08, 2013"

Certainly a unique brew, combining the aspects of both an IPA and an all malt lager. However this proves to be a double edged sword. While this beer is more refreshing than your standard IPA thanks to the cleaner finish and lighter mouthfeel, it also looses complexity and aroma characters. On the flip side, it is more interesting than your standard lager, but not nearly as refreshing due mostly to the strong hop aftertaste. I commend this beer for trying something new and would gladly drink it again, but don't see myself going too far out of my way to get it.","Bockrules","Jun 10, 2013"

Has all the crisp clean features you like from a lager, but there is a nice follow through of hops that makes it a much more interesting beer.
