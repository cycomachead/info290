3.58,12.6,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.75,"After popping the Discovery Series cap it pours in to a proper Guinness pint glass, forming a 2-finger head of cream colored foam. The beer has a striking golden/orange hue with impressive clarity. Fantastic staying power on the lumpy, sudsy foam. Pale malts, biscuit and light citric hop scents greet the nose. Hints of berry sweetness and a bit of buttery diacetyl are also present in the aroma. The flavor is... odd. Surprising. It's a strange blend of malty cracker goodness with a bizarre, unique quality. Perhaps from their traditional Guinness yeast strain. It's a little funky, but compelling. The finish is mildly bitter, with a faint lemon citrus and traces of earthy, minty hops. Somewhat incongruous, but distinct. The body of the beer is moderate, with assertive carbonation that lends a creamy effect. This one is a bit of an enigma. It's like stripping a Guinness stout to the bones to accentuate the unique flavors that the yeast imparts. I found this one oddly appealing.","JohnnyI","Mar 01, 2015"

I was in a Kroger so there weren't a lot of options for good beer, so I decided I'd give this a try because I was in the mood for just a drinkable Lager.  When I poured it, there was virtually no head on the beer.  However when I took a swig, I was extremely surprised.  Carbonation is great, it basically tastes like a decent nondescript lager.  Just your normal caramelly/malty taste.  For a drinkable beer that you can sit there and enjoy a 6-pack, it's great.  Mouth feel is exactly what I want, nice and crisp with very little aftertaste.","Beardedcap","Feb 23, 2015"

The smell is rich with grains, malts and some hops. Now for the taste, it is rich with flavor.  You pick up malts and grains in this brew.  It tastes like a lager. There is nothing overpowering in this brew, it has a nice balance to it.  Guinness Blonde American Lager has a nice drinking brew. The mouthfeel is nice and clean.  This is my kind of beer.

The aroma is predominantly sweet with fruity sour Belgian yeast a hint of banana bread and grass. Nicely crisp up front with the American hops providing a short burst before yielding to more Belgian sweetness. That's pretty much all there is to speak of as the beer takes on a very standard lager personality with a semi-dry finish. I''m not a lager aficionado, but this is definitely drinkable and certainly not offensive. I would say that it is superior to Full Sail Session Lager and also to Budweiser.","doublenaughtspy","Nov 27, 2014"

Taste is clean, malts, some honey sweetness, a bit of grains, highly refreshing. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a smooth session beer.","tone77","Oct 17, 2014"

The inclusion of mosaic hops was interesting, and adds a unique spin on the beer that isn't too gimmicky. Guinness Blonde is at least worth a try.  With that said, there are other American lagers I would prefer in this price range.","enjambed","Oct 14, 2014"

3.34,5,3.5,3.25,3.25,3.5,3.5,"go figure, guinness makes a blonde american lager, so many things wrong with that if you are a traditionalist, but i guess they need something to compete with the other macros and crappy imports, read heineken and stella. the packaging says there is mosaic hops in here, which really has me curious, didnt know supply andprice point worked for such a big brand with that varietal, but apparently it does. not much of that new zealand fruitiness to the hops though, i can only barley get the mosaic in the nose. the beer is a shade darker than its new rivals, not yellow but brassy golden, and it has a lot of body too compared to those, which makes it better than them for me. its got some hops in the finish, but mostly bitterness, and a salted buttery cracker malt base that actually tastes like something other than adjuncts. frothy feel too, with expressive carbonation and a longer finish. in the context of what its competing against, i think its a great success actually. in the context of craft lager though, no, its not real great. for a macro i think it has every reason to do well.","StonedTrippin","Oct 12, 2014"

What starts out with malty sweetness and a smooth and refreshing middle ends with a slight and welcomed bitter, this is a very drinkable and tasty beer that supports the style and is a solid brew overall. I for one like to explore all the styles and new offerings with an open mind and won't be swayed by the popular vote...I like what I like and rate it as how true to the style a beer is and my take on the taste of the beer....as true as I can be...this is a winner.","Bear1964","Oct 05, 2014"

Some spotty lacing is seen but not much. The aroma is of hops and yeast for the most part. The taste is more complex with some light fruit in there as well. Really didn't go down all that easy and there was a bitter aftertaste that lasted a bit more for my liking. Really not my style.","BeerWithMike","Sep 27, 2014"
