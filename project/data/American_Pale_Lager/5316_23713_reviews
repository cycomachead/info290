"Great beer. Fun to have at a party to play rock, paper, siccisors."
"Love the taste and the smaller size . Feels good to hold the fat bottle and the taste is great with steaks or a cookout like hot dogs or hamburgers."

"O; no complexity; not very interesting;"

"Great beer for summer day mowing the yard and running the bbq"
"Not a bad lager. Much better than a popular/traditional big market brand."

"Just not a good lager for my tastes. Almost to sweet for me."

"Drank this right out of the bottle at Just Jakes in Montclair. Nice and crisp but nothing totally stood out. Probably my mistake by drinking this directly after a stronger IPA, I may not have gotten the full effect. Overall, enjoyable enough though."

"Overall:  Would be a fine party or tailgating beer."
"O. Still looking for the salsa to get rid of the wrong type of bitter that's still hanging around."
""
""
"Tasty, refreshingly hopped pale lager. I love that this lager is commonly available and well priced. I knocked a few points off for the 11 oz bottle, which I think is a cheesy move."

"Great times with this great session beer.  More full bodied than almost anyother session ive drank overall a winner,  be sure to try fest and black lager"

"O-This is a simple lager, but not boring. My example was a week past its ""best by"" date, so I'm not surprised that the hops had faded. I can imagine a fresh bottle being a bit more complex and balanced, but even this old bottle made for a nice after-work quaff."
""
""
"Easy to drink. Excellent alternative to American macro-brews at a comparable price."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: There is a lot of flavor in here for a pale lager. The all-,alt characteristics really shine through without affecting the mouthfeel. The name speaks the truth, this is a great session lager when you want something full-flavored and unoffensive. I would offer this to even the strongest naysayers of craft beer."
""
""
"wow! I bought this as something new to try. it was on the bottom shelf and cheap 11 bucks for a 12 pack. the mouthfeel is awesome and maybe a little salty but it was GOOOOD! im not a huge fan of lagers as i prefer IPA or malt liquor but this did ir for me. I could drink this all night long. Taste was crisp and yummy, a little hops a little malt no corn. straw yellow looking poured into a pint glass. just the right amount of bubbles salt and flavor...light tasting but with just enough charachter to grab me and slap me and drink another! this stuff rocks!!!"
""
"Light straw like complexion the head was practically non existent. The nose is full of straw, and grain but I think I caught a little Apple. The flavors have a grain and barley character with some cereal maltiness. The feel is light but a bit abrasive with a lot of carbonation. Sessionable based on its lightness on the stomach but I probably wont drink a ton of these."
""
""
""
"What we have here is a classic session beer with an incredibly high drinkability level. True to the style and one of the better crossover beers I've had in some time."

"Thin white bubbly head and pale gold color. Aroma is sweet, grainy and slightly vinous with grassy, piney, very ""American"" hoppiness. Flavor exhibits a lot of sweet American lager flavor without the cheap adjunct nastiness. Very clean. Finishes with a slight tinge of hoppiness. A very clean, sessionable beer for summer, or any time really. Think of it as a better tasting ""stubby bottle beer""."

"O: I think a pale lager is one of nature's simple treats, a beer you can enjoy while completely shutting your brain off...this one, though, is almost Southern Tier levels of cloying. With a bit more hoppiness (or a fresher bottle - hell, maybe both), this could have been genuinely good. BMC fans will enjoy this, at least."

"Nice, light-bodied and crisp with some volume to it that doesn't detract from its nature or add too much, the feel fits the style best. Crispness really is key, keeping up well and never waning, and continuing over a good smoothness even into a dry finish."
""
""
""
"It's a light golden colored beer topped with a big soapy head. A few strings and spots of lace cling around the glass. It has a strong grassy aroma, underlined with a cooked corn note and vague grainy sweetness. Smells like an adjunct lager with extra hops. The taste, which has the character of said style, does have a vibrant grassy flavor which buries some of those less appealing flavors. Helping it are crisp bubbles, albeit with a slick base. For the money, Session Lager may be one of the better buys out there."

"Session Red is sweet. You can smell and taste floral hops. It is not bitter. Session Red is a light enjoyable lager beer. The quality is good. It is all malt. This is a very nice easy drinking beer. It is good for when you want something light. I wish this was 12 ounces. I would pay $1 more for a twelve pack of 12 ounce bottles. There's something about the malt flavor of this beer that I don't like too much as it lingers on my palate that detracts from the overall quality of this beer."

" Smooth, balanced, great finish...this is what an american pale lager should taste like. You can drink it with anything, any time, any place."
""
""
"Nice clean session lager. Easy drinking and has flavor. Nice when cold. Like the stubby bottles. Light golden color and good carbonation. White head. Goes down smoothly with a malty aftertaste. Not bitter at all. Heads and tails above the macro light beers in my humble opinion."
""
""
""
""
"Overall : I take moosehead , Heineken, corona over this beer at least they give me 12 oz with more or similar taste. Real Germany beer like spatan , lowenbrua has twice as much taste as session beer . Full Sail Brewery does not have no excuse for the 11 oz bottle just for misleading public and profit. You will receive half less 12 oz beer from a six pack! Also , I will buy grenade bottle beer from Coors and mickey in future for more taste and more beer ! 12 OZ BEER American standard not 11 OZ!"

"Overall: I liked this beer just fine, but it tasted more like a Munich Helles mixed with a bit of watered down Berliner Weisse, rather than a Light American Lager. The absence of the head and the lower amount of carbonation made the uncharacteristic sweet and sour flavors stand out even more, and caused the beer to lack the refreshing quality this style is known for."
""
"Pours a pale straw with thin, white head. No lacing to speak of. If I didn't know better, I'd think it was a commercial light beer. A faint aroma of grass with some herbal notes. Not much hop presence on the nose. Little bitterness on the palate, mostly a floury malt with faint bread notes. Light bodied with good carbonation. Overall, a serviceable lager."

"O: I have traveled around North America and Europe(Ireland, Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Italy, etc) and have tasted the best beer. I've longed to have a ""true"" high quality beer brewed properly and unpasteurized here in the good old USA for many years. Sam Adams is good beer but not quite this good. This is the finest example of a high quality lager without concern for cost or any other factor except beer quality. I now have that beer. NO BUD."
"Will buy this again, and looking forward to trying the dark."
"O: At 5.1% abv, purists are going to have a cow when they see the word 'session' on the label. Still, sessionable is absolutely what this beer is. Certainly not a thinking man's beverage, but it is very drinkable and pleasing in its simplicity. A good tool to use when trying to bridge the gap between macro and craft. The old-timey stubby bottles are a great marketing ploy too."

"Poured from a brown 11 oz. bottle. Has a light golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of malts, some sweetness. Taste is crisp, malty, some light hops, refreshing and tasty. Feels light in the mouth and like it's name says, is a good session beer."
"O- this one was ok, a step above BMC, but very simple and not very pleasing to a craft palate."
""
""
"It's an outstanding beer. Probably the best basic lager I ever had."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, I have no idea how this brew got this high of a rating. This is proof the ratings must be taken skeptically b/c anybody in their right mind should know better. Even Warsteiner or St pauli (low end German) stomp this. I guess I didn't keep it brief, but this stuff has tainted my taste buds."
""
"Had I bought another bottle, that would have gone down right after this. I couldn't even detect the alcohol here and there wasn't any of it that could be detected in the taste. This would be a great beer for the Summer and there's enough body here to shake off the stereotype that a light Lager has to feel overcarbonated and ""skunked"". I'd certainly buy this again!"
""
""
""
"Poured from a pill bottle into a shaker, the beer is a bright, clear, pale-golden coloring with a filmy ring of white on the surface. Aromas of toasted grains and some subtle floral highlights. Flavors are bold and toasty initially, with a slightly bitter and toasted grain follow-up across the palate. Some buttery sweet highlights throughout. The body is effervescent and light, with the carbonation keeping a frothy feel in mouth. Toasted and slightly bitter aftertaste, with a clean, smooth finish. Very easy to drink, and a little smoother than most in this style, but tasty."
"For a summer beer, I really like it. A refreshing, no nonsense lager from a respectful craft brewery that is priced amazingly close to the Factory Beers."
" The flavor is very good with nice malt toastiness and slight yeasty flavor in the middle with a gentle spiciness in the hops without much alcohol in the taste. The beer is not complex but it fits the style well. Overall I say it is a good west coast lager which is not a common style being put out by craft brewers..I like it."
""
"Considering how great the lagers in the Limited series are, this is a bafflement. Even if it was 4.1% instead of 5.1, it would still taste anemic. It's hard to beat the industrial breweries at the game they invented. From the 12 oz stubby bought at Trader Joe's. ""Enjoy by"" date is 10/08/13."
""
"Appears fizzy yellow golden with a thick white head fine speckled lacing left behind. Aroma has a great light cereal grain kick with just a kiss of hops light malt sweetness rolls so crisply across the palate great summer beer I need a case! The flavor is light refreshing and everything I love about beer this is super fresh! Beautiful constructed light bodies no frills lager, so good when it's your lips it might have u streaking like Frank the Tank."
""
""
""
""
"Running the grill during your summer BBQ and want to keep it under control for the duration? This beer should be in the cooler for you."
""
""
""
""
"Golden lager color with not much head of which to speak. Aromas of sweet yeast and grain and a flavor is much the same: grain and bread. Has a very crisp body with some heft to it. I saw someone liken this to a German lager and they're exactly right."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I find most Euro lagers to be a little more crisp, dry, and with more hop bitterness. This one had a little more sweetness and a little less hop bitterness in comparison. For an American lager, I find this one to be one of the better I've had. I enjoyed it and I would buy this again as well as recommend it for someone looking to transition to craft beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall- This is a very easy drinking and refreshing brew, coupled with a more moderate alcohol level it is just what a session style brew should be (although the abv may be a little on the high side for a session, ah but…). Rather nice."
""
""
""
""

"O.. Overall .. I love this beer!! Its not overly complicated, and really hits it spot on!! Price is very affordable!! This is my new go to beer hands down!!"

"Full Sail Session Lager pours a clean and crisp golden color with a quickly diminishing white head. The nose consists of pale malt, grain, and hints of corn are met with just a touch of honey. Cracker and biscuit malt flavors are well met with a hint of honey and a touch of hops to provide a good balance. Moderately carbonated, this sessionable is both crisp and sharp for a lighter bodied brew."
"Not too much going on...but hella-refreshing."
""
""
""
"I like this beer. It tastes great and is less filling. Plus the cap said ""tools required"" how awesome is that."
""
""
""
"I went bananas with my pour and almost caused it to overflow the glass. Whoops! Two fingers of rocky, bone-white head with great retention were the result. Color was sunshine-yellow with NE-plus quality clarity. Nose was grassy, biscuit malty and just as I remembered it. Mouthfeel was medium and the grassiness of the hops reminded me of fresh-mown lawn. Come on, warm weather! It is three days into Spring 2013 and it is colder than some days this past Winter. Grrr. It is a good thing that I have beer. I anxiously await the opportunity to begin mowing my backyard again after laying grass seed last summer. I digress. Man, was this beer going down quickly! I really liked the way the malt got out of the way of the hops until the extreme finish and offset them just enough to be considered semi-dry. Dry should be reserved for American IPAs while lagers should exhibit at least a little sweetness. Welcome to PA, Hood River, OR! I hope that you plan to stick around."
"This Beer does for me what I wish the Macro Brews did. That is to offer a refreshing yet flavorful ""light"" Beer that doesn't reek of cereal Grains. Session also offers a nice mouthfeel for this type of beer. Subtle and nice beer. Really nice!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Good lager especially for the price (11.95 for a 12-pack of stubbies at HEB in Texas)"
"I haven't bought this beer in a while… but I might have to get some the next time I am at Total Wine. I am serious about taking this to the golf course! If you want a good replacement for a domestic (and yes, you DO), give this a try. Grab a single bottle of this and the Black Lager so you can compare these two stubbies. Ha. That sounds dirty!"
""
""
""
""
""
"Updated bottles now require tools. Out pours a golden yellow lager with white head and thin lacing. Slightly creamy body with mild malt sweetness and aroma of malt, hops, grain, caramel and light floral. Overall Session Lager is easy to drink, yet combined with low cost and accessibility in most places of the US makes it a real winner."
"O: Full Sail succeded in making a quality, flavorful, easy drinking lager."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - I could drink this all night. One of the best session beers I've ever had."
""
""
""
"Overall, this is a great backyard bbq beer, or the perfect beer to have after mowing the lawn. I usually have a tendency to not crave lager/pils during the winter. However, the February ""thaw"" is here and signs of warmer weather are approaching. Drinking this brew brought back memories of a warmer time when the leaves were green, the waves were crashing on the beach, the birds were chirping, and the smell of bbq's permeated the air. It brought back nostalgic feelings from a previous moment in time worth yearning for. Cheers!"

"overall, the black is better, but whatever. i gues this can pass for a decent 'sessionable' brew, if your expectations arent terribly high, but it definitely isnt my favorite 'straw' beer."
""
"Session Premium Lager has a medium, white head and a clear, bubbly, yellow-golden appearance, with minimal lacing left behind on the glass. The aroma is mild, but one gets sweet, bready malt and a touch of hops. One will notice a similar flavor, which even has a fruity aspect to it. Mouthfeel is mostly watery, and Session Premium Lager finishes crisp, refreshing, dry, and delicious. Overall, I really enjoyed it and think it's really good! RJT"
""
""
""
""
""
"Refreshing for a warm fall day, but I would like for this brew to be a bit more full flavor and less on the light side of things. Recommended for a hot day."
"Drinkability is ridiculously high. Why have I waited this long to try it?"
""
""
""
""
""
"A simple American lager taste that seems to have more too it than most of the more popular light American lagers."
""
""
"American pale lagers rarely excite me, and this beer was no exception. Although I inadvertently purchased my bottle after its expiration date had passed, I have a hard time believing it was much better when fresh."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I much prefer the dark version of Session, but this beer ain't bad. Light and clean with an unassuming taste. Nicely balanced yet nothing to make it stand-out. But, with regards to its intent and character, a nice little, easy drinking beer to while away an evening..."
""
""
""
""
""
"The beer pours a clear golden color with a white head. The aroma is full of grain with a little bit of grass from the hops. Smells like a pale lager should smell, only without the harsh notes you sometimes get in the non-craft versions. The flavor is very similar. I get some grain and sweet biscuit malt notes, as well as some grass. No bitterness. Thin mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
""
""

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall Impression: I have to say I was impressed by this beer from the first time I tried it about a year or two ago. While the taste is not revolutionary as far as beers go, it is easily one of the most drinkable lagers I have encountered. I would also say I am a fan of the stubby bottles as they make for a more transportable glass bottle brew."
"It falls down somewhat on taste, not being anything extraordinary. The same goes for the aftertaste. Overall, it's drinkable, but it is not something I would ever want to buy again."
"Excellent price. Can get these for $11.99 at a QFC in Seattle."
"This is a pretty easy drinking lager. A bit hearty with some grain tones on there that push it out of being a lighter beer. But it is still smooth with a good character."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall Impression- This is without a doubt one of the BEST lagers I've ever enjoyed! While it is refreshing and quite light, the flavor and well-balanced background makes this a sure shot to be one of the best of this style (hence why I gave it a 5/5). Get your hands on some if your in the area!"
"A simple, but enjoyable, well-brewed lager. I think they hit the target for what they wanted to achieve very nicely."
""
""
""
""
"O: Overall sweet flavor, grows on you afer awhile. A great intro beer for those macro buddies. Easy drinking pale lager with a small bit of hops your bmc friends should enjoy and not find offensive. Interesting, pretty good fullness of body with a good carbonation factor."
""
""
""
""
""
"Taste is has quite a strong cereal grain sweetness on the body....definitely the predominant taste right away, then it fades into a strong grain profile that mixes with a sweet creamy note as well. I guess the two words to sum up this beer would be sweet and grainy. that's not necessarily a bad thing, because this is supposed to be an easy drinking lager and that's exactly what it is. So by style, I have to give it high marks. This would be remarkably easy to drink on just about any day, especially hot ones."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O:  A great session beer that delivers great taste and low alcohol so you can pound them away. Really enjoyable in the summer and one of my favorite ""garage work"" beers. "
""
"Beware! These 11oz stubby bottles go down fast! This all-malt, pre-prohibition style lager will take you back to the roots of brewing in America. It's golden color and crystal clarity combine with a smooth, almost sweet taste that keeps this little beer enticing to the very last sip. The cozy 11oz bottles add a charming, nostalgic character that almost makes up for the missing 12th oz."
"Overall:Too much of the adjunct lager style for my liking but finishes better."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a simple session lager. Just enough hops and full sail yeast flavor to keep it interesting. Not bad with buffalo chicken pizza."
""
""
"Looks as clean as any other american lager but with a bright and whiter head that retains much better. Unique sweet unbaked bread dough on the nose, some graininess and a touch of hop on the back of the nostrils. Full mouth feel, graininess throughout with a touch of lingering sweetness. Hop bitterness enough to balance it. A unique creaminess as well. A bit earthy but a clean and well done lager. Its nice to have a craft 12 pack option other than varieties and this fits the bill quite nicely."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a light golden ale with a little white foam on the surface and brilliant clarity. The nose strikes me initially like a bohemian pilsner with earthy hops and sweet, corn like malts. Really a light and sweet nose here with just a hint of rose like florals. Flavor is of faint grain and cardboard; not much else for me. Medium bodied for style with standard hi carb and a semi dry finish. The beer is nice looking and smelling, but the flavor kills it's appeal for me greatly. Although I wouldn't turn it down over many others, it's not special."
""
"O- I like it and, given that it's often selling for $9.99 for a twelve pack around Austin, I'd recommend it. Even if it isn't that cheap near you, it's a quality lager that won't break the bank or offend your taste buds."
""
""
""
"I'd take a Session over a Budweiser, but they're not too far apart. If Bud didn't have that weird sweet smell/taste, it would come across similar to the Session. I used to think that American macro brewers just used crappy ingredients and processes but it may be that this style just sucks. The third option is that Session just sucks too."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Would I get it again? Probably, if not for anything else but for its unique red stripe-esque style."
""
"O: Drinks pretty good. Light, clean and easy. Not much to it, would go well with a meal. Cheers!"
"Overall, this is a true session beer. However, for the style I've had better. I don't think its worth the price of $16 for a twelve pack. Next time I will purchase Yuengling or Schlitz Gusto."
"Overall a brew that is very mild in the flavor department, which is typical of a lot of light Lagers. Would however be great for a nice hot lawn cutting day..."
""
"That being said, it is a feisty, full bodied beverage with a little grit to it and a nice finish. If this is a regional beer then everywhere outside the West Coast should be clamoring for it. This should fill the niche left by Rolling Rock once RR went corporate."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Plus, it has a fun, chubby bottle for this chubby drinker."
"Session Lager is light amber gold, with not much of a head but crisp carbonation nonetheless. Smells like cider and malt to me. This is as pure a taste as you could hope for in a lager. A slight tartness is rounded out by smooth malt flavor. Crisp. Delicious. Though this is straightforward stuff, I've never had anything quite like it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Sweet and sour malts, enough hops, and good body. Old school. Lives up to the name."
""
"This is as straightforward as it gets for a lager, in a good way. Pours a nice gold color with a finger and a half white head that fizzes away and leaves some lacing. Smell is of sweet malts, and light flowery hops. Taste follows the nose, comes in with sweet malts, some breadiness, and finishes slightly bitter thanks to the hops. Also a slight, slight hint of citrus. The big thing about this beer though is it's smoothness and drinkability. This thing goes down super easy, very refreshing. Overall, this is a great example of the pale lager style, and is replacing longboard lager as my go to lager as we speak."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Not all lagers are too thin, flavorless, and over-carbonated. This beer proves that. Not necessarily great as a beer, but very good for its style."
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a nice, balanced beer that is just as its name implies, a session beer. I would drink this on a regular basis if it were available in my area."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - My hopes were a little higher than they should have been based on their ""Pre-Prohibition Lager"" description on their web-site. Better than your average adjunct though."
""
"O/D-This is a solid twelve-pack especially when you want to bring some beers to a party that aren't too intense that most everyone will enjoy. High in drinkability. Simple and downright good."
""
"O: A very drinkable lager with more than the usual flavor of an American lager. A most pleasant beer that I would have again."
"O: Outstanding ""cooler filler"". This is a crowd pleaser. The beer nuts will drink it, the beer novices will drink it. Comes in a bottle that reminds me of my Dad and Uncle's drinking ""Rhinegold"" and ""Schmidts"" when I was a kid. But that's where the simiilarities end! Great price for 12 pack. It's in my fridge at all time.. BUT NOT FOR LONG!"
""
""
"Session being the opperative word, but at 5.1% many may disagree. I found this beer very enjoyable and with extremely high ease of consumption."

"O: I would love to have a 12 pack in my fridge at all times."

"Clear yellow-gold with a tall white head that quickly settles to a thin head. Clean aroma...pale malt sweetness and light floral, lemon, and grass notes. Mildly sweet pale malts, honey, and a subtle flowery hop bitterness. Pleasantly grainy. Light and somewhat effervescent, but not watery. Very refreshing. A good old school pale lager with no off-notes. Maybe a little pricey, but I'm still interested in trying the other two ""Session"" varieties."
"O: For the price, this beer is great. I would much rather have these on hand at a party than any macro. One of the best session beers out there"
"T: very nice, medium body, well balanced, the sweetness of the malt are delicious and the bitternees after taste is large and deep enough"
"Price point - $4.99 for a 6pk"
"It has been a long time coming for my review with this. One of my favorites. Just an excellent lager, and something I would highly recommend."
"Overall, it's a good lager to drink. the stubby bottles do help makes things easier packing for a trip. I know that some people would be put off by the price."
"O - refreshing; a very good session or summer beer. Very good alternative to the much more widely available American macro-lagers. I assume this (general public) is the target audience."
"Overall this is a nice average beer. There isnt anything great about it, but nothing bad either. It is a nice session beer for sure."
"Overall one solid sessionable lager indeed. I could have this anytime."
"O- Not my favorite beer in the world, but definitely a beer I could kick back with and drink a few"
"OVerall - a very easy drinker, thirst quencer beer. Session is the right name for it."
"$12.99 for a twelve pack in Atlanta, GA."
"O- Pretty average in respect to lagers, the only exception is the mild sour notes on the finish. Overall it is a light refreshing lager."
"Well-named, if but for the unmoved alcohol content, but that may just be a reflection of the American craft beer ethos - 'your beer's strength is our low-ABV strength, and ours still tastes better'."
"I often overlook this beer in favor of the Session Black, but after sitting down to actually review it, I rate this beer higher. It's a refreshing lager, with no faults, and just enough depth to keep you interested. And at $9.99 a 12 pack it feels like a steal. The perfect beer to please any group, craft lovers or macro fans."
"not a bad beer would like to try other beers from this brewery if i get the chance."
"Drinkability- Drinkable, but not something I would try again. Has a watery, lemony consistency I don't like"
"O: ""Session"" indeed. I paid a buck thirty-three for this little bottle and it was absolutely worth it. If I can find a sixer out here in Mass I'll definitely pick some up for the weekend. This beer screams backpacking, canoeing and farting around in the backyard. Great for a cheap beer, primarily for having the audacity to be exactly what it says on the bottle."
"Clear yellow in color with a nice sized white head that leaves a thin layer of froth behind. Grass and slight herbal notes on the nose. Same on the palate with a fair bit more malt than you would find on a typical macro lager. Carbonation is bright and very prevalent. This beer has a bit more flavor and richness than you would find from BMC. However, it still finishes clean and has a nice light flavor. This is what a lighter style American lager should taste like."
"I think this is the best beer I've had from Full Sail; you get what you pay for."
"Overall a good pale lager, I would defiantly pick it up again and a good alternative to the buds and millers of the world and it is a great beer to have in the fridge during the summer!"
"Overall: A very good tasting beer, But NOT cheap either. HARD to find here in Ohio.. But one of the best I have had in a while."
"A straight-forward lager. Very refreshing but that's about all that's going on here."
"I tried several tastings and did not desire to finish the sample"
"The aroma was light. Lots of light grain and bready malts abound here. Small light fruit notes and an overall light profile. Taste was more of the same, light grain, light fruits, small doses of grain. A crisp, clean, and refreshing profile. Very light feel with an almost non existently light feel"
"O - Awesome, if I could find it by the case I would. My favorite beer of the summer thus far."
"Cheers!"
"Overall- I have been wanting to step away from the IPAs for a minute (this is proving very difficult), and this is just what the doctor ordered. At just 5.1% abv and, more important, less than $10 per 12 pack this could be a staple in the fridge during the summer months. 4/5"
"So good for summer boozing."
"Translucent yellow, slight hue of orange. Large 2-3 finger head but that shrinks down to a thick ring around the glass. Nose is mainly grass, fresh milled pale grain and a miniscule amount of hop spice. The flavor has a quick carbonation/hop bite upfront and then grain and lemon hit you with a thicker body than expected. Finish is crisp and leaves an extreme tingle. Dry and a lot of hop grass. Dryness attacked my tongue and made me feel like I hadn't had a drink in hours. Good beer but finish didn't work for me."
"Welcome to the Brew Tube! I hope you enjoyed your first Session! O!Red says, Raise your Glass, I'd Tap That!"
"o - Overall an extremely average pale ale. Nothing offensive in the nose or taste, but nothing that made it stand out or that I really liked; just bland malts. Kind of reminds me of like a BMC product without the skunkiness or offensiveness. Wouldn't seek it out again."
"Pours a crystal clear light yellow with a 2 inch white head that fades to a thin film. Broken rings and random spots of lace form on the glass on the drink down. Smells of grains and a grassy aroma. Taste is of sweet grain, grass/herbs, and slight hop flavors. This beer has good carbonation with a crisp and clean mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very easy drinking lager that is refreshing and just right for drinking multiples. The overall score is better than the other scores because of this."
"Hello carbonation. Pours a straw yellow with a huge white head that sounded like rice crispies due to the carbonation. This settled out after a minute, but the carbonation continued. The smell is subtle, grainy with hints of malt. The flavor follows, a mostly grainy lager, with a subtly sweet finish and notable hop. The mouthfeel is light, refreshing and crisp, what I expected from a lager. Overall a good beer, very drinkable, the flavor is somewhat different but doesn't pack a huge punch. I would drink this beer again, especially on a hot summer night."
"Drinkability is awesome. This is a session lager and it fits the style perfectly. The best session beer I have ever had and ever heard of anyone else saying they have had. Such a great beer and high ABV for the way it goes down. Bring this to a party and you will be a hero!"
"A tasty session lager that should work for the most part. I was expecting less of a sweet taste and a bit more bitterness. Still worth a try!"
"to offer to others at your house."
"Light, crisp, refreshing. This goes down too smooth. Overall an awesome beer to guzzle in the summer."
"PP (Price Point) - $12 for a 12 pack, seems about par to me, higher than average ABV for the style of beer that it is."
"It's drinks well and fits the bill for style, but I was hoping for more."
"I'm digging the stubby bottle this came in. The beer is crystal clear and yellow/gold in colour. A short white cap didn't last long, but left some transient spotty lacing on the glass. Floral hop aroma with a bit of pale malt and slight spiciness. There were no surprises in the flavour, based on the aroma -- a bit of malt, floral and spicy hops, plus mild to moderate bitterness. The texture was alright. It had a little more body than expected and the carbonation was on the light side. This kept it from being as crisp and refreshing as it could have been. Overall, a decent beer but it didn't wow me enough to seek it out again."
"Poured from bottle into pint glass. Did not retain a head at all. Pale color. Not a very good looking beer. Not much aroma coming from the glass. Does have a wheat, or earthy smell. Taste is typical pale lager with some sweetness and wheat taste. Not bad and is probably the best part about this beer. Definitely lives up to the name, but honestly not my style."
"Decently tasty and drinkable for the style. Sessionable indeed, but pretty uninteresting."
"A good beer, and a definite session beer, but the flavor was average at best and did not live up to the hype of this beer unless you're looking for a just above average lager."
"Wish the bottles were 12 ounces instead of 11. Have a nagging feeling that I'm getting shorted somehow, even though I knew about the size before I made the purchase."
"Eh. It's drinkable, and it's a pretty good example, in fact, of how you can do a light, uncomplicated pale lager well. But the style is still pretty unexciting overall, as though it begs for low scores in reviews."
"Overall: dont be fooled by the stubby bottle, give this one a try especially for the price. Can be found for close to a buck-a-beer and beats many beers for the same price hands down."
"D: A very pleasant, supremely easy drinker from Full Sail. This definitely lives up to its ""Session"" billing. Not the most exciting style to some, but this is definitely enjoyable. A worthy beer with wide appeal."
"Overall I'm surprised and impressed, nice hops blended with decent malts, clean and crisp, no off or skunk cheap extract flavors."
"Overall Drinkability - Way batter than Red Stripe. I'm digging it."
"Overall this is a good sessionable lager beer with actual some weight and taste to it. I had not tried this beer despite seeing it around for years. Recommended for tailgates or parties!"
"Drinkability: To me this is in the lower half of this style. It walks a line between pilsner and American adjunct beer. Certainly not the worst I have had in the style, but nowhere near some others. I might drink this more if the abv were a bit lower, but for me this is a one and done."
"It ended up being more flavorful and smoother than I expected. It's easy drinking and a relatively low ABV (5.1%). I would strongly consider purchasing this one again."
"Overall this is a pretty good lager. Normally I don't really care for most lagers but this really quite good. It has a nice flavor with a great light mouthfeel which as you would expect based on the name makes it a great session beer. While this is not something I would normally drink, it is a great example of its style, quite enjoyable to drink and a great beer for just hanging out and drinking with friends."
"O: I've heard this beer talked about for so long and finally picked up some up. It's pretty good for what it is, and I suppose if I was in the mood to pound down some light-ish lagers, this might not be a bad choice."
" All serious beer drinkers should do themselves a favor if they are planing on getting into a beer drinking session and put the PBR away and pour a session. This is a fun pleasing beer that doesn't make you want to quit drinking but rather beckons the beer drinker to finish it and uncap another one. Session lager is dangerously good and definitely revives my opinion of the Full Sail Brewery."
"D - An admirable lager that makes for good drinking on a warm spring evening... A huge step up from macro crowd, but nothing to specifically search out either... Easy drinking and one could go through a couple without blinking..."
"Well for starters on the looks, it is crystal clear, I mean it's completely see through, I know it's a lager, but this is kinda of ridiculous. This might be the most see through beer I have ever seen. It pours a one and a half finger head that is a hanging around for a bit, which is surprising, giving the appearance of it. Also in the appearance - so much carbonation, wow, OMG! There are so many f-ing bubbles coming up from this thing. I hate to say it, but other than the head, this thing doesn't look too good. The smell is a little better, I don't pick up any corn or anything really offensive like that, it smells like a lager. I mean there really isn't much aroma though, you get a small malty smell, maybe a hint of hops somewhere in there, but not much. It just kinda smells like a generic lager, without the corn and other crap. Ok, well for the taste, it's not too bad. It for sure tastes like a lager, and there really isn't too much going on in the way of taste, but there really isn't anything offensive about it, it's very smooth and easy drinking. I'm torn with the taste really, because it is tasty, and there isn't anything wrong with it, it's just really really not exotic as far as the taste goes. I want to give this a 4 on taste, but I can't bring myself to do that, so 3.5. Mouthfeel is normal for a lager and the drinkability is pretty high, but that is no surprise. I guess overall it's an easy drinking lager, and it is tasty, with nothing wrong with it, but if there was a beer to define the term ""nothing special about it"" this would be the one."
"The finish is really nice and clean without any bitterness or bite. Yes, this is a true session beer...I'm not just talking about the low ABV since there are many low ABV beers that I would drink in a session...this one I could and would drink all night."
"D: This is reminiscent of cheap malt liquor that tastes like it has a much stronger ABV. I couldn't finish it. I have no idea where these high ratings are coming from. Maybe it's the cool bottle."
" Bravo"
"Drink up!"
"This beer pours a pretty standard gold color with a thin white head, lots of visible carbonation. Head quickly dissipates without lacing. Smell is of sweet malt, a touch if alcohol and I get sort of a grainy smell, but don't trust me on that. Taste starts with s slight hoppiness but the focus is on sweet light malts. Mouthfeel is medium with generous carbonation. Overall, very drinkable and sessionable. Compared to a lot of other craft beer it doesn't really impress me. But that is not the target for this beer, which would be the BMC drinker. For that role it is a perfect bridge to the wide world of craft beer. For it's category, it deserved a very good grade."
"It has high reviews, but it just doesnt work for me. The weird sweet aftertaste is just not good."
"Picked this up in NYC as I dont think its distributed to MA at this pont. Nice gold color and saaz/some other german/czech type hops smell and taste. It seems extremely fresh--excellent example of a style that is not produced as often as it should be. I wish I had bought more of these."
"Overall-As the name states, this is a great session beer, nice flavors, a little more complex and powerful than most beers of the same style. A very nice beer."
"I'll stay in this session most of the time."
"Coming out the weird shaped bottle, session lager is a bright golden color resembling a pale lager. A fading white head before it even forms, no stickage on the sides. Smell is pale malt, a nice amount of hops on a nearly expired bottle. Taste is smooth simple. Pale malt, light hops, no bitterness, slight fruit in the middle with a easy ending. Feel is light, carb is bright, smoother than a bud or the like though. I enjoyed this one and hope to find it fresher next time."
"Overall this beer was a really nice surprise. I like Full Sail but wasn't expecting much going in. It was fuller bodied, complex, flavorful and very easy to drink. Nothing mind blowing but a really solid sessionable beer."
"This is a decent lager, especially for the price. Mouthfeel is effervescent and it's very drinkable. I could go through bottles of this."
"D: This beer is very easy to drink and goes down quickly."
"Overall a great picnick or backyard BBQ beer without having to worry about the drive home."
"The mouthfeel is spot-on, it's substantial enough where it doesn't feel watered down, and not the slightest bit more. The drinkability, of course, is exceptional. If you're calling your brew ""session"" it had better be! A very drinkable brew from Full Sail ... I probably like this one just a bit better than Yuengling for the ""drinkable staple beer"" category."
"Clear straw gold. Smallish head a touches of lace. Smell is malty, sweet with a floral hops. Taste is really quite nice. Light sweet malt with a healthy breadiness. Clean dry hops with a touch of cracker and biscuits in the finish. An herbal touch with good solid bitternes gives excellent balance. Feel is light and crisp. Quenching and refreshing. Very good drinkability and at 11 bucks for 12 of these this is a great find."
"D - Incredibly high."
" This lager fits the bill."
"Extremely drinkable. More flavor and body than most lagers out there. This one is great in the warm weather. If I'm ever in a mood for a lager, this is one of the few i'll go for."
"After a nice cocktail at Drink on Congress St, we still had enough time before our dinner reservations at Sportello for one more quick drink. I decided to grab a beer. Got a bottle and a small juice glass to accompany it. Nice white fizzy head appears with a strong pour. Dark copper colored body with a lot of carbonation. Smell has a bit of grass and hay to it. Taste was very flavorful for a domestic pale lager. A nice balance of hops and malt. Mouthfeel was wonderfully crisp and cleansing. An extremely easy beer to drink, and with flavor to boot. Nice to see FSBC beers finally on the Boston market. I will remember this one next time I am looking for a session beer, pun very intended."
"I don't get some of the negative reviews on this brew. Why does everything need to be a barrel aged hop fueled monster of a brew? Why doesn't anyone make a ""normal"" beer anymore? Glad to see full sail not give a shit about the popular status quo amongst American craft beer. awesome job."
"overall, good for the style, but way too light and fizzy, too reminiscent of a macro. i wont buy again."
"Taste, very carbonated, easy drinking, faint hop presence bolstered by heavy carbonation. Don't really see what separates this from the macros. At least the pricing is nice, this is a good 12 pack to have when you can't get Weinhards for those stuck in purgatory between the good, the bad and the ugly."
"D: Good."
"GRADE: B/B+"
"I was a little surprised at this little lager that could. It was lacking in appearance with minimal head that receded quicker than a coca-cola's. The smell brought sweet malts and yeast to the picture which were pleasant tasting in this tasty but quite gassy beer. Hhis beer is simple but nice."
"Not very good."
"Beer is thin and tastes like boiled corn. Gross. The finish is fine at least there isn't an aftertaste. I drank the whole bottle but that was because I was watching X-files on netflix, if I wasn't so preoccupied I would have poured it out and moved on for the night. I won't be having this again."
"11oz bottle poured into a pint glass. Best by date is 2/13/11. Pours a clear, golden yellow with two fingers of frothy foam that quickly dissipates. Very little carbonation and lacing. Nose is slightly more complex and pleasing that the macro lagers but still about the same profile. Sweet and yeasty malted barley with dull bitter hop undertones. Light bodied and flat. Not a lot of flavor but super easy to drink. Mildly sweet with roasted malt and just a touch of hop bitterness to make it very clean on the palate. Roasted malt comes through in the finish. This beer tries to be true to style but I feel like they could have made this a lot better. Still, if you want an authentic American lager to session that is still tasty and inexpensive without supporting the giants, well here you go. I'll be keeping this is the car to await me after a long day of snowboarding ^_^"
"11 oz. stubby with clearly marked inkjet freshness date. Pours a crystal-clear bright golden, with holy-shit levels of turbulent carbonation that makes the head climb out of the glass. It maintains a tight, bone-white head throughout and leaves decent lacing as I go. Pale malts, nutty lager yeast and a touch of fruitiness in the nose. Similar on the palate, with apple and grape esters, mild bitterness, perhaps some finishing hops and a curiously increasing sweetness that tastes almost corny and leads to a quick finish. Mildly dextrinous body leans toward medium, but is lightened by the tingly carbonation. This is a tasty all-malt lager that is very easy to drink, although a bit of adjuncts would serve this brew well in order to lighten its body and increase its drinkability. A solid brew nonetheless, and it makes me wish there were more tasty craft-brewed light lagers like this one out there."
"Slighty above American Macro Lager. Proceed at your own risk."
"These go down very easily. This is a top notch lager, especially for the dollar."
"this is a good beer. it isn't looking to expand horizons or make new ground. does every beer have to do that? If this were at the party I would not turn it down. I may prefer other beers (stronger/stranger) but that preference does not render this beer as crap."
"Drinkability: light and mildly refreshing, this beer is very easy to drink if you are interested in the style. Not a bad beer."
"D - easy to drink."
"drinkability decent. i got a free stubby from a friend thinking it was the schwarzbier. i wouldn't make the purchase, though."
"The best thing about it was I was able to enjoy it the way the name intends it to be enjoyed, drinking many of them and not getting too trashed. It's rare that I feel full from beer before I feel drunk but in this case it was a good thing."
"Very drinkable, as a session beer should be."
"Mouthfeel is smooth, almost too smooth and silky. Very drinkable and in fact pretty chuggable. A nice alternative to the big brews."
"D: This is an amazing find, being both refreshing and flavorful. There is an alarming number of BAs out there who would dismiss this brew as flavorless and dull. These, my friends, are BAs who have not discovered the great brews of Germany. They are those who have not a clue as to the value of delicacy and balance in a beer. Sessions Lager is delicate, it is flavorful, and it is balanced, and that is why you should drink Sessions Lager."
"Grade - One thumb up. It's not a great beer, but it's certainly not bad. After seeing the beer and smelling it I feared the worst. It bounced back with a decent taste which after all, is the most important thing. I was pleasantly surprised. I'd have Session Lager again."
"Just a good, simple session brew. I'm not concerned about head retention, lacing or appearance because I drink this one right out of the cool stubby bottle. Aroma and flavor is mild and refreshing with slight grainy sweetness and noble type hop character. This lager finishes crisp and clean with a nice carbonation bite. Session is a great beer for drinking in large quantities while camping or fishing. My favorite session brew."
"Session Lager is transparent and yellow in color. The head is pretty insignificant and fades to nothing after a few moments, leaving only a touch of lacing on the glass. The aroma is subtle, with herbal notes, grass, and a mild hop character. The taste follows suit, with a refreshing and smooth feel. Alcohol presence is very muted, making this a good session lager indeed. Very drinkable."
"Session is a good name for this beer because it is light and easy to throw back, even if the ABV is over five percent. Good for the style, and honestly better than I expected."
"Conclusion: This is a good beer, and drinks better in comparison to most adjunct lagers. It is not outstanding however, and doesn't shine beyond the level of something like Miller High Life enough to justify the price (in my opinion). Good work on the part of Full Sale though."
"Best I can say is, its light and easy drinking...not a lot going on here. Just a thin layer of malt, just barely a hint of hops to dry the finish. Hot summer day, ice cold..you get the idea. Not worth driving cross town for."
"Pours a moderate golden color with a bit of visible carbonation and a nice white head. The head dies down fairly quickly without leaving too much lace behind. The nose brings some slight grain. Nice and pleasant, but certainly simple. The taste is along the same lines. Good body and carbonation. Drinks well and is definitely a session beer."
"Awesome bottle! Pils clear gold, loose white head. Fades pretty fast to just about nothing. Smells like a session lager, not much hops, grainy cereal smell. Tastes like a nice light bodied beer, cereal, light malt, not much if any hop presence. I was really hoping for just a bit more bite. With kind of low carb and probably a pretty basic grain bill mouthfeel is just ok. I could however drink thirty of these bad boys, tasty for a session and damn I love that bottle."
"D) A decent brew. Easy drinking. I'd have another."
"Session has a strong carbonation that balances well with the clean flavors. The hops aren't overpowering in their bitterness and works well with the grains. Easy drinking and quite satisfying well worth checking out."
"D highly drinkable."
"Fairly flavorful lager, actually wish I'd had another bottle of this at the time to drink a 2nd helping! ""I think I'll go buy more tomorrow!"" was my last thought at the time... Very nice and easy going drinkable beer. The only one I currently have extra stocks of in my fridge. Cheap, tasty, and refreshing."
"If I were watching my waistline, and my wallet, but wanted something that was easy to drink, but still satisfying, this would be it."
"D - I could drink this all day long. It's a session lager, so it's doing its job well. Personally, I would tend toward with their Session Black Lager because of it drinkability combined with a little more flavor."
"Overall: Good amount of flavor plus easy drinkability makes this a pretty good choice. Enough taste to keep it interesting (keeping the style in mind of course) but with an overall smooth finish. Seek it out if you can find it fresh."
"D-Very easy drinking with good taste. Extremely sessionable. Hence the name. Hence why I had several in rapid succession before game time. Beats BMC hands down. This is what adjunct lagers wish they could be, but can't because they add things not meant to be in beer. Don't especially like the 11 oz. bottles, although they fit in the hand nicely."
"D: Very drinkable, low ABV and balanced flavors.... not a bad little session beer... another good beer from Full Sail."
"I love the stubby bottle. I love the fact that folks are brewing a quality lager such as this."
"Drinkability: This would be super easy to drink all day."
"D- Pretty decent. Light and easy drinking, with just enough interesting flavors to keep me sipping all night."
"Pours a clear gold with a nice, big white head. Aromas are largely subdued and uninteresting, tending towards the nebulously grainy and light honey sweetness. Taste is similarly uninteresting, but it's well-balanced and frankly, well, ""sessionable," which is just what it aimed to be."
"Into a pint glass, it poured a very light, highly carbonated gold color, with a finger of white head, which collapsed rather quickly, and laced spottily. Very neutral smell..grainy, hay, and maybe some biscuit; not much in the way of herbal/hop balance. The taste confirmed the nose; very grainy and hay-like. VERY carbonated and extremely thin; it's like a microbrewer's take on a mainstream 'light' beer. Certainly sessionable for some, given the thin and highly-carbonated nature, but not for me..unfortunately."
"D- The drinkablity on this session is on the outrageous side perfect if you can find a whole lot of these badboys to take out for a night."
"Drinkability - A great beer for an American style lager."
"Taste is very neutral, but predominantly grainy. This is where the beer falls short, a hint more hops and malt (both) would do wonders here, there's a slight grainy (to me bad) taste here that wipes out the other good characteristics--cleanliness, carbonation, it just lacks the subtle bent (whether floral like a Czech hops or more spicy like a German) that makes a good pilsner. Instead, this beer tastes to me like a high quality technical lager that's trying not to stray too far from the Bud recipe. And that's no compliment. Ah, Full Sail . . . so close!"
"Drinkability - This is a great alternative to macro beers. At just over a dollar a pop, this is not a bad beer at ALL for what it is. That is what I look at for this beer. It isn't trying to be anything it isn't. It is a just a American Pale Lager which is quite easy to quaff and doesn't taste half bad. I will go back to my beer store and pick a few more up of these to have in my refrigerator to drink when I'm BBQing."
"Mouthfeel is light and has a crisp amount of carbonation."
"This beer really grew on me as I drank it over the course of a couple weeks. Slight toasty/caramel flavor, full-bodied for a lager, with great mouthfeel. Definitely better than any of the American adjunct lagers I'm used to."
"Drinkability is pretty high. A very tasty beer, nice flavor, great mouthfeel, dry body gives it a refreshing quality that increases the quaffability noticeably. Yes, this is an APL, but this feels... well, crafted. It feels like someone really took their time in getting this one right, which is something every craft beer should feel like. Nice beer."
"This is hands down the best lager made in the U.S. Golden in color and has a nice head, smells delicious and the taste s unmatched compared to other lagers. Great design on the bottles and easily one of the most economic beer out there. Thumbs up to Full Sail Brewing out in Oregon, great prices and great beer."
"Poured a light yellow straw with good clarity. Huge 3 finger head on this one. Smells of grain/corn. Nice subtle malt with a very slight hint of bitter hops. This beer is not bursting with flavor by any means, but it is a very crisp and refreshing beer. The only bummer is that it comes in an 11oz bottle."
"Poured a yellowy gold color into my DFH Signature Glass. There was about a finger of thin white head that dissipated rapidly to leave no noticeable lacing. The aroma is mainly a slightly sweet malt character with a hint of grassy hops present. The taste is much better than the appearance and aroma. There isn't too much going on, but there is a nice drinkability to the beer. The malt character is not to prominent and there is only a slightly hoppy taste, but the mouthfeel and overall drinkability make me appreciate this beer. Overall this is the kind of beer I want after mowing the yard or while I am sitting in a ballpark. It is not the greatest beer in the world, but for being an easy drinking lager it hits the spot."
"The taste has a little sweetness to it with the signature malt swallow of a lager. No off tates and a little more flavor than macro lagers. I would rather drink this than Bud at a baseball game in the summertime. Its ok but not exceptional."
"Good beer for people that like golden lagers."
"D: very very easy, hence the name session, is going great with the cold fried chicken that is before me."
"D: Although I don't normally drink a many lagers, I gave this one a try. It is drinkable. Worth a shot."
"light-to-medium body, and the finish gets a tiny bit sour or stale if the beer is not super fresh. This beer captured my love with the bottle and easy drinking, but after a short while I realized that I didn't like it all that much, and the 11 oz. bottles mean that for every twelve pack there is one beer missing. Clever. The opposite of the baker's dozen."
"I poured this beer into my tumbler at 45 degrees. The beer poured a giant head. The beer was a pretty blond color. The smell was yeasty and fresh smelling. There was nothing really outstanding about this beer, yet it was very very good, I guess because it must have been very fresh. Anyway I will buy it again."
"D - This Lager is extremely drinkable & refreshing, like a lager should be. I could easily drink a 6pack or more of this beer, worth putting some effort in finding this one. I loved it and would definitely buy another. Cheers!"
"D - The short stubby screw top bottles are a bit difficult to work with, but logistics aside, I'd not mind running into this again."
"Pours a luminous pale gold with enormous white head. Appearance is great. Nose is faint with some cereal grain and very, very faint citrus. Palate offers a light malty-cereal sweet flavor with a bit of balancing hops. Finish has a light hop herbal quality. Easy drinking."
"A beer I first had on recommendation as a replacement for the crappy beers my guests tend to bring themselves when they visit on party days. I think it is good, though the style is not my first choice almost ever. Beats most of the mass-produced lagers I have tried."
"With a nice light mouthfeel these are very drinkable. Definitely try one if your want a well balanced and flavorful American style lager."
"Value: I saw this for $15.99 a 12 pack at WFM. At that price, it's hard to beat in terms of a ""drinking"" beer."
"This is an easy drinking lager, nothing more nothing less. It has no flavors or feel that would offend anyone, and is pretty damn smooth. But since it isn't intended to be double imperial, bourbon barrel-aged and all that, it doesn't matter that this is a simple, enjoyable beer for just about any session."
"I was expecting a little more from a pretty reputable micro grandfather, but besides the cool bottle and fun Lucky Lager like caps, this is just a generic tasting overly malted american lager. Now besides all that, I would pick this up over any american macro and feel glad to do so. If anything stands out about this, the finish has some appealing malty, bisquity notes that put it above the rest. Very drinkable, isn't that why it's in such a snappy bottle."
"bought a single it poured a clear golden yellow with allright lacing and head..it smelled of malts first and some biscuit some hops..the taste was thin it was predominately malts followed by a thin toast and grass with faint hops..this is a thin lager and a lawnmower brew at best..low abv makes it easy to drink"
"On tap at the Full Sail brewery in Hood River, OR. The colour was light straw with little head. The aroma was some light malt and faint hops. On the palate, it was reasonably crisp with some light hops and cereal grain character. I haven't tried many macro lagers, but I suspect this may be a bit better than most."
"D: True to it's name, this beer is very drinkable."
"This wasn't too bad as far as a lighter Lager goes. After some initial disappointment, this actually rebounded nicely in the taste and feel and I had no problem at all finishing the bottle. I could definitely see how this one might grow on you after a few."
"If ever there was a beer where the name says it all this would be it. It's not meant to be a hop bomb. It's not meant to rival Westvleteren for the world championship o' beers. It's supposed to be a fall back beer, a beer that you can drink plenty of, and often. I think it succeeds at this admirably."
"Unwholey drinkable; and given its name 'Session', no wonder. As that's exactly what you'll find yourself doing with much ease with this stuff."
"Drinkability: ah, the strength of the pale lager genre. Session has been the unofficial-official beer of my band's practice sessions for years now, and it's easy to see why. Such an aptly named brew!"
"This was an overall average beer. Taste was run of the mill light lager with some extra hoppiness for good measure. Smell is clean and malty with some faint grassy notes. Taste is very smooth with a tickle of bitterness on the tongue. Mouthfeel is fine, not too thick and not too thin. Drinkability is fine."
"Summary: All-and-all a relatively impressive showing from Full Sail. This is primarily due to my unreasonably low opinion of lagers and pilsners. I can hardly tell lagers apart at any given moment but this one stands out above the rest. It won't make my top 5 for sure but I would both recommend Full Sail's Session Premium Lager and drink it. Cheers!"
"Also this beer has some pretty promising applications as a drinking game centerpiece, Full Sail has cunningly put either a rock, a paper, or a scissors picture under every cap.... my dad and I got into a contest to see who would win... one case later we still don't know who did... we think Full Sail did"
"O- Good bang for the buck. Its quite nice on a hot summer day when you want a few beers. I'd buy again."
"Overall, this is nothing that I would ever want to session. I would rather get a cheap macro lager as they all taste similar. Nothing I am really enjoying."
"- Very drinkable ice cold.. flavor starts to drop a few points as it warms... overall very decent... I have more been long awaiting the Black Session."
"Drinkable as hell."
"Hardly any body body to speak of. Drinkable in the same way water is. I hadn't had a stubby of Session for several years as I wasn't a fan. But with the release of Session Black Lager, which I liked, I thought I would revisit this beer. I wasn't missing anything."
"D: This is certainly a well named beer. It goes down quick. I could see myself drinking several of these in a sitting. The retro bottles scream old-school cool. The beer itself is pretty decent too."
"I have to be honest - this one was not one that I'll be tasting again. It's a bit too sweet for the style and not that drinkable. Maybe a bad bottle, or maybe just not me cup of tea (or beer)."
"4 this is what i remember cheap lagers tasting like back in college. only problem is if i buy those beers now they taste and feel like 1/2 poison, 1/2 crappy beer. so now i have to pay 15.99 for twelve 11 oz. bottles. neutral and plain, this one, but inoffensive and good for when you want a simple drinker rather than a thinker. given that it's not all that easy to find a decent beer to fit that bill these days there's a good chance i'll be returning to full sail session."
"Session is in the name and it definitely does not dissapoint. A nice easy drinking beer with good attributes for an often lackluster style."
"Tastes great,grainy, some grassy hops hidden way back there. This beer is a perfet example of what budweiser mgd etc try so hard to be: jsut a good easy drinking beer. I love it. If it weren't for the price difference it would replace high life as my go to sixer in the fridge, drink after mowing the grass beer."
"Drinkability - Mouthfeel was really good but that taste kept getting in my way. What's with the 11 oz bottle?"
"D - this beer is made to be drunk in session, hence the name. This beer is drinkable for all audiences. I see almost no flaw in this aspect of the beer."
"Overall it's a great, basic lager. It's also nice for macro, or non-beer drinkers. Not offensive at all, just balanced and smooth."
"Golden in color, not a very distinctive color. Overall taste is pretty spot on kinda Pours a clear golden color with a small head that fully dissipated. Lots of carbonation bubbles continue to rise. Taste is a kinda floural hoppy. Me Likey. Not too bad I could see eating this with a fried fish or a lighter meal. Pretty good, will definately be buying this one again."
"Drinkability is high. There's a reason it's called session lager, and it's sold by the 12 pack!"
"This comes out of he bottle a clear golden amber with a little bit of a white head. Aroma is strong and rather yeasty, and has a decided fruity undertone. Satisfying flavor is malty and yeasty, and subtly fruity, mainly apple. Texture is smooth and tingly, about average but pleasing."
"Poured from the bottle. A clear yellow pour with a faint white head that dies off rather quickly, though rings the glass for a decent duration. Taste and aroma are essentially the same with notes of grain, grass, bread and some hops. Rather thin on the mouth and light on everything. Very easy to drink."
"Clear gold color with a respectable white head. Average retention and lacing. Aromas of sweetish malts with grains and a little bit of grass. Nothing particularly enticing. Flavor is about the same. Cereal grains and light grassy hops, a touch of citric zest. No adjunct character that I can detect. Unfortunately, there's not much character of any type to detect. An obvious step up from macro swill but if I'm in dire need of an easy drinking lager I'd much rather have an authentic Munich helles anyway. Carbonation is a little too high, body is thin and refreshing."
"Drinkability - I really liked this beer. It totally surprised me because I thought I was just buying a cheap brew and it was great."
"D - You could put these back all day."
"The taste isn't great, but far from awful and actually grows on me after half a glass. A crisp, biscuity maltiness up front lays down some grainy, husky notes, while a kiss of floral hops and a nice sweetness linger on the back of the palate. Overall, the body is clean and refreshing, with no major off-flavors. Body is light, bubbly, refreshing, and everything a pale lager should be. All in all, a solid session brew from a solid brewery. I'd probably have this again in a pinch."
"Overall this beer lives up to it's name. I'd like to see it more widely available. I've only seen it in big beer stores. This would be a great six pack to pick up at the grocery store or quickie mart."
"Other comments: This is one of those products that does exactly what it says on the label. It's a beer that is easy to drink and great for kicking back with some friends. Tastes pretty good straight out of the bottle, but it's got a nice bouquet, so I do prefer putting it in a glass even though that goes against the whole concept. Love the packaging, especially the bottles caps!"
"D - This is a very easy to drink beer with a pretty good taste for what it is as the name say its very sessionable not a bad choice if your going to be drinking beer for a while"
"11 oz stubby. Neat bottle. I had a few in a glass and actually preferred in the bottle. Fizzy yellow with a good sized head. Tastes like your regular lager. Super sweet, not very bitter. Very crisp and a little dry but with oiliness in the end (if that makes sense). Drinkability is going to be high. You could drink these all day long."
"A definite summertime must."
"Pours an extremely pale orange clear body. Very small white head, gone before I knew it. Extremely malty aroma. Some bitterness, almost piney, but not hoppy. Creamy mouthfeel, watery, toasted nutty aftertaste & a little dry. Very drinkable. Tasty."
"D - Light and easy to drink, this is not as flavorless as most American macros, but falls more in the category of a Euro Lager. Not bad for what it is, but it doesn't really shine as an surprisingly good example of its style; there are better light lagers out there."
"beautiful pour, straw body with an bone-white fuzzy cap. the head quickly dissipates, but fairly fierce bubbles suggest refreshment. big, malty nose, no sign of hops. sour citrus pulls the tongue, scraping the palate clean, revealing the next round of flavors; subtly sweet, overtly malty, and not bitter in the least. the mouthfeel is thin, effervescent, and bright. Drinkability; extremely high."
"D - off the charts! This is a great, simple lager, and I could totally drink more than one very easily in a session (coincidence!???). Definitely a highlight of the style, and I imagine it would be rated higher if so many BA's weren't so adverse to anything with the word ""lager"" near it. Would definitely buy again. Good work, Full Sail"
"D- aptly named ""session lager"". nothing exciting but it's a clean simple beer with no faults if your looking for something light. would be easy to put a lot of these down especially during warmer periods like spring and summer."
"A VERY cool addition to this beer, is that under the cap is either a 'Rock', 'Paper' or 'Scissors' hand symbol and word drawn there. So that invites you to buy a few boxes of this beer and drink amongst friends. A nice touch!"
"Out of a stubby brown bottle this beer was a classic gold color when I poured it into a pint glass. The head was off-white and both retained well and left solid lacing. The aroma was rather average, slightly musty malt but not unpleasant. The flavors started mildly sweet on a malty note and then became more grainy before the finish ended with a subtle balancing bitterness. Though it was simple it was clean and above average and highly quaffable. The mouthfeel was average, the carbonation low/medium and the body medium. Definitely a session beer, even if not much more."
"Unfortunately I got the second to last 12-pack at Surdyk's so unless they restock I'll have to find it elsewhere."
"Pours a light golden yellow color with a small white fizzy head, fair lacing. Aroma is a light citrus hop note, grainy, bread, and light malts, pretty unassuming. Taste is fairly plain, but good. Bitter at first, malty caramel and bread flavor. Fairly active mouthfeel, a bit watery but, very easy to drink. Sticks around for a while. I like this beer even though there really isn't anything special about it."
"D - One decent lagers that truly lives up to its name, perfect for a party beer if you can find those inexpensive 24-packs around Oregon."
"Very drinkable."
"Overall: I was very surprised it had a clean easy drinking well made lager. It is one of the better ones that I have tried. It was nice and refreshing."
"This beer pours a clear golden color. The head is small and disappears within seconds. The aroma is grainy with a hint of fruitiness. The taste is the aroma, and a long, lingering grainy finish. The mouthfeel is medium-light bodied with nice lively carbonation. Overall, this is a decent beer that I could drink again."
"D- Pretty good drinkability. Would qualify as a competent lawnmower beer @ 5.1%"
"D - This is a really good lager. The stubby 11oz bottle also adds a unique style to this brew."
"Stubby brown bottle, pours a clear light gold, dense white head fades to a half inch, sticky lacing. Smell: sweet malt, grassy and floral hops. Taste: grain backbone, decent grassy and floral hop presence. Hints of white grape juice. Light to medium bodied with a drying, tangy finish. This is quite good. Only see it in singles, would be nice to pick up a quantity of this."
"-ajh"
"D- Drinks like pure clean beer. No bells; no whistles; just beer."
"Drinkability: A very competent lil' lager. Nice bottle, too."
"Depending on the temperature of both the beer and the glass, it'll pour anywhere from about a one to three inch head. It's simple enough to be refreshing, but there are enough complexities for it to be genuinely satisfying. There's some light hop flavors in there, and some standard grains. Maybe some minerals too. Whatever the case may be, they sure named it right. This is one basic lager that is impossible not to love. This is the only beer that my wife will ask for. At only a dollar a bottle, this is one of the greatest values in the beer world."
"Session lager indeed. No big frills, just a well built and easily quaffed brew. I like it, and could easily drink quite a few of these on a warm afternoon."
"From the adorable stubby bottlette, which goes down much too fast. Smell is malt and perhaps a little lager sulfur. Taste is crisp grain, fizzy carbonation, dry aftertaste. Really enjoyably light, but with reasonable malt flavor and thankfully without the taste of corn."
"pours up a reggy macro gold color with a little vaj white head. the nose initially smelled like poop and pee in the same bowl but after a few seconds of intense sniffing, notes of subtle malt and hops and even a little yellow apple came out to play. the taste is fuller and tastier than expected. a good amount of hops bring a peppery and a floral attribute to the table, accompanied by subtle malts. medium bodied, low spritzy carbo. a decent Session Lager."
"The taste is also a nice, tasty, basic lager: light but full and persisitent in flavour with grain, persistent light grassiness, hints of lemon and green apple peel, grain sweetness mixed with light grassy bitterness. It's nicely balanced with a good feel and it's very drinkable. The flavour persists and holds up very well."
"There's nothing really great about the appearance. It's a light gold beer with a nice but quickly dissolving head. The nose is not very strong but doesn't smell off at all. It's a clean smelling and clean tasting beer. There is some sweetness and some acerbic bite from the flavor and the carbonation. I like the carbonation. It's probably even more drinkable than I'm giving it credit, but the aftertaste is not entirely pleasing. All in all, a pretty good beer for some casual drinking and all in a fun little bottle."
"I was looking for some brews at the now well stocked local beer store and happened upon this brew. I first got pulled in by the classic bottle shape then the name: ""Session"". With a name like that it must be good. And the price, very reasonable. Well I wasn't disappointed. The smell of this beer is a nicely balanced malted grain and sweeter hop smell. The color (it pains me to pour it out of the cool bottle) is golden yellow. The carbonation is perfect, there is a sublime fog that exits the bottle when you open it. The flavor is exquisite, sweet yet ever so slightly hopped to balance and give a sweet dry finish. This is the beer everybody else drinks, but this one has premium flavor and is robust. A true pleasure to drink. I will be buying this in quantity. Drinkability is off the scale. For the style of beer, we may need to give out a new ""Blue Ribbon."""
"Pours a clear yellow straw color, no foam, no lacing. Nice carbonation makes this one sparkle. Excellent aroma of orange blossom and honey. Flavor is right on par with the nose. Hints of orange, honey, plenty of pale malt, and crisp, dry finish. Minimal bitterness. Very smooth and easy to drink. At 5.1%, possible the best Session lager of all time?"
"D: After having some rather pallid lagers lately in the dog days of August, this one really stands out. I wish the big boys made a lager that tasted this good, still for a craft beer it is relatively cheap, a 12er costs like $10.99. Great easy drinking summer baseball beer here, I could drink these like water."
"I found this on sale for $9 a 12 pack here in Portland over the summer. Definitely very high quality/price ratio, high drinkability makes this a great brew to have around. Props to Full Sail for making a good lager and keeping the price reasonable. I wasn't surprised at all to hear that this and their APA account for around 2/3 of their total production when taking their tour in Hood River."
"cheers."
"D: Shiiit, son. It's a session brew. Meant for mass consumption."
"Drinkability: Full Sail made a nice simple lager. It just doesn't have a flavor profile that makes me crave multiple bottles. If the brewers backed off on the malts and kicked up the hop bill while keeping it below 5% ABV, they would really have something."
"Had never seen these bottles before which is weird because Full Sail is so common around here, not my favorite lager but not too bad, might drink again, might be worth trying"
"Good lawnmower beer any time of year. At $9 a 12 pack, you cant go wrong."
"Mouthfeel and drinkability are exceptional. Very crisp and clean, smooth easy drinking beer. This is the perfect BBQ beer. Only two very minor complaints. I wish they could keep the flavor and drop the abv down to 4-4.5% and the other is that it's not available in my area. This would be a staple in my fridge in the summertime."
"One can drink a lot of these suckers as the name would elude. Very refreshing on a 95 F day. I would recommend checking this out."
"Would definately buy again...the name says it all!"
"D : This is a great session beer for the summer. Is one that I can drink plenty of."
"Poured into a Sam Adam Boston Lager glass, formed a 1/2"" bright white head above the clear burnished gold brew. Head falls at a moderate pace, with good lacing. Aroma is sweet pale malts. Taste is sweet upfront, smooth in the middle, and crisp hoppiness on the close. Mouthfeel is amazingly soft over the tongue, and drinkability is superb. Glad I got this one and a twin as an extra, this stuff is great!"
"D- Very high drinkability, I think I found my beer of the summer."
"This is a beer that its name says it all. This is the ultimate ""session"" brew. This beer is has strong malt flavor but is not heavy either. This is definitely a brew that could be had all day long. This is my go-to beer when I want something fairly light and refreshing when I'm not in the mood for something hoppy. This will always be a stand-by in the fridge."
"I'll start with the bottle. Its a very cool retro stubby type of bottle that you might have seen in your grandma's medicine cabinate. The bottle is a keeper. Huge white fluffy head on this one and its a shiney golden yellow in color. Smells of floral and spicey grassy hops with some grainy earthy malts sents. This beer has a nice floral taste up front with a spicey hop finish and a bready malt flaver throughout. Flavor sticks nicely. Decent mouth feel but as the name implies it is extremely drinkable."
"This lager has huge flavor but still be light enough for an afternoon on the porch with friends. I've had it in a pint glass and straight from the bottle. What better way to drink a ""session"" beer. Not an over complicated beer, but not simplistic either."
"Very good, crisp lager. Very refreshing. I will have to be on the lookout for this beer in the coming months, as it seems like it would be a great accompaniment on a hot summer's day."
"I will go camping with this beer!"
"this beer pours nicely to be a nice golden -yellow (this is actually the first time i have drank this not straight from the bottle) small head, disappears right away. tiny bubbles, smell of good malts. GREAT drinkability great beer , great brewery, great price"
"There is something about drinking from a stubby that makes everything alright. Session has a very bright, clear, golden straw color. This beer is very well balanced with a buscuity flavor and a crisp hop bite. At just over 5%, a very drinkable beer. Forget the mass market beers, this is perfect for mowing the lawn."
"Not a bad lager. Goes well with a burger. Good and cheap. Golden color with a tan head. The aroma is of grainy malts. The taste is bland, but not bad. No off flavors. Just mild and a little malty. Feel is crisp and has a medium body. A good session beer as the label applies. Still shows some quality characteristics unlike most macor lagers. Good job full sail."
"A very tasty Lager that goes down easy. 11 ounce bottles, but who's counting? This is what I turn to when I want a break from the heavy & high ABV of craft beers. I can drink a 12 pack of this easily. Highly recommended spring or summer beer."
"Easily a great session lager. I finished mine rather quickly and couldn't wait for another. I will purchase this again."
"D - Not a bad beer, but the flavors are too watered down to be truely enjoyable."
"D: Overall, a really decent lager that is exactly what the name implies - a true 'session' beer. The 11 oz. bottle is cute until you realize that your getting shorted an ounce. Oh well, I'll ponder this over my next 12 pack."
"D: Very drinkable on one of those days laying on the beach or the lake. In general a good beer will probably buy it again if in the mood."
"Poured from a 12oz. bottle into a pilsner glass. The beer pours a medium straw color, forming a creamy 1 inch white head, with light fingers of lace on the glass. The aroma is malty, but with a noticeable hop presence as well. Very suprising, as I expected a full matly/grainy BMC aroma. Taste is also suprising. Smooth malt and light buttery flavor. No hops detectible, but a fuller flavor than expected, while remaining simple. Smooth medium mouthfeel. The beer is called a session lager, and I cant argue with that. Good abv. and decent flavoring. Overall, not a bad beer to have in stock for those days when a heavy brew just wont work."
"I was in the mood for a lager when I came across this one and it didn't disappoint. The aroma wasn't very strong and the taste had a touch of sweetness to it, perhaps from fruit. An earthiness was also noted. It had a medium body with light carbonation on the tongue. I wasn't blown away by it, but it was easy to drink."
"First off, this beer is way too easy to drink, it is almsot gone before I can review it. Nice yellow color with an earthy, dirt-like, mineral smell that I get from lagers but is not at all bad for some reason. Clean lager taste, goes down so easy. This is a perfect summer beer that I am sorry I have not been drinking! A keg of this would be good."
"Drinkable (what else?), but still not much taste."
"I keep these around now for Whenever."
"Overall this is an excellent lager. I'm not the biggest lager fan in the world, but I really like this one. Would have liked it a bit more hoppy, but thats just my taste. Despite htat this beer is extremely drinkable. It should be a beer that you bring to events that non-craft beer drinkers will be at. I am sure that it will open their eyes to greater beers. I am glad I picked up a 12 pack of this, because if I didn't I'd be out already."
"d: As the name suggests, this is a great session beer. Nothing fancy, an american lager made the way it should be. Plain but enjoyable, a good beer to keep on hand when you want something simple, refreshing, and easy drinking."
"Clear light golden. Slightly deeper in color than white grape juice, but along that line. Moderate amounts of carbonation surface in the body of this beer. Slight white head leaves sporadic islands of lace. Nice bready malt aroma. Slight hop spiciness noted on the nose as well. Solid nose for the style. This beer has a fizzy feel to it, like a macro, but no adjunct like flavors to it. However, the flavor really doesn't thrill me much more than a good adjunct macro. It's grainy sweet with light touches of toast and biscuit. I was expecting more out of Full Sail in a beer like this."
"Light gold with a light white head. Sweet corn like maltiness. Thin and a bit watery, but nicely sweet corn flavor in a good way. Very mild bitterness, easy drinking and a great alternative to macro stuff. No skunkiness at all was also a big plus. I could definitely drink this again when looking for cheap-ish beer to drink in quantity. nice stuff for a lager."
"A thirst-quencher for sure. As the name indicates, it sure is ""sessionable"". (Where's that other ounce?) Nothing extraordinary, but a nice, crisp, refreshing lager."
"Drinkability is excellent. This is what the big boys should be making or at least offering one like this. I will buy this again. Why 11 ounce bottles?"
"This is very easy to drink, which is by design, of course. This is a very fine session beer, exactly what Full Sail promised."
"The taste has some nice hop bitterness up front with a mild but definitely present malt character that smooths out the bitterness nicely. Very easy drinking Lager here! The mouthfeel is darn god for the style and the carbonation is on the high side but again, this is one easy to drink Lager that I'm liking a lot. Thanks again, John!"
"This what BMC should be making for everyday drinking. This is the last bottle from a 12/pk picked up in Colorado Nov 2007, I'll miss this one. Adios amigo, hasta la vista."
"Drinkablity: Easy drinking lager with plenty of satisfying qualities that make it unique."
"cool bottle, throwback to the old stumptown style."
"Papery pale malt with some low level bitterness behind it. A little hint of apple at first sip, that fades away after that. Somewhat grainy, and thin-bodied. When quaffed, there's more of an astringency, but not when sipped. It was easy to have several, and I think that's the ultimate goal of this beer."
"Picked up a single to try it out, neat grenade-like bottle. Not super flavorful but enough there to stay interested."
"This beer poured a clear golden color with a creamy head and a steady stream of bubbles in my Sam Adams glass. The smell is grainy and slightly hoppy. The taste is malty and earthy with some bitterness. The mouthfeel is medium bodied. Overall, this beer is nicely balanced in flavor and quite smooth. It is definitely making me rethink what an American Lager can be!"
"Good try, though, guys, nothing wrong with a craft brew lager."
"They got the name right, a fine session beer."
"Poured a nice clear yellow color with about two fingers of white head that slowly dissipated to a thin lacing of white. Aroma is slightly of hops, but no real strong smell. Flavor is good, one of the best basic lagers that I have had. Drinkability is excellent. Mouthfeel is great. Great session beer, hence the name."
"11 oz (?) stubby little bottle. Under the cap there is a picture of a pair of scissors that has a very Brechtian label reading ""scissors"". Not sure what that is. A: Yellow with a hint of orange, champagne like fizziness, good amount of thick head that retains pretty well, decent amount of lacing. S: Very light malt, yeast, perhaps some really distant hops. Nothing too loud. T: Very light but actually very nicely balanced. Some flour, very distant hops, slightly dry finish. Very, very clean. Maybe some slight citrus in there. M: Crisp, coarse, refreshing. D: I wasn't expecting much, my mom picked up this beer when I was home in Idaho because she thought the bottle was cool. I expected a bland macro lager but I was willing to give it a chance after I saw it was full sail, and I was pleasantly surprised. Really nice drinking beer. Like a really nice version of Budweiser. I'd probably pick it up if I saw it again, though I'm not likely to see this one on the east coast."
"Full Sail Sessions pours a beautiful clearity with amazing carbonation. The head is very respectable that is slow to diminish. Crisp light malts and subtle noble hops dominate the nose. The initial taste is very close to the nose, malts transitioning to slight hops. Good. It is refreshingly light in the mouth without being weak. This beer is everything a light lager should be. With a tad more hops it could be a killer German Pilsner. I dig the 11oz. bottle but know that I am getting ripped off in the long run. However, underneath each cap is either a paper, scissor, or rock, so it can make for an interesting game throughout the night. This beer is one of the few beers that I enjoy straight out of the bottle. Without being demeening I consider this beer to be a high class ""lawn mowin'"" beer."
"Thanks to unclejedi for this one."
"Drinkability- Not bad. Good beer for after mowing the lawn. What a great old school bottle though"
"Hint: drink it before it warms and you wont have to taste it."
"11 ounce bottle, best by 12/17/07. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours a clear golden color with an inch and a half frothy white head. Lacing and head retention are both good. It smells like sweet malt, grassy hops and a bit of a lemon/citrusy smell. The taste is mainly bready/grainy, with some lemon and hops. Finish is crisp and clean. Mouthfeel is light/medium and not watery at all. Drinkability is good, it's smooth and easy to drink. ""Session"" is the perfect name for this beer, I think it's a good overall lager."
"Comment: I'm not a lager head but if I were this would be a beer that I would consider fror my lengthly sessions. It is a very solid beer and reflects well on Full Sails stable of beers."
"Notes: I probably wont be picking this one up again. This is a very average beer  nothing offensive, but nothing really standing out in my opinion. This one lives up to its name in that its a perfect session beer, but nothing youll really remember."
"Stubby little 11oz bottle poured into a pint glass. Pours a golden yellow color with a white head that quickly turns into a thin lacing. The aroma is some grain and a touch of hops. The taste is clean and crisp with a nice grainy malt backbone. The drinkability is extremely high as it would make a perfect session brew. Overall, this is a very nice lager that is highly drinkable. Recommended. I only bought a single bottle and I am craving another one. I suppose I will have to stock up the next time I go to the store."
"D: I think I just might have found my new session brew to replace some of the other pale lagers I used to keep around in the past. This beer tastes kind of like a good German Helles, but has more flavor while retaining the high level of drinkability."
"O: A little tasty, goes down easily, not filling at all, good representation of style, it’s a good beer to drink for a long time, but I’d prefer something a little more flavorful."
"A nice session ale, hence the name. Worth its cheap price."
"Bought from a local vendor that stores it's beer at room temperature so this may affect my review. The story I heard is this is an attempt to re-create the old (1960's) Olympia stubby in all it's glory. My opinion is they came pretty close to the mark! It seems in retrospect to be slightly hoppier than the original an a bit stronger in the alcohol department. A great all-day microbrew. You could drink 4 or 5 of these at an afternoon party and still be coherent. A great lager for a hot day."
"Drinks alright, a little maybe a little too simple for me, but I did like it better than the special edition#2 & very happy I didn't buy a 12 pack!"
"Drinkable: Easy to drink and particularly welcome after a hot day"
"Pours a nice clean/clear golden color, nice carbonation, tiny fizzy white head, some sticky lacing around the edges. The nose is sweet, malty, slightly hoppy, and some caramel. The taste is malty, hoppy, sweet, and a nice touch of caramel. Light-Medium body, this brew is crisp and smooth. Drinkable, a nice Lager from Full Sail, a nice thirst quencher."
"Thanks to Talisker for the extra! Pours a very crisp yellow almost orange with almost no head. Aroma is sweet malt with very subdued hops in the back. The taste is actually extremely bland, very hard to distinguish it from the macro guys. The beer is very light, but the blandness overpowers any mouthfeel aspects. This one was just about a drain pour."
"This beer is great for the style. It's light in color like your average macro. The taste starts with pale grains followed by bready malt and a toach of caramel on top back by a little spicy hop and a tinge of bitterness, yum. This is a great example of what the craft beer movement can do. This is an awesome summer, grilling, and session beer. I had a 12-pack for a beer noob tasting party and this sucker was gone fast."
"Session Premium Lager pours a a golden yellow with a white head from a stubby eleven ounce twist off bottle. The aroma is grainy, but I also pick up a bit of malt and hops. Light body, the flavor is pretty good. The flavor is kind of grainy with a good amount of malt with hops coming in somewhat assertively for the style at the end. One of the best lagers I've had in a long time."
"Overall: A pretty good lager, not remarkable but better than most of whats commonly available. Also more likely to be found fresh than imported lagers. Unfortunately, it appears that I tried this one a bit past its prime; I'd be interested in trying a fresher sample. Worth a try."
"Anybody up for a game of rock-paper-scissors?"
"Well, the first thing you notice is the sweet fruity aroma as you pour it out of the bottle; this looks like your typical macro beer (just a bit darker in color), its a golden color thats crystal clear with plenty of carbonation, its topped off with a light off white head that tapers into a thin layer with some mild lacing. It has a very appetizing aroma that reminds me of apples and grapes; it has very sweet and mildly citrusy perfume thats clean and tempting. It has a smooth slightly crisp and tart taste when it first hits your tongue, and is followed by a sweet semi-dry aftertaste. This ale is actually kind of dry through out its entire flavor and does a good job in hiding that alcohol flavor, but its definitely a good beer."
"Full Sail's Session lager in the stubbie bottle is a beautiful thing - it fits so nicely in the hand it's almost a shame to pour it into a glass. However, once poured it displays a clear yellow-gold body and creamy bright white head that holds seemingly forever. In fact, even three quarters of the way through the glass it's still a complete covering. The nose is clean, and expresses sweet malt and a touch of yeasty fruitiness (apple, berry). The mouthfeel is a touch fuller than might be expected with a dextrinous, medium body, but it remains fairly crisp across the palate. The flavor is basic, and not much more than might be expected of an American macro-lager except that it's a touch more malty and has some nice yeastiness to it. Hops are relegated to the background, and their gently spicy and floral character is secondary to the sweetish malt. Interestingly, as I'm guessing it's intended, there's a smear of corn-like dimethyl sulfide that clearly pushes it into the American, rather than European, realm. It's an enjoyable and nicely done quaff that seems popular with the younger crowd - probably because of the retro appearance of the bottle and label - but it's nothing spectacular."
"Drinkability: It lives up to its name, i would definatly enjoy knockin back quite a few of these with some friends, cool bottle too. A basic beer brewed right."
"We called for smore lagers that can be consumed, BWKOA(beer without keeling over after)and this is one. Cheesy aroma, but good head on yellow colour. Medium smooth mouthfeel, with herbal bitterness in finish. Satisfying.Certainly overated but drinkable."
"11 oz. bottle- color of golden yellow , with a thin white head - nose of grassy , malt , some detergent , oats , slight sweetness , and mild hops  taste of grass , soapy , mild hops , and white wine? - body is light , with some acidity , and with medium carbonation  aftertaste of white wine , mild hops and grasses"
"previous scores were all 4's, adjusted"
"Pours out a chill-hazed gold with active bubbles in the body and a humongous head that mellows out to a half an inch of fluff. Leaves crazy thick lacing patters on the glass. Nose is clean, malty, apple-like, with not much in the hop department. Flavor starts of a bit toasty and soon comes a beautiful hop presence. Floral and herbal. Finishes slightly dry and citric. Mouthfeel is sturdy, but I kind of wanted a more lively carbonation. On another beer, such as a brown ale, the mouthfeel would have been perfect, but somehow it didn't gel with this. Great drinkability. A session for sure."
"This is a great product. It is an easy-drinking macro-style beer brewed with high-quality ingredients. A well-built beer, but still makes you kinda want a plastic cup and a cigarette."
"This is a really good lager. Pours a golden yellow color. thin head. Smells a bit grassy, nice maltiness. Taste is classic lager, but nothing getting in the way of the nice malt flavor. No noticeable aftertaste. Very thin and watery mouthfeel. This would make an excellent beer after a hot day of yard work or a long day at work. An easy, every day beer."
"A light golden appearance with a white fizzy head having a light floral hop and malt aroma that is clean, crisp and simple which says the same for the taste as well. Mouthfeel is light - med. with good carbonation making for an excellent session beer that goes down light and smooth with no lack of flavor. Probably my new favorite American lager."
"This is a very drinkable beer, and a typical lager, but overpriced in a bar @ 3.50 a bottle. Look for it in 12 packs at a grocery store and enjoy it on a hot day."
"Nice drinkable beer not overwhelming, low alcohol. Should appeal to everyone."
"D- an incredibly drinkable beer perfect for just about any occasion."
"Split a 12 pack with my bro this summer while in Seattle on vacation.Great taste went down smooth.We drank this on a clear day sitting on his deck looking at Mt.Ranier.I wonder if it would be the same sitting in my basement watching the Bears?If they ever sell this in IL. I will find out."
"D- for what this beer is, i haven't had better. This isnt my personal style, but i really wouldnt mind having this beer some other place some other time."
"D- This is an un-skunked Heini or Pils Urq. Very good lager and a good choice if you want to session a lighter beer. Why it comes in 11 oz. bottles is beyond me."
"Drinkability is exceptional. This is truly a fine ""session"" lager, if you forgive the pun. It pairs well with many cuisines (It was delicious with some Indian food today), but stands up on its own. A great alternative to adjunct-laden macro lagers for those who prefer a lighter beer."
"From one standpoint drinkability is high- its easy to swallow and relatively light in alcohol, and in that sense its a session beer. Unfortunately, I just don't think there is enough going on here to warrant me ever having another."
"-Take any typical American lager, subtract all that limits its taste and this is what you'll get. Makes me proud to be born and raised in Oregon."
"By far the best ""just lager"" I've ever had."
"Pours golden colored with white head. Aroma is malty with faint hop aroma. Taste is mostly sweet malts with a little hops in the finish. Maybe some fruitiness, but it is mostly crisp and clean. The carbonation gives it a little bite, but works well with this light mouthfeel (but fuller than a lot of beers in this style). This beer lives up to its name in drinkability, I could easily drink a few these The only complaint I have is this is often too expensive, but I recently found it on sale for $10.00 a twelve pack. I'd reccomend this one, this is one of the best lagers I've had."
"A good session beer that I truly recommend, I hope it's readily available for this Summer...cheers."
"All will bow before the king of poundable lagers. Full Sail gets nearly everything right with their sexily-bottled Session Premium Lager. With a hint of hops, sensational smoothness, and low 5.1 ABV, Session is the perfect summertime beer. Buy it by the case..."
"And...I got Scissors."
"From the bottle (the coolest bottle I have ever seen). Pours out to a medium yellow color with a nice head of white foam. Aromas of mild malts, grass, earthy grain. Taste is medium bodied and completely quaffable; malt, hops, a touch of light herbs and hay. Nice. Mouthfeel was refreshing and bubbly. Quite nice. Drinkability is good. I have to admit, most I drank straight from the bottle, which was still a good expericence. Recommended. Special thanks to Dubbercody for the sample."
"Clean, solid, tasty, an easy drinker for sure."
"Straw colored with just a bit of head. Aroma is of earthy hops and sweet grains. Slightly sweet cereal flavor with just enough hop bitterness to provide a nice balance. A slight metallic finish. Nicely carbonated. This would be a nice summer session beer and would probably be a nice gateway beer for the macro drinker."
"Overall: Quite clean overall. Total lack of aroma really hurts this one, especially against the substantial (for the style) body. Drinkable, but not notable. This is brewed by Full Sail Brewing, so they deserve some props for even giving this style a go, but it isn't really clear what they are trying to achieve. At least the 11 oz. (which is enough) hand-grenade (sort of) shaped bottle is cute."
"finally, something that lives up to the 'hype'."
"After a wonderful cool and wet winter it's geting miserably hot here in the eastern bay area. I often look for a more refreshing type of beer to drink and have often been intrigued by this offering from Full Sail. The unique stubby bottles remind me of my Fijian vacations, we're off to a good start. Light gold color and there is a decnt head which leaves a few smatterings of lacing. Fuity tastes meshes nicely with the traditional lager maltiness and light hopping. Goes down well and is refreshing. Not my favorite in a style I don't delve into much anymore, but it's a good alternative when I can't find North Coasts Scrimshaw. Decent beer all around."
"Drinkability: What can I say? The beer is aptly named!"
"Bottle. Pours a Bud yellow without much head. Better than the look would suggest. Nose is malty. Mostly fruit (apples) and malt but pretty balanced, with some hop bitterness. A tad of sweetness as well. A good session brew. Thanks to Zorro for providing the bottle."
"Pours a clear, golden with a finger of soft, bubbly white head. Fresh cereal grains and honey sweet malt blend with un-macroish hop zest and spice. Nice. Clean, tangy to sweet bread malts throughout. Honeyish sweetness and a good toasted cereal barley taste. Zesty, floral, spicy hops are tasty and refreshingly bitter. Not outstanding, but well made. Moderate-light body with a lively feel. Considerably drinkable. Let's hope macro drinkers find this and try it to see what a good American golden lager tastes like."
"The beer poured a light gold color with a big bubbled, white head. The beer left a small amount of thin lacing. The nose was big on the grains. The taste was not overly complex, about what I expected, but very fulfilling for the style: a beer with a nice maliness, with a very clean, lightly hopped finish. There was a dryness to the beer, but it proved to be thirst quenching and incredibly drinkable with its medium abv. The name proved to be perfectly fitting for that reason. A perfect beer for a hot, day, perhaps at the beach."
"Lagers are a style that people dismiss a lot of times, but a good one is something I really enjoy. I wish more people would take a stab at a premium lager."
"As with all sweet things, multiples are tough, and Sessions suffers that fate. Great once, pretty good after two, but I'd probably move on and look for something else if I were drinking three (or more). Still, a fine beer at a reasonable price by the folks at Hood River!"
"Aroma and flavor is a bit maltier than I expected, Fairly refresing but had some noticable bitterness to it. Not as clean as a typical lager of this type. Overall pretty good, definately a good alternative to drinking macros."
"If you are stuck on beers like Miller, Pacifico, and other corn and other adjunct filled beers, give this a try. It won't taste THAT different, but it does taste better and you can experience what beer drinking in America was like before prohibition. Even comes in a neat little 11oz stubby bottle. Plus, it's cheap (22 bucks for a case of 24 bottles at my local speciality liquor store) and it has a cool little rock-paper-scissors game you can play with the caps"
"Light, crisp taste. Smooth malt and biscuit flavors. I gave this beer average scores, but upped the drinkability due the session category."
"This beer was a pleasant surprise. From the great old-school bottle to the awesome taste (and cheap price tag!) this is definitely one worth trying."
"Opinion: I was a bit surprised that this beer tasted so good. I didn't know what to think about this one, and I have passed it up a couple times. Finally I broke down and said to myself...""what the hell...it's another review. As I tried it, I was glad that it was balanced and well hopped with enough to make it very palatable. The malt has enough girth to let you know that it is a real beer. I would put this beer up closer to a Helles than I would a Macro."
"Presented in the ever-nostalgic 11oz ""stubby"" bottle that was put to rest by Olympia in 2003. Pours a light straw color topped by a half-inch of creamy white head. Not much carbonation in the body. Aroma of light malt and some sweet fruit (raisins?). Palate is nice up front, a touch malty with a nice bready character. Develops some astringecy toward the finish, while maintaining the mystery fruity sweetness from the nose. Body is light and a touch fizzy, but holds the flavor well enough. Highly drinkable, and a good alternative to macro-brewed lagers."
"Yuck! If this didn't have that sulfur edge I might have enjoyed this more, but it does. NOT a beer I can recommend."
"Exceptionally drinkable."
"Overall a very good session beer. I could see this being enjoyed by a BA trying to drink a decent beer in a tight situation, or a new beer drinker saying this is their ""favorite beer of all time."" Give it a try if you have some fridge space. Its quite cheap."
"In terms of setting out to achieve what it's supposed to, this beer is the shit. Is it the best tasting beer I've had? No. It's not even the best beer I've had today. But it fulfills it's purpose better than any beer I've had in a while. This would make an outstanding session beer, so it lives up to it's name. I only wish the cool, old-school bottles had a little more beer in them."
"Plus, it's fun to drink 'em out of the stubby, chubby 11 ounce bottles."
"Poured from a stubby a clear light golden with a one finger white head very sprtizy looking,wow nice aromas going on definent lemon rind and grassy hop aromas melding nicely with some toasted grain and maybe a touch of iron.Very sturdy mouthfeel no wimpy yellow fizzy lager here quite grainy in the flavor and mouthfeel department quite clean with very nice herbal finish showing a generous amount of hops thrown in this brew.Now this would be a go to beer for sporting events or get togethers for me,a well built American lager old school and damn good."
"Short stubbie 11 ounce bottle."
"Short stubby bottle; on the bottom of the twist-off cap there is a picture of rock and the word ROCK for some unknown reason Anyway, it pours a clear golden color with a moderate white head that settles into a thin lace. Nose is clean malts with light fruity esters and a grassy herbalness. Taste is light sweet malts and dry grassy grains. An herbal and spicy hop bitterness comes across in the finish. Very clean and crisp. A very appropriate name for this would certainly make for an excellent session beer. I think this is what all macros aspire to be."
"The color is a bright golden color with plenty of carbonation. The head is thick and of an average height. Retention is quite nice. The aroma is fairly hoppy for a lager, with a hop smell similar to the noble varieties. A moderately sweet underlying malt body is also detected. As for the flavor, this is the best straight-up American lager I've had. The flavor consists of a notable hop flavor over a malt body that has a moderate level of sweetness. A touch of caramel flavor adds another wrinkle here. Anyway, the name says it all, this is an excellent session beer."
"Full Sail Session Lager does just about everything right. One minor quibble: knocking back the ABV by a full percent would make it even more sessionable. From the abundance of flavor to its easy drinking nature... from the cool stubbie bottle to the Old Skool graphics... this one is a keeper. Its only real fault is that I can't run out and get a 12-pack whenever the mood strikes me."
"A solid, drinkable, and unexceptional lager. At 2 dollars apiece for an 11 oz bottle, it's an odd offering. The bottles and very plain lables are old fashioned, so I guess it's supposed to play of nostalgia, but it doesn't stand out on the shelf or in the glass."
"Stubby 11 oz bottle provided to me by GABF as part of a reward for all my volunteering for the 2005 festival. Pours a dancing two finger nearly white head over a dull (and partly cloudy) straw colored liquid. Smells tin-like saaz hops ans some richer hallertauer character, too. Clean pale malt smell (the only reason I know is that I was smelling some actual pale malt about an hour ago). It comes acoss as a mild biscuity smell. Tastes macro-like with a richer sweet. The hops are dark, like those used in Budweiser, but the hops here are stonger and blend into the malt sweet more readily. Nice aftertaste that consists of an aromatic hop floral dancing around with a rising, falling, rising, falling grain sweetness. Hop bitter is low and wet sweet carries the day. Carbonation is higher than I'd like and the acrid sting on my tongue is a distraction. Near the end of the glass, which has warmed quite a bit, I get some cardboard and a bit or tart, like raspberry. Medium body that keeps the darker hop character around. Decent beer, but not one I will purchase in the future. Many other beers that suit my stout-and-IPA palette better."
"Overall Impression: Well, its build to be a session beer, and it has all the right characteristics. Good but mellow taste, nice texture, easy drinking; about the only thing that holds back a real session is the 5% abv, which is hidden like the family jewels. Great offering by Full Sail; recommended."
"Overall impression: A refreshing alternative to BMC. Highly drinkable, and as the name implies, a fantastic session beer. Great gateway beer for the BMC crowd."
"Poured from the retro 11 ounce stubby bottle into a standard glass, the head is feathery, frothy, bright white. Narrow twist of butter sweetness upfront, followed by a thin thread of freshly cut grass. Taste: Immediate push of simultaneous malt and hop action -- glazed donut sweetness, a hint, with a shallow shell of hop bitterness surrounding. Aftertaste is pleasantly dry. This is indeed a session beer, and one of the best American lagers I've had. Affordable price, too."
"Presentation: Packaged in a short eleven ounce brown glass bottle, much like the standard brown glass beer bottles of the 1960's. Served in a Pilsener glass."
"Pours a familiar yellow beer color. Smells crisp and fresh, the way any good lager should. And this is a good lager. A malty sweetness backed up by a light hop finish. I would gladly buy this in place of anything made by the big boys. Went great this past Labor Day weekend with chile verde burritos and tri tip. Simple and enjoyable. Don't bother with the glass for this one. Straight outta the bottle is the only way to go."
"Crisp mouthfeel. Good carbonation. Refreshing. Well made lager with a semi-dry malty finish. Perfectly named and good for an all day BBQ-ing session."
"good size froth with decent lacing that fades to an island effect. Nice color, a slight orange color to offset the typical yellow of its brother beers. Really refreshing. Hops come through at the end to make it interesting. For the most part though its light on the palate and malted. VERY REFRESHING!...I was told to not rank this beer until I'd had at least 3 or 4 and I can see why...this is #4 for the night and its truly refreshing and I'm not bored with it at all. Gotta thank Reebshorts for the insight on this quality brew. Full Sail brewing is on to something here and even the price is right for the macro swilling mongrels to at least pay attention to it. peanuts, hotdogs, hamburgers, good ol' american type ballgame food would be a perfect combo with this. A great Lager."
"The beer evacuates the 11-ounce stubby brown bottle a limpid gold with a modest bright white head that fades quickly, leaving a velum like coating of lace upon the glass. Nose is the standard lager malt, crisp and clean, the start is sweet and the grain profile light to medium with the top light in feel. Finish is stern in its acidity, the hops apropos to the style, a decent drinking beer, that I think would make a nice Session beer, quite dry and thirst quenching."
"I agree that the stubby bottles are really cool & I do love the rock/paper/scissors game under the caps as well!"
"Can't really comment on the color of this or appearance of the fluid itself, as it went straight from the bottle into my mouth, and down the throat. I recommend this approach. This is a solid lager, and comes in a pretty cool looking stubby 11 oz bottle. There is an adequate amount of carbonation here, but it doesn't stand in the way this beer going down in record time (maybe it's the bottle style, or maybe I was real thirsty). I found this at QFC for $10 a halfer, and i'll definately pick up some more. It's great with BBQ chicken Thighs, and as a bonus there is either a ""rock", ""paper", or ""scissors"" logo under each cap. So drinking game potential is high with this one."
"I give the packaging high marks as it uses a 11oz stubby that screams retro. The beer itself is a well made lager that is almost like a Canadian. I compare this to Phillips Phoenix Gold both in packaging and taste. I can't give it really high marks because I got bored of the taste after a few bottles. This is not a problem with the brewer but rather the pedestran style."
"Drinkability  I dont know if Id want to session a case of this, but it was a solid entry in an otherwise tired market."
"Pours a brilliantly clear yellow-gold color and is topped by a frothy off white head. The aroma is lightly spicy with notes of lemon, herbs, and a bit of sweet grain. The taste is light an spritzy with a spicy hop note to it and a subtle bitterness in the finish. This beer is nice and light, it does have a bit more flavor than your standard macro (actually quite a bit more), but it still is not packed with flavor. It is certainly quite quaffable, and has a certain appeal to it, especially on a hot summer afternoon."
"Drinkability- A bit disappointed as it tastes quite a bit like a typical macro. I'll take PBR any day over this, even though it is ""good"" for a macro type brew."
"The beer pours a pale gold color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is above average. It has a pale malt scent that is a bit husky and dry. It's slightly sweet with musty lager yeast aroma. The taste is good. It has a smooth pale malt flavor that is dry, yet slightly sweet with grainy feel. It goes down easy and finishes with some residual sweetness and a nice hop balance. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a low bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a great beer. It has excellent flavor. I love the hop presence; very enjoyable."
"Plain but perhaps the best basic lager I have had in a long time. Shame this is not in MA cause I'd buy it by the case."
"This beer is really hard to pin down. While there isn't anything that turns me off, there isn't anything that's really good either. It's crisp, but not exactly clean. It's drinkable, but not exactly smooth. Definitely worth a try in substitution of a macro, but nothing to write home about. Bonus points for the stubby."
"I'd put this on par with Henry's, and can't shake that feeling.... I'm not sure what the ""up yours beer snobs"" thing is about - but I hope hipster Portlanders will drink this instead of that anti-union adjunct-swill Pabst."
"Marketing aside, how's the beer? It's a decent, all-American golden lager, very close to what the megas make. It has perhaps a bit more ooomph, just a bit more flavor, and a cleaner profile. But it's got those mild if prickly, tangy hops in the nose to remind you of cheaper brews. The finish is succinct and keeps you coming back for more; drinkability is very high which stands to reason since that is the beer's sole reason for existing. I imagine many will love this but most BAs will probably taste this, think ""hmm, ok, fine"" and quickly move on to something more substantial. Bring this to a party, or on a trip where trunk space is at a premium (the stubbies take up less room than longnecks). This is a good choice if you are spending time with those suspicious of beer snobbery, but the beer tastes much better poured into a glass, hence you may need to blow your cover."
"Will buy this often during this BBQ season."
"Discussion of the appearance must start with the bottle; Full Sail was reportably able to purchase the original molds from the now defunct Olympia brewery for a truly retro look that has a lot of sentimental value here in the north west. The beer its self is pale golden with with a light half inch head and a bit of lacing. Aroma is lightly hopped with hints of hay and tin. The taste is very full for an American lager. It's refreshing to be able to taste hops and barley in what is essentially a ""Miller Time"" sort of beer. Mouth feel is a little flat, and could use a hint more carbonation. Over all a very drinkable beer. Go pick up a 12 pack."
"This is a great lager that Full Sail should be very proud of."
