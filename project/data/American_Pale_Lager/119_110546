I notice some of the citra off-flavours on this creeping into the palate, the slightly 'cat-piss' note, and overall it comes across as fairly standard.

The color is a pale lemony yellow gold with a very faint haziness...  A light to moderate bit of sluggish carbonation...  The first descriptor that comes to mind is dank...  An odd mix of citrus and leather...  Cold cuts???  Thirteen hundred plus reviews and I can't say I've ever used that term...  I struggle to tell whether the aroma is enticing or slightly off putting, probably a bit more of the latter but it's not to the point of being a deal breaker...  The flavor profile is a slightly muted version of the nose...  Dank and hoppy with a few unusual notes mixed in...  The hoppiness intensifies on the finish...  The mouthfeel is medium bodied and quite sturdy...  Smooth carbonation...  Somewhat dense...  Goes down smoothly...  The finish is a bit chalky as the hops resurgence occurs on the finish...  A rather unique and somewhat satisfying offering...

Very pure and fresh nose, abounds with a cornucopia of tart citrus, leafy herbal matter and toasted bread crust, some peppery notes as well, the white pit fruit and pineapple scents are plush and do what the can to soften the contours, overall has a high energy profile. Medium-bodied, somewhat creamy texture at first then it becomes successively drier although stops short of bitter. The bite in the pineapple, papaya, nectarine fruit trumps any juicier apricot or peach. The floral element more pronounced here, the citrus seems to settle on a mix of pink and white grapefruit. The graininess and herbaceousness stiffen the mouth feel after the attack and the mild maltiness appears mostly after the show has ended. To its credit, the whole is greater than the sum of the parts and it’s best to just enjoy it than parse it.","farrago","Feb 10, 2015"

The smell is of old hops and fruit, and the initial taste is a bitterness that even a bitter beer lover as myself cannot stand. As someone who really loves grapefruit, this made me taste a flavor of grapefruit that may have ruined grapefruits for me for good. What an absolutely horrible beer. The beer looks great in a glass. Very nice head, delicious-looking color, how very very deceptive. Once the bitterness hits the tongue and you think the worst part is over, the back of the mouth feel is even more disgusting. Swallowing this beer is one of the most horrible things i've ever had to do in my life. Unfortunately I bought a 6 pack of it at my local grocery store (Wegmanns) and have to finish the pack. I have 3 left to go, and was so compelled by the horrible taste I actually signed up for an account just to review how horrible this beer was.","moss1988","May 11, 2014"

Beer is smooth and citric flavored hoppy and yet also grainy/dry with a crisp finish. I don't have too much to say to this beer other than the hops hit you pretty good and it has balance with the other main taste being a dry, grainy, crackerlike maltiness. Good beer that is easy to drink and refreshing.","clayrock81","May 10, 2014"

If you like citra, you'll love this. Doesn't pack the malt/booze package that a citra IPA would. I would label this as a solid hop head lawnmower beer. You could knock back a six of this over a warm summer evening. Otter Creek should really be marketing this as a summer beer.","FloppyTopper","May 01, 2014"

Just a super clean lager that has been beautifully hopped with one of my favorite varietals. After this, Kind Ryed and Double Dose, Otter Creek has really been batting a thousand lately. By far my favorite IPL, and in fact better than a lot of IPAs out there, this gets a perfect 5 from me (my first and so far only) because I just don't see how anyone could possibly improve upon it, although admittedly the playing field seems to be rather small right now.","cjoc83","Mar 23, 2014"

While not a true session beer, I could have easily had another in a sitting if I didn't have anything else on hand. I love beers that push the edge of what's available and what the norms are and this certainly fit that bill. Like the Sam Adams IPL, I hope this is a start of a new trend that still has a long way to go in terms of what else is possible when it comes to lagers of this sort.

The head is huge and lumpy, leaving ample chunky lacy deposits on the glass. Fresh, fruity citrus greets the nose: tangerine, grapefruit, and lime along with some straw, green leafiness, and oily pine. A toasted cereal malt sweetness lingers in the background, but is noticeable. Big, fresh hoppiness continues into the flavor...grassy, bitter lemon zest, pine resin, tea, and grapefruit. Juicy citrus oils linger on the tongue as does a solid bitterness. Medium-light and moderately creamy in the finish. Other than a certain cleanliness to the aroma, I'm not sure I would recognize this as a lager. Very hoppy, crisp, and drinkable. Good stuff...I could drink many!","wedge","Mar 17, 2014"

Since his early days with DFH, this guy has been making solid beer but after the recent hoppy beers Otter Creek has released one of them being a collaboration with Lawson's. Unfiltered golden body slightly hazed bright white head perfect keller style pils appearance, but dip your nares into this one and a tropical hop explosion goes off in your senses. Think dank mary jane, tropical fruit notes (mango/passionfruit), and grapefruit peel with just raw hops a bit of biscuit toned pils malt for a touch of perceived sweetness. Dry purely raucous hop expression, bitterness leaves resinous oils on the palate, hops are just tattooed on the palate light brush of biscuit malts, but this is a true hop monster. Only 55 IBUs but I perceive more hop flavor and bitterness than many maltier DIPAs that report 100 IBUs. Carbonation is perfect dead on, one of the best IPLs I've come across thus far in the beer journeys. Sign me up for a case of hops!!! Citra Mantra!!!","WVbeergeek","Mar 04, 2014"

Bottle clearly says it is unfiltered so the haze is expected. Pillowy white head, some light sheeting, good retention. Looks like a lager. The aroma is stand out. Great pop of citra hops, orange zest, lemon, grapefruit, that sorta thing. The hops really pop out of the glass. There is also a lovely and welcome lager-esque quality arriving in the form of a hint of sulfur on the nose, these aromas play well together surprisingly. Its funny I did not notice this lager quality in the first bottle I drank several days ago. Taste: the malt part of the taste is cracker like. Hops are nice, bitter at first creating a welcome bite and then a flavorful wave of well citrus fruits of course. I enjoy the fact that the beer is so hoppy without that cloying hop sticky resin thing. The beer is dry and thirst quenching with a lingering bitterness. Good carbonation. Overall this beer is going to be in my regular rotation. This is just the type of beer I love, better then the sum of its parts for sure. Full of flavor, dry and crisp, and with a moderate alcohol level allowing you to enjoy more than one.","pmlondrigan","Mar 03, 2014"

Citra is good choice of hops for a beer like this due to its parentage (Hallertauer Mittlefuh, US Tettanger) as it provides melon, tropical fruit, citrus as well as herbal character. Aroma is a little sulfury, fruity, and herbal (cat tails). Sweet haylike and melon flavor upfront, biscuity middle, and a lingering dry/bitter finish. Seems a littel disjointed at first, but the more you drink the better the balance becomes and a single theme develops.

Fine carbonation is appreciated at first sip, which contributes greatly to the drinkability as the flavors are not as inviting as the aroma. Cereal malt gives it a medium body. As I drink more of this I do get more flavors, while subtle, of grass, mango, pineapple, and lemon oil. Still, they get knocked out by hop bitterness, and I like it a lot! I would not recommend this for the uninitiated, but I'm really enjoying the juxtaposition of biting bitterness and smoothness.

However, I can't say for sure what Otter Creek was going for here. If they were going for a more balanced approach, they succeeded. But if they were trying to showcase citra hops over a simple malt backbone, then they could have turned up the late addition hops more. I feel that when brewers choose to use Citra, they typically want to showcase it because geeks love it. It's rare that I find Citra in a balanced beer. But kudos to Otter Creek if that's what they were going for....balance is underrated and welcome...even to this hop head.

Taste is really quite nice - sweet citrus followed by rind, yeast and a pleasant, herbal bittering at the finish. Mouthfeel is light and bright with a lively carbonation and a slight astringency.

However, they eventually come through and bring a nice harmony.

4.12,3,4.5,4.25,4,4.25,4,"Overall - It is good and I'm loving Otter Creek's efforts lately, but I have to say that this doesn't hold a candle to the kings of lagering, Jack's Abby. With this much Citra i feel they should have added more malt body to even it out and boost the abv a bit, it would have resulted in a more well-rounded brew. It takes finesse but I'm confident that they will tweak it over time to make it better. I'd still recommend this because it's different and different is good!","JMScowcroft","Jan 18, 2014"

4.13,3.3,4.25,4.25,4,4,4.25,"Pours a pale yellow/light copper color, not too much sediment with a nice foamy head. Smell is almost completely of citra hops with a very faint lager yeast in the distance, however what else would you expect? Taste is certainly strongly represented by the citra hop and not a whole lot else. Not very malty to speak of nor too bitter, and slightly missing the lager aspects. Good and light mouthfeel as the citra hops don't at all overwhelm the palate. In a way it reminded me of All Day IPA, yet distinct in its own right. I think the Lager components could be improved, however I wouldn't call this OCB'S strong suit by any stretch. As with OCB'S past few new brews, I enjoyed this brew from the self acclaimed Brewmasater MIke and I would certainly try it again if offered.","80x2HopHead","Jan 14, 2014"
