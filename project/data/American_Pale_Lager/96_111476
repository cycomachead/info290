3.52,6,3.75,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Poured from bottle. Pale gold and clear with fairly good lacing. Aroma is light and fresh, florals and some lemon citrus, also a fairly nice crisp maltiness. Taste starts with some bready malts and light floral hops, crisp lager yeast, and a fairly subdued hoppiness, gets a bit tired near the finish, some stale skunky notes. Mouthfeel is light, lots of carbonation, and overall its some and easily sessionable. A decent IPL that gets a fairly boring quickly but works decently as a session option. Hops are mostly floral, with a bit of a fruity edge, and are decently robust.","mick303","Mar 23, 2015"

Aroma is mostly grapefruit, pineapple & hints of pine in terms of hops; pound cake and  little caramel malt in a background of pilsner yeast. Taste  is bready, lemon zest, resinous pine, tropical fruit, lager yeast & a little honey up front through mid-sip, finishes with a prominent grapefruit note becoming drier & more bitter with a rapidly diminishing bitter, but noticeably astringent, aftertaste. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with low moderate carbonation, silky & slightly creamy with a tongue coating bitterness that becomes an astringency on the back of the tongue & palate. Not really an IPA as it is made with lager rather than ale yeast. An interesting mixture of hops & yeast as are most of these IPLs.","mothmanscott","Feb 04, 2015"

Pours slightly hazy golden orange color with a 1 finger dense and rocky off white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of lemon zest, orange peel, pine, honey, cracker, biscuit, herbal, floral, grass, light pepper, and herbal/grassy earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance of citrus/pine hops and moderate bready malt notes; with solid strength. Taste of lemon zest, orange peel, pine, honey, cracker, biscuit, herbal, floral, grass, and herbal/grassy earthiness. Fair amount of pine/grassy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of lemon zest, orange peel, pine, honey, cracker, biscuit, and herbal/grassy earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Nice balance and robustness of citrus/pine hops and bready malt flavors; with a good malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Nice clean lager flavor with minimal yeast esters present. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth and fairly crisp/sticky mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very solid IPL style. Good robustness and balance of citrus/pine hops and bready malt flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A nicely enjoyable offering.","superspak","Nov 07, 2014"

3.44,3.6,,,,,,"Pours a dark amber almost brown with a cream colored head that fizzes away pretty quickly. The smell is full of floral notes but there is a little bit of caramel from the malt. The taste is hop forward in the beginning and then mellows out to a refreshing finish with a sweet aftertaste. The mouthfeel was nice as well. A bit average on all fronts but a nice beer none the less.","WhiteHillsStore","Sep 22, 2014"

3.4,2.4,,,,,,"new summer seasonal is probably underrated here, its pretty nice on tap, and while obviously a step or two below the quality of say a jacks abby ipl, I think its a pretty reasonable take on the style. darker than most lagers, deep honey colored and a little hazy. head is tall and frothy in my pint glass, it looks real nice. nose is generic but hoppy like an ipa, they certainly didn't short cut the india part of this. some bittering citrus peel notes to the finish but mostly sappy bitterness, lots of texture for a lager, which I like a lot. well carbonated and refreshing, but not finishing up as quick as other lagers. the hops outlast the attempted quick finish, it doesn't work out real well, but it doesn't affect the overall enjoyment of this beer, just makes it feel more like an ipa. not sure why all the negative feedback on magic hat lately, I think they still do a really good job with a lot of their beer, and have enjoyed most of the new releases...","StonedTrippin","Aug 16, 2014"

There is some richness to this brew in this smell.Not too big on the smell of this brew. Dream Machine taste is ok with a bitter after taste of hops. The taste at first is smooth but it is over powered by bitterness. The bitterness to this brew is to much for my taste. Mouthfeel is nice at first but, bitter at the end.

3.5,5.4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Quite lagery in flavor and body, has some component that is reminding me of using flaked corn in the grist in that there's a consistently sweet element in a beer that's really pretty dry. Body is fairly light and refreshing, with a sweet finish. Possibly a touch of diacetyl present. Hoppiness is pretty pronounced but not quite to the scale of any given modern American IPA; it's more like a crisp pale ale. An interesting choice, not really similar to other IPL's I've had.","AlCaponeJunior","Jun 16, 2014"

This didn't have the best drinkability, it was fairly smooth, a little clean, crisp, not too filling and the taste didn't do a good job at holding my attention, one is a little more than enough for me, no way I would want to drink another one in a row. What I liked the most about this beer was the appearance, aroma and mouthfeel, those were the highlights of this beer and they seemed to all be pretty true to style. What I liked the least about this beer was the taste, it was just bland all around and this is the first time in awhile that I have had a beer that didn't have any aftertaste. I wouldn't buy this beer again and I wouldn't recommend trying it either, it's priced nicely but it isn't a great example of the style. All in all I didn't like this beer, it had some nice aspects, but I thought the taste was a let down and it just didn't deliver what I wanted it too. So far this is one my least favorite beers from Magic Hat and there's not doubt that it is now my least favorite IPL or hoppy Lager. Better luck next time guys, this beer need some major work in the taste department.","StoutHunter","0"

They know how to engineer their beers in Vermont, I'll tell you. Nose smelled much like being on a working farm and not in a bad way. The malts were prevalent, very fresh and grainy and the hops provided a fresh-mown grassiness that put me in mind of summers at my grandparents' house. Color defined amber (SRM = >7, < 9) with NE-quality clarity. Mouthfeel was soft and full, a nice change from some of the abrasive AIPAs that I have been drinking of late. Taste was not really up to expectations, however. It had an odd finish of hydrogen peroxide, a taste that I remember from having contracted trench mouth from someone at summer camp. Gentian violet and hydrogen peroxide were the watchwords and I have never forgotten the tastes. Initially, it was okay, but the finish finished me off. Oof.","woodychandler","0"

3.35,0.9,3.5,3.5,3.25,3.5,3.25," The flavor is not what I expect from a beer that promotes itself as an India Pale Lager...it has the lager characteristics with smooth flavor but bitterness level is medium, a little like a highly hopped pilsner with toasted malt taste and noble accent as it finishes very clean. Overall it is a decent lager, but doesn't fit the India Pale lager label in my opinion, drinkable for what it is","Slatetank","Apr 11, 2014"

3.07,-7.5,3.75,3,3,3.25,3,"This dissapointing ale pours a handsome amber hue with a nice white head and lasting lacing. The nose is an overly sweet floral mix of hops, malt , and European yeast. The mouth is smooth and easy to drink but given the taste why would you want to. The flavor follows the nose with way too much sweetness and a floral hop bill that does not help the sweetness. I enjoyed the last few Magic Hat releases but this is definitely a miss.","lochef81","Beers"

Small streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, earth, and herbal hop aromas. Taste is much the same with earth and herbal hop flavors on the finish. There is a medium amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is an average beer that smells pretty good, but there is an odd metallic taste at first that only goes away as the beer warms up.","UCLABrewN84","Apr 05, 2014"
