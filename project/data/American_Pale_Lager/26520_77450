I think a typical Bud Light, Miller Light, or Coors Light drinker could pick one of these up on occasion and be happy with it. I'm giving the beer a B+ and an 87/100. Nice lager with a good hop hick.","ThomasMetal75","Feb 24, 2015"

4,3.1,4,4,4,4,4,"Got in a BIF from ZebraCakez. 12 ounce bottle into lager glass, no bottle dating. Pours lightly hazy bright golden color with a 1 finger dense white head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty lacing clings on the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation retaining the cap. Aromas of big grapefruit, lemon zest, orange peel, cracker, bread, herbal, floral, grass, light pine, and herbal/grassy earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance of bright citrus/floral hops and light-moderate pale malt notes; with good strength. Taste of grapefruit, lemon zest, orange peel, cracker, bread, herbal, floral, grass, light pine, and herbal/grassy earthiness. Light herbal/grassy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of grapefruit, lemon/orange zest, cracker, bread, and herbal/grassy earthiness for a short bit. Very nice balance of bright citrus/floral hops and light-moderate pale malt flavors; with a good malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. The finish has a good amount of dryness as well; and is very clean on lager flavor with zero yeast ester notes present. Medium carbonation and light-medium bodied; with a very smooth, crisp, and slightly bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with zero warming present after the finish as expected of 4.5%. Overall this is a damn nice pale lager style. All around great balance of bright citrus/floral hops and light-moderate pale malt flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Jan 23, 2015"

However, given the availability of cheaper session IPAs, if I want a hoppy, low ABV beer, I'll probably reach for one of those over this, as I find the lager style adds little to no obvious complexity to the beer, as the lager subtleties are drowned out by the hops in this one.","Beric","Oct 21, 2014"

3.73,-3.9,3.75,3.75,3.75,3.5,3.75,"On tap at New York Pizza. Pours a translucent dark golden color with an inch of head. Minimal lacing. The aroma is some lightly toasted malts with some citrus and grassy hops. The taste is more of the same. Bready malts mixed with some grassy hop bitterness. Some citrus near the end with floral and grassy hop notes. The finish is more of the malts with some light bitterness. Light mouthfeel and a bit watery. Very easy to drink and refreshing. This would be a solid canned session beer, but there are better options out there. Still good, though. Overall, not the best Jack's Abby has to offer but not a bad beer by any strech of the imagination.","PicoPapa","Jun 25, 2014"

Overall I consider this well above average for the style -very good hop flavor in a sessionable lager strength with a slight raw hop quality.","Slatetank","Jun 12, 2014"

I'd like to have more out of this beer but based on what they were going for I think they really did a great job. Light hop presence, small input from the lager yeast, moderate but light malts...how do I feel?

This is one of the three staples in Jack’s Abby Brewery’s year-round brews and rightfully so. At 4 and a half percent ABV, this is their “session” offering and compared to their heavy hitting Black Lager and India Pale Lager it sure seems that way but don’t be fooled into thinking this is just any old regular lager because it has the character to prove otherwise.","RummyRedbeard","May 24, 2013"

The nose is full of cereal malts which present a very bready dry malt profile. Light grassy hops follow and make for a nice balanced nose, especially considering the style. The taste is what you would expect given the aroma, dry grainy profile up front with mild sweetness next, finished by light earthy hop character. Flavors aren't overly huge, but they are present and well balanced. Mouthfeel is light and refreshing. Overall, this is a very nice take on a style that I otherwise am not a fan of.

4.41,13.7,4.25,4.5,4.5,4.25,4.25,"The beer pours a pink-tinted yellow-gold with a huge head on top that sits as just slightly off-white in color with some creamy and soapy bubbles. The beer’s body is really quite clean with a slow but steady flow of bubbles traveling to replenish the head. The beer’s lacing is fat and poofy, like little clouds leaving a patchwork on my glass. On the nose, the beer smells clean but surprisingly layered and nuanced for this style of beer. It smells like spicy wheat bread alongside light touches of citrus and pine. The spice in the smell actually reminds me of rye, which is odd but quite intriguing. The grainy wheat bread smell has lovely light nuances of caramel and cereal grains, which further add to the complexity of the smells. On the tongue, the beer’s taste follows the nose and adds to it with decadent cereal grain and wheat notes, and very light kiss of hops to balance the beer out. This is what a pale lager should taste like! The taste begins with a citrus pine bite that has you thinking IPA, but that is quickly gentled and washed away by sweet wheat flake flavors which blossom into caramelly and cereal flavors with a touch of succulent wood flavoring that mellows the sweet beautifully. Underneath everything the hop bitters continue to act as a beautiful stabilizer for this beer, while hardly effecting the flavor at all. The finish stays strong with the wheat flake flavoring, stepping beautifully into Kellog-zone while never getting too sweet, and remaining remarkably refreshing. The aftertaste is clean and light with tasty cereal and wheat notes. On the mouth, this beer feels lager clean, lager crisp, and lager refreshing. The beer’s body is light with just enough oomf to let you know you’re drinking something tasty. The wheat notes seem to add just a touch of syrupy body to the beer, which is lovely. After the beer leaves, the mouth is left clean with a light sheen of saliva that invites further sips. Overall this beer is amazingly tasty. I could knock this beer back all night and not feel bad. It’s sessionable and it’s tasty, which are not always the easiest things to marry together in a beer. Yet another success from Jack’s Abby; this beer’s flavors are sure to woo Ale fans, while its lager characteristics should appease even the acolytes of Bud-Heavy. Try this beer.","Maxwell","Jan 26, 2013"

Smell is of bready malt and some nice citrus and flowery hops, though the hops aren't nearly as overpowering in the smell as Hoponius Union. This one smells a lot more like a traditional lager. The taste follows the smell - it's exceptionally clean and crisp but has a finish that's a little more bitter than your typical lager. There's also a little bit of the fruitiness from the hops in the flavor, but it mixes very nicely with the graininess of the lager. Mouthfeel is light-bodied. Overall, I have to say that this is one of my favorite lagers out there and maybe even a notch above Dortmunder Gold (one of my favorites) for a session-type lager. It's a perfect summer beer and the hops give it a nice little extra bite that you don't find in most lagers, but it's far from overwhelming. If you're looking for something more traditional from Jack's Abby, this is the lager for you. Damn good.","starrdogg","Aug 30, 2012"

3.02,-22.2,3.5,3.25,2.75,3.75,2.75,"Gold in color with one finger of white head. When fresh, the aroma gives off a touch of leafy citric hops along side the very clean, dry malt. Faint corn. It's flavor is similar to the Aroma in that you notice notes of leafy hops up front which then gives way to slightly sweeter malts that taste fairly short and dry. Smooth, especially as it warmed up. Typically one might think a session lager works cold, almost like lawn mower beer, but the malt profile brings macros to mind when cold. When at room temperature, it's a bit more interesting and smoother. i just wish the malt backbone wasn't so generic. i wish it was either strictly a pils malt profile, or something a bit more malty (i really wish they had a full time pils in economical 6 packs). Overall, the hop notes are a real nice touch for a session brew like this, but when it isn't under 2 months old, it's a bit too boring characterless because after the hop touch, there isn't much else to get excited about. There are much better session beers out there.","jbertsch","Apr 19, 2012"

4.3,10.8,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"O: Amazing beer for the style. Simple and pretty light of course but wow, great balance with just a hint of hops, a touch of wheat and it's just perfectly smooth. Drinkability is off the scale. If Budweiser tasted like this, the craft beer movement never would have gotten off the ground. Another great beer from Jack's Abby.","Dope","Apr 06, 2012"

Very refreshing and drinkable.","jneiswender","Apr 04, 2012"

It is flavorful for a session beer, I'm just not a huge fan of the flavor on display... Perhaps it's because I'm not that huge of a wheat beer fan... Or perhaps this is just not my thing.

4.2,8.2,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Poured a 2.5"" white head with decent lifespan. The body is a clear straw yellow but with more radiance than typical. It smells a little of malt and a lot of citrusy piney hops, already much more to this than your typical lager. The taste flips with a little citrusy piney hops followed by a lot of malt. Nice long nutty lager finish. Dare to say this brewery claims to specialize in lagers and it shows, and yes I'm proud this is a local brewer to my state.","MoreThanWine","Mar 26, 2012"
