"Not bad for a pale light lager.  Clean and could go well with island cuisine as it has a bit of an edge and more flavor than a regular light lager.  Interesting brew from a brewery than makes solid, clean beers."
""
""
"Pale gold pour with white foam. Baked bread nose. Floral and slightly sweet. Lite mouthfeel. Ok lager."
""
""
""
""
""
"Refreshing beer but, has a little edge to it."
""
""
""
""

"Don't normally reach for a lager, but I really like this one."

"MIght have to taste this again, going off a 1/2 star rating on Untappd back in 2013, my tastes have changed.... I'll give it another go"
"Fantastic lager. I love it"
"Light taste and light in color.  Refreshing."
"This was actually a great lager. One of the best I remember having."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"My go to beer. I always eat this at Islands. This is a refreshing beer at its finest. One of the best lagers available. Crisp, tasteful, and it will make you happy."
""
""
"Overall: A very tasty beer, not very complex, but balanced. Refreshing."
""
""
"Could drink a whole bottle."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Easy drinking, cold and refreshing lager after a long day on the beach."
""
""
"O - This is a beer that I could easily drink on a warm day and enjoy.  Creaminess reminds me more of a Cream Ale (like Spotted Cow) than an Island Lager.  3.25/5"
""
""
"On tap and poured into a shaker pint. Clear yellow in color with no head thanks to the pour. Aroma is light malt, biscuit, grassy and floral hops. Taste is bread, grass, and grain. Medium body, thin texture, moderate to high carbonation, dry bitter finish."
""
"Overall : This was an impressive lager. I'd have it again."
""
""
""
"Light and refreshing - nothing more."
""
"Great beer and has that aloha taste with it :)"
""
""
"Reviewed from notes, this isn't altogether too bad for what it is. Little biscuity but otherwise very easy drinking."
""
"Imagine if any of the generic/popular watery beers had more flavor and smoothness, you get Longboard. Not bad if you're just looking for something light."
"Pours a pale yellow with lacey head.  Smell isn't very strong at all, very light yeast/wheat smell to it.  Taste is very crisp and smooth, no aftertaste, but pretty light.  Very drinkable but a little flat tasting.  Not bad, not great."
""
""
"Very thin and translucent pale yellow.  Smell is mild, and barely noticable.  Great light and crisp flavor, no aftertaste and a smooth overall taste.  A perfect thirst quencher, not filling."
"O: reasonably good representation of the style; refreshing, but a little boring;"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Very impressed at how smooth and great tasting this beer was."
"Brew pours clear straw-yellow in color with about a 1-finger foamy/fizzy white head that quickly settles down to just along the sides of the glass. A decent amount of sticky lacing is seen which is surprising. The aroma is hard to describe actually. Mostly of grains with maybe a hint of spice(?). The taste is pretty much like a lager would be but better than a Bud or other similar brews. Goes down easy with no bitterness. Lighter to medium bodied with good carbonation, hence all the bubbles rising from the bottom of the glass after the pour. Overall it wasn't that bad actually."
""
""
""
""
"Very good alternative to the macro lagers.  Satisfying & very clean beer."
""
"Looks and tastes like Budweiser. 3 bucks a 22 for bud is bad. Skip unless you are a pale lager guy. This just screams macro although it's craft."
""
""
""
""
""
"This is my favorite beer."
"One of my first loves, I still grab some of this from time to time."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pretty sweet for a lager but I still don't like lagers"
""
""
"Overall: Average. Nothing impressive. Just a typical lager."
""
""
"Ratings range from from 2.25 to 2.75. How is there an outlier"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O:  Standard lager with huge skunky/dank overtones,  overall flavor cannot overcome initial smell/tastw"
""
"This beer is pretty good."
""
""
"Solid beer, nothing great nothing terrible."
""
"Nice gold appearance. Standard lager smell with a bit of fruit in the nose. Tastes about the same with light bready malts, minimal hop flavor, and an Apple-like flavor. Refreshing. Drinkable."
"Great smooth taste!  My go-to beer."

"overpriced not very good"
""

"Pours a pale straw with a small head and not much retention. Aroma is of fruity esters, slight pear or apple to be elaborate. Taste is sweet and crisp with herbal and fruit notes."

"Rounded lager, although it has a low hop level, it has a fruity taste, even more than in most Kolsch beers I tasted. This is way better than most macro lagers."

"Really nice beer. Poured from a glass bottle into a Pint glass. Nice head, slightly small. Great taste, with a hint of hops at the end. Overall great beer to drink while relaxing or a night on the town."

"Longboard Island Lager brewed by Kona Brewing Co with an ABV of 4.6%  This brew pours out a nice clear amber color with a smell white head. The smell is rich with grains and malt. You pick up on some of the sweetness in this brew. The taste is bold with flavor and grains. This brew has a nice balance too it. there is nothing over powering in this brew. I like how this brew has flavor and it goes down smooth.  The mouthfeel is n ice also.  Overall I'm giving this brew a 4.25 out of 5. I will get this brew again."
" Overall a very solid 4 for Longboard Island Lager - Kona Brewing Co. It was 86 with over 50% humidity today here in my neck of the woods in Ohio, and this sure hit the spot. I'll probably buy this brew again."
""
""
""
""
"Very, very smooth beer and very drinkable on a hot day or night.  I generally loathe lighter beers but this is very enjoyable while being totally boring and bland at the same time.  But I can get it for the same price as bud / bud light at a local bar and it is infinitely more enjoyable."
""
""
""
"Pretty decent beer.  Pours a golden yellow with a slight white head that stays for a little bit before dissipating.  Smell is sweet and malty with a hint of tropical fruit.  Taste is crisp, good amount of carbonation.  Nothing extraordinary, but solid beer for a hot day."

"I was surprised at the complexity of this beer.  Poured out a pale yellow with a rich white head.  The smell was a good balance between sweet malt and hops with the malt dominating.  A very subtle blend of flavors that while I couldn't pick them all out they work well with each other.  The mouthfeel is very rich and creamy.  This is a good refreshing beer that is perfect for after finishing chores on a hot summer day."

"Pours a clear golden with a good head. Very good lacing and retention. Light nose of slightly sweet biscuit over subtle notes of tropical hops. Very nice medium body for a lager with a touch of creamy texture. Above average carbonation level that imparts a nice effervescent finish. The flavor profile is well balanced and also clean and crisp. It begins with a light biscuit sweetness that flows into a crisp effervescent light bitterness. Behind the bitterness is a light tropical tartness from the hops. The finish is crisp and effervesces into a slight dryness."

"Overall, not a bad American lager. Very light bodied, but packs enough flavor to be worth a try."
"A weak beer. Kona Brewing Co. is skimping on the malt. I will never buy another Kona brew again for the price they charge. Weak all the way around and through. A limp ass beer. Their IPA's are terrible. Nothing good to say about it. I'd rate it with bud lite and we all know how that tastes."

"Was not too impressed. This beer was given to me and I gave it a try. Yellow color with a head that fizzed out pretty quick. The smell was mostly malt although it was hard to find any really outspoken notes from the nose. The taste was very thin with more of a rice/wheat flavor than anything else. It was very crisp which made it decent to just drink in the summer but was forgettable overall."

"Appearance is a 3 only because I'm sipping straight from the bottle."
""
"Pretty sure this is better from the Kona brewery. Not a lot better, but it wouldn't take much."
""
""
""
"Decent Lager that's a cut above your average bud or miller.  It's cool, crisp, and has more flavor than what's out there.  Still, it's not super fine in taste compared to other high quality lagers I have, but it's not bad for something so available."
""
""
"Pours a slightly hazy pale gold with no head and some lacing. Nose is very bready with notes of heavy cereal grain and a hint of herbal hop character in the background. The taste is very similar. Light in flavor, mainly bready grains present which almost come through with a stale taste. Lager yeast comes through with a dry quality. Mouthfeel is light and moderately carbonated. Overall, this beer isn't that great. The breadiness gets in the way of the drinkability."

"This beer is a really really good beer. I have it every summer and usually year around. I recomend it to friends and family. It is not a heavy beer but it has a really good taste to it. The smell is really good as well. It is a refeeshing beer. Great to sit back with and relax after working al day, or after working outside in the yard."
""
""
""
""
"Picked this up as part of a mixed six from Ye Ole Spirits in Frederick because I had not ever had a Kona beer and I figured it was a good time to try them. Not much to look at, thin with not much color. Smell was again disappointing which now had me very pessimistic. And the taste followed. I gave it an okay because I did not mind drinking it but certainly not buy again. I guess if there was nothing else available I would drink again."
""
""
""
"Overall, this is a nice session pale lager well worthy of having with venison sausage, mmmm....my favorite with this."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall I really like this one. Has a nice hoppiness that balances the maltiness well. I am sure to get this one again."
""
""
"O) Decent brew... Good lawn mower, warm weather type beer."
""
"O: Not bad, but also not all that good. The best thing I can say about this lager is that it does not offend in any way. Still, it is just sort of lacking all around. Try this one at least once, but pick up a better lager when you're craving something bottom fermented and just about anything else is available."
""
""
"Overall: Good, solid beach beer. Hawaiian beer = beach beer. Smooth, unoffensive but at the same time nothing revolutionary. Not nearly as good as Fire Rock (I highly recommend) but pleasant. I'll buy this again in this summer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: When I reviewed Full Sail's Session Lager, I said that a pale lager (when done right) can be one of life's simple pleasures. This is such a beer: nothing to wow the senses, but a spectacular thirst quencher after doing some menial labor. I'll keep this one around occasionally for that reason."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: this is a very pleasant lager and seems to me closer in style to European pale lagers than American macros."
""
""
""
"In short, this is a good beer that I would love to drink again."
""
""
""
""
"Overall I thought this was a decent beer and a pretty close to average example of the style, it was very true to style and it had pretty much all the aspects that I would expect from a Lager, but it still was a little bland and it felt like it was missing a little bit of something. This beer had nice drinkability, it was smooth, clean, pretty crisp, a little refreshing, not filling and the taste didn't do the best job at holding my attention, I could probably drink more than a few of these, but I think the taste would start to loose my interest so one or two would be enough for me. What I like the most about this beer was the appearance and mouthfeel. to me those were the highlights of this beer and I thought they were both pretty true to style. What I liked the least about this beer was the aroma, it seemed just a little blander than the taste and I felt it was lacking something, but I don't know what that is. I don't think I would buy this beer again, there's a few Lagers that I enjoy much more than this one and I can't say I would recommend it unless your big a Lager fan. All in all I wasn't a big fan of this beer, it wasn't a bad beer by any means and it didn't have any off flavors or off aspects, but it fell pretty much right in the middle in every aspect and it wasn't too memorable. This isn't my favorite Lager and Big Wave Golden Ale is still my favorite beer from Kona, but I don't see how this Island Lager is any different from any other Lager. I appreciate the attempt but this one could use just a little bit of work, better luck next time guys."

"Overall, the type of summer beer that we all need in our beer diet no matter how much we all like extreme barrel aged imperial stouts...I'll always have a place in my heart for something this light easy going and flavorful."
""

"Pours clear and softly golden with a flourish of bubbles and a fat white head that falls to a thin layer on top. Nose has the scent of light grain and some cut grass. Hints of flaky biscuit in the nose and a subtle noble hop presence. Taste is surprisingly smooth. It's creamy and just rolls over the palate seemingly forever and without end. A touch of herbal and hop bitterness takes this one to the finish almost dry. The biscuit is doughy and the grains start to stand out on the palate toward the end. The carbonation is ample but it does not disturb the creamy smoothness of this beer. Overall I would call it earthy and a good and tasty lager. Mild overall and with a just enough hops to keep it interesting. My only criticism is that it's a bit too soft for a lager. The doughy quality starts as smoothness but then drinks a bit heavier towards the end of the glass. It had some kind of sweetness like almonds in the very last moments after it warmed."
""
"Overall: A good lager, light, smooth, nice taste. Could easily be a session beer."

"O: Decent sessionable beer, could drink this while soaking under the sun on the beach, I wish you weren't so far away Kaua'i! I'd recommend drinking on a hot summer day pretty refreshing brew. If you're looking for complex this isn't the beer, if you're lookin for a good beer to drink while hanging out by the pool or on the beach I'd recommend this to anyone."

"12 ounce bottle into lager glass, bottled on 12/4/2013. Pours slightly hazy very pale straw color with a 1 finger dense white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of lemon, pear, apple, white grape, bready grain, light honey, floral, herbal, grass, light pepper, and yeast earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance of hop, malt, and yeast ester notes; with solid strength. Taste of lemon, pear, apple, white grape, bready grain, light honey, grass, herbal, light pepper, and yeast earthiness. Light grainy tartness on the finish; with lingering notes of lemon, pear, apple, white grape, bready grain, light honey, herbal, grass, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a bit. Nice balance of malt, hop, and yeast ester flavors; with solid robustness and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and light-medium bodied; with a very smooth and crisp mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish as expected of 4.6%. Overall this is a good pale lager. Good balance and solid robustness of malt, hop, and yeast ester flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A pleasantly enjoyable offering."

"This is a truly outstanding lager beer which I will definitely keep in mind- especially on those special occasions after the warm months come. I bought this as part of a variety 12 pack for about 14 dollars at Three Bears Alaska (cheap!)."

"Pours a thin head on a clear golden colored body. The aroma is dry grain, a little grass and slight metallic taste. The taste is mildly bitter and grain dryness. The texture is crisp and fairly smooth with moderate carbonation. A fine drink for a typical lighter lager style."
""
""
""

"From a bottle into a goblet. Poured with very little foam. Color a solid but uninteresting straw yellow. Not much lacing. Went down okay, very little personality, very little to remember her by. I would note that there may have been something henky with the refrigerator - by the time I was in the middle of the glass, it had reached room temperature."

"Poured bottle into pint glass. Straw color, barely any head, not much aroma. Taste is pretty average for a lager. Mouthfeel was decent. Bought this as part of their variety 12-pack. I'd drink it again if someone offered but I won't go out of my way to make this my go-to lager. It's Fall as of this review, maybe I would be more into it if it was July and 90 degrees."

"Kona Brewing Longboard Island Lager ---3.5/5"
"Overall – Nothing too exceptional here. It is easy to drink, but overall a run of the mill lager."

"Pours a slightly hazy light gold with a quickly dissapating head that left no lacing on the sides of my glass. The nose was classic American adjuncts with a twist; corn and rice aromas with an earthy, minerally odor. Taste was more of a European that American lager taste; the clean dry bitterness of a Stella, mixed with an earthy, tea-like astringency that left a puckering sensation on my mouth. Somewhat unpleasant. Medium thin mouthfeel with a high carbonation level. A unique and interesting lager due to the earthiness in the flavor profile, but the mouth drying astringency is a major flaw that keeps me from reaching for more."
""
""
""
"This lager is very smooth. It can satisfy veteran beer enthusiasts as well as the relative newbie. For me, this is a very practical drinker. This beer won't knock your socks off, but will hopefully keep your shirt on. It has low ABV with a solid taste. Despite other great beers, I can enjoy not getting hammered by high ABVs. All in all, this brew delivers."
"A fairly average lager, quenches the thirst, probably pairs well with food, but nothing special. Smells really good but the taste is a little boring. For what it is, it's not bad though."
""
""
""
""
""
"*This beer picks up where Budweiser and Miller High Life/Coors left off. It let's you know that American lagers can actually have taste and character, but still be something that a macro beer drinker might appreciate. This a truly great lager!"
""
""
""
"Overall, this is a clean lager, fresh tasting lager. This would be a nice ""sessionable"" brew especially on a hot summer day."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a clear, gold color. 1/5 inch head of a white color. Slight retention and slight lacing. Smells of strong adjunct, hint of hop, hint of pale malt, and a hint of sweet malt. Very weak American Pale Lager, but decent American Adjunct Lager. Mouth feel is sharp and clean, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of slight pale malt, adjunct, hint of hop, and a hint of sweet malt. Overall, adjunct dominates both aroma and body."

"More malt than most, it's a very clean, easy drinking beer. Great on a hot day. The minerally character doesn't suit my palate."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - As lagers go, this fulfills a basic need. It it not above and beyond some American lagers, but comparable for sure. Nothing special, but also quite fulfilling if you are looking for a lager."

"Mouthfeel: Clean crisp and tasty are great ways to describe this beer."
""
""
""
"Got to give credit - lacing. It's got it, and not so bad a head either. The color is basic lager. Same goes for the smell. Faint grainy malt. This isn't winning points for the aroma. The taste is all you could hope for though... clean, easy on the palate, refreshing. You of course want to serve this cold, but it won't be awful at below freezing temperatures either. This is a well-made lager that feels great on the tongue in hot weather. I'm a fan."

"This beer pours a clear pale gold color. The head is a quarter inch in height, and recedes into nothing within seconds. The aroma has a faint hint of bready malt, and an even fainter hint of spicy hops. It is a very thin aroma. The taste luckily isn't as thin. It's nothing if not simple, but its bready malt character is quite pleasant. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with lively carbonation, and a smooth texture. Overall, this is a decent beer. I wouldn't seek it out, but I wouldn't refuse another either."

"O: In the the pale lager category it has much more flavor than most, but it still feels a bit thin. It was very drinkable on a warm spring day, but a bit more hop flavor would have realy made this shine in my opinion."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Above-average lager, very nice for summer. I has this on tap at Battery Park. It has a nice looking golden color, not too weak or lighter yellow like lesser lagers. Mouthfeel is nothing special, but also not overly carbonated. The taste is more hoppy than I've come to expect out of a lot of lagers, but is still refreshing and good for warmer weather. Very drinkable."

"Poured into a pilsner glass and developed a frothy white head which laced a bit and dicipated quickly. Appearance was a light gold to straw and clear. Aroma had grainy, citrus notes with a slight sour on the back. Tasted of grain and citrus, very light. Mild aftertase, cirtus, and dry on the back. Mouthfeel had some cream notes. Not bad overall."
""
"It doesn't look like much, and the malts are fusty when they could be more bready, but the body and the bite are right on point. Warm weather quencher. Superior version of a macro lager."
""
""
"Final Thoughts: Even though the flavor is nothing to get excited about, Longboard Island Lager isn't bad. It's just another example of brewing prowess being used for the wrong ends. Because the flavor is so naked there is nowhere for off-flavors to hide. And there are no off-flavors in this beer which is quite the accomplishment in my opinion. Would I drink it again? I suppose if I was looking for a beer to session and was boycotting BMC."

"thanks to my friend neal for this sample. pours extremely pale yellow with a rocky head that hangs around for nearly the entire glass. smell is sweet and ""beery"" with lots of malt and a bit of lemon. taste is extremely smooth...tasty sourdough bread with a hint of lemon hops. this beer practically drinks itself. i had it with a bag of barbeque chips, and it was a great midnight snack. mouthfeel is on the thick side, and i totally enjoyed this beer. could not find a freshness date, but it was well-made and made me want to find it in my area this summer....excellent grillin and chillin beer."

"Into a Pilsner glass, this brew poured a nice clear golden color with a 1/2"" white head that held to some degree for the whole serving. There was nice lacing down the glass as I enjoyed. The aroma was sweet malt with mild hops that were a little fruity and herbal. The initial taste was sweet malt, followed by herbal hops and some bitterness. This beer seemed on the full body side and was balanced nicely by the carbonation. All in all, I enjoyed this beer and wish more American lagers were like it."

"This seems like a better than average light lager though it's not what you'd call crisp. From the 12 oz bottle bought at Ralph's Supermarket in San Clemente."
"The feel is as crisp as one might expect from this type of beer, with a light, refreshing body and texture. It has the cleanness that is vital to a light beer."

"Poured this Pale Lager from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. Poured a clear yellow color, produced an average white head and retention and lacing were average. The aroma consisted of malted grain and pears. Light in body,a foundation of malted grain, white pepper spice and herbal hop bitterness. Smooth. Well balanced, impressive session beer, high marks within the style."

"I've enjoyed this beer while spending time in Hawaii. Coming back to review this brew. On tap at the crows nest in Santa Cruz. Served in a pint glass without head this pale yellow beer is clear and pretty bland looking. Aromas are clean pils malt with the slightest hint of spicy hops. More flavor than u would expect as this beer is heavier on the hops than your standard lager. Otherwise clean and crisp with just a hint of a bitter lingering finish. Easy to drink with a little character. A solid brew meant for sunshine. Easilly light struck be careful to keep in the shade."

"I had seen this beer around quite a bit but being on a budget i never bought it. I had a yard sale and someone gave me cash and a case of Longboard as a payment. I figured it was a fair trade!

"This pours a clear, pale goldenrod color with a slight, off-white head. The scent is of cheap, grassy grains. The taste and texture are rather thin, after all Hawaii is a warm climate year round. But what’s nice is this beer also delivers a decent taste while being lighter on the palette. Tastes a little like a German Pilsner. It’s easy drinking while delivering some good wheat and malt flavors, a pretty good beer for its style."

"Pours a pale, hazy yellow color that is not particularly attractive, nor is the faint fruity aroma. The modestly pleasant taste [3.25] is then better than expected. Light body with a semi-dry finish. A bit sweeter and fruitier, mainly citrus, than usual for style. That is OK, but too much corn in this."

"This poured out as a very pale looking yellow color. It has a white fizzy head on top. The a very minimal lacing and moderate retention. The smell of the beer is grainy with a very subtle hop aroma. The taste is light, grainy, malty, slightly spicy. The mouthfeel of the beer is light bodied, decent carbonation, a little watery though. Overall this beer is very drinkable, it's lighter than most lagers. It's not bad."
"Me and my boy D-Kwon was gonna go to this party by the beach. I told his ass to get a variety pack and he got the local kind. I was hype to have the seasonal but he gave me the longboard first. I took like three sips and was convinced it wuz a betta lager than most. Ya'll trippin if you say its bland. Its a lager and it crisp as a mofo, plus it got that hop finish."

"O - This is basically a BMC beer without the adjuncts. You can indeed taste that they used real malts here, but overall this beer is way to meek and mild for my tastes. Like drinking beer flavored water, I'm afraid."

The taste is mellow of malts with undertones of hop. The mouth feel is easy,smooth and very drinkable. Overall my taste buds got kinda bored with it, wanted something more, but this would be a good beer to drink on a hot day."

"The Crack revealed yet another beer that was happy to see me or at least to escape the CANfines of its vessel. I got an initial splash of foam, then it fizzed and refused to behave before finally calming down for the Glug. Oddy, I only produced a finger of bone-white head and even that was limited in its retention. A CANflicted beer! Color was liquid sunshine in the glass and with its NE-quality clarity, I wished that the sun were still shining as brightly as it had all day for comparison's sake. Nose smelled like lager, real lager, unadulterated, without corn or other adjuncts that have worn me thin. I may be in love! CAN I marry a beer? Oh, that's right - I CAN only rent them for short periods at a time. Mouthfeel was light, not downright thin, but kind of unobtrusive. It tasted like lager! It had a lightly sweet maltiness along with a mildly grassy hops presence on the tongue. It was super smooth and I had drank off easily half of the CANtents before I was even aware of how quickly it was going. Finish was semi-dry and I am marking it as a definite CANdidate for my beach cooler."

"-Overall 3.5: Really not bad at all. This beer is really good with food, too. I could see this as a refreshing and dependable session beer. Unfortunately, the price for this beer is insane: I paid $9+ for a six pack at a Wal-Mart in the Atlanta area. If you can get it for around $5 for a six pack, I would say, ""buy it."""

"O: Probably not fair to cast it as a Coors Light, but it tastes uninspired and ordinary. One plus, it's not heavy and would be easy to drink - but why would you want to? I can't recommend, but I wouldn't turn down a free one."

"Overall - This is a pretty good beer. Definitely would be great on a summer day. I first tried this beer when I was on vacation in Florida.."
""
"Pours a pale straw color with a brief appearance of a small, bright white head. Aroma of very light malt, some tropical fruit notes, and more than a little sulfur. Palate is crisp and clean, with a good balance of pilsner malt and mildly fruity hops, with a vaguely tropical note. I've had this a number of times without giving it a critical thought, but I guess I'll have to call it a serviceable, if unremarkable, lager."
""
"O: Not bad for a summer lager. Could def drink a few of these outside in the summer with some friends. Hawaii has done well here."

"O - I can appreciate a good pale lager, but this just isn't a good example. A shame, because I like Kona and Fire Rock."

"A clear golden yellow colored brew with a fair white head and weak lacing. The aroma is simple cereal grain with grassy/citrus hints of hops. The flavor brings more of a mellow malt and toffee, some caramel and even some grassy hints of chocolate. Pretty decent for a backyard sort of guzzler. It delivers a peppery effervescence in a light bodied brew. Not bad in comparison to your macro lager types. Some flavor, a bit of a pleasant surprise from the attractive can."
""
""
"It pours a nice clear golden color. Very fine head in the glass. The aroma every is subtle but every time takes me back to Hawaii. It hits on the nose just right. It is a very refreshing and easy to drink beer. You can easily put back several of these without realizing it. Overall, the first one of these was one of the most memorable beers I've ever had."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: If you are looking for a bracing lager rife with balancing hops and strong body, this is not the beer for you. It is a milder, smoother, and sweeter lager variety. Called an Island Lager, it is understandable why this lager might be sweeter rather than braced by strong hops: too many hops might not be as refreshing on the beach. This is pleasant and easy to drink, and it would wash down most food without taking away from the meal."
"I wouldn't mind having another of these, actually. Kona does a nice job."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a very refreshing lager. The malt is close to what I would expect from a pilsner, but there's a strong, lemony feel that adds a lighter, less hoppy character to this beer. It's very enjoyable."

""
""
""

"The flavors were the same as the scents, and were also fairly typical, although I did pick up a bit of skunkiness on the tongue. The was the average smooth thinness of the style. Drinkability was OK, but with the beer being generally boring, it wouldn't have much attraction for me. If you want a light beer to keep around as a ""lawnmower"" beer, this would be OK, but you could do better as well."
"Overall it doesn't seem worth it at 10.49 a six pack to invest in such an average lager."

"Light bodied with moderate carbonation, this beer is easy drinking and rather refreshing. The body is smooth and non-coatingand the carbonation is just barely prickly."

"Light yellow with a thin white head and minimal lacing. Aromas of corn and wheat. Taste is more of the same with some light fruity notes. Heavy wheat and corn aftertaste. Mouthfeel is medium and slightly carbonated. Not too bad for a lager and has good drinkability."

"O: Bought a bomber for three bucks and still feel like I payed too much. Not bad, just lacked flavor."

"Pours a clear golden color with a medium white head that disappears quickly. Scent is sweet honey with some grain and very mellow hops. Taste is moderately hoppy with a smooth malt edge. Sweet grain and wheat flavors. Nothing to complex, but easy drinking. Mouthfeel is light and smooth. Drinkability is high. Overall, this is a good example of an American lager. Very easy drinking."
""

"O: A very easy to drink beer and very sessionable. Though not one of my favorite styles, I really enjoyed this one. And I could not beat the price, a free one from the local bottle shop I frequent (due to difficulty in locating some inventory). I will definitely procure this one again when it is more widely available in my area."

"12oz bottle. Pours a pale yellow with a medium white head. Aroma and Taste of caramel malt, some grains, a bit of yeast and grassy note and slightly funky esters with some light hops.

"my first hawaiian beer on BA! pours a watered down yellow straw color with almost no head. my server didnt appear to be a pro, so this may be on her. smells a little fruity, trace amoutns of hops in the aroma, but all up smells like a lager. flavor is that of any standard lager, but this has an island style fruity crispness to it. i can see this being a decent warm weather beer. mouthfeel is alright, brisk and light, could use a bit more co2. too boring to keep me interested, but not a bad brew."

"Trying the Longboard Island Lager at the Jacksonville Airport whilst awaiting my flight home. The beer pours a golden clear with decent carbonation the forms a white head....bot however dissapate quickly and there was no lacing. The smell is primarily barley/grain. The taste has a zest of lemon that helps the taste of this beer. The mouthfeel is good, light in body...goood for sessioning and hot climate. Overall it is ok."

"Kona Longboard Lager: I have had a few mix ups lately. At a bar in an airport I ordered a Boulevard Ale, and for sure it was a wheat beer, probably the Leinenkugles they had on tap as well. So I passed on that beer review due to the uncertainty of what I was drinking. Back to the Longboard Lager. In the glass it has a straw yellow color with a faint cloudiness. The head is thin and pure white. Looking at this lager, I was thinking it sure looks like a wheat beer. The aroma added more fuel to that fire, as did the taste. Subtle sweetness and the hint of lemon and fruit that has me thinking it’s a wheat beer. I got the same result from the three remaining bottles I had. So could it be a bottling mistake? I cannot say. But to finish the review of what was in the bottles I sampled, I liked this light sweet beer, but is it a lager? Certainly not like any I have sampled to date."
"This was my first Hawaiian beer. Pretty good."
"Overall, this one isn't too bad. Easy enough to drink."
"Slightly above average for the style, but that really isn't saying much."
"Dr: Drinkable, decently priced, and average quality."
"Overall: This isn't going to knock your socks off - it's just an all around good American pale lager. I got no complaints. I would happily purchase this at a store or on-tap."
"Easy to drink and a good session beer."
"O: Solid lager. This is an decent upgrade from the macro beers out there."
"When I think of a beer, I think of the Budweisers and Coronas and that sort of stuff; the common beers you always see. Imagine if they were better quality. Thats what Island Lager drinks like to me. Its taking every aspect of a typical beer thats drunk in any situation and making it better. Its crisp, smooth, well-rounded. Its an everyman beer and its good at it."
"Overall, I'd buy this beer for a group of friends because it's different enough and drinkable."
"Overall it is a good beer on a hot day."
"Citrusy hop character on the front. Rough yeasty bite on the back. Clean taste, but not a refreshing lager. Body maybe a little over-done because the hops weren't the problem. The Big Wave Golden Ale was more satisfying for me. Kona is your best bet on the islands, but skip this selection."
"Overall it is an enjoyable beer but not one I would seek out again unless it's really fresh. $7.99 is a decent price and their bottled on date is clearly printed at the bottom of the lable which is always appreciated."
"In a shaker pint glass. Clear gold with a small white head and just spotty lacings. Smell like grain. Tastes like sweet malts with a slight bitterness to follow. The more I tasted this beer the more plisner like it became. Suspect some Euro hops. Checked the website and it lists Mt. Hood, Hallertau, and Czech Saaz hops. Nice mouthfeel with appropriate carbonation. Dry, slightly bitter finish. Excellent hot weather beer."
"Taste is fairly typical lager, though substantially more flavorful than most. Again, as with the aroma, I get yeast and crusty bread. Malty but not too simple or flat. This one proved crisp and refreshing, and among the better lagers I've had lately."
"Overall. Would be a nice beer for a hot day ...I'm thinking out on a golf course. Easy drinking and tastes great."
" This tastes as you would expect an American Lager would with some light malt flavor and very mild bitterness but it is refreshing flavor-wise and has a subtle fruit tinge in the yeast which gives a slight tangy residual flavor with an almost spicy effect from the expressive carbonation. This is a good example and it goes down easy with more flavor than most I would drink this again if given the opportunity."
"A good beer over all, but not good enough to make it stand out over other pale lagers."
"Overall, I found this brew to be quite smooth and would recommend this to anyone and especially keep this one for those hot summer days or warm climates."
"O – Straight forward and fairly mellow."
"a strong yellow pour with a thin, quickly disappearing lace... smells of straw and malt, touch sweet? a nice clean, crisp lager...a definite surprise, as I was not expecting it... nothing crazy in the mouth, but I could see how this would be a good BBQ or tailgatin' kinda beer.. Its easy drinking, doesn't necessarily kill your palate yet you can put down a few if you'd like. Normally, I'm not big on Lagers, but this one I could see trying again-"
"O: Meh. Typical pale lager. Nothing special but totally drinkable. Have no problem pounding a few."
"D - This is a very drinkable beer, however not impressive by any means. I would drink another, but will probably not seek this one out in the futre. Aloha!"
"Nothing spectacular about this beer, yet nothing incredibly annoying either. Poured a bright yellow with a small, frothy white head. Smell was of grass, slight tropical fruit and malt. Flavor was very clean, slightly earthy and malty but not much complexity. Mouthfeel was refreshing and average for the style. Nothing spectacular here but a solid Lager nonetheless."
"Feel is light bodied with very light carb going on. Not bitter. Kinda like lightly carbed water with lemon and malt. Not something I would go for again."

"O- There is something to be said for a refreshing and crisp lager during summer, but still Longboard has a tough time separating itself from the sea of average pale lagers."
"O: better than most apl's, unfortunately served in a large frosty schooner mug."
"Just Ok."
" Session beers that are light in hue don't get more full than this. The mouthfeel was the best part of this beer and the alcohol couldn't be tasted or detected. Even though the aroma wasn't there for this beer, everything else was up to snuff. Those looking for a clearer and more filling alternative to the Summer beers that are on the shelf now will be pleasantly surprised by this offering from Kona."
"Pours a slightly hazy light yellow with a 1 inch white head that fades to a thin film. Foamy rings occur on the drink down. Smell is of sweet grains and biscuit-like malt. Taste is of sweet grain, biscuit, and slight grassy flavors. Very slight bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp and clean mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty average lager that is neither that good or that bad."
"Pours a bright yellow color. Weirdly bright. Good white head with a bit of lacing on the way down. The nose carries a light amount of grain and some very faint hops. The flavor has mild grain and doesn't have much bready malt, as I've come to expect. It's more the body of a pilsner without the hops. Light body and good carbonation. Pretty good, though nothing too special."
"Not a bad beer good for the beach I guess."
"O: Easy enough to drink and rather refreshing after a day of work, sipped while relaxing on the back patio. Tasty, benign, doesn't sway me one way or the other, really. Wouldn't turn one down if offered more and I could see buying it for a summer get-together, to satisfy anyone looking for a clean, good-tasting pale lager."
"Just your basic pilsner/lager beer."
"Poured a light clear gold with very little head into a straight glass. Light straw and grass aroma, maybe a hint of fruit. Thin entry, not much initial taste, then a bit of a malt bang, and then that hint of sour-ish fruit. Is it papaya? pear? lemon? Drying and carbonated, a bit of popsicle stick lingers. A low side of average lager. Not up to the usual Kona quality but might hit the spot as a lawnmower beer."
"Boring, but what did you expect?"
"Poured on-tap and served in a pint glass, the beer is piss-yellow in color, with tons of carbonation and a thick, frothy, white head. Toasty and cinnamon smells, with bready characteristics. The flavors were muted and watery, with slight toasted oats and cinnamon spicing. The beer has light, lemon zested toasty aftertaste with a semisweet and slightly sour finish. Not ranking high on my list right now...could be worse, but there are much better in this style."
"Narrative: Tatum’s parents got divorced at age 8, they said it wasn’t his fault. He never got those Streetsharks action figures that he always wanted, he knew it wasn’t his fault. He got placed as a second string nose guard when he was a Senior on the football team, he convinced himself it wasn’t his fault. Somehow, this lackluster individual carried on day by day. He worked diligently at Blockbuster Video, until Netflix arrived and, that really wasn’t his fault either. Ultimately, Ohio’s economy had too many Tatum’s, too many Skylers, too many Aidens, Braydens, Jaydens, Haydens, Maydens, Raidens; but I digress. His strength was his utter lack of individuality. These days, when you get your auto insurance claim handled just appropriately enough, that was the sweet work of Tatum. Update: his job will soon be outsourced."
"Not a great beer but definitely a worthy alternative to your adjunct lagers, though the price will be a bit high since it's from Hawai'i."
"This is a very nice lager. I did not pour so I really cannot comment or judge the look and head. Overall a very hoppy nice lager with notes of citrus and popcorn. Easy drinker with a very easy going ABV. I like this line of beer,... Kona.... they produce some very complex flavors and taste for a fairly mainstream beer company. Enjoyed with some boating food and it was great! Enjoy!"
"Overall-What I expected from this beer. It's clean and slightly refreshing which is good, but brings nothing else to the table."
"A fine pale lager and summer time offering from Kona. Pours a light yellow color with a fair sized white head. Smell is bready with hints of citrus. Taste follows with smell, malty, bready, with a hint of citrus and a clean finish. This is an easy drinker, especially on a hot day. I enjoyed this lager, definitely a nice option and it's clear to see why it's Kona's mainstay."
"O - Yep, it is a lager. I can't complain about this one, but I can't rave about it either."
"Being under carbonated is somewhat of a turn off but this lager is one that really cranks up the bitterness of the hops to a point where it impacts how the brew is viewed, not intense hoppiness but noticable and sets it apart from a style in which it is easy to be bland."
"Very bland, with characters that may well enough be deemed offensive. A rather poor effort from this brewery, and not genuinely any better than similar offerings from BMC. If I'm ever in Hawaii looking for craft brew, I'll stick to Maui."
"Mouthfeel is smooth, fairly full-bodied for the style with a restrained effervescence. Even a touch of warming late. A very drinkable, enjoyable beer. More like a wheat than a mega lager, I am happy to add this to my short list of lagers I will pay for."
"Certainly an easy drinking lager. Good on a hot day."
"Nothing really special about it, highlight was it's faint tropical fruit notes. Other than that, pass."
"Pours a clear yellow, good sized foam. Aroma is lagery, alittle sweet grain. Taste is well rounded, crisp body and some bready malt sweetness and a slight citrus character. Quenching, rediculously easy to drink. Everything you would expect from an island lager."
"D: Very high, this is a very drinkable beer."
"This lager is very easy to drink. There is a sweetness to the malt which is pleasant. Feels like it would go well with Hawaiian food, with its sweet and sour and fish flavor profiles. Not a bad lager at all and good for hot weather (unlike San Diego when I was there)."
"A refreshing pale lager, perfect for a warm sunny day on the Hawaiian shores. Mild flavors won't get in the way of your meals and the drinkability factor leads me to believe I could tackle more than a few without slowing down."
"M/D: light bodied, crisp, not too smooth but not harsh either. Good drinkability if it wasn't for the weird aftertaste."
"not much head on this guy. it smells nice, bready with some light floral notes, almost smells kolsch-like. smooth malts, hops come in the finish with a crisp end, but over all this seems thick for a lager. easy drinking and tasty, but over all not blown away with this one."
" * The beer on the east coast is brewed in New Hampshire instead of Hawaii Im not sure how this effects the flavor etc.!"
"Had this beer on tap. There is not much head, but for a light ale it does not need it. There is a nice yellow clear look to it. It taste sweet with flavors of oranges, apricots, and light amount of hops. This is a great summer ale with a lot of flavor. This beer would be great to drink on the beach. Cheers"
"Drunkability: Not a bad brew, but also not super tasty. a refreshing summer drink. Could tear through some on a hot day."
"Drinkability - This brew definitely could be enjoyed while basking in the sun. Very easy to drink. A person could definitely pound a few of these with ease. Nothing fancy however. Rather straight forward."
"D. Despite being modest in all the above catagories this brew is a great session beer. I could keep a twelve in my fridge and it wouldn't last the night."
"Drinkability is good. Well suited to the climate in which it was created. This review was from a bottle, but fresh from the tap on a warm day in their Kona Pub it is hard to top."
"Cheers!!"
"Mouthfeel is light with a crisp amount of carbonation."
"Appearance: Pours a clear yellow gold, with a touch of cloudiness. Even with an aggressive pour, I was unable to get any sort of head to form. Aroma: Sweet summer corn, dry malts, and a little bit of bitter hop. Taste: Honey sweetness, light, dry buscuity malt, bitter, metallic hops, with a fruity, light hoppy finish. Mouthfeel: Full bodied, crisp."
"Very drinkable beer, but nothing that is going to blow you away."
"drinkability - not full on flavor but really a decent session beer, low enough alcohol to keep you going if you aren't bother by the taste"
"It's drinkable. Unfortunately, this is what American lagers have become. Truthfully it's not terrible."
"Pours almost clear with soda-like carbonation. Fizzy, light. More towards a mass produced adjunct than the promised handcrafted beer. Says on the label brewed in New Hampshire by Kona Brewery NH rather than HI. Three sips; drain pour. Life if too short to choke this down."
"Verdict: A decent but not too exciting lager from Kona. Doesn't near the quality of the Pale Ale I had a short week or so ago, but has some interesting qualities, like flakes in the brew. Appearance is off, flavors are pretty average and drinkability is decent, but this is probably a beer that I will be torn on returning to in the future. It doesn't quite work for me. C (2.95)"
"D- Very easy to drink. Good one for a hot day."
"Overall: A solid lager, just doesn't wow me in any way, nor does it disappoint me."
"A really solid offering from Kona. This a flavorful and tasty lager. It pours a light gold color with moderate carbonation. No adjuncts here and it shows. The flavor is full and somewhat complex. It is light bodied and has medium carbonation. Kona certainly does the lager style justice here, and I would highly recommend this to anyone."
"No real flaws with this beer, but at the same time it's not very exciting."
"D- Better than your average American Pale Lager. I actually rather enjoyed it and could see it as a very approachable and sessionable beer."
"A very nice drinkable lager for when doing yardwork..."
"D-mmm this is an enjoyable beer! i could have lots of this! the taste stays through out the experience."
"D: An uninteresting and overpriced brew."
"Pours a transparent gold color with a one finger white head that leaves some traces on the glass after it dissipates. Smells of grain, sort of a pilsner smell. Taste is pretty easy going but enjoyable, certainly more flavor than most lagers and good flavor at that, but it doesn't knock your socks off. This would be a great beer to slowly ease a friend into craft beer. Taste is crisp with a emphasis on some hops. Body is light and carbonation is medium/high. Overall this is a decent beer, there is nothing offensive about it, but unlike BMC headliners it has a definite and strong flavor. The good flavor and low ABV make this very sessionable."
"Overall: A good option when faced with few alternatives. I had this at a place where my only other options were BMC, Sam Adams, or Harpoon IPA. I'll gladly take this one over those options, especially out for a night on the town. However, I'm not to sure this is going to be one I pick up a sixer off at the store, but that is more due to my style preferences than the quality of this brew."
"d: This beer reminds me of a better tasting Landshark Lager. A good summer beer that's easy to drink but nothing really special or unique about it"
"Taste, light, tiny bit of enjoyable sweetness. Biscuity. Hoppier than most lagers, thats for sure. An easy drinker, but not necessarily worth $8+ a 6 pack given that there isn't a whole lot going on, you're prolly paying a little bit of that just for transportation. Buy some of their porter instead."
"Light body, good mouthfeel and carbonation, very refreshing. Excellent island beer."
"This is a great beer if you're looking for something for refreshment. Probably one of the most refreshing beers I've ever had."
"Drinkability: An extremely drinkable lager and one that stands out from most of the other lagers I've tried. I certainly wouldn't mind having this one again sometime."
"Very impressive, a bigger body than we expected, but that's not a bad thing as it stays very drinkable bottle to bottle. Just more proof that brewing lagers is worth the effort."
"Mouthfeel is light bodied, seemingly fit for warm weather but ultimately unexciting to me."
"Light in color, very similar to their Duke's Blonde Ale. This beer actually has a significant amount of flavor for an American lager. Nice malt flavor with a slightly wheaty aftertaste, very pleasant actually. Aroma is also light, but pleasant. Overall, a nice beer, nothing awesome, but I would probably drink it again."
"Overall, it's actually a pretty good lager for the price ($6.50 6-pack brown glass longneck). I will enjoy putting these down, especially over the other crummy beers that Fresh & Easy has been hawking these days."
"I'll stomach through the 6-pack with some pizza, but I won't be buying it again."
"this is a decent lager, reminds me a bit of Harp only not as sweet. very easy to drink, i had no issues putting down 4 last night. this is a great island lager. hawaii rules."
"Drinkability: This brew clearly won over the pale ale, there is a nice malty backbone and there are few flaws that you'd expect from an American Pale Lager. Overall I liked this one and I took a bunch down to the fishing hole the next day to sip away at."
"D: Maltier, better balanced, and more interesting than a macro, but equally appropriate as a lawnmower beer."
"the pour is golden with a mild carbonation that was sort of disappointing. didn't really hold too well and the head feel apart before even starting. this beer was basic. i give it a plus for not taking like cereal. it has a grain quality to it... and some mild lemon grass. but mostly husk. and the feel was terrible. didn't even finish."
"Drinks: it's still a lager, but infinitely more drinkable than the next one."
"D: Not bad, not great. Pretty run-of-the-mill drinkable lager."
"D - I could put these down while sitting on the beach no problem. It's a drinkable summer beer but not something with a lot of flavor going on. A good lawn-mower beer though."
"D: This is a decent, drinkable lager. Nothing really stands out, but a few of these hit the spot on a hot afternoon."
"M/D: Crisp and drinkable, chuggable. Not bad, but not anything spectacular."
"I had a few of these on board and they provided a moderately good experience while sailing out from the Maui coastline into the open ocean. Something I'd have again if given the chance, but not something I'd go out of my way for. Maybe the next time I'm in Hawaii."
"D- Very drinkable like most light beers would be. This beer is a step up for BMC fans"
"Drinkability: I was not impresed by this at all. Even if it is miscategorized (I think it should be an adjunct lager), I'd rather have Bud original."
"Smells and tastes a lot spicier and dryer than, say, Bud Heavy. The aroma is intense enough and interesting enough that I had some medium-high hopes for the flavor, but all there is is some mild dryness and basic pale barley. No adjunct, but some corn or rice might have actually been a little nice, given the dryness something to play with."
"D: A basic no-frills summer thirst-quencher. I was dying of thirst when I drank this, and it hit the spot quite well. I'd say it's a small step above Yuengling in the pantheon of widely available pale lagers."
"M/D - Mouthfelel is smooth with a crispiness in the mouth. Very drinkable and an excellent replacement for BMC if you were in Hawaii"
"Mouthfeel is sparkling and good for the style. And this goes down quite well. Certainly a good ""bridge"" into micros for people who drink the corn lagers of the world."
"Easy drinker with low alcohol and pleasant taste."
"Overall: Overall the beer wasnt very good. I dont really like pale lagers, so maybe it's me, but I wasnt much of a fan of this beer. I wouldnt drink this beer again. I think Kona has some better beers out there."
"As rated per style, this is a beer for beer lovers, not so much for beer geeks."
"Drinkability: Nothing too special here, but this could be a good beer for a day at the beach. This wouldn't be my first choice, but I'd be willing to drink it again."
"D: On a hot day I can suck this down no problem. It isn't a beer to rave over, but it does the job for the style well. If I saw it on sale, I'd pick it up on a whim."
"D: smooth, went well with my lamb burger but don't plan on a second round."
"1255"
"Taste is faint, a tiny bit of hops, but I really get a lot of wheat in there. This wouldn't score well as a white ale either, but it isnt bad. Its very drinkable, and very very light."
"The beer pours a slightly hazy light yellow color with a white head. The aroma is heavy on the corn and wheat. Not very appetizing. The flavor is wheat and corn with some grassy and earthy hop notes. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. Kona makes some good beers, but this is not one of them."
"D: This is was an average beer, albeit better than typical Adjunct beers, I wouldn't seek it out, but may opt for better beers if given the opportunity to have again."
"D: The beer is relatively easy to drink but nothing really stands out in the taste to make me want to try this again."
"Look, this is a average Lager. However, its Super drinkible and actually has some nice flavor. Its malty with a nice crisp finish. The aroma is nothing special, a little malty and corny. But the mouthfeel is smooth, and on a hot day, these go down very nice. Plus I thought the price I found them at in Mass,(8.99 a sixer)was pretty good since they came all the way from Hawaii. I would buy again."
"Fortunately the taste is better than the aroma. Its a little bland, nice carbonation on the palate, mild nearly non-existant sweetness on the front of the mouth, some grainy bitterness at the back. Its an OK lager, nothing special or unique, or worth going out of you way for."
"Overall, this is a below average lager at a premium price...no thanks."
"Certainly an easy, fairly enjoyable lager for a hot day."
"Drinkability: Went very well with crabcakes for dinner. Had two and could have had another."
"F: Finishes slightly bitter with just a hint of hops again. more crisp clean lager flavors, little banana, but otherwise pretty much gone."
"D: When you have SA Lager and all the domestics on tap, why bother putting arguably the worst Kona on tap? Eh, gambled and lost on this one. So it goes."
"The flavor is similar to a traditional macro: grainy with no hop flavor. It's crisp with a decent body for the style. No aftertaste. This is easy to drink but ultimately uninteresting."
"Drinkability: Although not complex, it's very crisp and refreshing. Truly a good brew to have after riding the waves."
"Drinkability: I like the subtle fruit tones to this and I might have this again on a hot day. Nothing I would rush to get, but it is better than most in its style."
"Maybe one step above macro swill. Though a very small step. I will avoid this from now on."
"Not complex, but not hard to put down a bunch of these either."
"Drinkability: I could easily grab a sixer of this on a warm day and enjoy myself. Not an overwhelming beer and it beats get Bud, Coors and any of that other crap out of the water buy a long shot for a warm weather beer."
"Taste is grain, apple, wet grass, with a long cracker/cereal aftertaste. It has faint bitterness and sweetness. The feel is a bit heavy and full for the style, but uninteresting. It doesn't have enough interest or character to warrant the full, heavy feel for me."
"I'll get this again on a hot day, but probably not with dinner."
"D - Simple... A slight step up from most BMC offerings... I would turn my nose at up if offered again in the future, but I dread the scenario where this would be my first choice..."
"Overall, this is a great beer. I dare anyone to find another lager of this style that is as pure and yet, on so many levels, so rich. If I were more of a lager drinker, this would be a must have in my fridge at all times. Being the first Kona Island product I have tried, I look forward to sampling more of their lineup. Excellent brew!"
"Overall - A good beer, probably a better beer for a hot summer day or to bring to the beach but really it is a nice, high quality, lager."
"Poured a very slightly hazy straw color, with a lot of carbonation, two fingers of white head, and decent lacing. The smell was subtle grassy and hay bitterness; not much else to speak of. The taste confirmed this, with a dry bitter finish. The mouthfeel was thin and somewhat overly carbonated; almost like this brewery's answer to a Bud Light. However, if I was stuck at a party with light brews, I most certainly would session this over any mainstream commercial offering."
"12 ounce bottle, on a recent trip to Hawaii a buddy brought some island brews for me. Served in a Sam Adams BL glass, the beer pours a slightly hazy pale straw gold color with about a half inch white head. Head retention and lacing are both decent. Not much to the aroma, it smells like grain and some lemon and grassy hops. Taste is similar to the aroma, but the flavors are stronger than the aroma would lead you to believe. Mouthfeel/body is light, it has good carbonation and a nice crisp finish. Drinkability is good, it's easy and enjoyable to drink. For the style, it's not a bad brew. It would definitely be good on a hot day."
"Drinkability etc..An all around easy drinking lager, this is a real American Lager. Light yet still very flavorful, a very decent beer."
"Overall, a good pale lager that would be a good session beer if just wanted to drink something lighter with some flavor. Good for sharing with non-craft friends at a cookout or party. Recommend. Rotation - available here in TX. Probably good for a 6 pack or two a year in the summer."
"Drinkability: Not a lot going on here, but very smooth and easy to drink. Very nice on a warm day."
"D: Probably the category that this beer excels... very drinkable, but what lagers aren't? I don't think I'd look to buy this one again, but it wasn't bad either. Definitely nothing to write home about."
"Light and clean on the feel, drinkable as an American Pale Lager should be. Nothing bad about this beer, certainly wouldn't turn one down, but I don't see myself seeking this out again. This style as a whole is a little odd to me, much better than an adjunct lager but short of a good Pilsener. Nine times out of ten I'll go Pils before turning to a beer like this but it's still a fine example of what it is."
"This is an easily consumable beer and well worth the experience. Longboard could easily fit into any summer experience. It is probably best without food."
"Best of luck in your endeavours. Cheers."
"Enjoy a Kona Longboard!"
"Poured into a pilsner glass by the restaurant. The color was a little green but otherwise golden. The head was thin with a little retention and a little lacing. The smell is simple; just a little hoppiness and a good amount of malt and the taste is equally simple. Its smooth, light in body and fairly easy to drink making it a good session beer."
"D - Light, easy going lager. Nice session as it is pretty easy to drink, albeit possibly boring."
"The beer is very easy to drink and goes down quite effortlessly. Well made example of the style I think, not complex but not quite boring either. May get a little sweet after a few bottles."
"Good mouth feel taste doesn't linger too long and it goes down easy. Very good gateway beer pretty thin and light bodied. Wouldn't seek this beer out but a few steps above most american lagers."
"Pours a clear golden color with high carbonation observable, yet no head formation. Aroma is mild with notes of crystal malt and a bit of bread. Reminds me of natural light. Flavor is light as well with rice and corn detectable not unlike Budweiser. There is also a sourness that lingers into the finish along with a bit of a metallic taste. Body is medium and smooth, the most likable aspect of this beer to me. Overall, this is an easy beer to drink, maybe refreshing after mowing the lawn, but not very enticing."
"Drinkability: this beer does not blow me away. There are pale lagers out there I'd much prefer to drink in session."
"M/D - Pretty drinkable lager, very smooth no real hop or malt bite, my third beer from Kona. Good brew to be had. Not sure I would seek it out but if I were on the islands I would indulge in the local brew."
"Overall it is a good effort from Kona. It would make a great stepping stone from the standard BMC fare."
"Drinkability: for a lager I would have it again to support the kona brewing company but I seek more character in my brews. I would recommend this as an alternative to drinking BMC."
"D- This is a poor example of a Pale Lager. Granted I think I had a old bottle so I will re-review when I get my hands on another one."
"Mouth is light and crisp, easily drinkable on a hot day. I wouldn't think twice about draining a sixer in no time. Good and a total suprise considering its age."
"D-Drinks like water but not at all in a bad way very easy to drink and perfect for hot weather."
"D: a refreshing and flavorful brew for those hot days in the islands. first thought upon finishing a glass is how long will it take the bartender to pour another."
"Pours a clear pilsner and cream soda yellow. Very quick head and modest bubbling. The aroma is clean malts and grassy hops. Maybe just the faintest hint of pine cones. The taste is straight forward with dry pilsner malts, lightly toasted malt sweetness. Crisp and cleaning hops with a splash of astringency. Crisp and clean palate. The overall tone of this beer is simplicity. malty and enough hops to balance and sharpen the palate. No frills or bs. Just easy drinking."
"Overall is is better than a lot of American light lagers, but like most it ""pales"" in comparison to its European brethren."
"The beer appears clear gold with a short white head that leaves no lacing. There's a little DMS in the aroma, but the flavor is very clean with just a very light caramel note over toasted bread. I'm sure this would be a fine beer on the beach, otherwise it's still a nice step up from your average cheap, macro lager."
"Even though I am a heavy beer lover and definitely enjoy my over-hopped brews, this lager stands out to me because it is so easy to drink, and is not your basic macro brew. The taste is smooth and the finish is a little sweet, just what I would desire when sitting after a long day of work."
"Drinkability - high drinkability, very good."
"this is the first american lager style i've tried that hasn't been packed with adjuncts. my girlfriend picked this one up to try it, and i was surprised. i didn't expect much from something called a 'longboard island lager' i expected something watered down or masked with citrus, but it was quite tasty."
"(Some of this review is cross-posted on my blog.)"
"D - Yes this could be a great beer on a hot day...but there are other options out there...I would have liked more flavor and less macro taste...I'm glad I could have a beer from Hawaii!"
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is mild, some hints of malts. Taste is crisp and refreshing, some notes of malts and hops. Feels light in the mouth and has good drinkability. Overall this is a fine beer, especially on a hot day."
"Light bodied, moderate CO2. A drinker rather than a thinker. Nothing here is bad, but it is instantly forgotten."
" I'll admit I don't drink many lagers, and only do so when other choices aren't available, yet, this one is quite nice as it actually has some character. I like to notes of fruit and would drink this beer again!"
"d. a good beer for a nice hot days when you're eating outside. i will more than likely drink this one again."
"It pours a strong yellow orange color. It smells like sweet malts and alfalfa. The taste is not particularly pleasant. A generic malty bite dominates other ingredients in the lager but there is also another almost artificial and sweet syrupy taste. The taste ends with an ever so slight bitter aftertaste. Simply this beer doesn't do anything for me; it does not seem creative; it seems generic."
"Drinkability: Just not a style I care much for at all, though this beer brings some flavor, that is for sure"
"Taste - Decently smooth but crisp as well. Not overly crisp though or dry for that matter. Still not to bad but not too flavorful either."
"D-great beer with seafood, had with some Dungeoness crab--incredible!"
"Overall, this is one of those fine-for-its-style brews that isn't really bad, but its just in such a mediocre style that there's no point in really harping on about it. It's your standard pale copper color with a small head that dissolves fast. Nose is light fruity sweetness, some graininess, and the flavor is likewise. It's basically a BMC, but with a fancier bottle and slightly better everything. Not worth picking up again."
"From the 12 fl. oz. bottle that is marked 063009. Sampled on Aug 3, 2009 in warm, humid conditions. The pour is a bit and a bit straw yellow with almost no head, bubbly carbonation, and good clarity. There is definitely something akin to citrus in the aroma mixed in with a distant hint of sweet malts and hops. The mouthfeel runs about medium texture. It sports a spicy and tart taste with a little pineapple or lemon squeezed in. A good beer for tropical weather."
"drinkability: well suited for south florida summer afternoons, where consistently sultry outdoor temps require a refreshment with equal and opposite energy to renew the palate. translation: a fair lawnmower beer."
"Overall, just a step above the masses."
"This beer doesn't have any negatives as far as I can tell. I'm not saying it's the best thing you've ever tasted, but it may very well be one of the best lagers you'll ever drink."
"Beer pours nicely but the head quickly disappears with minimal lacing on the glass. Light golden color with medium carbonation and a faint, non impressive nose. The taste has hints of citrus finishing with slight hoppy flavors. Overall this is not a super impressive beer but if you're sitting on the beach in Hawaii with this beer in hand I don't think you'd be disappointed."
"Pours a four finger white head that fades quickly to a thin layer leaving some lace. Crystal clear, very pale amber color. Light-medium carbonation and light-medium bodied. Musty hoppy nose. Flavor is hay, honey and hints of hops. Good lawn mower beer. $1.75 for a 12oz bottle from Beverage Warehouse Winooski, VT. Bottled Apr 29, 09."
"for sure a nice one to take out to the beach when you want to be classy."
"drinkability: A great choice with limited selection. great summer session option."
"D) Very delicious. Definitely have another one."
"The truth is that i'm not a huge lager fan, but this one is quite nice. I could probably drink 4 or 5 before getting bored"
"Very drinkable and sessionable lager... I could drink these easily while grilling..."
"Overall, it went down pretty well. Only had one (a gift), and wish I had a 6 for the weekend. Not over-the-top great, but a decent fairly drinkable surprise. Worth a try if you can find it."
"Drinkability- pretty drinkable, enjoy it a lot, have had it a bit in the past"
"It one considers it to be a tropical island session beer, it's nearly perfect. Aloha."
"D: mildly exciting beer. Worth a try and full of summery dimensions. A pretty straightforward lager and notch above some others of its kind"
"Translucent light golden colors. A cooked corn but clean malt aroma. Tastes bring out some light grassy hops, and the mouthfeel is watery. There aren't too many residuals here, either. This and many other pale lagers would be a good beer to introduce to folks just entering the craft scene from BMC."
"D: I picture myself drinking this, instead of a Corona, on the beach. It works. It's definitely light enough to enjoy more than one per sitting. I'm glad I bought it."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Silky, soft, and seafoamy... the texture in the mouth is liquid perfection, beginning very smooth and quickly gaining subtle carbonation that just hangs right in there for the duration. A wonderfully simple, yet complex beer that needs to become available in North Jersey soon."
"D - Easy to toss back a sixer of these, taste is a bit thin after a few though"
"Delisch? Nope. Outstanding? Nope. Worth more than $7.00 per six pack? Not again. But it ain't bad and i didn't dislike any of it."
"Overall, it was a bit better than I expected and I would recommend this lager to most buyers."
"Mostly drinkable beer. This beer is contract brewed in Portsmouth, NH. Kudos to Kona for reducing their carbon footprint and bringing this beer to New England."
"Bottle poured into my pilsner glass. Pours a clear straw yellow with no head at all. No lacing either. Smells grassy with smacks of sour lemon in there as well. Mouthfeel is crisp and refreshing. Flavor is of lemon bread mixed in with the grassy character. Slight hop presence as it finishes just hintingly bitter. This is a very refreshing beer. When I'm in the mood for a good clean lager, I'll reach for this again. Recommend."
"Carbonation is spot on and this is a great thirst quencher on a nice day."
"Some sweet and slightly viscous lemon/orange up front with more neutral malts and some spice on the finish. Sweet and bready on the close. Good carbonation matches the body and yields a smooth feel and an easy drink. Drink is a bit limited however by the lack of defining characteristics of this beer, might get a little boring after a while."
"This is a great session brew and would pair nicely with a simply dressed field green salad on the pation, or hot dogs at the ballgame. I will be buying this again as the weather warms"
"Not a bad example of the style. Drinkable and all. Give it a shot if you like lagers."
"D: Pretty good. I prefer a beer of this style to be a tad bit drier and not so sweet on the aftertaste, but it wasn't offensive. Ice cold on a summer day, it would be a decent option."
"D - Your typical pale lager nothing really stands out with it making it hard for me to want another one a decent lawnmower beer though"
"I had this at a BBQ, poured a 12 ounce bottle into a standard pint glass. The beer pours a very pale yellow with a fizzy white head. The aroma is slightly sweet, but barely detectable. The flavor is sweet with a mild bitterness. The flavor profile does not have a lot of depth. The brew is light bodied, has adequete carbonation and is very quaffable. This brew is great for hot summer days and easy drinking, just do not look for any big flavors."
"D: pretty good i'd like to see what it tastes like on the beach in hawaii though"
"D - it goes down easy enough but it's nothing special."
"D: Very drinkable beer. I liked this one a lot, this is going to be a favorite of mine this summer for sure."
"Not too often that I see or hear of brews coming out of Hawaii, so there was a little posterity behind getting this one. It's a fairly average lager made a bit more interesting by the sweet and floral fruity all malt profile. Worth a try, but likely wouldn't buy again."
"Pours a crystal clear pale golden color with a smallish white head that dissipates to a cap. Smells of grain and sweet fruits like green apples with a hint of skunk. Taste is sweet and grainy with a hint of hops in the finish. Moderate carbonation, medium body, sticky/watery mouthfeel. Not a bad brew, but nothing remarkable either. I could see downing a few of these on a warm day, would be very sessionable."
"Drinkability/Final thoughts - Lots of malty, grainy, corn husk like flavors overall, but nicely balanced with lite citrus flavors and a nice toasty hop bitterness on the finish. What I didn't like is that the appearance was lacking, shortly after I poured it, it just kinda looked like it's just been sitting there. So I think I might have gotten an old one, Id say if it's old Id give it a B-, and if not, C+ range. Ill be sure to try again and update if there is a difference, but for now it's fairly decent."
"Overall, while it was nothing tremendous, I liked this beer and if I am in the mood for a lager I would look for this one again."
" The flavor is a clean and crisp feeling herbal-wheatieness with white rice, dried corn, peppery yeast,and dried grains. The snappy feel continues with a slightly smooth finish. simple, effective lager taste. Not huge complexity here, but it's very easy to drink."
"Overall the Longboard Lager was a great drink. Will continue to taste Kona Beers as long as I can find them in my area."
"Had this on tap at a local Italian eatery last night and honestly was pleasently surprised.Came in a standard pint glass a light to medium golden with some chill haze from the glass,a thinner but well retained head atop.Not much in the nose,a little sweetness and grain but really not much goin on.Was taken back a little by the herbal hop smack I got on the palate....really.Herbal with a firm toasty base that did fade after a few drinks but still the hop flavors were a pleasent surprise.Drinkable and firm in the mouth,a nice lager beer with food."
"12oz bottle from the local Hannaford. Pours a light straw yellow crystal clear body with a short lived half inch of off-white head. Smells somewhat bready and biscuity. Tastes sweet with some bready elements as well as an unexpected citric hoppiness supporting. Light bodied with moderate carbonation. Very easy drinker, even for the style. I'd definitely get this one again, either to have with macro-drinking friends or on a hot summer day. Good stuff."
"D: Very drinkable, this might be my new go-to lager. I'll be trying other brews from Kona soon."
"D: Tasty, goes down very easily, not filling at all, mild kick, good representation of style, this is a decent lighter beer to drink for a while but there are several others that I would choose first."
"I had this beer while on vacation in Florida. It was a perfect beer for a wram climate and Io was really glad that this was a available in the end."
"Longboard boasts a very pale yellow color with a wispy white head. The nose is herbal with a touch of citrus hops against a malt background. The taste is crisp, with crystal malts and an almost wheat-like lightness to it. Tiny hop bite in the finish. Light in body, and very appropriate for the beach or lawn in July but otherwise probably only mediocre."
"Review from 2 bottles purchased at the Davis Co-Op. Pours a thin yellow with not really much of a head. Smells of light malt, a hint of spiced hops. Apples and malt on the flavor, some grass, hint of rice that my only be in my imagination. Nice mild hop bite on the finish. Refreshing and drinkable. Also, now I know that ""Ono Kia'l ola"" means ""delicious lifeguard."""
"Poured a straw color with absolutely no head. Visible carbonation, but no head formed. Very clear. The aromas were of earthy, slighty skunky hops which overpowered a toasted malt scent. Nice muted earthy, floral hop flavor that transitions into a crisp not too bitter finish. The malts were toasted and tea-like in flavor, however the hops dominate this beer. I wasn't expecting too much from this beer, but I was surprised when it actually tasted really good. The mouthfeel is good, not too watery, good carbonation, and a smooth crisp finish. I could drink these all day."
"A friend of mine just literally gave me this beer right after opening it because he thought it was flat. I couldn't turn down a free beer and figured that he might have been right given that the package date was ~7 months prior to the tasting date. After pouring it into a glass and observing the carbonation, I figured that it would be alright to review this as is. I enjoyed the Kona brews when I was in Denver; this one was no different. It's not great, but I enjoy it for what it is given the style. The strong citrus/hop tones were interesting as far as I'm concerned. Try it if you get a chance. I'll likely review this again if i'm able to get my hands on one with a more recent packaging date."
"D: A nice, solid lager with clean flavors. Went well with my 1/3 pound turkey burger and fries."
"D: Very drinkable beer in a drinkable style that actually has some character."
"Drinkability- Very easy drinking and refreshing. Absence of adjunct flavors enough body and flavor to differentiate from macrolagers."
"D: Nothing horrible about this beer. If I ever had a reason to drink a lot of beers this would be one of my top choices. Won't get it to enjoy a beer."
"Not particularly the greatest beer, but very solid and one of my favorites believe it of not. I usually don't drink beer in a frosted glass, but for the Longboard, it is very good super cold. O.K. so, the color is average, like most lagers, not a lot of head but good longevity with the ring left on top. The smell wasn't very strong, just clean. The taste was clean and refreshing. Just a great beer to drink at the Kona Brew Pub at KoKo Marina on the back deck in the mid afternoon. Just a bit better than average in most aspects, but when drinking it, it is just great for some reason I can't explain."
"D) Not bad at all. I'd choose this over a standard Macro, but I don't feel the need to buy any more."
"Drinkability: You could drink a couple - not sure why you would want to though. Lawnmower/football beer. An average lager, but at least they didn't mess anything up. I can see someone loving this on vacation, then finding out it wasn't that special after discovering it at a bar or local store."
"d: Nothing wrong with this one."
"Drinkability: I'd drink this over BMC anyday."
"There are times when the best beer in the world is a good, drinkable thirst quenching lager, and this is a really solid one."
"Appearance is very clear yellow with a bright white head that faded fast and left a white film. Smells slightly of pears and rice. Taste pretty good but nothing special. This is a decent lager that I could drink a lot of on a hot summer day on the lake."
"6/3/5/3/11 (2.8/5)"
"Well, you could probably beer bong this one..."
"An unimpressive, boring lager from Kona. This beer was just a half step above the big macro adjunct lagers. It almost tasted of adjunct grains, itself, but I'll just chalk that up to the general lackluster flavor. There's a little bit of spiciness but it's oppressed by the bland pale malt. There is little aroma, at least served cold from the tap. I had this at a fairly random bar and would have chalked some of the flavor problems up to freshness, but I saw other people ordering it and there was a weekly happy hour special on it (actually, I guess that could go either way on what it says about the keg's freshness. At any rate, it's certainly a lager. I kept writing boring after taking notes on this beer. There are certainly better lagers out there, and there are definitely worse ones. I just can't think of a reason to ever try this one again short of a convergence of great need and extremely limited selection."
"Very drinkable, a perfect beer to enjoy a six-pack on the beach."
"Drinkability: Decent. I will say it certainly displays more malt and hop character than your basic macro lager."
"If anybody figures out how the BCS is fair, please let me know."
"Drinkable I guess if your into bland beer."
"Drinkability: A pleasant and flavorful lager. I'm liking Kona."
"Not much for head or lace which was odd because there are a lot bubbles in the body. A little line of lace does encircle the top. It has balanced aroma 50% hops bitterness and 50% malt sweetness. It has a crisp plain taste in all. The aftertaste is grassy and sweet. Light bodied with mellow carbonation."
"I heard from a local representative that they ""had this new beer from Hawai'i"" just in. So immediately thought Kona Brewing company and sure enough I was right. I was very pleasantly surprised as I had wanted to try their beer for a while. After my first one I would say it was alright. Not worth the whole hype in my opinion. It pours a nice light/straw brown and has the aroma of malt with little hops. Has a nice head but died quickly with little lace. It tastes like your average lager, couldn't really pick up on any different flavors. But I guess when you brew in Hawai'i you don't get much of a selection for exotic ingredients besides fruit. Worth the extra price for a one time shot."
"This beer is in abundance on tap at pretty much every bar I was at in Maui. Overall I enjoyed the beer and ordered it several times. The taste is apparant, but not too strong. Good for anyone that doesn't like their beer being too dark or too heavy. I even went to the extent to find where they distribute Kona Brewing in the bay area!"
"The mouthfeel is good, and this is a very drinkable lager. I am kind of a fan, and on the off chance that I was stuck somewhere with the choice of the Longborad, or some over produced american lagers, and light pilsners I would chose the longboard. Otherwise, Im good, and I will stick with the stouts, and pale ales America is becoming so good at brewing."
"Comments- I've been a fan of Kona beers since my first visit to the Big Island. Not my favorite offering from them, but true to style and drinkable."
"They redesigned the bottle to bring interest to it. I think it is a good beer to have while sitting around shooting bull with friends."
"Considering it made the several thousand mile journey to South Carolina and was then driven to Ohio it tasted very fresh. The smell left a bit to be desired, but this is one of the best tasting lagers I have had. The mouthfeel was reasonably thick for being a lager. I definitely thought to myself I could drink 3 or 4 more as I was finishing the one bottle I had. I would definitely have it again IF I see it again."
"Drinkability is good, and one of this beers strong suits. All in all, a flavorful lager that I have had quite a few times before. Above average, and sessionable."
"This beer was terribly disappointing. While cold it seemed fine enough, but the time it took to down a bowl of chili turned it into an only moderately drinkable bev. It's not like I'd never have it again, but it'd have to be ice-cold."
"Poured a golden hazy honey color with lots of bubbles.Nose is truly malty, grainy and some hops. Slightly effervescent taste, grain, slight hops and well..malts. Not a fan of this style but better than most attempts by the big breweries. I actually finished it and it was pretty good. Very good compared to the competitiona nd the drinkability was good."
"9/21 update: had a couple bottles tonight. still good, but wishing were crisper and slightly hoppier. carbonation seemed a little low, so second poured very carefully (better)."
"Could drink this with ease and woul again, but nothing too special."
"12oz brown bottle with a packaged on date of July 15, 08. Pours a medium straw yellow with a 2 finger head, OK longevity and OK lace. Nice honey, lemon and malt smells mixed with just a touch of hop floralness. Big honey and lemon flavors and good malt too. Nice hop bitterness in the aftertaste. Crisp, spritzy and fairly easy drinking. A nice beer."
"Overall: Within the class of Lagers this a really good beer and should be given a test drive by all interested parties."
"Conclusion: Tasted more like a pilsner, a good one at that (best one I had if it is). I don't think it is much of a all-malt lager. I'd say it is a pilsner. But whatever it is, you won't go wrong with this beer...trust me!"
"Nothing too great here but I was pretty impressed with the Kona Brewing Company on my trip to Maui. Pours a yellow color, some head, and a little bit of lacing. Pretty good flavor for a lager. Tastes like a typical lager except for a little lemon zing they put in there which I suppose makes it more appealing. Makes it a decent choice in the hot weather in Hawaii. A slight bitter aftertaste. I'd get it again but it ranks third out of the three beers I sampled from Kona."
"D - A nicely balanced light lager that is easily drinkable. The hops dominate the malt for a refreshing finish without becoming too intense for the style. Certainly not an exciting beer, but easy to drink and quite nice for what it is."
"Overall this is not a great lager. Not bad, but not great."
"Tastes like... heineken. That grassy, lemony, kinda flavor. It's not bad, just not what I'd prefer. Mouthfeel is pretty thin. This is refreshing, probably great on a super hot day. But overall I'd rather have a Brooklyn Lager."
"D - Not as good as others but slightly drinkable."
"Drinkability: For those malt-heads out there, this one is a no-brainier! Easily could drink these on the lanai or at the beach. Plus who doesn't love a beer company that puts Hawaiian words under the bottle caps (You get smarter by drinking Beer). Just fyi, I got: kIhA = Burp"
"The beer pours a nice gold color with a 1/4"" white head that quickly fades to spotty lacing. The aroma is decent. It has a pilsner malt scent that's a bit sweet smelling along with a faint hop aroma. It's dry with some Mexican lager yeast esters. The taste is decent as well. It has a smooth pilsner malt flavor that goes down easy and finishes clean with a lingering dryness. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium bodied beer with a little less than adequate carbonation. This is an above average lager when compared to the macros, but that's not saying much."
"Overall- A fantastic lager. I went into this expecting a typical macro style lager but was pleasantly surprised by this beer. Nice light beer with pleanty of flavor. I would love to be sitting on the beaches of Hawaii drinking this one!!"
"first beer from hawai'i, isn't half bad"
"I feel I have had better all-malt lagers. While any beer like this will go good on a hot summer day, may as well pick something that's a cleaner grain flavor."
"Poured a pale orange with a slight off white head. Smelled a bit of ripe bananas and malt. Tasted malty with some nice fruitiness and hops. Light bodied with fairly active carbonation. Not the best of the Kona bunch, but no big complaints here, as they now quality brews no matter the style."
"pours a slightly hazy golden color with a thin white head that disappears pretty quickly. the aroma has some characteristics of a belgian white, a little bit of spiciness, malt and hops there, same with the flavor reminds me of... well, something I wouldn't expect to find in the tropics, but the medium-full body and the tingly carbonation make it a pretty good beer."
"The head is low on this golden straw colored lager. The smell is sweet, lots of pale malt sweetness in there, a little husk and hoppiness. The taste is more of the same as the aroma, very malty for what it is with a pinch of the hops. No complex or off-flavors in ths brew, although fruit syrup is hinted at times. An above average pale lager, a step better than Michelob, and one I would revisit from time to time."
"It made sense after my friend reminded me that one of the most important ingredients in beer is water. Hawaii has very clean, pure water there. But they must've done something great to it to be one of only 3 lagers that I find interesting and enjoyable to drink."
"Appearing to be the slightest bit darker than most lagers, this brew shows that there is no fine carbonation upon pouring... all harsh. Smell is rather pleasant, with good hints of pilsner malts being used. Tastes good; not an exceptional standout, but easily drinkable with a meal. Mouthfeel leaves a bit to be desired, though if you're having it with a meal, it's forgotten. All in all, it's a nice beer to compliment a dinner, though not a huge standout."
"Thin-bodied and a touch of lightly-carbonated water. Blah. I'm comfortable pouring half of this one down the drain."
"12oz bottle bottle poured into a pint glass. the apperance is gold with a white head that dissolves quickly. the smell is not that impressive but not bad at all. The taste is crisp with a little bit of tropical fruit, pretty good. the mouthfeel is light and easy. Drinkabaility, there is something I like about this beer, it is easy drinking with a good clean taste, not to bad."
"What it breaks down to? This is an easy, no thinking required, sessionable beer. That certainly follows the style and I believe the goal of Kona. Longboard Lager could be the perfect gateway beer for those few with the mindset that bud light is the king of beer. I enjoyed mine after finishing up some work around the house and this hit the spot."
"I like any kind of hop bitterness, so i can definitely appreciate the flavor. But it's much too highly hopped for the style."
"Yeah, this is really great. Who knew? Picked up a 6-pack, hoping it would be enjoyable enough to serve as an everyday kick-back beer. And it sure is."
"Overall- Good on a hot 4th of July down here in Virginia Beach but otherwise I would avoid. Just to sweet and uninspiring."
"Had this out of a keg at the Mensa AG in Denver, Colorado. It comes out a nice dark amber with a fairly substantial head, better than most lagers. Aroma is nice and malty with a touch of hops. Flavor is strong and malty, and has a substantial hop component - there is just a whisper of evergreen. Mouthfeel is lively, zingy and sassy, making it a delight to drink."
"Poured a medium-colored gold with minimal head that died quickly. A weak smell, but some bread malts and yeast come through. The taste is better, as it has some sweetness and fruit flavors (not as much citric as tropical) mixed into the malts, think bready, doughy malts. Gives the beer a bullish medium body that fills the mouth and has a nice touch as it passes the tongue. A filling beer, somewhat, this was nice to throw down and I'd take another one if offered."
"This one is an above average yellow beer as it actually has detectable flavor. For the price, however, I'd have to recommend something else."
"Pours a bit of a hazy amber with a soft looking barely off-white head that leaves behind some spotty lace as is rapidly falls to nothing.The nose is slightly floral with some grainy notes.The taste is fresh and doughy with toasted wheat breads and some slightly sweet malts in nice balance.A light thin body could have used some more balls,overall a easy drinker for the beach or anytime I guess,finishes clean and refreshing."
"Pours a toasted straw color with a small white head that dissipated into a light ring around the glass. Very much looks like a Bud. The aroma is quite faint but I pick up some light grain and honey notes, perhaps a very subtle spice. The taste is of grassy grains, touch of honey, wheat malt characteristics which gives it that subtle spice, a touch bready. The feel is light to moderate with nice tingly carbonation, finishes very balanced and neutral. A very light all malt lager that is quite refreshing. I like the initial wheat characteristics but that does fade away as you get closer to the end of the glass. A very nice summer brew."
"Overall not bad, I am not the biggest fan of the style, but I have to admit this was much better then most. It at least had a slight variation and some flavor to it. An easy choice for a party or beach day. I don't know if I would purchase again, but if I saw it around I would have no issue in having one."
"Picked up a six at Green's in Myrtle Beach, SC. Packaged date of 05/18/08 so this was a fresh bottle. 12oz brown bottle poured into a pint glass. Pours a rich, golden yellow with a thin fizzy white head. The aroma is malty grains, hay and just a slight hint of grassy hops. The taste is just a little better than your typical American Macro Lager, at least there is a little flavor there, some malty grain with a spicy hop finish. Not a bad lager, really quite refreshing, but it just doesn't stand out."
"Light to medium bodied,an easy drinking beer with enough taste to keep me interested on a nice summer day."
"Very clean flavors and easy to drink. A bit one dimensional and nothing very special, but a nice summer time beer never the less."
"Tasted on 5/7/08."
"Palatable, decent, I'd order it over a Bud or other macrobrew every time."
"Golden straw color with a sudsy white head. Clean barley smell with a little sulfur. Very clean malt profile with a small touch of caramel. Soft malt body has a firm quality to it as well. Does that make sense? Medium body with a very mild hop finish. This is a solid example of an everyday European style lager. Nothing fancy, just smooth and clean with no off flavors. Certainly superior to macro lager, although hop and roasted malt geeks will find it bland. Good session lager."
"Malty, I think there was some wheat in there along with the barley. Although predominant with barley there is a kinda yeasty, bready, faint cream flavor that sticks around making it not as watery as other lagers. Light hints of sweet fruit and maybe some spice. It was matched by an interesting yet quite subdued slightly spicy hop profile that I could not pinpoint (wasn't too pronounced). A summery beer and a decent american lager. Gave it an average appearance because I couldn't pour it at the bar. Because it maintains my interest while it is light I would match this with any food as long as it didn't include too much dairy."
"M/D - Full bodied and very well carbonated. An easy drinking lager. Great example of what an American lager can be."
"On-tap at Mexicali-Brews in the NC Outer Banks. Pale, straw-yellow with good active carbonation followed by excellent retention. The smell is a little stale and then it impersonates a typical macro from here, with a stale, bready taste and a heavily carbonated finish. Nothing special here."
"For being affiliated with AB my experience with Kona brewing has been pleasant with this beer and also the fire rock pale ale. I look forward to trying others from their line up."
"Overall this is a very flavorful lager that isn't too heavy. A great session beer for a hot day."
"D: A very good light lager from Kona. Lots of flavour, but light enough to be easily sessionable."
"D - This is an extremely drinkable beer. It doesn't overwhelm the palate."
"I wasn't knocked out by this beer. There wasn't anything offensive about it, but it wasn't very memorable either."
"I am looking for the brew on tap, my new store is a little pricy on this one for what it is."
"Pass this one up before it starts taking tap handles and shelf space from quality stuff."
"""not quite ants at a picnic"""
"Not bad, not bad. I might very well add this to my rotation of medium-bodied, no-brainer lagers."
"Smell is of light hops and malts with faint herbaceous notes. Taste isn't bad, but it is not great either. It taste mostly like malt/adjuncts - just a straight beer flavor without bitterness or bad aftertaste. Nothing major - nothing worth writing home about, but still a decent brew."
"Poured into a pint glass. Not a big head and not a lot of carbonation. Looks to be unfiltered or at least a chill haze. The color is a pale straw. The aroma is a mix of malt, lemon zest, and cloves. The taste is slightly like a hefe-weizen, but not as much banana. The body is smooth and there is a ligering tartness in the aftertaste. An easy drinking session beer, but I'm not sure that it is the ideal lager; at least IMO. I'm going to try it on draft this weekend to see if there is much difference."
"hmm... not impressed."
"Not bad but not great. An average lager from the Big Island."
"Drinkability is right up there as a decent summertime refresher. As the days get warmer, I can envision Longboard being a convenient kick-back-and-relax session brew."
"Message in my bottle cap: ""Aloha Goodbye"""
"I have never had a Hawiian beer before. I must say I am quite impressed. I poured this one into a pint glass and examined it. Had a nice golden color with a decent head. Smelled mlaty and a bit citrusy. Taste was surprisingly good with a tuch on the malty side but very drinkable. I could see sipping this iced cold on a beach in Maui watching my daughter build a sand castle. Aloha!"
"Bottle dated Feb1508. 12oz bottle poured into a pint glass. Pours a golden yellow with a thin fizzy white head. The aroma is malt, grain, hay and just a slight hint of grassy hops. The taste is just a slight step up from your typical American Macro Lager taste with some malt, grain and a slightly spicy hop finish. Overall, I am not a huge fan of this lager, it just blends in with all the rest and doesn't really offer anything that makes me want to purchase again."
"Overall: I am an ale man, and tend to shy away from lagers unless there is nothing else offered. That being said if I am gonna drink a lager this may be the one. It's much better than the american lagers put out by the big american brewers."
"Surprisingly, this stuff isn't bad! I would actually drink this stuff again."
"D: Not bad for a lager. .."
"It's hard to do a good lager. Usually it either tastes like water, tastes 'soggy', or has some skuzzyness. THis one is really clean and well done. I cna close my eyes and imagine sitting on a beach in Kona drinking this one."
"12-oz bottle, into a mug glass. It does make a nice pour, crystal clear very pale gold, but with a creamy half-inch head on top. Sweet malt aroma, with a light touch of perfumy hops. Flavor is sweet, but not too grainy, with a nice sweetened breakfast-cereal touch (that sounds odd as a pleasant characteristic, but it just reminds me a little of fruit loops). Bitterness is low but detectable. Good body for the style, a little creamy."
"Chill-hazed golden body with an apricot tint, topped by a straw-colored head. The head subsides to a very thin layer quickly, leaving some hints of lacing. Nose is faint, a slight citrus hop on top of grain. Light malt flavors with a wheat fruit spice give this an interesting, if not unique flavor profile for a lager. As it warms, the banana becomes more evident, and complements the bitter orange peel. The finish is clean, with toasted malts lingering. The carbonation and crispness help the subdued flavors, making this a quintessential lawnmower beer."
"Finish is extremely dry and almost forces you to take the next sip to requench your mouth. Pretty easy drinking here, but nothing special."
"Pour is yellow lager like but with a bit of cloudiness and some white dissipating head. Smell is light malt, touch yeast and hops and is decent. Taste is mild light malt, with just a tiny hint of a spiced hefeweisen like taste in the middle, which I'm guessing is from the wheat, and it finishes pretty simply with a very mild sweet finish. This is worth a shot if its available, and I'm sure especially if fresh in Hawaii, but nothing too spectacular. It is a bit unique for a lager, I'll say, though."
"i found this beer to be a pretty average lager. nothing really special and just a step up from a macro (this may actually be a macro perhaps?) it was easy to drink and easy on the eye, but lacked much character. this would not be a beer i'd seek out again, but it was better than a bud."
"Was served this at a restraunt. It was served too cold in a chilled glass. Taste is light malt with a nice hoppy finish but pretty understated. . .a bit watery. . . no, very watery. Lively carbonation and a nice mouth feel. I think they have changed the design on the label since the photo on here was taken."
"Drinkability: After having it on tap, I'm willing to pick up a six pack, but I think I'll have to wait until summer in order to do that, because I imagine it will be much more satisfying."
"There's a free growler coupon in last month's Ale Street. Shhh... :P"
"The Longboard is a fairly regular part of my brew rotation during the summer.. and actually.. the quality is there to make it my ""lawnmower"" beer no matter what the outside temperature is."
"D: Definately a session beer"
"Maybe (hopefully?) I just got a bad batch of this, but it tastes terrible. And what is there isn't enough to make me bother trying it again in the future."
"An exceptionally good American lager -- a category sadly lacking in credible competition amongst the over-saturated pale ale market that clearly dominates the U.S. micro-brew landscape. An example of a very good beer, simply as it was meant to be -- drinkable, extremely drinkable."
"I was suckered in by the tap, my bad."
"Drinkability: Easygoing and enjoyable flavor with a body that enhances the experience. Well crafted."
"D- This would be a great alternative to a macro on a warm summer day. Very refreshing."
"Sample at Firewaters in Atlantic City. Pours a clear golden color with a thin white head that dissapears quickly. Spotty lacing. Lightly floral and grassy hops aroma. Light body with a mildly bitter hops flavor and an underlying malty sweetness. The finish is mildly bitter and lingering. Straightforward and overall an average Lager."
"This Lager when poured was a clear golden yellow in color with very little foam that dissapated within seconds. The smell of roasted malts and hops carried a mild pleasing aroma. The taste was of a bitter and tart with a hoppy and spice, spicy meaning coriander. Not really a bad lager, Of course, this lager taste better while sitting on the beach in Hawaii. Add a point on this lager, while drinking in Hawaii."
"Poured out of the bottle into a frosted mug. Poured a light golden color with about a half inch head with little lacing. This is a fairly light lager without a lot of hops. It drank smooth and easy and would probably be best enjoyed on a hot afternoon and in large quantities."
"Bright gold in color, with a fair white head. Fair retention, but a good amount of lace. Not much to this aroma, a bit of grain, and sweetness. A hint of earthy hops in the back. Pretty basic, pale malt, not overly sweet. This does not get too grainy. Pretty simple, and clean. Decent body and carbonation. Not too exciting, but ok."
"Good drink a good amount of these"
"Pours a crystal clear fizzy lemony pale straw color. A one-finger, tightly packed, short-lived white head tops the glass. Aroma is of pale malts and a sligth corn smell. Kinda sweet with a very light grassy hop note coming through. Taste is pretty much the same. Some citrus and floral hop flavors, with a nice malty/corn balance. Mouthfeel is light, refreshing and fizzy from carbonation. Very easy drinking and great for summers at the beach (especially if you're in San Diego for a great Labor Day beachside riot!)"
"had on-tap in a pilsner glass, pours a clear golden yellow with a small white head. smells of sweet malt and mild hops. taste is pretty much like it smells, sweet malts and mild hops, it tastes rather boring. mouthfeel is light bodied and smooth. drinkability is good, it would make a good alternative to a bmc beer."
"Drinkability is well easy until the skunky aftertaste."
"Good for the style."
"No dating on the bottle  I hope this was just an old bottle, and not a fresh example. Oh well, theyre not all gonna be winners."
"Acquired at the Friendly St. Market, Eugene, OR. It pours out with a thin, bright white and bubbly head. It's orange-golden in color and very effervescent and not completely translucent. The smell is kind of weak and mainly dominated by the yeast; taste is also a bit bland - there's just a lot of yeast in the taste without too much else in terms of hops or flavor. A nice lager to drink cold in the summer, but no complexity."
"Drinkability- Nice and drinkable - not exactly a lawn-mower beer, but not a late evening beer either. Well worth trying."
"D= you could easily session on this if you liked it."
"Mouthfeel is on the lighter side with sturdy carbonation as it goes down. An easy drinking lager that I can see being refreshing on a very hot day out by the beach. Although it's not something I'd personally grab regularly...it's still a tasty all malt lager that goes down easy and is plenty drinkable."
"Thanks to Talisker for the extra! Pours a hazy straw yellow with a thin head. The aroma is of sweet malts and slight fruit. The taste is malts against a subtle hop backbone, surprisingly enjoyable for a lager. The beer is light and crisp. This is an enjoyable summer brew."
"This beer poured a clear gold with a soapy, white head that settled fairly fast to a ring. Some short-lived lacing. Malty aroma, grainy and toasted, a little sweet. Some floral/citrus hop notes as well. Nice maltiness in the flavour, balanced well by moderate hopping. Bitterness was restrained and the floral/citrus hop flavour really held the sweet malts in check. Good body for a lighter beer, moderate carbonation, decent texture, light dryness in the finish. An easy drinking lager with an enjoyable flavour."
"Overall impression: Nice and drinkable - basic, but well made."
"D - This was a descent beer. My first offering from Kona or Hawaii."
"Pours a hazed golden, thin white head forms, settles down to a thin layer, small lace spots. Smell is sweet, some caramel and honey, light malts, veggies, citrus, bit of floral, interesting. Taste is malty, caramel, honey again, some light floral, bit of citrus, pineapples, grainy finish. Mouthfeel is light bodied with low carbonation, pretty silky going down. Interesting lager, has some neat character! Thanks Nate!"
"Doesn't taste like any lager I've ever had before. Seems more like a pale ale that is mildly hopped. Not bad."
"12 oz. bottle- color of clear honey , with a thin stark white head - nose of hay , grass , grainy and slight bitterness  taste of soapy fishyness , grainy , slight hops , and sour milk - body is creamy but acidic , and with high carbonation  aftertaste of orange peel , slight hint of hoppy bitterness , and gummy  this beer sucks much better on tap in Hawaii"
"Poured a golden hue with a good sized head - not notes on the retention, but as I recall it was fairly good. Biscuity malts are strong on aroma and taste, but this beer is smooth and still fairly well balanced between bitter and sweet. Only thing that let it down for me was that, more often than not, carbonation was a little too low. I'm willing to believe that this was down to who was serving, but without a bottle to hand to compare to, it's not cut-and-dried. Very drinkable - perfect for sitting at the beach bar when you can't face another mai-tai."
"Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: The beer is just shy of a medium body. The beer is very smooth and easy to drink. The beer is definately a good lawnmower beer. I drank nearly two of these in the time it took to write the review. I would gladly drink this beer again!"
"This beer starts out very average in appearance and smell. Its a clear straw gold color with a very thin head. The smell is grainy/alcohol that you get from a standard macro lager. The taste, however, is pretty good. A nice light bready sweetness and a smooth mouthfeel. The carbonation is on the higher end, but not so high as to make sting your tongue and throat as some other lagers do."
"D: The lager is very drinkable, smooth with a somewhat thin finish."
"Not really an exciting style, but a smooth quaffable lager. Lightweight with some lingering sweetness."
"Bottle. Poured a decent yellow color with a big frothy white head that was gone in a jiffy and left litttle lacing in my Duvel Glass. Nose smells strongly of malts and hops. Mouthfeel is a bit sticky, and flavor is a little sweet. Mildly bitter finish. A decent lager."
"I'm recreating this post from 4-year beer notes, I do know I liked this amber lager. It's something different among ""lagers"". It has a bit more of a tang than most lagers, with a pleasant lingering aftertaste. Smooth and light. (#1, 8/2002)"
"Another good brew from Kona, now I'm sorry that I didn't stop off as I drove past there earlier today."
"It's not bad, but not good either- very mild, boring even. An average lager, that's all."
"Nicely carbonated light mouthfeel to this one. Easy drinking and smooth. Definately one to offer your BMC buddies to introduce them to some craft beer."
"All-malt. All the time. I saw this in the Safeway on Oahu while on a trip there recently. I had heard of Kona Brewing, but hadn't tried any of their products. (This was definitely a good decision, though I now know I should have gone for the Ale.) Nice yellow to cloudy amber yellow in the glass, with a quickly dissipating head. All malt in the nose, and when the beer hits your mouth, it's (refrain) all malt all the time. Rich, flavorful malt, though just a tad bit cloying toward the end which dropped it a bit on my drinkability scale. When in Rome... I believe in enjoying the local beers when possible, and this was definitely a worthy aquisition. Well worth seeking and trying--and available on the US west coast, I understand."
"An average beer. Would be good to wash down a sandwich at lunchtime on a college football Saturday. Don't go crazy trying to find one, but if you are making a mixed six pack, throw one in to try. Mad thanks to Eclipsehts, part of our trade."
"Nice thick head with good retention gives this a high score for appearance. All other measures are a little above average. Nice and malty, not much hops flavor except for a slightly bitter aftertaste. Easy drinking lager."
"Overall a nice all-malt lager. I think this style as a whole is much under-appreciated."
"This beer pours clear golden; a very clean pure lager look. There is light head retention on the crisp white head and light, occasional lacing. The smell is bright and malty, with some fruity and grassy notes. The flavor is all caramel and fruity, very traditional lager taste but clearly all malt; no adjuncts here. This is a throwback to the early all-malt lagers of the mid nineteenth century Unites States. The non-descript bittering hops just barely outlast the malty sweetness for a medium length finish. This is a very clean, very drinkable lager."
"This beer had a nice bit of substance to it and seemed adjunct-free. An interesting and rather unusual fruityness popped up in the hops at the front and the beer finished almost too cleanly. As it warmed a bit, a more traditional malt and hops flavor profile came through, and some lingering bitterness emerged. More character than one ususally finds in a lager."
"Overall, this was drinkable since it lacked flavor and substance. Very macro lager style. That being said, I've had this many times in a bottle and, while I never liked it much, it was better than this version on tap."
"As I contemplated my order upon another bartender's recommendaiton, I thought, ""What do Hawaiians really know about beer?"" Apparently a little bit. This beer proved quite nice. Though typical in a base pale malt beer, the coler is an improved strong straw with fair head retention and carbonation. Aromas are a nice blend of malt and fruit. Modestly sweet with pilsner grains, an exotic fruit flavor made things interesting (mangos, pineapples, appricots, and kiwi). All the while, retaining a firm creaminess and consistency. The beer fared well even down to my last sip."
"This is a very drinkable beer. It is light and refreshing yet full-bodied. This is the second Kona beer I have had, and while its not as good as the pale ale, its still a solid brew from the islands. Mahalo!"
"Light-medium in body, moderately mild in the alcohol dept., it has a smooth, creamish mouthfeel and could be a good Summer hot weather brew for most. A nice brew from Paradice...cheers!"
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1/2"" bright white head above the clear golden brew. Head holds on okay, with average lacing. Aroma is minimal, pale malts and light hops, with a twinge of citrus. Taste follows along, the pale malts sweetness cut by some hops, and the light lemon character. Mouthfeel and drinkability are both reasonable, especially for the style, which can sometimes be lackluster. Not a bad brew here."
"Longboard Lager pours yellow in color with a white head. Aroma tends to the malty side, but citrusy hops lurk in the background. Taste is light but flavorful. Malt dominates but there is a hop presence as well. A very tasty light lager, a huge leap upwards in flavor from your typical macro lager."
"This beer is all about sweet malts, light and refreshing with a hint of hops- fairly light in the aroma, stronger in the flavor. This is a nice, easy drinking beer. Nothing amazing, but enjoyable."
"Dnot bad, but its more heavy than I like my lagers. Still, Id have another if offered."
"Pretty drinkable, a little more fruitiness would help. Not a bad lager, tastes like I remember from 95-01 when I lived. A decent drinker, nothing special"
"Drinkability: nothing to reach for here. I thought a simple lager would provide a light crisp refreshing beer, but this just didn't fit the bill. Go elsewhere..."
"This beer would probably make a good session beer. It is low in alcohol, and the flavor is not aggressive. I doubt I will buy it again. There are just too many good beers around that are better."
"A big thanks to my parents who always pick me up something from Hawaii when they make their annual winter vacation to the islands."
"Despite this so-so review, this could make a great session brew. I'd rather drink Kona Longboard than the A-B offerings any day."
"Cheers and `Onipa`a!"
"12 ounce bottle, PKGD ON JUl2005. Many thanks to mentor for the wedding present!"
"Definitely recommend this."
"I finally got to taste a beer from Hawai'i! I've been waiting on this one for quite sometime. Luckily they carried it at the BevMo in Oakland. The onlt kind of bad thing was that it was sold only in 6er's, which did turn out to be a good thing. I think one of the main highlights of this brew was the appearance. It had a white head that was super duper fluffy, which had pretty good retention. The body was a clean, golden straw color. The smell wasn't too bad either. I had had elements of strong floral hops up front, with tropical fruits and a malty finish. The taste wasn't great, but it wasn't too bad either. It was sweet, semi-hoppy, with a lighter taste of malts in the finish. It was a little too sweet to drink at first, but then as it warmed up, it mellowed out a bit."
"I could stand for a bit more hopping, for my personal taste, but as a regular ""drinkin' beer", this is very good. Uncommonly smooth, despite the grainy malt, this just feels like a quality brew. Thumbs up for my first beer from the aloha state. Mahalo nui loa, Kona Brewing Co!"
"Pours with a frothy pale cream colored head that sits atop a lightly hazy gold colored beer. The aroma is light and hoppily spicy with notes of grass, herbal and a light sweet grain note. The taste has a certainl fullness to it that is not as thin as I was expecting. This beer also has a nice sharp bited in the finish. Overall this is fairly clean, but it has perhaps a hint of DMS and diacetyl, though it is not too noticeable and adds to the flavor of this beer. This definitely has a sweet grain character to it, and I like the fullness in the palate."
"Cheers."
"Lighter than straw yellow color, not much smell, just a beery smell, but little of that. The taste is bitter but not too dry. It didn't taste bad but the only thing I was pulling out of it was a fairly bitter hopped beer without a lot of body. I might try another brew from Kona but the lager wasn't anything more than a slightly better than average beer."
"Bottle obtained from Liquor Mart (Colorado) and consumed the next evening. Packaged on July 200?...can't tell if the last number is a 3 or a 5. Pours a thin layer of white head over a somewhat cloudy straw colored liquid. Smells very mild. Malt sweet is gentle honey under an earthy dark hallertauer hop aroma. Tastes a bit sour to start, like a zing of hops, but then a strong pils malt sweet bursts in. In the finish, the malt looses ground as fruity ester (nectarine and apricot) rise and a dark deep hop character steps in. Some zip, like Saaz hops. Light in the mouth, but more viscous than I would have expected. Moderately carboanted."
"Served a very pale yellow color. Clear. Thick layer of medium bubbles on top. Aroma is musty Im not a huge fan of Saaz hops, and this seems to be the aroma hop. Taste is lacking. Very light malt/hop presence. Body was watery. Aftertaste is very slightly bitter and dry. This beer did nothing for me. There are much more interesting beers to be had in the islands to waste time with this one. It drinks like water while drinking it and trying to perceive flavors it just plain disappeared. Probably drank it in no more than 10 minutes. Which was fine, because then I could move on to something more interesting. 5.5% ABV? Not sure about that one"
"Overall I would buy this again but only in a pinch. I hate to compare but session from full sail blows this away in my opinion and its cheaper.."
"Unlike fellow advocate Hunter, I can pass on anything Hawaii, beer or the place. I did decide to try it on a hot day recently and a nice friendly local pub we like had it on tap. Standard lager color, maybe a bit darker, I'm about the reviewer who said it as a deep amber? White head, and some lacing was left. Not much aroma. Taste profile was very interesting. My first quaff found lots of malt, it was refreshing, which a lager should be, and had a softess to the mouthfeel. As the pint was drained I found a corn based taste sneaking in. I guess they don't stick too the german purity law. Still a decent lager and it was refreshing. For what it's worth Suzanne loved hers."
"I don't recommend this beer and don't consider it a craft brew at all. Not a drinkable beer in my book."
"I was actually in the town of Kailua at a place called Buzz's when I got a chance to try Kona Long Board. Our server said she preferred dark beers, but liked Long Board, so I decided I'd give it a try. As a porter/stout/ale drinker I thought I might have found a robust lager. Well, robust and full-bodied as it was, KLB didn't impress me too much. As lagers go, the appearance was very average, except for a tantilizingly deep amber hue. The color might be as good as stop-sign-red to most lager drinkers... ""be advised, this is no average lager."" Smell left something to be desired: a sharp, sour note with a nut edge. Taste was full-bodied but not gritty, starting sharp and a little sweet, settling on the tongue with an almost caramel or coffee flavor, finished bitter and pungant way that reminded me of a porter without the chocolate trailer or coffee aftertaste. If I had to describe this beer in a word, I think I'd use ""flavorful."" Aftertaste was present but not long-lasting... a mix of bitter undertone with that nutty dryness that seems fairly common in micro- or locally brewed dark lagers. This was a reasonably good beer, but I'm not convinced that I'd seek it out again. I'm still searching for that lager to make a worthy compliment to Cooper's ESVA."
"At $8 a six-pack this is too expensive to but regularly unless it has something special in it. Beyond the allure of the islands it's just not far enough removed from other macro lagers offerings to justify the cost. But a solid brew nonetheless."
"A very nice lager that would be good on a hot summer day."
"Pours a pale gold with a high, persistent head, lots of lace. Aroma of cooked corn and lightly fragrant hops. The flavor itself is very similar to any number of cheap adjunct lagers. The absence of all metallic flavors and a light gummy hop quality are the only evidence that this was craft-brewed (by Widmer, I believe). It's a standard lager, subpar for Oregon (it's worse than Henry's), and not worth the craft beer price (over a buck a bottle at the supermarket). The sticking points for me are a raw corn-husk grainy quality that is not at all integrated into the beer, and a too-long aftertaste that resembles slightly spoiled vegetables. The flavor profile is dominated by a repellent brackish quality. The mouthfeel is okay, but not soft enough to resemble a really good lager. I will not buy this again. There are plenty of cheap lagers that aren't any worse than this, and are much more affordable. I suspect this beer might be less offensive if you drink it out of the bottle."
"Drinkability  If you want a lager, why would you drink some macro-swill if you could have this?"
"Drinkability is good, I like this is a stronger Lager, it would be a bit better if it had a better smell."
"I could sit around watching football on the tube and enjoy several of these in a row. Nothing outstanding but an easy drinking beer."
"Was luck enough to get a few bottlles of this from a friend who does the comapny's POS displays. Smell reminded me of a Pabst, and the golden colored lager did not produce much of a head. Did not taste like much of anything, rather bland with no noticeable tastes. Glad to try a beer from HI, just wish it would have been better."
"Drinkability- Not a bad stab at a lager. Have had many better, but a decent attempt. Might try again."
"Not worth a try."
"Recommended to me by the bartender -- over the other ten beers served on tap. Served up an enticing golden color with a thin head that quickly disolved. Slightly hoppy smell and taste which was quickly replaced by the heavily carbonated mouthfeel. This sensation remained throughout the quaffing. Pleasantly surprised by this lager as I generally prefer darker brews."
"That last sentence is way too strong. Sorry."
"The mouthfeel was firm with good carbonation. Very easy drinking beer here! If they could up the arroma a bit it would be even better!"
"Poured a golden color with a head that sustained fairly well. Nose was nothing noteworthy. Taste was better than anticipated. Started off somewhat sweet but was balanced well in the end with the dry hop finish. It had a reasonably full feel to it, not watery at all. This is a surprisingly good lager, very drinkable."
"It's ok to drink - not really for a hot, hot day (where I'd much rather have a crappy, mass-market lager or a very dry and hoppy IPA) but pretty good when it's not quite that hot."
"Long Board Lager is mildly interesting beer. It deserves points for boldness even if the flavor isn't fantastically impressive. Ke aloha no me ka mahalo kaua."
"Drinkability & Notes: An all around easy drinking lager, this is a real American Lager in my book. Light yet still very flavorful, an all purpose beer."
"A nice gift from BA Uncle Jimbo. My bottle was packaged on Mar2504. Classic American Lager, eh? You know, maybe so. I have some chill haze, but what I am getting color wise is spun straw all the way. The head went, er, somewhere fast, just left me a layer on top. Aroma is interesting, I am getting sort of green apples meets bread set aside to rise. Mouthfeel is actually rather thick, interesting change, but maybe a bit much. I'm getting more green apples from the taste. Finish is a little off, maybe wants to go metal but not quite. The beer isn't bad, but the finish is still kinda funky somehow, and the thick mouthfeel brings down the drinkability. Even so, thank you Jim, I am glad I was able to try this."
"This lager poured a hazy, yellow color with a nice, creamy, very white foam which unfortunately settled very quickly and dissipated. The smell was modest: light malt with a hint of sweetness. The taste was decent enough, but light: lightly malty with some grain notes and with moderate hoppiness in the finish. There was also a bit of floral hop flavor as the beer warmed. The mouthfeel was smooth and dry with medium-light body and low carbonation. The flavors lingered lightly, but overall it was fairly clean. This was a decent lager, and was easy to drink."
"Wasn't impressed by this lager, pours a golden yellow with no head to speak of, only a dissapointing fizzle. Smell is of light roasted apples and grain. A light sweet malts lingers almost unoticed. Taste is sticky with molasses and fruitness. Has a light malt blast that makes it medium bodied for a lager. Average at best, I can't really every see myself sitting down to a nice meal with this again."
"Piney hops on a hugely malty honey sweet flavor, this is almost bock-like in its maltiness. Relatively thick beer (too sweet and thick for my tastes). I would imagine a beer with less substance coming from Hawaii to combat the heat, but this was a great little beer."
"Fairly drinkable but not completely satisfying"
"Pale straw in colour, head comes and goes quite fast. Little more colour than the average lager. Light tasting weak malt and even weaker hops. They certainly do what they are supposed to do. Crisp on the pallet. Refreshing brew, very welcome on this hot day. I will have another."
"This is quite drinkable a good lager not great though"
"Comment: underrated IMHO as a lager lover"
"Mehana's Tsunami lager this beer played it way safe and tried to make a beer that is easy for the Yellow Drinkers to digest. Just cause you make a lager doesn't make it a reason to aim for a better Bud."
"Pours a yellow straw hue with a strong but short lived white head that leaves moderate lacing. The nose is dominated by Autumn fruits, apples and pears chief among them. A strong, biscuity sweetness underlies it all, and some grassy hops make their presence known too. The taste is endearing. Sweet frutiness is represented up front before reaching a crescendo of grainy wholesomness. This one has a dry, green, hoppy finish that is quite satisfying. Mouthfeel is thin for my taste, but fine for the style. They didn't overdo the carbonation. Drinkability is strong."
"Notes: Not bad, but more than a tad forgettable; sweetness is a tad cloying."
"The paradigmatic lager color an unblemished gold color, the classical bright white head that is modest in size and as it recedes, a filmy sheet of lace covers the glass. The nose prototypical lager malt, crisp and fresh, a pleasing malt rich and sweet start, the middle is moderate in its feel. Finish is mildly acidic, the hops present and apropos to the style with the aftertaste dry and sweet, a drinkable but unremarkable lager, I guess just plain old as expected!"
"Medium gold color, small white foamy head. Aroma is grainy and slightly sweet. A mildly hopped and malted lager. Light and refreshing. Clean and crisp. Good flavor. Full Mouthfeel. Some malt sweetness. Finish is clean. Aftertaste is slightly bitter, mostly malty."
"Well, if your goal is to have beers from all 50 states, this one covers Hawaii."
"Overall: Definitely an above-average lager that is thankfully different to most of the ubiquitous Euro-Lagers so often made these days and quite quaffable actually."
"This brew pours from the bottle with a hazy honey-gold hue and leaves a thin lace upon the glass. The delicate aroma is composed of a thin honey-malt. The first sip is obviously malty with equally evident caramel flavor quickly interrupted by a mild bitterness that immediately gives way to and increasing returning lingering malt. Quite complex and enjoyable."
"A big thank you to aemac52 for allowing me to sample some Hawaiin beers!"
"The slightly hazy golden body is capped by a bright-white head of creamy foam that holds OK before dropping to a decent collar and whispy surface covering. The nose expresses a dry, grainy malt with some mild earthy and leafy hop notes. The body is firmly medium with a fine carbonation that leaves it gently crisp and then lightly creamy in the mouth. The flavor is surprisingly rich for the style, and loaded with dextrinous maltiness. Some spicy, grassy, and floral hop flavor comes into play and gives it a bit of a honeysuckle flavor when wrapped in its lightly sweet malt; and there's a solid bitterness (@24 BU's) to balance it and lead to a dry and spicy finish! Definitely more than I expected... a true ""hand-crafted"" brew! It's light enough to enjoy as a ""lawnmower beer", but with enough character to make you think ""I'll have another""!"
