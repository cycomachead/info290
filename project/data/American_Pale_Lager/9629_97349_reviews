"3rd beer of Taste Eve. Hazy straw body. Not much head. Aroma is all citrus. Very tasty. Is this citra hops? Has to be one of the best lagers I've had."

"O - Its pretty agressive for an IPL, but solid none the less. Excellent brew."

"Overall, MMMKay is easily one of my new favorites from Short's. The beer really drinks like a session IPA and its lager characteristics lend themselves well to the beer."
""
""
""
"O- This one would be great if they toned down the pine but that is my problem with a lot of Short's hoppy offerings. It's especially disappointing when all the other aspects of this beer are great."

"Okay, this surprised me big time and I'm digging it big time. What a treat! And there's even a bit of a malty touch way in the background."
"A bit of a mess, but a beautiful mess... It could use some refining and has the potential to be a knockout!!! Recommended for sure. This brew packs a serious punch!"
""
"O - Not bad by any means. There is a lot going in this beer. It's basically another solid beer from Short's."
""
"It pours a tan straw-golden color. The beer has a rounded floral character with a soft hoppiness to the aroma. There's a pleasing bitterness with a rounded feel to it. The beer has a mellow toasted-straw flavor character, with a light yet lingering body. It’s a hoppy pilsner that’s far better than its name."

"Yet another hopped up lager that kind of strips the ""lager"" qualities away by the over-use of hops. Not to say that it isn't an enjoyable beer, though. I really enjoyed it, but you better be ready for a full-on, bitter assault, as the hop sidekicks are rather pushed to the side just a bit. I'm weird, though, because I'd take an aggressively bitter, lighter beer with pale malt before a hop heavy DIPA that's sticky and sweet from caramel malt. Nevertheless, another good drinking Shorts brew."

"This isn't a bad beer, it just ain't my speed. I can actually appreciate the effort, but the combination leaves me with metaphorical hives. Mediocre doesn't begin to describe it."

"Crisp and clean in a light to medium body, the feel displays some depth. Smoothness rolls lightly beneath the bite and into a drying finish."
"If I didn't have plentiful access to Jack's Abby, this would be killer. As it stands, it's a bit out of whack, leaving too much bitterness with little support. It's solid, but not enough to draw me away from the local goodness."

"12 ounce bottle into lager glass, bottled on 7/19/2013. Pours lightly hazy bright golden color with a 1 finger dense white head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with some moderate streaming carbonation. Aromas of big grapefruit, orange zest, lemon zest, guava, pine, floral, grass, light honey, light bread, and floral/yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with big citrus hops and a light-moderate malt backbone; and good strength. Taste of grapefruit, orange zest, orange rind, lemon zest, pine, floral, grass, light bread, light honey, and floral/yeast earthiness. Good amount of pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, citrus zest, citrus rind, pine, floral, grass, light bread, and earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and complexity of hop flavors with a light-moderate malt backbone; and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth, crisp, and moderately sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a damn nice IPL. All around good balance and complexity of hop flavors with light malt balance; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A very enjoyable offering."
"O: Overall a very good IPL and another winner from Short's."

"Looks good, smells good, feels good, and tastes good... but the aftertaste is so unpleasantly bitter that it really ruins the rest of the experience. There's hop bitterness, there's roasted malt bitterness, and then there's just BITTER. And this is the pinnacle of JUST BITTER. I'm not a fan."

"(O)- Overall, not too shabby. Good hop presence and balance overall that would keep me interested. If I lived closer to a source I might get this again if fresh."

"Overall I thought this was a good beer and an above average example of the style, the hops were pretty aggressive in this beer, but they still allowed the malts to provide a little balance to this beer. This beer had decent drinkability, it was a little smooth, clean, and the flavors did a nice job at holding my attention, but the lingering bitterness would prevent me from drinking more than two since I think it would really start to wear on me, so I think one might be the perfect amount for me. What I liked the most about this beer was the aroma, it was very nice with a good hop profile. What I like the least about this beer was the lingering bitterness, it just lingered for too damn long, and I don't think I have ever had a beer where the bitterness stuck around this long. I would buy this beer again if they release it next year, but I think I would just grab a few bottles and not a six pack, I recommend this to anyone who likes hoppy lagers, it certainty isn't lacking in the hops department. All in all I thought this was a pretty nice beer, but it isn't my favorite of the style and I liked The Beard Of Zeus a little more than this beer. This beer had some great quality's but I think the really lingering bitterness held this beer back a little. This was another nice beer from Short's, but I think they make better Hoppy Lagers, but i'm happy to have a chance to try it."

"Overall: another great beer from short's (who deserve to be in the talk for best year 2013). very tasty, pretty drinkable and nice and complex"

"MMMKAY is a light amber color. A slight, somewhat creamy head. Mostly good lacing, though it tapers off about halfway through the glass. It smells and tastes of hops... really tastes like a light IPA or something, which isn't a bad thing. There's a significant hop bitterness throughout each sip, so this is a good choice for the hop heads, for sure. The hops in this are really grassy, with a sort of citrus flavor as well. MMMKAY is a super solid beer, but it's nothing that blows me away, as there's nothing about this beer that stands out and puts it above anything else. Another tasty brew from Short's."

"Overall, this is a very nice beer by Short's surprisingly complex for the style without being overly bitter. The drinkability of this one is high and it would make a great session beer. The only real problem going on with this beer is that it is a limited beer and I will only be able to drink it for a limited time. Would love to see this one around year long."

"This beer looks like a simple ale, but don't let that fool you. It hits your tongue with a bomb of hops, and flavor! It was completely caught off guard from then color (even though I knew this was a great beer). It's a great beer, and a definite try if you love beer! TRY IT, you wouldn't be disappointed!"
""
"O - Without enough grain to back up the massive bitterness from an early hop addition, this beer falls ""short"" of anything worth drinking (no pun intended because Short's actually manages to brew some pretty good stuff)"
"O- It should get hammered as an American Pale Lager, but I can't bring myself to do it. It's more like the ever-popular session IPA, and a good one at that. Just enough malt backbone that it doesn't strike me as hop-water. Given the options, I'd take this over most session IPAs. Maybe a side-by-side with Founders All Day is in store (though I'd generally rather buy Two Hearted, Huma Lupa, ect. And just drink less). I'm still baffled at the pricing points of the lower ABV beers. Please, somebody brew the low ABV stuff and drop the sixer price by a buck or two. I'd be all up on it."
