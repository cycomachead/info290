I really enjoyed it, but you better be ready for a full-on, bitter assault, as the hop sidekicks are rather pushed to the side just a bit. I'm weird, though, because I'd take an aggressively bitter, lighter beer with pale malt before a hop heavy DIPA that's sticky and sweet from caramel malt.

Spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with some moderate streaming carbonation. Aromas of big grapefruit, orange zest, lemon zest, guava, pine, floral, grass, light honey, light bread, and floral/yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with big citrus hops and a light-moderate malt backbone; and good strength. Taste of grapefruit, orange zest, orange rind, lemon zest, pine, floral, grass, light bread, light honey, and floral/yeast earthiness. Good amount of pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, citrus zest, citrus rind, pine, floral, grass, light bread, and earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and complexity of hop flavors with a light-moderate malt backbone; and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth, crisp, and moderately sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a damn nice IPL. All around good balance and complexity of hop flavors with light malt balance; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Aug 18, 2013"

3.85,-1.8,4,4,3.75,4,3.75,"Overall I thought this was a good beer and an above average example of the style, the hops were pretty aggressive in this beer, but they still allowed the malts to provide a little balance to this beer. This beer had decent drinkability, it was a little smooth, clean, and the flavors did a nice job at holding my attention, but the lingering bitterness would prevent me from drinking more than two since I think it would really start to wear on me, so I think one might be the perfect amount for me. What I liked the most about this beer was the aroma, it was very nice with a good hop profile. What I like the least about this beer was the lingering bitterness, it just lingered for too damn long, and I don't think I have ever had a beer where the bitterness stuck around this long. I would buy this beer again if they release it next year, but I think I would just grab a few bottles and not a six pack, I recommend this to anyone who likes hoppy lagers, it certainty isn't lacking in the hops department. All in all I thought this was a pretty nice beer, but it isn't my favorite of the style and I liked The Beard Of Zeus a little more than this beer. This beer had some great quality's but I think the really lingering bitterness held this beer back a little. This was another nice beer from Short's, but I think they make better Hoppy Lagers, but i'm happy to have a chance to try it.","StoutHunter","0"

It smells and tastes of hops... really tastes like a light IPA or something, which isn't a bad thing.

Just enough malt backbone that it doesn't strike me as hop-water. Given the options, I'd take this over most session IPAs. Maybe a side-by-side with Founders All Day is in store (though I'd generally rather buy Two Hearted, Huma Lupa, ect. And just drink less). I'm still baffled at the pricing points of the lower ABV beers. Please, somebody brew the low ABV stuff and drop the sixer price by a buck or two. I'd be all up on it.","GRPunk","0"
