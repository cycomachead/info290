Not bad and would recommend to someone to try. In my opinion I believe this beer to have a wider appeal to regular beer drinker unless they live and die by light beer.

3.84,18.9,3,4,3.5,4,4.5,"""Not bad", reads the label of Supper Club Lager. This straight up traditional Wisconsin lager has the look of a midwest lager with an amber color, light head, and little retention. Its smell is a little more floral than the mass produced brews and a taste of sweet piney malts on the front of the pallete. After working on a 6 pack of Capital's Wisconsin Amber last week, this compares well as a toned down version. Sup Club is a very easy to drink session brew, and while the mouthfeel isn't as sophisticated as many ales reviewed on BA, its drinkability factor is real strong. Above all, at $7 for a 6 pack, I'd have to agree this isn't bad at all!","innersanctum","Feb 22, 2011"

It poured clear gold from the can and had a quickly receding head of foam. The aroma was a husky, slightly vegetal bread smell with a hint of malt sugar. The flavor then, is unsurprisingly sweet. It's not anything overpowering, just a nice light caramel to go along with the white bread, barley and slightest hint of spicy hops. Overall, this is a great lawnmower beer. I'd take a case out to a lake house in the summer.","tempest","Nov 16, 2010"

Nose had a pleasant lager sweetness, nothing wild or amazing, but no adjuncts, either. Mouthfeel was medium with a nice sweetish lager flavor in the mouth. It is enough to make me weep when I think of how many AALs I have drank when this would be the right way to make a lager. Finish was simply lager, unencumbered and tasty. I liked this better than I did initially, on draft at Old CHI and I could see putting some in my cooler. If that constitutes ""A Wisconsin State of Mind", I'm there.

Nothing remakable. The flavor is a slight improvement but not by much. Just the slightest hint of some Noble hops to compliment the otherwies unremarkable malt flavor. Slight lemon in the finish. Bitterness is low. Body and carbonation is average. Priced at $9.99 this is way overpriced as well.
