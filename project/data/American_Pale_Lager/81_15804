2.83,21.5,1.75,1.75,3,3.5,3.75,"Having said all that I have to say the beer isn’t that bad. Once you get over the initial shock at all the sweet tastes, you do grow into it, and it does become a relatively smooth enough beer to drink.  I think these beers would be a great accompaniment to a night on the town, perhaps have two or three to give you a little kick in your drinking during the night, or before you hit the clubs. Any more than that and I’m not sure how they would go down. I don’t think I could drink more than two or three to be honest. But overall its a good effort and I like the idea of Desperadoes. Have I found the taste of the tequila? Not sure, but then does it matter, the beer has a certain function which is to set you up for the party or the night, and this beer does that perfectly. A good party beer.","Thisdrinkinglife","Feb 09, 2015"

The smell though was the first hint that this was special. The perfectly mixed odor of tequila with the barley and malt was so sweet to the nose. The mouthfeel accentuated the smell - thick, crisp, and bold. The taste was what really blew me away - the lager flavor mixed oh so well with the tequila - I wish I had thought of this idea myself.

3,28.8,3,3,3,3,3,"OVERALL: When I first moved to Germany in 2002, a mate of mine and myself drank this stuff by the boatload. It was everywhere in the north, and people in their late teens and early twenties drank it at bars and clubs quite regularly. It still is quite popular in Europe among young people, and I see why. It's much more palatable than some of the grainy lagers that are readily available at bars, and for a young person just wanting to get a buzz without having to choke something nasty down, this is a fine option. It doesn't exactly taste like beer per se, but it's not trying to either. Most people just rate it into the ground because it's easy and accepted. However, it's certainly decent for what it is, and brings back some fun memories...","Jeffo","Jun 08, 2014"

1.63,-30,2.5,2,1,3,1.5,"Strange. That's what comes to mind with this beer. From a clear bottle with a decidedly southwestern theme, the beer is supposed to be flavored with tequila. It's a light gold color with a soft and small head. The flavor is odd. It honestly smells more like a lemon-lime soda than a beer. Sweet and citric. The taste is similar...soda-pop citrus and sugar. It's less like beer than like candy. It's clearly aimed at someone who doesn't like the taste of beer (looks like beer, but tastes nothing of the beverage). The beverage is moderately carbonated, and medium bodied. It would be cloyingly sweet, except for the lemon-lime tang at the finish. No hop and no malt character. Soda-pop disguised as beer.","Suds","Nov 24, 2006"

Although, even despite being (very) a sub-par beer this certainly would have it's place among many (myself, perhaps, included). I can't drink those ""alco-pop"" coolers (I find them far too sweet, sugary and artificial) but this Desperados beer would make a welcome substitute.","biegaman","Nov 04, 2006"

I looked down at the bottle and noticed that it was brown rather than the usual green. I looked at the labeldesparados? WTF? I looked around the joint and as some sort of New Kids like song started playing all these French and Arab kids starting dancing like Michel Stipes circa 1987. I couldnt figure out why they were acting so ridiculous until I looked at their hands. Desarados everywhere. Everybody was drinking these things, even the Arabs and Arabs dont drink. I suddenly realized that I was in the Twilight Zone so I got the F out of there and rinsed my mouth out with a tall boy can of Bavaria 8.0 that I bought off an Anarchist bum on the corner.","DaPeculierDane","Dec 30, 2005"
2.58,10.7,3,2.5,2.5,3,2.5,"Fischer in France has put out some gimmicky beers in the past, and this seems to fit the mark. A pale lager with Tequila flavour. The bottle fits the South American-Mexican genre: clear with a green and red embossed label. The beer poured with a decent head, large bubbled. A clear honey colour. The head actually stayed quite nicely at about 4 cm, and did not seem to move till I drank from the glass; it was actually the best part of the beer, staying creamy and consistent throughout my drinking. The lacing is super-thick. The beer smells like a Mexican-style lager with lime in it. There is a soft hint of tequila, making for a unique if not wholly appetising aroma. However, the malting smells good enough: sweet and sugary, with just a touch of grassy hops in the background. The taste is like light lime-flavoured water at first. The finish is more palatable, with some good Pilsner-style maltiness and a little bitterness. This really tastes like lime-flavoured water though. The mouthfeel is light with a little carbonation. This is probably fine freezing cold on a hot day, but as for redrinking marks, this rates pretty low. Interesting concept, gimmicky execution.","Cwrw","Aug 14, 2005"

Beer was a golden color with an okay head. Smell was almost citrusy and a smell of tequila. Taste had some honey to it and tequila to it. Mouthfeel, well, it was there, but it wasn't pleasant. Drinkability, sure, I was able to finish the bottle. It's not as terrible as it sounds but it's no where close to good.","badbeer","Jun 21, 2005"
