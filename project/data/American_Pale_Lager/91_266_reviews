"Not bad for the lager category. Only issue is the carbonation. I would like to like more"
"I usually have 1 everytime i go to indian dinner."

"Goes well with Indian curry, they say, a combination that could lead to a day sat on the toilet. Not a bad drop really."
"A nice, refreshing beer that may not wow the IPA hop-head crowd, but delivers a decently crafted lager experience for those seeking a mild, refreshing, malt-forward beer."
"Overall: This isn't a beer to be fussed over. It's a beer for when you want something that pairs well with spicy, down-and-dirty curry. Certainly gets the job done."

"Refreshing, easy drinking...food beer!"

"No."
"am in India sippin on the suds  tasted decent enough"
"Fair bit of carbonation.  Stong malt aftertaste that lingers.  Good flavors up front, but I'm not a fan of the finish."

"Poured into a nonic glass. Pours a light straw amber with gold tints with a one finger white head that dissipates to patches. Served too cold at a restaurant. Aroma is light grainy malt with a hint of grassy hops. Flavor is similar, grainy malt and light grassy hops, but has some nice biscuit malt flavors in the finish that redeemed it and made it a nice accompaniment to an Indian restaurant meal. Light bodied. I wasn't expecting much and so this light, slightly grainy lager was fine for dinner. The biscuity finish was more enjoyable than I expected and I would consider this again for a similar meal rather than a sweeter adjunct style lager."

"My Review: It's from India !!!"
"Nice taste, but look while being poured was ..well interesting"

"Overall: whilst this is still just a pretty standard macro lager, it is better than your average. Pretty good for AU$43 a case too."
"Good only for cooking sausages."

"Final Grade: 3.00, a C grade. Kingfisher Premium is actually a decent industrial lager, but not at Canadian import prices. The flavour grew on me a little as I made my way through the glass, but not enough to give this anything more than a mediocre grade - because it is just a mediocre pale lager. If you're at an Indian restaurant  and the beer selection is limited, this would be a viable option, but I can't envision a situation where I'd go out of my way to drink this again."

"It's usually what I can find at an Indian restaurant.  It's okay for cutting spiciness, but overall a pretty mediocre brew.  It's grainy and dry without any real character."
"This beer tasted so much better in India. I had it in the states and didn't care for it.  If you get a chance to go to India, definitely give it a try."

"Overall – This is a less than average Lager definitely not the best in the world but a hell of a long way removed from the worst. When I drank this in India you had to up end it in water to let the glycerine fall out or it gave the runs. That said in the Thar Desert it was pretty drinkable but we were so thirsty we may have settled for camel piss. And this beer I suspect is not far removed. The flavour lingers for a good time which is always nice if you are drinking something good but in this case it is not…."

"I grabbed only one of these at my local liquor store where you can awesomely make your own 6-pack. I was excited to try something new and out of the ordinary. I thought it might be tasty in likeness of a Stella or maybe some other familiar green bottle beer like Moosehead. I was wrong and I won't ever try it again!"

"Overall: If I'm going to drink a green bottled lager, I'll choose any beer but this one next time, if there ever will be a next time."
""

"Only reason I would ever drink this crap is because it is the only - blind - option on tap at Bengal Brasserie, Wetherby... I felt sick from the oily old hops... beer does go with curry: ipa perhaps I am told, but this does nothing to support the dishes at all."
""
"OK and drinkable, but not much taste there."

"I have been able to procure this beer at various Binny's Beverage Depots in the Chicago, Red Robin Liquors in Berwyn, Illinois, and Feldman's Market in McAllen, Texas. It was one of the more popular Indian brands in the United States. It pours clear golden, small but persistent head, and above average carbonation. It has pleasantly bitter set taste, with hints of sweetness and grains. It goes down smooth without much of an edge, leaves a slight bitter aftertaste, and is light and less filling."

"O: There is nothing special about this beer but it does pair really well with spicy Indian food and really cuts through the spiciness. Refreshing and easy to drink but not a beer I will be getting regularly."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a mostly clear medium golden color with a smallish white head that recedes quickly leaving a moderate amount of lace on the glass. Smells of light sweet bready malt with a hint of sulfur and very light spicy hops. The flavor is light sweet bready malt with light hop and little else. Medium to light body with a moderate level of carbonation and a slick watery mouthfeel. Straight forward macro lager, a bit on the sweet side but loaded with bland. I could drink this if I had to or if it were 105 degrees, but given the chance I would pick something else first."
""
"O: There's nothing really special that stands out about the taste of this beer, but it is easy to drink and doesn't have too much in the way of adjunct aromas or flavors. It seems like it would help take the bite out of spicy Indian food."

"O - This certainly isn't a beer I will seek out again anytime soon. This is domestically mass produced under supervision from Kingfisher. I think there are better Indian beers out there worth trying. In this case, I think Kingfisher is trying to mimic other major domestic lagers. If this is the case the set the bar low and just cleared the bar"

"O: Typical AA Lager, reminding me of Pabst Blue Ribbon, but more watery. Still, its got more taste than some AA Lagers."

"O- not as bad as I thought it would be, it has more flavor than typical adjuncts, but not something I would reach for again"
""
""
"Good only if you're eating Indian food, not worth a separate purchase."
"Overall I'm not at all impressed with this beer."
"Refreshing, floral, and sweet. Pale lagers ain't so bad when you don't throw a bunch of rice in it."

"Kingfisher Premium Lager Beer ---3/5."

"Easy to drink and doesn't interfere with the flavor of the Indian food I was eating, but I can't see myself ever ordering this utterly unremarkable beer ever again."

"Considering my overall aversion to the sweetness, I was surprised to find a couple of sips somewhat enjoyable. Perhaps it was the freshness of the can: I drank it on 12 November and the can was ""manufactured"" on 07 November. Or maybe the seasoned puffed rice that I snacked on as I sipped cut some of the sweetness."
"I poured this beer into my tumbler at 45 degrees. The beer was a golden color and quite nice looking with its nice white head. However the head did not hang around long. The beer also had a little bit of that skunky (Becks) smell, thank goodness it did not taste that way. it did have a bit of a bitter finish though not bad. I will buy again."
""
""
"Pours a clear golden yellow color with a very small head. There is a slight scent of grains and hops, but nothing all that strong. The taste is pretty average for an imported lager. There is a decent taste of grains and citrus mixed with some slight hops. Smooth and mellow that delivers an overall light and refreshing taste. A lot better tasting then you would expect from an Indian beer."

"Overall, a fairly typical Euro lager although it is not one of the better ones I have had. Just does not finish dry enough for me."
""
""
"O: There aren't too many good things to say about Kingfisher Premium Lager other than its a fairly inoffensive, clean, crisp lighter beer to wash down food or perhaps quench your thirst on a humid day. I wouldn't turn one away, though, because this all-malt, no frills, 4.8% ABV lager is just slightly above average in my book."
""
""
""
"in all its forms this beer is pretty sub par. pours a clear yellow wheat color with nice rising carbonation but a quickly fading head. smells a bit skunked, possibly a product of the green bottle, but a bit rancid in odor. also some undigested sugars that still remain are present. flavor is about the same as the nose, a little like cold white toast, but with some sweetness in the finish. mouthfeel redeems it, its cold and crisp, lively on the tongue, and clean. very light body, easy drinker if you dont mind the taste. overall a beer that is impossibly unsatisfying as a last drink before 2 weeks of sobriety, but one that hits the nail on the head as a first drink after those 2 weeks. thats about all i say for kingfisher."

"This beer is lucky. While it tastes pretty bad compared to any craft beer, it is the most popular and most available beer in India. The colour is pale golden, and always served very very cold. Almost get a head freeze! Very very carbonated and will keep you gassy and burping (not to mention pissy) for a long time. Goes well with Indian food - most lagers go well with spicy food. Gets warm very soon and tastes terrible when at room temperature (undrinkable actually!)"
"Edit: noticed a bottle of this in the back of my dad's fridge last time I visited. Maybe I'll crack it open and see if it's actually as bad as it was on tap at the brewery!"

"Unremarkable yellow-golden lager color, quickly-dissipating foam, fairly carbonated and best served very, very cold against a hot day. Bit too much of a Bud Light-like aftertaste for. An unremarkable beer but enjoyable in cultural context."
"Overall - This is a pretty good beer. Light and crisp."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall not a bad lager which really doesn't deserve the below average rating. Not my best style so it would only be something I would order again if at the restaurant."

"A friend brought it over for me to try, so I split it with him. Golden yellow pour, good head. The aroma at first is off, after a minute or 2 kinda bland. The taste is light, some grassy hops, finishes slightly bitter. The body is light, good carbonation. Not something I would pick up, but if offered it is not terrible."
""
""
""
""
"Poured into a weizen glass (my only clean glassware at the time), appears straw yellow with a fading collar of white foam, presents a very strong cooked corn aroma combined with a medium skunked aroma...tastes like a helping of overcooked corn and gym socks on a slab of wet moldy cardboard. Light body, but I didn't get too far into it before pouring the rest of it down the drain. If this is what they consider ""premium," I shudder to think what the normal version would be like."
""
"God-awful, really."
""
""
""
""
""
"This poured out as a golden yellow color with a thin white head that fades quickly. The smell of the beer was sweet but almost smelled like a locker room to me... Not that appealing. The taste of the beer is average, the taste is a little on the sweet side just a touch of bitterness to it. The mouthfeel was typical, nothing too exciting going on really. Overall this beer wasn't anything special in my opinion. My friend was raving about it so I gave it a try when he offered me some. It's not something I'd ever buy myself. It he really enjoyed it."
""
""

"What one would expect in the style and coming in a green bottle. Basic adjuncts, some sweetness and a light touch of skunk. Not the worst in the style but not enjoyable either."
"O - A well done lager with relatively minor faults. A wonderfully drinkable beer."

"A light gold colored lager with very little white head on top and no lacing. The aroma offers oaky malt and oats. The flavor is nutty malt and vanilla with a touch of sweet cardboard. I also detect some woodsy cereal grain elements. It’s on the heavy side of light bodied with ample, tasteful carbonation for a light and refreshing feel that goes down very easily. Different from your typical lager and a passable choice with your Indian meal."
""

"Flavor isn't too bad with fruit and relaxed hop notes, nothing bad in here. Smell upsets me as it reminds of bathing a dog."
"Overall- Reminds me of a run-of-the-mill adjunct lager. Unimpressive and forgettable."
"Golden yellow in color with a deep haze. Poured with a fizzy white foam that quickly disappeared without much of any lacing. Grainy malt and grassy aromas with very light hop character. Medium bodied with fizzy carbonation. Earthy, grainy malt flavor with grassy undertones from beginning to emd with light bitter hop character from the middle to the finish."
"Aroma is crisp and malty, typical but not off-putting. It pours a typical clear straw yellow with a fairly thick white head. Flavor is about average for a lager, crisp and malty but not complex. Texture has average body and a fair amount of fizz. Not great, but give it a try."
"O - I can see how this could be OK alongside a curry, but just a mediocre, bland lager at its core. And another thing, why do breweries like this use green glass? Is it cheaper, or is it completely and absolutely unjustifiable in every way?"
"Mouthfeel is light-bodied. Not at all sticky, it is faintly drying. Easy to drink beer, I would put this in the ""lawnmower"" beer category. Best saved for the hottest of the hot summer days."
"Not a whole lot to this beer in the pour or look. Has a light appearance with hardly any head and no lacing to be seen. The aroma was pretty much missing as well and any scent that was present reminded me of the filler used in the mass-market brews."
"RJT"
"O: Easy drinker, nothing fancy. Seems to go best with Indian Cusine. Label says brewed and bottled in Sarasota Springs, NY."
"Drinkability : an average beer in the style Pale lager."
"Pours a clear golden yellow with a 1/2 inch white fizzy head that fades to nothing. No lacing whatsoever on this one. Smell is of grain and grass aromas. Taste is of grains, grass, and a bitter hop finish. Mild hop bitterness lingers on the palate after each sip. This beer has a high level of carbonation making it crisp and clean in the mouth. This is a pretty average beer overall but I am glad I picked up a single to try."
"I have this beer when I eat at the House of India in Huntington, NY. The bottle says it's brewed and bottled in Saratoga Springs, NY. It tastes fresh enough each time and is easy to drink. It has more character than a cheap adjunct lager - a clean taste of grains, a little grassiness, and a mild hop finish. I agree there's a slight metallic aroma, but overall this is a nice, average lager that goes well with a meal."
"I am not a Kingfisher fan. There is something funky in the taste that I quite dont like. The appearance is yellow, clear and has decent carbonation. The smell and taste are primarily grain mixed with water. Mouthfeel is fine. Overall the beer is drinkable and ususally all that is available whilst in India."
"Not terrible, but a little pricey given that it is, at best, a half notch above standard BMC type of stuff at a higher price."
"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was the cleaner finish. The flavors were a bit offensive to begin with, with pale adjuncts and metallic bite, but by the end of each sip, and by the end of the bottle, things mellowed out quite a bit. Ultimately, this would best serve its place accompanying a spicy meal of Indian food at a cheap corner restaurant."
"M/D - light to medium body, not watery. Easy to drink but not terribly complex. Interesting none the less as it's from India"
"Poured a 1"" head. Tan clear color. Smell is standard BMC. Taste is as well but it has a little more hops and acidic zing than the average BMC. Plus there's the whole unusual import thing going for it and when you combine that with the fact I'm drinking it in an Indian restaraunt I think that adds value."
"Bought a bottle at a local Indian restaraunt and served in a pilsner glass, the beer is a slightly hazy, pale yellow-gold color with increased levels of carbonation and a fluffy white, small bubbled layer of foamy head that quickly settles into a film. Aromas are roasted barley and oats, with a very slight sweetness. The beer is pretty watery, and the flavor is a slick, toasty sweet malt that quickly turns into a slight sour flavoring. Aftertaste is musty and sour, with not much else going for it. Finish is lingering and coats the mouth. Not tasty, but a good spicy curry dish wipes all of that garbage out of your mouth anyway."
"Overall: I expected better."
"Overall: Surprisingly nice use of hops, could be made that much better with more pronounced hops and a cleaner finish. As for mass-produced lagers though, you could do a lot worse."
"330 ml bottle, brewed in England, poured into pils glass, pale colour, pour head retention. Smelled of lemon washing up liquid. Tasted mainly of various ajuncts that go into big brand lager. Was ok to drink, I'd have it again with a curry but not with anything else."
"Light and bubbly on the palate, this beer doesn't bring much to the table, and I definitely wouldn't pursue it again, unless I found myself in India, where the options are admittedly limited."
"The taste is very lackluster! Really watery with some grainy notes. Hop bitterness is quite noticeable, and makes it a bit different from any other bland lager, but ultimately this is not a good beer."
"And the beer is...Kingfisher Premium Lager. Got the style right and looking at some other reviews it sounds like the skunked smell and taste is always there."
"A decent but unremarkable lager. I usually have this when eating a curry, and it's bland flavour pairs quite well with spicy food. A shade above other mass-produced lagers (which isn't saying much)."
"O - A lager fit for my drain, I was fooled momentarily thinking that my dog got some sort of treat with the eruptive spillage. Then I tried it and I felt sorry for her. She's sampled better. Much better."
"O: If this wasn't so skunky, I could see it actually being pretty decent. Unfortunately, that wasn't the case."
"pours a quarter inch white head very quickly fades to beer and a very light fading lace and lightly hazed golden color. herbal and metallic smell and taste. light malt grain and hop with strong herb front to finish and light metallic after taste. mouthfeel light and carbonation light also. good beer for a change of pace with a different lager taste and the price was right."
"O - Average, and maybe even a bit above for a macro brewery."
"http://abarwithnoname.wordpress.com"
"Typical clear and European lager in appearance/colour, with a decent white head. Crisp and delicious mouthfeel, if completely lacking the aroma and taste of hoppy American micro brews. An absolutely amazing beer to enjoy in India, but not one I'd ever choose back home."
"I went in with low expectations and the beer lived up to them, exceeding them slightly. This is chugging beer, plain and simple, not much different from any other pale lager, but good enough to be drinkable. I actually preferred it from the bottle - pouring it into the glass made things worse."
"Poured a slightly cloudy golden straw color with a little bit of head. Green bottle causes that skunky aroma that I can't get past. Taste is about the same, although slightly better than the smell. This beer has a smooth mouthfeel although I personally don't find it really drinkable. It's not bad, but I don't really like the taste that much."
"From notes from Old Chicago (2001) poured into pint glass. Poured pale yellow body with big head going down quite fastly. Well, aroma is pretty repulsive, dusty and malty. Flavor isn't that bad though, somewhat spiced, let's say interesting, but quite empty bodied. Finish is again worsen as flavor turns into something bland, fortunately short."
"If poured into a glass, you will be able to see straight throught this beer! I have never seen a beer so light in color before. It has the appearance of stale dishwater. As for the taste, it is watery and unappealing. The aroma is non existent except for a pungent odor that I have never encountered in a beer before. It has loads of carbonation and pours a very light color with a head that does not dissipate over time. This is a beer I would not recommend."
"P.S.: It should be noted that the example I'm reviewing is brewed under licence here in Australia. A sample from India may have elicited a different review."
"D - This beer is definitely drinkable and has some more flavor than the traditional macro lager beers on the market; I would probably choose one of these over the other beers on a menu that had a a lot of macros to choose from"
"I'd have this again I guess."
"Drank this one at a friends house, he had received it in a Beers of the World gift set. Pours a murky orange cold color into my pint glass. The nose is malty with just a hint of citrus. Tastes okay, but nothing special. It's a beer, but not one that I want to drink again. Mouthfeel is light body and low carbonation. It's drinkable, but not desireable."
"I am in India on business and this is one of the local beers. I have had this in the US at a few indian restaurants but these here far surpass the quality I have had at home. Incredibly smooth and refreshing and a superior lager. I am here for another week and am thinking this will be my mainstay."
"D-A drain-pour for me. The bits of unrecognizable ""stuff"" in the beer was too much for me. If it wasn't for that, i would have had trouble finishing it with the overpowering alcohol flavor."
"Overall I was pleasantly surprised. This is a good sessionable lager that pairs well with food. Nothing stellar but better than I've come to expect from this style."
"D: this one can go the distance"
"D - Perhaps I'm prejudiced due to my travels to India but this brew certainly complimented my spicy Indian meal. I'd have it again."
"D: I would certainly never seek this beer out, but I would certainly drink it if it was offered for free. Pretty standard light lager, though the slight bittering hoppiness on the finish adds an unexpected twist."
"Kingfisher is a beer I just randomly chose to try at a local bar. I have never had it before. Needless to say it wasn't anything impressive but it wasn't terrible either. The color of it was a light yellowish. The taste was a little harsh but still easy to drink. It tasted like a light beer with a bitter after taste. There really was no smell. Like I said the drinkability was surprisingly easy. If I had a chance to get it again I think I would."
"Pale is about right, rates a 4 on the SRM Chart. Initial head was about 1 finger and it went south in less than 20 seconds, leaving a light cover in the middle and broken, non clinging lace. Smells like light wheat bread, barley, and yeast. Intense flavor of clover grass, and roasted wheat. The hop finish just sort of hangs in the back of my throat on the soft palate. Good bite in my mouth but too heavy on the carbonation. I did not like this enough to really want to buy more, but I would drink one at a party if it was part of the free bar selection."
"Overall, a very light summer thirst quencher."
"Mouthfeel was fine--carbonated, but fairly smooth going down. Certainly put out the fire in my mouth from the hot Indian food I was eating. For that it had my gratitude."
"It has very plain aroma with more of a grassy smell if anything. The body was a golden color that was pretty flat as far as carbonation is concerned. There virtually no head but there was a nice tight white lace. The taste has a little bit of an odd bitterness at first but it mellows out to be very grassy. To me this beer wasn't bad but it was run of the mill. It has a light mouthfeel that makes it easy to drink on a hot day."
"Lucky number seven during Swill Tour 2010. The pour results in a pool of clear jaundice topped by some healthy white suds. The nose is like my brother's crappy incense, with some corn syrup and patchouli in the background. What incense, you ask? One of those bad combinations, like Jamaican Dread Sweat or Caribbean Jerked Taint. It is that bad. The taste is rotten wheat. Hookers fresh out of the tattoo chair. Vinyl and rubber burning alive, the victims of some crazed Saw-like serial killer's maniacal machinations. Terrible. I prefer the Olde English. The body is, natch, very light, with a light carbonation and a feel not unlike the forces amassed against Clive at Plassey (look it up...I'm pretty sure they were vicious). India ought to taste better. Seriously, even a lot of curry would make this taste better. Maybe this beer was aged to zombified perfection."
"The appearance is of a pale golden swill lager. Clear and no head to speak of. The aroma is a mix of dirty weed and body odor. I'm not sure of where the sugars come from, but it scares the hell out of me. The taste is of hints of spice mixed with human excrement. This is swill in the highest regards. There is so much unnecessary bitterness that it's hard to consume. Essential the taste is of unlaundered gym socks. The mouthfeel goes to the wayside due to the nastiness. It is undrinkable for me, period!"
"D: Again, I'm not sure how to rate this-- it's easy to knock back a couple of these, but... why? Like with Taj Mahal, if you've got some wicked-hot curry that needs taming, this will do the trick. It's just not that good of a beer."
"Drinkability: This was an ok beer to accompany the Indian food when dinner was served and the carbonation helped to freshen and clean the palate between portions of the Vegetarian Thali that made up the meal. But that being said there was nothing exceptional about the beer so it was adequate and better than no beer at all, but there's no motivation to repeat it or seek it out in the future."
"Taste is not very good, to say the least. Sweetness mixed with a bite that does not seem to be hop oriented, like a green banana peel. The nail polish remover flavor and smell is making this very tough to drink. And come to find out my bottle is not even brewed in India. Quoth an old Pace commercial: ""New York - that really chaps my hide"". Either way, this is a very poor lager and very serviceable...as a drain pour."
"Drinkability: Really not a terrible brew, definitely works on a hot day."
"Drink - Definitely an interesting beer that is worth a try. I can see how this might pair well with some spicy food."
"I poured into a pint glass, again, to a minimal white head. It is a clear, golden color. The aroma is sweet and grassy. I shocked that I'm not getting any skunky smell since it's in a green bottle. The taste is surprisingly fresh and clean. I get some grassy flavors. This beer tastes better than I remember from my last review. Maybe I was supposed to revisit this beer to appeciate it more. Or maybe not."
"Unlike most any other Indian foods this has no real colour, no fragrance, no taste or texture, no heritage or distinctiveness. It is completely out of place culturally and gastronomically from every and anything else you'd find at an Indian dinner table. Still, Kingfisher is nowhere near as bad as I remembered it being and, truth be told, it makes a perfectly acceptable adjunct lager... assuming you consider there is such a thing."
"D: Pretty drinkable, it was quite light on taste and abv and had a light taste to it."
"There is a rather stale sweet start on the tongue before hops take over to improve matters somewhat. The carbonation is unappealing. This is not a refereshing or interesting beer, but merely passable. I don't see myself buying another."
"Drinkanility: A tasty brew when served at the correct temperature. I was served this beer at an Indian restaurant in a forzen glass. Plus, the bottle was wicked cold. My first sips were insipid; however, as the sample warmed, I discovered wonderful flavors."
"Atmosphere is okay. Appearance is pretty solid, nose is non-distinct. Flavor is nothing exciting, but clean and unobtrusive. Overall, this is a pretty decent quaff."
"Drinkability: Very good with Indian food, and if there was nothing else I might give it a go, but otherwise nothing special."
"Drinkability- ok for a lager, I might possibly drink it again. Possibly a good summer beer because it is light and if it was cold definitely good summer working beer."
"Nothing about this is big necessarily, but I had no trouble packing away the 650. Drinks well."
"I bought a bottle because King Fisher sponsors a Formula 1 racing team which I am rooting for. I kind of expected another asian take on american pale lager and this falls in line with that. Overall I think that its a good choice within the confines of this style."
"O: A decent beer from India, surprisingly refreshing and clean tasting (unlike some of India's other beers like Haywards). Despite competition from Budweiser, Fosters and others, still India's largest selling beer."
"Has a decent quality to it, I would probably get it again at an Indian restaurant."
"OK for drinkability (see above)."
"I could put a few of these back if is was scorching hot out, but then again I might be better off reaching for some water."
"D: Low ABV and it goes down easy. You could pound these... The over all feel to me is plain APL, but to me it has more going for it than Bud.."
"D - Not at all drinkable. Not even my wife, who usually will drink the things that I can't deal with, could appreciate this stuff. Roughly 19 of the 22 ounces went down the drain."
"Pours a bright yellow with a good white head. Not much aroma, a little malt and metal smell. Taste is crisp and a bit bitter, a metalic twang to it. Not bad, actually adds a little to this otherwise very average lager. Its easy to drink and goes fine with Indian or Chinese food. It is what it is."
"Pours a light gold with a small white head. Aromas are predominately grainy, with a distant honeyish sweetness and grassiness. An unpleasant skunk, however, ruins these qualities for me. As far the taste is concerned, at best it could be described ""light"" or ""clean"" but it would be more honest to say that it is very bland, almost flavorless, and incapable of standing up to food of any sort. Even having it alone I can barely taste it. I cannot imagine having this beer again."
"Buy Again? Only when I want an Indian beer in when eating out."
"Appearance has a nice golden color with a less than fair head. Smell of grainy malt . Taste is a grainy corn, sweet metallic flavor with a light bitterness. Mouthfeel is light with good body and carbonation. The light bitterness sticks around a little to much for me to really enjoy."
"I would rather drink ten black-and-tans of Kaliber and O'Douls than drink one more of these horse-shit beers."
"More tasty than I would have expected. Brewing it locally instead of shipping it from India makes a Difference."
"Drinkability: Pass"
"Drinkability: Pass. Some lagers are good, some are bland but inoffensive, and some, like Kingfisher, as just unpleasant."
"The mouthfeel is very light and fizzy. Not my favorite, but I suppose that's how the style's supposed to be. As for drinkability...it washed down my goat masala, but next time, I'll probably just stick with Sam Adams, which the restaurant also had."
"Pours macro yellow with a very small, clear to white head. The aroma is basically non-existent with some slight malt and hop components. The flavor is basic macro but the aftertaste was very strange. It resembled the aftertaste you get when you eat pecans and cashews. There was no nuttyness in the flavor, it was simply that the aftertaste was similar to the aftertaste you get when eating those nuts. Very thin mouthfeel."
"Just not my cup of tea. Maybe not the freshest bottle, but I can't see this being a good beer regardless."
"D - Not too great unfortunately. I ended up pouring the last half out, the flavors don't really jive and the mouthfeel is uncomfortable."
"Undrinkability= just that, its water, go drink it if you like bud light, coors light, keystone, ect....my opinion, F stay AWAY NOT A GOOD BEER. (unless you like those beers then this is for you. everyone likes different beer. to each his own) like I said this just my opinion."
"Overall it's a serviceable beer, don't expect any great shakes obviously."
"I don't expect much from a beer from India and I guess I wasn't disappointed if I think of it like that"
"Mouthfeel/Drink: High carbonation. Light bodied. Easy to drink at summer time."
"I look at the bottle and I see India's Premium Lager. I can't say that I was thinking to myself, ""Man this thing is going to be awesome"" Aroma is skunky and just plain awful. Taste, although crisp and slightly pleasant is overall pretty dull. It's got corn, malt and then a horribly bitter aftertaste. I don't recommend this on to anyone."
"Overall. quite a refreshing beer but nothing to write home about."
"The taste is similar, fruity sweet grain with light but noticeable grassy, faintly herbal bitterness. It's slightly on the heavier side for the style."
"D- Goes down easy enough. Nothing seems like it will be too overpowering with time. Don't think I'll buy again though..."
"Nothing stellar, it is what it is, and what it is, is, good with head-expanding Indian spice. Or so my curry-racked brain seemed to think."
"Have to admit, I had my doubts when cracking this one open. But it surprised me as a very drinkable lager. Poured a clear amber with a moderate head that quickly faded to a collar. The aroma was a little skunky. The taste was crisp, clear and sweet. A nice lager taste. Feel is light bodied with light carbonation. The drinkability is good."
"This beer pours a clear golden color, carbonation is very evident. A two to three finger of rocky white head sits on top. Head retains quite nicely and leaves sheets of lacing on the sides of the glass. Nose is definitely of adjuncts - grains, light malt and a slight touch of hops. Taste starts with grainy malts, a touch of yeast with a finish that is somewhat sweet. There is a bit of hop presence as there is bitterness in the middle that sticks with you. Light bodied, high carbonation, thin, goes down easily. Certainly a beer that one can kick back for a while."
"Golden to pour with a steady head. Smells like any lager - grainy and hoppy. Tastes sweet at the back of your tongue with a blocking bitterness. Mouthfeel is obviously very light, typical of any beer of this genre. The quintessential Indian beer, very drinkable. Goes essentially well with curry and tandoori food."
"This beer pours a pale yellow hue with decent carbonation it doesnt have much of any smell at all apart from feint grainish notes,the taste is average and the mouthfeel is totally thin with no body at all,but in saying that this is definately my most favourite indian beer to have with a beautiful indian curry but apart from that leave it well alone unless its the only thing that can cool your thirst at the local curry takeaway."
"D: I'll probably order this again the next time I go for Indian food... it goes nicely with and generally provides a break from the rich and spicy Indian curries."
"Not a great beer, but clean enough tasting and not skunked despite the green bottle. This beer might not find its way into my shopping cart, but its fine every now and then with a spicy curry. Pours a fizzy golden with a head that fades away to a thin swirl while the bubbles keep coming. Very light aroma of some cereal grains and some lightly bitter hops. Not that sweet, which is nice. Tastes soft, slightly grainy, lightly but pleasantly bitter, and there is a light residual sweetness. Fairly pleasant for what it is- I've had many worse, and quite refreshing with that curry or on a hot day. Soft and slightly crisp in the mouth. You could do worse."
"Poured from a green bottle into a weizen glass. Has a golden color with small head. There is a very light grainy aroma. Taste is crisp and refreshing. Slighty sweet with a mild aftertaste. Feels somewhat watery in the mouth. This beer is very drinkable and a good overall selection"
"I found it very good, the equivalent of Becks. Just the right amount of hops."
"Drinkability: This beer drinks easily, but I don't know that I will again."
"D: Went wonderfully with the Indian food, though I'm not one to drink a bomber with dinner, so admittedly I wasn't thrilled about finishing the whole bottle."
"Had this in London at a curry place. had this on draft so my experience might be unique as i have not seen this on tap in the US , Went very good with the meal. nice color, no skunky smell. nice balance of crispness and hops. Not too carbonated, would drink again, but judging from the reviews, maybe the bottle doesn't travel well. Compared to beers like Singa and other Asian Heineken imitators, this lager is one of the better ones I have tasted."
"If you really want an Indian beer, try Cobra..I've only seen that in India though."
"Drinkability: OK to quaff, but not something to sit back and contemplate; probably pairs well with Indian food"
"It's not complex, it doesn't have a great deal of flavour, but then pale lagers should not anyway. Exceeded my expectations, definitely one of the better macro lagers."
"I've had Kingfisher before in Indian restaurants in both the US and the UK, and never had a problem. I suppose that Indian restaurants have a faster turn-over rate for this beer, hence it being fresher there. So, if you want to try this, have it in an Indian restaurant! But really, if you want an Indian beer, get Flying Horse instead."
"One weird thing though: They don't have a picture of a ""kingfisher"" on the front (any more). It's been replaced by a hummingbird, of all things."
"It looked alright and didn't smell terrible, but the strange taste was a deal-breaker for me. One who enjoys the green-bottled Heineken or Beck's might enjoy this, but I didn't. It didn't even go that well with my curry. I cannot recommend this one."
"Final Thoughts - It is rare that I find a beer that leaves me saying ""I'd rather have a Bud Light"" but this beer does it. The worst part is, you wouldn't think something with so little flavor could give off that kind of skunk. There is no way I would drink this beer again, or recommend it to anyone. If an Indian restaurant offers you this beer, say you'd rather have water."
"Nikki"
"drinkability: very easy. because of how light it was.did not cut my spicy food well at all"
"Tried at bottle last night at Rangoli Indian restaurant in Allston. Poured into a pint glass. No carbonation and no lacing. Small head disappears quickly. Hazy, opaque yellow color. Corn-like smell. Tastes like all other macro lagers, except this one is overly sticky sweet. Not that great, even with curry. A Bud would have tasted better. I only ordered it because we were at an Indian restaurant. One time deal, never again."
"http://foodbeertravel.wordpress.com/2009/01/12/delhi-best-pub-food/"
"It poured into the glass with a golden color and some slight head retention. It presented a grassy, maybe leafy aroma and tasted a little bisquity and overcarbonated. Considering I'm not fond of this type of beer (tasted just like Heineken) I would get buy a sixer of this beer."
"Pours medium, hazy yellow with minimal head. Aroma has some malt and light peppery hop notes. Flavor is very light with a slight mineral saltiness. A slight herbal hop flavor comes in on the finish. Very clean with virtually no aftertaste. Mouthfeel is crisp. Drinkability not bad. I'd drink this over the standard BMC offerings."
"Drinkability - Better then urine"
"Mouth: Is Fresh!, a gentile mouthfeel carbonation, the notes of hop and malt is soft, there is not bad to take some bottles under the summer day"
"Pours a hazy yellow color with an off-white head and little lacing. SKUNKTIFIED!!! Geez, I've never had a more skunky smelling beer. It can be smelled from 5 feet away. YUCK. I can't really taste anything while drinking it because the skunk smell is so awful. There some slightly sweet male malts and a very light hopping, but hops are evident, slightly herbal and earthy. Mouthfeel is crisp and dry. I really don't know how old this bottle is, but it doesn't matter. Why do breweries insist on still using green bottles? This is as close to a drain pour as they come. A few more sips and it may be going down the drain."
"The drinkability is excellent; sometimes I wake up and pour a tall glass of this while eating waffles and strudels."
"Easy to drink, especially when washing down a nice plate of curry but there are better Indian beers out there if you can find them."
"D= This was an ok macro style lager that paired well with spicy Indian food. If I was having this by itself I would have struggled to finish it."
"A decent lager - perhaps good for a hot day."
"VEry refreshing beer. Pretty bland, not enough hop bitterness for me to really wash down some spicey indian food. I prefer a pale ale of IPA for this type of cuisine not such a mediocre lager."
"D- Drinks good like beer should"
"Ok for a macro lager..but not a real heavy taste. Drinkable and goes well with spicey food."
"D - Not a bad macro lager all in all. I was pleasantly surprised by this offering."
"M: The mouthfeel is average (good). It is a light bodied beer with good carbonation. This beer drinks easily, as do much lagers."
"D: Maybe with another bottle the flavor might have rown on me but this lager is pretty run of the mill, or run of the brewery for that matter."
"It was a drinkable beer. Nothing spectacular about it. Nothing really negative about it. I recommend this with spicey food as it is good for cutting back the spicey aftertaste of food."
"Very drinkable, very undesirable."
"Overall, for the flavorful food I was having, this was a good beer. I was fortunate to get the pint before the first round of appetizers, so I got a clean sample, then one with spicy food. Alone, not so great. I doubt I would buy a six pack and sip a few for enjoyment. But with spicy food -- it is ok."
"An Indian beer brewed in NY. There's really nothing special to this. Golden-yellow color with a small white head. Aroma isn't the greatest, slight malt and skunk. Flavor is a little better, sweeter and more of a bite than some other lagers. Session swill here."
"I guess it's pretty drinkable as most lagers are. It's not horrible for sure."
"Light body, with a good amount of carbonation. Overall, not the worst, but lacking character."
"Not bad. No gold medals here, but not bad."
"Next..."
"lots of grass in the nose... has anice simple flavour format ... is refreshing in the simplest of terms ans has a nice bitterness level, decent ... not a bad brew but still completely run of the mill, but if you in india and this is all you got, then it might turn the key...hummingbird?"
"The line for the beer at the vendor was 10 minutes but I had to try everything there. They had 4 people at the registers doing nothing but selling beer, the sign said 'this lines beer only'. Yes ma'am! I would recommend it again because it really beats the heat on a hot day"
"The drink is crisp and light medium-bodied, and is very drinkable and refreshing."
"Light in body and very carbonated, I won't be having this one again."
"D: Drinkable although I don't know I would make an effort to find this beer again."
"Very fizzy, so it does a nice job of washing down a spicy meal. That's its only redeeming quality, though. Otherwise, its pale straw color, thin head, zero taste and zero aroma offer no compelling reason to drink it. As close to seltzer water as a beer can get."
"Drinkability> Made to be drank with spicy indian so easy to drink."
"Overall - Very plain and simple: not worth it at all! I got a large 650 mL bottle for $1.22 and I would not buy it again if it was only $0.22! I'd rather drink a Labatt blue than this crap. To tell you the truth, I could not finish the beer. I drank what I had to in order to finish the review, tried to gulp some down, and poured it down the sink. Then I refreshed my mouth with a nice glass of orange soda."
"Another run-of-the-mill euro pale lager. I just tried this one to say I have had a beer from India without any high hopes for it. Poured the usual pale lemonade color. Smelled of musty and skunky hops with a little spiciness. Taste was similar with a corn husk like palate and mild malts. Pretty fizzy on the tongue and not much better in the finish. Again, just to sample."
"Not a beer I would normally buy, but it went well with matter paneer and some garlic naan."
"This is the ""World's Number 1 selling Indian Lager"" according to the label, however, it's produced in New Jersey. It has a mild, somewhat pleasant taste. But it still has too much banana fruit flavor coming through, and I would forgo this in the future."
"Drinkability: Out in the sun on a 100 degree day, not bad. Otherwise, I'll have tea or soda."
"does this use rice or other adjuncts? if not, this almost seems like a euro pale lager or even a pils..."
"This isn't an especially drinkable beer. Essentially, it's just macro swill with no personality. I only tried it to see what a beer from India was like."
"An ok lager to my palete. Yellow gold in the glass with a frothy head which disapatted very quickly. Slight lemon lime nose. The beer had a crisp taste yet there are far more lagers with more flavour and crispness. Has anyone had it with indian fare? Would it standout with butter chicken or tikka masala? I'll have to find out and get back to you."
"Pours straw yellow with a thin, creamy white head. Some lacing sticks to the glass.The smell is of strong ""Euro-skunk", some husk,and sweet grain.The taste is husky and grainy with some ""Euro-skunk"" carry-over from the nose. Sweet with a bare touch of pretty non-descript hop bitterness. Not a big fan of the bland, sweet aftertaste.Light-bodied, though not overly fizzy. Not much to it though, either.I, ironically, preferred the ""light"" version, though I would not get either one again, personally. Maybe watering it down hid some of the bland sweetness and ""skunk"".A run-of-the-mill, at best, Euro-lager brewed right here in the USA (""under technical supervision of United Breweries Limited, Bangalore, India)."
"D= rather standard drinkability for what is probably in the ""table-beer"" class."
"Thin feel, a bit of fizz at the end. Since the flavors are weak, it makes drinking it a bit easier."
"Pours a light golden with a thin white head. Not much in the way of retention,but decent lacing. Smell is of Euro hops,and more Euro hops. Body is thin,and fizzy. Taste is hoppy,with a underlying sweetness,and a dry finish. Not the best representation of this style,but worth a try I guess."
"D-this is worth themoney of a six pack. Its a decent beer but not the best lager that i have ever had. Its a good beer but nothing to great."
"brewed in NY, from a ""Beers of the World"" mix"
"The taste is a little better than the smell would lead you to believe. But it is just lightly flavored macro. Weak malt, skunk, and wisps of hops would sum up this beer. Light bodied with abundant carbonation. I would definately pass on this beer in the future."
"D - Scored a 4 because you can drink these all day, and that's the problem..."
"Aftertaste is minimal but present. I'm glad I didn't buy a bunch of this brew because it is pretty disappointing."
"D = I would not under any circumstances order another one, though I might be willing to try a bottle and see if there was simply a problem with it on tap where I had it (though the lines on the Bud seemed fine, so I do not think that was the problem)."
"D - 3.5 - On par with the better american macro lagers"
"Drinkability - Not a bad macro-syle international lager, but drink it while it's cold."
"I have to say that I've had better versions of this style. Worth a try though but not worth $2.00 a 12oz bottle."
"Pours a straw yellow with a one finger white head that quickly dies down to just about nothing. No stickiness to speak of, pretty sad looking beer. Smell: one word, Heineken, but stronger. Taste is pale noble hops and buttery flavors. I don't see myself finishing this one. Is it skunky or just how this should taste? Either way, drain pour."
"Overall: Watery and characterless adjunct lager. On the bright side it can be quite refreshing. Better than the others beers from India that I have already tasted."
"D: Not very tasty, doesn’t go down too easily, not filling at all which is about the only good thing I can say about it, if were going to drink a beer that tasted like this I would prefer to spend very little money and drink something that I know isn’t supposed to be very good."
"Poured a pale yellow with about a half inch head. Mild carbonation remained throughout. I was pleasantly surprised by the sweet fruit tones and lemony/citrus hop flavor. Nothing overwhelming here, but after the fairly awful Taj Mahal, this was welcome."
"I found the smell agreeable with malt, barley, grain of some sort, nothing too skunky. A dry, hoppy taste and mouthfeel with a crisp, clean lager finish. The body is a bit thin, but that's pretty typical. Overall, this is better than typical, I agree with jettjon, and with the more recent reviews of Kingfisher, this beer was likely reformulated or quality control has been improved."
"Overall: Pretty good beer to drink on a summer day. I am not overly impressed, nor am I overly disappointed. It is about what I expected."
"Yet another exotic standard lager. A Wiessbier would have suited the Tandoori dish better."
"Note: The bottle stated that this beer is brewed in Saratoga Springs, NY."
"Flavorful but not overpowering. A bit like a quality German lager, only not quite as good. Better than I would have expected from an Indian brewer, for some reason. I could down a few of these without a problem."
"I tried this beer on September 4, 2007 after purchasing it from my local LCBO. This was one of the worst beers I have ever tasted. It poured into the glass smoothly with a small white head. The colour was a translucent gold with TONS of effervescence. The aroma was putrid...too much like budwesier. The mouthfeel was very thin and watery, none of the carbonation as seen in the glass. The taste was very reminiscent of North American pale lagers as well..."
"D-Pretty drinkable....with indian food. I would never choose this for a relaxing drink, but it served it's purpose well."
"Green 12oz bottle with no visible date of bottling poured into a pint glass. Pours a golden yellow color with a small white head. The aroma is quite nice with some malt and grassy hops. The taste mimics the aroma with some malt and a spicy and grassy hop finish. Mouthfeel is light and well carbonated. Overall, this is pretty much what I am looking for from a lager. This is a highly drinkable and tasty brew that is recommended."
"Drinkability: Kingfisher is a tiny step-up from the average macro lager and it does a good job of rescuing those like me with acid reflux from Indian food."
"Anyway -- it does exactly what it's supposed to do, which is counterbalance the spiciness of the cuisine. No real adjuncty notes in the aroma or flavour, which is good. Colour is pale, but not sickly. Carbonation is very high but, again, it's supposed to be to clear the ""hot"" from your palate. Honestly, in the category of American Macro Lagers, I'd probably rather have this one than most others. And it was great to drink it in its homeland!"
"Not really so sure why I picked this one up. Probabaly because I had not seen it before, which is the reason I pick up most of my brews. Anyway, hell it was worth a shot right? Poured a dull golden yellow. Small fizzy white head quickly faded leaving only some token lace behind, which iteslef left leaving a dull non carbonated yellow liquid. Smell was musty and grainy, with no really depth too it. The taste followed suit, dull, maybe a tiny bit of bitterness, but otherwise pretty non descript. Decent light mouth feel and a easy drinking are about it on this one. Served cold could be a session beer, but I would rather have it as a forget it beer. Nothing really to see move on."
"D - This is a fairly typical American Macro Lager. It is better than their light beer."
"D-in the end this is an alright beer, doesn't offend and it doesn't thrill. I suppose this is one of the better Indian beers available so if I were at an Indian Restaurant I would probably choose this."
"Overall a regular lager. Slight hint of hops in aroma, pours a clear yellow. It tastes a little bit of hop flavor and nice balance of bitterness to the malts. Nothing special about this lager, but I wouldn't mind having it on tap in Bangalore, India. Leaves a hint of hops in aftertaste."
"D: Goes down smooth. This is actually one of the better macro lagers I've had. Much more all-around taste than the standard BMC beers. I had it with Indian food and it the taste still came through all of the curry spices. Certainly wouldn't buy it to have at home but it's not a bad option at an Indian restaurant."
"This one is a little hoppier than others in the style, but it's still relatively flavorless and plain."
"MF- grippy, stingy"
"would pass if Ice cold and i was in India and couldn't get anything else beer wise...but seeing as I'm not in India...pass"
"I'm amending this because I'm now having ANOTHER terrible one and overall I've just had TOO many bad examples and the reader (if there is one for my dribble) deserves to know what they're getting into. If you get one that's been handled badly? It tastes like vinegar. Wow. Just undrinkable. Really, really, retchingly horrible. Makes me want to do a shot of formaldehyde to cleanse my palate."
"Tastes alright - not good, not horrible - definitely better than it smells or feels. Somehow I doubt they use only the ""finest malted barley and hops"" as it screams corn/rice at me. I wouldn't go out of my way for another, but I wouldn't turn down a cold free one if I was thirsty."
"This beer tasted rather light with tones of malt up front. There were some faint hints of caramel and some sweetness in the flavor. The malt was followed up by a slight hint of dry hop flavor in the after taste. It seemed to be very balanced and medium bodied. Decent offering that went down easy. Tasted good with the buffet of Indian food we ate. This brew certainly provided a good mouth feel and a decent flavor. It is very drinkable and would be a decent beer to try again. Not the worst American Macro I have had before. It certainly captures the style."
"Had on-tap at an Indian Curry House (Dec 2011), a lot better when taken with a hot dish, as I intimated in my original review. Not altered the scores, just letting anybody/everybody know it isn't as bad as my score indicates!"
"Had this at an Indian restaurant one night, first thing I noticed was that it was brewed in Saratoga Springs, NY. Pours a golden yellowish color, somewhat hazy. A one finger white head with good retention. Not a whole lot of nose going on here, some faint malt. Taste upfront is tangy and some mild hop bitterness. I found this be a rather pleasant and drinkable beer. Certainly not something I would seek out but would order again if at an Indian restaurant."
"Poured the bottle into a glass mug. A nice, light appearance with a thick white head that kind of had a soap-suds look to it, similiar to Corona. The head was well retained throughout the beer with some decent lacing. A interesting, malty smell that reminded me very much of an American Macro (interestingly enough, while claimed to be from India, it was listed as brewed and bottled by an American company; not very pleasing to me considering it came in a ""Beer from around the world"" sampler I picked up). A smooth, malty taste with a sweet aftertaste. I did not know what to expect here, but it was similiar to Bud mixed with Miller Lite. It was an okay mouthfeel but wasn't overly impressed. Pretty drinkable if you're in the mood for or just prefer a beer with an American Macro flair."
"I suppose this would be ideal with a hot curry but by itself, it's not very good. Perhaps I'll pair with food next time and give another opinion."
"Good to drink with a curry, but it just doesn't stand up to the test on its own."
"D - Pretty standard lager, could drink a fair amount but get bored very easy."
"This is a typical American macro. On the bottle it said it was brewed and bottled in New York. Served in a pint glass at an Indian restaurant in the village. Gold with half-inch head. Smelled skunky and tasted skunky, similar to Heineken, but not as good. It was easy to drink though, but after a few you'd probably get bored. Skip it."
"Pours to a dark golden color with thin off-white head, and some lacing. Has the typical grainy aroma, yet not to the point of skunky, like many cheap import lagers. Taste was light and decent, with no real outstanding aspect, and the finish was slightly bitter, yet smooth. Overall, this was better than many of its brethren Ive had."
"Enjoyed this one with some Bengal lentils I whipped up for the Ohio St-Iowa game tonight. Pours a handsome clear golden without more than a cap of head but plenty of visible carbonation. Nose is fresh with yeast but mostly contains sour adjuncts. Taste is dry and has a chunk of chasing bitterness but it's not as clean as I'd normaly like although decent for cleaning up extra turmeric and ginger from the palate. The spicier the food, the better this will hold up. Mouthfeel is ordinary at best; too many bubbles that hinder the already injured taste. Good for curry, chutney etc but not really for everyday consumption"
"A light yellow color, with visible carbonation and eight of an inch white head. The scent of roasted barley, with a touch of hop aroma. The taste is pretty bland, the flavor of the barley is evident, but nothing to spectacular. Watery in the mouth, the carbonation leaves a tinglingsensation on the palate. Nothing to great, a below average beer."
"Drinkability: I'll pass, thanks. I've had three Indian beers now and none of them have been at all impressive - for the sake of the subcontinent, I hope it's just that the good stuff isn't being imported."
"Opinion: Well, I was pretty disappointed in this beer. From the appearance to the flavor, this beer leaves a lot to be desired. The sad part about it is (I believe) that these are no defects due to handling or age, but in the processes at the brewery. It may be too alkaline of water, but I think that it is over sparging. The result of pinching the pennies too tight. I suggest drinking something else."
"Kingfisher Lager is Indian beer contract brewed in New York. It pours a light orange with a white head from a green twelve ounce bottle. It has a fairly nice aroma, citrusy and a bit of malt. Not too bad flavor wise, nice hoppy touch, decent malt flavor as well. Somewhat grainy too. Better than I expected, I'd take this over b/m/c."
"Overall not one i doubt i will ever get again, but not a horrible beer."
"D: Overall, not really my cup of tea, but it's quite nice for a macro. I wouldn't buy a sixpack, but if it was offered to me I'd certainly drink it."
"It was quite pale (which is to be expected) with very minimal head. The flavor wasn't too bad, it tasted a lot like premium American lager, with an interesting flavor at the backend. A little more bitter I suppose. The best quality was how it is engineered to be eaten with the indian dish. The beer and the dish went very well, and while the flavor isn't anything special, and in fact quite ordinary, it goes very well with the meal, which is it's designated purpose and I found it to be not a bad brew when I eat indian. I'll be sure to order another next time I'm out!"
"I could drink a bunch of these physically, but mentally I might burn out around 3 or 4. Not too bad with a good meal. It wouldn't fair as well alone."
"This is an unpretentious macro lager that is a passable drink but certainly not one I would seek out with enthusiasm"
"D - Alright I guess. Not good, not bad. Easy drinking."
"Drank this stuff like water during my 10 days in India. It's not bad. Has an entertaining sweetness to the malt that makes a welcome appearance towards the end of the taste spectrum. Good drinkability and above average taste for a macro lager. Reminds me of PBR. It's probably the best beer you'll find in the country."
"....Fast bland lightly sweet but clean flavor, a wee bit of lemony hop mixed with drying brewers rice tastes and overpowering carbonation...fast dry clean finish. A very bland, dry rice beer tarted up with some pilsner aromas"
"Actually there's nothing revolting about this beer at all. It's just an average, run of the mill macro lager."
"All in all, this is certainly no better than any Euro Lager I've ever had, very similar to Grolsch in many respects, but without that great swing-top bottle..."
"Pours a clear golden, medium fluffy white head, some lacing and decent retention. Smell is skunky, sweet malt and citrus, vanilla. Taste is malty, with some skunk, citrus, and grains. Mouthfeel is light bodied with low carbonation. Not bad other than the skunk, refreshing."
"Drinkability/Overall: Not a bad brew. Would go down a real treat with some butter chicken on a hot day."
"The taste was mild and, again, just a lttle citrusy. Richer than most macros but still somewhat watery and then a fairly fast finish, and done."
"I'm amazed to discover that Kingfisher Lager is 'the best selling Indian lager world-wide' and is now brewed by 17 breweries around the world. This particular bottle was brewed in Saratoga Springs, NY. I've had a bottle or two with Indian food in the past and wasn't impressed. Solo, it's even less impressive. Bottom line: avoid unless dehydrated."
"Surprisingly complex for a lager. Atleast there aren't many lagers that I've tasted that are available in this area that display as many characteristics as Kingfisher. The lack of head retention, mild aroma and metallic twang at the finish hold it back some, but it's still one best lagers I've had available in this area."
"Very similar to a Budweiser, golden straw color, little head or carbonation. Corn smell and taste. Not a bad aftertaste. Easy to finish but nothing exciting. For a beer from India, it's better than most imports from non-German or Belgium coutries."
"I used to drin this all the time in Atlanta in my fav Indian in Little Fives, I was impressed then, though I'm far from impressed NOW its still a good lager IMO."
"Very clean and grainy taste. Grass, rice, barley and corn flavors mostly with a slight hop snap on the finish. A rather neutral tasting beer that would probably work well with a variety of different foods."
"My advice: Hold your nose. Pour it into a glass. Leave the room. Breath. Come back in 5 minutes to let the skunk aroma disipate. After that, it's a drinkable beer. Not great, but drinkable. It has the solid straw color with good carbonation and a small lacing head. Tastes mildly sweet with barley, corn, and rice distinctively. Hop flavor and aromas are of the noble hop variety, but skunked through the green bottle. Carbonated to the mouth and lacks a bit of creaminess. Subtle apple fruits in the finish. Crisp and moderately dry. Weak and slightly bitter aftertaste."
"It's got the look of a great beer without the taste. Somewhat bland and rather generic in it's overall taste. It pours a golden color with intense carbonation. Not much to detect scent-wise. The taste is more like a medium-bodied pilsener. Nothing extraordinary or overtly complex. It goes down smoothly, but not very enjoyable. I wouldn't have more than 2 of these in one sitting, but it does pair nicely with Indian food and it's a summer beer because of it's hoppy presence."
"Smells citrusy and floraly, nothing too deep or complex. Tastes similar, with a good bite of lemon in there- reminded me of Heineken, but a better tasting one. Mouthfeel is on the watery side and not the most pleasant thing in the whole wide world. However, very drinkable. I would much rather drink this than Bud- it's not attacking to the palate, it's light, easy to drink, and the taste is not offensive at all."
"An excellent macro brew, and a decent beer."
"Having tasted this beer in various corners of India, as well as in Europe, both on bottle and on tap, I have to say that the taste varies a lot. It probably falls back on the quality of the water source. At best Kingfisher lager is a pretty drinkable beer, at worst it can taste like ditch water. That said, it's a South-Asian equivalent of Heineken or Carlsberg lager, dependable but not very exciting. In the bars of Bangalore or the posh restaurants around Delhi's Connaught Place Kingfisher tastes fine. But in the north-Indian Ladakh region where only two brands of beer are available in the market, Kingfisher is thouroghly defeated by Devan's Modern Breweries' blessed Godfather Super Strong High Power Beer"
"enjoy with a vindaloo or rogan josh"
"Clear yellow with a fizzy head for a lace. The smells is very clean. Faint hops and grainy malt. A oily hop up front and background of slighty grassy grains. Finishes very clean and is light of the palate. This is a nice average lager to keep around for cookouts on hot summer days."
"Pours a very pale straw color with a nice tight head that fades away pretty quickly. Has a slight flowery/yeasty aroma. There's some hop flavor in it, overriding the very weak malt flavor, finishing with a lingering bitterness. Actually, quite refreshing. Especially with indian food (chicken korma + masala rice). Mouthfeel is a bit thin and watery. Overall, it's pretty drinkable, not a bad brew at all."
"Bottle. Pours clear bubbly gold with very little white head that mostly dissipates quickly leaving just a footprint of foam on top. Fruit hop and sweet malt aroma with soapy notes. Malt flavor to start with a hoppy finish and a tad spicy. Light bodied and fizzy palate, crisp and refreshing."
"Not the best of lagers. I won't return for a second glass of this. Perhaps the trip from NY to AZ was too much and it would be better closer to the brewery?"
"Taste is not bad. Good hops, no malt taste, grassiness and faint copper tinge to it. Refreshing on a hot afternoon; would go nicely with spicy food."
"In need of something to review, I picked up a green bottle of this ""Indian"" brw which is actually brewed in the states. No freshness dating. Pours light clear amber, typical white head and minimal lacing. Not much taste or interest here, mostly adjuncts account for the lack of malt notes. Best that can be said here is that this washed my sandwedge down nicely and cut through the tahini sauce."
"A small, white, bubbly head sits on the clear, clear gold beer. Just a touch ambery. Sweet corny nose with some sugary sponk. Major corn in the front. A little spicy... maybe even cinnamon. Middle is tangy with major sweet corn sugar. Some nice bitterness in the end with some grainsy crackers. It's not bad. The hops save it in the end from being completely nondescript."
"pretty decent beer and i cant argue with the statement on the label as it being the best indian lager. its the best ive had!"
"Pours a pale gold with a wispy little head and a tiny bit of lace. The aroma is a a pleasant mix of cereal grains and a faint yeast skunkyness. The taste is worse than the smell. Some light maltiness and wet paper come together with an all too faint hoppiness. The moouthfeel is thin and 'pastuerizey'. This is nothing more than an average adjunct lager. Its also not even brewed in India."
"After a sip, had to wash out my mouth. Even after toothpaste, terrible taste remained. Not a good ambassador. Looks like watered down beer, dry, bitter, thin with awful carbonation. Maybe grass and hops, thin. Goodbye beer, hello drain. Useful for inducing nausea."
"Stay out of sight with this one. Truly a terrible beer."
"Beer is good. Happy beering."
"Pours a clear pale gold under a 1.5 finger white head that settles quickly to thick film. There's a strong grainy skunk nose, typical of a macro lager. The mouth is very pirckly and light. The taste starts with standard adjunct malt and skunky hops. There's a slightly sweet moment, followed by a fairly substantial metallic hoppy bite. The bite is stronger than most macros would produce, and lasts a bit longer, pushing this beer just slightly, ever so slightly, above average."
"I agree with the label that is it ""Most Thrilling Chilled""."
"Along the lines of the standard euro pale lager"
"Thx"
"The beer pours a pale gold color with a thick frothy white head that fades to lacing. The aroma is decent. It boasts of mainly pale malts and lager yeast, but it comes across as light and refreshing. The taste is a little above average. It is light with a grainy pale malt flavor on top of a dry lager yeast finish that refreshes on the way down. The mouthfeel is good. It is a low bodied beer with good carbonation. This beer drinks easy, but it has nothing to brag about. It does a lot right, but not a lot more than others. Still, this is a decent lager."
"I happened upon this beer at the Fancy Food Show in New York City. I have seen it many times in liquor stores, but never thought much of it. Well, I am not one to pass on free samples of beer and this booth was giving away full bottles. Not a bad sample , huh? Needless to say I was very surprised at the taste. It has a noble hop aroma and a taste that was crisp and refreshing. It is better than I thought it would be. Still not something to go out of your for, but for free, it is great."
"Part of a ""Beers of the World"" package received as a Christmas gift but comically enough this is brewed in New York state. A nearly opaque color that poured a fine head that disapated quickly. There is almost a sweet alcohol smell to this brew. Not a bad taste considering all. A sweet beginning ends up with a decent hop finish. This is an extremely thin beer but a drinkable one."
"It pours a golden color with a thin, fast fading head. The aroma is mostly of cut grass and corncob with a trace of metallic scent. The light-bodied sweet malt is a bit grainy and lightly herbal. A mildly spicing hop bitterness peeks through, as does a hint of alcohol. Mellow, Smooth & Sweet. OK on a hot day."
"Drinkability: Glad I didn't let the skunk drive me away at the get go. Not a beer I would seek out again, but I'd have one if it was offered to me. Boring, but nicer than most all of the macros!"
"pours a light but healthy golden colour, evocative of heineken or peroni or the like. the smell is just bad...at first. smells of sulfer and skunkiness. thankfully, this cleared out almost entirely after a couple of minutes. the taste here was pretty standard for a pale lager: minimal overall hop/grain taste that was kind of watery. unlike the smell, there was no skunk flavour here. mouthfeel was quite smooth overall but a bit too highly carbonated the smell was what really turned me off here. otherwise, this is a pretty average brew."
"Sinkability  Yes, this is going down the drain."
"A lager lager. Pale gold color, small head. A light bodied lager. Light malts and hops. Light flavor, nearly sort of bland, but well-balanced and nice taste. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly bitter. An OK lager, but there is a touch of green bottle skunyness."
"Doesn't work for me. The smell of clean laundry is a wonderful thing - but not in your beer."
"The mouthfeel is inturuptingly annoying. This is an easy beer to drink therefore I would not turn one down for free if there were not any better beers around that I could pay for."
" This is a pleasant enough European style lager. It’s not very bold, but considering the climate of its country of origin – it probably hits the spot quite nicely there. It would probably do quite well alongside a plate of chicken vindaloo, or simply as a companion on a hot summer day."
"This beer poured a small white head that contained small-medium sized bubbles.The body was clear and there was no lacing with this beer.This beer's nose was hoppy.There is nothing very special about this beer in my opinion.I found it to have a somewhat of a bitter taste to it and it is a beer that went down rather smoothly."
"This brew poured a small white head of small to medium bubbles which left a small lacing as it receded. It body is a transparent light amber orange color. It's aroma is a mild hoppy one and it's taste is a bit carbonated and like a typical lager with a slight bitter aftertaste. There is nothing really noteworthy here, but it is a good all around drinkable brew."
"A tasty brew when its fresh and not skunked. My local Indian restaurant seems to about the only one that can manage that trick."
"Came in a green 330ml bottle. The back label said to see the neck for a freshness date, but there was none to be found. It's a nice golden colour, but upon closer inspection I could spot a fair amount of yeast sediment suspended in it (so much for a clear lager). Nose is too faint for me to pick up. Taste is quite hoppy, and leaves an astringent aftertaste."
"Very good summer session beer. Light, easy drinking simple beer."
"This is a fairly confusing beer. It says in one spot that it indias best selling beer, but it appears to be brewed in new york. The color is a pretty pale straw color, fluffy white head. Pretty similar to other green bottle beers, not as skunky as the european ones though. Actually a bit of hops somewhere in there. Didnt rock my world"
"Nice, colorful labeling notes that this is brewed under supervision from India and references Saratoga Springs, New York."
"Among the Indians I know this beer is not highly regarded, Golden Eagle is considered to be a much better beer. According to them, this version is quite similar to the domestic product brewed in India."
"Very pale gold color with a whispy white head of medium bubbles and 10 second duration. No lacing. aroma is slightly corny but with a slight sense of hay and yeast. Flavor is fall-down in quality to my tongue, sparsely malty and slighly phenolic and off-putting sharp astringeny at the finish, almost like white vinegar. Not much body to speak of and unsettling in the manner of too much carbonation. Nothing here to see folks, especially at ""premium"" prices..."
"Pours a super-pale straw with little aroma. Light and fizzy, with some carmel malt and green apple notes. Although an Indian beer, it is brewed in New York, and is not particulary distinguishable from other U.S. lagers - Rolling Rock came to mind. Nothing terrible about the brew, it just fails to make any noteworthy statement."
"This lager poured a light golden color with tall, white foam, and medium carbonation. The smell was sweet. I could not put my finger on this sweet aroma: malt? corn? I am not sure, but the smell was rather pronounced, and not altogether unpleasant. The taste was thin, and had the same sweetness that I detected in the smell. There was a mild, but pleasant hop character. The mouthfeel was on the thin side, but was clean, with mild carbonation. The drinkability was OK. I had this beer while eating in an Indian restaurant, and it went well with the spicy food."
"Available at all Indian restaurants, this beer is the definition of a fizzy white beer. However, I must say this brew does pour a solid golden hue with a decent head. It does it's duty in pairing with some really spicy Indian dishes, and according to my roomate from last year, Chaitanya it's the only thing drinkable in his hometown of Bangalore. A very sweet corn and rice filled aroma, this beer is definitely swill, but it is swill I would rather pay for than our swill here Bud, Miller, Coors. When I went to eat with my exroomate at an Indian restaurant in Pittsburgh, PA he said it doesn't taste the same as it does back home, in fact I think it's brewed somewhere in New York. Overall, very light bodied and drinkable. It has a sweet crisp lemon grass finish that goes very well with the food I have eaten with it. So, this one's for you Chai!!!"
"Tried this one in an indian food joint... not too good. A light bodied lager. Pale gold color, small head. Light malts and hops. Light flavor, nearly sort of bland, but well-balanced and nice taste. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste somewhat skunky."
"Pours a slightly hazy medium golden color with a think and creamy white head that slowly dissipates into a nice lace. Nose is sweet malts and yeast. Light to medium in body with a nice crispness. Taste is fresh grains with some citrus notes and a nice amount of spicy hops. A very refreshing brew that is definitely a step up from the macros."
"A small pale white head sits atop a very pale yellow body. Aroma is zesty and clean, slight hints of citrus, sea-foam and straw. A dry, hoppy play upon the tongue and mouth, with a short, but nice finish. Light in body, texture, and just about every other way. Compared to other lagers of this type, it's one the best. Just enough flavor to make it palatable, but it's real purpose is to wash down the heat of hot and spicy food and keep those tastebuds cooled for the next onslaught. If you want boldness in body and flavor, you're barking up the wrong Bodhi tree."
"The beer pours a crystal clear gold color, the head brilliant white, average in size with a frothy consistency with fair lace to coat the glass. Malt nose, the start is slightly sweet, top cadaverous, finish is bitingly acidic, sparsely hopped, dry aftertaste. Not much to redeem this beer in my eyes and palate, but One persons trash is anothers treasure."
"This is really not a good beer at all. Weak yellow color with virtually no head or effervescence. No aroma. Insipid, uninspired dry grass flavor. I poured most of this one out."
"The product itself overall was poor...the colour was very light and the head was non-existant. There was no substance to the body as it was very watery. The taste was hollow...well balanced but hollow."
"And here I thought I was getting a beer from India!? It's actually brewed in Sarasota Springs, NY! The twist off cap should have been a dead give away! Upon opening a skunky aroma emerges before you can even pour the clear, yellowish gold body topped by a full foamy bright white head. The head drops quickly leaving a decent collar and some spotty lace. The body is light/medium with a fine, moderate carbonation that leaves it lightly crisp in the mouth. The flavor is of a clean malt that's well infused with a light grassy hop flavor and moderate bitterness. It finishes with a mild herbal hop flavor and gentle residual bitterness. Reminiscent in many ways of Heineken, but lighter all around. Actually somewhat refreshing, giving it a little bit of drinkability. Certainly more engaging than a light beer. And if it weren't for the skunkiness it might score even better."
"Tried this one in an Indian restaurant. Nice appearance (gold color) and nice smell. This beer has some great glasses that add to the enjoying of the beer. Definitely to be enjoyed with spicy foods"
"clear golden color, little head and no lace.   a very pleasant aroma of graininess and hops.  not unlike a euro lager...but not necessarily skunky.  a nice malty flavor, followed by some soft hops to balance.  i found this very appealing for a lager and very refreshing.  i've mentioned this before, but why in the hell can't american macro brewers try to brew something close to this?"
"Well balanced and very drinkable!  A pleasant surprise."
"Id pass on this one."
"I am pleasantly surprised. I can understand why some people like this beer. Upon opening the bottle, there was a definite skunk smell. but once I poured it it dissipated and gave way to a decent eurolager aroma that was not overly skunky. Nice clean flavor that balances malt and hops in a way that makes it easy to drink. Refreshing dry finish with a little sweetness on the tongue to make it special. This is an alright beer. I'd buy it again."
"Brewed by Kingfisher Brewing Co. in Saratoga Springs and they get technical supervision from United Breweries in Bangalore, India.  This is too far away to make any difference and this native brew is pale as old Harry, skunky smell, good head but bland taste."
"I guess the one thing and thing only that saved this beer is that it is brewed in the US and not India. Still a mediocre brew, I would not turn it down if someone offered it to me."
"Kingfisher: A relatively popular import from India.  Very light green bottle, with a faint and pleasant aroma of yeast.  The taste is not dramatic, at all, but does have a nice closing tang of hops that really redeems this beer, at least on a very hot July evening.  Not bad."
"Straw colored with a quickly-dying white head. A little more bitter than other American lagers, and also more complex. It would be easy to put away a bunch of these at a sitting."
"Golden yellow with thin head.  Fizzy with crisp malt flavor followed by a very pleasant hop fruity bite.  Finishes a little grainly and bitter.  Good with my spicy Indian food."
"I'm just underwhelmed with this beer. I was expecting something quite a bit better based on all the raves of my Indian friends. It'll hit you hard and it'll dampen the burn of Indian food. It's not worth ruining a meal over though. I'll take a Budweiser over this easily."
"Quite bland, but its easy to drink. Good for a hot day i suppose. But i'd probably look elsewhere first."
"A great beer to pair with Indian food, although I prefer Taj Mahal.  Some nice malt flavor, little, if any noticable hop content.  But again, go with it when eating Indain cooking."
"Aah...knocked back plenty of these trying to wash down the dust of Delhi. Refreshing when ice cold, pleasantly balanced when it warms a bit."
"Notes: There was a card on the table that went into some interesting detail of this brew. I wrote it down, and it goes as follows: ""A time when a strong, smooth beer was needed to quench the thirst and beat the heat in Hindustan, India [snip] ... high gravity lager is kept in copper urns for over 2 months. Copper stimulates the yeast and imparts its flavour in the beer."""
