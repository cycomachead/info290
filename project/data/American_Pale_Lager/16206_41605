Some sweet tasting malt character. Tastes light & refreshing with a nice crisp hop bite. A tad too sweet to be an excellently rounded beer but the eveness is mostly there. A great session beer clocking in at only 4.5% ABV. Surprised to see this classified as a Kolsch. Always figured it was a hoppy pale ale.

Nose brings forward a pretty strong grainy presence along with a slight amount of Noble hops, though not enough of the latter to really call this a pilsner. The flavor is mildly fruit with a bit of grain and some mild Noble hops. Fairly chewy, though still a bit light. Carbonation is moderate, though it seems like it should be a bit higher. Light body. Drinks pretty well overall. My guess is either a kolsch or a Munich Helles. Going with the former given the fruitiness and lack of true "bready" flavor.","Thorpe429","0"

Not much of a cap off of the spout and once it reached me there was nothing, not a very good looker, no cling. Scents include pale malt heavy, some faint apple and well, thats it. Taste is laid back, if this is a kolsch, it's not a very good one. I remember thinking this was a biere de garde, but I could be wrong. Pale malt without the sweet caramel and light apple juice like tastes, nothing in terms of hop flavor, just a small earthiness. Feel is a step above light and not very carby, this just goes down kinda dead like, bottles seem to be a bit livlier. This is not a beer that i'll be getting alot.

More of a corn smell than anything else. Taste is bitter and a little dry. Some corn husk, lemon zest and grassy hops. Mouthfeel is fluid but there is certainly some weight on the tongue.

Appears a slightly hazed golden hue in the body with fine haziness suspended in the glass, full on thicket of bright white head forms nicely. Lacing is sporadic on my hop tulip pint glass from Sierra Nevada, aroma has a slight metallic hint to it with a nice mellow citrus playful malt and hop ratio. Flavor has a nice zesty citric hop mix going with some light toasted malts it has a light IPA flavor going on with the massive amounts of alpha acids from American hop additions. Mouthfeel is dry in the finish a nice unrelenting hop bitterness in a lighter styled brew, carbonation is sturdy even a bit much at times overall feel is a solidly dry hoppy finish that brings the hop burps cooking. Drinkability overall just due to the flavors provided and enjoyment of the product is very high. Add the sessionability to your drinkable score and this one rises substantially.","WVbeergeek","Apr 24, 2010"

It has positive characteristics of an all-malt lager, pilsener and american wheat all in one.

Floral and lemon hops were prominent in the aroma, backed by some citrus sweetness and cereal grains. Balanced flavour. Bitterness was light, but stayed solid underneath the malt until the sweetness faded, leaving it to linger in the finish. Lemon hops up front, a bit floral, with a hint of spice. A bit biscuity and bready, but not overly so. Light bodied with ample carbonation, crisp and on the dry side. More powerful in character than I expected, this one has a solid hop presence.
