The smell also has yeast notes and a bit of a light hop profile that create a bitter banana smell. The beer taste is similar to the smell but that the notes are stronger and that hops are more noticeable than in the smell. The beer is very refreshing but a little sticky. The beer has a very light body and very smooth. It also has very little carbonation. Overall, a pretty good beer worth getting.","HattedClassic","Aug 25, 2014"

Strong all-around and about as good of a representative of the style as one can hope to find, this might be the beer that Boston Beer Co. had in mind before brewing their ponderous Alpine Spring seasonal. Balance is struck here, with easy fluid qualities scaling well to significant hops and unobtrusive yet defining malt.","beagle75","Jan 25, 2012"

Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, nutty, wheat, and perfume. The flavor was of sweet malt, nutty, wheat, and floral. It had a light feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a good brew. The aroma was a little off-putting on this one as the perfume (at least how I would describe it) note was quite strong. I was quite concerned that this would be an overpowering flavor as well. However, it was subdued in the flavor and came across more of a floral note than anything. This one was quite easy to drink and a good changeup for the night. Glad I got the chance to try this one on tap.","thagr81us","Jan 19, 2012"

The nose comprises wheat, light lemon zest, coriander, and a very mild touch of orange sherbet. The taste musks things up a bit, dirtying up the wheat and adding a pinch of black pepper (which, in these surroundings, goes a pretty long way). According to the label, this isn't an out-of-date bottle, so I'm not really sure what to think here. The body is pretty light, with a moderate carbonation and a wet feel.

Not horrible mind you, just terribly average. Lots of corn and grain and bread again.

The flavor is initially rather malty, crackers and grain with just a little sweetness. The beer transitions to moderately bitter with a pleasant, spicy, floral hop flavor and a dry, crisp finish. The carbonation is appropriately medium-high with medium body. Overall this is a well made very tasty American Pils.

Carbonation is fine, and the body is impressively rich for a beer of this style and size. Bell's Lager is fairly drinkable beer, but then again I'd be alarmed if a 4.5% pale lager wasn't.

Refreshing without being light bodied, crisp, clean and very enjoyable. It's kind of an overlooked Bell's offering, but for those who just want a great no nonsense beer, this is it.

This beer is maltier and hoppier than American macro-style lagers, making it an interesting option as a thirst quenching spring or summer brew.

Aroma is mostly coming from the Munich and Pils malts, a slight sulfur touch, and a little DMS. It finishes with some hop aroma and a little caramel. Incredibly bready on the palate, malts are very complex, ranging from whole grain crackers to whole wheat bread to fresh biscuits. The hops are certainly in there; not so much in flavor but with a quite bitter finish. Stylistically, it is lower in abv as a typical DME, and I would imagine on the high end for hop levels. It finishes also with a bright citrus flavor, coming from either Hallertau or Styrian hops, and a fruitier than normal yeast flavor.

In the nose there is lemon, citrus rind, spicy hops, and a touch of malts - fairly mild, but you can tell that there's some good stuff down there. And the flavor is where you can tell that this is true; lots of lemony, grassy, spicy/skunky, and earthy hops deliver a medium bitterness, backed by lightly toasted and pale malts, and a slight sea-saltiness - all of which combine to impart a pleasant, lingering finish. The body is light to medium, with an initial crispness that is quick to even out, gliding easily across the tongue, drying the palate a bit as I drink. Damn that is a tasty lager.

3.34,-7.7,4,2.5,3.5,3,4,"Pours a golden straw color with a sparkly foam head on top. Some lace remnants linger behind as the beer recedes. Pretty, but not uncommon among lagers. I am not a fan, however, of this aroma. It reminds me of wilted lettuce. Or, worse, of sour honey-flavored yogurt. I'm not sure what's going on in this beer to create such a malodorous aroma here, but it really is unpleasant. And it worsens as it warms up. Yet, despite the aroma that I find rather offensive, the beer tastes just fine. It's crisp and clean enough, and maintains less of the aroma in the mouthful than anticipated, that it cut throught the nonsense and gets to the heart of a pretty decent lager. It's malty, and a tad watery, but good enough to help cool off after a long hard day working in the yard. To the point, but not spectacular. An interesting beer, for sure. I'm not aware of any other beer in BA that I've been so up-and-down about in my rating scale over. A bizarre beer, this Lager of the Lakes.","Atlas1","0"
4,10.5,4,4,4,4,4,"This is the first I have seen this beer in the stores I frequent in Columbus, so maybe they were scared of Bell's making a lager? This beer poured a light yellow gold color and formed a small bubbly white head that left latticed lace as it subsided. A small amount of carbonation is present. An aroma of malt, yeast, bread and slight aroma of hops. The flavor was of bread, yeast, some citrus and a touch of hops. The finish was light and crisp and would make a good session beer. I guess my one beef with Bells would be better pricing, since here selling the same as more potent ales like Oberon or Two Hearted means I wont pick this as a session beer.","Wildman","Jun 08, 2007"
4,10.5,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,5,"Hey, most of us would prefer other Bell's beers; they've made their name on big, assertive, delicious ales. But if you want something light to session with, to kick back with on the deck, something to work on for the entirety of a lazy summer afternoon without making you feel surly and clutzy, it would be hard to find a better pick than this.","Metalmonk","May 15, 2007"

3.35,-7.5,3,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Bell's did it--finely brewed a beer to compete with Budweiser. It's not bad, a stepped up macro, which seems to be the intention. Macro-yellow color, or a bit darker and a white head that actually hung around for a bit to form some lace. Apple and spice in the nose like Bud but cleaner. Medium body, not bad, fills the mouth at least. Strong carbononation along with a spicy, peppery taste in the beer. Good and should've waited for a hotter summer day for this one, but not bad. I don't want six of them, but one was fine.","FightingEntropy","Apr 08, 2007"

Refreshing with a subtle bitter dryness in the finish. Hops are in there somewhere, you just have to search for them a bit. A very nice one from Bell's.

It's bready, but not very bready, it has some good flavors too. The taste finishes with a slight bitter of hops and some breadiness like a regular lager, but this is the first one I have ever had that doesn't make me cringe. I like this one.

Basically average on all flavor profiles, but with a well formulated recipe and precisely executed brewing technique, the balance rises beyond just average. The aroma, look, flavors, and feel are what you would expect from other very good lagers. But with no identifiable characteristics, is difficult to praise. Delicate and very drinkable beer--one to drink all night or to chase a pizza.","BEERchitect","Feb 24, 2007"

4.08,12.7,4,3.5,4,4,5,"The smell consists of pilsner malt with a hint of bready munich malts. Also has a nice spicy, herbal, and floral noble hops bouquet. The taste is just as I would have expected from the nose. Has a nice bitter, lingering finish. Very crisp and clean and fairly dry. One of the better lagers I've had. I could drink it all night. It will make a good substitution for Victory Prima Pils, though not a replacement.","neonbrown82","Jan 14, 2007"
3.58,-1.1,4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 3/4 bright white head over the clear light gold (yellow?) brew. Head fades moderately, with reasonable amounts of sticky delicate lace decorating the glass sides. Aroma is sweet pale malt coupled with a slightly tangy grassiness. Taste follows along the nose's guidelines, with the grassy hops melding pretty well with the grain character, and a crisp clean close. Mouthfeel and drinkability are pretty good as well. Wouldn't mind having this one as a local everyday drinker.","ppoitras","Jan 13, 2007"

Smells like a crisp pale lager. Nice clean hoppiness to it. Hints of honey. Tastes clean and crisp. Seems the standard taste of an All-Malt Lager. Nice grainy aftertaste, very strong, comes in waves. A touch of bitter in the aftertaste, too. Nice fizzy bite to the mouthfeel. Very clean, sharp, easily drinkable beer.","ndekke39","Jan 03, 2007"

Body is quite light and crisp, with a bitterness that sneaks up on you and an explosion of hop flavor at the end. While the body is light and fizzy, the taste is nice and chewy and gives you something to come back for.","PeatReek","Beers"
2.62,-27.6,2,2.5,2.5,3,3,"Originally reviewed on October 29, 2006. Light rotting corn ester and fusel destruction in the aroma. The malt is stinky. A light waft of hop field grass blows in from over the hill. Pours a crystalline clear pale yellow. Very thin rim of head. Flavor is a more piquantly hopped version of the aroma, a biting terse grassy overtone plays over all the off corn sugar flavors. The malt disagrees with my tongue in more than one way. Its not possibly skunked, as its fresh off the delivery truck. Theres a light edge of creaminess to the grain sugars, but mostly a fusely off-note. Some light sweet orange rises from the hop smack in the backend. This beer is a sellout. Not even a good pilsener.","CharlesDarwin","0"

Still, this is light and quaffable. It has a dry perception to it that is driven by cracker-like malt notes and a nice contributing bitterness that is found throughout the flavor profile of this beer. A herbal hop character is also quite noticeable and almost takes on a minty note. This is certainly a nice beer, quite a bit more flavorful than I was expecting (I will admit to expecting it to lean more towards the macro side of things). Nicely quaffable, yet still has a certain fullness to it that allows the malt to stick to the palate. In fact the lingering notes that stick to the mouth are that of caramel and a hop bitterness. This beer strikes a nice balance between malt and hop throughout the flavor profile of this beer.","Gueuzedude","Nov 11, 2006"

Cat pee, sea air, and rancid honey. Underbelly of sweetish, clean, biscuit malt. Toasted, bitter, spicy hop taste up front. Mellow honey and bread malt middle, with noble, herbal, hop bitterness increasing to a smooth, refreshing finish. Moderate body with a lively, yet creamy feel. This is a stand-up example of an all-malt lager. All those little cabin-supported taverns in N. Michigan should have this on a permanent tap.","alexgash","Oct 30, 2006"

There is a bread-like taste to this beer, which combined with a nice dose of hops, finishes off with a slight bitterness. Its not quite in the vein of a Euro-lager, but reminded me of Pilsner Urquell Meets Larry Bell, with Larry's crew putting their touches on it. This beer is extremely easy to drink and refreshing.","proc","0"
