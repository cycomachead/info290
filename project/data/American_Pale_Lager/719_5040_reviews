"For an American Made Lager Beer, this is Awesome, Delicious, its LAGER and if you know what this means, you know its quality amber type of beer and it tastes great, you wont even feel the 5% alcohol inside, its that good, i love it, and living in Northwest this is one of our most popular beer. love it."

"My rating may seem a bit over-the-top, but I've decided that, in comparison with most of the commercially produced American pilsner beers, this one is quite attractive. Head and shoulders better than a typical Pudsqueezer, Millers, etc. My taste for American pilsners has been somewhat warped by the Czech, Pislner Urquel which is a magnificent example of what a commercial pilsner can be. Still, this beer is completely pleasant, easily drinkable (even for a novice) fishin' beer. AND in Utah at the liquor store it is less expensive than average (almost a buck a bottle cheaper than Pilsner Urquel)."

"Overall: This is a nicely balanced and decent lager. It is more akin to Euro-style lagers than American macros in flavor."

"Looks ok, drinks like a bland smash without enough cascade to give it some oomph. Feel wasn't too bad, pretty drinkable, but overall not something I was overly impressed with. I recall this beer being much better than this, so I don't know if that's from memory too long gone or that it's changed for the worst since days gone by."
"A decent beer, nothing to write home about, but pleasant enough to drink without putting much thought into the flavor profile."

""
""
"Overall – A decent brew at a reasonable price. Quite easy drinking and flavorful in the sweeter department with a rather easy drinking taste making for a decent session/ social drinking brew."
""
""
"Poured into a Seattle Beer Week pint glass. Pours a clear light golden amber with a thin white head with decent retention and light lacing. Light aroma of sweet malt and light hops, whiff of soap. Taste is mild sweet malt, grainy with light, friendly hops in the finish. Light bodied. A light, sweet lager, with a hint more malt and hop presence than a standard adjunct lager. Safe and boring with no off-notes."

"Sourcing: Purchased at CEFCO in Texas in August of 2013 for $8.99/ build-your-own six-pack plus tax."
""
"Pours a clear yellow with a foamy bone head that settles to a partial film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace slowly drip into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, and grassy aromas. Taste is much the same with grain and grassy flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is an average beer that is drinkable for what it is but there is nothing too exciting going on here."

"If not for the funky aftertaste, this would be a decent beer. It is nice and light, and has more flavor than most mass market beers. Would be an ok beer for something on a really hot day if you wanted something to cool yourself down."
"Priced at 10.99 a 12 pack"
"O: A decent non-offensive lager. Good as a lawnmower or BBQ beer."

"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, Private Reserve is a clear, staw-blonde color with an active, fizzy white head. The nose is of lightly toasted grains and muted hops. Flavor reports more of the lightly toasted grains with a citrusy, slightly fruity finish. Hops are only to balance, they contribute little to the flavor of the beer, not exactly what I was expecting from a ""Northwest-style lager"". Mouthfeel is light in body with minimal carbonation. Overall not a bad beer but nothing exceptional either."

"It's a good beer, not great. It's worth drinking, and picking up if you come across it, but it isn't among my favorites."
""
""
""
"Glad I had one for free, but this is basically crap. This is an average beer and nothing else. Very bland and boring. But it is what it should be for the style I suppose."

"Overall - decent, average american lager"

"O: This beer is easy to drink and refreshing but there is nothing exceptional about this beer that would make me want to purchase it again - though also nothing that turns me off from it. This is just a very mediocre beer."
"Appearance was very good, pouring out a darkish yellow with a very white, fluffy head. It had staying power but with little lacing. The smell was a distinct barley which was one of the best I've experienced in a while. Mouthfeel was also good - just the right amount of carbonation with no watered down feel. It was an ale taste for a lager - not what I was expecting but good. Lighter an less bitter than a pale ale but with a strong lager taste. Overall, it was a good beer. I have to say I expected more from a beer labeled private reserve, but it will still be something I will be partaking of soon enough."
""
"Crystal clear gold with slight amber tinge. Head is very thin and white and disappears quickly. Not a great smell. Skunky oatmeal scent. Very light flavor. No bitterness and very mild sweetness. Would be fine for session I believe. Crisp dry body. Nothing special here. Might be superior to some of the macrobrews. Such a light taste that it would be well suited for the person who says they don't like beer."

"wanted to try something diffrent a good solid beer great color in the not weak not waterd down looks good in a glass , taste like yellow beer should taste like a good strong beer that doesnt lack taste a beer to be proud of enjoy this and have a nice day"
""
""

"D - Average sweet blend of malts and hops to give it a good lager taste; smooth and refreshing beer;"
""

"I cannot say much for head retention as it fizzed up briefly with a finger of bone-white head, but then it dissipated just as quickly, leaving mere wisps in its wake. Color was a sunshine-yellow with NE-quality clarity and evidence of carbonation. Nose was slightly metallic with a biscuit malt base and a grassy hop smell. Mouthfeel was medium and the taste was about what I remember from nearly 27 years ago! It was a mildly hopped grassy flavor that I first noticed in the mouth and the finish had a bready/biscuit-like sweetness to it. I remember thinking that although it was not something wildly different like a Belgian ale, neither was it gag-inducing like so many mass-produced lagers of the time. I was not totally hip to the difference between lagers and ales, but I knew that one existed. This was a really pleasant semi-dry lager and a definite nod to the original. Obviously, they are not going to cop to their adherence to the original recipe, but this was a solid beer. Now, if they would just start CANning Henry's ..."
""
""
""
"The taste draws out some grains and pale malts with a good, clean and off-dry finish. I mean it really fits the pale lager style but there is nothing extraordinary about it. It's just what should be expected and little more. Drinkable enough."
""
""
""
""
"Too grainy, and no real complexity. Dime a dozen type of beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - This is a nice lager, but it really didn't wow me."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Watery…I guess this is a lager, as I don’t often dabble too much into this category…it’s very watery and real basic…no flavor beyond the light wheat and corn and it doesn’t leave much of an impression on the palette…very little experimentation here, it’s just “beer”…i would suspect that most home brewers can make a similar tasting ale…if you like lagers, this one is crisp and clean and drinkable, but if you are wanting for flavor, don’t look here…(1.75/5)"
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Nothing really stands out about the smell or taste of this beer but it is rather easy to drink."
"Poured from a brown1 2 oz. bottle. Has a pale yellow color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of grains and malts. Taste is light, mild, some malts and grains, refreshing but a bit on the weak side. Feels light in the mouth and overall, while not terrible, is just meh."
""
"OVERALL: About average lager. Nothing special but decent."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, not a bad beer. However it does leave you wanting a little overall. Just about average. More like a light beer."
""
"Pours a clean deep yellow color with a white head. In the aroma, sweet grains to a small dry end. In the taste, sweeter across the board and a small pine hop. A small bite and medium to lighter bodied mouthfeel, with a dry and somewhat lager like after taste. Cascade hops and a bigger body than a lager, but quite lager like."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Smooth and drinkable, a bit bitter on the finish but because of the sweet spin on the taste it’s a nice take on an IPA that I definitely enjoyed sampling. This would be a good beer for newcomers just starting out on craft beers."
"Grass, crackers, hay, with a crsip and pleasant palate. This is a lager meant for easy and enjoyable drinking and enjoyment. Good for after a long days work, or relaxing with friends and shooting the shit."
""
"Overall Drinkability: I don't love this style of beer, but this was good enough."
""
"I am hoping that the amber and IPA are better from this brewery!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Overall very macro-like in execution. Cascade hops were sparingly used. A light drinking lager that may appeal to the BMC crowd but got a bit boring real fast for me. Aside from classic lager appearence which i thought was decent, this falls off significantly there-after. looks aint everything."
"O: Pretty average lager, nothing outstanding but not Bud. Pretty decent lager, would be good on a hot day just to quench your thirst."
""
""
""
""
"It claims to use Cascade hops, and I suppose they are there, but they are very mild. The whole lager is mild. Inoffensive, but not much different than cheap macro lagers."
""
""
"Henry Weinhard's Private Reserve pours a pale yellow color with a thick white head from a brown twelve ounce bottle. It smells like a macro lager, perhaps a touch of citrus is noticeable. Tastes like a typical macro too, some cereal like flavors, just a hint of hops here. Actually, probably a bit more hop taste than most macros. Overall, very decent for a macro lager, unspectacular overall. Last one of these I drank had to be more than twenty years ago, the bottle and label have changed, the beer is largely the same, perhaps with some minor tweaks."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, sigh, not even gonna finish this. The only two times I could see drinking this are frat party, or when you're dying of thirst after walking through the desert for 40 days and 40 nights with nothing but sandy water, then maybe this may be an improvement. I should have known at the price it was that it would suck. I'll probably pound through the other two some night when I can whip up a few reviews in a few minutes."
""
"Decent for the style is the best I can say here."
""
""
""
"Medium bodied and smoother than most lagers by far. Somewhat fizzy carbonation. A decent lager but nothing great."
""
""
"Overall a pretty good example for the style."
"An unexciting lager with little depth or complexity. Drinkable but not something to get fired-up about."
"Better than their IPA that I had, despite the fact that they're different styles. I guess it's all in the approach and they approached this style admirably."
""
"12oz bottle, pours crystal clear & golden, fairly thin white head dissipates quickly to thin layer of foam, leaving some lacing. Aromas are typical for a lager of this style...grassy, biscuity, lager yeast, metallic. Tastes are mild with toasty grain, metallic, grassy hop, lager yeast, finishes sharp & very clean. Thin body, moderate carbonation. Nothing spectacular here. Pretty average."
""
""
""
"Overall, a very good beer that really isn't a huge leap over the macros, but definitely won't be confused with them when somebody tries one. A good cold weather beer that I'll buy again at the $5.99 price for a 6'er. BTW...drank 3 of these with my nachos and they went great together. Easy drinking all the way."
"From notes bottle into beer mug. Nice golden appearance with lacing here and there when swirled, but not that great looking. Nose is nice probably cascade, pale malty notes. The taste well I just chewed up two v's so that made the flavor a bit medicinal. Yes have a script, for all the baomoves out there who were wondering. Light carbonated mouthfeel, but not bad, this would make a good hot sun brew. I bought it at a local supermarkt marked down to 5 something... It was worth the price. Better than bud, volks."
"Taste is mild and watery. No sense of hops at all, despite the bottle's claim. Not sure if this was a better beer before SABMiller bought the name, but this one's really pretty uninteresting. Avoid."
""
""
"Light graininess to the taste, a little bitter, noble hops, maybe a cascade or two thrown in there. High carbonation keeps the beer lighter on the palate. The yeast or something still stands out, a different bitter twang, although this may be exacerbated by the lack of a malt bill, I don't even know if this is two row, this could be six row."
"Reachin' into the old man's private stash, eh? I'm always up for a little mischief... This stuff pours a clear pale straw topped by a finger of lightly off-white foam. The nose comprises straight corn (in the form of both kernel and syrup) and what may or may not be some mild wheat. Sad, insipid smell, really. The taste brings in more of the same, though now my suspicions regarding the wheat are confirmed, and the culprit is shown to be Pigpen-style dirty. The body is a light medium, with a moderate carbonation, a watery feel, and a drying finish. Overall, a sad, mostly lifeless little beer, one hardly deserving of its title. I'd hate to see what he throws away..."

"I am really putting time into this review. I'm trying to be very fair and aware of what works.It almost seems like they took an adjunct recipe and pulled out all of the bad elements, but didn't replenish with anything good. It is not the flaw of content, but what is missing. This is a safe beer brewed to appeal to the BMC crowd, but marketed as better than that. Private Reserve? What kind of shit is brewed for the common man then? I saw 2 other offerings from this brewer, and while I usually give multiple shots at redemption, this will not be the case for these guys."
"Astringent feel, sharp co2 bite of carbonation, fizzy. Light corn aftertaste, lingering unpleasant cooked veggie flavors of DMS. Thin and fleeting feel, not much in terms of redeeming qualities, starting to feel a headache coming on also. A bit harsh and unrefined with the DMS off flavors being a dealbreaker. Big pass on this."
"Overall: Insufficient on many levels."
""
""
"O: This one is just kind of meh. I mean it's really not bad for the style, but it is also not great either. Just sort of a mediocre effort. I wouldn't turn it down if it were offered to me or if it were the best option I had on-tap, but I highly doubt I would go out of my way to track it down again."
"Poured a 1 1/4"" finely frothed white head of average life. The body is the classic clear straw yellow but seems a touch brighter. Smells of malt and mild hops, and less grassy than some other BMCs. Taste is a light smooth malt, very clean, with cracker undertones and a slow zing of a fizz. Easy drinking, uplifting, satisfying, yet not a big departure from mainstream lagers either. Decent. Note although it's apparently an Oregon brand mine came from Milwaukee."
""
""
"Overall I still have the IPA but feel I paid too much mixing and matching these for 10 bucks a sixer. Ow well its not my favorite style to boot."

">3.5 	= 	will try to buy again in the future"

"12 oz. bottle purchased in a six-pack at Market Basket in Somersworth. Pours a very light yellow crystal-clear body with a good inch of persistent white head. Grainy malty aroma lightly wafts from the beer. Grain, cooked vegetable, and a slight sweetness comprises the flavor. Aqueous body with ample carbonation. Fairly quaffable. Not bad. Not great. A par-for-the-course American-style pale lager. Worth the five dollars per six-pack, but no more."
"Not too shabby for an APL. I'd take a few more of these down, no problem."
"Taste is semi sweet with some off flavors. Slightly sour, a little too acidic. Definitely some strange off flavors going on, not sure what they are but not liking them. Not a good beer even at the cheap price. For whats supposed to be a lager, to much off fruit flavors. Not as clean as it should be."
""
"O - it's ok."
""
""
""
"A nice balanced beer. A good drinkable American pale, but nothing special."
"I'm not sure why Whole Foods was carrying this. The ""Private Reserve"" makes as little sense as Michelob ""ultra"". It's a pretty label, but it's all show with no substance. Don't buy."
""
"Overall - One of the better reasonably priced lagers on the market. Drinks closer to a pale ale than a lager at warmer temps."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is a pretty decent pale lager. Would be a good session BBQ type beer on a hot day."
""
"nothing special here. smells like a slightly more malty version of the american adjunct stuff, bittering hops only, and in small doses. flavor is fairly bland as well, some english style malts give it a decent profile, but its rather watered down. it does have a fairly crist finish, which serves it well. lighter medium body, decent carbonation. this is one of those beers that serves the purpose of being a better than mass produced lagers, but not being too offensive to the less adventurous palate. not a beer id suggest to any of my mates, but i might buy a 6er for my molson drinking old man."

"The appearance turned out to be actually pretty darn good. The lacing was really outstanding for a lager. For the first half of the glass the lacing was literally just one big lace, no wholes or anything on the lacing. As I got down to the second half the lacing started to break up a little bit, but it was still thicker than your average lacing, and it followed me all the way down the glass to boot! Really...the body wasn't very good, but it was a lager after all. The lacing and head were so great that I think I'm going to have to give it a 4 for appearance, even if that is too generous."

"While I'm a fan of lagers, there aren't many that wow me. This beer is among that group - but it's still very good for a basic, delicious lager with a nice smoothe easy-drinking taste with no aftertaste. The price-point at under $1 for a stubby bottle is nice, too. I'm a fan of supporting Henry Weinhard's brews so I would always consider this a beer I'd gladly purchase again in the future."

"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass, Jan 09, 12 date on the bottle. Pours a light yellow color with a small white head which it quickly dissipates. The smells are light of floral hops with light malts. The feel is light along with the taste, some bread malts with a light hop bitterness (very light)."
"Pretty good for a basic lager."
"This is a decent brew. It does not have any strong flavors, but it seems well balanced and easily drank."
"mouthfeel - not too bad thickness. maybe something i like about this a lot, its good solid medium body. pretty good carbonation. drinkability is also pretty solid."
"overall- It is a weak tasting with a bad aftertaste. I cant recommend it. To many better choices in this price range."
"Pours a pretty clear golden color with not much white head, but the glass had been sitting out for a little while. Rich aroma is mainly fruity - pear and apple - with some malt and a hint of hay. Malty, fruity, slightly sweet flavor has a hoppy hint and is quite enjoyable. Texture is smooth and quite fizzy."
"12oz. bottle poured into a pint glass. Best by date is 6/13/11. Pours a very clear, very light yellow with two fingers of light, airy foam and almost no carbonation. Head quickly disappears and leaves no lacing. Nose has a fair amount of bitter hops with yeast and light, subtle malty notes. Mouthfeel is flat and watery. Palate has mildly sweet malt with grain flavors. Slightly bitter, hoppy finish. At the end of its shelf life and doesn't taste that old, but definitely doesn't show all that well in any aspect either."
"O- Drinkable, but if I am going to have a cheapo lager I'd rather have a Rainier or step it up to a full-sail session."
"Finish: Grassy, granny, and malty"
" Blitz-Weinhard Brewing Company--Full Sail Brewing Contract Brewer--Henry Weinhard's Private Reserve Classic Northwest Lager--2010 12 oz. 4.80% ABV. 15 IBU's. (3.75 / 5.0) Pale Lager. Lacy foamy very white head. Clear bright thin yellow gold color. Mild floral Pale Lager delicate hop front. Crisp zesty mild butter caramel delicate tasty Pale Lager body. Refreshing smooth mild hop clean crisp light citrus end. Balanced, smooth, good Lager. Sampled 2/9/2011. 6-Pack purchased for $5.99 at Fred Meyer--Ballard, Seattle on 8/29/2010."
"Found one in the fridge while visiting family in Seattle, so popped it open and poured it into a tall glass. Bright orange / yellow color with lots of carbonation and a cloud-white head. Smell had that typical macro aroma. Flavor was pretty good. A bit bready, some malt, not a lot of hops. Mouthfeel was thin and a bit watery, but that made this beer just smooth enough to be easily drinkable. If you like lagers, then it's an OK choice. But with all the choices in WA, this beer falls towards the bottom of my list as to what I would spend money on."
"D: Well, it beats a Bud or Miller in terms of flavor, even if it's in that it lacks the odd essences of those macro brews. To put it simply: High Drinkability due to Low Funk. Otherwise, it's about on a par with them."
"Fits the APL style pretty well in my opinion. Comes off as a kind of a light beer yet better than a light beer, if that makes sense. I like it but overall it isn't one of my favorites."
"A- poor drinkability, yes it would be easy to put away a lot of these but I don't think I would enjoy it, the flavor just isn't there."
"D - needs to be a hot day and a cold beer but this is better than bud or heiny without a doubt."
"I rate this one as being good."
"An ok pale lager, it leans a bit too much toward the stank of much more lowly competitors."
"RJT"
"Drinkability: Not the most impressive lager out there, but nothing too terribly wrong with it. If I may damn it with faint praise, it is good for the price (but only in the Northwest)."
"D - About as drinkable as it gets, you could really session this one all night. It's very simple, clean, and cheap, I got a 12pack for 9$ bucks. I'd buy it again but in place of my usually quaff lager, Schlitz. Nothing wows me about this beer but it's good."
"A decent lager, very drinkable."
"Then last week I bought a 12 pack of HPR after having ignored it for about a year It is clean, solid, unpretentious and uncomplicated. Finishes well, no lingering aftertaste."
"This beer was kind of a surprise. My expectations were fairly low so that would be a factor. It's surprisingly robust for a cheap lager and were it not for the slight lingering aftertaste it would be rated higher. Although I will say by the end of a 24 oz. can, I had had enough."
"I'll probably keep getting it until the store runs out of it :)"
"Drinkability: quite drinkable. This is another brew which makes frequent appearances at band practice ($9 for a half-rack doesn't hurt, either). Keeps you hydrated!"
"Overall a very clean and very enjoyable lager. Incredibly drinkable and refreshing. Very well done."
"This is the single best session beer i have ever had. As far as beers meant for enjoying with friends at a BBQ etc, this is perfection."
"Overall: Henry Weinhard's Private Reserve gets my highest recommendation. It's a fantastic all-purpose beer, with an exceptional blend of high-quality ingredients. Classy enough to impress the microbrew crowd, drinkable enough for your next chugging session."
"The foam was very light wheat in color, bubbly and dissapated quickly. Color was light golden yellow with hints of amber. Smell had bitter fruit notes with an even amount of hops and wheat. Taste - a dominate bitter introduction with hops and barley balance and wheat undertones. Mouthfeel - light to medium-bodied and not too carbonated. Drinkability - it's ok but better than the mainstream American pils ans lagers."
"D: A great beer to introduce BMC drinkers into the craft world. A bit more complexity than what those folks would be used to, but nothing overwhelming on the palate."
"D- While I wouldn't complain about drinking this over an extended period out or watching a hockey game at home, I'd more likely have 2-3 of these then move on to something with more character. It is refreshing and makes a nice summer beer. It is definitely better than the average North American Lager....I recommend at least giving this one a try."
"Overall - Not impressed, do not recommend, and won't be buying it again."
"Pours a light yellow with good head which fades to a lace, then just a ring around the glass. Some hop smell and light hop taste, little malt taste, the corn grit comes through. Good mouth feel for a beer of this type. They used to make this beer with a Hazelnut flavoring which was interesting. I always have a ""Hank's"" when I'm in Portland, OR."
"D: I actually enjoy this beer, it tastes above average which makes it all the better. One of the best I've had. Especially not bad seeing as how a pait $1 for a six-pack just because it was one day over expiration date."
"Pours a golden yellow that is clear. Develops a thin white head that dissipates quickly into a narrow collar. Slight laciness. Aroma is musty barley with a slight hoppiness. Taste is primarily cereal grains with a bit of hops. Thin and water texture. Not a terrible beer, might work on a hot day sitting outside. Not recommended as a session beer."
"The brew taste a bit better than is smells with some decent malt flavors coming through, but the could be support by a slight hop kick. There also a bit of that sweet corn DMS in there. Body is medium light and carb is fair. Overall this is a beer than I'd try again."
"D - Had this with Christmas dinner at my Grandparents house. Not much better (if at all) than the big three. Certainly not a beer i'd seek out at the store."
"Finish; nill overall very good easy drinking beer"
"Why do you continue to perpetrate this fraud upon us? Your beer is not a micro or a craft brew. I know this is not actually out of your own private stash. You claim this beer has an ""outstanding pleasant taste," when it clearly does not. It pours a fake clear gold with a mediocre white head. It has a sour, grainy aroma replete with straw. It is watered down, skunky, and bitter. The taste just gets more and more sour and stale as you continute to drink. Fake honey and malt flavors do not blend well with the wooden, NOT resiny, but wooden hops. Please, for the sake of all that is good and decent in this world, stop selling this beer."
"D: I remember this beer being a big deal when it first hit the market. Better than most macros. Certainly decent for a session."
"The taste is a nice, pleasant grain with lemon, apple, smoothly sweet before a very faintly grassy-piney bitter finish leaving a lingering, tingly faint bitterness and soft grain aftertaste. The bitterness, though, is very faint and overall the beer is on the sweet side. However, it has pleasant taste, is nice, clean, smooth, crisp, and very drinkable."
"Bought a 6 pack from Hyvee supermarket. Poured from a bottle in to a glass. First thing I noticed about this beer is that it was extremely refreshing. Hence, the exceptional rating for drinkability. I could really see this being a good fit if you were looking for a beer to drink if you were pulling an all nighter with some friends. As far as the actual taste and aroma... there's not a ton going on here. No hoppy taste, or bitters really. It's actually got an almost sweet sorgum-eque flavor to it. But overall, no overpowering taste to it. It's just a good, crisp, smooth, and extremely drinkable beer. I would absolutely drink it again."
"The aroma was a bit lemony and the taste was grainy and tart. In the mouth it was crisp and highly carbonated. Overall it was not bad for the big macro lagers. I would probably drink this before the other large ones."
"Drinkability- It was not bad. I would drink it again."
"If you're looking for a beer with no taste that's very easy to drink...this is the beer for you. I'll not seek this out again."
"Appearance is a golden straw with a very thin to no head. Smell seems a bit mor malty than most macros. Taste has a light citrus and malt with a club soda, along with the carbonation. Mouthfeel is light, smooth and dry. It's been awhile since I've had one of these and I won't be in any rush to have another."
"Eh. This is an entirely forgettable beer. Do people really love this stuff? Maybe. It could very well be a regional attraction. I could see this being the Shiner, or the Natty Bo, or the Lone Star of the NW, that people love because it's brewed in their backyard and has a history to it. Still, it's a mediocre beer all around and I just can't quite see the attraction."
"d: better than budweiser and coors but worse than some other premium macros; i won't buy it again; also a huge disappointment since their root beer is so fing good"
"Private Reserve is a pretty highfalutin' name for such a simple beer. No matter what they call it, I found a lot to like in this drinkable, quenching little pale lager. I'd much rather be surprised up to a slightly above average beer than be disappointed down to one."
"Poured a deep urine color with little carbonation. Taste is kind of smooth, with a decent malt flavor. The hoppiness is very pleasant. This is somewhat light-bodied but better than most Macro Lagers. The first Henry's I've tried and probably the last."
"Light but tasty and nothing offensive about it. Pretty solid for what it is. I wouldn't normally buy this, but I wouldn't complain if someone handed me a bottle."
"Drinkability: Solid, tasty beer. Not a bad alternative in the macro market."
"Drinks pretty easy for a macro, I could have a couple before moving on to something more substantial. I'd take this over BMC any day"
"Taste was a bit malty with a slight hoppy finish. Nothing too special here. Carbonation levels were good, but it was more like drinking plain carbonated water than beer. I can easily see how people can easily down a few of these"
"much lawn to mow, and so very many choices..."
"Can easily drink these all night though."
"Comment: Not my cup of beerit bitter, too tasteless, too thin. Weinhards makes a very good root beer."
"8-18-2010."
"I miss."
"A pretty decent macro. One that I don't mind falling back on when around macro drinkers. It's a decent lager, that is easy to drink."
"Pours clear gold with mild orange tones and a large, rocky, white head with a touch of cream. Medium to thick lacing. Aroma is faint and sweet: basic bread malts and northwest hops. Mouthfeel is light, mildly crisp, and a touch creamy. Flavor to match aroma  lightly sweet malts dominate with a sourdough / pine hops bitter undertone. Faint citrus hops throughout; corn in the finish. Aftertaste is clean and mildly bitter."
"D: An easy-drinking, thirst-quenching beer. Nothing fancy but one I'd pick up an occasional pint of or a six-pack just to have around."
"The taste has a slight lemony hop flavour up front with some sweet malt in the background and finishes crisp and dry. A good thirst quencher is what it is and that's not a bad thing at all."
"Drinkability- A bit better than the run of the mill macro. Has a bit of character and was pretty easy to drink."
"Drinkability: Ridiculous easy drinker. I polished off a six tonight no problem. Afforable too, about the price of any BMC six pack of bottles. I may grab some more of this again."
"This beer pours a light yellow in color with a light head. It has a light hops smell and a clear grain smell. The taste is very balanced not too hops and not too malt. This beer has a clean feel and a refreshing after taste. It is very drinkable and would be had to beat. If youre looking for a hard beer this is not your beer but it will quench your thirst for a well brewed beer"
"Pours from the bottle to a lighter yellow color with a small 1/8th inch head of foam. Hints of lace, medium level of carbonation. Aromas of light floal hops and medium bodied malts are noted. Taste is middle of the road, right down the center; malt, hops, water, light grain. Rather bland, but not offensive. Mouthfeel is pretty good, crisp and bubbly. Very easy to drink. Not bad. Kind of boring. Special thanks to Dubbercody for the sample."
"Pours a pale straw color topped by a stark white head that shrinks from an inch to a thin layer very quickly. Aroma is very neutral - not bad, just not much there. A hint of malt and adjunct grains, with a little bit of corny sweetness. Palate is pretty well-developed, a good sweet malt character with a touch of corn and just a hint of astringency. Body is light and creamy, lending the beer a highly drinkable quality. Great on a hot summer day, although not nearly as special as it was when it was brewed down on Burnside instead of down in goddamn California."
"Pretty average macro lager, not my style of preferance."
"Note: I have had this beer before. It is not something i'd buy again for the price of 9.99. I would rather drink miller high life. It resembled a kolsch but was way harder to drink! If your in the market and you see this beer dont bother with it. It does not fade and it gets old after the 3rd brew."
"A cult favorite in the Northwest! The appearance is a translucent gold with a long lived foam that left nice lacing. Aroma contains a sweet dextrose and grain. Initial taste is sweet, some malt and little carbonation, medium body, and a hint of beechwood. Finish is sweetish, finally settling down to dry. The taste does bring back memories..."
"D - Drinkable I guess. I had to try it again, since I use to like it way back."
"This is a drinkable beer, and probably a little above average for an American macro-beer. The flavor is not very robust, and I prefer something with a little more body, but for a plain Jane nothing special bottled lager, this one is not a bad choice."
"Drinkability: For a cheap, tasty AML, reach for Henry's Private Reserve. I know of no lager in America that tastes so good for so little money (Yes, that's including PBR), simply a great session beer. At $9 and change after tax per 12 pack bottles, you can't go wrong."
"Pours to a thin yellow color. Zero head zero lace. Very watery pour. Smell is of all grain...no hops. A sharp almost pungent mildew smell overtakes this one. The taste is poor, very typical tastes like a macro. More full mouthfeel than one would expect but not impressive. Do not drink this one. I was not impressed at all. Not a good example of good beer."
"This one pours a golden yellow color with no head and no ring around the top of the beer. The nose is not really strong for anything, just a hint of soft grains and some corn. The flavor has a touch of honey sweetness, but no hop at all to be found. The feel is moderately thick with a nice carbonation for the feel. This is an easy drinking crisp beer, overall not all that bad, but still nothing really great."
"Drinkability is not a word I would associate with this beer."
"Seems like a beer that could have a cult following for some reason, like Pabst. Not sure why, just has that feel to it."
"Henry Weinhard's label has been purchased by SAB Miller, and this beer is being brewed in (I believe) Irwindale, CA. (The Hefeweizen and Amber Light brews are being brewed at the Full Sail brewery in Hood River, OR.) It's your standard American premium lager, AKA macro. And it's not half-bad. Pours a crystal clear platinum with a good head that dwindles to a thin ring. Aroma of yeast mustiness. The malts are strong and sweet, with bread crust flavors. A hop crispness balances the beer with a firm but restrained bitterness. Mouthfeel thin, but the hops get some good traction on the tongue and inner cheeks. The beer, as a whole, is clean and fresh-tasting, without any glaring off flavors. If it's not exactly exciting, it at least serves its purpose well, and I can't think of another American ""macro""-style lager that is as good, for the price."
"This drink is a pale, straw gold color, small white head on the top. Light malt scent, same thing for the taste, with a touch of hops, mild acidic twang. The mouth is light/medium. This brew is nothing special nor is it worth seeking out. Just better than most macros."
"Not real Drinkable, Olde English 800 is better than this."
"Private Reserve is a very drinkable american lager, much better than the major american labels. A great thing about Henry's is that a six pack is generally cheaper than Bud or any other of the major american beers. The taste is much better. The beer comes in the now famous 12 oz brown short bottle with a white label with gold. The beer pours a nice golden color with a bubbly/foamy head. The head vanishes after a few minutes but traces of foam will stick to your glass through out. The smell is of hops with a hint of grain. Sometimes I swear I smell a fruit flavor, but only sometimes but don't quote me. The taste is sweet and the hops are dry that calm this beer down to make it a very drinkable beer. Mouthfeel is full and sweet. This is the beer when you want a cheap local beer but don't want to go for the major crap. Can't stress this enough, average beer but much better than Bud, Coors, Miller!"
"This beer poured a gold color with a medium, fizzy white head that vanished quickly, though a white foam veneer remained at the top for most of the beer's time in my glass. There was a slight amount of lacing. The smell was primarily of sweet malts. Hops are almost totally absent from the scent. The taste was again of mild, sweet malts, with a tiny hop presence. Hey, this is a NW beer! Don't try to tell me you couldn't find any hops! This IS very drinkable, with its very mild demands upon the palate and relatively low abv. This is a sweetish (as opposed to Swedish) easygoing beer that would be good company drunk from the bottle while watching a game (Go 'Hawks, Dawgs, Eags, Mariners, 'Zags, Sups), and wouldn't screw up the flavor of Mac & Cheese from a box, but its really not worthy of anything else. To give it credit, I don't think it really aspires to anything better. ."
"This beer inhabits middle ground between macro blandness and the heightened tastes of a good micro. Similar beers/breweries in the Midwest include the Berghoff beers and the offerings from Leinenkugle. This is a good starter or lawnmower type beer."
"Drinkability  Its better than the Blue Boar."
"I am going to be a little biased in my rating of this beer, as it was my first non-macro beer. Its not great, but it is a beer my Bud loving fishing buddy will drink, so I don't have to drink Bud. Light gold color, medium head. A light bodied lager style beer. Malts are slightly sweet and there is some hop bite. Nice smooth taste. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly bitter."
"Overall, the beer is an excellent value and a good find in the realm of American Lager, but it could be easily improved by a few more hops in the brew."
"I know a lot of folks in the West turn their noses up at Henry's but for the money we pay Weinhard's make good drinkable beer."
"This pours with a nice white head. Significant carbonation. Taste is kind of smooth, with a decent malt flavor. The hoppiness is very pleasant. This is somewhat light-bodied and refreshing. The first Henry's I've tried, but it won't be the last. Better than expected"
"pours out clear and gold. slight head fades quickly. no lace to speak of. sweet sugary aroma backed by faint earthy notes. quite sweet in taste...a sort of honey flavor is dominant...followed by some crisp hop bite. medium mouthfeel. pretty refreshing and not a bad rendition of the lager style. the sugary sweetness is a bit overdone, which would make it hard to drink too many of these. this would make a good summer quaffer or lawn mower beer."
"Very clear yellow with a decently persistant white head of small bubbles and it does cling a little to the glass -- hopefully indicating minimal stabilizers or foaming agents. Aroma is pretty fleeting, mostly a bit of yeasty bread malt. Starts rather honey sweet, then, a carbonated water impresion settles in. I try to get a hop impression but really don't. Not a huge corn syrup flavor (thankfully) but really pretty tasteless with a semi unsettling finish that I wouldn't call crisp like a nice Pilsner."
"Pleasant rather sweet malt aroma. Gold, clear, foamy white head. Couldn't taste anything until drink was completed. Rather sweet, but not too much. Slight dryness on the short finish. Fairly smooth but fully carbonated. A bit thin. Pretty average overall. Sweeter than most and too sweet for my taste. I enjoyed this more in my youth, before I discovered multiple styles of brew. But something different to offer limited beer drinkers."
"The pour is crystal clear, the head creamy in its texture, sufficient in its size with decent lace to cover the glass, both a bright white color. Nose is malt dominated, clean and crisp Very light hints of citrus also present. Front is lightly sweet, the top quite thin. Finish is scarcely carbonated, faintly hopped, dry aftertaste, but very light bodied and missing some hops and malt to make it more palatable at least to me."
"Clear light yellow in color with a pleasant smelling aroma. I like this better that the other major brew's. I wait for it to go on sale and then serve it to people that come over to visit that don't know the different's between premium an non-premium beer. This is the better of the major beers, I think."
"Not much head off of this copper colored lager. Taste is a bit plain. The aroma is a bit wheaty. Nothing too much to brag about this beer. It's cheap, it's cold, and it's better than Bud."
