"3/20/15 (Bottle) - Light golden pour, nice pillow head, mild carbonation. Not much aroma. Mile malt taste and feel. Meh."
"Slight off aroma on the nose – not quite sure what it is. Pours brilliant pale gold with a ½” pale white head. The palate is a slight caramel, faint honey, a touch of tanginess. Medium light body and medium carbonation. A somewhat insipid session beer."

"A simple tasty lager.  About what you would expect from a lager named supper club.  The ""not bad"" motto, as others have said, is apt.  I will say that I disagree with the reviews that state that one is better off going with a cheaper domestic. This beer is definitely of a higher quality, although I will agree a bit pricey for such a simple offering."

"It's better than most mass produced domestic. It's a decent craft lager. Craft brewers don't normally make a lager beer, so it's nice to try it. Not bad and would recommend to someone to try. In my opinion I believe this beer to have a wider appeal to regular beer drinker unless they live and die by light beer. If you get a chance to purchase it pickup a 6 pack it also comes in 12 pack of 12oz cans."

"Overall, if I lived in the area this stuff comes from, this would be the beer I'd want to bring with me in a cooler to go out camping or fishing rather than to drink at home or try and pair with anything. It's like baby bear's porridge: not too much of anything, not too little, it's juuust right... But in the end it's still just porridge."

"This beer is a decent representation of a style of beer I don’t normally care for. It is better than most other lagers on the market, but doesn’t approach the artisan level of some of the better craft- brewed lagers. It’s okay overall, but I wouldn’t go out of my way to sample."

"The brewery's ""Lake House"" was better, IMO. As it states on the label ""not bad"" (but not particularly very good either.) It is easy enough to drink a few, though."

"A classic beer in many forms and really quite enjoyable. A little pricey for style ($9.99/6-pack), will keep me from being a regular purchaser, but I give it all the credit for what it is and doing a very good job at capturing the aura of an era."

"Beer is light in body, somewhat watery, with carbonation of medium intensity that foams this up on the palate somewhat, creating a mouthfeel that is at first mildly fizzy and then foamy and watery around the edges. Does not close very dry, minor stickiness lingering across the palate after a sip."
""
""
"O - Nothing fancy here. Reminiscent of any run of the mill macro lager with a tad more on the flavour profile. I suspect that's what they were aiming for on this brew, but it's not a brew to write home about. Nothing fancy, but certainly not terrible. An easy drinking brew that pairs well with any meal, and could easily be a session brew on a night of heavy drinking."
""
"O - The label says it all"
""
""
""
"Overall, this is not a complex beer. Furthermore, I have never really found a pale lager that I truly liked. I do not think I would seek this beer out. Quite frankly, I think I may avoid this style in general from now on."

"Supper Club pours a straw yellow, no head, and alot of carbonation. The smell is offensive, and does have sweet banana like smell mixed in. The taste is mellow, a bit sweet, has some banana and tropical fruit notes. Rather light in flavor, but not too bad. Overall not a horrible beer, kinda interesting, and the most important part, the taste, is not bad."
""
""
"O- Pretty solid but nothing to write home about. Great rendition of a not so great style"
"O: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, mild kick, good representation of style, this is a solid lighter beer worth pounding down for a long time."

"D/O: This pale lager portrays a malt focus that is well established, yet fails to elevate the product out of mediocrity. Flavors have little opportunity to become established before textural acidity becomes distracting. In a style that does not demand much respect, this beer would be better served by setting out to exceed the 'about as expected' reaction by its drinker."

"I still don't really get the concept of supper clubs, even after having it explained to me... Anyway, this stuff pours a clear straw topped by an off-white foam. The nose comprises light biscuit, bread yeast, very light corn, and a touch of powdered sugar. The taste brings in more of the same, though with more bread, more powdered sugar, and a bit of banana. The body is pretty light, with a moderate carbonation and a sorta dusty, sorta creamy feel. Overall, nothing Earth-shattering, but a nice, easy-drinking, simple brew. Not bad."
""
"It'sa perfect clear dark yellow. Very little head or lace. The aroma is missing and the taste is crisp, with a hint of yeast,. which almost makes it interesting. Why this cost a little more than the other stuff at the bar is really a mystery."
"Pours a golden yellow with a light head. Aroma mainly malt forward, cereal, and a hint of pear/plum. Tastes like a straight foward lager. Very crisp on the tongue, malty with typical cereal yeasty flavors and some mineral notes, mainly iron. Light on the mouth, wet, finishes clean, leaves a slight tingle and bitterness on the tongue. Fairly drinkable, refreshing on a hot day, otherwise passable."
"D - Not bad, this is a pretty simple beer but it has a nice, thick malt character. Drinkable, but I wouldn't want a whole sixpack of it."
"I thought it was decent as far as lagers go, and will definitely buy it again if I see it."
"As a side note, I am amused by the prominent words ""Not Bad"" which appear on the label art margin next to the product name. How many foodstuffs do you come across which choose to advertise the idea of ""Not Bad"" instead of ""We're the best!"""
"O - Quite nice, easily quaffable; I will have it again."
"O) Better than the mass produced lagers that give me a headache after just one or two. It's pretty good, and I don't mind drinking it on occasion."
"O-This is a nice lager. As with most Capital brews it is well done. But in my opinion if you're going to have a lager-why bother spending the extra money for this one and just get one of the cheap domestics. This one isn't that much different. I doubt that many people could distinguish this from MGD."
"drinkability: fine, decent enough to finish a bottle, but i probably wont"
"""Not bad", reads the label of Supper Club Lager. This straight up traditional Wisconsin lager has the look of a midwest lager with an amber color, light head, and little retention. Its smell is a little more floral than the mass produced brews and a taste of sweet piney malts on the front of the pallete. After working on a 6 pack of Capital's Wisconsin Amber last week, this compares well as a toned down version. Sup Club is a very easy to drink session brew, and while the mouthfeel isn't as sophisticated as many ales reviewed on BA, its drinkability factor is real strong. Above all, at $7 for a 6 pack, I'd have to agree this isn't bad at all!"
"Supper Club is suppose a nod to the lagers of old Wisconsin before Miller ruled the state & ruined everyones tastebuds. Decent looking with carbonation & musky flavor with mild hops and yeast. Definitely drinkable and a step up from Miller Lite, but not enough character for me to seek out."
"Pale gold brew, small white head, maybe just a touch of haze but that could just be left over from college. Light sweet malt scent with a nice touch of floral hops. Nice sweet malt front, faint floral and ever so slightly citrus hops. Very well crafted. Medium to full bodied, nice soft fluffy feel. I dont see capital as much as I did back in the day in Iowa, but i cant recall them making too many clunkers, and this is no exception. Very well done."
"A very drinkable lager. One that I could have quite a few of in an evening."
"D - Easy drinking, lightly filling. Flavors are not overwhelming, complimentary. Good for a night as a session beer. The peak on the malts just gets a little bit troublesome - hidden astringency on the vienna."
"This beer pours a clear goldel color. The head is one inch in height, and recedes quickly into minimal lacing. The aroma is of pale malt and mildly spicy noble hops. The taste is similar to the aroma, but stronger. It is a very pleasant, and enjoyable taste. The mouthfeel is on the lighter side of medium bodied with lively carbonation, and a smooth texture. Overall, this is a nice pale lager that I could easily enjoy again."
"It's a good quality beer. This is a good simple balanced beer with a medium body, good mouthfeel and taste. I could see myself drinking a few more of these in the future."
"Decent lager, I like this one. Worth trying if you like lagers."
" D- This beer is dry and clean with no off flavors or much character at all. It is a well build beer just a bit bland and dull to drink."
"Capital kept it simple with this Pale Lager. Well balanced and clean malt and hop flavors combined with an easy going and crisp drinkibility. I ended up enjoying this bottle much more than I thought I would. I need to pick up a case of cans next time I'm in WI. I would keep this one around for sessionability in the summertime."
"If it's one thing Capital knows, it's lagers. Supper Club Lager is a bona fide hit as far as this BA is concerned. The fact that it's available locally is another reason to be pleased. Love the 50's, retro-style label."
"Capital Supper Club was golden in color with good clarity. It had a white head that did not last. The aroma was lightly malty. The taste was lightly malty with a dry finish. It was medium-light in body with plenty of carbonation. Drinkability was above average. Supper Club is a pretty basic lager, but is quite refreshing."
"12 ounce bottle. Poured into a slender pilsner glass. Beer pours a bright gold with lots and lots of effervescent bubbles. Beer is very clear, as you would expect with this style. Mouthfeel is carbonated. Grainy taste with a nice crisp and clean finish. Refreshing, witha sweetness that's almost like drinking apple juice. Enjoyable and inoffensive."
"This is very easy going. None of the harsh awful tasting flavors of the cheap retro macro brews that this beer is trying to emulate."
"Picked up a single can from Princeton's Liquors. It's always nice to see a respectable take on the ol' American lager. It poured clear gold from the can and had a quickly receding head of foam. The aroma was a husky, slightly vegetal bread smell with a hint of malt sugar. The flavor then, is unsurprisingly sweet. It's not anything overpowering, just a nice light caramel to go along with the white bread, barley and slightest hint of spicy hops. Overall, this is a great lawnmower beer. I'd take a case out to a lake house in the summer."
"Capital Supper Club pours a a thin head over a clear straw colored brew. Carbonation is lively, and the nose is light barley malt, sweet corn, and lager yeast. The flavor is simple and direct- light sweet malt, notes of corn, and a little herbal hop off the back. Mouthfeel is light and crisp- the whole package easy drinking, inoffensive, and like the label says, ""not bad."""
"The beer exited the bottle with caramel color and very little foam. The aroma has a metallic husky grain character to it. More of this on the palate. A little sweet, almost in an adjunct way, as the beer flows across the front of the palate. A touch of bitterness at the back. Overall I wasn't impressed."
" Nothing about it is memorable, but it does serve to inoffensively quench your thirst. This makes it pretty great for the style, but I would never seek it out again."
"I hear its $10 a 6 pack? That levels out the otherwise awesome drinkability of a marginal beer."
"Light golden body. Ample amounts of carbonation are noticeable in the beer. Nice aroma of bready malt. Active carbonation hits the palate first. I take a big swig because I'm very thirsty and it doesn't disappoint. Light malty tones with a honeyed feel to it. Not a lot of depth, but no biggie for this beer. It's quenching. Solid enough. Now that I'm in a Wisconsin state of mind, I'm thinking a few of these would go nicely with a Friday night fish fry."
"Pours a deep gold with a decent head that shows some staying power before eventually settling down to about a half inch layer of foam. Aroma features graininess, and citrusy hops notes. Tasting also puts the hops at the forefront, thought hey do have a somewhat jarring harshness to them; graininess is also there to be found. There could have been a bit more carbonation to lighten up the mouthfeel. Overall, not unpleasant, but certainly not something I would seek out again."
"It serves it's purpose as a utilitarian lawnmower beer, and I wouldn't turn one down, but why does it cost as much as other craft 6 packs?"
"After the Crack and Glug, I was looking at two rocky fingers of bone-white head with ""not bad"" retention. Color was a deep golden-yellow with NE-quality clarity. Nose had a pleasant lager sweetness, nothing wild or amazing, but no adjuncts, either. Mouthfeel was medium with a nice sweetish lager flavor in the mouth. It is enough to make me weep when I think of how many AALs I have drank when this would be the right way to make a lager. Finish was simply lager, unencumbered and tasty. I liked this better than I did initially, on draft at Old CHI and I could see putting some in my cooler. If that constitutes ""A Wisconsin State of Mind", I'm there. ""Not bad", indeed."
"I generally rate lagers higher than most other reviewers, but this beer did nothing for me. Clear yellow in color with a small, short lived head that settled to a thin skim of suds. Very little, if any lacing is left on the glass. Aroma of grain and a slight hint of lemon. Nothing remakable. The flavor is a slight improvement but not by much. Just the slightest hint of some Noble hops to compliment the otherwies unremarkable malt flavor. Slight lemon in the finish. Bitterness is low. Body and carbonation is average. Priced at $9.99 this is way overpriced as well. Buy a 12-pack of Dave's Brewfarm Select for a couple dollars more and you will be much happier."
"I would note, this beer seems to be on tap just about everywhere in Madison."
"it pours a slight hazed golden yellow with a brilliant white head with nice lacing and ring perfect for a lager..smell is malts,grain and bread.light hops...taste is the same is mostly malts and grain with hops in the background..good for a lager...mouth feel is thin a liitle watered but it tasted pretty good after a day of planting some perennials in the yard..i liked this brew its a lager and its ok in my book"
"Drinkable if that's what you're looking for, but don't expect much else."
"D: Very drinkable and refreshing. Good session beer for a warm summer night. A bit bit pricey for this type though."
"D-Decent enough but the lemony hops bother me a little and are a bit over bearing at times...this and Leinie Original are about the most hop forward beers of this style...hasa bite to it on the finish is another way to put it. probably true to form for old Macro Lager style....worth trying..drank most of these out of the can but poured this one into a glass and it is better that way.."
"Capital has brought out their Supper Club Lager, an homage to these wonderful places whose usual brew offerings are of the Bud/Miller/Old Style variety. It certainly falls in that camp, though...good? Reminiscent of Leinie's Original as well. Simple, drinkable, not for snobs. Kind of like Wisconsin itself."
"Watery, markedly devoid of significant aromas or flavors, a significant disappointment. You can find a faint hoppiness, some bready notes, but really nothing else."
"Pours a crystal clear yellow color, frothy white head that was gone quickly, no lacing. Grainy aroma, light toast, biscuity, no much in the way of hops. Taste is right on par. Grainy, bready, very light hops, but a lightly bitter and dry finish. Crisp, clean, nothing special going on here, but a good drinker."
"For every thing a time and place. No sense in really going out of my way to describe this beer, We have all had it before. This is a cut above many though. It's clean, no corn aromas or flavours, just sweet husky malts and a touch of floral hops. Finishes dry for the style. Refreshing and very well done."
"Drinkability: I would have this again, but I wouldnt go out of my way for it. I recommend this as a solid lager with a subtle citrus hop profile."
"drinkability not that good with little flavor and a high price"
"Not bad for the style. Simple and clean."
"A good, accurate and descriptive name for it, certainly!"
"One outstanding quality of this beer is how easy it goes down, the mouthfeel is crisp and refreshing, the flavors are ultimately clean, exactly what I'd expect for the style. Overall, I'm happy that I will have this alternative to BMC, or even Spotted Cow for that matter, at, I thinks it's safe to assume, pretty much every drinking establishment in Wisconsin."
"Drinkability - A pretty decent beer in a usually undistinguished category. Plus as a Sconnie, the supper club theme just feels good. In a bar with limited choices, I might choose this just because of the label."
"D: Awesome D. Perfect. If you guys are looking for a dark Impy stout, or a hopbomb, PLEASE go back and review the American adjunct lager style first, before slamming this because it's yellow, or, ""light"". Nicely done beer."
"I could see myself getting this again at a fishfry or...even a supper club."
"This is a crisp, sweet, refreshing, ad super sessionable lager with good balance.Maybe leaning a little more to the sweeter side, but thats just fine with me."
"Nice enough looking beer. Brilliant clarity and dancing bubbles coming up from the bottom of the glass. Nice head. Aroma not off to a good start. Taste confirms aroma. Diacetyl, DMS, mercaptan and astringency all playing a part. Not much good to say about it. Although the bitterness is a nice touch towards crispness. The crispness is interupted by the off characters. This one needs help to clean it up."
"Poured into a pint glass this brew is a pale straw color with a very thin white head that dissipated to nothing. There is a faint aroma of grain, almost a corn and grassy note as well, but not much. The taste is clean and crisp. Very thin taste but nice carbonation. This brew is a good lager, but just too light for me to enjoy one. This would be decent for a tailgate or a few on a hot summer night. Decent brew, but not great for the price."
"This beer pours a brilliant straw color with an ample white head that leaves a bit of lacing along my glass. The aroma is moderately malty, sweet and grainy with just a hint of European style hops. The flavor is dominated by malt upfront, grainy and a bit sweet followed by low hop bitterness and just a bit of hop flavor accentuated by medium-high carbonation. Overall this is a well made beer and I understand the intent of the recipe, however this beer doesn't really stand above others in its arena given the price. If the folks at Capital can get people to pay premium price for this beer, then kudos, but I'd buy a 6er of High Life or the 'old' Schlitz and save a few bucks."
"I hesistate to rate beers really high. That said, based on the style this is a HOME RUN. Keep it up Kirb."
" ~ Overall this is a good beer offering from my fellow Wisconsite from the south. I could certainly kick back with a six pack of this brew and watch a fire burn."
"Hahahahaha ya, well.... Trying to think of the biz plan for this: we're going to make an average cheapo beer, use a marketing gimmick, an there ya have it. That's what this is. While it's true this is what's common in the county supper clubs, so what? Wax nostalgic.Poured with a nice white head and good lace. Color is a clear amber. Aroma is world common beer with a little extra malt. Flav is the same. Body is world common and ok. Finish - ditto. Session if it's your only option."
"D - ""You can't fault 'em for making a beer to pay the bills."" as spoken by Todd. I agree with that statement. I've got two remarks on the label that stand out to me. ""Not Bad."" and ""A Wisconsin State of Mind."" First, it isn't bad, it's really drinkable but there isn't really any substance to it. Secondly, I hope that Wisconsin statement isn't meant to represent this beer as what all of Wisconsin wants to drink (although for most people it is), it just leaves a bad taste in my mouth (figuratively). Capital can do better, but again, you can't fault 'em for making a beer to pay the bills."
"I've been hearing a lot about this beer around town, tons of advertising. my wife picked up a 6 pack and we split a bottle tonight. looked decent enough, but the nose and then the taste was pretty bad. tastes like miller or any other macro brew. if anyone wants the other 5 bottles, let me know."
"drinkability is good. a solid lager with a drinkable aura. twice the concentration and this could be a great steam beer. cheers!"
"After a stop at the the brewery I was introduced to this beer. It tasted pretty good out of the tap so I figured I'd take a growler home and see what it's all about. It poured a golden straw color with lots of carbonation but little to no head. The aroma was faint. I got a whiff of sweet grain and a touch of malt. The flavor was a tad muted. Crisp and clean but not much flavor other then a bit of malt a slight hop bite. This seems like afairly light offering from Capital. The carbonation was decent but it felt very thin in the mouth. Not a bad beer overall. Not a great beer though either. I could drink this but, would rather have many other beers from this brewer."
"D- average, nothing great but nothing bad"
