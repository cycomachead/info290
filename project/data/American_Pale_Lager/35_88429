Aroma of sweet biscuit malt, light piney and grassy hops. Flavor is biscuit malt, grassy hops with light piney and citrus elements. Finishes with grapefruit and citrus hop bitterness and citrus rind. Medium bodied. Exactly what is expected from a India pale lager, with a classic lager body with distinctive grassy hops with piney and light resinous notes. The hops are well balanced with the crackery malt. A little of the distinctive Boston Beer light butteriness in the finish.","LiquidAmber","Sep 30, 2014"

Aromas of lager yeast, piney hops, biscuit malt, earth and floral notes. Almost like a hoppier version of Samuel Adams Boston Lager. Medium bitterness. Clean and refreshing. Lasting notes of earthy hops and a bitter tang. Honestly, this is much better than I expected. I haven't been too impressed with the many hoppy offerings in the Samuel Adams lineup, but I'd have this again.","Huhzubendah","Jul 04, 2014"

Nice light nose of citrus, grapefruit and sweet tropical, over a bit of biscuit. Light medium body with a smooth texture. Slightly above normal carbonation which imparts a nice effervescence on the finish. The flavor profile is a blend of hop flavor with very little bitterness. The hop flavor is citric, with a focus on grapefruit initially. The middle gets more tropical and ends with a nice biscuit crispness.

These citric hops dominate the flavor profile but the beer is more fuller body and not quite smooth like some IPAs. Not much sweetness in this beer as it is mostly dry and hoppy.

The hop aroma and flavor character provide the real character and uniqueness to this brew. It's not as aggressively hoppy like a West coast IPA nor as smooth as a classic Czech or German styled pilsner yet does a good job of combining these styles in an approachable way. No, it probably won't blow anyone's mind who likes a classic IPA or pilsner style by itself (well, maybe the pilsner lovers may find more in common with this hybrid brew), yet I'd wager most people wouldn't turn down having another if given a chance.

The beer does have some legs and leaves a little lacing but on the whole is quite thin. The aroma is pleasant with a large amount of citrusy hops and a nice malty backbone. The flavor follows the nose with a hop forward bitterness and a generous amount of citrus and grassy notes. This is an enjoyable pour; nothing outstanding but a great beer on a hot day or after a long shift. Definitely enjoyable but not of note.","lochef81","Jan 31, 2014"

I can see this being a really good session beer.","tmm313","Dec 30, 2013"

Poured at a good temperature with a decent, foamy, frothy, thick, long lasting, cream-colored head and plenty of lace. Color is a clear orange amber with loads of bubble trails. Aroma is hop, malt, fruit, bit of skunk. Flavor is like nose, largely loses the skunk, has a great balance between bitter, tang, and sweet right up front and dance around each other in the mouth. Body is spot on; ditto carbonation. Finish is like flavor, has good length and is great drinking! Hope to get more of this.","drpimento","Nov 13, 2013"

Flavor is of citrus, grapefruit pith and grapefruit heavy, pine notes dominate on the finish which is quite bitter. Malt and lager yeast flavors are minimal, leaving the hops to dominate. Mouthfeel is light bodied with high carbonation, very much like a lager. This beer is excellent, showcasing the West Coast hops, with minimal interference from malty sweetness. I thought I would have to homebrew an IPL, but apparently I wasn't the only one to think of trying this, and it seems to work quite well. A hit by Boston Beer Company.","Auraan","Jul 03, 2013"

Although it pours a relatively nice golden color with a frothy lightly tanned, white head (good lacing all the way down), what blew me away was its odor. You are assaulted with a mix of lemon, orange, pears, peaches, apples, and other citrusy scents. The same goes for the taste - I think I can taste them all and then some. As a lager, it also poses as a Indian Pale Ale (not something I really like) but it balances the fruity taste just right.

Piney and citrusy, pleasant boquette. The name Double Agent is well used, the hop flavor and aroma is there but the lingering bitterness you would expect from an IPA is abscent. Seems like a good ""wet hopped"" beer. Intense flavor, none of the bitterness - well done. Mouthfeel is medium to full in body with a minimal, inactive carbonation.

The nose is nearly all west coast hops, pine, grapefruit and floral not much of the malt in the smell. The taste is much like the smell with the hop flavors coming out front here the grapefruit really takes over. Along with the hop flavors there is a pretty good amount of bitterness on the level of a strong pale ale or weak IPA. Biscuity caramel malts are in there as well to provide a base but it is clear that the hops are the main focus here. The mouthfeel is interesting while the hops make one think of an IPA body is all lager. Light body with a nice clean, crispness that you just cant get in an ale. There is a good bit of carbonation in there that combined with the bitterness keep things tingly. The finish is a touch sweet with lasting bitterness that lingers on the tongue. Overall I'm a fan of this one, although it is kind of playing tricks on my mind. A good combination of a nice hoppy ale and a crisp clean lager.","fank2788","May 11, 2013"

Clear deep gold with small bubbles of carbonation rising. Intense hoppy nose...getting alot of Simcoe at first whiff. I'm gonna blaspheme here and admit I'm more of an ""old school"" hop guy...Simcoes and the newer varieties don't do it for me like Cascades, Saaz and Bullions do but anyways, quite a noseful here. The taste follows the aroma, lots of hops, some sweetness from the malt but the hop is the main attraction here. Finshes on a piney note backed with some sweetness and light tropical fruit. I don't care what Sam calls it, to me it has a hoppier Pale Ale written all over it. Nice as a one-off purchase but I won't be a repeat customer of this.","beerluvr","May 05, 2013"

Color was a deep-gold with NE-plus quality clarity and Croesus and Midas sat across from me, rubbing their hands together. The nose was grapefruit and pine and thanks to my deep inhalation, my eyes watered a little at its intensity. My mouth also began to water, but that was a separate issue. I could not wait any longer and went for my first sip. Mouthfeel was medium but the hops were intense on the tongue, burning away the old, dead taste buds and paving the way for a lot of taste. The taste showed that the hops had not been squandered, instead, intermingling and giving a real bite to a style that can often be unobtrusive. Finish was very dry, just the way this hophead likes his beers. I really like what they are doing with hops up there in Boston!","woodychandler","Apr 25, 2013"

The taste was juicy, citric, very clean, and had some bubblegum notes in mid sip, with clean finish. I drank the beer warm from the grocery store yesterday, and it taste a bit lifeless. With time to chill today, the beer was much more lively. The mouthfeel was very soft, aided by the pillowy head, and about a billion finely textured carbonation bubbles.

Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance and complexity of hop notes; a bit weak on strength. Taste of grapefruit, lemon zest, orange zest, orange rind, tangerine, pineapple, floral, light pine, light bread, and floral earthiness. Fair amount of floral citrus bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, citrus zest, pineapple, floral, light pine, and floral earthiness on the finish for a good bit.

Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth and fairly sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with hardly any warming noticed after the finish.

It leaves thin lacing that persists rather well. The beer is very clear and has absolutely no haze to it with great light penetration. The nose is a gorgeous citrus hop bomb recalibrated with that biscuit-like breadiness of a good lager. It really does open your eyes and I found myself very impressed with how well they worked well together. The taste was very good. It was crisp like a good lager, tasting of warm baked bread, but it has a strong resin and citurs punch as well. It was full of lime peel, resinous pine flavor, and a strong flavor of oranges and magoes. Very good and clean on the palate, perfect carbonation overall. This is a very good offerening from a very good beer company. This gives you the hop flavor a hop-head would love at a very sessionable 5% and the twist of the lager yeast just makes it nice and refreshing.","estlinska","Apr 07, 2013"

However, I tend to think any hop forward beer tastes the best within a month of being bottled/canned. After that length of time it's possible that the dank onion and garlic flavors could be more perceptible as the citrus/tropical fruit characteristics fade. That being said, I enjoyed Double Agent IPL if for no other reason than it was a great idea by Samuel Adams to create a super hoppy lager. I think it's an interesting avenue to go down that hasn't been experimented with nearly enough. Would I drink it again? Yes, the fresher the better.","JamesMN","Mar 19, 2013"
3.71,-0.5,3.5,3.75,3.75,3.5,3.75,"I give this the same B to B+ that I always seem to give sam adams regular releases. its good not great, feels more mass produced than crafted, but that said, is still a very enjoyable brew. the pour is a little more orange than the standard lager, and the head is an inch high and bone white but doesn't last long. smells hoppy, really hoppy actually, oily fruity hops, like gummy bears, with the familiar smell of a lager yeast. the flavor is less hoppy than the nose, which is okay in this setting. the beer is crisp and clean and very refreshing, but is lacking something. I think all well hopped lagers will be lacking for awhile, as I recently had humulus from the bruery and it blew my head off while setting the bar for the style. this one comes off a little thin and contrived, but its good nonetheless. lighter feel, great carbonation, medium hoppy finish, a good beer to ease in the warmer weather, but don't come into it expecting to be floored.","StonedTrippin","Mar 19, 2013"

3.38,-9.4,4.25,3.75,3.25,3.25,3,"Overall / Drinkability: Well, it drinks exactly as the brewer meant it - a combination of a west coast IPA and a lager. I'll give it high marks for creativity and for meeting exactly what they described it to be...except for the smoothness of the lager. That's missing because I think the hop wallop you get with this beer you need the higher level of sweetness from an ale yeast + caramel malts to balance against the hop bitterness. The lager is under there, but it's not sweet enough and when that sweetness comes out between the hop start and finish, it's odd...like its artificial or saccharine. So interesting concept, but for me, it's not working. One is enough - and I had a hard time finishing this one. Nice looking beer though - that lacing you get with the hops is certainly pleasant to look at.","damndirtyape","Mar 08, 2013"

It doesn't have a smooth malt backbone as most lagers do, it's not clean in the finish as a lager ought to be. It's obvious that BBC is trying to reach all of the lager nay-sayers to show them a lager can be made to their palate -- but there really is no reason since there are plenty of Pale Ales to make that contingent happy.","steveh","Mar 04, 2013"

This lager poured a clear copper color, produced a nice white head, very nice retention and ample lacing stuck on the glass. The aroma consisted of toasted pale malt, pine and citrus. Medium bodied, there is a foundation of toasted pale malted grain, fresh pine needles, citrus and spicy pepper. Smooth, bitter and dry finish. This is an awesome beer, well balanced you get the smoothness of a lager but with hop flavor and bitterness. The dry finish begs you to take another sip.

There are lots of tiny rising streaming bubbles in the beer. A path of lacing creeps down the glass as the head retreats. The aroma is of piney, resinous, grassy, and citrus type hops with some caramel notes from the malt. Make no mistake about it. The aroma is hop forward and the dankness was pretty apparent even when the bottle was just cracked open. The flavor is of a sessionable IPA with lager characteristics, which is what it should be since it is a lager. The hops are quite bright and forward with the pine, resin, grassy, and citrus flavors that were detectable in the nose. It has that grapefruit type flavor along with some tropical fruit. The malt backbone is also present with some caramel and biscuit type notes. The body is light to medium with moderate carbonation. The finish is crisp and slightly dry.

Pours a light copper hue with a translucent clarity and a fizzy, one inch, bright white head that quickly sizzles and pops as it recedes into a sudsy film. Nose reveals light, toasted malts with a slightly sweet character, citrus notes and a hint of earthiness. Taste consistent with nose; however, citrus character is expressed more as acidity than any specific fruit. Malt profile also comes off a little less sweet; however, light, earthy bitterness is still evident towards the back. Mouthfeel is light-medium in body (but closer to light) with a lively, almost prickly, carbonation and a semi-dry finish. Overall, a pleasant, easy-drinking APL.

3.79,1.6,4,3.75,3.75,4,3.75,"Overall I thought this was a nice beer and nice example of the style, it was a hoppy lager, just as promised, but the profile seemed to lack the balance I wish it had. This beer had good drinkability, it was fairly smooth, and the taste did an ok job at holding my attention, but I think one would be enough since I would get tired of the spicy hops. What I liked the most about this beer was the mouthfeel, it was just how it should be. What I liked the least about this beer was that the spicy hops were a little to overpowering, if the spicy and citrus hops were at the same level I think it would make this beer much more enjoyable. I don't think I would buy this beer on it's own, I would much rather have a Shift from New Belgium, that beer is a little better in just about every aspect, but I would still recommend giving it a try. All in All I thought this beer was solid, it was nice for what it is, I am happy that Samuel Adam's took a shot at this style, nice work guys, keep being creative.","StoutHunter","Jan 19, 2013"
3.98,6.7,4,3.5,4.25,4,4,"This beer is a completely clear, pale gold color. The foam is white and long lasting. The aroma is heavy with floral, herbal, and woody-smelling hops. Grass and malt are ther as well. Not fruity, but the hops do have a touch of citric in the background. Nice flavor! Balanced and drinkable. Nice up front sweetness and malt. Lots of hop flavor throughout the taste. Medium body. Very good.","Suds","Jan 19, 2013"

4.14,11,4,4.25,4.25,3.75,4,"It pours a clear golden amber with a frothy white head. Head retention is excellent and the lacing is moderate. It smells of piney hops with a bit of citrus and a subtle malt background. The taste comes across as grapefruit to me, almost entirely. the malt does shine through at moments, but the finish is definitely pure grapfruit. The mouthfeel in light and crisp with light, prickly carbonation. I have mentioned In previous reviews that I am not terribly fond of Samuel Adams, but I don't have any serious problems drinking this beer. It may be a little simple as far as flavor and taste go, but is shines brilliantly with Its bitter hops and malty highlights. Mmmm. I am very glad that this is in the Spring Variety pack.","silverking","Jan 14, 2013"
3.22,-13.7,3.75,3,3,3.75,3.5,"Pours a clear light golden color with a fairly thick white head. Good retention and lacing. Smell is pretty faint, not much to it. Very light hop notes, slight sulfur character. Taste is fairly bitter, with no truly discernible unique hop characteristics. Maybe a slight earthiness. Definitely got the flavor of a lager, the sulfur character carries to the taste. Medium carbonation and light body. Overall this beer is pretty disappointing, very bland with the character of a poorly executed standard lager. Definitely none of the ""india pale"" character you may be expecting. I will not be having this beer again.","scvance","Jan 13, 2013"

The hop profile is actually rather reminiscent of Laguntias's DayTime.","shand","Dec 31, 2012"
4.07,9.1,4,4.5,4,3.5,4,"O - I'm not a huge fan of Sam Adams because I prefer my beers to be less balanced and more hop forward, SA has stepped out of the box on this one and hopped it to high heaven. I would say next to the Hallertau Imperial Pils they brewed years ago this is the next hoppiest beer I've ever had from them. Nicely done and with an ABV of only 5% I can easily get my hop fix and not worry about losing my wits, this is a perfect session beer for the hop lovers. I can see the reviews being all over the board on this one as it deviates from the typical balanced beers they tend to brew.","jzeilinger","Dec 31, 2012"
