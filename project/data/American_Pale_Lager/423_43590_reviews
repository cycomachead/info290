"Smooth tasting beer without a harsh taste"
""
""
""

"O: A really tasty beer when I want to back off the hops and get my palate back on an even keel. My wife would enjoy this and is a good beer to initiate your friends into the world of craft beer. Another solid offering from Kansas City's Boulevard Brewery."
""

"T/O: Surprisingly sweetness from bready malts and addition of Munich and Cara 50, general sweetness, no caramel and kept clean.  Segues to a spicy peppermint, for lack of a better descript. Mild fruit sweetness-apple and pear. Good showcasing of German hops. Altogether, the crispness and carb level cut through any sweetness making this an extremely drinkable brew."

"OVERALL:  the brewer took great pride in making this beer incredibly clear, it would rival German beers.  this is a nice lager, very drinkable, I would recommend to anyone who enjoys beer."

"It would be a far shorter list to mention what's *not* drinkable about this beer. That would be a list with zero items. This is really, really well done. If you're into the ""if it ain't eleventy jillion percent alcohol and infinity IBUs then don't call me"" mode, you won't find this worth your time. This is a beer for a refined drinker who chases nuance and appreciates the art of brewing rather than one who enjoys getting slapped upside the head with huge flavor and jaw-clenching bitterness. It would also be great for a BMC drinker who wants to get into craft beer. I'll admit it bothers me a small amount when I see brews like this denigrated by craft beer drinkers who should know better. If one approaches this with the understanding of what it is supposed to be - a clean, mild, easy to drink and sessionable all-malt American style pilsner - rather than what it is not - a super-complex, rich, overhopped ale made from a recipe found in a UFO at Area 51, using the only known fruit from the last surviving species of a particular tree in the Amazon picked right before it was plowed under, barrel aged in Jesus' tomb, and carbonated with unicorn farts -- one can't help but be impressed. When drinking it, if you find yourself saying ""man, I'm not really tasting such-and-such", well hello. Now you're starting to get it. I'm extremely happy with the beer. If you've made it past the ""get me faced in one beer OR ELSE"" phase, definitely give this one a shot. Delicate, yet well worth drinking. I'm very impressed with what Boulevard has done here."

"O: It's good. I'd like a touch more malt sweetness to balance the hops and a touch more carbonation. Worth trying once but I wouldn't repeat."

"Pours to a thin white head with minimal lacing and intense golden yellow color. Aroma is grainy malt and hops. Flavor is a crisp, dry, balanced American lager without the blandness and corniness of the major brands. The hop flavor and bitterness offsets the residual sweetness of the malt. Flavor improves as it warms up and de-gasses a bit, which is rare for a pale lager. Light mouthfeel and generous CO2 to give it a refreshing feel. Overall, a solid beer in the tradition of pre-prohibition lagers known as ""Classic American Pilsner (CAP)"" . We can't get Full Sail Session Lager this far east and this product sort-of fills that ""CAP gap""."

"Very dark gold in color, starts out warm and biscuity but later on the hops kick in. It starts to taste more like a classic pilsner. I seek out Sam Adams Noble Pils but cannot find it. KC Pils is more than an adequate substitute, it is a great Pilsner in it's own right."

"Quite classic and enjoyable. The heft is surprising for it's smaller size."

"Overall: This beer according to the bottle is in the tradition of the George Muehlebach brewing co., And is considered to be a classic American lager according to Boulevard. The bottle reminds me of an old beer bottle my Dad used to drink and the taste reminds me of a Budwiser or Coors. So for this reason I will give it good marks for style."

"This comes across to me more as a premium all-malt American lager, rather than a German Pils. The hops seem low to me for a pils. The beer had almost no head and was golden in color. Malt sweetness came across in the smell and taste, but was still sufficiently balanced by hop. I'd think the malt is an American variety, which is fine for an American lager but not for a German Pils. It's a solid offering that is quite drinkable owing to the low ABV and mild flavors, but it is not especially distinguished, IMO."
""
""
"O: An average and easily-drinkable pilsner that is certainly a step above the rest in the style, but doesn't try anything unique and isn't bold enough to be anything too memorable."

"This is by far the best pilsner I've ever had. The color was your typical pilsner, light yellow and very clear, crystal clear. The aroma was a slight bitterness with floral notes from the hops. The taste was a light, refreshing taste that at first was the hop bitterness and followed closely by a graininess. I'm not a huge fan of pilsners but this was a good offering."

"Overall- Not bad but I would prefer Boulevard's Boss Tom's Golden Bock over this."

"Overall – I’m more of a dark beer fan during the cold months, and it was cold when I had this beer, but I can tell it is a pretty good one. I am looking forward to the summer when I can put some more of this down, as it suits the warmer weather a little better (IMO). A good example of the style, Boulevard does it well again. I would recommend this beer, drink it again, and buy it again."
""
"Overall: An easy session beer with great flavor. Excellent grilling beer in the spring or summer."
""
"Poured into a Gulden Draak tulip. Pours a clear orange amber, thin white medium head that dissipated quickly but left light lacing. Aroma is typical pilsner; sweet bready malt, light hops and citrus. Mild flavor of sweet malt, with hints of lemon and grains. Light hops finish. Light bodied. Pleasant and refreshing, but light flavor. A satisfactory pilsner."

"As a testament to it's drinkability, last summer I drank a sixer of this (shared a couple) and drank it all before putting down any notes.This is a nearly flawless pilsner, consume as fresh as possible for best results. No surprise it won gold at WBC last year."
"Drink- This was very tasty. I like what Blvd does with more of there beers and this was no exception. A style I normally don't like was very good."
"I'd compare this to Budweiser; Blvd. wins on color and flavor and aroma are about the same with a little more maltiness to this pilsner."
"Overall: A clean, refreshing, light yet flavorful pilsner. Will definitely buy again."
"D: This is very drinkable.  A very well balanced pilsner that is traditional but has some very nice subtle qualities that set it apart and make it tasty and refreshing.  Absolutely perfect beer after mowing the lawn or sitting in the summer heat.  "
"O: No better than avg IMO."
"As expected, Boulevard's take on the retro lager is solid but unspectacular. Enjoyable with an avocado salad and salsa."
"This beer stays alive after its poured,lots of bubbles and nice frothy head. Clean smell,floral wheat,honey,aroma,again clean crispness that continues from the nose to the palate.No after taste. Has a good malt and hop combinations,no ""tug of war"". Definitely worth keepin in stock at home. Great after mowing the grass!"
"What a great beer for the summer season - exceptionally enjoyable to drink."
"The Boulevard Pilsner is a smooth drinking pilsner. The color was golden clear in color with not much head. There was no smell other than hints of grain. The beer was a very solid pilsner with great taste, it was not over powered by grain. The mouthfeel was very nice, this beer is easy drinking."
"Very nice overall. It doesn't have stand out character but does a great job of providing a balanced and easy drinking Pilsener. This a well crafted beer that is a joy to drink with a very good price point. This is my second six pack and plan on buyig more foe the summer months."
"A perfect hot day drink or after a run. Crisp and refreshing while having a good flavor."
"I give it a very enthusiastic exceptional rating! (and I don't give that lightly either, it was just that good in my opinion)"
"Drinkability- Great pilsner! But could only enjoy 2 or 3 tops... Had two and moved on. I could see how this won awards though!"
"Super drinkable. With all the big, bold, thick, and spicey brews I've been drinking lately...man I just needed something clean and light. This was perfect for that. This could be a great gateway beer for the craft beer virgins out there. Also, a perfect hot day post lawnmower goto."
"It's a light, well done beer that would do well in a number of situations."
"Hey. I like this Boulevard Pilsner. It's just a refreshing glass of beer I could drink lots of. I'm used to 6%+ alcohol so bring it on (only bought one 12-oz bottle from New Seasons at Orenco Station, Or.) Remember now, coming from big-beer land this is quite a revelation for me. So this is Pilsner. Nice. Reminds me champagne? Is that a good thing to say about Boulevard's offering? Label says it's a ""Genuine American Lager"". Whatever. It's a good beer and definitely a Pils. Perle, Saaz hops. We'll be visiting Bamberg, Germany and that's where it's at for this style. Only 8 breweries according to Wikipedia."
"Average drink. Certainly refreshing on a hot day, but nothing I'd go out of my way to pick up."
"12 oz single. Like the simple Czech style label! Pale yellow beer with a bubbly white head. Typical. Aroma..what aroma? getting virtually nothing..some cereal malts and thats it. Taste thankfully is rather fuller than the aroma., well malted with a good citricy hop presence. Pretty nice on the palate for style, quite ""full"". Overall a pretty nice drinking lager..not sure if i would call it a pilsner."
"D. Supremely drinkable. A great example of the style that I'm glad I got to try."
"This tastes like how BMC should taste. Too bad I didn't find this until the fall, it would have made a great summer beer."
"Taste is as the aroma mostly, firm with full-bodied fruity grain, some apple, honey, hay, and grass. It is lightly sweet with a light, zesty-spritzy grassy-spicey hop bitterness underlying. Feel is good, firm and lively, and drinkability is incredibly high."
"Beautiful deep malt bready taste, sweetness in the middle is sublime, balanced at the end with the hop additions. Just right and very smooth on the palate. Not overly fizzy, just right, a perfect drinker if you just want a good beer you don't have to think about to understand it. It is what it is and should be, and that's enough."
"Moderate carbonation and fairly full-bodied while retaining a light mouthfeel. Slight malt sweetness up front followed by some lemony citrus and a dry finish with just a touch of bitterness. Well-balanced pilsner; refreshing and very drinkable."
"Nice, thick, full white head, stays there for a while. Golden yellow color. A nice looking pilsner. Hops, malts and a touch of sweetness in the smell. Good pilsner taste, less bite than most pilsners, more smooth and easy drinking than most that I've had from Germany. About the right amount of carbonation, an active mouthfeel. A low alcohol content, and perhaps a touch too heavy for a long drinking session. But good for any season and any occasion, a pleasant beer. Not awe inspiring, but a good job by Boulevard."
"Saw this one today at the liquor store and, I have to admit it, I was immediately attracted to the vintage looking bottles/labels. Cracking one open at home, it poured a nice sunny yellow color, with a good white head. Somewhat grassy on the nose, crisp, decent malt present. I had high hopes for this one, and it didn't let me down."
"Drinkability: not bad. Refreshing and relatively light; but for the sweetness this would rate a bit higher."
"D: Very retro and very easy to drink. A nice beer overall."
"Pours a gold color, good clarity, thin head leaving some lacing. Aroma is very feint, tastes clean and crisp but with a slight metallic sense and no real significant hops or malts -- this is a real generic type lager in the American (not German) style, I'm a nut for good pilsners but this one sadly falls short. If the goal here was to produce an American lager without the gagging bad taste of a Bud or Miller, good job. If it was to create a good pilsner with a flavor profile, go back to ""start."""
"The flavors were also about average for the style, again smooth, even grains and nicely balanced hops. The body and drinkability were also typical. Light, smooth, crisp, refreshing and very drinkable. Overall, a decent example of the style, worth trying when you see it."
"D. The definition of drinkability. Definitely a good session beer for me. Simple, clean, crisp and refreshing."
"Overall this is a good pils, but I'd personally classify this one more in the way of a Czech vice a German Pilsner... Not enough hops for the German style."
"For being a light pilsner it is better than average. It doesn't have that nasty aftertaste many pilsners have. Worth trying especially on a hot day."
"D: One could, foreseeably, drink many of these beers without issue, but why?"
"Overall a good Pilsener that I would pick up again"
"Overall, quite flavorful and easy drinking, tasted fresh despite the freshness date being about 3 weeks past. (Spokane, WA dist. sucks!)"
"Drinkability is outstanding! This is an excellent brew to enjoy during the spring and summer months (or year round for that matter.) Very impressed with this offering."
"drinkability - this one is a great summer beer, flavorful, easy to drink"
"d - I did not think it was a very good pils at all. There was almost nothing to the smell or taste; I wouldn't want to have again."
"D: Average at best and not one I would seek out again. Another underwhelming Boulevard beer."
"Pours crystal clear pale amber with a one finger head. The head recedes quickly but leaves good lacings on the sides. Aroma somewhat corny. Taste is Pilsener all the way but has that corny touch that says adjunct lager. Good body for the style and has the Pils lightly bitter semi-dry finish. This would be a good beer for your macro-swilling Buds to branch out a bit. Easy drinker, low abv is even better. Best by date about three weeks from now."
"If I were comparing this to the other available examples, it would rate way, way above average. However this isn't a curve - I'm rating it based on what the style could/should be, not on the lack of better-than-craptastic competitors."
"drinkability - i dont see me buying this again with some macros out there with more flavor"
"D- I loved this beer this is a BBQ beer from a BBQ capital"
"Quaffable and quenching."
"Pours a clear golden with a big white head. Smells slightly of dough with a hint of sulfur. Taste is somewhat bland, macro lager light grainyness and a hint of sour apples. Decent bitterness levels though. Mouthfeel is somewhat thin, high carbonation. Drinkability is good, light and refreshing. Not a very good pilsner, but a tiny step up from your average macro lager. Somewhat dissapointing."
"Cheers."
"We're not a target market. Or, we are, but not the usual, bad sense. We're a target market in that we like stuff that doesn't suck, and if marketers are just now beginning to realize that, well, bully for them."
"overall an okay pilsner."
"Mouthfeel was smooth and medium in density. Light/medium carbonation. May be better when very fresh (but what pils isn't)."
"Slick and sharp, the feel is good and the body is pretty full for lager. Sessionable... definitely. A very good one to push on your beer novice friends, for there's nothing offensive about it."
"It has golden body with a thick soapy white head. The lacing is tight and has a lot of staying power the aroma is faint but some what grassy. It has a mild grassy taste with some metallic and hop tones at the end. It is a little bit citric. The body is very light. Overall a very mild but refreshing and easy to drink beer."
"Simply put, this is what Budweiser, Miller High Life and Coors would taste like in a perfect world. Boulevard Pilsner is simple (in a good way), straightforward, balanced, flavorful, well-brewed and drinkable. Trying to help a macro drinker see the light? Start here."
"d- This is a bit different from other pilsners I've had, but it's tasty and says it's a throwback to pre-prohibition KC lagers, so I'll take it. Very good, simple, delicious american lager, and the price is oh so right. Nice new offering from Boulevard."
"This beer tastes light and crisp but is fulller bodied that I expected, which is a very welcome surprise. Soft carbonation up front with a nice dry earthy hop presence up front that lingers over the pilsner malt backbone into a sweet, slightly dry finish. This beer is excellently balance wit the perfect amount of dry hoppines, sweet pilsner malt, light crisp apple and pear, straw and glass notes. Another nice offering from Boulevard and an excellent interpretation of the style."
"My first impressions of this beer are better than my overall impression. It can start to taste macro after a while, which it isn't all bad if that's what you're shooting for."
"Overall a good beer very drinkable."
"While the original Boulevard Pils was a decent beer made even better by its price, the KC Pils has build on that foundation, and added flavor in all the right places. This is one of the big hits of the summer so far."
"A great American all-malt lager. I love the retro throwback all the way down to the bottle presentation and I especially love Blvd.'s tribute to the history of KC brewing. Oh, and the price is just right."
"D: Easy to drink. I've had a couple of waay-too-sweet Pils lately, this is right on target with the style."
"D: Probably my favorite pilsner. The more I drink this beer the more I appreciate it. Like most lagers I've had, even the BMC's, it is an easy drinker. If they would put this in cans it would replace my usual lawnmower beer. (You know drinking large quantities of BMC beers is safer without the risk of broken glass!)"
"I've never been more impressed by a Pils/lager. Incredible. Boulevard has a hit on their hands. You could taste the fruitiness a bit more. The hops actually gave this beer even more of an improvement - what a well done Pils. So crisp, clear, fruity and drinkable. Most drinkable beer on the market today."
"A solid beer - but I somehow think of this as more of a Vienna Lager with those non-pils malt notes coming through."
"Drinkability is high. The flavor profile is pleasing and easy to enjoy. The ABV is presumeably low which makes for a nice package on a sessionable beer."
"Mouth is typical and drinks easy. This will be a regular in warmer months especially for the price. Not bad overall, definitely better than the tap version I tried at the brewery a few years back."
"Not a lingering aftertaste in this one, which is good. Somewhat crisp. I would say clean feeling. Served cold and it hit the spot. But I'm a hops guy, so off to the hoppy beers."
"D: This is a good example of a pilsner: simple and tasty; this might become a go to session beer"
"A refreshing, easy drinking traditional pils."
"Drinks pretty easy, but nothing to get too excited about here, I hoped for more to be honest. A rare miss from Boulevard"
"this is a very easy drinking beer. nothing spectacular and something the macro crowd could easily enjoy without stepping too far out of their macro box. nice malt flavors but needs more hops to add to the crispness."
"After having Sierra Nevada Summerfest-I know it's a Czech Pilsner, not a German one-I expected a small hop bite in a refreshing and smooth beer. This beer offered nothing. BMC esque. I love Boulevard minus this beer. Disappointing. Other reviews describe flavor, so I will review again. Unless I don't get more before moving back to VA in a couple of weeks."
"A very sessionable and solid pilsner from Boulevard. I found it recently for $4.99 a sixer. A good bang for your buck."
"A tasty brew, but do we really need another pilsner on the over-saturated market? I'd rather go with their Single Wide or Pale Ale."
"D - Decent beer, but not a German pilsner. I think the brewer's intent was a Premium American Lager and in this respect it succeeds. I suppose it's 'highly drinkable' in a BMC-kind-of-way (in comparison). However, I probably won't go out of my way for it. (Good 'gateway' beer though)"
"D- with a small hop flavor and very crisp and refreshing taste I kinda hope they put this one in a can for a nice day on the rivver and this is a great beer to get someone into the craft scene"
"Boulevard seems to be appealing more to the BMC drinkers of the world than to craft drinkers with this pilsner. Good enough, and difficult to beat at the price point (currently cheaper than Bud), but not what I'd expect from such an accomplished brewery."
"Creamy white head, clear golden body. Bright toasty malt aroma with notes of floral hops. The flavor is classic pils; lightly toasted malt with a floral, grassy hop flavor. Bitterness is low, but sufficient for balance. Mouthfeel is spot on. I could drink a gallon. Thanks John!"
"Pours a clear, golden color. 1/3 inch head of a white color. Slight retention and poor lacing. Smells of pale malt, yeast, grain, slight citrus, and a hint of hops. Fits the style of a German Pilsener. Mouth feel is smooth and crisp with an average carbonation level. Tastes of pale malt, yeast, grain, and slight hops. Overall, slightly better than average pils., but it does not hold a candle to other boulevard brews."
"Light bodied medium carbonation. Very sessionable beer. I'm not about to jump ship from bully's other offerings for this guy, but I would grab one of these over a macro without hesitation."
"D - This is a really good pilsener. It's sweet and tasty with a great finish."
"D - VERY drinkable for a summer beer. Something the average female drinker would not spit out. A good beer to have a few while hanging out with friends at a bbq."
"Had to Blip two for this one. ""Kansas City Papa"" by Leadbelly, and ""Kansas City"" by James Brown."
"D - I was glad to see Boulevard come out with this. It's a good take on a traditional style. Nothing fancy or extreme. Just a good,solid, well made beer. I could drink a few on a hot summer day....like today!"
"Light bodied, well carbonated and very drinkable. This will be very nice on a hot summer day, especially when you want more than one. The way lager should be."
"Boulevard's Unfiltered Wheat is the best selling craft beer in the American midwest, but with the proper distribution I think that Boulevard Pilsner could challenge it. This beer has the crossover potential to make Boulevard some serious money (and if that leads to further capability to experiment with their fabulous Smokestack Series, then all the better). It also happens to be a tasty, easy-drinking lager in its own right. What an excellent summer afternoon beer."
"Incredibly drinkable, disappears before you know it. A nice addition to their lineup. I'm sure there will be a lot of anti-lager folk who won't be impressed - Boulevard provides a dozen alternatives for them. This one suits me."
"Overall- This beer makes sense as a grab for the Bud market. Its not challenging, but it's not supposed to be as a pils, I guess. I just wish my friends at boulevard had a new angle to contribute to this style."
"Thanks to the staff at my favorite beer bar for this experimental beer. The bottle has Test Pils II 08 stamped on it. Poured a 12oz bottle into my Unibroue Tulip. This beer pours a hazy straw with a big 2 inch head that left minimal lacing on the sides of the glass. The aroma is grainy with slight hints of sulfur and really just a very clean aroma. The taste follows suit. Very clean, very crisp, straight forward, and doesn't hide anything. The mouthfeel is light and crisp. This is a really great beer done by some great brewers. I really hope they put it out. It could definitely be my next go to beer, especially during the summer."
"Beer is moderately carbonated which makes it pretty damn drinkable. Good example of a pilsner."
