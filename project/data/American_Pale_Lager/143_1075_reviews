"This lager was pretty good. It was not what I expected, it was lighter than I thought that it would be. It smelled really good as well. The taste was not that bad, I know that I liked it. If anyone has not had this beer They should try it out. That is if you like this kind of beer, It had a golden look to it. I know that I have always liked Shiner beers, so if their are anymore out their that I have not had I can't wait to try them."

"Taste is similar, grain, apple peels, grass, hint of 7-up, dryish mineral water throughout, faint sweetness amd bitterness lingering with grassy element, lingering hint of grain."

"12 oz bottle poured into a 14 oz ""pint"" glass. Pours transparent straw with little head. Smells of some sweet grain, possibly some corn. Tastes of a little watery grain. Beer is light bodied heavily carbonated. Overall a slightly below average beer, but better than most adjuncts."

"Pours a straw-yellow with a small head that dissipates fairly quickly with not much lacing either. Light aroma of malt, grain with a touch of honey. The taste started out with a good amount of carbonation with sweet malt but finished a little on the dry side. Overall it wasn't that great."

"O: This seriously needs more hoppiness to it. What's sad is that this missing feature is all that stands between Shiner Blonde being just another crappy AAL (which it is) and a wholly solid pre-pro pils. A shame, really."
""
"Overall an uneventful adjunct lager. Quaffable however."

"Standard macro lager. Tastes more like a light lager. Meh."

"Where it really falters is charging more than other BMC quality stuff. Decent enough to give someone without feeling really embarassed, but don't bother buying these in quantity, pick up some PBR, Olympia, Rolling Rock etc. . . they all do the same thing, but this is a little more expensive for some reason."

"This beer is better than Major Brand X Lite, but not by a lot."

"O- Wow. I figured, out of all in the variety sixer I got, this would only be enjoyable to drink in order to quench my thirst after an intense workout but it's not even accomplishing that for me. This is not what beer is supposed to be like. It's like they didn't even try."
""
""
"That's because of how low the alcohol was, which I never tasted or felt from start to finish. Session beers don't get much of obvious than this and had I bought another, it would have gone down just as easily afterwards. It's nice to find a brew of this style without the fillers that the mass-market beers consist of. Here is just an unassuming beer that goes down nicely without much thought and once in a while, that can be a great thing. I may give this a go again in the Summer!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The aroma is so mild as to be almost non-existent. The flavor is mild and on the malty side. This is a very light beer, really, a nice one for what it is, kind of a high class lawnmower beer if you will. Pleasant enough, goes down easy."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A nice clean crisp lager. It was worth trying, if you like a basic beer."
""
""
""
"It's a good lawnmower beer, or a substitute for AALs. It's not much to write home about though."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"There are many other beers at the same price point that are better."

"Popping the top it's a bit of adjunct smell. Pours to a bright yellow with wispy white head that disappears in an instant. Taste has a bit of grape and yeast but fades to a weak grape. Mouthfeel is very carbonated, apparently carrying the lack of backbone. Not a keeper."
"A decent enough drink."
""
""
""
""
"A blonde with a shiner is never a good combination in real life... Anyway, this stuff pours a clear straw topped by a relatively short-lived finger of lightly off-white foam. The nose comprises mildly funky wheat, light grass, and a touch of whole-kernel corn. The taste brings in more of the same, but with more corn, which is now even sweeter than before. The body is fairly light, with a light moderate carbonation and a sorta watery feel. Overall, a pretty limp blonde, barely a step-up from your average adjunct lager."
""
"I suppose a taste test would reveal whether this is better than Keystone, but we'll probably never know. From the 12 oz bottle as part of the ""Family Reunion"" six-pack."
"Overall Drinkability: Just a bad-below average beer overall."
""
""
"The body was nicely full for the style, but yet stayed crisp, even, and clean. Drinkability was very nice, the beer went down quickly and easily. Overall, a nice little beer. Nothing spectacular, but probably worth throwing a sixer in the fridge to have when you're in the mood for something a little lighter."
""
""
""
""
"Medium-ish body, lighter than expected carbonation. Nothing to really recommend this brew except it is better than the megabrew offerings."
"Overall – Quite simple and easy drinking. If looking for a session brew or when looking for something very simple, then this will work just fine."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel: Its mouthfeel is spot on where I was expecting it."

"Shiner Blonde reminds me a lot of Labatt Blue. It is a simple straight ahead all-malt lager that isn't really memorable. For about a buck a bottle, you can't complain as it beats out nearly every adjunt lager and will suffice in washing down some food. I may come back to this in the Shiner variety pack, even though there isn't much variety, as it offers a lot of acceptable beers at a low price."
""
""
""
""
""
"Single finger head with better than expected retention and decent lacing on a bright straw colored clear body. Lots of breads and biscuits with grain notes for the aroma. Flavor is very light with more grains, minimal malt presenece and a sharp bitter note which comes and goes as it rests on the palate. Light body and high carbonation. This one is very bland and plain. Refreshing and no bad after taste but unimaginative."
""
""
""
""
"It's good! I had been looking for an everyday beer since Stroh's committed suicide by aquiring Schlitz and ruining themselves. I bought a 6 of bottles and was quite happy with the overall product. A very good, crisp taste that does not linger on well after the drink. This is not a beer snob beer. It's a working guys beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"Another from the Shiner variety 6 pack. A pretty decent blonde, easy drinking and tastes pretty good. You can't ask for much more from a blonde."

"Body is on the light side and the carbonation is crisp. The refreshing feel of the beer and the overall dryness made it a very nice choice on a broiling Sunday afternoon during a backyard barbeque. Maybe a little watery but that’s to be expected, I think. Certainly nothing profound here but a nice example of the style and an easy drinking quencher."
""
"Overall: this beer has little flavor and was hard to finish since it was so bland."
""
""
""
""
""
"Average, bland macro. Maybe some extra sweetness and metal. It would be a session beer that could be refreshing on a really hot freakin' day, otherwise it isn't worth a crap."
""
""
""
"O: Pretty easy to drink and definitely sessionable but really nothing super special or interesting about this beer. I think it would be super easy to drink outside on a hot summer afternoon in Texas."
""
""
"D: Basic sort of lager. Sort of straddles style – too flabby for a Pils, not rich enough for a Dort, some almost cream ale traits. But it drinks alright. It would be a fair to good hot day beer. And it does have enough spine for some milder food."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: comes across as a Amer. light beer. Nothing like a Belgian blonde. It is hard to believe there is a light version of this beer. Suitable as a dining beverage or thirst quencher."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, I liked it. I didn't expect to like it, but I did."
""
""

"O- Not too impressed, got this in a reunion sixer. I would like to try this on tap somewhere and see if maybe I got a bad bottle."

"Pours the color of straw with a finger length white head that dissipates quickly. The smell is very mild, but I could pick up some malt. The taste is fairly crisp and clean and the hop flavor is mild. If I had to sum up the taste, I'd say it was fairly average. The mouthfeel was light. This is an average beer overall. I picked this up as part of the Shiner Family Reunion six pack."
"This is in the league of Bud Light, Coors light etc. except a bit better. I could see kicking back a few after mowing the lawn on a hot Texas summer day."
""
""
""
""
"Beer pours a light, golden yellowish color with light head and foam. Brew smells sweet and light, with a nice malty taste to finish it off. Very surprisingly good beer, worth a try. This is a perfect beer for a summer barbeque, or a light meal. This is one of the better blondes I have tried in some time. Its not too expensive, so its worth a try."
"Poured this 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. It produced a clear straw color, a average white head and there was some lacing left behind on the glass. The aroma consists of corn and malted barely. Light in body, this lager was smooth, easy to drink and well balanced. The taste of fresh grain appears but not much else. There is maybe a dash of hops added- clean brew, nothing exciting but that is more of a result of style. If I had my choice to drink this or Budweiser- i would choose this one- However that doen't say much. Ok session beer, good summer beer. Prost!"

"This lets down the 'family reunion' six pack. The Kosmos Reserve lager is miles better."
""
""
""
""
"Tastes like a pretty legit pale lager. It's a lot better than Shiner Blonde Light. That stuff was terrible. I'm not really a huge fan of this style, but I can't really find anything wrong with it. It's boring as hell, but it's a bit above average if anything. Maybe I've been drinking too many adjunct lagers because this tastes almost good. Sorry I can't be more helpful, I just don't drink a lot of American Pale Lager. This one seems good for what it is."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A less than spectacular beer, but about par for the course for the style."
"Overall - if you take this beer and put it up against the cheap adjuncts, it comes out crisper and more refreshing than most all of them. Great beer for picnics, crab feeds etc. I really like the lightness and refreshness of this one. Probably the best Shiner beer I've sampled to date."
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Remarkably underwhelming, for the price. I could have paid less money and gotten a whole bunch of other beers that pretty much taste the same. I do not think I will be buying it again, but if it was a hot day and I was offered one, I'd still drink it. It's still beer."
""
""
""
"In all honesty, this beer sucks. However, there is nothing offensive about it. It's definitely better than your average BMC."
""
""
""
"O-A good beer for its class. Very light. I would drink this kind again if I was thirsty for it."
""
"I'll probably not be having this one again as it is just too much like a ""lite"" beer for my tastes."
""
"I got this as part of the ""family reunion"" variety pack but it's not something I really have any desire to drink again."
""
""
""
"Overall pretty much the lightest Blonde I ever had so it will be the base line as such. Might give the rest to my friends."
""
"D - Simple, watery, and low quality. It's drinkable and slightly better than most macros, but that ain't saying much."
""
""
""
""
"O. Not too bad of a lawnmower beer. Not much aroma or flavor, but easy drinking and refreshing. Would probably grab over any BMC."
""

"Situation: NBC comedy Thursday... Glassware: Ommegang pokal... Appearance: champagne gold body with a thin but noticeable off-white head--good effervescence... Aroma: nondescript notes of Saaz hops... Palate: crisp, dry palate--a fizzy finish... Taste: mellow lager/pilsner predictability--not bad, but again...a bland blonde...having trouble distinguishing the variety in this variety case... Overall: I imagine a blonde should be crisper and more refreshing than its lager brethren; this is only slightly moreso, and I am straining to find the subtle differences between this and any other..."
"Overall ridiculously easy to drink, feels like a total lawnmower beer, but really lacking in providing anything interesting to the palate. I can't say any reason to even drink this again."
""

""

"12 oz bottle. Pours golden hue with a small, short-lived, white head and soda like carbonation. Nose reminded me of Belgium Sour Red in the beginning then hints of grassy hops and some malt appeared. Light, very crisp body. Taste is of light hops and sweet malt. I would recommend this brew to my macro-drinking friends."
"Overall Impression- Very easy to drink but would probably sway to other Blonde Ales available. Nothing against you guys Spoetzl but this just wasn't a huge hit for me. Ill stick to all the other brews in the line up."
"I wish there was more to say about this beer. It is just thin and bland."
"I just dont get how I use to like Shiner beers. I bought the variety pack and it has a Shiner Blonde in it. The beer appearance is very average and boring. The smell has a slight amout of corn and malt. The taste is of wheat and really not much else. The mouthfeel too me is kind of below average. It has a decent amout of carbonation and sort of burns. Overall this beer is not good. I have never cared for anything Spoetzl and this doesnt help their case."
"D: Well, its what I expected...but it sure is drinkable? Light, crisp, lowish abv, though, I wouldn't buy it again."
"o: not bad at all.. better than most macros."
"Overall - I like this beer a lot.. Shiner Bock is one of my favorites and this one is good too"
"Dr. Easy, for the type, cold is best. A better BMC lager."
"The appearance and smell just are ordinary. The taste is a matter of its own. It tasted somewhat stale like you'd see in cheap lagers that you always avoid. The aftertaste is strong and not very pleasant. For me, it's almost tasting like stronger version of Coors Light or Tecate Light."
"All and all a drinkable beer for a hot day."
"I personally would prefer this beer over any of the other mainstream pale lagers out there. The fruity qualities are a nice bonus. This was a very refreshing brew that is perfect for a hot day."
"My pour created a big fluffy finger of bone-white head with moderate retention. Color was a pale lemon-yellow with NE-quality clarity. This was a Greg Koch Special, to be sure! Nose had a light lager-like honey sweetness underlain by a very light sulfurous odor, but nothing terribly untoward. Mouthfeel was thin and watery and the immediate taste in the mouth was of metal, followed by a lager sweetness. Did I get this out of a CAN? No! But I definitely tasted metal and that was not pleasant. Finish was less obtrusive, but I still had that metallic tang in mouth well after the swallow. I CANnot remember whether I liked it in the CAN, but if my scores were better than from a bottle, stick to a CAN."
"Overall, this is just a poor showing. Tastes sour and drinks to full and not crisp and refreshing enough for the style despite the lack of malt body flavor."
"This is a very forgettable beer. Maybe refreshing for a hot summer day, but it's not a beer you want to enjoy for flavor. I'll pass next time."
"O-one step above an adjunct lager. its really not too bad. its fairly boring, but also pretty refreshing. its not something i would necessarily get again, however if i had to drink it, i wouldn't be too upset."
"Not a blond I would tell anyone about."
"O: I don't like bashing beers, but this one just doesn't have what it takes. I have had other Shiner styles that I like, but this one...not so much."
"Summary - This definitely isn't Shiner's best brew. There is just nothing special or memorable about it. A decent choice if you enjoy a lighter beer every now and then."
"Apple juice looking beer with a ton of carbonation but no head, no lacing, nothing. A light fizzy yellow beer. Smell was very faint and almost non-existent. Peach and maybe some spice. Grainy. Paper thin and watered down. This almost got poured down the drain but I decided to give it a fair shot. Still not working for me."
"If you are on this site, don't get this beer."
"Overall, blonde is kind of an overstatement in what this is doing, unless it's a 'dumb blonde' joke. I expected better from Shiner. Barely better than an average macro."
"Pours a clear pale yellow straw color. Not a bad head but it dissipates quickly. Light aroma, little bit of husky grain and maybe a bit of citrus. More of the same on the palate. Overall this is a bit of a step up flavor wise from the macro lagers but not by too much. Good beer for a hot day, or maybe a good bridge beer for not craft drinkers."
"Overall: Average pale lager, but without major flaws and certainly quite drinkable. In my opinion, one of Shiner's better offerings."
"There's nothing exciting happening here, but nothing too terribly off either. The light body makes it go down easily."
"O: Not very representable of the style."
"RJT"
"O: Exactly as advertised: really light and refreshing. Would take this over a BMC light/lite any hot Texas day. I think I'll pass on the Light Blonde that just came out, though. This one's light enough, already."
"O: Probably best as a lawnmower beer. Just an average pale lager."
"Honestly I think this was my favorite Shiner just due to the fact that I consider it a lawnmower beer and it accomplishes that goal handily. The ""fancier"" Shiners just fall way short of their goal while this one seems to have hit its desired mark."
"Overall-If I was thirsty I could down a few of these cold just for the hell of it. Besides that, this beer is close to not even being beer. Drain poured half way through cause not even worth it. Next beer..."
"Overall: Not worth it for the price. Would make for a good lawnmower beer if the price was right, maybe $6 a six pack or less (Okay so I got it in a Shiner mixed 6 so maybe this particular brew would be cheaper than the mixed 6 was, but the mixed 6 was the same price as the Bock and 102). But, its not a bad brew, just average in every way."
"Moderate carbonation and a light mouthfeel. Some lemon and slight grassiness up front followed by a bit of bread. Doesn't scream blonde to me, more like a slightly sweeter pilsner in character. Easy drinking but not memorable."
"If you are looking for complexity of flavors and aromas, this is definitely not your beer. However, there is a certain purity to the brew that makes it a great laid back summer beer. The color is very light, very thin, and not a ton of taste. However, this beer will never surprise of overwhelm you, only retain a crisp and refreshing finish. Good both warm and cold. Shiner brews are definitely growing on me."
"O: A very easy drink but almost no flavor.. Incredibly dissapointed by this beer. Will not try again"
"There is very little character to this, like most beers this style. But it is well brewed - pure, clean, crisp, refreshing. Drink a bunch and you will be fine but you will need to pee!"
"Flavors, not too hoppy,and maybe a little flat in taste. In short I guess I have tasted worse."
"Never the most exciting style, but hey it was part of the mixed 12 pack. To be honest though, this is a pretty good beer. Pours a nice golden color, lots of lively bubbles. Taste is light to medium bodied, nice crispness to it. Finishes nice and clean with a tinge of hop bite. Nothing special, but as far as blonde ales go you can't do much better. Nice easy drinker on a hot day."
"Overall Drinkability - One of the crappier shiners. Almost refreshing, but not quite. Something is lacking."
"Overall: For the style, I actually enjoyed this one. It tastes more like a pilsner than an adjunct beer. I could have several on a hot day. It has a very clean taste to it. If I were not grading to style though, I suspect this would be about a 3.25"
"Overall a decent beer. It serves it's purpose as a light beer but there's not a lot going on with this one. Could use a little more taste on the back end as well."
"Overall: Yeah, yeah, refreshing and all, but it's subdued and subtle to a fault, never really satisfying."
"Overall: Overall, one of the better APLs I've had. I'd definitely take this over a macrobrew any day, that's for sure."
"Overall impression: Looks, and smells, can be deceiving. This one was pretty enjoyable, actually. Not a bad choice at all for a fizzy yellow beer."
"Pours a pale golden body with a 1 finger head which dwindles to a very small trace of bubbles sitting on the body. Not too much in the nose, pretty much just generic beer smell. Taste is alright with a light corn/malty flavor and very loght hop finish. Not too much special about this beer. Refreshing, but just beer."
"Summary: This is an average beer. I gave it 7.1/10, or C-. I haven't tasted very many different beers, but this one has a unique taste I haven't experienced before. I can taste hops topped with sweet malts, but there's some flavors I can't identify here. It looks, tastes, and feels like a pale lager. To be quite honest I'm a little disappointed in Shiner's most prized beer...I was just expecting more. This is not a beer I would drink often, but not one I would turn away either."
"This is an middle of the road beer. Beings as it lacks real flavor I would not keep it on hand or buy it again for that fact for myself. However the beer coming from Spoetzl is cheaper than some crafts and quite a bit better than macros. In having to bring beer to a BBQ this would be a good choice, and considering some of MY friends don't drink craft and would likely bring a BMC. Being 4.4%, and smooth this beer is a great sessioner for such get-togethers. Good beer Spoetzl Brewery."
"Pass."
"Notes: What you would expect from an average pale lager. Nothing exciting and dominated by cooked vegetable and corn flavor."
"Pours a very pale yellowish color with the scent of grassy grains. Has a very nice blend of different grains and wheats in its taste. Finishes with a nice smooth taste and a light feel. Not to much craft in it, but if you are a Miller/Bud drinker during the summer, give this a try instead."
"Thanks to woodychandler for this beer. Poured from a 12 oz. can. Has a pale yellow color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is somewhat sweet, some malts. Taste is crisp, a tad mild, some malts and sweetness. Feels light in the mouth and is very drinkable. Overall this is a pretty good beer."
"Overall: B-"
"This is a dainty, airy beer. I'd almost call it a beer for those looking for a beer without all that beer taste to it. I'd call it a session beer, but frankly, it is too light for that. Not saying it is bad, just that it is insubstantial."
"12 ounce bottle, one of the 6 brews in Shiner's Family Reunion 6-pack. Served in a pilsener glass, the beer pours a clear pale gold color with a half inch white head. Head retention and lacing are both average. Aroma is sweet malt, grain and corn. The aroma isn't bad at all. Taste is just like the aroma, but the with sweet malt being the strongest thing that I can taste. There's also a bit of a grainy finish. Like the aroma, it doesn't taste bad. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, it's a bit slick with good carbonation. Drinkability is good, it wouldn't be hard to drink quite a few of these. It's not a beer I would make a point to seek out, but if someone gave me a bottle I wouldn't turn it down, either."
"D - A pretty generic blonde ale, not bad but not particularly good either. Not much else to say about this one."
"Overall, much like the Light, but lighter. Not much here to talk about."
"a local, though more expensive version of the big crap beers. my girlfriend suggested that it tastes like a better-quality BMC. i have to agree because i can actually taste a little bit of hops in this beer."
"Very drinkable. Taste more like an Adjunct Lager than American Pale Lager (all-malt)."
"Notes: This seems to be a very average beer all-around. It is clean and simple."
"what you would expect from a good blonde ale. i prefer blonde bombshell over this one for a blonde ale, but this is very drinkable. I certainly wouldn't turn it down. It's a little lacking in aroma but overall taste and drinkability make up for it."
"The beer pours a light yellow color with a white head. The aroma is very subtle. I may get a little grain, but the beer hardly has any aroma at all. The flavor is grain, wheat, grass and corn. Nothing too special and really not too appetizing. Medium carbonation and a light mouthfeel. Not one of the better beers from Shiner."
"D: Just enough flavor for a light refreshing treat on a hot summer day."
"The mouth is crisp and little too bubbly. Could stand to smooth out a bit. As far as flavor goes, this is decent. Some nice crisp citrus, slight corn/grains, finishes creamy and sweet. Not bad at all. It accomplished what I wanted it to: refreshing and it hit the spot. This is far better than the macro lagers out there. Decent crossover beer for the inquisitive."
"Drinkability - Not too strong of an after taste, easy to come back to, but probably not worth favoriting."
"D- Eh. mediocre at best. Not something I'd seek out, but would make a good beer pong beer or something for a baseball game. Other than that, bland and boring. And not very ""blonde"" like at all."
"The warmer it got the more it tasted like a run of the mill mass produced light beer. Personally I will never bother with this one as it has nothing to offer me. Shiner TX can keep it."
"I sure hope the locals in Shiner, TX chill this beer really cold, because I can't imagine the horrors of a merely cool one on a hot day in south-central Texas."
"Ratings are per styel"
"D: Easily drinkable. Low ABV. Nothing wrong with the beer; pretty average for the style."
"Goes down easy, not overcarbonated, very drinkable. Nothing special here. Good beer though."
"I'm appreciating it more because it's over a hundred degrees out."
"Drinkability: Surprisingly I enjoyed this beer. Easy to sip on, with enough character to make me enjoy each sip. I have plenty of other beers that I'd prefer over this, but this was a bottle worth trying through a trade."
"D: Pretty drinkable.... Low ABC and the flavors are not too bad... Overall pretty average."
"Notes: Will not be buying this one again and not sure I'll be finishing it."
"drinkability - this is craft?? i call BS on that - for the same price of this 6pack i could have bought a 12 of stag which has 10x the flavor"
"drinkability> no fanks. Didn't even finish the first one"
"this is a total lawnmower beer and i bet would quench quite nicely in the summer heat. it also would wash down some spicy hot wings or jalapeno poppers pretty nicely."
"Drinkability: A nice, easy drinking, sessionable lager. I got a six pack and would do so again. Not a big ABV sipping beer, but it's not supposed to be. It's a good watching the game or sitting on the patio in the evening beer."
"Average lawnmower beer."
"This one isn't going to be for the craft lover. But at least it doesn't taste like an aluminum can, I guess."
"Better than a macro lager, but not by a whole lot."
"Mouthfeel was medium. Drinkability was excellent and perfect for lawnmoer mania."
"Poured out of a bottle into my pilsner glass (was out of regular pint glasses). It was part of a 6 brew/12 bottle variety pack from Shiner. Had a lot of tiny, rapidly forming bubbles that created a very thin layer on the top of the beer. Not a very strong taste, but also not an offensive taste. My non-beer drinking friends would probably drink this. Beer professionals would not be too impressed with the flavor. I could see myself drinking it as an afternoon beer with lunch since it is also rather light."
"D: Not too flavorful, goes down very easily and is not filling at all since there isn't much substance to it, very mild kick, not the best representation of style, it seems like one of those beers that is designed to be poundable but while it's light enough for that role, I didn't find it to have the kind of flavor I'd care for even in a lighter beer."
"M and D: Light and dry body. Makes this a good beer to consume quickly for gaming reasons if need be."
"D- I guess its an easy drinker if you like it. Not much here though. I was suprised since I like the other Shiner brews I've tried."
"D: It is what it is."
"D - not much to get excited about with this swill. will not purchase again."
"Bottle: Poured a golden blond color lager with a medium pure white foamy head with average retention and some lacing. Aroma of light sweet floral malt with light crisp hops notes. Taste is more enjoyable then I had expected with floral and dry notes well balanced. Body is about average with OK carbonation. Better then I had expected - nothing bad just a bit too subdued."
"Drinkability: Go elsewhere. While I could down a few of this in short order, there are cheaper beers out there that do the job just as well. If you're looking more for a tasty drink, go elsewhere too; there's very little of that here."
"Thanks Exiled!"
"Surprised how much I liked it considering that it is rather light in the taste department. But I like the beers from Shiner and this one is no exception."
"Crisp and refreshing with a nice medium-low carbonation. The mouthfeel, however...I'm not sure if it's unpleasant, or if it's somehow linked to the taste which makes it unpleasant. Either way I'm not liking it."
"D - I could tak or leave this honestly but it is true to the style and has many qualities I expect from a blonde-mainly refreshment and it is a quencher foremost"
"Sessioning - extremely. This is a lawnmower beer."
"Drinkability: It's not horrible, but it's not all that great. There's better beers within this style."
"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, beer looks like an American macro lager, being a clear golden-straw color with a fizzy white head and millions of bubbles rising to the top of the glass. The nose is pretty non-descript; a bit of grainy malt and weak, faded hops - slightly skunky. The taste reveals more of the skunkiness. Tastes like many generic pale euro lagers I've had, skunkiness and all. Grainy and one dimensional (two if you count the skunk), I have nothing positive to say about the taste. The mouthfeel is light in body with just a touch of tongue-burning carbonation. Overall, a beer that would be easy to drink if you wanted to but as the flavor stands I'm not sure why you would. Stick with Shiner Bock - a much better beer!"
"drinkability - i feel like the flavor comes in like two unbalanced notes. its not horrible, and this is not my style of choice but this is really just middle of the road. sessionable, but i doubt i would choose it."
"D: Drinkability is the strength of this beer. It can be enjoying in large amounts without hangovers. But don't. Drink two or three at a barbecue in Alpine or Marfa in may, or have a few during your stay in Big Bend National Park. This is a great Texas backyard beer."
"D: This is the high point of the beer. I would call this a lawnmower beer as this is more of a refreshing drink on a hot day than anything."
"Pours light yellow with no head. Aroma of pilsner malt, clove and a little fruity. Light bodied and crisp with pale flavors and light hops. Thinking that this was the same as Spoetzl's first brew from 1919 makes it a bit more interesting, but it's not much different from a macro lager. A good alternative to BMC."
"Drinkability: Overall not too impressive. It tastes pretty good, but isn't too great for much else. Is a good choice for outdoor Texas barbecue, though. I'd drink it again, although probably not regularly."
"Pours a clear, pale yellow color. One inch head of a white color. Decent retention and poor lacing. Smells of yeast, grain, and slight citrus. Fits the style of an American Pale Lager. Mouth feel is smooth and crisp with a high carbonation level. Tastes of yeast, grain, and a hint of citrus. Overall, not an exciting blonde at all - more of a regular lager. Nothing to go out of your way to get."
"Notes - The lack of carbonation combined with the light flavors is a little weird. I can see this being a summer beer in the Yukon. Mainly, though, I think this is a beer intended to appeal to people who don't drink beer. In fact, I've known people who disliked all beer but this one. I suppose it fills a useful market niche, but it's really not for the beer geek."
"Verdict: Blonde is certainly not the most complex or exciting beer in the Shiner lineup, but I don't think it was ever meant to be. This is pretty much Shiner's take on the American macro-style Lager, and the result is certainly a little more interesting than the offers from the big three. This works well as a gateway beer for the Bud/Miller/Coors set."
"D- Is drinkable. Great for sitting by the pool or enjoying outdoor activities."
"D. I did not care too much for this beer. Below average."
"Pours a crystal clear straw color with a thin line of bubbles for a head. Looks rather thin. A standard american lager smell, some sweet honey malt and hop. A sweet malt flavor and earthy hop finish. A slightly bitter finish from the hop. Not too bad. Mouthfeel is a little thin before the carbonation kicks in. Drinkability is ok."
"The flavor is extremely light and unsubstantial. A few hints of light malt are about the only things I can taste. It has less flavor than the Shiner Light. It is crisp, smooth and refreshing. Absolutely no off flavors are present, it's a well crafted beer...but the lack of body and flavor are disappointing."
"Very pale yellow. Thin white head that disappears real quick like, although it does leave some thin lace. Smells faintly of corn and grain. Very thin malt profile with a really crisp finish. The mouthfeel puts this above BMC, but it really doesn't taste like much. Fairly high carbonation. Actually as it warms there is a bit more maltiness to this than I thought. This would make one hell of a lawnmower beer, but there are cheaper lawnmower candidates out there."
"Especially during a hotter day, this beer is hard to beat for drinkability. It's perfectly quenching and easily sessionable. The lack of interest, though, doesn't really entice me to drink more."
"D- Not a beer I would buy again."
"D - Compared to the other blondes made in Texas this one is disappointing just below average ok on a hot day I guess but I'd rather have a Southern Star or Real Ale version of a blonde ale"
"Drinkability? It's not a bad drinker at all, despite my comments above. The abv is perfect for sessioning and it has enough flavour not to bore you to death. ;^)"
"I notice a lot of people selecting this brew, but I can't really understand why..it does nothing for me. The finish is starkly brisk and it doesn't taste like much. I was expecting much better. This is easily the worst beer in a case of Shiner family reunion- including the lights. I'd probably reach for an Old Milwaukee before this. It's not undrinkable though, but it damn sure isn't my favorite."
"D - When I drink pale yellow fizzy lager, I prefer Shiner Blonde."
"d- For what I would normally consider a ""Crappy"" beer its very drinkable. If I hold my nose I could down a few six packs."
"pours an insanely pale color, it looks like watered down lemonade, not even sure if i have seen a beer with this little color before, has no head either, pretty boring overall. smell is decent, has more of a belgian wit aroma to it than a lager, but it is pretty decent overall. taste is alot like the smell, closer to wit than a lager, but its pretty average. drinkability is the best part, its light and relatively refreshing, so having a few of these is no problem"
"Overall, a decent beer. For me, this is the classic beer for showing someone what is the next step up from the BMC's. Not bashing them but not much flavor in them. This one is mild enough to start someone on their journey to better beers. For me, it's a very rare change-up beer if I'm at a place with limited selection or if I'm having beer newbies over."
"Blah. After being somewhat surprised with Shiner Light, I thought this could be enjoyable. Nothing I will revisit when Shiner light is much better."
"Hmm...Shiner isn't hit or miss, it's hit all the time for me, but tasting this again is a little weird. I found a Shiner I wasn't crazy about..."
"This could be mixed in with a typical American macro lager, as it's on that level."
"Golden yellow, quite translucent. head pours big and foamy then is gone in seconds. some bubbles keep coming up from the bottle of the glass. if it weren't for them, i'd guess the beer was flat. smell is lemon. more cleaner-like than fresh lemon though. taste is humdrum with corn flavors that blend into a mild bitterness. some of that lemon is still there too. mouthfeel is quite lacking. very little carbonation, really thin. i think the macros have better mouthfeel. drinkability is not too good. i think i'll keep these in the fridge for friends."
"Atmosphere is, okay. Flavor is decent, yet subdued. Feel is pretty generic. All this makes for a light, but somewhat flavorful, drinkable brew. Decent quaff."
"Overall not as bad of a beer as I thought it would be. Definitely a little watery and bland, but not a terrible beer."
"Overall - A good example of an American lager. Nothing else."
"Mouthfeel/drinkability: I heard a lot of good things about Shiner but this beer falls well short of what I expected."
"Pours a light golden yellow color body, with virtually no head, white. Has a slightly skunky malty aroma. A very light skunky taste. Fizzy malty taste, fresh tasting, slightly dusty palate, not too complex of a flavor."
"Drinkability: Pretty bland and unexciting, but that is what this style is all about. Easy drinking and certainly wouldn't scare off any macro drinkers."
"Overall, like an American light beer in the worst way possible. No thanks."
"O- It's quite drinkable for its style. Not great not poor. It would be good if it had more body to it. Not Shiner's best product but is actually a good beer for a grill out and a good choice for an intro into craft beers."
"D. Nothing much is really here. I'd drink it at a party if it was the best of a poor selection, but I won't buy it."
"Knowing this breweries rep for poor looking brews I gave this one an aggressive pour out of the bottle. Still, very little head, no retention and no lacing. The liquid itself was a clear, bleached golden color. The nose was weak, pilsner-like malt and a mineral-like quality similar to what one gets out of canned beer. For an ""all-Malt"" Lager this was rather washed out, pale malts and some bread but no hops balance and not enough punch. The mouthfeel was ok however, the higher carbonation helped to fill in the thin body. Typical overall for a macro lager but their original bock beer is better."
"Watery, that just about explains this beer, if it weren't so watered down it might be ok, but definately not a good showing from Spoetzl."
"Drinkability is moderate. Flavor isn't too great, but it's not repulsive either. There are plenty of other lagers that I would much prefer before this one though."
"D- Drinks down quick and easy for when you wanna drink something light that isn't offensive"
"D - This could have passed for Coors in a blind taste test. Very bland and boring stuff really."
"Pours the palest of pale yellows with a thin finger of head that hangs for all of five second before leaving no lacing.This has some skunky aromas along with some mild grassy notes.The taste is even more bland than the nose.It taste of wimpy malts and some wierd mineral flavors(like licking a dry rock),some hoppy bitterness on the tail,but not enough to get excited about.The body is thin and is ok for a blonde,but then there is this overpowering wave of carbonation that is borderline offensive,very dry finish that does'nt suit this very well.On to somthing better I hope."
"Poured a dark golden color into a glass. Minimal head to the beer. Smell was weak, in other words, nothing jumped out at me. As for the taste, also rather bland. Sort of a corn taste to it. Mouthfeel was not bad but not much of anything. As I have stated before Shiner Beers are Mass craft/micro. Above average verus Bud light but noth against much else."
"Slightly sweet corn smell. Well carbonated, slight corn taste up front, quickly dissipating. Muted simple taste overall, and not very bitter at all. Nothing too pronounced, and a short finish. Overall, I thought this was decent for the style, but nothing to go out of the way for."
"a try, but wait for a sale."
"Pretty good beer for what it is."
"Poured this out of the bottle into a glass, the color was a blonde color as the bottle refers. The smell was a bit hoppy but sweet. While the taste is a little bit more robust than say your average macro. It is a quality beer. I would be able to enjoy this one year round. I would commend shiner for once agian hitting the nail on the head with their beer."
"I like pilsner style beers so this one appealed to me. Lighter in color and taste than say a Pilsner Urquell. Thin head with a whiff of hop aroma. Slight bitterness at the end. Much better than the usual run of the mill massed produced lagers from the US. I like Shiner beers and I like this one."
"Overall: Not too bad. I know this is mean, but honestly, it is quite similar to a regular Bud. I feel like they don't quite cut the corners as bad as AB, but they are shooting for the same basic end product."
"12 ounce bottle, no freshness info offered. Pours lightest of golden amber, clear, almost white head, leaving a thick ring of foam, just a slight wiff of a stale nose. This is a thin and fairly tasteless ofering. Lawn mower beer...stay away if you like flavor and have any interest in quality/tasteful beer"
"Not really a Pilsener guy, so maybe I am prejudiced, but I found nothing special in this brew. Nothing out of the ordinary or memorable. If you want a good Shiner beer, try the Bohemian Black Lager (schwarzbier). Decent head, dissipated quickly. Standard fare pilsener taste, not their best effort."
"A good choice if you want a pale American lager but don't want the BMC."
"Pours a typical clear bright yellow with a nice thick head. Aroma is malty and of average strength. Flavor is malty and on the thin side, no complexity. It feels a little watery, rather like a ""light"" beer. It is nice and smooth but not particularly delightful to drink."
"Not really sure what to say about this one. Got it at a barbecue after having a very tasty Anchor Liberty Ale. Almost an incredibly average beer (oxymoron?). Color is golden macro-lager color with a minor head that dissolves very quickly. Nose is mild, mostly grain and malt. Taste is likewise unexceptional. Feel is a little thin bodied. I dunno. It's one I would (and did) drink at any barbecue, but not if something else is available. It's also (so I hear) insanely cheap here, which gives it a couple points in my book."
"D: Good drinkability. This would be a good choice if you don't want to stop and reflect on the beer you're drinking, you just want to put a cold one back. Speaking of which, I recommend this one straight from the fridge (40-45°F). Cheers!"
"D - It is an okay beer. It just lacks in flavor compared to other All-Malt lagers."
"Jon"
"Drinks really easy, but kind of tasteless. A step up from BMC though"
"Poured from a 12oz. bottle, into a pint glass. The beer pours a light clear straw, forming a thin 1 inch head, with light lacing. The aroma is slightly skunky, with some light sweet malt. The taste is a slight hop presence, a little malt, and alot of grain flavor. Light mouthfeel. Overall, not a bad beer. This reminds me alot of St. Pauli Girl, but without the overpowering skunkiness. But, in the end, its just okay."
"Pours a crystal clear darker straw yellow with a frothy white head that fades quickly. The smell is subtle and inviting, the doughy yeast characters came out first with the head, as it fades it leaves a grainy and malty smell with some sweet notes. The taste is the same, very subtle, crisp and clean. Better than your average macro, but not by too much. Easy drinker, nice mouthfeel, good with just about anything. A beer for all people, not offensive, but nothing spectacular. This one is good when you just want a nice American lager. Enjoy."
"Shiner Blonde is a beer that offers a few good points as well as a few negative points, almost equally balanced between the two. Its dominate flavors of yeast, sweet malted barley, corn, and cereal grains and the crisp finish remind me of many other standard beer products. Its one of those take it or leave it type of beers: One that wont offend and that most will find acceptable, but not one that stands out in any positive way."
"Shiner Blonde is a standard golden lager with a short-lived white head (it does leave some nice lace at the outset), and a sulphury lager aroma. It's crisp in the mouth with a medium body. The flavor delivers a subtly sweet, straightforward, and mildly grainy malt that's lightly infused with a non-descript hop flavor (mostly floral and a touch spicy, but muddled) and backed by a firm bitterness. It's well-made, readily accessible, and fairly drinkable with the exception that it lacks enough complexity to compel you to have another."
"D - Not awful, but not worth it with so many gret beers out there. I don't think I will have this again. Pretty easy to drink. Sessionable as well."
"Not much too this beer, just a light fizzy beer that probably goes well in the summer with a BBQ. Serve cold."
"Pours light golden with a three finger head of white soap bubbles. Excellent clarity, decent retention and nice spotty lacing. Extra pale malt in the nose, with some mild hops, mabye cluster? Overall clean aroma. Pale malt sweetness upfront, clean lager flavor, with a hint of kolsch yeast character. Semi-drying aftertaste, again, a low alpha hop flavor and meak bitterness. The timid flavors do balance, and it is very pleasent on the tounge, Light in body, with an effervescent carbonation. Finshes soft, with just a touch of alt/kolsch yeast and pale malt. A superb hot-weather quencher, too bad it's released so late in the year."
"If I lived in TX, could get this cheaply rather than $6 a six, and I didn't have access to Yuengling beers, I could see this becoming a go-to beer. Otherwise, average as they come."
"Opinion: This beer is OK, but there really isn't all that much to set it apart from anything. You could call this a macro brew as easily as you could a very neutral craft beer. I don't know...this beer is just OK. It isn't metallic and gross like you often get with this type of beer, so they didn't screw up...it is just very bland corny and neutral."
"This is an average beer. Like the big three. Maybe a little better. I prefer high life to this if I want a no frills macro. It's just average. The only think I don't like is the mouthfeel. It needs to be more crisp. It's just not the crispness I expect from an american lager."
"Fairly drinkable, but who would want more than one. I suppose if this is the only beer available, I'd have another in a pinch."
"This beer poured a crystal clear straw color with a persistent head. It had a slightly malty, sweet smell. The taste was mild and balanced. The mouthfeel was thin with noticeable carbonation with a clean and crisp aftertaste. This is a very drinkable beer a hot day."
"Pours golden color with fizzy white head. Aroma is malt, corn and some faint hops. Taste is malt, corn and some bitterness in the finish. Mouthfeel is light bodied and dry with a bite from the carbonation. This beer is what it is, but its not a bad beer for a hot day. This is probably my favorite of the non seasonal beers from Shiner."
"Pale yellow-gold color with a fizzy thin white head that disspates quickly. Lacing is pretty much nonexistent. Light aroma of straw and corn. Light-bodied with vaugue grassy hops, malt and corn flavors. The finish is effervescent and lightly bitter. Although it is not a bad beer, it is kind of a wet blanket all around."
"Bottom line: not bad; not great; Shiner Bock or Kolsch are better."
"Looks the way its supposed to - golden. No real head retention. Doesnt smell so great. Kinda like wet cardboard, or a wet dog or something. Flavor is a quick burst upon your tongue, and then dissapates. I prefer Shiner Kolsch over this. Not the worst Shiner there is (Bock gets that honor) but I prefer most of the other Shiners over this one. That all being said, I think this beer will go well with the dinner I'm about to eat (lasagna)."
"Overall i think this one is a better beer than their bock. simply has more flavor, but has a little bit more of a raw taste."
"Slightly oranged gold with a fizzy white head that disappears almost immediately. Nose is consequently difficult to discern -- sour and sickly sweet for the most part. Yeasty ""beer"" smell. The flavor is not much to speak of either, primarily a tame malt presence that is not-quite-but-almost-cloyingly sweet. Some slight hop spice. Just off bitter finish. Thin mouthfeel, not watery but completely unimpressive. Would be easier to drink if it had more flavor. Makes me wish for some Brooklyn Lager."
"A light and drinkable beer. I'm not going to be pretentious about any tasting experience of any brew....so i must say that if you switched my glass of blonde with a glass of budweiser I wouldnt notice a huge disparity. Macro in a prettier bottle, nothing wrong with that, though."
"Pours clear golden in color with a delicate white head. Somewhat spicey aroma of malt and hops. Thinnish, carbonated mouthfeel. Borders on watery. Taste is fairly clean and uninspiring. Reminds me a lot of your typical American macro lager. Grainy, with a touch of sweetness. Hops are present but very light. This beer is too meek to be offensive, yet too lacking in flavor to be recommended."
"Appearance has a clear golden yellow hue with a bright white two finger sized head leaves behind streaks of lace. Aroma contains corn and rice tones with light two row malted grains leaves behind a weak hop aroma very grassy in origin. Flavor has a creamy sweet corn and rice texture with light pockets of hops that have grassy components to it, very nice light beer. Mouthfeel is light bodied with overly carbonated profile. Drinkability is less than complex when it comes to overall drinkability very simplisitc in nature I will pass next time."
"I like this beer and will buy more."
"D- non-filling, light with some solid flavor. Went well with the pizza i was eating. Simple beer. Im not going to seek it out. But a good beer to give your buddies to get them off the macros."
"Although this beer describes it self as a Bohemian style golden lager, Pilsener Urquell it aint. The recipe has likely changed over what the Bohemian and German founders of the Spoetzel Brewery would have intended, therefore the BA description of light all malt American lager is certainly more fitting and what one should expect from this beer. Altogether, Shiner Blonde is a quite drinkable and enjoyable beer perhaps more so directly from the bottle."
"I've hjad avergae experience with Shiner so far but since I am in Texas on vaaction and it's in the fridge here, why not? Actually much better than all-malt beverages that I can thik of? Nothing too exciting, but this could be session brew down here. Pretty light and quite easy to consume. My wife enjoyed it as well, which always is nice to know."
"If I was sweaty & thirsty, I'd grab one or take one. If given choices, I would definitely choose something else. Guess everything isn't bigger & better in Texas afterall."
"It is best served cold and paired with BBQ, preferably a combination plate featuring brisket and hot links. Onions & Jalapeños optional."
"Pours out a pale straw color with a slight head. Aroma is quite faint, just a touch of sweet malt. Light malt flavor with only a slight presense of hops. Finishes very clean and dry. Light bodied, with a neutral texture. Not unpleasant, but there's nothing special here."
"Decently drinkable light bodied, but with an odd aftertaste I can't identify."
"Not a horrible horrible beer overall, but it's not something I see myself purchasing much of in the future."
"Not so good, Al."
"Drinkability - I've had beers that were very unsophisticated (like me) that were well balanced or refreshingly light and remarkably drinkable,but this one missed on all marks."
"Not able to bring my self to imbibe the AB macros I opted for a Shiner Blonde. and settled in to listen to ""Mitch's Song"" The music and dancehall did not let me down. I guess 2 out of 3 ain't bad."
"this beer does go down like water which at least makes it drinkable. i won't buy it again unless it's on sale for really cheap. i could drink it again but there are better beers all over the place."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable & refreshing beer. Goes down like water. Nothing offensive, but no complexity either. Would be a good summer brew in it's home state of Texas, I would imagine."
"Crystal clear gold in color, big white head fades with pretty good retention. Smells grainy and grassy, lots o malt, no hops. Taste is very mellow and uncomplicated. Stradling the fence between euro lager and american macro, this beer is nothing special. Good for a back-up beer, but that's about it."
"Crystal clear gold color with a fluffy white head that fell not long after pouring. The smell is of grains and some hops. The taste crisp but not very note worthy. The mouthfeel was very smooth and nicely carbonated. This was a very easy drinking beer. It did not leave a strange taste in your mouth like some of the lighter beers do. Overall, I would say its not too bad. This would be a good beer to help expose people to better, higher quality beer."
"I had this one on-tap, over dinner, during a recent business trip to Texas. Apperance: a pale, yellow, fizzy liquid with a pretty, but slight head. The aroma is grainy with a faint hoppiness. Its a very carbonated beer, that gives seriously fizzy, carbonic sensation. With virtually no malt flavor, and a restrained, but crisp, hop finish, this ones a close relative of most macros. Id avoid it if I saw it again."
" Your basic pale lagar here, for $4.23 a sixer it's fresh and competively priced with the BMC crowd."
"12oz. bottle poured into a tulip-style glass. It pours a light gold color with two fingers of head. There is a good amount of lacing. The smell is slightly fruity, maybe a bit tart. Plenty to smell but kinda weird. The taste is a little bland. It has some malty flavors coming through, but just not much else going on. A little one dimensional. The mouthfeel is pretty light. The drinkability is good though. Just decent."
"Nothing wrong with this lager, great ""lawnmowin'"" brew, just doesn't offer anything I can use...though if there was nothing else available in some certain situation, I'd endure it."
"This is the weakest of the Shiner beers that I've had (still haven't had their Light or Winter), but Blond is still a decent brew. Appearance is pale golden with short head. Aroma is clean, but run-of-the-mill, basically a higher end macro smell. Blond tastes solid, but unremarkable. No off-tastes are present. The taste is nicely balanced, but fairly boring. This beer works well in that it won't offend BA members and will also work for people who are used to macros. I could easily knock back quite a few of these without getting tired of it."
"A decent beer. Doesn't have quite enough flavor or character for me to have it too often, but I imagine it would be a good hot summerday beer."
"Drinkability - I'll drink what I have left but won't be picking any more of this up on future trips south."
"I don't really have much that's good to say about Shiner Blonde so I think I'll stop right here. Thumbs down."
"Grabbed this for the hot day in the sun. Poured a straw yellow with a slight head that is decent. Smell is grainy with light hints of hops. Taste is very refreshing, kick of grilled corn on the forefront with a little hop twang that flow great with this light lager. Ligh bodied but smooth, a very drinkable beer on those hot sweaty day, slightly better than the american macros."
"Bought this for a cookout I went to yesterday because it was pretty darn hot and wanted something on the lighter side,pours a light blond color with a thin wispy head that is gone fast and leaves no trace.Aromas of corn husk and a light grassiness but not much there at all,taste like aroma to me was dominated by corn with a light herbal not.Decent when cold and goes down real easy but this could pass as something from the big 3 for sure."
"Pours a very pale yellow, smell is OK, but not distinctive--kind of grainy, light. Taste leaves a bit to be desired, it was a nice departure from macro ""water", but not by much. I could drink a lot of these and not feel overwhelmed with the weight. Same goes for Bud Light, but that does not make a good beer."
"Quite possibly the lightest clear yellow I've seen in a long while, nearly lighter the lemonade, but it grows a fairly decent white crown and has some steady carbonation within. Some stringy globs of lace stick. Aroma is starchy and plain with an off-sweetness of corn husk and dulled grasses, maintains a slight crispness, but comes across way too starchy for my liking Although, that resides as it warms. The taste is about what you'd expect, a bit sweet, not as starchy as the smell but its there, dulled hops, crisp sweet malts, lingering husk grain thats a bit raw and the kind of bittering that I just don't like where its kinda metalic and twingey with a sharp hard water tone. Some of that fades though as it warms. The feel is actually pretty darn good considering. Nice crispness in the middle. One of the better, more full pale lagers I've come across. If it weren't for the finish of off bittering it would be perfect I think. But that said its still a bit on the boring side, the sweetness isn't to bad once it warms up a bit in both the smell and flavor. As cold this seemed really off and kinda nasty, but as it warmed I really grew to liking it, so I tweeked the numbers to reflect the warmer side of things."
"And the girlie on the bottle label isn't so bad. :)"
"Its drinkable Ok..but i suppose you need it to be 98 degrees for the real worth of this beer to come into play."
"Sinkability  This Blonde gave me a black eye."
"This tastes just like most American lagers. Grainy, not very complex, not the best nose, watery tasting. This one might be a little below some of the better examples, but they all taste pretty much the same. I don't know how the American public has fallen into this as being the preferred style."
"Get you a nice warm, sunny day and grab one of these if you can...."
"More pale than golden. Too light. Almost the color of apple juice. Slightly lighter than piss yellow. A small white head is erected as quickly as it is deflated. A collar remains and laces sporadically. Soft bohemian maltiness. Herbal hop accents. Some underlying caramel character. Nice smelling lager. The body is light and lifeless. The flavor lacks depth. Malt character is ghostly. Hops barely make an appearance. And the only other characteristic I take from this one is a formidable dry aspect. Other than the aroma, this one is not that pleasurable."
"Props for the woman on the bottle--that's worth at least 0.5 points on appearance."
"I guess I'm not a true beer snob after all. I like this brew. It looks good. It has decent head retention and nice color. It smells sweet and inviting. It tastes tangy and sweet with a touch of hop flavor and aroma. Finishes clean and refreshes. For what it is, a light-flavored session beer, it hits the spot."
"I sought this beer while on vacation in Oklahoma. I found this and the bock only, in the Shiner line, and found I enjoyed the Blonde the most. As with the other reviews, it poured a clear straw/gold color. The head was a nice two inch, medium carbonation no fizz, white. The aroma was of sweet grain. The taste was also a sweeter grainy malt with little hop but a slight bitter finish. What sold me on this blonde was the creamy feel I noticed on the mouth. A very smooth, drinkable brew. When given the chance, i'll pick up somemore. It makes a good summer gold beer."
"This beer works hard to stay within the limits defined by the typical American macro lager - and does nothing to distinguish itself. Sweet, grainy malt does all the talking. Hops barely make a peep, which is not uncharacteristic for the style. Turns a touch tart at the end, with a noteworthy astringency at the finish that helps clean up the palate and adds a touch of interest to the beer. This brew is solidly entrenched in the lawnmower lineup."
"The beer is a translucent straw or gold color if you prefer with a modest head and a frothy texture, the color a bright white and the remaining lace a thin curtain to cover the glass. Nose is clean and fresh malt dominated and slightly sweet with the front sweet, the top cadaverous. The finish is benign in its acidic bite; the hops are purposeful and a touch spicy, dry as a bleached desert bone aftertaste. Shiner beers are drinkable, great No, but they do make fine lawn mower beer, so whats wrong with that? Nothing in my books, and better than many beers Ive drank."
"Pours a light pale golden color with a thin white head that quickly dissipates. Almost no aroma at allperhaps a faint hop bitterness. Flavor is of light hops and grains and is quite crisp. A definite step up from the macros and would be nice on a hot day."
"Pale gold with a big head that disappears very quickly and is macro foam-like in character.  Sense of some candy corn to the aroma along with decent hop.  The flavor is seriously macro-like to my tongue, quite a bit of corn syrup with a leaning toward overcarbonation and the same brief hop cut of a Bud.  Ranks close to other regional Lagers like Grain Belt, Rolling Rock, etc...i.e. -- worthy of support from locals."
"Good drinkable pale lager.  Better taste than your average Bud product.  Light color, average flavor, but better than most.  One step up.  Not the best, better than bad.  Substitute this one for the others if you're on the  fence."
"Pours a very pale yellow with a a 1 1/2 finger white head that dissipates very rapidly.  The smell is that of sweet corn and not much else.  Reminds me of a beer that is slightly more dry than an American macro.  Not much in the flavor department.  Just a clean crisp light bodied beer with no character.  Not much going on here.  Cheers nonetheless!"
"It is ""Distinctly Shiner"" though!"
"Medium golden color with a nice white cloudtop head, lots of carbonation, slight lace.  Aroma of cooked grains and some hops, not much else.  Fairly smooth taste, begins with understated malts which soon fade as the hops begin to assert themselves, finishes crisp, dry and a touch bitter.  Overall, a fairly insubstantial beer, but easy to drink, and with nothing to offend.  A decent hot weather beer, goes well with barbeque or southwestern cuisine."
"Straw hue w/ a moderate head that sticks.  Typical grainy notes in aroma, but an unexpected mild Saaz hop spiciness is present. A bit more character than the typical American lager.  Thin mouthfeel and weak body...  It's quite dry and very attenuated probably from the adjuncts.  There's very little malt flavor, and nothing memorable in flavor all around.  Hop bitterness is paltry.  Finishes bland, dry, and clean. It's a brew to quaff and forget about.  Only slightly better than the typical macrobrew. I'd rather drink this than soda, however."
"Notes: On par with the big three (Bud, Miller, Coors) if not a tad better, that is a hard thing to do being that beers this small have to be flawless regardless if they have little flavour or not. On a hot sweaty day this would be a perfect ice cold beer to grab."
