Taste is much the same with grain, fruit, and grassy flavors on the finish. There is a very mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel.

The color and nose were nothing special, inoffensive at best, boring at worst. Mouthfeel was what you would expect; heavy carbonation and thin without being watery. Not a bad beer by any means and much better than Taj Mahal brand lager, but not something would willingly drink again, as pedestrian light lagers aren't my thing.","Aaron_Ramson","Jan 07, 2013"

Aroma is sweeter and more fragrant than expected from an adjunct lager. Carbonation is beautiful, thick two inches of pure white head and continual fine streams of bubbles throughout the beer.

In fact, the body is akin to seltzer water, and the taste isn't far from that, either. I detected a bit of lemon and hay, plus some green vegetables in both the taste and the aroma.

Overly aired head that fades quickly. Nose is OK with hints of grain and grass, some hops. Nothing offensive, nothing attractive, average. Taste is not good at all, really poor IMO. It has some wheat undertones that give way to spice which is not what I'd expect. The hoppiness that I did experience felt like it was coming from a jar, really strange kick to it. The carbonation really hurt any attempt at having it with the food being served as it amplified all the tastes and aromas while simultaneously contaminating them.","packetknife","Sep 06, 2005"
3.25,9.1,2.5,2.5,3.5,3,4,"I went to pick up my Indian carry-out order a few minutes early so I could belly up to the bar and drain one. I initially picked Taj Mahal, but at the last minute changed my mind to this one. I don't think I've had it before, and in comparison I was getting an extra 0.3% ABV (bang for my buck!). It's to the point now where any new lager I try is expected to be fairly boring, but I'm always hoping for some unique characteristic to shine through. With Flying Horse, there is a noticable hint of sweet corn. The morning-urine yellow appearance reinforces this trait, which is normally a reminder that I'm drinking cheaply produced swill. It reminds me a lot of Red Stripe which I think also imparts this same sweet grain flavor, but Flying Horse is more extreme in this regard. Did I just use the word "extreme" in a lager review? Well, not extreme, but very noticable when put up against any other standard import lager from Europe or elsewhere. I rather enjoyed this beer, though in the "Macro Lager" catagory it doesn't take a whole lot to impress.","Gruntlumber","Aug 14, 2005"

Taj Mahal is not a great beer, but paired with Indian food I find it tasty and satisfying. This was neither. Pale, tasteless and the faint smell of straw was all this beer could muster. They can't all be 5's...or 4's for that matter. Maybe the Kingfisher will be better, I'll try that next time.","fdrich29","Feb 15, 2005"
3.22,8.1,3,3.5,3,3,3.5,"Pretty well-charged, a big fizzy head of an inch on a slow pour. Vanishes quickly though. Medium gold and clear appearance. Little lace, mostly dots on the glass. Straw aroma, quite a bit of green apple skin. Some honey to the malt, but very fruity flavor, tart and with more decided apple tones, approaching fermented cider mid mouth. Light body, medium carbonation. Hands off to a crisp hoppiness near the close but with tangy notes remaining. Has a little character, not a favorite of mine, but makes more of an impression than other United Breweries Lagers like Taj Mahal.","ADR","Oct 01, 2004"

3.46,16.1,4,3,3.5,4,3.5,"Flying Horse pours an absolutely crystal-clear, deep-golden body that teems with swirling clouds of tiny, effervescent bubbles beneath a long-lasting head of frothy bright-white foam that holds quite well and leaves some nice lacing about the glass. The aroma offers a soft, grainy maltiness and a mildly herbal and grassy hoppiness that's very European. The body is medium with a fine-bubbled carbonation that's crisp on the tongue before allowing it to smoothly fade away. The flavor delivers a unusual maltiness that's a touch sweetish and grainy with an odd, nuttiness to it (as if some wheat was included in the grain bill). The grassy, herbal, and delicately spicy hop flavors are perfectly balanced against the malt and backed by a solid bitterness that could be a bit sharper but still gets the job done. (It's less bitter than most German pilseners, but there's definitely something going on). It finishes dry with a lingering maltiness that's bumped by a swirl of hops and then residual bitterness. It's an impressive lager considering that it's coming out of India (a country not known for it's beer!). And interestingly, this "pils" has a softness and lingering quality to it that works really well with Indian foods. It pairs exceptionally well with the creaminess, delicate spiciness, subtle raisin fruitiness, and cashew nuttiness of Navratan Korma. More of a "food beer" than a Friday night quaffer, but still pretty good regardless.","NeroFiddled","Jul 03, 2004"

3.15,5.7,3,3,3,3.5,3.5,"Perfectly clear and golden straw in color. Topped with frothy white head that quickly dies out and leaves little lace. Sweet grains dominate the rather nondescript nose--not unpleasant but lacking depth and daring. The same is true of the taste, which is dominated by the almost syrupy malts that far overshadow the hops, though there's a pleasant bit of crispness at the outset. The mouthfeel is reasonably well-balanced, and this beer is surely quite drinkable. But I'm bound to reach for something that promises more character.","BitteBier","Jan 05, 2004"
3.38,13.4,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"The taste is fairly subtle, but decent. Like most Indian beers I've had the taste is not all that broad. However, elements such as the slight woodiness and sweetness round out the taste enough to bring it up one notch above average. It has a lovely way of bringing out a kind of pepperiness in the Indian food, but aside from that pairing I doubt I'd seek out this beer.","Weissenheimer","Dec 29, 2003"
2.59,-13.1,4,2.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,"This came in a big 22oz bottle with a little note attached - very impressive and made me expect a good, quality beer. To the review: Pours a boring yellow/golden color with little head and leaves no lacing. The aroma is a bit skunky and yeasty with a bread-like appeal. The flavor is a little sweet, but still has a slight bit of skunkiness to it. Clean taste. Mostly malt in the flavor - very average for a lager. Not hard to drink, but not wonderful either. Nothing special here.","clvand0","Dec 02, 2003"
2.48,-16.8,3,2.5,2,3,3,"Light gold color, small white foamy head. Aroma is grainy and sweet. A malt liquor/lager. Light malt taste, with a very definite alcohol tang. Good malt/hop balance.

2.43,-18.5,2.5,2,2.5,2,3,"With a little note tied to the bottle and a brewed on date, I sort of anticipated something special, but alas a Flying Horse relieves itself the same as a field horse. Straw/Gold in color with a thin to medium corn malt body. A cornhusk and cardboard-like aroma leaves something to be desired...hops. The white head disappeared before I could fully examine it. The hops appear to be an afterthought. That said, this mildly sweet and dry beer is still quite drinkable","BeerResearcher","Apr 01, 2003"

Bready, yesty flavors come through with a clean finish. Not overly sweet, but still a touch of sweetness. Though it's not a beer I would activrly seek out, it went well with Indian food and had a nice palate cleansing effect. Not a bad lager, but nothing special either.","LarryV","Mar 15, 2003"

3,0.7,3,3,3,3,3,"The prototypical lager pour, a translucent gold color, the head impressive, the color bright white and the texture frothy. As it evanesces the lace left behind is a fine covering sheet upon the glass. Quintessential lager nose, all malt, somewhat sweet, with the start also mostly malt and lightly sweet, the top thin and unimpressive, the finish lightly hopped, mild on the carbonation, the aftertaste dry and lingering. Another Average" lager, drinkable, but nothing that would make me buy it again.","Gusler","Feb 05, 2003"
