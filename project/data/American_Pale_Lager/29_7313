While I wouldn't run out and buy a pack of it at the store or anything, Michelob's not a bad choice at all if you're in the mood for a beer or two but you're at a restaurant that doesn't have anything really amazing on the menu, especially if the imports (and even Yuengling!) are priced a dollar or more higher.","Pantalones","Feb 12, 2015"

Haven't had a Michelob for years and to my surprise it had a nice smooth malty taste, much fuller than I expected with just the right amount of hops. I was in complete disbelief that a domestic beer could taste this good. I generally have to pay 9.99-10.99 a six pack for the really tasty stuff but this is a nice brew to pack your fridge with if you like to pound down a six pack or two during a football game with the boys.

The smell is rich with grains and malts. Michelob is brewed with finest grains and malts. This brew is full of flavor,  there is nothing over powering in this brew. Michelob has a nice balance to it. It dose not get any better than original Michelob. I would Take this over any other beer out there on the market. Michelob is a Great Beer for the Price.

Lacing is not left on the glass as the head dissipates. Only a small amount of lacing is left on the surface fo the beer. Some lacing is left on the side of the glass during consumption. There are aromas of hops and pale malts. It smells bready, sweet, and clean. The taste follows the nose. There's a malty sweetness as well as some hops on the back end. It's clean tasting and bready. The body is light with adequate carbonation. The finish is crisp and dry. The drinkability is high. Overall, this is an excellent lager.

I just think the kind of raspy, spicy hops are a bit much. I'd prefer them to be a bit more floral, but that's just me. And I can't fault it anywhere, really. It looks great, nice and clear and golden; and the frothy bright white head holds pretty well and leaves some decent lacing on the glass. I get some nice malt and hops out of the nose, and the same follow in the flavor. It's a Munich-style helles, and a pretty good one at that. I'll agree that it's maybe a bit fuller than some of the softer, sweeter versions out there now, but that doesn't mean that that's the style.

However the weak malts come across a bit raw with a touch of cola and bread dough character. Hops may balance the sweetness, but don't offer much in the way of bitterness, flavor or aroma.

The flavors were also fairly weak in nature. I tasted some light malt, and grains that was it. No hops detected even though it states that they were imported. No aftertaste. This beer is crisp and light, it managed to quench my thirst, and that was all I was looking for at the moment. Over all impression, OK, I guess.

Aroma is a bit caustic, grainy but not much else. Flavour rips a grainy strip across the tongue, leaving an unwelcome aftertaste in its wake. Corn adjuncts abound.

Aromatics well has some detectable hops going on here just a touch with the corn and rice adjuncts also coming through with sweetness overall unoffensive to passive for me. Flavor consists of a sharp sweet adjunct ridden tone with the hop bitterness coming in to create a mediocre American light lager that should be the flagship beer of Anheuser Busch when compared to Budweiser. Not bad for AB but let's just say in the realm of lagers this is on the bottom of the pile but it's available everywhere and more drinkable then most macro products.
