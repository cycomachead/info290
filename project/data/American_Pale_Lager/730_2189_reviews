"This is a lightweight lager. Not a good example of a Pilsner. The hops were just too low."
"Visited the brewery a while back. Thought this was a very solid beer."
""
""

"By far the best Canadian brewed Pilsner I've tried."

"Good fresh beer."

"If you like DMS, grab a bottle of this for its buttery taste."

"Poured from a can on a Porter flight. Big, strong, dry biscuit flavor and mildly astringent hops. Not particularly memorable, but could be refreshing in a hot day. But man, that branding really makes one think they're drinking a Rolling Rock."

"Pours with a decent head that leaves a bit of lacing behind. Carbonation is light but steady - it's a decent looking beer. There is nothing ""off"" but nothing amazing here. It is a solid, understated pilsner. The dry finish leaves a lingering hop taste in your mouth - nothing overbearing, but definitely fuller-bodied than most mass-produced beers. This is a nice, sessionable beer, likely best enjoyed on a patio, at a backyard gathering or on a camping trip."

"O - i am slightly conflicted as this is really 'light' and incredibly easy to drink but mild throughout, very drinkable but nothing really stands out for me...but i would drink this again."

"The aroma was very grassy with a similar grassy, lemony or peppery taste balanced by a biscuity backbone. A very nice tasty beer with a bitter base and nice hop flavour."
"Pours a dark yellow/tree sap with two or so fingers of white foam. Aroma is subtle biscuit and weak apple juice, little to no hop aroma. Palate is sweet cornbread with a touch of noble hop spice. The hops do exert a subtle wintergreen effect on the palate. A bit of baker's yeast. Quite sweet for a pale lager and admittedly enjoyable on this level. Fairly dry finish and the hops do assert themselves a bit as you go. No frills North American pale lager, non-offensive but not distinguished except for being sweet for the style."

"O - Easy drinking, decent flavour profile and one of my go-to brews in a pinch. Nothing mind blowing here, but it'll easily please the masses."
""
""
"An absolutely fantastic Canadian beer! This is my absolutely favorite beer and I would recommend it to anyone looking to try. The color is pale, the carbonation is refreshing, the smell is intriguing and the taste is phenomenal. I've got all of my buddies drinking it now and anyone who tries it seems to say the same thing: it's an all around awesome beer."
""
""
""
"Is it the best Pilsner around? Probably not. Is it the best in Canada when compared to the macros? Absolutely!! Pale straw color, crisp refreshing mouthfeel, dry, slightly bready aftertaste, but still refreshing nonetheless. It's the beer that got me into micros. It's one of my go to beers always in my fridge ,from where I expand and experiment with other micros."
""
""
""
""
"O-looks and feel is right but the strange flavor throws off its crispness. Very possible it got like struck due to the green bottle"
""
""
"Final Thoughts - Now that I've looked back on this one, it becomes clear that my old can review was likely infected, as this is the overpriced Steamwhistle that I've come to moderately like. This is a beer that your macro drinking buddies will enjoy, but overly complex it is not and if the brewery didn't put such an effort towards environmental sustainability, having cool marketing and being a general comrade of the craft beer movement, I'd call foul on the price. It's worth trying though, no question."
""
""
""
"This is very much a summer beer for me. Love the carbonation factor, the clean crisp finish, and the mild hops in the aroma and taste. A simple beer, with a nice mouth feel. Airy and light . Although I really like it in the bottle, I do not care for it in the can, or on tap as much."

"People rant and rave about this one as being the best pilsner they have ever had. Well, those people have never been to Germany or the Czech Republic, heck, even Hungary makes a better pilsner than this one; however, I can appreciate what these guys are doing and I give them credit for changing hearts and minds. The beer pours a straw yellow, with nice lacing and it's got that sweet citrus aroma that most pilsners do. It looks like your typical Canuck lager but it tastes much better than any adjunct lagers out there. This is the beer you give to someone who declares that they will ""never drink that expensive craft beer", and the price point is right in line with the big boys of the world."

"Final Thoughts: Canada's Premium Pilsner succeeds were others (macro-lagers) fail. They stick to four basic ingredients: spring water, malted barley, hops and yeast. This is evident in the flavor and overall drinking experience. A beer like this one puts all macro-brewed 'pilsners' to shame! It doesn't boast any fantastic qualities, but it also doesn't have any off flavors. It is simply a beer that's easy to enjoy."

"Drank a pair while on vacation in Ottawa. It has been recommended to me several times in the past and I've had it before - I remember it not living up to the hype. The first beer poured (into a tall, slim glass stein) with no head and the second with a small amount of white, creamy head that stayed there entire time. The body is clear yellow, with a slight golden tinge. The aroma has apple, grape, and grain (presumably from the hops). The taste has that noble hops quality continued. It is a lightly flavoured beer; the flavour is similar to buttered bread. It is light to medium bodied with an almost perfect carbonation (little bit more would have been great). It feels very smooth. Overall, I find it to be a good, decent pilsner. I would gladly drink it again (would be a good session beer). I think I understand its popularity: it is light enough for mass appeal, but with a distinctive enough taste for people to think it is something unique and amazing."

"Pours a clear, yellow gold color, with a short and thick, white head. Foam faded slowly, minmal lace. Smell is slightly grass and herbal, no skunkiness detected. Taste is a nice mix of light bready malts, and floral balancing hops. Slightly acidic, but no real bitter hoppiness. Mouthfeel is light, medium carbonation, refreshing and easy to drink. Great for the patio. This may have been my first green bottle lager with no skunk (Thank you, Heineken, for my paranoia)"
""
""
"A nice beer for a warm afternoon, especially if you're eating spicy food. Not special, though. I would not try it again in a world full of new things to sample."
""
"Overall I would guess this is a bottle conditioned California common (steam) style pilsner. It came off more as an extract home brew than a commercial pilsner. If I'm wrong, perhaps I got a somehow-contaminated bottle. Overall disappointing, but a drinkable beer if you don't assume it's a pilsner before drinking it."
""
"Overall: Refreshing, with some body, less of a clean taste and more of a creamy texture. Pretty decent beer, I'd buy it again"
"I've been drinking this for a few years, and I'd say overall, this is still a pretty good go-to summer beer. There are better beers but its not half-bad, highly drinkable, and a decent style representation."
""
""
""
""
""
"Light body but a fairly strong carbonate feel in my mouth, finishes dry."
"D - A decent domestic brew for Canada and a nice refreshing beer for the summer time. Nothing to go out of the way to try, but I wouldn't turn it down on a hot afternoon. Pretty much average."
"Overall Impression- Beware! This is a HIGHLY drinkable brew and would be dangerous on a floating trip! Would love to see this guy (and possibly 11 others of it) in the near future. Highly recommend for its style and am a huge fan."

"Overall - An enjoyable pilsener by Steam Whistle. Not getting much in the way of hops, however, there are some other excellent refreshing flavours (like the hint of citrus zest)."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this is a decent beer. Very easy to drink but not really lacking in character. The flavors are light and free and refreshing. Could very well be socially drank at a cookout, a baseball game... something."

"O/D - Meh. Nothing I would seek out at all. Green bottle is a little off putting but my pops bought a sixer for Christmas so I'm not complaining. A craft beer for people who don't drink craft beer."
"Had this beer at the brewery in Toronto. I've had it both in the bottle of the line and in the tasting room. Nice white head and gold clear body. Smells nice and grassy. Light but not lacking in flavor. Nice and drinkable. Good beer. I have to say I would have this again."
""
""
"Is it BAD? No, just not my style - I can only see myself going for a beer like this on a hot day if I need something refreshing. In that regard it's OK - it's just not really for me."

"Perhaps it's the fact that this beer triggers sensory images of springtime hikes and lakeside trail runs but I love this beer. The packaging doesn't hurt either. I'm a sucker for a pretty bottle."
"Overall: Must try and must have."
"Overall - don't ever let anyone tell you that brewing a good pilsner is an easy task. It's certainly not the simplest style, it has no flavors or colors to hide imperfections and lagering beer cost money. Steam Whistle does a good job of living up to their motto of ""do one thing, and do it really, really well."" Their pilsner is refreshing and well put together. We give extra credit to any brewery willing to take on the big guys. Well done in that department Steam Whistle."
"Canned on august 15, 2011, 500 ml Aroma sorta familiar, pilsner malt, mild hop, but there is an aroma that's different...cant really explain what it is. Maybe its the Canadian water? Just has some type of aroma to it that's unique and it comes forward in the taste a bit also. Taste is certainly lager like, mild biscuit/bread, mild sweetness and bitterness. Easy, vey easy to drink. Not bad at all."
"Overall – Definitely a step up from most of the Canadian macros that you find at every bar/restaurant in Ontario. The taste won't blow you away, but it's refreshing and very drinkable. I could easily go through a 6 pack of these."
"Final Grade: 3.59, a B grade."
"One of those inoffensive ""soda-pop"" beers you often see at the cottage/camping."
"Crystal clear deep yellow, short-lived soapy white head. Aroma is slightly grassy and earthy, but is mostly dominated by sweet grains and corn. A light caramel sweetness is detectable throughout, along with a weak bready/biscuity malt backbone and metallic undertone. Little to no hop flavour or bitterness, just a touch of grassy flavour on the back end and a splash of bitterness on the tongue in the aftertaste. Lots of sweet corn flavours begin to come out more as it warms. Modest body with plenty of sharp, somewhat harsh carbonation. I've had this on occasion but never had the opportunity to review it. Not great, but well-distributed and perhaps slightly above the usual macro offerings."
"O - a very average beer that I used to enjoy much more - to be fair I am not a huge pilsener fan"
"O: I heard a lot of good things about this beer. It didn’t knock my socks off but I did enjoy it. It did a great job refreshing me on a hot summer day on the patio."
"Overall: An acceptable beer, which I know will be fresh in my area. Enjoy the simple flavours of this beer, so reach for it occasionally."
"Pours a pale straw color, white head, didn't stay long. Aroma is crisp, malt rich, with a bit of nuttiness. That carried over pretty equally into the taste: Malt rich, nutty. Feel was slick and creamy, but crisp and light in body. A pretty standard pilsner; not bad at all, but doesn't wow any."
"D - Bready and herbal, this is a well balanced and drinkable pilsner. The hop character is fairly robust with a lot of herbal character, but somewhat anemic bitterness. The malt is a bit lighter than I would like it to be as it has only weak touches of honey and bread though it does provide the beer with some thickness and body. Overall, it is a fairly well made pils that hits most of the appropriate notes for the style."
"Drinkability: It's a very smooth drinkable beer accompanied with good flavours and aromas. It's an overall good pilsener."
"Overall, this isn't exceptional or even great, but it really drinks well and tastes good. Really refreshing on a hot summer day without being devoid of flavour."
"I have enjoyed this on tap in the past, so either it is not as good in the can or my palate has improved."
"d-very drinkable. Great summertime beer."
"Sure, it's drinkable. I guess it's a step up from Molson and Labatt products. As the only beer being brewed by this brewery, however, I'd expect something a bit more solid than this stuff. I bought a few of these to make pizza dough with; I think I'll stick to using it that way."
"A pretty good pils that is highly drinakble with enough character that a glass is desired. The nose is there but I could do with more hops but it looks good and drinks clean and crisp. The finish is fairly abrupt for the style making it more of a patio beer than a year round lager."
"Had this on tap as the other choices were horrendous, as is often the case. Poured a pale yellow with nice white head. Good enough retention and a leaves a few spots of lacing. Smell is grassy hops and bread malt, typical pilsner I guess. Taste is muted, but a slight bitterness. This beer is good enough to order when the rest of the beer list sucks, but not good enough to seek out."
"Courtesy of the massive Canadian beer haul... Poured from the 500mL can into a pilsner glass. Its your typical straw gold, with a white, quasi-fizzy head that recedes pretty quickly; there are a couple bubbles of lace here and there. Aroma is of grains, spicy / earthy hops and some metallic tones. Taste is a bit more bready / doughy, with a well balanced hop bitterness on the finish - pretty smooth. Mouthfeel is on the light side of medium, with a somewhat lively carbonation. Pretty drinkable / refreshing - had one coming home off the golf course and it hit the spot."
"Green bottle pours a crystal clear golden body with a small white head. The head quickly falls to a ring and leaves only a few spots of lace. Aroma has a hint of spicy noble hops and some wet grain. Light medium body has plenty of carbonation. Taste has a dominant sweet bready maltiness that is balanced by a nice hop presence that is spicy, slightly floral, and has a hint of skunk. Drys out at the finish which saves drinkability."
"Tapped into a Steam Whistle glass. Two finger white head on clear golden colour. Moderate lacing. Malty smells. Some grass notes. Moderate flavour. Malty taste with a mild hop twist at the end. Well balanced. Medium body. Fairly high carbonation. Drinkability is fairly high."
"Steam Whistle sets out to brew a middle-of-the-road lager and, as their advertising boasts, they do that one thing and they do it really well. To call Steam Whistle ordinary is to understate the fact; while it offers mainstream drinkers a cleaner alternative to most mass-produced offerings it fails to transcend the pedestrian or unmemorable."
"D: This is an enjoyable and drinkable brew. I always look for it when I'm north of the border. Not filling and always room for one more."
"Certainly a good step above the macros but this isn't a pils I would recommend, especially due to other quality offerings in the area."
"D - An excellent pilsener. A little more in the palate would be nice but overall this is a very good beer that goes down very smoothly on a hot summer afternoon."
"D: it's smooth with minimal bitterness, much enjoyed!"
"500ml can from the LCBO. Popping the top yields a dry malt smell, slightly skunky. Pours to a bright golden yellow with a thin head that fades fast. Taste is decidedly malty with a hint of noble hops and a slight bitter tinge at the end with a tart aftertaste. The malt taste is fresh and the brew is dry throughout. Carbonation is good but could be a little higher. A good tasting brew in a great 1/2 liter package. It's a keeper, eh."
"Overall, a decent German pilsner. It lacks complexity but makes up for that with the clean and fresh taste of the biscuity malts and floral hops. It's a lot better than the last time I remember having this, and this is one I'd probably buy again. Seems more suited for a hot summer's day than a beer to sit down and savour."
"D- I think this is a very enjoyable beer. It has a nice flavor, is easy drinking due to its' smoothness and would make a perfect session beer. The alcohol is well hidden and I could see myself having a few pints of this beer at any time of the year. Well done!"
"Overall: I was always a little sceptical of this beer, being a relatively mass-produced micro pilsener in Canada. But I'm beyond impressed. This is a great beer that keeps you interested but doesn't kill your taste buds."
"The taste though surprised me, as it was pretty darn nice compared to what I was expecting. It had more complexity than I had expected, with a light biting bitterness and notes of bread. Medium carbonation rounded this out and makes this a beer I will drink again if I see it on a menu."
"A very drinkable pilsner, one that I've always enjoyed on summer afternoons. A bit sweeter on draft, but still great for a session."
"D - I could drink only this for hours. (And I have.) This is one brew that can regularly be found in my fridge."
"Altogether, this is simply not to my tastes; with apologies, I doubt I would recommend this beer to anyone."
"Drinkability - all in all, pretty refreshing. Just a little less taste than the canned equivalent which is a shame because this is a fine beer."
"I don't have a lot of bad things too say about this one, if you see it at the bar give it a go. I've met people who will defend this one too the death, it seems too have a cult following"
"OVERALL: Steam Whistle only makes one brew, and, like they say on the bottle, they make their one brew very well. This is a very good pilsner that can really hit the spot on a warm afternoon. Very drinkable as well, this is one worth trying if you get the chance. Well done."
"This beer's inexorable ubiquity in the Ontario marketplace means that it's often the best choice available in many bars and restaurants, so I like it for that. But that said, everything about Steam Whistle has the feeling to me of a micro-macro and it's hard for me to get excited about a brewery who only brew one beer and market the bejesus out of it."
"I will try this again if given the chance, but I'll try something different first if I want something with a bit more 'uummpphh'"
"Medium to light body, with a crisp and assertive higher carbonation"
"500ml can. Pours a clear gold with a fizzy white head that disappears quickly. Smells like a homebrew that was contaminated with cleaning agents--what seem to be chlorophenols dominate pils malt with a very light grassy hop aroma. A turn off. Thankfully, the taste isn't effected; all light, sweet malt with a very faint floral hop presence. Light bodied with medium carbonation. Aside from the slightly offensive smell, this isn't too bad, just uninspired and characterless."
"Pours a crystal clear light golden, some amber highlighting, medium sized bone white head forms, slowly settles down to a thin collar before disappearing completely, no real lacing on the glass. Smell is decent, very sharp and herbal, some honey like sweetness, straw and grass, lightly malty, some lemony character, sweet orange peel, not bad. Taste is similar, light on flavour, some toasty/biscuity malt, honey sweetness, light floral, some lemongrass, light finish, no real malt presence or hoppiness. Mouthfeel is light bodied with medium carbonation, pretty refreshing and easy to drink. Maybe a higher quality macro lager, I believe Steam Whistle is all malt. Still not very exciting, but I'm glad they have it in cans now."
"Tasty pils in my mind and I drank quite a bit of it during the last bachelor party escapade"
"A decent enough Canadian pilsner, if one a bit too obvious in its pandering to the BMC crowd. Easy to drink, and worthy of a go if your other options are the usual, sub-standard fare."
"(rated Jun 13, 2007)"
"Overall, it's lacking some of that crisp, hoppy character that I like about the Pilsener style, but it's still enjoyable, and would be excellent on a warmer day."
"I have had this on tap at Steam Whistle in Toronto. I have also had in the bottle and in the can at home and enjoyed all three every time. It pours a light gold color with little head. It is very drinkable, and one of the better Pilsners I have had. I you are in Canada pick some up for sure or at least try a free sample at the brewery."
"Drinkability: A good once and a while beer."
"D - The beer is very smooth, and goes down easy, especially when cold."
"A fine german style pils."
"I'd put this toward the top of my list for german pilseners. Not really an instand classic from the first sip but it slowly grows on you."
"Final Statement: You can rag on Steam Whistle all you want, but bottom line is it's a clean, light pils. Nothing to write home about, but I'll certainly drink and enjoy when offered."
"I tried this on tap and it is even better, even more of a grassy/hay taste, lots more flavour than the bottle."
"It's a good beer worth trying if you're in the area."
"clean and refreshing, great outdoor b b que beer."
"Tastes like a Pilsener, but more like its a distant relative. Notes of pale malt, floral hops and a faint bitterness. Crisp and drinkable but nothing to brag about, they only make one beer and I think they could improve (IMO)."
"Overall - While most often I find Canadian and American Pilseners to be generic and boring, this one stands out above the average."
"Working a short distance from the brewery itself (the old roundhouse at Toronto's Union Station houses the brewery today) and having watched it being built I was excited to try this beer. Needless to say the lack of aroma and flavour were very disappointing."
"Worth a try. In terms of Ontario pilsners, however, I'd go with Creemore's new limited edition Czech Pils over this - fresher and more flavourful. King Brewery also offers a more accurate interpretation of a European Pils, but it can't compete with Steam Whistle in drinkability. All in all, a mixed bag."
"This is easily one of the best Canadian micros I have had, and a fine example of a German pils."
"Overall, I like this Beer. I usually go for the bigger, heavier Beers but this one is very nice. A great summer Beer."
"Very drinkable. Nice noble hop use--well balanced and crisp."
"Notes: Special thanks to biegaman for the sample."
"Taste..Impressive. Very nice balance between the malts and the hops here. Certainly lacks the bite of a Euro pils..but still a pleasant blend here. Very, very easy to drink...I could find myself drinking a boat load of this without realising it. That is how easy this beer is going down. A keeper folks!"
"Had at Bierbistro in Toronto. Wasn't expecting this from a Ontario beer (most everything on-tap was malty) but passes as a very good current Pilsener. Light on the hops (I prefer a 40-50 IBU in Pilsners) with very good taste structure. Finishes well. Recommended for Pils fans."
"It's a clean smooth brew, that has only 4 basic ingredients and no preservatives which leaves it smooth and crisp and you could drink these all night and not be hung over the next day. I would compare this to Budvar and probably rank it right after it. This is a great beer!"
"D: Very good."
"D - Quite nice. Refreshing, with good hop flavour."
"Not only on-tap, but on-tap at the brewery in generous glasses as part of their tour. It was handed to me with a big, foamy, bone-white head. The color was a bright lemon-yellow and the Saaz hops were evident on the nose. The mouthfeel was medium, with a great,dry hoppiness on the tongue. The finish lingered with hops and left me licking my lips for more. I had some in a bottle later, but this was just fantastic!"
"This poured into a styrofoam cup (Yeah, i know. It's all I could get there..) nicely with a very thick creamy head that stuck around for the while time, quite nice. Smell was a bit hoppy but a tad skunky as well. The prominence of the hops in this brew were evident in the flavor, Bitter but not excessive. This was quite easy going down and was a very good BBQ beer, After all these years I learned to appreciate this one a bit more, and see it for what it is afterall, a pretty decent locally produced pilsener style beer."
"drinkable? I couldn't get enough of this on my trip. I wish somebody brewed a beer like this in Portland..."
"(Tried it later in bottle, but it was full of wet veggies, it was much better on draft)"
"I've also had Steam Whistle on tap, and find it's better that way."
"*Note* What a difference temperature makes. This brew becomes more enjoyable as it warms up a bit, so don't drink it ice-cold. However, if you must drink a beer ice-cold, I suggest drinking this from the bottle intead of pouring."
"Pale straw yellow colour with brilliant clarity and a thin white head that showed some lacing. The aroma was packed full of DMS, vegetal sweetness and sulfury hops. Veggie sweetness carried into the flavour. Bitterness was much harsher than it should have been, given the moderate hopping level. Light body, high carbonation. Not an impressive offering, at least to my palate."
"In general, I would say this is the type of beer that would be quite good on a hot day. Light and refreshing, but enough hops to let you know you're still drinking a beer."
"This beer often gets trashed and is actually classed in the wrong style category as an ajunct lager. It is 100% malted barley, no corn. I find it pleasing and nuanced in its flavours, making it an ideal camping beer or thirst quencher. Points go to Steam Whistle for packaging this beer in enclosed cardboard boxes after bottling it in green glass."
"Tap: Clear yellow beer with small head with below average retention. Aroma is quite sweet with more or less malt. Taste was quite enjoyable with some refreshing sweetness. Lacking a bit of character and body to make this truly good but better then some other lager that I had the misfortune of drinking over the years."
"Bender Factor: Their concept is cool. Steam Whistle is located in an old railroad roundhouse next to the Skydome. I really like their marketing ploy. The way that they have the samples and tours set up is outstanding."
"This Ontario micro is a pale gold color with a foamy medium sized head that leaves a little lace on the glass. The aroma is weak, a mix of bready malts and floral noble hops. The taste is quite nice with a unique doughy malt profile and a bit of spicy, floral hops. The mouthfeel is light with a spritzy carbonation. The finish is bland and shortlived. This beer is a good pilsner though its a bit vapid."
"Drinkability: hmm, not really a traditional Pils as it claims to be but on the other hand, it's not half bad. i admit this isn't a world class pils but it is drinkable and less offensive than most generic macros."
"I woudn't go out of my way for this. I would recommend this to a Coors, Coors Light, or Busch drinker looking for something of quality."
"Overall though this would make a good session beer, good summer beer but at $11.95 for a 6pack its waaay overpriced. For the same price I can get 6 500ml cans of Bitburger, Konig and other euro pilsners at the LCBO."
"PS. For $6, the tour, souvenir pint glass and all the samples you want, and a chance to pull their genuine steam whistle, it's a good deal."
"Drinkability: Pilsener does not equal watery, light, and fizzy. Clashing tastes and no body make for a bad beer experience."
"Ok beer in a retro green bottle. Enjoyed best at their brewery where there is often hoopla. Sweet floral taste with dry astringent aftertaste. Would have enough rather than a national Canadian brand but rank is weak compared to other microbrewery peers."
"However this stuff is pretty drinkable, I'll give it that. Yet I drank most of the case after chilling it in the freezer for about 15 minutes, and then directly out of the bottle. Great for barbequing. The glass pour exposes where it falls short."
"-F"
"Hmm, a below average pilsner, but alright too try once. Attractive green bottle with history on the back. Dangerous in that green can cause skunk, but the beers were fine. Poured into the mug with a whooosh of carbonation, causing a fast rising head that dissipated even faster. Smell of barley and pine were apparent in this brew. Taste was crisp and sweet with malt, but lacked the necessary hop balance. Mouthfeel was crisp at first, but after a few sips became annoyingly sticky. Drinkable, but not something I would want to consume alot of at once."
"Aside form the biasing factors of the brewery's cool location (in an old locomotive repair warehouse in downtown Toronto near the CN tower and Sky dome) and the functioning steam whistle that they let you blow at the end of the brewery tour, this beer is quite good. While it is a bit sweet for a pilaster, possibly explained by its extra long barley mash, it is hopped enough to give good balance. Seam Whistle Pilsner has a lovely golden color and a nice sweetish smell, piney notes are followed by a citrus laced finish."
"Not acceptable...Sorry but I did not care for this brew as it left me wanting...no hops in evidence here and the sweet malty taste carried through into the after taste...the packaging was probobly its strong point and that reminded me of a circus clown of low character.."
"The pour a clear and gold color with the head frothy in texture and the color white, size is average with the lace a thin covering upon the glass. Nose is malt and sweet, crisp and fresh, front sweet with a fair malt profile, the top skimpy in feel. Finish has a decent hop presence and the acidity stinging, quite dry aftertaste, drinkable but not much else to be said unfortunately."
"Revisted this beer as a new brewmaster was brought on line at SW. This is now a very nive malt biased pilsner...I love the tart biscuit finish now....smutty yeast taste is gone and the maly body is significantly improved....this is a micro pils for those who like a malt accent to this style"
