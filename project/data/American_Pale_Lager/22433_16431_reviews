"No head, a little dark for a pale ale. Nice bit of honey flavor, otherwise fairly plain. Not totally unenjoyable but pretty simple stuff."
"The beer is fucking garbage. There's your outlier reasoning."
""
"I'm not sure why it has all the poorer reviews.  Maybe I just got a really fresh batch.  If you like light Pilsners, and you are in Florida, I'd say give it a chance.  Hope you agree."
""
"Overall- I didn't care for this beer, a little to over the top flavor wise for me."

"Overall:  Bragg or pilsner, this beer personally wasn't for me."

"*Correction* Orange Blossom Pilsner is a 5.5% ABV beer , not 6.5% like listed"

"god for very hot weather. I could see this as a good tourist beer for something th really reflects interior Florida without bittiness. Ladies who I have shared it with who are not normally beer drinkers are fond of it."

"An ok beer. No off flavors but not overly flavorful. Refreshing."

"And remember, if you're gonna drink, don't drive, but if you have to drive, then do us all a favor and don't drink..."

"O- Don't waste your money on this. There are so many better lagers for the same price."

"The flavor is very minimalistic. You get a decent amount of funk in there. You also get some very plain pilsner presence. There is nothing exceptional going on here."

"This looked different, and I wanted to try more local Florida beers. I wasn't sure if I'd like a fruit beer, but this one surprised me. It wasn't overly fruity at all. The honey taste is there, but it's very subtle, and compliments the rest of the beer nicely. It's a darker beer, and had a nice, slightly heavy after taste. Worth a try."
""
""
"O: A very interesting beer with an almost perfume-like smell to it. A little too sweet and orange for me... I had to try it since I was in FL and it was a local beer but it seemed a little bit kitschy to me. Felt more like something from a BMC company than a craft brewery."

"I'm a sucker for something different and I thought that's what I was going to get here. Pours and looks like a macro. Not a watery macro, but more along the lines of Coors Banquet. Real strong taste of honey upfront. I could even taste some light green tea like flavors (think a cup of ice green tea with three teaspoons of honey). I was feeling it but after awhile it got a little cloying; which contradicts the fact that it has a very thin mouthfeel. It's not bad, but it's not great either. I would try it again on a hot day, or even if I had a sore throat, because the honey in this beer would probably soothe it. I'd like to make a note that the ABV on this beer isn't 6.5%. Unless they changed it, because it states it's 5.5% on the label of the bottle I had."

"This is quaffable beer, but it's not all that good. Flavors are weak and at times smack of a macro lager."
"Poured a filtered pale orange, with a big fluffy white head on the initial pour, which fades to a light film and a thicker collar - no lace. Nose has some light grass, a general stinkiness about it, orange and a touch of some honey-like sweetness. Some sharper macro-like grainiess. Taste has some plain pale malts, with a slight nod to the orange again. More grain and adjunct in the finish. Medium high carbonation, a little rough throughout. Light body and difficult to choke back at times. Not horrible, but something I can imagine being a little more desirable in the hot Florida setting."
"High drinkability if you like the basic lager taste, but a bit dull to average in flavor overall. Seems like the brewers are new to making beer as this was all over the place and not even close to a fruit beer."
"O- the nose is by far the best part of this mediocre beer. I wanted to like this more because of the nose"
"Wanted to try this one because I love orange blossom honey, but this beer doesn't warrant a full review...clear pale with no head to speak of. Smells like macro corn later and tastes like PBR. No honey character to speak of either. Fail. It's a marketing gimmick aimed at tourists."
"O: Not the most pleasant drinking experience, but I've certainly had worse."
"O: Pass, there are better brews out there to spend your money on."
"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass at Daytona Pig Pit, the beer pours a clear yellow-gold coloring with a two finger head of thin, foamy bubbles that quickly recede to a white film. Malt and grain on the nose, with a hint of orange esssence. The beer has pale and sour malt flavors, with sweet orange undertones that balance, but don't overpower. Crisp and light, you get a sense of the honey sweet in the body and the finish. Very mild sweet aftertaste makes a very easy quaffer on a hot day."
"D: It is refreshing and would be enjoyable on the beach."
"Nothing wrong with this but nothing really RIGHT either. The extreme orange and honey sweetness may limit this one's drinkability."
"Overall, not really my kind of thing. Its decent for non-craft drinkers but not my thing. Cheers!"
"Mouthfeel was good. Very light bodied. The sweetness is the only thing that would hold you back from drinking a bunch of these."
"D- Very drinkable but on the sweet side."
"D: What's with all the bad reviews? I found this to be highly gulpable and a guilty pleasure!"
"As has been said, this doesn't resemble a pilsner in any meaningful way. The base is an unremarkable pale lager."
"This just isn't a very good beer. Not worth seeking out."
"had to try this at a bar when i was in FL..it looks ok it a pils color clear with a small white head.smell was biscuit with honey and bread..taste was a attempt at a pils with honey infused its average it almost like BMC said lets make a pils and failed..mouth feel has some carbonation but its dish water feel with infused honey..saw it on the bottle list at the bar but really not worth a try"
"I was pouring this as part of a beer tasting at the liquor store I work at. Poured a golden orange color with a smallish head. Smell was faint citrus and a little burnt honey. Taste was flat and thin with a twang of orange in the middle and a dry honey finish. Carbonation was mild with no desire for another."
"Drinkability is low. Too sweet and just plain doesnt taste good enough to drink more than one. If you like this you need help."
"D: Eh not much here, I would not suggest, even for someone looking for a honey beer, because there is none to be found. Still this is a light beer and maybe some could put down a few, I find it hard to conceive for myself due to lack of taste."
"I guess the brewer has a very broad definition for ""pilsner."" Put this up against your typical English Golden Ale and you would not be able to tell the difference. Looks like someone is trying to pull the wool over the consumers' eyes with lingo and talk of honey. Give this beer a pass."
"Pass."
"Better than I expected, as nothing was bad."
"Attractive amber hue with brilliant and frothy head, which dissipated almost entirely within a minute or two. Faint aromas of candied citrus but not much else. A bit washed out on the palette but otherwise pleasant and inoffensive. Clean and tangy on the back, which is perhaps the best thing about this beer. That it washes away nicely and is refreshing. You could do worse than that."
"Aroma is malty and rather typical, but the undertone of honey sweetness adds something. It pours an uninspiring clear amber with a quickly dissipating head. Flavor is decent, malty and somewhat sweet, enjoyable if not outstanding. Texture is fairly smooth and tingly."
"D - Not bad, bot not tasty either. Gimmicky beer. Why is Florida's honey beer made in South Carolina?"
"Overall I relearned the fact that curiousity kills the cat. This one really isn't worth checking out."
"Drinkability: Goes down very smooth. Very easy to drink, and if the alcohol were a little lower, this would make a great session beer. Unfortunately, the orange and the honey just don't come through, and without those flavors, it's just an average pilsner."
"Pours a clear pale yellow color. 1/4 inch head of a white color. Poor retention and poor lacing. Smells of pale malt, yeast, grain, slight hops, and some citrus (orange). Does not seem fit the style of a Herbed/Spiced Beer. Mouth feel is smooth and crisp with an average carbonation level. Tastes of yeast, pale malt, slight grain, slight citrus (faint orange), and very slight hops. Overall, the herb/spice is supposed to be honey, I guess, but its flavor is not preceptable. I wouldn't think honey by itself would lend a beer the the herbed/spice category, especially at the levels in this beer."
"Gross. A waste."
"Thomas Creek makes some decent brews but this didnt cut it for me.Poured alighter golden with real orange hue a thinner quick to fade white head atop,the aromas werent bad,some toasted malt with a light dose of sharpness,the orange aroma is sweet smelling...artificial in nature.Sweet on the palate upfront wich is a turn off right away for me,the orange taste is nearly cloying and overpowers pretty much anything else.Just not my thing,I think I'll stay from the double version of this as well."
"On tap at The Hunt Club. Light honey flavour, waterish mouthfeel, this is closer to a carbonated and slightly hopped mead than a pilsner. Better than a plain honey beer. Nothing to look at, a tad orange aroma. The pils gives some balance but still too sweet. Drinkable, once."
"Drinkability is average - more a lawnmower beer than a session beer. Nothing special."
"This is an odd attempt at a belgian style ale. It must be confused with its pilsner side. Decent beer but not one I would seek out."
"The mouth is crisp and a tad spritzy, but I think it is very refreshing for this style. Flavor is mildly sweet with hints of honey, and some faint sweet orange. Finishes with a semi-sweet apple taste. This is pretty refreshing and plenty quaffable. They need to tweak some aspects a bit, but I'd have it again."
"Sadly, I bought a six-pack based on a recommendation from a friend and I hate to waste beer, so I'm going to have to endure more than one of these."
"Overall, worth a try."
"Drinkability: I think this is a below average pilsner, almost Corona like. I will not search this out again. I did not get much of a taste of either orange or honey"
"D - The snifter actually turned out to be a good idea, since this is pretty much my dessert for the night. It's too sweet to be consistently easy drinking and I can't imagine downing more than one or two of these at a time. Since this brewery is a one-trick pony, they would've been better off using a maltier beer to house what seems to be pretty high-quality honey."
"On-tap at Flying Saucer, served a nice crisp straw yellow with a thin head. Aroma is a bit of honey an slight hops. The taste is an interesting blend of the usual Pilsner hoppiness and honey. The beer is light bodied and easy-drinking. This is certainly an interesting beer, but not likely one I'd try again."
"The drink is indeed crisp and refreshing, as per the label's boast, but is only so as a result of a thinnish-medium body with mild carbonation. Not bad. Not good. Both quaffable and completely forgettable."
"D: This is really an average beer. Not the most horrible thing I've ever had, but certainly doesn't make you want to remember it."
"I would drink this again if available in my area!"
"Body is very refreshing and thin. Very summery beer. Great quaffer in the sunshine. Clean finishing."
"Goes down bland and it isn't one I'll have again."
"Bottle labeled as ""Florida's Honey Beer"". Pours a bright golden colored with tons of carbonation and a huge off-white head. Aroma is fruity with honey and a bit grainy. The beer tastes very sweet with lots of honey and a touch of hops in the background. It's too sweet, almost to the point where it seems a little sticky. Interesting and defnitely a unique brew. They make a OBP Squared... I can only imagine how sweet that one is."
"D - This is pretty cool to drink and try but I would not drink this one a regular basis. Light beer enthusiasts would probably prefer this over other beer drinkers. Worth a shot but will not become part of my regular line-up."
"Overall not bad, not my favorite but surely nothing terrible. I would not have an issue with trying this one again during the hot months. Give it a try as it's an understated light summer beer."
"Drinkability is ""meh"". Kinda requires faster drinking. Tends to ""flatten out"" as it warms."
"A decent beer. Perhaps two of these in a sitting would be ample simply due to the sweetness and lack of any refreshing qualities."
"This beer poured a nice golden straw color with a huge, fluffy white head which disappates slowly. Lacing is present but minimal. The aroma is a musty smell with a hint of sweet. The taste is..interesting. It has a weird candy taste to it. It's actually not all that bad. Different. Easy to drink and refreshing. Mouthfeel is medium body and highly carbonated which was evident on the pour. Overall I don't find it to be a horrible beer. It's as I said before refreshing and easy to drink."
"Not undrinkable, but this one needs some work. A true pilsner or an all-malt lager would be the better direction for this brew, scrap the orange or the honey (how bout both). Still looking for a great brew from Florida."
"I'm editing my review based on a later tasting of another batch. It still sucks. Very astringent, no good qualities, undrinkable even by beer novices."
"Pours a clean/clear golden yellow color, nice carbonation, tiny fizzy white head, some sticky lacing around the edges. The nose is malty, slight orange tone, and some caramel. The taste is sweet, malty, getting some citrus, and caramel. Light-Medium body. Drinkable, not too bad, would still take it over the big three."
"This was recommended by my firends at Knightly Spirits. It pours a light golden color with plenty of white foam and a meager lace. The aroma is definitely earthy, a bit stank and skunky, not real inviting. The flavor is a bit more encouraging where you pick up on the honey idea but it is only vaguely sweet, more leaning toward bready and bisuit with this over riding stagnant water affect that is not particularly rewarding. It is kind of unique, maybe worth a try for those that like variety. Personally I would actually like to have more of a sweet honey flavor than what this pilsner offers, but it's OK. I would drink it again but I won't seek it out. It offers an average mouth feel with moderate carbonation, easy enough to drink as a relatively light and refreshing beer but the stagnant water idea sort of turns you off from over indulgence. It is somewhat true to the pilsner form so proceed accordingly."
"The taste is a big mix of honey and orange that's slightly pungent...that's the good part. The honey, I think, is over done and drags the taste down with its earthy, semi sweet, not so tasty flavour. I think they need go a different route because this doesn't work too well. Hell of a retentive head of foam though!"
"Drinkability: Fine for a crisp, light beer with a hint of honey!"
"12oz bottle poured into a pint glass. Pours a golden yellow color with a small white head that leaves a decent amount of lacing around the edge of the glass. The smell is grainy malt with a touch of sweet honey. The taste much like the aroma is grainy with a touch of sweetness from the honey flavors. Overall, this brew tastes pretty much like a macro-lager with some honey flavors. I really have no interest to try this again."
"Clear, sharp, golden yellow color with more life than normally seen in a pilsner. An effervescent crush of bubbles right on the pour and then no head to speak of. A light bit of grain in the nose with a note of honey that is expected but nonetheless pleasant and authentic. Unfortunately, there's not much to the taste besides that honey, complemented by a hint of orange. The underlying grains have little character, but the honey at least doesn't overassert itself. Mouthfeel is a little watery but is partly redeemed by a nice bit of crispness in the finish. This one is fine for a fruit beer. Rather a one-trick pony but not so overdone as many fruit beers, but this one plays it too safe."
"I was pretty sure I wouldn't like this, and guess what? It poured a golden straw colour with a big white head and actually looked half way decent. Smell was sickeningly sweet and to be honest, there was almost a faint smell of natural gas present here. In short: It stinks. Taste is kind of hard to pinpoint. There is a faint element of honey here and it's a little bitter, but to really describe it is rather difficult. Mouthfeel is water thin. At the very least, now I can say that I've tried it. Totally not for me, though."
"12 oz bottle as pictured. Pours a clear pale yellow body with a small white head that quickly vanishes. No lacing. Aroma is restrained. Adjuncts and faint honey and floral notes. Light medium body with strong carbonation. Taste is unremarkable. American light lager characteristics dominate. Vegetal and corn syrup notes, but not strong enough to taste bad. Fizzy carbonation suggests a mass market lager. Not much to recommend it. Contract brewed in Maryland."
"D - Nice blend of a pilsner with honey but the wierd vegetal aftertaste ruins it."
"Thanky to Bross242 for the sample"
"""B" for creativity, but otherwise an abomination."
"drinkability: would be pretty high if not for the wierd aftertaste"
"N.B. My bottle says it was brewed by Frederick Brewing Company of Maryland, but otherwise an identical bottle. No alcohol content listed, which surprised me. Is that legal?"
"This beer pours a honey color from a brown twelve ounce bottle. It does have some aroma of orange blossom, but also some off notes. Taste is not terribly exciting, like a macro with sort of a honey sweetness. Definitely a macro aftertaste under the honey flavoring. Not particularly good, I wouldn't go looking for this, on the other hand, I'd probably drink one if it was handed to me."
"This is a beer that I would certainly recommend to try. It is certainly a Florida flavor even though the beer is only MADE FOR unique beers. It is actually made in Maryland by Frederick Brewing Company for Unique beers here in Florida. Give it a whirl!"
"Last swigs: Wet paper ale. Just was looking for something different. This was average, but not different. Contract brewed by Frederick, MD."
"I feel kind of bad for breweries that make stuff like this. Only people who are seriously committed to B.M.C. would be interested, but why would they drink this when they can have Bud, Miller, or Coors?"
"The taste starts out with a lightly sweet orange blossom taste (actually, as the name suggests, this is the best way to describe it). Unfortunately the beer dies a quick death in the mouth; it becomes thin and unsatisfying towards the finish. A bit of citrus character linger on through to the finish, but a thin watery-beer character is what wins out in the finish. Ok, enough griping, this is still a refreshing beer, quite light and easy drinking. It would definitely be nice on a hot day."
"The beer pours a dull gold with a small head that dissipates quickly and does not lace. The head reminds me of carbonation found on a coca-cola. There is not much of a smell at all with the exception of faint orange aroma. The hop flavor is almost non existant which I found odd especially for a ""pilsner"". The overall lack of flavor is reminiscent of a macro however unlike a macro this beer does not contain stron rice or corn flavors. It has the ""beer"" taste to it with a faint orange added in but overall the taste is just weak. The mouthfeel is a tad watery but pretty average overall. As far as drinkability goes, it is hard to call a beer so mild undrinkable. The beer isnt so much bad as it is weak. It definitly could use some more hops."
"Well the muted nose is just a prelude to a muted taste. Very subtle flavors of citrus, orange, and malt. Not much here. Nothing bad, just not much at all. Very light body with a clean finish. Of course isn't not hard to clean nothing."
