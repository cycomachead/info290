"O: Upslope Craft Lager was a solid pale lager, probably more in the pre-prohibition lager mode than a helles or pilsner given the evenness of the malting and hopping. Nice job and I look forward to trying a few more Upslope offerings this trip."

"OVERALL:  What this beer lacks is one of its greatest strengths; that sweet, corn-syrupy taste and feel that most Light American Lagers have way too much of.  It keeps the beer refreshing and easy to drink.  It is just what Iâ€™m looking for out of an American Lager, but never find with the big boys."

"Wow - I guess I shouldn't be all that surprised that this brewery could spit out such a heady ode to the best Bohemian pilseners out there - they surely do.  Perhaps I should have known this from the outset, given their basic, but still engaging ingredient list: Snowmelt, Malt, Czech Saaz Hops, and Lager Yeast.  A recipe for success, if I've ever seen one."

"O: 4.0 - Nothing exciting here, but this is a solid session beer."

"I like a lot of lighter beers, though this style is kind of blah for me.  But this is a very good lager, and it tastes good in the can too, which is a plus.  Not everyone gets canning right, but these guys do.  It's just a bit heavier than a session beer, but you can still do that without much trouble."

"Really well crafted for sure, a really basic single hop lager with no frills about it. They did a great job of keeping and imperfections in this basic beer. Just a crisp lager with a light malt body and Saaz hops that add I slight spicy hop profile on an overall bright grassy beer . Great intro craft beer for people."

"Body is ridiculously drinkable, yet still has character, with a bit of a slick finish and a crispy hops afternote. Plentiful carbonation. Upslope = damn good beer."

"Flavor: nicely balanced with sweet barely malt, biscuit, apple, and some mild hops in the finish. Overall: a very pleasant and drinkable lager. Well done Upslope!"

"Creamy mouthfeel and so drinkable, almost a session beer by US standards but not quite. Still, I could enjoy putting away a few cans of this Craft Lager and not feel guilty. Upslope is a solid brewery in my book."

"This beer works decently for style, but for such a simple lager the quality and balance have to be almost perfect to really set it apart. While a notch better, it really doesn't stand out far enough many of the macro lagers on the market. Easy to drink and potentially sessionable, it just doesn't do it for me."

"Not a bad lager at all. For me, there is a mineral and sulfur like character that is a bit off putting. Though not enough to kill the beer. Maybe not something I will reach for first in the future, but not a bad second tier option."
"Taste mimics the nose with a good moderate dose of saaz hops providing earthy, spicy notes, plus a little bit of lemon. Light bready malts lend a slight sweetness. This is a flavor profile everyone is accustomed to from mass marketed pale lagers, but pay close attention and you'll notice the hop bill has been ratcheted up a little here and things are overall more refined. Nice refreshing beer that goes down easy without being too boring."
"Overall, the right notes are there, but it is too light for me. However, I think they accomplished their goal of making a light and unoffensive lager."
"It's an outstanding beer."
"Pours golden yellow with a moderate white head, that leaves lacing as it subsides. Can says they use Saaz hops in this one. Nose is sweet, mildly skunky and herbal. Tastes very bready, corn/grain, has some sweetness, and very mild bitter back end. This would be excellent to take fishing or to pound after some summer yardwork. Mouthfeel is crisp, light, and refreshing, with medium carbonation. Overall this lager packs a lot of flavor, is super drinkable, and the more I drink it, the more I like it."

"Overall, a tasty little lager that I will keep in mind for my next party."

"Awesome to see another craft brewer go wild and brew an American lager, and Upslope went right for it. The retro flavor is there, and it drinks very easy. The only missing factor is that it does not come in the tallboy format. Not a problem knocking a few of these back."

"A thanks to the creator of the canquest, woodychandler, for this beer. Poured from a 12 oz. can. Has a light golden color with a 1 inch head. Smell is sweet, malty. Taste is crisp, malts, some grains, none of the sweetness in the smell, kind of on the mild side. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a decent brew."

"Overall: An excellent clean, refreshing canned lager."

"The Crack revealed yet another brimful craft CAN and so it was time for an inverted Glug. Now, before I proceed, I need a disclaimer. As a native Pennsylvanian, I know how hard it CAN be to use lager yeast and since we have centuries of experience, PA lagers are some of the finest outside of Germany and the Czech Republic, IMHO. That said, I tend to be hard on craft CANned lagers. I got a finger of foamy, bone-white head with moderate retention from my pour. Color was a pale yellow with NE-quality clarity. Nose was lightly grassy, leading me to wonder what happened to those lovely hops, along with a very characteristic honey-like lager sweetness. Sofa. Sofa, so good, because when I CAN smell the honey characteristic of the malt, it means that NO adjuncts were involved. Mouthfeel was medium, about right for the style, and I got grassy hops on the tongue, but not as prevalently as I might have liked. Finish was both grassy and slightly metallic. It was not a bad beer, per se, but as a lager, it was found by me to be lacking. Keep tweaking this one, fellows."

"O-This beer is nothing to write home about, but there is a decent flavor, which makes it a decent alternative to macro-AAL-type beers. The problem I have is that for the same price, you can get significantly more flavorful session type beers, so unless you have a hankering for a lightly flavored pale lager, why buy this over say...Sierra Nevada Pale or Dale's Pale?"
"Flavors of grassy hops, minerals, light caramel....crisp, refreshing but also a touch of bitterness in the initial bite through the finish."

"Conclusion: It seems to me that most of the reviewers on this site are still in their craft beer adolescence. By that I mean that they want simplicity, bold and easy to identify flavors, and constantly are seeking to ""one-up"" the beer they drank yesterday. Thus a mild flavored, low ABV, easy drinking beer such as this will score low. What if Upslope intended to keep everything mild mannered? And if so, why is that mandate a low score? I digress. This beer could almost pass as a kolsch as it is fruitier and slightly sweeter than the standard lager. Warmer fermentation perhaps? Either way, this is light, drinkable, and quiet tasty."
"This is a very nice, refreshing lager with well-rounded grain hop character. Flavorful enough enjoy a few in a row, and with the low ABV, it would do well as a session beer."
"O: Just a great craft lager in the German style. I could see hop lovers being slightly disappointing here, as malts really steal the show. I really enjoy it and find it to be a perfect fishing or lawn work beer."

"for a pale lager, this is damn good. pours a straw yellow color with a 2 inch white head nice and thick on top. smells more malt than hops, but some bitter notse come through in the taste from what appears to be a fairly generous hopping for this style. mouthfeel is excellent, good carbonation, not too too light on the body, and a crisp finish. very easy drinking, and interesting enough to want to drink a bunch of them. i have really enjoyed every upslope brew ive tried so far, and this one was no exception. stood up well to some hot food."

"Pretty good, if not unusual."

"Beer is medium to light in body and sweet up front with a good finish. As far as a little pilsner goes, above average for sure but a little boring. I wish for something more the entire time drinking it, I'd have a dry hopped version on tap someday if that were possible."
"I laud Upslope for always putting out a solid product, a small brewery shouldn't pull too many punches and you know what you are going to get every time, a beer that is true to style, a bit lackluster in creative approach but solid."
"Pours a golden bright color. Nice head produced from vigorous pour. Light Czech Saaz hops on the nose. Very refreshing taste that goes down easy. At 4.8% abv this will be my new summer beer. I love that Upslope has expanded their portfolio with an awesome lager."
"Cheers."
"$6.99 a six pack yesterday at Argonaut; Hadn't had it, and the price was right. Poured a clear golden color with a small white head. Aromas of bread yeast, biscuit and light hops. On the palate, this one was medium bodied with flavors of bread, yeast and light hops."
"12oz can with orange accents on the can. Color is yellow and the head is just ok. Smells like your average lager, beery. Taste is not bad but doesn't wow me at all. This is super easy to drink but for $8.49 I'm going to go with something else every time."
