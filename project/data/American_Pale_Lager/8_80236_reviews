"Apparently, they also left out punctuation! I Pop!ped the cap and began a hard pour, which netted me ~ three fingers of foamy, bone-white head with limited retention. Color was a crystal-clear Pale-Straw (SRM = 1 - 2). Nose had the honey-like sweetness that I usually associate with Lagers, but this was supposed to be G-F. WTF?!? Mind = blown. Mouthfeel was medium. Taste was reminiscent of summers on the farm - honey, hay, mown grass. Clean, light, easy-drinking, this was better than many AALs that I have been exposed to and it is G-F! Holy ... Finish was clean, semi-sweet and unquestionably the best of the lot so far."

"Brew pours a clear straw-yellow in color with a thin foamy/fizzy head that settles down to mostly around the sides of the glass in less than 10 minutes. Ring-lacing is seen at first then slides back down after a few sips. The aroma is of grains for the most part with a light hint of corn also. More going on with the flavor as this actually doesn't taste like the typical 'Pale Ale' and even leaning towards a Hefeweizen (wheat beer) even. Great taste and goes down easy. No harsh or bitter aftertaste at all unlike some pale ales. Tasty brew. Lighter+ bodied with good carbonation. Overall I liked this one and don't care if if is ""Gluten-Free"" or not."
"Overall : this surprised me. I can't help but view it throught the lens of gimmick by being gluten free, but on its own it's just a damn good lager. I like it and would have it again."
"Terrible,  skunky is the highlight  of this beer.  Actually  the appearance is ok.  That is the best I can say."
"O: [3.50] This is a beer you could transition someone from BMC to craft with.  It has a mild taste but is slightly more complex than an AAL.  This would be great on a hot day.  If I had Celiacs I would be all over this.  It doesn't seem to be missing anything in the flavor profile."
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a pale yellow color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of grains, grassy. Taste is mild, grains, grassy, some malts, very easy drinking. Feels light in the mouth and overall, while not a very flavorful beer, it would make a good thirst quencher on a hot day."

"Forget gluten-free, this is one of the better lagers, period, that I've had in a long while.  Crisp, tasty, and well-rounded, with a few old-world nods, the kind that make me shake my head when I see what this is listed as here - 'light lager', really?  Ok, things and recipes may have changed over the intervening years, but I think this offering deserves a whole shitload more respect than to be lumped into THAT category."

"Excellent Gluten Free Bier. Light Crisp Taste. Nice to find a gluten-free bier that isnt made from Sorghum or Rice."
""
"Don't look for much in the way of a challenge here. Think PBR, Budweiser, etc. It's a straight forward lager. The value here is that it is a gluten free tailgate-style beer. A pale yellow color should set you up for a clean, albeit simple taste. It finishes with the slightest hint of bitterness. To this beer's merit, it is slightly more complex than your generic ""'Murcian"" lager. Price tag aside, this beer is great option for ingredient-conscious drinkers who appreciate a cold, consistent, light(er) beer."

"Overall: A completely refreshing, tasty lager. Probably wouldn't choose this over a cheapest macro though due to the price."

"O: lowering the gluten ppm or not, they made a fine lager here... can't say if the extra malt heft will turn off those who prefer their lagers to taste damn near like water, but the rest of it's close enough!... a ""light"" lager that drinks more like an import German helles?..."

"Thought lagers were usually heavier, i like the lightness of this one. Has a bit of a citrus taste like a Blue Moon, but is crispier...pretty tasty for a gluten free beer. I poured a bottled beer into a chilled mug, it was refreshing. The after taste is so so, it's better on the lips."

"Presentation: Packaged in a standard twelve-ounce longneck bottle with a pry-off crown, served in a New Belgium Brewing chalice"
""
""
"O: OK but not worth seeking out."
""
""
""
" The taste of this lager is lightly grainy with a very light toasted accent with slight hint of yeast adding a mild fruit element with light grass almost a spice-like flavor as it finishes. Overall I like this about as well as most other light lagers, but this seems to have a little more body than most which makes it a skosh more enjoyable I would probably not be able to tell it is a gluten free product if I tried this blind, but I probably would not purchase this again even though it is ok for the most part."

"As most say, not bad for a gluten-free beer - I like beer but not the beer belly and hope Omission will stay available at my local - Rovers in Austin."

"Overall: decent. Experience not outstanding but not bad. Niche product that is drinkable and bodes well given gluten-free."

"Overall a pretty decent gluten free beer."

"O - This is not half bad for the style. Gluten or not, I'd put this neck above the big three any day."
"Good mouthfeel but overall, this is another very ordinary brew whose subtle-ish flavours don't do anything for my taste buds. It's about as exciting as the label on the bottle."

"This beer prizes itself for being brewed gluten free. It uses a special process to remove the gluten and by doing so, the beer is free from an ingredient that some people cannot consume, and that makes it a beer that most anyone can consume. It is a decent effort from Widmer- certainly nothing amazing, but not bad overall."

"Overall- Slightly above average. I only bought it so I could sample a representation of the style. It perhaps fails at that but I prefer its failure to the “success” of its BMC counterparts."

"O: Pretty average Light Lager, but miles above the big Macro brews. Pretty low ABV makes it very drinkable. Not a bad little brew..."
""
"Overall: A really solid brew. Nothing to run out and go get but if you can pick it up in a mix six some time I would definitely recommend it. Nice afternoon beer."
""
""
"Very good for a Light Lager."
""
""
"The flavor is grainy with a vague hope bite finishing things off. It really is nothing out of the ordinary but would be easy to drink on a warm day."
""
"They did a good job of making a gluten free version of the a typical bad American light beer, but otherwise nothing to see here."

"Continuing the expansion of my gluten-free beer horizons. This stuff pours a clear pale straw topped by a finger of relatively short-lived lightly off-white foam. The nose is nearly nonexistent, though there's a wafting of pure cellulose, like the water dripping from a piece of split celery. I can't say it's necessarily a bad thing, just a feeling like they weren't at all trying here. The taste holds notes of light wheat, light flowers, dried honey, and a vague sense of something sweet-ish that I can't quite put my finger on. The body is a hefty light, with a light moderate carbonation and a watery feel. Overall, a pretty weak brew, one that seems to compound some of the negative things I've heard about GF beers."

"D - For what it is, it is actually pretty well done. It doesnt compare to a truly full flavored beer, Ii it is intended to be a gluten free substitute for light lager it's a home run as there is nothing about it that (other than the poor foam) that screams gluten free and I would say it actually tastes like real beer."
""
""
"O: Overall an average drink. Really nothing to brag about, no chance at repeat, less chance of a reccommendation."
"12 oz single from Roths Sunnyslope Market in Salem. $1.67 Actually quite nice looking for a lager golden yellow with a good sized bubbly white head. Fine honeyish,grassy aromas. OK Clean slightly grassy hop, semi sweet taste,perfectly reasonable. Mouthfeel is strange it starts OK but trails off to a wateriness..with a strange bitterness. Overall though an OK lager and a good gluten free."
""
"I think people are forgetting the style of this beer. This beer kills most anything in it's style category."
""
""
""
"Pours a hazy light yellow with a foamy white head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of grains and a slight skunky aroma. Taste is mainly of grains with a mild bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is an average beer that isn't too bad but nothing I would want to drink again."

"Poured from a bottle into a tumbler pint, the beer is almost completely clear, with a tinge of yellow-gold and no head whatsoever. I could read one of those optometrist's eye charts through this thing. Wow, very clean. Aromas of toasted grains, a slight buttery highlight, and some floral notes. Flavors of grain and cereal initially, with a slight roasting on the tail-end of the palate. Very light and clean in mouth, with a crisp, almost sharp finish. Roasty, slightly grainy aftertaste. This beer is clean and very well put together, but it just lacks a lot of substance. Interesting idea behind this line of brews, though."
""
""
"Overall – Nothing too really go out of the way for."
"12oz bottle, pours a clear and straw colored, topped with a thin, white head that holds decent retention and leaves some lacing at the top of the glass. Aromas are typical for the style - lager yeast, grassy hop. Tastes are grassy, biscuity, sharp & clean, finishes semi-dry. Mouth-feel is rather thin and watery. This is better than the macro offerings of a light lager, but still not worth another purchase."
"Pale yellow body. virtually no head or lacing. Spicy hop aroma. Slight skunk, off aroma starts to develop as the beer warms. Clean taste. Bready. Mellow tasting. Nice lager. I didn't know this was gluten free until I started this review. An excellent gluten free beer. Drink cold."

"A friend gave this to me to try but I didn't realize it was gluten free until now. Pours a crystal clear deep golden straw color with a smallish white head that dissipates quickly. Smells of spicy hops and sweet bready pilsner malt with a bit of a strange tartness that I can't put my finger on. The flavor holds a bit of spicy noble hops, a bit of pilsner like malt flavor and again a strange tartness that I wasn't expecting. Medium to light body with a moderate level of carbonation and a watery spritz y mouthfeel. Decent beer, really nothing special but probably the best GF beer I've tried. I rated this a bit higher just for the gluten free factor, If I were gluten intolerant I would probably get used to this."
""
"O: To be fair, the Light Lager style does not allow brewers to make a truly great beer. That being said, this one succeeds in making a beer true to the style, but doesn't do anything more than that. Kind of a misfire."
"For a light, gluten-free lager I applaud the result. By all appearances it is a superior product to most other light lagers, but it still doesn't make me want another one."
"O- Good by light lager standards. Clean with decent flavors."
"I didn't buy this because it's gluten free, in fact I didn't know until I came to do this review, so they truly accomplished a normal beer without gluten. Poured only an 1/8"" inch white head which didn't last long. The body is a clear straw yellow with very little effervescence. Smells of malt and grass. The taste mirrors the smell yet I'd say it's richer and creamier than mainstream lagers. Short finish but fairly long aftertaste. Better than I'd have expected."
"This has a lot of the signature gluten free characteristics. It's sweet and a bit fruity with a very little if any hop character. It's also a bit thin and very light bodied. I'll pass on this one in the future."
""
""
"Pours a nice clean/clear pale yellow color, nice carbonation, with a decent little fizzy white head, which leaves some minimal sticky lacing behind. The nose is malty, kinda sweet, with some caramel notes. The taste is slightly sweet, malty. More on the light body side, but still pretty nice. Overall not a bad brew, but would not buy again."
""
""
"O- Nice summer thirst quencher but not much more, the 4.6% ABV makes is sessionable but I didn't find it interesting enough to do so."
"Pours a clear light golden with a thin white head. A bit of retention, and decent lace. Nose is of grainy malts.Nice but weak. Body is light and carbonated. Taste is grainy up front with a bittersweet finish. Crisp, and refreshing. Decent Summer session beer."
"A quite easy beer to forget, very similar to any number of light American lager beers."
""
"O/D-Probably the best Gluten free brew I have had. Can stand up to most Light Lagers without a problem. Good job by Widmer."
"Overall not bad, light overall but quite drinkable and thirst quenching. Nice malt-like flavors although lighter and not quite the same as if they used real malts, hops are practically non existent, but nice lagering as well. So pretty decent for a gluten free beer, or possible just because I was so thirsty and it was so hot."
"Overall: Very tasty light lager gluten free beer. You wouldn't expect it, but a keeper in my minds. Happy to have gotten this after volunteering at the ACBF and good to find out that it is made by Widmer."
"I think they omitted much more than just the gluten here. It isn't nearly offensive but hardly brings any flavor or interest to the table."
""
"Overall for a beer this is average with no faults or off flavors. For a Gluten Free beer this is the best one I have ever tasted."

"- I am astounded that this is gluten-free. Yet it is still a stand-out lager in the craft world. You could hand this beer to someone, and never mention the fact that it is gluten-free... and I bet they would still thoroughly enjoy it more so than any canned macro on the market. Kudos to Widmer. I hope they continue to stay on this awesome path they have paved."
