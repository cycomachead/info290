A decent amount of sticky lacing is seen which is surprising. The aroma is hard to describe actually. Mostly of grains with maybe a hint of spice(?). The taste is pretty much like a lager would be but better than a Bud or other similar brews. Goes down easy with no bitterness. Lighter to medium bodied with good carbonation, hence all the bubbles rising from the bottom of the glass after the pour. Overall it wasn't that bad actually.","BeerWithMike","Feb 05, 2015"

I like how this brew has flavor and it goes down smooth.  The mouthfeel is n ice also.  Overall I'm giving this brew a 4.25 out of 5. I will get this brew again.","nicholas2121","Sep 04, 2014"

Very nice medium body for a lager with a touch of creamy texture. Above average carbonation level that imparts a nice effervescent finish. The flavor profile is well balanced and also clean and crisp. It begins with a light biscuit sweetness that flows into a crisp effervescent light bitterness. Behind the bitterness is a light tropical tartness from the hops. The finish is crisp and effervesces into a slight dryness.","tillmac62","Jul 25, 2014"

3.25,-3.6,3.75,3,3.25,3.5,3.25,"Overall I thought this was a decent beer and a pretty close to average example of the style, it was very true to style and it had pretty much all the aspects that I would expect from a Lager, but it still was a little bland and it felt like it was missing a little bit of something. This beer had nice drinkability, it was smooth, clean, pretty crisp, a little refreshing, not filling and the taste didn't do the best job at holding my attention, I could probably drink more than a few of these, but I think the taste would start to loose my interest so one or two would be enough for me. What I like the most about this beer was the appearance and mouthfeel. to me those were the highlights of this beer and I thought they were both pretty true to style. What I liked the least about this beer was the aroma, it seemed just a little blander than the taste and I felt it was lacking something, but I don't know what that is. I don't think I would buy this beer again, there's a few Lagers that I enjoy much more than this one and I can't say I would recommend it unless your big a Lager fan. All in all I wasn't a big fan of this beer, it wasn't a bad beer by any means and it didn't have any off flavors or off aspects, but it fell pretty much right in the middle in every aspect and it wasn't too memorable. This isn't my favorite Lager and Big Wave Golden Ale is still my favorite beer from Kona, but I don't see how this Island Lager is any different from any other Lager. I appreciate the attempt but this one could use just a little bit of work, better luck next time guys.","StoutHunter","Apr 23, 2014"

Hints of flaky biscuit in the nose and a subtle noble hop presence. Taste is surprisingly smooth. It's creamy and just rolls over the palate seemingly forever and without end. A touch of herbal and hop bitterness takes this one to the finish almost dry. The biscuit is doughy and the grains start to stand out on the palate toward the end. The carbonation is ample but it does not disturb the creamy smoothness of this beer. Overall I would call it earthy and a good and tasty lager. Mild overall and with a just enough hops to keep it interesting. My only criticism is that it's a bit too soft for a lager. The doughy quality starts as smoothness but then drinks a bit heavier towards the end of the glass. It had some kind of sweetness like almonds in the very last moments after it warmed.","utopiajane","Apr 10, 2014"

Pours slightly hazy very pale straw color with a 1 finger dense white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of lemon, pear, apple, white grape, bready grain, light honey, floral, herbal, grass, light pepper, and yeast earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance of hop, malt, and yeast ester notes; with solid strength. Taste of lemon, pear, apple, white grape, bready grain, light honey, grass, herbal, light pepper, and yeast earthiness. Light grainy tartness on the finish; with lingering notes of lemon, pear, apple, white grape, bready grain, light honey, herbal, grass, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a bit. Nice balance of malt, hop, and yeast ester flavors; with solid robustness and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and light-medium bodied; with a very smooth and crisp mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish as expected of 4.6%. Overall this is a good pale lager. Good balance and solid robustness of malt, hop, and yeast ester flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A pleasantly enjoyable offering.","superspak","Mar 02, 2014"

The nose was classic American adjuncts with a twist; corn and rice aromas with an earthy, minerally odor. Taste was more of a European that American lager taste; the clean dry bitterness of a Stella, mixed with an earthy, tea-like astringency that left a puckering sensation on my mouth. Somewhat unpleasant. Medium thin mouthfeel with a high carbonation level. A unique and interesting lager due to the earthiness in the flavor profile, but the mouth drying astringency is a major flaw that keeps me from reaching for more.","Aaron_Ramson","Aug 24, 2013"

It's nothing if not simple, but its bready malt character is quite pleasant. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with lively carbonation, and a smooth texture. Overall, this is a decent beer.

More flavor than u would expect as this beer is heavier on the hops than your standard lager. Otherwise clean and crisp with just a hint of a bitter lingering finish.

I got an initial splash of foam, then it fizzed and refused to behave before finally calming down for the Glug. Oddy, I only produced a finger of bone-white head and even that was limited in its retention. A CANflicted beer! Color was liquid sunshine in the glass and with its NE-quality clarity, I wished that the sun were still shining as brightly as it had all day for comparison's sake. Nose smelled like lager, real lager, unadulterated, without corn or other adjuncts that have worn me thin. I may be in love! CAN I marry a beer? Oh, that's right - I CAN only rent them for short periods at a time. Mouthfeel was light, not downright thin, but kind of unobtrusive. It tasted like lager! It had a lightly sweet maltiness along with a mildly grassy hops presence on the tongue. It was super smooth and I had drank off easily half of the CANtents before I was even aware of how quickly it was going. Finish was semi-dry and I am marking it as a definite CANdidate for my beach cooler.","woodychandler","Jun 23, 2012"

At a bar in an airport I ordered a Boulevard Ale, and for sure it was a wheat beer, probably the Leinenkugles they had on tap as well. So I passed on that beer review due to the uncertainty of what I was drinking. Back to the Longboard Lager. In the glass it has a straw yellow color with a faint cloudiness. The head is thin and pure white. Looking at this lager, I was thinking it sure looks like a wheat beer. The aroma added more fuel to that fire, as did the taste. Subtle sweetness and the hint of lemon and fruit that has me thinking it’s a wheat beer. I got the same result from the three remaining bottles I had. So could it be a bottling mistake? I cannot say. But to finish the review of what was in the bottles I sampled, I liked this light sweet beer, but is it a lager? Certainly not like any I have sampled to date.","iSip","Nov 09, 2011"

This would be a great beer to slowly ease a friend into craft beer. Taste is crisp with a emphasis on some hops. Body is light and carbonation is medium/high.

There is little aroma, at least served cold from the tap. I had this at a fairly random bar and would have chalked some of the flavor problems up to freshness, but I saw other people ordering it and there was a weekly happy hour special on it (actually, I guess that could go either way on what it says about the keg's freshness. At any rate, it's certainly a lager. I kept writing boring after taking notes on this beer. There are certainly better lagers out there, and there are definitely worse ones.

It pours a nice light/straw brown and has the aroma of malt with little hops. Has a nice head but died quickly with little lace. It tastes like your average lager, couldn't really pick up on any different flavors. But I guess when you brew in Hawai'i you don't get much of a selection for exotic ingredients besides fruit. Worth the extra price for a one time shot.","VaTechHopHead","Nov 14, 2008"

The taste is of grassy grains, touch of honey, wheat malt characteristics which gives it that subtle spice, a touch bready. The feel is light to moderate with nice tingly carbonation, finishes very balanced and neutral. A very light all malt lager that is quite refreshing.

Although predominant with barley there is a kinda yeasty, bready, faint cream flavor that sticks around making it not as watery as other lagers. Light hints of sweet fruit and maybe some spice. It was matched by an interesting yet quite subdued slightly spicy hop profile that I could not pinpoint (wasn't too pronounced). A summery beer and a decent american lager. Gave it an average appearance because I couldn't pour it at the bar.

Our server said she preferred dark beers, but liked Long Board, so I decided I'd give it a try. As a porter/stout/ale drinker I thought I might have found a robust lager. Well, robust and full-bodied as it was, KLB didn't impress me too much. As lagers go, the appearance was very average, except for a tantilizingly deep amber hue. The color might be as good as stop-sign-red to most lager drinkers... "be advised, this is no average lager." Smell left something to be desired: a sharp, sour note with a nut edge. Taste was full-bodied but not gritty, starting sharp and a little sweet, settling on the tongue with an almost caramel or coffee flavor, finished bitter and pungant way that reminded me of a porter without the chocolate trailer or coffee aftertaste. If I had to describe this beer in a word, I think I'd use "flavorful." Aftertaste was present but not long-lasting... a mix of bitter undertone with that nutty dryness that seems fairly common in micro- or locally brewed dark lagers.

The flavor itself is very similar to any number of cheap adjunct lagers. The absence of all metallic flavors and a light gummy hop quality are the only evidence that this was craft-brewed (by Widmer, I believe). It's a standard lager, subpar for Oregon (it's worse than Henry's), and not worth the craft beer price (over a buck a bottle at the supermarket). The sticking points for me are a raw corn-husk grainy quality that is not at all integrated into the beer, and a too-long aftertaste that resembles slightly spoiled vegetables. The flavor profile is dominated by a repellent brackish quality. The mouthfeel is okay, but not soft enough to resemble a really good lager. I will not buy this again.

Slightly hoppy smell and taste which was quickly replaced by the heavily carbonated mouthfeel. This sensation remained throughout the quaffing. Pleasantly surprised by this lager as I generally prefer darker brews.","WTexas","Nov 13, 2004"

Started off somewhat sweet but was balanced well in the end with the dry hop finish. It had a reasonably full feel to it, not watery at all. This is a surprisingly good lager, very drinkable.","arizcards","Oct 10, 2004"

2.95,-12.5,3,3,3,2.5,3,"A nice gift from BA Uncle Jimbo. My bottle was packaged on Mar2504. Classic American Lager, eh? You know, maybe so. I have some chill haze, but what I am getting color wise is spun straw all the way. The head went, er, somewhere fast, just left me a layer on top. Aroma is interesting, I am getting sort of green apples meets bread set aside to rise. Mouthfeel is actually rather thick, interesting change, but maybe a bit much. I'm getting more green apples from the taste. Finish is a little off, maybe wants to go metal but not quite. The beer isn't bad, but the finish is still kinda funky somehow, and the thick mouthfeel brings down the drinkability. Even so, thank you Jim, I am glad I was able to try this.","PatandDavid","Jul 16, 2004"
3.38,0.3,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"This lager poured a hazy, yellow color with a nice, creamy, very white foam which unfortunately settled very quickly and dissipated. The smell was modest: light malt with a hint of sweetness. The taste was decent enough, but light: lightly malty with some grain notes and with moderate hoppiness in the finish. There was also a bit of floral hop flavor as the beer warmed. The mouthfeel was smooth and dry with medium-light body and low carbonation. The flavors lingered lightly, but overall it was fairly clean. This was a decent lager, and was easy to drink.","UncleJimbo","Jul 09, 2004"
2.77,-17.8,2,2.5,3,2.5,3,"Wasn't impressed by this lager, pours a golden yellow with no head to speak of, only a dissapointing fizzle. Smell is of light roasted apples and grain. A light sweet malts lingers almost unoticed. Taste is sticky with molasses and fruitness. Has a light malt blast that makes it medium bodied for a lager. Average at best, I can't really every see myself sitting down to a nice meal with this again.","beertaster13","Jun 21, 2004"
3.67,8.9,3.5,4,4,3,3,"Piney hops on a hugely malty honey sweet flavor, this is almost bock-like in its maltiness. Relatively thick beer (too sweet and thick for my tastes).

3.9,15.7,3,3,4,4,5,"Pours a yellow straw hue with a strong but short lived white head that leaves moderate lacing. The nose is dominated by Autumn fruits, apples and pears chief among them. A strong, biscuity sweetness underlies it all, and some grassy hops make their presence known too. The taste is endearing. Sweet frutiness is represented up front before reaching a crescendo of grainy wholesomness. This one has a dry, green, hoppy finish that is quite satisfying. Mouthfeel is thin for my taste, but fine for the style. They didn't overdo the carbonation. Drinkability is strong.","MobBarley","Mar 09, 2004"

The nose prototypical lager malt, crisp and fresh, a pleasing malt rich and sweet start, the middle is moderate in its feel. Finish is mildly acidic, the hops present and apropos to the style with the aftertaste dry and sweet, a drinkable but unremarkable lager, I guess just plain old as expected!","Gusler","Oct 24, 2003"

The first sip is obviously malty with equally evident caramel flavor quickly interrupted by a mild bitterness that immediately gives way to and increasing returning lingering malt. Quite complex and enjoyable.","beernut7","May 19, 2003"

3.85,14.2,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"The slightly hazy golden body is capped by a bright-white head of creamy foam that holds OK before dropping to a decent collar and whispy surface covering. The nose expresses a dry, grainy malt with some mild earthy and leafy hop notes. The body is firmly medium with a fine carbonation that leaves it gently crisp and then lightly creamy in the mouth. The flavor is surprisingly rich for the style, and loaded with dextrinous maltiness. Some spicy, grassy, and floral hop flavor comes into play and gives it a bit of a honeysuckle flavor when wrapped in its lightly sweet malt; and there's a solid bitterness (@24 BU's) to balance it and lead to a dry and spicy finish! Definitely more than I expected... a true "hand-crafted" brew! It's light enough to enjoy as a "lawnmower beer", but with enough character to make you think "I'll have another"!","NeroFiddled","Jan 26, 2003"
