4.5,5.6,,,,,,"A great beer, indeed. Pours with a nice, foamy head. The aroma is not too strong, that of hops and fruit (lemons), maybe a slight malt kick. The taste is just an absolutely perfect example of a smooth, hoppy pale ale that hits all the right notes and strongly resembles the nose. Hops on the initial impact, and a nice citrus finish. The malt is present, but the 6.7%ABV certainly is not. This is the kind of thing that can open a mindless sud-water drinker to a world of well balanced, fantastic craft alternatives. Nothing too crazy, a good beer for almost any situation.","ZebraCakez","Nov 30, 2014"

I'd like to see Jack's Abby be able to preserve the lager subtleties but add solid hop flavor in a low ABV offering, such as a traditional south-west German Pils or other hoppier-than-usual lager styles. However, for now, if I want a hoppy beer that's crisper than an ale, I'll gladly reach for a sixer of this stuff. Would highly recommend.","Beric","Oct 21, 2014"

Hoppy for sure, but nothing compared to heady west coast style IPA I grew accustomed to in Denver.  The flavor was another story.  The malt starts things off pretty mildly, with predictable toasty sweetness, but hops quickly take over.  Body is there, as is a gentle carbonation level.  I feel like I'd be more comfortable with a blast of soapy pilsy or grassy german hops, but the american hops coupled with lagered malt cleanliness is unique and singular to this beer. It is unusual and not unenjoyable, especially after years of ""moar hopz"" west coast beers.  Think of a fresh bottle of Urquell poured half and half with a Smuttynose IPA.  Bizarre but delicious.  It's really good, but I'd still opt for SNPA or Bells Two Hearted Ale since they're easier to get and world class outstanding beers.  If I saw this one in the same cooler, I'd definitely grab it for a change of pace, but I fail to see it as anything really out of the ordinary in terms of flavor.","UnionMade","Aug 21, 2014"

Hoponius Union has a nice bite at the beginning, but mellows out with subtle sweet flavors resembling grapefruit mixed with almost a nutmeg richness. It's easy to drink 2-3 of these at a sitting. A nice substantial taste, but not overly filling. One of my favorite beers of all time.","RLBeauregard","Jul 28, 2014"

4.04,-5.2,3.75,4,4.25,3.5,4,"I made a solemn promise to The Old Lady last summer that if a beer in any way indicates that it is bottle-conditioned, I would treat it as gently as I would her. The fact that she would beat my ass within an inch of my life if I ever mistreated her notwithstanding, I went with a VERY gentle pour. I have said before, she is as tough as nails, which is part of the attraction for me. I got a brief skim of bone-white head across the top of the beer before it faded into mere wisps. Color was a sunshine-yellow (SRM = 4) with just the faintest of haze visible in the glass. I promise you, I was extremely gentle, but there may have been something in suspension. Nose smelled deeply of citrus-grapefruit rind hops. Wow! As a lifelong Pennsylvanian, I know the difficulty behind making a Lager and to make one that comes off with this level of hoppiness is just amazing. Mouthfeel was thin-to-medium. The taste was all hops and for a hophead, that was just fine by me. I cannot say that I would have identified it as a lager of any stripe, but perhaps that is part of the mystique. I do know that the light, spritzy mouthfeel made it very easy to drink on a Summer day, where an AIPA might have been more to handle. The finish was extremely dry and I really had a tough time believing that this was a lager. I had put the remainder of what was left in the bottle back in the reefer to settle and when I went to pour some more into the glass, I noticed that the haze had cleared! Impressive. Warming, I got some of the honey notes that I always think of as characteristic of well-made lagers, but the hops continued to carry the day.","woodychandler","Jul 24, 2014"

4.25,-0.2,,,,,,"The beer pours a nice white and foamy head that dissipates quickly. The head is white. The beer itself is a clear orange with some brown notes. The beer smell has a strong hoppy smell with malt sweetness taking the edge off of some of it. The hops are a nice orange citrus, which mixes well with the bready sweetness from the malts. The beer taste is similar to the smell with a strong hoppy note but very little of the malt present in the smell. The hop still a strong citrus taste to it. The mouthfeel is fairly smooth to the point where it is slightly creamy.Carbonation. Medium bodied but still fels light. Overall, a very good lager and worth getting. I enjoyed greatly and most definitely lives up to the hype.","HattedClassic","Jul 12, 2014"

Citrus hops feature prominently aromatically, like and IPA, but the lager yeast is noticed, veiled, and just behind. Tastes of citrus, lemon peel and grain. The hoppiness is subdued, as if it was stopped in mid-sentence while trying to make a very brilliant point. Mouth-feel is medium and the body is crisp with a bit of heat in the finish. While this one is pretty damn tasty, I'm left ambivalent, wondering if I would rather just have one or the other.","stephens101","Jul 07, 2014"

Aroma was very light, notes of herbal hops, and biscuity malt sweetness. The taste was mostly sweet up front, biscuity malts, toffee, fruit punch, giving way to toasted grains, and a lightly bitter, herbal hop finish. Light-medium body, moderate carbonation, pretty easily drinkable. Overall decent, especially for a lager, but still probably not something I'd go for again.","Rifugium","Apr 03, 2014"
4.29,0.7,4.25,4.5,4.25,4,4.25,"Just another great beer from Jack's Abbey. Aroma starts off with a big burst of citrus and slight caramel malt presence. The taste starts off with a bright citrus flavor, but then transitions to a more pungent tropical fruit taste such as mango most notably. Not alot of bitterness on this at all, and sweet caramel malt rounds things out. The  drinkability and taste is superior to the slew of session ipas that have come out recently. This is a must try beer and as a full strength IPL I personally feel this is a much better alternative to most session ipas. (93/100)","CTbrew32","Apr 02, 2014"

Smells strongly of citrussy hops- orangey, floraly and mildly piney notes- west coast inspired I assume. Defiantly pick up on the yeasty lager components here. Citrus hops hit first while the piney notes come in the background, not an overly bitter hop profile and finishes with a clean and refreshing lager characteristic. Mild alcohol presence, carbonation is on point and an overall very clean IPL. On the whole this is a very well crafted IPL that certainly makes me want to come back for more.","80x2HopHead","Mar 19, 2014"

Glorious resiny hops with slices of fresh fruit in the aroma. Flavor is geared more to the fruit side of hops, juicy and has a mineral flavor in the back. Bitterness is sustained yet present.

Of course, I'm a bit of a hop addict, so my opinion is skewed, but I think I'm being fair when I say that this doesn't lose sight of the fact that it is not an IPA. It retains the bready, crisp characteristics that you expect from the style. From what I've heard, these guys know their way around lagering, and based on this first example, I'm inclined to agree.","LambicPentameter","Jan 12, 2014"

A mild pine sap bitterness is present as well. The mid-palate brings out the hop flavor, the blend of floral citrus and a little bit of grass. Malt character is minimal, with just a little bit of a burnt sugar/ toffee/honey sweetness present, pairing really well with the citrus hops. With the classic lager smoothness/slickness on the palate, this beer is ridiculously clean and has a nice, biting bitterness on the finish. Medium-light in body with moderate carbonation, this beer is excellent on the palate. Very highly recommended.

Aggressively hopped and quite bitter with a solid lager base. The lager base is my favorite part of this beer. Very well made with a great mouthfeel. The hopping is a bit too aggressively west coast for my taste. It is certainly interesting with the lager body though. Worth a try for west coast IPA fans indeed.","PHBoiler","Nov 04, 2013"

Aroma is all about hops - floral, citrus, pine, some grassiness - a very nice smelling beer. Taste follows nose, bitter throughout but nicely balanced by sweet malt backbone. A very quaffable beer. Smooth, with a light-medium body and effervescent carbonation. Overall a well crafted lager. I've only had one other IPL, that from Boston Beer Company, and I do like the style!

It pretty much drinks like an IPA. It's just a bit cleaner for better and worse. The hops start with sweet floral and citrus flavors but get a bit bland in the finish.

The nose is clean with a pleasantly bright hop fruitiness that's dripping with tangerine, mango, passion fruit, and orange redolence. Warming brings out herbal and floral character with a touch of spiciness. Malt presents no sweetness and brings to mind saltine cracker and maybe a touch of biscuit. The flavor catches your attention immediately with a firm but gentle bitterness that's accompanied by orange pith and flesh, grapefruit, herbal and floral notes, and a light mango presence. There's less hop fruitiness in the flavor than in the nose, with the herbal and citrus pith being more dominant. The finish is clean, bitter, and quite dry, with a hint of alcohol. Excellent stuff.

Taste is of fruity citrusy hops, grapefruit and orange, fishihes with a bit of crisp larger malt, bitterness throughout and felt in the cheeks, heavily hopped. Lightly carbonated, medium feel and oily on the back of the pallate. An incredible lager here, would gladly revisit this again, great drinkability.","peensteen","Jul 31, 2013"

There isn't much that I would consider ""delicate"" about this beer, and so any of the qualities I would be looking for in a pale lager are essentially hidden.

Aroma was malty, earthy, some yeast, citrus fruit, a slight but of pine resin. The citrus aroma reminds me of lemon lime hard candies. Get the malts immediately on he sip, then a huge blast of citrus more grapefruit than the nose suggested. Earthy underneath, nice hit of bitterness, not overwhelming. Tiny bit of breadiness or yeast, slightly toasty. Flavor hits and passes quickly, and grapefruit and maybe mango linger just a bit. Very clean and refreshing, light on the palate. Finishes dry and makes you want more. The carbonation is light and refreshing. Very drinkable and can see this on a hot summer day. Subtle, complex enough to be interesting, well balanced.

Poured a pale golden yellow with a half finger white head that subsided to a minimal amount quickly. Maintained excellent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, earth, earth hop, marijuana, fruit hop, and pine resin. The flavor was of sweet malt, earth, marijuana, pine, pine resin, earth hop, and spicy hop. It had a light feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this was a good brew. There were quite a few different components going on in both the nose and flavor of this one that really kept me on my toes. With having a few brews from this brewery that night I can honestly say that they have aromas pinned down. With just a little more robustness this could definitely be a standout for the style. I suggest you get your hands on some of these or other brews from them if you get the chance. You won’t regret it.","thagr81us","Dec 31, 2012"

I’m not trying to badmouth lagers; it’s just that ales tend to have more complex flavor arrangements than lagers. Not so with Jack’s Abby. A major plus with these beers is that they still have the nice clean, refreshing feel of a lager with the vast range of flavors of an ale.

Very hoppy with notes of cracker underneath. The taste starts with a touch of malty graininess followed by a touch of sweetness. Then comes a wave of hoppy bitterness in the form of grass and pine. It finishes off with more cracker and bread notes. Very nice range of flavors here with good balance. Mouthfeel is moderate with appropriate carbonation. Overall, this is a lager I could get in to.

4.39,3.1,3.5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"The beer pours a beautiful and lagery yellow with slight amber and golding, while appearing very clean in the body with a huge rocky white head that appears creamy and soft on top and leaves sticky patches of splattering lacing on the sides of the glass. Carbonation is steady but not torrential, and this beer looks nice and clean with the just the slightest hint of haze appearing in the beer. On the nose, this beer is everything you would want it to be; big and resiny, with a smell that just begs for the nose to be shoved in it. Sticky pine melds with faint lemon citrus, mango, passion fruit, big grassy notes, and a faint light hint of sweet biscuit bread. The beer has a great smell, and is probably the best lager I have ever smelled. On the taste, the beer is superb. It begins surprisingly malty with grassy and cereal notes before opening into biscuity malts and then big bitter hits and snuggles into the cavities of your mouth. Grass is huge in the hop flavor, providing perfect balance to creamy malts which linger in the sides of your mouth, even as the bitter bites. Pine and citrus also are present in the hops and provide lovely flavors reminiscent of a West Coast IPA. The mouthfeel is clean and slightly crisp with just the right amount of bitters to kiss the tongue even as the beer takes on a creamy feel as it caresses your mouth. The mouth is left dry and bitter on the roof of the mouth and on the tongue while slight trickles of saliva run on along the sides of the mouth. Overall, this beer is superb. A new style perfectly created. I have been hearing so many calls for an India Pale Lager from so many people in the craft beer world that I just figured it wasn’t doable, and yet here Hoponius Union sits as just that. IPA lovers should try this beer, lager lovers should try this beer, and everyone should try this beer! It is superb, and represents the perfect union and balance between hops, malts, and the clean-beer-feel that lager yeast creates. Just like this country is the perfect union of all that other stuff! Try this beer!","Maxwell","Nov 06, 2012"

I don’t think I’ve enjoyed a lager this much since I was about seven deep during my sophomore year, and that was for entirely different reasons. It brings the hops in a very clear, balanced way: it’s not BLINDINGLY bitter, but has plenty of hop strength and character, enough to give lots of hop bombs a run for their money, flavor-wise. And the composition of the hop profile is excellent. As for the malt, it’s very well-done and balanced just right—bready, crackery, not sweet by any means, but solid and well-defined. And finally, it’s clearly a lager—a fantastic one. That fact that you can get 4-packs of 0.5l bottles of this for about $11 is almost criminal. If you see it, buy it and drink as soon as you can. Damn.","fmccormi","Oct 14, 2012"

4.17,-2.1,4,4.5,4,4.5,4,"From the chilled bottle into the big tumbler I see a clear, golden light amber colored lager with a decent but broken fluffy white head with healthy lacing. The aroma makes itself known quickly from a distance with a decidedly tart citrus hop and biscuit base. Very impressive and unlike any lager I've had the pleasure of knowing before (other than this same brew on tap). The flavor is such a pleasure with more of the same biscuit and citrus hop blend and maybe some rye grain and light grass ideas. It's peppery, tart and clean with a light but lively carbonation that offers an effervescent feel over a medium body. More grass and grapefruit lemon pours over the tongue with quite some bite, especially unheard of for a lager but as the label explains, this is simply a lagered IPA and the unique flavors are definitely successful and worth a try.","Durge","Aug 29, 2012"
4.08,-4.2,4.5,4,4,4.5,4,"Pours a dark yellow with a frothy white head that sticks around for awhile. The smell is dominated by the hops, subtle citrus in there as well. The flavor starts slightly bitter up front with huge hops following. The flavor finishes bitter and sticks around through the aftertaste. A solid flavor that doesn't have many complexities and doesn't change much. A nice medium mouthfeel, almost heavy, like chewing on hops. This is a solid IPA, definitely like sucking on some hops. There isn't much more to this beer than that, but that is ok because it is done well.","wingman14","Aug 28, 2012"
4.3,0.9,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,"Palate: This could easily be mistaken for an IPA, albeit an unusually clean and light one. Bitterness is mild, but there are big hop flavors. It leans toward the floral side of things (centennial?), with a touch of citrus and stone fruit. There's a touch of coarse grain flavor, though it's a very dry, very hop forward beer overall. Within the IPL style, I'd say this is a notch below Humulus Lager, and probably Fathom as well, but it's a delicious beer nonetheless and I'd drink it often were it local.","largadeer","Aug 27, 2012"

Smell is a nice mix of citrus hops combined with a more traditional lager aroma - very interesting, but doesn't stand out. The flavor, however, is a different story. The blend of hops here is absolutely incredible, and the lager base really supports it so much better than I could have expected. It's a great citrus hops flavor, and I would never know it's a lager flavor-wise, as it tastes more like something along the lines of Zombie Dust. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied with nice carbonation. Overall, this beer is incredibly impressive, quite unlike anything I've ever had before. The best hoppy lager I've had.","starrdogg","Jun 06, 2012"

Aromas of resiny hops, with basil and hemp characteristics, as well as a slight peppering. Flavors are hop forward, with that heavy pepper/basil combo blasting the tastebuds. Light toasted backbone supports the hops presence, and the beer is light bodied and smooth in mouth. Great cling along the glass as you go. The aftertaste is light and bitter, with a slight floral highlight. Resiny, bitter finish, with the clean feel typical of a lager. Very tasty.","GarthDanielson","May 25, 2012"

4.32,1.4,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"O- This was definitely an interesting brew. A mix between a lager and an IPA. On the bottle label they say that they use lager yeast fermentation while the beer is cold and then age it with west coast IPA hops for extended periods of time. This definitely creates an unique flavor that is a mix in taste between your typical lager and a west Coast IPA. It smells just like your typical West Coast IPA and has the citrusy taste but also has the typical lager taste. At first I wasn't sure if I was too excited by the taste of this beer since it was a little bit different then I was expecting it to be, but it definitely grew on me and by the end I really enjoyed it. I would definitely recommend giving this beer a try and I'm sure you will enjoy it.","jaasen64","May 04, 2012"

I doubt many people would think it was a lager if they didn't know. It came out pretty rad.
