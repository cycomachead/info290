"Poured from the bomber into a pilsener glass. A golden yellow lager with creamy white head, somewhat milkshake-like, with a pleasantly assertive hop-forward aroma. Nose is floral, tropical, and somewhat spicy, with a subtle backdrop of bread-like malts. The tropical fruit (pineapple, guava, lychee) sweetness builds nicely and this is certainly a brew to enjoy on the aroma basis. On the palate, there is a delicate but flavorsome honeyed breakfast cereal and light molasses malt background propping up more tropical fruit and pine flavors, along with gooseberry, white grape, mustard salad green, melon, canned peach, and faint citrus rind. Finishes rather bitter and medicinal, with a little grain husk ... Dry! I am always a tad surprised by the combination of a fairly thin body, heavy carbonation, and assertive hop flavors that is unique to an ""India Pale Lager"". One keeps expecting to taste sweeter malts, more body, and more esters, and instead one gets naked, rather delicate hop flavor, some cereal grain, and a residual sweetness that you just can't quite grasp. This one showcases a solid array of different hop aromas and flavors, relatively unencumbered by the malts. I can dig it, not as a replacement for the usual but as a nice change of pace."

"A clean, hop forward, malt restrained IPA. The bre is a moderate golden color with a thick, lasting, beautiful white head. The smel is soft, rounded, and a bit hoppy. Some distant malt and grain, but it is a lot less interesting than I expected. The brew makes yo for it in the taste, however, which is huge with hop flavor and bitterness....herbal, leafy, fresh, biter, and spicy. Nice. Full, satisfying mouthfeel. Highly drinkable."

"Mouthfeel is again very clean and crisp from the lagering. The hops do have a slight pinch of astringency by my molars and there is a lovely dryness to this beverage. I like the simple and direct flavors but wish this beer had more of a hop punch. Still a fine brew and worth drinking if you come across it."

"Overall: An interesting beer and I appreciate the lager yeast variation but this beer just didn't do it for me."

"Poured out in a snifter, I know not the recommended glass but I felt like rebelling tonight, this beer has a nice semi-hazy and golden body, moderate carbonation and is topped off with a nice thick and creamy head with some mild lacing. The aroma is a bit light, but the hops a present and smelling inviting. Mild apple and orange come through along with a mixture of citrus fruits. At first taste it crisp, slightly creamy and the hops are the first flavor you taste. Grapefruit and orange zest come in next and then the malts kick in. This one feels more like a lager at first but then quickly changes into a nice mild IPA. The aftertaste is all IPA, the hops are strong and the alcohol is barley tasted, but none of the flavors overpowering. Overall this is a pretty good beer and I look forward to trying their others."

"Pours a hazy, copper color. 1/3 inch head of an off-white color. Great retention and great lacing. Smells of pine, sweet malt, slight caramel malt, hops, slight floral, and a hint of sugar. Fits the style of an American Pale Lager. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of floral hops, pine, sweet malt, caramel malt, hint of citrus hops, and a hint of grass. Overall, good appearance, complexity, and blend."
"This works pretty well, the flavour could be a bit more interesting and less rough in terms of mouthfeel (particularly toward the end) but it is a really pleasant enjoyable beer, quite drinkable. In some ways it waffles back and forth between being an IPA or lager and this indecision shows at times. Could be better, but still not bad."
""

"Within the style, this one is a real standout, and a quality beer. Within any style, it's a real standout, and a high quality beer! Highly recommended."

"Over all I didnt enjoy this beer , Its drinkable , I know its supposed to be an IPA Style Lager , but it just didnt hit the mark for me"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The fruity hop character of citrus up front, is quickly sweetened by a good dose of caramel lay malt flavors. Some more bitter hops at the finish. Over all a medium to light bodied beer. I am not sure if it fits the beer style exactly. I wish there would have been more carbonation while drinking this beer. It was quite syrup like."
""
""
""
"While I'm not a hoppy beer fan, I think this beer is a decent brew. Easy drinking, nice mouthfeel, good creamy taste. A pretty good beer for a barbecue or other such occasion. As a character said in ""Fargo," ""you could do a lot worse."" This isn't the Radisson, but it's a pretty ok beer, there. Oh yeah? Geez."

"Drinkability: Decent mild IPA but won't be one I seek out. Came as part of a variety pack, but usually only available as a 22 ounce around here."
""
"Medium golden with a thinnish head that doesn't leave any lace. Smell is grainy, malt, musty, faint leafy-citric hop. Taste is much more bitter than the nose suggested. There is a washing of citric, grassy hop, mild bitterness lingers with underlying pale malts, bread, earth. Citric-pith flavor lingers on the taste buds with a dry finish on a medium soft body with ample carbonation. I can certainly see why they call this an IPA style lager."

"This is interesting, and it's good. But I don't know that they should be putting ""IPA Style"" on the label. It may be generously hopped for a lager, but folks thinking they're getting a legit IPA may be disappointed. That said, I don't drink lagers much, and often the ones I do drink are ones like doppelbocks, so not really what people think of as lagers. It isn't that often that thinner ""lawn mower"" beers appeal to me. And Sword Swallower may not be lawn mower beer, but it is a lager and I like it. I guess that is because it has way more flavor, depth and character than most lagers. I like the idea, and the execution is pretty good, though there are some rough edges that could be smoothed out. I'll probably have it again."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a unique take on an IPA and a lager and it is pulled off fairly well. Malt and hops could be a little bit smoother but this is something I would consider picking up again."
"O: Not bad. I like it but don't love it. Brings something new (for me) to the table in its style."
"This IPA style brew doesn’t have the excessive citrus character common to American IPA, but I like what it does offer and it is certainly a beer that catches the eye. The artwork on the bottle, the name, and the variation on the style grab your attention and the beer itself doesn’t disappoint. It may not be a true IPA beer, but it easily beats the majority of American lagers in overall taste."

"I gotta say, for the style, this is pretty good. A hop head would not pour it out...unless said hop head was a d-bag and just too pretentious to imbibe a lager. Nice job on this one Shmaltz!"

"The beer pours a golden color with a white head. The aroma has quite a bit of pine and orange citrus in it, as well as some biscuit malt. The flavor is fairly similar, with some pine and orange, with a light bit of resin thrown in. The bitterness is low because the biscuit malt adds a touch of sweetness to balance things out. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. This tastes about like an IPA, as expected from reading the label."

"In terms of it being a pale lager, it is very good and I did enjoy it."
"Pours a clouded amber golden hue with a large off white head fine speckled lacing forms thick. Aroma has some harsh metallic hops and sharp citrus/lime notes. Sweet pale malt background, fruity highlights seems interesting. A lager that drinks like an IPA, hoppy delicious bitterness amongst pale balancing malts, excellent concept I burp up fruity hop notes this stuff could be really drinkable. Honey coated palte malts with earthy grapefruit rind bitterness, mouthfeel has a nice carbonation with medium bodied slick hop oils. Drinkablity overall was nice a beer I ccould see drinking on a regular basis, I didn't feel that way about most of the Coney Island sampler pack."
""
"Interesting brew with a unique profile yet restrained enough to be session-able."
""
"I guess I don't know how the lager yeast affects the flavor, but it tastes like a light IPA or some variety of Pale Ale. Maybe they could do something about that Steam Beer style. Must be a new bottling as I haven't seen the stuff for some months at least."
"Overall a pretty decent IPA that has a nice strong hoppiness and a mild Lager feel..."

"O) A good brew. I'd definitely have another one."
""
"Really worse then I expected. Smell is almost non-existant. What is there smells a little soapy. Appearance is about the only thing I can give it any points on. Light amber in color. Very bubbly. Nice white head. Flavor though? Very off. Not hoppy at all, and they are calling this an IPA? Almost get a bit of a Bock taste someplace in the middle, but it is quickly lost. Leaving this beer only a small step above nationals. I love the He-Brew line, but Coney is not impressing me."

"Like BrewDog's output, I tend to like Shmaltz stuff more than the average BA, across the board. This is a fantastic beer, refreshing like a lager but hopped nicely like any decent-to-great IPA. And hardly the confusing mess that some style-blurring beers tend to be. Hail Shmaltz."
""
""
"I just don't get this beer. The hop character seems okay but then dissolves into a herbal, medicinal mess with the flabby malt completing with a fair amount of fizz."
"O - Nothing that will blow your mind, but a well structured, easy drinking, flavoursome beer."
"Not a big fan of this beer. This was for sure the worst of the four Coney Islands I tried."
"Could use more carbonation, body seems pretty syrupy."
"Overall a pretty good beer. I enjoyed it."
"O: Not bad at all and better than I had expected. Sometimes after avoiding a beer for so long, it will find you and make you drink it."
"91."
"O- A malty IPA basically. The concept is cool, an IPL! Lagers are not always this hoppy, but this one is great."
"Pours a hazy honey hue which leaves a two finger head with sporadic lacing,the smell is honey,floral hops and boiled candy,the mouthfeel is medium bodied and has tastes of sticky redgum honey,caramel,flowery hops and finished with a bittersweet mix of doughy bread,lemon and pine and overall very sessionable and would drink again cheers."
"Overall: A tasty and interesting beer. Tastes a lot like a pale ale. Hops are very present but somewhat muted by the sweet and bready malts."
"O- Decent beer, but the lager yeast is something I guess I don't really care for. Maybe it would be better if I was more used to it. An interesting mix of tastes though!"
"I like the thought here. The lager yeast was a little too much for this to be awesome, but a nice go of it all the same."
"O - What caught me was the IPA lager tag (IPL if you will). Having tried it, I'm glad I bought it, but a standard IPA would have done much better. If you're looking for hops, try Stone's IPA. The lager yeast kills this one with a strange and unwelcome flavor and mouthfeel."
"O: I can't remember the last time I was blind-sided by a beer. I had little to no expectation for this one. A great blend of IPA/Lager. An interesting beer I will recommend to others."
"O: Tastes like drinking an above average ipa due to the copious amounts of hops added. Goes down easy, and I would recommend it you’re a lager lover looking to get into ipas."
"Pours a dark golden with a one finger head that quickly disipates. Smell is unique to me. Hops have an almost fruity smell not the pine or citrus that I'm used to. The malt come through, which I appreciate. Taste is kind of all over the place (not in a balanced way though). The astringency makes the linger very short and the alcohol is somewhat boozey and sticks out a bit. When I first heard of the concept of using lager yeast in an IPA (an IPL if you will) I thought ""that's neat how come lots of brewers aren't doing this?"" After tasting this I can see why. I'm not choking it down as the name probably suggests, but I won't be getting it again."
"Pours a yellowish golden color with a skim head. The aroma is of citrus and clove, grapefruit and oranges mostly present. The taste has a bready, biscuity malt backbone. That gives way to a slight citrus bite before finishing with a floral and piney hop bite. The bite is pronounced and much like an ipa. The mouthfeel is moderately carbonated. Overall it is an interesting beer the taste did enough to keep me interested. I would go back to this beer."
"O: The IPA bitterness is right on the money. The hop flavors seem to be a little muted because of the Lager yeast but yields to an exceptional smoothness. If you're looking for grapefruit flavors, look no further."
"Overall I am glad I remembered I got a 12oz for 2.50 since I was about to get a bomber and that's really too much. Really don't like this brew since I don't really like lagers and adding it's yeast really made this beer a bitter mess."
"O: Overall I think that this is a very nice example of a unique style, blending IPA with Lager, and coming out very well. A very crisp and smooth IPA, with a high drinkablity and slight grassy notes."
"Pours a hazy yellow to orange-ish color with an off white head. In the aroma, pine like hops. In the taste, starts pine to orange citrus like hops. A small hop bite and medium bodied mouthfeel, with a semi dry pine like hop in the aftertaste. Feels more like an ale/ IPA than a lager. Nice hops and quite nice."
"O: In general, American Pale Lager is a weak style, but this is a drinkable example of one."
"*Paired with a bbq burger with carmelized onions, mushrooms and feta cheese inside."
"Overall: This beer was awful. To date I cant think of a beer that was harder to drink than this one. It tasted like that acidic taste left in your mouth after you throw up. Just awful"
"The mouthfeel is nice, it's medium bodied and perhaps a bit too smooth, a bit of roughness from the carbonation would be welcome. The drinkability is very good, the ABV here is completely hidden. A great lager for the IPA fan, I can't help but think the poor reviews here are because the Coney Island line is fairly slow-moving and they don't freshness date on the bottles, only the cases."
"a friend bought this as an interesting purchase on a bottle run. this was billed as a ""lager"" and was some strange hoppy pale ale/lager hybrid. it was really bitter, bordering on ESB territory, and strangely hoppy. it definitely isn't a lager. i don't know what this is. it was interesting enough, but i'm not sure i'd buy one."
"Pours a fairly-clear golden-copper color with a single-finger white head and a bunch of spotty lacing on the way down. The nose carries a lot of caramel plus some bready notes. Faint earthy hops in the background. The flavor is carried by bready malt and is followed up with a fair amount of sweetness and quite a bit of caramel. No real hop flavor, but a fair amount of bitterness in the finish. Medium body and moderate carbonation. A bit of slight alcohol in the finish as well. A worthy brew."
"O: This beer is easy to drink, not overly complex. There is a nice malty back bone that balances out the hops of this lager."
"22oz bottle. Pours a clear light golden color with a very minimal amount of head. Tons of lacing. Aroma is bready and floral. Slight smell of citrus and sour. Taste is a bit different than it smelled. Floral. Bitter and pine flavors at the end. Pretty malty. Picking up on some orange peel as well. This does taste very much like a lager but just more floral. Very dry. It's not bad but nothing great. Borders on too floral. Overall, I tried it once and that's enough for me."
"d- nice, this isn't the most wonderful beer ever but i would certainly drink it again, it's a nice change of pace because most of the time i drink ales. great label artwork and bottle cap design as well."
"the CPJ"
"A pale copper beer with a head that is almost non-existent. You can smell oily hops, citrus, grass and even a touch of white grape. A quick hoppy note on the front leaves fast and is replaced by a somewhat floral finish. Has an off flavor that I can't place at the time. A bit stronger than most American Pale at 6.8% but still very easy. Probably a much better beer during the summer months when you need one on the beach."
"wheaty and hoppy with a quick bite of copper...lemony...7.2%...a good drinker..i am not going to bother talking about the way it looks...i'm drinking it, not staring at it...the hops are up front..there is a bit of sweetness that goes quickly...a decent drinker..."
"D- enjoyable but not the best. I wonder if its smoother as a draft"
"D: The beer isn't difficult to drink because the alcohol is well masked from the taste."
"Drink: Schmaltz comes out with some pretty good beers between Coney Island and He-Brew, but this wasn't one of them in my opinion. Not a drainpour, but I wouldn't buy it again."
"This is a very drinkable beer and may be up there with other IPAs, except this is not an IPA. I applaud the experimentation, but I like IPAs with the ale yeast. This brew does pop the malt profile pretty well, which I attribute to the clean yeast. Definitely worth a try."
"Thanks to woodychandler for the trade. Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a cloudy golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is rather hoppy for a lager. Taste also has considerable hops, some malts, almost more like a pale ale in its flavor. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and has average drinkability. Overall this is a good quality brew."
"A slightly cloudy amber color with a fair white cover that breaks up quickly leaving a decent lace. The aroma is of meaty malt and a polite skunky hop edge. The flavor is bold with malty watermelon sweetness and a nice dry grass hop bite. This is pretty tangy with subtle carbonation. It's a solidly medium body beer, aggressively flavored for a lager but pretty drinkable, well balanced, bright and tasty. It's smooth, and easily one of the best lagers a hop lover will encounter. A somewhat odd but likeable offering."
"Once more, my pour was about as agressive as it could get without causing the beer to overflow the sides of the glass. This resulted in two fingers' worth of eggshell-white head with great retention. Color was a deep copper with NE-quality clarity. Nose had a sharp grassy hop scent and my mouth began to water. Mouthfeel was medium with an immediate intermingling of grassy hops and yeasty spice on the tongue. Now, we're talkin'! I have to agree with an earlier reviewer that in the 4-variety sampler pack that this was the best of the lot. Finish was dry and slightly bitter, leaving me feeling like I had just tried to swallow a sword. Yum!"
"This was a very enjoyable beer. Like the other Coney Island beers you can't really trust the label in terms of what you're getting; I was expecting lager, and instead I got a nice bracing beer!"
"D - Quality brew; one of the better lagers I've had recently; would recommend to someone who's a hop-lager fan"
"D - This is a good beer that livens up the lager field its pretty much a hop bomb but I'm liking it worth picking up a bottle sometime"
"I get it... Maybe? Sword swallower? It's a cutting beer, worthy of its name, but that doesn't make it more drinkable. The lagery body doesn't give it anything to latch on to, and the hops dose up little more than a swathe of lacerations. Average at best."
"Honey colored lager. First sniff: lager aromatics (not a great description, I know). Second sniff: clean, slightly spicy hops. Tastes slightly rye-spicey, with light caramel, and peppery hop bite in the finish. Somewhat low body for a 6.8% abv lager, good thing IMO. Very drinkable, would buy again."
"Pours a clouded amber golden hue with a large off white head fine speckled lacing forms thick. Aroma has some harsh metallic hops and sharp citrus/lime notes. Sweet pale malt background, fruity highlights seems interesting. A lager that drinks like an IPA, hoppy delicious bitterness amongst pale balancing malts, excellent concept I burp up fruity hop notes this stuff could be really drinkable. Honey coated palte malts with earthy grapefruit rind bitterness, mouthfeel has a nice carbonation with medium bodied slick hop oils. Drinkablity overall was nice a beer I ccould see drinking on a regular basis, I didn't feel that way about most of the Coney Island sampler pack."
"D - Not really something I would drink a lot of in a row."
"A bitter beer, but for all the alleged dry hopping, it really doesn't come across in the aroma, nor the taste. Just is a bitter pony mostly. Decent enough for a lager, but doesn't really come across the palate, other than a metallic bitterness at an ipa festival."
"Horrible! Gag! It went down the sink and I didn't find the galvanized washer I expected to come clinking out of the bottle."
"D - Very easy drinking, the balance tilts towards the hops as it should, but the refreshing taste of the hops could sucker me into several"
" D- The smooth malt flavors have a wet slate note and a nice depth as the hops have a good depth aswell. The crisp lager characteristics along with the good depth make this beer very easy to drink."
"I wouldn't want to drink another Sword Swallower if this is really the way it's supposed to taste. Wish they'd put a Best Before or Brew Date on this bottle so I could have some idea if this one was stale or made this way on purpose. A dot-matrix batch code stamped on bottle bottom gave ""4121005080758"" as some sort of inventory control number; Shmaltz would do better to give us the brewing date if such brews go bad before we can drink them."
"Last one to review of the Coney Island mixed 12 pack... and this one is my favorite. This is basically a lager version of an IPA, kinda weird but its damn tasty. I must agree with a previous reviewer who said this tastes like SNPA... the piney-ness definitely reminds me of that beer, a classic of course. Great mouthfeel and body, nice balanced but hoppy taste, good drinkability.. the best of a solid mixed 12 pack."
"Part of a mixed sixer I picked up the other day. Used about half a bottle to cook up some shrimp and drank the rest. Poured a nice golden color, with a decent amount of cloudy white head on top. Pretty decent floral hops here, both on the nose and on the palate. There is a pretty decent malt presence here as well. A pretty solid lager. Probably grab another one sometime soon."
"Notes: This is a good beer. It actually tastes similar to SN Pale Ale to me, like the lager version. Pretty much because of that piney hop taste, even though the malt is different."
"Shmaltz Brewing Company--Coney Island Lagers--Coney Island Sword Swallower Steel Hop Lager--2008 22 oz. Bottle.6.80% ABV. 65 IBU's? (4.5 / 5.0) Pilsner IPA? Mild lace thin white head.

"Smooth medium body feels somewhat lush on the tongue etc. etc. but over all the hop bitterness cuts back on my personal drinkability sonewhat."
"I would definately buy this again. Recommended!"
"D - this one goes down smooth, def will Drink again "
"This is a drinkable beer if you like the hop domination, not my style."
"A cool bottle design with the chick choking down a sword. According to my BOTM bulletin the proceeds go to charity. Pretty cool. Poured to a thin, white head. Pale, orangish-yellow color. Attempts to lace throughout my drinking. Quite hoppy with some citrus on the nose. Hops definitely take the cake on taste. Its got a sweet malt backbone with some spice notes. But hops are the main attraction. This brew is highly drinkable with a clean, crisp mouthfeel. I start to feel the bitterness kick in during the aftertast which I was expecting at 70 IBU's. I can still taste the hops as I go for my next one. I like!"
"D - I didn't really care for this beer - and I don't think it's very well done (brewed) either. I don't know if the bottle was an old one or not - there is no freshness date on the bottle. The hop flavors are coarse and indistinct and the malt is confused: the hop selections don't blend well with peppery rye characters. The alcohol flavors don't blend well either. Too bad, I was looking forward to something different and refreshing based on the marketing."
"D - This is a nicely balanced beer, highish in alcohol but balanced in body. The hops add a very interesting aspect to the lager. Very sessionable."
"mouthfeel is light, an aspect of lagers that i really like. this is such a good lager i wish more like it were more readily available. i might order more lagers than ales then."
"Highly drinkable and very enjoyable, I will seek this out again and recommend this beer. As a hophead, this beer was a very pleasant and welcomed surprise."
"D - I was pleasantly surprised by this selection. Would definitely indulge again in the future as it's got a nice balance of hops, but does not slaughter you with a hop bomb. Highly recommended."
"Overall, a good APL that fits right into the top third for the style for me. Recommend if you can get a single or if you like the style. Not avail here in TX - BOMC. Rotation: while it was good the style, this is one of those styles that just don't wow me so one is enough. [N;N]"
"Comments: A beer of the month selection. This is an excellent example and a rare standout that manages to push the boundaries within the American pale lager style. It should be placed among the top in the American pale lager category. Nicely done!"
"Drinkability is decent. I kind of like this one, not sure that I'd buy another with the high price tag. But it's certainly not a bad hoppy lager."
"Some highs & lows with this one: really nice smell, interesting flavor profile that got increasingly challenging to the point that I felt it wasn't really worth the reward. Not bad overall, some really good points, but I feel it could use a little refining."
"I got this as part of a BOTMC. I poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a perfect pint glass, it pours a clear orange with a medium 2 finger white head. It has a nice grassy/citrusy aroma. The first sip has lots of pineapple and citrus. It mellows out and has a mettallic finish. It has a medium body and nice carbonation. A decent hoppy lager, not sure what is up with the mettallic taste. It puts off an otherwise pretty decent beer."
"The beer kinda grew on me as it went on, I started to feel it about 1/3 of the way through, not changing the grade, not saying I'd buy it again, but it tasted better to me as I went on. I'd say it's a little above average though as opposed to average as I first thought."
"drinkability: I like this better than their coney lager but I would not drink tis again either"
"This beer is much more drinkable than expected. I am not a fan of the style but cannot be critical of this offering. I will put a few more of these in the cooler!"
"Drinkability: All these different varieties of hops and the result is just not winding up in a place that I find particularly enjoyable; another interesting but, to my palate, unsuccessful beer in the Coney Island series"
" lots of different hops make for an interesting beer that's worth trying"
"Drinkability - This went down a lot better than I thought it would especially after my first whiff. The nose is boring but don't let that fool you this one packs a punch."
"D: This is a fairly drinkable beer. If I did manual labor for a living it is definitely something I would want to see in my fridge when I get home. Nothing special, but something that would quench a thirst."
"I enjoyed the heck outta this one. It may be the target taste for my next homebrew attempt."
"D - It's just so hard to believe that this beer resides in the same style category as so many other lesser attempts. Excellently drinkable, although a bit on the bitter side for the style. A great alternative to the usual IPA."
"This is as good a lager as you're going to find that's brewed outside of Europe."
"D: Porch pounder! Would be especially satisfying in the spring."
"Mouthfeel is light with hoppy bitterness at the end, high carbonation. A nice IPA, I like Pale Ales and this one is hoppy like an American IPA, not quite enough to make it overpowering. I'll get this one again."
"D - Medium"
"From all angles, this seems like a nice hoppy, biscuity pale ale, but one injected with unregulated beer growth hormone. The mixture of earthy and grassy hop essences, and dry metallic character, contributes to an overall sense of unbalance, if a weirdly tasty one at that."
"Does what this kind of a lager should, I suppose, but not an outstanding example of a style that I'm not a big fan of to start with."
"A curious hop bomb for a lager, enjoyable enough to a point and then yet it gets boring after a while. Still a great mouthfeel for a lager, hopped up to the tits, certainly the hoppiest lager I've ever tried, but in the end doesn't really warrant too much of an urge for a return visit."
"D- I was surprised at how hoppy this was considering the ""American Pale Lager"" category. Definitely not my favorite brew but certainly worth trying."
"Drinkability- Easy to drink, good example of an APA.."
"D- something was really off putting at first, but it grew on me near the finish. I've had 4 of the coney islands this far and this was definitely the best, but I prefer the hebrew lineup much more."
"A big, balanced lager."
"I really like a good hopped up lager beer like this one,I want to see more on the shelves!Poured a light to medium golden with a some hazes peach to it, a nice fluffy one finger white head atop.A great mix of hops in the nose ranging from herbal/grass to citrus,there is also a noticeable caramel presence there as well as a tinge of iron.Flavors start out like the aromas with a big mown grass and herbal profile melding into light citric flavors,a lightly toasted and sweetish caramel flavor comes through in the finish.Just a real nice American hopped lager."
"I'm a fan of Coney Island Lager, but not of the Sword Swallower. The latter tries to do too much, and as a result, is too much for my palate."
"It has a great, lasting mouthfeel for a lager. Drinkability is ok."
"Drinkable, but only if you like constant hops."
"D: The sweetness mixed with spiciness was refreshing, but maybe only for a couple of beers."
"Pours a slightly hazy straw color with off-white head. Nose has some herbal notes with lemony citrus, but isn't very aromatic overall. Palate has a good balance of malt with hop bitterness, with some spice coming through towards the end (perhaps rye). Finish is spicy and lemony."
"D- Easy to drink, nice and clean with a dirty earthy side."
"Dark yellow to golden beer with a small head. Aromas of bready malts with citrus hops to balance out. The tastes really reveal the hops in this beer. Citrus and a bit grassy, too. A bit of metallic, but that is overrun by the honey sweetness that pulls through. Mouthfeel is light but decent bitter residuals linger. This is a good hoppy lager...I would definitely buy it again. The label also kicks ass!"
"Afterthought, I'm surprised at the lower ratings for this beer. I find this APA to be well above average, superior really."
"Overall: Delicious, but not as hoppy as one would expect with 8 different hops! It most certainly is a lager, and retains those characteristics quite well despite all that is going on in this beer. Quite refreshing!"
"drinkability is also very good - i drank this 22oz faster then the 2hearted i drank before this and i love that beer"
"D- This is a very drinkable brew, and one which I would definately buy again. Lager? I guess, but this one definately tastes and drinks like an ale."
"Overall, the style says it all. Hop lager."
" but the character leaves a bit to be desired."
"Enough flavor in here though, for sure. I'm getting some sweet pineapple, some apricot and other herbal notes. It's got some unique flavors in there, but nothing amazing. Bit chewy, and the metallic notes are kind of a turnoff. It's a bit thick and resinous for a lager, it reminds me of a stone pale ale or something. If it was a blind tasting, i wouldnt call this a lager, its neither clean, nor quenching like I expected. It's coating and high alhpa bitterness that makes me thirsty for a sip of water to cut through it."
"Label proclaims this is a ""Steel Hop Lager"". I'm not cure what that means but I'm not a big fan of the hops used here and I certainly could have appreciated a bit more of a malt balance. Not one that I would visit again."
"A tad sweet overall, but nicely hoppy."
"D: Drinkability was only marginally above average as well all around enjoyment. Worth a drink, but not necessarily repeat material."
"Easy to drink, but I really didn't want to finish the 22oz bottle. I wouldn't drink this one again. Very disappointed in this offering."
"Not sure I would buy it again, but I would recommend it to a lager fan."
"Definitely a full flavored lager. Not the most complex but it offers a very nice malt body and modest hop presence that makes for a very balanced, highly drinkable beer. The kind of brew you could put down all night. Not sure which hop varietals went in but I think I can taste saaz, which normally would turn me off but it works for me here."
"D-At first I didn't like where this was going but as it warmed it became a pleasant drinking beer.I would make this purchase again."
"D - Interesting and very drinkable brew. Not as ""juicy"" a hop as a typical AIPA, but has it's own brand of hoppy depth."
"Overall- Sweet up front hoppy bitter in the end. Let it warm up a bit."
"Overall, not very pleasant. Treacly sweetness with odd bitterness didn't jibe well. It does get a little better as it warms and I get through the bottle."
"6/4/7/3/14 (3.4/5)"
"A nicely hopped lager. An interesting, different brew."
"Solid lager - crisp and clean (no caffeine) and a good, moderately innovative effort for sessionability."
"This Schmaltz Brewing Company American pale lager is clearly well-brewed beer. However, my enthusiasm is kept in check by the abscence of a major flavor hook. More Crystal, Cascade or Amarillo (better yet, all three) is the obvious fix."
"Overall a very tasty and highly drinkable lager, considering the hefty ABV."
"22 ouncer, no freshness info, which would be great for this style beer. Pours clear lighter amber, under a long lasting off white head and leaving prodigious amounts of sheeting and scattered lace, Fresh hop nose, minty and piney.Flavorful, hoppy and thoroughly enjoyable quaffer. Clean and refreshing, well crafted and highly enjoyable. A pleasant surprise."
"Drinkability- Kinda reminds me of a hoppy Anchor Steam. Not quite up to that standard, but a decent tasting lager here."
"Definitely a hoppy lager, which caught me off guard. It presents itself as a lager, but has a relatively large amount of hop character. It's a relatively neutral hopping, tending toward the green and herbal side, which is pleasant. I'm generally not a huge lager fan, but the hops made this one interesting with a ton of character, almost reminiscent of a hoppy pilsner. Definitely interesting and worth a shot. I'd consider drinking one again."
"The most complex thing about this beer is the label. Orange golden color with a slight dissipating head. Nice refreshing lager smell. Big cereal type malty taste but in a light to medium body. A bit effervesce lemon zing with some carbonation. Has a funky aftertaste not sure but possibly from the hops. Not a bad beer but I have come to expect so much more from Hebrew. In the end it is still a nice lager."
"A friend bought me this and several other selections as a thank you for taking him to numerous Angels games this season. He bought it based on the name and label, even though we are both serious beer folks. It was amusing, but I probably will not buy it again."
"Notes: As far as style goes, I'd say this one resides somewhere between ""Imperial Lager"" and ""American Pilsner"" due to the ABV, grassy hops, bright golden color and pils-like malt. Worth checking out."
"Drinks easy, but the hoppyness would grow old after about 3 pints"
"In the end, it was an interesting Lager. It was more hoppy than malty, but it still had the usual yellow color that comes with a Lager. If you're low on money and looking for an affordable All Malt Lager, then you might want to think about picking up this beer."
"D- Sword Swallower is a solid brew that is worth a repeat purchase. Recommended."
"Pours a strong, pilsnery sunshine yellow. But there's some pale hues as well reminiscent of an american pale wheat ale. Maybe a one finger head, that recedes to a filmy foam ring. Pretty good bubbling though. A lovely hoppy lemon grass withjust a touch of bread dough and gently toasted rice grains make up the nose. Taste is steel twinged hops with some lemon notes then the malts and yeast hint at straight grains right afterthey've been milled. Maybe a light touch of caramel. Very crisp palates with a great hop profile for any lager I've had. Almost sessionable."
"D - I have enjoyed the several Coney Island releases I have tried. This is almost like an Imperial lager. Nice."
"Ok so happy to finally try one of the Coney Island specialties. Appearance is pretty good, with a hazy yellow color, some head and lacing. Smell and taste are of grassy hops and sweet malt. That is about it. Mouthfeel is good medium in body and a nice a mount of carbonation. Drinkability is above par for this style."
"I want to like all the Shmaltz beers more than I do. Clearly made with creativity and care. And Sword Swallower is probably my favorite of the three Coney Island specialty releases. It's not bad - just not great. I'm not going to spend money on another Sword Swallower."
"I originally meant to get the albino python beer from these guys, but picked this one up instead (oh well). Poured in to a Bar Harbor Brewing Pilsner glass a vibrant, clear, gold with a respectably sized white head. Tiny carbonation bubbles could be seen rising towards the top of the beer. Smell leans towards the biscuity side, with some herbal, spicy hops in the background. Taste is dominated by spicy hops, with the biscuity malt taking a back seat. The hop presence is very pronounced on this one, makes me think of oily hop resins. Feel is heavier than i expected, for this style anyway. Drinkability suffers a little bit for me with the sticky, bittering hops. It seems like they may have overdone it a bit. Perhaps serving it at a cooler temperature would give it a more refreshing character. Still strikes me as being a pretty damn pleasing offering from Shmaltz, a brewery I have a lot of respect for. Cheers"
"There was much that I liked about this brew, but in the end the flavor was too heavily burdened by too much (not quite pleasant) spicy bitterness."
"I wish more lagers tasted like this."
"I'm not keen on this lager because it is just too tart, with a big lemony acerbicness that drowns out the crispy maltiness that should be more pronounced. The beer pours a nice golden, clear color with a smallish white head that doesn't retain. No lacing either. The aroma is quite good, some nice citrus underneath, mild malt lagery presence in the nose. The taste is a crisp in the mid section, ample malts, but then the biting lemon hoppiness, maybe a peppery spiceness just takes over. The mouthfeel is a tad watery and tad oily on the tongue. The aftertaste is a continuation of the biting pepperishness in the finish. This isn't a particularly enjoyable lager, nor is it refreshing. There is a perfuminess in the aftertaste that lingers way too long for my tastes. I'm a bit disappointed to say the least."
"Overall a pretty decent brew. The hops are more aggressive than I expected giving the impression of a pale ale. Worth a try."
"Taste like a typical American Pale ale, nothing to get excited about."
"Notes-Love the Shmaltz Brewing Co.. I was first sold on the Bittersweet Lenny's R.I.P.A.. Coney Island Lager followed as a solid,clean and hoppy session lager. Now this hop bomb of a Lager. Great stuff."
"First sip: impressive grapefruit and tangerine hop presence zaps the sides and back of the palate, while a semi-sweet malt presence provides an excellent balance. Mouthfeel is near-perfect: juicy, well-carbonated, crisp, and packs one hell of a bitter, hoppy finish for a lager. This is an excellent lager, a great addition to a summer session, and a brew I look forward to having again. To date, I haven't been all that impressed with Shmaltz's ales...maybe their lagers are the way to go!"
"Pours a light-copper color, rocky white head slowly fades into a foamy ring around the beer, some thick patches of lacing left in the glass. Honey-like sweetness to the malt on the nose, very floral hoppy aroma...nice. Very hop-forward taste, grassy, herbal/floral tastes, and a nice malty sweetness. There's some citrus buried in there somewhere, and maybe even a trace of pineapple, and some aspirin-like bitterness....a lot of bitterness to this one, and I'm loving it. Crisp mouthfeel, really refreshing, but the lingering hoppy bitterness really means business! Super versatile, super drinkable, and very tasty!"

"Poured a 22oz bottle into my New Belgium globe. This beer pours a light, hazy, lemony orange. The aroma is lemony citrus with just a hint of orange. The aroma is slightly citrusy with just a kiss of bread. The taste is orange and lemon with toast and just a hint of vanilla. The mouthfeel is light. It would definitely make a great summer beer. I find this a easily quaffable beer. Also as a side note, I drink this regularly at my favorite beer bar, and I find that the hops are much more pronounced in the draft version."
"D - The hard bite of this makes me feel like the one would be enough, a nice beer, but maybe more bite than I am looking for."
"overall a very nice refreshing beer."
"Poured from a He'Brew bomber. The beer was light copper colored, very clear, with a massive head of foam that lasted a long time. The smell is more hoppy than most or all all-malt lagers, a little bit of citrus covering a sweet and toasty malt aroma. The taste was very good, it reminded me a little of some hoppy pilsners I've had, a hops cherry on a malt sundae. Really sweet malt flavors were reinforced by sweet hop citrus rather than opposed by hops bitterness. I suppose it isn't balanced in that regard but it was pretty good. The body didn't feel too thick but it was substantial enough, very drinkable."
"The Coney Island line-up is three-for three with me, so far."
"Pours a clear amber with a thin crems head. Nose is thickly sweet with a noticeable malt backbone. Flavor has a bit of a bite to it. A bit much, but still interesting. Sweet tone really keeps things going. Feel has a biting carbonation. Liquid is a bit thick, but still about right. Nice one here. Not really that bad at all. Worth a shot."
"Quite nice but flavor wise this is basically an Imperial Pilsner. I LIKE it but this has a punishing level of hops, if you don't like Imperial Pilsners you will hate this. One bottle of this is enough and this would be great for really spicy food."
"The body was clear and golden peach colored, with an ample carbonation forming a one finger thick and durable head. The nose was clean and displayed a combination of noble hops and Munich malts. The taste was quite a bit more hoppy than I was anticipating from the smell. The hops were spicy and floral in character, and were backed by a Festbier like malty but drinkable backbone. The body was creamy and smooth, and the aftertaste was herbal and marred by a slight metallic note. An enjoyable and affordable offering from this brewery that seems to be growing on me with each release."
"The beer pours a gold color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is decent. It has a nice pilsner malt scent along with a less than stellar hop aroma. The taste is good. It has a light pale and pilsner malt flavor along with a good hop taste. It's quite bitter, hence the Steel Hop Lager name. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a good drinking beer. I was expecting better because the He'Brew beers are so good, but this drinks well regardless."
"Pours a hazy golden color with an average white head that settled into a slight cap. The aroma is of a buttery malt, thats pretty much it, very one dimensional. The taste is of light caramel malt, rust, and light stale hop. The feel is moderate with fizzy carbonation; finishes with a hoppy bitterness. A slightly butter slightly hoppy american lager, not fantastic, not terrible. Definitely not macro, just not as good as Brooklyn or the Boston lagers."
"D - man, this is a serious lager. Goes down well and has a pretty good taste. I know some beer dudes who hate lagers (just a few) and I'm always all ""WTF lagers have a time and a place how can you just write them off like that."" This beer backs up my reasoning. Would totally drink again. Definitely more hoppy than I thought it would be. Liking this."
"What a gorgeous beer - pours a bright, vibrant yellow with a slight head. The smell is slight and pilsner-like. The flavor is strong and malty, with good floral hops, perhaps a whiff of pine. A nice bitterness on the tongue. The mouthfeel is strong and viscous. This is a not a beer I would feed to those that prefer Macro Lagers, but for a craft beer lover, this is a refreshing, meaty, complex lager. Highly drinkable."
"This is a really nice drink, and one I greatly appreciate after a long, hot, hot, hot day at work. Sword Swallower  is medium-bodied, substantial in flavor, and very refreshing. I have every intention of buying more bombers of this beauty on my next trip to the sto'."
"Drinkability: A classy, hopcentric lager, it paired rather nicely with a spicy pepperoni pizza and a few Tevo'd episodes of Cold Case. As part of the Coney Island series, it came in third for me after the Lager and Albino Python."
"Mouthfeel is clean and light, good drinkability."
"Very tasty, if not confusing to the style."
"22oz bottle served in a shaker pint. Poured a slightly hazy, pale gold. Plenty of carbonation with a finger of fine bubbled white head. Nice noble hop aroma with malt. A hint of cardboard. Really solid malt base, almost bock like. Good dose of hop bitterness that is drying in the finish. Clean and flavorful. Another solid beer from Shmaltz."
"D - This was probably one of the hoppiest all-malt lagers that I've had. Pretty good."
"This one's filling and refreshing at the same time. I'll tell you, it's certainly a good beer for right after a Saturday afternoon nap. Recommended."
"Coney Island Sword Swallower pours a pale copper color witha thin white head from a brown twenty two ounce bottle. The aroma isn't particularly strong, a bit of sweet malt, a hint of hops. The flavor is quite hoppy up front, a bit floral and a bit spicy, the aftertaste is a bit lacking however as the flavor quickly disappears. Worth a try."
"D - This beer is a bit odd but is certainly drinkable. This would be good with grilled fish and maybe a bucket of Rhode Island steamers."
"If the ABV was a little lower this would score higher. Bitter lagers do exist and this is one of them. An alternative to an IPA on a hot day."
"I like hoppy lagers, but this misses the mark a bit."
"Purchased: Plaza Liquors, Tucson AZ"
"Smells of barley and grass, with some orange. Taste is quite good, refreshing hops...a mix of citrus and mild spice....on a well established...but light...malt body. Some nice complexity in the hop/malt bridge, hints of apple, rye bread. Tangy, clean and moderately dry finish. light to medium bodied. A nice lager, though one better served in 12oz bottles, methinks, to make it more accessible."
"Sword Swallower is quite a good brew from He'Brew; simple, yet complexingly hopped in its dry finish and overall tone and character. Plus, I think its probably much easier to swallow then an actual sword?"
"The beer poured a clear honey-amber with a foamy, white head into a pint glass. The aroma was of citrusy hops and sweet malt. The taste was a very pleasant, full bodied hop flavor, dissipating into a sweet malt finish with a great hop bite. Good carbonation and lacing. This is one of the beers in their ""Coney Island"" series. The high ABV is masked very well, making this a surprisingly drinkable beer."
"Final Note: This beer, as well as all of the other Coney Island beers are brewed in Saratoga Springs, NY at the Medicino brewery."
"D: Hop presence intensifies as it warms. Drink this one cold. I might just be saying this because it's hot as fuck now. But the flavor kinda twangs off into left field when it gets warm. Drink it cold. If you like the super bitter, let it warm."
"Pours a perfectly clear straw color with a very slight, minimal head. Faintly sweet, toasty malt aroma that is very subtle. Nice citric hop flavors and bittering coupled with a solid malt profile. Slightly sticky, husky aftertaste. Quasi-creamy mouthfeel with a slick, juicy and smooth palate presence. A well hopped lager for sure, but still retaining characteristic lager drinkability. Interesting brew that's worth a try."
"Wow, a hop bomb lager! I really like this a lot."
"Poured a clear amber, like iced-tea. had a very thin head with a thick ring clinging to the sides of the glass. smelled sweet and malty, like brown sugar with a little bit of metal. tasted syrupy with the sweetness and smoothness of honey. some caramel tossed in... very reminiscent of a Polish or Russian lager... which i don't prefer. however, there was the slightest pleasant bitterness which gave it a little kick near the end, along with the smell and taste of alcohol. aside from the bitterness, it's really not very unique. i can get a Russian lager for less than half the price and almost the same taste. still, it wins points for novelty and a freaky label."
"D_Interesting cross-style beer. I am not so sure as to how I feel about it, but it is different."
"This is another well done lager from Shmaltz with tons of hops and rye notes and a great drinkibility for a 7% beer. I would definitely visit this again."
