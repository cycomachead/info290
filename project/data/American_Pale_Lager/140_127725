First time drinking Electric Ray, a collab IPL between Sierra Nevada and Balllast Point. The beer is an orangish copper color, not quite clear with one finger of fluffy eggshell colored head. Very nice retention and lacing. Aroma is somewhat muted, which is not surprising considering it's age. I do get some faint bready notes, along with a whiff of citrus. The taste is pretty malty up front, but I get some nice grapefruit and slight pineapple in the finish. The mouthfeel was pretty light, with just a touch of carbonation. Overall, this was a dang good beer considering it is probably well past it's prime. Sadly, I didn't get to taste one of these fresh (shared the other Beer Camp boxes), I'm thinking it was pretty good when fresh.","timontheroad","Oct 24, 2014"

It has a floral, citrusy hop nose over light grains with a slight sweetness but does not smell like 70 IBU (international Bittering Units – a measure of bitterness). It pours brilliant amber with a light copper tint under a 1” snow white persistent foam cap. Electric Ray starts very creamy on the tongue, slightly sweet with clean light malt flavors supporting citrusy, floral hops finishing dry with a touch of astringency from the hops.  Electric Ray has the lager cleanness and smoothness but it has bigger malt and a much bigger hop flavor and aroma. The body is bigger than a lager without being fat or flabby. The carbonation is creamy, fine and soft. Everything is very well balanced.","pat61","Sep 29, 2014"

Taste is grains and grass flavors, yeast upfront with some good amount of sweet fruity candied sugar and alcohol on the end. Palate is a med to full body, good carbonation. Finish is grains, yeast, malt sweet candied sugar on the end with moderate bitterness. Overall considering the alcohol content of 8.5, it wasn’t too overwhelming, simply drink slowly, a good drinking brew.","Samp01","Sep 29, 2014"

An outstanding beer all around that I would indulge in with regularity if this were a year round offering...  Very nicely done...  Kudos to both Sierra Nevada and Ballast Point... By far my favorite of the Beer Camp Across America to date (though I still have a couple to go)...","philbe311","Sep 23, 2014"

It has a decent head with good retention that leaves moderate lacing. Aroma is full-bodied with big orange and pine notes right up front.  Taste continues with bold hop and citrus presence as well as a nice alcohol wallop lurking in the background. Not especially surprising from an 8.5 % ABV brew categorized as an imperial pale lager. Mouthfeel is a little thinner than I expected, but still pretty decent with a level of carbonation that is not overwhelming. This is a potent brew with plenty of hops as I would expect from these two breweries, but definitely not to be classified as sessionable.","bristol2120","Aug 24, 2014"

Quite good but very thin this is yet another fine addition to Beer Camp.","KYGunner","Aug 16, 2014"

Some grassy and light floral hop is present. Beer is well crafted but the taste is not desirable to me. It seems just light and bland with a balance and light mouth-feel. Alcohol is very well hidden. A second sip and smell brings the hoppiness into play. Now getting some resin and pine but still it tastes at the finish not so desirable. Once finished the glass is smothered in beautiful lace.

Some bright piney/citrus hop notes on the nose. IPL is a strange breed. I thoroughly enjoy the hops on this guy but like most IPLs, the super hoppy lager is just odd. Nice carmely malts with that very forward citrus hop presence. Light mouthfeel, not bad overall but I don't think I would drink a lot of these.

Taste is smooth and similar in nature, bit of spritzy citrus up front, lightly 'oily' in the middle and finishing with a brief linger of hop spice. Firm in feel and lightly coarse in nature yet creamy at the same time given the hop balance. Warming brings forth more robust and resinous hop notes and a fuller less oily feel. Smoooth and easy. The initial waft of ethanol is now masked by the hop charge. I suspect we'll be seeing this one again. Nicely done.","HalfFull","Aug 03, 2014"

Spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of grapefruit, mango, pineapple, lemon zest, orange peel, floral, grass, light pine, light caramel, bread, and floral/grassy earthiness. Very nice aromas with good complexity and balance of bright citrus/tropical hops and moderate malt sweetness; with good strength. Taste of big grapefruit, mango, pineapple, lemon zest, orange peel, floral, grass, light pine, light caramel, bread, and floral/grassy earthiness. Good amount of pine/grassy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of grapefruit, pineapple, mango, lemon/orange zest, floral, grass, light pine, light caramel, bread, and floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice complexity and balance of bright citrus/tropical hops and moderate malt sweetness; with a nice malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth, crisp, and lightly creamy/sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very nice IPL style. All around good complexity and balance of bright citrus/tropical hops and moderate malt sweetness; and very smooth and crisp to drink.

There’s a little bit of lacing and the head has ok retention for a lager. The aroma is sweet with malt and hops. The malt is honey with light caramel. Rather sugary. Floral, pine and citrus hoppiness. Citrus is probably the strongest of the three. Mostly grapefruit. It smells like pine needles and grapefruit rind in honey with a dose of lager yeastiness. The taste is similarly on the sweet side. The beer dries out some in the finish, but it’s a bit too big for its own good, in my opinion. There’s a fair bit of malt character, more of that sweet honeyed grain flavor. Citrus and pine hop character with only moderate bitterness. Some booze. Very nice mouthfeel. Light on the palate for the abv. Fairly easy to drink. Almost crisp. Some hop oiliness.

Pours a dull orange hue with a translucent clarity and a sizzling, half-inch, bright white head that settles into a consistent skim. Nose is very subdued - citrus zest and a trace of floral hoppiness. Taste reveals a spiciness upfront, followed by more citrus zest and floral hops that leave a residual bite at the finish. Mouthfeel is light in body with a bright carbonation and some astringency that lightly stimulates the sides of the cheeks and the tongue. A decent IPL, but I don't love the hops profile (Hoponius Union has spoiled me).","Jwale73","Jul 28, 2014"

This is not Ballast Point's best effort, but it is much better than the first one I tried from the much lauded Three Floyd's. This is a hoppy lager. Its a fine beer. The aroma is there but if you look at reviews (including my own about Fathom) you will get a pretty good picture of what this beer is all about.

The flavor is quite bitter, lots of typical American-hop flavor, good malt balance--actually it's hard to write this review because there's nothing special about this beer. It's a generic IPA with a lager yeast, which does little to make it stand out. It's basically the same as a thousand other IPAs I've had in the past.","allengarvin","Jul 23, 2014"

There is a medium amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel.

Not much on the nose, a little fruit such as apple and pine needles to bring in some earthiness. Taste is apple, pine, a little grapefruit, some malted notes such as cocoa and carmel to finish with the hops. Drinks a lot like a Maibock, with slightly more piney and citrusy notes in there. Mouthfeel is crisp and light, good for the Lager yeast style. Dry finish and very nice balance of fruitiness, and mildness of the yeast lends to a good mouthfeel and finish.

Quite the nice looking beer, more IPA or amber lager than golden lager. Scents of grassy hops, tropical fruits, sweet orange flesh, citrus zest, a hint of pine and faint notes of grainy malt. A very nice, crisp, clean hop-forward aroma that also has a nice malt balance. Quite appealing. Flavor begins balanced between sweet malt flavors, bitterness and hop character with notes of tropical fruit, grapefruit peel and pith and slight floral hops. This moves into a balanced middle with sweet malt mingling with flavors of melon, pine resin, and hints of alcohol with a moderate level of bitterness. Finish is similarly balanced though a bit more bitter, with notes of grapefruit pith and peel, floral hop notes, a bit of pine resin, a sweet malt backbone and a hint of alcohol. Aftertaste is bitter with. Toes of floral hops, pine resin, grapefruit peel and a slight bit of grainy malt. A very nice flavor profile, quite similar to an IPA with very little indication of the lagering making it through the hops and high ABV. Still quite nice and very balanced between a high level of bitterness and sweet malt, which lends the beer its moderate bitterness level overall and its complexity. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and smooth with low carbonation and a slightly silky feel. Very nice and quite easy to drink, masking its ABV nicely. Overall this is a good hoppy beer. It balances the hops and malt nicely in the flavor and has a pleasant aroma and mouthfeel that make it quite pleasant to drink. A good effort from two great breweries.","Auraan","Jul 17, 2014"

4.26,11.8,4,4.25,4.5,4,4,"Poured into a Seattle Beer Week pint glass. Pours a medium golden amber with a fine, one finger white head with great retention and lots of lacing. Interesting aroma of bready malt and a quite unusual hop component that is has grassy, floral, light citrus and honeydew melon characters, unique and enticing. Flavor is caramel and bready malts, with the same very nice hop blend of grassy, floral and melon family flavors. Almost a potpourri taste that kept me coming back for more tastes. Medium bodied. I'm quite impressed by the hop flavors in this one. I'm familiar with both Sierra Nevada and Ballast Point hopped beers and this is nothing like either, an interesting and complex hopping. I think if this was a bit more floral, it could actually get cloying, but I did not get tired of tasting this. If this went into production, it would be on my rotation list. I seem to like this more than most reviewers, but this one really hit all the buttons for me. Very nice.","LiquidAmber","Jul 15, 2014"

The aroma has a decent amount of caramel as well as a decent amount of grapefruit. The taste is sweet with a decent amount of caramel as well as a decent amount of grapefruit. The finish has a light bitterness with some lingering sweetness and some grapefruit. Medium body. Medium-low carbonation. This would have been a lot more enjoyable if the sweetness was dialed back a bit.","jethrodium","Jul 13, 2014"
