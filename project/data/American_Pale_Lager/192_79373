3.99,10.8,4.5,4.25,4,3,4,"I came across a 12-pack variety of New Belgium and decided to try the pale lager. I haven't been entirely impressed with these types of beers from other brewers but from New Belgium it was very good.  The pale lager has a dark tinge with a beautiful white and puffy head along with really good lacing - the best I've seen in quite some time. I was also impressed with the wheaty scent along with the distinctive IPA smell (and the other plus for me was there was none of the over bitterness that comes with an IPA).  Overall, it was a great beer and I'm glad I've got a few more to go through.","jjamadorphd","Nov 28, 2014"

Not super-hoppy as some of their newer offerings tend to be, and I could taste a bit of the fruity flavor that is advertised.  It's a little atypical for this brewery, and I'm glad they took a chance to make this style.","dcscientist","Nov 26, 2014"

The nose is hoppy with a nice touch of malts, some citrus, very slight yeast note. The taste is very nice hoppy, with some maltiness, nice touch of citrus. Medium body, with a nice bitter/dry finish. Overall a pretty tasty brew, would buy again.","Wasatch","Nov 13, 2014"

3.25,-9.7,,,,,,"Pours a clear bright yellow in color with a good 2-finger foamy white head that settles down to a good 3mm or so after a bit. A good amount of lacing is seen when sipped, almost rings. The aroma is nothing real special, just of some grains with a light hint of sulfur. Bit more going on with the taste as there is a slight hint of fruit and citrus zest in the mix as well. Does have a tad of a hoppy finish. Lighter bodied with a good amount of carbonation. Not a big fan of this style of brew overall.","BeerWithMike","Oct 06, 2014"

The lacing is fine but irregular but does stay with the glass. The aroma is classic lager- biscuit and grassy, mild hops. There are hints of tropical fruits, but they are illusive at best. The body of this beer is heavier than expected from a lager, but the difference is welcoming. The palate is crisp and clean with nice malty notes balanced nicely with a piney hop bitterness. The hops continue through the finish and linger for a good 20 seconds. Overall, a very well done lager and a fantastic sessionable beer.","JeffH","Apr 03, 2014"

Aromatics offer up biscuit malt, mild grassy citric notes crisp blend of malts, hops, water...almost a pungent tartness in the nose. Flavor perfectly complex drinking lager, all malted barley goes along way with flavor...biscuit malts bring a bready resilience with the herbal/mineral/citric notes coming from the hops very clean snappy finish. Those hops stick around more than the average end of shift lager that this country knows all too well. I saw it labeled for 16.99 a 12 pack, which I didn't jump on however I did grab about four cans for $1.69 just enough to wet the whistle. Crisp even carbonation perfect mouthfeel semi dry finish linger hops accent the breadiness perfectly it's a true American Lager thank heavens for New Belgium. Overall I will definitely grab more of this class expression of true drinking beer.","WVbeergeek","Feb 15, 2014"

Crisp forwardness with a light malt palate. Fresh, bright and delectably sharp with cereal notes (Corn Flakes?!), however, this is all malt!? My palate must be at odds with reality today. Modest carbonation. Broad Belgian lace forms. It is very nice. May not seek it again, but would not decline if offered.","carlborch","Sep 10, 2013"

Taste was grainy, a little caramel malt, fruity, and grassy. Mildly bitter. A active but creamy mouthfeel. Overall, probably the lone beer in their regular lineup I like even if this isn't the most well constructed beer out there. Makes for a nice, easy drinking summer session beer. And as a sucker for just about anything to do with nelson sauvin hops, this one is right up my alley.","denver10","Jul 21, 2013"

While I find that condescending and a bit insulting, nonetheless, the brew itself is pretty good. Certainly not a prize-winner, but that is true of most beer coming from the self-important and (I suppose this goes hand in hand) "wind powered" brewery.","BeerDocT","Apr 17, 2013"

It's a reasonably priced beer that comes in a can (cans are perfect for the summer) and it has just enough character to keep things interesting. Perhaps the strangest thing about this beer is the mouthfeel was the highlight. Although this beer is uneventful and inoffensive (I imagine anyone could enjoy this on a warm day) it's lager, and perhaps even a bit adventurous for the style. All around a good beer and I know later this summer when I'm heading to the river, I will grab a couple of these.","alexrichman","Apr 04, 2013"

Pours slightly hazy golden straw color with a nice 1-2 finger dense white head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of lemon zest, apple, pear, cracker, bready grain, floral, grass, pepper, and herbal earthiness. Damn nice and pleasant aromas with good balance and strength. Taste of lemon zest, pear, pepper, apple, cracker, bready grain, floral, grass, and herbal earthiness. Lingering notes of light fruits, pepper, cracker, bread, floral, grass, and herbal on the finish for a bit. Very nice flavor balance and good complexity of hop/malt notes; with zero cloying flavors present after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth and crisp mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with hardly any warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a very nice pale lager. Very nice balance of hop/malt flavors; and extremely smooth and crisp to drink. A very enjoyable and refreshing offering.","superspak","Jan 30, 2013"

4.55,26.4,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,"Overall: I have been on a bit of an emotional rollercoaster with this beer since I bought a four pack and then a subsequent case (6 x 4 pack) about a week or two ago. The first sip of the first can was an explosion of Nelson Sauvin hops and I immediately declared this beer my new favorite. After a couple more cans over the next couple of days, I was fighting to detect that strong Nelson Sauvin hoppiness I so love and cherish (especially in a beer like Bulletproof Tiger). But since then, I have been literally pounding this beer on a near daily basis. It is just so damn drinkable, balanced, and great tasting (read: LOTS OF FLAVOR FOR A LOW ABV LAGER), if not delicious. Very satisfying from the can or in a glass. This could possibly be my session, daily drinker, beer for life when Sierra Nevada Summerfest is out of season. The only knock is the somewhat high price - I calculated that this works out to about a $40 standard case (as opposed to $30 for Summerfest in my area.) I would love to see more brewers doing more with Nelson Sauvin hops - my new favorite hop alongside Saaz (with Citra running a close third!)","JednoPivoProsim","Jan 04, 2013"

And while the taste may also be no-frills to some, there's something about the way this beer seduces me that I can't help but like. Its taste is lead by honey, bready, and floral flavors, and pair that with the flavors having harmony with one another, it wins.

Love the Nelson Sauvin hops. Taste is similarly crisp, with mild hops, light malt, grass, orange peel, and grapes. Mouthfeel is light and crisp (yes, again), with a medium-thin body and solid carbonation. Overall a lovely session beer, and solid addition to the New Belgium line-up.","jsanford","Sep 16, 2012"

Orange zest, lemon, green hops in the nose. The body is crisp, but thins out on the finish. Could use a little more 'snap' to it. NB comes through with big bitter hops as expected. They couldn't just brew a simple refreshing lager, no, this beer is like a MIPA (mild IPA). The bitter character is short-lived though, and there's not a lot else here. It's not the most flavorful beer, other than the oily hops. This was decent, but not what I expected.","Onenote81","Sep 14, 2012"

It had really good drinkability, it was really smooth, crisp, refreshing, and the flavors did a great job at holding my attention, I could see taking out a four pack on a nice warm summer day, this beer is pretty much the definition of drinkable. What I liked most about this beer was how nice the hop aspect to this beer was and how nicely it was balanced by the bread malts, the balance is really impressive and the drinkability was really nice. What I liked least about this beer was nothing, there isn't anything that I would want to change with this beer, it's great just the way it is. I would for sure buy this beer again, in fact I already got two more four packs before the store jacks the price up, I highly recommend this to anyone and this would make a great choice for someone just getting into craft beer. All in All I was flat out impressed by this beer and it could be one of the best lagers I have ever had, New Belgium hit it out of the park with this one, they gave the people what they wanted, a lager that doesn't suck, great job guys this beer just earned a spot in my beer fridge.","StoutHunter","Sep 03, 2012"

Can't comment on the appearance since I drank it straight from the can so I'll just assume and rate it good. Smell is sort of "beery" typical lager smells. Flavor has a nice grassiness followed by malt and lager yeast. This must have been pretty fresh. Honestly though I would never but this beer at a store because its completely overpriced at $9 per four pack. This needs to be in six packs of 12oz cans for like $8. not sure why anyone in Colorado would ever pick this up over OB Mama's Lil Pils...","ArrogantB","Sep 02, 2012"

3.51,-2.5,4,3,3.5,4.5,3.5,"Shift Pale Lager pours a crystal clear orange, with some tangerine and lemon highlights coming through. There's a little more than a finger of white foam, with decent head retention and lacing for the style. The nose is a bit on the dull side, but there is some soft grainy sweetness apparent, along with a light aroma of melon from the Nelson Sauvin hops. The flavor starts of similarly, with lightly bready malt notes. The bitterness that flows through next is perceptible, but just barely. Again, the fruity melon finish is very mild. The craft beer hophead in me wishes is was a bit more "in your face", but as is it works decently as part of an easy drinking lager. The body has just a little bit of sturdyness to it, and the carbonation is pleasantly active. The overall impression of the mouthfeel is definitely very crisp. I was really excited to try Shift Pale Lager because I'm a big fan of Nelson Sauvin hops. Having only had them in hop forward IPAs before, I think my expectation of how hoppy this beer would be could have been a little more tempered.

Their Belgian style Tripel & Dubble are very good and a bargain compared to an expensive imported bomber of the same. So why go head to head with the Buds and PBR’s of the world? The Shift has a darker golden color and a nice billowy head. The aroma of malt and hops is pleasing and indicative of a handmade product vs. the more industrial notes you get from more mass produced products. Good flavor with some bitterness up front, then thinning out into a clean aftertaste. More body than the standard American Adjunct Lager, but still light enough to be easy drinking. So yes, the Shift is a better brew than any of the mass produced lagers from the big brewers. I expected as much from New Belgium, and they delivered. But $9 for four tall boys? The Shift is not that much better than a PBR or a Bud. New Belgium made it big with Fat Tire, which is worth the premium over a Bud if you are in the mood for a good ale vs. a light lager. But if you want a light lager will you pay a premium for a Shift? Not in my book.","iSip","Jun 28, 2012"

The flavors also seem a bit stronger than the aroma would lead you to think. Mouthfeel/body is light, it's a bit slick and very easy to drink. Good carbonation.

This is followed by a mild honeyed, toasty, bruleed-sugar malt character. The mid-palate, though, completely vanishes - watery and empty, there's a shocking lack of flavor here. A modest mineral character is present, which complements the hop profile. Drying on the finish with a blend of toast, light bitterness and mild citrus flavors. Light in body with a medium-high carbonation that works, and despite the watery mid-palate, the hops provide just enough resin character to tie the palate together. Solid, definitely worthy.","DefenCorps","Jun 20, 2012"

Color was a deep golden-yellow with NE-quality clarity and both King Midas and Croesus called to express their jealousy. Sorry, fellas, but you gotta score your own CAN, dig? I recently listened to Greg Koch rail against fizzy yellow beers (again) and all I CAN say is, more for me! The nose made me weep for what Prohibition has wrought. One adverse aspect of The CANQuest (TM) has been the plethora of AALs from a CAN and I have more than had my fill of them, although there is no end in sight. This smelled not just of the expected malt sweetness, but there were also hops readily evident on the nose! Be still, my heart. Mouthfeel was full, almost creamy, with a wonderful intermingling of biscuit malt initially, followed by a brief rush of minty hops on the tongue. Finish was quite dry with the biscuit malt and hops combination acting nicely in tandem. Great Caesar's Ghost, but this is definitely cooler-worthy and just in time for summer!

Palate though had some soft malt sweetness, but then also this quasi-ureic quality that was off-putting, but also not clearly a flawed or ruined example (it wasn't lightstruck, infected, etc.).

Tastes are sharp and clean, with fruity characteristics - maybe apple juice or white grape juice, grain, sweet, with some herbal/grassy/earthy hops to help balance it out.
