"O: I found this in a bottle shop marked down heavily, so I figured 'what the hell?' Although a dubbel is usually a style that can withstand some time, this is on the smaller side of the spectrum at 7% abv, and over a year past its best by date. So it isn't a prime candidate for cellaring, nor did the brewers intend it to be. This bottle was definitely on the decline, but it's still hard to imagine it being much more than mediocre even within prime freshness. Take my review with a grain of salt, should this beer ever come back around. It wasn't intended to be consumed in this condition, so it may be worth a look."

"Pours a slightly murky dark orange with a 1/2 inch fizzy khaki head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Tiny dots of lace slowly drip into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is of balsalmic vinegar, malt, and some dark fruit aromas. Taste is pretty sour with malt, dark fruit, and vinegar flavors all mingled together. There is an acidic quality that lingers on the tongue after each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty poor beer that is definitely having some sort of issues. It's not all that undrinkable but I doubt the brewer was going for this in the final product."
"O: This beer donâ€™t have a strong malt body compared to other beers in the style and could have used a little sweetness."
"O: Easy enough to drink but not one of my favorite beers, I think you could have more than one of these in a session but I might not personally. Seems like the malts are a little more hidden than I would prefer."

"Full Sail products are known for their ability to please the palate and to offer enough taste to be acceptable to most anyone without going to extremes. Full Sail Sanctuary fits this description quite nicely, with some good nice, pleasant taste characteristics that, while not the greatest in class, are still good enough to make the beer worthy of a try."

"i enjoyed this for what it was, a pretty simple, basic dubbel, nothing really worth coming back to. but it was very drinkable."

"ken's bottle."

"Overall kinda meh, quite fruity, lots of esters as expected, somewhat typical Belgian yeast components but a bit too much in a lot of aspects."
"Overall this is not a bad beer but nothing special. Worth a try at $2.49 for a bomber."
""
""
"O: a moderate example, would struggle to hold its own against finer Belgian examples (St. Bernardus). A bit of alcohol warmth, but generally not bad, just a middle of the road example."
""
"too clean: fermented too cool? boring yeast? overattenuated?"

"CONCLUSION: I think the only reason to hate on this beer would be if you grabbed it out of the fridge and knocked it back without letting it warm. True to the delicate, Belgian style, this needs to warm up to about 50 or else everything will be very muted and flat. The biggest downer for this beer, for me, is it's drinkability. Basically, it's like drinking a yeasty winter warmer. And if a winter warmer is too sweet and rich it can be a challenge to drink 22 ounces--which is exactly the case here. This is an example of a beer that belongs in a 6-pack, not a 22. It tastes great but a 22oz just gets to be too rich for one person towards the end."

"OK, YOU CAN DO BETTER!"

"A rather confusing offering from Full Sail. Noting really seemed to gel. The pieces for this beer are there, just not the unified whole one would hope for. Would I drink it again. Sure, but I'd be much more inclined to check out other beers if given a choice."

"Poured amber with a small cap of white head. Bready aroma with a blend of sugars and malts. Taste of caramel malts, brown sugar, bready yeast, notes of fruit esters, and light spice, gentle hoppage. Medium body, slightly chewy, an average, moderately drinkable brew overall."
"Underwhelming dubbel, neither bad nor great."

"Presentation: Packaged in a twenty-two ounce brown glass bomber with a pop-off crown, served in a standard Pilsener glass."
"O - Nice beer. Certainly not great, but for $3.49 a bomber its definitely something I would pick up again. I have been pleasantly surprised with the specials from Full Sail for the most part, and this is no exception."

"jd"
"Overall this is a pretty good dubbel that was worth buying and drinking. Not anything special but worth the price."
"All in all I think it's a solid above average dubbel."
""
"Overall: While not inherently bad, it is quite lacking all around, never hitting all the right dubbel notes."
""
"Full Sail did an adequate job with Sanctuary. It also sells at Full Sail prices, at $3.99 for the bomber; a relief given even domestic dubbels are selling at twice that price! This might be a good one to break a newbie into the world of dubbels."
"Nice belgian yeast, cinnamon and dark fruit are forefront in the flavor. Not overly complex, but the dubbel flavor is surprisingly well done here. There have been a few Full Sail bombers that are really nice, especially for the price. This one is up there, Id be more than happy to buy a few more bottles."
"Overall this is an average interpretation of the style. The spice character is a bit heavy and the medicinal qualities really hurt the flavor. Kind of a mess that needs more balance."
"Poured from the bottle with a modest egg white head that after settling still managed to easily cover the surface of the beer and slid off the glass surface with no hint of lacing. A hazy red amber beer with light belgian hop and straw aroma. A pleasing mouthfeel with plenty of carbination up front, a malty farmhouse burst, followed by lemon citrus hop finish. I thought it was good for it's style, although the 7% for a Belgian dubbel was low."
"D - Simple and quaffable enough!"
"Slightly above-average American-made dubbel, but the toffee and bitterness quickly clobber the other flavors going on."
"The alcohol comes through with a few sips. I don't get this - why a reserve? Is this really a dubbel? Not up to what I expect from Full Sail."
"Overall: The body of the beer is medium and the finish is medium. This beer does a fair showing for a dubbel style. More from this beer is needed to resurrect it from doom."
"Overall nothing extremely special, slightly sweet full bodied drinker. It's smoothness is its best quality. Flavors are nice and subtle yet not enough and nothing to write home about."
"O - Didn't really like this one. The flavors are all there they just seem a bit watered down. The mouth feel is the same way. Too light and very little carbonation. This is disappointing because the pour looked decent. Not recommended. Only 5 dollars for the bomber. It was still drinkable. Not a complete loss."
"Great beer!"
"Rich, malty aroma has notes of caramel and brown sugar and just a hint of apple. It pours a clear dark coppery brown with a thick and rather fluffy cream head. Malty flavor has notes of caramel, apple and pear with hints of chocolate and toffee. Smooth, full-bodied texture has a fair amount of fizz and leaves a very satisfying finish."
"O: Good tasting and easy drinking. There's better Belgian stuff on the shelves for a comparable price, but still a nice effort."
"Sanctuary isn't a world class dubbel, but there's no major missteps. This brew is a bit light all the way around. The lightness adds to the drinkability with out detracting too much from the complexity. Props to Full Sail for tackling a dubbel properly."
"Clear dark reddish orange with thin white head that fades instantly with nothing left on the glass. Smell: lots of caramel, metallic, a little black pepper. Taste: caramel, mild medicinal hopping, a little alcohol, a bit fruity but mostly just sugar. The flavor and mouthfeel are not enough, like they whiffed on their target gravity. Meh is the operative reaction here. 2011 release."
"D/O - pretty good, since it's a bit lighter than the average dubbel. And it's really affordable. It's not my favorite (nor is it my least favorite) of the style, but the price is right on this one, so I'm glad I got it. If you like dubbels, you'll probably feel the same way. If you want to have a dubbel on a budget, this beer is a great pick."
"Not a lot of complexity or strong flavors, but I'm suprised just how clean and drinkable this is. This is not a mind-blowing dubbel but it's solid, enjoyable, and refreshing."
"O - generally a disappointment, makes me wondering if I happened across a bad batch or an old bottle, but I can only review from my experience either way"
"O - Overall, I must admit I was thoroughly disappointed in this one. I think it even turned my stomach off, making it difficult to continue our beer tasting extravaganza."
"I can't fit this into the Dubbel category, so I have to give it a lower rating for that. However, it's not at all bad, just gets into insipid territory."
"O - Overall this is a pretty good beer and to style its easy drinking with a good taste if you like Dubbels this is worth picking up if you see it"
"Consumed: 9/28"
"Overall it wasn't a bad beer, but it didn't really strike me a standout for style that has some definite heavy hitters. The tastes were a little to in-your-face for my liking; I tend to appreciate more complex flavors and maltiness in dubbels."
"D: Very easy to drink. I would drink this again, but I don't know if I'd look for it specifically."
"Drink: A good stepping stone into the style. For the price, worth a try."
"Not a terribly unpleasant beer, but outside of the pleasant aromas, nothing really going for it either. Not a beer that I would make a return."
"D: Give it as a gift. Dont waste your time."
"Drinkability: A nice interpretation of a dubbel that IS available in Utah."
"Drinkability - quite a drinkable brew. Good- and interesting-tasting, somewhat complex and a fun experience."
"overall a solid american attempt at the style...ive had better and a lot worse....thanks james for this bottle"
"Warm it up! So much better closer to winter room temperature. Pours slightly hazy amber with off-white head. Nose on the sweet side, so to speak, with dessert aromas of caramel pecan pie and a biscuity quality. Rather sweet on the palate, again caramel, andleads to a lengthy sweet finish. Very muted flavors when cold. Minimal hops."
"I'm a big Full Sail fan and this brew was pleasant and easy-drinking enough, but not a memorable dubbel by any means."
"Fiery scarlet red body. Thin beige head leaves adequate amounts of lace as I drink. Malty aromas of caramel and nougat accompany some sweet candy like tones on the nose. A little raisin and sherry as well. Malty and somewhat rich on the buds. A little fig and raisin thing going on. Decent enough flavor. Body is light medium and the alcohol is present only slightly in the flavor."
"Not a great dubbel compared to the traditional Belgian brands, but a nice American version."
"Split a bomber with a couple friends. This is an interesting take on the style. At first from the aroma I would have guessed this was more of a barleywine from the fruity malt. As it warmed, the aroma became more rummy and the flavor reminded me a bit of dark spiced rum from the additional phenols. There was also some of the early fruit and berries character. It was a smooth mix of fruit and spice, but my one complaint is that the forced carbonation throws off the mouthfeel."
"d= very enjoyable"
"Drinkability: very easy to drink but flavorwise it is a bit thin. Not as malty as I prefer."
"Drinkability is good, heck for the price and an American example of the style say its pretty damn good. Might not be world class but worth a try, even three or four tries."
"Perhaps this could use some time to mellow but there's not to much redeemable in this one. Not wholly complex or enjoyable, this just seemed like a simple dubbel with a fairly hoppy/ bitter profile. The bottle says it's lightly hopped... perhaps for Full Sail it is but it really stuck with you over the malt flavors. The mouthfeel is akin to a saison or a sharply carbonated summer beer. Definitely not the most enjoyable beer for this style but not bad."
"All else aside, this beer is extremely drinkable and enjoyable. I almost wish they had not dubbed it a Belgian style Dubbel and just let it stand on it's own without a style guideline."
"Overall, this is a decent beer, better than I honestly expected from this brewery. certainly worth trying when you see it."
"Flavor: Sour sweetness from a heavy malt backbone. Some drinks had a sharp alcoholic spike at the finish."
"D: This was good but not great, more like a doppelbock than a dubbel to me. It had a decent smell and taste and body, but there was nothing bold or complex or unique about it. The alcohol was noticeable, but it wasn't difficult to drink. Passable but not recommended."
"22oz bottle $4, affordable as always which is nice. Clear amber in color, looks like Fat Tire, what a blast from the past. Smells odd, malty, Belgian? Who knows? I don't care but the taste was odd, malt biscuit, a tad bit of belgian yeast but I was hoping for something more here. What, hell if I know...."
"Poured into a chalice a very nice golden brown color, nice carbonation, nice one-finger creamy off-white head, with some sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, with some nice yeast notes, figs, raisins, plums. The taste is sweet, malty, nice yeast note, very nice notes of figs, risins, plums. Medium body. Drinkable, this is a very tasty Dubbel from FS, recommended."
"Drinkability: I feel like this beer will be overly-penalized in score by the low-performing aroma, but I guess them's the breaks. I think this is quite a drinkable little American dubbel; I'd have this again if I were in the mood for the style and had no Belgian varieties around."
"There is no way that Sanctuary is even in the same league as a Belgian dubbel, I'm sorry to say. The flavor is not very pushy, and more dry than sweet. The fruits are mild, with no more than a hint of brown sugar and spicing. Bittering is high for style, easily forgivable in a more enticing brew overall. Biscuity, and not very complex. Finishes with a hint of cherry, but not enough of anything: malt, flavor, panache, booze. Try this recipe again."
"D: Pretty good beer. Full sail should do more Belgian style beers, both Ive had (vesuvius and sanctuary) have been very solid."
"d - Wasn't a huge fan of this one. It smelled decent, but something about the taste was offputting to me. Wouldn't purchase again."

"I wouldn't want to drink more than a 22 oz bottle of this at a time, primarily because it is such a sweet beer, it seems like I would get too used to it and not enjoy it like I should."
"Overall an okay beer. Maybe I would have enjoyed it better had it been labeled a weisenbock or doppelbock because that's more what it seems."
"D: Decent, but Ommegang Abbey Ale is so much and comparably priced. This brew is a pretty big let-down from such a solid, consistent brewery."
"Other comments: For a beer calling itself a dubbel, this misses the mark a bit. I expect a bolder flavor from the yeast and from the malt profile. This did not give me that."
"Drinkability is pretty dam good. A tasty double that isn't overblown, it's got that belgian digestibility that makes it slide down too quickly. A little better then the sum of it's part's, a very impressive offering by Full Sail."
" Body is smooth but not quite creamy, and certainly not sticky. Maybe just a little too thin for a dubbel. This is a nicely drinkable ale, with definite Belgian characteristics, but it's still a bit far from being an authentic dubbel."
"D: No to bad, try it but I wouldnt seek it out"
"D- Very drinkable. Everyone. This is a great brew, it may be too sweet to pour into 6 packs. if tweeked, maybe, but I like it as it is, and Id be happy to enjoy a few 22's over the course of the evening."
"22 oz from Fred Meyer. S.Salem. Amber, clear ale with a thick,frothy light tan head. Nice bready,cereal aromas from the malts, a bit doughy and earthy, some bubble gum actually quite pleasing. Sweet malty /banan/bubble gum flavours dominate..gets dryer near the end of the mouthful. OK palate thin side makes this drinkable. Overall not a great Dubbel but i rather enjoyed it."
"Poured into snifter. Pours clear and amber with creamy head and good retention, not a ton of lacing. Smell is of some biscuit malt and some dark fruit, almost a bit of cherries. Taste has that biscuit malt with some yeast, again dark fruit with a bit of sweetness to it. Pretty dry feel to it, not too heavy nut definitely full in the mouthfeel. Overall a decent beer."
"4/3.5/3.5/3.5/4"
