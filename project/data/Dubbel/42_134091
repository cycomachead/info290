4.19,8.5,4.25,4,4.25,4.25,4.25,"O - this is an exceptional dubbel and the best new beer to come from Ommegang in some time. Not that others have been bad, but this packs so much uniqueness and keeps to dubbel tradition while it's quality is top shelf. The best of this series I've had thus far and I wouldn't mind seeing this getting a yearly seasonal bottling.","BradtheGreat7","Apr 01, 2015"

3.94,2.1,4,3.75,4,4,4,"Delightful beer. It is gorgeous in the glass - full of promise and mystery. The aroma is a bit of a letdown for me - a bit thin, a mix of yeast and fruit basket. The flavour, however, is delightful and multilayered. Caramel, cherry, cola and a bit of vanilla pop up in various places on the palate. The mouthfeel and finish are exactly what you hope for in a Dubbel - fizzy, slightly boozy and warming. Add the Game of Thrones reference and you have the full package. Winter is coming!","Bunman3","Mar 28, 2015"

3.83,-0.8,4,4,3.75,3.75,3.75,"A dark burnished copper that is full of reddish highlights and even a gentle pour yields a huge persistent layer of foam.  The smell is very vinous with many notes of dark fruit a little bit of dark bread, some caramel, a bit of sweetness and some yeast character.  The taste starts out with the caramel and overall the profile is narrower than the aroma would suggest it would be.  Cherry is fairly heavy in the taste as mentioned by other reviewers but I'm not getting as much yeast or malt as is typical from a top notch dubbel.  This beer is very smooth and only a little tingly as there is no significant bitterness and the carbonation while somewhat high is so made up of such fine bubbles that it doesn't detract from the heaviness of the beer.    I think this is a good beer overall not great but quite drinkable and flavorful enough to make it worth a try.","fank2788","Mar 24, 2015"

4.1,6.2,4,4,4,4,4.5,"750 ml bottle into signature tulip glass, bottled on 9/5/2014. Pours slightly hazy deep ruby red color with a 2 finger dense and fluffy light khaki head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lasts. Nice dense soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of caramel, brown sugar, toast, brown bread, nuttiness, raisin, plum, pear, apple, red grape, clove, pepper, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of fruity/spicy yeast, dark/bready malt, and light earthy hop notes; with great strength. Taste of big caramel, brown sugar, toast, brown bread, nuttiness, raisin, plum, pear, apple, red grape, clove, pepper, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Good amount of earthy yeast spiciness and light bready tartness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, brown sugar, toast, brown bread, nuttiness, raisin, plum, pear, apple, red grape, clove, pepper, and herbal/yeast earthiness on the finish for a while. Damn nice complexity, robustness, and balance of fruity/spicy yeast, dark/bready malt, and light earthy hop flavors; with a great malt/yeast balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a very smooth, crisp, and lightly creamy/bready mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is an excellent dubbel style. All around great complexity, robustness, and balance of fruity/spicy yeast, dark/bready malt, and light earthy hop flavors; and very smooth and crisp to sip on for the ABV. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Jan 02, 2015"

The smell was a combination of cherry, brown sugar, and toffee, and deeper whiffs revealed a pungency associated with carbonation.  The taste had a brown sugar flavor featured prominently, this was followed by cherry, and caramel, and finally a bite of carbolic acid.  Basically the smell and the taste were self fulfilling.  The body was chewy, and had a soft, silky feel to it.  This was a quality Dubbel, but as a special release, it was a bit too ordinary.","rajendra82","Beers"

The palate opens with a blend of buckwheat honey, nutmeg and yeasty spiciness and layers of fruity complexity. Toffee, raisins, plums, caramel, brown sugar, dried apricots and a touch of cocoa are present. Medium full in body with a moderate level of carbonation, there's a long lasting finish of spice and toffee.

Breathe.  Anyway, this stuff pours a rich sienna-ruby topped by a finger or so of khaki foam.  The nose comprises Belgian yeast, stonefruits, light plum, brown sugar, light maple syrup, clove, and a bit of a calvados thing going on in the background.  The taste takes these elements, mixes them together, adds a few liters of water, and emphasizes whatever herbaceous and spicy bitterness and soapiness is present.  It's a strange situation on my tongue, especially considering this process is gradual, with a hint of the fine smell teasing my tongue for an instant before things go sideways.  The body is a lithe medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a fluid feel.  Overall, this dubbel just didn't sit well with me at all.  Judging by the smell, it had some nice ingredients, but the execution (according to my tongue, anyway) didn't match the expectations.  Blargh.","TMoney2591","Nov 29, 2014"

Dubbel's are pretty hard to impress me (I consider myself an IPA man) but this beer definitely stood out. Ommegang has yet to not impress me with each and every creation.

I found the aroma to be particularly appealing to my sweet sense - it's apparent that candied sugar and loads of malt will be found in the flavor. Along with that, it tastes primarily of very balanced dark fruit esters. There's a somewhat crisp or spicy element in the background holding together what is wholly a very soft and smooth libation. The finish is pleasantly yeasty, with perhaps a bit of burnt caramel as well. Ultimately, I enjoyed this very much, perhaps even better than the other Ommegang GoT selections in the past.","Neorebel","Nov 08, 2014"

Aromas of tangy fruit and caramel sweetness, with a hint of spice and booze. Bubble gum, apple, pineapple, caramel, fig, hints of licorice, medicinal notes, and roasted characteristics. Interesting blend on the nose. Flavors are a little more spice forward, with cinnamon, nutmeg, all spice, cardamom, and clove, all on a tangy caramel and toffee backbone. More of the fruit phenols kick in, too, including the tropical and stone fruit blends. Pretty rich and tangy sweet all at the same time. The body is mid-range, but kept extremely light by the carbonation. Richly sweet and moderately spiced blend in the aftertaste, which is kept in check by the carbonation. Frothy, effervesced, fairly clean finish. Decent brew.","GarthDanielson","Nov 05, 2014"

Served in a St. Bernardus chalice, the beer pours a reddish/brown color with about a half inch creamy tan head that stayed around a long time.  There's a good amount of lacing.  The brew smells like dark fruit (plums, red grapes), candi sugar, cloves, sweet spices, and caramel.  Taste is similar to the aroma, but there's also some bready malt, cherries, peppery spice and a bit of honey.  It's a good sweet, fruity and spicy brew.  Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's creamy and coating.  It's also well carbonated, the soft carbonation helps make this pretty easy to drink.  I liked this brew a lot, and it's my favorite of the Ommegang Game of Thrones beers made so far.  Definitely worth a try!","bluejacket74","Oct 31, 2014"

Some yeastiness and breadiness, caramel, spice, hint of clove, some subtle fruits. The taste is good. Actually a hint of dryness to it. Good caramel malt body, some peppery spice, faint fruits, a faint roastiness. A good brew!","Boto","Oct 19, 2014"

4.09,6,3.75,4,4.25,4,4,"Poured into a Gulden Draak tulip. Pours a hazy, medium orange amber with a twon finger tan head with good retention and lots of lacing. Aroma of sweet bready and candi malt, fresh dark stone fruit,Belgian yeast, root spices. Flavor is mildly caramel malt, plums, figs, dates, brown sugar, clove and pepper. Finishes with a slight, but appropriate astringent bitterness fromt the spices. Medium bodied with peppery active carbonation. A very nice spicy dubbel and easily the best of this series. I was somewhat underwhelmed by the GoT ales so far, to my surprise because I know what Ommegang is capable of. This is an excellent comestic dubbel that is a bit spicier (some winter warmer elements here), but very Belgian. I liked this a lot.","LiquidAmber","Oct 10, 2014"
