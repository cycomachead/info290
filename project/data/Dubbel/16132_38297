3.11,9.1,3.75,3.25,3,3,3,"Poured from a bottle into a schooner, the beer is a deep, dark, vibrant, ruby-brown coloring with a thin, low profile, off-white head. Aromas of sugary sweetness, roasted nut, tangy caramel, and some old world fruit sweetness. Very heavy and cloying sweetness. Flavors are very sweet forward, with a blast of date, fig, cherry, and berry notes that border on sugary/syrupy. Candi sugar in there, too, making this a real sweet tooth brew. Wow. The body is light, but a bit chewy from all the sweetness. The aftertaste is all the berry and cherry again, and that lingers through the slick, slightly oily finish. This one leans far too sweet and sugary for me, for the style.","GarthDanielson","Feb 07, 2015"

Smells deep like a red wine mild peppery feel with grape peels after being aged on barrels, spicy Belgian yeast strain touch of raisin and apple tartness as well. Flavor is strikingly vinous in nature, grape seeds red wine dry finish with yeast cake dough flavors. A decent amount of acidity can be noted here as well, I'm not getting much hop flavor. Definitely a hybrid Belgian styled dubbel I admire the creativity and I will confess this is not bad at all. Definitely drinkable I will have to compare it to the Red Bridge brew tomorrow, the last gluten free beer I had was utter shit. Yep that brew was the Passover honey beer from Ramapoo Valley. You would have thought they could have pulled of some wine like flavors in their version of a gluten free beer, but sadly that wasn't the case. Mouthfeel does sit a bit heavy some shades of cloying sweetness and acidic dryness with grape tartness and yeast cake powder notes.

2.55,-10.5,3,3,2.5,2.5,2,"This one was the biggest hope of the bunch. A Merchant Du Vin rep told me that it was the best of the three, and that it relied heavily on caramelized sugar for its dubbel character. The color was encouraging, and the aroma was not unlike some standard dubbles with the fruity estery yeasty sweet nose, but then --- CRASH! --- it all went to hell in my mouth. Too much thin phenolic sweetness, the sugar was almost all that revealed itself aside from lightning flashes of fruit and malt flavor that appeared and disappeared so fast that my repeated sips to catch this elusive flavor only amplified my disillusionment. Imagine that, the only somewhat satisfying gluten-free beer most people tell me they like is made by A-B. What an ironic fate. 5.99 per half-liter bottle of this stuff - are you kidding me? It's time for those with gluten intolerances that love beer to quit waiting for the market to find a solution, and start brewing up their salvation at home.","dedrinker","Sep 15, 2007"
3.33,16.8,4,3.5,3.5,2.5,3,"A new brew-line offered to Central Kentucky BA's who prefer gluten-free beers. In fact, this beer fares much better than any other gluten-free beers that I have tried thus far. Starts wit a stable Dubbel look -- Solidly brown with some mohogany, purple colors mixed in, a loosely knit, typical Belgian head and retention, and highly carbonated. Scents deliver a heavy plumb, grape, apple estery quality, along with a sugar / syrup sweetness, and a lot of ferment-type spices. The tastes also deliver heavy, candied fruits found in the aromas. Pile on a deep booze-like flavor, and the brew takes on serious port wine-like flavors, mixed with Mr. Pibb soft drink. Quite nice and flavorful, but lacks depth and complexity. However, as with most gluten-free beers, the body suffers. The beer has a light airiness, that leaves the beer void of texture and depth, yet with a whisp of pepperiness. Finishes with a cola-like flavor","BEERchitect","Beers"
1.87,-34.4,4,2,1.5,1.5,2,"In the glass, this 'All Natural Dubbel Dark Beer' looked like a champ. A rich-looking, cloudy brown, it produced an off-white head of foam that lasted until the last drop, leaving plenty of lacing to coat the inside of my Tripel Karmeliet glass. Unfortunately, those are the last good things I can say about Green's Endeavor. The smell is reminiscent of Asian grass jelly drinks. As far as smells go, this one isn't particularly foul. In fact it is reasonably pleasant, but it is quite off-putting when the drinker knows that it is supposed to be a Belgian dubbel. The taste and mouthfeel are both mediocre at best, watery and tasting like an unsweetened herbal soda more than a beer. The aftertaste is fleeting, but what there is of it is unpleasantly medicinal. The abv is listed at 7%, and I'll give them credit for hiding it well, but that's just lipstick on a pig. And at $6 for a 500 ml bottle, I will not be getting a second one, nor will I accept a freebie. Okay, maybe there is one more good thing I can say about this beer: according to the label, it does NOT contain crustaceans, celery, or sesame seeds. That's a good thing, right?","dholway","0"
