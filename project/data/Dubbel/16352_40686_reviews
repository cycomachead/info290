"3.58/5: Even if it isn't comparable to the best Belgians, it still works well"

"Coffee black color poured from a 12 OZ bottle into a pint glass.  Has a small oft white colored head.  Has a porter flavor.  Not bad at all."

"Very good. Initial scents right off the bat of coffee and chocolate. Smooth middle and slight bitterness at the end."
""

"Pours a slightly viscous deep nearly black with a medium dark tan head. Aroma and Taste is sweet dark toasted malt, Belgian yeast, some notes of dark dried fruit, plums raisins mild bitterness. A medium body, smooth mouth feel on the palate with mild carbonation. Finishes with a sweet dark mild roasted caramel malt, notes of dark dried plummy fruit and raisin a bit of tart Belgian yeast with a mild bitterness on the end. Overall a very nice tasty drinking brew."

"Drinkability: Meditation beer. I savored mine. Well made."
"The alcohol was present after I polished this off but not via the taste and the slight mineral hardness of the water was what lingered in the aftertaste once the yeast, booze, and flavors wore off. If it was possible to brew a mountain-style beer without the grain and with a good European influence, it would taste a lot like this. Not anything to rush out and buy but those looking for a ""light Dubbel"" would be wise to start here. There was enough to like here without an overriding sweetness and this stayed true to form from start to finish. Fun stuff!"

"O- well constructed and easy to drink, doesn't compare to the world class Belgian examples but definitely worth a try"

"Very pleasant and tasty. A good winter warmer."

"Pours into a chalice a burnt orange infused lighter aber shade with a creamy off white head that leaves a nice full ring of lace as it settles.Alot of dark fruit in the nose along with a bit of caramel toffee and mild phenol spice.A little yeasty on the palate with a decent amount of clove spice to go along with alcohol dipped dark fruit and some breadiness in the finish.Not bad maybe a little heavy heanded in the yeast flavors but it's a nice sipping dubbel."

"O-Overall great beer was quite surprised. This the first beer I've had by BMB very impressed."

"I wanted to put together a Virginia-heavy box for a trade, so I picked up a sixer of this, with the convenient ulterior motive of being able to try it myself. It pours a clear golden-garnet (there's a combination for ya!) topped by a half-finger of off-cream foam. The nose comprises Belgian candi sugar, light fig, graham cracker, a pinch of clove, and an undercurrent of dark tobacco. The taste does away with the greenery and maintains the rest on cruise control. There's an addition of some extra clove and a hint of banana peel, as well. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a slick feel. Overall, a subpar dubbel, one that lacks a lot of yeasty characteristics I enjoy from the style, and one that just comes across too muddled for its own good."

"Pours a deep brown with a decent head that persists a bit. Minimal lacing on the glass walls. Aroma is sweet - Belgian candi sugar and maybe a hint of caramel. Fairly light on the tongue for a dubbel. Flavor is pleasant with sweet flavors dominating from front to back - candi sugar maybe on the front and a hint of chocolate on the back."

"O: Nice amounts of complexity and traditional Dubbel flavors are present in this brew and the alcohol is pretty well hidden in most aspects. I enjoyed this brew and would suggest that it is worth trying for most folks. I like the spice elements with the cinnamon and clove, though I might have detected a hint of cardamon but that was really buried in the aftertaste and well after I finished the beer."

"Not bad, a little sweet for the style, but decent flavors all around."
""
"Overall - I think this is a very good American attempt at a complicated to duplicate Belgian style. I tip my hat to Blue Mountain. I thought this was quite impressive effort and well crafted."
""
"O - Blue Mountain's Evil 8 is a tasty and drinkable dubbel style ale. It's not a true dubbel, but is well worth your time and effort. A nice six-pack to pick up."

"O: Goes down easy, very tasty, somewhat filling, decent kick, nice representation of style. Not a typical Dubbel, and not what I expected, but was surprising pleased and could have easily had a few more of these."
"O: Certainly different from any other Dubbel that I've tried, it is not very true to the Belgian-style flavor profile. The malts are really darkly roasted, the brew is generously hopped. It's like a Belgian, an IPA and a stout had a love child. Not great by any means, but good and worth checking out."
"Not very drinkable. Aftertaste of bitter oatmeal. Tastes worse the more you drink."
"Pours a rich chestnut brown with minimal rings of off-white lacing. Scent is yeasty with notes of prune, fig and peppery spice, brown sugary sweetness. Taste starts off sweet and bready, dark fruits come through along with mild notes of roast, finishes with a good bit of peppery spice. Medium bodied, lightly coating sweetness. A nice beer that differs from other dubbels in a few different areas."
"O: A very good beer. Probably a better beer than it is an example of a belgian dubbel. Taste is right on for this and I appreciate that they resisted adding too much caramely sweetness that seems to be the achilles heel of american dubbels. However, they obviously do not bottle condition (as evidenced by the lack of yeast sediment). Also, would appreciate more carbonation to be a true dubbel. Given these criticisms, still a very pleasant beer and worthy of drinking more in the future."
"It's the best VA beer I've tried so far. It's fine, but here's me hoping that there's better out there"
"O=Great. Probably the pinnacle of the current Blue Mountain lineup, and an excellent beer all around."
"Overall: Overall the beer was a nice drinking beer with a strong Abby sweet flavor to it. With a litter bit more of a bitter flavor this beer could have gone to a higher level. Overall, it's a decent Belgian style beer."
"d - A nice Belgian style dubbel. Some nice spices and dark fruits in the nose and taste. Would have again."
"The Evil 8 is a fine dubbel ale that earns it's best rating from me for the smell. It smells lovely off the tap and teh aroma brings a very satisfying drinking experience. That being said I think more than 2 or 3 of these in an evening would be way too much for me. The Evil 8 carries a light head and laces a little in the glass. The taste is certainly Belgian but not too overwhelming. I think it is a good entry to the world of American made Belgian style beers. I look forward to enjoying it at home in the bottle as well. Overall another winner from Blue Mountain."
"Totally drinkable and blends in the alcohol and malt profile beautifully."
"Medium bodied with an odd combination of flavors for the style. Srprisingly hoppy with sme bread/yeast flavor that I wasn't expecting. Slightly tart/sour with a prominent dark fruit flavor and a dry finish. Hints of dark cherry, plum, raisin nd fig as well as some candy sugar and alcohol sweetness. The odd bitterness lingers throughout although it becomes less prominent toward the end of the swallow when the fruit and alcohol flavors become evident. There's also an unpleasant medicinal cough syrup flavor that I find really off-putting."
"F: Finishes still mostly sweet, a hint of dryness. More of the lingering bitterness and weird briny tastes that I can't really describe otherwise. They both seem to peak on the finish too and overpower almost everything else. Not much left in the way of fruits, but I do get hints of leftover syrupy sticky caramel, molasses, and candi sugar."
"So, okay, not exactly a doppelganger for the real Belgian dubbel, but a cool American approximation. All but the most insane style-fascists will get something out of this. How is it I've lived in Virginia for 9 years and am just discovering this rather excellent brewery? (Rhetorical question, people...I don't expect you to have the answer. I sure don't.)"
"pours a deep redish brown. tan head, smells of roasted malt, fruit, and some light medicinal notes. tastes of thick roasted malty goodness, chocolate covered fruit and toffee. the mouthfeel is a little too affected by the the carbonation. I like my dubbels smoother, but this is a solid american rendition. not too shabby. I'd drink it again. I do hope they make some improvements though. IT has a ton of potential to be much better. Bottle conditioning might help..."
"4.0 D: Not a bad brew. Great interpretation of an earthier dubbel."
"D: I had this on-tap at the brewery yesterday but liked this bottle more -- probably because cooler as I don't think this beer is bottle-conditioned. Very tasty dubbel. Now that I know they aren't bottle conditioned, I will dig in here and there for sure as this is a nice treat."
"A solid dark brown color with a full tan fine bubbled head and lots of lace. The aroma is spiced apple cider with a subtle malt undercurrent. The flavor offers more nutmeg cinnamon on top of a crisp but malty apple cider base. Maybe a hint of clove with burnt sugar / carmel. It's smooth, a spritzy mid-bodied brew. Pretty drinkable and unique from my experience. There is a biscuit hop that grows near the end. Very enjoyable. Another thanks to Ohoove!"
"Drinkability: While not among the Belgian greats for the style, this presents a nice American hoppy twist; quite enjoyable"
"drinkability: good"
"Pour a dark reddish, muddy brown with a 1.5-finger white head that stayed forever and left lace down the glass. Had a strong, yeasty smell that overpowered a strong sweet malt presence (caramel, brown sugar) and light fruit notes like orange. A heavy malt taste like bread, caramel, syrup, makes for a fuller, sticky body that goes down somewhat chunky thanks to some spices and sour fruit tastes. This is a somewhat hard beer to describe; it has all the necessary components of a dubbel and is good but not great. I enjoyed it but wouldn't say it's worth seeking out."
"Overall- A good nightcap type of beer. Very sweet though."
"This was solid. Nothing really earth shattering in the flavor department, but I did like that this was a little more hop forward than you would expect for the style. A pleasant sipper."
"D- This bad boy is heavy but light on abv. It is very filling and one or two of these would be enough but you wouldnt be drunk. Id buy a sixer of this for a weekend."
"If this is your style, then this iw well, well worth a try."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable. Its really fun. Its not even close to great compared to really good Belgian or Amero-Belgian dubbles, but its a really cool interpretation from a brewery that likes hops so much that they grow their own. Another nice brew from a nice brewery that I'm glad is close to me."
"This is a good representation of the style though there are some interesting malt and hop characteristics that are not too common with a dubbel. I'd definitely recommend this to folks as it's an interesting take on the style."
"Very drinkable if you appreciate a hops presence in a Dubbel."
"Edit: Very nice Belgian funky burps!"
"A good representation of a Belgian Dubbel not the best but a solid one at that I drink it again and say it is worth the try. One is enough at a sitting due to the heat on this one"
"Drinkability: There's a more rough-around-the-edges aspect of this brew that I just can't get around. It's almost over-hopped or there was some kind of charred or roasted malt that was used that doesn't seem to let the seemingly authentic Belgian flavor through. Glad I only got a single bottle overall. Maybe some age will do something?"
"Nicely crafted take on the style. Well balanced and tasty without anything crazy going on."
"12oz bottle forgotten in a beer box from a previous trip to Virginia poured into a Corsendonk tulip. This one pours a dark muddy brown that shows some ruby highlights when held to light. The beer is topped by a nice frothy khaki head that lasts and leaves beautiful lacing. Aroma is a great amount of dried fruits and brown malts with a touch of spice and molasses. The taste is a nice blend of dark malts, dried fruits and spice with slight coffee and bitter cocoa. The beer is medium bodied with well hidden alcohol. This one surprised me, I'm not a huge fan of the style unless the mood hits, and am especially not a huge fan of American brewed ones, but this one was quite respectable."
"single bottle from Grape & Gourmet, Virginia Beach, VA...I've really been enjoying Blue Mountain's stuff since they started making it around the northern part of the state, and look forward to visiting the brewery sometime in the near future"
"I'd say this should be at the end of your tasting session to keep from thrashing your taste buds."
"Nice aroma of floral and spice lets me know it is a Belgian style; but taste is more malty and there is plenty of bitterness at the end. Everything in balance, very drinkable: perhaps to much so for the alcohol, so is that the Evil part?"
"D: I enjoy the fact that this dubbel is more hoppy than the usual style; so for me personally, it goes down real smooth and compliments most of my richer cuisine."
"Notes from 2/25/08"
"Pours a dark, oily brown, almost black, like exceptionally rich coffee. Little in the way of head. It has a strong porter-like malt backbone and aroma, with hints of chocolate, raisins, and red wine on the tongue. It has a light phenolic character and a rich, satisfying mouthfeel that grabs the tongue from start to finish. A very good beer that would be a perfect match with a robust meal of beef or pork."
"I poured this nice beer into my tumbler at 50 degrees. The beer had a hellacious head that was fluffy and tan. The lacing was really good as was the smell though I could not describe it. The taste was roasted and malty and very nice. I would buy this again for sure."
"Overall, I felt this was a nicely balanced Belgian-Style Dubbel and my hat is off to brewmaster Taylor Smack."
"Drinability is good its enjoyable enough wouldn't replace my St. Bernardus but worth a shot in my opinion."
"D-Nice representation of style made with a real Trappist yeast strain. A quality American version of this Belgian style."
"Drinkability is fine for what it is - it's a sipper, but most Dubbels are, and although this one isn't a standout example of the style, it's a good attempt."
"D: This is a good effort from this newcomer brewery... perhaps not quite as spectacular as their others, but still a decent abbey-style ale, nonetheless. For its class, it has quite the competition, but it comes out alright. I'm glad I got 6, and look forward to it again on tap, as well."
