"33cl bottle served in a tulip.  20/08/11 printed on the back label. Pours a mahogany hue with a slightly murky clarity and a dense, three inch, cream-colored head that eventually settles into a rocky, half inch cap leaving delicate, textured spatters of lacing in its wake.  Nose expresses raisins, figs, prunes and yeast.  Taste consistent with nose; however, there's a definite candied fruit quality added to the mix.  Also, as the beer warms, some tannic notes are revealed as well as a cold-brewed tea character at the  finish.  Mouthfeel is light-medium in body (but closer to light) with a mild, even carbonation.  Overall, this may be my favorite dubbel.  Great complexity and flavor and I almost get a cotton candy character in the flavor profile.  Truly top notch."
"I can't fault this beer to style.  I tend to like my Belgian Strongs a bit drier, but this was very easy to drink and enjoyable.  Worth a try!"
""
""
""
""
"I have to be honest, I do not particularly like this beer.  It is a decent representation of the style, but far from something I would buy again, especially at the price this beer goes for (about $6 a bottle)."

"The bottle gushed when opened (it wasn't shaken or disturbed prior to opening), but got most of the bottle poured into the glass. The overall lasting impression was of the boozy burn and phenolic character. Some decent caramel malt flavor and feel were evident, along with a ripe fruit tone, but ultimately the beer seemed a bit out of balance and thin in the depth department. Not bad but hardly stunning."

"Overall not a bad Bruin I would appreciate a little more sweetness but it does the trick for what I wanted today."
""

"Okay beer, a bit more on the malty side rather than yeasty (bread). Small sting of alcohol in it. Not thick and syrupy. Not my favourite trappist."

"Medium full body with above average carbonation, warming."

"A solid Belgian dubbel with malt, dark fruit and caramel flavors dominating. Those monks are doing it right."

"2nd Edit: And the title of best Trappist has fallen to Rochefort 8, still don't let that dissuade you from this one."

"Final Grade: 4.28, a superb A-. While dubbels are probably my least favourite of the various trappist styles, Achel 8° Bruin is one example that I am finding very easy to enjoy. Well-balanced, with barely a peep from the alcohol content; this is the sort of brew that comes highly recommended to any and all Belgian beer enthusiasts. Is it the finest trappist beer in the world? Probably not, but that doesn't mean I won't be seeking out more of this at some point - hopefully to cellar."

"O: gotta be one of the best Trappist ales I've had - looks, flavor - just damn refined and fantastic"

"Overal a very good dubbel/dark ale."

"Really excellent beer here. The boozey and yeasty character are there but behind the wonderfully complex fruity/spice character. Very rich and interesting. Little bad to say about this beer, a solid interpretation, lively and complex at the same time, with a really nice and pleasing character. Paired very nicely with a rich aged cheddar."
""
""
""
""
"Overall - A very nice Belgian that almost seems like a bit of a cross between a strong dark ale and a Dubbel. Definitely improves as it warms and I'm likely to try this one again while it's in stores."
""
""
"I am a fan of Belgian dubbels. Westmalle has always been my favorite and has been the standard by which I measure dubbels. Well...this is damn close. A fine dubbel that would stand with any. Get it if you can."
""
"33cl bottle into a goblet. Reddish brown with a three finger head that comes down to half a finger. The smell has sweet roasted malts, raisins and a hint of alcohol in it. Quite a sharp first taste that is followed by caramel malt and raisins. Not too sweet though. The aftertaste is dry and a bit bitter with some grapefruit and coffee in it. The alcohol doesn't come through on the taste. Medium body with pretty high carbonation. Feels creamy on the tongue. Overall a really pleasant looking beer with a great taste."

"Among the 12 brews tasted was; Achel 8% Brune Dubbel from Trappist. Although not a real high alcohol beer at just 8% , it did finishing 11th with an average rating of 3.56. It is possible that something was wrong with this bottle, maybe age. Can not read the date code for the year."
""
"Mais uma dubbel de respeito. Equilibrada e suave. Muito condizente com o estilo, tanto que eu teria muitas dificuldades em discernir a diferença entre ela e a Westmalle dubbel. Acredito que ambas são muito parecidas. Achel é outra cervejaria de peso, com rótulos sensacionais."

"Overall: A fantastic Trappist dubbel that I would highly recommend to anyone. Great experience for a decent price. Cheers."

"Overall: a great double. It is to me a typically dark trappiste. Westmalle dubbel and Rochefort beers are really similar in aromas."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall not too bad, I'm glad I tried it. The flavor is a bit has a bit too much dark grain bitterness, but otherwise a good beer."

"A very well made Trappist Dubbel. Complex and very easy drinking."
""
""
""
"Overall- another delightful dubbel..."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-I am surprised by how much I enjoyed this beer. I like my dubbels on the sweeter side and this brew delivers that sweetness I enjoy, but it also provides just enough balance in the finish to keep things interesting and prevent that syrupy/cloying feeling. I also think the feel is close to perfect and the alcohol, while noticeable in the smell, is concealed well on the palate."
""
"O: A great example of Belgian trappist, with a quite complex flavor and still a smooth beer despite it's 8,0% ABV which can make this a tasteful trap if you drink too much! Great beer!"
""
""
"D - Lacks a little complexity compared to other top notch dubbels but still very tasty."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I would pick other trappist beers first, but for $2.99 this is a weekly buy. Amazing trappist taste and craftsmanship for a great price, and my bottle says 8% abv however. It has also the bready, dark fruity notes of other trappist, most similar to a Westmalle Dubbel or Rochefort 6 (or even an 8). For the price you can't beat it."
"...and that head is still there!"
""
"As its blond sister, it is a trappist with high drinkability, not overly sweet and still rich in flavor."
""
"Overall: A great trappist that tastes even better after 2-year storage. Smooth smokey taste and a nice warm feeling afterwards"
""

"Overall a very nice dubbel that it became even better when it warmed up a bit. Nice, warming feeling from the alcohol, which is not that notable on the taste."
""
""
"Maybe its because its been cellered for 2 years but this is definately a well put together Dubbel."
""
""
"Overall: a bit less sweet than I expected. More bitter, and complext notes of very different kinds of fruits. Really good beer with a unique character. Really enjoying this one!"
"O - Quite good, and definitely worth picking up if you get the chance. I might not go out of my way for it, but I'm glad I have a couple to age."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Nothing outstading. Just plain good stuff, perfectly balanced, definitely an easy drinker for the style"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel- medium-bodied, lively, slight alcohol numbing"
""
""
""
""
""
"O-A solid Trappist ale, comparable to Westmalle, superior in the mouthfeel but lacks the complexity in the nose and taste."
""
"Big thanks goes out to JYounger30 for sending this one as a part of the Birthday BIF! Served from bottle into a Trappist Westvleteren chalice. Poured a deep reddish brown with a two finger off-white head that subsided to one finger very slowly. Maintained phenomenal lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, bread, dark fruit, fruit, and subtle spices. The flavor was of sweet malt, bread, dark fruit, spice, fruit, raisin, and subtle toasted malt. It had a medium feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation (almost creamy). Overall this was a pretty good brew. I really like the components going on in this one in both the flavor and aroma. It was really well balanced and decently complex. If there would have been just a little more going on, this could have definitely been on a whole new level. A really well put together brew that I would suggest to anyone out there."

"Best served a bit warmer to let all the flavor and aromatics pull through"
"Price Point - $5.69/11.2oz bottle"
""
""
""

"Pours a hazy dark brown colour with a medium beige head. Aromas of dried fruits with wood, leather, belgian yeast and som citrus. The flavour is reflecting the aroma and is dominated by the dried fruits, and some alcohol. Has a soft and slick mouthfeel, and a light bitterness. A good trappist ale that feels fresher than other trappist bruins."
""
""
""
""

"O: A very nice dubbel. Most I find are very bland. This has quite a bit of complexity though it is almost purely malt. The nuttiness and toastiness is nice, almost halfway to being a sort of belgian brown ale really. I really enjoyed this one, very tasty, smooth and drinkable."
"I can see why this in one of higher rated dubbel beers. Unique and enjoyable flavors, nice feel and high, but probably dangerous, drinkability. Nice beer."

"330 ml bottle into chalice, best by 8/17/2012. Pours very hazy reddish brown color with a very nice 2 finger fluffy light khaki head with fantastic retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Nice foamy lacing clings to the glass, with a good amount of carbonation streaming up. Aromas of huge raisin, apple, prune, banana, pepper, candi sugar, caramel, earth, and yeast spices. Damn nice aromas with a ton of fruity complexity and nice balance. Taste of raisin, prune, apple, pear, caramel, biscuit, toast, pepper, earth, candi sugar, molasses, and yeast spiciness. Lingering notes of light and dark fruits, bread, pepper, caramel, molasses, pepper, and yeast spices on the finish for a good bit. Great flavor complexity and balance; no cloying flavors at all, very clean finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium body; with a fairly slick and crisp mouthfeel that is very nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with hardly any warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is an outstanding dubbel! Great flavor complexity and balance; extremely crisp and easy to drink. An easy winner, really enjoyed this."

"Review from 3/2010 notes. Poured into a Gulden Draak tulip. Pours a cloudy brown with a big white head that fades but leaves lacing. Complex aroma of dark and light fruit, caramel, Belgian spices. High carbonation. Sweet dark fruits, spice and caramel start and middle with a somewhat bitter metallic finish, probably because of the carbonation. The bitter finish is well balanced. A very nice dubbel. Will be back to revisit this ale."
"Achel Bruin is a fabulous dubbel in the context of the style. It's held up remarkably well with 8% ABV backing up that claim. No oxidation notes, whatsoever. Highly recommended for advocates of Belgian beer."

"330ml bottle. Achel Chalice glass. Revisited on jul´12. Reddish brown in color. Light tan, medium size bubbled, close froth. Slowly dissipated crown leaves spots on sides & a nice lacing layer on top. Toasted malt & Belgian yeast aromas, hints of prune, toasted bread, candies & phenolic alcohol to the nose. Caramel & sweet malts at first sip followed by sugary, fruity & biscuit flavors. Full body. Moderate carbonation. Texture is dense. Gentle warming alcohol in the middle lingers into a grape/fruity finish. Very good beer!!"
""
"D - I have yet to try a dubbel I didn't enjoy thoroughly, and this was no exception. Just a delicious, tasty Belgian brew, with a well crafted and balanced flavor profile. Definitely the better of the two between this and their tripel. While I can certainly see myself drinking this again, there are still better options in the style readily available to me."
""
"Overall this is a really great Dubbel. Expensive for the bottle but totally worth it to try."
"Try pairing this with mussels in a red sauce."
""
""
"This is a very good beer. I thoroughly recommend finding a bottle of this."
"D/O: Definitely repeatable. In fact, I would enjoy having another one consecutively, but it likely would not be my first choice."
""
"O: Very easy to drink and enjoyable. The alcohol is very well hidden and the flavors and aroma really continue to improve as the beer warms (and it was pretty darn good just after the pour)."
"High B-"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - A wonderfully complex and very drinkable beer. Each sip is interesting and the alcohol is well hidden. The scent is really the highlight for me. Another beer that falls into the must try category."
""
""
""
"D-this is a pretty tasty beer, its a little sugary with all the dark candied fruits and lacks complexity, but still a tasty brew and nice lively feel."
""
""
"Overall, good. A pretty traditional version of a Belgian dubbel, but maybe not a standout."
""
""
""
""
""
"I have yet to try a Belgium beer that I do not like. This Dubbel from Brouwerij der St. Benedictusabdij de Achelse has nice color with a fragrant nose of green apples and figs. The alcohol is masked well by the brew's exquisite taste and body. Two thumbs up for Trappist Achel 8° Bruin!"
""
""
""
"It's all very light but still staining, carbonation is little aggressive but not offensive"
"Better paired with food than other dubbels."
"Overall this is a very nice dubbel."
"Copper brown colour, orangey hues toward the bottom, nearly two fingers of eggshell coloured head, good lacing. Smell is spicy with dark fruits, yeasty, some faint banana, some lightly burnt dark sugars, light pockets of alcohol, raisin, plum, lots of fruit present, quite the complex nose. Taste is of overripe dark fruits, nice spiciness, mild alcohol, bruised figs, raisin, plum and apple, mild sweetness and dark sugars, caramel like flavours toward the end. Full weight, medium carbonation, medium body. This was really good, very complex and drinks incredibly quick, certainly something I would come back for."
"O - another great Trappist beer."
"Drinkability / Overall: A very good beer. Went great with Quiche Lorraine but I could easily have another all by itself. Great looking beer with great mouthfeel. I don’t think I’ve had a beer with this good of carbonation and mouthfeel in quite awhile. Only weak in the aroma department but with the other great aspects I think it’s still fair to say that this is a great beer."
""
"O: one of me favorite dubbles, not the easiest to find but worth the search."
""
"O: Overall a very solid Trappist dubbel: full-bodied, sweet, and with just enough other elements –in this case fruit– to make it interesting. Very well done, as is to be expected."
""
""
""
"Overall - Given that this is a Dubbel, I am very impressed with how many taste notes are present in this brew. Bordering on a quad at times, this is somewhat stunning. Considering I believe their blonde to be rather dull, this is a 180 for me, personally. Nice, dark, sweet and chewy flavors really bring this beer to life. An excellent Dubbel!"
"O- Definitely an interesting take on a dubbel. Didn't have the maryjane candy flavor that most others have on my palatte. Seems like a blend of an Oud Bruin and Dubbel, and it works. Once the super carbed head dies down this is fairly enjoyable."
"Fantastic, fantastic, fantastic It all I can say."
"This Trappist was not quite as dark as its Belgian Trappist counterparts. However, don't judge by that. It is a sweet, extremely smooth, and delicate beer. It gets better as is warms, and is a beer best drank after a meal, when you can just relax with it. The head was not anything to particularly write home about (I do own a goblet glass for these specialties). However, the caramel-coffee smell was very savory, and hard to put down after a drink. It is a strong beer, but the sweetness of it masks the alcohol content nicely. Personally, I think it is the best out of the Trappist Breweries, and is not overly expensive."
""
""
""
"O. Simply put, this is perhaps the best dubbel i have ever tasted"
"O: One of the best belgian's I've ever had."
""
""
"This is the best Dubbel I've had in a long time. For this to have been perfect, I would loved to have seen its tart, fruity qualities amplified and the chalky finish toned down a notch. But it is what it is and it's still a great beer."
""

"not sure why I've never had this one before as its been sitting on the shelf here for some time now, price is right and I've now tried something from all the Trappist brewers"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"There's definitely a grape/dark fruit taste in there. It's actually very fruity, but not overpowering. So smooth, but it has a bitter bit. Lavender. The most unique looking head and a very nice taste."
"O: Great authentic dubbel."
""
""
""
"Overall, a very enjoyable dubbel. Good stuff."
""
""
""
"O - This is one enjoyable Dubbel the smells and flavor make this one pretty damn easy to drink"
") - A very nice complex beer with great dark fruits but a little boozy with too much carbonation for mine. Overall though pretty good."
"Big spicy chewy malts - like Sunday bakery. Very balanced in that there's an impressive amount of flavor while being drinkable yet never burning or heavy. Kinda really what a dubbel should be."
"O: I enjoyed this one tremendously. It is a bit sweet and heavy for the style, but is still well worth a go."
"excellent trappist. if you have friends interested into trying trappist beers this would be a good start."
"This beer seems to me an excellent representative of the Belgian dubbel. It sometimes verges on being too sweet, but never quite crosses the line. The alcohol, at 8% abv, is very well hidden, and the silky mouthfeel makes this beer dangerously drinkable, though the sweetness would probably keep me from having two in a row. Overall, an excellent beer if you're in the mood for an authentic Dubbel."
"O: Pretty good Dubbel. Alcohol is blended and masked nicely. Worth the taste but probably nothing I would search our for again."
"Overall Drinkability - This beer deserves a much higher score, but unfortunately the bottle I'm using to base the rating on is not a great example. Has tons of negative characters that wasn't found in my first bottle, and none of the complexity either. Just goes to show you, ever beer deserves a second chance because you never know! For reference, the first one I rated would have been something like an A or A+."
"Was not expecting it to be as sweet as it was. It hit me right in the face. Malts, nuts, plums. The sweetness calmed down the further down the glass."
"Too harsh tasting and bitter to be an easy drinking beer."
"O - A very good double"
"Rich, smooth, and slightly too fizzy/overcarbonated. Awesome aroma and flavors. A delicate, decadent sipper."
"Overall: this beer is great in a lot of ways, but I feel like it has got more potential than it is showing. Still, a very good beer and definitely one of my favorite dubbels."
"D- alcohol is tasted and felt. the warmth it gives is comforting and nice. it's not so pronounced as to be a nuisance, but it is there in the most polite way possible. everything else about this beer- its weight, its aroma and flavor, is just remarkable."
"This stuff is great. One of the overlooked Trappist Ales."
"O- I was overall quite pleased with this beer. It's very much in the Trappist tradition of quality, traditional style beer. Not my favorite in the style, but a good beer nonetheless."
"Taste is quite nice...bready with a Dr Pepper and caramel maltiness. Dark fruit is vague at best; lending a light, tart undercurrent. Yeast is prevalent an even a bit spiced. Mouthfeel is full enough for a dubbel, but the body does not approach full-on quad proportions. This one falls in between a dubbel and a quad in terms of flavor, body and alcohol presence. Tastier than I expected, this is certainly worthy of the trappist designation. Good beer."
"A simple, drinkable dubbel. You won't find any surprises in this bottle."
"Overall an extraordinary beer and easily among the best dubbels I've had to date."
"A great beer that has the dark Belgian complexity and drinkability, if not to a slightly lesser degree than some of the other trappists"
"This beer poured out as a nice looking brown color. The head is big and foamy. The lacing is pretty good along the glass. The smell of the beer is earthy, sweet and had just a touch of fruit and spice on the nose. The taste had most of the same elements, it started off sweet with some earth in the middle and just a slight touch of fruity spice in the end. The mouthfeel of the beer is a very smooth and drinkable. Overall this beer is very good but I'm still partial to The Achel Extra when it comes to these Trappists."
"The ruby tone, the spicy aroma and near-perfect balance mingle to create easily one of the best Dubbles I've had.Saving ultimate awards for later as I have a Westy 8 to try in the next few weeks, but honestly can't imagine a better Dubble."
"Cheers!"
"33cl bottle, serve by date 4/23/11, served in a Chimay goblet. Pours a cloudy ruby color, some floaties, a good sized, frothy off-white head, and lots of lacing. Aroma is caramel, candi sugar, raisin, and spicy yeast. Flavor is sweet malts, raisins, peppery, fruity, toffee, and yeast. Mouthfeel is medium, a bit of a grainy texture, warming, and sweet. Pretty good beer."
"Pours a semi-clear dark iced tea color with a huge 4 inch light brown head that becomes a puffy island of foam on the top of the beer. The head on this beer is ridiculous. I poured the beer in a non-aggressive manner and the head just exploded. Small spots of lace here and there on the glass on the drink down. Smells of dark fruits, yeast, and some spices. Taste is of dark fruits (cherry, grapes, plums), grape juice, yeast, and spices. Beer is very carbonated and is very bubbly and crisp. There is a bit of an alcohol burn in the throat with each sip. Overall, this is a very nice dubbel but the alcohol burn is somewhat surprising."
"O: This is a nice Trappist-beer, but the alcohol was to obvious for my taste when it comes to a Dubbel. If the alcohol had been in better balance with the rest of this beer, then the ""overall""-grade would have been higher."
"( 36/50, 8% alc/vol, Home) Very yeast brown-orange beer with a sandy head that leaves quickly but spreads very strong aromas in it's wake. Sweets and potency in alcohol is hinted, not present. Bananas are very strong, along with fresh strawberries, vanilla and whipped cream. Despite strong malts, and a very nice and pleasant hops dry bite, the beer's age leaves a metallic mouth. Bitter chocolate and apples still come in. Very carbonated on the tongue. Very light, but at 5'C, left a strong alcoholic taste in the palate. Very warm and fizzy. Lemon and chocolate. Very sweet smelling beer. Yet does not deliver like a Koningshoeven. Very warm and very balanced. Age and temperature might have affected it."
"Pleasant aroma and appearance with a beautiful head which makes me believe it'll be quite a pleasant story. However, I become a bit sad when I take a sip. It tastes is good, but without depth and with an annoying metallic aftertaste that just ruins everything. A bit boring on the palate but not bad, it lacks a bit of mouthfeel for a dubbel in my opinion, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. Decent beer, but not a lot more than that."
"Drink- I could drink a lot of these in a sitting. I will have to come back to this dubbel. Very tasty and well crafted."
"O: Meh, okay."
"Drinkability and Overall Impression: I'm finding this one more drinkable as it warms than I thought it might be when I began. This is definitely a dubbel to drink only lightly chilled. The flavor balance is different than I recall from other dubbels, but is quite nice. One way to describe the impression it leaves is that it is ""austere"" rather than lush. My overall impression is that this is a very well made beer that has been overshadowed to a degree by other Trappist dubbels which may be ""bigger"" in flavor but that are not any better. This beer is worth seeking out and deserves to be more well known."
"Drinkability: Nice enough but no wow factor. Would choose a different trappist ale over this one, but if it was the only one available I might try it. The bottle label is very poor though, so I would probably pass over it."
"I can't help wondering if this bottle was a bit off, the yeasty notes were a bit offending. But much good parts around there."
"Palate is crisp. Dark and fruity, clean texture with clean finish. Tasty and higher carbonation than other Trappists."
"D - Not really a session beer, too heavy for that, but each sip leaves you wanting more. Quenching too."
"D: Pretty high considering how fast I polished it off."
"D - nicely done, drinkable and enjoyable, however kind of strong, so be carefull"
"Not too fussed about this, as a dubbel or as a beer. I've had better of both."
"Conclusion: A good head is of major importance to a Belgian. And having a nice head like this is just great. Also the beer has a very nice balance to it."
"A slightly hazy deerskin brown with a fine, persistent white head. Fragrance of malt and fruity yeast, like an orchard in the late summer. Flavor is malty leaning toward sweetness, with more yeast character suggesting apple, pear, and even a bit of grape. Finishes clean thanks to an appearances by the hops, carbonation and ethanol. All in all a nice brew, a little dear in price for what it is."
"Lovely brew. Even though it doesn't have the brazen and intense complexity of the best Belgians, it's a very drinkable, and very classic Belgian brew."
"A reasonable beer underneath the apple notes and easy enough to drink."
"D: Drinks very smoothly. Seems to mellow out as it warms and the more you drink."
"D - Even at this ABV, nice, and more please!"
"A pretty agreeable dubbel, maybe a bit sweet up front, but hardly a runaway sugar or booze bomb, as it does well to mask the 8% ABV, making this slide down oh so enjoyably. Good stuff, overall."
"D: Drinking the Achel Bruin is an absolute pleasure. It may not be the best dubbel ever made, but it is one of the best-made. This will probably become my go-to beer for introducing people to the style -- fruity, lightly spicy, incredibly nice. Part of my rapture may be the result of being slightly beer-starved of late, but nevertheless, I highly recommend this one. Will be buying again, and again."
"Easy to drink. Alcohol is well hidden and the brew is actually very refreshing. Great beer."
"Poured a brown body w/ 2-finger head that takes forever to die and leave lace ring on top of a mild, nutty yeasty aroma with a hint of figs and black cherry along with a touch of bitter hops and smokiness. Smooth, slightly creamy, tad sweet caramel flavor along with toffee or nutti/breadiness. Some fruit flavors like touch of orange, black cherry/dark fruits, (grapes and sour fruit- maybe), as well as sweet and sour fruit notes. Textbook quality dubbel and a must-try for anyone into this style."
"I can throw back a few (and then get in trouble) but seemed like some mildly bittersweet tannic concoction to me, akin to a lightly sweetened black tea."
"Unfortunately there's way too much carbonation. Seriously ridiculous. Can't get much of a taste because of it."
"Light to medium bodied, sweet with a slightly bitter aftertaste. Nice carbonation. Finishes dry. A very nice beer."
"Pours a darker red color with a rocky light-tan head. Mild aroma with some malts and hints of sourness. A tasty beer, but quite mild in flavor. There's some light, sweet malts, fruit (grape & apple), and some bitter and sour undertones as well, particularly towards the finish & into the aftertaste. Light- to medium-bodied with mild carbonation. Easy to drink with no taste of alcohol."
"Pours a nice purple-brown color with a good off white head. Nice lacing spots. Nose brings dark sugars with a tiny amount of roast as well as spice and a bit of booze. The taste is raisins, dates, other dark fruits as well as caramelized sugar, some booze, and caramel. Nice medium mouthfeel with low-ish carbonation. Drinks quite well. Good, not great, beer."
"O: I'm beginning to suspect 8% ABV Dubbels aren't really my thing... prefer a good strong smooth, more complex, sweet quad."
"Certainly calls for more, but could not drink a lot."
"D - This is a really nice dubbel. It is fairly easy drinking despite its high ABV."
"This disappeared quickly. I will definitely pick this up if I can find it again. Complex and flavorful."
"Stupid apperance, rocky white head that just stays and stays. Beautiful ruby brown color. Aroma of burnt caramel, dark candy sugar, raisins. Chewy and rich, notes of caramel, candy sugar, spices, and nice earthy hop tones. I can see how this ale might get cloying after a while. Nice mouthfeel for the style, good body not thin. These beers are drinkable, but too me really only in the fall and winter months."
"D: A very good dubbel in a style that I've seen a lot of mediocrity in. Doesn't stand out to me as much as the Blond, but there's a lot of good flavours here and well worth a pickup."
"jd"
"Overall, it's really an exceptional dubbel. Great aroma and flavor. Even after having my first Westy 12 last night, this is very impressive."
"Pours a ruby brown colour with huge off-white head with a careful pour. The cloud of head hardly dissipates with nice lacing. Smells is sweet brown sugar, dried fruits and Belgian yeast. Flavour has a small amount of bitterness to balance out the sweetness. This comes together very nicely and may be the best dubbel I've ever had (at least so far). Very nice carbonation level."
"D-this is a pretty tasty beer, its a little sugary with all the dark candied fruits and lacks complexity, but still a tasty brew and nice lively feel."
"An extraordinary example of what a Trappist dubbel is all about."
"D - This is a great beer. Very easy to drink by itself or with food- in fact, dangerously easy considering the 8% abv. This is the kind of Belgian beer I could have several of in a sitting. I have had several of the other offerings from Achel, but this is the best I've had so far."
"Taste follows with a nicely balanced footprint and a bit of brown sugar. Solid and without the defects/overabundance often found in the style. Gets better with a bit of warming. Bit creamy on the finish given the carbonation. A very solid beer that doesn't overwhelm with either excessive fruitiness or sweetness. Not as complex as a few of the style, but very nice and hides its ABV well."
"Date says: 23/04/11. Poured into a White Birch Chalice. Huge foam head on this one that stays for minutes. The color is a nice nut brown. Gorgeous. The smell reveals cinnamon and a hint of dried fruit. The taste is very dry, but indicates brown sugar and cinnamon apples. The yeast character is very dominant. I am a huge fan of Belgians that are nice and dry. This is an excellent Trappist ale and I regret not trying it sooner."
"D - I would have no problem having one of these from time to time but there are better dubbels out there."
"D - This is quite simply the best Dubbel I've had up to this point. I am not a tremendous fan of the style, usually, especially in comparison to the other Trappist works. But this one is ridiculous!"
"All in all one of the better dubbels for me."
"D-- Really scary how drinkable this is. A little sweet and carbonated, but reminds me a lot of La Chouffe Nice and their Brune. ABV is very well hidden and can drink a 750 without even thinking about it. More I think about it does remind me a lot of carbonated grape soda. YUM!"
"D- A nice example of the style, some good complexity with malt domination without overpowering the semi dry finish."
"Strong alcohol and darker malt flavor on the initial sip. There's a bitterness present from light hop. Overall, this is a sweet offering. The aftertaste is short lived for the style. Good blend on the swallow of sweet-bitterness. Rich bodied with a low carbonation. Warm alcohol finish."
"I really enjoyed this beer, though I felt that the flavours could have been more panoramic, the malts more assertive and toasty. Anyway, its definitely there with some of the great dubbels out there."
"D - Very drinkable due to the well-balanced nature and also sweet, fruity goodness in the taste. Well disguised alcohol content definitely adds a good bonus here. (4.5)"
"The drinkability is average. There are lots of flavors going on but everything is kept in check. The clove could be a bit much at times though. A very good dubbel"
"D - Top marks again for this very solid bruin. This is so incredibly well balanced and makes it very complex."
"The least of the Trappists? Maybe, but it's still a nice tasty dubbel. Glad I tried it."
"I think this is the first authentic Belgian beer I have rated on this site, so I don't have a huge frame of reference....but all in all I liked the beer, and I would try other varieties in the future if given the opportunity."
"O An very good Belgian Brown. I am looking forward to another if I can find it (Our local shop stopped carrying it). Definitely recommend."
"It is warming and easy drinkable. It does seem like a seasonal beer though: good on colder rainy days."
"Notes: A nice beer and good example of a Dubbel. A touch thin and doesn't have that much in complexity of flavor, but it is an enjoyable beer to sip. Not amazing, although it does look very nice, but a solid beer. You could probably find Dubbels with a better value, and it isn't my favorite Trappist beer, but it is definitely worth a try."
"D: overall a well-made beer, but it pales in comparison to the other Trappist offerings. I know that brewing isn't their main objective, but a little time in the brewhouse instead of the chapel might help them out."
"D: It's very easy to drink, particularly as it warms up. Any traces of alcohol in the taste are very well masked."
"D: Very good, especially at 8% ABV."
"Overall I didn't think this aged all that well. I'll have to have it fresh to be sure but it seemed to be only a milder version of what it once was."
"Overall, a decent beer, but doesn't match the standards of other trappist ales I have tried. There is alot of yeast in the aroma and taste(more than I like for a Belgian ale), and the body is rather light. Worth trying but nothing exceptional."
"This is a hugely drinkable beer, one that gives the palate a ride with each sip. It is one that I am resigned to keep in my cellar."
"Drinkability: Sipping this beer was rather enjoyable due to the great mouthfeel. I really just wasn't impressed due to how light the flavors and aroma was in the beer."
"D-very drinkable at 8% and is very tasty and would love to have a few of these for a session"
"D - Goes down easy."
"D: Very drinkable. ""Easy to digest," as the Belgians would say."
"Opinion: This is a really nice beer all the way around. In fact, it is so subtle and clean, that the untrained palate might mistake this for a Bock or something like that. I definitely think that it is the cleanest Dubbel that I have ever tried. Either way, I would certainly drink this beer again and I am already planning on picking up the Blond tomorrow when I return to Knightly Spirits."
"Great beer thanks :)."
"Overall, a very excellent dubbel."
"D - very drinkable. smooth going down. very nice. you can't taste the alcohol at all."
"D: Flavorful, smooth, and easy to drink. This brew is a great example of the style. It's definitely worth trying."
"Notes: It's a good beer with a dessert-like taste. The baked apples and raisons impart fruitiness that is counterbalanced by caramel-honey sweetness. All in all quite a worthy and very drinkable beverage."
"D: good, very light for a beer of its strength"
"Pours a medium brown color with a huge off-white head with good retention and a bit of lacing. Smells very malty with a dry with some fruitiness. Tastes fruity with dry nuts, malts and a small hop profile. Mouthfeel is pretty standard, which is very enjoyable. Drinkability is great for this beer, the alcohol stay quiet and it's fairly mild."
"Clear coppery brown with a 1 inch, fluffy, tan/beige cap. Good head retention with sticky and clumpy lace. Malty sweet aroma, bread crust, mild, with slight solvent character. Low bitterness with a lot of malt sweetness and caramel, dried fruit, bready, brown sugar, and light alcohol at the end. Medium body with ample carbonation and an airy texture, light warmth. Quite tasty overall."
"The reviewed beer belongs to a lot of bottles that came near to the expiration date declared on their labels. The beer evolves continuously with aging and so does my curiosity so lets try one while still within the limits of rapidly approaching BBE (17.01.2010). The beer is highly effervescent so needs to be poured quickly within seconds after cap removal as it literally erupts from the bottle. St. Bernardus goblet gets instantly crowned with spectacular tan head that never completely fades although its surface become dimply as it gradually subsides forming thick solid cap above the dark coppery-brown liquid. Nose pampering aromas of barriqued red wine, grape seeds, unrefined sugar, grapes, berries - predominantly strawberries, fully ripened figs, wine soaked raisins and trace of cocoa. How I wish they would make such fragrance for women... The fully matured flavor profile closely corresponds to the aroma - slightly vinous with all sorts of dark fruits and berries whose sweetness is gently balanced by grape seed and bread crust bitterness. This is perhaps the most complex beer I've ever encountered. Prickly yet velvety smooth followed by mild pleasantly warming sensation in the stomach. So good it's almost unreal. I still have a dozen bottles or so and will continue to cellar some to see how this beer gains with further aging. Based on recent experience the future seems promising. I dunno how fresh Achel would do it but an old one is the finest of all dubbels. I don't see a beer of its kind capable of dethroning this one in the foreseeable future."
"Overall, this is a solid trappist dubbel. And that's just it. I got that trappist taste I expected - no surprises. But a job well done. This beer did improve greatly when the last half of it was at room temperature. It also went well with some craisins I had, and I bet it would go very well with sharp cheddar cheese."
"I like this one, not quite what I was expecting, but quite tasty."
"Very soft carbonation, but lacks creaminess because it doesnt foam up very well in the mouth."
"nice but nothing to write home about."
"At first this was a little bubbly and that interfered with the drinking experience. After this beer aired out the taste and mouth feel improved. Very nice beer. Easy to drink."
"O - A very well-off Belgian, from the youngest Trappist."
"D: Nice for a change, and I am really glad that I got to try another one of the trappist beers. But I don't think it will be beating out others in it's style. Still worth picking up if you come across it."
"D-The alcohol is well hidden, it is interesting and I want to keep drinking just because each sip is different and unique. I would consider buying again for 5.99 for a 12 ounce bottle."
"this beer finishes with a medium body and a good balance of malt, esters, and subtle hops. a nice belgian brown and worth a go."
"D: Again, a very a discrete Trappist but not underrated at all. Remarkable."
"D - This is a very nice Trappist. Cold out of the bottle it was a bit brash, but changed character nicely when it warmed. I wish I had a few more bottles to get to know this beer better, but alas, it's not available locally."
"d) Outstanding ale. Seems more complex than other Dubbels - more like Strong Dark Belgian Ale, but not with the cloying heaviness. Makes this an easy yet complex drink."
"Overall: I like this trappist, it is clearly different from all others. Perfectly balanced and very easy to drink. Recommendable."
"While I did enjoy this beer, its simply not up there with other world-class dubbels, mostly because it plays the malt too lightly. I feel it has so much promise and a few tweaks would make it spectacular."
"Taste is light citrus and dark fruit up front with a good amount of spices washing it down. Fairly refreshing and easy to drink. Mouth is a tad thinner than I generally would want but the high carbonation levels luckily do not cause a whole lot of sting. Drinkability is top notch, this just went down smooth despite the spiciness. Great beer overall, a very high quality example of the style."
"Drinkability - A strong but smooth beer that represents the style well. Smoother than some other Dubbels out there, Chimay included - possibly due to Achel's use of Westmalle yeast and a step mash that results in good balance of dextrins."
"D: I typically don't session a dubbel, but this one is do-able."
"Thick and rich, almost rum-like sugary sweetness up front and a spicy linger. Smooth full body with warm soft carbonation. Hints of alcohol. Soft nut biscuit malt. Spicy coolness. Sweetness dies down to a softer bready sweetness. Suggestions of banana. Soft herbal musky bitterness. Finishes softly fruity, mostly clean. Tastes good. Feels good to very good. Good drinkability."
"D: A good rich trappist although not my favorite trappist."
"This beer was a very nice treat."
"Jordan."
"The mouthfeel is smooth and only a mild alcohol and spice finish. A great example of the Dubbel style and highly recommended."
"Nose is fairly mute but upon deeper inhalation opens up notes of dried out raisins. Carbonation is extremely lively and produces a long lasting lace. Strong notes of champagne in the aftertaste. Clean. Dry. Tickles. Faint malt backbone. Some notes of dates come into the front."
"Drinkability - Could drink quite a few of these, and at this alcohol level I would get quite drunk, but wouldn't stop me, only the price would."
"Very drinkable, enjoyable Trappist brew, very light and tasty yet complex for a brune"
"D: Great mouthfeel and some nice fruit and yeast character to this beer. I did not used to enjoy the Belgian styles all that much, but this is a good step in the right direction."
"11.2 ouncer, pours clear Dubbel brown, head is initially huge, then slowly receeding, loose and frothy, leaving a thick collar and thick film and some spots of thick stick and areas of sheeting. Bread, brown sugar and ripe fruit nose. Sweet malts, more fruit, and notes of vanilla, alcohol, and rum. Yummy stuff. Warming, complex and flavorful. A nice treat (Expensive @ $5.99 for the teeny bottle)"
"Pours a deep brown with a good off white head that stays. Smell is fruity but understated. Taste when cold is earthy with a very dry aftertaste, but the fruit comes in as it warms. Mouthfeel is typical of a fine brune, nicely frothy. It actually seems stronger in alc content than it is, so drinkability for me is good. Not my favourite brune, but well up there."
"M&D - the beer is bit thin for me, I would have liked a bit more thickness to such a boozy brew, but it is still excellent nonetheless. the fruity flavor and the initially unassuming booze component make the beer quite drinkable."
"Overall, a good beer and worth a shot."
"Excellent beer, will definitely have another one of these again soon. Curious how this one ages."
"D - Refreshing and very drinkable. The fruity sweetness is not overwhelming."
"Overall not as complex as some other I've tried but the clean refreshing quality keeps it very enjoyable. This may be the latest Trappist ale to earn a spot in my fridge."
"Drinkability is good here if you can stand the price."
"Pairs greatly meat plates."
"I should let this one breathe a lot more but I find myself reaching back to the glass to enjoy more of it. Wish they would make 750s of this readily available; 33 cl just isn't enough."
"D- A really enjoyable Dubbel. A complex treat that drinks pretty nice. This is one of my favorites of the style, if not my favorite. I will most definitely be getting this again."
"I poured the beer into a goblet. The beer was quite foamy, I had to wait a minute or so for the head to subside so that I could finish pouring the beer. The head was an off-white color and very thick, it never completely subsided. The beer itself had a nice slightly cloudy brown color. I couldn't place the smell, it was very faint to my nose, but I think there was malt and spice in there. I picked up a variety of flavors when I drank the beer. Malt, fruits like fig and raisins. The taste lingered nicely."
"Pours a rich cloudy brown with a nice thick tan head, excellent lace. Nose has bready malts, tropical fruits and spicy yeasts. The taste is also quite fruity and well balanced. Medium body has a nice soft carbonation and a lingering finish. A tasy brew from Achelse. Would love to have this on tap."
"Drinkability: this is a fine brew a great catch at the least. i get this one often ,it`s a fruity bitter sweet sensation ,that has alot of complexities."
"OVERALL: This seems to be a love-it-or-hate-it kind of brew, and I don't think I'm much of a fan. Definitely a unique dubbel, but a little too sour and thin for my palate. I had trouble finishing this one. There are plenty of dubbels I thoroughly enjoy, and sadly this is not one of them. I won't be getting this one again."
"D) On the light side of the Dark Belgian Ale style. A great beer with or before a meal"
"Amber brown color with chunks of lees and a medium to thin light tan head. Aroma is sweet-n-sour, like a Flemish style. Fruity berries and cherries and tart sourness. Flavor is surprisingly un-tart. Wow, I was really expecting a bit of a puckerfest. Lightly sweet, rounded caramel, toffee, hints of apple and pear. Not rally a sweet beer, but not tart. Defies the senses. Really a nice beer - wonder where the tart nose comes from?!? Maybe the two years in the bottle?"
"M&D: pretty light on the carbonation, medium-bodied for a 8%abv. dark ale, easy to drink and coming with reasonable complexity, but all in all this bottle is not so impressive as my previous encounters throughout the years."
"This is one terrific beer; certainly fitting the high expectations of Trappist Dubbels."
"Very interesting beer with lots of complexity and big wine character. Makes me want some soft stinky cheese. Good stuff."
"D: Easily drinkable, no flavors are offensive or overstay their welcome. Well balanced."
"Tastes great, very easy to drink and its heavy carbonation tickles your lips just like a champagne does. Big notes of yellow apples, pear, a hint of cherry and... passionfruit in the deep aftertaste? The more attention you give it, the more dimension it gives you! It's great stuff that comes off as simple and ends with a delicious, radiant smile."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied and smooth with a big bite from carbonation."
"Here's a reddish, ruddy brown color with a towering white head. Cloudy liquid with a yeasty, beady, malty nose. The aroma is not intense, but pretty coy and restrained. There's also some difficult to discern fruits...peach? (Even tomato without the acidity?). A touch phenolic. The taste is solidly good, with a lot of malt and yeast interplay...there's a lot of sweetness up front and considerable spice, with an alcohol warming in the finish. Yeast flavor is present throughout the taste as well. Very carbonated, almost champagne like, with a medium-light body. All in all, I'd say that this brew, although quite good, doesn't live up to my expectations. It's nowhere near as complex and engaging as other Trappist ales."
"Drinkability: A solid, full bodied, complex Belgian."
"Where's the praise for Achel?"
"This is a standout beer."
"D: a very good example of the dubbel style; does not hide the alcohol as well as others in the style but still a very good choice."
"This could be the most drinkable dubbel I have tasted. It's not as rich in flavor as Chimay Red or even Rochefort 6, but it is delicious and enjoyable in its subtleties."
"http://www.trappistbeer.net/"
"Picked up a single at Abe's for $5.25. Not a bad monk-made beer. This is a fine abbey ale. Very smooth flavors and very drinkable. I would have liked a little more pop from the taste, but the caramel and spice are quite pleasing to the senses. I might like to see what a couple years of cellaring could do. If it weren't cost-prohibitive (at least for me), this would be a dangerous beer."
"Drinkability - Like I said, it's definitely not as sweet/fruity as some other dubbels I've had, and definitely lighter in feel than some others, so it has fair drinkability for the style. Overall, though, it's something I'd rather just sip on or have with/after a big meal. I can't imagine breezing through more than one or two of these, but that's fine."
"D: Very good drinkability and goes down effortlessly. Overall very good, but thought their extra brune 9.5% was noticeably better."
"superb"
"7/4/7/4/16 (3.8/5)"
"D - Nice flavors but mouthfeel could be smoother."
"Very smooth as it goes down; I could definitely kick back with a couple of these. Overall, it is slightly reminiscent of a quadrupel (like Ommegang Three Philosophers or St. Bernardus Abt. 12) but less heavy and not as strong a flavor."
"Drinkability is dangerously high. This is an excellent oud bruin, the perfect balance of acid and sugar. I can't believe I've never had it before! Achel's extra is my favorite quad ever, and this is about as good as it gets for a Belgian bruin."
"Wonderful stuff. Has an old-world, untainted, all-natural purity to it that will always keep me coming back for more. Worthy of taking its place amongst the other Belgian Trappist ales."
"I could easily have handled another one of these. It is clearly a very good beer, but for a Belgian trappiste ale, that is not surprising. There are better, more complex beers, but this is still highly recommended."
"Notes from 10/15/04"
"Drinkability - A sipper, but if I had two I'm sure I'd go through the second one quickly."
"The aroma has caramel, yeast, alcohol, and brown sugar. The appearance is red/brown with a really big head. The flavor is like the aroma with lots of sweet sugar and plenty of bitterness. The palate is thin. Overall it's good and I want another one."
"Notes: Maybe the most drinkable Trappist that I have tasted."
"Pours a murky brown color with a dense tan colored head that left a wall of lacing on the glass as it dissipated. The aroma is a tad faint, some dark candi sugar and red grapes. Some medicinal notes as well. The taste is sweet from the candi sugar, some hints of chocolate and berries/grapes, and a rusty metallic twang. The feel is fairly light and well carbonation, perhaps too much so. The dubbel finishes sweet and a little dry. A nice dubbel, good flavor profile, though the carbonation takes away from the flavor a bit."
"D - This is a very flavorful, and incredibly tasty beer, but one that seems like it's meant to be sipped and enjoyed. I couldn't see myself sitting down and drinking a lot of these."
"D- There is a nice slight perfume aroma to this big beer but otherwise there is not much depth of flavor."
"A well-made beer, good representative of the style. It doesn't really wow me, but it's a solid, quaffable brew."
"Brown Achel somewhat reminds me of a beer like Moinette Brune. It also seems to have gotten better and developed into a more complex beer every time I have one (which is about three times a year)."
"Picked this up at Kingdom Liquors in Brandon FLA. Pours a dark red to brown color. Generated a nice fluffy head. Smellls like candied fruit and alchohol. Taste knocks it out of the park. Sweet maltiness full of caramel and fruit. Low hoppines. On the sweet end of the spectrum but well balanced."
"Muddy brown with a hint of orange color with a thick tan colored head that leaves decent lacing in the goblet. Smells of yeast, dark malts, and dark candi sugar with a smidge of spiciness. Not particularly the most complex Trappist I've tried, but the flavor is there, the alcohol punch is there, and it's rather smooth. Like other Trappist ales, I couldn't drink them back-to-back because I reserve them for ""special treats"". I must admit that I was slightly disappointed by this one."
"Lots to like, not exceptional but far from bad either. Gotta love those Trappist ales!"
"Definitely recommended..."
"Overall, very nice, will return to it again to get a clearer sense of it."
"I tried this beer on December 20, 2007 at ""Smokeless Joe's"" in Toronto. The beer poured a dark brown into the Trappist chalice with a huge tan head that lasts throughout the beer, getting rocky as it slowly dissipates. The aroma is a mixture of yeast, malt and fruit such as plums. The mouthfeel was highly carbonated and full-bodied. The flavour was malt, with some hop bitterness."
"D: Very nice, balanced, slightly sweet flavorful dubbel with well hidden alcohol. Slightly thin in the body but very rich flavor compensates for that nicely."
"D: Not too bad. Not something I would reach for all the time but damn can those monks brew."
"D- again, nothing spectacular but solid- good but won't blow your mind"
"I had a bottle in Seattle and didn't like it. I really wanted to give it a second chance and wasn't sorry I did. I think I just had a poorly treated bottle the first time around. This is a good beer and worth a try."
"drinkability is quite good. not used to having a bit of brett influence in a dubbel, and not sure if it's intentional, but i'm rather enjoying it. the alcohol is hidden very well. nicely balanced. i also like the light dark fruit character too. interesting, unique, and quite good."
"This is a really fine Belgian Dubbel and very representative of the style. It pours a nice slightly hazy ruby color with a lot more carbonation than you would expect. The head is huge, hangs around awhile and laces a bit. The head is soapy off white in color. The aroma is candied sugars and then some, along with some very sweet malts, and some spice. The flavor won't disappoint. Again, lots of sweet malts, candied sugars, some caramel and butterscotch, maybe some green apple. You will also find a rather yeasty carbonation towards the finish that is characteristic of the style as well. Where I knocked the beer down is in the overly throaty alcohol in the finish and aftertaste. There is a slight sourish hue as well on the backend, coupled with the too warming alcohol notes, and I took some points away. Well worth seeking out but not perfect. L'Chaim."
"This is not a 3-4 beer Brune-I would serve this to guests as a digestif' w/ pride!"
"Nicely complex, craftily blended, and seamlessly smooth, it's a comforting taste of monastic Belgium. It's not quite top of the heap, or A number one, but it's certainly upper tier. The ABV is healthy and noticeable but it's a warm asset instead of an obstacle to easy drinking. As they say, what's not to like?"
"Overall:	One of the more interesting beers I've tried, certainly unique among the Trappists. Complex but not terribly so. Very drinkable and thought-provoking. Clearly cellar worthy for a decade or more. You can feel that it is a high-quality, carefully put together beer."
"Well, I need to grab a few more bottles of this.... very delicious."
"the flavor is malty with a quick twang, fruity, raisins, woody, and alcohol."
"D - One of my favorite dubbels to date. Really excellent flavor with a complexity that keeps you coming back. Little to no alcohol to worry about as you enjoy the beer."
"But all in all, there are few drawbacks for this beauty, a very good beer and one to which I'll certainly return. I'm proud to say that this is the sixth of the seven authentic Trappist products I've had, with only the cloistered Westvleteren remaining. That must wait until the family and I take the long-discussed trip to Europe. In the meantime, I'll have to choke down the rest of the Trappist offerings. I think I'll manage just fine."
"D: An excellent Belgian Ale. Great taste, pretty high ABV with the alcohol not too noticeable. Better than other Belgians I've had recently. Definitely worth a try if given the opportunity."
"Pours a dark ruby with a massive head. Nose is light with almost a floral touch. Taste is thick and flavorful with a robust malt edge. Mouthfeel is full of carbonation and overall this one is extremely drinkable. Watch out for the sediment on the bottom as it seems to kick the bitter up quite a bit. Overall a very good brew and one worth drinking again. (though it does not have any unusual or unique characteristics)"
"Sweet aftertaste, but not cloying, with toasted and hazelnut notes in the back, and a light liquorice."
"Poured into a chalice a dark brown color, nice carbonation, got alot of floaties in this bottle (my first time ever), huge two-finger plus creamy tannish head, lots of sticky lacing followed. The nose is malty, with some figs, raisins, plumes, and some caramel. The taste pretty much follows the nose. The alcohol is hidden very well. Medium body. Drinkable, did not like the floaties, but it still tasted pretty good."
"A much more unique and savory beer than I had planned on tasting."
"Drinkability : une bonne bière dans le style Trappiste"
"DRINKABILITY: This one surprised me with it's exceptional taste and the complete lack of alcohol flavor. It's complexity makes it hard to imagine drinking all night, but when you want to treat yourself, this is a great brew with which to do it."
"D - Probably not something to drink all that often but once in a while wouldn't be a bad call."
"Achel's blond is quite nice as well."
"33 cl. bottle. Red fire colour, with darker shades on the top. Creamy foam, last for a while and leaves a good lace. Aroma of fruits, chocolate, vanilla, figs or dates, spices. Taste of dark fruits, spices, chocolate, background of cherries. Flavos has an acid alcoholic touch."
"Intriguing and mysterious this Trappist Achel 8° Brune is, and a willing student am I."
"I'll say it again. Those monks sure know what they're doing. I'm increasingly impressed by each one, and I certainly plan on buying them again."
"This is a highly refreshing beer-I usually don't think Dubbel when I want a refreshing summer beer but this certainly fits the bill."
"Comment: This is a better looking beer than tasting one. I like it but would not put it at the front of the class. Its drinkable but not terribly entertaining."
"Pours murky dark brown. Huge creamy head that doesnt go anywhere. Looks absolutely delicious. Smells of faint fig, some caramel, toffee and spice, maybe rind. Very subtle smells that are slightly dissapointing compared to its looks. Tastes sweet at first but dies quickly. Dried fruit, caramel, chocolate. Feels full in the mouth but a vibrant tingle on the tongue from the carbonation is a little too much. Overall a delicious and great beer but falls a little short for a Monk mix. Great brew but if Im going to pay the Monk premium, I might look elsewhere...or pour my second."
"Drinkability is tough, because the alcohol is superbly hidden, and it's really a smooth ale. But I didn't really like the flavor enough to want another."
"Overall: Another solid beer from those Monks in Belgium. This one is very pleasant and filling. It's a very solid example of a Dubbel. If you can find it buy it and give it a try. You won't be disappointed."
"Notes: Another great one from Achel. They bring out fruity esters so well, and both beers I've had from them were SO easy to drink. I wish I had gotten more than one bottle of this when I had the chance."
"Could certianly drink another one as the whole package is quite enjoyable. Was picturing German Soldiers occupying Belgium in the 40's getting fat, complacent, and drunk drinking brews like this. Thank You Belgium."
"D: Clicked after about 1/2 of a bottle. I think I ""got it"" then, just after the carbonation started to settle down. I like to think of this as a gouden carolus classic, but far easier to drink."
"I had the Blond a couple days ago, and thought it was fantastic, but this is a different story. This is just so-so... very little character. My original scores were very harsh, but it substantially improved towards the end of the glass."
"Taste is malty and quite well shaped by bottle conditioning. I get all the same fruit esters in the taste as in the smell, plus a slight hint of yeasty goodness. Bitterness is at a minimum just enough to maintain balance with the malt and ester qualities. Drinkablilty is good on this yet again I wish I was drinking this with food. Honestly this is great on its own, but I can just imagine how good it would be with food? How great it would make the food. Great beer, solid for the style.."
"Overall, to quote an unserious comedy about wine, it's quaffable, but far from transcendent."
"A nice Belgian brun without the chocolate or sweetness. Dangerously drinkable!"
"Very drinkable, but a long way from the best Trappist beer i have had."
"Poured in a cloudy brown color and with lots of nice, hard foam to dive in. The smell was primarily of alcohol and yeast, very frutiy, and a whiff of detergent. Good carbonation. The taste was of dung, a lot of alcohol, yeast, caramel and sweet fruits. I was not overly impressed although the taste seemd to develop and improve after some time in the glass."
"As usual, I preferred the Blond."
"I will definitely get more of this despite the high price."
"Taste goes from sweet to sour and then rounds out with a delicious sweet aftertaste. Really excellent. The booze is warming but not hot or burning. Tastes of rasberries, cranberry and and plum on a banana-nut bread with butter. Maybe a little too buttery, although it would definitely improve with age. Tartness is just right- very mild. All in all a very unique Dubbel- this one is a black sheep-and one of the best I've ever had."
"Pours a cloudy copper brown tea like color with a huge frothy light brown head and great lacing. Complex yet not overwhelming yeasty, malty nose with hints of carmel and plums. The 8 percent alcohol is very well hidden from start to finish. Malt and yeast flavors to start. The middle becomes very complex with hints of fruit, carmel and nuts. The finish is very tart and warming but highly drinkable."
"A great beer - satisfying for beer tragics like me but I reckon it could also be a good crossover beer for Trappist firsttimers. Just make sure you pour carefully."
"Drinkability: This beer goes down smooth. I could easily enjoy a couple of these in a row."
"very nice beer. if not for the shoddy pouring job with tons of yeast floating around, it would be even better. this is the stereotypical complex rewarding belgian. get this!"
"Sampled at In 't Spinnekopke in Brussels, the beer poured a cloudy dark burgundy under a 1.5 finger tan head with excellent contour, leaving incredible craters as it fades. Sheets of lace cover the glass. The nose is mild and spicey, while the mouth is light and very prickly. The taste features sweet caramel and spicey coriander malt, very smooth and enjoyable. The hops are subdued, but emerge in the finish, leaving a slightly dry, slightly bitter impression. Very nice indeed."
"Decent beer, for the style (dubbel/brune) very pleasant and one of my favorite in this category. I would certainly drink another, if I only had one..."
"I found the experience of this bottle to be a perfect expression of Belgian Brown/ Dubbel style--the best I have had so far. Soft, subtle, creamy malt but a lively crisp backbone that keeps the flavor fresh, alive, drinkable and prevents any cloying sensation. Would be easy to drink several...at $4 a bottle it's a tad more affordable than some trappists but it can't be my everyday beer, unfortunately."
"D= extremely drinkable, a good Belgian intro beer for almost any novice."
"A sipping wine like drinkability,but I could sip on this for a good while."
"A slightly more than medium body, a carbonation that kind of tickles the tongue, pretty nice for the mouth. Taste is full on rich dubbel goodness. Malts are rich and well rounded, alcohol isn't shy and esters fruity, dark, a very nice taste and mouth, but at $5+ normally (though I got it for 3.49), probably one and done. I'll be getting the blondes for sure though."
"This is a well-crafted beer, and beats BMC blandness any day, but I didn't find much to rave about."
"Poured yeasty medium brown. A finger of very creamy head with good lace retention. Smells enticingly ripe & fruity. Concentrated alcohol-laced cherries and figs, caramel, hints of green apple and yeasty spice. Flavor starts with gentle grainy hop and yeast flavors. Center is unexpectedly thin, with only a bit of cookie dough flavor binding it together. Finishes with lightly medicinal fruit and big warming alcohol. Nice creamy medium-light body with just enough carbonation. Nice, but would be more successful if the flavor fully developed throughout."
"Very carbonated, dominates the tongue. A full bodied, very enjoyable beer."
"Drinkability - it's not really good, so it's not sessionable, and high abv would have lowered that anyway."
"Gold amber hue-thick frosty white head- soft nose of caramelized sour apple medium body  caramel, vanilla dried fruit, and raisin tastebubbles not present- aftertaste of orange peel and copper/metallic (could be the bottleGold amber hue-thick frosty white head- soft nose of caramelized sour apple medium body  caramel, vanilla dried fruit, and raisin tastebubbles not present- aftertaste of orange peel and copper/metallic (could be the bottle"
"D - Very drinkable for the strength. A dubbel worth trying."
"the flavor contained a little hops fruit and grains with a little mollasses and hint of yeast in the background. the mouthfeel was rather nice and light but with a nice amount of carbonation. overall this beer felt very light and very drinkable."
"This guy pours a brownish ruby hue with a good looking frothy head. Smells very, very sweet- lots of raisins and sugary alcoholic stuff. Sweet and strong- rum cake, anyone? Taste is loaded with raisins, sugar, and nutmeg- I'm telling you, it's like drinking cake. Mouthfeel is smooth, quite smooth, and a bit bubbly. Quite a drinkable brew- smooth and tasty, just a bit too sweet after a while. Still... what a dessert brew."
"Pours brownie-batter dark, with a massive, burnt umber-tinged head and a ton of yeasty sediment. Mucho lacing. Big, sweet nose, dominated with a pear aroma. Coffee and molasses underneath. On the palate, candi sugar sweetness, with both low and high notes, but not a helluva lot else going on. Pear in the finish, along with hot alcohol. The alcohol isn't hidden terribly well, so minus points there on the mouthfeel. Overall, this one is decent, but there are a lot of better dubbels out there."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a mild bitter hop and cocoa mixed with yeast finish."
"Achel Brune pours a dark brown with a big fluffy off white head. I didn't make the best pour possible and ended up with big chunks of yeast floating around (I don't mind). The aroma is definitely kind of fruity. Taste is fruity, it has that typical Belgian yeast character. In the finish is some malt that imparts a bit of a caramel flavor which is noticeable in the first swallow, but less so after that. Highly carboanated mouthfeel. Not really my favorite style, but definitely very good for what it is."
"Overall, this is an excellent beer that is very different from most dubbels I've had. It's somewhat tangy without being too sour."
"The usage of a vast amount of candysugar was evident in the medium body and high drinkability of the beer. I did not really like the mouthfeel of the beer, which was hard to describe, on the one hand, it went down easy, and on the other hand pretty thick after swallowing. Does that make any sense? I don't think so, but it comes closest to my tasting session."
"The Achel Brown 8 has a simple brown and white label with the authentic Trappist logo at the top. Great to have another Trappist beer available in Alberta. The beer has the typical Trappist-beer charm in my chalice glass: a sizable and extremely solid tight bone-white head atop a hazy chestnut brown with hints of ruby red. The foam is beautiful and extremely consistent; it almost looked like it would be hard if you touched it. Thick rings of lace left. The first sniff above the glass gives candy sugar and some delicate hopping, almost Saaz-like. A lovely saline, metallic aroma not wholly unlike Orval. The malts are very softly roasted, giving brown sugar and cinnamon rolls, along with the tinge of alcohol which slowly increases the more you smell the beer. Rye bread, mould(extremely dusty and earthy), cream and caramel notes too. Lovely aroma, if not quite as complex as some Trappists. The taste is all nuts and whole-grain bread at first. The middle has some saltiness akin to pasta sauce, and the finish is all about the grainy malts and even the lightest of bittering hops. More hopping than some of the other Trappists, actually. A lovely aftertaste of bread and butter, with hints of roasted chestnut and white wine. Wonderful taste, balanced and extremely drinkable. Medium carbonation, very velvety. Alcohol is slowly pronounced. Another Trappist beauty, though perhaps less stunning than the others. It is the newest of the Trappist beers after all. A really lovely brew here though."
"This is definitely an ale to sip through an afternoon or an evening (or even a morning if you're an early bird and have the time), no rush here, so much to take in and discover. I'm in no huge rush to run out and buy more at the moment, I'm quite satiated for now, and need a bit of time to fully digest this journey before I can appreciate another one. Otherwise I feel I might just get carsick with too much of such an interesting ride in too short of a time, the scenery would make me too dizzy with such another quick go around."
"Overall this is a very solid beer, but it doesn't seem to have anything to set it apart. I like it, but it isn't making me wish I'd stocked up on it."
"This is a very good Abbey dubbel. Dark, caramel-y, some phenolics, and a good alcohol punch. Not great, but good."
"The taste was absolutely KILLER. Pleasantly balanced when compared to some other Belgians. I also found the mouthfeel to be light but not unpleasantly so. Between that and the way the alcohol hid, contributed greatly to it's overall drinkability. This is a good one and I hope they don't jack the price on me!"
"I enjoyed Achel Blond and I'm enjoying Achel Brune even more. Dubbels aren't among my top handful of favorite styles, but I recognize a beautifully brewed beer when I taste one. If you get the chance, don't pass up an opportunity to try a great beer from the smallest of the Trappist breweries."
"Smells and tastes good, though. Something about this reminds me of rum cake. Everything about this is subtle, but pleasureable. A nice treat to be sampled and visited from time to time."
"Overall: Not a bad dubbel. At $5.50 for 33cl, though, this isn't one to try. It's not in the same league as the best Belgian dubbels that can be acquired for around the same price or less."
"330 mL bottle with 11/04 notched on the label. A head develops in the bottle from the conditioning before I even pour. It pours a deep crimson/brown that is very cloudy with lots of sediment and a 1/2"" khaki head that leaves little lacing. There are aromas of vinous malts, sweetness, caramel, hints of mango and apple, and a distinct wet paper scent. The taste follows suit with some grass/hay notes and some powdery yeast on top of a medium to thick body that isn't quite as thick as I'd like. Past it's prime, but still tolerable. I'd like to try a fresh bottle, though."
"Good, but not exceptional example of the style."
"33 cl bottle pours a cloudy dark red color with lots of floating yeast and a decent light brown head that leaves some lacing in my glass. Chocolate and caramel aromas, plum, banana, caramel and toffee flavors. Medium to full bodied with a soft and creamy mouthfeel, finishes dry."
"Spicy, grainy, sweet with brown sugar and molasses notes on tasting. Tiny touch of maple, perhaps. Dried fruits."
"Overall: This is a very nice beer. It has all of the complexity of aroma and taste that I love about Belgian beers."
"Not the best of Dubbels. OK to good if that. 'Best by' notched on the side of the label is Nov. 05"
"Pours copper to brown, nice mountainous head. appetizing.Its standard until you get to the hop profile which has a bitter edge and works its way through the candied caramel malts and bubblegummy side of the house to form an above average to great dubbel. Don't be mistaken its malts and candied but there is a well crafted mix of balancers. Alcohol seems to be used as a cleanser because it eventually warms away the sweetness. Syrupy during the drink, tons of finely tuned carbonation sweep this away. What a fricking outstanding dubbel and if not the best it has to be one of the best. Notes: The bottle I'm rating was aged for a year. Not for any reason, I just didn't get to them yet. overall on the aging thing I'd just assume drink this fresh as there was really no difference. Bottles I've sampled relatively fresh were very similar if not identical."
"Those monks know how to brew!"
"A beer that I really like and that never misses in my cellar, this Dubbel really surprised me once, when I had it after a Rochefort 8. That was one of my best beer experiencies."
"This is a good,no; a great Dubel."
"Drinkability: What a damn good beer. It's slightly expensive (around $5 a bottle), so until I actually have a real job and am out of grad school I won't be buying tons of it, but this is without a doubt my favorite Dubbel, and I recommend it very highly, style or not."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a brash carbonation that stays strong throughout the brew. Goes down smooth and is really quite refreshing even at 8%. I wouldn't mind having a few bottles of this lying around. I'll have to try some of the other Achel line."
"Smell is rummy at first with strong rosy esters and a light earth/oak backdrop soon taking the stage. Semi-sweet and light in effect. Taste is toasty-edged caramel and a light jamminess from soft apple and rosy overtones. Leads to a complex hop tingle and glints of toast in the finish. Beautifully lean mouthfeel with the head adding super soft whipped cream-like texture. A nice little trappistenbier."
"Letting it sit and breath a bit, I swirled and smelled a great trappist smell; some yeast fruit alcohol grain malt sugar, all swirling gently. The taste and mouthfeel do not disappoint. There is a beautiful subtlety, a quiet power in the malt- which is balanced by alcohol rather than hops. There is a lingering finish of dry vanilla and figs. This is superb; this rivals Westmalle dubbel. This is classic."
"Taste is similar to the smell only lacking a bit. Good body but nothing really in the middle to rely on. Some more figs, nuts, and fruit. The ending has a solid malt kick. I almost wish that sourness came through. Overall, a solid beer. Nothing to die for as I really was expecting so much more complexity."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable but a bit understated compared to other dubbels; a nice broad range of flavors, however"
"Nice light carbonation that cleanses the palate. Quite drinkable, though not in the league of some other of its Belgian counterparts."
"Overall, I enjoyed this one. Easy to drink for an 8%. Very smooth!"
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Sublime in the mouth, the perfect blend of cream and foam. Medium weight, perfect for the flavors going on within. This drinks great over a long, unhurried hour when all you desire is rest and contemplation."
"Beer is good. Happy beering."
"A dubbel, Marks favorite, Achel a gem by Helen. It sits before me. Where to start...the head mounts short at a finger and remains with a thick, creamy blanket  off white; a remnant light lace. They both diminish midway. Carbonation streams continuous with ferocity. Color without backlight an opulent amber brown yet with illumination radiates a peachy-honey; particles afloat. The nose, a delight, sweet, caramel, banana, fig, tropical fruit, and soft spice. Oh, this is nice. The taste is a true balance of all. Beautiful. Simple, nose plus an appropriate carbonation is this taste and mouthfeel right down to the medium body witnessed in both nose and body. How wonderful it is to appreciate a style for its greatness regardless of this individuals preference. For what the Achel Bruin is it is good. I look forward to their triple blond."
"Overall - An excellent trappist... not quite up there with the Westy or Rochefort, but not too far off..."
"Another notch on my quest for complete trappist domination. Almost there. Pours a ruby red with brown highlights, huge creamy off white head, lots of sticky lace. Smell is rich and sweet malts, dark fruit, brown sugar, slight alcohol, some cherries. Taste is apples, pears, sweet spicy middle, light alcohol and a dry bitter finish. Kind of a wheaty aftertaste thats slightly tart. Medium mouthfeel, medium to high carbonation, pretty aggressive, a really dry finish. Tasty beer."
"Notes: I'll definitely drink this again. I found it at Cloverleaf in Detroit. I haven't found this in Columbus yet..."
"Maybe I got a sub-par bottle, but I don't see what the hype is with this beer. Its been by far my most disappointing of the trappists. I found it to be very one sided and uncomplex. Slight notes of banana, malt and a slightly hoppy finish were present. Good appearance with a nice dense head. Smell was ok, nothing special. Maybe I was expecting too much from this beer? Definitely will re-taste though from a different source though this one came home with me from Belgium."
"Poured into a Rapscallion glass, formed a 1"" beige head over the reddish brown brew, which has a bit of particulate riding the bubbles swirling in the glass. Head lasts well, and the lacing is of the impressive, slow-falling, dense foam variety. Aroma is malty, spicy, fruity, putting it together nicely. Taste is prevalent spiciness, with dark fruitiness and alcohol dominant as the flavor progresses. Mouthfeel is creamy, packaging up the flavors very nicely, and drinkability is similarly good. Got better as it warmed closer to room temperature. Nice one here."
"Sampled this at Le Sous Bock on my return to Paris. This beer produced a one finger foamy head when it was poured into a glass. The beer was an opaque orange brown color. Aromas were mainly sweet and spicy. Taste was very smooth with spice and fruit notes. Mouthfeel was velvety. A very good beer and one I'd buy if I could find it back here in the states."
"This beer was poured with the yeast. It sits in my tulip glass a rich, hazy amber color and is topped by a thin head. The aroma is lightly spicy, but is dominated by rich bread-like notes, dark fruit and malt. The taste is quite rich and flavorful, yet remains light and dry on the palate."
"A taste of sweet honey and hint of bourbon gives this Trappist its unique edge. Nice Brew!"
"Sweet malts, lemon bread, bitter hops and a belgian spiceness. Alcohol barely peeks through as it warms. Very complex and balanced. The mouthfeel is smooth like velvet. The abv is the only factor that could limit the drinkability."
"Bottle: Poured a dark brown color ale in my Trappist glass with a good inch of off-white foamy head with excellent retention. Aroma of roasted malt, sweet floral hops and unknown spices springs from my glass. Taste is somewhat spicy and well balance by the malt and the funky yeast. Overall, better then some other Belgian Strong Ale but not as good as Rochefort"
"[update 1.16.07] This beer still tastes good, but watch out for sludge! This recent bottle that I bought is seriously chunky. Beyond ok. Totally ruined the experience when you can't take a sip without having an m&m sized chunk slide down your gullet. Not a good use of $5. at all."
"Poured beautifully from a ""new label"" bottle into my newly acquired St. Bernardus chalice. Looks the part of a dubbel for sure, with a dark coca-cola complexion and a thick dimpled foamy cap. She's a smokin' hot looking Belgian brunette, alright. The smell is where I cease to be impressed with this beer, as was the case with the blonde. It lacks the depth and complexity of the other trappist dubbels. Smells very malty and hay-ish with a little bit of dark candi-sugar fighting its way out of the rim of the chalice. The taste is nothing short of exceptional, though. It has been too long since I had a Belgian style beer that didn't taste like bananas and cloves, and that is one hell of a refreshment, though I've actually come to like that signature Chimay taste that everybody seems to want to mimic with their Belgian style brews. The taste is very well rounded. It is not too sweet and malty, not too tart, somewhat earthy. This is what a dubbel should taste like (also see: St. Bernardus and it's selection of dubbels). The mouthfeel is somewhat light, but its about right at where I like it for this style, if only it were just slightly more full. As is the case with any of the trappist ales I've had, I would absolutely love to drink this stuff all night if I could afford it and be able to handle the alcohol level (which is very well hidden I might add... completely indetectable by my tastebuds)."
"The one I drank had a different label but Im 90% sure this is it. I drank this one cold. Good smell, strong, sweet malt and complex flavors, good heavy body (which I like). It has more of an alcohol bite than Im used to. I think its too strong and too expensive to drink a lot. Ive had better in this variety; I want to try the 5%."
"This is a beer that I would have again, very good example of a dubbel."
"Medium to full bodied, good drinkability especially at the ABV, not as sweet or candylike as a lot of dubbels."
"taste is light fruit, banana and apple with a background of musty aged wood. this beer accomplishes this complexity with carbonation and crisp flavor and the lack of an overall stale/old body character. this beer gives westvleteren a run for its money. i will buy more."
"I enjoyed this brew a lot. Pours with a golden huge with an excellent thick creamy white head. Aroma of orange peel and spices was very present. It felt rough and grainy on the palate, a nice mouthfeel I think. Taste of bananas, citrus, and cinnamon. I would definitely try again."
"All in all, this is a very nice dubbel. It was better than I expected especially after I had its disappointing tripel counterpart (Achel 8° Blond) not so long ago. Recommended!"
"I know I dont do it justice describing it, but I really liked this beer. Simply a great representation of a dark trappist ale."
"The smell was also nice, bringing mild esters on top of a solid malt base. The taste is rich and smooth, consisting of malt alongside various fruits. The flavor is good and it t is very easy to drink as well."
"Well worth trying and an excellent Brune, but the price is simply just too damn high for me to return to it in the USA, Ill save this one for when Im back in Belgium. Nevertheless, an excellent Brune and Highly Recommended!!!"
"330ml bottle, bought at Borough Market, London. Pours with a large light tan head, colour is brown, slightly hazy. Excellent aroma: Oak, sandalwood, camphor, caramel, toffee, spices. Flavour has caramel, spices, oak - but is not quite as complex as I hoped. Still very good - its a Trappist! Moderate but decent hops + spices in the finish."
"I like this beer very much, its also better than the blond version. A nice trappist brew, not the best though :)"
"The drinkability is good for this type of beer the finish does not linger after a couple of minutes. This is a good beer."
"Notes: Though I'm not able to describe it very well, this is actually a very good beer with great drinkablilty."
"Sweet sugary malt flavors up front: burnt overripe bananas, brown sugar, and rum cake. Sweetness gives way to a wheat and banana bitterness mixed with spicy hops. Mouthfeel goes from thick to chewy. Finish stays bitter with echoes of dark, ripened fruit. Warming, but not alcoholic. A decent dubbel, but not as interesting/balanced as Westmalle's and many others."
"Go out and get this one today. If you can't get it, beermail me, I have access to plenty. I'd love to trade some plus my bottle of Cantillon Iris 2000 for some highly rated micros currently unavailble in my area."
"A nice appearance with a thick foam that stayes for a long time. Makes it off course hard to smell the beer but only a litle trace of malt and some yeastsmell but rather dull. Taste also nothing like I suspect from a real trappist. Medium bodied and no great aftertaste too. Next time rather go the extra road for a Westvleteren. But about achel; it's a good place for a nice walk in the green and with a couple of Achelbottles most certaily a great enjoyment.."
"734"
"Murky looking brown tone. Big ol fluffy light tan head. Retention is outstanding. Lacing is quite good. Soft belgian malts and candy on the nose. Just a little must and some cotton candy to boot. Sweet malts and rock candy form a base with stale hops in the backdrop. Slightly sour and very slightly acidic. An agreeable taste but not a memorable one. The body is light and the mouthfeel is airy."
"Intensely fruity, cloying at times, pleasing at others. Soft, velvety backround. Mellow, woven fruit flavors of plums, mixes berries, orange and grape. The fruit flavor in this beer was stupendous. What was missing was the big, malty chocolate and caramel backround that I have come to expect in dark Belgians. With a little tweaking of the recipe, I can't imagine this beers dominance."
"Unmistakably a beautiful, serene, velvety, nearly uncomplicated beer. Ideal for an intro to the Trappist way."
"A hazy russet brown body swirls particles of yeast at the base of the goblet as its bubbles rise steadily to take their place beneath its full head of dark ivory froth. The head holds well, dropping slowly as you progress through the goblet, but leaves only minor lacing. The nose is more restrained than most of the beers from the other Trappist breweries, but it does offer some sweetish, sugar-cookie like malt, red grape-like fruitiness, and delicate alcohol. It's effervescent carbonation is fine enough (from bottle conditioning) that it tingles the tongue, rather than prickling it. And there's enough body to put it solidly in the ""medium"" category and smooth it out a bit as well. More fruit is present in the flavor (particularily in the finish), and the malt takes on more of a doughy character which gives it a little bit more depth, but the alcohol is also more intense. It lends a distinct peppery quality which teams with the spicy yeastiness to help balance the malt, but it's also a little bit hot as well. Additionally, some banana and hints of tropical fruit due to the higher alcohol esters become apparent as it warms but don't have enough intensity to lend any more depth to the beer. Instead, they kind of detract from what maltiness is there. Overall, it's a decent enough beer, but it's slightly out of balance with its higher alcohols and pales in comparison to their just slightly stronger Achelse Kluis (as well as many other Trappist and abbaye ales). A trepidacious thumbs up on this one... there are better beers available at better prices."
"Recommended over the blonde."
"A quite drinkable beer if it weren't for the 7$ price tag on the 12oz."
"Among the ensemble of trappist beers I've tasted, achel 8° brune left me a bit disappointed. even so, it certainly has a very interesting, opaque dark brown pour with a slight head and some presence of yeast; The taste was spiced up and considerably malty, and the body is thick and pleasant, with some carbonation still standing. Not very bitter. It's ok but i'm sticking to the Westies and Chimays."
"Murky brown with vague reddish-gold highlights, the off-white head reached about a finger in height. There is a massive amount of sediment suspended in my glass; I didnt notice it in the bottle, doh! Head retention was fair; it did start to dissipate almost immediately. The appearance, as whole, is satisfactory; the dandruff in the glass is annoying. Subsequent lacing was nonexistent. The nose is malty sweet with raisins, cola, airy pepper, sea salt and yeast; every other whiff or so I could get a hint of the alcohol. If it was more potent it might have been more inviting or at least exciting. The bouquet is a bit dull. The palate is much more enhanced than the nose indicated, apples, bananas, and pears upfront. In the middle it gets a little tart and some sweetness like a cola becomes more noticeable. A bit of toasty caramel and candied sugar finishes the beer. The aftertaste is awfully yeasty. Yuck. The flavors work well enough and it has moments of tastiness but they are few and far between. However the lack of body is too perceivable, its medium-light at best and far too thin for a Dubbel. The carbonation is quite massive and bothersome. I dont think this aspect of the beer is any good at all. In fact Im not really impressed with any aspect of this beer. It is quite average. The nicest thing I can say is the brewers hid the alcohol well. This is as lousy as Chimay Red. I need not drink it again. I bought my 11.2-ounce bottle in Iowa City."
"This is a great Trappist ale. It is ruby-brown in color with a yeasty, fruity, spicy aroma. It is malty with some spicy phenols. It is complex and creamy and has a warming finish. There is not much info on the labnel so I have little idea on how old this particular bottle is. I only know that it has been in my possesion for about a year now."
"Make no mistake, though, a really tasty beer here!"
"Light sweet and malty. Not too complex. Chunky yeast pieces in dark brown cloudy liquid. Small lacing head. Med-heavy body & med carb. Light sugary malts. Toffee. Raisins. Finish brings out decent bitterness. Nice after- nutty, sweet. A good offering."
"Overall Impression: Not as wow-ing as the 8 deg Blonde which was the first Achel brew I tasted. A pretty good brune/dubbel, but a far cry from something like Rochefort 8."
"Overall, a very enjoyable beer!"
"Not a bad dubbel, but not a world beater either. Still, if I saw it around again, I might consider having it, depending on how much a bottle."
"Drinkability: see mouthfeel while I have another."
"Muddy brown with a hint of orange color with a thick tan colored head that leaves decent lacing in the goblet. Bottle dated best before 5/04. Protein coagulation and particle suspension evident. Smells of yeast, dark malts, and dark candi sugar with a smidge of spiciness. Not particularly the most complex Trappist I've tried, but the flavor is there, the alcohol punch is there, and it's rather smooth. Like other Trappist ales, I couldn't drink them back-to-back because I reserve them for ""special treats"". I must admit that I was slightly disappointed by this one, the only brand in the Trappist family I'd yet to try."
"Pours a deep mahogany, with a large tan head that mostly diminishes, leaving good amounts of lacing. Aroma is dark fruits (mostly raisin), backed with some bready maltiness. Flavor is sweet, somewhat fruity (raisin), and some doughie malts. Medium body."
"This beer poured a dark murky brown with very thin, almost nonexistent off-whte head. The smell was predominately yeast, with only a faint bit of malt. The flavor had alcohol notes, a bit of spiciness, and some fruity esters and phenols tossed in. The mouthfeel felt thin to me, and the taste just didn't seem all that great."
"Murky brown, with lovely off white lasting head. Smelt of yeast, raisins, and a touch of orange and citrus aswell and perhaps some toffee. The palate was definitely yeasty, but nicely soft, rounded and long. Quite raisiny, with some late citrus orange, some nice late bitterness, and some slight acid."
"Poured out a murky light brown with quite a bit of sediment. Smell was restrained, malty and sweet. Taste was good, slightly sugary with the raisiny fruity overtones I would expect, but without the robustness of a Rochefort. Overall a nicely drinkable beer, but for the price, I'll stick with a St Bernardus.."
"The beer pours a nebulous deep brown color, the head portly in size, frothy in structure, the color a light tan with the residual lace a nice coating upon the glass. Nose is a bit plummish, sweet malt, fresh and pleasant to the senses with a sweet malt start and the top middling in its feel to the palate. Finish is stingingly acidic, the hops purposeful in their spicy bite, quite dry aftertaste and a nice warming sensation from the relatively high ABV, Quite a drinkable beer, and much better than the blond."
"This beer poured a very cloudy dark brown with some sediment present. It formed a nice off white bubbly head that left circular lace. Some carbonation is present. An aroma of malt, caramel and a touch of cherry. A flavor of malt and caramel. The finish was a touch astrigent with a bit of sweetness to it. Overall I am not as big on dubbels as other styles of Belgians. But all in all, this is another nice beer from this brewer."
"Maybe I just don't get Dubbel, but I don't particularly enjoy this. Best before date of May, 2004."
"A carefull pour produced a nearly crystal clear, deep, rosey amber color and a thick and foamy, off-white head with specks of lace trailing behind. Slightly musty aroma of apples and cherries steeped in alcohol with sharp, yeasty phenolic notes. Flavor is reminiscent of toasted rye bread with rock candy sweetness and subtle hints of fruit combined with dry, grassy hops. The finish is very dry and warm with cidery tartness. Remarkably balanced and drinkable."
"Drinkability: Damn good, but it's a step lower on the ladder than the Blonde of the same strength. Again, the alcohol is hidden quite well, making it go down way too easy. Whatever the monks at Achel are doing, they're doing it right. Damn good stuff..."
"It poured a beautiful copper color with very good foam. The aroma was modest, and mostly malt. The taste was sweet and malty -- nice. The mouthfeel was very nice: good carbonation, smooth, and crisp. The drinkability was good. A very good dark, strong ale."
"PS: I don't know if these Achel beers are imported to the US of A yet, but they can be had for a reasonable price from Belgianshop.com!"
