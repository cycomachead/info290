"Smells a bit like champagne or white wine, has a nice looking foam which disappears very slow comparing to many other beers. Overall very light, so as the 8 degree alcohol within this one which is close to unnoticeable."
""
""
"Solid and straightforward; plenty of sweet, roasty malt and frothy carbonation which makes for an enjoyable experience. Not especially complex, but the flavors and aromas that are present are enjoyable. The alcohol is a bit boozy for my taste but not uncharacteristic for the style."

"Hazy brown beer with nice beige head, excellent retention. Smell of hazelnuts, dark fruits, toffee, smoke. Flavour of dark fruits, candy sugar, yeasts, smoke notes, very complex, balance between sweetness, sourness and bitterness. Medium bodied, slightly alcoholic brew. Magnificent!"

"They had lots of stuff hand written about it being a handmade cloister beer, so they're right in that they're an Abbey beer. At 8%, I was concerned for my sobriety, but what the hell. Surprisingly, it had lots of banana flavors and virtually no bitterness, but had a few sour notes, so it was leaning towards an Oud Brun. The alcohol was hidden well in a very caramel-forward beer. 4."

"Pours a hazy dark crimson-brown with a foamy khaki head that settles to a partial film on top of the beer. Foamy swaths of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, dark fruit, alcohol, and slight smoke aromas. Taste is much the same with smoke and dark fruit flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of smoke bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that is fairly tasty but the smoke presence I am getting is unexpected for the style."
"O: A very satisfying and drinkable brune. The 8% ABV is mostly well hidden."
""
"This is a good beer but with decent flavor but what throws me off is the sourness like one might taste in a Flanders style. In any event a pretty likeable brew."
""

"Poured from a stubby brown bottle into a goblet. Dark, reddish brown with one inch of beige head. Thined slowly but left lots of pretty lacing all around. Aroma was malts and for the first time I get the ""bread"" description for beer. Mouthfeel heavy in a good way. Maybe substantial instead of heavy, you know it's there but it isn't a burden. I picked up some nuttyness, brown suger and some alchol. I got this one on a whim with no expectations. I'll get it with malice of fore thought next time."

"Pours a hazy brownish dark red with one finger thick cream colored head. Settles to a thin ring, with a few thick rings left down the glass. Smell: brown bread, baker's chocolate, cooked red apple with a brown sugar and cinnamon dusting. Taste: upfront it's ripe pear and toasted brown bread with a slight alcohol note, then into powdery unsweet chocolate, red apple skin, cinnamon and (very mild) anise. Mid sip there's some balance from a mild earthy hopping. Medium bodied with fluffy carbonation, juicy towards the end of the sip before a semi-dry, spice accompanied finish. Nice dessert compliment or dessert itself. Cork stamped 10/12."

"This is a medium bodied brew with a slick, modest amount of carbonation that was perfect for the style. Overall it was a decent take on the style with the aroma being a bit underwhelming but the flavor really picking things up. My only gripe is that the flavor and residual malt character almost had a bit of piercing sweetness that stung the back of the throat. Having dried this out just a little bit would have helped to increase the overall enjoyable and drink-ability. As-is I almost feel guilty like I should go take a shot of insulin to counteract the sweetness of this brew."
"750 ml bottle into chalice, 02/09 cork dating. Pours lightly hazy dark reddish brown color with a nice 1-2 finger light khaki head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Spotty foamy lacing clings to the glass. Aromas of big raisin, prune, caramel, toffee, toast, chocolate, molasses, herbal, earth, clove, pepper, and yeast spices. Damn excellent aromas with great balance and complexity. Taste of raisin, prune, toffee, toast, bread, molasses, chocolate, herbal, earth, clove, and yeast spices. Lingering notes of dark fruit, molasses, caramel, toffee, toast, biscuit, nuttiness, earth, and clove on the finish for a good bit. Nice balance and complexity of flavors; no cloying sweetness at all on the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full body; with a fairly creamy and slick mouthfeel that is very nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming noticed well after the finish. Overall this is a highly excellent Dubbel! Great flavor complexity and balance; and very smooth to sip on. Highly enjoyed this one."
"This brew pours a rich, dark brown with a two finger off white head that dissipates rather quickly. There is a decent amount of lacing left on the interior glass. On the nose, I get some malt and coffee. On the next sniff, I get some chocolate on it and a hint of smoke. This is one of the more complex noses that I’ve had on a beer. On first sip, there’s a decent amount of sweetness to this brew with a very subtle hint of bitterness. I get dates, some coffee notes and chocolate. I also get a bit of brown sugar. There is a lot going on with this beer. The alcohol, despite being pretty high for 8%, is completely hidden. There is also moderate carbonation on this brew. I also thought that this was going to a heavy beer due to the color, but this is a lot lighter than I thought it would be. The finish on the brew is mildly bitter and lingers. This is an awesome beer that is full of complexities and nuances. I will definitely be trying more Belgians if they’re at all like this."
"O - This is a fair brown that was below what I anticipated. It may just be the bottle I received, but this is far from the better Dubbel's I have come across."

"Overall I was positively surprised, this is a beer to take your time with and it doesn't give you much of a choice in the matter either. It was surprisingly stoutlike at times yet always smooth and subtle."

"Val-Dieu! just doesn't resound as well as Mon Dieu! does it? Oh well, this stuff pours a somewhat dingy brown topped by a finger of cream foam and populated by some minor floaties. The nose comprises caramel, toffee, light cardboard, light walnut, and light white bread. The taste holds notes of caramel, light dark fruits, light cardboard, and a touch of rye bread. Methinks oxidation has gotten to this, but it's not in the usual way, so that's questionable at this point. Still, it ain't half bad. The body is a light-leaning medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a sorta/kinda dry finish. Overall, a pretty good dubbel, but nothing close to exceptional or special."
"This is an abbey beer brewed with great craftsmanship. It's balanced and has an unexpected taste."

"O: I have a particular love for this brewery, though I still prefer the Blonde to the Brune. A solid dubbel, though not as a rich in malt character as some others, and the mouthfeel could use some cleaning up. Still, the flavors blend nicely and the yeast character is particularly interesting."

"O - Very nice Belgian Dubbel. Had no expectations going into this one...happy with what I found. Not my favorite style (prefer the hoppier stuff), but this works quite nicely. A semi-slow drinker...should get me through most of the rest of the night."
"Good lacing and fingers around glass. Dark brown in color. with a low head. Head is a oatmeal cream color. Rustic oak smell; strong with subtle esters of alcohol and belgian hops. Subtle taste not too strong in any one area. A slight sourness but very very subtle. My palette can't really put a finger on the taste of this but I like it. there are a lot of complexities going on with this beer but somehow it remains subtle. Carbonation is nice. Right in between. A very good beer. Too bad I bought it in a box set and have not seen this anywhere else. The tripel seems to have even better reviews can't wait to try that."
"Poured a medium brown with a large rocky off white head that was mostly lasting and had excellent lacing. The aroma was of toasted malts, a leathery yeast and a slight herbal hop with notes of molasses and coffee. It tasted lighty sweet and sour at first and ended slightly bitter with a strong hint of coffee and a slight alcohol finish that lasted a short time on the palate. Mouthfeel was medium in body and oily in texture with a flat carbonation. Overall a tasty abbey ale."
"D: Goes down super smooth and a great balance of flavor. Perfect for a chilly night!"
"Overall a very good dubbel although still not one of the best. A good value and worth a try if you're into the style."
"Pours a very dark cloudy colour with lots of bubbles (strongly carbonated) and a very nice creamy tan head with amazing lacing. initial smell is quite weak, not very strong. dark roasts and alcohol with toffee, taste is quite the same with a hint of added yeast. very refreshing. this is the second bier i have had by val dieu and i can honestly say that these beers are two of the finest beers i have ever tried."
"D: Must slow down. This is 8%..."
"Not a bad brew at all. It's drinkable, meant for wet cold fall evenings. Nice example of the style."
"Bottle: Poured a clear dark burgundy color ale with a large off-white foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of sweet fruit ester and candi sugar is quite enticing and enjoyable. Taste is a proper mix between some candi sugar with notes of fruity ester and a medium sweet malt backbone. Body is a bit light for style with great carbonation and light creamy texture which is quite good with no apparent alcohol. Very nice for the style and something I wouldn't mind drinking more often."
"D) Very good beer; classic Belgian Dubbel"
"When all is said and done, this beer is at least as good as Triple and Blond. Only Winter (also known as Grand Cru) is superior. If you have a hankering for a classic Belgian dubbel, Val-Dieu Brune will scratch that itch will no trouble at all."
"Alcohol is hidden and this is very drinkable. One of the better dubbels I have had."
"Drinkability: Close to being really good, but just too much alcohol flavor there. There are definitely better dubbels out there."
"Drinkability: a solidly drinkable dubbel. I could easily go on quaffing this all night."
"D: Very drinkable, but I'd say one or two will do it... Sit back and enjoy this one."
"D: Good balance for all the big flavors. Masks the abv fairly well."
"Buy it!"
"D: fairly drinkable and pleasant"
"D: I drank about half of this and then drainpoured it. Best by date was a year from now, so I'm not sure if I got a bad bottle or not, but I was not happy with this one."
"this one is very drinkable for a 8% beer, may or may not finish this during the Final Four. This is a dubbel that I was pleased with at for the price (8.99) it is good value. would revisit this easily"
"D: Very high in drinkability, this is a beer anybody could get used to have. The balance in this beer is awesome."
"D: I was through my bottle in a flash. This beer goes down easy and the alcohol is so well hidden that the beer's strength can't be felt until a warm feeling hits at the end of the glass. A very nicely put together beer."
"D - Very good and easy going dubbel. Would like to have more in the future."
"OVERALL: An absolutely phenomenal double. This one ranks up there with the best doubles in Belgium. If you're a fan of the style, make sure to pick this one up if you see it. Recommended."
"D: good, easy sipper"
"Notes: I was pleasantly surprised by this beer which strikes me as an English Brown Ale but not the dubbel that it has been assigned."
"Not sure I'd drink a lot of this. As I finish this, I have no urge for another, which I'm going to rate as ""average"" since it's a dubbel, and I've never ordered a second dubbel despite my fondness for the style."
"Taste is mild, but clean and crisp. Very smooth and satisfying, afterall...it's a dubbel, but looks like a quad. Hard to put a finger on a specific fruit, but sweet taste from fruits. Goes down easy...great brew."
"I've been listening about this beer for a long time so, I was able to find it in my new favorite beer store in Switzerland ""Au Grain D'Orge"". Something like ""At the Barley Beans"" :). Back to the beer. It's a classic Belgian Double (Dubbel) beer, first of all, quite good one! It has a brown-red amber color and smells like coffee, chocolate and brown malt. Quite good taste that would be better if we could feel less alcohol. In average, satisfying beer. Looking forward to taste their Quad one."
"This poured a hazy dark mahogany with lots of light tan head. It smelled like faint cocoa powder and creamy yeast, with some brown sugar and a slight amount of lemon hops. It tasted like caramel and brown sugar, with bready yeast and some cocoa powder, and a bit of coffee and alcohol. It was slightly thick with some carbonation, and had a bittersweet aftertaste. Overall this was a nice beer with good scent, taste, and body. It wasn't very complex or bold, but it was a bit unique with hints of a stout. It was easy to drink, almost seeming like a session beer despite weighing in at 8% ABV. I'm not sure if age would improve this one. The beer was interesting and enjoyable once, but I'm not sure if it was quite good enough for me to come back to it again."
"This is very drinkable, the 8% is evident straight away, but because of its richness and fullness of body, the alcohol doesn't take over and ruin the experience."
"Poured into a goblet for a dark brown body with a tan head and some lace patches. An intense malt smell with some roasted, caramel, chocolate and coffee malts along with a little yeast and some dark fruits tucked in there. Great smooth and creaminess in a medium body with caramel, chocolate, toffee, coffee, roasted malts along with figs for a sticky, sweet and dry finish. The malts dominate but there are some fruits like orange and apple pie crust as well for that dryish, bready taste with hints of fruitiness. Overall, a sweet malty double with a plethora of flavors that I am not doing justice; one of the better Belgians I've had and great for after dinner."
"11.2 ounce bottle depicts a painting of the brewery or abbey. Best before date reads 15/02/10. Poured into a Kasteel chalice the beer forms a lovely 2 finger head which holds for several minutes. Dark, dark chocolate brown color with solid carbonation feeding the head. Floaties are abound and in full force. Thick laces paste themselves to the glass throughout the drink. A very attractive beer. Nose is subtle, nothing over powering here but definitely dark roasted malts and some dark fruit make their presence known. Taste is very smooth, alcohol is well hidden and hops are hiding in the background until the finish. Medium bodied, note nearly as thick on the palate as I expected. Was very surprised that the beer was as smooth and mellow as it was . .. looks had me thinking it was going to be strong and warming and this beer tasted more like something I could session; dangerous given the ABV here. Overall, a very enjoyable brew and probably a good one to give a newbie to the belgian beer world."
"this brew pours up a solid brown color with a decent off white head. Tons of lacing on my glass and tons of yeast flakes roaming around like a bunch of bums that just got let loose on a money tree farm. i smell a big nutty malt aroma, delicious, some yeast. i taste big malts, nutty flavor, dark red apples, crisp hop background in the finish, no real bitterness though. full bodied, low to medium carbo. a pretty badass beer!"
"If one prefers the sweeter side of beer, this may be a good recommedation. Although it is not among the elite of Belgian Dubbels, it is still a good beer."
"Drinkability: While not exactly a classic of the style, it remains a sweet, pleasant dubbel."
"Drinkability : a good beer in the style Belgian Dubbel."
"Pours a very dark brown almost black color with a very slim head that quickly dissapears, generating not lacing. Had a strong nectar/ grape aroma. This beer taste more like a wine than a beer with not enough maltiness to balance out the sweet vinuous character."
"A nice, malty, but well-balanced, sipper with quite a bit of subtle complexities to it. A delicious dubbel with a great feel!"
"Poured into a Val-Dieu chalice a dark amber/brown/crimson red color with a small amount of foam that fell into a nice cap and left behind plenty of thick lacing. Aroma of chocolate and dark bready, yeasty notes. Taste is similar to nose. Toasted bread, hints of baker's chocolate, a dry yeasty finish. Semi-sweet, delicious, and goes down quite easily. I'm not generally a big fan of dubbels, but this one was great!"
"p.s. i found that this had a best by date of 13 months ago. i am guessing that it was kept in a good place and is likely to be a style of beer that ages well."
"D: This beer is a sipper but quite good. I really enjoyed this beer and was shocked that is was free. I was actually expecting this to be crap, but it turned out to be great. Really enjoyed this beer."
"D: I found it drinkable, but I didnt find a flavor profile that really begged for more."
"drinkability - Easy drinking but at the same time you know that it is a strong beer,"
"I enjoyed this beer"
"Overall, this was one tasty beer. Very easy drinking. The bottle went by way to quickly. Highly recommended."
"D: great drinkability factor. Very rich and highly recommended."
"If you like brown ales this is one of the better examples of this style. It's definitely a drinkable beer."
"Overall : A very drinkable brune. if they kicked up the aroma on this beer it would be all the better. A great all around beer, but not one I'll dream about on my deathbed."
"Overall, out of the three beers in the gift set (blonde,tripel, and brown) this is the best, and most complex. Worth a taste, I'm sure you will enjoy!"
"Pours a clear dark ruby with minimal off white head. If you pour the whole bottle in (sediment and all), you get a cloudy ruby (and the nose is noticeably more yeasty). Nose is a cross of old grape skins and cherries with a syrup edge. Flavor is pretty interesting. Starts off tangy and almost bitter in a way. Constant sweet tone with a doughy edge to it towards the tail end. With all the sediment in there, the subtle changes are less noticeable and it tends to stay an even, slightly caramel brew. Feel has a great level of carbonation on it. Pretty drinkable, though that 8% will get to ya quick."
"I've spent too much time deliberating over the age of a beer. l'm overgeeked! ""Is it at its best now?"" Geez! what a pain! This is fresh stuff and it's really good. It's great to have something out of the kettle and great to taste. I feel liberated from the annoying deliberation of appropriateness. Drink it now. This is good (really good) fresh. No waiting is required."
"D: This is a really good beer, very tasty on-tap, surprised me a little bit of how good it was, I'll definitely order this again, a great brown beer."
"Pours a nice dark brown that you cannot penetrate. Leaves nice lacing and pours pillowy head which follows your sips down the tulip. Smells of peaches, apricots, and pears. Taste is very fruity. Twingy pears and apricots pleasure the taste buds. Very warming..nice fall-winter brew. Pretty drinkable, although high in alcohol. Does have a slight alcohol taste that can be perceived as unpleasant. Is very sour as well. A decent overall dubbel."
"Finish is medium long and rather sweet. More cola on the finish. Very nice."
"D-This was not what i was expecting. This is dangerously good. not really sweet, it was more bitter with high quality cocoa beingn the dominant flavour. Very nicely done."
"Good red/brown bodied beer. There was a bit of head as I was pouring but it disappeared quickly leaving no trace of its presence. Nice malty aroma. There is a bit of spice in there and some breadiness. The flavor is sweet and malty with that same bit of spice, but it is a bit think and lacks the intensity that I'd like. The spice seems to take over as the beer warms up. The body is also not quite where it should be. It is fairly light for a dubbel. A decent beer all around, but not among my favorite dubbels."
"but the yeast taste was not as strong and stinggy like many belgian blonds. Dark malts and very subtle sweetness in addition to a slight breadiness was detected as it moves into a grassy yeasty taste on the finish which is reminiscent of the initial smell; the finish was also very slightly bitter. I did not think I detected much of fruits in the taste but in the after taste I believe I pick up plums and grapes with some breadiness; a little fruity aroma on the nose as well. Beer was of a moderage body with a sufficiently high carbonation level; it was smooth but instead of creamy smooth which was what it looked to be; it was more of the watery smooth. It was a relatively refreshing compared to many of the belgian brunes as well. On the whole, I find that this beer was more like a blond than a brune though every inch of it looks like a brune. Quite interesting though I would have preferred it more like a brune."
"I had this on tap at the Brasserie V in Madison, WI, a new restaurant and tap room. Really a great place, a constant rotation of 15 beers on tap, most of them Belgian imports. Served in it's own goblet, this beer was a lighter brown color, and smelt of coffee and roasted malt overtones. A solid Belgian yeast taste with a bit more of a roasty character than other Dubbel's I've had. A very solid beer, but at 8% it's not a session beer. Very tasty."
"Wonderful beer. 750ml bottle served in a goblet. Dark red/brown in color with a thick head that retains very well. Dark fruit, chocolate, and caramel in the aroma. Very yeasty and malty taste, with the fruits and a little coffee also. A real mouthful, but a great beer to savor. Alcohol not noticeable."
"Cheers!"
"I picked this up on a whim from Gary's Liquor in the OC (Oak Creek, WI). I didn't know exactly what to expect, although I was anticipating an abbey dubbel that would be spiced with coriander and clove. Instead, I got a beer that redder in color than I anticipated (it is called a brown on the label), more earthy and cherry-ish in flavor than I thought, and to be honest I really enjoyed this beer a good bit more than I thought I would."
"D- It's good. I could have a couple... but not for the four bucks I paid for this twelver. There are much better dubbels out there."
"The beer poured a nice dark brown with a decent head that was mostly lasting. The aroma was malty with loads of dried fruits. The taste was greatly complex featuring dried fruits, molasses, coffee with some roasted malt and chocolate as well. The beer was medium bodied and the alcohol was not too strong at all. This was a very enjoyable beer."
"D - A very good dubbel. This was the first I've had from Val-Dieu and it is yet another good Belgian beer."
"Gave this brew a try last evening and was not disappointed. Brew was poured into a Duval glass and had a nice reddish brown color with a thick tan head that had great retention, actually had a head the entire time, and left sheets of lace down the side if the glass. Aromas of toasted and roasted malts/grains are noticeable right away but also tend to have a sweet smell while also picking up some darker scents almost like fresh ground coffee. This is a fantastic aromatic brew. The taste is very inviting, very smooth with a sweet taste upfront that seems to have some brown sugar properties. The malts really seem to give it a good roasted flavor that tends to be quite robust giving it a darker feel. At the end, hops are slightly noticeable and give it great balance. This is a fantastic brew and I really wish I would have tried it a long time ago. This one is a keeper."
"Most of all this beer has a blindingly good smell that changes from start to finish but stays amazing. This with the mouthfeel makes this a real champagne. Come to think of it, I might have to break out my chisel to remove the dried lace from my glass. True, the taste could be fuller-bodied and the smell could hold up better at warmth against the malts, but really, this is what Belgian browns are all about."
"Cheers!"
"D: Excellent interplay between the flavors and aromas. The alcohol presence is felt but it's not intrusive. Very nice balance. The roasted flavors make this a very interesting Dubbel."
"d: smooth & easy to drink. lots more going on in this beer than i've noted here, but definitely worth another round or two to find more."
"Poured this out of a bottle. Immediately noticed a dark brown colour with a thin white head. The aroma was surprisingly average; I would have expected a stronger smoky smell. As for the taste, it was a good kind of bitter. It had an intense level of carbonation. It was so strong that I nearly coughed. The mouthfeel was very smooth. Considering it was 8% ABV, one could not notice it. I would be able to a few in one sitting. I would have it again."
"Overall: A really good Dubbel, a bit underwhelming on the finish or for long-term drinking, but quite good overall. Recommended."
"Served in my Val-Dieu chalice, the beer pours dark brown with about an inch off-white head. It smells like dark fruit, caramel and sweet malt. It tastes like caramel, nuts, dark fruit, and then has a slight fruity sour finish. The mouthfeel is medium, with it being a bit slick and creamy at the same time. Carbonation is moderate, not too high. Drinkability is pretty good, it's easy to drink and the 8% ABV is well hidden but catches up to you after a while. Overall I think it's a good beer, I'd drink it again."
"Pours a deep, dark, dense brown with a decent head that dissipated all too quickly. Nose is of malt and fruit. Taste is malty sweet leading to a dry fruity finish. Medium-bodied and good carbonation, feels good in the mouth. A very drinkable Belgian, could easily have a few."
"Perfect drinkability. The 8% alcohol is completely hidden. What a great beer."
"This beer poured a dark brown color with a huge head. The smell is very malty and caramel like. The taste is strong of malt with a touch of coffee and a bit of a sour aftertaste. The mouthfeel is heavy but balanced with high carbonation that gives an interesting sensation in the mouth. I'd never heard of this beer before today, but must say I'm very pleased and will be looking for another soon."
"This one's been in my fridge for four years. Served into a Chimay chalice. Still well carbonated, the cork comes out with a pop and it pours a dark brown with a firm tan head. Nose is malty with fruit notes like apricot, and a subtle spiciness underneath it. Malt is lighter in the flavor than the nose, but pleasantly bready; tart fruity notes amount, apricot and peach like to my tongue; bitterness is on the low side but a light acidity balances the sweetness in the finish. Body feels surprisingly light and crisp."
"Not the best dubbel I ever had, but decent."
"In a small goblet, forms a little glass ring of light tan bubbles over a dark ruby/brown body. The nose is full of slight tart cherries, caramel, and berries. Taste is mildly sour, with a bit of an alcoholic taste. The flavors in the nose show up in the taste, but to a lesser extent. The mouth is light, with adequate carbonation. A mild, sour dubbel."
"This is a very pretty beer. It pours with a delicate eggshell head that sticks and sticks, and a body of layered, gradually deepening mahogany. Heavily phenolic nose with some dates and clove in the background. On the palate, slight, light sweetness up front, nuttiness in the mid-palate, and slightly sour fruits toward the end. The finish is grainy like some scotch whiskies. Lightness in mouthfeel is sustained throughout. Very drinkable, with light, not syrupy flavors and not too much ABV."
"Drinkability - this is good, and I'd have one more in any given session, but it's not really a session beer, and anyway, high abv would limit drinkability."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable beer, though not as complex and full-flavored as some other belgians I've drunk recently. Slightly lighter flavor might make this good summer drinking or alternately commend this to those people who like craft brews but not big beers."
"This is enjoyable to drink with a slick and creamy mouthfeel not typically characteristic to this style. A unique Belgian brown second only to Leffe Brune in my opinion. Certainly worth buying / trying a few given the opportunity."
"a subtle masterwork"
"Poured from a small stub bottle, this beer has a massive quilt-like head. Thick and off-white, the head leaves an enchanting lace. The color of the liquid is a deep mahogany. Small bits of yeast float happily in the brew, but there really isnt any cloudiness. The aroma is intense and multi-dimensional: lots of fruit and yeast, spicy phenols and a little sugar, caramel and fresh dark bread. The smell has a bit of alcohol in the mix as well. The taste is malty and sweet, with a thick, doughy quality. Nice bitterness to balance, with lots of carbonation. The beer is just a little slick on the tongue. Medium-full body, soft, and with fair complexity, this is a satisfying beer."
"""Brewing returned to the abbey grounds in 1996... making this the only non-Trappist monastery in Belgium where beer is produced. However, no monks brew; in fact none live at Val-Dieu. Christian families, who offer the grounds as a place for retreat, manage the complex."""
"Presentation: Packaged in a 22 ounce brown glass bomber with a cork and cage closure, served in a Belgian chalice."
" Medium-light body. Moderate carbonation. Mouthfeel was a bit thin to me."
"Taste; starts off with dark roasted malts, choclate and caramel, and just a bit on the sugary side. The dark fruits come out nicely, but melds well with the little bit of alcohol that comes through. There's a bit of spices, with some corriander and maybe some cloves, with a little hop bitterness thrown into the mix. Mouthfeel is medum bodied.. Even with the sweetness the drinkablitly is pretty high on this one."
"Pours out looking like suede leather with a miniscule, but very frothy, white head. Some pleasant lace is found. Very low carbonation. Aromas are spicy and smell richly of fruits: banana, grapes, pears. Theres a soft sweetness in the nose that reminds me of fruit-filled pastries. Slight alcohol plays well with all that I'm smelling. I don't get nearly as much yeasty spice from the taste as I did with the aromas, which is good. I'm not too fond of overly phenolic dubbels. Tastes very much like that pastry scent I got earlier. Like fruit-filled sweetbread. Also tastes strongly of grapes; not so much vinous as of the unfermented juice. The alcohol is present enough to offer some sort of balance to the sweet, as I really don't pick up anything in the way of hops. The mouthfeel, as the visual lack of carbonation would suggest, is very mellow but seems kind of light. This abbey goes down quick, but sits a bit heavy on the stomach, although this is working as a nice digestif."
"If I was forced to use one word to sum up this beer I'd use adequate. Not average as that implies toeing the minimalist line. This is good, though nothing to remember. Pour is nice, murky brown with a minor white head. nose is floral, with white grapes and sugar. Nothing to do a double take over. Taste is pretty good ... brown sugar, caramel, rose petals, and sugar mixed with spices. Good but not one you'll search for when looking for a good belgian. Mouthfeel is again, servicable. I could have another but wouldn't be sad if the answer was ""none left"". Decent brew that makes little impression."
"Drinkability- If easier found this would be one of my go to Dubbels. Worth the $4 I paid for it."
"Poured a deep slightly hazy amber with a few small floaties swirling around with a big fluffy white head that leaves sheets of lace behind as it settles into a creamy froth.Aromas are spiced like that of cinnamon and phenolic clove a touch of sweet cookie dough as well.A smooth creamy-like mouthfeel lends well to the rich flavors of this beer somewhat clovey and light sweet a touch of semisweet chocolate but not overbearing finishing with a slight dryness.Not a bad dubbel I dont drink many of this style,this one I enjoyed."
"Drinkability: Quite good. A bit sweet (but what dubbel isn't?) but very robust, balanced and controlled. A solid offering from this somewhat obscure brewer."
"Body hovers just below medium, with a sticky mouthfeel and expansive, bubbly texture. No trace of the 8% abv, rather high for this style. Again, very easy to put down a 750 meself. Would pair nicely with a burger or game."
"Drinkability: Hell yes I can have another, and maybe another. The alcohol presence is hardly felt, and when it is it works well and is never even close to overdone. One of my favorite Dubbel's now. No punches are pulled with having everything over the top, but it's extremely well balanced and dangerously drinkable."
"Taste is like wine-laced coffee, a roasted coffee. Alcohol isn't too overwhelming, but definitely present. Mouthfeel is slick and a bit tooo oily for me. Overall tasty, but far too sweet near the finish and alcoholic to drink a lot of. A bit out of balance, this one."
"As I sat back and drank this, I got a feel that this was the table beer for a belgian monastery; not a grande reserve complex celebratory brew or seasonal feast beer. But this was an ale that was to eat supper with; to drink for sustenance and every-day fulfillment. That being said; this was absolutely superb; fantastically drinkable. The only detractor at all was some of the citrus or funky yeast twang; but as the glass warms and oxygenates, that, as well, is forgiven."
"D: Very drinkable."
"In the end I thought this was an average to slightly above average Dubbel. I enjoyed the smoothness of the mouthfeel. Alcohol was subtle. Well put together brew. The best part was that the label said brown and it tasted brown, if that makes any kind of sense."
"Drinkability: Decent, but I feel it is lacking a bit of sweetness and complexity to be among the very best dubbels"
"A good dubbel. And although there are better beers available in this style, this one is still well-worth a try."
"Cheers."
"Medium body, fruity aftertaste, of dark fruit."
"Thick bodied. the alcohol is very noticeable but never overwhelming, fitting properly with what isn't too strong of a beer either. Quite pleasant either way."
"This is a really bad dubble...actually one of the worst I've had. Boo. Pass on this one."
"Aged just wonderfully. Same gentle but full flavor. The yeast element has faded out a bit replaced by a bit of cork, but no papery oxidation. Can't say that it's gotten better, but certainly held up nicely."
"Ut vivat, crescat, floreat!"
"The mouthfeel is moderate-full. The carbonation tickles the tongue just a wee bit towards the finish. Goes down easy and is drinkable for a high abv."
"Taste is good and strong too; dark caramelmalt taste, sweet, full and litle spicy make it a complex taste thats balanced and I can apriciate. Mouthfeel is as good as the taste and drinkability is also good if you want to enjoy and not just booze. Good brew that I can recomend."
"Drinkability: This is a beer worth trying and perhaps having again with the right meal. Overall, its slightly above average."
"I then drank some expecting a good beer, but wow. This was a dessert in a glass. No hops I could find, but I wasn't looking for them. The aroma was intense from the pumping action, the taste just burst through with malty roasty goodness- chocolate and dark candied fruits. Not too rich, though, just filling and pleasing, each sip getting better than the one before it. Just an incredible experience, an incredible beer experience. I was really sad when I finished this one, because I knew I wouldn't find anything else I liked as much afterward."
"Drinkability: Definately a beer I could consume regularly under these conditions (ie, the hand pump)."
"A decent Belgium and an easy drink. Lots of Lace. Aroma of yeast and bit of spice. Sediment. Bittersweet: malts and balanced with hops. Medium mouthfeel. Some sugar and carmel. A bit complex. Some coffee and mint. I have had better in this style, but this is satisfying."
"Bottle purchased from Beermania in Brussels. Poured into Chimay goblet. Really wonderful color, though the head was thin and short lived. Color was a reassuringly consistent bronze. Taste was light and fruity, but then fell off almost immediately. Second and third sips felt weak and flat. I may have chilled it too much, but even after letting it warm to something closer to room temperature, the character was the same. Sad to say that I wound up pouring half of it out. Am hoping that my next review will have better results."
"Drinkable but unremarkable. I see TheLongBeachBum comments and I might have gotten a bottle with a bad air seal or something. I will have to try another bottle from a different store."
"Recommended."
"Drinkability is high"
"Amber brown body was a bit hazy. The head was small in size and short lived. The lacing on the side of the glass was thin, but sticky. The aroma was typical dubbel with spices, brown sugar, roasty malt, and cookie dough. The taste was just what the aroma promised with a sweet and spicy front, a dry roasty middle, and mildly bitter aftertaste. Alcohol is strong at 8%, but is not apparent in the flavor profile. This is a nice beer, fitting very nicely among the now crowded rows of Belgian style bottles lining the shelves of Greens."
"Sharp and biting at first, then warming on the tongue with pear like quality. Finishes slightly bitter, but this is an exceptionally well balanced beer. Very good."
"Pours a clear deep amber color with a mountainous tan head that very slowly dissipates in chunks leaving behind a rocky head of lace that remains until the very end. Nose is dark bread, spicy yeast, and a bit of earthy tobacco. Moderate in body and fairly smooth in texture. Taste begins with caramelized malts and molasses followed by some unsweetened dark chocolate and some slightly bitter woody and leathery notes. Some bitter hops and traces of alcohol are present towards the finish. Pretty nice dubbel, though I prefer their tripel."
"Served at cellar temperature in a Chimay chalice. The cork had a date(?) 09-04, for what that's worth. It poured a super dark maroon, with a beige head. It had a malty aroma, laced with dark chocolate. Tastes were malt, lemon, leather, chocolate, clove, cinnamon, raisin. The mouthfeel was thin, with light carbonation. As I drank, the beer left dense sheets of lace on the glass. It finished with malt, leather, lemonpeel, and clove. Maybe not the best belgian I've ever had, but well worth having again. (and again, and again...)"
"since the bar i tend in stopped carrying these a year ago i end up getting them from the v.c. quite often and that's what i have to say about the drinkability."
"Chocolate, coffee, dark fruits and frosting were all around. This was pretty well hopped Belgian as well. However, I found it to be a little to thin in the mouth for it to taste great."
"Sampled at From The Vine beer tasting Jan 9th, 2004: It's not often that I get to try two beers in a row with the word ""Dieu"" in them. The beer is a dark reddish-brown with a medium thick and somewhat creamy white head. Decent lacing. The aroma consists of faint nuts and malt. Medium bodied and bubbly, with lots of malt and alcohol at first, then accompanied by hops and raisin flavors shortly after. The finish is mostly fruity alcohol with a touch of sourness. Not too bad."
"On tap at Lucky Baldwin's it's brown with just a trace of red when held to the light. The off-white head sits on top like whipped cream. Every time the glass moves, waves of foam work their way up the side of the glass. An earthy smell and aroma are backed by a sugary rush that has undertones of banana and other fruit but is mainly just pure unadulterated sweetness. This seems a bit of a strange combination, but it all comes together very nicely. The mouthfeel is reminiscent of a milk shake. This is one fine beer."
"11.9 oz bottle pours into a goblet a garnet brown color with a tan head that has moderate retention before falling into sheets of lace. Aroma is of toffee and molasses, with lots of fruity florals(banana), and a hint of alcohol. Mouthfeel has active carbonation and is medium bodied. Taste is toffee banana served on fresh baked bread. Alcohol is well concealed here. Pleasant fruity, candy, maltiness sustains all the way through, without any bitterness or distractions. Very enjoyable with a Belgian cheese plate sampler. Finish is slightly dry with a green apple aftertaste. Very versatile brew and nicely balanced."
"Lush deep brown (touch of red) color with a thick tan colored head. Aromas of dark malts, yeast, candi sugar and some complex esters. Sweet malt texture turning to a slightly sour taste in the finish and a dryness perhaps from some bittering hops. A little raisiny and thin, but overall, a good Belgian brown. I sampled this one from the 33 cl, hopefully the 75 cl one I have is even better."
"The head is medium-sized in my tulip glass. It's dense, stable, off-white and leaves lots of sticky, thick & sheety lacing. Beer is a clear, dark, red/brown with tons of carbonation. Smell is nutty, with fruit and some dark malt. Front is spicy with loads of fruit. The milky, sweet, lightish middle dies off with grains and alcohol. There's a very nice, bready aftertaste. This beer is very, very drinkable. Tasty, light, fresh, fruity, nutty. Yum."
"The flavor is fruity that lingers long into the aftertaste. The malt flavor reminds me of amber malt or biscuit malt. The body is a little thin maybe due to the higher alcohol. The drinkability is what I have to give the lowest. It just isn't there for me."
"Ah shit, all over my laptop. This is one fiesty beer, I left it puking its guts in the sink for a minute before I decided to just pour it in my chalice. That's better. So what do we have here? A Belgian that doesn't hold its head, oh man. Yeah its definitely brown, pretty dark brown and a little cloudy, but I don't think I would want a clear Belgian. I smell alcoholic raisins, mellowed by a light coffee aroma. It really feels like soft fleece on the tongue, not quite like a nitro stout, but damn close. The taste is hard to describe. There is definitely some alcohol in the aftertaste. Definitely a lot of malt, not much hops that I can detect. Maybe just a little bittering from some hops, not sure. I just can't put a finger on the taste, it's kind of like a brown ale,on steroids, strong and complex."
"I thought this beer was good, but it didnt blow me away like it did when I first had it. It might have been that the vintages were different or, more likely, that Ive just developed a more refined palate. Either way, I lowered a couple of the scores a little bit and actually raised the Smell by half a point. Its still overall a 4.0+ beer that I will definitely seek out and buy again."
"The beer poured a nice dark brown color with a medium head. The head did last through the drink. There was a slight yeast and sweet aroma, which translated into the flavor components. There seemed to be a hint of chocolate in the aftertaste. This sports an average thickeness, making this extremely drinkable."
"Pours with a five-fingered plus faint brown,thick head that fades slowly and leaves thick lace. Pour this one very slowly. Good carbonation. A deep red-brown color. Nose is malty/alcohol with raisins. Starts sweet and malty, finishes smooth and roasty."
"75cl corked bottle.This is one decent dubbel in my opinion. Dark, brown and cloudy with an enormous frothy head and fantastic retention. Aroma is fruity, spicy, sugary and malty. Has a great full body and goes down quite smooth with none of the 8% noticable at all. Flavor although not as complex as others, is a good malty raisiny sweet yummy brew."
"Dayton, Oh AleFest:This beer had a small sized tan head that consisted of mostly lasting fine sized bubbles.The body was cloudy with no carbonation observed.The hue of this beer was brown with a nose of malts and some hops.The flavor was acidic and bitter which had a lingering effect to it.The mouthfeel was very tingly, thin, watery and light bodied.There was good lacing with this beer."
"nice enough though..."
"This beer pours a dark brown with a nice sized, thick head (dies flat shortly after) and lots of lacing on the glass. The aroma is malty and sweet. Reminds me slightly of a wheat beer aroma. The flavor is a little sweet and spicy but very smooth. It is very malty in taste and it finished up with a wheat flavor. Pretty decent Belgian Brown."
"Nice dark brown color with a fluffy white head approx. 3"". Head calms down in a few minutes and lacing is consistent throughout the beer. Medium to dark brown with a creamy white head. Traces of light can be seen through the glass, but this is definitely darker than most brown ales I've had. The smell is exceedingly sweet and perfumey. Two of my favorite worlds collide here. Its a cross between an english brown ale and a belgian artisinal. With a nice sweetness that balances perfectly with a mild hoppy bitterness. Aftertaste is sweet. This one stands out for me. Its sweet, its bitter, its Belgian and its good : )."
"A thin mouthfeel, it slides down awful easy and is lightly warming. Well done for a Belgian brune but not a commanding presence."
" Much thanks to JohnnyDuvel for helping a BA brother out!"
"The Mouthfeel: The is a medium body beer."
"Pours a hazy amber brown, with a thin but persistent white head that leaves sheets of lace. Aroma is fruity and sweet, with burnt caramel, sour apples, and vanilla. Flavor begins with caramel and toffee, with some apple and vanilla... finishing somewhat metallic. It's on the thin side, and has prickly mouthfeel. This is not my favorite dubbel, but is a solid beer nonetheless."
"Oh Yeah! Pours a medium brown with a burnt orange tinge. An average head that fades rather quickly to a thin layer leaving a slight lace ring. Aromas of caramel, toffee, sweet malts. Tastes malty, honey and mollasses are there without being cloyingly sweet--very smooth. Very nice mouthfeel, medium carbonation. The glass was covered with lace by the time I finished. A great beer. While I'll skip the blond next time, I'll save up for this one."
"This was a nice suprise! I stopped at my favorite local ""packy", and saw this sitting on the shelf (for the first time). When I removed the wire top from the cork, it exploded! I've never had this happen before. The beer poured (and tasted) a little darker than I expected. The sugary sweetness that is present with so many Belgian beers is quite noticeable here, as is a prominent head and sticky, lasting lace. The taste reminded me a little of Westlverten 8 (only not quite as strong). I would rate this beer in the same category as Corsendonk and Maudite, along with Chimay Red. Very, very good, well worth trying if you like the Belgian style. I will absolutely buy this again. (The second time I tried it, the sweetness was more apparent. Still quite good, but I docked it a little for the sweetness)."
"A deep translucent garnet with hints of brown, the head massive in size, creamy in its texture and the lace fine sheets to cover the glass. The aroma of malted or lightly toasted grains reaches you first, then sweet nutlike tones, quite pleasant. Sweet at the front, lots of malt and the top middling in its mouth feel, finish is masterfully hopped, biting in its acidity and the aftertaste quite dry and long lasting. Well worth the sample, gift pack not with standing."
"Val-Dieu pours a beautiful chestnut brown with an off-white head that clings to the glass. This is the color brown ale should be! The aroma is very fruity with odors of apple, pear, and grapefruit. There is a faint aroma of hops. The taste starts with a warm rich malty sweetness and subtle carbonation. This is followed by apple and apricot flavors and subtle hints of hops with notes of citrus. The aftertaste is that fruity Belgian yeast flavor with sweet malt flavors lingering in your mouth. The mouthfeel is smooth and enjoyable. Alcohol and hops are noticeable but they take a back seat to the rich malt and fruity yeast flavors and aromas. I'm not a big Brown Ale fan but this beer could turn me into a convert. A Great example of a Brown Ale."
"The stiff, lively, bumpy off white head rises and escapes the glass, peaks then slowly settles. Intricate lace is left. Deep garnet in hue w/ a light haze. Notes of sweet, heavily caramelized sugar from both dark candi sugar and dark caramel melt in aroma, along w/ buttery chocolate. Fruitiness is typically enticing, consisting of ripe, dark dried fruit akin to prunes and raisins. Light green apple acetaldehyde provides tartness aromawise. Molasses like, caramelized sweetness upfront in flavor. Clove and mellow chocolate malt ensue. The ripe, dark fruitiness mirrors that of the aroma, but sugary, fructose laden dates is perceptible as well. The token hop bitterness lends an overall sweet, but not cloyingly sweet overall impression. Fairly clean esterwise, with only a hint of bubblegum towards the finish. Moderately bodied, w/ a smooth, firmly malty mouthfeel. Finishes mildly phenolic, w/ malt sweetness and hints of peppry alcohol briefly lingering on the palate. Val Dieu is quite a complex and delicious brew. It's quite clean outright in esters, but possesses an superb coupling of mellow dark fruit and chocolate malt."
"Sweet and big time yeasty smell (candi sugar?).  Very deep dark red color with a thick beige head.  Lots of carbonation.  Sweet complex taste with a nice bitter finish.  Quite dry.  Slight alcohol notes left on the tongue.  You can tell that this is fermented with an established pedigree yeast that commands respect from the drinker.  Medium body to the brew but very smooth.  Can you tell that I like it?"
"Notes: Flavourful, sturdy and complex. All about the malt and hops without too much else getting in the way other than the occasional phenolic aroma and flavour."
"Robust, and rich.  Darker than a typical brown ale, but creamy with a rocky head that sticks for the duration.  Good carbination.  Yeast definetely present, but not dominating.  Overall a wonderful beer, to be enjoyed on a cold winter night."
