Well built across the board with excellent interplay between bubblegum sweetness, spice, and bready malts.  What makes this beer stick out to me is the toasty, bready malt finish with the residual sweetness of cherries and chocolate.  It also helps that the beer is not too sweet like others in the style.  I made the mistake of serving this too cool at 50 degrees.  Serve just slightly chilled instead.","CowsandBeer","Mar 26, 2015"

This is a good beer, obviously, but it just doesn't have anything to balance out the sweet maltiness and that isn't my thing.","rjs246","Mar 26, 2015"

Spicy aroma of light stone fruit, dates, raisins, light nuts, cherry; the clove and earthy spices really dominate this more than other Rochefort ales. Flavor is sweet dates, figs, apricot with rapidly developing spiciness of clove and other earthy spices, finisihing with concentrated fruit, caramel and light hops. Really complex flavor. Nice creamy, medium heavy body. An exceptional Belgian ale and possibly the richest, most complex dubbel I've had. I wondered why I never had reviewed this, and it's possible that I always went for its bigger brothers, 8 and 10. If so, my loss. This is as flavorful and interesting as those ales. An exceptional dubbel from one of the best breweries in the world. A total pleasure to drink.","LiquidAmber","Jan 22, 2015"

Rochefort 6's aroma is reminiscent of black cherry, cognac, red wine, and plum. The flavor dances on one's palate with a splash of sweetness and a soft, bready foundation. Belgian yeast, nuts, and molasses all come through nicely. It feels relatively light as it coats the mouth, and the finish is satisfying. Overall, this is a top choice to serve to guests with hors d' oeuvres that have discerning tastes.","Neorebel","Jan 11, 2015"

Some thick layers of lacing is seen that slips back down the glass after the sip (this is a SIPPING brew and not a chugging type.) LOTS going on with the aroma and what I can pick out is spice, dark fruits, sweet malts, and bread. Pretty much the same for the taste with even more going on which I can't really figure out. Very tasty and actually gets better while warming up some. Smooth with a slight sweet finish. Medium+-bodied with perfect carbonation. A pricey brew BUT if you want a great quality brew for this style, then this is it. It's a '10' and is as good as it gets. PROSIT!","BeerWithMike","Nov 23, 2014"

OCCASION: great PSU weekend comes to a close...APPEARANCE: dark brownish red body that pours with a sizzle, then opaquely feigns daylight; off-white single-finger hand is bubbly with cream head... AROMA: plum, banana, some iron and blood rust; yeasts make the aroma slightly funky; rather faint for a Trappist... PALATE: surprisingly thin, but with as unsurprisingly long, warm aftertaste; creamy and extremely drinkable... TASTE: raisins mix with woody, smoky water notes; sugars mingle for sweetness; rather understated for a Trappist, again, but still chewable and rewarding slow sips...OVERALL: expectations were for something bigger; this eased off its intensity and actually proved elusive on its profile; good, but also worth its price if on sale....","dacrza1","Aug 11, 2014"

3.95,-4.6,3.75,3.75,4.25,3.75,3.75,"The lightest and ""smallest"" of the Rochefort beers, perhaps one of the best series of beers in the world. Poured from a red-capped bottle into a Chimay goblet ... Hey, according to Stan Hieronymus in ""Brew Like A Monk", Chimay did influence Rochefort's recipes and provide much needed technical support at a time when Rochefort needed important quality control. I won't make claims about who ultimately does a better job at the present time but I will say that the beers are decidedly different and leave it at that. Rochefort 6 is an interesting reddish brown color, not opaque and quite bubbly. Reminds one of autumn leaves when one is in a whimsical mood I suppose. Quite aggressive carbonation during the pour and this carries over onto the palate yet remains pleasant. Aroma is herbal and earthy in equal measure, only a little sweet, with a tinge of root cellar and yeasty funk. Body is quite thin and the beer comes across as smooth, ""digestible", and easy to drink, albeit with a complex and rather unique flavor that belies the notion that this should be chugged. Perfumed like some types of black tea, evokes little in the way of dried dark fruit but does deliver some earthy, herbal spice that recalls ginseng root, cassia bark, and perhaps a bitter cola, with a very mellow chocolate vibe (carob?) as the backbone along with some butterscotch and a subtle nutty character. Booze is detectable but far from overpowering. Not appreciably sweet but my brain does conjure up images of light powdered sugar. Unique! Dry, herbal, with an earthy spicy bitterness that one does not soon forget.","CalgaryFMC","Jan 13, 2014"

This is one of the best dubbels I've ever had–tons of character, subtle and complex, beautiful to look at and a joy to have slide over the tongue and down the hatch. The 6 puts together the classic components of Belgian Dark Ales–brown sugar and dark fruit flavors, creamy mouthfeel, and a complex yeasty spiciness–in a way that distinguishes it from others. My guess is the house yeast used by Rochefort. Bottom line: excellent beer. Don't die before having one.","hagbergl","Jun 10, 2013"

I’ve been getting more and more underwhelmed by a lot of the ones I’ve tried, and so I’ve become more interested in drinking a small rotation of beers that I’ve tried and loved. This beer right here has shown me something new and wonderful and has given me a new sense of purpose in going out and drinking as many different beers as I possibly can.

Pours dark brown with a very noisy, frothy light tan head that settles quickly without much lace. Smell is caramel malt, some citrus fruits, and a hint of wood. Taste is plums, followed by a dry woodiness. There is some citrus up front but when the wood hits....this just sounds wrong somehow...it dries out completely. The finish is dry and a touch sharp. IMHO it is a perfect example of what a dubbel tastes like. The mouthfeel is aggresively carbonated and seems a bit lighter than you'd expect from the taste or the look. Overall, its fantastic. It's only held back by the yeast strain constantly reminding me of the 10, which has the same flavor notes but more complexity.

I could/would/should drink this on a more regular basis.","stakem","Nov 06, 2012"

Light and fruity with lots of dark and brown sugars with some yeasty flavors. Medium body with an insane amount of carbonation and a sweet sugary and bubbly mouthfeel.

Light dark fruit tang on the finish; with lingering notes of dark fruit, toffee, molasses, biscuit, and earthy spiciness on the finish for a short bit. Very nice flavor balance and complexity; with plenty of robust flavors. Medium carbonation and body; with a nice creamy, slick, and slightly prickly mouthfeel.

4.19,1.2,3.5,4.5,4,4,4.5,"This is my first of the Rochefort series. This beer pours a nice mahogany reddish brown color with some nice carbonation streaming from the bottom. The head is off white, fluffy with big bubbles but recedes very quickly and leaves a few spots of bubbles on the top of the headless beer. Aroma is of nice caramelized figs, a bit of dark stone fruits and some nice raisin spicy like notes. Pretty complex and interesting. Perfect with my short ribs i prepared earlier. The taste is very similar to the aromas, a tad thin for me but very true to the style. The plum, fig and roasted caramel notes play nicely but its a touch thin for me so this feels a little fake. I also get a touch of grape, maybe some red wine like flavors. The mouthfeel is nicely carbonated, maybe a bit too over carbonated for me actually, but refreshing with each sip. The best part of this is that you can drink it slow and it will flatten out so it does get better. Overall this is a great beer. Nice addition of red meat dishes, grilled pork and even with some ice cream this would work. I would avoid fish, shellfish and poultry at all costs with this as its a strong flavored brew.","Augustiner719","Apr 22, 2012"

What I liked least about this beer was the price, if this was $3.50 I would buy it much more often. I would be this beer again, but only for special occasions because of the price, and I recommend this to anyone who is a fan of Belgian beer, and this may be a good beet to get someone into the style.

The head quickly dissipates and leaves a little bit of white head on the top. Bubbles can be seen meeting the head, indicating high carbonation. The aromas of caramel, fig, roasted malt, and Belgian yeast hit the nose. I can also detect a small amount of alcohol. The taste is sweet, but not too sweet. The flavors of caramel and fig go a long way towards covering up the alcohol content, but the faint taste of alcohol is there. The mouthfeel is medium with high carbonation and a dry finish. The carbonation prepares you for the next drink. This is very easy to drink. Overall, this is an outstanding beer.","acevenom","Mar 13, 2012"

Pleasantly yeasty and a lightly cardboard finish. A bit aggressive on that malted dark fruit, but it's pleasant in its way.

It had a nice amber color, almost red with an off-white head that had great retention and lace. The aroma is strongly of caramel and medium dark fruits (not so much plum and prune). On the tongue it is very malt forward but it doesn't finish anything close to being sweet, despite what the aroma lead me to think it would. It has a medium high carbonation, which helps the finish.

4.04,-2.4,3.5,4.5,4,3.5,4,"From notes 8/1/11. Pours a deep amber-brown with good clarity and a fizzy head. There are some floaties, but I could have avoided them with a better pour. The aroma is a mix of floral, brown sugar, bready malt, fruit - raisins, peaches, apricots, plums - and earth. There’s little that I can easily ascribe to hops. It smells kinda like a fresh hunk of cinnamon raisin bread topped and honeysuckle. The taste is also quite nice. Lots of sweetness that quickly blossoms into earthy complexity. The feel is a bit fizzy for my taste but not bad. This is a very good beer with plenty of Belgian yeast flavor.","popery","Aug 15, 2011"
4.17,0.7,4,4.5,4,4.5,4,"Just like with my previous Orval, it did not matter how gentle my pour, the head was forming at an incredible rate. It settled into a rocky finger of tawny head with good retention. Color was a deep coppery-amber with NE-quality clarity, thanks in part to my pour. Nose was VERY malty - toffee, caramel, fresh baked bread, dried dark fruits and even a light must. Mouthfeel was silky, gliding over my tongue on its way to my throat, but I held it in my mouth to swirl it around. As a self-avowed hophead, the sugary sweetness of the malt really hit me. Wow! The finish had a bit of heat to it and I had to sit back and collect myself before taking a second sip. Double yoi! Now, the heat and sweetness gave way to a melange of flavors, including the aforementioned caramel/toffee and raisin bread. Wild. I just worry that I am not the intended audience for this style of beer, but I hope that it suffices to say that I did enjoy it, all in all.","woodychandler","Aug 15, 2011"

Forget about 8 and 10. 6 holds its own against the best BSDAs in the world. I avoided buying it for the longest time because I thought it'd be too much like a Dubbel (a style that I am routinely underwhelmed by). As it turns out this is like a super-Dubbel. It has the narrow scope of a Dubbel but simultaneously achieving a complexity matched by few Dubbbels. This would be a perfect pairing with rabbit and a mushroom risotto. It would likely perform marvelously at the Thanksgiving table. Don't make the mistake that I did in avoiding this beer for so long.","Reaper16","Aug 03, 2011"

Smokey cloudy vapor just swirls around the top of the bottle. Crazy cool. Slowly poured into Brooklyn tulip glass. Pours a murky brown color, very little head, but visible small bubbles come up the side of the glass. Smell- dark fruit, raisins, prunes, some alcohol detectable, brown sugar, winter spices. A lot going on here. Taste- SUPER rich carbonation, definite raisin presence, dark fruits. The taste is not as complex as the aroma, but I guess I didn't expect this to be as rich and flavorful as the 10. The carbonation is crazy- its almost too much, making it almost acidic from the sharpness of the bubbles. It's a little bit of a knock of this one.

But it is a higher than normal price, though lower than you would expect, so that's only a small part. It's not too heavy, it's too rich. This is an alternative to wine with cheese and crackers, or a nice way to finish off a good meal. You can definitely put several of the away in one sitting, but not at a BBQ or a big party. It's a sipper, not a chugger. You won't struggle to finish it by any means, but. . . Think of it like eggs Benedict vs a breakfast sandwich. They both have an English muffin, two eggs and ham. But add hollandaise sauce and it become very rich, and you are contented with the initial serving. An egg sandwich not so much, you need the hash brown and maybe some fruit to be contented. This is eggs Benedict, and something like a Guinness would be a egg sandwich, and a Budweiser would be an egg McMuffin.

This murky, funky brew doesn't have the biggest nose of any Belgian, it's not the strongest, the flavor is somewhat mild...but it's perfect, the black sediment on the bottom of the snifter and the way the brown bubbles caress my tongue tell me everything I need to know...even though Russian Imperials Stouts are my favorite moreso than any Belgian, this is my absolute favorite beer, even over some of the wild lambics or my tops RIS.

Has a three-finger fizzy off-white head that subsides to one finger and maintains a dusting of brown sediment on top throughout. Lacing is minimal throughout. The aroma was comprised of malt, fruit, spices, and alcohol notes. The flavor was of fruit and malt that is very subtle; alcohol hits you upon swallowing, but is not overpowering. It is medium on the palate with high carbonation. Overall, this was a very nice brew that was very easy to drink. However I don't think I could drink a large quantity in one sitting.

Heavy, sticky lacing is left as the beer recedes. The aroma is interesting. Nothing like what I would have expected from a BSDA. Over ripe apples, vanilla, pepper and other spices. Caramel and toffee. Just a little bit of yeasty bread. Almost reminds me more of a Tripel minus the Belgian candy sugar. The flavor isn't as intense as the nose. Sweet toffee comes through right off the bat followed closely by vanilla bean, and toasted grains. Sweet bruised fruits like apple and pears with just a hint of alcohol burn at the very tail of the flavor profile. The mouthfeel is light and crisply carbonated.

I can see hues of pink, orange, brown--it's like the colors of an intense sunset all mixed together. It resembles slightly watered down sherry. It has thin off-white bubbles the disappeared as I was trying to describe them. There isn't much lacing or coating if I swirl the beer around. I pick up aromas of plum, powdered sugar, and maybe oak or another wood when I inhale. There are flavors of plum, raisin and some sweet malts. There is a bit of alcohol in the finish, but not as much as you often get with this style. It's very complex. I want to describe the taste as a bit soapy, but I'm not sure if that truly conveys what it tastes like; nevertheless, what I call soapy is a good thing. It has a lighter medium body and just the right amount of carbonation. There isn't much mouth coating. It's a bit watery for me, but only ever so slightly. The 6 is very drinkable. It goes down so easily! It's great as an individual glass, but also would be wonderful over many rounds. It doesn't feel like a 7.5% ABV beverage at all.

It smelled like earthy caramel and bready yeast, with some lemon hops and salt and alcohol. It tasted like rich milk chocolate and nutty malt, with sweet creamy yeast and a bit of lemon and lingering caramel. It was watery with tons of carbonation and a sweet aftertaste. Overall this wasn't highly complex like some Trappist ales can be, but it had a great clean and delicate flavor. It was surprisingly malty without much of the traditional sour wild yeast taste. It also hid the alcohol very well, making this all too easy to drink. My only complaint is that it was a bit too carbonated for my liking, probably due to all the yeast sediment. But the fizziness smoothed out about half way through the glass. I didn't expect too much from this beer, since it's the ""lowest"" of the Rocheforts, but I was very pleasantly surprised.

As it warms rich dark fruit sweetness comes out to complement the liquid bread tones I was initially getting. Flavor is much creamier than the smell let's on. Tame sweetness with fresh bread dough and powdered yeast, mild hints of raisin form as well. Spice and herbal mint features flourish here as well, coriander and a touch of anise among the vast array of foreign flavors.

It is fragrant, with bits of bready yeast, chocolate covered cherry filling, and possibly a bit of tropical fruit. I was disappointed in the taste of this beer. It was not bad but it also did not live up to its nationality or its abv. There is very little alchohol taste or smell to speak of.

The aroma is delicious with pastry dough, sugar, glazed donut and some kind of near-eastern sugary treat I cannot identify. The flavor is a repeat of the aroma (although to a lesser degree) but adds a dusty coating of spiciness not unlike anise or fennel seed. I also sense the flavor and aroma of 25 cent gumballs from the machine in the hardware store of my childhood. As it warms I smell flowers and saturday mornings in May. Soft medium body with a smooth yet mouth-filling carbonation. These flavors and aromas are miles ahead in complexity and depth from most of the other Belgian offerings in this category. I prefer this over the Rochefort 10 for its added layers and nuances beyond the mere weight of added boozy dark fruit/ yeast depth.

Sweet, spicy, malty with coriander, anise, soap, and fruity caramel bleeding out of the glass. The flavor is full, rich, dynamic, and strong. This is great. There is a citrusy and floral aspect underneath a well balanced malt base. There is a faint cherry taste from the alcohol and the end has a piny touch of hops. Just enough to make it bittersweet before the next malty start. Slightly cidery from the blend of sweet, tart, fruity, malty, and rich.

The haze began to clear as it came up to cellar temperature. I watched the foam dissipate quickly, leaving a ring and some flat islands on the surface. The aroma of chocolate covered, candied orange peel, popped into my head as if i had walked into a Brussels chocolate shop. It reminded me also of Sabra liqueur, for those familiar.

The presentation was grand, with a three-finger head blanketing a rich ruby red body. It emitted wonderful aroma and accosted the taste buds with berry, a bit of caramel smoothness, raspberry, citrus, spices such as cinnamon and to me a good deal of grape. It was quite sweet like an easy red wine, but far more mysterious and detailed. There is lots of chocolate, but also a prominent black licorice taste that makes me suspect the addition of anise. This would be so easy to quaff, but for the price and the panoply of tastes demanding slower, detailed attention. Though expensive, 6 and 8 were more than worth the try, and were among the very best I've ever had.

On the palate, light and fresh flavors for a beer this rich. Very soft sweetness, like malted chocolate, and a pronounced nutty yeast flavor. High, sustained notes of fruitiness throughout the palate, but especially notable at the end.

It pours into the tulip an orange/garnet, hugely active, with a 3-finger, off-white, fluffy head that becomes more dense as it settles, and leaves nice sheets of lace. There are notes of rum bread, plums, anise, and green hops in the nose, with hints of vanilla, apples, chocolate, blue/blackberries, and sweet cherries - quite pleasant. It is harsh and overly-carbonated on the first sip, so I let it warm for a bit before resuming. When I do, I find rum bread, cinnamon, anise, maybe some other spices, yeast, and green hops that impart a mild bitterness. After the initial carbonation subsides, I find a medium, drying body, and a short finish that slowly lengthens. Overall it was a bit too harsh, and, although it has nice accents, I feel that it needed more sweet malts to give them some ballast. A fairly good Belgian, but for a Trappist, this was kind-of a let down. Maybe I didn't get the best bottle, or maybe it's just not up my alley, but I'm sure I'll meet this beer again sometime, perhaps if only for its namesake.","mmmbeer","Feb 19, 2007"

Taste had loads of fruits such as figs and grapes, with a bit of caramel sweetness. Mouthfeel was light to medium, and oh so smooth on the palate. This was easily the most drinkable of the three offerings from Rochefort. Kudos to the brothers for suggesting pairing it with some soft cheeses.

4.01,-3.1,4.5,3.5,4,4,4.5,"Number 6, red cap. I was curious to see how it would match up against its bigger brothers. Rochefort 6 definitely pours out with the lightest colour of the 3, as expected. Nice hazy iced-tea or dark peach-juice colour with a cream-white head that settled nicely and moved slowly leaving some viscous lace. Very nice looking beer. The aroma is very earthy and tea-like, with less phenols and even a little hopping beginning to show through(something I could not detect at all in the 8 and 10.) Very similar malt aromas as the 8 and 10, and even some light metallic citrus aromas come out. Other notes of pasta, yeast, dusty chocolate, and salt. Light nuttiness, fresh white bread, grapes and green vegetables. Just as complex as the 8, in my opinion. The first taste has sourish malts and in the middle is metallic phenols, where the alcohol can be tasted. The finish is the best part of the taste, where grainy bread mixes with the softest hint of hops and coffee to form a pleasant and lingering aftertaste. Light caramel and a certain dusty yeasty flavour which I find in Gouden Carolus Classic. The taste reveals more port-like alcohol as you exhale, but obviously not as much as the other Rocheforts. As with all of the Rochefort beers, this warms the stomach nicely. The 6 has all the drinkability, with the least harsh alcohol feel out of the 3. Since the 3 beers are all the same recipe, they DO share many characteristics save the bite of alcohol content. That being said, the 6 really does taste the most uncomplex, with the beer's flavour at its basic. However, it allows some tastes to shine through, such as the light hopping and the graininess of the malt. Still a lovely tasting brew. Medium carbonation, medium body, and full drinkability.","Cwrw","Apr 11, 2006"

The taste didn't quite live up to the smell, with basically the same flavors, just not as strong.

Sweet and toasted sensations wash over your tongue at first. Nice finish with very, very weak and subtle hops trying to show themselves. This is very close to being my perfect brew. Nice low level of carbonation, plenty of flavour, lots of malt, nearly void of hops. It has a great colour and at 7,5%abv it isn't so big you can't handle a couple of them.

The nose was slight molasses and raisiney sweet with a bit of spiceyness playing around in there as well. The flavor was light raisiney and sweet brown sugar. It just seemed a little thin to me on the flavor. I expected something more robust on the tongue. The feel was a thin moderate with a very active carbonation, almost burning and too much on the tongue. Overall, a pretty good brew. The carbonation really detracted from the beer in my opinion.

Lacing is luxurious and absolutely gorgeous. Rich aromas of roasted malts and candi sugars, musty and dusty yeast, light caramel, cocoa/vanilla and a slight nuttiness with nuances of toasted marshmallow. Not only is the aroma excellent, the taste and flavor is equalled to it. This probably has to be one of the most drinkable beers I've ever had. Malty but not very sweet, subtle flaked maize or oat taste, fruitiness is bursting with juicy goodness. Light hop accents with virtually no astringency, just a little dryness.

Laces in large downward dripping marks. Yeasty aroma, trademark fresh detergent notes (its hard to say why this is a good thing here, but it is) with pear sweetness and some cinnamon. Thickish mouthfeel, but well set off by staunchly spritely carbonation. Flavor is fairly big, leafy with lots of cantelope brightness mixed with a dark rum counterpoint. Prickly sense mid mouth to close, hoppy with pine cones, pepper, and star anise licorice. Relatively hot at the back of the throat and warming in the swallow.

Bread, malts, yeast, nuts, fruit, cocoa, and at the end some spicy hops finish it off. Moutfeel feels so light and fluffy on the palate it's down right amazing.

Firm medium body with moderate carbonation. Fortunately no acidity nor alcoholic feel. Light hoppy bitter slice toward the end, gets a bit astringent after half the bottle.

Aroma has notes of dark fruits and spice but the aroma never approached overpowering. Taste was also a nice mild flavor with loads of dark fruits and some spicy yeastiness. A nice sweet/creamy finish also makes itself known. Mouthfeel is nice and creamy as well. I could drink this all night... If it weren't 7.5 percent that is.

Alcohol profile hidden unlike its bigger brothers. Mouthfeel is very enjoyable- not real heavy on a hot day. Drinkability is high. I really like this compared to the 8 and the 10, because it has many of the same aroma and flavor profiles, but isn't as overpowering.

There is smooth warming malt, sweet pear, cinnamon and honey, and plum. There is a citric hop tingle in the finish, very subtle though. Finishes crisp, a bit tannic, perhaps a little chalky.

It is lightly hazy and is topped by a creamy off white head. Quite a fruity aroma with notes of plum, raisin and rum. The fruitiness caries through to the taste, with hints of apricot and in the finish a bit of banana. This beer seems to be sweet, but is in actuality fairly dry. The general fruitiness helps to build up the perception of sweetness. No alcohol is evident, this one hides it well. Quite a smooth beer, well put together, the flavors come together to form a balanced whole. There is a low level of Belgian spiciness here (esters, higher alcohols, etc.) that melds very well with the fruity notes. I must say I really like this beer.

Tasty palate, dry coffee, semi-sweet chocolate upfront with pepper in the middle, quickly followed by the bready maltiness, kisses of fruity-alcohol, candy sugar the finish on the bier is magical.

The aroma is initially an evened melange of lightly sugary plum, mellow carob and dark candi sugar caramel notes. As the beer breathes, clove phenol and hints of peppery alcohol surface. Understated and welcoming aromawise. Ashen, nut studded banana bread sweetness incipient in flavor lingers, then after a deliberation is complemented by a stately dark fruit presence of a plum and woody, dried date nature. Tepid notes of black licorice and salty biscuit arise late and lend an unexpected, but welcome savory contrast. Lightly bodied and quite lean overall, with a dryish, fluid mouthfeel indicative of ample usage of candi sugar. Quite well attenuated. Finishes with a brief surge of herbal phenol yielding to lingering notes of dry, powered, unsweetened cocoa. Rochefort 6 is an exceptionally balanced, soft beer that awakens and sits lightly on the palate. Its inherent tameness works well...

The dark red brown body was well carbonated but produced very little head. The taste was of dark fruits, chocolate, and toffee with a nice dry bitterness.

Very smoothly-blended and gentle, with a creamy body and a finish which is just barely sweet. What drying effect there is seems to come more from the alcohol than the hops, which are fairly mild. A really, really nice beer!","mzwolinski","Mar 26, 2003"

4,-3.4,4,4,4,4,4,"Small 330 ml bottle pours a murky brown color with a huge frothy and creamy off-white head that lasts, light malt and somewhat spicy aroma. Very mild fruity and bready flavor, medium body with very lively carbonation nice clean finish a bit watery palate, very smooth and drinkable alcohol is well hiddin. Lighter than the 8 and 10, still a great brew.","maxpower","Feb 02, 2003"
4,-3.4,4,4,4,4,4,"The beer pours a bit of a hazy purple to dark red color with the head pertinent in size, frothy in texture and the lace fine long lasting sheets. Vinous lots of malt, fruit sweet, quite pleasant to sniff with the start ambrosial and the top skinny in feel. Finish is astringent, pleasantly hopped and a nice dry lingering aftertaste. A good beer, not as good as the 8/10, but still a top notch beer nonetheless.","Gusler","Jan 05, 2003"

3.83,-7.5,4.5,4,3.5,4,4,"This beer poured a dark amber and formed a huge sudsy-foamy off white head that circular lace. Heavy amount of carbonation. An aroma of malt, caramel and spice. A flavor of of malt and spice with some sudsy aspect to the mouthfeel no doubt due to the carbonation. I found the flavor to be a a touch weak compared to others of this style.","Wildman","Nov 26, 2002"
3.97,-4.1,3.5,4,4,4,4,"Pretty good, but the 8 and 10 are way better, this was a bit sweet, and lacked a bit of character, this however, was very good, i'm only really comparing it to the 8 and the 10. Nice spicy chocolate flavour, but not as aromatic or as tasty as the other two.","rastaman","Jul 11, 2002"
