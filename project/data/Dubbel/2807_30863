4,1.5,,,,,,"Hazy ruby-accented dark russet brown body beneath a frothy head of light tan. A bit of zesty carbonation is common for the style so that makes sense, and the quick rising bubbles help to bolster the head, giving it great head retention. The aroma displays dark skinned fruits and spiciness with a little bit of brown sugar and caramel thrown in to round it out, and the flavor follows suit, simply adding a touch of grassy (and perhaps spicy...?) hops to the background. The fermentation seems clean, other than producing the brilliant dark fruitiness and (some) spice; and it's well-balanced by a moderate to median bitterness (it's kind of hard to tell with the carbonic bite of the CO2). Not a lot of brewers are producing this style of beer right now, and certainly not to this quality. This is also a very fresh bottle, and I think that a few months of aging might soften it and open it up a bit to reveal a greater depth of maltiness. Impressive. I'm going to have to seek out more offerings from this brewery.","NeroFiddled","Jul 30, 2014"

Aroma was very fruity, a bit like a fig or plum, maybe a hint of grapes, small note of pepper. Taste was slighty malty, then shifted to a bit of sugary sweet with some fruit notes as well.

Thick, aggressive head (foamed out of the bottle), leaving light lacing; lasts a long time. Sweet caramel malt and very spicy aroma. Taste is sweet malts, raisins, dark fruit, brown sugar, cloves, cinnamon, complex. Middle and finish are lighter versions of the start, almost seems a slight let down that there is not a burst of flavor at the end. Still a complex, but subtle flavoring. Quite different.

A very thick flavor, I was not expecting it to be this big. Lots of raisins, figs, plums, and a touch of apricot playing around in there letting you know the yeast was doing its thing.

3.4,-13.7,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,"I had to let this one settle in the glass and warm up to see where they were going with the style. It is really a spiced belgian dubbel that almost tastes like Xmas ale ( think Unibroue 17). Not the most complex beer it also suffers from a little too much sweetness ( cellaring may be a good idea). The beer benefits from the spices as without it would be an average Belgian style ale. I found it a beer that one glass would suffice due to the spice and the sweetness","canucklehead","Aug 26, 2009"
3.53,-10.4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Interesting how Quebec leads the way in Canada in terms of making some gutsy brews. This one falls short of the Belgians, but compared to what Big Rock has dared and tried lately...","Shadman","Aug 13, 2009"

3.56,-9.6,4.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Overall an okay dubbel but if I had to nitpick I'd say it's a little too high on the ABV and a little overly phenolic for my tastes.","MeisterBurger","Mar 03, 2009"
3.88,-1.5,4,3.5,4,4,4,"A well-rendered double, deftly balanced, the alcohol certainly obfuscated. I would cite this as a purely easy-drinking version of the style - eventual booze and ingress challenges aside, of course.","biboergosum","Jan 29, 2009"

3.8,-3.6,4,4,4,3,3.5,"Pours a hazy reddish orange, some light brown hues, medium sized but thick light tan head, settles to a medium layer and thick ring, few lace spots but great retention. Smell is sweet and malty, yeast, brown sugar, cherries and dark fruit, raisins, spice, gingerbread, a lot of raw sweetness but not too over the top. Taste is very sweet and malty, lots of fruit, strawberries and melon, cherries, gingerbread, spices, brown sugar, honey, yeasty, orange peel, wheat, pretty interesting, nice finish. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium to high carbonation, some warmth, little bit of peppery heat going down, some alcohol. A little warm and a bit thick for a dubbel, but not too bad.","Viggo","Mar 24, 2008"
4,1.5,4,4,4,4,4,"500 ml bottle courtesy of glouglouburp. Appearance- dark ruby red, good clarity. Huge head, four fingers at least. Minimal lacing, just a soapy head patty in the middle of the glass. Nose- really spicy, licorice. Taste- big spice presence, various spices (clove,cinamon anise), dark and citrus fruits, light roast and sweet finish. Very complex. Mouthfeel- medium, low carbonation. Drinkability is good.","oakbluff","Nov 18, 2007"

4,1.5,4,4,4,4,4,"Derek's bottle. I have enjoyed every member of the Vobiscum lineup, the Priest Made Me Do It! representation of the brewery's offerings. Dark brown and an off-brown slightly bubbly head, with coco aroma. Rich malting, creamy mouthfeel. On the sweet side, making very drinkable the Chai spices.","Sammy","Mar 24, 2007"
3.93,-0.3,4.5,4,4,4,3.5,"A very impressive and beautiful dubbel. A bit exhausting, knocks its drinkability down a notch, certainly not a session beer, but a very nice effort. Charlevoix is certainly producing some great Belgians. Worth a trip to Quebec and the brewpub in Baie-Saint-Paul has some really good food, too.","kenito799","Mar 07, 2007"

3.96,0.5,5,4,4,3,4,"Bottle: Poured a deep burgundy brown color ale with a big foamy head with great retention and lacing. Aroma of anis is totally dominating but still well back by some strong malt. Taste is dominating by anis with some candi sugar. I thought the anis was a bit overwhelming and could have been more balance. Body was above average and alcohol was well hidden. Nicely done overall but a better calibration of spices would bring this to world class level.","Phyl21ca","Jun 03, 2006"
4.15,5.3,4,4,4,4.5,4.5,"Her taste is quite smooth and well balanced. At first the fruity and spicy flavors come out with notes of shy chocolate and cocoa. The malt comes in in an earthy warm flavors that ends it all","3Vandoo","Beers"
