Nose is very much like cheap apple juice, though that settles and it is more candy like. Flavor is a bit too sweet for me, though it isn't so far out there that it's completely ridiculous. There is a dough tone to it that comes in as an accent. Belgian ales are hard to pull off. This one is okay. A bit out there.

3.7,-0.8,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"O: Drinks more like a Belgian strong dark ale (which I love, anyway). Great with Pringles Sour Cream and Onion chips dipped in Sour Cream and Onion dip. What a taste sensation.","brewskifan55","Beers"
3.03,-18.8,3.5,3,3,3,3,"I was gonna kick things off with a parody of Spinal Tap's ""Big Bottoms", with ""Bisons"" tossed in for comedic effect, but I thought better of it (plus, it's grammatically awful). Lucky you. Anyway, this stuff pours a clear russet-amber topped by a finger of glowing cream-white foam. The nose comprises bread, red apple skin, mild honey, light maple syrup, and a tiny modicum of fig. The taste brings in more of the same, with the red apple and fig really popping now, and some semblance of brown sugar and clove finally coming through, the only hint of any Belgian yeast character we're gonna get here. Too little, too late, I'm afraid. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a fluid feel. Overall, this is a limp excuse for a dubbel. It's not bad a Belgian-inspired brown ale (I use the word ""inspired", 'cause there's hardly any real Belgian character to it) or something of the sort, but it just barely passes for a shadow of the target style.","TMoney2591","0"
4.32,15.8,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Poured into a goblet. Pours translucent toffee brown with a finger-length off-white head. The carbonation appears to be immense with lots of tiny bubbles visible from the sides of the glass. The head recedes, but a little remains on top to form a nice cap over the beer. The lacing seems to stick to the sides of the glass. The aroma has some breadiness from the malts with some toffee sweetness rising to the nose. There's a little bit of a dark fruit aroma that is typical of the style. The dark fruits that come to mind are raisin and prune. The expected dubbel flavor notes are there. The strong bready malt backbone is accompanied by some nice toffee sweetness and dark fruit flavor. I get notes of prune and raisin that I picked up in the nose. There's some hop bitterness on the back end to help balance this beer's flavor. The alcohol is pretty well-hidden in the taste. The body is medium to full with strong carbonation. The beer finishes very dry. This is an excellent beer.","acevenom","Oct 29, 2012"

I initially had two fingers of tawny head, but it fell pretty quickly, leaving sticky lacing in its wake. Color was a bright copper, like a new penny or one of my ex's hair, with NE-quality clarity. I really leaned in for the nose and it smelled like Christmas fruitcake! Talk about truth in advertising - not only did I fully get the raisin and plum, but the bready malt and the yeast pulled together to make liquid bread in a way that I have not experienced in some time. Mouthfeel was dense and full and the dark fruit flavors were lovely in the mouth. I really wish that I could get some more of this one for the upcoming holiday season! Finish was semi-sweet, fruity, but not cloying. I have to admit that I was very pleasantly surprised by this one and highly recommend it to others.","woodychandler","Oct 18, 2012"

3.21,-13.9,3,2,3.5,3.5,4,"D - The box it came in didn't state what kind of beer it was. Most breweries that have ""big"" in the title, usually refer to it's flavor. This one, being a dubbel, fell a little short. Not to say I don't like dubbels, but I have to try one that really truly delivers. This one was good but I think it was a little over priced; $12 at AFEES. ","dotsonjamesg","Nov 12, 2010"
3.66,-1.9,4,3,3.5,4,4.5,"Drinkability: If the price is right, and it was for me, then this beer would be a great companion on a snowy night. I drank mine while watching my favorite football team. Its not too heavy, but also not too light, rather it settles in a perfect balance. Could easily drink four or five without feeling full.","Rhettbuck","Oct 16, 2010"
4,7.2,4,4,4,4,4,"D= A very interesting beer that I would drink more of if I had it. I stand behind my assessment that this ""Belgian dubbel"" is very reminiscent of a Scottish/Scotch ale. It has me wondering if they fermented it with a Scottish strain of yeast instead of a Belgian strain. Either way its tasty and malty and easy to drink despite the higher ABV.","spointon","Aug 27, 2010"

4.02,7.8,4,4.5,4,3,4,"Overall, not a bad beer, though it does stray from traditional belgian dubbels in a few aspects: not as sweet or yeasty as the classic belgian examples, a little hoppy for the style, and its too light. Although it does miss on these points its still a beer worthy of my fridge-space and my pallate.","OlRasputin989","Jun 06, 2010"
3.54,-5.1,5,3.5,3,4,4,"Who would have thought a Belgian would come from a craft brewery in Missouri? 12 ounce bottle. I really like the label on this one. Nicely done. Pours a rich mahogany with little to no head. Great color. Aroma is of raisin and fig. The beer presents itself in a straightforward manner. Roasted barley up front, mild sweetness in the middle, and light bitterness at the end. Some heat in the finish due to the high alcohol content. Some spiciness abounds throughout. Cinnamon, Allspice, Nutmeg, etc. Honestly it feels like it could benefit from an infusion of amped-up Belgian yeast - it's usually one of the first things I taste that makes a Belgian a Belgian, and it's just not here, at least not a strong enough presence. Don't get me wrong - it tastes good but it lacks the complexity I like in beers of this style.","eclaycamp","May 10, 2010"

3.7,-0.8,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4.5,"Pretty balanced dubbel, but the palate was missing a little carbonation and a longer lasting malt bill. All in all pretty good.","scruffwhor","Mar 25, 2010"
2.82,-24.4,3,3.5,2.5,3,2.5,"I'm glad I only bought one of these as I won't be going back for more, although like I said at the top, I have no way of knowing if this was a fresh bottle.","matjack85","Mar 25, 2010"
3.65,-2.1,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,4,"This is their better beer. Pours, unfortunately, a filtered brown color. The aroma implies sweet raisin, spice, and caramel. The taste reveals a pleasant sweet caramel maltiness with a cinnamon and nutmeg spice note. While I would consider this a lackluster example of a Dubbel, it's still a good beer.","brownbeer","Mar 18, 2010"

2.97,-20.4,3,3.5,3,2.5,2.5,"Poured with a decent foamy frothy tan head and a tiny bit of lace. Head mostly died down quick. Color is a nice clear amber red. Aroma is malt, circus peanuts, dates, spice, and funk. Flavor is about the same with a sweet bitter finish. Body is on the thin side with ok carbonation. Wouldn't go out of my way for this. Can see what they're trying to do, but didn't quite get it.","drpimento","0"
3.8,1.9,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,"This beer did not quite meet my definition of a belgian dubbel, but it does not have any significant faults, has an enjoyable flavor profile and has a sneaky alcohol heft. I feel like I have downgraded it based on the style, but overall a nice job from a brewery I have not heard of!","sweethome","Feb 20, 2010"

4,7.2,4,4,4,4,4,"Smells like dried fruit and cinnamon. Tastes similar, some vaguely Belgian yeast. A little light on the aftertaste, sort of smokey with stewed fruit. Body is fairly light, dry and spicy in the finish. It's not exactly Belgian style-wise, but a good beer nonetheless.","emerge077","May 11, 2009"
4.24,13.7,3.5,4.5,4.5,3.5,4,"Pours a clear, amber/copper. 1/4 inch head of an off-white color. Good retention and slight lacing. Smells of sweet malt, yeast, slight dark citrus, toffee, slight earthiness, and slight caramel. Fits the style of a Dubbel. Mouth feel is smooth and crisp with an average carbonation level. Tastes of strong yeast, strong sweet malts, slight earthy malt, slight caramel, toffee, and hint of hops in the finish. Overall, good blend, body, complexity, and aroma.","Tone","Beers"
