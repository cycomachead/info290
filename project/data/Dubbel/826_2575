My only gripe is that the flavor and residual malt character almost had a bit of piercing sweetness that stung the back of the throat. Having dried this out just a little bit would have helped to increase the overall enjoyable and drink-ability. As-is I almost feel guilty like I should go take a shot of insulin to counteract the sweetness of this brew.","stakem","Nov 06, 2012"

Taste of raisin, prune, toffee, toast, bread, molasses, chocolate, herbal, earth, clove, and yeast spices. Lingering notes of dark fruit, molasses, caramel, toffee, toast, biscuit, nuttiness, earth, and clove on the finish for a good bit. Nice balance and complexity of flavors; no cloying sweetness at all on the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full body; with a fairly creamy and slick mouthfeel that is very nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming noticed well after the finish. Overall this is a highly excellent Dubbel! Great flavor complexity and balance; and very smooth to sip on.

On the nose, I get some malt and coffee. On the next sniff, I get some chocolate on it and a hint of smoke. This is one of the more complex noses that I’ve had on a beer. On first sip, there’s a decent amount of sweetness to this brew with a very subtle hint of bitterness. I get dates, some coffee notes and chocolate. I also get a bit of brown sugar. There is a lot going on with this beer. The alcohol, despite being pretty high for 8%, is completely hidden. There is also moderate carbonation on this brew. I also thought that this was going to a heavy beer due to the color, but this is a lot lighter than I thought it would be. The finish on the brew is mildly bitter and lingers.

Methinks oxidation has gotten to this, but it's not in the usual way, so that's questionable at this point. Still, it ain't half bad.

Floaties are abound and in full force. Thick laces paste themselves to the glass throughout the drink. A very attractive beer. Nose is subtle, nothing over powering here but definitely dark roasted malts and some dark fruit make their presence known. Taste is very smooth, alcohol is well hidden and hops are hiding in the background until the finish. Medium bodied, note nearly as thick on the palate as I expected. Was very surprised that the beer was as smooth and mellow as it was . .. looks had me thinking it was going to be strong and warming and this beer tasted more like something I could session; dangerous given the ABV here.

Nose is a cross of old grape skins and cherries with a syrup edge. Flavor is pretty interesting. Starts off tangy and almost bitter in a way. Constant sweet tone with a doughy edge to it towards the tail end. With all the sediment in there, the subtle changes are less noticeable and it tends to stay an even, slightly caramel brew.

There is a bit of spice in there and some breadiness. The flavor is sweet and malty with that same bit of spice, but it is a bit think and lacks the intensity that I'd like. The spice seems to take over as the beer warms up. The body is also not quite where it should be. It is fairly light for a dubbel.

Dark malts and very subtle sweetness in addition to a slight breadiness was detected as it moves into a grassy yeasty taste on the finish which is reminiscent of the initial smell; the finish was also very slightly bitter. I did not think I detected much of fruits in the taste but in the after taste I believe I pick up plums and grapes with some breadiness; a little fruity aroma on the nose as well. Beer was of a moderage body with a sufficiently high carbonation level; it was smooth but instead of creamy smooth which was what it looked to be; it was more of the watery smooth. It was a relatively refreshing compared to many of the belgian brunes as well. On the whole, I find that this beer was more like a blond than a brune though every inch of it looks like a brune. Quite interesting though I would have preferred it more like a brune.","basica","Sep 12, 2007"

Brew was poured into a Duval glass and had a nice reddish brown color with a thick tan head that had great retention, actually had a head the entire time, and left sheets of lace down the side if the glass. Aromas of toasted and roasted malts/grains are noticeable right away but also tend to have a sweet smell while also picking up some darker scents almost like fresh ground coffee. This is a fantastic aromatic brew. The taste is very inviting, very smooth with a sweet taste upfront that seems to have some brown sugar properties. The malts really seem to give it a good roasted flavor that tends to be quite robust giving it a darker feel. At the end, hops are slightly noticeable and give it great balance. This is a fantastic brew and I really wish I would have tried it a long time ago. This one is a keeper.","Stimack","Mar 10, 2007"

Malt is lighter in the flavor than the nose, but pleasantly bready; tart fruity notes amount, apricot and peach like to my tongue; bitterness is on the low side but a light acidity balances the sweetness in the finish.

Small bits of yeast float happily in the brew, but there really isnt any cloudiness. The aroma is intense and multi-dimensional: lots of fruit and yeast, spicy phenols and a little sugar, caramel and fresh dark bread. The smell has a bit of alcohol in the mix as well.

Aromas are spicy and smell richly of fruits: banana, grapes, pears. Theres a soft sweetness in the nose that reminds me of fruit-filled pastries. Slight alcohol plays well with all that I'm smelling. I don't get nearly as much yeasty spice from the taste as I did with the aromas, which is good. I'm not too fond of overly phenolic dubbels. Tastes very much like that pastry scent I got earlier. Like fruit-filled sweetbread. Also tastes strongly of grapes; not so much vinous as of the unfermented juice. The alcohol is present enough to offer some sort of balance to the sweet, as I really don't pick up anything in the way of hops. The mouthfeel, as the visual lack of carbonation would suggest, is very mellow but seems kind of light.

Taste is pretty good ... brown sugar, caramel, rose petals, and sugar mixed with spices. Good but not one you'll search for when looking for a good belgian. Mouthfeel is again, servicable.

2.89,-28.1,4,2.5,3,2.5,3,"Bottle purchased from Beermania in Brussels. Poured into Chimay goblet. Really wonderful color, though the head was thin and short lived. Color was a reassuringly consistent bronze. Taste was light and fruity, but then fell off almost immediately. Second and third sips felt weak and flat. I may have chilled it too much, but even after letting it warm to something closer to room temperature, the character was the same. Sad to say that I wound up pouring half of it out. Am hoping that my next review will have better results.","theo692","Feb 04, 2005"

The aroma was typical dubbel with spices, brown sugar, roasty malt, and cookie dough. The taste was just what the aroma promised with a sweet and spicy front, a dry roasty middle, and mildly bitter aftertaste. Alcohol is strong at 8%, but is not apparent in the flavor profile. This is a nice beer, fitting very nicely among the now crowded rows of Belgian style bottles lining the shelves of Greens.","rajendra82","Jul 23, 2004"

Nose is dark bread, spicy yeast, and a bit of earthy tobacco. Moderate in body and fairly smooth in texture. Taste begins with caramelized malts and molasses followed by some unsweetened dark chocolate and some slightly bitter woody and leathery notes. Some bitter hops and traces of alcohol are present towards the finish. Pretty nice dubbel, though I prefer their tripel.","Morris729","Mar 24, 2004"
3.78,-6,4,3.5,4,4,3.5,"Served at cellar temperature in a Chimay chalice. The cork had a date(?) 09-04, for what that's worth. It poured a super dark maroon, with a beige head. It had a malty aroma, laced with dark chocolate. Tastes were malt, lemon, leather, chocolate, clove, cinnamon, raisin. The mouthfeel was thin, with light carbonation. As I drank, the beer left dense sheets of lace on the glass. It finished with malt, leather, lemonpeel, and clove. Maybe not the best belgian I've ever had, but well worth having again.

The beer is a dark reddish-brown with a medium thick and somewhat creamy white head. Decent lacing. The aroma consists of faint nuts and malt. Medium bodied and bubbly, with lots of malt and alcohol at first, then accompanied by hops and raisin flavors shortly after. The finish is mostly fruity alcohol with a touch of sourness. Not too bad.","Dogbrick","Jan 14, 2004"
4.25,5.7,4,4,4.5,4.5,4,"On tap at Lucky Baldwin's it's brown with just a trace of red when held to the light. The off-white head sits on top like whipped cream. Every time the glass moves, waves of foam work their way up the side of the glass. An earthy smell and aroma are backed by a sugary rush that has undertones of banana and other fruit but is mainly just pure unadulterated sweetness. This seems a bit of a strange combination, but it all comes together very nicely. The mouthfeel is reminiscent of a milk shake. This is one fine beer.","mickeymac","Jan 14, 2004"
4.05,0.7,4,4,4,3.5,4.5,"11.9 oz bottle pours into a goblet a garnet brown color with a tan head that has moderate retention before falling into sheets of lace. Aroma is of toffee and molasses, with lots of fruity florals(banana), and a hint of alcohol. Mouthfeel has active carbonation and is medium bodied. Taste is toffee banana served on fresh baked bread. Alcohol is well concealed here. Pleasant fruity, candy, maltiness sustains all the way through, without any bitterness or distractions. Very enjoyable with a Belgian cheese plate sampler. Finish is slightly dry with a green apple aftertaste. Very versatile brew and nicely balanced.","merlin48","Jan 07, 2004"

Sweet malt texture turning to a slightly sour taste in the finish and a dryness perhaps from some bittering hops. A little raisiny and thin, but overall, a good Belgian brown. I sampled this one from the 33 cl, hopefully the 75 cl one I have is even better.","crookedhalo","Nov 14, 2003"

So what do we have here? A Belgian that doesn't hold its head, oh man. Yeah its definitely brown, pretty dark brown and a little cloudy, but I don't think I would want a clear Belgian. I smell alcoholic raisins, mellowed by a light coffee aroma. It really feels like soft fleece on the tongue, not quite like a nitro stout, but damn close. The taste is hard to describe. There is definitely some alcohol in the aftertaste. Definitely a lot of malt, not much hops that I can detect. Maybe just a little bittering from some hops, not sure. I just can't put a finger on the taste, it's kind of like a brown ale,on steroids, strong and complex.","HappyHourHero","Oct 22, 2003"

Medium to dark brown with a creamy white head. Traces of light can be seen through the glass, but this is definitely darker than most brown ales I've had. The smell is exceedingly sweet and perfumey. Two of my favorite worlds collide here. Its a cross between an english brown ale and a belgian artisinal. With a nice sweetness that balances perfectly with a mild hoppy bitterness. Aftertaste is sweet. This one stands out for me. Its sweet, its bitter, its Belgian and its good : ).","TripelJ","Jun 04, 2003"

When I removed the wire top from the cork, it exploded! I've never had this happen before. The beer poured (and tasted) a little darker than I expected. The sugary sweetness that is present with so many Belgian beers is quite noticeable here, as is a prominent head and sticky, lasting lace. The taste reminded me a little of Westlverten 8 (only not quite as strong). I would rate this beer in the same category as Corsendonk and Maudite, along with Chimay Red. Very, very good, well worth trying if you like the Belgian style. I will absolutely buy this again. (The second time I tried it, the sweetness was more apparent. Still quite good, but I docked it a little for the sweetness).","JohnnyDuvel","Jan 17, 2003"

Sweet at the front, lots of malt and the top middling in its mouth feel, finish is masterfully hopped, biting in its acidity and the aftertaste quite dry and long lasting. Well worth the sample, gift pack not with standing.","Gusler","Jan 06, 2003"
4.36,8.5,5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Val-Dieu pours a beautiful chestnut brown with an off-white head that clings to the glass. This is the color brown ale should be! The aroma is very fruity with odors of apple, pear, and grapefruit. There is a faint aroma of hops. The taste starts with a warm rich malty sweetness and subtle carbonation. This is followed by apple and apricot flavors and subtle hints of hops with notes of citrus. The aftertaste is that fruity Belgian yeast flavor with sweet malt flavors lingering in your mouth. The mouthfeel is smooth and enjoyable. Alcohol and hops are noticeable but they take a back seat to the rich malt and fruity yeast flavors and aromas. I'm not a big Brown Ale fan but this beer could turn me into a convert. A Great example of a Brown Ale.","purplehops","Dec 27, 2002"
4.16,3.5,5,4,4,4,4.5,"The stiff, lively, bumpy off white head rises and escapes the glass, peaks then slowly settles. Intricate lace is left. Deep garnet in hue w/ a light haze. Notes of sweet, heavily caramelized sugar from both dark candi sugar and dark caramel melt in aroma, along w/ buttery chocolate. Fruitiness is typically enticing, consisting of ripe, dark dried fruit akin to prunes and raisins. Light green apple acetaldehyde provides tartness aromawise. Molasses like, caramelized sweetness upfront in flavor. Clove and mellow chocolate malt ensue. The ripe, dark fruitiness mirrors that of the aroma, but sugary, fructose laden dates is perceptible as well. The token hop bitterness lends an overall sweet, but not cloyingly sweet overall impression. Fairly clean esterwise, with only a hint of bubblegum towards the finish. Moderately bodied, w/ a smooth, firmly malty mouthfeel. Finishes mildly phenolic, w/ malt sweetness and hints of peppry alcohol briefly lingering on the palate. Val Dieu is quite a complex and delicious brew. It's quite clean outright in esters, but possesses an superb coupling of mellow dark fruit and chocolate malt.","marc77","Dec 01, 2002"
