"O - this is an exceptional dubbel and the best new beer to come from Ommegang in some time. Not that others have been bad, but this packs so much uniqueness and keeps to dubbel tradition while it's quality is top shelf. The best of this series I've had thus far and I wouldn't mind seeing this getting a yearly seasonal bottling."
""
"Delightful beer. It is gorgeous in the glass - full of promise and mystery. The aroma is a bit of a letdown for me - a bit thin, a mix of yeast and fruit basket. The flavour, however, is delightful and multilayered. Caramel, cherry, cola and a bit of vanilla pop up in various places on the palate. The mouthfeel and finish are exactly what you hope for in a Dubbel - fizzy, slightly boozy and warming. Add the Game of Thrones reference and you have the full package. Winter is coming!"

"A dark burnished copper that is full of reddish highlights and even a gentle pour yields a huge persistent layer of foam.  The smell is very vinous with many notes of dark fruit a little bit of dark bread, some caramel, a bit of sweetness and some yeast character.  The taste starts out with the caramel and overall the profile is narrower than the aroma would suggest it would be.  Cherry is fairly heavy in the taste as mentioned by other reviewers but I'm not getting as much yeast or malt as is typical from a top notch dubbel.  This beer is very smooth and only a little tingly as there is no significant bitterness and the carbonation while somewhat high is so made up of such fine bubbles that it doesn't detract from the heaviness of the beer.    I think this is a good beer overall not great but quite drinkable and flavorful enough to make it worth a try."

"Still celebrating at Liberty Craft House...dark ruby body with a halo of off-white head...plum, grapefruit, apple, with caramelized, sweet scents to add to the allure...smooth, slightly dry and rather easy drinking, but syrupy and drawing as well...heavy, full-bodied mouthfeel...warming as a dubbel should be...sharp and hoppy, and not much of a variation from their normal offerings...thus, NOT worth the $17 Shop-rite was asking, but well worth the $6 glass today..."

"O: Delicious stuff. Maybe a bit too sweet & could use a bit more complexity on the palate, but that's splitting hairs. Definitely recommended"
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Overall not a bad beer, well balanced for the type of beer that it is, enjoyed it reading my GOT book."
""
""
""
""
""
"a little expensive for what you get but I have no problems with buying this one but a second might be a stretch"
""
""
""
""
""
"O:  Enjoyable and very solid for an American representation of the style.  Great flavors and pretty good complexity for the ABV.  Ommegang makes some great beers so I trust what they put their name on.  I now want to drink an Abbey Ale and see how that one stacks up."
""
""
"O: An acceptable dubbel, but overshadowed by stronger examples from Belgian and even a Canadian brewer (Unibroue)."
""
"O: Quite good. A nice sipper and a solid Dubbel."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I really enjoyed the many flavors that this brew offered. Can't wait for the next one.."
""
""
""
"Would order again, but limited as these bottles are costing C$12.00 each here on the West Coast of Canada."
"Can't say I've  had a lot of American made Belgians but this is true to form. Definitely worth a try."
"A bit more transparent than I like in a Belgian style ale. Nice aroma, but only after it warms. Tastes ok, but no match for the great Belgian Dubbels."
""
""
""
""
""
"I really liked this beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"Cherries plums, lots of dark fruits.  And this overly sweet brown sugar that throws of the balance."
""
""
""
"Not as malty as most Belgian Dubbels. Light fruitiness with flavor of dark cherries. Dry overall. Flavor grew on me."
""
"Fantastic.  Not your typical dubbel, and I tasted a lot of nice sweet flavors (cherry, strawberry).  Was refreshing without being too heavy."
""
""
""
"I bet this would come together with a little age... Caramel sweetness and spicing from the yeast seem to be fighting to dominate the palate."
""
"O: Very good and drinkable dubbel."
""
"Pours a reddish brown with a 1/2 finger fizzy head of very light almost white color. Smells of sweet caramel and hints of nut. Taste is initially smooth with a sweet nutty taste. On the backend, there is a bit out carbonation, but not overwhelming. Overall, I think this is a very pleasant beer. My first Dubbel Ale, so take this review for what it's worth."
""
"The taste is bready at first with some raisin in the middle and subtle toast and nutty flavor from the malt with a gentle sweetness in the flavor. There is a slight spice quality from the yeast which in the realm of phenolics is not quite medicinal and the alcohol is almost undetectable for the strength. Overall I think this is an excellent example of the style -expectations were met and exceeded, this is a style Ommegang has mastered."
""
""
""
"This is probably the best beer so far in the Game of Thrones series."
""
""
""
"Overall pretty good, pretty much standard dubble, with nice esters and phenols, booze comes through as expected, perfumey booze, with lots of nice candied dates figs and brown sugar molasses like flavors, pretty nice."
""
""
""
""
""
"By far the best of these Game of Thrones wankfests, thus far - the resemblance to a well-made Belgian dubbel is remarkable.  Easy to drink, not as sweet as I might have indicated over and again here, and with a decently integrated big ABV.  I'm not drinking this out of a pewter mug, or whatever the hell they use on the show, but that won't diminish my enjoyment of the rest of this big boy."
"Any non Belgian attempt of a Belgian style usually falls flat but not this one. A nice combo of Belgian dubble and local flavours make for a decent beer."
"Overall, this is a worthy and unique dubbel."
"Overall:  Ommegang has the Belgian thing down pat and this is a really nice dubbel"
""
"Ommegang just flat makes great beer."
"Great Dubbel. Enjoyed during the purple wedding."
""
""
""
"Big fruity nose featuring figs, dates and other dried fruit soaked in light sugars. It pours a ruby tinted light brown with a slight haze under a lacy 1‚Äù finely bubbled light tan foam collar. Fruity sweetness starts the attack leading to a touch of tart with light brown sugar to treacle in the background and some fruit cake notes. The natural carbonation gives it a luscious creaminess and gives the medium body a lightness that defies the level of flavor in the beer."
""
""
""
"Really enjoyed this beer. Great head and flavor. Getting a good Dubbel  made in the U.S. is always a time for cheers!"
"750 ml bottle into signature tulip glass, bottled on 9/5/2014. Pours slightly hazy deep ruby red color with a 2 finger dense and fluffy light khaki head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lasts. Nice dense soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of caramel, brown sugar, toast, brown bread, nuttiness, raisin, plum, pear, apple, red grape, clove, pepper, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of fruity/spicy yeast, dark/bready malt, and light earthy hop notes; with great strength. Taste of big caramel, brown sugar, toast, brown bread, nuttiness, raisin, plum, pear, apple, red grape, clove, pepper, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Good amount of earthy yeast spiciness and light bready tartness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, brown sugar, toast, brown bread, nuttiness, raisin, plum, pear, apple, red grape, clove, pepper, and herbal/yeast earthiness on the finish for a while. Damn nice complexity, robustness, and balance of fruity/spicy yeast, dark/bready malt, and light earthy hop flavors; with a great malt/yeast balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a very smooth, crisp, and lightly creamy/bready mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is an excellent dubbel style. All around great complexity, robustness, and balance of fruity/spicy yeast, dark/bready malt, and light earthy hop flavors; and very smooth and crisp to sip on for the ABV. A very enjoyable offering."

"This poured a nice rich red with a one finger thick head that lingered for a bit before lacing down the glass.  It present a  bit sweet on teh nose with some subtle bitterness on the edges.  There was a bit of grassy notes on the tongue with the malt coming through as the beer warmed up.  The mouth feel was on the full bodied side of medium.  This is my favourite of the Game of Thrones series."
"Good starting flavor & lace. Initial high end taste with limited follow thru. Empty on the backend, lacking that lasting flavor.  *enjoyed by draft"
""
""
"My favorite beer that I have tested."
""
""
"Boring beer overall, drinkable but not memorable."
""
""
"Mouthfeel is right, lighter than a Quad or BSDA, but still rich and inviting. The spiciness adds to the mouthfeel.  Overall, another good offering from Ommegang."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"All men must die, indeed.  This beer has a woody, malty scent and nice bold flavors to it.  I like the general ruddy quality to the color and the frothy off-white head, which leaves some decent lacing down the glass.  The taste is earthy with just a hint of fruitiness in the malt.  The mouthfeel is smooth, though a bit thick/lathery on the edge of the tongue.  but the quaintness of it is solid.  This may not transport me to Westeros (or Braavos, or where ever I'm supposed to be going), but overall, it satisfies."

"Although I don't typically care for the classic, murky brown, Dubbel look, this beer had it nailed, and that counts for something.  The smell was a combination of cherry, brown sugar, and toffee, and deeper whiffs revealed a pungency associated with carbonation.  The taste had a brown sugar flavor featured prominently, this was followed by cherry, and caramel, and finally a bite of carbolic acid.  Basically the smell and the taste were self fulfilling.  The body was chewy, and had a soft, silky feel to it.  This was a quality Dubbel, but as a special release, it was a bit too ordinary."
""
"Great Dubbel. Really enjoyed this one."
""
""
""
""
""
"So, so good. The second time I had it wasn't quite as good as the first time I had it, so it loses a tiny bit on the consistency side, but make no mistake--this is easily the best Game of Thrones beer that Ommegang makes."

"Amber, rich, malty, slightly smoky. Just OK.  Valar Morghulis is a common greeting in Braavos, meaning ""all men must die"" in High Valyrian. It is meant in the sense of ""all men must (eventually) die", sooner or later, somewhat like the Latin saying ""memento mori"".  This beer is not quite deserving of it's name.  At the Game of Thrones bar I would prefer the brew that the rich guy is having."
"Great beer overall.  Kinda big but very tasty."
""
"Overall - a well crafted and enjoyable dubbel worth a try. Not much else to say other than it's quite good across the board."
""
"Overall - fantastic dubbel that id get again if I could."
""
"Valar Morghulis pours a dark brownish color with a small lacing head.  There is a very sweet, fruity aroma, nice notes of Belgian candies.  The taste is sweeter, dry fruit flavors, mellow Belgian candy flavors.  Great body and great flavors.  Overall a very complete beer."
"Looks and tastes like a dubbel should. Solid American take on the style. Worth a try."
"Overall, a decent dubbel and worth getting while it's available and before Arya Stark takes out her revenge on you."
""
""
""
"Almost an apple scented head. Nice reddish color and fruity notes. Slightly sweet and very drinkable."
""
""
"A clear deep reddish brown with a dense, long lasting light brown head with exceptional retention and gorgeous lacing, this looks stunning. The nose is great. Very fruity with plums, apricot and raisins along with the classic Ommegang yeast profile with yeasty spice, rising bread and some toffee from the malt profile. A little earthy bitterness is present. The palate opens with a blend of buckwheat honey, nutmeg and yeasty spiciness and layers of fruity complexity. Toffee, raisins, plums, caramel, brown sugar, dried apricots and a touch of cocoa are present. Medium full in body with a moderate level of carbonation, there's a long lasting finish of spice and toffee. Very nice stuff, on the sweeter side for the style, especially when compared to the classics,but still very nicely done."

"O: A solid American-made dubbel with all of the Belgian yeast qualities. Very easy to drink for being 8%. Nice addition to the GoT series of beers"
""
"O:  Glad I finally got to try a GOT brew from Ommegang.  Will be drinking more of this fine dubbel."
""
""
""
"Since I know absolutely nothing about Game of Thrones or its foundational novels, I'll just add a non-sequitur here from the podcast I'm currently listening to: ""It's nothing but hair and teeth!""  Breathe.  Anyway, this stuff pours a rich sienna-ruby topped by a finger or so of khaki foam.  The nose comprises Belgian yeast, stonefruits, light plum, brown sugar, light maple syrup, clove, and a bit of a calvados thing going on in the background.  The taste takes these elements, mixes them together, adds a few liters of water, and emphasizes whatever herbaceous and spicy bitterness and soapiness is present.  It's a strange situation on my tongue, especially considering this process is gradual, with a hint of the fine smell teasing my tongue for an instant before things go sideways.  The body is a lithe medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a fluid feel.  Overall, this dubbel just didn't sit well with me at all.  Judging by the smell, it had some nice ingredients, but the execution (according to my tongue, anyway) didn't match the expectations.  Blargh."

"Overall: Coming into this brew, I was pretty excited to try this out. I was not disappointed. Delicious, full-bodied, flavorful, fulfilling. All these words describe this brew to a tee. I would want to try this again on-tap but highly doubt at this point, I'll find it. I would definitely recommend to a friend. Dubbel's are pretty hard to impress me (I consider myself an IPA man) but this beer definitely stood out. Ommegang has yet to not impress me with each and every creation. They pretty much took the Belgian ale market and ran with it all the way to the taste buds end zone for me. Cheers!"

"Fluffy head but fades quickly. Light brown, hazy. Plums, sugar in the smell. Sugary taste, albeit with an excellent aftertaste."
""
""
""
"Poured into a West chalice a very nice ruby red color, with some very nice carbonation and a very nice thick, creamy off-white one-finger head, with quite a few small-medium islands. The nose is slightly malty, with some nice yeast notes, fruity (plums, raisins, grape). The taste is slightly malty, yeasty, with some dark fruits. Medium body, slightly dry finish. Overall it's a very tasty brew. Have not had an Ommegang brew in quite awhile, nice to see them here in Utah. Would buy again."
""
""
""
"Rich and sweet with a good dollop of alcohol warmth.  There's enough bitterness to prevent from being cloy, but this is still a super malty beer."
""
""
""
""
"o: i'd say its an average dubbel.  a hint more alcohol than i'd like, but it opens up with a nice caramel fruity flavor.  its a bit light in the mouth, which makes it a dangerous drinker at 8%.  average, but i don't think anything more"
"Mouthfeel is dry but heavy. Overall, not bad."
"Enjoyable."

""

""

"Valar Morghulis pours a nice ruddy shade of brown, with an off-white ring of a head encircling the perimeter of the glass. I found the aroma to be particularly appealing to my sweet sense - it's apparent that candied sugar and loads of malt will be found in the flavor. Along with that, it tastes primarily of very balanced dark fruit esters. There's a somewhat crisp or spicy element in the background holding together what is wholly a very soft and smooth libation. The finish is pleasantly yeasty, with perhaps a bit of burnt caramel as well. Ultimately, I enjoyed this very much, perhaps even better than the other Ommegang GoT selections in the past."

"I would drink it when it is both available and I'm in the mood for a dubbel."

"A good dubbel, all of the right characteristics but just not on a par with the Belgian imports. The finish leaves a bitter finish."
"Pretty tasty.  Dark and smokey as expected, but not overwhelming."
"i really do agree with some of the other reviewers about this one being somewhere between a winter warmer and a belgian dubbel. it definitely has elements of both, spicy, although i think more from the yeast than from it actually containing spices."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured from a cork and cage into a snifter, the beer is a muddled, almost opaque, caramel-brown coloring, with a fluffy, bubbly, off-white head that quickly settles out into a filmy coating. Aromas of tangy fruit and caramel sweetness, with a hint of spice and booze. Bubble gum, apple, pineapple, caramel, fig, hints of licorice, medicinal notes, and roasted characteristics. Interesting blend on the nose. Flavors are a little more spice forward, with cinnamon, nutmeg, all spice, cardamom, and clove, all on a tangy caramel and toffee backbone. More of the fruit phenols kick in, too, including the tropical and stone fruit blends. Pretty rich and tangy sweet all at the same time. The body is mid-range, but kept extremely light by the carbonation. Richly sweet and moderately spiced blend in the aftertaste, which is kept in check by the carbonation. Frothy, effervesced, fairly clean finish. Decent brew."

"Agree this is between a dubbel and winter.  Enjoyable but falls a little short on both...."

"i really do agree with some of the other reviewers about this one being somewhere between a winter warmer and a belgian dubbel. it definitely has elements of both, spicy, although i think more from the yeast than from it actually containing spices. i havent had all of the game of thrones beers, but this is on par with the ones i have had. its a little light in body for both of the styles that it flirts with, which i think is a critique in this seasonal context, but it doesnt affect how good tastes. molasses malt flavor, sweet and unrefined in an intentional way. the yeast, as always from ommegang, is tremendous, it dries it out real well, fluffs it up with nice carbonation, and has a classic belgian taste to it. there are also notes of dried fruit, allspice, vanilla, and black tea, very subtle on all counts, but definitely present. more body would make this a better overall beer in my opinion, it just seems a little watery for all the flavors going on, but i think its a nice continuation of the series. what i really want to try is that new wild brown they just released!"

"Buddy of mine picked this up and we split this after work.  Smooth taste, slight fruity flavor with hints of caramel.  A tad bit too much carbonation."

"750 ml bottle, packaged on 06/20/2014, best by 06/2017.  Served in a St. Bernardus chalice, the beer pours a reddish/brown color with about a half inch creamy tan head that stayed around a long time.  There's a good amount of lacing.  The brew smells like dark fruit (plums, red grapes), candi sugar, cloves, sweet spices, and caramel.  Taste is similar to the aroma, but there's also some bready malt, cherries, peppery spice and a bit of honey.  It's a good sweet, fruity and spicy brew.  Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's creamy and coating.  It's also well carbonated, the soft carbonation helps make this pretty easy to drink.  I liked this brew a lot, and it's my favorite of the Ommegang Game of Thrones beers made so far.  Definitely worth a try!"
""
""
"I want to like this beer more than I actually do. While not a bad brew by any means, it's a bit too generic which is ironic considering the excellent and unique label artwork on the bottle."

"O: If you are a dubbel lover I don't think you will find much wrong with this beer, otherwise you really won't be blown away it's a solid beer but nothing exciting. Might not like the slight off metallic taste and smell."

"O:  A solid beer, overall.  It could use a bit more depth and higher attenuation, but is still enjoyable.  Also I have to give props to Ommegang for the great bottle design--the inclusion of ""Valar dohaeris"" on the cork was an awesome touch."
"O: Game of Thrones is my absolute favorite show in existence. In embarrassing honesty, I silently squealed with joy seeing a new GoT brew on the shelf at my local bottle shop because this new Ommegang brew signifies the nearing of a new season... I'm highly skeptical of beers bearing the name of a show of such a high caliber, but Ommegang rarely disappoints with their themed offerings and Valar Morghulis is no exception. This Belgian style dubbel offers the sharp, spicy bite of Arya Stark, the dark mystery of Jaqen H'gar, and a complexity that could almost be compared to the mind of George R.R. Martin."
""
"Very good dubbel, as would be expected from Ommegang.  Authentic to the Belgian style as always.  Definitely worth trying and my favorite of the GOT series noting that I missed Iron Throne."

"This beer is not that great.  For a special release, they need to work harder.  Very disappointed in what is usually a great brewer."
"750ml bottle: This one pours a murky, dark caramel color. There was a sliver of a tan head that lingers and leaves some lacing. The nose is good. Some yeastiness and breadiness, caramel, spice, hint of clove, some subtle fruits. The taste is good. Actually a hint of dryness to it. Good caramel malt body, some peppery spice, faint fruits, a faint roastiness. A good brew!"

"Poured into a Gulden Draak tulip. Pours a hazy, medium orange amber with a twon finger tan head with good retention and lots of lacing. Aroma of sweet bready and candi malt, fresh dark stone fruit,Belgian yeast, root spices. Flavor is mildly caramel malt, plums, figs, dates, brown sugar, clove and pepper. Finishes with a slight, but appropriate astringent bitterness fromt the spices. Medium bodied with peppery active carbonation. A very nice spicy dubbel and easily the best of this series. I was somewhat underwhelmed by the GoT ales so far, to my surprise because I know what Ommegang is capable of. This is an excellent comestic dubbel that is a bit spicier (some winter warmer elements here), but very Belgian. I liked this a lot."
""
""
""
"Tanginess translates to the feel with a lasting effect on the tongue.  It feels like champage with its effervescence and strong vinous and dry crispness with the exception of its firm medium body.  Creamy carbonation moves smoothly to support."
""
""
""
"Very good beer that has a dry finish.  Look and smell are very nice, but nothing super special.  Bought this beer because of the G of T tie in and was not disappointed."
""
"O: The balance is just really out of whack here. The sweetness takes hold and it becomes a bit cloying. We know Ommegang can make a world-class dubbel. Case in point: Ommegang Abbey Ale. So what gives?"
""
"Overall, excellence in a bottle I can't wait until the new season of HBO's Game of Thrones begins...I'm officially a fan and a homer of that series!"

"Overall: This is a very good dubbel that stands well by itself, even without the book or television reference in the packaging. I strongly believe that anyone who appreciates Belgian style beers will enjoy this and I recommend giving it a shot. What I really like about this beer is that it is nice and mellow. I don't know the background on this beer but it really tastes like it was aged before it hit the shelves because the flavors are a bit subdued but meld very well together. In any event I really enjoy this."
"A curio of a good brewery and show... nothing more."

"Ommegang has made another perfect dubbel."
"Strong effervescence pulls from a lush creaminess as the medium-bodied beer dries swiftly. Dry red wine character decorates the finish as the sweetness quivers and a woodish hop bite provides a subtle balance to the lingering candied sweetness. Its simply a masterful beer with grape overtones early and late."

"O- A fine example of the style. Drinkable and tasty. As the beer warms more nuances in taste and smell appear. I would recommend this beer."

"O: Great dubbel! Great offering from Ommegang and different enough from their other similar brews that this stands well on its own. Recently tried, Wesmalle, and I am confident I liked that better than this... but not by much and would be fund to do a side by side comparison. I'd definitely buy again."
