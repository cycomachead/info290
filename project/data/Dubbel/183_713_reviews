"16 ounce ceramic bottle into tulip glass, best before 10/15/2017. Pours crystal clear very dark reddish brown color with a 2 finger dense and rocky khaki head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of big raisin, plum, fig, pear, apple, caramel, toast, dark candi sugar, bread, herbal, grass, light pepper, and yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of fruity/earthy yeast and dark/bready malt notes; with good strength. Taste of big raisin, plum, fig, pear, apple, caramel, toast, dark candi sugar, bread, herbal, grass, light pepper, and yeast earthiness. Light earthy yeast spiciness on the finish; with lingering notes of raisin, plum, fig, pear, apple, caramel, toast, dark candi sugar, bread, herbal, grass, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice complexity and robustness of dark/bready malt and fruity/earthy yeast ester flavors; with a great malt/yeast balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, fairly crisp, and lightly slick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a damn nice Belgian dark ale style. All around great complexity and balance of dark/bready malt and fruity/earthy yeast ester flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A very enjoyable offering."

"Not a bad brown brew, nice head, lacing, and body.  The very weak to non-existent aroma is definitely detrimental to the overall score.  The flavor isn’t bad, just weak."

"I'm not a huge fan of Belgian Darks, but this was certainly worth a try and its in a cool bottle. The beer poured a cloudy dark amber with reddish hue. The scent had Belgian sugar, peat and slight roast. The taste was most Belgian leaning with touches of toffee and earth. The mouthfeel was medium in body with not much carbonation. Overall this is a decent beer and worth a try for those that enjoy dark Belgians."

"O- I thoroughly enjoyed it. The flavors develop nicely as it warms up."
"O - Great beer. Full bodied and flavorful, but not overwhelming. I could drink one, or several, in one sitting. Cheers."

"The foam lasts to the final sip. From the ceramic jug with swing-top closure. There were three varieties of these brews at Bev Mo in La Jolla."
""
"Ceramic flip-top bottles? That is some old-school packing. All in all, we are pretty happy with this brew, clearly a benchmark for the style. Happy as well to see this brand come around again to the US, bringing back memories of some of our initial explorations into Belgian beer."

"My oh my what a lovely dark Belgian ale! I poured this into a goblet and noticed the large frothy head and dark color. Nutty flavor very refreshing! I need to try the other St. Sebastiaan brews next! The ale was VERY strong but did not feel like alcohol at first and quite refreshing trappiste style beer."
"Poured a darkish brown (not close to black) with solid one finger head and lace ring. A mix of yeast and roasted sweet malts, like some caramel and bitter chocolate or coffee mixed with bread and char/roasted malts. Medium bodied with a solid malt base that is sturdy and bready, the beer has a dryness to it not typical in most dubbels. Still, easy to drink and creamy, almost chewey, with a nutty toffeesque sweetness along with touches of dark chocoolate. Yeast adds balance and there is a bit of sharp carbonation; citric hops and dark fruit/raisins/figs taste sensation barely noticeable as mostly muted compared to the sweet and roast malt. Overall, a good beer but just not my preference for this style, hence, my ""low"" rating."

"Poured from a pint ceramic bottle into a tulip glass, best before 08/29/2016. This pours a dark brown almost black with a massive tan head which dissapates in a few minutes to a thin film. The smell is mostly malty, dark fruits, coco. The feel is mediumish high carbonination. The taste is okay, lighter than expected, you get some brown sugar, plum, coco, light malts."

"Review from 10/2010 notes. Poured into a Nostradamus flute glass. Pours a deep murky red amber with a fast dissipating off white head. Aroma of malt and cola, nice. Taste is light toasty malt, fruits and cola, abruptly finishing to nothing. Light to medium bodied. Very subdued and uninteresting. Not unpleasant, but boring."
""
""
""
"Fantastic heavy ceramic bottle. Dark cola-like head with large abundant bubbles. Head faded fast. A lot of carbonation rolls around the mouth. Needs to warm up a bit. Tastes sweet and is more complex than other dubbels I have had. I did not pick up on bubble gum notes as I have in other dubbels, which was nice. It was a good dubbel, but dubels are not my thing."
""
"Overall - not a bad brew at all! Very interesting to taste, and given the purity law, pretty amazing in the quality and complexity involved."
""

"There may not be much variety in the taste, but this is one of the most friendly dark beers you'll find. Goes extremely well with food. Comforting, nutty flavor, pleasant smell, great mouthfeel, and pleasant appearance. Well worth the world class rating it gets from the bros. If you drink this while not eating YMMV."
"DOA"

"mouthfeel as pretty light considering the style"
"O: Overall I think this is a really nice beer. It has a very light character. I would drink it again and would recommend it. It would go well with a number of dishes, such as a lightly seasoned steak or a light dessert desert."
""
"St. Sebastiaan is very approachable as a good, relaxing beer. It would also work well with mild foods."
""
"O: just the perfect beer, it was a christmas present from last year and after sitting there for so long I thought I should probably drink this. I'm so very glad I finally did. This is by far one of, if not, the best dubbel I've ever had."
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel: St. Sebastiaan is on the thin side which really doesn’t let the flavors stick to the tongue like I would hope but it makes it very easy to drink."
""
"The slight tartness definitely holds the sweet malts in check. Overall, not too bad but I've definitely had better Belgian dubbels."
""
"It's very high in alcohol. There's a maltyness that pervades throughout and a dark fruit taste of grape. Thick and very heavy, yet smooth in short doses. Interesting."
"M: Low to medium carbonation provides barly enough balance for the medium attenuated beer. Pretty drinkable."
"O - Very good dubbel that I highly recommend."
"O- Good Dubbels, not worth the 12 bucks. Drinkability is certaintly high."
"A bottle that have been abused a bit but this beer has a thin metallic body to it that is not the pleasing and more fusels than this reviewer like in Belgian Dubble. Thankfully big ass porcelain bottle was gift. Becoming more drinkable as it warms up but not enough for me to change my numbers. Definitely not the first dubble I would reach for but definitely not the last."
"Overall, this is an ok beer. I won't be getting it again because I didn't find it to be as good as the packaging might suggest."
"Poured from 500ml bottle. Fluffy white head topped the off black beer. Dried fruit and apple are in both smell and taste. Hardly no carbonation makes this easy to drink. A lighter dubbel than I am used to. Still a solid beer and well worth the price paid."
"jd"
"Has a strong, malty aroma with a spicy undertone and a hint of apple. It pours a semi-transparent mahogany with a thin and not too persistent light tan head. Flavor is malty with an undertone of apple and a hint of caramel. Texture is smooth yet subtly fizzy, and it leaves a fairly persistent soft tingle and just a whisper of sweetness."
"served in a goblet, bottle was non chilled, served around 60 degrees. murky brown with hints of reddish mahongany. whitish tan head...a little sticky. has clove spice on the nose, also something that reminds me of green bananas. notes of chocolate and raisin in there. tastes like clove up front, with the raisiny fruit taste, also some faint chocolate, and black cherries. spicy and sweet, not bitter at all. mentholy finish (alcohol and clove). full bodied but not assertive; has a very full mouthfeel without being overly carbonated. lays down quite smooth. drinkability very good for the style. worth a go."
"A nicely balanced, evenly tempered dubbel. Lots going on, with nothing getting too big for its britches."
"Full, crisp, and dark mahogany body, and plenty of head. Love the presentation in the ceramic bottle. Pleasant, but subtle aroma. Above average taste, smooth from front to back, fruit flavors and hops come out more the longer the taste buds are exposed, some hints of spice linger after swallowing. Silky, yet foamy throughout the mouth, very enjoyable to savor each drink for an extended period."
"It's lighter than expected on the palate, with a blueberry jam flavor up front. Sweetness is moderate, though the fruity yeast character borders on cloying. There's some spiciness, anise, a touch of clove. Soft roasted malt flavors make a brief appearance toward the finish, but this beer is more about the yeast. The body is light, perhaps a bit thin for my liking. Not a bad beer overall, nor a great one."
"Almost threw my back out picking up the 500ml bottle. I do love the presentation! I will probably recycle the heavy ceramic bottle for my next homebrew. Appearance is a nice dark brown with some decent lacing. A rich brownish head. Smell is sweet with some hints of yeast, malt, and bananas,and raisin coke. Taste is like honey raisins and brown bread, Mouthfeel is medium bodied. Drinkability is great but since 500ml is twice the price of chimay blue, it's hard to keep picking it up, unless, of course, I need more bottles for recycling!"
"Notes: Overall very average. Not very complex and, personally, not fruity enough for me though the smoke/roast is somewhat interesting."
"D: Easy drinking. Had the feeling of an aged beer and that is always ok for me. Dubbels continue to surprise me with how well they age."
"D: Phenomonal."
"Impressions: Pretty good. Toasty and sweet with a unique aroma and taste. This would be a good beer for those inexperienced with Belgian beers. Love the earthiness."
"Beer is in very cool looking ceramic bottle with flip stopper for after cap is opened. Poured into DFH goblet. Intial pour created nice thick 3 inch ivory colored head on top of dark copper beer. Smell is slightly sweet and maltly-no hops detected. Taste hints of carmel, with creamy feel, and improved as it warmed. Beer retained a half inch head throughout consumption. The excellcent smooth taste made for high drinkability. Highly recommended."
"After sitting in the fridge for about 3 years, I decided to open this bottle (i.e. I ran outta beers). Poured a dark brown color into a small tulip glass. Nice bubbly head and still carbonated. Smell slightly roasted. A light roasty taste with a full mouthfeel. Drinkability is that of drinking at your own pace. A good beer to try at least once."
"D Very good, especially for the style and the slightly elevated ABV. 4.0"
"I like this a lot and will buy it again!"
"Huge frothy head, given its size resolves down to a half finger swiftly, light cream white in color, leaves solid sheets of lacing down the glass sides. There's enough yellow in the dark brown color to give it more of a murky muddiness, the carbonation visible through that murk. As strong as the caramel and toffee are in the nose, remains clean overall, dark chocolate covers the plum, cherry fruit scents, some oats and sweeter grains, flower and orange citrus driven dissolve. Light-bodied, very foamy in the mouth, soft and fluffs up the whole experience. The caramel, butterscotch, brown sugar notes are obvious but hardly sweet in an enduring fashion, in fact it's a fairly dry beer. Orange peels, granola, peat moss slip in, the cherry, plum, banana fruit mostly quiet. Classy and easy to drink, a little more depth of flavor couldn't hurt, though."
"D- Really nice drinkable beer, nice depth of character, fills me with desire for another one, complex, a really great beer that very accurately depicts the style."
"A solid Belgian ale, but leaves a little to be desired."
"For a beer its strength I found this highly delectible. Really enjoyed the subtle complexities."
"D: A great example of how unique this style can be. Definitely one I will be re-visiting in the near future. This stuff is dece!"
"On a rainy night while my little one sleeps gently in his crib, I search frantically through the entanglement of kitchen wares I call a top drawer, and after many guffaws and sighs I finally procure my bottle opener, sit down on the terrace and crack open one of the finest brews I have ever had. Life is glorious."
"D) An excellent Belgian dark ale. With 6.9% alcohol, you could enjoy a few and still remain cognizant"
"S- Not very hoppy, smells mostly like malt a little sweet"
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, smooth, with mineral notes found in some of the better Belgian beers."
"This is a good Beer for those who enjoy Dark Beers and I will purchase more in the future."
"Very enjoyable sipper."
"This beer does not rank up there with the Trappist versions of the style that I have had, but still is very nice."
"D: This was on sale and I couldn't pass up the super cool stone bottle. I'm very glad I grabbed this. Perhaps too pricey to buy more than once a year, but well worth the investment."
"Oil feel to it. Slick. Caramel aftertaste. Little punch or bite to it. Seems very flat, too."
"A dark beer that has a slightly sweet flavor to it. Notes of dark fruit and prunes in the nose. No hop flavor at all, and not much of a flavor overall really. Absolutely no carbonation at all when poured, looked like brown water. Not a good beer flat but would like to try again if carbonated properly, if that is how it is supposed to be. As is would not reccomend especially at around $9 a bottle."
"A dark and syrupy beer. Slightly sweet, not particularly hoppy or flavorful. ZERO CARBONATION upon pouring into the goblet. As in NO bubbles. I'm not sure if this is a common problem, but if it is, I'd be hesitant to try it again. It's not good flat, but I see that it could potentially be good with the proper carbonation. I might try it again, and update my review...."
"I poured a 16 ounce bottle into a tupip glass. This pours a beutiful dark color with hints of red. A big fluffy head forms, then fades quickly leaving little streaks of lace. When I held it up to a light there are lettle yeasty floaters. The nose is of a sweet brown sugary alchohol. The first sip is sweet and the finish is of a lingering complew alchohol. The beer is medium bodied with light carbonation. The beer is an enjoyable sipper. A damn fine beer."
"D - Not to bad but I wouldn't bother picking up another bottle unless I was sure it was actually carbonated."
"Purchased: Plaza Liquors, Tucson AZ"
"There's also a musty cave flavor that is hard to describe. Very pleasing."
"A solid beer, if a bit thin on the mouthfeel."
"An enjoyable Dubbel, but not quite as exciting as I was hoping for. Still, I recall the price being pretty good and would recommend it for fans of Belgian beers."
"Bottom line : Buy a few."
"A nice Belgium Dubble. One I would drink again and recommend."
"This style is always hit or miss with me. This is a great example of the style. Probably my favorite to date. If I remember correctly, this can be had for a very decent price too, especially considering the cool ceramic, swing-top bottle it comes in."
"Although a little disappointed with this beer I was not completely dissatisfied. It is getting better as it warms and requires sipping at slower intervals. Enjoy slowly and limit your intake."
"Drinkability: This is good stuff. I was surprised by the roasted malt flavors I was detecting. If I had to recommend a Dubbel, I'd recommend it to a friend."
"I recieved this beer from Cape Fear Wine and Beer. I was drawn to the dark ceramic bottle with the picture of the monk on the front. My barkeep popped it and poured into tulip glass for me, as I prepared to drink I was taken aback by the amazing head that erupted from the glass. The next aspect of the beer i took notice to was the beautiful raven color of my glass. The lacing of this beer was as if someone had draped a doilie across my glass in the pour. Now to the smell a massive roasted malt caramel breath drew my face into the glass to embibe. The color of this beer being somewhat deceptive it is amazingly drinkable. I am tempted to chug, but restrain myself and sip this nectar away."
"Drinks easy, a nice clean tasting, unassuming Dubbel"
"d: a disappointment. looks like more money went into the presentation (ceramic bottle) than the beer. too bad."
"500 cl ceramic bottle. Dark brown colour aond no head at all. At first I thought it was going to be bad from travel, but no. Delicious aroma of pears, peaches, dark fruits and chocolate. How can this be made according to the German purity law? Sweet silky flavor, but a lighter body than expected. Taste of fruits, again peaches, port wine, spices, and chocolate. It's great, the only weakness is the shy body."
"This beer poured a very dark brown with a thick persistent head. It exhibited excellent lacing when I swirled the glass. The aroma is mostly sour with some malt undertones. The taste is quite malty with some hints of sourness and perhaps chocolate. The mouthfeel is full but shy of chewy. This is an interesting and complex brew that works well."
"Tasted nice, if a bit bland for a Dubbel. Rich and malty, a slight bitterness and a hint of chocolate, but nothing like other Dubbels I've had. A bit of a shame too, nice packaging. Maybe the German influence is to blame."
"I recommend this to anyone looking to step out of the norm...this is a good way to get a Newkie Brown drinker to try new things!!!"
"Poured a dark brown/ brick color , with a tan , creamy head that left a sticky lace. The aroma is earthy , some spice , tinge of dark fruit , bit of metallic aroma. The taste is fairly complex , with a lively carbonation. Chewy , sweet , caramel maltiness at first , then some dark fruit , tinge of steely crystal malt , some earthy spice , and maybe a small bit of bitter hops to balance. The mouthfeel is a bit chewy and creamy from the carbonation. Definatly a drinkable dubbel. Imo, this one is on the earthier side."
"Belgian Dubbel Recommended."
"The taste of toasty toffee with a caramel nose with layers of soft malts and hops. A big beer without being overly heavy. Extremely well-balanced."
"Again, I hope I got a bad bottle. Luckily the taste is good enough to warrant drinking the whole thing!"
"This brew has a very slick and wet presence on the palate. Almost zero carbonation. Very subdued taste notes with toasty nutty nuances. All I can say is wtf. I was expecting more. I think I may have gotten a bad one, but for the price I paid I don't think this one will be getting a second shot. Others are reporting foamy heads and I got nothing."
"This beer is so faint, I think that it would be best saved to be paired with a meal so that the flavors of the meal could take prominence over this brews mild and timid nature."
"Ruby colored with a nice frothy tan head. Dried fruit and malt sweetness as well as alcohol in the aroma. Flavor profile included dried cherries and prunes, malt and too little spice to provide any oomph to the melange of sweet malt and fruit. Decent, but not something Id look for again."
"Large glass bottle (differant then whats shown above), caged and corked. Opened with a lot of energy, the cork went flying! Pours the typical Dubbel dark brown, clear with a noisy tan head, with medium sized bubbles and moderate retention. lacing was blotchy but generally unimpressive. Nose of vanilla, cola, toffee. This is a pretty drinkable dubbel, perhaps its on the lighter side of the spectrum for the style. More cola, caramel and sweet candi sugars. Smooth finish, adds up to a tasty and drinkable sipper. Worth a try if you like the style."
"Opinion: I am really enjoying this beer. I like how the flavor profile has changed as it warms, and it is turning out very refreshing and flavorful. There may be a hint of oxidation here, but it only adds complexity as the flavors come out of the warmer beer. I would definitely drink this one again."
"Presentation: Packaged in a sixteen-ounce earthenware crock, served in a Belgian chalice."
"Drinkability: Unlike some of the more famous dubbels, this is not as complex nor is it as sweet; nevertheless, it has its merits and is worth seeking out"
"Blah drinkability. Probably need to find another bottle but at $11 each I wont be giving this one a retry anytime soon."
"a classsic belgian beer with an accent of alcohol, recommended like a appetizer and with snacks, no more, serving in a pilsner glass, high in carbonation, high in hops and malt taste and aroma, appearance is deep brown, good for me, smell like a extreme beer, mouthfeel is not impressed, drinkability awful, not recommended"
"750 mL bottle, cork, caged, and primed to explode on opening. Dark maroon color, little bits of carbonation, clear body. Head is very ragged from the beginnning, it came up a lot on the pour, due to the explosivity. Lots of diacetyl in the nose, dark fruits, and carmel. Taste is dark yet sharp and well hopped. The belgian funk is noticeable and welcomed. Acidity is pretty high, this may be an old sample, but the bottle has an unitelligable batch code on it. Pretty good, although a fresh sample might be better."
"I like the ceramic bottle. I guess that Im a sucker for interesting packaging. This beer is an earthy brown color, fairly clear, and has a soapy white head. Fisheye bubbles and moderate lace are notable in the foam. The smell is sort of subdued for a Belgian dubbel, with just a bit of yeast, sugar, and malt present. Its alright, but I would have appreciated a more pronounced and complex aroma. The taste makes up a little groundpeppery, a bit of alcohol, malt in the front, yeast, and brown sugar. Fairly light bodied for a dubbel, but its very drinkable, and worth a try. Its not worth the price, however, to have another one."
"Beautiful very dark brown. Smell of toffee and roast and alcohol. A hint of sourness and dryness and sweetness, yet none of the above. Complex in every sip, yet simple and very drinkable. Very much liked.A surprise at Volo Cafe. Outstanding earthenware bomber that my drinking buddy kept for his wife."
"This beer pours a murky dark brown with a burgundy tint. Thick beige head and nice lacing. The aroma is malty and nutty, but has some characteristics of a Flemish Sour too. Medium-bodied and smooth with flavors of burnt malt, raisin, sour fruit and yeast. The finish is on the thin side and is rather fruity. All in all this is a decent Belgian. At times it is well balanced and at others it is not, but more often than not it is pretty good."
"Pours a light tan, two finger-head that goes slowly leaving a good lace. Nice clear, deep amber color. Medium carbonation and medium bodied. Nose is a malty chocolate. Starts sweet, finishes smooth and mellow. Nice dark beer. $7.99 for a 16oz bottle from Hoosick Street Discount Bev. Troy, NY."
"First I noticed in the smell that it would be sweet. Some hops were there but overal malty. Tasting it afterwards it was malty & sweet. The more I drank the sweeter it got and after a promissing start at the end it turned out to be quiet disappointing for a Belgium Dubbel."
"Caramel colour with a fizzy head. Malty with a ton of fruity flavours ranging from banana to apple. Fantastic."
"This is a brew that balances and improves throughout."
"Overall, decent from a flavor and looks perspective but in the end it left me wanting more, and with so many wonderful Belgians out there, I doubt I'll be visiting this particular brew again."
"The beer departs the swing top crockery 1/2L bottle a burgundy color that is somewhat hazy with a portly head, creamy in texture and a nice light tan color with the lace forming a velum like curtain to conceal the glass. Nose is malt dominated but has pleasant over ripe fruit aromas, quite nice. The start is sweet with a decent malt presence and the mouth feel moderate in feel, the finish is minimally carbonated, wine like, pertinently hopped, quite dry somewhat tart aftertaste, nice drinkable beer."
"Feel is light, gets a bit of a pick up toward the middle and into the finish. Its not watery, more or less just thin or perhaps weak-ended, it lacks some depth and thickness thats usually attributed to a good dubble. Finishes dry, but works at it in a tenuous manner. This was pretty average."
"Notes: The bottle is very interesting. I was excited to drink this based on the bottle alone. I was not let down, I highly recommend this beer."
"This brew is a murky brown color, with a excellent tan head. The scent is malty, with some fruits and possibly a little alcohol spice. The taste has a nice chewy malt backbone, with hops and dark fruits intermingling. Nice mouthfeel. Not a bad beer at all."
"The beer pours a dark brown color with a thick, frothy, white head. The aroma is good. It boasts of pale and roasted malts which give it a nice brown, toasted scent. The taste is good. It's smooth with a dry roasted flavor that goes down easy. It says dark, but it fits more of a brown style. The mouthfeel is fine. This is a medium/full bodied beer with good carbonation. This is a fine Dubbel. It has good flavor and aroma. I'd buy this one again."
"Pours a dark clear brownish mahogany color with a 1 finger white head that shrinks quickly down to a long lasting layer. The smell is delicious with a musty fruit and yeast smell. Musty fruit, I say...I Iike it! The taste is again a musty taste providing the background to a light sweet raison, yeast, faint hops, and a barely noticeable alcohol. It is light bodied with an almost watery feel but very tasty despite this and makes it go down too easy. Op uw gezonheid!"
"Pours a deep transparent ruby read with a full, rocky, tan head. Light on the carbonation. The aroma is bitter, spicy and of over-ripe fruit. The taste is somewhat one-dimensional, with a slightly sweet start and a lasting bitter finish. The mouthfeel is watery with some effervescence and a lasting bite. A pleasant warming feeling as it goes down."
"Tastes pretty good especially on the mid-palte. Unique is the word I would use to describes its flavor. Fruity and well hopped. Lots of cherries, raisins, dates, some clove on the mid-palate with a well balanced smooth character. Tastes great!"
"{Hard to believe it is above 6% ABV due to the fact it came from a beer store in TN and beers above 6% ABV cannot be sold in a beer store in TN.}"
"Head is big, dense, yellowy-cream-colored, uneven. Nice. Beer is red/brown and a little hazy. There's a nice, sweet, toffee, bready, yeasty smell. Wow. Nice toffee leads to a deep, deep malt, some chocolate and a little fruit. Very creamy. Finishes bready with some alcohol and fruit. Great. This is a great, creamy, not-too-sweet beer."
"Bronze hue with tawny-reddish highlights, appealing visually, unfortunately the bubbly off-white head didnt comply, it faded quickly from the zenith of a finger. Disorganized head remnants tried to cap the beer, it did not. Sparse lacing. The nose was pleasant and typical of a Belgium Dubbel. Soft toasty malts with good amounts of bread, yeast too, the fruitiness is secondary, apples and raisins, distant earthy-spiciness. I prefer more potency but it was still inviting. I found the palate to be exceedingly dry, which I really enjoyed. This is not the most challenging Dubbel Ive run across. By know means is this simple tasting, stark crystal malts upfront, cleaner than need be, in the middle there is a mildly toothy alcohol bite mixed with a subtle hops spiciness, followed quickly by a note of fruitiness. The finish is lightly peppery, malty but clean and slick. The carbonation is almost completely absent, which is nice, medium body. Respectable mouthfeel. I think this is too easy to drink. I want to have to sip my good beers. I forked out $9.00 for a 16-ounce ceramic jug here in Omaha. It is far too costly to drink again; especially considering it was not that outstanding a solid offering."
"This poured a nice deep dark color with a nice sized head that left nice sized lacing. The smell was of a sweetness almost similar to a berry drink. Flavor lacked complexity that a Belgian should have. Too sweet and not enough hops or spice. Finishes a little wetter than most Belgians, which isn't always bad. Decent tasting but not much more and not worth the $7.99 for 16 oz."
"Drinkability  This went down fairly well. The aftertaste though was a little dry, so Im thinking maybe more hops than needed for the style? Overall, a good ale, but at 7.99 for a 16 oz bottle it's a stretch."
"I found this in a neighborhood Moscow grocery store. It came in a lovely grayish-red ceramic 16 ounce bottle with both a bottle cap and a resealable flip-top. It poured a wonderful clear orange-brown color under a tannish-beige head that was both firm and long lasting. Mine gave beautiful lace rings all the way down. The nose was big and malty - announced its presence with authority. The mouth was a touch on the heavy side and not too tingly, although a bit more than I expected. The initial taste is very complex: caramel, citrus, grains. The finish is a tad too sour, with the lurking presence of alcohol somewhere deep down inside. Buried even more deeply were the hops - they are there, but you sure have to look for them. Hops do come out in the sweetish-sour aftertaste, leaving a mish-mash that I did not actually find all that appealling. This brew was a tad too sour, not bitter enough, for my taste. Still, definitely a quality brew."
"Nice malty full flavored aroma. A welcome break from the poor quality bees I have rated recently. It poured a huge head of light brown small bubbles. When it receded, it left little or no lacing. It has a cloudy dark brown body. It's flavor is different. It was smooth and no after bite or remarkable fore taste. All in all, it was a good brew to watch the war news on. The bottle is a nice brown ceramic flip top container."
"Drinkability: This is about as exciting as watching paint dry."
"Pours to a ruby-brown color with a thick, chunky tan head. The aroma is fruity, with some medicinal characteristics. The flavor is sweet at the beginning, it then flows to a fruity medicinal flavor. This beer finishes off dry, and somewhat bitter; a bit astringent too. It is medium-full in body, not to bad on the ease of drinking. This one was better than I expected."
"I absolutely love this beer."
"A quality Pils like finish makes this bubbly brew quite memorable. If you like your Dubbels more earthy and less sweet, give this one a try."
"Cherry wood/ruby in color with a very thin, lacy, off-white head. The aroma is yeasty and bready, with some light sour notes. Flavor starts off smooth and sweet, dominated by a rich but unoppressive maltiness. It soon develops a bready character, with perhaps a light spicy cinnamon note. Diacteyl, butterscotch character is also apparent mid-palate, but not at all out of place. Finishes with a restrained hop bitterness and a lightly chocolatey, nutty aftertaste. Medium-full body. Really a terrific beer -- very complex but eminently drinkable."
"Dark garnet color, somewhere between eggplant and maroon, with a huge, rocky, creamy tan head. Aroma is soft, sweet, nutty, with notes of toffee, butterscotch and dates. Smooth palate, with a generous, gorgeous, tingly mouthful of hops, abundant in flavor. Excellent body and texture, extemely fruity, too. Like a big, sparkling, delicious boozy fruit punch. I caught this on sale for $4.99 a 750 ml, which is a bargain and then some. A reliably tasy Belgian brew."
"Dark, hazy cinnamon brown with a big dark tan head that laces intensely. Cotton candy aromas with some pear smells. Very malty tastes, spicy pumpkin, some fruit, and a nice smooth mouthfeel. No sense of overt hops to my tongue, the beer finishes smoothly with some ester sense and a touch of acidity on the back of the mouth. Nice beer, could be a little more complex, but I tend to like the entire Sterkens line. Like other St. Sebastiaans, a cool swing top crock, this one is dark brown."
"Cool ceramic bottle with a resealable cap hides a hazy, ruby brown ale that pours a tan, rocky head that holds well. Nose is of plums, raisins and alcohol. Taste reminded me of plum wine initially and went to some dark fruit spiciness. Hops balance the brew but are not in the forefront, providing a dryish finish but not contributing any flavor other than an astringency. Very nice dubbel with typical Belgian yeastiness complexities."
"This beer poured a very dark amber color and formed a nice very light tan bubbly head that subsided quickly and left some lace.  The aroma was of malt and fruit, very sweet.  The flavor was of malt, fruit and some spice.  The body was a medium and the finish had elements of both the fruit and the spice.  The alcohol was detectable, but not distracting."
"Notes: Relatively sweet brew with odd complexities that are well drawn out all over the palate. A beer that is worth the experience alone and for a brew I would embrace again."
