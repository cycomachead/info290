3,-17.6,,,,,,"Overall: I think in the class, this beer is too chocolaty, syrupy, and sweet. It is missing spice complexity, lite-fruits, fruity-yeast complexity, bitterness and hop complexity; overall it is off in taste for a Belgian double. I wouldn't consider it a Belgian double in a blindfolded taste test. It tastes more like a lite, perhaps fruitier and spicier, seasonal sweet chocolaty stout to me, but definitely misses the mark on a Belgian style double. The sweetness is too overpowering and Coca-cola tasting, and this really kills the beer.","EStCharles","Dec 06, 2014"

3.68,1.1,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"22 ounce bottle into chalice, no bottle dating. Pours fairly crystal clear deep ruby brown color with a 1 finger fairly dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with some moderate streaming carbonation. Aromas of raisin, plum, fig, pear, apple, light banana, caramel, toast, candi sugar, brown bread, light chocolate, clove, light pepper, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance and complexity of fruity/earthy yeast and balanced dark/bready malt sweetness; with solid strength. Taste of raisin, plum, fig, pear, apple, light banana, caramel, toast, biscuit, candi sugar, brown bread, light chocolate, clove, pepper, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Moderate amount of earthy yeast spiciness on the finish; with lingering notes of raisin, plum, fig, pear, apple, light banana, caramel, toast, biscuit, light chocolate, candi sugar, clove, pepper, herbal, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Nice complexity and robustness of dark/bready malt and fruity/spicy yeast ester flavors; with a nice malt/yeast flavor balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth and moderately slick/crisp mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with only a small warming present after the finish. Overall this is a nice dubbel. Good balance and complexity of fruity/spicy yeast and dark/bready malt flavors; and smooth to sip on for the ABV. A nicely enjoyable offering.","superspak","Apr 10, 2014"

The maltiness in this beer is way too much for the style and the alcohol taste is also distracting and way off the mark. This beer is also far too ""big"" for a dubbel: 9% ABV is probably from where most of the taste problems can be traced. Nonetheless, this is a darn good beer and is well worth the purchase, it's just that it is not the best example of a dubbel on the market.

The nose comprises brown sugar, dried maple sugar, light cardboard, a hint of dark fruits, and a twinge of banana peel. The taste brings in more of the same, with a stronger contingent of dark fruit and banana and a pervasive feeling of cardboard and old nuts. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a sorta/kinda slick feel. Overall, this dubbel just didn't do it for me. I'm hoping it's past its prime, considering the strange and unappealing flavors, but I have my doubts.","TMoney2591","Jul 24, 2013"

Pulling the beer right out of the fridge, the aroma is very muted, with hints of raisin. As the beer warms I get more hints of dark fruit, with figs and plums to go along with the raisin. There's some nice brown sugar sweetness in the background, almost like molasses. Very enjoyable, just from smell alone. Taste is very fruity, with that sweetness from the nose helping to balance things out in the end.

Spices are present once again in the background, and it tastes a bit like cinnamon. The flavors are unbelievably smooth and creamy, and the aftertaste is just that hint of spicing again.

There are the banana, spices and hint of honey thing in the flavor that are common for the style but they seem to get bossed around by too much of a grainy malt. As it warms the malts do step away somewhat but what seems to be left is something slightly lacking as far as a complexity as well as a little thin as far as the body is concerned too. One thing I did find interesting is that though the alcohol comes on quite strong in the scent it is hidden very well in the taste til you get almost to the very end.

There is a lot of alcohol and a burnt finish that shows up after the heat disappears. This beer is almost to complex. It would probably do well in a cellar for a little while (1 year max).

On the palate, though, it's more interesting, as things start with some tangy fruits before moving to some phenolic notes and then some sweet, smooth and nutty malts. Very smooth and well integrated. Mouthfeel is excellent for the style, with carbonation that effectively lightens things but otherwise doesn't assert itself. Overall, I'm impressed.

A few more sips in and the alcohol becomes more noticeable but it's not intusive, just warms my tummy a bit. It finishes on the semi sweet side and the aftertaste is on the short lived side.

The nose is ripe with vinous, juicy, dark fruit and soft yeast notes (it's clearly not the Chimay strain; but possible La Chouffe...) over a delicate, biscuity maltiness. It's gently effervescent on the tongue with a fine-bubbled, median carbonation; and its medium-light body flows almost silk-like across the palate once it warms. The flavor is almost exactly as the nose indicates it may be. It starts with a combination of dark fruit and malt; warms a little to reveal some sweeter character as well as some balancing alcohol and leafy hops; and finishes with a slap of alcohol, some drying bitterbess, and more leafy hops.","NeroFiddled","Jan 18, 2005"
