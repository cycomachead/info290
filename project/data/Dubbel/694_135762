3.39,-11.9,3.75,3.5,3.25,3.25,3.5,"The look is somewhat opaque medium brown, more akin to a Belgian dark ale vice the usual dubbel ale. The smell is somewhat mild, hardly distinctive in any way. The taste is where I'm most disappointed. Seems rather plain, and unremarkable. I'm not tasting any of the usual distinctive, Belgian style flavor, let alone any of the fig, date, raisin, and prune the label claims. If their intent was to make a mild beer, then they were successful. I was expecting way more flavor than this very mild brew. The mouthfeel is fine, no complaints there, but again, nothing special either. Overall I would have to rate this a big disappointment.","jspaner","Mar 25, 2015"

While not as potent or as deep as examples from Europe, this was a Dubbel that was true to form and bound to please nearly everyone. It did not taste like the other beers from Troegs and had I not seem the label on the bottle, I wouldn't have been sure who brewed it. Bright for this style, this was chewy and full enough to savor and something that I'd want to picked up again. Nice job by Troegs on this one!","JerzDevl2000","Mar 16, 2015"

This brew is stylistically flawed and they should be ashamed of themselves for releasing this to the public. There is no desirable belgian flavor to this which makes me think they totally bombed it on the fermenting temps. Taking a moment to read the label's description proves that this beer has not turned out the way they intended. "Raisin, fig, date, prune, toffee and chocolate" -nope, none of that is found is this though other examples of the dubbel style do so vibrantly.  Perhaps I got a bunk bottle/batch?
