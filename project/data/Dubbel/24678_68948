Aromas of big cherry, raisin, prune, pear, caramel, candi sugar, pepper, clove, toast, light chocolate, herbal, brown sugar, and yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of fruity/spicy yeast and malt notes; with good strength. Taste of cherry, raisin, prune, pear, caramel, toast, pepper, clove, candi sugar, light chocolate, molasses, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Lingering notes of dark fruits, caramel, toast, clove, pepper, light chocolate, candi sugar, molasses, herbal, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and complexity of fruity/spicy yeast and dark malt flavors; with a good malt/spiciness balance and zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth, lightly slick, and slightly syrupy mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a damn nice Belgian dark ale! All around good balance, complexity, and robustness of fruity/spicy yeast and malt flavors; and very smooth to drink. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Oct 14, 2013"

The beer is a lean easy drinker with a great saison-like lemon and ester character that is amped up by a healthy dose of dark fruit notes from either special-b malt or dark candi sugar.

The taste is very good, offering a bit of sugary (yet dark fruit based) sweetness over a slightly tart base. Yeast imparts just a bit of spiciness. Very well composed and tasty. The mouthfeel is medium-bodied and gently carbonated, and the drinkability is good. Overall, one of the most enjoyable Belgian-style beers I've had from the States. It stays away from the pitfalls of either too much spicy yeast flavors, or too much Candi sugar that too many American brewers of Belgian styles fall into.","shand","Mar 29, 2013"

Could use a little more sweet, plummy maltiness for balance, as it's a bit roasty. Still, not bad.","alexgash","Sep 30, 2011"
3.83,5.8,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,"dark brown color with this tin wispy head of off white that capped the top only for a slight time offering little in the way of side lacing. aroma of roasted malts, light smoke, and hints of chocolate, nice and warming, but lacked the punch i was looking for. flavor was more of the same, not bad at all, had all the right markers there with light peat, lots of chocolate, deep roasted profile, just too light for me to be honest. thin feel","mikesgroove","Sep 23, 2011"
3.82,5.5,3.5,4,4,3.5,3.5,"all in all, this is an interesting and impressive brew. it took me a while to warm up to the characteristics of this garnet hued gem, but once I did, wow. Impressive, interesting, and different. definitely wouldn't turn down another.","djeucalyptus","Sep 22, 2011"

3.98,9.9,4.5,4,4,3.5,4,"O: A good beer and one that is very drinkable. However, it just seems a little weak in all categories. I'm not looking for this beer to be a monster, but I also shouldn't have to search for the aroma and just as the flavor presents itself, it just falls off a cliff. With that, I did enjoy it quite a bit and I'd definitely have another.","Florida9","Beers"
3.39,-6.4,3,4,3,3.5,3.5,"Overall this is another Vivant beer that comes off as very ho-hum. I really want to visit the brewery and see what these beers are like on tap, but judging from the cans it seems that they have a lot of work to do if they want to be a quality Belgian style brewery.","zoso1967","0"
3.83,5.8,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Brewery Vivant did a pretty nice job with Solitude. It’s a pretty solid release all-around. It could be improved with a stronger nose and more of a Belgian yeast presence, but it’s pretty good as it is. For a recent upstart, Brewery Vivant is showing some promise. Keep it up, guys!","prototypic","Aug 31, 2011"
4.42,22.1,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Color me impressed...Dubbels are one of my very favorite styles and after reading some of the reviews on this website, I was a little skeptical so I didn't buy a 4-pack. I will gladly go back and get a few 4-packs. My only critique would be that the body is a little thin...perhaps if they adjusted their mash temp up a few degrees they could improve that.","Mitchster","Aug 17, 2011"
4.17,15.2,3.5,4,4.5,4,4,"Overall I thought this was pretty good beer. This is my first BDA, I usually go for the BSDA's but I really like how this is a little lighter and more drinkable version that still has a lot of flavor and makes for a good beer to drink on a cool summer night. I thought this beer was highly drinkable, it was flavorful, easy to drink, and the body was lighter. If I had another one I would drink it, a four pack would be great to take to a bonfire, lots of good flavor, but it won't fill you up. What I liked most about this beer was the flavor, the combination of mildly roasted malts and Belgian yeast was really nice and it kept me coming back for more. What I liked least about this beer was the appearance, the color was nice, but it lacked having a nice head, which most Belgians usually do. I will for sure be buying this again and I would recommend this to pretty much anyone, you got love a well done Belgian style beer in a can, it's just so wrong it's right. I really like the fact this comes in pint cans, makes itls easy to take outdoors with me, and you just don't see Belgians in cans, there is enough traditional Belgians in oddly shaped small bottles, bring on the pint cans. This made for both a good first impression of this brewery and of the Belgian Dark Ale style. I really liked this beer and I can't wait to try some of the other offerings from this brewery and more of this style. Good first impression for Brewery Vivant, you can bet I will be back for more.","StoutHunter","Jul 31, 2011"
3.36,-7.2,4,3,3.5,3,3.5,"Overall this is an alright beer. Not awful, but not really leaving me wanting more. Very easy to drink for a darker belgian ale. Will finish the few I have, but would probably never seek out again.","ahq514","Jul 26, 2011"
4.73,30.7,5,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,"The Crack & Glug in this instance was heavenly, producing two rocky fingers of deep-tan head with moderate retention. The inherent carbonation allowed the head to lead a rich, full life before moving on into the atmosphere. The color was more truth in advertising, although I might have said "garnet" or "ruby" as opposed to "mahogany", but the NE-quality clarity rendered it one to drop me to my knees in prayer for more such beautifully rendered beers. It was like a liquid Illuminated Manuscript. The nose was, indeed, malty, but with an earthen quality, like tobacco. The mouthfeel was full, rich and creamy with a slightly astringent sweetness, like a combination of tobacco and anise, on the tongue. I began to hear harps and trumpets in mine ears! I have to say that as it warmed, the earthy qualities really began to come out and I was reminded of a few earthy women in my life who would have really dug this sort of thing. They are the ones who are not hung up on body hair, shower or bathe only occasionally, belch and fart with the best of men and appeal to a certain segment of the male culture. I partook of them routinely until I donned the cloth and now I partake of them regularly as nothing seems to get them off like debauching a Brother. Finish was semi-sweet and I get where they are coming from with raisin and caramel but pear simply continues to elude me. I really liked this beer and would put it in my cooler any time of year, but especially if I were headed to a nude beach avec les maitresses du moine (with the monk's mistresses).","woodychandler","Jul 15, 2011"
3.48,-3.9,4,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"Drink- A nice little beer from the midwest. Not a stunner by any means but still rather tasty. It was a big box from Kzoobrew and trying to get through them all.","FosterJM","Jul 14, 2011"
