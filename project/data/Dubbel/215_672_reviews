"This had so much promise but it's bitter initial taste, after taste and insane amount of carbonation ruined any flavor that it hoped you would taste. I wanted to like this, especially with its Monk folklore. But it is simply unrefined and just... Monastic in the worst way."
"Appearance: Smell: fruity, some caramel and sherry notes, plum, spice. Taste: fruit, caramel and faint cola. Mouthfeel: This has a medium body with a creamy effervescence."
"750 ml bottle into signature chalice, bottled on 8/31/2013. Cork popped itself off when I uncaged it. Pours lightly hazy/cloudy reddish copper color with a 1 finger dense light khaki head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a large amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of raisin, plum, fig, pear, apple, pepper, caramel, brown sugar, toasted bread, light chocolate, light nuttiness, herbal, grass, and yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of fruity/spicy yeast and dark/bready malt notes; with good strength. Taste of big raisin, plum, fig, pear, apple, pepper, caramel, brown sugar, toasted bread, light nuttiness, light chocolate, herbal, grass, and yeast earthiness. Moderate amount of yeast spiciness on the finish; with lingering notes of raisin, plum, fig, pear, apple, pepper, caramel, brown sugar, toasted bread, light chocolate/nuttiness, herbal, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Incredible complexity and robustness of fruity/spicy yeast and dark/bready malt; with a great malt/yeast balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium body; with a very smooth and moderately creamy/bready mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming lingering after the finish. Overall this is an incredible dubbel style! All around awesome complexity, robustness, and balance of fruity/spicy yeast and dark/bready malt flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A highly enjoyable offering."

"Really good beer, but for the price there are some American versions of Dubbels that are better."

"Pours very cloudy. Aroma is nice but the taste is excellent. Lives up to its reputation"
"Perfection. The standard that others are held to."
""
""
""
""
""
"I am neutral on this beer."
"Haven't had a lot of Belgian Dubbels but I can see why people are so high on the Belgian stuff. At this point in my beer journeys I think it's the yeast that is used I really have come to enjoy from Belgians. Good stuff and when I get the chance I'll pick up the yellow and blue bottles."
"Wow. This is a very complex beer. I sampled it on tap at the Craft Beer Market in Calgary. It has a nice yeasty nose, caramel malt, and a fair amount of sweetness. This was my dessert beer and it suited the purpose nicely."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A great Belgium beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"Can definitely taste the water used in this one."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I don't think the flavors of this beer work together particularly well. When the flavors are subtle such as they are in this one I think a certain synergy is required to elevate the beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A really balanced beer. The heavier body hides the alcohol, it could be dangerous. My only knock is the metallic taste I got. It tasted like iron/blood. It wasn't always present, but even I got some it was not very appetizing."
""
""
""
""
"Great dubbel and better than their blue in my opinion.  The dark fruits & character come through nicely."
""
"Cheers!"
""
""
"Carbonated with a very faint taste. Alcohol is only present in the aftertaste. Mild and drinkable, but lacking flavor and spice."
""
"O: nice, but a little bit of a let down - expected more;"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O:  very nice dubble.  Hits many positive notes."
""
""
"O: not bad, but not worth the price IMO. Several American attempts at the style are far better."
"Chimay Red has a nice dark brown color and smells yeasty overall.  I didn't get much fruitiness in the taste.  The alcohol is present on the back end, and I like the carbonation on the tongue.  It has a nice medium body, but the aftertaste is a bit much for me.  I wouldn't want to drink this over and over, but once in a while, it's fine.  I prefer the Blue."
"o: spicy, fruity, and delicious"

"mouthfeel is great and overall one of the best beers I had."

"Overall: I like Belgian beers and the Chimay variants are right up there amongst my favourites. If you're looking for super-complex flavour profiles then you're probably in the wrong place but if you're looking to dip your toes into the complex waters of Belgian Trappist beers there are far worse places to start."
"This beer is OUTSTANDING!!!   It's in my top 10 of all time."

"  A style I sometimes run hot and cold with but Trappist Monks in Belgum are hard to argue with. ---- J"

"My video review https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVipWudOKUg"
""
""
""
"Review based on the BJCP2008 guidelines (style 18B). Bottle 33 cl - Batch L13-651. AROMA: complex aroma with malty caramely background and fruity aromas reminiscent of pinneaple and apricot. hop aromas absent. APPEARANCE: semi-dark copper with material in suspension. medium ivoey head with average retention. TASTE: flavour less rich than the aroma with mild sweet caramel notes. low apricot notes. low bitterness with a medium-dry finish. PALATE: medium body with medium carbonation. OVERALL: a dubbel with very nice aromas but, alas, not so complex flavours."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: quite a nice Dubbel, but certainly not the best I have had. I'd rather prefer a Grimbergen or a St Feuillien, the latter of which is also AU$100 a case compared to Chimay's $150. Easy choice."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall 4.0: Excellent beer overall, but I feel that there are better Dubbels on the market.  Don't get me wrong, I would not turn this beer down, I just do not feel that a bomber of it is worth over $10 US, which is what it is going for in some places."
""
"This is a super high quality beer.  Perfect in every way. Complex tastes."

"Great presentation.  Comes out a bit darker than expected, a little hazy, but looks solid.  Taste is a little sweet with some bitterness.  Goes down smooth but stays with you in the end.  Reminds me of a nice caramel flavor along with hints of fruitiness."

"Overall - This beer looks and smells better than it tastes and feels.. It is not bad but for the style it is not the best you will ever come across and for my money I feel Westmalle do it better by a clear country mile."

"Overall: This brew gave me goosebumps when I popped its top. This brew is sweet yet refined so its not cloying  sweet. The nuttiness adds a level to the brew making it more hearty that works well with the fruitiness and the oats. The dryness also makes the brew easy to drink, aching you for another gulp. There's nothing negative I can really say about this brew. Don't take my word for it, try it for yourself. This brew is Recommended."

"O- A great example of the style and easy to find. I prefer Chimay Blue to the Red but this hits the spot for a great Belgian dubbel."

"O – A wonderful, solid beer, and even though it seems a bit obvious, a great example of the dubbel style.  It isn’t flashy, isn’t overwhelming; just very, very good, and worth coming back to over and over."

"Overall- A true Belgian. It is of good quality and is pretty complex. Not outstanding but still smooth."
""
""
"Pours a deep copper with a beautiful loose,thick beige head that dissipates to a film on the top after a couple of minutes. Apricots, slight clove and bready yeast ride the forefront of the bouquet with a hint of booziness in there somewhere. A long sip led to a smooth, unctuous mouthfeel filled with sweet dried fruit, great unfiltered yeast and a sweetness I can't put my finger on, non bitter chocolate? With an abv. of 7% there is an aftertaste of alcohol but not over powering by any means. A great beer."

"This beer is fresh and soft. There is no sweetness. It is completely fermented… it’s has a fruity feeling like a South African dry Riesling, I’m not sure if this is the autolyzed yeast for a spice in the ingredients. It has a great dry wine taste at the end. Nothing like the American cascade hops… the bitterness I would interpret as dryness, it has a very wine feeling that would seem more than only the 7% that it is."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Great beer. Best to appreciate on its own without food."
"Overall: A really wonderful beer. Delicious. Everything I've had from this brewery is really pretty exceptional. I prefer the Première over the Chimay Tripel, but I still like the Grande Réserve the best. Now I just need to hop on over to Belgium to try the Dorée."

"Update: 7/17/14, Forgot I had half a growler(alcohol abuse!!), cracked it open, still had carbonation, head obviously not as pronounced, but still one finger….It still tasted great. Something to be said for the craft beer, bottle conditioned Belgian stuff!!!"

"Tasty, refreshing, easy to drink and very well balanced Dubbel. Not tiresome complex, actually quite versatile, you can drink this cold or warm, lay back or sensory hunting. The big bottle for this one is not to be shared."

"O - Very tasty and very drinkable. Overall a solid Dubbel."
""

""
"O- Best strong beer, but, not the top trappistes beer."

"I hope maybe I just got a bad or old bottle, because otherwise I can't see the rating being so high for this one."

"Overall, I am not really into Dubbels but if I had to drink one this would be it. It is certainly a sweeter beer than I normally drink and is almost liquid candy. I can see why many call this the gold standard of Dubbels."
""
""
"O-Overall it's the standard that has been set for dubbel."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I think I would have had different experience witha different bottle. I noticed that it was bottled in May 2012, and while I have heard that you are supposed to age these beers you can overage them. I think a fresher bottle would have given me better results. Maybe next time I can get a different feel on this brew."

"Just enough bitterness late to even all the sweet fruit. Alcohol doesn't hurt in that regard either. Much preferred over the blue IMHO."
""
""
""
" Bubbly and fizzy on the tongue, but taste was somewhat average with malty, caramel and some clove-like spice mixed in, but very faint. I was expecting to be ""wowed"" with it's almost legendary quality, but it's just ""very good"". I drove 22 miles to find it, but I won't go to that trouble again."
""
""
""
"O - Not my normal style of beer but this is excellent. Very drinkable, and very tasty. I have been meaning to try this one for a long time, and just never ended up picking it up. Not something I would buy on a regular basis, but I will probably buy again. Very good beer."

"DATE TASTED: February 10, 2014... GLASSWARE: Chimay 150th anniversary goblet...OCCASION: PSU/Illinois Sunday... APPEARANCE: dark mahogany body; thick, creamy off-white head that clings to the glass; cascading lacing... AROMA: bright, aromatic hops; some apple and pear bake in a soft, doughy aura; some ginger or allspice as well...PALATE: almost light-bodied, dry, and beguilingly drinkable presence; smooth and inviting...TASTE: grape, grapefruit, and soft pine resin--soft, pleasant, after-dinner cordial warmth; slightly acidic... OVERALL: revisiting the first beer to make me say, ""Whoa," Keanu style--and the beer does not disappoint to create a drinking experience where the beer IS the moment...the Chimay family grows in strength, but the opener in the sampler outperforms most other breweries' ""first-ups by a long shot with drinkability and strength to spare..."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Pretty good. I'd recommend it, especially if you like the style. I'd say it's above average for the style."
""
"D: This is a decent Belgian Dubbel with some nice and easy drinkability. Definitely starts off strong but tends to fall apart at the seams for me. Good but not great."
"Drinkability: Subtle, contemplative. I like it as well as any other dubbel. In some ways, so far, I may give the edge to white, red, blue in that order, but it's l always love the one I am with."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"750 ml bomber served in Chimay goblet, Dark Amber with a two finger off-white head with not a lot of lacing. Aromas, sweet maltiness, candy sugar, Raisins, Fruit, Caramel. The taste is very similar to the nose it's very complex and beautifully balanced! Mouthfeel creamy medium bodied with high carbonation. The ABV is hidden well!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: As a straight-up dubbel/BSDA, it doesn't hit me the same way Rochefort 8 did. It's far from bad, don't get me wrong, but I'm kind of nonplussed here. This is probably on the lower end of quality in terms of trappist ales."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Outra cerveja que eu acho menosprezada pelos especialistas. Mas na minha visão, trata-se de uma cerveja de coloração linda, bom aroma e ótima presença gustativa. Um rótulo da Chimay que me surpreendeu nas duas experiências que tive com ela, principalmente na versão rolha."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: solid dubbel, maybe a bit too bitter on the finish, but fans of malt and apple may find this ideal"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Very enjoyable. This came as a small bottle as part of a gift pack, and by the end of it I was definitely looking around for more. The price on the bomber size is a little higher than I would normally spend, but this beer is good enough for me to at least consider it. Looking forward to the Tripel and Quad!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Very good beer. Bold sweet malt smooth taste. My favorite of the Chimay’s. Has the right amount of ABV."
""
"Picked up a Christmas sampler with chimay chalice. Poured a cloudy dark amber color with 1/2 inch of caramel head. Head dissipated quickly with minimal lacing. The aroma is characteristic Belgian in nature with hints of banana. The taste has a yeast/malt initial flavor with an astringent mineral finish. Nice carbonated full mouthfeel. Overall an above average beer, but there are other Belgian style beers I would drink before this."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"OVERALL: This is the best Dubbel I have ever had, it's a little pricey compared to other beers available but I don't care. Plus, all the proceeds go to charity. I can drink beer and help others? Yea, sign me up again...I will definitely have this beer again and would recommend to anyone who enjoys the Dubbel style."
"Amber reddish hue with a half inch of small, tightly compacted light brown foam. I see a lot of busy carbonation bubbles. I get caramel,Belgian candy sugar,and Belgian yeast in the nose. Mouthfeel is dry and there's almost a mineral aspect and yet it is somewhat creamy despite that! The flavor is biscuity malt,dark Belgian candy sugar,and Belgian yeast. There's a slight tartness to the finish with the year."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured from a 330 ml bottle into a genuine Chimay chalice. This iconic dubbel is a reddish-orange hue, less dark that one's Trappist beer schema might dictate, with a massive light tan head that retains form quite well. Smells like dried dark fruit (figs and dates), sweet white bread, cola-like brown spices, and a little cellar musty character. Palate is sweet, herbal, spicy, somewhat medicinal ... Clove and nutmeg spicy phenols, some wintergreen or birch beer herbal character, treacle, light chocolate, hints of citric fruitiness, and an earthy spice that reminds one of ginseng root. Body not terribly thick and the brew is quite bubbly, which provides an interesting contrast to the dark and rich flavors. Finish includes some hop resin, booze, and further spicy, earthy notes. Not roasted or toasty. This was my very first Trappist brew, sampled years ago in graduate school, and I am happy that it still hit that sweet spot for a guy whose taste buds have been plastered by double IPAs and stronger Belgian ales. Younger examples may include more banana flavor from yeast esters ... This one (minimum two years old) was less fruity."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The beer's booze is well masked, the mouthfeel creamy and smooth, making the beer easy-drinking. Still, there's a lot of complexity here and this beer is one that I want to sip, enjoy and contemplate. I'm mad at myself for not drinking more of this given that it's so easy to find."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - a nice treat, but I wouldn't spend the extra dough when I could get better quality at a better value."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours dark brown with two fingers of off-white head that dissipates quickly. Right after pouring you can hear the carbonation and feel it on your nose, just like a soda. The nose has an over-ripened plum, cherry, and raisin characteristic to it with the bready malt and candied sugar smells that are common in Trappiste ales. It tastes surprisingly low-key with some bread malt up front, an earthy quality throughout, and a sweet finish with no big fruit notes like the nose has. It feels pretty light-bodied and watery even with the high carbonation. Still a very good dubbel."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Ok, what can I possibly say about Chimay that hasn't already been said before? Is it the finest beer I've ever tried? No, but definitely a standard to be measured by. This one was poured from an 11.2 oz bottle into a Chimay chalice (seemed appropriate). Wonderful aroma and head. Amazingly smooth beer that is easily put down. My honey-bunny says it makes her nipples hard and that's good enough for me. Cheers!"

""
""
"O - Still a great beer after all these years, and it's even more refreshing than I remembered it."
""
"Very malty and smooth with a slight bitterness way on the back of the tongue that lingers a bit. Creamy texture and a marvelous pillow head that receded quickly but remained right on the surface of the liquid. Very pretty, a dark cloudy ruby red that's nice to look at... but even better to drink."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured from a bottle. A luxurious head with an lively column of bubbles. The taste is mainly roasty/toasty but not very sweet. There is practically no hops in the flavor profile. The body was perfect and the carbonation was appropriate for this style."
""
""
""
""
"O: A very very nice beer. Very high on my dubbel list."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Sharper, yet less flavorful than Cinq Cent, and quieter than Grande Reserve on every level. The flavor potential bubbling beneath the surface seems to miss its cue and tries to come out out through the mouthfeel instead. There is quality to be appreciated, but the vigor normally attributed to this style is lacking."
""
""

"With my new chalice here, I can make the perfect beer/glassware combination. Boom. Just as nature intended. This stuff pours a mostly clear ruby-sienna topped by a half-finger or so of sandstone foam. The nose comprises raisins, figs, rich caramel, Belgian candi sugar, and a smattering of clove. The taste brings in more of the same, along with a definite vein of dark fruits, a swirl or two of cinnamon, and a sprinkle of ginger. The body is a stolid medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a mostly fluid feel. Overall, a damn solid dubbel, a clear classic of the style. Not much else to say than that."

"Overall: I can't believe it took me this long to discover the greatness that is Chimay. Honestly I'm embarrassed. I'm already aging a Blue Chimay...Don't think this one needs any aging so get your hands on it as soon as you can!"

"Poured from a bottle into a chalice, the beer is a dark, hazed, almost opaque amber coloring with a frothy, light, yellowish head that settles in around a quarter of an inch. Steady flow of carbonation throughout. Aromas of bready backbone with a rich date and fig sweetness, tart apple highlights, and some spicy notes. Very balanced aromas. Flavors are smooth and roasty, with an apple and date sweet backbone, some cinnamon and all spice, and a slight warmth from the ABV. Extremely well balanced. The aftertaste has more of a fruit bread character to it, with sweetness and richness balanced together. Robust, full body kept light by the carbonation. Smooth, slightly warming finish that beckons you back again and again. Delicious."

"While this wasn't as strong, I could feel the booze in it by the time I finished off the bottle. I can't imagine that anyone would be disappointed by this but at the same time, there's not a whole lot in here to love. this is a solid beer that's one of the best of its kind, given what we are able to access here in North America. This is possibly one of the most accessible beers of its category, given the mild carbonation, clean finish, and lack of sourness from start to finish, though the alcohol in here was the strongest aspect of this from start to finish."

"Brewed by Belgium monks, this is one of the finest beers in the world. Expensive but definitely worth it, this beer has an incredibly complex flavor. This beer, also known as the most expensive beer on the Bernie's passport ($10), is very fancy, very delicious and very out of my normal price range"
"O: Overall, this is the highlight of my day. Of course I had high expectations and they were met. It's expensive but for a good reason, I was drinking this quicker than I do most beers, It's just so smooth and fulfilling, I couldn't help myself, finished the whole 750ml. Defiantly recommended to everyone."
""
"I rarely include the issue of price in my reviews, but I think that I must mention it here. While this offering is very good, it is definitely short of exceptional and unique. The price point, however, would indicate that it is the later. I am just not feeling the love for Chimay Red that much when there are many other exceptional beers that are significantly cheaper."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: My first Chimay, very drinkable and sweet. Will be buying more for sure. I like it a little more than the Westmalle and Trappiste dubbels, will def be buying again. Can't wait to try yellow and blue. If you're new to trappist beer, this would probably be the best starting point. Monks know how to brew great beer, and while I would still prefer a Rochefort 10, this is more sessionable and can easily hold it's own in the complexity and flavor department. Any avid beer drinker should give this a try."

"light and pleasant. not a lot of strong flavors but pleasant w subtlety. it's like a watered-down version of the tripel (that sounds more negative than it's meant). the bottle ref a lil bitterness, but i dont taste it. didnt think id enjoy it because the tripel is so hard to beat, but it was nice. i would buy again."
"O: Excellent beer, one of the best representatives of the Dubbel style, second only to Westmalle."

"A lovely, sophisticated, restrained brew."

"Well balanced and robust, this beer is a pleasure to drink - even for someone who wouldn't always choose this particular style."

"Lovely beer."
""

"Poured into a chalice this brew initially has 3 fingers of large bubbled tan head which breaks down rather quickly with no lacing. Ruddy and light brown but with more of a red tint than the other trappist dubbels. Aromas of estery Belgian yeast-fruity apricot. Typical dubbel malt aroma-sweet and heavy on the malt bill. Taste is all dubbel. Malty, quite yeasty and fruity with a dry finish. Light on the sweet dried fruit that should be present but it is definitely detectable. Mouthfeel is a bit more carbonated than most dubbels and lighter in malt backbone. Perhaps a touch more bitter aftertaste and slightly less sweet than Westmalle's version. Super easy to drink with lots of character. A great beer."
"O - After doing another back to back tasting with grande reserve I actually like this one more at this moment because of the nice fruity notes."

"Poured from a brown 25.4 oz. bottle. Has a pretty bronze color with reddish hues and a 1 inch head. Smell is of fruits, malts, some yeast. Taste is fruits, alcohol, malts, spice, yeast, tasty and complex. Feels full bodied in the mouth and overall, while I wasn't blown away by it, a solid beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Good beer, but not as good as I had hoped. Too much sweetness/stickiness, though the caramel taste is nice."
""
""
" Chimay Rouge is a refined, classic take on the style, but a bit underwhelming. The balanced, demure flavor profile is tasty, but there are certainly better Dubbels available from Belgian as well as American brewers."
""
"Chimay Red is a classic Trappist ale, but I was disappointed by the flavor profile, which was quite subdued and contained unpleasant metallic notes. I far prefer both the Blue and the White to this."

"A beer on the sweeter side, but offers complex flavors from beginning to end. Subtle use of hops allows the bubblegum, banana and yeast to pervade. Highly enjoyable and drinkable."
""
""
""
"O: I was disappointed quiet frankly. I expected much bolder flavors. They were there that's for sure but nothing that really excited me. Nothing was to strong in this beer and really made me go ""wow"". I probably wouldn't buy this again."

"This is the last of the three Chimay varities from my gift pack. I waited a while to drink it since Belgian ales aren't a style that I really like. For me this was the best of the three Chimays. Appearance is a nice dark burgundy color, head was a little less powerful than I thought it would be. Smell is of spices mainly, which isn't a smell I particularly like in beer. Taste is the most enjoyable of the Chimay beers, not overly spiced or too strong, and smoother than the rest. Well, I tried about 4 styles of Beligians and still haven't become fond of them, I guess it'll be a fairly long while until I try another one."
""
""
""
""
""
"Chimay makes seem so effortless, what an exceptionally example of fine ingredients combined in perfect proportions. The end result is a fine brew, suitable for any occasion. Pleasant caramels married to those uniquely fine Belgian malts. Beautiful well defined head, pours lightly and lingers as the enjoyment of beer well done makes each sip more pleasurable than the last. It's not cheap, and you'd expect great and your wishes will not unmet, enjoy a real winner."

"Served on tap at Hellhunt Pub in Tallin, Estonia. Paid €3.50. What a deal. I can see why people spend over $13 in the U.S. for it. Exceptional beer that exemplifies the style. I will gladly pay the price back in the U.S. for this brew. Again to reiterate, if you can afford the airfare Estonia is probably the place to go in Northern Europe for awesome beer at Bud Lt. price!"

"Food pairing - I paired this with a sweet glazed chicken and a terriaki pork and both of these did not work with this beer. I hope to dry chili next which I think will work very well, will let you all know."

"Poured from 11.2 oz bottle into Chimay chalice at The Real Pickle in Shreveport, LA. Pours a hazy brown with some off white lacing. Great dried fruit and malt aroma. Taste is amazing...typical trappist notes; dried fruit, caramel, malts, smoooth as hell. A superb brew, lots of complexity. What else can be said about this brew that the last 2000k+ reviews havent said...I just cant believe it took me this long to review it."
""
"I'm always going to drink this beer. From time to time, anyway. But the more I drink the Belgian/trappist ales, the more I realize I've got to be more prepared for that muted wine taste to properly enjoy the style. Bottom line: It's good. Expensive, yes, but pretty damn good."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-For me, this dubbel drinks a lot like a tripel, which is not a bad thing. As is often the case with a true Belgian, the yeast is really the star here, and it nicely showcased against a mild maltiness and a warming alcohol to good effect. This brew is a bit rustic and not as well integrated as some, but the flavors layer nicely on one another and produce, in the end, a pretty solid beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: It kinda reminds me of a ""Dunkelweis"" beer. Like the Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier Dunkel. It's not as sweet as the smell suggest. It's similar somehow to St. Bernadus flavor types of the 8 and 12 etc, but without the sweet en depth. Making it refreshing. But there's something missing to give it that edge and uniqueness. It's nice, but not great."
""

"I wasn't incredible impressed with this beer the first time or two I had it. This last time, however was a little different. I had a bottle that I had been aging for about three years. I took it to a beer release with a buddy of mine. Wow, what a difference three years made. It was incredibly smooth and had some real depth of flavor. I think I will pick up a couple more of these to age. I love the Chimay Blue fresh...but after tasting this aged...might have to try aging the Blue also."

"Pours reddish cola brown with big foamy white head. Aroma is sweet caramel and roasted, bready malts; some spiciness like ginger snaps. Taste is sweet caramel malts, raisin, spices of cinnamon and light clove. Medium, lightly sweet malts with dry and tart yeasty notes. Great sweetness, but not too sweet with perfect amount of carbonation yielding to a beautiful dry finish. Amazingly refreshing, superlatively balanced, complex and satisfying."

"Bottle poured at Stubbies in Gainesville. Pours dark with a thick creamy head. Aroma of dark fruits, fig, plum, belgian yeast. Flavor follows with a burst of fruit, plums and figs are prominent, with a nice sweet candy sugar feel and some dryer yeast. This has a heavy mouthfeel, especially for a dubbel. Bit of booze, but in a good way that accents the heavy fruit nicely. World class brew, rivaling the Blue."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a cloudy deep reddish amber color with a decent off white head that dissipates rather quickly. Smells of caramel and chocolate up front with a fair amount of fruity and sweet maltiness. Light pepper and yeasty esters provide balance as the hop aroma is just about non existent. The flavor is sweet with lots of caramel and dark sugars with a fair amount of dark dried fruits. Prunes and raisins mixed with a bit of pepper and other assorted yeastiness. Medium body with a spirited level of carbonation and a sweet bubbly mouthfeel. I love the flavor, and the aroma isn't half bad either. For my personal taste the carbonation level is a bit high and makes the mouthfeel a bit too bubbly. Minor annoyance to my palette in an otherwise fantastic beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"O-very flavorful and drinkable dubbel that is readily available"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I got a faint smell of malts and bread. The taste was more of the same along with a little bit of sweetness. I kept waiting for a more powerful flavor to come out as the beer warmed but it never happened. Even if the beer wasn't as bold as I hoped, if it was easy drinking, I could find a place for something like this but it just didn't go down that smooth either. I know this beer isn't overly expensive but it costs more than what I would be willing to pay for it so I most likely won't be drinking it again anytime soon."

"Chimay beers are always highly rated by virtually everyone and this is no different."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Very good, classic representation of the style."
""
""
"It pours a ruddy caramel-raisin color with tight foam. The aroma has some cherries and raisin hints. There’s a noticeable sharpness on the flavor, with a hop bitterness I had not expected, yet it finishes smoothly. I get dark stone-fruits and a bit of the candied raisins and plums emerge. A desert beer that warms well."
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Good Belgian Dubbel, but like the Chimay Blue, probably not worth the high asking price."
""
""
"Overall this is a really enjoyable beer, very balanced. Not a taste-bomb but more subtle and complex. Very good for the style."
""
""
""
""
"Food match: Easy to savour with a hearty game stew, or a rare Scotch eye fillet of beef with a side of celeriac mash, roast asparagus, wilted kale and Chimay Rouge jus. Could even work desserts as well, this is indeed a great between courses brew, such as sticky toffee pudding, or clafoutis with liquor cream."
"Another solid product out of Belgium, here. May not be the best, but it's certainly worth a try, and something I wouldn't pass up if offered. Highly complex, but right on the money."

"Always a suprise to see stuff of this calibre in some macro place that you wouldnt expect and pours a hazed orange light copper hue with a creamy two finger head and a rim of lacing,the smell is burnt toffee,caramel,fruitcake,pecans and raisins,the mouthfeel is full bodied with moderate carbonation and has tastes of marzipan,caramel,toffee,candied figs,cherries,port and finished with a herbal berry warm bittersweetness and overall its very drinkable while having lots of character and hiding its ABV very nicely."

"O: Pretty decent dubbel. Malty, mellow...almost to the point of blandness but I find this to be fairly typical of a lot of dubbels. Smooth and very drinkable, however. It gets a pass."

""
"This one is a very solidly-built, by-the-books dubbel."
"I still cant decide if I like what the chimay yeast strain does to the beers. I like them in that they remind me of certain wines (through the mustyness), but this obscures flavors that i like in some of my more favorite dubbels... Certainly a complex beer no matter what way you cut it though. Definitely recommended."
"Overall - One of the best beers out there. Dont fear the price tag, it must be drank"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O-Given the global notoriety of Chimay, it is continuously remarkable that their product is unequivocally world class. A true lesson in brewing."

"O: Good intro to trappist. Very clean beer. Had this with seafood and cheese and found that it cleaned up the mouth very well."
""
"The red cap Chimay is not my favourite Trappist, though it may be the best Dubbel I have had so far. Either way, it shines as an experience worth repeating. If you see this anywhere and you have time to spare I would recommend picking it up and taking the time to enjoy it."

"O: Tasty dubbel. Nothing surprising or out of the ordinary, but rich with traditional belgian characteristics."
"One of the first Trappist ales I ever tried, if not the first. I'm more of a hop guy as opposed to malt, but even though this doesn't fit that aspect I appreciate it every time I revisit it."
"O/D-Have enjoyed this before quite a while ago. A pleasant Dubbel. One of the classics. I don't find it to be amazing, but its good."

"O: This tartlet is sip-able, cookable and a dream to look at with lovely drawn back hop that melts into a roasty, meaty malt and belgian yeast that isn't afraid of its fruity aspects. All around sweet heart of a beer."

"O - A very flavorful, complex dubbel. Excellent balance and high drinkability. One of the best examples of the style. It's always a pleasure to sip and enjoy a Chimay red."

"Final Thoughts: This was the first Trappist beer I have tried. I thoroughly enjoyed the experience and will be trying the other Chimay offerings. Although there is a lot of hype concerning 'Trappist' beers, Chimay Premiere does a good job of living up to it's reputation. I'm not the biggest fan of wheat beers or hefeweizens, but the average beer enthusiast should enjoy this one."

"Overall: A wonderful example of the style. Give this a shot if you are just getting started into Belgian Ales."
""
""

"Very effervescent, mildly warming, generally clean and dry with a light body."

"O- this is an elegant, subtle and wonderful brew. A pleasure to sip and savor."

"The beer pours a yellowed brown like properly aged hay, and sits a nice deep amber brown, with a deeper milk chocolate brown at its center. The beer pours with a great brown sugar-white head that’s bouncing with bubbles and dissipates swiftly, leaving a little thin lacing that runs down the sides of the glass. It smells like day old cooked bread, not especially pungent, but not a terrible smell, rich in biscuitiness and yeasty character. There is even a suggestion of subtle spices in the corners of the smell, along with a slight sweet kick that suggests the candy sugars in the beer. It tastes like a loaf of liquefied brown bread, and soft with candy sugars. There is also a slight hint of brown sugar and an after linger that reminds me of stale honeydew melons. Mouthfeel is very thick and smooth, with an odd harshness on the top of the tongue which sits oddly with the rest of the beers smoothness. The carbonation bubbles fiercely in the initial rush, but quickly peters out on the tongue, providing most but not all of that initial roughness. Overall this a nice sugary bread beer, easily palatable with a little too fierce of a carbonation but some nice after flavors in the mouth."

"Poured from 11.2 ounce bottle into tulip glass with great expectation. The brew was a slightly reddish amber color and had a creamy off-whit head that dissipated quickly. There was a malty and slightly honey sent that was pleasant, not awesome. The beer had a little sweet, malty, spicy, citrus flavor and had a mild hop feel. This is a good beer. At $7/six pack it would have really been remarkable. Unfortunately, it cost nearly $7/bottle leading to expectation not realized."

"I hate that I dont like this one, but it just doesnt do it. In a Dubbel, I want sweet dark fruits and balance (like westy 8), but all I get it this yeast bomb."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: It's a solid dubbel, but it's not the top of the line. Definitely a solid intro to the style, but pulls up a little too sweet and lacks some necessary body. Worth checking out."

"Just ok. Less depth than many other examples of the style."

"As I said in my review of the blue I liked all three of the Chimays. Butthebluewas definitely my personal favorite. I know that you want thes reviews done a certain way but due to my MS some times my taste buds are a bit inactive and I can't give you a great description on what I taste. And other times my taste buds are over active and I will be able to detect things most people cannot. So I will do my best with what I have to work with."

"O: This is a pretty easy drinking beer and gets even easier as it warms up and there is additional sweetness. The presence of alcohol is faintly there in the smell but well hidden in the taste. A very good example of the style and one I have been drinking for a number of years (and likely will continue to drink)."

"Poured into a chalice. Pours reddish brown with a finger length white head. The head dissipates, but does not disappear completely. The aroma is of sweet dark roasted malt, yeast, and dark fruits. The flavor is bready and sweet. The malt, yeast, brown sugar, and some dark fruit come through in the taste. It's not overly sweet and some faint hop bitterness comes in on the back end to help balance it. The body is medium and the carbonation provides crispness to the beer. It has a dry finish. This is an excellent dubbel and one I'd recommend."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel is very pleasant- medium body with refreshingly crisp carbonation. Not sparkly but fuzzy if that makes sense. Good beer- not one I'll go for again but a worthy purchase."
""
"Review from 3/2011 notes. Poured into a Black Raven pint glass. Pours a cloudy red orange amber with a thick head and light lacing. Well carbonated. Spicy malt and light fruit aroma. Taste is low-key, sweet malt, light fruit, a touch of carmel. Finishes with malt, fruit and a bit dry. A pleasant, but somewhat understated dubbel. I'd probably go for the blue over this. Still, nicely made and presented."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Not as good as I was expecting, but still above average overall. I need to try this again, because that metallic flavor at the end really has me thinking this is a bad bottle."

"O - This was surprisingly light. It was not as robust as I was expecting, but it's enjoyable."
"O-this is delicious. I have not had much in this style but this blew my mind. I will definitely be having this one again. I have delayed buying because of the price but this is worth every penny."
"O: This is a pretty solid trappist beer. Not the best ive had (see rochefort 6, 10... and westmalle.) Still crazy good in comparison to other beers. The intense complexity of this beer is what makes it stand out. Must be drank at cellar temperatures, or all beauty is lost on a ruined, numbed palate."
""
""
"O: Perfect. These beers have such a paramount reputation. Luckily the beer stands up to them. Fantastic. Will buy again."
"O: It’s been several years since I’ve had this. It was very drinkable and a good showcase for Belgian yeast flavors. Admittingly, Dubbels are not one of my favorite styles. I’ve also got the White and Blue so I’ll be very interested to see how this compares."
"This is a very good beer. Its very nice looking and has some complex flavors. A beer I will enjoy again."

""

"A light brown with with a ruby hue to it and a big off-white head that takes its time settling down. Very nice aroma of the belgian yeast, some roasted malt, fruit, a little hops, and a touch of alcohol. Flavor is very very nice. The belgian yeast, roasted malt,some fruit, and a touch of hops that holds everything together. A touch of alcohol was present. Medium bodied and active mouthfeel. Call me crazy but this is my favorite from Chimay and my favorite Belgium beer."

"Although this beer may lack some of the complexity of the blue, and maybe be a little less dark and rich as some other Dubbels, what it does have is some vibrancy in the form of a lovely fruitiness. There are very pleasant notes of apricot jam, some red apple, a bit of breadiness, and some late mild bitterness. The whole package is fairly straightforward, but has an appealing freshness to it. The typical Belgian yeast notes are present, but more subdued than you would expect. Very light notes of banana and clove, and in exchange you get the brighter fruit notes. Pours a chestnut color, with fairly good clarity unless you swirl the yeast into the glass. At 7% abv, this is a nice alternative to the higher abv blue as well. Nice, as always."

"O: I've never been a fan of Chimay really, except for perhaps the White. This beer just exudes lackluster. The flavors and aroma are muddled and weak, and I'm detecting some bizarre things that seem off (a bit of seafood on the finish? I must be crazy...). By far my least favorite Trappist brewery, though it might be a good intro to Belgian beers for those who don't want something too bold."

""
""
""
"O - Really good easy to find Belgian dubbel."
"The fruity character from the smell carries over in the taste. A metallic element pops out at the finish along with some dryness. Medium carbonation and body."
""
""
""
"For me, Chimay Premiere is the pinnacle of beer. I would say its contribution extends to having influenced the style for many generations and helped spawn the amazing variety of exceptional quality beers we see today. Standing on the shoulders of the Chimay giant!"
""
""
""
""
"Pours a ruddy orange-brown with little lacing and retention. Aromas of malt and dark fruit prevail with a touch of apple and brown sugar on the nose. Fairly strong spice notes as well. The ale is spicy and bitter from start to finish which helps to mask the medicinal flavor. Phenols are readily apparent, and I lose the complex flavor amongst the fairly heavy spice and bitterness. The sweet aroma helps to balance the bitter after taste. The medium carbonation feels dry on the palate. The beer is good from start to finish, but for me it doesn’t live up to the hype. It’s slightly above average. For me the Chimay Grande Reserve is much smoother and more enjoyable."
"O: Classic Belgian Dubbel – nicely balanced and easily drinkable."

"o - per chimay's recommendation, definitely best drunk slightly chilled to experience all of its flavors. a very pleasant beer that brings out the best in the belgian dubbel style. sweet and malty, plenty of spice, such easy drinkingm and i remembered how i fell in love with beer traveling around amsterdam and brussels with my brother. cheers, harland!"
""
""
""

"Taste-Belgian spicy yeast, fruity, clove, earthy hops. Very effervescent and perfectly balanced. A classic, classy beer that would be very welcome at the dinner table."

""
""
""
""

"Seems like this was not as impressive as the first time I tried it. I may need to revisit this one in the future and see if maybe this bottle was off."
"O: good beer, though it definitely needs to be served chilled as it the flavors are not as prominent as it warms up."
"pours a bright copper color with a fine bubbly belgian head. smells woody, yeasty, and slightly fruity. dried fruits in the flavor tart a bit perhars like cranberries or bing cherries, green apples even. floral hops gently appear in the flavor as well, but the yeast is the star here for me, slightly sour but very round in the finish. mouthfeel is great, like all chimay brews its lively and drinkable. this is not what i think of when i think of a dubbel, its lighter and more fruity than many examples of the style, but it is a very well made beer, and one that im sure ill purchase again."

"O: a really wonderful representation of the style, loved every aspect of it except the awkward bubble popping"
""
""
""
""
""
"O-Excellent dubbel, great balance and flavor."
""
""
""

"D - While this dubbel is light in flavor and doesn't pack a lot of intensity, it's incredibly easy to drink. Just a very solid brew overall, and one I'm sure I'll be drinking many times in the future. Good stuff, but not quite great."
""
""

"O - It drinks easy, and is pretty approachable."

"O. Very nice dubbel. Maybe a litte bit more flavor would set it apart from some of the other top Dubbels. Mouthfeel is good, but also a touch lacking. Thats all just comparing Chimay Red to the other top beers in this category. This is a very good beer."
""
""
""
""

"Overall: A great dubbel the balance is stellar, love the pilsner malt finish. Overall a fantastically flavorful and drinkable beer."

"Drink- This wasn't as good as I remember. A bit thinner and missing that full bodied spicy dubbel taste. Ill probably come back to this one but not anytime soon."
""
""
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel is medium thin, not a really long finish either."
""
""
"O: Creamy, tart and delicious, this should be at the top when considering a Dubbel."

"This is definitely NOT my style, but if I had to drink a Dubbel, it would probably be this one. Not a ringing endorsement, I know, but this is a pretty good beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - i was hoping for more character. It is very subdued. It is very easy to drink and is enjoyable."
""
"Beautiful dark molasses color with nice aroma of dark fruits and wheat. However when you taste, the dark fruits really struggle to come through and make their way to your taste buds. Therefore you are left with more of a spicy flavor of cloves and ginger. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and finishes with a crisp earthy finish. After recently having the Rochefort 8, I find this Chimay to be a little bit of a let down but still a solid Dubbel."

"Chimay Rouge is one of my favorites due to all of the different sides that it takes. It manages to be sweet yet still hold a bitter end. It's very malty yet diverse in fruitiness. It's thick in body yet dangerously easy to drink. The alcohol level is just right, as well. Have I had more intense beers? Yes, yet few are as revisitable as this. Beer excellence all around!"
"Edit: After a second tasting it's grown on me a little bit, but I maintain my overall rating. Good, but not great."
"O: Certainly unique but in a good way. I love the complexity, am not a fan of the bitter finish, but I would not hesitate to get this again."
"Overall: There is a good reason Chimay beers have been around forever. They are delicious."
"pours a murky reddish brown with a two finger off white thick sudsy head that slowly fades to a thin cap of froth. smells very sweet, dark fruits (plums, raisins) malts, yeasty with a touch of clove. taste is pretty much the same as the nose. mouthfeel is crisp and lively at first, then fades into a long dry finish. overall i'm not sure what all the hub-bub is about with this beer. it's decent but not one of my favorites."
"330ml bottle from 2004. Poured into a palm glass. Dark ruby colour. 2 finger tanned head. Strong fruity aroma. Tasted strong hints of cherry, chocolate and mousse au chocolat. The beer had a great feel to it, it had aged well, so easy to drink but it was a sipper rather than one to drink fast."
"Overall - Fantastic. I could drink this for breakfast, lunch, and dinner."
"M - rather lively carbonation, but perfect for the medium-full body. Slight dryness in the finish."
"O: An excellent Trappist ale. I've often felt that many of Chimay's detractors are more critical of the popularity of these ales than of their quality. This exceptional beer does nothing to change my opinion."
"O: I'm not a fan of the sweetness and the active carbonation, but where I dislike this drink I can see where others might enjoy. Not a bad drink, but far from great."
"Try this beer with a beef stew … why not use it IN the beef stew. Chimay Première will also go well with any grilled meat dish. And why not drink it as dessert ? Beats a cappucino !"
"If you're looking for complexity, look elsewhere. A fair amount of yeast and malt with a bite of hops. Finishes pretty dry. There's a little bit of caramel and pear in the smell, but nothing that really develops and wows. Finishes slightly dry and fizzy."
"The flavor follows. Lots of sweet caramel and alcohol, ripe dark fruits, some earthiness. It is a good dubbel."
"Drinks well and has an understated complexity."
"O – Okee dokee. I'm trying to be objective about this, but I'm not blown away. What do I say? Maybe it has something to do with the temperature. I am drinking it right out of my American fridge, hardly ideal conditions. I'm not committed enough to this review thing to wait to submit it an hour from now after I've had it warm up. But then, I have every intention of drinking the whole 750 tonight, so it'll get plenty warm. My guess is I'll like it better twenty minutes from now. Okay. Enough."
"Wow, the best dubbel I have tried. Fantastic all around brew. Can understand why this is their flagship. Excellent world class stuff here."
"O-very good beer. Try not to go too far back with this one."
"Overall: a standout dubbel indeed.. as of now, it ranks alongside Pere Jacques for top honors."
"Scent is fruity.Body has the color of unfiltered apple cider, produced a one and a half finger of head, which quickly dissipates.Spotty lacing of chalice. Taste is excellent, reminiscent of fig,date,and Asian pear!Not at all bity or bitter."
"This is a well made beer but like many dubbels and triples it does little for me."
"Rich with a sharp effervescence that mellowed quickly. Medium-full body. Restrained but persistent aftertaste."
"O: One of my favorites! I have had this many times, and will continue to have this over and over again. Everything from the pour to the finish is a treat, (though on this pour, something was not right...) There are others out there that come close, but for me, this is the One!"
"Extraordinarily drinkable, though maybe a touch too sweet. I've always been a bit intimidated by Belgian beers and I'm pretty sure this was my first dubbel, but I'll be sure to try others now. Seems like it would go well with garlic-based foods or an alfredo sauce."
"I have often found this style to be pretty darn good, but this one isn’t. It doesn’t taste bad…but what beer really does? This is however an awful example of beer."
"Turbid is the best way to describe the appearance of the Chimay Red: it looks as though someone disturbed the sand in the water near the shoreline. Dark tan / caramel in color, murky, and has a head that fades quickly, but leaves a light blanket of foam. Smells malty with a hint of raisin and plum, with the slightest trace of hops. As far as flavor goes, its yeasty and malty with distinct spice notes and dark fruits. Bitterness lingers on the tongue as it goes down. Has a medium body and heavy carbonation that washes over the taste buds like a thousand little kisses every time I take a swig. A strong Dubbel."
"O - Good, not amazing though. Good solid beer that is quite drinkable. Not my favorite in the style, but still solid."
"O - One of my favorite beers from one of my favorite styles. This is what Ben Franklin was talking about..."
"Burnt red with slight murkiness despite a careful pour. An inch of creamy, ecru head leaves a speck or two of lace before settling down to a thin cap. A nice blend of fruits including plum, grape, and cherry jump out first before being evened out by a bready, musty yeastiness and a sharp phenolic note. Some brown sugar emerges as it warms, as does a biting bitterness at the back of the palate. It perfectly exemplifies the extremely dry, yet creamy mouth presence that almost all of the Trappists have perfected. An excellent and complex ale that would stand up well to roasted root vegetables, braised lamb, and a chocolate-laden dessert."
"O: Very drinkable ale with sweet aromas and taste. Enjoyed it and looking forward to other Chimay brews."
"Overall: A very well made and complex beer. Always pricey on draft but a decent pick up in bottles."
"Poured a nice hazy brown color with a quick disappearing head.. halfway through it looked like I was drinking tea because the head had completely disappeared. Smells of faint citrus and yeast. Taste a little on the sweet side with a hint of clove and raisins.. also a fair amount of carbonation in this beer... it was tolerable... it's just something I don't really like in a beer. This one was decent, I'm now looking forward to trying the other Chimay's."
"O: I’m glad I started with the lowest ABV of the three – I didn’t expect to drink it this fast! All in all, I’d characterize this beer as subtle; not a lot of big flavors, smooth, and without any strong aromas. A great dinner beer."
"O – A very good double, but there are some better ones to get."
"Overall, a sensational beer. Big flavors, great texture, complex, and balanced."
"I'll have to try this again sometime but for the moment I'm a little disappointed in the lack of yeast character in the flavor. The aroma, though, is amazing!"
"O: Very drinkable Dubbel that is thick, complex and a pleasure to drink. Not something I would drink everyday, this is the type of beer that I would treat myself with."
"O - very enjoyable...great taste and smell which compliment each other perfectly and the balance of ingredients makes it that much better. There isnt anything I can point out as a flaw with this beer...I now understand why it is so highly praised; its well deserved...Cheers!"
"This pours a hazy, yeast dreg filled dark tea color with a large foamy tan head which seems to quickly dissipate down to a very thin layer. The smell is very sweet and malty, I also get some grapes. The feel is high carbonation, very tingly, the body is medium to light. The taste is not quite as sweet as the smell makes it seem, I get some peppery spices, some of the sweet malts, a hint of grape and figs, but a very pleasant long dry finish (excellent counterbalance to the sweetness). I do wish I knew how fresh or old this was because I do like this one."
" Overall this beer lives up to the name Chimay. I will always have some of this around. Maybe my favorite dubbel that I have had."
"O- This is an excellent beer. It may not be the ultimate session brew but I had no expectation of that. Although, the alcohol is barely noticeable on the palate at 7%. This tastes great and feels great. What more could I say?"
"My gentle pour from an 11.2 ounce bottle created a dense finger of tawny head with excellent retention. I could barely bring myself to look at it - I was and remain so unworthy that I was cowed by its presence. This is what it means to me to respect beer. The color was a deep copper with NE-quality clarity. Nose was rich and malty and I got a cereal-like quality along with the underlying must. Mouthfeel was really full and soft and it caressed my tongue like it was welcoming me back after a long underway period. The taste was more caramel and toffee than anything else and even though I generally disdain sweetness in beers, I was game for anything. Finish remained very sweet with an underlying mustiness that I welcomed after the malt onslaught. It has been a long time since I last had Chimay Red and I am glad for the more reasonable individual serving although I might buy a big bottle for aging. Forget what St. Pauli Girl would have you believe - THIS is the beer that you will not forget your first!"
"All in all, This is alright but not really feeling it given the other two Chimay offerings and the many other dubels out there. Don't get me wrong, Its a stellar brew, just fell a little short of expectations."
"Very tasty and worthy drink here, with plenty of complexity. A proven favorite."
"O - this is what a Belgian is meant to be without the over the top ABV"
"This beer pours a light brown with a decent off white head. the smell is pleasant, a little fig/raisin. the flavor is pretty close but a little bit muted in comparison to other dubbels. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with ok carbonations. overall just not worth the money you pay. would rather drink ommegang/allagash/unibroue."
"RJT."
"Cheers."
"D -- There is no question why this is a classic and been enjoyed by many a lucky drinker over the years. If you haven't had it, you're missing out."
"This beer poured out as a nice looking reddish brown color. The head was fizzy and white, which also doesn't leave too much lacing either. The smell of the beer is a mostly earthy and a little spicy. The taste spicy upfront and suttles into a dry earthy sweetness in the end. The mouthfeel was about the same at the Grand Reserve. Overall this beer is good, I'm not a huge fan of the style but this one is worth trying."
"Pours a hazy amber to brown-ish color with a light tan head. In the aroma, fruity and notes of alcohol. In the taste, small caramel like roast, nice fruity notes and a small alcohol note in the end. A smooth and medium bodied mouthfeel, with a small dry fruity and caramel like aftertaste. A bit more boozy than I remember, but a very nice dubbel nonetheless."
"O - This is one fine Trappist. I havent had many, but I like the ones I have. This tops that list for me. I buy this brew over and over again. I can drink it any time of year. Myself having certain types of brews for certain times of year cant say that about many brews. This is one I can enjoy whenever."
"Poured into a tulip glass. Beautiful looking beer. Mahogany in color. The head thick, rocky, and lasting. Seems to stay around forever. The head went down first around the edges and left a mountain of foam. Not much lacing though in the end. Smells amazing as well. Picking up lots of fruit and spiciness. White grapes, raisins, slightly sour berries in the background. I also get a pleasant clove spice with faint maple syrup and and soft Belgium yeast. Taste is well balanced. Floral hops along with dark fruits and caramel. The clove spice gives the finish a little kick. Everything melds together really well. The mouth feel is not to heavy not too light. Bubbly carbonation. Smooth none the less. Fantastic beer. No complaints. I enjoyed this one very much."
"O: This 11.2 ounce bottle was just the perfect size for a quick one while cooking; I'd probably ruin dinner if I consumed the big bottle. Time to look in on my ribs and rice, which I'll be enjoying with my next bottle. Yum!"
"Fantasticly crafter beer. Layered, fluffy, light and delicious wth a long drying finish. Sweet raisin and plum in the middle, light oxidation qualities leaves a sherry like taste, caramel, belgan spice, earthy and rotund. Full bodied at the finsh. The sweet figgy, plummy middle is rounded out by a bitter hop that keeps things from cloying. Liquid raisin bread, deep dark bready malty goodness."
"O: I would put this the the category of a starter Trappist, for someone new to the style. Nothing to weird or overpowering."
"The overall texture of this brew is grainy, with a medium body. Drinkability is good."
"One of my favourite beers.."
"D/O: A good quality brew with a fun spice, this is reasonably drinkable and a good overall experience."
"Overall: this beer is very easy to quaff, and a bomber bottle is enough for a session. Great flavors and well balanced, this beer is just plain old enjoyable."
"Overall a great beer. Not quite my favourite dubbel but excellent in quality nonetheless."
"Overall: Nice dubbel, one of the better ones out there."
"O. Phenomenal beer. This was the first Trappist beer I ever tried, and I've been loving them since. I had to come back around to this one and review it."
"Overall this is a great, readily available Belgian Dubbel. I was down the shore and I was pleased to find this in the little po-dunk liquor store to save me from having to drink the other available ""choices"" at my grandparents house. Not as delicious as I remember when I first sampled it, but that it was one of my first craft beers so my palate was quite impressed by anything at that time. Quite nicely done; it goes down like candy and really just a smooth and really nice (almost dangerously so) drinkable Belgian beer."
"O - A solid Belgian brew with a big reputation, always a good pick."
"Still trying to develop my palate for belgians."
"High-grade beer in a weapons-grade bottle. Not the most powerful dubble you'll ever have, but that's the beauty of Belgian beer, and especially the attraction of Chimay: subtle, round, flavorful and aromatic, period. Seek your clubs-and-whips abuse elsewhere."
"The time and effort put into this beer are noticeable in so many ways, but no way better than that balance. I'm so glad I picked this up, and I can't wait to try its' brothers, yellow and blue. I highly recommend."
"Overall: Probably the ""worst"" of the three prominent Chimay ales, though still not bad by any means. It's very drinkable and just tasty enough not to diminish the Chimay name."
"Chestnut brown, big fluffy white head, good intricate lace left on the glass. Smell is of brown sugar, dark fruit, yeast, raisin and plum soaked in alcohol. Taste is of dark fruit, alcohol, brown sugar, raisin, plum complex while working with the yeast also nice over ripe cherry. Good feel, medium weight, lightish carbonation, creamy at points. Really good stuff, I enjoy this one quite a bit so it will stay in my regular rotation."
"M/O: Bubbly yet not fizzy. Drinks superbly. Not the best dubbel, but worth buying a couple times a year."
"This chimay definitely stood out the most to me, but it was the best chimay. It poured a big head but quickly dissipated, I smelled a hint of Maple (not sure if it's maple wood or just plain ole maple). It looked pretty nice with a medium yellow to red brownish body. The taste was a good hint of red cherries but had a very short finish. Its too bad for the short finish because I didn't want to have to drink a second one lol."
"Poured a 2"" cream colored head dense like memory mattress foam but somehow completely dissipated to a trace in only a few minutes. Hazy ruddish brown color sort of like a cider. Cold it smelled barely of caramel. Slightly warmed I also got some alcohol whiff and a bit of the dried fruit. Taste has dried fruits and caramel and a slight bitterness in the finish. There's a slight acidity contributing to a medium finish. Hey, it's a quality beer, and I respect its history and where it's from, I'm just not sure it's top of its game."
"very strong representative of the style. certain to be enjoyed again."
"Overall- I was looking for much more in this Dubbel but I guess Chimay can't have ALL fantastic beers. I really enjoy their other two brews though. This one was too light, the drinkability was fanastic but shouldn't this beer be more bodied and fill you up more? Sucks too, because I paid $10.49 for this and I could've grab one of the others instead."
"Taste: I aged my last red to get a good idea of the what the malts tasted like. Lightly toasted malt flavor."
"O: One of my favorite beers. Well attenuated, drinkable, not as ""in your face"" as many dubbel imitators. Excellent head retention, probably due to the wheat proteins (chimay claims to use flour in their grist)."
"M: the bubbles are actually a complement to the beer, which is rare, otherwise very smooth, little crispness"
"Not for everyday consumption, but a nice way to treat yourself once in a while."
"A good beer that I would drink again, but I am not overly excited about it"
"O: Nice Dubbel, though I was expecting more."
"O - I like this brew but I find it increasingly taxing to drink with each sip. This isn't just over-carbonated for a dubbel, it's over-carbonated for champagne! Distracting and disappointing but a good dubbel otherwise."
"Pours a light brown color, light shines through easily around the edges of the glass. Head is generous and lingering, tan color to the rich mousse. Clumps stick to the glass as the beer is swirled and sipped. Aromas are enticing, dark fruit and chocoalte. Flavors are fantastic, very creamy and soft mouthfeel with chocolate, raisin, caramel, plum, and sugar cookie. Nice beer, very reliable and food friendly."
"O: Overall a good dubbel. Some of the flavors aren't as pronounced as I would like them to be, Mainly some sweeter notes, but overall I enjoyed it."
"Both malty and yeasty at the same time, and both hit the spot pretty well. A lighter body does not hide the alcohol as well as the Blue, but still glides down with ease thanks to the delicious combination of malts used here. Hops dry it out enough on the finish and is complex enough to keep it loads of fun all the way through a bottle. This one seems a good aging candidate for 2-5 years."
"overall i like it very much. it's a light-ish beer, but has a good richness to it. well balanced."
"O - I'm just not happy with my experience with this beer. I am really shocked at how highly it is rated here. It is so hard to get past the alcohol/vinegar smell/taste with with one. I've had plenty of beers with higher alcohol content that were not so strong with the alcohol on the tongue. Is it possible that I got 2 bad bottles? Could be... but I'm not gonna get this again anytime soon."
"O: It is always a pleasure to enjoy a Chimay product; very nice."
"overall, chimay red is a very solid beer. definitely not among my favorite trappists, and in my opinion it even takes a backseat to a number of dubbels on the market; that said, it remains tasty and enjoyable, and very approachable even for a non-craft drinker."
"O: Delicious Belgian Dubbel. Mandatory to Belgian beer lovers"
"D - Great easy drinking beer. This was my first time trying the 'Red' after having the 'Blue' multiple times and I must say that it lived up to my expectations."
"Overall: A rich, complex, and tastey brew. Something that I'd like to enjoy again on special occasions."
"O- Overall it's a trappist beer. You can't go wrong. It's a winner."
"Glowing burgundy in the glass with small white head and fine carbonation that leaves perfect Brussels lace all the way down. Aromas of honey and malt sweetness, earthy and spicy noble hops, and, buried somewhere back there, a hint of sour apple cider. Silky and dry mouthfeel with a malt sweetness that is strong, but not at all overpowering as it is matched perfectly by herbal hops and a rich ripe fruitiness similar to really good dark chocolate. Has a curious finish that is dry and sweet simultaneously and leaves you wanting another sip as soon as you swallow the first. Ridiculously drinkable for such a strong, complex beer. This is quite possibly the perfect beer."
"D: I have had Red before and thought it better then. Changing tastes or bad bottle, I don't know but I call it how I see it."
"Mouthfeel: Too lively"
"Pours a red/brown/orange combination with a two-finger cream/brown head. Aroma of dark fruits, sweet candied malt and a bit of Belgian spice. Flavor begins with the sweet candied malt. Plum, date and raisin dark fruit malt as well. Bread and caramel. Good sweetness. Belgian spice and a bit of earthy hopped finish to counteract the malt."
"Poured a very dark amber color with a big slightly off-white head. Lots of malt character in the nose. Also smells like fruit to me. Tastes like quite a bit of fruit coming through as well. Slight bitter dry aftertaste as well. Medium bodied mouthfeel. Goes down pretty easy. This is a pretty good tasting beer overall. I can't really think of any negatives against it."
"-Flandes Bar, Oviedo, Asturias"
"O- This is a great Belgian dubbel, and an easy one to drink. I tend to like the blue label a bit better, but for the style - this is a staple that I really enjoy. Easily available and worth the pick up if you enjoy great beer."
"Very high level of carbonation with a medium mouthfeel. Chimay is legendary but this one comes in a little lower than the white and blue. Still a very good brew."
"Drinkability and Overlall Impression: Quite drinkable this one. I've had it before but now think that I've not had it as often as it or I deserve. I'll be changing that. There is just enough loss of sweetness in the finish that taking the next sip is quite natural and easy. A bit more sweetness would bee too much. I'll be happy to have this one again as I think there's a good bit of complexity here that needs to be sampled several times to be fully appreciated. My overall impression is that this is a well made nicely balanced beer and well worth having."
"overall, disappointed. it didn't stand up to many of the other dubbels/belgian dark ales that I've had."
"Draft to said chalice. The perfect appearance for a Belgian dubbel. Orange and hazy; fairly opaque for its color. Great citrus bouquet. Tastes the part, too, and is the quintessential beer of its type. Very subtly carbonated. Mouthfeel is good too. An oldie but goodie."
"Overall - A balanced beer that has lots of flavor in it, I only wish it didn't cost so much. That said go grab one and see for yourself."
"Overall - Very interesting beer. Pretty good too. More interesting than good, but still good. Awkward wording, but that's the best way I can describe it."
"O) Chimay Red is mild version of it's big brother -- the stronger 'Blue'. The lower alcohol profile allows for a second one, which I find better than the first."
"O- A decent beer, but certainly the least favorite of the Chimay beers for me, and not one of the better Abbey or Trappist beers I've come across."
"Personally i an not a huge ale fan, i am not big on bitter tasting beers, but this beer had a perfect balance for my pallet. I got more of the carmel aspect of the beer and it was totally new for me. i have read reviews on beer that i tasted before saying""the carmel flavor really stood out in this beer"" but chimay delivered it in a way that helped me understand what people were referring to without the bitter. very smooth very enjoyable. excellent"
"This beer is much more refreshing than I initially imagined. Its quite light, and all the smells I mentioned previously are present in the taste, save the fresh fruit. The hops are very pronounced, but not too much for this particular beer. The balance is almost perfect. This is an absolute delight to drink. So creamy, so dry, I may just try this again next time I see it. Which shouldn't be too long considering its available at the SAQ. This beer is top notch."
"Overall very charming caramelly experience although less interesting than some of the other Trappiste beers (notably Orval), probably owing to excessive levels of carbonation and somewhat understated hops."
"Overall: One of my favorite beers. ABV is well hidden here, so it drinks easy, though it still encourages you to drink slow and savor it. I wish it was cheaper, because if it were I would always have it around. I do like the Grande Réserve better, but this has its place."
"From the corked bottle no. L10-506. Sampled on March 19, 2011. It pours a cloudy amber-brown with a burst of beige head with what looks like sediment floating about. Aromas of light toasted malts, plums and yeast. The body is smooth and creamy. The flavor boasts a little caramel sweetness with a noted yeast backdrop. The short descripton was that it was mellow and warmed the innards."
"Can't for the life of see why this beer is so loved on this site. Prime example of the Emperor's new beer."
"Exceptional drinkability; this is a great beer, that should be experiences and enjoyed. I served mine with some aged cheese."
"This is such a classic dubbel and in my opinion probably the best one around the taste and aroma match each other perfectly. Sweet bready spicy thick and foamy this is a meal in a bottle. Seek this one out before drinking another Dubbel."
"Pours a very hazy opaque prune juice color with a small 1/2 inch head that fades to a film on the top of the beer. No lacing on the drink down. Yeast sediment in the bottom of the glass. Smells of dark fruits like plums and raisins, caramel, yeast. Tastes of dark fruits, caramel, honey, yeast, cloves and maybe cinnamon. Very tasty. Beer is somewhat highly carbonated. Crisp and clean in the mouth. Excellent drinkability on this very delicious dubbel."
"Drink - This is one of the favourites of my good buddy Swedes21 and I finally got around to trying it. It has a very unique taste that was along the lines of an Orval mixed with a Westy 12. It's a excellent beer that is surely worth seeking out."
"A dark beer that pours nice into a bottle. There is a good amount of head with an average smell to the beer. To me the beer tasted watery, but it did have a good flavor to it. The after taste is sweet, but not too strong. It would be a good beer for dinner. Cheers."
"D - One of the most beautiful that I've ever laid eyes upon... A solid Dubbel to boot... Sophisticated and very well rounded... Mellow... A bit reserved and far from the best in class, but a very good beer none the less..."
"Overall a world class beer I remember enjoying several times in the past (almost) 20 years that I'm now realizing I've never given a proper formal review. I know palates change, but the overall flavor/impact of this classic seems to be a bit timid that what I remember. Don't get me wrong, it's still a phenomenal offering from a spectacular brewery, but I have to wonder if the recipe has been toned-down. Nonetheless, I absolutely still enjoy it and I'm very glad to have it readily available at many local retailers."
"The CPJ"
"This brew is mellow, and less sweet than most Dubbels I've had. It's high carbonation distracts me a bit, but is pleasing nonetheless."
"D: The alcohol was upfront and center, but wasn't overwhelming at all. Went down quite nicely - am sure the ABV, rather than the drinkability would limit it from being an all night beer."
"Overall a very enticing brew, but anything from this brewer seems to taste well."
"Poured into a Chimay goblet. Looks like an unfiltered apple cider, brown with gold. A small beige head settled to a thick ring and fine covering with a continuous small eruption at the center of the glass. Aroma is browned apple, clove, banana-apple, cinnamon, and apple-raisin pie. Taste follows aroma with warming alcohol. A fine one indeed."
"I would have this again and it makes me desire to try all the Abbey beers."
"M/D: nice and light, very good example of a dubbel, I could drink this all day"
"M/D: This beer wasn't very carbonated and that might have hurt its complexity. There just was not a lot going on and this beer never really kept my interest throughout the pour. Mediocre flavor. I would grab a Rochefort 8 or Westmalle dubbel anytime over this."
"Overall a good beer, drinkable but not overly so...Dubbels are not my favorite style so far, I need to try a few more to compare this one to."
"Ruby brown color and a fizzy head, which fades quickly. Nose is surprisingly spicy and yeasty with a bit of heat and a great grain character. Smells a little of unfermented wort (which is not such a bad thing). Some fruity esters come out in the taste. Roasty and caramel flavors appear, too. Very enjoyable, straightfoward, and archetypal example of a dubbel."
"750 ml bottle (7/20 date on the cork) poured into Chimay Chalice. 3 fingers of gorgeous creamy of white head. Excellent retention w/ a little less lacing down the glass. Smell was caramel and Belgian yeast (mmm). Taste was similar to nose, but had a little bit of a lingering metallic taste/feel. I've had this with 18 months of age on it in the past and remember it being much, much better (A+ quality). Overall, I like this brew a lot. I think I may pick up a few to cellar for football season -- seems like a great fall sipper."
"Mouthfeel is rather light but quite lively. Overall, you can't go wrong with this dubbel. I feel dubbels do not get the attention they deserve in the world of Belgian beer and while this is not my favorite of the style (Westmalle is pure greatness), a beer like this should surely get more love."
"Go out and buy this one. So much to say. Great looking bottle fascinating backstory about the Trappist brewery and the Monks. I believe the Blue is darker than this one, but this beer is great for getting into craft brews. The Blue might be too strong for some in that category. The appearance is amazing as well as the mouthfeel. Despite the cork this has ton of carbonation making a medium bodied mouthfeel. Go support the Monks and buy this beer. Makes a great centerpiece haha. Stay Thirst My Friends!"
"Very drinkable brew with good carbonation and freshness. Very good brew!"
"D - Almost too drinkable. Taste will leave you wanting more, and a large bottle would most likely be the perfect amount. Not a beer you can drink too many of, but with a beer this good you shouldn't want to."
"The pour was really well done here with a nice amber color with a light hint of caramel around the edges, big head comes up and over the top and settles down gently into a firm and long lasting pillow with loads of side glass lacing. Aroma is nice, much sweeter then I was expecting. Lots of caramel and malts right up front here, light hint of an herbal note boucning around as well, but not terribly strong. Warming brings out a yeast note that is quite intresting and adds a light fruit touch to it, but very sweet still. Flavor again is very intresting and not what I was expecting. Rich notes of caramel and almost candied like sugar abound here. Light touches of hops play on the tongue now as well, very intresting. Comes across almost like an amber ale to me, has that bready maltiness and caramel flavor I associate with it. A bit thin on the feel but the carbonation really saves it and gives it that little bit of pop to pull you in. Soo nicely done that it goes down like candy and really just a smooth and really nice drinking beer."
"M - Velvety, slightly chewy, good carbonation."
"Drinkability: Very nice, but I don't want too many of these. I can come back to it day after day, but not one I'd pound down multiples of. One of the tall bottles would be perfect (I had the 330mL one here, left me wanting just a few more sips)."
"This may be a less complicated and seductive drink than other trappist brews, but I suppose a good beer doesn't have to be robust and overwhelmingly complex. I could call it a great combination of trappist quality and drinkability."
"drinkability; very drinkable and pleasant, has a numbing warmth from the alcohol that gives a sense of well being, I like this much."
"Taste is better than the aroma. Bready malt with more of that Belgian fruit and a little herbal hop spiciness.. Nice complex beer for one that's also very easy drinking. Quite a light body for a rich beer. Carbonation helps the mouthfeel be fuller, but this is a pretty light drinking beer that it would be easy to down too quickly. Very nice beer."
"Overall a well done and easy drinking beer, though I didn't really feel that anything stood out in particular for me."
"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew is how no-nonsense it is. Many dubbels can run the risk of presenting as too sweet or syrupy, but here we find one that is bold in its malting and yeasting, and not afraid to highlight them. It is quite a simple brew, but it leaves the drinker happy. The one downfall is the over carbonation. It is equitable to drinking a highly fizzy glass of champagne, mouthfeel wise, which acts to detract from the beer's otherwise pleasantness."
"Very nice and not too heavy or too biting."
"Can't believe it took this longer for me to try something from Chimay."
"The mouthfeel is middling and the carbonation is sublime. It was constant throughout the entire beer. As for drinkability, the 7% is hidden quite well. I could stand to have a few of these in a sitting although I'd be paying for it in the morning. All in all, another wonderful beer from the trappist monks at Chimay."
" Would recommend for anyone that enjoys a decent Dubbel."
"I thought Cimay Premiere's flavor was a little mellow, the smell was great, it drinks very easy and I would definitely drink it again."
"D: I wouldn't pick up the singles but wouldn't pass up the mixed pack with the glass."
"O- Straightforward dubbel. Not the most complex out there, but still quite peculiar as Chimay yeast is pretty easily detectable. Drinkability and overall balance are quite nice. Felt a bit heavy on my stomach"
"Chimay Red was brown in color and cloudy with fine particles floating about. It had a large off-white head that soon becomes only a thin ring with little lacing. The smell was dark malt and yeast aromas. The taste was dark fruit, malt, yeast, peppery spice, and a little hop flavor. The finish was long and dry. The mouthfeel was good with a medium body and medium-high carbonation. Drinkability was good as well. This is a good Dubbel and worth a try."
"Drinkability: Too strong for more than 2, but beautifully complex and enjoyable; one of the best drinking experiences I've had"
"It certainly looks cool."
"Usually poured in a snifter glass from bottle or on-tap. Dark hazels brown with a half inch of a nosily bubbly head, lots of small chunks float everywhere, very tasty looking beer. Sharp yeast, smooth banana, a touch of alcohol, and cherries fill the nose, beer smells better and better when beer warms to proper temperature. Banana, and sweet malts comprise most of the flavor, there seems to be a slight smoky aspect to it as well, the flavor is very good but seems slightly watered down. Quality has gone noticeably down and I prefer the bigger brother (Blue) over this one."
"Overall: I am sorta surprised here. I expected a little more but not sure what. This was something to be experienced but I doubt I'll go back for seconds...since I did not finish this one. Not earth shattering and almost unpleasant. I'd choose a nice bottle of wine, instead, to get the flavor profile and characteristics I get here."
"The carbonation is slightly too apparent for me, but generally the beer feels very nice. Carbonation aside, it drinks very well indeed."
"Pours a cloudy reddish amber with a nice tan head and good lacing. Aroma of caramel malts, some dark fruits. Taste is sweet malts, some belgian yeast, some plums and dates, some cherries. Palate is nice medium bodied, good carbonation. Finish is sweet malt, plums, dates, raisins, sweet spices, ending in a long nice sweet nutty aftertaste. Overall a nicely balanced and drinkable brew. Very enjoyable."
"D- Easy to drink. A sipper due to spice and alcohol content."
"D- Not bad"
"D: Complex taste, balanced taste, what you'd expect from belgium. Very drinkable."
"Drinkability is a solid good, easily available and at a good price point."
"750 ml bottle. Pours hazy amber with a thick, long lasting off-white head. Aroma is of dark fruit, yeast and brown sugar. The body is full and crisp. Taste is a lot of dark fruit, brown sugar and spicy hops. Long lasting, dry finish. I used to like this brew much more. Must be my taste has changed over the years."
"Poured fron the bottle into chimay chalice. Pours a deep reddish brown with a thick tan head with a bit of yeast floating around. Smell is dark fruit raisin plun and fig with a faint spiciness of clove. Taste is sweet bready malt raisin dark molases and brown sugar followed by a dry yeasty and clove bite. Mouthfeel is super smooth and creamy but light due to a nice amount of carbonation. Drinkability is great the only problem about chimay is the price!"
"Poured a nice shade of brown with only minimal head that dissipated quickly. Smell is powerful and fulsome; fruit and spice are detectable. Cola flavor is evident in the taste, as are sugary malts and pepper. Mildly sweet, yeasty, creamy and dry. Medium body with high but soft and smooth carbonation. Finishes crisply with no bitterness whatsoever. Alcohol is hidden nicely for a 7.00. And for those who are into sessionability, this is an extremely sessionable beer. I only wish the waitress had brought me a clean glass with each additional bottle...."
"I consider this the lesser-Chimay, in comparison to the white and blue. All the qualities are there, but the flavor blend leaves one slightly underwhelmed. A bit more malt sweetness would add to both body and flavor, but who am I to question a national treasure?"
"D: Eminently drinkable. Goes down almost too easily."
"D - very drinkable, deceptively so."
"Beer color is amber, dark with a frivolous head that disappear quickly. Aroma is fruity and sugary. Some apples in the aroma. Nice. Taste is slightly metallic at first. No big problems. Apple in the taste. Strong apple taste. I would have guess this one to be more sugary in the taste. It is very well balanced. A nice beer from Chimay. Better than the blue for me. Very effervescent in the mouth which makes the beer crisp in the mouth. Medium body feeling for me. Reminds me more of a belgian pale ale but I'm having a lot of difficulty to analyze those belgian beers. It is a nice one. Easy to drink too for a 7% ABV. Cheers!"
"D: One of the all time greats, and one of the best examples of the style. I love that this beers is available pretty much everywhere, and is a great gateway beer for a novice drinker."
"D: I'd say this is a slow drinker but one has to drink it slowly to truly do justice to the flavours. It's also quite well priced. Beers like this are excellent to have with food. I will say that this beer is so dry it's almost too dry for me, and I generally love dry beers. Maybe it's the mood I'm in. 4"
"I could certainly go for a few more rounds of this if I could afford it!"
"D: This is the best dubbel I have ever had."
"D - Have to hand it to those monks again, another very solid brew."
"Mouthfeel is really great, a nice high carbonation but not distracting, finish is crisp and despite ABV drinkability is good and it's a refreshing beer."
"Hazy copper color with nice off-white head that stays well. I have a terrible sense of smell but even so pick up a nice spiciness. Very drinkable and paired really well with the venison tenderloin I was having. Not quite as much to my taste as the Grand Reserve but still very enjoyable."
"A really good beer. The beer is an orangeish tone with some red in it a white head. The beer was sort of sweet while balanced out with bitterness while achieving a crisp finish that I was able to sip on for half an hour. One of those beers that works when you just need a good easy to drink beer that won't offend."
"Very drinkable beer, this is one I'll buy again."
"D- Overall, Chimay Red is a solid beer that is worth a try."
"Red comes out looking the part with a dark brown shoe polish like look with some red towards the sky. A nice looking Dubbel with a creamy tan cap with some waves. Some muck up on the glass. Smell is bold malt, toasted bread, toffee and maybe some apple. A smooth taste of malt coupled with nuts, Belgian yeast, a small candi like toffee, slight caramel and light fruits. Feel is real smooth. Highly carbed yet very easy and not stinging on da mouf. A nice medium build with a fruity after taste. Easy drinking and a big bottle would be no problem. Probably the best dubble in my mind"
"Highly enjoyed this trappist ale."
"Drinkability: Not very drinkable."
"D- Promised so much but delivered little. Didnt look the part and the flavour/aroma profile was subdued. Definitely lacked the rich maltiness this style is known for. Not one to savour."
"Pours a nice reddish brown color with an off white head, a bit of sediment and slight cloudiness in the glass. Smell is lightly sweet, some tart cherries, a touch of alcohol and some plums and figs mixed in. Taste starts out with a dry fruity cherry sweetness, followed by some moderate carbonation, which leads into a slight bitterness and a touch of natural yeasty flavor in the aftertaste. It has a very wine-like feel to it, with an extremely flavorful dry and fruity finish. A very refreshing brew with a bit of alcohol warmth after each sip. Overall, the taste leads me to think of this as a very fruit forward beer with a nicely balanced and light mouthfeel, making this an easy drinking dubbel that pairs well with a nice meal."
"Pouring into one of my weizen glasses I noticed the nose right off the bat. The scent was very strong, totally reminding me of what a Trappist style beer is. The color is a dark brown shade, very appealing. The head formed was a solid inch, slowly receding, leaving a bold lacing pattern. The flavor is so delicious, it reminds me why I love this style of beer so much. I really don't have much more to say about this beer then try it yourself, you will not be let down. Belgian style abbey ales, especially Trappist style, are just so damn good, you need to try it!"
"It's good and very drinkable, just not very complex or flavorful."
"D: A drinkable beer, but not one of my favorite Belgian or Trappist ales."
"D: the drinkability is awesome for this beer. Everything is well balanced and it keeps you wanting more."
"Chimay Red may not be as flavorful as other Belgian dubbels, but it's still impressive. When it's available at a bar in Vegas amidst a swath of BMC taps, all the better."
"D: Very nice. Terrific bready, malt flavor. You can slug this one back without too much effort."
"Drinkabilty - You can drink this one right down. Its smooth and not very strong. The sourness isnt too bad once you have a couple drinks. Pretty tasty and very easy to drink."
"I've been a big fan of Chimay white for a while, so I got a 3 pack this Christmas to try out its siblings. When poured in a glass, it has a gorgeous slightly cloudy amber tone with subtle carbonation. It smells very fruity and a bit of caramel. It tastes solid, very drinkable and laid back. I was hoping for a little more spice to pop out, but it left me wanting a bit more. Overall a good beer."
"Only wish there's little more character, but otherwise it's excellent."
"D-I could easily see me drinking a few in a row, but not in a sessoin kind of way. More of a sitting around with friends."
"A very pleasant beer. Nice fruity notes. Very easy to drink. The alcohol is well hidden in both the nose and the taste."
"A nice Belgian ale. Easy to drink but it could be a bit more interesting."
"Pours a foggy brown. Many ribbons accumulate into a small, thin top layer of silken tan foam. The nose on this screams classic dubbel. Nice marzipan, roasty, light molasses. This ale is complex with hints of marzipan, apple and burnt caramel on the tongue. The beer is light enough in carbonation to remain light on the tongue, but sediment leaves tongue remaining grainy. Overall, this beer is very drinkable and should be sampled by anybody who enjoys belgians, or is just wanting something new and dependable."
"heavily carboned with a deep red color and very light head. typical chimay yeast smell, with a fruity overtone. more the same in the taste, it goes down smoothly. light and fruity. Overall taste is difficult to pinpoint but it sure is good. medium bodied and with nice carbonation, this is my favorite dubbel. drinkability is excellent."
"This is my all-time favorite Belgian beer! Smooth yet spicy taste, very drinkable, even quaffable. A heavy color and feel, and a great finish; and it's becoming available now almost everywhere because of its popularity. I prefer the corked-type poured in a Chimay glass."
"d: Outstanding overall, but not quite the best dubbel I recall trying."
"Pours a dark rusty brown, with a couple fingers of dense cream coloured head. Great retention, and a lot of floaties (suspended yeast) moving around in there. Nose is full of sweet fruit esters, green apple, light nuts and some plums. I get a sense of some acidity there too, and this is evident in the palate, which follows the nose for the most part. High carbonation and lively palate. Dry and yeasty finish. Quite simple and enjoyable overall."
"This beer is nice, but at the price tag I expect more."
"It is not as lively and food-friendly as Belgian IPA, tripel or golden ales, and is not as rich and creamy as darker ales to be drunk on its own, so I am a bit at a loss to justify picking up another bottle. It is a nice dubbel, but a bit characterless and boring."
"Appearance is a medium brown color with a one finger head that is there momentarily. Soon, all you have on top is a white ring with a little cloudiness. The smell contains raisins, brown sugar and belgian yeast. Its taste is sweet, not too rich, more of the brown sugar, as well as candied fruit. Mouthfeel is very good, with just the right carbonation level and some alcohol and bitterness present, but not too much. Chimay Premiere is a very drinkable dubbel. I have tried it a few times before & happy that I chose to pick it up again."
"Value (not considered in the ratings) is medium for this style and quality. About $4.50 a bottle."
"A true classic, if you haven't tried it you need to."
"O: A classic for a reason. I wouldn't say it's the best dubbel I've tried, but a solid choice. To improve it, I would add some more fruitiness and tone down the clove phenols."
"Cheers!!!"
"The Chimay Premiere is definitely a classic and should be a part of everyone's collection."
"Drinkability: Went fantastic with Thanksgiving meal (Pot roast, potatoes, carrots, sweet potato biscuits) and I wish I had gotten two bottles. And yet, splitting the bottle with the Mrs. at dinner was perfect. The beer didn't go to my head and really complimented the meal well. I'll definitely have to pick up another bottle and see if I can tease out all the flavors here - this is a well crafted beer and was very enjoyable to drink."
"D - Good beer all around. Even at 7% I have no problem easily finishing the 750ml."
"The flavor brings forward some notes of lightly-sweetened dark fruits, raisins, and malt along with a fairly strong presence of dates and a nice yeasty character. Medium body with low carbonation and a bit of booze. Drinks fairly well but doesn't have all that much depth."
"Drinkability -- I remembered this being better. Certainly solid, but since my first Chimay Red I've had better Dubbels."
"very cloudy poor with a quick dissipating white fluffy head. This one has a very nice malt flavor with a slight sweetness that rounds off perfectly. It has a bit of a cider feel. Has a nice cold mouth feel with a decent drinkability. It is a little bit weaker than some duppel's that I have had in the past."
"D- chimay is very over rated in my opinion. Would not purchase any of them again except maybe to try them on tap."
"D - This would be a good Belgian to sesh. Not overly strong at 7% and full of flavour. Could be more complex and the sweetness needs more balance but it's still a nice drink."
"D- Goes down easy, light feel for a dubbel."
"Drinkability? Fair. This is a big and potent brew, with nothing quite like it in the US. Is it a good beer? Yes. Is it something I liked drinking? Sure. Would I seek it out again? Probably not. A beer like this needs a special occasion, a reason to drink such a mighty brew."
"Honestly I could probably drink a lot more of this beer; however, I feel like there are better dubbels out there. The slight sourness of the beer doesn't compliment the malt as much as I had hoped. Good work from Chimay, but honestly speaking, the Blue Grand Reserve is the Chimay for me."
"Bottle, pours a reddish chestnut with a wispy head. Nose is belgian yeast, light figs, some chestnuts. Kind of underwhelming. Flavor is at first too bitter with a long, bitter finish, faintly cola-like. As it warms some nice creaminess comes through, with some raisins and figs. Decent, but too watery. Heavily carbonated. Some of the fine nuances are there, but this is just a large step down from the Grand Reserve, and is watery compared to some of the better dubbels out there."
"d - A decent beer, but I think it has faded a bit over time. The expiration on this one was 1997, and I don't think it improved at all with age. I would say drink this beer fresh or with 2-4 years on it."
"D: Chimay's reputation is well-earned. Though this may be my least favourite of the three I've tried, it feels wrong to dub it 'least' in any way. A delicious beer, wonderfully drinkable, marvellously tasty. If only I had a nice cheese, my life would be complete. Needless to say, recommended."
"D: A really fun experience. It makes me want to buy a few cases of Chimay and tuck them away in the back of the cellar."
"Pours a nice dark red with a rocky beige head that lasts quite some time, good lacing, smell.. not so crazy impressed.. but it is okay, smells better than the average beer.. smells kinda sweet thats about all i can pick out. Carbonation very strong! Tastes slightly sweet with a nice spice to it and some alcohol ester taste. overall i would say this is pretty ok. not exactly what i thought it would be because of its high rating but i dont really have much to complain about either so i say give it a shot."
"M - Light to medium body, nice chew. Lightly carbonated."
"Drinkability: This confirms my love for this style of beer and provides enough complexity that you would never get bored."
"D- Moderate to high. Relative lack of complexity make it a no-brainer, but odd medicine after taste is off putting. Further, ABV is far too noticable for a seven percent dubbel. Bitterness also unpleasent at termination, not enough malt sweetness and masking of ABV to counter-act it."
"Drinkability: I'll seek this out in the future. I prefer it to Chimay blue. It's not the best dubbel I've had, but we're quibbling over which bar of gold has more minor dents. Give it a try and you won't be disappointed."
"I find this beer to be easily consumed. In the past I've worked my way through the 750ml large format bottles' I wish this was one of those times. I've never grown tired of this beer. All of the flavors work well together and keep me coming back for more. This is an exceptional beverage; we're lucky that it is as available as it is."
"All in all, a fantastic beer."
"Yeah, go ahead and get it, it's a whole new way of viewing beer."
"Overall: great dubbel. Deserves its fame."
"D- This was a very pleasant experience and it's amazing how fast i enjoyed this whole bottle. Very affordable and worthwhile."
"Drinkability - Please continue to produce this beer. I have 2 Chimay so far on my beer trail and i think they are both amazing beers. I am so impressed with this beer and will stock it in my fridge, i can hand this out to anyone."
"Poured from a .33 liter bottle into a chalice. It provided about two inches of fluffy sea foam type head that eventually went down to about 1/2 finger of head. Some mild lacing occurred. A nice red tint. Smells like a loaf of warm bread, some mild spiciness and some fruit characteristics. Nice complex flavor. Can taste the yeasts, some roasted malts, and mild hops with fruit overtones. Can't put my finger on the exact fruit but goes nocely with the bread. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, not syrupy like some dubbel, and not overly alcohol feeling. Drinkability is fine and dandy, could enjoy a few at a sitting, and since they are readily available at a fairly decent price, don't mind if I do."
"D - Not bad and easy to enjoy, but for me, there are many better dubbels that are more to my tastes."
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied and the carbonation is moderate. Drinkability is good, it's a very good beer with some great flavors. Everything came together nicely and it's a very good example of the style."
"D - I would definitely would love to have more in the future but it is a bit overwhelming."
"Overall impression: not an everyday beer due to the price, but very delicious. traditional silky smooth dubbel."
"Really a quality beer. Nice taste that goes down easy and despite a nice chunk of alcohol, there is no burn in the throat and you wouldn't know the ABV is so high because there is no indication. Just a great beer."
"This is a good, dry Dubbel. It is a reassuring beer in a world where Chimay's grasp of quality seems to be loosening-- my recent experience with the White was sub-par, to say the most. The Red, however, is a good beer."
"drinkability: Nice brew, not one I'll keep stocked."
"D- Very drinkable, at any temperature really. Was impressive how the flavor of it just pounced on top of the flavor of the food I just had. The ABV seems to be almost completely undetectable."
"Interesting bottle and attractive uniform labeling."
"Overall, this is one of my go to Belgian beers. It is not my favorite beer, but it is one of the greats."
"Overall it's a very delicious beer in my book. Been going back to this one a couple of times, it's widely available here in Barcelona so it's no problem to have it anytime."
"This is a solid Trappist brew, though not the best Chimay in my opinion. I'm definitely a bigger fan of the blue label. Anyways the appearance of this beer is top notch... a deep hazy brown along with a good amount of head. The smell is a delightful combo of sweet and spicy. Taste-wise it has a bit of an initial bite to it followed by a mild blend of sweet/fruity/spicy. Normally I like a bit more maltiness in a Belgian, though this is only 7% ABV, a bit lower than my average Belgian. Mouthfeel is good... a bit watery at first but ends nicely. It is quite easy to drink, though a bit more maltiness would make it a little smoother. All in all this is a great beer, but like I said above, when presented with a Chimay lineup, this isn't my favorite."
"Very drinkable Dubbel and a fabulous gateway Belgian. The $5.45/per price keeps the drinkability score down .5 pts though."
"Superb, I hope I can get my hands on the other Chimay types."
"Notes: one of my favorite beers of all time! Completely changed the way I looked at beer the first time I had it."
"Notes: Quite the reliable classic. Maybe nothing that I feel too eager to drink but it is tremendously solid, and even if a bit too recurrent as a Trappist icon it was a key brew to introduce me to quality brews way back when... And deservedly so."
"I really enjoyed this beer, even if it was one of the more expensive bottles I've had (8 bucks for a bottle). But I enjoyed sipping it while watching Inception."
"The beer pours a slightly hazy brown color with a white head. The aroma is dark fruit, brown sugar and caramel malt. The flavor is grapes, dark fruit, caramel malt, alcohol, yeast and brown sugar. Very complex and very nice. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. A world classic that didn't disappoint. 4"
"Overall, a decent dubbel with a ton of flavors that go pretty well together. A slow sipper, as some alcohol does show a bit."
"Great flavour and extremely drinkable."
"Pours a strangely light reddish brown color with carbonation streaming everywhere. Very tan red head recedes quickly. Really much lighter than what I am used for for this style. Aroma is bready spicy malts with biscuity undertones. The flavor is light yet complex. Now I see why this is the model the other brewers try to copy. The spicy, bready and complexities finish to the backnpalate. Mouthfeel is very carbonated and full in the finish. Nice food beer. Drinkability is perfect. Great and a nice cold temp and gets more complex as it warms."
"The lower ABV makes it possible to have more volume in a sitting, which certainly isn't a bad thing. Good color, nice head, very good taste."
"So, I actually have had this beer many times, but I thought I would review it. This is a DELICOUS beer, but it's not as good as the blue or the white. I wish it had a little less of an iron taste to the finish, but I am a little particular about that taste. But it holds a great head, smells to me like brown sugar and it is worthy of it's title of being a Trapistte!"
"Drinkability: I understand where the hype comes from with this beer. Very nice dubbel style that hides it's ABV effectively."
"Drinkability- while delicious, i wouldnt try to throw back more than 1 or 2 more of these, over a couple hours"
"Fairly drinkable though the snappyness of the carbonation starts to wear on me after a bit."
"Obviously good, and unique. A lot to like. I admit. Something is lacking, though, in the final product. A shade too hot. A little shallow in spite of the layers of flavors. Yeah, it's flavor is layered, but each layer takes you wading in the kiddie pool instead of base jumping into deliciousness."
"D: Larger sips reveal more depth, so perhaps small sips was not the best way to approach the ale. A good dubbel."
"All in all, I enjoyed the beer, and it is definitely a classic of the dubbel style."
"Good beer but a bit similar to a billion other dark Belgians. I liked it better than Chimay White or Blue (though I haven't had a 2+ years aged Blue yet..)"
"This time from a 330ml brown bottle bought at the SAQ (I also drank the 750ml Première version) Copper with a beige head in appearence. A bit hazy, some sediment in the bottle. Spicy on the nose with some yeast. This beer is complex with some nice spices,good malt. Easy drinking for 7,0% alc. I love this beer."
"D - Rather surprised and defintiely lived up to its expectations. Fitting of its ratings and highly recommended to any fan of a spice dominated Belgian."
"I will buy it again someday. I recommend it to anyone - whether you know the style or not. Quite good, just not amazing... like my dear Réserve."
"Try the Chimay Red with red meat, grilled poultry, rich or funky cheeses, meaty pasta, chocolate cake, nachos, or lasagna. Most importantly though, try it on its own!"
"Mouthfeel is surprisingly light and smooth. Only the high ABV keeps this from sessionable territory. Don't let any yeast get in the glass."
"Flavor follows the aroma perfectly. Raisins, figs, and dates...belgian yeasts, mildly malty. Medium body, high carbonation, low booze feel in the mouth...very drinkable! Chimay makes great beer, there's no doubt about it! I've had this beer numerous times before this review...and will continue to drink it because it never lets me down!"
"Overall, I've had better dubbels, but I might give this one another shot."
"Carbonation is low, especially for the style. Probably the first time I've said a Belgian doesn't have enough carbonation actually."
"The flavors are all quite subtle and balanced in this. Wonderful to sip and just roll around.It's a little foamy but not overwhelming like some other abbey ales. All in all, you just can't go wrong with this one."
"Smell is perhaps reminiscent of dried fruits The taste is sweet, but nicely balanced with some bitterness, but just enough that the hops don't overcome all other flavours. I could drink this all day long. Really one of the top, top beers."
"(D)- A solid example of the Dubbel style. Has everything you would expect from the style. Not harsh, overcarbonated, or boozy; in fact, this is rather smooth. A definite staple that I look for when reaching for a good Dubbel. An easy drinker for the style too. Cant really go wrong with any trappist brew."
"D- I would rate this as highly drinkable because of the relatively low abv for a Belgian and it still has a great Belgian taste."
"D- With the low ABV and high taste, I could drink this beer all night long. One of my favorites to date. An exceptional gift to my palate."
"god i love this beer. i've been sampling many many many belgians trappist/abbey ales and american versions of that style over the last few years and this is one of the best. it's kind of the perfect belgian dubble. if you don't already know what a belgian trappist tastes like then my review (slim as it is) isn't going to help you anyways. so either trust me or don't, but there's a reason why this has an A rating from not just me."
"This beer is very impressive in its bottle. Popped the top and poured it into a large pils glass, only thing I had at the time. I like the Chimay beers pretty cool. This particular species has a lot of rich fruit flavor and is very drinkable even though it has a higher ABV. I think that the overall richness of the beer must be enjoyed with some desert or something sharp like a hard cheese. Definitely try this awesome Trappist!"
"D: Pretty drinkable, this is a big full bodied, full flavored beer with a medium amount of abv that is a classic example of a dubbel."
"I thought I was opening a bottle of Champaign, it foamed like a volcano, so I quickly poured it into my favorite glass and truly enjoyed a very good beer. I remember it was expense, so I don't know if I would buy it again, but will look for it on the shelves when I go to Goodie number 3 in Dallas."
"Pours a muddy orange brown with a wonderful almond head full of fine bubbles. The head slowly recedes but remains as a thin layer on top of the beer for quite some time and leaves no lace. The aroma is full of spice from the yeast as well as the aroma of dried cherries, raisins, bready malt, some woodiness and brown sugar. The flavor is mostly malty with a nice fruitiness and a sort of cherry/prune thing going on. Brown sugar is also evident, as is some dark, bready malt, earthy hop notes, some leather and a clove/cinnamon spice from the yeast. This beer is wonderfully balanced, so well balanced in fact that a quick sip would lead one to think this is one dimensional, but the more I slowly enjoy this goblet, the more nuances seem to surface. The mouthfeel is medium, with carbonation that I wish was a little bit more subdued, but it's not a deal breaker. Very drinkable and enjoyable. Probably my favorite of all of the Chimay offerings."
"It is very drinkable. I will drink this beer as often as I can afford to."
"Don't drink this cold! It provides little taste or smell while cold. This beer as most should sit and warm to fully smell, taste, and sense everything that's going on."
"drink: I wish I had some great cheese to have with this cause it would pair perfectly. but i guess 'undrinkability' should be how well i can drink it, well in that case, i would love more of this."
"mouthfeel is sweet and creamy but still feels a little thin.. makes it more drinkable, excellent balance, not something i would seek out, but easy to drink and fairly enjoyable"
"O: More malty than the white and I prefer it over the white- but to each his own. Rather expensive but perhaps fair for the style. A beer I buy very occasionally and would only care to drink occasionally."
"Pours a nice reddish brown color with thin cap of off-white head, leaving a nice cap and good lacing. Scent is of fresh yeast bread, light brown sugar, a touch of fruit, spice and alcohol. Taste brings a nice, straightfoward combination of the lightly sweet and bready malts, belgian yeasts are present but not overpowering, mild spicing and light dark dried fruit (prune) tastes as well as a kiss of alcohol. Medium bodied, nicely carbonated, no lingering tastes. A nice, mild dubbel."
"Drinkability - a substantial brew but easy to drink I could definitely drink a couple of these"
"Overall/notes: While not as good as their tripel, this is a very good beer. I found this at a surprisingly affordable price, and sprung at the opportunity. Money well-spent, I say."
"Drinkability is good. This is a flavorful well crafted beer."
"D. I was a bit disappointed with the taste after the incredible smell, but the mouthfeel is really what let me down here. Something this beautiful should be thick and luscious. Even so, this is a real treat and I'll enjoy the others that I have stocked away."
"A nice drinkable beer, but perhaps a tad overrated."
"D/M: Very drinkable and smooth, I like this beer, especially for a dubbel, I prefer it to the blue."
"Nice balance, but a bit thin. I could see where it pairs with food rather than trying to stand on it's own."
"Pours cloudy light brownish-red. Aromas of fig, cherry, with bready notes. Flavor is dry with mild clove notes; more bread effects. A thin and wet feel. Chimay's basic offering: if you want the real deal, go for the blue or white: much more in the flavor department."
"jd"
"D: This beer is complex, and needs to be enjoyed slowly. It is quite tasty!"
"Have had this before in the 33cl variety and liked it previously. This time however first drink was so-so, second was almost off the chart. I got nothing from the first glass but with the second the characteristics really started to shine through; the scent and taste both became very prominent (glad I'm reviewing a 75 and not a 33). Probably the best example of this style that I've had but this does strike me as a more modern take on the format than others - doesn't really feel like a beer brewed for monks. Either way it's great!!"
"A pillar of the beer world, what can you say?"
"Excellent beer - I will definitely be drinking this again."
"Have had both on tap and out of the bottle and it's always best out of the bottle. Seems to hold its flavor better."
"drinkability - this drinks fairly smoothly"
"Nice dark pour, full bodied, full flavored. Has a nice amount of foam, light and fluffy qualities to it but also has a nice malty flavor to it. Taste the yeast heavily and it gives a great quality to the beer, subtly sweet. I have only had a few Belgians since I started reviewing, but comparing this to them and against all other beers I think this was excellent, very easy drinking and refreshing but has alot of flavor at the same time. I will definitely try more."
"A very nice beer overall. Has a lot of flavor, and it's all well balanced. I don't know why I waited so long to finally try this one, I have been missing out on a top notch beer. One I would gladly have again."
"Notes: Vintage 2009. This was a bit lighter and subtler Dubbel. The flavors were enjoyable even though it didn't taste like other Dubbels I have had. Overall it was an enjoyable beer that I would gladly drink again. It didn't blow me away, but it was somewhat unique."
"Feels smooth, very easy to drink. Carbonation seems to be a bit lacking, though this bottle has been sitting around for awhile. Other than that, I would certainly enjoy having this again."
"This is the best Belgian Ale for making Carbonnade (Belgian beef stew). The sweetness and strong malt flavors are right for this dish. Ingredients are stew beef, browned onions, olive oil, garlic, chicken broth, beef broth, Belgian Ale, thyme, bay leaf and cider vinegar."
"If you want the best of breed, Westmalle Dubbel (although more expensive) is in fact a superior beer. Chimay is solid and worth a try, it just won't blow you away."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with lively carbonation with a crisp dry finish."
"Drinkability is high on this one, and I will get this again (although I seem to prefer the blue bottle more)."
"He shoots.... HE SCORES!!!"
"D: Great drinkability. Very refreshing and easy to drink. Alcohol is pleasantly masked."
"Drinkability: This one is a classic and yet is so complex. The alcohol is well hideen and I could have several glasses. Hits all the high points of the style."
"This is a very tasty, well balanced easy drinking beer. Would go great with an expensive dinner out on the town."
"D: IMO one of the best beers in the world! So well balanced and amazingly complex. Very drinkable at 7% ABV!"
"Drinkability: Its a good dubbel, with a lot of smell and flavor complexity, but I don't love all of the flavors (too much sour yeast taste in the finish). Its been a year or two since I've had one of these, and I've had many better dubbels in the interim."
"D : Well I had a whole 750ml bottle so I'd say pretty damn good. the amount of carbonation is a little too much, But I can't dock for that."
"Drinkability: As noted above, it had been a long time since I had tried this Chimay iteration. It was less complex than I recalled, but certainly not lacking in character. Probably the perfect beer to have started with years ago because although it promises hints of the complexity shared by its more complicated and sometimes difficult Belgian cousins, nothing in this beer is in your face. Refreshing, and a welcome beer to revisit from time to time."
"D: Very refreshing and smooth. Had a lot of the same flavors and characteristics of the blue, but much more mellower and softer. Could certainly drink a couple of these and they went well with the buttery cheese of Chimay."
"M/D: Lighter to medium body. Lots of very fine carbonation bubbles. Slightly smooth mouthfeel. Great drinkability. Very refreshing and easy to drink quickly, but I feel it should be savored."
"I shouldn't be surprised, but I am. I just don't remember enjoying this beer so much. It way more than exceeded my high expectations. This sample is delightful, going bye-bye way faster than I want it to."
"Drinkability: Decent Dubbel that, in my opinion, does not live up to its Trappist reputation. Still pretty tasty though."
"Great brew. Recommend."
"D: I wouldn't want more than 750 mL in a sitting."
"I enjoyed this while sitting in a park in Tokyo on a warm spring day. Delicious - I look forward to trying it again along with the other offerings from Bières de Chimay."
"I poured my bottle into a Chimay Chalice. It poured a ruddy, cloudy brown with a tan head that disappeared quickly. The nose has a bit of raisin bread, lemony citrus and spice. The taste has a bit of caramel malt, banana, dried fruit, and spice. The mouthfeel is especially fantastic on this one. It has a nice crisp carbonation that cuts straight through the richness of this beer. This is highly drinkable and refreshing for a darker beer, the carbonation does it. I've thought of red as getting the least respect of Chimay's outstanding line up which is truly saying something about the quality of this brewer."
"Medium bodied with bready malt and well balanced brown sugar sweetness. Was very effervescent at first but the Co2 quickly mellowed to the level of just slightly refreshing. Takes on a French toast character towards the end. The finish is where the alcohol warmth comes in, along with a distinct dried orange peel flavor."
"I enjoyed this beer in a snifter glass and with some good mellow and earthy cheese...Chimay has their own brand of cheese but have yet to find it in stores...I recommend Beemster...or Gouda...let the cheese (not the beer !) get to room temp to really appreciate."
"Drinkability - The only thing hindering the drinkability it my relatively low alcohol tolerance. Its not exactly heavy but its not something I can drink as quickly as I want to. The price is also somewhat prohibitive. I can only score the beer itself though, and for drinkability it is about as drinkable as any beer I've ever come across."
"The taste is sweet and complex with a layer of mellow fruitiness that comes off as banana and apricots to me. With that is the earthy spiciness that I wish I could describe better. Over all this is a classic and easy drinking beer, and one of the first non BMCs I tried. I imagine there's a better version of this tasty brew, but this is still delicious. The mouth feel is rich and thick."
"Drinkability: One or two is about good at a time as it is an ale to be appreciated and not to consume in great quantities."
"D: It's very easy to consume, and becomes even easier as it warms up and becomes sweeter."
"Drinkability - The more I drink this and let it warm up, the sweeter it becomes. This takes down on the Drinkability for me, but overall I'm glad I was able to try this. Now on to its blue brother!"
"This is good but not my favorite type. I would definitely have more of this beer, but wouldn't seek it out."
"This, my second favorite Chimay, is super approachable and easy to drink"
"A few persistent foam and a slightly fruity nose (fig and red fruit) and sweet, especially candy. The palate is quite soft and silky but even if the palace reminds the roasted malt, we found a body with a little light level flavors. The finish follows this approach, it offers little bitter and very few flavors that, in addition, do not stay long in the mouth. Note, however, a little more acidity in 75cl or nitro-bottles. A beer that serves as an initiator in the way of Chimay beers."
"D: Good to try but don't know how many of these I could drink in a sitting. A little too dry and bitter."
"D - Surprisingly drinkable and thank god for that. The abv is completely hidden and it's middling in the first place. I could drink 3 or 4 of these. Expensive though."
"Overall: This is one of those beers that every beer lover should try. It isn't my favorite ale, but it is a good representation of the Dubbel style."
"D - due to its mildness and lack of bitterness or after taste, I bet you could drink a lot of these without realizing it. I would just rather have something a little not noticeable."
"One of the more well-refined beers I've ever had and an absolute pleasure to drink. You can't drink it that fast, but you're not supposed to. Sit back and enjoy."
"Poured into a Chimay goblet. Pours an almost reddish, almost brown colour with a thin head that doesn't go away. Lacing down the glass. Smells of the yeast and a sweet caramel with some fruit. The taste is of prune and some sweet caramel malt. It is very smooth. While this is still a great beer, I think I used to like this a lot more. I'm not sure if it is because I've had several other dubbels since having this last, or if my tastes have just changed. The taste is just a little bit thinner than I remember."
"Pours a rich, creamy head that lasts the entire drink. Body is dark amber/brown. Head is an off white colour. Aromas of spices, plums, some rum, and fruit. Taste is fruit, floral, rum, prunes. FInishes with spices in the aftertaste, smooth and full bodied. This is my second re-rate of this beer. FOr some reason as of late, it seems to be almost watery. Still really good, but not as good as I had first thought"
"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a chimay glass. Pours a murky dark brown with a nice full head that dissipates to a thin layer. Held up to the light you can see the yeast sediment. The smell is of light clove, prunes, and yeasty fresh baked bread. The taste is of raisins, prunes, a light spice in the background (maybe like black pepper). The aftertaste is of yeasty bread. The mouthfeel is medium at first, but finishes a little thin. Lots of carbonation, but that's a biproduct of the refermentation. After having one, I definitely wouldn't mind another. This a unique beer experience."
"I like this beer a lot and will pick some up occasionally. I prefer it to the Blue."
"This is one of the worse trappist beers and a terrible dubbel. Westmalle, westy and achel destroy this."
"drinkability is great - there are downsides/upsides from the aging but overall fresh/aged this beer is world class"
"D – It is spectacular for pairing with food, especially spicy food."
"Drinkability: While not being too strong, this beer has some really nice complexity, and truly brings something new to the table. The beer didn't have a strong aroma. There was a lot I really liked in this beer, and I think my score is a little lower than I actually feel it should be, due to the weight of the categories."
"Taste toasty and roasted. Nice thick belgian malt and caramel layers. Funky plum and sticky apple toward the end. A slight hop dry finish"
"Serving type: bottle"
"I've had this beer before but not in this light. Just an excellent Trappist ale."
"On the palate the beer seems as if it would be full-bodied if it weren't for the lively carbonation. Good balance between the two. Despite the level of carbonation, a lingering matte bitterness remains on the finish."
"I think this is a great beer, probably my favorite of the Chimay's. Way to go monks!"
"I could almost guzzle this. The carbonation slows you down only a bit. The biggest slowdown was having to stop and type this review."
"Notes: This is a nice balanced dubbel. Cheers."
"Very nice tan two finger head after a balanced pour. But for this Dubbel, there is only a small puddle of foam for retention. The bers colir maes me think of rust and Wonderbread crust. Pretty good coloring despite my comparison to others of its style. The arom has heavy toasted to medium roasted malts along with some toasted, Carribean plantane and brown sugar concoction aroma. But pretty initing and enticing. The tast is super balanced and well carbonated. Toasted and lighlt roasted malts add lots of flavor characters to tghe OHHH SOOO Belgan beer. Medium tastes of soft cherries and very mild tobacco. Great carbonation even though you can't see it. Its no wonder this beer and brewery keep getting such high ratings."
"Altogether this is an enjoyable brew, but there are better ones out there..."
"Strangely delicious, and very easy to drink. Fantastic."
"D: A very good beer; easy to drink but yet still complex. Wish there was less carbonation, though."
"D: A bit too sweet for my liking, yet this is very true to its style. Belgian flavors dominate, delivering a nice dessert like quality to this beer. Would certainly pair well with some ice cream or a fruit tart. Sipping is recommended here."
"Drinkability is stellar. Like all of Chimay's beers, you walk away from one glass wanting another immediately, no matter the abv. Excellent flavor, subtle, complex, delicious, and not wearing in the slightest."
"Poured to a frothy mugfull. Aromatic and a delight to the smell. Was a little put off by the amount of head that the ale put into the glass. But the taste and great flavor of this ale makes up for the glassfull of froth. I highly recommend this ale....even with the pricetag behind it. Well worth the money invested into this bottle."
"This is a very nice Belgian beer. Full flavored with a nice richness to it. The carbonation is little high, but otherwise very nice drinkable beer."
"somehow i missed another great belgian, and this one is probably the best belgian i've ever had, and i've had westvlerten. it has a beauitful cloudy amber color with a alot of carbonation, smell is awesome, has a wonderful yeast body to it, along with sweet malt, just a great overall aroma. the taste is so good it could legally make this beer considered a controlled subject and be subject to various ATF laws, its that good, its a perfect balance of yeast, malt and hops. this beer has no flaws, its what every other beer has dreams of being."
"Small bottle pours a dark hazy red with gushing foam on the bottle opening. The taste is very smooth with a finish of dark fruits and a little nuttyness in there too. No indication of the alc % at all in this one. A very solid dubbel. Glad it was included with the chimay gift pack. Would consider this one again."
"Drinkability is decent. Maybe two or three of these bottles could be downed. The only downside would be the carbonation level. I would probably get bloated after a couple. Overall this is pretty much what i expected. Nothing earth shattering. A pretty decent Belgian. I'm curious to try the other two Chimays in the upcoming days."
"This is hands down my favorite Belgian Ale . First time I had this it was in my cooler for a year . Had not had a Belgian yet , was afraid of the dark I guess . Poured a beautiful dark cloudy amber color that looked amazing . Smelled of dark dried fruits and a bit bready . Tastes like heaven in a goblet to me , have not yet had it's equal . Just a slight bitterness which I like , not to hoppy at all . When I get near the bottom of the bottle I swirl it to loosen the yeasty sediment and pour it into my glass . I just love the cloudy look in my beer glass and the taste in my mouth . This is what I've been told a Belgian Dubbel is supposed to be . Definitely prefer this to the other 2 Chimay brews . I currently have a full case cellaring in my basement and may soon have another if I can keep from drinking it ."
"My--and most of our--initiation to the wonderful world of Belgian brews. Readily available, and while it is not ""best of breed"" it is certainly head and shoulders above most of its peers, produced in Belgium or elsewhere. You will not regret enjoying one--or more--of these classics."
"Above average drinkability."
"Am I the only one but in the Red in all the complexity of flavor I do taste hints of cranberry but I see no one else notices this. Anyway this is a must try beer and brewery for anyone serious about great beers."
"Notes: This was my first authentic Belgian Abbey Ale, and also the maltiest Belgian beer I've had. I wasn't sure quite what to expect, but it turns out it's delicious! Those monks know how to brew right! I will be coming back to this and also seeking out more Dubbels (and eventually Tripels and Quads)."
"D: There's a reason Dubbel is my favorite beer style. Something about the beer meets red wine thing really appeals to me. Chimay Red is a perfect example of this style. Very refined and well thought out in execution. A classic beer I'm glad I finally revisited."
"I actually like this quite a bit, I haven't ever tried a beer like it. It's not one of the top beers I've tried but there are no noticeable flaws. For a Belgian this is very drinkable."
"I was very excited to try Chimay, and it didn't disappoint. I poured a nice reddish brown, with light foamy head. The head didn't just go away either, it lingered throughout. Chimay Red is a very flavorful beer, it's hard to pinpoint just one flavor. There is definitely some spice in this brew. It isn't very sweet, but isn't bitter either. Chimay is a very good beer and everyone should have the chance to try it at least once."
"D: Often overlooked but a great beer. Have not had one in quite a while. Not quite up to Rochefort or a Westy 8 but a damn fine example and a great gateway beer."
"D- Everything is in place and easy to drink. I thought this would be a sipper but I find myself downing mouthfuls. Another fine attempt by the Belgians to get me drunk."
"It was my first Chimay, and I had pretty high expectations. In the end I have found Tripel and Blue to be far superior."
"D-- Feels bigger than ABV really is. Dark, warm and inviting and a great sipping beer that is smaller than a lot of other Belgians and at times has more character. Not as sweet as other versions but in a way that is what makes this more unique. Very tasty and very sessionable if you want a more of a spice driven beer."
"Again, Chimay has the carbonation down pat. It's the perfect amount for this type of ale IMO. Medium body with a slightly dry finish. Superb drinkability."
"A nicely balanced, tasty sipper, not too heavy - a good thing I forced myself to slow down and appreciate it, when the urge to pound it back after another hectic prep day was strong."
"This may be my least favorite of the Chimays, but overall it is a highly recommended beer."
"Very nice...wishing that I had sprung for the big bottle"
"D: Pretty tasty stuff. A 750 ml bottle would have hit the spot."
"Mouthfeel is incredibly smooth, with the creamy cap of foam included in every sip. The body feels very light for a relatively big beer, with not much of an impact on the finish except for a yeasty coating. After a short time, the beer seems to get a little flat, probably thanks to the trappist logo etched on the bottom of the glass."
"The coming days i will try some more of the Chimay brand."
"D- Wonderful. It was a good, full-flavored sipper. The alcohol was well hidden, but keeps you in check as you finish the glass. It's definitely a dubbel I'd drink again."
"The pouring results in long-lived light tan head atop of hazy coppery fluid with reddish depth. Head slowly dies out until a thin soapy film is all what is left. Malty (not sweet!) aroma, unburnt toast, raisins, hint of plum and perfumy almost rose-like alcohol.The flavor profile is malty although far less sweet than expected - more alike of bitter caramel, with raisins, toasty bread crust bitterness and soft alcohol leading into dry finish. As with Chimay White the individual characteristics are somehow indecisive and I can't easily pinpoint at any although they are clearly delimited. However, the beer is very well balanced and refined with individual flavors/aromas in tune with each other. Medium bodied, medium carbonated. This dubbel is not nearly as fruity as that of Achel or Westmalle but it was the red friar that once introduced me into Trappist ale world and ignited my curiosity about other monastic brews, so Chimay Red , I owe you so much."
"There is a reason this is an expensive beer. It is that good. I have yet to find a dubbel that I enjoy going back to time and time again except this one. Excelent mouthfeel as it coats and warms your tounge. Great aroma. An unfiltered beer at its finest."
"Give it a try, especially if you like belgian beers, or Hoegaarden. I think this beer is a bit complex for me, but what do I know? =]"
"Value: I wish I could afford these all the time. Chimay Red is an awesome brew but definitely too expensive."
"Drinkability: A great beer. I can't wait to try the others in the Chimay line-up. This will definitely become on of my favorites."
"Drinkability: Give me more."
"Reddish light amber, appears cloudy, could be a bit of chill haze, minimal white head, quick dissipation, a bit of lacing but not much. Fruity esters dominate the nose, pears, mangos, peaches. The taste is also quite fruity, with golden raisin and sweet and bready malts in addition to the flavors isolated in the nose. Despite careful handling, I had quite a bit of suspended yeast, which may have thrown the taste off a bit. Decent carbonation in mouthfeel, the finish is quite interesting, I picked up a good amount of leather and tobacco. Pretty drinkable, the ABV is quite well hidden. To be honest, my least favorite of the Chimay line, though it had an interesting and memorable finish."
"Drinkability is where this beer shines. The lack of alcohol taste for such a potent brew is amazing. This is a beer I could drink on any occasion and regularly although at $13 for a 25.4 oz bomber I don't think my checkbook would appreciate it."
"Overall, an excellent dubbel and also my favourite out of the three Chimay's I've had. This beer completely out-shined the Maredsous 8 I had a few days ago and really made me appreciate the style."
"Chimay red pairs well with pretty much any cheese or food and is one of the most impressive beers I have ever tasted. It's understated, yet unique character allows you to really enjoy it anytime...anywhere!"
"D - very good, quite an enjoyable beer but not as complex as others such as Chimay Grand Reserve (Blue), altough this is due to style"
"Nice belgian fizzy mouthfeel and drinkability is very high for the style."
"d- chimay premiere is very popular for a reason, it's a very tasty dubbel that i'll be indulging in again for sure, i've got a 25.4oz-er spending some time in the cellar. now onto blue and white.."
"Chimay Red is not quite on par with Chimay Blue, but it is unquestionably a classic beer. It just doesn't have the pizzazz or complexity of say...a Westvleteren 8. The nose isn't quite as strong and the flavor doesn't stand out as much. But, it is damn good and is certainly a beer that every BA should have the opportunity to review. It's a classic in that sense. If you haven't tried it by now, you should."
"Pours a dark straw color that quickly turns into an opaque burgundy with the unfiltered yeast being present. Smells of modest spices with a hint of orange. The taste is almost nothing like the smell - much more nuttier with plenty of malt to go along with it. Certainly an ample amount of carbonation that complements a creamy feel. Without a doubt another crowning achievement by the Trappist monks of the Chimay Brewery."
"Part of a gift pack poured into Chimay chalice that was provided. Rich hazy amber color with reddish highlights. Thick bubbly head that quickly disapates into a film with no real lacing. Rich aroma of fruit and spice plus alcohol. Taste not as intense as the blue, very enjoyable still rich in dark fruit and spices and alcohol can still be tasted. Another beer to be sipped."
"D: A nice smooth and rather drinkable Dubbel. I like Chimay Red a little more than Ommegang Abbey Ale, which I guess makes it one of the best Dubbel's I've had. Dubbel isn't my favorite style, but this is a great brew worthy of the Chimay name nonetheless."
"Wow, totally not what I remembered. This beer is great, a little yeasty with great spice character and nice full body. Beer's drinkability is high and mouthfeel is great. There is a specific sweetness to this that I really appreciate. Second taste, seriously this is a great Belgian ale. The bitterness is not as obvious as I once thought but now there is a great flavor of bready yeast that adds to the total profile of the beer. A truly wonderful beer experience."
"Drinkability is pretty good, particularly with food. Have the white as an appretif, and then the blue for desert."
"D - easy to spend a lot of money enjoying this beer. I could drink more than neither my liver nor my wallet should allow"
"Mouthfeel is smooth and soft, while still managing to be forthright and pronounced. This dubbel never strikes a false note and it might just be the most drinkable of the Chimay brand."
"Overall- Not as sweet or tart as I was expecting."
"Pours to a deep red color with a thick head that laces well. There is a sweet aroma and first scent was of apples and cherries and of course yeast. There is a deep flavor of apples and maybe a dark fruit or two. It almost has a really hard apple cider kind of characteristic, without being a hard cider. Also deep in the background there is a slight coffee like flavor."
"First rate!"
"Overall - One of my faves"
"Overall, a good beer and I'm glad I gave it a second go around since I could appreciate it more this time. Definitely give this one a try!"
"D: Warming but not too big. I enjoyed it."
"D-very tasty and a decent mouthfeel make it relatively easy drinking, not a huge amount of alcohol so i could have several and still be good to go!"
"Opaque burgundy-brown, with a thin but dense creamy tan head. The aroma has a dry, fruity malt sweetness and a somewhat earthy character. The flavor has notes of sweet raisins, chocolate, earthy yeastiness, and there's a bit of a spicy finish. Very effervescent, but still quite drinkable."
"with Chimay i am never disappointed."
"D: Carbonation seems a bit high, but it's good none the less. Very tasteful and would drink again at some point."
"This one lives up to the hype, it is such a Balanced beer there are no flavors that are over bering, sometimes i find that the Belgian yeasts over power the other flavors in the beer not here. it starts off smooth and finishes smooth, this was a enjoyable brew."
"Drinkability is stupendously (and dangerously) good. I could drink this non stop until the moon escapes earth orbit."
"Smooth, dark golden-brown, great lace, med-short head dissipating quickly. Sediment is abound. Taste is supurb sweetness dark fruit, zero bitterness, toasted grains and resin, faint chocolate plum honey. This beer has a bit less satisfying taste than the blue."
"A Belgian beer staple."
"D- Another great beer from this brewery; very enjoyable."
"I highly recommending giving this beer a chance if your not a Trappist beer expert, if you are, then you already know this is a nice brew..."
"Pours a nice burnished copper color with some very nice foamy head; no lacing at all. Great scent, very sweet and funky with nice malt tones and a hint of cherries. Sweet and sour taste; great maltiness with a slight fruit and esteryness to it; lasting tart flavor on the tongue. Smooth with a slightly funky finish. Great Trappist ale!"
"D - Pretty good drinkability for a Belgian dubbel. Chimay beers are great all in all, that's exactly why they are so popular amongst beer lovers and connoisseurs."
"Drinkis great a little of the hot alcohol is apparent so probably not a great session beer but a definite must taste."
"D- The alcohol levels are nearly undetectable. It finishes clean, is not cloying and is very well balanced. Good drinkability here."
"Tough to knock a standard like this, but should say that I enjoyed the Ommegang and Corsendonk versions of this style much more. Good, but nothing to get excited about."
"One of my all-time favorites. I love abbey dubbels, and this has got to be the best one I've ever tried. Simply delicious and something every beer drinker should try! Full of ripe esters and wonderful complex malt and yeast characteristics. Pours with a luxurious head."
"D- High. I drank this one slow, but that's due to the robust and full flavors that demand to be enjoyed, savored, and explored. A very good beer."
"Great Belgian style - worth the try if you're interested in the genre."
"It is official. This is one of the greatest beers I've ever tasted. There's no harsh characteristics about it. It's purely art in a bottle, that an artist has blended into a masterpiece."
"I liked this beer with out doubt and will drink it again in the future. Great taste really helps its cause and I can't wait for a refresher course in Chimay 101. I remember liking the blue Chimay the best but that was a while ago so I can't wait too see if my taste has changed"
"Salud!"
"This one was pretty easy to drink, nothing to extreme or over-the-top. Just a well made dubbel that IMHO isn't exactly worthy of it's hype, although not a bad beer in the end."
"Final Thoughts: Certainly a ""champagne"" beer that is only to be brought out for special occasions. All in all, a good experience but it strikes me as a bit of a high class drinker. Certainly worth a try, and I would never turn it down. This could go very well with an expensive dinner."
"Mouthfeel/Drink: Very drinkable, hop bitterness and sweetness are well balanced."
"330mL bottle poured into a Chimay goblet. Cloudy copper color with not much head. There is a nice sweet smell of raisins, molasses, and yeast. Medium mouthfeel and flavor is of fruits, malt, and yeast. There is a bit of bitterness to balance it out. This is quite drinkable at 7% abv. Overall a great dubbel."
"Probably one of the easiest to find out of the Belgian Trasppist Ales. The pour is a cloudy amber color with a fairly large head light colored . Slightly spicy and malty nose. Dark fruity flavors with a deep roasted malt. Fairly complex and well balanced."
"Pours reddish brown into a Chimay glass. Smells of yeast and dried fruit. Taste is much the same. Silky smooth mouthfeel that ends with a carbonated bite. Drinkability is high at 7% ABV. A tropical storm has caused it to rain all day. Just found a lizard running around the house. But all is good after a few of these."
"poured from a 750 ml bottle to a goblet the color was amber/brown with nice head the smell was fruity and spicy with yeast and malt...the taste was fruit with clove and cinnamon with a yeast taste some currant fruits this is a easy dubbel to drink and its tasty a good one to bring to a dinner party"
"This wasn't at all the wow beer I was expecting."
"D: Very drinkable and very enjoyable. Flavors here are so complex it challenges you to figure them all out."
"D: certainly smooth enough to session, but watch that ABV. Drinkability isn't a concern of mine when I sit down with this beer, and fortunately Chimay Red doesn't present any challenges in this regard. Cheers!"
"This is a great trappist for first timers. Not bottled conditioned like the others so the flavor is more tame. This beer still has a nice molasses flavor. You can taste a little fruitiness which is picked up on the nose. Lots of malt. Great ale that has more drinkability than most of the same genre."
"Overall a good solid beer, plenty of flavour. Worth every penny."
"D: Highly drinkable. ABV only 7% and extremely well hidden. A classic dubbel, but not the best out there."
"Overall, I really like this dubbel. I think there are probably some out there with a bit more character and intensity (and definitely a longer finish), however, this is a great introduction to the style, and will always be a classic. I'm thinking of pairing this with a nice cut of pork tenderloin, with a red wine/persimmon reduction sauce -- sounds pretty good to me..."
"D: Wow, this is an excellent Dubbel. Definitely goes down easy with hardly any trace of alcohol. Something I could sip on all night if I had the opportunity."
"Absolutely worth a try, even two if you don't enjoy it the first time. I can only imagine how good it would be on-tap."
"This beer just looked pretty as I poured it. A really nice rich brown color and nutty malt aroma. The head was exceptionally foamy, but not in a bad way. The taste was really spicy, but had a champagne like taste to it with a bitter finish. As you'd expect with champagne, this beer had a sharpness to it and the carbination was a bit bubbly. There was some sweetness too, but it was not overpowering. I'd get this beer again for a special occasion."
"Poured into a chalice, a nice reddish-brown hue, with two fingers of off-white head that laced spottily. The smell was a mix of maltiness, caramel, raisins, dates, wet leaves, woodiness, biscuit, and yeast. The flavor was a very nice blend, starting with the dark fruit, ending with some dry woodiness, and brimming with maltiness throughout. The alcohol was well-hidden, and the aftertaste was a little spicy. The mouthfeel was very smooth, but not as carbonated as I had expected. Certainly a very good dubbel, but I wouldn't judge it best in show."
"Tatses perfectly balanced, very drinkable, not too sweet. The alcohol is well masked. The beer has a slighty bitter finish, but it blends in perfectly."
"I used to be really impressed with this beer, but I've come to realise that its not the star I once thought it was, and it shouldn't share company with St. Bernardus and Westvleteren as one of the better examples of the style."
"Overall, this is a damn tasty brew with enough complexity to keep you interested for awhile. Great example of the style"
"T-Started off much breadier than I imagined, some chewiness dominated until the end, then some crazy fruit variety with a citrus sting in the finish, got a little sweeter as time went by and went from being a little dry to more crispy, would have liked to see less of the sugary accents and more of the neutral malt to take over, still very good, taste changed a lot over time, fruit gave it something extra throughout, not too sweet which I was happy about"
"Pours a cloudy caramel brown with a full head that fades very quickly into a thin crown, and then into nothingness shortly thereafter. My nose was rudely interrupted by my wife spraying potpourri, but I caught hints of fruit and sweetness. Taste is very enjoyable - dark fruits, sweetness and generous carbonation. No bitterness whatsoever. Mouthfeel is medium - I could do with a little less carbonation, but it doesn't really hurt the brew. Exceedingly drinkable - the alcohol is very well masked."
"330 ml. bottle. Cloudy brown colour, with a head that dissipates too quickly and leaves almost no lace. Smells of dark fruits, caramel, spices. Body is a bit watery, and mouth has again cark fruits, plums, caramel and some spices. It's a bit of a deception to me when compared to Chimay Blue or White, everything is too soft. I may have to review again when I have another bottle, better the big one."
"D- Nice full flavor and easily accessible."
"On a side note, I have to be honest this underwhelms/disappoints me a bit especially compared to the tripel, and strong dark Belgian. Definitely good, just not up to my expectations I guess."
"My first Chimay. It is a wonderful brew.... with all the fruitiness it is almost wine like but it is a Classic Belgian Monk Brew.... a must try !!! Cannot wait to tap my White & Blue !!"
"D - this one is definitely one of the better beers I've ever had. however, i'd rate it a step or two below Chimay Blue."
"D- Overall this is a great representation of the style. Goes down great without the slightest hint of the 7.0%ABV."
"This is a great beer overall and quite drinkable for the style. As I reviewed this beer I found the bottom of the glass much sooner than I usually do. Chimay never fails to impress."
"Jordan."
"Overall, very good with a decent body and a nice flavor balanced between the clove, malt and yeast flavors. Alcohol is well hidden."
"I Can't wait to try the Reserve."
"wow this is good beer i poured this off into a widemouth glass and it took about ten minutes to pour! wow any man loves head like that thick white and creamy lol! anyway i drank this so fast it was gone and i was off to get another already chilled!!!"
"Pours a reddish brown with a generous head that remains throughout the sampling. The aroma that I got was mildewy, although that was not a turnoff. The taste was clean, crisp and malty sweet. I reminded me of a super-carbonated Speckled Hen. Feel was medium bodied and heavily carbonated. Drinkability: while it doesn't sit heavy on the stomach, I wouldn't want much more than the bomber I opened."
"D - A little bit heavy for me for a double, but an enjoyable drink. Could not do a whole lot of these."
"M&D - Like I said, drier and easier to drink than I remember. I know it is made for sipping but I was thirsty and it was tasty and now it's gone. I want another one!"
"d - very good beer."
"Cheers!"
"I tried this beer several times when I first got into craft brews, and it wowed me with its complexity of flavors and smells. Since then, I've tried several other Belgian styles, DIPA's, and imperial stouts. It doesn't wow me anymore after trying many other strong styles of beer. I will still drink it from time to time though, as it is still a very good beer. And I've still got the white and the blue to review from the pack."
"Body is medium and carbonation is decent."
"Easily drinkable, and a truly enjoyable brew. Another score for chimay."
"Dangerously drinkable. Overall, a good beer. I think there are better dubbels out there though."
"Drinkability: even at 7 percent, this stuff goes down smooth like butter. I know I had Chimay red once a long time ago, but after this reintroduction I am going to have to be getting it a lot more often."
"Pours a deep cherry gold color with many visible floating sediments. Nice sized bubbling head with dried fruit aromas. The taste is of primarily dried fruit, almost tastes like a hoppy raisin. Good mouthfeel, very full bodied and smooth texture. This is a delicious beer and is very drinkable, I could have several in one sitting easily. As usual Chimay makes a great beer."
"Pours a cloudy, tan/brown color. One inch head of an off-white color. Great retention and great lacing. Smells of yeast, citrus, tart malt, and slight sweet malt. Fits the style of a Dubbel. Mouth feel is sharp and slightly crisp. High carbonation level and slight dryness along with high level of tart. Tastes of tart malt, citrus (banana), yeast, very slight hop, and slight sweet malt. Overall, not too tart, complex, easy drinkability, and good body."
"My least favorite Chimay by far. Not as complex, flavorful or easy drinking."
"Personally: Back when I was a young man (ok, ten years ago) I had my first bottle at the Ten Spot in Olde City and I was hooked. It opened the door to world of flavor and complexity that is Belgian beers. It is one of my desert island beers."
"D: A classic beer and a great example of the style. Full of flavor and great texture. I could drink these all day."
"My first Belgian. Thinking there'll be a much higher percentage of Belgianness in my future eh? Yes I think so. Want the blue Chimay first, more fruit there I hear."
"Pours a clear Reddish Brown, with super creamy, light tan head that fades fast. Very tiny carbonation bubbles. Smell is a hint of juicy malt. Taste is malty up front; caramel and oak wood and a hint of pepperyness. The middle is drying, and the finish is slightly bitter. Finishes very clean and dry as well. Mouthfeel is super rich and creamy, High, but smooth carbonation from the bottle conditioning. Drinkability is very good, an excellent example of a Dubbel, one of the first 'craft' beers I had long ago that brought me here. Expensive, but worth it every once in awhile."
"Has a appearance of a mix of a dark cider and caramel. The head dies quickly to about 2-3 mm and then lingers on to the end. Smells like a mix of spices and apples. The taste pretty much resembles the smell; a sense of spice mixed with a fruity and slightly sweet flavor. The flavors stand out more after sitting, so don't drink this right out of the fridge. It has just the right thickness and carbonation, not feeling too thin, and the bubbles tingle when you first drink it. No lingering bitterness to it either. Overall, one of my favorites."
"Drinkability: very complex aroma's and flavors. grand daddy of the belgian dubbels."
"D - This is a pretty good dubbel. I don't know if I would necessarily revisit this due to its price, but it was fun to try. Pretty drinkable at7% taboot."
"Good taste. Not like a usual dubbel.Less sweet than a normal dubbel.It starts off with a little sweetness,but not much,then a slight sourness and a hoppy finish. It has that typical Chimay flavour that you also find in the white and blue versions.(Perhaps the yeast?). I enjoyed this one, but I prefer the blue and white Chimay."
"A fairly easy drinker for a relatively big beer, and definitely a good and slightly cheaper alternative to it's bigger brother, but for me anyway it doesn't hang with some of the better dubbels around such as St. Bernardus's 8 and of course the King, Westy 8."
"Good full mouthfeel but very drinkable."
"Tastes like it smells: divine. Candy sugar, plum, cider spice, orange peel, ad infinitum."
"Picked this up as part of the Chimay 3 pack with the Chimay chalice. Being the lesser of the three beers (in terms of ABV) I decided to start with this one. Poured from the bottle into the Chimay chalice, beer is a very hazy, copper/light brown color with a standing, active head. There are small chunks of particulate that have settled to the bottom of the chalice. The biggest thing that hits my nose right away is the spicy phenols which reminds me of cloves. There is also a light fruitiness about it as well as very subtle hints of darker, roasted malts. The flavor also has the spicy phenols, but also a light fruity sweetness that reminds me of pears, apricots and white grapes. There is just a touch of bitterness to balance and a slightly solventy warming alcohol effect. A very complex beer. The mouthfeel is medium bodied, velvety with a slightly aggressive carbonation, formed by the bottle fermentation no doubt. Overall a drinkable beer but definitely one you want to sip and enjoy."
"Overall? Not bad. If you can find it for a reasonable price, keep on drinking it."
"D - well balanced and highly recommended"
"Notes - I got through the 750 ml bottle pretty well so I have to say this beer is drinkable."
"Drinkability: This is my least favorite of the chimays but still a really proper beer. The only thing off putting about it is the heavy body and slight bitterness. I actually prefer Ommegangs dubbel which is a faux Belgian over this. This is a sipping beer for sure."
"Medium bodied with small bubbly carbonation to keep it quaffably light."
"Pours a hazy brownish color with an off-white head that lasts the whole beer. Smells of clove, alcohol, belgian yeast, ripe dark fruits, and raisins. Incredibly smooth flavor....the clove and spice hits right up front followed by the bready yeast and raisin/fig and fruity flavors. The alcohol is barely noticable with a slight appearance. Again, finishes very, very smooth in the aftertaste. A nice spicy, full-bodied mouthfeel from the high carbonation. Leaves the mouth tingling long after the beer is gone which I think contributes to the lasting aftertaste. Extemely drinkable beer. One of the best I've had the pleasure of drinking...so far."
"D: The monks at the Trappist-monasteries sure know what it's all about. This is a fantastic beer - if you can get your hands on it - BUY it!!!"
"I chose the smaller 11.20 fluid ounce bottle so as not to go into permanent debt. I poured it into a Belgian tulip glass."
"d: A bit hot for its 7%, and the sweet nuttiness can be a bit cloying if drunk at too quick a pace."
"It has been a long time since I had a Chimay brew so I picked up a 33cl bottle of the Red and Blue for what I thought was a fairly decent price (turns out they were about $.70 more per bottle at the register than marked in the cooler, but that's another story). Since I really like Belgians, I was looking forward a great deal to drinking them. I poured the Premiere in a smallish wine glass and immediately liked the appearance. Reddish brown with a haze and had a nice aroma of bread and malt - a good sign to me. Then I tasted it - what a disappointment. First of all, it had a very thin mouthfeel to it, nothing at all like other Dubbel's I've recently had. Maybe that was a result of the carbonation, which seemed a bit over done. The actual taste? Well, there just wasn't much to it. At first I thought it was simply too cold, so I let it sit a bit with my had cupped around the bowl and periodically tasted it. It just never seemed to really change. The 33cl bottle filled my small glass about 1 and 3/4 times, so by the end of the second (partial) glass it could no longer be said to be ""cold"" - really just right for a Belgian Dubbel, IMO - but still not much in the way of flavor. Perhaps I got a bad bottle, or simply too old. With all the rave reviews of this beer, I was expecting much more. I am hoping the Blue will be better."
"Drinkability is great, I could sit and sip this all night. A great beer - nothing else to say."
"A very easy drinker that you can sip on during the evening hours to relax."
"Drinkability- pretty drinkable, I would drink more, very nice"
"I am not the biggest Belgian ale fan. But this one is pretty solid overall. Flavor is unique and malt centered with a nice, creamy body. Carbonation is not over the top like some Belgians I have had. I would drink it again. If you haven't had it yet, it is worth a look."
"D - Drinkable and enjoyable but Dubbel's aren't my favorite Belgium beers. Still a good choice."
"Pours a clouded brown with an orange tint. Thin creme head. Nose is male and sugar. Flavor is the same. Earthy overall tone. Very slight fig and fruit thing going on as well. Feel has a bit of a nipping carbonation. Liquid is thick enough. Slightly complex on this one. Certainly not boring. And definitely a reliable beer."
"D- easy to finish and almost low enough ABV to session. very nice. ill check this one out again. easily the benchmark for the style."
"Good beer but overrated. Probably the weakest variety of the Chimay brews, and Chimay is, in my opinion, the weakest of any of the Belgian/Dutch Trappist brews."
"Great beer!"
"This beer pours a cloudy dark amber color. The head is a firm one inch in height, and recedes very slowly into thorough lacing. The aroma is of dates, figs, hints of plums, faint star anise, and a soft malt undercurrent. It isn't the most robust aroma I've encountered in a Dubbel, but it is quite complex. The taste is more forthcoming than the aroma. There is a lot more anise, more malt, and ample fruit. The mouthfeel is on the a little fuller than medium bodied, with a lot of carbonation. Overall, this is a wonderful Dubbel that I will surely drink again."
"The first taste is great with a sort of spiciness and tang and then following up with a fruity and yeasty smooth feeling. The taste is very delicious and delighting. The mouthfeel of the brew has a light to medium body with a good amount of carbonation. Very drinkable and suitable for a nightly session. Another excellent product from Chimay."
"D - Not bad. I would really like to feel some hop backbone and a richer quaff."
"Drinkability- Its normally found in a 750ml bottle for a reason to share with friends. I am sad it took me this long to find it. I already thinking of excuses to pair it with food."
"Pours a rich brown color with a small tan head that settles to a thin cap. A little lacing is left on the glass. Has a sweet and slightly spicy aroma. Apples, plums, figs, cloves, phenols, and a little alcohol all add to a complex aroma. The flavor is a combination of sweet (fruits) and spice (cloves). Some phenols are detected in the finish. Alcohol is not detected. The body is surprisingly light and effervescent. I would say too much carbonation. Drinks easy for a complex beer. I would dare to say it is mildly refreshing."
"Drinkability - Highly drinkable as are all Chimay beers I have had."
"D: Interesting. Complex. Tasty. Cheers to my first Belgian Tripel!"
"I have had this lots of times and this one was in my cellar for about 2 years so I was happy to find the beer had matured gracefully and the carbonation levels that sometimes hampered the fresh exaples was gone and the dark fruit notes were now mixed down in the midbody. This is a great dubbel that often is lacking in complexity that its ""blue""cousin has in spades. Nice to see that cellaring improves this beer"
"D: Quite drinkable, but at $11 (at least here) - the drinkability goes down a notch. But, in theory, its ""drinkability"" is high."
"I have tried this same beer on tap and the difference is almost enough to consider them two different beers. The bottle version is a lot more ""active"" than its on-tap cousin"
"Overall it was good, but not really my favorite belgian style beer."
"D: A very nice brew.. Unfortunately sometimes a pricey one depends on the store... Still worth the 4-6 bucks if you ask me!"
"I have been meaning to review this for a few days but have had to go back to get more at the store. Y'know why? 'Cause I enjoy drinking it immensely and writing about it gets in the way of its enjoyment. Whaddya think about that? It's damn good."
"Nicely balanced with a decent amount of complexity and an astringency and carbonation that reminded me of champagne. Not a beer I'd have frequently, nor are dubbels my favorite style, but certainly a well crafted exameple of the styele."
"Pours a dark amber with moderate creamy head. Fruity, spicey aroma. Wonderful taste and a very smooth beer that is excellent with dinner. Slight bitter finish and a great beer to enjoy a few of in an evening. First class in its category in my opinion - Cheers!"
"Going to be a tough one to score, for some reason it seems more pleasant in hindsight than when I was drinking it 10 minutes ago, I think basically because I was expecting something different. Will be coming back to this one (I drank one of the smaller bottles, maybe I should try the 750ml corked bottle as I've heard flavours develop more in bottle with a larger volume)."
"D: Great Belgian, not the best, but a real complex beer with great fruity flavors"
"Overall this is a solid dubbel with a bit more spiciness than others. Worth a shot."
"Very good dubbel and I am now excited to try the other two (blue and white). Appearance is very good nice color with a good amount of head and lacing. Smell is of dark fruit raisins, figs, and plums, with just a hint of alcohol and no real hops. Taste is more of the same, but a very mild hop bitterness comes through. Mouthfeel and Drinkability are on par."
"D- very easy. I would suggest this beer."
"A very down-to-Earth holy beer, surely great at diners or suppers, extremely refreshing and easy going, for evenings, to quench your thirst."
"Drinkability:as is the case with all chimays this is a great beer it never dissapoints you. in my opinion ,this beer goes good with desserts like apple pie and ice cream is one of my favorites. cheers."
"M-D- This is one of the easiest beers i had ever had to drink and one that packs more than enough flavor to keep me coming back. Very dry on the mouth and so drinkable i could easily have six. Great brew!"
"This beer poured a cloudy deep reddish brown. 2 finger fluffy white soft head that had great retention to it, and sheets of lacing were left on the glass. Nose was of cloves and cinnamon, slightly medicinal. Taste begins slightly medicinal with berries and cinnamon being the first noticeable flavors. Then sweet malts, yeast and the clove and spiciness on the tail end. This is a medium bodied beer, decent carbonation, well blended but complex beer. My first time drinking a Trappist - and highly enjoyable."
"D - This is definitely drinkable, superb taste and mouthfeel. This is a great example of a dubbel although, I think Westmalle Dubbel wins by a nose if only I could get it more often."
"This is a great Dubbel (as it should be). I am looking forward to enjoying this again in the future."
"This may have been the first great beer I ever had (back when I was in college) and I remember liking it a lot back then even when my experience with beer was mostly crap. I'm glad to see that it's still a great beer after all these years."
"Technically, a very good beer. Just, not really my thing."
"The smell is interesting, malty with some dark fruit, alcohol, and a bit of sourness. The taste is sweet and malty, but also a bit sour. The alcohol is warming and a bit spicy. Mouthfeel is a bit thin. Overall, I don't like it as much as I hoped I would."
"Big creamy beige head deep red cloudy colour. Smell is yeasty, sweet, dark fruit, but the yeast dominates. Flavour is yeasty and very vinous there is also some hops in the aftertaste. Mouthfeel is very crisp with heavy carbonation, medium bubbles. This beer was very good it's big brother is a bit better, but this is also great!"
"I tried this beer with [lean] fish fillets and pairs them greatly!"
"OVERALL: A top notch trappist dubbel, and another great offering from Chimay. I could drink this one all evening. Very drinkable, very enjoyable, and one I'll re-visit for sure. Recommended."
"I gotta say, I put off drinking a Chimay for far too long. For some reason, the beer is extremely readily available in my area but the high price kept me from ever giving it a shot until I read a little more into it. Well done, Trappist monks!"
"D: The carbonation and ABV make it a bit of a sipper for me."
"D: More drinkable than many other Belgians I've had, enough to make me maybe consider another Chimay.."
"Easy to drink, goes down very well. Alcohol is very hidden."
"Overall this is a very drinkable brew and one I'll certainly revisit again."
"Big light tan head sits on top of a dark brown body. Head drops kind of fast. The components of the aroma are very blended together. Lots of sweet dark fruits. Everything in the flavor is very mellow. Figs, prunes, and a little brown sugar. Mouthfeel is kind of thin, but that's not a bad thing and it helps to make it supremely drinkable."
"Overall: The mouth feel is carbonated and slightly spicy. The mouth feel is medium body to medium full. The finish is slightly bitter and peppery. This is the first dubbel that I can stomach. The beer has a nice full complete body, there is no separation in the flavors. I really like this beer. Out of the red, white and blue Chimay, this is second to the blue."
"Comment I liked Chimay Red a lot. It is a very good and tasty beer."
"Overall: I'd rather reach for a bottle of Westmalle Dubbel if my local store has it, but this is not bad."
"Not bad, but too sweet for our taste."
"D - This is not my usual style, but it got better as I drank it. I will drink it again and try others of the same style."
"Poured into a Chimay goblet for a leather brown body with a quickly disipating one-finger white head. A nice sweet malt smell of caramel, toffee, some roasted malts and minor scent of bitter hops and dark fruit. An inherent fruit flavor of orange and grape or something tropical, with some herbal hop bitterness that passes over the tongue with a prickly, dry feeling. Still, this is a medium-bodied beer that goes down smooth and has residula sweetness the entire time you're drinking it with some minor spices on the backend as well. A well-balanced dubbel that anyone should try if they haven't already."
"very easy to drink, I would have liked more umpf but the style is not always particularly umpfy as compared to Quads and SDA's"
"The feel is fizzy and chewy. A big thick consistency, leaving a nice aftertaste. A really great beer, greater than the sum of its parts."
"Looks beautiful, tastes good, VERY drinkable. I could drink several of these, no problem. Basically what every other review says. A top notch brew, for sure. The best trappist? I don't think it is. Worth a drink, even if you need to go out of the way to get one? Indeed."
"Overall probably my favorite Chimay, but the blue is close. Enjoy this one often!"
"EDIT: Interestingly enough, I looked back, and rated the Blue higher than this one. I know I liked this better - might have to go back and give the Blue another try."
"D: Not something you want to drink fast. Not that the 7% ABV has to do with it, you just want to make sure you can enjoy this one."
"Out of a bottle (thanks Tara!) this brew was a very cloudy chestnut brown color with tons of floating sediment in it. The head was two-fingers of khaki bubbles that displayed good retention and excellent lacing in curtains. The aroma was also excellent, toasted malt, caramel malt, ripe fruit, Belgian yeast and spices. The flavors were also complex and impressive. I tasted Belgian yeast, lots of dark fruits, cloves, cinnamon, raisins, apple cider vinegar and alcohol especially as it warmed up. Quite tangy. The mouthfeel was smooth and rich, the body full and the carbonation a bit foamy. A very good beer and a classic."
"PS: After having this, I will be sure to seek out more Belgian beers so that I can fully appreciate the style. Cheers!"
"Citrus burst at first with a kind of vegetable aftertaste. Cider-ish, but really refreshing."
"D - easy to drink and a nice beer. I would like to see more depth to this. I just wanted a more robust flavor that wasn't quite there. Very nice beer though."
"Pours a reddish brown in color with only a slight head. Smell is somewhat laced with spices. Maybe some clove and a real faint cinnamon. Taste is highly carbonated and bubbly. There is some spice as well as some dark fruit in the taste. Perhaps just a bit too much carbonation. Not bad, an easy drinker."
"I probably don't need to tell anyone this, but this is one of those beers that everyone should be able to get their hands on and well they should."
"D 3.5	- very rich complex beer. It's a sipper for sure. I personally would prefer more malt tastes and carbonation, but it seems very appropriate for a Dubbel. After all I think Chimay beers are a benchmark for any style! This one is my least favorite out of the 3 Chimays though."
"Overall, I am very pleased with my first true Trappist brew. I have read that Red is not the best from Chimay, but that ok because I bought the gift set with all three plus my awesome goblet. So, I only have two more to look forward to!"
"Drinkability: Goes down smooth without a hint of the 7% ABV."
"I taste plenty of fruit--the cherry from the nose along with grape and honey. I also get clove in a dry, herbal spiciness. The beer is tart and medium-bodied, leaving my mouth dry and tingling just a bit at the finish. On the whole, the flavor and mouthfeel are a little more subtle than other dubbels I've had, such as Ommegang's Abbey, but this isn't necessarily a bad thing. In fact, it really boosts the drinkability."
"D: pretty high, not much alcohol in the taste"
"D - it's a pretty good beer, but I think there's a few other Belgian Dubbels I'd pick up before I pick up this one."
"Dark amber colored beer with a rapidly fading head.Aroma is faint dark fruit.Taste is honey,dark fruit and sugar cane.I was disappointed in this beer not because it's bad but because I was expecting more.Overall decent,it's worth a try but as for me I am OK just drinking this once!!"
"Very good dubbel and easy to find too."
"Even with the example of Chimay - the largest of the Trappist breweries - there is a sense of tradition that, although sometimes exploited, is never compromised. Chimay Red is found on literally all corners of the globe - from Toronto to Sydney and Helsinki to Santiago - but it hasn't compromised the quality of the beer, the operations of the monastery, nor the lifestyle of those who live within it. To me, that's the true meaning of success."
"D- A very interesting and enjoyable beer. This beer has become the gold standard for a dubbel in my book. This beer is how it is done, it is easy to drink and it screams quality."
"Overall, I was expecting a lot and this beer kind of came up average on the craft brew scale."
"Drinkability: This smooth and complex brew made by Monks is an awesome experiance. I could drink only this beer for months at a time and be totaly satisfied. The cost may make this difficult but remember that a major part of their sales proceeds goes to support the great charitable works of the monastery. What a great deal: drink world class beer, get a nice beer buzz and help the poor!"
"Bold-yet-balanced Belgian goodness. A tasty, drinkable classic whose strength is formidable yet far from overwhelming, with a complexity that is to be expected from a Trappist brewery. Despite its status and size, Abbaye Notre Dame de Scourmont has not lost its touch in crafting wonderful brews."
"D: As far as dubbels go, this is one of the elite. Sip, savor, enjoy."
"Drinkability: Quite drinkable. I could easily have a lot more of this and enjoy it. 7% alcohol you say? I couldn't tell!"
"Overall, a very enjoyable dubbel. Quite refreshing and drinkable despite its ABV, and definitely one I will purchase again in the future."
"D: Very drinkable dubbel. Though it lacks some of the expected complexity, it is terribly drinkable. I would not turn this one down, but would pass over it for the blue."
"Mouthfeel - medium body that is slightly course from the fine carbonation to start but finishes creamy smooth. The beer holds the carbonation exceptionally well as the beer looks flat until it hits your mouth."
"Medium bodied with a crisp carbonation. Good drinkability."
"Notes from: 7/12/04"
"Overall: Chimay Red is a fruity, aromatic, and warming abbey dubbel with some nice complexities. On previous tastes I didn't use the proper glassware and I forgot to let the yeast settle. This time I corrected both those errors and gained a new appreciation for the incredibly fresh smell of this beer. The flavour doesn't possess the metallic notes it had when, on a prior taste, I drank it almost immediately after pouring. It's a solid beer, though I prefer Westmalle Dubbel and St. Bernardus Prior 8 to this offering."
"Drinkability: A very well-composed beer with interesting, pleasant and sometimes subtle notes to be discovered. Highly recommended."
"Brownish colored head that swiftly recedes to a thin layer of constantly renewing micro-bubbles. Super-cloudy red-brown in color, like mud or plumbing backup, can't get any more opaque without being black. The nose unfolds in a slow, if not sneaky, manner, surprising spine and hoppiness to frame the dark chocolate, caramel, coriander, ginger spice and candied plum and cherry fruit scents, banana bread, chooses balance over nostril penetration. Medium-bodied, the flesh is sculpted and hard, no jiggle. A good deal of the sense of momentum comes from the ever-present carbonation. The ginger and clove spice almost turns to cumin, pairs up with grass and grain notes. Without excess sweetness, there's raisin, fig, date notes and fresher cherry fruit. Bready like fruit-bread or cake not a loaf of bread, leesy as well. Even with nothing out of place, does sort of spin off at the end. Good drinkability."
"D: Drinkability was amazing and not much else to say."
"Well i finally got around to trying this, and I'm sure glad I did! Pours out a hazy dark copper red, with a VERY bubbly thin head, that recedes to nothing. Looked very inviting, looked very good! Smell was great, no off smells what so ever, the hops came through, and you could smell some of the sweetness, I cant put my finger on it exactly, but it defiantly smelt great! Hands down, this was one tasty beer! It goes down real smooth, finishes with mild hop bitterness, and then you feel a warming sensation from the alcohol. Very interesting and very well done. I enjoyed this one immensely! The only downfall i saw with this beer was, the mouthfeel. It felt very thin, and tad over carbonated, with the same sensation as pop would leave in your mouth. Not too bad, but at the same time i was very disappointed. I could honestly drink more than a few bombers of this beer, it is of high quality, and well balanced, it went down easy, and the higher ABV was a nice added bonus. Overall this was worth the money I spent, I have to defiantly try the other Chimay variants. Overall this is a very interesting beer, and I HIGHLY enjoyed this! World Class."
"D: I was not very impressed with the aging experiment. Either I did not do it right, or the beer should have been had much younger than this. I will buy a bottle and try it sooner to confirm. Regardless, their blue and white labels are much better."
"This might be my favorite Dubbel to date."
" Notes: Fire in the belly,but not overdone. A top notch beer that must be had more frequently than not."
"I poured from a 750 ml bottle into a tulip glass. It pours the color of rum with a big white head. The head settles to leave a wispy covering over the brew and bits of lace are left on the sides of the glass. Phenolic notes are prevalent on the nose along with figs and raisins. The flavor is of dried fruits and is slightly sweet. The finish has a light alcohol feel to it, I do not taste any hoppy bitterness. The beer is medium bodied with adequete carbonation. The brew is fairly quaffable for a dubbel. A good beer but others provide a better value for the style."
"An exceptionally smooth beer that comes off fairly medium bodied. Would have expected it to be more full bodied but overall was a great brew that I will be sure to enjoy again."
"served by bottle, pored into glass...Chimay Glass. Good feel and better taste, easy drinkability. I had hard time with cost associated though. There where some slight fruity tones, associated with the head, bitter at the end though. I highly recommend for the starter Dubbel Style brew."
"taste is light, slightly sweet, a little bitter, some caramel, dark pitted fruit, some spice, touch of cocoa, ends dry and slightly bitter."
"Overall - Chimay is a fine beer as always!"
"Medium bodied. Easy drinking. Much better near room temperature."
"d: medium drinkability. Could probably drink the whole 750ml (i shared it with my friend on new years however) but there seemed to be quite the alcohol presence at the end of the glass which annoys somewhat (it could just be my glass... not sure)."
"A very cloudy pour with a nice layer of foam that covers the entire mouth of the Chimay snifter. The aroma has hints of apple and pineapple. A spicy finish compliments each sip. Very nice beer and I will definitely purchase and drink this tasty brew again in the future."
"D-Certainly tasty and lovely to look at but the fleeting flavour profile and lack of body beefiness does not help this one hold up to other highly regarded dubbels. Regardless of this fact Chimay Red retains enough flavour and character to be a highly drinkable and enjoyable brew. Will always retain a near and dear place in my beer heart as this was my original gateway craft beer!"
"Very impressive indeed. Interestingly enough a lot of this beer's characteristics bore (to me anyway) a striking resemblance to a beer I reviewed not too long ago, Caracole Ambrée. The Chimay runs circles around it, mainly due to its superior construction and deeper complexity. I'll be looking for a bigger bottle next time!"
"D - This was a very good, hearty and thick (especially since they brew it to survive during fasting), a very good Dubbel"
"From some of the other reviews I almost wonder if my bottle hadn't been taken care of properly -the cork had 11/07 stamped on it. I won't be afraid to try this one again and hopefully I'll get more out of it than this one."
"Drinks like a true Belgian...a pleasure to consume and enjoyed time after time. Get some!"
"MF&D - one of the most amazing beers I've ever had the pleasure to drink. So incredibly smooth, goes down likes its nothing at all. the carbonation is noticeable but not an impediment to the drinking process, moreover, it helps one drink the brew."
"Drinkability: If this were less expensive it might be dangerous."
"Overall, just stellar. Cannot recommend enough."
"Yet another beer from the Chimay line that I have ignored for far too long. Stubby brown 11.2oz bottle poured into a St. Bernardus chalice yeilds only a dime thick worth of head and leaves only scant whisps of a whitish cap that desperatly tries to cling to the side of the glass, bringing it back with a swirl is not too much trouble though. Finally a dubbel that smells like a dubbel. Sweet, not tart, biscuity maltiness, brown sugar, butter and light cinnamon, all very understated. I like, I like, sweetness of the nose is downplayed in the actual taste, here the malt bitterness begins to shine through. Taste at first of well cooked toast, slightly herbal, mild pepper and tart cherry with a noticable alcoholic warmth that kicks the tongue and back of the throat ever so slightly. Seeing this pecan beauty in my glass and thinking of how each sip with reveal something new makes this a beer one to return to over and over, but damn if I wish it could retain some kind of head, a cap, anything..."
"D..Easy to drink and makes you want more. A couple of these in the proper goblet and you have yourself a lovely afternoon or evening. You know it's 7%, but this one doesn't knock you on your butt. Good ole Chimay, always trustworthy."
"Taste is moderately rich yet nice, ok, bump on the nose. Some spice as per the nose along with light citrus and dried fruits. Not as robust as some of the style but very clean and not overly sweet. Great feel as the perky carbonation masks any alcohol flavors. Like Chimay's Blue, the Red can be a bit overcarbonated and might need some air due to variations in bottle conditioning."
"Drinkability: Surprisingly sweet and caramelly for my part, however only to the benefit of this great beer. This is my first one, I've kept it for som time, now I know it was worth the wait and that it's time for me to get another one aswell!"
"A real classic and standard dubbel."
"I would recommend this ale to anyone who prefers rich smooth unfiltered beer."
"(rated Jul 5, 2007)"
"Drinkability: Upon opening this, once we broke the cage from the bottle the cork got very ancy, and proceeded to pop itself off like a champagne bottle. Very cool to see. Is it better then the other Chimay's? No. But it's entirely on point with the muted fruit flavor and the maltiness. I'd rather have the Grande Reserve Blue but this one is a standout as well. Another great brew from the Chimay family."
"D-Very drinkable, I could have a few of these without any regrets."
"I hope I get to rereview this great beer."
"Tasty brew for sure but not one of my favorites."
"#2 in the Chimay tasting is the dubbel. I've been somewhat unimpressed by dubbels in the past, but this one seems to trade in the breadiness for some more fruit flavors which was nice. Pretty good."
"A good drinking beer. A great Belgian Ale.Try it!"
"Taste has definitely got some spice to it, this one has a lot more holiday type spices than the white. Its also got some dark fruit, chocolate and cola flavor. It starts nicely and then finishes a little watered down with a bit of fizz. Good but not amazing."
"Bottle. Cloudy brown pour with great thick lacing and thin tan head. Aroma of caramel malt. Taste of malt with molasses, caramel and yeast. Great finish, one of the best widely available Belgians indeed. I feel like this gets knocked because it is so accessible, but I always will grab one when available."
"Drinkability - pretty high; wouldn't be hard pressed to drink this by the stein-full."
"Reviewed on 3/30/08. Bottle. Poured a dark brown with a creamy, light tan (1 cm) head that persisted. Aroma of Belgian yeast, light fruits, and as it warmed, dark fruits (raisin, prune). Initial taste of sweet light fruit (apple, pear, melon) and slight bitterness in the swallow. Also an aftertaste of smoked beef (odd, I know). A lighter version of the Bleu. Drinkable and tasty. 8/4/7/4/14 (3.7/5)"
"D: Easy to drink, Nice brew, Worth the try !"
"Overall I'm just getting into the belgian beers and Chimay. I actually like the red a bit better than the white because it is a bit more drinkable but is still a great beer. Wow, these beers really are starting to amaze me, I'm glad I finally made the leap. Now off to the blue next!"
"A beautiful cloudy beer with a dark heart and a light head. Smells like a weathered cask on a boat. It tastes like it belongs in an ancient ornate stein. It travels around the tongue like a flock of pillows, a light almost fluffy drink that smooths into velvet as it rushes down. The alcohol is carried by a boat procession of jesters and trumpets that turn into scholars and orchestral harmonies upon reaching their destination."
"The fact that I've never reviewed this is a testament to procrastination. I've had this many many times, it's usually been a reliable stand-by for me for some time. Tonight I'm having a bottle as part of a romp through Chimay beers (Doree, then Red, finally Blue). The beer is murky, turbid dark orange-brown color with a solid-looking off-white foam. No lace now or in memory for this grade of Chimay. The smell is strong with yeasty products, lots of esters/fruits. The taste is nice, the fruity esters are there, solid malt backbone, and a little spice. The body is thick, substantial, and smooth. Very easy to drink, a great beer that competes well with all other dubbels I've tried."
"Drinkability: Pretty good! Nice complexity and fairly well-balanced. In fact, the whole Chimay family is very solid and overall enjoyable."
"Drinkability: Definitely only something that can be had one or two at most, but an exceptional drink. Something to be savored and enjoyed- highly recommended. Also good for the winter, this beer will warm you up!"
"D: This is a style that I would not drink everyday. IMO it is meant to be savored and should be a treat every now and then."
"D - The mouthfeel describes it all, neither too dry nor too cloying. This dubbel slings back easy. Of all the dubbels i have tried over the past couple years chimay red is really hard to beat. With its restraint and balance this beer could be put back all day or night."
"Very drinkable brew, just like everything from Chimay. I wouldn't make a night of this beer because of its high abv, but it's always fun to have a few."
"D: Well carbonated and nicely crafted beer is very easy to drink. Like the other Chimays, this is a very quality ale."
"I had good expecatations from this after I tried the Blue, I wasn't satisfied with this one, blue was a lot better."
"amber chestnut with medium head lighter off white of beer. light beligan candy spotty lace. citrus sweet smell, grape like. taste has many subtle aspects. light pilsner hop. light banana, plum, cotton candy, light Gorgonzola finish. good feeling. very well balanced. quite drinkable although quite complex."
"Cloudy red body with thin head and not much lace. Head dissipated pretty quickly to barely a film. I poured into a red wine glass. Maybe that was the problem. I was a little disappointed with the appearance compared to some other reviews. Interesting sour malt with spice aroma. Complex warm malt initial flavor that is earthy and sour. Pleasant sour and bitter balance in the aftertaste that is long-lived and slowly evolving. Medium bodied with a sparkling champagne-like carbonation. Feels maybe a little thin on the finish. This is a tasty ale with interestingly complex aroma and flavor."
"D: Highly drinkable Belgian ale that is appealing in its appearance and bountiful flavors"
"Pours a dark brown/reddish colored body. WIth a complex flavor, very spicy, and somewhat fizzy. No bitterness. Not much in the way of aroma. Medium body mouthfeel. Wow, I really like this beer. My favorite Chimay beer out of the red/blue/white."
"My least fave from Chimay."
"Couldn't drink a whole lot of this rich Belgian beer, but what I can take I will savor."
"Notes: This is a very solid Trappist Dubbel and an absolute joy to drink."
"Overall, I'm a bit underwhelmed by this beer - perhaps my expectations too high based on how much I've heard people talk about Chimay for so many years - but I wouldn't turn it down if given the chance. It's a good example of the style and I'd have it again, especially now that I know what to expect."
"Although not my favorite Belgian, you have to respect the craftsmanship. Well done!"
"Very thin bodied, extremely drinkable, something you could down a few of or just sip all night."
"drinkability: I was pleasantly suprisd, it's not overrated, smooth and easy for how stong the ABV is."
"I was very disappointed and underwhelmed by this. Love the Chiimay quad, but this one just doesn't do it for me."
"D. This is a good beer. A solid trappist style dubbel that you can find just about anywhere that sells good beer. I suggest the Chimay White over this one, but obviously you could do worse."
"D - I love this beer, and although it's delicious, it's probably a little too substantial to drink a bunch all at once."
"D: Haven't had a ton of dubbels, but this definitely much easier to drink than the other beers I've had from Chimay, probably because of its decreased complexity. Still a great beer."
"D: Very easy, the multi layers keep the palate interested...definately have some more."
"D--Quicker and easier going down than the more potent Chimays. Since it doesn't have the alcohol, sweetness, complexity nor price tag of Grande Reserve, I guess that's the idea."
"Poured into a white wine glass it is ruddy brown with amber highlights. The head is large, but settles rather quickly into a thin layer over the beer. A few yeast chunks swirl around at the bottom of the glass. The smell starts out sour and sweet with a biscuity aroma right at the end. I smells as though it is delicate and lightly hopped. Raisins, candi sugar, flowers. The taste, IMO, is a classic example of a true Belgian style abbey ale: Sweet, smooth, delicate and complex. Everything about it is subtle and balanced. The wide range of flavors go from sweet, to bitter, sour to malty, raw to toasted. You just can't beat these real Belgian in mouthfeel either. Like silk. Almost as good as Prior 8."
"Poured into a burgundy glass. Appearance is hazy, strong-brewed tea in color with an off-white head. Considerable lacing. Smells of bread, spices, alcohol, hint of malts. Taste is spicy--maybe nutmeg, with dried fruits that make up the sweetness, dark bread, and faint flavor of hops. Odd sort of bitter medicinal aftertaste. Mouthfeel is not what I expected. I thought it would be heavy, but it was actually somewhat watered-down, very little acidity. This beer is appropriate as an after-dinner drink, but not something I would indulge in regularly."
"A: Some serious head on this beer, acorn brown, maintains a constant layer of foam across the surface - 4.25, S: Bready, nutty, spicy, Trappist ale unquestionably - 4.75, T: Extremely smooth yet quite flavorful, wonderful crisp and somewhat tart, tinge of bitterness from what I can only assume is the hops - 4.50, M: Medium bodied - 4.25, D: An exceptional ale, easily one that I would recommend - 4.50"
"It's definitely not a chore to drink at 7%, but not as balanced as I would like."
"M&D--Much more sparkling and smooth than you would expect from the color and near syrupy viscosity. This could be like sludgy motor oil that zaps you of all energy, but turns out to be well-rounded with a sneaky warming alcohol creep. Can't help but be reminded of and summon up images of dank stone cave-like structures, as this would be a perfect fit for that environment."
"The beer poured a murky brown-ish with what I would call some hints of red. It poured a nice light brown head that was well retained. The aroma was a bit light, but it was a little bready with some hints of citrus and a touch of alcohol. The taste was very good, but could not really put my finger on the flavors, but none-the-less, it had an excelletn taste. The beer had good carbonation and I could have had a few more pints if I had had a few more bottles. Overall, I will be buying this one again, without a doubt."
"D: Glad to finally take a shot at a European classic, this was an excellent brew. Prob not one I'd get all the time, but a sipping brew for special occasions. Much props to the wife again for this gift!"
"not exactly a cheap habit to have out here in china, but when rice adjunct lager just won't cut it for you, sometimes you gotta do what you gotta do..."
"I prefer the Blue, personally."
"D: A good solid beer, nothing that will blow you away but a good standby. The smooth nature of this one makes it very drinkable and goes really well with foods of all types and offers you the ability to have several with the abv."
"Drinkability: I was very impressed with the beer. It was very easy to drink even with a bit higher alchohol content."
"I waited a while to try Premiere, the last of the trio I hadn't had. It is extremely drinkable, and of the type where you feel good afterward. The total drinking sensation is warming, satisfying, and enriching. Not my favorite of the three, but only because this is not my preferred style."
"Nice rich head at first dies down to a frothy film after a minute. Dark peach colors, very hazy from the yeast. Smells of dust, orange and vinegar. Very warming alcohol presence. Very subtle and sweet hops presence working with the yeast. Slight dried bananas, not banana-y like a hefeweizen but a lot less sweet. A lot of maltiness of front with the slight fruity sweetness in back. Put all these together and this is very refreshing."
"Overall, a solid brew, not a solid Trappist brew, but a solid brew I would say. It was a little light and a tad watery on the finish for me, but overall pretty decent."
"An auburn beer with big, frothy head and it looks great. Earthy with a little bit floral aroma. The taste is somewhat medicinal with noticeable alcohol that slicks the tongue. This is a sipping beer that would be great accompanying food, especially indian cuisine."
"D: A nice sipper with cheeses - smooth and easy going. Easy drinking, and stands up well on an evening overlooking the beach!"
"D: High despite its ABV"
"Pours a murky dark brown color with an amber tint to it. It is topped with a fizzy moderate sized head. Head tapers off a bit but a bunch of frothy lacing remains. There is a spicy fruitiness to the aroma but it's faint. The flavor is malty with a sugary dark fruit flavor. Some spice mixed in. Pretty well balanced and smooth. I'd rank this third among Chimay beers behind the White and Blue but this is excellent."
"I would definately have this beer again. This is my second favorite of the Chimays trailing just slightly behind the Blue. I think I'm probably going to get larger bottles next time."
"I feel like the carbonation is a little heavy, almost like a champagne fizz. Very balanced as the nose and flavors work well together painting the whole picture. Not the best Belgian but a very decent beer worth checking out."
"Had this in Philly at dinner. Was really surprised to find this because everything else offered was the usual suspects. Had a nice head on it that laced the glass nicely as I consumed it. Really enjoyed this as it had a nice balanced taste and finish. I ended up having two of these and would have loved to have had a few more but this was a business dinner and with 7.00% I didn't want to get stupid."
"Great all around. I just remember thinking this is a beer. It was hearty but not too over the top, nice think head. I liked the ABV and espicially since it didn't come through in the taste. The same from the first sip to the last. Shared half the bottle but I wanted more and easily could have drank the entire thing."
"D: Very drinkable; doesn't drink like other beers of this ABV. Pleasant, warming finish gets you ready for drink after drink."
"I'll be having a few more of these. but perhaps not in the same night at 7%"
"As I usually say when I review these types of beers... a classic. A great introduction to what the Belgian ales are all about. Some can be a bit overwhelming to a newbie, but this goes down easy and isn't to over the top with the yeast and alcohol."
"D - EVERYDAY!"
"D- Very easy to drink. Highly recommended."
"D - This carbonation is a bit much for me, but there's still a world of flavor in this beer. Pretty easy to drink and not overbearing."
"D: Very drinkable, but not as flavorful as Chimay's other beers. 4.5"
"D: Manageable in every way, and quite excellent in most - a classic dubbel, delicate and complex, not cloying or boring at all. Recommended."
"Very tasty and balanced; nothing offensive, yet nothing all that unique either; it's not worth the steep price of $5 bottle in my opinion"
"This is the benchmark of a soft, beautiful, balanced beer. I love it."
"Overall good beer, could drink a few."
"Notes: complex, interesting but did not blow me away. Love the presentation in ""wine"" bottle with cork. My expectations were high and they were not met by this Ale which is so highly regarded and presented. Of course it is better than 95% of beers out there but again, my expectations were very high indeed."
"D-Doesn't hold a candle to the Chimay blue but is definatly a quality product. Moderate ABV makes having a couple of these in a setting probably the limit."
"Picked up this bottle a few weeks ago as part of a chimay gift set. It pours a muddy amber brown color, similar to unfiltered apple juice. Bright white head settles to a thin layer of foam. Aroma is very nice and fruity, hints of apple and peach or pear, some vanilla. A bit of apple sweetness along with some faint spicyness and a bit of oak come through in the taste area. Mouthfeel is smooth, somewhat light on the palate, moist finish. A very good brew, worthy of the praise others have given it. I liked the Blue better, but this one is still very very good."
"Poured into the proper glassware, it has a nice thick head, though it disappears quickly, leaving a light film. Body is a nice dark, hazy amber. Smells of fruits and spices, along with the classic Chimay breadiness. Tastes of esters up front, followed by the bread again. Ends on a spicy, yeasty note. Somewhat medicinal. Medium bodied. A bit too phenolic to be terribly drinkable."
"Drinkability: I haven't had many dubbels yet, but I must say I love this one. I could drink several bottles of this at a time before I grew tired of it. Thank you to our monk friends for this great beer!"
"D - While I'm usually not too fond of Dubbels this one is magnificent and surprisingly drinkable."
"D- this seems easy toput down at only 7% but dont let it fool you it can come back around to get you. Very smooth and crisp on the alcohol."
"Drinkability- Very nice offering from Chimay. I will have it again in the future."
"I really like this beer, but don't drink it often. It's a treat."
"Hazy dark ruby brown, with a large foamy big bubbled head that receids to a nice 1/4 inch froth and remains. There is also tons of carbination the cork hit the wall and the ceiling and still came down with force on the floor. OMG wow what an eye opening smell.I smell fruity esters all over the place, plumbs and over ripe peaches as well as alcohol warmth and malted goodness. But also plenty of sents that I cannot even describe and havn't experianced before. Tastes of Alcohol and plumbs up front with a malty dry earthyness throughout and some sort of maby root after taste that s wonderfull and addicting. I can pick out some hop bitterness inbetween multiple other flavors that I really will have to check out the vocab section to better describe in the future. Feels very nice in the mouth and althouh its a sipper I got the entire bottle down and wished there ws more. This really has me understanding why people are so high on good Belgian beer, and I may never look at beer the same again."
"D: definitely a legend in itself, never fails to impress"
"This would be a great beer to start with when it comes to Belgians and I wish I would have, it is kind of ridiculous to think I jumped right into a Westy 8 and 12 without trying this or many other Trappist brews first, it is flat out good, it will allow you to point out specific characteristics when drinking other trappist brews because it is not as complex as some others but it seems like almost the standard, there is a reason why this beer is so popular and has practically become commercialized, will definitely drink again even though it is a little expensive, recommended and the earlier the better probably, which I totally disregarded when getting into craft beer"
"Easy to drink and nice balance."
"Pours a cloudy amber color with a (gushing provided) dense off-white head. Picture perfect dubbel. Aromas really aren't intensely fruity, just a lot of dark candi sugar, a little bit of citrus, even less of clove, and a touch of band-aid. A medium bodied brew with very high carbonation delivers flavors of more candy, caramel, toasted bread, and a moderate amount of esters. Finish is quite dry and no noticeable hop flavor. Overall, it's a solid example of the style, no doubt. Not one of my favorite drinkers, as I really like something a bit more complex and pronounced in flavor and aroma, and perhaps not so dry."
"Rolling in at a little less ABV than its sister brews, this is probably the best one for a moderate session of drinking. I feel this beer may be a little hyped up, but is altogether very respectable."
"My first trappist and belgian beer and what more can I say except that I am hooked! Poured nicely from the bottle into a chalice. This beer was a wonderful experience for the taste buds and nasal passages, unbelievable smoothness. I would highly recommend this and it will purchased again many times to remain in my private stash."
"Pours a brownish red with a moderate amount of foam that disappears rapidly. Smells of malt and sugary spices, and tastes mildly of honey, sweet spice, and malt. The flavor is good, but the trouble is there's just not much of it. Overall, it had a diluted mouthfeel. Pleasant, but just not that big of a deal."
"mouthfeel is medium thick, I would like a slightly heavier mouthfeel, but that's just me, drinkability is high, hides the 7% perfectly and great balance along with nice carbonation goes down wonderfully."
"I can assure you the grading here is quite different vs. my original review. I apologize to the people at Chimay for my ignorance. At least to myself, I've made up for it."
"A medium, crisp body with lively carbonation keeps the beer very light and refreshing, contributing to the outstanding, almost soda-pop-style drinkability of another fine Trappist concoction. A clean finish with a lingering whiff of yeasty goodness marks the passing of one truly fine drink."
"D: Like every other Chimay I've tried this is very tasty, but if you're not a fan of sweet, malty (dubbels) then you may find this has a limited drinkability."
"Drinkability: the alcohol spice and steep price make this a difficult beer to drink much of at one time. If I had more than one or two at a time, I'd be feeling great and happy, but my wallet would definitely be a good bit lighter! If you take the money-is-no-object view, then this is a very drinkable beer, but the alcohol *will* catch up to you."
"Finish is a little dry, with sugary and herbal flavors lasting. Impressive and careful brewing done here. Not my favorite combination of characteristics, but certainly to be admired."
" ~ This is a good beer. I must say I am impressed with the look and the feel. The scent and the flavor are average bordering on above but really nothing too spectacular. The feel of this beer is really what sets it apart from every other dubbel I've ever sampled."
"Poured into a goblet, it was very hazy with a dark brown center; I got a thick tan head that quickly thinned out into a thin ring with no lacing; there is a lot of carbonation. It has a pleasant aroma that's sweet with roasted malts and there's a mild alcohol aroma as well; there are hints of raisins and plums. It's smooth and crisp and is medium bodied and is a bit bitter when it first hits the back of your tongue, its got a sweet taste throughout, it does have a dry aftertaste with a slight alcohol touch."
"D-Goes great with sushi which is what i had it with, not sure its one i would reach for on a regular basis but it is an extremly drinkable brew."
"D - Quite drinkable and complex, it is surprisingly dark and roasty without as much fruity caramel character as one might expect."
"I tried this beer on February 21st after purchasing from my local LCBO outlet. The beer poured a reddish brown colour with a large, long lasting, rocky head. The aroma was malty and yeasty with some hints of dark fruit. The mouthfeel was full-bodied with mild carbonation. The flavour was sweet malt, with some yeast, and a small amount of bitterness. A great beer."
"The taste is dry at first but then becomes quite sweet. It's noticeably alcoholic the whole way through, with a vague, light taste like German dark hefeweizen. Struggling to detect elements, I can find only faint hints of whole wheat and prunes in a character that is otherwise mostly 7-up and alcohol. The finish is mostly prunes and alcohol with a soft hint of whole wheat bread. In the end, this seems boring and bland, particularly for the clear alcoholic qualities."
"Not as complex or drinkable as the Grande Reserve (Blue). Cloudy golden brown pour with creamy white head that lies down quickly. Highly carbonated. Some bite to initial mouthfeel. Taste is yeasty, sweet and spiced with some butteriness lingering on the palate. A very good beer with no off tastes, but still somewhat disappointing next to their killer Blue."
"Poured a beautiful auburn color..awesome when the sun hits it. Good foamy head of about two inches that reduced quickly. Taste a bit on the citrus side, which isn't my favorite flavor. But compared to other beers like this one, I think this one is pretty soft on the taste buds. Mouthfeel was smooth, but a little on the light side. Decent drinkability,"
"This is a good beer, but nothing earth shattering. certainly worth trying, I just wasn't feeling it, I don't know, maybe it's me because everyone else loves this stuff..."
"drinkability is excellent. this is a world class dubbel. the flavors, concentration, proportioning, and overall character are all wonderful. the only criticism is that the aroma does not match the taste in richness (the latter having a much more rich character). cheers!"
"Reddish brown with a thick off white head that disappeared after a long stand off. A nice ammount of sediment in the bottom of my glass. Lightly spiced and floral aroma is fairly faint. Clove spice and a nice fruity sweetness at the end. Very smooth and carbonated."
"Drinkability has to be high, for I drank it despite the metallic flavor. I can only imagine how good this beer tastes not damaged. This review is merely a placeholder until I get another, undamaged bottle."
"Great drinkability. Really high ABV, but the taste is so complex and smooth I could drink it all day. In fact, I tried and failed miserably."
"D: I haven't had a ton of Belgians yet, but this one was fairly drinkable. I couldn't drink another 750ml bottle, but this one went down fairly easily. Definitely would recommend it for a beer experience that makes the most of all your senses."
"D - Very nice to drink and a great example of a Dubbel."
"D: It was a very solid dubble but with other much better ones on the market it would be a rare day when this brew was the first string in my cooler. However, it makes a decent session beer and I would gladly swig quite a few if they were offered."
"Chimay is a great Abbey beer and it just flies off the shelf at my store. Pours a dark chocolate covered cherry brown with some haziness. Smells of nice figs and raisons and a touch of yeast. Tastes well balanced with some red raison and other fruity malt notes. Cheers!"
"Great intro to Trappist Ales."
"We have a gusher. Pours an understandably clouded dark reddened brown. Soft, creamy looking head that lasts as a wispy top and collar. Nice malt oriented aroma - doughy yeast, cherries, sweet bread, and a touch of chocolate. Thinnish flavor of fruity esters and phenolics with underlying chocolate and bread. A dusty yeatiness wraps up the flavor - dry and no real bitterness or lasting aftertaste. Medium body at the most, very smooth with low carbonation. Not very exciting, but not bad."
"MF&D- Light to medium bodied with a heavy carb presence. Very drinkable for this abv. Great taste and body. I highly recommend this as well as the other Chimays to anyone interested in these styles."
"Drinkability: This is a delicious well crafted beer. I will buy this again. The spice notes really took me off guard, I enjoyed this beer."
"Drinkability = It is a nice beer though substantial and complex enough to discourage large intakes. I think the .33 liter bottle is about right and makes a nice aperitif or sipping beer for a good conversation"
"Chimay (red) pours a copper/brown color with a frothy off-white head. The head dissipates slowly, and doesn't leave much lacing. The aroma is lightly fruity and hoppy, with the taste of smoke, caramel, light hops, and a dark fruit of some sort. It is initially somewhat lightly sweet and bitter, and a bit acidic. Not a bad beer at all."
"The summary is a little boring, but this is one good dubbel. I shall note it went well with my pork tenderloin. It's a good score, but in this battle of Trappist ales, it will need the other two of its family to flop. Chimay Tripel (white label) comes up tomorrow."
"Drinkability = Very delicious. It's just a very nicely balanced, well put together, substantial beer. Don't know if I'd be downing a lot of these in one sitting (it is a substantial beer), but I'll definitely be buying more of these. They're a treat. These monks sure know what they're doing."
"D - A beautiful-tasting beer, and moderately filling. I could definitely have a couple of chalices worth, but because of its filling-ness and elegance, I don't think I could drink a ton of it."
"The first Trappist ale I've tried, this poured a hazy reddish brown with fluffy light tan head. It smelled like honeysuckle, rose, and hops, with a bit of malt. It tasted sweet with light malt flavors and a mix of some honey and bitterness. It had a smooth and moderate aftertaste. There was almost no carbonation and had a nice body to it, being slightly syrupy. Overall this was a very tasty beer, flavorful but still easy to drink. I had no real complaints, but it wasn't anything spectacular either, so it didn't quite live up to the Trappist hype."
"Pours a dark brown with a large off-white head. Aroma has a nice fruitiness, apples and plums. A slight alcohol tinge. Taste is wonderful. Fruity notes of apples and plums, sweet maltiness, and some tangy spice with only a slight hint of alcohol. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and appropriately carbonated. Drinkability is moderately high."
"D - Overall this is a good dubbel but I don't know how often I would go with this one. It doesn't really seem to stand out on its own but almost seems to me to be a Quad or Strong Dark Ale that just doesn't want to go all the way. Plus there was nothing really great about this one that made it stand out to me. A good but nothing special beer."
"Nice beer,I have a older bottle in my cellar waiting to be opened.Life dont get any better then this."
"A very tasty, drinkable brew."
"Highly recommended to anyone interested in craft beers, or someone just getting into Belgians."
""
"A good dubble, but not my favorite. I prefer Chimay's special reserve to this, but it is still a beer that I would recommend."
"D: Another great Ale from Chimay. They're always a treat, in moderation; savor it."
"A pleasure to drink, you can keep going with this until your wallet begs for mercy or the 7% alcohol gets you, whichever comes first. The benchmark Dubbel, as far as I'm concerned."
"D - The taste is incredible and it is so smooth that you could drink this one for a long time."
"Felt great, and was easy to drink. But I couldn't help but feel like they held back on this one. Still a solid beer."
"D - This has damn near perfect drinkability!"
"D: Tasty but I was hoping for something more. Maybe a touch more depth between the caramel and alcohol. A bit stronger body would have helped, too. Good nonetheless."
"I really enjoyed it even though it's on of the most expensive beers you can get on tap."
"Very drinkable beer, This is a class ic example of the style, and one of the better dubbels out there."
"This is a sipping beer. If you are into reading, read a book and enjoy this. This one is a great compliment to whatever relaxes you. Goes great with food or by itself. This is one you need to try just so you know what a good beer should be like."
"D - Its an all nite sipper. It is meant to be savored, not sessioned. I'd buy it again definately. Doesn't weigh heavy in your stomach. Its a very sophisticated drink that doesn't deservered to be guzzled."
"It is sweet and fruity with just a little bit of spice. It is almost too carbonated. Medium bodied and very tasty."
"D: another nice Trappist from Chimay - good flavour, nice body and very drinkable - I could see myself having a couple of these without getting too rowdy. Not the finest, but a great entry-level Trappist for those looking to dive into the wonderful world of Belgian monk-brewed beers!"
"Very delicious, I'm slightly more partial to Westmalle Dubbel, which I find smoother and a bit bolder in flavor. Yet this is really terrific, ranking high on my list of Trappistes and Belgians and confirming my fondness for Trappist-style beer."
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability: Crisp carbonation quickly fades into an easygoing smoothness that is very satisfying. Nice and easy to drink."
"d - i'm not sure exactly what is bringing out the slight sour flavor in this beer. It might be a combination of yeast and citrus which is what my nose is telling me. I like a little more dark fruit presence and spice in my dubbel :)"
"Note: after done with the review, I enjoyed the rest with some Chimay cheese and pretzels. Quite the tasty trio."
"Cloudy golden amber with big white fuzzy head and plenty of lace. Peppery lemon cheese aroma. Grape malt wheat taste. Relatively mild. Lively carbonation, tiny bubbles, very nice full body but light on the tongue. Reasonably drinkable. I am still gaining an appreciation for these Belgians, this was pretty good stuff, as advertised."
"Overall: A good Abbey Dubbel. Well-balanced."
"Notes: I actually liked this a bit better as it warmed. It just seemed like more flavors came out, and the nose got a little stronger. Went pretty well with some chunks of gorgonzola."
"Overall this is a good beer, worthy of it's reputation. I'm usually not into dubbels that much, though I do like them- perhaps I would have been more impressed if I waited for a time when I was craving a dubbel to drink this. It'd be interesting to see how this ages."
"A pleasant looking and smelling ale (aroma is of sweet fruits). Both attributes of appearance and smell are similar to the Grand Reserve (Blue), but the Red has a slightly better price and the lower alcohol effect of a Dubbel (vs. the Blue's status as a baby Quad)."
"Poured into a Chimay goblet. Rusty in color with a tan head that leaves excellent Belgian lacing. Aroma is mainly dark esters, with some spiciness. Flavor consists of fig and raisin, with a candied malty undercurrent. Some yeast and phenolic flavors emerge with time. Medium bodied, good carbonation, minimal booziness."
"Mouthfeel is fairly light and thin (the active carbonation plays a role here), it is actually refreshing as opposed to other dubbels which tend to get overly sweet and syrupy. Very drinkable, especially in a style that tends to disagree with me. Very good. If you haven't tried it, you should get a bottle of all three of their US offerings immediately."
"Pours a cloudy, dark reddish brown color with an off white, dingy yellowish quickly diminishing head, and floating yeasty sediment. Has a fruity, sweet, and sour nose similar to a flemish sour ale. Initial taste strikes me as fairly dry and bland and then opens up into a spiced fruitiness, with a clove-like coriander flavor with an almost dull numbing effect. This could also be the intense over carbonation that almost strips and dries the tongue. Overall, quite drinkable for a fairly high alcohol beer, but I'm not a big fan of the clove spiced flavors in this and in hefeweizens."
"I bought this in a three pack gift set,one Red,one White,and one Blue,along with a chalice.I was not impressed,but then I prefer Stouts,so this was not my cup of tea so to speak.I may give it another chance if it is bought for me,but I do not see myself buying it again."
"D: Definitely the weaker of the 3 Chimay brews, but still pretty good, one of the most drinkable dubbels out there for sure."
"Poured into a chimay chalice. It poured a brown color with a white head. The smell is of malts with a touch of alcohol in the scent. The taste is of malt and dates. The mouthfeel is very light and clean. Overall this is a very drinkable beer. I could enjoy this beer agian and agian."
"Very drinkable - although more than a 750... not sure if it is one of those. I recommend sipping and enjoying slowly."
"Served in my Chimay chalice (of course). Poured a murky brown similar to the shade of real apple cider. Entire 11.2oz bottle filled the glass with a luscious white head (not a drop spilled). Two inch head dissipated into a thin consistent layer of foam; generous and consistent lacing present during the tasting. Subtle scents of belgian yeast, dark fruit (plum, raisin, fig) and perhaps a hint of citrus. Taste similar to nose with the addition of a slightly bready/biscuity flavor. Lively mouthfeel attributable to the ample carbonation, ending in a slightly tart finish. Not much more to say that hasn't already been said. Chimay Red defines the dubbel style."
"a truly great beer, worth the Chimay name ... (Chimay Grand Resérve being a legend)"
"Overall, Chimay Red is a drinkable beer. If you enjoy dubbels, then this would be a good place to start."
"D: This is a good drinker in the world of Trappists beer b/c it is lower in ABV than most. It is something you could have all night long as you would an APA or lager."
"D- Good Belgian brew. Somewhat strong but very good overall."
"Poured from a 11.2 oz bottle into a goblet. Very foamy head that settles quickly, beer appears to have quite high levels of carbonation just from the appearance. Tea-like color with ruby tones. smells of mild alcohol phenols, raisin,plum,fig. Very good flavor, the fruits are apparent,ginger ale,clove. The mouthfeel is very clean because of the carbonation, it cleanses the palate without being too heavy yet has a long lingering sweet aftertaste. Wonderful brew!"
"The 750 ml bottle poured in a Chimay chalice hazy amber brown with a small of white head that turns quickly to lace. Yeasty and apricot aromas are present in the glass along with sweet malt as well. Nice carbonation on the tongue with medium body. Flavors are really complex blend of malt, yeast, caramel, dried fruits (dates, raisins), citrus (orange, lemon), some spiciness, and a hint of hops in the finish .To me this is a good Dubbel and a great accompaniment to my meal of American Chop Suey if I dont say so myself"
"Overall, a very enjoyable beverage. Cheers!"
"D - This is one of those beers thats good for sipping and relaxing with"
"Now, is it drinkable in the sense of, 'could i drink this beer all night?' Again the answer is technically yes, however with the substantial, but not earth-shattering alcohol, sessioning this beer will produce some less-than-pleasant-next-mornings. But the real question with this beer is do you spend an entire night with a beer that is undeniably well made and awesome, but is at the same time, very subtle, refined, classic; in short, the kind of beer that inspired and forced brewers to take liberties with and re-define the style: why try and brew something like this beer when you won't be able to make a better example of the style. It's a beer you can enjoy, but only if you are committed to enjoying the beer; it's a beer that's on par with the master works of literature; it's not an everyday beer, and when you do drink it, you need to drink it with it a mind focused on the beer. With all that said, it's quite possible I completely dropped the ball on this one; the glass I drank it out of (a chimay chalice) has been sitting around for a week or so; it's clean, I just haven't used it in awhile. I had music on at a level where I noticed I had music on, and there was more light than normal. So yeah, maybe the elements had some factor. Still, elements and outside variables be damned, you won't find a better example of what it means to be a beer, despite what my low score on this beer suggests."
"Bready, fruity, intense flavor prunish brown head frothy head carbonation rich flavor, banans, fruit, cream,  clean finish, no bitterness toffee-like..caramel sweetness, full-bodied flavor sweet finish, sweet lingering aftertaste goes down smooth excellent drinkable full of flavor bready aroma and taste caramel/toffee taste crisp, clear malty, honey flavors burgundy hue 11.2 oz short, fat, bottle, copped in a gift set from garys in Madison included chimay glass strong 7% alcohol percentage not noticeable behind fig-fruit, sweet finish.. recommended"
"In my opinion, the taste doesn't quite live up to the aroma. It's smooth, it's drinkable and that's about it to me. I'd still recommend you try this for yourself."
"Edit: I've gone thorough the notes, and have never put the Red on the same par as other Dubbels... just too much carbonation."
"Very easy to drink, and for the price, is something I may have to start drinking more of as a night time after work sessioner."
"A good example of a belgian dubbel for those just getting into belgian brewing. although for an experienced drinker it may be found to be a little watery. very smooth though and not overcarbonated. great taste with little nuttiness but good dark fruits and bread dough flavors. a good belgian if you are looking to drink it all night. great with cheese or cheesecake and cookies. I am fond of it, but get tired of it quickly. It is my choice at most college bars ( mostly cause its the only belgian they have besides grande reserve, and it takes immature college kids hours to get wasted on budmilloors, so the lower abv helps me stay interested and competitive on the pool tables."
"D: Good flavor, great balance, enough alcohol to warm a bit but not so much that it really hits. I'm still partial to the Blue, but this is a very good beer. I could go for a bit more sweetness but really can't complain too much. Easy to drink and hard not to like."
"D: Yeah, it's nice - I could drink a few, but not if there's Westmalle to be had instead."
"Fairly drinkable, but easily my least favourite of the Chimay 3."
"Drinkability: Extremely tasty and interesting. The body and the flavors this brew offer support its drinkability."
"Poured from a bottle into a Chimay Goblet. The beer poured a dark ruby, forming an off-white 1 inch head, when fading, left light spots of lace. Very strong aroma of yeast, along with a light hint of fruit. Many more aromas present, however too complex to seperate them all. The taste is highly interesting and enjoyable. Once again, very yeasty up front, slight dark fruit flavor, and a noticeable balance between the hops and malts. Complex and good. Nice smooth medium mouthfeel. Great flavor, and not so high abv. make for a highly drinkable and enjoyable Belgian dubbel. Overall, having never drank a Chimay product, I was impressed. I know they have the reputation, but so many times, the reputation proves to be wrong. However, I enjoyed this brew, and can see why they are among the best brewers of Belgian Ales. Highly recommended!!!"
"I drank it from a red wine glass because I don't have one of those half-globe Chimay glasses. I really like how the alcohol and carbonation in the beer give it a sharp strength which is still easily drinkable. As it warmed up, it sweetened a little and delivered even more ineteresting flavors. Since I am still a novice beer-geek I don't have much more than that to add, but what I can say is that this beer is absolutely stupendous."
"Poured a stubby into a Chimay Chalice. Pours a beautiful hazy auburn color with a nice size off white head, which leaves a gentle lacing on the glass. Smell is of yeast, spices and cherries. Taste is about the same but I detect a hint of apples in it to. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a light carbonation. What can I say, its a Chimay."
"Overall a great brew. Not as complex as some of the incredible Unibroue beers but still really fun to drink. A Trappist beer definately worth your time."
"Let me start out by saying that when I first had Chimay Red about 10 years ago, it was the worst beer I had ever had. I had never had a beer before or since that was worse than that first Chimay Red. Now, ten years later, and a more ""sophisticated"" beer drinker, it was time to give it another shot. And the result...it's a pretty good beer. The aroma isn't much, as it is slightly fruity and yeasty. It is a great looking beer, as it poured a cloudy amber color with a nice off-white head. It has a nice full mouthfeel. Flavor is sweet with a nice caramel, brown sugar, and fruity flavor to it. Not one of my favorite beers, but a much better beer than I thought it'd be."
"Enjoyable and very quaffable."
"D - Good to try."
"This is probably the most drinkable of any of the style. Once you get into the white and red, the ABV can get a little high to be having too many of these. But the red is so refreshing and light, that you can have a few of these back to back with no real fatigue. Enjoy."
"Red-brown with a funky smell and a nice candy, fruit flavor. Very easy to drink, God bless these monks. This is a perfect trappist abbey ale and I wished I had bought a 750ml bottle instead of a 330ml. I need to drink the white and the blue very soon."
"650ml bottle from Vons. Pours a dark brown,cloudy unfiltered, with a tan head that dissipated quickly. The aroma was rich with caramel and dried plums and a hint of spice. Taste was complex with chocolate in the forefront, other flavors--oak, pine, caramel, and walnuts rounded out the sides. The mouthfeel was smooth and creamy with an elegant fizz. The finish was long and smooth with a caramel aftertaste. Overall: this is a good beer suitable for all occasions. Recommended."
"Review added 11-11-2007, translated from french 2-26-2008."
"So...Drinkability...Yes a ""good"" ratng to me. Given the price tag and the quality, well-matched. Very nice brew. Highly recommended. But keep a few Dogfish's around when you really want to enjoy a session. Sorry, Dog beat 'em up on this one. Big time."
"4/4/4.5/4/4.5"
"d: quite good; well balanced and good fruity/spice flavors; maybe not as pungent as it could be but really a good beer that i could drink all day and night."
"Definitely recommended."
"First of my Chimay tasting and not a terriffic start. Poured from bottle into Chimay chalice. Pours a deep dark orange in color with off-white head. Good 2 finger head but quickly dissolves leaving a thin layer behind for the remainder of the beer, no lace. Smell is of some fruit, alcohol, and a touch of grain. Taste is pretty good, better than the look or smell. Has a slightly bitter yet malty taste with some fruit notes (though I cannot distinguish) and some alcohol. Very crisp and light mouthfeel but the carbonation is too high for me, I find it distracting fromt the true taste. Overall not a bad beer, I think I just expected more. ""White"" is up next..."
"The Red pours a a light off red color with a nice foam head with very little lacing. The smell is malty with an aroma of roasted caramel. The taste is strongly malty with a spicy finish. It is a little bit chewy in the mouth. A very good beer but probably not my favorite of the three from the Abbaye."
"I love malty begian beers, and I'm sure I would have had a biased review if I saw the label before drinking it. I'm glad I tried this one honestly, with the brown paper on it. Now I know I won't try it again."
"D - Hey, it goes down fine, but it lacks much complexity..."
"Nice brownish red color with a moderately sized head, tasty beer but not nearly as good as the blue cap. To be honest this seems to be a watered down ""Blue Cap", not an insult (it's good, Ilike it) but I'd rather enjoy the real thing. Rock on Tribe in the ALCS, put Boston away."
"poured from an 11.2 oz bottle into a tulip glass. Gave it a brisk pour which created a beautiful thick creamy head which left thick sticky lace on the glass. Smells of baked bread - very yeasty - can actually see yeast sediment suspended within the beer when held up to the light. Taste is a very good example of the Belgium ale style - crisp and fruit with a light mouthfeel and nice tight carbonation and very drinkable. An excellent beer - what you would expect from an iconic brew like Chimay."
"The smell is very rich with a strong maltiness and a slight trace of yeast that made it smell very much like fresh-baked bread to me. The taste was very earthy with a finish that reminded me very much of the smell outside after a rain during the fall. I know these are very esoteric descriptions, but this is the first beer I've had that was like this so I have very few benchmarks to go by. I could imagine enjoying a whole bottle or two with a good meal, so I would consider it to be fairly drinkable. Overall I enjoyed it immensely and I think it may have become my new beer for special occasions, and I'm looking forward to trying the other two types of Chimay."
"Not at all what I expected! Left me pleasantly surprised with my first Belgian brew!"
"D - not a beer to 'pound down' all night, but very enjoyable if savoured slowly for an evening."
"A good brew but something I might pass on later."
"I am now really looking forward to trying the beer i have set aside for later (2010)."
"D: Excellent smooth red dubbel."
"11.2 oz bottle poured into a Chimay chalice. The color is of strongly brewed tea, reddish brown, with bubbles constantly climbing the sides of the chalice. The beer looks like it has some substance to it, not thin at all. Decent, but not great head retention, with initial head slightly foamy. The beer may still be too cold, took out of fridge about 10 minutes ago, which may explain the lack of retention. The smell is sweet and biscuity with some alcohol. The taste has some sweetness and bitterness that mix very well, with the alcohol very present but not over-powering. The mouth feel is surprisingly light with perfect carbonation. This is my first Chimay Red but definitely won't be my last. I like it!!!"
"Pours out a brown hazy beer with a nice one finger head.Smells of sweet malt and esters. Very subtle smell. Taste is extremely smooth.Mostly a dry beer very little in the way of hops,,it seems the yeast makes most of this flavor,,and being 7% you'd never know.Mouthfeel is nice,,tiny bit creamy. A really enjoyable beer."
"It pours a nice brown with a moderate foamy white head. Better than average head retention. The aroma of this is what draws me in, it's a slightly fruity smell. Taste is great as well and is very smooth. Drinkability is high. I could easily have a couple more after this one."
"probably more towards thin but it was never watery and it has a refreshing and smooth touch to it; goes down real easy. Generally I prefer such beers thicker and richer with sweet malts to balance the fruits. This was light on malts and high on sweetness but I agree that it is aimed at delivering a different punch altogether. Still a good to great beer; way to go Chimay!"
"Pours a clear brownish copper with a tightly packed tannish white head. Lacing left all over and lasts through the finish. Looks very inviting and appealing. Aroma is of mainly of toasted malts, some caramel and a pleasant fruitiness as it gets warmer. Taste is excellent. Very Belgian-like, with hints of banana and clove, but not too overpowering. Some fruity/cirusy hop flavors start coming through with warming. Very good on the palate. Oily but rather thin on the tongue. Perhaps due to a modest amount of carbonation. Goes down very smoothly. Overall this is an excellent example of a superior Belgian beer. True to style and highly recmmended."
"I've only been able to find the Chimay Blue and Red. The Red is my favorite. I'll try to drink one of these at least once a month. This is also a favorite of my wife who isn't big on beer. You have to drink this in a Trappist chalice to enjoy the great aroma and creamy head.This is a great beer to enjoy while sitting in front of a fire and letting your mind wonder. A truly great beer in my opinion."
"It has expressive carbonation. It's a good medium body. It's not what I was expecting flavorwise, but It's still a treat."
"Not since drinking Rochefort 10, has a few degrees of temperature so greatly affected my enjoyment of a beer. Once it had warmed a little after its 30 minutes in the fridge, this became quite delicious. Like most Belgians, it is expensive, and there are beers that are nearly as good available for much less. Definitely worth trying though."
"Smells of raisins, all-spice, yeast. An alcohol taste is front and centre with bitterness, especially in the finish. The mouthfeel is somewhat better with a smooth, full bodied texture and lively carbonation continuing. Hoping the taste would improve with air and warming, the aftertaste became even more overpowering. I wondered just how much fermentation was still going on with this one! The big alcohol and overly bitter astringency took away from the drinkability factor in my experience. Maybe this should have been cellared a bit longer, I'll have to try that and see."
"D- An amazingly smooth beer, almost perfectly done. Enjoyed this after my dinner as a treat."
"D: Very drinkable - this is a very smooth beer. I can see why the big bottles are popular."
"This is my first time drinking this out of the 11.2 oz bottle instead of the large bottle. Dark red color with a slight haze unless you pour out the sediment-- then it gets quite hazy obviously. Great head that retains well. Mild phenolic aroma with a hint of clove followed by caramel malt notes. Smooth, almost creamy mouthfeel with a medium body. Very low hop bitterness. Sweetness dominates at first and is then followed by a tad of caramel malt and complex, peppery Belgian yeasty flavors. This is much better in the 11.2 oz bottle. This is easily the most balanced Belgian trappist ale I've had. Lots of flavors, but it won't kick your ass like the other two Chimays. I could go for a couple more of these."
"This ale is objectively very good. Definitely worth trying, but it's probably my least favorite of Chimay's big three and not one I'm going to go out of my way for when a lot of variety is available."
"Md body and modest carbonation. Somewhat drinkable, but isn't knocking my socks off."
"This is my first taste of Chimay, I've previously sampled all the other trappist products except for La Trappe. For whatever reason, I find that most dubbels just sorta bore me, and this is no exception, despite it being a finely crafted beer. I'm looking forward to sampling the white and blue caps shortly."
"Thin across the lips but fizzy and coating on the tongue."
"D: This is a pretty drinkable beer. The sweet taste covers up the higher alcohol content making it very easy to drink. I would definitely recommend it!"
"it's only 7% abv but i'm pretty sure the first sip had my head spinning. thank you trappist monks!"
"Aroma is rich and fruity, mainly malty with strong apple or pear component and a hint of spice. It pours a dark, brownish amber that is somewhat cloudy and has a thick but not too persistent head. Flavor is rich and satisfying, mostly malty, strong fruity hint, and a touch of cinnamon or clove. Smooth and lip-smacking, it has a bit of an alcohol bite in the aftertaste. Strongly recommended."
"Drinkabilty: Nice, robust recommended."
"Malty aroma. Tastes of caramel, malt and raisins with a touch of bitterness at the end. Another beer shared with my brother. This tasted great as did every beer we drank that night. Another great beer."
"-Oelergud"
"Poured a dark brown-reddish color with nice creamy off-white head that lasted a while. The attractive aroma is of caramel and fruit. The flavor is malty up front with the taste of dark fruit and a slight bitterness at the finish. Mouthfeel is rich. Another one I have to thank my brother for introducing me to."
"Outstanding! Near perfection in a bottle to me. Let this one warm before you drink it as the flavors are best at cellar temperature."
"D - A nice beer thats worth trying. Wouldn't be a regular in the line up though."
"D: Very drinkable (despite the carbonation). Enjoyable beer leaving little reason to stop at one. However, not as good as its reputation."
"I guess Belgians just don't do it for me. After trying several, and of different types, I'm going to just stay away from now on. Worth a try though."
"Split a bottle over dessert, made a great pairing with tiramisu and white chocolate cake. The aroma was a bit weak, but not surprising for a traditional dubbel. It smelled of the carmelized candi sugar with hints of dark fruits. Dates came out more in the flavor, along with a very smooth caramel malt with a touch of spice. As my glass warmed, subtle, grassy hops came out. Not amazing, but pleasant and tasty. Give this beer a little time to breathe, the carbonation is a bit harsh at first."
"D: This is a great beer. Complex, balanced, and wonderfully drinkable."
"Bottle opens with a loud pop, pours medium hazelnut orange/brown, white head that dissipates quickly. Aroma of belgian candy, wheat and earthy hops. Earthy hop taste, hints of molasses, faint malted wheat flavor. The cellared bottle taste a little dull compared to the fresh one. Don't get me wrong, it's still very good, but I'd not bother holding onto one hoping it will mature futher. The fresh one was exploding with wheat, sweet candy, balanced hop bitterness."
"D- This beer seems to suffer a bit when it comes to drinkability. I'm just not digging the sickening sweet aftertaste that coats your mouth."
"Pours a beautiful dark amber with lots of crimson. Head leaves something to be desired. No lacing to speak of. Kind of weak in the nose. Some toasty malts, some dates, some booze. Nothing bad about it, just lackluster. Flavor is a big improvement over the smell. Starts off with toasted and roasted malt, which leads into a fruit and brown sugar middle with just a whisper of yeasty phenolics. Finish comes back with some more of the higher kilned malts and a kiss of the hops. The weight of the beer in the mouth is about moderate, but the carbonation is harsh. Decent drinker, but, really, the weakest of the 3 Chimays."
"Surprised to see this on tap at the Liberty Taproom, Myrtle Beach. Served in proper Chimay chalice and a reasonable temperature. The beer seemed under carbonated, especially for a Belgian Trappist, and was evident in the thin foamstand and the more dull texture. The aromas are candy sweet, malty, fruity tart, and berry like. Flavors bring the same characteristics as the aromas, and add dark, dehydrated fruits, syrup sweetness, bread, yeast, and cherries. The body was firm and moderate despite the light caronation. Finishes quite sweet with a hop bittering. True to Trappist quality, this is one fine brew."
"D- Ok Dubbel, a little less exciting than I thought."
"Decided to buy a case (12) of the 75ml corked bottles. Probably the first Trappist that I ever had ( about 3 years ago). Pours a nice dark ruby red. Has a nice off white head but it does not last that long. Some nice lacing though. Hints of fruit in the nose. The taste is well rounded, fruity, malty and the hops are just noticeable. I really enjoy this one although the Blue is my favorite."
"D: This is a beer you break out to break away from the norm. I would not reccomend drinking a lot at one time, if only so you can savor it when you do have a bottle. The bottle goes quick and you will feel it a little, but you'll feel better knowing you had a classic brew."
"It's an earthy beer. Malts, yeast, spices, banana, a touch off sweetness, and loads of complexity. Excellent, I could drink it all day."
"Pourd an opaque murky brown with a hint of copper, head is a creammy soapy tan lasts halfway through the beer. aromas, if that of fruit and lovely yeast more like wine than beer. Flavor is INCREDABLE with balanced hop bitterness and a perfect sweetnes, all balanced in a mastered blend of unfiltered bliss, heavy body, great mouth feel, and perfect with my steak, the ceamy finish lasts and paired well with the rich fatty steak, I thought I had died and gone to heaven for a minute. A tru winner if you appreciate REAL beer"
"This beer is by far one of my favorites!!"
"This is a very drinkable beer as all Chimay products seem to be. My recommendation is to let it warm up a bit. It's fantastic."
"D: Dangerously easy to drink. A complex beer with good balance and body. I am beginning to appreciate the Belgian Ales for what they are...True brewing art. Recommened."
"Very good Belgian ale overall. I will definitely revisit this one in the future."
"I had a small bottle of this a few months after the original bomber and liked it a lot more. Both the aroma and flavour were more complex than I recalled, with a lot more dark fruits (prunes, plums), a little bit of molasses. Not sure where I got the ""light"" or ""unripe"" notes in my original review, as there was none of that in this bottle, and it wasn't grainy at all. Really enjoyed it, having not had a trappist beer in a while, and will grab some more if it's available at the LCBO again."
"very easy and not complicated"
"This is my favorite Chimay. A well-rounded trappist ale, with great malty and yeasty aromas. Looks nice in a chalice, with a small but creamy head, leaving a small lace. Tastes of bread, malt, mild bitterness in the end. Alcohol and mild carbonation make for an interesting taste. For the style, the drinkability is awesome, great for those winter days when all you want is to get warm and drink something heavy."
"a classic. pours out a cloudy amber with a 1/2 inch head that dies to a small ring. brown sugar and fruitiness everywhere. sweet with a champagne like carbonation. light in the mouth. yeasty with a dark fruit/banana nose. alcohol is well hidden. a favorite dubbel of mine. it looks as good as it tastes."
"Pours a nice looking medium-dark brown color with some amber red hints as well. Alright head that goes away and leaves a little circle of foam on top. Just a touch of lacing. Nose is good, although fairly mild. Sweetness, a little ripe fruit, malty goodness. Taste is good, although again pretty mild. Raisins, chocolaty malt, some spices too. Feel is good and pretty thick, full body, but not cough medicine syrupy. Overall, this is a good one. The bartender told me it was far superior to the White. I have to say I totally disagree with her; however, this one is definitely a good and tasty buy."
"D: Very drinkable due to the smooth and not complex flavors and low level of alcohol at 7%. My least favorite of the 3 Chimay's."
"The color was orangish brown as it poured from the bottle and a very attractive reddish orangey brown in the bottle; not completely clear--somewhat hazy. The head was off-white, very thick, bubbly, and foamy on the top. The smell was subtle/weak, but pleasantly sweet and malty. There were some nice malt flavors and a pleasant earthy aftertaste. The flavor is good, but pretty understated, I think--I'd even call it a bit weak up front. I expected it to be stronger than the Chimay white, so I had the white first today; but if anything I think the white was stronger and richer in flavor than the red. The mouthfeel was clean and I found it to be a pretty drinkable beer."
"Drank this from the 11.2 fluid oz. bottle, with no discernible bottling date on it. Poured this into a tulip glass. It's a very cloudy, reddish-brown color. A little sediment in the glass. A couple fingers of head at first, although it settled down into a thin, off-white layer. Very nice retention. Smells first of bread and yeast. Hints of fruit: apples, bananas, and something tangier, like cherries. Rich floral fragrance. Flavors are a little darker than I expected. Opens up nicely in middle with dark toasted bread and apples. Ends on a flat, slightly metallic note. But it picks up with a good aftertaste like the skin of a red apple. Mouthfeel is very light. Tiny bubbles that fizz on the tongue like a cola. Overall, a nice example of a Belgian Dubbel. Not the best I've ever had, but there's still a good complexity of flavors, aromas, and textures. I look forward to exploring it again."
"Overall a great beer. This one is going to go into the books as my snobby beer. The one I brag about and always have on hand. Incredible taste and drinkability, coupled with a damn good appearence."
"Poured into a snifter pours a rustic brown in color with a fluffy head that recedes quickly and does leave a bit of lace not much though. Smell is of fruit and honey also a bit of orange peel. Taste is pretty impressive each sip brings a bit of a different flavor to me, the sip has a bit of a sweet fruit with a bit of bready yeast aftertaste, next sip has a bit of alcohol plum taste, this is a pretty impressive tasting brew. I enjoy drinking this thinking of how its made impresses me I do enjoy drinking trappists beer and reading the history of their fine products."
"I purchased this a few months ago, and it probably aged some on the shelf. I didn't get much of a lasting head, and it was a little overcarbonated for my taste, and I believe it is because it might have slightly overaged. The carbonation reminded me of some of my homebrews I forgot about and discovered well after it should have been consumed. The aroma was nice with a malty smell and slight alcohol. It is dark reddish brown, and lots of floating yeast from the bottle carbonation. The flavor is a wonderful malty flavor that leaves a lingering aftertaste that is like fresh yeasty bread. A slight bitterness is lingering also, which is pleasant. Great beer!"
"Overall I love it. You must try it if you haven't already."
"D: The Chimay beers set the standard for drinkability. If surrounded by an unlimited supply, I could drink myself into oblivion. If I am dying, please surround me with a substantial supply of Chimay Red and Blue. I would not regret anything. Long live the very able monks who continue this tradition."
"got this at a small-chain bar/pub called the fox and hound, ordered it without knowing they no longer served it in chimay glasses...wtf? still got a goblet-style glass but it just wasn't the same. needless to say it was the best beer they had available there...they carry a lot of shit, pretty much every macro and macro import you can think of, but sadly very few good beers. anyways, this poured a deep, beautiful, dense ruby brown but still had some clarity. very nice, thick, off-white head. aroma is dominated by dark stone fruit and floral aromas. also some caramel and toffee notes underneath. has some red wine characteristics in the nose. exceedingly complex, i could smell this all day just trying to figure it out. taste starts out with some dark malt sweetness and is as complex as it smells. hops are underneath there somewhere providing balance. ample carbonation also serves this medium/thick bodied beer well. finishes sour, again reminiscent of wine. drinkability suffers because this seems so much like a very complex wine, something you want to sip only small amounts of and enjoy the long finish. i happen not to particulary enjoy sour or winey characteristics in a beer and that is why the taste and drinkability suffers a bit in my scoring. also the relatively high abv prevents you from having too much of this one. definitely something everyone should try at least once, but hopefully in a more relaxed environment to really appreciate this one."
"D- A good example of the style, a nice dessert beer."
"Would try again."
"Nice and complex. Taste profile didn't wow me, but I would happily have again."
"Drinkability: Very good beer. Not the best belgian dubbel, but it is a nice drink to share amoung friends."
"This is a very good Belgian ale. Elegance to the last sip."
"As far as drinkability- bring it! A great quality beer!"
"I poured this beer into my Chimay goblet. It was somewhat cloudy with a big, persistent head and very nice lacing. The smell was sour. The taste was sour and malty  there were some cereal notes. The mouthfeel was full boied. This is a nice beer that Id consider pretty drinkable. It is a good standby if you simply want a Belgian beer."
"Pours a cloudy orange-brown with a one-finger head. Vigorous jets of carbonation at first but then settles down. Smell is fruity and a little spicy. The taste is malty and slightly spicy. There is some sweetness but its not too much. The mouthfeel is medium-bodied and rather fizzy. Drinkability is decent but I'd probably stop at two of these. Overall a good beer to have once in a while but not my favorite Belgian."
"I had this before an American stout. this one really wakes up the taste buds, followed a bit of cold water. nice."
"deep brown, red, orange...depends on how the light hits the glass. gentle white head laces the glass and coats the top of the beer indefinitely. aromas of french toast, maple syrup, clove, caramel, malts, dusty book pages, fresh fruit. how can all of those things smell good together? this is how. the flavors are all of the above with the addition of exotic spices and sweet liqueur. so many flavors, and yet the beer is so smooth and refined, and unassuming in the palate. tastes of a recipe that was long ago perfected, and is no longer being experimented with, because the efforts would be in vain."
"Solid."
"Chimey pours a cloudy deep red with a fizzy head. Aroma is rich dark ripe fruit with a slight yeast aroma. Taste is a caramelized maltiness with a nice yeasty flavor, tart and slightly chalky. The beer is a little hoppier than I expected, but I really like it. It's dryer than I expected, but still rich and creamy with just the slightest hint of alcohol. I'll definitely have to pick this one up again."
"I was thinking that it was a bit pricey at $6.50, but for 750ml it's actually quite reasonable. Not my favourite style but definately an enjoyable treat. My wife liked it too so hopefully I'll be able to stock the fridge with it more often."
"Drinkability- It's not bad. Not great."
"Overall, still recommended. I just don't like the carbonation levels."
"I highly recommend this beer."
"I'm a big fan of Trappist beers...dubbels included. This bottle just seems to leave a lot on the table."
"D: Very sessionable taste, mild, but slightly strong in ABV."
"This pours an deep dark with a good solid off white head that retained exceptionally well. It has some nice and spicy fruit aromas and is quite pleasant, raisins are very prominent. Very fruity flavor but not too sweet. Raisins are there along with a bit of banana. Strong alcohol too. A nice silky mouthfeel and very drinkable."
"Pours a deep ruby brown color with some big bubbled head that fades away pretty quickly, leaving a thin layer that laces the glass. Smells spicy and fruity. Sort of orange & raisin. Tastes sweet and malty with that strange yeast flavor you get from belgian ales. Some nice hoppy bitterness to balance it out. Finishes clean. Mouthfeel is very fizzy, scrapes the tongue. Not too bad though. Overall, it's a very drinkable beer. I like it a lot, but I haven't tried too many belgian ales that I didn't like."
"Pours a murky brown color with a decent off-white head that left some spot lacing. The smell is of dark raspberries, plums, juicy. The taste kind of goes in the other direction; the initial taste is of roasted malts, carob. The ale is full bodied and well carbonated, it takes away from the taste a bit. A very good example of the style, quite drinkable if ye wallet allows."
"A super beer and good example of a dubbel. Although I generally favour tripels this will make think next time I am perusing the shelves. Recommended."
"A hearty beer, which tastes lighter than expected. However, for the price, i am not sure its something one would get on a regular basis."
"D: Very tasty, goes down very easily, not very filling, it has a good kick but not too strong that it catches up to you too quickly. I only had a small bottle, but I could have polished off a large bottle with ease."
"Well, it's not the first Chimay option I'll likely avail myself of, but I'd never complain if this is in my glass. And I think if you looked up ""dubbel"" in the dictionary, you'd see the red label for the definition. It's a warm quaff, with the ABV far from extreme, but it has its way with the senses if left unchecked. And it's nicely drinkable and enjoyable. It's been around so long, and certainly longer than most Belgians, that it's easy to look past, but this is one more good reason to get back to the heritage from time to time."
"Pours a clear burnt orange with a medium head that leaves almost no lacing. The smell is pretty strong with bread yeast, cinnamon,roasted malt, and alcohol. The taste is like the smell, full of roasted malt, ""bisquity"" flavor, and some winter spices. The m/f is light and well balanced making this a good beer that should be tried,but really isn't all that exciting."
"D: Quite drinkable due to its' low abv and inoffensive aromas and flavors. Unfortunately those traits help the Drinkability score, but hurt the Smell and Taste scores. I was hoping for more adventurous qualities to this Dubbel, but I was taken aback by how average and pedestrian it was. Don't get me wrong, this is a very good beer from a legendary brewery. I just hope that someday Chimay decides to tinker with the formula to fully elevate this one to legendary status-to match the reputation of excellence that Chimay posesses."
"I dare say I ejoyed this almost as much as one of my favourites; Leffe Brune. There's just a persistant class and quality that come with Chimay beers, and this is definately no different."
"Overall, this is one of my favorite dubbels, but i am not too big on this style. It really is a whole lot more refreshing than i remember. The bottle doesnt have an exact date, just 2006, but it does seem to taste young. I need to get this more than i do."
"Totally luxurious in its mouthfeel. Creamy but carbonated and then disappears off the tongue; extraordinary in this area. Still, its not something I would have more than one (bomber, that is) of given that it is sitting much heavier than I would like. Nevertheless, a beautiful beer."
"D - I could drink this all day and not get tired. Well-balanced. Would go with most meat dishes; probably a nice pairing with my stew this evening."
"O/D - A nice dubbel that I will probably try a few more times just to make sure I've caught everything that this beer has to offer. Personally, I wasn't really impressed with this beer, but that's just me. By all means if you haven't already, give it a try. Cheers."
"Quite a tasty dubbel -- and one of the easiest to drink too. Very enjoyable and it works great on it's own or with a variety of foods."
"D - Fairly easy to drink, but not really wanting more. I think there are much better dubbels out there for your buck. Of the three Chimays I've had, this is clearly my least favorite. Probably won't be revisiting this one soon."
"Drinkability: Always a pleasure to drink."
"A reasonably nice beer. Drinkable, but with time the candy sweetness became all that I was tasting. This one-dimensionality would get tiresome."
"Brownish red color, nearly opaque. It looks like I have treasure inside my glass. Large large head, decent head retention - a thin layer remains. No lacing on the glass. The scent is nutty and spicy, with the malts coming through as well. Nice balance between the hops and barley. Slight smell of ethanol. The taste is where is this beer starts to really shine: Initially the barley comes w/ a slight hop bitterness. Very fruity (can't quite put my finger on it...apples and raisins?) with a slight trace of ethanol. The alcohol hides behind the hops. The aftertaste is dominated by the hops (but not too strong!), also with a potassium like taste (the kind of feel you get from tasting bananas and dates). This one has just the right level of carbonation and is thick bodied...what a treat going down! I swear I could drink these all day..."
"A lively pop from the cork. Got about 2 and a half good pours into my Duvel tulip. A dark brown color with a very nice creamy head that gives way to a decent lacing. Smell was sweet, but not obnoxious, taste was more of the same. A very mild sweetness with some hints of brown sugar and spices, but only hints. Very sturdy beer. I had this chilled, and intially, the carbonation struck me as too high, and the mouthfeel was off. As the beer warms, the carbonation goes down, the sweetness intensifies and the drinkablity increases. Alcohol is not appearant. A damn good all round beer, and one that is much easier for me to get my hands on than the beloved St Bernardus."
"Medium bodied and well carbonated, this is drinkable, widely available and enjoyable dubbel."
"I quite like this. A nice one to bring out on special occasions."
"I become more intriqued and impressed with Belgian styles with each example I try."
"I'm really enjoying this beer and would gladly purchase it again."
"A freebie for me, thanks to my great son, studying overseas in Amsterdam - I was sent this for the unique chance to enjoy."
"Wow, aged this bottle nearly a year and the results were killer, a yeasty dark reddish brown with a frothy thick head results. Smell is of yeast, multiple fruits, hoppyness, and an alcohol pungency. Taste is thick, dark, flavorful, smacks of fruit surround the toungue and stay afterwards, superb for sipping after a long day, a kicker of a beer and a great dubbel, even greater when aged. Dang."
"Pours a nice brownish/red color with a nice thick creamy head. Light body, full of flavor, bursting with chocolate, plummy cherries. Smell is somewhat metallic. Beer is smooth and easy to drink. Really one of the best dubbels out there. I like it better than Westmalle or any of the other authentic ""trappists"". A good beer if you can afford it, price is very steep."
"Found this beer on tap at a local pizza joint. Poured a nice golden color with a decent 1 1/2 inch head. Smell was very yeasty, not all that pleasant. Taste was much better.. slightly sweet, yet a tad sour, with a peppery finish. A hit of clove and other herbal notes came through as well. Medium to low carbonation. Easy to drink, but not more than one or two. Pair with a nice red meat or a mild, soft cheese."
"Appearance is a dark, rusty orange/amber in color. Smells consists of slight yeast with some apparent spices. Carbonation is above average, head is an off whit/tan in color, and lasts until the beer is gone. Lacing is moderate. A very smooth mouthfeel to it and goes down quite well with a slight aftertaste to it. Overall a very enjoyable beer. I have been waiting to try the Chimays and after sampleing the Red I will try the other styles. I will be going back to this and have some availbale for just sitting back and enjoying a really good beer."
"Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: The beer is well carbonated and helps to break up the sweetness. The beer has a medium body. This is one of the beers I crossed over into good beer with. It seems strange that I waited until about my 250 beer review to review this one. A dam fine beer that I will have again."
"A masterpiece!"
"Pours a cloudy brown color with modest head that dissipates quickly. Has a great spicy sweet aroma. Taste is magnificent, this is so much better than their Tripel. I could drink these for hours, something I wouldn't try with the Grand Reserve. Well carbonated and very well balanced."
"Drinkability - this is decent, but not great."
"Good mouthfeel, great drinking beer. Definitely a nice belgian beer."
"The taste is super smooth and well balanced. It's not the sort of beer that will kick you in the face -- it's on the milder side, but wow is it ever tasty. And drinkable! Smooth mouthfeel with those super-tiny bubbles that you occasionally find in a Belgian. This is a darn fine beer."
"A = Wow, talk about a foamy head, you can't even control the head on this one, it is inevitable. Once the head subsides, it laces throughout the entire glass. Auburn/brown w/ a tan head. S = I smelled some Scotch like hints and floral tones. Some sweet scent as well. T = Malty w/ a slightly bitter aftertaste, there is some sweet taste in there as well. All in all, this is an ok, slightly above average beer. It's not my 'cup of tea' but it's still pretty decent and I would drink it again. Of course, i'm more of the porter type of drinker, but this is still good.."
"Drinkability: An excellent beer, almost saison-like in its delicate complexity and profound drinkability."
"D: To be sipped and enjoyed, it almost forces you to savor every drop."
"This is another wonderful beer from Chimay. A nice righ amber with a solid head that lasts. Big caramel flavors, very smooth, with a hoppy biscuity end. Not the alcohol bit that the Blue has, which I think is the ingredient that places the blue above the red. Incredibly drinkable. A tremendous beer."
"Small brown bottle. Dark brown body with fairly thick, slowly dissipating tan head. Smells malty and slightly sweet. Tasty, but not as overwealming as some Dubbels. Fairly well-balanced. Definitely can taste the hops and fruit influences. Fairly heavy-bodied. Very tasty A decent beer, definitely can see me drinking this again."
"750 ml corked and bailed bottle."
"I very much enjoyed my first Trappist beer, and look forward to try all of the rest."
"Although the many amazing beers I've sampled since joining BA have cut into the ""holy shit!"" factor of this beer, it remains a nice choice and I'm happy to return to it from time to time."
"Not bad but not the best dubbel."
"Good drinkability, for me this is an excellent textbook representation of the style, with nothing thats going to bowl you over, but with certainly nothing wrong either."
"Pours to a hazy reddish brown, with off-white head that lingers thru most of the glass and reduces to decent lacing. Had a nice, pleasant aroma of dark fruit and malty sweetness. Taste was marked by just enough carbonation to add some zing, to the malty sweet dark fruit. About 3/4 thru, the 7% alcohol began kicking in, and this all led to a long, warming finish. I really enjoyed this beer."
"Drinkability: Had a rough day today and wanted a religious experience. Didn't have one. It's ok, but Westmalle kicks the bejeesus out of it, as do many American micro-brew versions."
"It's a great example of a dubbel. It is hefty enough to be a winter warmer but subtle enough to drink anytime. Also a great food beer that will work with spicy, grilled or chocolate."
"Very complex beer. Chimay, master of its craft, has made a good one. Better coser to 50 degrees Farenheit."
"I enjoyed it, but wasn't thrilled. I know there are better Trappist beers and these are certainly the most marketed and available. Worth a taste from any beer lover."
"Seems a bit tired."
"Chimay's Premiere is a pleasant beer, if somewhat unfulfilling. It looks great, pouring a nice reddish orange with a huge head. Very appetizing in appearance. The nose is a stunner. It's a great mix of spice, malt and fruit, with a touch of bread. The flavor isn't quite as good as the look and smell would have you beleive. It's got everything you can get from the nose in the flavor, but sweeter and somewhat thin. It goes down very easily, but it's more like drinking a soft drink than a beer."
"DA: A good looking, great feeling ale that is pretty easy to drink at 7 % ABV."
"Bottom line: Very nice Dubbel that should not be overlooked. I recommend it!"
"This beer pours to an amber red orange with a nice head enough to get my mouth watering. The scent was good but nothing extraordinary. The taste was where this beer lost me. It had a bit of a sour or tart taste. I prefer something a bit smother. Mouth feel was good very similar to a hefe. Overall to me this seemed like an average beer."
"Overall, it's not nearly as complex as, say, a Richefort or a Westvleteren (But then, what is?), but that makes it a whole lot more drinkable, overall."
"D: Oh, man. This is just terrific stuff. The malt is balanced with a bunch of other flavors, and the finish is just dry and bitter enough where you get some beer-like qualities so you know you aren't drinking a sweet-malt soda. This is a wonderful beer, not too malty, not too fruity. Very warming and comforting beer. A personal favorite."
"Get my buzz on- y"
"Overall, the quality aspect of this brew is its balance. I am also especially fond of tasting a little bit of what I am used to--that being the crisp and bitter hop character I have come to love in American microbrews. It is true to its Belgian style, though, with definite notes of spice and some floral and fruity notes throughout. This is actually probably going to become one of my main session beers because it would be very easy to drink three or four of these and not feel like you ate a Thanksgiving dinner or be dead drunk. Recommended for certain."
"drinkability is good. it hides the alcohol really well and is quite nice."
"Drinkabilty --Would drink it again, but it doesn't have the most compelling complexity."
"D: Drinkable but I was expecting to be blown away by this Chimay. Not a bad dubbel though, probably one of the better ones out there."
"Mouthfeel+drinkability: This has an incredbile crispness on the palate. It's a nice beer to drink while it's raining outside. I wish I was richer so I could drink this all the time."
"Poured from a 750mL bottle glistening with condensation as I had left it sit out and come up from 7C up to about 13C. It poured a wonderful hazy, cloudy burnt orange colour with lots of yeasty debris floating about in this particular bottle. Lots of sweet malts and yeast present in the nose. There is also a bit of a dank basement sourness that is very, very faintly present that reminds me of a Saison. It's very deeply buried, but there nevertheless. The taste is mildly bitter with very, very faint hops. Sweet roasted malt dominates, with some yeast making a bready appearance very quickly. Mouthfeel is smooth and wonderful with its pleasant level of carbonation. Indeed, one of my all time favourite."
"I think the drinkability is hurt somewhat due to the feel. Still, an overall impressive beer."
"Mouthfeel is carbonated, spicy, and leaves a pleasant aftertaste. A very drinkable dubbel."
"Aroma was light malt, bread, yeast and a little roasted. Taste was thin and there really wasn't much to it. Not much matliness that I would've expected. Carbonation was still lively, but it had a bit of a metallic taste. I think I need to find a freash one of these and compare."
"Mouthfeel was medium bodied and pleasantly tingling with carbonation. Not a ""challenge"" to drink; complex yet approachable."
"Drinkability: Good, but light for the style. A good beer to stick with for a night, though there are better options within the style and for the price."
"Drinkability - Well, I dunno as I would have more than 1 in a night, but I will definitly have this again, a good representation of the style."
"Drinkability/Overall: nearly as drinkable as the Blue and White, but nowhere near as much character, complexity or development. The most boring of the 9, but a nice low-key, non-intensive way to finish another epic Madison Style Session."
"This is definitely a beer that's worth a try; if you haven't been able to get your hands on it, you may be missing out. Chimay Premiere is simply a treat."
"Simply put one of the best damn beers I've ever had. The original Chimay. The way it looks, ohhhh how I wish there was a 10 option! Fantastic off-white head, with the cloudy orange-red sunset looking body. Head recedes quickly, however, never does become a ring! The smell is awesome with raisins, sugar, molasses, caramel, and lots of other aroma's I'd never even dreamed of smelling in beer. The taste is the aforementioned last sentence except the yeast kinda makes it metallic tasting in a way. Alcohol is well hidden, although sort of prevalent at times. Kind of like a smooth, more refined, Arrogant Bastard. The mouthfeel isn't 5.0, but it's damn smooth. A running trait of this beer. The drinkability is awesome. You'll probably be toasted after one bomber bottle (in my case, 3 goblets full), but damn is it good. Wish it lasted longer and I had a tap of this in my house! Smooth and sweet. Perfect! Or in another case...Brilliant! Can't wait to try the blue label. Dubbel might be my new favorite style of beer!"
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Quite thin but nicely carbonated... a very easy drinking dubbel. For the style, it doesn't interest me nearly as much as St. Bernardus or Westmalle, but it certainly isn't bad."
"This is a classic. Not a sipping beer, a mouthfull gives the best taste and mouthfeel. Best served not very cold."
"All in all, you want to drink lots of this Trappist concoction."
"Drinkability: Could use a little bit more in the flavor department, but drinkability is good."
"Absolutely drinkable!"
"Picked this up at the local grocery store. After 53 hours of work this week, I deserved a trappist =D. I got the corked bottle and poured it into my tulip glass. A nice frothy head, typical of most belgians, formed upon the pour. I was suprised to see the head fall almost immediately. This is very possibly due to the fact that I havent used this glass in awhile and my mom was the last to wash it. Color is reddish copper and alittle hazy, very sexy. Aroma is strong and has the honey-fruit aroma that is present in many trappist ales. Taste is initiated with a blast of honey-fruitiness, I want to say plum, but I don't really eat them so I'm not sure. The flavor leaves with a sweet bitterness that leaves you wanting more. The mouthfeel is light bodies with a nice carbonation. You can feel the bubbles forming on your tongue with every sip. Drinkability is good for a Trappist ale. If I had the money this would be a good sessions beer. All in all I think this is a very fine brew. Great for a special occasion when you can't spring for Rochefort. This is alot better than Ommegang, and a tad bit better than Unibroue's La Fin Du Monde, which I feel tastes alot like this."
"another corked beer (vintage jan 2006) pours a medium brown with a thick head that settles quickly, leaving some lace around the rim. Its got a very light carbonation, with creamy undertones, very clear and light, almost a thinned out version of Grand Reserve. With its darker color and fair amount of sediment, and as mellow and smooth as this beer is, you'd never guess its a 7%"
"This is a wonderful beer. A medium brown color with a thick white head and nice lacing. It has a sweet, molasses-like aroma, as well as some fruit. It tasted sweet, not too sweet, dark fruit, and maybe a little chocolate. Nicely carbonated. I could sit and drink this beer for hours."
"On a personal note, I have been finding that Dubbels are not my favorite type of beer, though I still enjoyed this one quite a bit....might wanna keep that in mind."
"i was a little surprised at how easy this is to consume. very laid back and mellow. alcohol is there but not in your face at all. great beer by chimay."
"Shared a big bottle with a fellow beer lover. Pours out a dark amber or even brown-ish color. Good size head, 3 fingers, at least. It smelled of yeast, fruit and you could detect the alcohol, as well. It had a much more malty flavor and it had a spicy kick, also. It had a crisp mouthfeel. The only complaint is that it is a little heavy. Overall, Chimay proves they know beer."
"As one of the six Trappest Ales; this marks a great start to our flight of Chimay Ales. Next up: Cinq Cents."
"My first Chimay (white) was special because it was the first big beer I purchased in NC after they popped the cap. My second one (Blue) hit the spot because I brought it to share on a cruise at my brother's bachelor party (plus it tasted reallll good). I picked this one (Red) because it was $3.50 and the place had Cimay glasses to drink them out of. The coolest part of this was all the bubbles that floated only to the middle of the glass. Taste was nothing special, notes of fruit and caramel but served way too cold."
"This is a wonderful-tasting beer, but it's a little too heavy to get a higher mark as far as drinkability. Aside from that, it's very solid and one of my favorites. I'll usually pick up either this or the blue when I can't decide what else I want to get.."
"Slightly hazy, dark, copperish-red with a medium-sized, off-white, frothy, slowly diminishing head. Hardly a speck of lacing. Smell is of some yeast, some light grain, and lots of woodsy spice. Clove, banana, vanilla, grape, alcohol and cassis. The taste is all about the clove, from the second it hits your lips until after almost all other flavors have dissipated on the medium-in-duration finish. This looked and smelled like a world-class beer, but the taste didnt wow me and the mouthfeel I thought was a little thin and too carbonated. But still definitely very good and very drinkable."
"It smells fantastic, goes down smooth, a little head from the bottle going into the glass and it settled perfect! Just an all around great tasting beer. I passed it to several friends who aren't big beer people and they all raved about it and couldn't believe it was 7%."
"BTW drinkability is off the charts, especially at 7%. Enjoy!"
"D - I do like this. As mentioned before, it's a heavier beer so too much wouldn't work for me. Very tasty though. I have no complaints."
"Overall a very tasty beer, one I wouldn't hesitate to have another of. But I do tend to prefer slightly less sweet beers and the alcohol content, although not ridiculiously high at 7%, did sort of sneak up on me. I think two of the 11.3 oz. bottles would be enough for me most nights."
"Mouthfeel is nice and medium-bodied with rather little carbonation. Drinkability is good, tasty with a reasonable ABV."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable, this would be great with a meal. It's so smooth and sweet, just overall surprisingly drinkable for being somewhat complex and flavorful."
"The bottom line is that this is a fine example of a traditional Belgian Dubbel. Easy drinking, flavourful, with malts dominant and spice characteristics there to keep you interested."
"Loved this beer and will certainly have it again."
"Overall, an excellent Dubbel. Give it a try."
"Flavors were a hybrid of exotic spices, good ol' pepper, obvious but non-cloying alcohol, raisins, wild yeast subtleties and a solid malt/herbal presence that indicated a top-notch grain bill. Super enjoyable, just about a quintessential Belgian ale, much better from the tap than any bottle I've had."
"It is a delicious beer, though I prefer the ""white"" Chimay a bit more, and the ""blue"" Chimay much more."
"I can't seem to find a lot maltbitterness or chocolaty flavor. In general this is a bit disappointing, I drank this beer before and then I was very happy with it. Not that it is bad now, but for sure less interesting."
"Overall, this is Chimay's best offering in my opinion, or at least the one they really shine best on. However, with the alcoholic content you can't really drink too much of this. Otherwise you'll be taking a pleasant nap."
"I love the Blue Chimay, but the red one is just not glass of beer at all."
"Mouthfeel is smooth, caramely, sugary, with creamy vanilla sliding along the tongue. Very clean with sugary vanilla esters and light caramel standing up to the challenge."
"This is an excellent beer. Those with more exposure to dubbels might have more sophisticated comments to make. For those like me, I think you should go for it. This is a very refined experience. You'll enjoy it immensely."
"Drinkability: Not my favorite example of the style, but certainly one I'll keep drinking again if the opportunity presents itself."
"I will have to try this one again just to compare notes, but I didn't enjoy this Chimay nearly as much as the hype. In fact, I didn't enjoy it at all."
"One of the better Belgian beers on the market, its also easy to find, which is certainly a plus. My only complaint is that its a bit pricey, like the other Chimays. The price isnt outrageous, but there are equally good if not better beers of this style that arent as expensive. Otherwise its drinkable, complex and very tasty. Highly recommended."
"D: It's decent. I'll drink it again eventually, I'm sure, but overall this is the least of the Chimays."
"Chimay Red...here we go. Poured a lovely dark orange, close to amber color with a large head that quickly faded to a perfect lacing that lasted right up until the end of the glass. In the nose, I smelled strong alcohol, candy sugar, a bit of fruit here and there. I suspect that more smells would surface if the beer warmed up a little bit. Taste was excellent with figs, syrupy sweetness, juicy fruit, also a slight medicinal taste to it as well. Im usually not crazy about the medicinal sides of many beers but this one wasn't overpowering at all in the end made it a better beer in my humble opinion. Mouthfeel was the highlight for me, the beer was just perfectly balanced and a real thrist quencher. I love the prickly feeling you get when tasting this one. It was also a very drinkable beer....I think even wine lovers would have appreciation for the vast complexities within this beer. Its funny, I always used to see Chimay sitting on the shelf at the Atlas liquors back home all the time and never even considered getting it. Guess I still have alot to learn about good beer. Cheers"
"Mouth: This beer had excellent whole mouth stimulation and a warming alcoholic exhale after the swallow. Tasted of sweet, fresh raw bread dough and had the perfect amount of carbonation. An excellently balanced bitter/sweet after taste."
"Very quffable & a good starting point for those who've never tried doubles, not the best, but pretty close IMHO"
"Overall: I like this ale, its well balanced and lacks the metallic notes Ive seen in many others. Given its price, however, Id keep looking. Worth a try."
"Cheers!"
"I think this one's my favorite of the regular three Chimay offerings, at least in terms of drinkability. i could easily polish off a 750 ml of this. Not terribly complex, even a bit simplistic in comparison to the acclaimed examples of the style, but it's good and easy drinking. I like it."
"Copper in colour with sweet fruit and yeasty aromas coupled with faint notes of darker toasted malts. Flavor wise, it begins quite sweet, but dries quickly and becomes bitter with some earthy/oaky qualities. The alcohol is also very upfront, which was a bit of a drag. Still a reasonably good product, but I think I still prefer the Chimay bleu... it's a bit more complex."
"Sampled at a shared tasting in Venice, Italy. Light Ruby. Unpleasantly aromatic with notes of bread, medicines, seawater, salt, green plants and dark fruits. Dark fruits reside but the entire front and mid-palate is completely non-existant. The finish however is lovely, lingering and full of a malty sweetness. Once again though, my main problem, as with all the Chimay beers is the total lack of body. Gentle overall, and the complete lack of character from the front to the mid is what disappoints most. It's just one dimensional, especially in the aroma."
"I was overwhelmed by the smell and taste of bananas in this beer! I truly enjoyed the feel of it it my mouth - smooth and sweet and enjoyable and easy to drink. The taste improved as the beer sat in the glass."
"I could drink this the whole night, but would prefer to mix it up. For an extra dollar, the blue label chimay makes a much better deal in my opinion."
"Burnished orange-brown body with a generous tan head. The nose shows herbal -- almost Indian -- spices, dried fruit, and malt. For some odd reason, the flavor reminds me of hot dogs. Yeah, hot dogs. There's malt mid-palate with a mild bitterness in there too. This one drinks soft and easy. It's perfectly drinkable but I'm not sure that it offers too much."
"Poured a murky , dark reddish-brown , with a creamy, tan , well sustained head of a quarter inch. Smell is a musty mix of maltiness , yeast , bread , cheese maybe?, and some slightly fruity aromas. Mouthfeel is ultra smooth and creamy carbonation. Some slight ginger , medium malt profile , bit of medicinal flavor , tinge of coriander , slight spice , and a yeasty, dry finish that seems to coat the back of the throat and roof of the mouth with a powdery feel for a moment. A very creamy and well balanced dubbel. I do favor the other chimay brews a little more."
"Solid Belgian. Don't know if it's quite worth what it costs, but it's still pretty darn good."
"This is a good beer, but for the price, there are many others that I would rather spend the money on."
"Chimay Premiere poured a dark red color with a frothy head that left a nice layer of lace on the glass. There wasn't much of an aroma from this one, just a light malty smell. Taste was more impressive however with a rich, malty, chocolatey flavor. This beer was medium bodied and had a port-like character to it. Very drinkable, sort of the little brother to the Chimay Grande Reserve. There are better dubbels out there, but this one is worth the $5.99 I spent on it."
"Overall: Very rich and complex. Much more so than I'm able to comment on. Extremely enjoyable and begs inquiry. The depth and refinement of this beer is certainly there. Some American attempts at dubbels fall far short in my opinion."
"An absolute pleasure to drink all by it self... I actually wish I wasn't having this with a meal because I would have like to enjoy the varied nuances of it alone. Well sometime in the near future I'm sure I will"
"Flavor is much better. Slightly sweet, with hints of dates, figs, green apples, and even a tiny bit of wintergreen mint. Ever so slight bitter hop finish. Mouthfeel is thick and syrupy, but one sip does not beg for another. Drinkability is good, but the alcohol does make itself present after a glass."
"Deep garnett color. Carbonation bubbles and particals of yeast can be seen. The head is not as sticky as I would like. But, the retention is awsome. The aroma is slighty fruity and bread like. Some alcohol sweetness can be detected in the backgrown. Has a fruity and yeasty taste up front. Balanced out nicely with a roasted malt. The aftertaste is slighty sour and fades away slowly. Once again a great ale from Chimay."
"Paid 2.07 euro for a bottle. Looks OK. Murky dark brown with touch of red. Good head that dissipates. Smell is ok, healthy malt and spice, but lacking greatness. Taste is again strong malt, some burnt, some candied sugar, a bit of fruit. Tough to get past the carbonation. Very fizzy, nearly overwhelming and definitely interferes with the enjoyment of this otherwise ok beer."
"taste is nothing exceptional..."
"Looks fantastic. Medium, non trasparent brown color with a hint of read. Lot of particles floating around in there, which I love to see in a brew. Smells good too. Sweet fruits and melons. The taste is very nice as well. Actually, despite the reviews, I think I like this beer better than the Chimay Blue. Sweet malts are followed by a subtle hop profile and the finish is a little smoky (to me). Good stuff. Mouthfeel is nice too. Medium body and very smooth. Drinkability is near-perfect. I really enjoyed this beer."
"This isn't an awful beer, but I was very disappointed as I know Chimay can make some great brews. This one really needs to lose the watery blandness. I will try this again, perhaps the second bottle will fare better."
"A very enjoyable beer. Just solid in every aspect. Nothing that blows you away but enough there to give you an appreciation for this fine brew."
"This must have been my introduction to Chimay, because I remember tasting it for the first time and saying ""whats the big deal?"". While this is a good beer, I still feel that way. If you're springing beer this fancy, you can do better my friend."
"Color was a deep orange and amber with hues of rose. A little hazy. Even the cap was off white with orange hue. Cap started off nice and big but dissipated quickly to a quarter inch and just sat there waiting. Aroma is grainy, yeasty, and citrus. Can smell a hint of alcohol and green apples. Smell was very strong at first, but got faint by the time I was ready to take a drink. My taste buds filled with sweet fruitiness yet still light and refreshing. Vinous quality that blends well into the slight bitterness of the floral hops. Light-medium body with a medium amount of carbonation. Finished slightly dry and very refreshing. Wonderful beer and will definitely have again!"
"Damn near shot my eye out when the cork just wouldn't budge...then blammo...anyhow, appearance is a very dark murky orange color with a thick tan head that stuck nicely and left a nice lace. Aromas are sweet and floral but not real intense, more subtle than I was expecting. Very nice taste in this one, sweet yes, as others have noted, but I like it, it has a nice fruity, malty and floral taste that leaves your mouth a bit sticky feeling. Overall a great beer...I think I'll have another."

"Very drinkable...could have easily had more; if it wasn't so expensive to order at a ski resort !....a very nice way to reward yourself for whatever."
"Explosive  the cork literally flew out of the top of this bottle as soon as I loosened the wire. Pours a dark brownish-red color with a slight haze. Its a very murky, rustic appearance, with an ever-present, beautiful white head. Nice looking beer, theres no doubt about it. The aroma is a little muted, but theres some notable esters and phenols. Clove and raisins. Theres a little malt and caramel in the smell, both of which show up in the taste. No hop presence at all in the smell, and just a little hop bitterness in the finish. Yeasty. I expected to sense a little alcohol, but its very well hidden. Despite high carbonation, this one is extremely smooth, almost creamy. Excellent!"
"11.2 ounce bottle cellared 2 years. Pours dark chestnut; very cloudy with the yeast pour. The head is off-white and soapy, and fills the glass quickly with a hard and audible fizz. The retention is lacking, and only scarce dots of lacing are left behind. Caramel or belgian candi sugar in the nose, some mild fusels, and a belgian phenolic aroma similiar to flintstones vitamins. The taste is rich with malt and well-attentuated. Toasted crystal malt and/or candi sugar, raisins and dates, and organic honey. The aftertaste holds a spicy alcoholic kick; coupled with very mild hop bitterness and a belgian tart, and slight dryness that cleanses the residual sugars. This creates a wonderfully balanced flavor, while preventing any lingering sweetness in the finish, and thus a high drinkability. The alcohol and yeast notes are detectable, but more of a pleasent farewell than solvent or puckering. The carbonation and body are at a medium level, leaving the mouthfeel both textured and crisp. The hansome smoothness, complex flavor, and delicate balance of flavors make this a real treat worth waiting for."
"Cheers!"
"This beer poured a clear amber with a thick head. it smelled nicely hoppy. Its flavor was of subtle hops and spices, and very smooth, though almost watery. I felt that it had great flavor, but it was too faint to be properly enjoyed which hurts its overall rating, I wish to try this one again to give it a second chance in case the first was in some way defective."
"The beer pours a dark amber brown with a huge head that holds fantastically and laces great. The beer has a similar smell and taste. The most discernable flavors that I can distinguish are cherries, plums, and raisins. The mouthfeel is fairly and the carbonation is even. It feels fantastic. This is a great beer and I have come to really appreciate the chimay line."
"This is the best Chimay IMO. The flavor is pretty subtle, but nice, and the feel is great. A little phenolics, a little malt, and it dries out in the finish. A ""pop"" beer that is very accessible, but still very nice!"
"This is a very fine beer, and exceptional example of a dubbel."
"Quite disappointed. There's just not a lot to this."
"Has a crisper feel, not as smooth as the other Chimay verities. The finish boasts a bitter dried fig flavor. An excellent flavor to be sure, though probably my least favorite of the three."
"Another comment I have is that the corked and crowned version, although the same beer, may need two different review areas as they seem to develop in the bottle differently."
"This beer was very easy for me to drink. It is nice to take a break from hoppy beers for a while."
"Poured this beer into a Duvel glass, I do not have a Chimay glass. Poured with a nice big head which diminished to 1/2 inch. Nice deep orange brown. Deep sweet with citrisy notes, I am going to cut this review short. The Seahawks game is on. Will update after the game."
"Medium body with a crispness and carbonation gives this a nice mouthfeel. Overall, a nicely balanced beer that is very drinkable. I would rank this as good as the blue and better than the white. Wonderful stuff."
"Pours a murky reddish brown Clorox and has a very lively carbonation. It's head is off white and leaves a lot of lace in my glass. It has a very spicy aroma and I swear I smelled tobacco in there and a Hefe like clove. The flavor is just as nice with a terrific blend of spice and nuttiness and again a Hefe like clove that stands out from the sweetness. It's only flaw in my opinion is that the body is a bit thin, but overall this is a really good beer that is too good for it's alcohol content. I could drink these all night."
"Nice reddy brown hue coupled by a sweet, malty smell. The taste is not quite as sweet or syrupy as other trappists I've had. Well balanced malts and the sugar does not overpower. Hops add a decent bitterness to it. I'd love to try blue and white next."
"Interestingly, the first thing I noticed upon drinking it was the alcohol warmth. Then that subsided and I really couldn't taste much of anything. A rather watery beer. I think I'm comparing it with the Blue, with which I am more familiar (been drinking that stuff on occasion for over 17 years). I was expecting the thick sweetness of the Blue and it just wasn't there. Not an utter disappointment; I would drink it again, but I wouldn't go out of my way for it."
"Carbonation cuts the medium to full bodied beer and makes the mouthfeel very pleasant. Looking at my glass, the beer is almost gone already. Great drinkability."
"Overall: A dssapointment, not really a clear taste with too much carbination."
"Light to medium in body and quite drinkable."
"D - Wonderful, I could drink this Belgian ale all day. It isn't too strong and would make a decent session beer. It would go well with a lot of foods."
"Pours a cloudy orange brown with a white 1 finger head, good longevity and very good lace. Smells malty and yeasty. Some spicyness and brown sugar notes. Yeasty, malty and sugar tastes with some lingering bitterness. Slightly fruity. Dry and highly carbonated. I know thats is the way its supposed to be, but I think it makes it harder to drink as it makes me feel more full. A good brew but not outstanding."
"Pours a dark orange-brown and forms a large, thick head that is slow to dissipate. Smells a little alcoholic, with grains and earthiness as well. Tastes a little subdued, bready and sweet, with some orange and cherry fruits as well. Feels creamy, but a little thin, and not quite as warming as I might like. Drinkability is very good, I could certainly have gone for another after I finished this one."
"Cork popped off this wonderful brew like a bottle of fine champagne. Poured to a dark amber with a puffy foamy head that formed very quickly, likely due to the secondary fermentation in the bottle. Smell is earthy and clean. The taste is phenomenal, delicate earthy flavors accompanied by a nice light earthy aroma carried by the carbonation ever so delicately throughout the palate. Carbonation is sufficient, and this goes down very very smooth. Very drinkable indeed. This is an amazing beer, I have two more bottles of this I think I will be saving them for a special occasion."
"Overall, a quality beer. I've had it many times before and recall it being better than this ""vintage", which is dated 09/05. A pretty decent introduction to Belgians for those who are ready to take the plunge!"
"Pours a dense rusty red color, cloudy throughout. Medium density frothy THICK head, a tab off-white, that faded to a few mm but laced the rest of the way. A bready-malty scent to it with a slightly sour tone, nothing overwhelming and pleasantly inviting on a freezing winter night. Malty and toasty on the tongue with something that approaches spicy but not quite. Somewhat dry on the finish and crisp throughout. Very drinkable for the style and ABV."
"Anyway, this poured a dark, crimson color with a fair amount of foam that dissipated slowly. I smelt all sorts of fruits like dark berries, grains, yeast, and alcohol; very appealing. The taste was just a great blend of flavors with the presence of various fruits mixing nicely with hop bitterness that was present but so subtle. The flavors changed as the beer warmed with sweet sugar flavors starting to dominate. The beer seemed to coat my tongue and keep my wanting more, but the high ABV and the richness of the beer prevented me from indulging. Still, a great beer with great flavors. There are better Dubbels out there with but this will always be remembered by me for introducing me to tastes I had never known existed in beer."
"I was expecting more but it did match up great with my meal. I will have to try the other Chimay beers"
"This is a bit too much for me. It's spicy up front but quickly recedes and has a thin body for the style. It doesn't keep me interested, but is a decent example of the style, nonetheless. Wouldn't ever become a regular in my fridge. Get some Unibroue/Allagash/New Belgium/St.Bernardus instead."
"D- This is a very nice beer with good complexity but perhaps it should be served colder than cellar temps to cut down some of the fizz. The fizz tends to wash out some of the flavors especially in the finish."
"this is tasty, smooth and soft, wonderful but quite understated, at a lower abv than the blue i consider this more drinkable and give it a high score. however, if you ask my wallet, the drinkability is quite low. awesome. the kind of beer that makes me wonder why the hell i would ever resort to drinking anything less"
"As far as taste there is a nice crispness to it. Obviously its carefully produced with natural ingredients from the taste and it looks great. Also a great bonus is that it is produced and sold to help fund a monestary....nice to know the some of the money is going to a good cause."
"750ml Pours a nice deep amber color, not much carbonation, huge creamy head. tons of lacing afterwards. Scents of grapes, raisins, plums, kinda sweet. Very nice taste sweet, but with a nice tangy feeling as well. Medium body. Very drinkable, another goody from Chimay, Highly recommended."
"Notes: Not bad at all but not all but not Chimay's best offering. I recieved their three pack as a gift (So now I have two Chimay chalices. Sweet!!!) but when I'm headed out for beer and I want Chimay I find it worth it to cough up an extra buck for the Grande Reserve."
"Disappointing. The blue and white Chimays are far superior in my opinion. I suppose it's worth trying to compare to the other two, but it's not a beer I would recommend to my friends."
"This beer has a medium body in my opinion. It doesnt take to much effort to drink one of these, basically it goes down easily. Im not sure if Ill buy this beer again. I mean Chimay Blue is one of my favorite beers but their I was hoping for more from the Red. When it comes to Dubbels I think I prefer Grimbergen Dubbel over this one."
"Overall: I think I may have had overly-high expectations for this one. It's not bad, but for the price, it's nowhere near being worth it. St. Bernardus Prior 8 wipes the pavement with this one, I think, at a similar price in most places. Good enough, but not one I'll ever buy again."
"All that makes it above average, but for the kind of money you're spending, there are better options."
"This beer looked ever bit the part nice redish color with a heavy present head of white fluff that gave good lacing in its chalice. However, the smell was weak I really had to get close and draw at it. There was some caramel maltyness, and a belgiany yeast phenol smell, but just weak. The taste was bland and uninspiring. I could easily mistake this for an American attempt of a brew-pub. Middle of the road one-dimensional flavor that offer the same taste sip after sip, consistant but not interesting, zero depth. It had a decent mouthfeel and it is drinkable. Shrug no need to waste your money here, go on to better beer."
"Notes: one magnificent brew"
"I recommend this very much. Though its not as good as the incredible Blue and White Chimays. Its also not as good as any of the other Trappists for that matter. Its still really good stuff."
"This beer left me feeling somewhat underwhelmed. It's decent enough, to be sure, but it simply lacks the hand-crafted character I've had in other dubbels. In any case, the red's relative tameness would make it a decent stepping stone to the wide world of Belgian-style ales."
"Overall, its a good beer, but its a bit on the boring side."
"This is okay. Beyond that it's outclassed by most other dubbels I've had. Definitely my least favored Chimay variety."
"This is a very nice, creamy, delicious beer. I really liked the aroma; the taste just didn't seem to quite match up. Still, it's one that should be a staple for any lover of Belgian beer."
"Taste is a bit wine-like, kind of a ""dark"" champagne. Some notes of o clove and grass -- in some strange ways reminds me of a good Hefe-weizen: grass, hay and citrus, but sharper and deeper. Lots of tiny bubbles. Gets more complex as it warms up. Don't rush this: even better at the last than at the first. It's way ""too"" drinkable for 7% -- it's so smooth and easy."
"Pours a cloudy burgundy-mahogany color with a thick tan head that retains ok...nice looking dubbel for sure. Aroma is candied sugar sweet, with a spicy pepper and clove in the background and some light phenols. The flavor begins with some spice notes of pepper and clove that segues nicely into a moderate candy sugar sweetness, followed by a light herbal hops character and a phenolic drying finish with a light alcohol bite. Also get some plum and fig character here and a slight hint of chocolate. The mouthfeel on this one is a standout, creamy and smooth but with moderate carbonation that cuts just enough to make it more drinkable. A very nice dubbel from chimay, much better than the tripel imho."
"Mouthfeel is lively and well-carbonated, doesn't weigh down on the palate. Not quite as complex as other Trappists but it holds its own. Its reputation probably suffers from a good distribution scheme, seen as too ""pedestrian"" for beer snobs, but it's a decent, if not good, beer and better than most US attempts at the style."
"I admire the Trappists' skillful balance between body, sweetness and bitterness."
"Drinkability: Subtle and understated, but there are other dubbels I prefer"
"Drinkability: Well I didnt care for it. In fairness, I will try it again. There are others who rate it very high so it must have appeal I have not found."
"Opinion: This really is a pretty tasty beer. My impression of most Dubbels until now was that they were characteristically over the top with flavor and esters. This beer is like a Bock brewed a bit warmer with less Munich and Melanoidin malts. It has changed my outlook on Dubbels a bit, so I would certainly want to try this one again."
"Carbonation in chimay seems to calm down with age because this brand new beer was full of zest almost overboard as it sizzles a bit. Not enough to sway my vote though as the caramel saucey mouthfeel comes through....This brewery and my palate have met often and I'll continue to patronize. Quality Belgian."
"poured a medium brown color with luscious head. Some suspended particles are visible. Smell is strong of malt with dark fruits (figs, plums, prunes, dark cherries) Taste is very smooth in the mouth with a nice dark maltiness. Leaves a nice feeling in the mouth. Very drinkable, first class beer.Definitely lives up to its name."
"Pours a murky cola brown with a picturesque mound of foamy head. Spicy and slightly sweet aroma of clove and yeast. Thick and breadlike flavor, with clove, dark fruits, and very slight alcohol. Some have complained about the mouthfeel - it's thick and almost milky. I don't mind it at all. Not the most distinctive trappist ale, but certainly a nice sipper."
"Nice burnt red- orange color with slight brownness to the head that laces nicely. Smells a slight noble hop (barely) underneath a sweet spiciness like maraschino cherry and ginger (no, that's good). Tastes quite nice. Good toasty maltiness and a restraines fruit- apricots, plums, dates, figs. Feels nice and smooth in the mouth with flavors evolving over the swallow, and then for a few minutes after. Nice. Not one to suck down while painting the gouse- nice for an evening in with friends and food."
"Appearance is a cloudy burgundy, massive foam and long lived lace. Aroma is my least favorite spice, and the reason I avoid Belgian beers  clove. Doughs and yeast mixed with light fruits are there also. Body is medium with complimentary carbonation. Initial taste consists of phenols and bitter hops offset by fruit, malt, yeast, ethanol and esters. An expensive beer. For those who like cloves, go for it."
"Pours a dark hazy red/brown, big white head forms, goes away quickly with a little lace, different from what i remember. Smell is spicy, yeasty, rich. Taste is full, malty, spices, some iron. Really not as good as I remember it. Carbonation is high, little bit of burn on the throat. Weird."
"This is a very drinkable brew and I have and will continue to seek this beer in bottles and on-tap across the globe."
"Drinkability: I'm sure this is good for the style but I don't like belgians. Sue me, I don't care. Back to the American Craft Beer scene for me."
"33 cl bottle. Pours a dark coppery apricot, with some murk. Topped by a rocky, large, creamy tan head. Nice. Gotta like bottle-conditioning. Nose is graham cracker sweet malts with notes of tin and pepper. A little fruit is in there too (raisins and banana), but isn't overly noticeable. Tempered with yeasty bitterness. Taste starts more bitter and roasty than sweet and malty. That's okay. Wheaty malt is there, but the sweetish fruit flavors are very subdued. Bitterness stays strong as alcohol flavors increase. Finish is yeasty, warming, and missing some malt sweetness. Medium-bodied and drier than expected. Not bad, but not as good as most Trappists."
"A muddy brown color. Good head overall. Low aroma-malty with a yeasty profile. Somewhat earthy and bready. The earthiness comes thru in the flavor-almost seems dirt like. Malty enough backbone but the overall flavor is very muddy. Somewhat bitter and a lot of yeast to it. Ok body. Really nothing special here to speak of. I honestly think the whole Chimay thing is overhyped. The only time I can see buying this again is right at the source. Theres a ton of better dubbels out there."
"Overall... a lot of hype, without a lot of delivery."
"The mouthfeel is decent, but nothing to write home about."
"Overall  Pretty disappointing.... flavours all too diluted for me - no real body to this one... Worth a try maybe once..."
"Good stuff. Poured out to a cloudy amber color with good carbonation, reminding me of Duvel. Great aroma, with notes of smoke, barley and yeast. Sediment was also noted in the bottom of the bottle. Flavor was that of a very well crafted brew. Notes of sugar cane, barley and spice were noted, along with hints of dark fruits. Carbonation on the mouthfeel was very good. Finished slightly dry, but still refreshing. Recommended."
"Poured out a muddy garnet/brownish color with a big head which had to settle down. Smell consisted of malts mostly, which some sharp spices (just like in the tripel), with some dark fruit and caramel? Seemes to be on the sweet side as well Taste was decent enough. Good malt backbone with some sweetness as well as some spiciness. Some dark fruit and yeast mix in the middle along with some earth tones. Mouthfeel was medium-full boded with some lively carbonation. Pretty good. Much better than the tripel that they make, and a solid choice for a dubbel."
"As it stands, a recurring thought as I was drinking this was ""I could have gotten over twice the quantity of Ommegang abbey for the same price."""
"Drinkability: Very Drinkable. If I keep drinking Belgian style ales, I'm going to have to change my favorite style. Just so smooth, tasty, and aromatic."
"A good draft beer that in its own world would be unbeatable, but it's not."
"Better than the blue label, especially in the nose and taste. Seems like there's more going on here."
"Poured a cloudy brown into a wide goblet. Some foam, some lacing. Nose is malt and candi yet oddly soggy like wet gingerbread. Taste is carbonic malts initially, a hint of brown sugar and some medicinal hits. Finish is steely. Mouthfeel is medium full and satisfying. A nice beer, a touch pricey, but I'd never refuse one."
"Very malty, very yeasty, both good things in my opinion. If I were to complain, I'd have to say it's perhaps just a tad acidic, but not too terribly. Overall, a very good ale. Highly recommanded."
"I would recommend this beer. It's my first time trying a Chimay product, and I was satisfied with it!"
"Very smooth. well balanced, and complex. VERY drinkable. I think I'll move to Belgium."
"Dark-polished wood colored brown. Large cream colored head rests atop. Fair amount of lace trails. Fruity yeast scents, some sweetness. The taste is dominated by various fruit flavors, some malty sweetness. Pinch of hops, along with a drop of alcohol flavor. Full round body. Overall pretty nice."
"I'm having mine as an apertif before a nice BBQ dinner."
"Served from a 750ml bottle. Pours a caramel-brown color with a good sized frothy white head. Pleasant, yeasty aroma. Very light, enjoyable flavor. Definitely dominated by malt, with a delicious sweetness that makes for an enjoyable aftertaste. The hops are barely distinguishable. The alcohol content is well hidden, making this an extremely drinkable beer."
"Mouthfeel: This is very smooth, low carbonation body that seems to float in your mouth. Excellent."
"I have always been a naysayer of fruit flavor in a beer. What I usually respect as a good balance between malt sweetness and hop bittering can be accomplished between fruity sweetness and hop spiciness as well. The malt flavor of a true beer is still here. I would guess that the wise monks use a butt ton (as versus a metric ton) of bittering hops in their boil. Bless those monks. I have been a moderate beer geek for a couple of years now. I am afraid that Chimay Premier has expanded my geekiness to full blown. I am ready to try about 100 other types of beer. Malt, fruit, and bitter balance combine to make this high gravity beer amazingly drinkable though a tad too dainty for my dopplebock tendencies. Go monks! One and a half finger head though difficult to pour the last half glass hard into the girly glass they served it with. The head gives way quickly even though the carbonation is quite evident to the tongue. It is not as heavy on the mouth as I expected from a beer of this strength. As a matter of fact it is really difficult for me to grasp that this is an ale and not some type of lager because of how light it is. Imagine mixing two-thirds Grolsch Premium Lager and one-third Moet and Chandon champagne and there you go. If I had stumbled upon the yeast responsible for this, I believe I would have founded a monastery myself!"
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a champagne-esque amount of small bubbly carbonation that comes with each sip. The carbonation is really too much for me and I wish it was toned down a bit. Not one I'd actively seek out again...a good brew overall, just not my cup of tea."
"Bottle. Pours dark dark hazy amber with reasonable white bubbly head which did not hang aroud for long. Plenty going on in the aroma, most notible is dried fruit and caramel. This transfers through to the flavour with a dry finish. Mouthfeel a little light for the style. Alcohol barely noticable, this is one that will sneak up on you."
"I have brewed some ""emulators"" myself, but those monks really know what they're doing!"
"Pours a hazy browned brown color with a tan large full headskie that lasts and lasts. Fruity tang to the flavor which does not quite let up. Sharp hop attempts balance, but without a meaty maltness it isn't quite up to the task. Bold in flavor the taste isn't quite mellow enough for me."
"Another winner from Chimay. I don't know why I have waited so long to try this one...probably because I was afraid it could never measure up to the Blue. Anyways this one poured a very good looking dark amber color with a nice foamy head and great looks all around. The smell was awesome with a very inviting sweetness that was all honey and cloves. The taste was very good and very drinkable due to the great carbonation and nice mouthfeel. The light spices and hops were overshadowed by the very sweet malts and bready flavor but was still quite tasty. This would be a great crossover beer for people just getting into the Belgian style."
"Good, but not $8 good."
"This pours with a large foamy tan head which settles to about 2"" of large bubbles and clings to the glass. I get aromas of honey, caramel, and dark fruits (maybe cherry or current). Taste is sweet and fizzy up front with a little too much carbonation, fading to deeper notes including ginger in the middle, then smoky malt with subtle grassy and cinnamon notes in the finish. Although it is fairly complex, the lasting impression is mostly a muddy mix of grain and honey. It is enjoyable, but is lacking something to make it a truly excellent beer. I would consider buying this again."
"Apperas to be a rusty brown color with a large white head, and lots of visible carbonation. Smells nice and earthy, slight banana and buutter scents, kind of musty. Taste is very sweet and changes flavors several times. The butter and bananas persist, as well as the funkiness. Very well carbonated, goes down silky smooth, just begging you to take another sip. Excellent."
"Beer is good. Happy beering."
"33 cl bottle, at the White Horse at Parsons Green, London. Served in ""appropriate"" Chimay glass (whether those wide chalices really ARE the most appropriate for savouring complex beers, is a discussion of its own). Unfortunately served far too cold - youd think White Horse waiters knew better. For good measure, the waiter poured the beer along the side of the glass, which prevented the beer from ""opening up", the head disappeared quickly and the beer kept too much carbonation. The beer has a brown colour, aroma of leather, balsamico vinegar and barnyard. Flavour is quite dry, well hopped, elements of leather and tobacco. Hints of cardamom and ginger. Aroma and flavour improves somewhat as the beer slowly warms up, but altogether this remains my least favourite of the Chimays - give me a Bleu, please! Still a decent beer, but with the Trappists I expect more. Will re-rate when I personally control the temperature and the pour."
"BELGIUM!!! what else can you say. These monks can make some beer. I have yet to meet a belgiun beer i didnt like, and Chimay Rood in a goblet poured from a bottle is so right on.I love the color, the smell, the flavor is perfectly balanced for me.I have always loved Chimay, since the first time i saw Michael Jackson, sipping his way through the trappist breweries of Belgium. It is quintessential, a must try ."
"Notes: I almost gave this beer a mediocre review. Then I let it warm up more. This needs to be served at the correct temp. (10-15 degrees below room temp, I think). It's a lot of fun, and I hope to try some more and the rest of Chimay's offerings."
"Drinkability and Overall: A good beer, but a little dissapointing. I got a blue one in the cellar, hopefully that'll be better."
"75 cl cork and caged bottle cork dated 5/04. Pours a russet bronze-brown color with a pillowy beige head. Light musty and dusty aromas with a pear-like fruitiness and nuances of clover honey. Astringent from the get go, husky and cocoay malty notes come later in the sip. Earthy and tree bark-ish at times. Light pepper suggestions; sweet, yet dry. A bit too fizzy in the mouthfeel. A very nice drinker, but not as adventurous and fulfulling as some other trappists. Certainly no sloucher, though. Could be earth-shattering to one who has never tried a trappist beer before."
"I found this beer to be easily drinkable. While there are probably better dubbels in Belgium, this is a good one to start offf with. It also helps to have the Chimay goblet, as it seems to add something extra to the experience."
"This is one of the best all-around beers I have ever had. It is a beer that truly reminds me why beer is classified as a type of food. Pours a golden color, with slight cloudiness. Smells of belgian grain and bread. Tastes malty with good floral, hoppy finish. Yeast predominates throughout the drink. This is one beautiful beer. It is no trouble to drink a 750mL bottle like it was a 12oz."
"Not overly complex but surprisingly good."
"Really had a great memory of this, did not quite live up to that though."
"I much preferred the Chimay red over the blue, contrary to the BA avg rankings. Perhaps the bottle of blue I had was skunked, because there was a HUGE different in yeasty taste as I took a step down the ladder to the red. The yeast in the red was present in the taste, but it was much better masked by the typical (if it could be called that) blend of spices, fruits, candy flavored malts. The alcohol content is significantly lower, thus making this much more drinkable, though it still weighs in at a rather hefty 7%. Even though this beer made up for my disappointment with the blue, I haven't been completely convinced that Chimay is worth all the hype. Nonetheless, I will definately revisit this one in the future when money permits (and I don't necessarily need to treat myself to something such as an ABT12 or Rochefort 8). I have already lined up another bottle of blue from an alternate source though, which will hopefully produce better results for me."
"11.2 ouncer sampled, no freshness dating observed, but none needed here. Pours light brune and cloudy, with the well developed lace expected. Spicy, nutty, earthy. Full flavored, very tasty brew, nutty,yeasty, Belgian spicing, candy sugar glowing softly on the palate. Long tasty finish. Classy classic, seek and enjoy."
"overall, a seriously solid beer. give this a bit of aging, and id be ready to pledge monkdom."
"My first Trappist beer and my first dubbel. 330 mL bottle poured into a Chimay chalice. A gentle pour delivers a 1 finger head that leaves nice lacing and a beautiful blanket of tiny bubbles. The beer is a dark orange/brown with a huge stream of bubbles from the etched bottom of the glass. Smells of cloves and pepper. Tastes are also cloves and pepper, with a lot of malt, some hop bitterness, and a hint of alcohol. Delicious. Carbonation is prickly at first, but becomes very smooth, almost perfect. If I could afford to drink this all the time I would."
"Comments - Overall, this beer is a pretty good experience. I am not a big dubbel fan, but this one is definitely worth a try."
"2002 750, all to myself on New Years Eve. Pours beautiful garnet amber in color with a hazy glow, yeilding a magnificant pillow of head that remains throughout the beer, eventually settling into a creamy veil. Lucious dried fruit and yeast aromas, raisens, apricot, sweet spice, anise, bread,and honey. Taste is similar to aroma with lots of fruit, cherries, sweet malty bread, floral and herbal hops, and spicey yeast. Very rich and complex with a medium mouthfeel and ample carbonation. Finishes rather dry with an little nip to remind you that it's 7%. I've had this beer quite a few times now and this bottle is the best tasting I've ever had."
"Mouthfeel is velvety smooth while slightly thinned by carbonation. I would drink this beer daily if it weren't so expensive."
"A great beer, and a brewery that is worth the appellation of 'classic'."
"Corked 750 ml bottle, had this a lot but never reviewed it, here goes. Pours mahogany with a thick creamy off-white head. Aroma of cloves, biscuits, a bit winey and some dark fruits. Taste was some malt and fruit up front, with some spices and biscuit in the middle and a warming finish with a touch of hops. Mouthfeel was almost crisp at first, but grew creamy and smooth as it warmed. This is fine brew and very readily available, sure the white and the blue are even better, but this is a fine Dubbel."
"The drinkability is excellent for this type and maybe my favorite in the Chimay family."
"Overall this is not a bad brew, certainly nothing to get really excited about, but it is a solid beer. It really could use a boost in the malt intensity / body department though, it just seems a bit thin."
"750 mL bottle poured in an oversized wine goblet. I was able to get the whole bottle in the glass, with room to spare. The glass is supposed to hold about 1000 mL of liquid. Still, it could not contain that head. Huge. Had to stop, let it settle, then pour again ever so carefully. When the final drop falls out of the bottle, I'm left with a not quite brown, somewhat orange nectar. With a head three fingers thick and creamy. When held very close to a light, the beer is a hazy orange, and I can see little bits of yeast floating around. Oh, I poured the yeast in. Smell is raw malts, bread, honey, alcohol and some floral hops. Very faint floral hops. Taste immediately starts out sweet. Honey and bread. The sweetness grows, as the honey becomes more pronounced and the bread changes to almost a pudding flavour. Bread pudding? I've had bread pudding once, a long time ago. This flavour reminds me faintly of it. Aftertaste is sweet, with a mild bitter zing. Throughout this flavourful experience, the hops are their in the background, adding just a mild balance for a terrific beer. Mouthfeel is excellent. Cannot be improved. It's creamy, thick, coats the tongue, mouth and throat, and yes has a light carbonation that teases the senses. Highly drinkable. I can sip this for hours. In fact, that's what I'm doing now."
"Poured a cloudy reddish brown color, with a nice 3 inch creamy head that dissapated quickly. Nose is of fermented fruits. Taste starts off with a blast of double fermented malts and finshes with a slight subtle hop. The whole trip is pretty smooth! Mouthfeel is very fulfilling and is also lively enough to keep things very interesting. Overall drinkability is pretty good, a very enjoyable beer!"
"The head is almost tan, but not quite. Starts out big and full and dies way to quick. Smell is fruity with a nice yeast kick at the end. I was expecting more from the taste. Everything was there, but nothing really grabs me. Mouthfeel is thick and dry. One bottle is plenty for me, there is certainly nothing wrong with this beer, I've certainly enjoyed many bottles, but there is something lacking in the flavor."
"Drinkability is pretty good, the more I drink this the more I like it."
"Good body to this one, somewhat chewy. A good dark beer for a winter's day."
"This beer pours an orange brown with a small quickly receding head. Leaves decent lace. Aroma is mild floral. On the tongue this beer is very smooth, a bit thin, minimal bitterness. Nice Belgian yeast character. Alcohol subtle. Overall, a little thin but I had this after the Blue (9%) -- quite nice."
"I could (and will) drink lots more of this. Moving on to the Blue and Cream labels later."
"The smell is of dark malts, caramel, and a bit of alcohol. The taste brought more of this, with some amount degree of esters as well. It's a well blended and balanced brew, although it's lacking the complexion found in some of the competition."
"Reddish brown pour. Dense, thick head. Very small bubbles that lace well. Slightly fruity, musty smell. Smooth and creamy start, with a slightly bitter aftertaste. Good dubble, but not great. Flavor is a bit too subdued compared to other examples of this style."
"This has a light hint of carmel flavor and is just delicious. Rather expensive, but worth the money! You will love drining this beer for its taste and nouthfeel. You will appreciate even more if you a have a couple domestics lights before sampling this one!"
" Not my favorite style,but a decent brew nonetheless."
"This beer is pretty easy to drink. It has a good balance of carbonation and body. Though not a beer I'd have all the time, it's not something I'd hesitate to buy again."
"A better beer than, say Milwaukee's Best, but not a match for St. Bernardus or even Allagash!"
"Drinkability: Oh, it's easy to enjoy and rather common nowadays. I'd usually look to the white or blue, but the red is a good intro to Belgian beers and is easy to enjoy. As with all imports the price is a consideration, especially with more interesting items to pick from, but Chimay is a tasty brand and one that keeps its products rather consistent. Nice beer."
"Overall, I personally didn't care for the flavor at all (pear and champagne). I really don't like champagne and this was way too similar for me. It was pretty well made and did get a little better as it warmed, but I was already tuned into the flavors I didn't care for."
"Pricy, but definitely worth drinking sparingly. Unless you've got a six-figure salary or a trust fund, pick one up every once in a while, savor it, and then forget it exists."
"I didn't see a vintage date on this (if I recall the bigger bottles have it on their cork but the little ones lack a cork). The beer poured a clear golden-amber with a nice tan head that lasted very nicely. The aroma was a touch worty-malty with some slight mustiness and a touch of melon and spicy vanilla (but not really strong) - I expected more esters for the style, and complex raisin notes, but the aroma was nice. The flavoer was superb - fully malty, robust, with caramel and toffee notes as well as some toasted bread. The bitterness was not dominant and was easy to miss, meaning it blended well with the malty profile of the beer. Also the alcohol didn't dominate either, and was almost not noticable. This one could get very dangerous very fast. Wonderful."
"Now for something else a bruin/dubbel.... Apearance good but little light to my taste and not completely clear. Smell hops and some caramel so OK. Taste gets more sweet while I drink the 0,33 l bottle but doesn't get over the sweet edge, that with some caremelmalty taste in it makes it in my eyes a good bruin beer."
"Monstrous foamy Chimay head that diminished well but left behind a thick cottony lacing. Sweet floral and yeasty fragrance. Also aromas of stone fruit, bubble gum, and cotton candy. Flavors of citrus and candy-sugar. Alcohol is noticeable. Lively champagne-like mouthfeel but medium-bodied and silky smooth. Very nice."
"Pours a medium reddish brown with a large slightly off white head that lasted a good while. Smell is fruity with a touch of white pepper sharpness and what seemed to be just a touch of camphor. Taste is malty and fruity strong at the beginning. The spicyness seems to come in just when the beer might seem to be getting too sweet. Some tartness at the end but not a lot. Over all a steady offering. I would drink it again, but at the price I might choose something with a bit more personality"
"Though I prefer the Chimay Cinq Cents best of the line, I do try to get in a few Reserve's and Grand Reserve's a year. When I first tried it about 12 years ago, I found it shocking and nearly undrinkable; now it's just one of a number of trappist and abbey beers I drink regularly, and though it's not the most interesting one out there, its still a classic."
"Very enjoyable. Not the best dubbel I've had but definitely worth a try. The heavy alcohol aroma/presence isn't hidden well at all and 'could' limit the amount of pints consumed. Otherwise a nice dubbel."
"Hazy, dark reddish-brown. Thick off-white head that settled to a fine lace after a couple minutes. Light clove and peppery spiciness, some malt sweetness, and fruity esters were present in the aroma along with some light phenolic character. Most of the aromas carried through into the flavour with much less spiciness and a little boost to maltiness. Additionally, there was a slight alcohol warming, the fruitiness was reminiscent of plums, and there was a light bitterness providing some balance. The finish was more malty, with little bitterness coming through. Medium/high carbonation adds to the medium body to produce a very smooth texture."
"All in all, it seems like a very good beer, for one of my early ventures into the style."
"This is a cloudy dark amber / brown ale with a small beige head. A sweet fruity aroma with a spicey hop characteristic. The fruity sweetness tantilizes the tip of your tongue at first. Then a smooth spicey hop presence perculates on the middle of your tongue and the finish leaves a great tasty coating in your mouth."
"Boom! I popped the cork, and poured this garnet (or darker - where's my home depot color match) liquid. There was little head formation, but the aroma of candied sugar, and raisins was enticing. The brew was light bodied, and well tempered. As dubbels go, it seemed mild but employed a palate of flavors to create subtle and shifting moods. The sugars and raisons were the dominate flavors, but some hints of banana and maybe even close made their way into the flavors. Each taste seemed slightly different but always enjoyable."
"This beer is much of what I expected, very flavorful and complex. I can't wait to try the blue and tripel ales."
"Pours a redish brown with a off white headthat doesn't last long. Aroma is good sweet fruity and malty with light wiff of alcohol. Tastes is malty with light fruit flavor and light yeasty bread flavors followed by lightly bitter finish. Mouthfeel is light medium drinkability is good but honestly for the price you can get so many better beers. I know lots of people think highly of Chimay but I fail to see why, still have the blue to go hopefully it will live up to the hype."
"The only improvements that could be made to this beer would be to make it a little less carbonated and the mouthfeel is a little dry. Other than that, a top-notch beer that was very enjoyable. Can't wait to try the Chimay Blue..."
"drinkability: good, i could go through a bottle or 2 in a night."
"(Aged for two years, a bottle of this beer takes on an even better aroma, which is hard to believe. Now, strong pineapple aromas. Strong ""meat"" smells: not the roasted aromas of a burnt malt such as in a stout or porter, but a much cleaner, spiced meat smell. I cannot get enough of the aroma--there are so many nuances. Massively strong fresh bread/yeast notes dominate. Nuts, pine wood--it goes on and on. Ageing has also created a smoother mouthfeel, with more phenolic warmth. Upon my word, you have not truly tasted this beer until you have aged it for a few years. This makes me want to go out and buy 12 of these and cellar them, to save for very special occasions.)"
"This beer pours a cloudy, dark reddish caramel color with a large off white head. The smell is fruit and yeast. Reminds me of red wine. The taste is good but I was a little disappointed. I was expecting something more complex. I tasted a nice cider and wine taste along with yeast. Hop flavor was almost non existent. This beer is smooth and the carbonation is good. This beer is absolutely better than most, but does not quite live up to the price it commands. If you have the chance to try it, do so."
"Patience is key, grasshopper. At first, this beer comes off as a bit overspiced and too upfront. However as it warms and decants, it really reveals itself and provides layer upon layer of unique flavors. This is a beer to savor over the course of an hour or so; otherwise, I think much of what it offers is lost. Complex and rewarding for those with the time and self-control to do it right."
"Excellent Beer here. Enough Said! The appearance and aroma were a perfect example of a belgian abbey. Nice thick head that remained until the last wonderful sip. The only way to enjoy one of these is with the silver tipped chimay chalice. I am very excited because I had this at a new bar/club so they may have just found my weakness for their business."
"A very good beer and one of my new favorites. Very drinkable."
"Pours a murky cola brown under a reddish brown two finger head that settle a bit too quickly, lacks contour and leaves no lace. The nose is mild, with a hint of sweet fruit (raspberry?) and yeast. The mouth is light and quite prickly. The taste is disappointingly thin. There's a bit of fruity sweetness and a healthy portion of yeast, but little else and nothing particularly noteworthy. There's a touch of hops once it starts to warm, but this is remarkably bland for the style. It's not bad, but compared to its siblings and cousins, this is definitely a weak sister."
"($7.49 / 25.4 oz Brown champagne style bottle corked and caged)"
"Overall, this is one of the best I've tasted. Meant to be savored like a fine dessert wine. Those monks know what they're doing!"
" I'd call this a dinner beer, it goes better with food than just about anything I've had. It even went well with chilidogs. There's something about that initial sweetness and food that made me savor every sip and bite."
" The finish is drying with a bready sweetness and herbal after taste. This is a wonderful ale brewed with care and just begging to be served with a rich festive dinner. I like to buy the large bottles and let them cellar a while to bring up some more complex flavors."
"Pretty decent beer, easy enough drinking, nothing to overwhelm you for better or worse."
"John"
"Poured from 330ml bottle. Strong aroma of cherries and currants. Head was creamy, with no lacing in my Chimay glass. taste of raisins and malt. Wet and smooth finish. The warming effect comes gradually, with no alcohol bite. This dubbel is nearly a perfect winter beer."
"D&N: Very tasty, nice aromas. Really fun drinking this one out of the proper glass."
"i just drank four PBR's so i'm sure that my taste buds are numbed and and that this review may be a bit off, but maybe not. smell is fruity with light grain. color is very nice. a deep copper amber. head is foamy large and loud bubbles that didn't stick too well. taste is fruity and citrus. i dont pick up very much hops. i'm glad i tried it, but it will be a long time before i buy it again."
"Split a 750 of this with a friend over the weekend. It was my first Chimay product. It poured a deep orangish/brown color with a billowing white head into my Guulden Draak tulip glass. Smell was loaded with spice. Taste was nice but not overly complex. Hints of clove complement the strong yeast character of this trappist. Mouthfeel was a little bit thin, thus it didn't pair well with the taste. Drinkability would be one of this beers strong points. I could sip on these all night."
"Notes: An amazing beer. This is a good example of how monks made thier reputations. The apperance of this is almost perfect."
"I must say I was a little underwelmed. The competition is very tough in the Belgian teritory."
"I found the taste really hard to define. It is such a great and smooth balance of all the ingredients. The yeast is fairly present, and I detected some citrus aspects, grapefruit, lemon and oranges. The lemon gives the beer a refreshing aspect, balanced with the hops. Hops come afterwards, but in a very natural way, like the normal following of the malts and the yeast.It's more about the flower and fruit aspect of the hops than about mere bitterness. A very enjoyable mouthfeel. Not my favorite among trappist beers, but stilla very good brew."
"Over all this is a very nice brew. First experience with this brew and will have to try the 750 ml next and then on tap at Mahars. Also will open my eyes to try some of the other offering from Bières de Chimay."
"It is a rust brown color with a slight haze and a soft, creamy head. The aroma is spicy and fruity with some bread quality to it. It is malty and is balanced by the spicy phenols and alcohol. There is a slight metallic tinge in the taste as well. It finishes drier than I would have expected for such a malty beer."
"Drinkability is very good but again these beers are so infinitely better out of the 750ml bottles."
"I have to say that this is definately a good beer, although I feel I may not be experienced enough to recognize some of the complexities here. The lack of a definable hop presence also puts me back a little, but I feel I could grow to enjoy the style in time."
"A solid dubbel, not really up to par with the smaller trappists"
" An excellent Trappist ale, among Belgium's finest. I wish I could afford to support these nice Monks on a more regular basis."
"It's easy to forget how good a beer is when you haven't had one for a while. The Chimay Red pours a brown to ruby red with a clean white head and some lasting lacing. It has a crisp aroma with hints of the malt and clove as well as some alcohol accent. The taste is simply great. This in my opinion is one of the best beers made. It has a multiplicity of taste that is hard to find in other beers although it is a classic Abbey beer. The strongest taste is of malt, a little smoky but not like a porter or stout. There is a hint of clove and carob, but just a hint. There is a fruitiness that reminds me of grapes and that back of the mouth bitterness of hops. This feels great in the nose, in the mouth, and going down. This may be addicting."
"Pours a ruby/golden color with a thick foamy head and decent lacing. Smells of sweet and spicy notes and a yeasty character. Tickles the nose. Very sweet smooth taste but a little watery in the feel. The body is lacking that kick. Spices and herbs are very present...mainly ginger comes to mind. Tastes a bit of candied sugars. Nice sweet aftertaste but it's missing something, still a quality brew."
"The aftertaste is also a little sour, but otherwise, this is a great beer."
"Presentation: 33 cl stubby bottle, poured into a Chimay Goblet. Pours a medium brown with a slight red/orange cast. Slightly translucent, with a 1-finger high white head with small bubbles. Aroma is very gentle, nice, not strong and overpowering. Slightly sweet with sweet fruit-candy aroma (raisins/dates) and maybe a little chocolate. Flavor is slightly sweet like the aroma, but has a firm bite of hops. As the drink warms in the mouth, an unpleasant medicine-like sharpness comes aroound that ruins the nice flavors that come before. Overall, I was unpleasantly surprised after all the good things I had read about Chimay. This is my least favorite of the Trappists that I have tried so far."
"A very good beer to have around, and my second favorite among the Chimay beers."
"The beer pours a cloudy brown color with a thick off-white head that lasts. The aroma is good. It has a malty, yet very spicey scent. It smells like there are some crystal malts and ginger used. It has a strong rootbeer type aroma. The taste is good. It is light with a watery finish. It has a decent belgian brown flavor to it. It is smooth going down. There is no sign of an elevated abv. taste. The mouthfeel is great. It is a low/medium bodied beer with good carbonation . This beer drinks well; an excellent sessions beer."
"The big, bubbly, khaki head leaves a little lacing. Ruby brown colored beer that seems to glow. Nutty, malty, mellow plums mix in the aroma. Light fruit, not apricot maybe apple, with dose of yeast, some caramel maltiness and some alcohol. Fizzy mouthfeel makes the body feel lighter then it is."
"Taste was great - extremely smooth...woody, nutty...a little bit fruity but definitely not overly sweet. Medium texture. An excellent beer."
"Note: seems to be what many other brewers are striving for, that is, complexity without hitting you over the head, American micros should pay attention"
"Poured cloudy brown-orange with a small off-white head. The aroma actually had a bit of a 'bite' to it -- peppery floral with undertones of malt. The mouthfeel was thick and fizzy from the carbonation, with almost a nettley feel on the palate. It tasted toasted peppery and very smooth, with a complete lack of bitterness in the aftertaste. The whole brew felt 'regal' to me, and it seemed eminently drinkable. Very pleasant."
"It poured a wonderfully cloudy amber, with a thumbs-width of tan head. It had a very fruity smell. The taste is a strong yeast, which should be expected from a sustaining beer such as this. A very satisfying taste it mixed well with cheese and bread. It should be excellent with a meal or as a meal. The feel was superbly smooth with a medium body and an oily finish. This beer is highly drinkable."
"Spoils of the 10/11/03 Knoxville Raid."
"This Chimay poured a deep red with a good head that lasted till the last sip. The lacing was moderate. The smell was of a very spicy and fruity nature. The taste was inline with the smell. A slight spice to it with a fruity almost pear like taste. A malt flavor was also present but much less than the other flavors. The mouthfeel was moderate and very nice."
"Cheers! Life is good my friends."
"I have mixed feelings about my first Chimay. It isn't as good as expected, but perhaps my expectations were too high. It's a good beer and I'll probably drink it again. That said, it's far from a favorite."
"A good beer."
"Above average mouthfeel, easy finish. The Chimay Red really was a good introduction to the Trappist style. I'll be sampling more."
"Drinkability: Good stuff. I prefer Chimay Blue."
"Very good"
"No evidence of alcohol to the nose or taste."
"As for the taste, although it is very nice, it is a dryer representation of its sisters, where the basic elements of wheatyness, hoppyness and maltyness are present, but the taste fades from the embracing sweetness of the others to a stronger bitter feel that, although very nice, doesn't topple my bias towards Grande Reserve."
"crown capped this is minimum 4, cork is between 3 and 3.5. maybe its just me, but the red just isnt condusive to a cork. the blue gets away with it far better."
"Three and a half years after my first bottle, and it is a staple when I take a nice corked 750 ml. to a party. Molasses and creaminess in the yeast. Keeps on drinkablity."
"Well, that was pretty good. At 7%ABV, the alcohol content doesnt come through to much until near the finish. A complex brew worth seeking out."
"Overall this is a well crafted ale. Sadly it is a little too sweet and tangy for me."
"Sampled 10/23/03"
"a decent dubbel but i think there are better out there."
"I could drink a few of these in a setting, especially if with dinner - a bit surprising for the 7% alcohol."
"Otherwise, great stuff."
"This beer is amber in color (emphasis is on red) with a reasonable sized tan head. Starts somewhat murky but progresses further as more and more yeast is poured. The smell is rather tame for a Belgian abbey style beer. Fruity with a slight nutty aroma are noticed in the smell. Tastes rather malty with a decent hop bitterness. This beer is not as fruity or as ""big"" as the blue label. Malty and somewhat spicy. Subdued fruit flavors, particularly banana and citrus fruit. Quite crisp and very drinkable."
"Pourred a copperish brew with a nice big head. The head stayed on top for a long time. Very complex spice with a not too distinct alcohol taste. I would describe the taste as sweet with a light bitterness aftertaste. Very firm body. This is classic and can never get enough of this."
" The flavor starts out with a sweet malty flavor with a touch of fruits. Soon after, I pick up a nice citrus bite followed by some spices. There is a lot more to this than the white. Deep malt flavors provide a solid backround for the finish which gives way to a nice spicy aftertaste. Delicious fruity burps really add a nice touch. I picked up on some metallic flavors about half way through, but it was only for a sip or two, wierd. This is a pretty good drinking belgian. I think the blue reserve is by far the best from these guys, but you should give this one a whirl."
"Quite a nice brew! Poured a dark amber color with a smaller head than I would have liked but left a good amount of lacing. Yeast sediments flow freely throughout my glass. I smell lots of sweetness and some other nondescript flavors. The initial taste reminds me of some sweet candy I've had before (not sure what though). As I continue more flavors show. A complex mix of bready yeast and spices create wonderful complexity. Deeper malts also come through (maybe caramel). Quite nice. Not extremely complex but still was a great multi-dimensioned brew!"
"It's very warming, but not treacly like a lot of other high-alcohol beers (it's 7%). It does have a fruity aftertaste, and goes down very easily. I could drink about 3 of these before I wanted something lighter (or fall asleep). I'm not sure it's a beer to accompany a meal (it is almost food in itself), I always drank blond beers when I was eating red meat or Mussels in Belgium, I never really considered trying a heavy beer with food."
"The macro of the Trappist Ales, if that's possible. Anyway...Appearance: deep amber brown with an fluffy creamy textured tan colored head very nice retention lacing is trademark Belgian lacing tiny webbed even patterns. Aroma: Mild fruit tones of apple and raisin variety are evident a bit of a musty breadiness their I'm guessing product of the yeast and a mellow malt profile is here with hops blended into the harmonious mix. Taste: This one by far when compared to other Belgian ales lacks in comparison most of the time, flavor has a musty finish the fruit isn't quite as apparent as in the aromatics flavors seem dull here not as much of an orgy of flavor as I would like to occur there is however a breadiness mixed within the flavor some bittering hops here in the finish but overall overrated on reputation alone in my book. Mouthfeel: Medium bodied creamy texture nice no complaints and not too much praise. Drinability: Yeah it's clean and finishes nicely but hand me a bier from Brewery Ommegang anyday before Chimay Red (Premiere)."
"Poured very dark, fruity hop aroma, mildly hop fruit taste, hard to distinguish what kind of fruit, alittle carmel sweet in the middle,and seemed to get sweeter as it went along. The strenght of this brew sneaks up on you.Glob of foam stays on top till the end"
"Poured a dark brown with off-white head. Smells of yeast, rich malt, fruit, and rum. Tast is malty and evenly spicy - hint of white pepper, I think. The mouth is very full, and the beer is very filling to drink - dinner in a bottle! This was my first Chimay, and part 1 of a 3 part vertical Chimay tasting."
"This beer pours a brown slightly reddish color with about half an inch of white head or so. The carbonation can be seen from the constant bubbles coming up from the bottom of the glass. It has a fruity smell of plums and raisins and a nice malty smell. The first taste is that of sweetness like caramel and then it goes into the fruity taste. The malt a slight alcohol taste is also pleasant. The taste is very crisp and pleasing to the mouth. It has a heavy mouthfeel that tells you this is not your run of the mill beer. I would recommend drinking this brew at home with the proper glassware. This beer is relatively easy to find and it will cost you a few dollars more then the average beer but it is well worth the expense."
"pours out a thick and luscious dark copper amd amber colour. some sediment and other floaties milling around. a rather large and fizzy head appears and reduces rather quickly. stiff musty aroma...dark ripened fruits and yeast. somewhat winey in nature. tastes and flavours are rather subdued...malt flavours are of the caramel nature, with slight wooden notes followed by lots of ripened fruits. i like the flavour and it's quite appealing. mouthfeel is best described as full and rich, with a light carbonation that produces a certain crispness that lingers in the aftertaste...more tongue tingling rather than silky smooth. absolutely no hint of the 7% ABV. highly drinkable, but i was a bit letdown by the overall impression of this abbey dubbel. i'm guessing the bottle was a little past it's prime, although my limited experience with belgians tells me i might have to resample this again. which i will gladly oblige."
"An enjoyable brew, if not quite as enjoyable as a Westvleteren. Nice malt back with the plummy, raisiny taste from the candy sugars. Slight alcohol taste but nothing overpowering. A good version of the style and one I will order again if I see it at a bar. For home consumption, I will buy the Westlveteren over this, but still a good beer."
"Reddish-brown with a foamy white head - your typical dubbel. Sweet a spicy nose. Medium-bodied but with a very sharp carbonation that's slightly distracting and not really pleasant. Only mildly fruity with figs and plums. Mild on the hops. Malt is also present but only in the background. Overall fairly spicy. This is a fairly good dubbel, but not exactly what I was expecting or hoping for."
"Ahh a nice Sunday brunch beverage,pours a nice medium brown with a slight orange tint with a huge rocky head that leaves some incrdible lacingAroma is fruity and slightly smokey.The flavor starts out a little smokey but it semmed to get a little watery in the middle ending with a nice malty,bready flavor lingering.A very nice looking beer and tastes pretty good but would have liked a little more richnes.Still a extremely well made beer."
"Complexfully wonderful and a great sipper. Excellent yeasty surprise; smooth, creamy, tingly, spicey, fruity, nearly everything a good Belgian needs this has."
"Medium brown color, large lacy head. Malty, fruity and spicy. Smooth mellow taste. Lots of flavor, complex and subtle. Hint of apricot, banana, vanilla and other spices and aromas. Mouthfeel is very full and round. Finish is smooth and dry. Aftertaste is slightly bitter. Great beer. My favorite of the red, white and blue."
"Update: In 2004 I havent had an overly foamy sample so I am raising the Mouthfeel rating by 0.5."
"This beer poured a medium tan head with fine sized bubbles. Yes, the nose did remind me of vomit. The body was murky and there was carbonation observed. The hue was that of cider and the lacing was sparse on the sides of my glass. The flavor was spicy and the mouthfeel was smooth and tingly on my tongue."
"Well, this is just a simple, straight, buttery, spicy, fruity, delicious Belgian. It may be my favorite of the three."
"Ripe black cherry flavors feature prominently as it gets warmer. Now, nearly 70 deg. F, and cherry wood-aged Calvados churns beneath a delicious little peppery bite of yeast. Remarkably complex, smooth and drinkable beer. My last sip was at nearly 80 deg. F. Amazing! Creamy, Baileys Ir ish Cream with exotic, expensive spices. What great yeast!"
"Hazy, mashed cherry hue, brown in spots, darkish crimson around the edges thick, frothy, bubbly off-white head eye-candy in a goblet. Excellent head retention. No lace though. Average bouquet, kind of weak, kind of simplistic yeast dominates (not very potent), slight candy-fruit, pepper, slightly horsey apathetic. Empty and hollow palate lackluster in the flavor department, yeasty and spritzy, light clove, peppery, very distant fruit. The alcohol is absent on all accounts. The lack of complexity hampers the enjoyment of drinking it far too clean for a Dubbel. Wheres the malt foundation? The body is thin and watery the finish is curt, distant peppery aftertaste its hard to savor a beer that leaves no mark on your tastebuds. Medium-light body airy mouthfeel. Chimay Red is a major yawner; skip it."
"Maybe I'll get this again, but this so far has been a brewery that I am in no rush to drink from again anytime soon. Not horrible, but not the great beer experience I thought I would get from such a big name in beerdom. Pat"
"A beauty of a deep ruby red in color, medium sized soapy head, decent retention, tiny strings of carbonation noted. Faint aroma of fruit, apples, some sugary notes also. Slightly chewy and some candied flavors noted off the top. The body is of light apple peel, sugary, some light Belgian peppery spices, although tough to detect. Finishes a bit dry. Has subdued characteristics of a Dubbel, just lacks the massive flavors, still highly drinkable for the style."
"Overall Impression: It’s worth investing in some glassware for this. I own a Chimay goblet (called a Gourmet) that I use for heavier beers with the gold leaf rim. It’s about $5 but if you are serious about beer, pony up the dough. This is an outstanding beer. Drinkability? The one hefty sized bottle has me feeling quite friendly, but I’d gladly tackle another if it were offered. This is an abbey beer folks, a little slice of history carefully put in a bottle just for you. As Ben Franklin said, beer is proof there is a God and he wants us to be happy. I think the monks agree."
"Red brown opaque body with rapidly disappearing head. Berry aroma. Very little hops flavor and very easy to drink. medium/light body and amazing easy to drink. Where the other Chimay beers are shooting for finess over intensity, I believe this one achieves it."
"Looking at this beer in my glass reminds me of the Charles River in Boston. From the swampy color to the tan foamy head. Aroma is complex, fruity, malty with a slight floral presence. Crisp and effercescent, yet smooth and medium to full bodied with an ever so slight metallic finish. Very drinkable especially at 55+ degrees. Good sample of a good Belgian Abbaye."
"What is really nice about this beer is how well balanced it is. It's never overpowering or overwhelming, but each flavors has it's own spot and compliments the other flavors. A very nice beer."
"330ml brown bottle, best before date on the back (LOTS of time allotted to consume). Poured it out into a chalice, a very murky deep coppery red, moving well into the brown range, very thick off-white creamy head. This subsides a bit, but sticks around most of the way down the glass, and also leaves a decent lacing. Nose possesses apples, cloves, banana. Taste is spicy, especially cloves, and traces of apple. Mouthfeel is rich, but it goes down a bit acidic. I would imagine this would compliment grilled red meat very nicely (especially game meat), I'm looking forward to trying it out."
"This beer pours a cloudy brown with hints of red around the edges. It has a minimal head and minimal lacing - a very attractive looking beer. The aroma is filled with fruits and malts. The flavor is very enjoyable. It has a lot of fruity flavors and it is fairly sweet and full bodied. The alcohol is vaguely apparent, but just to the point that it adds character to the flavor. I would highly recommend this beer as well as the other Chimay products."
"Brown in color, with a thick, creamy off-white head that lingers, leaving sheets of lacing. Aroma is malty, slightly yeasty, fruity (banana and apple). Malty sweet start, middle is fruity with banana and some apple, and an acidic finish. Body is on the fuller side of medium."
"Incredible smoothness makes this one easy to drink. A first class beer from start to finish."
"Available in bottles at a German bar, Von Trier, in Milwaukee and served in the proper Chimay chalice. Hazy brownish-maroon in color with a creamy, off-white head. Aroma consists of a combination of malt, cloves, dark fruit and a touch of yeast. Mouthfeel is smooth and medium-bodied. Initial medicinal taste startled me a bit, but I soon adjusted. Flavors aren't overly complex, but the taste is extremely enjoyable. Malt, hints of feint chocolate, yeast and a touch of sweetness. The alcohol is masked very well. Impressive."
"Drinkability: a good stand-by to savor every once in a while (Tim Webb's controversial opinion aside). Chimay is a good Belgian beer, but there are many others that are far better."
"It's a light amber color with a huge head of white frothiness. I had a very stuffy nose during this review (damn spring allergies!), so all I got out of the aroma was some yeast and sweetness. The flavors were easy to pick up though....dark fruits start and finish with some yeast character in between.....very enjoyable. I had to pay $8 for a 750mL bottle....pretty steep to me, I'd rather get the Chimay Blue for that matter....it's much more complex and rewarding. But this is a great beer if you're looking for a little less acohol and complexity."
"Drinkable certainly, but like the other Chimays a bit pricey for everyday consumption."
"Pours a slightly hazed raison color with a nice fluffy white head. There is just a hint of sweetness at first but then you notice the fruit and spices as well in the aromas. This smells great! At first taste you sense the hops sliding into the fruit (maybe raison-like) with light spicing and a hint of yeast. This well blended beer is medium to light bodied and finishes with a dry spice finish. It is a very nice beer that would pair well with certain meals. Op uw gezonheid!"
"Pours a gorgeous reddish brown/copper color; relatively opaque, with a light tan head that falls to a very thin collar and remains for the duration. No lacing to speak of on my glass. The nose is potent and wine-like, with musty yeast and nutty malt but mostly fruity--apples, apricots, raisins, plums. As it warms, caramel/burnt sugar notes come forth. On palate, crisp and tart with fruity apple notes but well-balanced with oakey malt sweetness. Higher abv is evident but ultimately a very balanced ale, complex yet subtle. Finish is earthy with a mild hop bitterness and relatively short. Mouthfeel is nice--silky, syrupy, but with cleanness of carbonation. A well-balanced ale and a mild hop crispness deliver a relatively drinkable brew, even with the complexity and higher abv."
"This beer gave me high hopes from the first pour and it did not let down. The color is a deep and hazy red with just a touch of brown with a nice fluffy white head that slowly dissipated to a wonderful lace that remained throughout. The smell was very spicy with a fruit (dominantly apple) background. The spices and malt character blended together with just a touch of yeast and hop flavors to make a wonderfully smooth and tasty beer. I greatly enjoyed this beer and look forward to having it again."
"Apples! That was the first thing that came to mind when I smelled this beer. It tasted fruity and a little tart, which may be why I initially thought ""apple"" instead of any other fruit. Very smooth and easy to drink, given its alcohol content. Medium-sized head that settled rather quickly. Deep red hue. Great beer."
"I enjoyed this one very much, though at 9$ a bottle on my college budget it will have to be for special occasions only."
"A pretty beer when poured in a glass, and the aroma of fruits was a pleasure. The thick head was probably more due to my error in pouring, but still lovely nonetheless. The first sip was fruity and slightly hopped, but very smooth. I was happy the entire glass, except when it was empty. The overall flavor did subside some with each sip as my tongue got desensitized to the bouquet of flavors. I am still working on my ability to properly describe what I am tasting in beer lingo, but this might work too....yummy."
"I haven't had red in quite awhile, and I was suprised as to how mellow this beer is compared to the many stronger styles i've had since. This tastes almost like an English ale (Fuller's?) or a doppelbock(Salvator?) as much it does a Belgian dubble. Nice, winey-like malt smoothness and creaminess, some spice, but not too much. Possibly the least sweet Belgian trappist or abbey I've had. Head disappeared quickly, one of the least impressive appearances i've seen in a Belgian or Belgian-styled beer. Almost no lacing. On the other hand, considering the still-potent ABV, this is a very easy-drinking ale. Nice taste, nothing to put you off. High quality, but real subtle for a trappist."
"a hazy brown colored beer, slight amber in when backlit. small tan head that depleted fast. the aroma was figgy, fruity, and spicy yeast. the taste was much better than the aroma and appearance. it was spicy and hoppy with a soothing malt character. fig or grape fruity taste. it was very light body with a light and very drinkable mouthfeel."
"A fairly drinkable brew, very easy to down a few I am sure"
"The lacing was great, just as I expected and it left some dazzling rings in the glass. Sweet raw honey-like malt aroma and flavour, some herbal medicinal flavour clash with a fresh tasting juicy hops. Ripe tropical fruit is vague but present. A hell of a lot sweet than what I am used in the bottle, I actually prefer the bottle but would certainly order this again."
"Aroma had an original quick shot of raisin like fruitiness, then moved to a strong phenol and cloves nose. Big and full head with a cloudy orange amber color with obvious sediment. Minimal lacing. Ale smoothness, alcohol taste notable. Cloves and phenol again with fruity background. Great long lasting finish of both flavor and dryness. Lower carbonation, which helps the smoothness. Mostly an enjoyable adventure of flavors, but a bit limited. Others have described it well and better than I. My bottle may have been a little old, because it lacked the complexity as I would have liked. Enjoyable nonetheless."
"This is quite a wonderful brew. Pours a cloudy orange/brown color. Has a rich, creamy head, which leaves a lace that clings to the glass for the entire duration. Wonderful malt aromas emerged with a spicy hint of cloves and sweet citrus. The carbonation seemed to dance on my tongue, like that of fine champagne. This brew has an exceptionally well-balanced taste of plums, raisins, and touch of pepper-like spiciness. This is a wonderfully complex, yet balanced beer. Its by far my favorite of the three Chimays."
"This is a very good beer although I put it last among the three Chmays. However, that's definitely not a bad thing because all three are great."
"Well. A another high rated beer, but not for me. It has a bit too high alcohol content for me, and it has an aroma and flavor like all strong belgian ales. The yeast overpowers, as is typical for these belgian types...Don't really care for this one."
"Pours a nice red, almost garnet in color. A thick off white head that wouldnt quit slowly gave way to a thick never-ending lace that was on there until the finish. Mostly malt aroma with hints of plums or raisins mixed with yeast. Nice, very nice. A malt sweetness moves over your tongue with the hints of plum, raisins and yeast. Very smooth and creamy feeling in your mouth. I really enjoyed this beer so dont let the rating fool you. This is my first beer of this style and I like to leave room for adjustments where needed. Looking forward to many more beers of this styleI may need to change my profile!"
"This beer comes across much better in my memory, as it seems much less flavorful and complex as other examples from years past. Is this brew being dumbed down?... Disappointing..."
"1992 version, 75cl bottle, served in nice little Chimay goblets at the Kulminator in Antwerp. This stuff just rocked my world....please if any of you guys get the chance to drink pre 94 Chimay in Belgium....do so!"
"Reviewed side by side by side, 3-98, 6-99, 8-02, all corked and caged. (special thanks to Nero Fiddled). Pours a murky, reddish brown with an absolutely perfect head. You can smell the carbonation in the aroma! Cherry's abound in the first sip, sweet yet somewhat sour. High carbonation, yet creamy in the mouthfeel. Short, dry finish, yet again with a lingering, somewhat tangy edge. Unbelievable. Now, of course the August of 2000 was the freshest, but my personal favorite; the March of 1998. It showed signs of aging, less carbonation, hardly any lasting lace, but the short, tangy, slight sour finish worked for me. Next mission, cellar some blue."
"Wow! Another winner for Chimay! Poured a hazy golden brown with a medium off white foamy head. The smell of fruits and spices were outstanding. The taste of fruit and spices was well balanced and pleasant all around. The sweetness was perfect to set of this near perfect beer. Again, WOW!"
"Being a Belgain weekend, I had to try this beer again. I was a little dissappointed. Not as biting or outstanding as I remembered. A little week, although it did have a good taste to it, I find myself leaning towards the North American Belgians such as Allagash, Unibrue and Ommegang. Still all in all a good beer."
"Nose is plum liqueur soaring over rich crystal maltiness and dark toffee notes. Simply mouth-watering. Palate is largely candi sugar/whisky notes, yet there is a malty weight there keeping it all well-grounded. A previously hidden bitterness emerges to give great length to the finish. A gem."
"Pours a deep reddish brown with a white head. What a smooth beer. I've never tried this beer before, and the bottle I am drinking has been cellared for 6 months. I love it. Not as intense wild yeast flavors that I associate with Belgian's. A very complex beer with nice maltiness and a sweet spicy finish. A very enjoyable & drinkable beer."
"Huge billowy head over a dark brown body, some red tinges at the edges. Friuty nose and taste. Yeasty. You all know the specifics from everybody else's reviews. I wasn't all that impressed, maybe it isn't my thing."
"Light murky brown in color with a beautiful fluffy white head. The taste is creamy and smooth. Hints of spices come through and is a bit peppery. Very effervesant in the mouth. The aftertaste is very warming and smooth. I have been waiting to try the Chimay line for along time and they did not disappoint. Can't wait to sample the white and blue."
"Pours with a nice fluffy head and rich brown/cherry colour. Smell is intensely fruity with cherry, plum, and mild banana. Taste is strong malt, cherries and plum again but without the banana. A touch of caramel as well. Mouthfeel fizzy and sharp. Not as smooth as the rest of the Chimay family. An excellent brew and strong thirst quencher but definantly the worst of the three. Almost like a toned down weizenbock."
"Amber color with lots of bubbles. Thick white fluffy head, slightly sweet nose with a smack of spice (black pepper). Very smooth mouth with a lively (sparkle) finish. Very rounded malt taste with hop bitterness and spice to the finish (dry pepper). Tart plum notes also balence the malt sweetness. A great looking brew. Not as complex as I remembered but very well rounded."
"Taste begins medicinal and hard candy, with banana, berries, malt and yeast. Nicely rich, soft, with a light tingling carbonation and mouthfeel. Finish was very complex, again with the medicinal spice, maybe cinnamon and vanilla. This beer has a lot going on. Very good."
"A deep translucent garnet to brown color on the pour, the head preposterous in size, creamy in texture, light tan in color, with oodles of lace to cling lovingly to the Chimay Chalice. The nose is dominated by the malt, but also a hint of yeast and hops, sweet, and quite sniffable. Start is malt sweet, the top middling in mouth feel, the finish is potently acidic, mercifully hopped, droughty malt aftertaste. My second most favorite Chimay, and as I have stated, if you havent tried a Chimay, youve not lived Baby."
"An amber red-colored brew fills the glass and a very large off-white head forms on top. Stays very well with the help of the Chimay chalice's etched bottom, which creates bubbles that rise to the top, keeping the head perfect. Leaves a few dots of lace as it levels out. Beautiful spicy aroma. Dried plum and raisin dominate, along with a little yeast in the background. Maybe a bit of banana as well. Definitely a ""dubbel aroma"". There's a characteristic in there that I can't quite pinpoint, it's almost like a soft aged cheese aroma. Maybe a little bready. A slight Belgian pepper tingle greets the tongue with the first taste. Clove and a bit of banana follow. Rich yet delicate malt sweetness supports the fruity and spicy products of the yeast. As the liquid travels around your palate, it feels almost thick, like whipped cream. So smooth and creamy! This is just about the smoothest, creamiest beer I've ever tasted... or felt, if you will. A medium to light body, but the complexities and malt make this a pleasure to savor in the way that a more full-bodied beer would be. I can definitely see this one holding the monks over during a fasting. A delight to the senses. Another must-try from Chimay!"
"Dark Brown color, which is actually very attractive if you pay attention to it. Topped with a creamy thick white head. It has a light smell of apricot. Yet another TOP Beer by Belgium (Dubbel Style)"
"Pours a nice deep reddish copper color with a thick and creamy white head.  Aroma is slightly sweet and fruity with hints of apricot and figs.  I also read another reviewer describe this aroma as bread pudding like, which I have to say is right on.  This is a medium-bodied brew with a somewhat complex taste that is a bit fruity and malty with a dash of pepper.  The fine carbonation creates a very nice mouth feel that goes down extremely smoothly.  I could drink several of these.  A very fine beer."
"The least favorite of the 3 Chimays for me, but that said, it is still a highly credible Classic beer."
"Honey-colored with a frothy, rocky cream-colored head--large bubbles. It's unfiltered, and there is some visible particulate matter suspended in the beer, but not so much as to be bothersome. Very natural-looking.  Aroma is of dark fruity maltiness (very ripe apples or apricots?)--smells very sweet. Vigorous carbonation lends a very crisp bite at first. Notes of clove on the tongue. The taste is somewhat less complex than the smell, and it's definitely not as sweet as the aroma leads one to expect--the balance is striking, and it benefits from not being real sweet and syrupy. Certainly a world-class Belgian."
"Pours a cloudy, deep amber color with a generous head and tons of lace. Malt and fruit in the nose along with a spicy, rose-like aroma. Medium body with a creamy and smooth mouthfeel. Flavor is rich in malt and fruity, some yeastiness, and bread-like taste. Finishes with light hops that balance it out.  Slightly dry with a light spiciness. Easy to drink, but slowly enjoy this one. A wonderful Belgian ale"
"This is a great beer! It pours with a small but creamy tan head and is a nice dark reddish/brown.  The aroma is very appealing like calling you to TASTE ME.  And the taste is so smooth, not very hoppy but more on the malty side IMO.  Great tingly moutfeel that stays with you. And contrary to somethings I read as to drink it alone, I had it with a fettucine alfredo and it went great with it. MY WIFE EVEN LIKED IT, and she is a liquor type gal. Try this beer...........CHEERS"
"Small bottle. Age unknown, but prior to the fairly recent packaging change-over; and aging is not really needed with this beer. Cloudy reddish-brown with an orange cast. The light tan head wants to rise out of the glass at first, but eventually subsides to a very creamy 1/8"" head that holds throughout the serving and leaves some nice lace. The aroma is lightly fruity (dark fruits - raisin, plum, fig... and maybe some lighter fruits as well), lightly phenolic (even some minor bubblegum), gently citrusy, somewhat woody, somewhat sweet, softly spicy (clove) and subtly leathery. The body is light/medium but with a very soft, smooth, and creamy palate from a very fine, natural carbonation. The flavor is somewhat rich with a fruity, bready malt flavor, some yeastiness, and some light grassy hops that round and balance. It finishes semi-dry with a light spiciness that lingers. Although it may appear one-sided at first, a closer examination will reveal that there's much more going on. That's what makes this beer work so well - its great balance and finesse. The flavors and aromas don't reach out and grab you individually, but rather act as a whole, which gives it complexity as the varied characteristics are slowly revealed at different times throughout the serving. Highly drinkable, and quite enjoyable."
"Slightly bitter, definitely ""fruity"" tones. A class effort."
"Pour this one slow, there is serious carbonation in the bottle, some yeast stays in the bottle.  Smooth creamy head, deep coppery color, fruity apricot aroma, very easy to drink."
"Very enjoyable and satisfying to the last drop."
"My first corked beer (I know, I know) and my second Belgian Ale. This blew the Witkap Pater out of the water (does that rhyme?) but I still feel it was lacking in some areas. Copper colored with an insanely thick head. Mellow fruit undertones are about all that stood out to me. I am looking forward to trying the Bleu."
"Semi-opaque deep ginger brown, nice bottle-conditioned head that races to 3/4 of an inch in the tulip glass.  Bright aroma, a little citrus and cantelope.  Mouthfeel is light and at the same time a woodsy, leafy, cane sugar malty flavor is pretty evident. There's a lot of yeastiness going on here. Good hop bittering, but at the same time, I was looking for a little more complexity and a little more fruit to the overall impression.  Still, obviously a respectable brew.  The Grande Reserve appeals to me more -- its got added depth of flavors."
"This is decent at best...leaves alot to be desired."
"Pours with an impressive, even head that persists longer than expected.  Effervescence remains in the dark brownish brew, which intrigues with light swirls of foam below the head.  Aromas are smooth, though rather muted until the beer warms a bit.  Taste is exceptionally smooth and well-balanced, neither overwhelmingly sweet nor overwhelmingly bitter.  Deliciously drinkable...a really wonderful beer."
"Big frothy head which quickly died out so much that the beer looked flat. Smells like a Belgian should, which isnt all that pleasant, but it tastes very good. My personal favorite of the Chimays."
"Pours a bit browner than ruby. Nice typical belgian head. Nose has that smell that's the same in the La Trappe beers; it's like the taste of suger in the raw if you took away the sweetness. Maybe it's from the sugar they use to start fermentation. Some very faint citric qualities to the smell with some other vague fruitiness. I'm not sure how many people here have done this or have this weed, but chew on the bottom end of a stalk of Y grass (peel away the secondary leaves and chew on the white bottom). It's a flavor that very similar to one of those in this beer. Flavor it with a little bit of red grapes, minus the sweetness, with the faintest hint of alcohol and you've got the flavor nailed. The mouthfeel is actually fuzzy because of the way the carbonation is."
"Okay, opening this was akin to open a champagne bottle. Lovely amber color with nice white/light tan head. Nice taste to it and a mouthfeel that most macrobrews brag about and don't even come close or actually denegrate. I love it, but I wish it wasn't so expensive."
"Pours a nice shade of burgandy with a bubbly head that retains nicely.  Very sweet candy-like aroma with yeasty tones evident also.  Taste is nice, but nothing really jumps out at me.  Very refiined compared to some of the other Belgians I've had recently (like Scaldis).  Taste consists of a bready yeastiness,  subdued sweet tones of cotton candy,  and slight bitterness.  This is a medium bodied beer.  One of the more easily drinkable Belgians I've had."
"Are you guys kidding?.....some of the reserved reviews of this beer make my blood boil...this is, without question, one of the world's top 10 beers and everything one would expect from a Trappist...big intense aromas, gorgeous head, deep and rich satisfying flavours....if you don't like this one then you should stick to you Coor's Light!"
"137"
"Rougish brown.  Complex aroma, a mix of spices, fruit and caramel malt.  This beer's aroma is worth the price of admission.  Some green apples and band-aid hints."
"This is a smooth-sipping, malty dinner beer. Cloudy and yeasty, with a pleasant vinegar attack; round, cidery, fruity middle; cleansing appetizing finish. The yeast is the highlight and balances the brew perfectly between weighty intensity and frothy lip-smacking refreshment. Drink this beer with food. Namely meat. Rack of lamb would be ideal, but this beer is so good that Boston Chicken would probably do the trick."
"Poured with a large head that quickly dissipates to a nice off-white bead. Nice yeasty/fruity nose.Very effervescent as usual, with a lively, slightly acidic mouthfeel, drying out in the end. I dunno, seems to me that this once had a bit more character in the years past, but still a world classic brew. Glad it's become widely availiable in my area."
"Pours with a small light tan head.  Medium brown color, slightly hazy.  Well carbonated.  Smells lightly roasty, sweet and spicy.  Tastes roasty and nutty, finishes slightly syrupy.  Some fruity yeastiness throughout.  Medium body.  Not quite as good as the white in my opinion."
"This is my first time drinking this out of the 11.2 oz bottle instead of the large bottle.  Dark red color with a slight haze unless you pour out the sediment-- then it gets quite hazy obviously. Great head that retains well. Mild phenolic aroma with a hint of clove followed by caramel malt notes.  Smooth, almost creamy mouthfeel with a medium body.  Very low hop bitterness.  Sweetness dominates at first and is then followed by a tad of caramel malt and complex, peppery Belgian yeasty flavors.  This is much better in the 11.2 oz bottle.  This is easily the most balanced Belgian trappist ale I've had.  Lots of flavors, but it won't kick your ass like the other two Chimays.  I could go for a couple more of these."
"The more subdued of the Chimays, still, fantastic belgian character, warm yeasty and spicy flavour, i've never had a problem with it."
"Exceptional.  Chimay Red was the first Chimay I ever tried.  It is my favorite of the line.  Beautfiul, reddish-copper color, great lacing and a wonderful taste.  This beer gets better as it warms in the glass."
"The body yields a head that is initially large, frothy, off-white, mostly diminishing. The color is  a murky dark amber, dense medium body. The aroma is moderately malt, hoppy, and lightly yeasty. Evident are complex notes of maybe  banana, plum, peach, honey, clove, vanilla, licorice, and cola. Flavor is moderately sweet, lightly acidic, and bitter. Overall a excellent brew."
"Clearly great beer by any standard.  Unique in taste and smell.  Subtle sweetness that evens out into a smooth and rich experience.  Strong yeast presence.  Becomes even better as it warms."
"The first reaction to trying this was...WOW. I didn't even want to share a sip with the wife! So smooth yet very complex. Sweet maltiness, fruit (ripe plum), raisin, subtle chocolate. Full, luscious body."
"Although not as complex as the Grand Reserve or Cing Cents, it's still one of the better and most drinkable beers out of Belgium."
"Very mellow and smooth.  As dubbels go, one of the easier to drink.  A good introductory dubbel for someone looking to try the style."
"I have seen the light! Thank god for these monks.. Smooth, subtle fruit hints, tasty.. what more could you ask for from a beer?"
"Notes: We can die now. It's okay. Drinking this beer has made the cylce of life complete."
