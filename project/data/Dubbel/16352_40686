If it was possible to brew a mountain-style beer without the grain and with a good European influence, it would taste a lot like this. Not anything to rush out and buy but those looking for a "light Dubbel" would be wise to start here. There was enough to like here without an overriding sweetness and this stayed true to form from start to finish. Fun stuff!","JerzDevl2000","Jun 04, 2014"

It pours a clear golden-garnet (there's a combination for ya!) topped by a half-finger of off-cream foam. The nose comprises Belgian candi sugar, light fig, graham cracker, a pinch of clove, and an undercurrent of dark tobacco. The taste does away with the greenery and maintains the rest on cruise control. There's an addition of some extra clove and a hint of banana peel, as well. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a slick feel. Overall, a subpar dubbel, one that lacks a lot of yeasty characteristics I enjoy from the style, and one that just comes across too muddled for its own good.","TMoney2591","0"

Taste is right on for this and I appreciate that they resisted adding too much caramely sweetness that seems to be the achilles heel of american dubbels. However, they obviously do not bottle condition (as evidenced by the lack of yeast sediment). Also, would appreciate more carbonation to be a true dubbel.

It has a light phenolic character and a rich, satisfying mouthfeel that grabs the tongue from start to finish. A very good beer that would be a perfect match with a robust meal of beef or pork.","Seanibus","Mar 09, 2008"
4.03,7.2,4.5,4,4,4,4,"I poured this nice beer into my tumbler at 50 degrees. The beer had a hellacious head that was fluffy and tan. The lacing was really good as was the smell though I could not describe it. The taste was roasted and malty and very nice. I would buy this again for sure.","Minkybut","Mar 01, 2008"

4.05,7.7,4,4,4,4.5,4,"D-Nice representation of style made with a real Trappist yeast strain. A quality American version of this Belgian style.","Deuane","Jan 22, 2008"
3.48,-7.4,4,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"Drinkability is fine for what it is - it's a sipper, but most Dubbels are, and although this one isn't a standout example of the style, it's a good attempt.","CrellMoset","Beers"
3.75,-0.3,4,4,3.5,3.5,4,"D: This is a good effort from this newcomer brewery... perhaps not quite as spectacular as their others, but still a decent abbey-style ale, nonetheless. For its class, it has quite the competition, but it comes out alright. I'm glad I got 6, and look forward to it again on tap, as well.","Proteus93","0"
