"12/21/13 From Bottle. This is more like it. First taste was the sweetness, a nicely done sweetness. Then a raisiny flavor that finishes more like a caramel. All very subtly embodied in a smooth medium mouth feel. This 8.5% ABV beauty is very seductive. Go lightly my friends."

"O: fine but not particularly memorable"
""
""
""
"Pour is reddish brown with a tight, small bubbled tan head. Nose has a fair bit of dark malt, caramel is strong, light licorice, hints of apple and fruity esters. Taste is much of the same, light bitterness and herbal hop in the finish. Licorice mid palate, decent bit of richer malt up front, mostly caramel malts. Strong carbonation, lighter body."
""
"Smell is sweet with some cinnamon and spice to it. The taste is sweet as well but is really dumbed down by the amount of carbonation it has. Very fizzy in the mouth. Not a bad beer to try, but would probably only get it again if the beer store was out of my usual's."

"O: while it's not the greatest dubbel in the land, this brew is more than giving me what I'd ask of a dubbel ... lots of sweet fruitiness, plenty of yeast, a perfectly hidden ABV over 7% and and all-around solid mouthfeel. at $11.04 for this 750 ML bottle, I feel like I got my money's worth, and it's good enough to have me curious about other St. Feuillien offerings."

"O: Tasty, goes down easily, slightly filling, good kick, good representation of style, this is a decent beer to drink for a while if youâ€™re in the mood for the style."

"Poured into a Gulden Draak tulip. Pours a dark chestnut amber with a fine one finger light tan head with excellent retention and lacing. Unusual spicy aroma of bready malt, brown bread, Belgian yeast, clove and an earthy sharp component similar to cinnamon. Flavor is a complex, but well integrated combination of caramel and bready malt, dark dried fruit, brown bread, faint cloves; somewhat earthy. Flavor is subdued but rich. Medium bodied with a hint of creaminess. Very nicely balanced dubbel that seems almost attenuated at first, but offers up quite a variety of flavor as it opens up. Very enjoyable, but not as intense as some other dubbels."

"750 ml bottle into signature chalice, no bottle dating. Cork was a battle to remove on this one. Pours hazy and cloudy dark ruby red color with a 1-2 finger dense and fluffy light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Spotty foamy lacing clings on the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big raisin, apple, caramel, brown sugar, molasses, toffee, toast, fig, brown bread, floral, pepper, light clove, and yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark malt and fruity/spicy ester notes. Taste of raisin, apple, caramel, toast, toffee, brown sugar, molasses, fig, brown bread, floral, pepper, clove, and yeast earthiness. Lingering notes of dark fruit, caramel, toast, toffee, molasses, brown bread, floral, pepper, clove, and earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and complexity of dark malt and fruity notes; with a good sweet/peppery ester balance; and zero cloying flavors present after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a creamy, fairly slick, and lightly prickly mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a very nice Dubbel. Nice balance and complexity of fruity and malt flavors; and very smooth to sip on. A very enjoyable offering."

"Overall: Good brew, I think this is my first from St. Fuellien and beyond tasty enough that it won't be my last. Hope you enjoy as much as i do and will not hesitate to pick up again when I see this at my local beer spot. Salud!"
""
""
"Overall: quite a good brune, but I would still prefer a Kwak on balance. And Kwak is a bit more affordable too."
""
"Deep brown color, some cloudiness and a very thin tan head. Sweet light esters in the nose. Rich malt flavor, but some slight alcohol burn. Some decent bitterness on the back end. There was a little too much carbonation but as the beer sat it seemed to settle down. Full bodied flavor, the beer coats the palate and leaves a lasting flavor. Again, there is some alcohol burn, but it does not take away from the flavor."
""
""
""
"O) A very good example of the Belgian Dubbel."
"Basically a spot on example of the style. Something I really enjoy. Well done and highly recommended."
""
""
""
"Food match: Difficult match as I'm afraid my sample may have been spoiled (will know when I've reviewed the other two St Feuillien brews I have). That being said I normally approach a Dubbel as complimentary of desserts (in this case possibly banoffee pie) or contrasting to a sharp matured cheese."

"An ok dubbel I guess..."
"O: An interesting take on the style. It's not bad, but it doesn't quite work for me. I like my dubbels a little sweeter with more depth of flavor."
""
""
""
"Overall a decent beer although I have to admit that this is not one of my favorite styles. I feel this is a respectable representation, though."
"Overall a very good brune"
""
""
""
"This was only the second time i had tried this beer, but it does not lose any of its flare the second time around. A good buy, highly recommended for any situation."
""
""
"Same bottle but mine says 8.5% and it pours a clear kola beer hue which leaves a frothy two finger head and lacing everywhere,the smell is raisins soaked in brandy,xmas pudding and nutmeg,the mouthfeel is a tad creamy,well carbonated and sweet and has tastes of chocolate coated cherries,raisins,ginger,bananna bread and finished with a sweet belgian yeasty bread flavour and basically like liquid food and after you get past the look of this it really isnt that bad but theres better out there."
"Each element of this beer is interesting and maybe good. The problem is this at best good in places beer doesn't work together. Completely don't recommend this one beyond a 2-4 oz sample (and what beer isn't worth doing that with?)"

"O- Overall a decent dubbel but nothing mind blowing."
"O: Not too complex but a highly enjoyable brew nonetheless."
"As dubbels go, this one ranks among the sweetest I've had. There's enough brown sugar in both the aroma and the taste to satisfy any sugar addict; in fact, one might be able to substitute this for the requisite brown sugar one likes to plop onto one's morning oatmeal (if one were so inclined, of course). Signs of other sweet Things are everywhere, such as sugar and sugar; some mushroom oddness makes a brief appearance but mercifully is pounded back by the sugar. Worth a try for the pretty label and the attractive price but otherwise this is not something to brag about."
"On the lighter side for a dubbel, the ABV is completely concealed. About as sessionable as they come for a Belgian."
"Dark brown. The nose is malty flavor and spices. The palate is heady, offers roasted malt but blackberries and grapes. These flavors are propagated in the palate with light touches of clove. We find the bitterness in the aftertaste. A classic Dubbel but fantasy."
"O - Nice blend of sweet flavors here, a certain complexity about it. Not overwhelming in any way but a solid brune."
"Another nice beer from these guys"
"This is pretty pedestrian for this style, boring, bland kind of simple but doesn't make me desire to drink it."
"This was a solid enough Dubbel I suppose, with a decent complexity and a good drinkibility to it. I just wish that the flavors had a bit more richness to them to help make this a little more memorable. This was a tasty sipper but there are better out there for the style."
"Yeah, decent and balanced palate with good characters. Enjoyable beer."
"D: Feels rather strong for a double but still it is surprisingly drinkable. Complex with a nice sweetness to it. Nice double."
"Overall this was a good beer but not a great one. I paid roughly $4-$6 and do not think that I would spend that much on this again."
"Pours a perfect brown with a slowly dying tan head that left a lace ring around glass. A tart cherry smell, along with possible other dark fruits permeates most in nose as there is a touch of sweet malt. A light-to-medium body with a bready/yeastiness so the beer has a dryish edge. Some minor caramel and something like vanilla gives off a touch of sweetness and there are also some dark fruit flavors. A dry, crisp finish thanks to lively carbonation. I enjoyed this beer but it seems a tad less sweet and fruity for my liking; more of a dry beer."
"In any case, if you like Dubbel's this is a nice one."
"jd"
"D: The beer isn't very difficult to drink because the alcohol is well masked. The beer is best sipped so the alcohol won't quickly catch up to you."
"This is a marvelous Dubble that I have no problem grouping in with Chimay Red and Ommegang Abbey Ale. Paired with a veggie wrap (Roma tomatoes, fresh basil, mozzarella and schrosphire blue cheeses, black olives and pickled black peppercorn), this beer had great interplay with the pepper, blue cheese, and olives. A later snack with sugar cookies bakes with cranberries, raisons, and Macadamia nuts were also a pleasant pairing. But this beer is also a great desert and delicacy all on its own."
"From the 25 fl. oz. corked bottle. Sampled on July 19, 2010. It pours a well-carbonated mahogany brown with ruby red tints and about a half inch of silky tan head that stays around. Not a lot of lacing but it does not matter to me. The aroma emits a fine balance of roasted malts, clove, and sweetness that is not unlike brown sugar. Overall this is a mellow and very drinkable beer in the tradition of Belgian Abbey ales with its malty flavor and noted hop finish. Likeable all around."
"Decent, easy drinking brew. Only negative is the metal finish but overall a nice beer."
"drinkability: a nice dubbel. I would drink again if available"
"D - Heaps of flavour and recommended"
"D: A very drinkable dubbel but not so typical for the style. Has some features that reminds of an old ale with lower ABV. Delicious and similar to Corsendonk Dark Abbey Ale or St. Feuillien's Cuvee de Noel for the sweetness."
"No 8394 on the cork"
"The beer pours a murky dark amber color. The aroma is dark fruit with some caramel and toffee malts. The flavor is dark fruits with a lot of caramel malts. The beer is very dry. Medium mouthfeel and high carbonation."
"In a way, it reminds me of this brewery's tripel, but with a caramelish character. Seems a cross of dubbel and tripel. Anyway, it is a lovely sipper. Malty and spicy with that classic ""Belgian"" flair. Very interesting and enjoyable!"
"D: I started out with this beer way too cold. After giving it some quality time to warm up, I came away quite impressed. The flavor is up there with some of the better dubbels I've had."
"D: Very nice example of the style, worth trying."
"Mouthfeel is very carbonated, very bubbly, although fairly thick."
"Drinkability: Surprisingly good. A fine, enjoyable dubbel that served as a pleasant aperitif at Leon's Full Service in Decatur."
"Very drinkable, soft finish and toffee aftertaste. Barely any bitterness on the back end, but the carbonation holds to the very end."
"Overall, really representative of the style and I can't find anything off about it. Very nice brew, but not the most complex I've had in the style. Definitely worth a try, though."
"Pours a very fizzy off-white head, quickly diminishing. Body is ruby brown in color, very cloudy, can't see through. Very fruity aroma, some dark fruit like plum and fig, and some raisin. Aroma of seedy fruits, like berries. A little effervescence and dustiness. Fruity taste, floral. Light floral aftertaste. Soft carbonated mouthfeel, a little sourness. Letting warm up a bit...More fruit present, thick and creamy mouthfeel. Okay tasting, some spices, but a little bland."
"Overall: Mouthfeel is alright, only decent carbonated and a light-medium in body. Drinkability is amazing, I could easily drink a few bottles of this, I kept sipping this one down and before I realized it I had finished the glass."
"Overall this was a solid beer but it's nothing special. Worth a shot."
"D: not the best dubbel or most complex (or fits the style the best), but a very nice beer, drinkable beer."
"Taste is spicy with light roasted notes. The spices add an almost bitter sensation to the beer. There is a certain roasty taste to this beer that is just balancing between right and too much. Together with the spices, which add a citric, exotic spicy element, this beer is quite drinkable. Mouthfeel is not overly sweet and not too thin."
"D: Not a bad brew, and a wonderful, wafting aroma. I might not be too quick to pick it up a second time, but it's certainly worth the shot and it does have some very pleasing qualities that would have me consider it again."
"D- Not as impressed as I hoped to be. The one note (wet cardboard) that I find in some Belgian, Belgian-style, and French Ales is present in this beer and basically ruins it for me."
"Had this on tap at the Brick Store Pub. Poured a hazy brown with a very nice head that eventually fades to a thin cap and leaves some very nice lacing. Classic dubbel look. Smells fresh and minerally. Lots of coriander and banana and some light malt in the nose. The taste is similar. Rich malt with a clean minerality and slightly herbal. Fairly good body, but fairly light overall and quite smooth. Easy drinking and delicious, much better on tap in my opinion."
"a great brown beer... abbey style, like what was really appreciate in belgium in the early 80's, good alcool taste, nicely bitter, toffee taste, nice brown color, it's just a great beer as it's really drinkable... congratulation to the brewers, it's a perl..."
"Date on the bottle is 15/12/08. Just past the freshness date. Pours and opaque brown with a large tan head that recedes slowly to a thin cap. Moderate amount of sticky lacing is left on the glass. Rich aroma of dates, figs, cherries, and candied sugar. Also get just a hint of alcohol. Dark fruit also plays a major role in the flavor. Hints of cherries. Alcohol cleans the palate on the finish. Just a little warming from the alcohol. Medium body but a touch overcarbonated. A little harshness on the tongue. I am not big into Dubbels and Quads but I liked this one. Easy drinking with the alcohol well hiddened."
"Drinkability: It has actually been a while since I have had a Belgian and this beer helps me remember why I like them so much. Complex yet easy drinking. Bold and flavorful yet thirst quenching. A winter sipping drink that also does well in the hot summer."
"Overall, a very nice beer."
"D- This was a pretty easy drinking dubbel. I can imagine this best fresh."
"The appearance of this beer was a very dark brown, as is the case with most bruns and dubbels. It was served in a tulip glass so the head was a pretty generous, off-white, long lasting layer of froth. The smell was bready, dry, a little boozy yet not too much so. I really enjoyed the taste it had the richness and depth of a dubbel, but lacked that malty sweetness which I sometimes dislike; making it more drinkable in my opinion. The mouthfeel was excellent; pretty heavy with an ample amount of carbonation."
"This beer pours a clear amber color. The head is large, rocky, and recedes very slowly into thick lacing which lasts until the beer is gone. The aroma is of caramel, cloves, ginger, and anise. The taste is like the aroma with the addition of some nice butterscotch notes in the finish. The mouthfeel is medium-full bodied with a velvety texture and lively carbonation. Overall, this is a nice Belgian ale."
"pours up a murky brown and dark cherry blend color with a nice big bubbly yellow tinted head. the nose is sweet malts, roasted malts, dark fruits, subtle sour notes. taste of nice dark malts, sweet maltyness, notes of chocolate, dark fruits, maybe some strawberries, or black cherries. full bodied, big spritzy carbo, dry finish. good brew."
"My wife and I went to our neighbor's house for dinner. My neighbor, who knows absolutely nothing about beer, bought this beer for me because he thought I might like it. I think he made a great choice. The beer was a light brown color with a thick tan head that was pretty sticky. It had a fruity aroma with a little bit of caramel. Taste was also sweet and fruity, yeasty. Nicely carbonated. I wish my neighbor had bought two of these."
"Drinkability - This is light and delightful for a Belgian but full of flavor, instant favorite here."
"St. Feuillien Brune pours a reddish brown with a thick tan head from a brown 750 ml corked and caged bottle. The aroma at first is musty. This doesn't last, malty aromas dominate as the beer warms. The flavor improves as well as the beer warms, it's dominated by malt, the hops aren't especially noticeable but do a nice job of balancing this beer. Definitely worth a try."
"An intriguing dubbel."
"Hazy brown with a light tan. The aroma and flavor are rich with dark fruits. This immediately reminds me of fruit leather, grape and cherry, with raisins too. There's subtle spice with vanilla and cinnamon in the background, but there's mostly a wonderful fruit taste with a hint of caramel and toffee. It's a little on the heavy side, so keep this for dessert, a great beer overall."
"Had this one at Belgo Centraal in London. It is clear ruby red/brown, with no real head. The smell reminds me of leather, flowers, nutmeg, and various spices. Very appetizing. The taste is dry, floral, sharp and oaky. The mouthfeel is downright watery. The drinkability is fine but nothing to get excited about. It's balanced, refreshing but not fantastic. Not a bad one but not a great one."
"I had this from a bottle at d.b.a. In New Orleans."
"A good Dubbel, but there are better ones out there..."
"Very well composed."
"Not a favorite dubbel. I would not make any plans to try again, just a bit boring."
"11.2 oz. stubby Belgian bottle served in its own balloon glass. The beer is dark crimson with some yeasty floaties, topped with yellowed-parchment-colored head that begins loose, but the explosive carbonation coming from the etched bottom of the glass quickly replenishes the head with a layer of fine bubbles. The aroma is sweet, fruity and yeasty, and the flavor adds to this a big malty kick of caramel and molasses, biscuity malts, apples, melons, and perhaps some phenols on top of a smooth, medium to full body that imparts a medium finish. Overall a tasty, flavorful dubbel that makes for a good introduction to St. Feuillien."
"Overall - A good, if pretty standard, example of a Belgian Dubbel... definitely worth a try though..."
"Drinkability : Bonne biÃ¨re mi-douce Ã©quilibrÃ©e."
"This was pretty average all the way around, but still a good Dubbel. It poured a dingy looking brownish-red colour with a sand coloured foamy head that didn't seem to last very long. To my displeasure, I didn't see any debris or ""floaties"" of any sort in this one. I really like that in a Belgian and it was abscent here. Smell was quite everage with plenty of dark fruit and toasted grains. Taste was nice with dark fruit profiles, toasted grains, and a lack of that metallic taste that seems to be so prevalent in Belgian styles. The alcohol, while detectable, was very in-offensive and mild. This was pretty smooth and very easy to drink, especially considering the style. I have had better as far as this style goes, but I have had much worse, too. Pleasant."
"($8.99 / 750ml / 25.35 oz. tall straight brown wine-like bottle corked and bound with a wire strap fastener)"
" Not much here to revisit."
"Edit: second bottle worse than the first. Tannin grape flavor is present and the smell is worse."
"Corked and caged brune with the wonderful painting-quality scene on the label of what is presumed to be medieval Le Roeulx. Appearance when poured from the 750 into my deep Duvel tulip glass includes a bubbly head with decidely no lace. The color is a clear hazelnut brown with ample carbonation. The aroma is at once faint... a sure sign of dissapointment for me since I expect a noseful with any solid strong brown. Then, nut and coffee nuttiness with faint candied sugar notes. You really have to swirl this stuff to whip up the aromatic signature or what there is of it. The taste is nutty with hints of candied sugar. Mild again, however, the taste becomes more pronounced as the liquid warms. Mouthfeel comes through with a swirl or two and presents a pleasant coating for the tongue. It's a drinkable but somewhat unremarkable dubbel. I much prefer something that's not so understated. Still, if your options are few, worth the investment."
"Bottle: Poured a clear dark brown color ale with a huge foamy off-white head with great retention and good lacing. Aroma of candi sugar with great Belgian malt is very enticing. Taste is a great mix between some candi sugar, Belgian malt and bready yeast. Body is quite full with no alcohol being discernable. Creamy texture is also quite enjoyable. Overall, this was a well done abbey dubbel with great drinkability characteristics."
"This little brown lighter bodied than equivalent strongbrowns, but also had a much cleaner finish. Carbonation was at hand the whole time, which was a great pleasure. Booze isn't too well hidden, but isn't really that strong to begin with. A great, cheap brown."
"This brew snap, crackle, popped its way onto a short list of sessionable dubbels, but no reason to make it a special occasion. Drinkability would have been higher but the warming alcohol at nearly 8% becomes a little much."
"Pours a clear deep dark mahogony with a giant tan foamy head. The head lasts and leaves great lacing. The smell has a large amount of a ""bisquity"" aroma along with alcohol and little else. The taste is crisp with hop bitterness and a dark fruit aftertaste. Raisins,prunes, carmel, abit of alcohol, and sweet malt make up the backbone of this beer. The m/f is light with the flavors mixing OK making this an OK beer. For a dubbel,and for my taste, this beer is alittle too fruity."
"Served in a St. Feuillien chalice, the beer pours a brown/ruby red color with a good sized tan head. It smells like dark fruit (plums, raisins), caramel and a bit of chocolate. It tastes like dark fruit and caramel, and there's also a bit of a tart/sour hoppy grapefruit finish. Body is medium, but the mouthfeel is very carbonated. Luckily it doesn't affect the drinkability too much, even though it could be better. Overall I think it's a decent beer, but not a great one either. I'd like to try this again some other time."
"a good abbey dubbel"
"Poured out of a corked 750 ml bottle. The color is a dark brown with an average tan head that left very little lacing. The aroma is a bit musty, dark fruit, not very strong. The flavor is of dark fruit, carob, a bit of hop at the end with a slight metallic taste. This ale is a bit fizzy with a moderate body. Overall a good Dubbel not too sweet which makes it quite drinkable."
"D: I'd love to try this one on draft. It was a pleasure to drink the bottled version of this and I bet the draft version could only be better. I've had better Dubbels and I've had worse. This one is well worth trying as it has a lot to offer. Very nice!"
"Pours a hazy deep reddish-brown with a modest tan head that dissipates quickly. Smell is of fruit and malt with some toffee notes. taste is complex with various hints of malt, hops and fruit crosing the palate at times. Medium-bodied and quite drinkable."
"I refilled a few times on this one. Nice and enjoyable."
"No matter what I said this is a drinkable and tasty beer. While there are other Dubbels that are Â“betterÂ” there really isnÂ’t anything wrong with this one. I think my bottle is a few yearÂ’s old. IÂ’m not sure. Maybe it doesnÂ’t age well. I purchased my 750ml bottle in Des Moines, IA. I will drink this again. Worth a try."
"Decent beer overall, but I've definitely had better brunes. I'd buy it again, but only if all of the other brunes were unavailable."
"Dark red/brwon color with a white head that left a solid lacing. Strong smell of nuts, grapes, and cherry. Taste is of nuts, dark fruit, and toffee. A little different, but not bad. Plenty of carbonation and full bodied. Decent, didn't have trouble finishing the glass, but there are other examples I'd probably rather have. Worth a try."
"This beer pours a gorgeous pillowy head that falls into a little head with a lacing that's stuck to the glass. Color is dark and clear amber when held up to the light. The smell is very hoppy and strong with very flowery hops. It has a slight sugar candy smell to it, and it also has a nutty flavor to it. Taste is fairly hoppy with many flavors, like a big nutty flavor. It has a slight scent of banana for a flavor, but that is overpowered by so many other flavors."
"Golden brown color..too oily to leave much for lacing. The aroma is heavy Belgian yeast & spices...which carries over well into the taste. This one has a big malt presence, and the spices compliment that pretty well. While this is not one of those ""knock-your-socks-off"" Belgians, it's a decent representation of the style. I'd like to try this on-tap, as bottles from Belgium seem to be kinda hit-or-miss. A better than average Dubbel, but I wouldn't go out of my way to seek out a bottle."
"All in all this is a pretty tasty beer, I could wish for a bit more complexity, but it certainly is right about where I was expecting it to be. This is a nice beer, and I am quite happy to be working my way through a 750ml bottle this evening."
"750 ml bottle purchased at Total Wine."
"Pours a deep amber with a fluffy 2 finger off-white head that settles into a creamy mass not leaving much lace behind,heavy spice and yeast in the aromas,some clove and cinnamon mainly with a touch of smoke.I may have poured a little to chilledso it took sometime for the flavors to start really showing thru but they eventually did nice vanilla pod and clove flavors over top of dark fruit and light smoke.A nice dubbel here dont drink to chilled and the flavors will come out nicely,quite warming."
"the cost of this far outweighed the taste. it cost me about $8 for a single bottle! now, i have no problem paying a fairly large amount of money for a bottle of beer, but usually expensive beers actually taste good."
"Smooth and creamy mouthfeel and easy to enjoy. CanÂ’t believe that there are only two reviews for this brew. But I suggest if you see it grab it and give it a try. It is worth it. Now, if I can figure out how to get a good shot of the bottle for BAÂ…."
"medium bodied, lightly nutty, malty finish, but the fizz is too harsh for my taste, and spoils the flavor, make the body feel thinner than it should be...have to admit it, I'm not crazy about this one, and still have most of a 750 ml bottle to go. won't be trying this one again, although my opinion of their other beers still stand."
"Nice dubbel, went well with the pizza i was enjoying."
"330 ml bottle, bought at Borough Market, London. Chestnut colour, large head. Vinous aroma, claret, caramel, spices. Malty aroma where the sweetness is well balanced with decent hops. Elements of caramel, liquorice, dark chocolates and some spices. Nice warming mouthfeel. Definitely a beer IÂ’ll buy again when I can find it."
"Thanks to Doug Shoemaker for the thoughtfulness, saving a bottle at Smokeless Joe's. Licorice in aroma of yeast along with fruit, and licorice in taste. Lace in brown appearance crowns it nicely. Malty. Tart aftertaste following hops. Medium mouthfeel."
"Drinkability Â– This is a heavy example of the style and very tasty and sure to satisfy the yeast-heads of the world."
"Approximately 5 yr old 750mL. Good looking dark copper pour. Head is small, of-white, gentle. Complex aroma has mellowed to a charming and balanced scotch ale like expressive malt fest. Old burnt cookies soaked into a butterscotch purÃ©e. Floral and brown sugar suggestions in there too. ThereÂ’s still a faint trace of the hops which lent it a slight bitter finish that kept it from being overly sweet. Mild smokiness comes out through ashes and tobacco flavors. Almost earth malt notes are quickly followed by a slight watery edge just before the spicy fennel reminiscent bitterness kicks in. Yep, reminds me of a scotch ale. As far as that light watery escape toward the finish, I assume itÂ’s a function of the age. While the body was smooth and moderately rounded, I expected more carbonation."
"Like a candied fruitÂ…bubbles dance on the tongue. Alcohol is nicely masked and well balanced. Excellent value for the quality ($5.99 for the 750mL bottle)"
"750, poured at the Delirium Cafe in Brussels. This is a lovely looking Brune, with a dark brown body and a nice tan head that lasts, and lasts, and lasts...Aromas are strange. Very malty, roasty, and yeasty, with some sugar and MINT in there as well. The taste is also reminiscent of a well crafted brune, but the chocolatey mint-like flavor really got to me after a while. The mouthfeel is nice and medium bodied and the drinkability is OK."
"Well-charged, a big yellow two inch head in a Duvel glass. Dark chestnut color, only slightly sedimented. Thick spongey lace. Muted aroma, lightly leaf-like with some musk. Light bodied and highly carbonated for a Dubbel. Flavor is tinged with a bare chocolate, lots of grape, and bittered with an initial light coffee and maybe even molasses sense. Overall, this one had a bit of trouble generating a lot of flavor for me, finishing like it starts with a touch of a phenolic sense and never really spreading out in malt profile. A little bit of alcoholic heat. Not really one of my favorites per style, more of a niche player to my tastes."
"Served way too cold, had to let it warm up a bit to taste anything. Nice flavour- caramel, spice, citrus. Rich, yet nice, soft mouthfeel, a touch sticky, but nothing to really complain about, some sweetness at the start, but in no way cloying. Well rounded and feels like its well made, nice brune."
"The dark fruits really come out in the flavor, as do chocolate, spice, and just a wee bit of alcohol. The alcohol is also present in the warming finish. Bubbly carbonated mouthfeel leads to a dry finish. Malty, very chocolatey aftertaste. This is quite good. Quite, quite good. Deliciously complex and highly drinkable."
"Hazy reddish-brown body capped by a frothy, light tan head that drops but leaves a good collar and surface covering. The aroma is fruity, caramelish, and lightly chocolatey with a gentle background spiciness. The body is medium with a very fine, gently effervescent carbonation that caresses the tongue. The flavor starts malty and lightly earthy with notes of light chocolate and toffee, then expresses notes of dark fruit (raisins, prunes) as it crosses the palate, and ends with another note of creamy chocolate. The finish is exceptional; long and dryish with a wide range of flavors that alternate throughout the glass, sometimes chocolatey, sometimes fruity, and always with some light spiciness and mild lingering malt. It's sweet but backed by enough hop bitterness to keep it from becoming cloying. Really nicely done, and highly recommended."
