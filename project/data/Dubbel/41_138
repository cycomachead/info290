The beer itself is a dark brown with some dark purple notes and is opaque. The beer smell has strong sugar and dark fruit notes. The hop notes are also strong. The hops are closer to an orange smell. The Belgian sugar smell mixes very well with the dark fruits and create a very sweet note. The taste is somewhat similar to the smell. The beer still retain the sugar/dark fruit/orange hop taste but the hops are a bit bitter and the sugary combo give it a slightly artificial taste. However, the taste is still fairly good. The mouthfeel is heavy bodied but on the lighter side. The biting carbonation give the beer a bit of texture in an otherwise smooth mouthfeel.

This is a fantastic beer and its dryness would lend it to accompany almost any type of food you can think up. It is also fabulous for sessions and has no hint of: a.) alcohol or b.) ""wet dog," both of which have the tendency to pop up in some dubbels.

It was given to me by a friend with far to much beer in his basement who had it given to him as a gift so I am not sure when it was bottled... The appearance is beautiful with a thick soft head and a rich dark, copper-brown colored body. Taste has a hint of sour to it (could be the age?) and the mouthfeel was silky smooth.

Didn't really get the warming effect from this and I couldn't tell that there was alcohol in this until I got down to the end. While there wasn't much to swirl out of the bottom of the bottle nor the dark fruit flavors that I had expected from this, this was a great take on the style that would also serve as a good introduction for those unaccustomed to Dubbels.

Pours crystal clear very dark reddish brown color wit ha 1-2 finger foamy light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty foamy lacing clings on the glass, with plenty of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of big raisin, pear, apple, fig, brown sugar, molasses, toast, floral, pepper, light clove, and yeast earthiness. Damn nice balance and complexity of dark malt and yeast ester notes. Taste of raisin, pear, apple, date, brown sugar, molasses, caramel, light chocolate, toast, brown bread, pepper, light clove, floral, and earthy yeast spiciness. Lingering notes of dark and light fruits, light chocolate, brown sugar, molasses, caramel, toast, brown bread, pepper, light clove, and earthy yeast spiciness on the finish for a good bit. Fantastic balance and complexity of malty flavors with fruity/spicy esters; and zero cloying flavors present after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a fairly slick, earthy, and lightly prickly mouthfeel that is very nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a fantastic Belgian Dubbel style! Great balance and complexity of malt and fruity.spicy ester flavors; and extremely smooth to sip on. A highly enjoyable offering.","superspak","Mar 03, 2013"

Maintained phenomenal lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, bread, dark fruit, fruit, earth, and spice. The flavor was of sweet malt, fruit, bread, butter, earth, spice, and subtle alcohol. It had a light feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this was a fairly decent brew. The aroma was pretty weak on this one if I am honest as I really had to work to get anything off of it. Almost to the point of having to put my nose physically in the beer. This was a little upsetting when I went to investigate it at first. The rest of the brew wasn’t too bad though with a good bit of complexity going on. The buttery aspect was interesting to say the least, but seemed to fit in well with everything else going on. Glad I got to try this one and I suggest you do the same at least once if you get the chance.","thagr81us","Oct 22, 2012"

Flavors are darkly sweet, with a brown sugar and dark roasted caramel sweetness, as well as some nutty and old world fruit sweetness. Dates and figs layer throughout the flavors.

Pours a dark brown with a massive head. Carbonation all through the beer. Awesome look. The nose is light, almost not there until I take a bigger draw...and there it is, the superlative aged hops. Wild method at its best in Belgium--why not add 6 times the hops but age them until the bitterness is mostly gone? Well, it works quite well in this case. Incredibly smooth on the tongue, with many layers of malt that emerge as it is consumed. An amazing beer, one of the finest dubbels I've ever had, certainly.

The alcohol makes itself a bit noticeable, even though not being a very high ABV beer. Very tasty nonetheless. Mouthfeel is EXTREMELY carbonated. Maybe a little too carbonated.

Good carbonation for a cellared beer. Smelled reminded me a bit of chocolate, dairy, and freshly baked pastry. Taste was very agreeable. Some cocoa, hint of raisins and bananas.

There is a decent amount of malty (somewhat caramel) sweetness, a touch of fruity esters (raisins), some light phenols and a bit of soft, almost rose-like alcohol. Taste is pretty good, the flavors here are a bit more robust with a moderate malty sweetness and a bit stronger dark fruit ester profile (namely raisins) and a low and short lived bitterness. Mouthfeel is pretty goo with a medium+ body, moderate+ carbonation and a bit of alcohol warmth. Drinkability is pretty good. This brew becomes infinitely more complex as it warms. It is fairly interesting with a good complexity.

Taste is good but not at all complex, which is what I come to expect from a good Belgian dubbel. Nice hops level, with subtle maple, pepper and citrus taste.

Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's coating but also starts off with too much carbonation. The carbonation does gets softer as the beer warms and settles.

After this beer warmed up a thick aroma became present. Very earthy tones are present, the aroma is malty and slightly sweet and nutty. The longer I let this one sit the more intense the aroma becomes it is similar to the previous Belgium styles I have had and really wonderful. Robust flavor that is exceptionally crafted. Very malty indeed with some subtle roasted qualities. The flavor doesn't sway much from the nice aroma although it does seem to be a tad more mellow.

The taste is a touch of roasted malt, carob, sweet grapes, has kind of a metallic twang. Has a similar feel to champagne, tightly carbonated and crisp, though not a dry.

4,-0.2,4,4,4,4,4,"Ah, Corsendonk. What happened during this tasting left me feeling ambivelent about this beer which is dissapointing, given that it was the first Belgian I ever tasted and responsible for triggering my current interest in the style in the first place. This bottled version of the strong brown ale paled in comparrison to its kegged bretheron which for the longest time was available at Willimantic Brewing Company. They even served it in proper glassware. Anyway, I poured this into my Duvel tuplip glass last night. The chestnut brown appearance and puffy, pillowy head peaked my interest. The head didn't last for long, but lace did web the glass during most of the tasting. The aroma was milder than I expected. Candied sugar was hidden but noticeable along with background notes of cinammon and ripe fruit such as dates and prunes. Mild alcohol was noted as well. The taste was slightly carbonated. The alcohol still barely noticeable. More evidence of cinammon and smokier in flavor than I remeber. In fact, never before had I tasted smokey anything in this brew. Not sure if this was older than what I've had in the past? No real candied sugar and I know that's part of the tapped version. The mouthfeel was slightly bready but mild with an almost hoppy yet only slightly so bitterness. Yes, this is a drinkable brew, but it was more carbonated than I'm accustomed to and not as smooth. Yes, it's enjoyable but frankly there is so much better out there in bottles that I won't go out of my way to purchase another anytime soon.","jim102864","Apr 08, 2007"

The head is magnificent though: darkish cream colour, exceptionally rich and fine. Lacing is thick and and pasty. The beer is a dense auburn colour or rich chestnut brown, rosewood. The head is actually a bit of a chameleon, assuming all sorts of different shapes and sizes; sometimes coffee-brown, sometimes ivory coloured. The aroma reminds me of some dunkelweizens, with a sweetish roasted maltiness and yeast smell. Table cream and little hints of milk chocolate along with grapejuice, black cherry, raisins and plums. A little pepper and spices, but not much. Creamy sweet malt with brown sugar and perhaps a little maple syrup. The aroma is not as complex as the Agnus, but sweeter and very mouth-watering. The taste lets you know that this is a Belgian dubbel though with the immediate yeasty qualities and warming alcohol. The malt is the focus of this beer though, and it is well done, giving grainy toasted bread and sweetish chocolate cake. The finish is exceptional, leaving almost a banana bread aftertaste, and a hint of metal. Brown sugar and rasins mix with a burnt toffee flavour. The yeast and alcohol are only the background for the malt, and the hops only felt intermittently in the finish. Again, like the Agnus, the taste is not quite as good as the nose. Medium bodied and relatively low in carbonation. The 7.5% notwithstanding, this goes down almost too easily; it is not as mouth-filling as I expected. Definitely something I would buy regularly, though it is not overly complex.","Cwrw","Jul 05, 2005"

Had a sweet taste that followed through but thought it lacked any complexity beyond the sweetness and smokiness, although the balance between both was good.

The head settled quickly back into the beer and left a light delicate lace on the side of the glass. The aroma has a great spicy character. Nutmeg, allspice backed by hints of bread dough. There is fruit their too. I catch some dates, but also a citrus character. The first taste brings the spice to the front. The flavor literally tickles your tongue. The doughy character is backed by a tartness. Kriek, possibly cranberries come out in this stage of the flavor. Citrus there too, I want to say orange rather than grapefruit you detect in some beer.

It was a cloudy brown color with a off white/tan head. The head was awesome! Some of the best head I've gotten on a beer. It started out very big, probably around 3 inches, then it ""calmed"" down to a fluffy/pillowy head. After that went down, it subsided to a pretty thick film-like head, ala Guinness. The smell was magnificent. Had elements of dark chocolate, dark fruits, a little bit of cinnamon, and a little bit of alcohol. The taste was truely amazing as well. I can honestly say that they couldn't make it any better. It was similar to the smell, but more in the area of the fruits and chocolates than anything else. The alcohol was ""hidden"" very well in the taste as well. Drinkability could have been a 5, but with a beer like this, you have to start getting full at some point, and it was a little bit rich. Although, I don't think I would change the body of this beer to make it too much drinkable. Highly reccommend this one to anyone who likes good beer. If you like bad beer, drink it anyways, it'll turn you into a good beer drinker.","JISurfer","Dec 28, 2004"

Easy drinking, alcohol well hidden.","baiser","Dec 27, 2004"

The ample carbonation keeps a light tan colored head afloat atop the beer. The aroma is bready and sweet, with notes of caramel, plums, and raisin. The taste is a mixture of sweet and tart (though not in the sense of a sour ale) and highly carbonated. The finish is rich and malty with lingering notes of sherry, and caramel. There is a bit of funky Belgian character here, it contributes a rich fruitiness (plum, fig, and raisin), a light spicy character, as well as a light musty type character, that may be more a function of age. This is certainly and enjoyable beer, it is perhaps a little soft and fruity, but not so much that it detracts. I definitely recommend trying this beer.","Gueuzedude","Oct 11, 2004"

The taste adds to the great sweetness of cooked in dough apples a chocolaty deepness with notes of toast, of wood and of citrus. Some lemony seltzer water notes have fun biting the tongue while the body itself is full and enjoyably round. A grassy and citric hoppiness adds to the complexity of the brew. The mouthfeel is very pleasing too, very smooth, just creamy enough to be perfectly smooth and drinkable.

The smell is very close to cranberry juice. Yes, I said cranberry juice. Maybe a tiny bit of malt, perhaps a few other things are very slightly noticeable. Overall, however, this stuff smells to me, alot like cranberry juice. Very intersting. The taste is a bit dry; a bit woody; very satisfying (I seem to think so, anyway).

Also a bit of a chewy sweetness with chocolate and slight coffee notes as well as sour yeastiness. The mouthfeel was crisp yet full bodied, a lot of layers of flavor.

Taste is complex, with plenty of dark fruits like plums, figs, and raisins, cloves, coriander, biscuity malt, musty yeast, and some bitter hops.

When the head retreated, it left a nice think, foamy lace. The nose was of malt with the scent of alcohol being evident. Some citrus and yeast notes were also apparent in the aroma. The strong carbonation was the first thing to hit the tongue, and there was a slight warming sensation from the alcohol, but it wasnt overbearing. Flavors were of sweet fruity malts and yeast with some citrusy notes. As the beer warmed, it became more think and bready. Some spices were also noticeable on the tongue. Not much hops to this beer, but there was a slight bitterness towards the end that was just right to balance out the sweetness.

3.78,-5.7,4,3.5,4,4,3.5," You start off with some tingly carbonation. Sweet malts jump in . Grains fill the backround, and the yeasty flavor kicks in later. There is no real bitterness, but earthy notes add complexity. Roasty and chocolate malts come in the finish and continue to hit the mouth in the aftertaste. A nice smooth full-bodied brew.","ElGuapo","Aug 14, 2003"

I liked this beer much more than I expected I would.","clvand0","Aug 12, 2003"
3.01,-24.9,4,3,3,3.5,2.5,"Flavor is mainly belgian sweetness. A touch roasty and cocoa-like, with lots of fruity flavors, including plum, raisin, and sweet pineapple. Sort of syrupy in mouthfeel. Full bodied and nicely carbonated, but sort of dull. It's got all the belgian flavors you come to expect, but I just didn't really get a kick out of it. I had to try to finish the snifter on the last 1/4 glass. i was trying to make tasting notes, and nothing was standing out, beyond the belgian candi sweetness and esters I guess I'm just not into belgian style beers, particularly this one.","UnionMade","Aug 03, 2003"

Quite sweet with various malts. Lots of plums, raisins and other fruit in it. Tarty apples are apparent. A slight alcohol comes in the middle providing me with a comfortable warming sensation. The Belgian yeast is noticeable throughout and really makes for an interesting, if not great, mouthfeel. This is my comfort beer.","granger10","Jul 23, 2003"

The smell was not very complex, which surprised me a little. Some indistinct malts and an overall yeasty/wheat aroma but nothing to write home about. The taste was sweet, but heavy with notes of rasberry and cherry witha chalky mouthfeel. Even though this did not get an extremely high rating I liked it a lot and will always be up for a pint. Not too expensive, even for pub standards.","GreatPondBrewer","May 28, 2003"
3.48,-13.2,4,3.5,3.5,4,3,"A very good looking brew that pours out a brownish amber color with a very robust head. The head is a bit lasting and laces very well. The nose gives off fruit and dried fruit aromas. This beer is really in the taste as it starts out with a heavy clovish sense and modulates into a more enjoyable spiced fruit flavor. There appear to be a number of flavors competing for dominance here. The feel is very heavy and has real bite to it. This is more a sipping than a gulping beer.","AtLagerHeads","May 23, 2003"

4.03,0.5,4.5,4,4,4,4,"Super appearance. Bown with a reddish glow to it, and a potentially masive off-white head that has little lacing effect. An extremely fruity beer, apple cider and some grape-like flavors to name the most dominant. This ale is sweet, with some alcohol spice to balance, but not much more than feint hops action. Highly carbonated and sweet mouthfeel.","philipt","May 12, 2003"

3.91,-2.5,4.5,3.5,4,4,4,"One of the nicest colors in a beer...fun to examine. Sort of a cloudy root beer/plum/teak with a nice off-white head which fades, but remains as a thin cover then reveals a runny lace. Fun to examine! The aroma is complex with a yeasty clove dominating and citrus, herbal malt and alcoholic fragrances coming into play. Medium bodied with a slightly oily feel and citrus bitterness is noticeable. Wood-pressed apple cider comes to mind.","BeerResearcher","Apr 13, 2003"

Prost!","goindownsouth","Mar 30, 2003"
4.28,6.7,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4,"Typically Belgian foamy head, hissing and fizzy and hard to contain. Aroma is spicy and peppery, and the color is mahogany brown. The head is very resilient, taste (like the aroma) is spicy and peppery, with an echo of malt. Interesting mix of sweetness and spice.

It took what seemed like an eternity for it to die down, leaving a nice 1/2-inch head. Moderate lace was left on the sides. Aromas of raisins, cherries, plums, and malts with hints of chocolate emerged from underneath the foam. The taste matched the aromas quite well, leaving a clean, dry finish. All of the flavors were exceptionally balance with minimal bitterness. I, definitely, cant wait to try this one again.","Scooter77","Mar 21, 2003"

4.12,2.7,3.5,4,4.5,3.5,4,"Hazy brown with a coarse, tan head. Smells like sour green apples and white raisins baked in butter and spiced with cinnamon. The taste is along the same likes with additional flavors of yeast and, toasted grains. The carbonation was a bit too prickly for me, but Ill live. Somehow a clean, acidic bite was able to cut through the brew without being out of place or inappropriate. Tasty beer that I always enjoy enjoy going back to every now and again.","yen157","Feb 24, 2003"

4.2,4.7,4,4,4.5,4,4,"12oz bottle. This one isn't too expensive for a Belgian bottle. It was $6.50 at Eulogy. This one was very nice after two Lindemans Framboises and exactly what I wanted. I would say it is true to the Belgian Brown Ale style, very similar to Kwak, the end tastes especially. Like Kwak, the carbination, which starts off mild and kicks in late, is very strange to my American taste buds. I like strange. This is definitely a keeper.","Scoats","Feb 16, 2003"
4.5,12.2,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Says is best enjoyd before 5 -12-02 n the label, from a 12oz. non-corked bottle. It pours with a hazy deep reddish brown with a pink toned creamy head. The aroma is still delivers a smokey great nose of apple, fig, raisins, and possibly other fruits. Very sweet in the aroma not a lot of hop character there. The taste is a little stale, and I am going to get another bottle. It is still enjoyable, but the flavors are not present which usually are in this abbey ale. The fruity sweetess is all there with some spicy kick to it, but it has mellowed and become much smoother a very drinkable creamy robust mouthfeel is still here. However the drinkabiltiy of this beer unless you have it on tap is kind of low due to the fact that it's flavors are so complex. I love this beer, and the first time I had it was at Fuel and Fuddle where the bartender gaves us a free 750 ml corked bottle, and that day my friends and I learned what beer is capable of. A very smooth and creamy flavor that goes down much too easy for the alcohol in this somewhat aged beer. Not my favorite beer, but definitely one that I found full respect for due to the lesson it served to my palate of being so complex.","WVbeergeek","Feb 08, 2003"

The antithesis to an IPA; almost no hops flavor to be detected, but very, very, tasty. It's better at room temperature or just slightly chilled...so many flavors working together, this is a beer to rival granny's best baked goods.","shirfan","Jan 20, 2003"

4.02,0.2,3.5,4,4,4.5,4,"Corsendonk Abbey Brown Ale: In the big 750 ml bottle, with a cork on top. Served as part of the big Christmas celebration, the consensus of the group was that this was less satisfying than the Allagash double. When I poured it vigorously into the chalice, I managed to generate some head, but it was rather thin and did not last too long. This beer was dominated by malts, which tasted to me anyway, like a bowlful of raisons. This beer simply had too much dried/sweet flavor for me. Left a sweet and warming alcohol trace in its wake. If it was up to me, Id go with the Allagash, not that this was not a fine beer, but I thought the Allagash was better.","jackndan","Dec 26, 2002"

Corsendonk pours a beautiful white head that is one of the largest I've seen in a beer to date, and it stays very carbonated throughout the glass. The taste is frustratingly complex. It's frustrating because it's nearly impossible to place all the flavors. What I detected was mainly cherry and apple with about a million other fruit and malt flavors. This is definitely one of the beers that can hold their own against fine wine anyday. It's actually more complex than most of the wine I've had. All I can say is go out and get your piehooks on a bottle of this ASAP.","HossMcGraw","Dec 12, 2002"

Allowing it to warm brought out a much richer, vibrant, slightly caramel taste, though oddly enough it only seemed to stimulate the forward taste buds.

3.98,-0.7,4.5,4,4,3.5,4,"Being a Corsendonk fan imagine my joy of finding it on tap north of Boston. It poured a nice chestnut-brown with a tan head. When I picked up the glass (it was a Corsendonk glass) I almost got frostbite. Served as cold as a lager. After holding it between my hands for ten minutes it began to give off wonderful floral and fruit notes. Plum describes this aroma very well. The taste started to come around to that nice malty - orange peel flavor with under tones of alcohol and spice once it was above 50`F. Sadly by this time it had lost the effervescence of its rich yeasty head. The richness of Corsendonk's complexity from its yeasty head and spicy malt was lost. What should have been a 5 was reduced to a 4 due to inept serving. Such a shame. It was still a good ale but should have been a great ale.","purplehops","Nov 19, 2002"

Unfortunately, it doesn't leave any lace. The aroma is quite nice; very rich with a vibrant sweet malt and a mellow combination of fruits. The body is light-medium with a very fine and highly effervescent carbonation giving a caress to the tongue and a smooth, creamy mouthfeel. The flavor offers a candyish sweetness, with bright notes of ripe fruit. The alcohol is only lightly present, and can at times give the impression of fine brandy. The finish is surprisingly semi-dry with a light flourish of hops at the swallow, leaving a light, softly lingering sweet maltiness. Extremely well balanced; never allowing the sweetness to become cloying. An exceptional beer that is, in my opinion, one of the classics of the style. Absolutely enjoyable from start to finish.","NeroFiddled","Sep 19, 2002"

Very well made and a pleasure to drink.","doerickson","Sep 08, 2002"
3.75,-6.5,4,4,3.5,2.5,4.5,"Hazy deep garnet in hue, topped by a creamy, persistant light tan head that leaves loose lace. The aroma consists of  caramelized sugar and sweet candied dark fruit, along with a hint of raisiny Special B and banana esters. Clean, yet appetizing aromawise.  Black licorice and dark candi sugar  molasses - like sweetness hits the palate upfront and is ensued by light clove and mellow, smooth chocolate notes.  Lightly bodied for style and highly carbonated, perhaps   overly so.  Finishes with pleasant dark caramel and candy sweetness lingering.

Smell was mostly sweet and yeasty, some faint perfumey florals and fruits. Lots of yeast to start the taste, and a finish of roasted fruits that seemed to linger.
