"A great, and under-rated beer from Flying Fish.  I have had this on multiple occasions, and I think it's one of the most drinkable doubles I've had.  Maybe because the ABV isn't so ""extreme"".  Just great, complex flavor, body, and feel."

"great belgium style dubbed. less carbonated than imaging and equal if not better in taste."

"Easy to drink, smooth finish"
" The taste is very good with malt up front and yeast cohesion  in the light spice and hint of dark fruit in the taste. The light toasted grain and subtle dried plum character enhanced by subtle caramel and mild peppery quality lead to a gentle alcohol flavor in the finish. Overall a solid example of the style with very drinkable dry quality -Thanks to JC for sharing!"
"First real go at a dubbel.  The yeastiness is certainly different for me but this was good enough for me to try others"

"Pours a dark brown with a relatively pedestrian foamy off-white one inch head that settles into a swirling thin layer that remains just about all the way through.  Good amount of lacing on the glass.  Smell is grainy, sweet--hints of candy, dried fruit, raisin.  Taste is also sweet, slightly malty with a very good amount of carbonation -- a slight black licorice hint to things.  This is a very enjoyable winter beer.  For the price (about $8 for a six pack), I think you'd be hard-pressed to find a more enjoyable dubbel.  For the 7.20% ABV, this is VERY smooth."

"Just started dabbling with the abbey dubbel and it is fantastic.  Been drinking Smithwicks, Killians, the oktoberfests and winter lagers and the flying fish abbey has been the best i have tasted.  I've tried a lot of the darker microbrews but nothing can touch the abbey."

"Overall: Its not bad to drink but far from what it should be. I don't enjoy the strength of the roastiness, or the power of the phenols. a bit bitter ending as well. not quite what I would look for as an abbey dubbel or even a more liberal interpretation of the style. but overall I'd say its still decent and drinkable."

"Overall – A pretty enjoyable dubbel overall. Rather easy drinking and affordable in comparison to more renowned dubbels. It is at least worth a try."

"good local beer, on sale at the local bottle king. pours darkish brown, some fig and nutmeg aromas, hint of vanilla. flavor, hints of plum, chocolate, raisin. a bit of spicy bite. medium to light bodied, really not very thick, not a whole lot of carbonation. smooth drinking though and balanced"
"DATE TASTED: May 2, 2014... GLASSWARE: Chimay chalice... OCCASION: another Friday begins... APPEARANCE: dark, opaque ruby body; off-white, slightly creamy head that settles quickly; nicely lacing as the glass drains; a handsome bottle, as well... AROMA: Plum! sweet, sugary confections--some caramel and toffee--the raisin also presents late--not a plum/raisin guy myself, but this does deliver what it promises... PALATE: medium-bodied, chewy and significant--a formidable body--still drinkable without need of resolve...TASTE: big, sweet and dry--a wine's base that marries a brown ale's flatter profile--plum and malt strike an attractive balance... OVERALL: Its 7.2% ABV is well masked, as a wine-like profile is apt to do; a nice offering from the Flying Fish brewery--a great nightcap to a good day."

"Great taste with citrus, cloves and roasted malt. Pleasant smell with fruity aroma. But leaves a little not so great aftertaste leaving one with a feeling that this is not the real thing. Still a great substitute for the real thing brewed in Belgium. Offers a great variety and contrast to other types (IPA, Stout etc. ) when having multiple drinks in a single sitting."

"O: Its a decent dubbel, I would recommend it to a friend."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Unusual Belgian Dubbel, dark color with a persistent light foamy head. Aroma of fresh cut walnut wood. Taste is nuttiness and caramel with an aged wine barrel finish. Not much sweetness or bitterness, just a light pleasant nutty taste. Payday bar comes to mind."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Flying Fish definitely didn't make a bad brew here, but it's just slightly underwhelming. The roasted profile is a bit too pronounced, which makes for a very burnt/smoky experience. This might be good at the pub, or paired with some food, but it didn't exactly impress me as a sip-at-home brew. Worth a try; not worth a re-buy."
""
""
""
"Pours a clear orange-brown with a foamy khaki head that fades to nothing. Small dots of lace slowly drip into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is of malt, dark fruit, and spice aromas. Taste is much the same with toast and caramel flavors on the finish. There is a very mild amount of spice bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that still tastes fine almost 2 months after the best by date."

"A previous reviewer cited 12-15 dollars for a 6-pack. I get this for 7.99 at my local store. Definitely not sessionable(okay, so, I may drink two or more, but this will get you drunk). I drink them warm, mid-to-high 50's in to the low 60's. I love the grainy, malty, almost wild rice flavor I get. Somewhat nutty, but completely smooth and balanced. The alcohol is way too sharp when chilled in to the high 30's and low 40's, so the low reviews are reasonable if serving at low temperatures."

"Overall this beer is easy to drink but because of the high price (12-15 dollars a six pack) it's really not worth the revisit or session. Pity because their ""Exit 4"" triple rocked my taste buds."

"Decent Dubbel. Not epic by any means, but pleasant. Could definitely drink a couple on a cold night."
"O: Not much of a proper dubbel, but not BAD. I'd recommend this to a beginner drinker: the yeast profile is both subdued and very basic. That, and it's easy to drink. It's lowish score stems from the fact that it's vapid and unfulfilling to someone who enjoys this style done well."
""
""
""
"There was enough alcohol here, to be sure but not enough to make me think that this was purely a Dubbel. It just didn't feel like a Trappist Ale and almost felt like an Imperial Brown Ale, because of the stickiness and plain nature that this had. This just didn't quite measure up but Dubbels are full, complex beasts while this was more of an introductory beer to that style. If you've never had one of these before, this would be good to start with since more than one could be enjoyed in a sitting without be overwhelmed. Had this warmed me up a bit, I knew that it would have been more on target."
""
""
""

"In the taste, malty sweet with some light dark fruits and earthy hops. Nutty and hoppy, definitely has a raisin, plum, pecan thing going on. Firmly malty, but nicely balanced. Caramel, raisin toast, almond, pretty complex dubbel. Medium bodied feel with a fairly aggressive carbonation. Overall, a classic American version of a dubbel, and frankly, better than most."
""
""
""
""
"So, I poured this from a 12 oz bottle into a snifter. The color was great, but I could tell from the pour that this was going to be a thin dubble. I know there's no solid numbers for ABV for the Belgian styles, but 7.2% seems respectable. The beer looked like a Coke in terms of color and viscosity. The nose was OK- nothing really jumped out at me other than the yeast, but the taste was pretty decent- dark fruit (figs, raisins). It was very carbonated but thin. Would I have this again? Probably not."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This beer tastes a little lighter compared to other dubbels and doesn't seem to have enough flavors of dark fruits."
""
""
""
""
"Pours dark reddish brown with fast settling foam. Raisin, plum nose. Sugary. Malty sweet cola taste. Rich dark fruit flavor. Black cherry flavor. Firm carbonation. A touch sweet but good flavor. Pretty good all around."
""
""
""
""
"Overall - an easy drinking dubbel that's a bit too light for the style. But right now I'm drinking it on a hot summer night and it's simple and refreshing enough to be a ""lawnmower dubbel."""
"O- This was a pleasant surprise. Definitely not at the same level of real Belgians, but a solid Dubbel from Jersey? This would be good for the beginning Dubbel drinker. A smaller price tag to sample the style."
"It's a fine ale but it could use a bit more in the flavor profile."

"O: Not up with the finer Belgian dubbels but certainly respectable and far less expensive in the US"
""
"Pours with very little foam but nice dark brown/amber color. Smells like bitter fruit. Mouthfeel pretty good with weak coating but nice carbonation. Overall with 7.2% alcohol it's fairly easy to drink and nothing spectacular about it. Average but good"
""
""
"definitely flat. easy to drink for a 7.2%, but like most of theri beers i've tried, there is a 'fishy' taste to it. i just cant get into much of the stuff from this brewer, but it's not bad. maybe it's just psychological...."
""
"Pours a golden orange color, light haze, soapy head. Scent is quite yeasty and peppery, lacing many other qualities of the style. Taste follows suit... Mostly yeast and spice, lacking firm malt presence and fruitiness. Moderate carbonation. Weak sauce... Nothing too bad, but nothing really good either."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Dark fruits pervade. Fig, plum, toffee, bits of ginger, rounded out with a touch of spicy yeast. This isn't overly ""Belgian"" by any means. Definitely an American stab at it, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. A good representation, and a tasty cap to my evening. I think this would make a good one to draw someone into these Abbey-styles. Nice work, FF."
""
"O - I think this was a good offering from the brewery, and a decent shot at the style. Definitely an introduction to the style sorta thing to me. Tasty and satisfying, with a great price tag. I'd have it again. Cheers!"
"o: Not bad, a straight-forward representation of the style."
""
""
""
"D: meh, there are a lot of better dubbel's out there as well as a lot of better flying fish brews out there. pass on this one."
""
"Like other members of FF's ""classic," year-round lineup, this doesn't stand out within its style. Look to the Exit Series or the newer Red Fish for some of their better offerings."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Interesting beer. The taste makes up for the mild nose."
""
""
""
"Though it Doesn't embody a true dubbel in my opinion, just an intro to one."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a clear amber red with some alright head that eventually fades to nothing. Has some raisin and brown sugar notes. Some sharp alcohol in the nose as it warms . Also has some slight chewy caramel malts. Little to no hop aroma. Tastes similar to nose with medium to full mouthfeel. Flavors also give hints of fig and dark fruits (plum, dark cherry). Average bitterness for the style with a slight bite at the tail end. Overall, a very nice beer. Solid and very drinkable."
""
"O: This is a solid dubbel. Complex flavors and aromas."
""
""
"Nice prickly mouthfeel, and very drinkable. A nice beer, maybe not exactly the style."
""
"D: A decent mouthfeel and taste combination made for a pretty nice drinking beer. Mouthfeel could have been a bit smoother, but overall, pretty good drinking beer with some warming alcohol."

"Poured from bottle into New Belgium tulip glass. Pours a dirty brown rain water color, very little head retention. some head pools into the middle of the glass. I guess it looks like a Dubbel, but not one of the better examples. Smell- caramel syrup, raisins, a buttery aroma as well. Decent, but points detracted because it reminds me of what melted milk drops smell like when in a movie theater next to buttery popcorn. Chemically in some ways. Taste- chocolate cherry cough syrup. raisins, butter. This is a stylistic miss, and the chemically syrupy nature of this is present even more. This is not a good dubbel, below average. Mouthfeel is syrupy thick. Not good. This would be a strike out."

"Pours a copper color with ruby red in the middle and brown along the edges. There is a little sticky lace on the glass. The aroma is very faint there is a little aroma at all there is a hint of caramel and that is about it. The taste is a little bit better, there is a caramel backbone with a dark fruit flavor as well as a hint of licorice. The mouthfeel is moderately carbonated and a touch watery. Overall it is an average beer, the smell is a disappointment but the taste picks the beer up some."

"Overall; my fondness for the Belgian style has unfortunately faded quite a bit since the start of my craft beer journey... This was a very enjoyable beer of a style that I don't spend time with."
""
""

"Pours a deep reddish brown color with a smallish off white head that dissipates all to quickly. Smells of brown sugar and sweet fruity malt mostly. Raisins and prunes with a fair amount of caramelized sugars and hints of spicy yeasty esters. Taste is sweet and fruity up front with dark caramelized sugars coming next. Yeasty funk finishes as well a a lingering burnt sugar sweetness. Medium body with a moderate level of carbonation and a sweet slick mouthfeel. Not bad for an American interpretation of a dubbel. I enjoyed this one."

"D: Very drinkable, overall this was actually one of my favorite Dubbels."
"Maybe not 100% authentic, but then this is a New Jersey dubbel, and they've come up with a cool twist on the style. My third Flying Fish offering, and the brewery is ""good"" to ""excellent"" in my book so far."
"I'm an Abbey Ale purist and this is another fine example of American brewers not having a damn clue how to brew them. Not a disgusting beer, but way, way off the mark."
"I'd be curious to see what this is like on tap but as it stands I am unlikely to pick up a six pack of this anytime soon."
"O: It gets a little fermentation crazy at times, but the mouthfeel is excellent and the flavour is solid. The price is right, so worth a pickup."
"O: Great job guys. An excellent easy drinking, but high quality beer for the ages. I will buy this again and again. I just wish it were colder"
"D- Pretty smooth but balanced, could have more now and will definitely have again. Good beer."
"D: Very good tasting brew here... the 7% ABV is all there... Hell it feels like more than 7%.... Due to this this is a one and done for me. Worth looking for."
"O: nice malty beer with sweetness and raisiny flavor standing out."
"Pretty decent. Not my favorite dubbel, but I've had worse."
"its good, easy drinking, and has some decent flavors, but nothing to make me revisit."
"Pours a translucent brown with no head at all. Aroma of malts, malts and more malts. Taste follows the nose, no hop presence, sweet with dark fruit notes, a little too sweet. It's smooth and hides the alcohol very well. Not bad but certainly not the best dubbel, very good considering that it's an American brewery's take on the style."
"O - A drinkable brew, but not a great example of the style."
"Overall this a pretty much just a boring representation of the style. It's not bad overall if you haven't had great Belgian dubbels."
"Serving type: On Tap"
"New single with new label. Duped? Perhaps, perhaps not. 7.2% on label. Pour is clear and mediuim deep copper, light head with good stickiness. Nose is decent, malty though light, touch of yeast. Flavor is simple yet offers a lingering malt sweetness. Light, brown sugary and quite light in color and offering little nuance. More caramel than complex with a touch of hope on the finish. Not a bad beer, but not a good Dubbel. A check of thier website confirms that this is a current label and fresh product. App. minus 1.0, Smell minus .5 and Overall minus .5 The trend continues..."
"Bottle. Poured chestnut color with garnet highlights and a thick off white head that settled fairly quickly with very little lacing. Aroma is rich and appealing, molasses, dark fruits, chocolate-covered cordial cherries perhaps. Yeast is only mildly present to the smell. Flavor is sweet and fruity with a maraschino cherry touch, chocolate notes. Yeast, umami and cider on the long finish. Some tanic notes on the finish: not pleasant. Medium body. Texture is slightly sticky with medium carbonation. A good dubbel."
"(12oz bottle from Total Wine Desert Ridge). Pours slightly hazy amber color with tan head. Moderate carbonation and really no lacing. Aroma has some belgian sugar, apricot, and a bit of caramel. Taste is semi-sweet malt and light bittering hops. Medium bodied with slick texture. Finish is a bit harsh. This is an ok beer, but a poor dubbel."
"More and more, I am finding it helpful to look at style characteristics, especially after the preponderance of AALs in the early stages of The CANQuest (TM). I had (shamefully) forgotten the color of a Dubbel and was moderately surprised at what I was seeing coming out of the bottle. I got a fluffy two fingers of light-tan head that slowly fell like a souffle. Color was a beautiful copper, the color of an ex-girlfriend's hair (miss you, LindaLou), with NE-quality clarity. Nose evidenced notes of dried dark fruits, caramel and a slight yeasty mustiness. Mouthfeel was medium, approaching creamy, with a lot of caramel flavor on the tongue. This was quite sweet (for my tastes) and yet highly drinkable, given the way it seemed to evaporate from my glass. Finish was equally sweet with the caramel simply lingering. Wow, but this was way too easy to drink! It is a good thing I stay in practice."
"Can't hate on the dubbel ale. Its a bit stong registering at a 7.0% but thats a Dubbel. It had great mouth feel and a descent amount of carbination."
"O/D - The appearance and nose of this beer had me anticipating more from the flavor and feel. The flavors are milder than I would have liked. The mild flavors with the low carbonation left something to desire in the finish."
"overall a really good beer"
"The one impressed me a bit. This beer poured out as a murky looking brown color. The head was a little soapy looking while it lasted. The smell of the beer was pretty close to the real thing, there were some earthy aromas along with dark fruits and Belgian yeast. The taste brought the smell to life with the same basic elements. The mouthfeel is a little on the light side. Overall its not a bad dubbel in my opinion at all."
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a dark brown color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of dark fruits, some yeast and spice. Taste has fruits and spices, some yeast and malts, good flavor but not overpowering.Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a good quality beer."
"Poured orange brown with a quickly-receding white head. Fruits and light sugars in the nose. Similar fruits and sugars in the taste, sweet malts, with some yeastiness coming through. Light to medium body, smooth, and quite drinkable."
"O- Good flavor and smooth but the flavor is gone so fast from the finish it's kind of disappointing. But overall this is a great tasting beer."
"Overall a decent beer, just not one that I was thrilled with. Probably wouldn't pick it up again."
"O - More like a nice mild brown ale. This one is nice for an easy drinking night. Not overpowering in any regard."
"Not bad but the Doubles should be left to the Belgians. This misses."
"m/d - I can really feel the alcohol tingle. malty and somewhat thick tasting. this could be a good gateway dubbel. VERY easy drinker. I tend to prefer a more classic dubbel, but I did enjoy this beer very much."
"Poured into a tulip glass, the beer has a clear ruby-amber coloring, with a skinny, bubbly, sparse head that quickly disappears. Semi-sweet malt flavors with coriander spicing. Also, some darker fruit notes to the aroma. The beer has sour and tart malt flavors, with a light spice that doesn't fully balance. Light flavors on a round and oily/slick body. The beer has a roasted and slightly sour aftertaste, with the sour characteristics lingering into the slick finish. Not overly impressed on this one, and the mouthfeel makes me want to seek other Dubbels to spend my money on."
"This beer is pretty low in body for it's strength. It has a light syrupy texture. Hops shine through a bit more than usual for a Dubbel and the yeast adds a fair bit of spice. Also dark fruit and a warming alcohol."
"The pour was a nice medium amber in color. Nice dark highlights throughout the mostly cloudy body of the glass. A small head of white peaked out over the top of the glass and settled down nicely into a thin, but firm coating across the top of the glass. Aroma is loaded with bready malts. Tons of rich bready notes that just would not quit. Really nicely laid out, but as it warmed it became evident that it was slightly one dimensional and the light notes of grapes and pears could not save it from being over run by the malts. The flavor was about the same as the huge malt and grain bill dominated all that was around it. Nice and full feel to it though and the carbonation was nearly spot on, the only downside here was that the caramel and fruit that lay underneath was just not given enough room to really flourish."
"Pours brown with red hues and a minimal fizzy beige head. Sweet caramel and chocolate nose with some dark fruit, just some light notes of plum and raisin. Big chocolate taste with a hint of coffee. A good dose of caramel sweetness with some slight fruity esters, raisin and grape. Finish is rather crisp and dry. This really doesn't seem like a dubbel to me, just a bit too much roasted character and not enough yeast profile. A tasty offering, mind you, but a bit to clean. I always have trouble picking out flavors in most Belgians, but this was pretty cut and try. Tasty, though, and very drinkable. An overall solid beer."
"Drinkability (3.5): The taste and feel is very enjoyable but this smells and feels more like 9% than 7%. I also feel like the flavors are melded so well because this one has some age on it."
"Drinkability: A very delicious beer for casual consumption."
"Drinkability is pretty good, I could have another."
"D: Not a very well made beer. A pale version of Belgian beer. Not very drinkable."
"Drinkability: This is a perfectly good American dubbel that as I thought at the beginning comes across as good, not great."
"Very drinkable but just not very complex"
"D: A very good beer and intro to those who have never had a Dubbel. Very easy to drink, although I think there are better Flying Fish beers. I would definitely drink this again, but I wouldn't go out of my way to buy this one."
"M - Very little carbonation and a pleasant crisp feel lend a refreshing character to this beer. Not as malty as many doubles i have had yet well balanced and enjoyable down to the last drop."
"D:I would consider this quite drinkable. It masks the alcohol very well. For the price, unbeatable. I purchase 1 single bottle. Next time I go out I would at least purchase a six pack."
"Just tapped a 1/6th keg last week. I poured this one into a standard pint glass. The color reminded me of a copper/amber lager. There was very minimal, if any, head which quickly dissipated to a thin ring around the edges. No lacing at all as my glass was emptied. The smell was sweet, which matched the taste. I sensed a bready brown sugar-raisin taste in the beginning and end. Very little carbonation. A good, easy to drink NJ beer that can't quite match a real Belgian Dubbel though. I was surprised that the 7.3% ABV was well hidden."
"I got this one as an extra in a trade with IDrinkGas a while back. Thanks again for this one! Poured into a goblet. Pours a dark hazy amber with a thin white head that fizzes away quickly with thin lacing. The smell is rich and malty with a nice fruit profile for the background. The aroma is really sweet. Similar flavor profile to the aroma. Sweet and malty with a bit of a dark fruit flavor to it. If I were to pinpoint it I'd probably say cherries. The mouthfeel is decent, full but I feel like the carbonation could be toned down. Overall this is kind of sweet and full making it a bit of a sipper for me."
"12 oz. bottle. Pours hazy brownish color with a foamy medium lasting white head. Good amount of carbonation. Aroma is bready, Belgium yeast, floral spicy hops, some fruit and brown sugar. Medium body with some tartness. Flavor is caramalt, brown sugar and spicy hops. Finish is sweet, but not cloying, with some spicy hops balance. Simple, but tasty and inexpensive dubbel."
"Drinkability: Sufficiently so-so for a stateside dubbel! A decent beer at a decent price, though I'd prefer something a bit more refined and on the dry side."
"This caught my eye as I entered TW as a great price on a sixer of dubbels! Let's give it whirl and see if it pans out. Popping the top I get that great Belgian smell of yeast, spices, some brown sugar and cinnamon. Pours into a chalice to a hearty translucent brown with a wispy head. Taste is also classic Belgian with an up front sweetness from the double malts and a tartiness in the middle as the carbonation and hops take over the sweetness. Finish is mildly bitter and clean. This is an easy drinker and the 7.3% ABV is barely noticeable except for attributing to a silky smooth mouthfeel. This is a good brew and a great value."
"drinkability: fantastic brew. great food beer. prety good example of a blegian dubbel, not fantastic but good and I would buy often. fantastic price."
"D: Overall not bad, just not great. 3.5"
"D- A well made beer that hides the alcohol well. Not one of the best Dubbels out there, but worth checking out."
"D: Given that Flying Fish makes one of my favorite Trippels (Exit 4), I had high hopes for the Dubbel, but alas, it's simply not my glass of beer."
" D- There is not much flavor to this beer with a hint of malt and no real yeast characteristics."
"This is decent but really nothing special. Lacks any real character, although it does have some nice elements. There are better dubbels out there."
"I poured from a 12 ouunce bottle into a snifter. It pours a deep caramel brown with a nice white head, quickly receding. The aroma is sweet and has a phenolic quality. The flavor is rich and malty. It finishes sweet with a light alcohol and some fruitiness. It is medium in body and a nice sipper."
"Excellent American version of a dubbel I can see myself going back to often. That is, if I wasn't attempting to try every other beer in existence."
"I wasn't surprised to see the style, even though I hadn't tried a dubbel before I knew what it was supposed to taste like and I thought this fit it fairly well. The ABV was slightly higher than I expected but I usually guess low."
"Pours a thin, clear amber brown color with a small tight tan head that quickly settled into a light ring. The aroma is of brown sugar and honey with some nuttiness. There is a light perfumey phenol from the yeast. The taste is sweet with brown sugar flavor, some light caramel or honey notes as well. There is a light spice from the yeast, nothing distinct. Some nut flavors as well as lemon finish out the flavor. The feel is light to moderate with tingly carbonation. Sweet overall on the palate but does finish a tad astringent with a light earthy bitterness. An average American made dubbel. There are some nice flavors but not very deep. The feel seems to be a bit off. Ok in a pinch."
"A very nice brew, with a unique licorice taste."
"This is not a deep beer, but it is pleasantly drinkable, despite the ABV."
"But the drinkability is strictly average, almost bordering on slightly hard to drink with all its flavor."
"For the most part, Flying Fish brews better than average beer that is never quite as good as I hope it will be. Belgian Style Dubbel is more of the same. It's still an enjoyable way to start off a sunny Tuesday... and I have jwc215 to thank for it."
"far from true to style, but stands on its own legs very well. a good beer, but not what I'd go for if I want a true Belgian dubbel"
"Tried this on a whim, was in the seasonal aisle in my favorite beer joint. Smells kind of like baked bread, a bit of malt, some caramelized sugar, nothing overly distinctive or offensive. The abv of 7.3 percent is well hidden, tastes pretty much like it smells. Tastes like baked bread to me, not the most overwhelming Dubbel I have ever had for sure, a good session beer. Just make sure someone will be the designated driver...Overall, a nice Dubbel with no big surprises tastewise."
"Drinkability is insane for 7.3% I'm a fan of this beer and I would definitely get it again. Interested to get my hands on some more of this brewery."
"Overall - A great intro to the style, and hey, I am supporting local beers"
"D: This beer drinks good. For an american version of the style it works."
"D: To me, not too many dubbels are session beers, or brews that can be drank without really enjoying the beer. This one can be drank in that manner, which is both a good thing and a bad thing. Still, a good beer that doesn't venture too far out of the realm of the style, but doesn't stand out either."
"d - all in all it is a drinkable beer. probably not something i would not seek out again but i wouldn't turn it down if someone gave it to me."
"D: The abv prevents this from being a session type of brew. I would be reluctant to buy a case for gatherings due to the fact (based on those around me while drinking) that many casual drinkers may be put off by the abv."
"Drinkability: All in all, it's mild enough that it goes down quickly, but the 7.3% ABV doesn't make that the best idea. I agree with some of the other review - it's just a little too muted, and simplistic. It's not a bad brew, and not a bad attempt at the style, but not what I would go to if I want a Dubbel."
"Poured a 12oz bottle into my Tripel Karmeliet tulip. This beer pours a browned cherry with a decent-ish, tawny head, which leaves a ring around the glass and little to no lacing. The aroma is Dubbel light. Mild dark fruits, prune, apple and a bit of cherry. Light toffee, and toast also make an appearance. The flavor to is rather light only offering wisps of the typical flavors associated with a Dubbel. The one thing different about the aroma then the flavor would be a definite yeasty spiciness that is very detectable in the finish of every sip. Also the 7.3 percent alcohol is very well hidden which shocks me. The mouthfeel goes along with everything I've said about this brew. Its really light, doesn't linger on the palate, and has a very mild carbonation to it. This is a decent attempt at a Abbey Dubbel. Honestly, I wish this beer were amped up a bit. Need a heavier aroma, a bigger flavor and much, much more body."
"D - Not bad, the light body helps."
"CHEERS!"
"cheers!!!"
"Poured dark amber into a tulip. Very little head, with spotty lacing. The aroma was a tease..sweet cherry, plum, sugar, molasses, and a slight hint of citrus. The individual aromas weren't as prominent in the flavor, with an overriding malty sweet alcoholic feel. Medium-bodied, yet easily drinkable. Got the impression that this was a good Belgian-style beer for beginners. Wouldn't expect Belgian fanatics to give this one a second chance."
"This is my first experience with this style of beer. It pours amber red with a nice amount of head. The smell is of bananas and spice. Taste is sweet and smooth. The style doesn't suit me but it is still a good beer, as an alternative to what I like or a change of pace I would recomend this one."
"Poured a dark, tea colored amber. Nice head, bright white and bubbly. I'm always impressed with lacing, and this one has it. Smells alright, almost like its trrrryyyiinnnggg to be a belgian, but not quite there yet. Tastes slightly like banana with some maltiness. I can enjoy most beers and have only recently begun to enojy belgians, but I feel like this one has cross-over appeal for the average pilsner drinker."
"Dark amber colored beer with a rapidly fading head.Aroma is spicy.Taste is rum,dark fruit and sugar cane.A pretty good overall beer with a tiny warmth at the end of the glass.Smooth and drinkable.I recommend this beer and would gladly purchase again!!"
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Right at the start, the texture just blankets itself all over and around the tongue, softly foaming and rolling around in the mouth. It gets better and better as it comes to room temperature, as does the flavor. It's a big enough beer to keep me at just a single serving, but I'd be happy to have this again in the near future."
"Bottle: Poured a dark amber color ale with a large off-white foamy head with good retention but minimal lacing. Aroma of fruity ester with some sweet Belgian style malt and some light alcohol. Taste is a nice enough mix between some fruity ester some candi sugar and nice Belgian malt. Body is about average with good carbonation but light alcohol burn was slightly disappointing. Not bad overall but I have seen better form this style."
"Drinkability: Although I like some dubbels, they are not one of my favorite styles. But I think this one is a good well-made example. I am enjoying drinking this one but I also have to admit I have had a few I liked better. Still, I'd be quite comfortable buying more of this beer. Also, this would also be nice to serve at a party where people are sipping and chatting."
"This one caught me off guard. I bought a variety pack and this one by far was the best. Well worth it."
"Not my favorite - one was enough"
"More easily drinkable than you might expect from a Dubbel as it has a fairly mild body."
"Pours a nice brown color, not much lacing. Scents of belgian candy, kinda sweet, but not cloying. Sweet malts on the nose, but a nice hop presence kills the sweetness. A bit medium in body. Has some raison sightings, not to mention plummy. Very easy to drink. Maybe not quite a chimay, but enjoyable and worth the price."
"D- 7.3% is in the ball park for this style and with more alcohol comes more ingredients used, so this is where it needs to be. Any more and this risks going over the edge flavor wise. Would like to try from a tap to compare. A decent Belgian style dubbel but doesent hold a candle to others across the pond, but i've yet to have a american version that holds up to that standard."
"Overall not a great representation of the style, but a damn fine beer. I would seek this out again for sure. Thanks Mike!"
"Despite the lack of appearance and taste not being overwhelming, this beer is very drinkable. It is high in alcohol as well - which did not stand out to much to me. Very drinkable - I could get a case and get drunk with this stuff all night..."
"Don't drink and review."
"Drinkability- decent not really my cup tea but worth a try and gets tad sweet as you go"
"d - the price is right, and that makes this even a better break from the more expensive occasional celebration beers"
"Note: As this warmed, the sweet, dark fruit flavors are joined by a tartness and sourness. The lemon I sensed before really came through. No more enjoyable, however."
"Meh."
"Pours a transparent ruby, rusty brown color with a small foamy white head and some visible slow rising carbonation. Brown sugar and caramel malt make up the average nose. The cinnamon and brown candy sugar return while tasting, tons of over sweet malts and notes of caramel, butterscotch and a hint of lime. Subtle waves of alcohol give the beer a slightly medicinal feel. Strange indeed. This is in no way traditional in style but alas it makes for a damn good American brown ale IMO. Medium light in body, weak carbonation and no where near enough bready yeast to give the dubbel the chew it deserves. I love supporting the local guys but this one just didn't do it for me based on the style."
"4.5 D: I really like this. This is my first dubbel, so maybe I think it's better than it actually is, but I'm hooked now. I could drink this all night."
"Shines a ruby amber when held to the light almost like an irish red. The nose hits alcohol to candy sugar, hitting the taste right on. A nice puney opening to a bitter candy finish with an alcohol reminder in the aftertaste. Better and better as it warms and actually the best USA(3pistols) version of the style I've had yet."
"An amber colored beer with a decent head that vanished amazingly fast and left little lacing. The aroma is malt, ripe dark fruit, and sweet. A roasted husky flavor on the palate mixes with more ripe fruit sweetness. A little bit of medicinal character as well. Smooth and medium to full bodied on the palate. Pretty middle of the road I think. Not near the ditch, but nothing extraordinary."
"d: This was okay, but the sweetness was distracting."
"Overall this is a pretty good beer, probably something I would revisit once the trees turn."
"D: Worth a try if you get a chance, but not a standout."
""
"if you throw out your neck...put this in a goblet, spoon out a bowl of chili with a hunk of wheat bread, ask your girlfriend to get naked and bring them to you on a tray with a healthy dose of muscle relaxer and a bib... now your living"
"Quite drinkable for a dubbel."
"D: it is a good representation of style, but I do pull some off flavors to me...ie peanut butter. Worthy of a shot, not a repeat for me."
"Final thoughts - It was an OK experience for me. Kind of one dimensional. Maybe its just the style."
"12 oz. bottle that was poured into a Flying Fish pint glass. This Dubbel was a dark amber with no head of foam whatsoever. There wasn't even a sign that there was going to have a head of foam on this beer. There were plenty of bubbles, but no head of foam. I served it at room temp, so this beer has no reason why it didn't have a head of foam. It had an aroma of tobacco, burnt malts, a pinch of dark cherries, and ended with a smll touch of burnt citrus hops. The aroma just loved the smell of something being burnt. It had a pretty much average taste of dark fruits, sweet yeast, sweet caramel, and then the taste ended with some roasted citrus hops. There wasn't much to the taste, but at least the flavors weren't burnt like they were in the aroma. It was a medium bodied beer with a short lived aftertaste of yeast and sweet dark fruits. I do have to hand it to them because they were able to mask the 7.3% ABV. I would like to give this beer another chance. I sure hope that the next bottle doesn't taste like this. If it does, I wouldn't touch this beer again."
"Decent beer and easily drinkable good American try as a Dubbel."
"Mouthfeel was medium bodied and easy to drink. I could have had a couple, but overall pretty sweet."
"I was very skeptical of this beer, i have seen before and i decide to try it out. I pour this beer in a sniffer glass. After the first few sips, i thought how similar it tasted to a chimay, not exact. The important thing is that this beer is an actual beligan style dubbel in a six pack, and it taste pretty close to the genuine thing."
"Great beer. I only had one of these but I wish I had more, definitely try this beer."
"The appearance was good. It had the typical reddish brown pour with an off white head that fades quickly into the beer. It smelled of dried fruits prunes, raisins, and hints of honey and molasses. When I took the first sip I caught everything but it was lacking something. Maybe not enough brown sugar or molasses, but it struck me as funny. The mouthfeel was there for a dubbel, I will give them that, but whatever it lacked, spoiled its drinkability. Would I drink it again? Well after two pins just to be sure, I may want to try it bottled. Should I?"
"One of the better beers that I've sampled from Flying Fish - a well-known brewery in my home state... their Belgian Style Dubbel was a winner... nice dark-brown, slight purple hue with minimal frothy head that soon dissipated... smell was such as expected from a Dubbel... dark, brown, sugars, sweet caramel and malts... taste paid homage to the aroma, with dried fruit, figs, prunes, malts, sugars, honey, and molasses... good, rich flavor, with a nice mouthfeel and good drinkability for a 7.3% ABV... no alcohol detected, a great combination of flavors without being overbearing or extreme... Flying Fish did well with this one... A good depiction of the style... Recommended..."
"I say not bad, but not fantastic either. Not a great example of a Belgian Dubbel, yet still good in its own right. Definitely worth a try."
" D: decent drinkability but was not what i was expecting style wise."
"Not an overly special dubbel, but a decent take on it. Worth a try."
"D - I could burn through a few of these in a night no problem."
"12 oz bottle. Pours a crystal-clear, iced tea-ish brown with a half finger head that settles into a thick collar. Quite active carbonation, lots of bubles rising to the top. Aroma is sweet & fruity with a hint of peaches! Taste is initially sweet & fruity, giving way to a dry maltiness in the middle with some alcohol bitterness on the swallow (but nothing unpeaasant). Mouthfeel is mediuim, neither heavy nor watery, with a bit of fizziness from the bubbles. No trace of any yeasties in the bottle or glass, odd for a bottle conditioned ale. All in all, pretty good stuff, well worth the investment of the price of a sixer. I've bypassed this brew on many a beer run in the past, but I won't make that mistake again! This one's a winner!!!"
"An after thought: this reminds me of a beer I recently tried - Riverwest Stein Beer."
"D- Goes down the hatch nice and easy."
"D: This is a good American Dubbel. I will definately have a few of these. The heartiness of the malts equals the sweetness."
"...Willy"
"Not sure that it fits the style so well, but not a bad brew if you are looking for a mild, malty drink."
"D: Pretty enjoyable overall - not the top representation of the style, but an outstanding value for a nice, high quality beer."
"Drinkability: Using caramel malt plus Special B does not necessarily make a great Dubbel, however, the product is highly potable and easy to drink. No adventuresome enough for the connoisseur, but tasty enough to through back a couple with a casual beer drinker. (3.5)"
"Man, I think this is pretty on the mark for the style. Reminds me a lot of Chimay Red, but without the natural carbonation. It has a dark fruit and herb aroma with more of the same in the flavor. It finishes with a touch of hops and the slightest bit of alcohol heat. I think all that's holding this back is the carbonation. Otherwise you've got yourself a dubbel here."
"Body is on the lighter side for this style and drinkability is excellent. I drank this after yard work was done and it was very rejuvinating."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not very filling, decent kick, very good representation of style, it’s a beer well worth drinking for an evening. This is the fifth of five beers from Flying Fish Brewing that NeroFiddled traded to me and I’ve been quite pleased with all of them."
"A solid, but not great attempt to bring Belgium a little closer to home."
"D: Yet another American brewer fails at making a decent dubbel. Not a surpise. This one is drinkable, but not worth buying, IMO."
"Pours a nice clean/clear dark amber color, nice carbonation, nice little fizzy head, some islands and sticky lacing hang around. The nose is pretty nice of malts, yeast, some spices, and caramel. The taste is sweet, malty, yeasty, bready, nice touch of spices, and some caramel thrown in. The alcohol is hidden very well. Medium body. Very drinkable, this is a very nice dubbel, glad to have had a chance to try it out, definitely would recommend."
"Considering how much this one sells for, this could be in the running for the most cost efficient dubble ever."
"Make no mistake, this is a decent beer and easily drinkable. However, it's no dubbel."
" Drink: If you are a Belgium fan than you have to give this beer a try. I Can assure you you will, like me, have at least one bottle of this beer in the fridge at all times."
"Pours a clean crisp dark hue, with some bubbly head and a slight aroma of belgian yeasty tang. Light chocolate presence, some estery fruits. Taste is big on the sweetness, some roasted flavor but not as big and bready as most dubbels. Nice mouthfeel and the alcohol is covered well by it. Belgian flavors are somewhat fleeting here, but if you find those unique yeasts cloying to the tongue this is a good version to start your tastebuds on."
"Served a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. Poured a mostly amber-brown color with about a finger of head. No real lacing, and the head faded fairly fast. Fairly mild aroma that came off as mostly caramel malty. Taste was fairly strong, dubbel taste, although falling fairly closely in with an ESB type taste. Mostly caramel malt, just a little fruit and spice in the mild hops, and lots of salt, especially in the aftertaste. Feel was fairly thin to medium body, taste that slid off the palate with a pretty good, slow pace (although nothing out of control). Overall, it's a pretty good beer; it's a little salty for my liking (and might even be better categorized as an ESB), and was pretty mild, but it did pretty well for what it did. No real complaints, and I'd try in again (although maybe not if another dubbel was available)."
"I want to like this beer more than I do for its localness. It's got some assets, like the poignant malt presence, but the seeming lack of a real blend is a distraction, and the yeast just doesn't ester up as I'd like for the style. And that ABV, while not at all extreme, is presented as one hot number, and that keeps the quantity to the middle tier, at best. I'd think maybe pushing that yeast a bit might yield some more typical character and style, but what do I know? I won't turn it down, but I won't seek it out either."
"Drinkability: For a ""local brew"" (i.e. Cherry Hill, NJ) this is an outstanding find. Well worth using as a good representation of a dubbel style. Pass me another, and another!"
"Mouthfeel is a tad thin for a dubbel, but drinkability rises for the same reason. This is a good example of the style and might help cushon newbies taking the plunge into Belgian styles."
"Drinkability: This is a subtle dubbel that is not bad but is far too understated to compete with the Belgian brewers"
"Overall this is a beer that could use some improvement, and although it wouldn't be my first choice it is something that I would definitely order again."
"Sweet malt dominated aroma with mild hints of candied nuts. Mahagony colored with a diminishing thumb thick tan head. Fore is sweet malts with nutty accents and a dry finish. Lacks the body of a true Belgian dubbel as well as the range of flavor. Pretty basic and up front, but tasty enough. A session dubbel?"
"Not bad."
"Mouthfeel is fizzy at first, smoothing out into a sugary cocoa brew."
"D - It isn't offensive enough to be very difficult to drink. Overall, it's characteristics are mild, so it doesn't do much damage. It isn't very good, but it isn't awful either. It could be sessioned fairly easily for a nice change from macro styles. All and all, I'd avoid this one. I can say with confidence that this is probably the last FF Dubbel I will ever have."
"Heres to finding good beer in Lancaster PA :) Cheers!"
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1/4"" light tan head above the slightly cloudy dark amber brew. Head quickly fades down to an uneven layer of bubbles, with average bubbly lacing. Aroma is worty grain, not much else. Taste is the same wortish malt, with a fruitiness in the middle, and a slight alcohol close. Mouthfeel and drinkability are both ok as well. Certainly not what I would want/expect from the style, and overall just kind of average. Could drink it now and again, but wonder why I would."
"Poured a medium amber color with modest white head. Smell is very enjoyable, with a nice combination of fruitiness, spice, and candy sugar. Taste improves on the smell with the candy sugar predominating and a light spiciness in the background. Alcohol is completely hidden and it goes down smooth as silk. A very pleasant beer, with great drinkability. A good example of the style."
"-UF"
"Obviously very well attenuated, which may not work especially well for this style. I like a little weight behind this kind of malt. Almost a cross between a dubbel and an english brown ale, mostly because of the malt. All around a delicate beer. Nicely put together, obviously a quality product, but not something I'd think of immediately when selecting a beer. Something about the malt doesn't quite jive, and the attenuation doesn't exactly have me reaching for another bottle. Still, it's a nice little nightcap after slaving over drawings all day."
"I find this one to be drinkable. I won't knock someone over for it (like say, a Brewer's Art dubbel) but it is solid."
"The taste has a light sweetness to it up front, which only grows as the beer slips down my throat. The beer finishes with a concentrated, sweet note that is a mix between figs and raisins, though quite a bit sweeter than either is naturally. The beer is somewhat light on the palate, but it does have a bit of heft to it from the sweetness. I am really quite surprised by the intense fruitiness that is found in this beer; there is also some sort of note that reminds me of concentrated pulpy plum flesh, almost has a hint of astringency to it as well. There is a bit of hot alcohol in the finish, but not any more than a subtle note reminiscent of rum and brandy. Overall this is pretty tasty, but like many Dubbel's it seems to be lacking a certain something."
"A slightly disappointing introduction to Flying Fish's beers. Certainly not a bad beer, FF Dubbel is a solid  but not amazing  take on the dubbel style. I'm probably not going to try this again, but I'll give some of the other FF beers a shot."
"Alright enough, but kind of boring for a dubbel. Missing all the good and tasty sugars and yeasts I like about dubbels. Pours a nice and dark amber in color with no head. Nose is malts and I [ick up some alcohol. However, I cannot taste that alcohol at all. Some Belgian sugars come through in the flavor, but they are rather dull, flat and uninspiring. Also, picking up some brown sugar and is very sweet. Mouthfeel is rather watery. Fine in a pinch, but this beer is not doing it for me."
"Pours a nice amber color with a light coating of foam over top. The nose is interesting. I get a nice brown sugar sweetness and a dose of spiceyness from the yeast. There is a slight orangeyness from the malt as well. The flavor is okay, with a light borwn sugar and spiceyness being most prevalent. This one is surprising me. Better than I expected. The feel is right at thick with a moderate carbonation. I'm digging this one. The spiceyness is helping carry it through. Good show."
"Pours a dark amber color with a small head that has nice retention and leaves some lacing on the glass. The aroma is spicy and has hints of specialty malts, but it's a fairly mild aroma. The flavor is also much more mild than expected. Very smooth and non-spicy. There are some hints of the spices, but they just aren't present enough. Finish is slightly dry. This beer needs more character for a Belgian Dubbel style. It's a rather tasty beer, but it's way too ""normal"" and smooth and without spicing for the desired style. Mouthfeel is moderate and the drinkability is ok. Don't get me wrong, this is a fine and dandy beer and I'd drink it all the time if it were available here, but it's just not even close to what I want from the style."
"As for drinkability, as a Belgian Style Dubbel, it fails, but as a strong, I don't know, Newcastle Brown Ale, it's pretty damn yummy! It even LOOKS like Newcastle. Maybe Flying Fish should call this something else. It would definitely appeal to lovers of brown ales."
"Overall this isn't bad at all. I haven't tried too many doubles to compare, but it way sweet, but not like Triples or Quads. Just different."
"This is a nice clear amber colored beer with a lot of carbonation, and a huge tight head. It smells pretty good, there is a good fruity smell, a little bit of yeast. There is a bit of a sour smell. The taste is good, fruity and yeasty. A bit of that Belgian funk, and almost no bitterness. The mouthfeel is good. It is a tasty, easy to drink beer. I'd love to find it on draft some time."
"Drinkability - Fairly drinkable, especially for a dubbel with 7+ percent alcohol."
"While I am not sure it fits the profile it is a drinkable brew, more of an entry level Dubbel. Aroma is funky sour sweet. Slightly malty taste - slightly sweet with some buttery diacetyl notes. Some oats some yeasty vinous taste. A hard beer to pin down with respect to what to like or dislike. Drinkable for sure but not one I will seek out again. More like a brown ale than a dubbel to me."
"Drinkability: Due to the poor drinkability, I have to give an average rating"
"Some fruit in yeast, yeasty and bitter aftertaste. Underachieving Belgian. Modest carbonation and medium mouthfeel. The soap must be from their washing of glass. Had at The Standard Tap. I am not sure I will ever love flying fish, but I must try again elsewhere."
"Pours a deep coppery brown with a volumnous tan head into a 16 oz. American shaker pint. Mild yeasty/fruity quality about the aroma with some lesser roasted malt and candi sugar smells. Sugary and fruity, some chocolaty maltiness in the middle, with a mild, leafy astringency near the finish. Not bad, but not what I'm used to in a U.S. brewed dubbel interpretation. It seems to lack a little complexity, which in turn doesn't aid it's drinkability."
"This was not a very easy drinking beer for me but it's kind of hard to give this style a fair evaluation, I'm just starting to try Belgians. Perhaps I'll be editing this down the road when I experience more of them. Oh well... you have to start somewhere."
"Appearance: Very much brown ale esque with a ruby brown hue and tan head leaves nice scattered lacing not bad. Aroma: Biscuit malt sweetness low hop presence some undertoned fruit notes produced by their house yeast not bad. Taste: Toasted malts biscuit sweetness rolls nicely not a bad dubbel just not a true dubbel for me finishes very sugary and cereal in nature not like it's Belgian brethran at all. Mouthfeel: Becomes cloying midway through a bit sticky and syrupy with a rough carbonation in the mix wow not a fan of this one. Drinkability: Medocirty in some of it's glory right in front of me not a dubbel definitely an American Brown ale."
"Drinkability: One is enough, and a pint may have been a few ounces too many. Get the real thing, and then if you still crave them, give this a shot."
"Alcohol hidden nicely."
"12 oz bottle, no freshness dating. Pours dark russet brown, low carbonation, minimal white, tiny bubble film, leaving some lacing. Makty candi sugar nose. Smooth malt body, sweet, with candi sugars, notes of rum, raisins. Thin body, a bit watery for a dubbel. Sort of a ""Dubble lite"" Pleasant stuff, but on the lite side as far as body and flavor go."
"i will leave it at that"
"Beer is good. Happy Beligian beering."
"Overall: I was very happy with this purchase. It was very drinkable and I am looking forward to the next six pack. Their ESB must be the odd one out of the lot."
"12 ounce bottle, no freshness dating. The bottle said bottle conditioned, but nothing was in the bottle or my glass as far as sediment, so I doubt it is bottle conditioned. A nice drinking beer, but a not a great Dubbel...kind of boring in that regard."
"The beer pours a dark amber/ruby color with a thick off-white head. The aroma is good. It has a nice malty scent that is enhanced with it's Belgian yeast aroma. It has light liquorice smell that is quite pleasant. The taste is good. It has a smooth plum/ crystal malt flavor that goes down easy and finishes creamy. It has a nice fruity yeast flavor that adds to the beer. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium bodied beer with good carbonation. This is a good dubbel; full of flavor and great mouthfeel. The best Flying Fish beer I've had."
"Pours reddish copper with a head that leaves, like now. No bubble action at all. Smells a little hoppy, taste starts sweet, like carmel, and finishes sort of bitter fruity. Not a bad beer, but I would prefer a little more substantial action. Can't quite put a handle on it, but seems to come up a little short."
"Mouthfeel- watery turning to bitter."
"Pouring this fish produced a frothy head that went right back where it came from in a real hurry. This beer is dark brown in color and looked basically as I expected it would. The initial taste of the beer started out sweet which was a bit surprising since it had a bitter nose to it. Then flavor did not stay sweet, it turned bitter as it settled on the tongue. F.F. needs to develop some new beer. I've grown bored with the selection they have even with the couple seasonals. They started off great but need to develop some more refined beer."
"Pours a dark, red-tinged brown color with a respectable, small-bubbled head. Aroma is malty and slightly phenolic. Some plum flavors in the foretaste. Malty through most of the beer, with a nice spicy finish. Medium to light bodied, which seemed out of place. I would have preferred a bit more heft.in fact, most of the characteristics seemed a little muted. Still, its an enjoyable, tasty beer. With a little more flavor and bigger ester and phenol punch, it would have gotten higher marks."
"I should know better, but this was advertised as being Flying Fish's best effort. It is not. Their Grand Cru is much better. The best thing going for the beer is its appearance and smell. They are the only thing this beer has going for it. It's funky taste, oily feel in the mouth, and metallic aftertaste make this one to stay away from. I fought my way through the beer but should have just ask the bartender to pour it out."
"Pours a dark copper color with little head and slight lace. some carbination. Peppery understones mixed with the typical beligian sweet-sour mix, fruity to be sure, with a nice mix of malt for a compliment. The hop factor is there, but more as a sub-taste, not to dominating. While sweetness in some batches can be overwhelhming, the stlye the shoot for is distringuisable, and, while not the most maazing beer of the catagory, def, drinkable, and can be good for more then one occasion"
"Pours a nice brownish red. Rusty if you will. Pillowey off white head. Light carbonation throughout, some lacing. This smells quite nice. Smells peppery, bubblegummish, lightly fruity, and bisquity malts. For all the flavor in the smell, not much in the way of taste. Rather subdued. Not bad, but I really thought from smelling it, that it would be much more flavorful. Peppery yeast, with a nice malty backbone, but not much else. Very smooth mouthfeel. Almost velvety. No bite whatsoever. Another strong suit there. And above all, definately drinkable. I'm glad I got a chance to try this beer. Quite a nice one. Wouldn't rush out a buy it, but would pick it up if I had some spare cash."
"on to the ones that made it....dark ruby brown with a quickly disappearing white head. soft sweetish aroma. sugary sweet with a huge phenolic kick. too much. nice mouthfeel, smooth and drinkable. the flavors are all over the place, and tend to go too much to the sweet side, but drinkable nonetheless. not really a dubbel, but still somewhat worthy."
"Thanks to jcalbi for it."
"Overall an enjoyable drink. I think in this brew, the whole is better than the sum of the parts"
"12 oz bottle. Thanks jcalbi! Poured a hazy copper color with a decent head, that slowly receded, and no real lacing. Aroma is sweet and malty. Decent carbonation, not overly fizzy. Taste is sweet, and ends smooth and very clean. I liked this beer, however I don't think it is particularly close to the proper style. overall not a bad beer!"
"This one hides its alcohol very well... in my opinion, a little light for the style, but still a very drinkable offering. A valiant effort, but better representations are out there."
"This is another solid brew from Flying Fish. The color is brown with some amber hues around the edges. The most interesting thing about this beer is the different tastes which mingle together, only to be finished with a strong, pleasant aftertaste. Very pleasing. My head dissipated quickly but since the bottle was jostled a bit before drinking it I'm cutting it some slack."
"This ale pours a deep hazy copper hue under a creamy head with a delicate malt and Belgian yeast aroma. The smooth body supports a malty, fruity, tangy yeast flavor with a bit of latent delicate bitterness. The finish is crisp and clean with a fruity flush leaving a bit of tang on the palate. Very flavorful and balanced brew."
"A good beer, but I've had better. All-in-all another good offering from Flying Fish. But they need more info on their labels and DATES. To clearly state that it is a Bottle Conditioned beer and provide no dates is unacceptable."
"Overall: Lacks a little of the complexity of some of the better Belgian Dubbels - but this is a very solid attempt that has all the right ingredients and one that I enjoyed. Thanks to NeroFiddled for the putting one of these to one side for me."
"Medium brown color. Malty and slightly sweet. Complex flavors, raisins, fruit and spices. Reminiscent of typical Belgian Dubbel, but its not as sweet. Smooth taste. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is malty and slightly sweet. Very nice beer."
"Poured an almost purple color with a cream colored head that kicked up fast, but fell fast and thus created no real lace. Smelled of strong grape scents, musty wood, a small bit of alcohol. Seemed like it was struggling to give whiskey notes. Taste was strongly of grapes, while also starting with moderate sweet, chocolatey malt notes. Middle was reminiscent of cheap red wine, and the finish was creamy. Smooth and easy to drink but too much so. Very easy to throw back, a pounder not a quaffer."
"Pours a dark rust color with a tall and thick white head that slowly dissipates into a sticky lace. Nose is lots of toasted malt and grain with additional notes of some dark fruit. Medium in body with a very smooth texture. Taste starts off with some caramel malt and a touch of candied sugar followed by a roasted nuttiness. Some biting notes of grape skin tannins are present towards the end leaving a very dry finish. A decent stab at the style but nothing special. Thanks to jcalbi for the sample!"
"Light caramel brown, thick head settled to a quarter inch after a few minutes with strong lace. Oddly - seemed to lack any aroma - while it was cold - as it warmed a sweet malty note was evident. The initial sweet taste slowly fades into a slight alcohol warming feeling. Very drinkable - I have to admit the first one went down so quickly I had to open another to verify if it actually had any smell - as it approached around 55 degrees it did release some aroma. This is a fine beer overall - one that makes me miss the Philly/NJ/NY area and all of the beer enjoyment opportunities."
"This beer pours a deep brown color with amber highlights. The cream colored head is intense and thick, and displays excellent retention and good lacing. Strong malty and fruity aromas with just a slight alcohol note. The taste is interesting. Bready, roasted flavors bring to mind sun dried tomato bread with olive oil. This is a very rich tasting brew that has a moderate body. There's a slight sweetness, but it is not dominant at all. A bit of coriander spice meets the hop bitterness on the dry finish. Mouthfeel is good with fine carbonation. Drinkability is very good. This is a really enjoyable beer."
"Aroma and start are sweet and yeasty (ribena and apple skins that have been lying in the sun for a while), some plums, grapes and a touch of nuttyness and caramel. I dig the malts, caramelly, nutty, slightly smoky and roasty, plummy, some grapes, light acidity and tartness. Belgian yeast is obvious, nice dry finish to counter the sweetness in the start. In a wierd way i wasn't expecting too much, but i was pleasantly surprised. I dig the lingering nuttyness in your mouth after every sip."
"Reddish-brown hue, skimpy off-white head, poor retention, no lace. The nose is weak, malty with hints of fruit, spice and alcohol but the aroma is empty and clean, especially for a Belgian-styled beer. Decent palate, rather roasty at first the mesh of spice, alcohol, fruity hints, candy-sweetness and chewy malts work well together. Unfortunately the finish is curt and clean. The mouthfeel is silky smooth and very enjoyable. This is very average beer and rather lackluster for the style. I wont bother with this one again."
"Tastes like a souped up brown ale to me....some nutty characteristics take the forefront along with some roasted maltiness...avery small dry hop finish keeps the maltiness in line....Pours a medium brown with little head...nutty notes are big on the aroma too....body is about medium...slides down very easily and is tasty....a little different than some of the other dubbles I've had but enjoyable none-the-less...Not one that has me doing cartwheeels but a decent brew..."
"Dark amber/ruby in color with a thin, diaphanous head. Aroma is malty, lightly spiced and a bit nutty. Flavor is sweet, nutty, a bit peppery, with a light roasty finish and a mild chocolate aftertaste. Decent flavor, but seems to be missing a certain something -- a bit of spiciness or complexity. Lack of head renders the mouthfeel less creamy than it might have been; as it is the beer feels rather dead in the mouth. Nonetheless, a pretty tasty beer and pretty easy to drink. Would make a decent intro to Belgians for the timid."
"F."
"This beer poured out beautifully. A perfectly clear copper brown color with a big white head. The smell is right on with a nice sourness and spiced fruit character. Pleasant sweetness from the malt. The hops blend well because I can barely detect them ( or much bitterness for that matter ).This is one of the most drinkable beers I have had in this style. Very good and one to look out for."
"Pours a nice, dark brown, slightly reddish highlights. Fairly big head at first, then fades to a 1/4 inch and holds well, with spotty lacing throughout. Nice aroma of dark fruits and roasted malts, some slight coffee. Tastes of plum, maybe raisins, and roasted malts prevail, leaving a nice aftertaste on the tongue. A big, creamy mouthfeel with nice carbonation. Very drinkable, as I had three or four. Personal note, a change in brewers was evident a while ago, then a recent change brought back the trademark taste that made this beer my ""house beer""."
"Drinkability: I had this one for the first time at Mahar's in Albany while working on my beer tour (I was taking a class for three weeks this past summer, and still managed to get my 50 beers for the t-shirt, due to a little sucking up to Bill the bartender). If I hadn't been limited to only one of each type of beer, then I definitely would have had a few more of these. A highly enjoyable easy to drink brew that's worth checking out."
"Taste wise this didn't quite measure up to a true dubbel. A good try it just seemed to be missing something. Maybe a little too thin in body for his style."
"A brown with red highlights body. Head starts out lively and frothy, but very quickly settles into a smooth taple top. Though it states ""bottle conditioned"" on the label, I have no ""floaties", nor any yeast sediment in bottle or glass. Aroma is a lot of yeast, surrounded by some very sweet fruity notes. Taste features some nice deep malt sensation, some candy, then a big splash of alcohol. There is a somewhat unusual aftertaste, which impairs both taste abd drinkability. Overall disappointing."
"Acquired this fine Dubbel via trade. Pours a deep ruby/amber with a thin light beige head (no retention). Minimal lacing. Aroma of malt, and brown sugar toward the end. Flavor was somewhat strong, predominantly malty but with a nut and cherry presence as well. Finish was slightly flat but it did not detract from the beer much at all. I am not an expert on the style but I didn't think this was too bad at all."
"Brown and almond color. Malty and phenol nose with yeast aromas present. A creamy good body. Malty flavor accompanied by a high hop presence. Too much hops for this one. Not an impressive beer. Palatable but not exciting."
"This beer had an almond sort of color to it & medium body, a lot of co2. The aroma was a complex fruitiness as expected. The finish was a bit dry. Overall an average slightly about average Belgian style Dubbel."
"Clear, russet brown with a fair-sized off-white head that's lightly creamy. Although it doesn't hold real well, it does leave a good collar and some light lace. The aroma offers dark fruit, caramel malt and a subtle spiciness. The flavor follows suit with some additional candyish sugariness and more spice. It's very well balanced and the alcohol is nicely cloaked. The body is medium with a very fine carbonation giving it a lightly tingly, creamy mouthfeel. It finishes with a gently lingering sweet maltiness. It's been argued that this beer is too light for the style, but that's not true. It ranks admirably side by side with many Belgians. A very nicely done, and quite enjoyable beer."
"extremely malty with a kick in the pants taste of alcohol. this was damn near undrinkable. i had liked previous belgian-style brews, but this one was just to malty for me."
"Dark Auburn color with a rich grey head.  Very carbonated.  Slightly sweet malt nose and some candi sugar.  Sweet taste with some yeast complexity.  Finish has hints of alcohol dryness.  It also has some smooth mouth and good body to the brew."
"This one just didn't do it for me, it's well made and all, but somthing was lacking in the nose/taste dept. I do like the style, I think when it comes to dubbels, Belgium has it locked up."
"Notes: Not a bad try, a tad too much roasted malt flavour with a close to over kill phenolic character that seems too clean. Say it again, not bad but not close to a real Belgian Dubbel whether abbey or trappist or just from Belgium."
"From the first pour of the deep brown liquid that forms a long-lasting tan head to the last swallow, this beer comes as close to perfection as any American beer I have tried.  Opening the cap reveals a fruity aroma, which is followed by a wonderous first sip.  Both sweet and bitter at the same time, caramel, dates, and biscuit flavors come forward.  The brew finishes long and clean, though a little thin in the mouth.  Biggest drawback is that it does not go well with snack foods."
