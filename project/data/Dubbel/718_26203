Aromas of raisin, prune, caramel, molasses, biscuit, earth, toffee, light cocoa, and light yeast spices. Pretty nice aromas with good balance and complexity; maybe a bit metallic at times. Taste of raisin, caramel, prune, chocolate, molasses, biscuit, earth, toffee, and light yeast spices. Lingering notes of dark fruit, caramel, chocolate, molasses, bread, earth, and yeast spices on the finish for a bit. Good flavor balance and complexity; not as complex as others in the style, but it will do. No cloying flavors at all; slightly dry on the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a fairly creamy and slick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with barely any warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a very good Dubbel.

Head retention and lacing are both barely there... this is one of the less impressive Belgians I've seen. The nose has a little bit of clove, and even less fruit. It's dominated by a rummy, dark sugar sweetness. The flavor brings more of the same, but that sweetness is even a bit more overbearing. There's also a bit of (out of place) bitterness present, and to be honest this beer reminds me more of a cola than a beer. The body is just a touch too full, and the carbonation a little bit dull, but they're both pretty close. I may have to go pick up some Ommegang Abbey Ale or Chimay Rouge soon, because between this and (a soon to be reviewed) St. Vincent's Dubbel, I've had a mini run of the worst dubbels I've ever had.","axeman9182","Sep 22, 2011"

There isn't an amazing amount of depth, which hurt the score because it's not outstanding, but I just wished that I had this at hand forever. It just has the right amount of sugary sweetness, like candy that doesn't make me sick when I overindulge, and there is not a single off-flavor.

3.7,2.2,4,4,3.5,4,3.5,"This is a great Dubbel, but rather different than Trappist Dubbels I have had. I am not sure if the wortiness is true to style but it was very unusual and strangely delicious. I think this is a must try even though it is not a Trappist or Abby Dubbel.","Beeryce","0"
3.14,-13.3,4,2.5,3.5,3,3,"Notes: The metallic smell was hard to get over but where the rubber hits the road this brew holds up well. The petrus line from Bavik has been hit or miss to me and this one is somewhere in the middle. Such a magnificent style that if I had never had a dubbel before I'd be impressed. Since that is not the case this one stacks up to be about average.","DogFood11","Oct 08, 2006"
3.34,-7.7,3.5,2,4,3.5,3.5,"Server on draft in Petrus chalice, the Dubbel was dark brown with a very small white head which quickly dissipated and left no lace. The was no noticeable aroma. The taste is rather pleasant however, one of my favorite Dubbel's. It was sweet, malty and vinous, with notes of toffee and brown sugar and a slight bite, not from the alcohol I think but the minerals. The mouthfeel was rich and a bit syrupy from all the malt, but the complexity from the water and yeast made it relatively drinkable.","ccrida","Oct 03, 2006"

3.97,9.7,3.5,4,4,4,4,"This dubbel pours a medium brown that looks teasingly translucent. Smallish head that fades to a grey dusting. Nose is quite nice -- juicy, fruity and sweet. Candi sugar in the nose, along with some raisins and granny smith apples. Initially acidic on the tongue, with fruit esters of apples coming out. Turns sweet at the mid-palate, with slightly caramelized candi sugar the focus. Dry finish. Mouthfeel is quite varied -- acidic at first, slick next, but never too heavy. Overall, this was a very nice, drinkable Belgian dubbel. Not as heavy as many of the abbey versions, but flavorful and interesting nonetheless.","geexploitation","Aug 26, 2006"

1.75,-51.7,2,2,1.5,2.5,1.5,"What a disgusting beer this is. It's nowhere close to being a dubbel. Way too sweet and obviously flavored with saccharin. Yeast choice is all wrong. A mistake. Stay away. Blech, down the drain this goes.","Mitchster","Jun 21, 2006"
3.76,3.9,4.5,3.5,3.5,4.5,4,"Drinkability & Notes  Not digestible as the Belgians would say, a bit too sweet for me. A nice summer dubbel, relatively light in alcohol with a smooth flavor that lacks the complexity of the archetypes of the style.","OldSock","Jun 16, 2006"

I always enjoy a new taste. It's full flavored and a little spicy with something I can't put my finger on. Mouthfeel is very good and the aftertaste is slightly sour in a good way. I would definetly have more of these.","Erdinger2003","Feb 17, 2006"

3.73,3,4,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"This beer came a very dark amber with slight brown and burgundy highlights. The head was huge, uneven and a dark tan. Smelled of sugary sweet malts and a sweet and mildly tart over ripe fruit. Tasted clean and light with a light malt and candy sweetness that collapses into a powdery dry cherry. The cherry and a dry chocolate nip at the edges of my tongue in the finish. The mouth feel is light to medium bodied with a syrupy feel to it along with a light tingly carbonation.","DarkerTheBetter","Jan 03, 2006"

4.05,11.9,4,4,4,3.5,4.5,"The beer disembarks the 330ml brown bottle a clear deep brown with a perpetual frothy tan head that lingers on, but after its depletion to nothingness, the residual lace forms a tight skirt upon the glass. Nose is musky, hints of caramel with a nice malt sweetness; a fine sniffer to be sure, start is somewhat sweet with a pleasing grain presence, top is fair to middling in its feel. Finish is benignly acidic, the hops present and pleasing, the aftertaste dry and a fine beer to end the evening with.","Gusler","Oct 05, 2005"
4.43,22.4,4.5,4,5,3,4.5,"A dark brown color with loads of foam that just sits there indefinitely. When the head begins to deflate, it leaves behind excellent lacing. Aromas of caramelized sugar, malt, and candy. The taste is refreshing and engaging with a fruit flavor that works into both the sweetness and the bitterness of the beer. A very delicate beer in that all of the textures and flavors collaborate with one another. Impressive beer for its lack of overpowering, dominating characteristics. Very drinkable, especially with a lower ABV for this style. Quite thin in my mouth.","jaluria","Beers"
2.83,-21.8,4,3.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,"BB 14-07-07. Good presentation with nice welllasting thick yellowish head. Clear darkbrown beer make it a good presentation. Nose is dark candy, carramellic malty and a slight hint of roast. Good and full yeastester arome completes this quiet good smell. Taste is far oversweetened, dark candied, carramellic, alcoholic maltjuice. No this is certainly not my taste and for mouthfeel is to say that my mouth shrinked together while drinking this. For people who like it sweet probably highly enjoyable but less to me.","paterlodie","0"
