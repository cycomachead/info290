However, if their winter offering is a 5.83% "Trappist Ale" that nobody will take the time to write anything about, that tells you something.  This may be due to Smutty fans not wanting to badmouth their brewery, which is admirable and understandable.  However, a belgian dubbel for the cold season at 5.83% was a mistake.  They would have been more honest to make a diet cola instead.  What a waste of kettle space.  Yes, session beers are in, but not for the winter, and certainly not belgian dubs.  The caption shows "warming, mellow,pleasantly complex."  Yeah, warming.  Should have been released as a brown ale, a bad one at that.  You have to nail holiday/winter beers.  Did you really think that this would stand out, or didn't you care?  The Monks are crying tonight.  Sorry.","mirp1","Nov 28, 2014"

Yes, a tasty treat during these brutally cold months but still allowing for a Cadillac of a brew. Easy going and flows perfectly.

The malt comes through a lot more in the taste. It finishes semi-dry with some dark cocao and coffee notes, along with a sweet yeastiness to round it all out.

Flavors of deep, dark, old world fruit, including prune and date, with an earthy undertone that keeps the richness in check. Spicing takes a backseat, but is present enough to perk the taste buds out of the sweetness shock by the end of the palate. Sweet and spicy blend on the aftertaste, which is fairly shortlived despite the robust initial flavors. The beer is smooth and round, but the spicing and carbonation does well to keep it light in mouth. Frothy, slightly sweet lingering finish. Very tasty.","GarthDanielson","Dec 18, 2012"

Sweet sugary flavor is highlighted by caramel and sweet reduced fruit syrup. Hints of spice, and Belgian esters, but not to much for my palette.

The taste holds notes of rye bread, light cocoa, light mint, toffee, brown sugar, clove, black pepper, figs, and a bit of red wine.

Malty aroma with some peppery spice and dark fruit notes especially dark cherries. Spicy peppery flavor up front that lingers over the medium malty body into a medicinal cough syrup flavor with some dark fruit notes, mostly cherries, raisin and plum.

Tastes sweet and rich like dark fruit, which for some reason makes it seem more boozy than it is. There's also some smokiness and an eventual bittering hop presence on the back of the tongue. That hop presence is very minimal though. This beer is a malt machine. It seems like some kind of Scottish dopplebock hybrid (Scotchbock?), but it's classified as a dubbel here. Interesting.

It has a smooth, malty flavor with a slight caramel sweetness. The grassy, herbal bitterness is light and doesn't distract. Spice comes late in the taste... like nutmeg and corriander.

Nutmeg, clove and cola, pinch of dark chocolate, white raisin, apple, pear fruit scents, overall the nose has many elements yet remains demure, if not reticent, ends with suggestions of chocolate-filled croissants as well as peat moss. Medium-bodied, the carbonation contributes lift and steadier pacing, right-sized to the whole. The flavors lean towards the sweet side but the beer remains pretty dry. Green apple, white grape, pear and apricot predominate, light glimmer of orange peel. Cocoa powder, malts, cinnamon and clove spice work well to create an affable first half even as hoppier grassiness and pepperiness rises through the finish.

Nice mouthfeel, but somewhat more watery than other dubbels I have sampled, ending with a pleasant malty finish.

The brew has a steely roasted malt base, which has some nutty characteristics. There is also some dark fruit notes that sweeten up the taste. If this is truely a dubbel, it is definitely not as sweet as it's Belgian counterparts. I can't say that I pick up any Belgian candi sugar sweetness. The feel is moderate with moderate carbonation, finishes well balanced. A very enjoyable brew and a good winter brew to try. It is not spiced up like some winters and it is nice and balanced.","Gmann","Dec 09, 2007"

Pours a average looking chestnut brown color, with little head, but a nice looking ring lace around the glass. Smell had brown sugar, chocolate, various spices, and a bit of fruity alcohol. Taste was largely characterized by fruits, mainly plums, cherries, strawberries, with a backbone of malt and chocolate. Mouthfeel is in the middle I would say. Not too much hop usage, but the little that is there helps to balance the malt. This is one of the more drinkable Dubbels I have tasted in a while. If I was to have it in a blind tasting, I would probably guess that this came from Belgium. Another very good beer from Smuttynose.","jamie2dope","Nov 10, 2007"

Aromas of malt and Dutch candy seemed to dominate. The taste was an interesting blend of hops and sweet roasted malts with a malty finish that left behind a bready texture. Different spices seemed to come out as well as the beer warmed, indicated that the spices were present in small quantities or overshadowed by the other ingredients. Either way, not a good thing.

2.43,-33.8,3.5,3,2,3,2,"I like Smuttynose brews, but this one was really disappointing to me. Supposedly a Dubbel, but seems very distantly related. Pours a very dark brown with a thin head. Spiciness dominates the nose. The spices don't seem to go with this beer, and there's an overwhelming bubble gum flavor that just cloys and annoys. Personally, I don't like the taste of bubble gum in my beer. There's also a cloying underlying sweetness, and the taste of the spices and bubble gum linger for an unpleasantly long time on the palate. A pretty poor offering for a winter ale from Smuttynose, and one that I find a chore to drink. There's many better choices to be made, and I'm surprised that Smuttynose chose this beer as their annual offering.","LarryV","Dec 28, 2005"

And that's another thing: the ABV seems to rule the roost with an iron claw, latching on and humbling the flavor and aroma, and seriously minimizing the drinkability.

This is a Dubbel style, made by a good American craft brewery, and it's their take on the style. They're not trying to be, lets say, a trappist, but brew in the style, which I feel a lof of the people I see review miss. Maybe I'm letting Smuttynose off easy, but I applaud the try, and although I have yet to get something outstanding from any of their brews including the Big Beer series, I'm continually impressed with their effort and creativity in their takes on traditional (and non-traditional) beers.","sinistrsam","Dec 17, 2005"

It has a fairly smooth, medium body and tastes Belgian with cloves and spiciness from the phenols along with some grassy and musty characteristics.

Nice herbal qualities in the nose, along with a heaping of winter spices - cinnamon, clove, a touch of caramel. Slightly acidic and bitter, with a flavor profile somewhat reminiscent of Anchor OSA. It's that piney, herbal hop profile. Spicy with a solid layering of hops throughout. Carbonation nips the tip of the tongue before fading into oblivious smoothness. A nice seasonal!

3.25,-11.4,4,4,3,2.5,3,"Smuttynose just hit Milwaukee so I was excited to try this. Not sure what style this was when I bought it, but obviously turned out to be a dubbel. The body is deep chestnut and ruby red with beautiful clarity/ The head was made up of very fine carbonation activity. The wonderful Belgian phenolic aroma was evident as soon as the pour began. Fruity spiciness filled the nostrils quite well. The taste was very "dubbelish" with its dry, semi-sweet maltness. A small amount of hop bitterness shine through. It seemed a bit too spicy even though I doubt any additional winter-type spices were added. The mouthfeel was a little harsh off the start. Although the dryness is always welcome in a dubbel, it seemed a bit cloying. I believe this would be great after a year in the cellar. I will definately save a 6 pack for next winter. Overall, good, but not yet conditioned to its finest.","ALESwhatCURESya","0"

3.95,7.6,4,4,4,3.5,4,"Not knowing this was a dubbel, I poured it into an imperial pint glass. A crystal clear ruby read beer appeared with a huge slightly tan head. Pretty good head retention too, with nearly microscopic bubbles rising throughout the beer, and nice lacing as the head fades. Aroma is belgian spicy esters (coriander and clove, mainly), with a hint of hops (but more hops than one would find in a true Belgian). Not that the hops are out of place - they actually balance out the aroma nicely. Taste is quite complex - some licorice, more cloves, a slightly tart malty middle and a spicy semisweet aftertaste with some bananas and bubblegum mingly with a bit of hoppy bitterness. A slightly slick mouthfeel, leaves a bit of a coating on the tongue. Very tasty brew, and a good take on a spiced winter seasonal that probably contains no actual spices, making it much more subtle (and IMHO) and delicious than some of its more bold cousins (in the winter seasonal category, not the dubbel category).","ColForbin","Nov 05, 2005"
