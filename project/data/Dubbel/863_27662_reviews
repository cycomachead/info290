"benediction is an interesting beer, i was half expecting it to be sour based on the name, but its a thin belgian dubbel, but only loosely. its maple syrup colored and with an inch of off white head, almost nitro looking. the nose is not as belgian yeasty as anticipated, more of a slight banana fruit thing. there is more of a dried rasion thing and some abbey malt in here on the taste, its both sweet and dry, one than the other, but it seems watered down by normal standards for the style in both body and alcohol. its real drinkable, which is cool, but it is also unsatisfying for the same reason. i like to drink these slow and let them warm up and warm me up, this one is a little incapable of the latter. good beer, well made no doubt, but not really satisfying the elements of the style that make it special in my opinion."

"nice abbey style with good yeast.  color is true to fit.  lacing is very nice.  lacks a little on the flavor side but is well made and finishes good.  probably would rather have a better beer but if you like belgian and it's around then go for it."

"Dark brown with a thin beige head. Nose is coffee, cocoa, dark caramel toffee, minimal yeast, earth, milk duds. Palate opens sweet with a bright brown and burnt sugar bitterness and sweetness. Moderately yeasty , moderately spicy. Mildly sweet on the finish. Solid stuff."

"On tap at the brewery. Brown color. Smells sort of yeast, sweet, Belgian. Flavor is a nice dubbel, sweet, yeasty, tasty. this wasn't my favorite at Russian river but I thought it was solid. Nice to be able to try this as I don't think this makes it out to Denver and it certainly isn't bottled."

"Tasty though simple dubbel, enjoyed on tap at the brewpub. Poours Cola brown. Not so yeasty or too sweet. A nice mouthfeel. Characteristics of a dry stout, and featuring licorice. Medium bodied, a little sweetness and bitterness, malt, spice, and a tad fruity."

"Another big tick on my Russian River –tion Quest to try them all! Slowly but surely working my way through some of the stragglers. Big thanks goes out to BilbosNuts for this one! Served from growler into a Green Man snifter (I think I left my –tion glass in Florida at aasher’s wedding ). Opened with a HUGE pop! Poured a deep ruby red brown with a one finger off-white head that subsided to a minimal amount slowly. Maintained excellent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, dark chocolate, dark fruit, smoke, bread, and spices. The flavor was of sweet malt, smoke, fruit, bread, dark fruit, subtle earth, and subtle spice. It had a light feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this was a good brew. There was quite a bit going on in this one that definitely kept me guessing throughout each sip. I went into it based on the style knowing what to expect, but this one actually surprised me slightly. The smoke note carried on throughout the glass which was a very nice touch that brought another level of complexity to my palate that I always love to find. With a nice touch of roastiness going on with dark fruit profile this was definitely one that I’m glad I finally got the chance to try. Hopefully I will get to try the rest eventually. Get on brewing those up for me Russian River. I will be waiting…"
"It poured a caramel amber color with a malty bubblegum banana aroma. Some raisins join the gang once tasted. And that cloying malty aftertaste, appropriate for the style yet … just not my thing."
""
"O: A worthy attempt, but -- while competent -- uninteresting. Perhaps a bit...stale? Flat? Dull? Anyway, I'd drink another, but probably not if I were paying for it."
""
"Eh. Overall, I'm unimpressed. This is a dull example of a dubbel, and even taken on its own without the repertoire of the style to compare it to, it's not that interesting."
""
"O - Sweet and dark. Not overly heavy. Enjoyable but not crazy good."

"I don't normally like Dubbels, but I'm a fan of this one. Some good flavors with a bit of spices mixed in. A Belgian beer is brewed well by RRBC. The sun rises in the morning. I like beer."
"O: Very good dubbel and better than I was expecting. Smooth too and not too sweet. Great spicy, hoppy and fruity flavors. Well done."
"O: Good, not that I would expect anything less from Russian River. However, it's not CRAZY good."

"Draft, Russian River. Pliny the Younger 2010 release. This is a pretty good Belgian-style ale from RR, but it's a bit boring, particularly for the brewery. It's a orange-amber beer with a foamy white head. The malt flavors bring a lot of fruitiness to the beer. There are peaches, apricots, apples, dates and figs. However, despite all that, it has a relatively simple flavor and not enough earthiness or depth. A good beer but not something to go out of your way to try."
"O: Very drinkable!"
"Not bad overall, though don't come looking for authenticity (or slavish adherence to tradition)."
"Notes: While the nose isn't the best, to me this beer is all about flavor and really good balance between sweetness, bitterness and spiciness."
"Pours a clear light brownish into the chimay goblet. Very nice fluffy finger thick head sits atop with some good staying power. Smell is mildly sweet, more on the sugary side than the fruity side as I've noticed in many other dubbels (ie grapes). The taste was a balance between bready and sweet, not too far off in one direction. Super easy to drink if not a taste bud blaster in any way. Mouthfeel was good. Medium or on the heavier side of light. Could drink this baby all night and not have a problem with it."
"Nicely carbonated, fairly light bodied, and a pleasure to drink. I love Belgian style beers in this ABV range since they afford me the opportunity to have several servings. Bottle it already."
"Draught at the brewery. Dark amber with a white head. Lightly yeasty aroma with caramel, and light bubble-gum going on as well. The flavor has a lightly sweet caramel and bready crust malt profile, with light yeasty flavors and a spicy, hoppy, bitter finish. Medium bodied with medium carbonation. The malt, yeast and hop mix is pretty tasty."
"D: Goes down really nicely and smoothly. I'd like to have this again."
"The taste is excellent, fairly assertive yet restrained, well-rounded, balanced, and fairly complex. It is raisiny with stewed caramelised pears, a hint of dried fig, fruity grain, toastiness, a little light red wine, raisiny spiciness and hint of pepper. It has a consistent sweetness balanced with light bitterness and spicey warmth. It has an aftertaste of caramelised toast and fresh plums. The elements are well-integrated and well-rounded, and overall it is smooth and very drinkable."
"overall: This is a great beer by one of the best breweries in the country. they never let me down, and this beer kept with my high expectations. Great job."
"A really solid Dubbel here that was much more hopped-up for the style than I'm used to (but hey, it's Russian River!). The feel and drinkibility are what really made this for me though. Nice stuff!"
"O'Briens TION night. Pours murky brown with lots of carbonation and a thick off-white head. Good lacing. Beautiful sweet brown sugar, candied sugar, and yeast aroma with a subtle fruity background. Very smooth, velvety mouthfeel. Lighter tasting than expected; nice change from the typical syrupy sweet and thick dubbels. Sugared fruit flavors; dates, plums, apples. Solid helping of spice, nutmeg and clove taking the forefront. Big yeasty finish. Tastes almost like a strong dunkelweizen with Belgian characteristics."
"A good drinking beer. Have liked it more than most Dubbels that I have tried."
"Overall, a very drinkable brew and excellent example of an American dubble."
"Drinkability: I will drink this again for sure but I would rather have a rochefort 6."
"Drinkability is good. A pretty nice Dubbel, but this one didn't quite meet the high expectations that it seems to come with every Russian River beer. Still, definitely a solid beverage, that I am not at all upset that I got to try."
"Taste & mouthfeel: Malt forward without being terribly sweet. Detracting and somewhat astringent husky grain flavor that really doesn't fit the style. Yeasty, nice mix of fruit and spice in the background. Dry finish. Not bad, a little underwhelming."
"Amber brown with a small tan head of foam. Aromas of plums, dark candi sugar, various other dark fruits, british christmas cake, and clove, spices, and various yeast tinged esthers of goodness. This is pretty much the best American Dubbel ever made, in fact it may even be THE best dubbel ever made. Taste follows through big time with a blast of yeast flavor, and a great malty roastiness going on in the back that just mixed fantastically with all of the spicy/sweet notes that are dominating the front pallate. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and smooth with very refined carbonation. Drinkability remains phenomenal. Totally killer, I wish they actually brought this one out more often though."
"From my notes on recent trip: poured into a sampling glass, arrived a brownish amber with minimal head. Actually looks flat and dead. Aroma is completely different! Bananas and clove and spices and plum(?) and what a rush. Taste is just as good. Damn I love Dubbels. Again with the clove and banana and plum and malts and just delicious. Smooth mouthfeel yet a little springy on the tongue actually. Would love to drink this all night long, though ya'd get trashed pretty quick, and wouldn't even realize it. Good brew!"
"Drinkability: pretty tasty"
"Served on-tap at Union Jack on the Manatawny. Served in a snifter glass. Presented as a medium amber colored beverage with moderate light brown puffy head. Smell was extremely pleasant, being a nice fruity mixture of bananas and dark fruit with a hint of spiciness. The taste surpassed the smell with the cloviness and the malts being extraordinarily pleasurable. A bit of hoppiness also present. Finishes as smooth as silk with a nice creaminess that is the pwerfect ending to the beer. Very drinkable and very enjoyable."
"The taste is even more impressive than the aroma. I get the banana and clove taste that others have stated they get. This is such a good dubbel that I had to have a few more. It is very drinkable as the sweetness and some hoppy backnotes mix well in your mouth and may for a very enjoyable drinking experience. Well done Russian River, well done."
"Drinkability- Best Dubbel I have had hands down. Best scent and best tasting. Incredible how all those flavors get in there."
"Overall: A nicely done Dubbel. Not quite as complex as some, but immensely drinkable with a fantastic nose. I enjoyed it more the second time around when I tried it on New Years Day in the company of BAs Rapapoda, Watermelonman and his Girlfriend Stacy. Nicely done!"
"The smell had a ton of banana flavor with some malt sweetness. The taste followed that up with solid malt content, esters, and a light hop touch in the finish. The mouthfeel was light but nice, while drinkability is very high."
