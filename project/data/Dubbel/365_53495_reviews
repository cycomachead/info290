"Pours a hazy orange-brown with a foamy beige head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Tiny dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, caramel, dark fruit, and sugar aromas. Taste is much the same with sweet malt and fruit flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of toast bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer with some solid aromas and flavors for an American take on the style."

"Flavor and aroma were nice, brown sugar, dark fruits, a little bit of yeast, and some floral hops. With a good smooth, medium body, I found this beer quite enjoyable and would certainly buy it again."

"Review from 5/2010 notes. Poured into a Gulden Draak tulip. Pours a dark orange brown. Small fine off-white head that dissipated quickly. Aroma of sweet bready malt, dark fruit. Light flavors of caramel malt, light and dark fruit. Very light hop finish. Light to medium bodied. Rather subdued and not too exciting."

"Overall: Another rather clumsy attempt at a Belgian by Pike; I have had some good beers from them but they are way out of their element with Belgians; this beer would be better classified as a somewhat hoppy brown ale - it is certainly drinkable but lacks the complex flavors I would expect in a dubbel"

"Great aroma but the fruit tartness, while nice, seems to take away from the malt. Nothing complex but has an interesting character."
"O- This is not a dubbel. Itâ€™s a hoppy brown ale. Good, but not what I look for in the style."
"O/D - Way too spicy for me. For a Dubbel this doesn't seem to work at all. Yet after some time the fruit and sugar flavours came through more. But still, if I wasn't bored I would have poured this out pretty quick. Off for a dubbel."
"Overall I liked this beer a lot. Sucked it down a little too fast with dinner. I wouldn't say it follows the Belgian dubble style perfectly but it is certainly a good beer."
"There was a strong and unpleasant funky aroma that's unlike anything I have smelled ever. The taste was terrible. I couldn't even comfortably drink a sip without grimacing. It was so bad that the rest of the beer was poured down the drain."

"Taste is candi sugar, dark fruits, caramel and there's a very smooth slightly sweet finish, light carbonation and a fruity finish make is very well done."
"I really like the brewery, but this bottle really didn't hit the spot."
"O: an odd little dubbel. Pike did a pretty good job, though...I suppose."
"Some nice potential here, but the beer came across a little watered-down -- would have been very good with a little more body."
"Overall, I really enjoyed this with a rich chocolate cheescake for dinner."
"On tap at Pike brewery. Pours hazy brown hue with an off-white head and light lacing. Aroma is of dark fruit, caramel, some Belgium yeast and hints of hops. Taste is of brown sugar, dark fruit, caramel and Belgium yeast. Medium, balanced finish. Nicely made dubbel."
"A fairly decent beer all-in-all, it may not be exactly to style but is worth a taste if you want something close to it."
"Pours a deep mahogany brown pretty cloudy with a huge almost out of control head that is lacing quite a bit. Smell is of caramel malt a bit of tastiness and a touch of spice. To me a little on the light side. Taste is of the caramel malt and some dark fruit. Malt may go as far as being slightly roasty. Little if any yeast notes maybe just a touch of ester but it is limited. Mouthfeel is quite lively with only a bit of hop bitterness but enough to balance the slightly sweet finish. Overall not a bad dubbel not my favorite example but it is quite accessible and enjoyable."
"O - Overall a tasty offering and worth taking for a spin. Offers some unique flavours and is quite drinkable. The bitterness that lingers alongside the spices might be a bit much for some people, but I quite enjoyed it."
"Poured this and has the look of Coca-Cola. Heavy brown that is not transparent. Thin head with a film covering. Malts and toffee are noticeable. Flavor is deep with character. Warm alcohol, toffee and an oakiness. A little bit of spiceness. A full bodied ale that is chewy in the mouth. Overall, a good, heavy beer that is worthy of another purchase."
"Opinion: Overall, this is unusual for a Dubbel, that's for sure. It isn't a disgusting beer or anything, and may pass for some version of an American Brown Ale in the aroma, while really just ending up as an estery unbalanced mess in the flavor. I haven't cared for this beer to say the least. I really think that it is just an American Brown Recipe stepped up with some two-row and fermented with Belgian yeast. I have been pretty disappointed with this beer. You would think that if they were going to go through the trouble of putting out a Belgian style beer like this, that they would want to come remotely close to the style. I guess this is a beer brewed for some off-the-wall category in the GABF with no intention of ever holding water to any of the real classic examples of this style. Stay away from this beer if you like Dubbels. If you like hotly/estery fermented American Brown Ales...give this a shot."
"Drinkability - The individual components of this ale were enjoyable but taken together I thought they missed their mark."
"A dark brownish orange. Aroma is biscuity-malt, a little must. Flavor is more rich malt, but not much of that Belgian funk or spice you expect from a Double. There are hints of bakers chocolate and maybe some died fruits, but its more malt and biscuit. Its not a bad beer, it drinks well and can be sessioned. Just not a great example of the style."
"Drinkability: good, and likely to pair well with a variety of foods."
"Reincarnated into a Dubbel, this brew is dark and opaque. The lacing is sufficient enough to resemble a beer. My nose wafts charred wood, medicinal herbs and vague tropical fruit. It is creamy and smooth, with a big body. Unsweetened dark chocolate, highly toasted bread and a thick biscuity layer appear in the finish and really show what the malt is about. Warming fruity alcohol in the middle with an herbal phenol character throughout. Bitterness from the coriander helps to balance this beer. It ends with a bit of burnt, bitter and malty flavor. A pretty good go at the Dubbel style, but a bit Porter-like."
"A decent dubbel, actually drier than the usual offerings from the old country. Nicely spiced, with the yeast kept well in check - good and drinkable, especially as the Yankee Juniors get their asses handed to them in Buffalo, Ontario..."
"D: This beer isn't bad but it really isn't that great either."
"A bit rough. Definitely not on par with the best Belgian dubbels. Thin of body and uneven in flavor...I know Pike can do better, but this was still interesting and satisfying enough that it was worth buying."
"Drinkability: this is not a bad beer, but I think it falls short compared to a lot of other dubbels. I'm going to finish this bottle without complaint, but I won't seek this beer out again."
"Picked up this bomber at TW, it wasn't thrown to to me like a big fat salmon, but that's ok, if I would have dropped it, I wouldn't get to review it! Ok then, let's give it a whirl. Popping the top I get a huge malt smell, not many hops, mostly fruity esters, banana mostly, and backbone. Poured into a 20 ounce chalice, the brew is a barely translucent dark red with a light tan head that dissipates quickly. Lacing is great, for this ABV, I would think so. On the taste, the big belt of malt continues, big backbone, some cloves come through, with some late caramel and still later pumpkin. The mouthfeel is excellent, good carbonation and viscosity a hint before syrup. This is a beer my friends, and for the price, it's a weener."
"Aroma is not strong, but fruity with an undertone of malt and a hint of caramel. It pours a nice dark translucent mahogany with a fairly thick, fine-bubbled, pale tan head that sticks around and leaves a fair amount of lacing. Flavor is fruity and malty with caramel and nutty hints and a whisper of sweetness. Texture is smooth but just a little fizzy, not particularly distinguished. Worthy of at least a try."
"Tandem is supposed to be an abbey dubbel, but it doesn't really do a good job. There are the raisin, jammy flavors, and some orange, but it doesn't quite have the spicy clove, intense fruitiness and overall impact that good dubbels have. The aroma is a lacking the complexity and caramel malts, but appearance is fine and the mouthfeel good."
"Not a style I go to often but I like the Pike stuff I have had to date.Poured into a goblet a slight hazed russet brown with a thinner quick to fade off white head.Dark fruit and phenolic spice are the main components in the aromas,slight sweetness from the alcohol as well after the beer warms alittle.Big dark fruit flavors,raisin and fig like others have notes are the domianate flavors,some phenolic clove-like spice and even a hint of smoke.A little prickly at first in the mouth but it settles down after a bit,its not bad but not anything to go search out in my opinion."
"- Overall a very interesting brew.. drinkable... but just blah... not something I would probably buy again."
"D- Belgian-style Dubbels are one of my favorite beer styles so I always get excited to try one I haven't before. This one was a letdown. Not horrible, but it does not hold a candle to some of the top beers within the style."
"Taste is woody-clove fruitness, hint of toasty grain and sweet wine, slightly on the sweet side but pretty balanced. The flavours, though not too complex, hold up well and it is a lot more flaovurful and complex than quite a few abbeys that I've have had, far too many seeming rather one-dimensional."
"This guy pours a dark ruby brown topped by a couple layers of light tan foam. The nose comprises rye bread, brown sugar-cinnamon, light red grapes, and a touch of orange flesh. The taste is nearly identical, with a bit more rye bread, a dash of pepper, and a smattering of greens. The body is a fair medium, with a light carbonation and a smooth feel. Overall, a decent dubbel, nothing special, but a nice, tasty, inexpensive option."
"Pours deep opaque brown with a dense off white head. The aroma is malty and the flavor is more porterlike than anything. Roasted, chicory, unsubtle. There is a flatness on the finish. The label promises coriander, but I don't see it. The mouthfeel is prickly."
"Fairly easy drinking and s nice attempt at the style. Worth trying."
"Mouthfeel is thin and relatively light. Drinkable, but not impressive."
"Very drinkable for a double, would pair well with food, particularly cheese."
"Pours a cloudy mahogany with a thin tan head that retains OK, not really impressive on this front but few dubbels are. The aroma has a bunch of dark fruits upfront (notes of black cherry, raisin, plum, date) along with a little chocolate, some caramel and toffee, yeasty esters, and a little alcohol. The flavor also has big dark fruit notes intially (raisin, plum, pomegranate), along with some chocolate, molasses, toffee, funky yeast, burnt bread and some alcohol The mouthfeel is moderate and drinkability is good. A decent stab at a dubbel, but lacking the complexity of the best iterations of the style."
"mouthfeel is actually luscious yet at the same time seems thin, watery (in the finish)...visible carbonation is low as is the sense. sort of wish it was more crisp, but that could get in the way of all the other fine points of the taste....nonetheless, QUITE drinkable and quaffable...recommended for year-round celebration and rehydratiion rituals."
"The body was nicely full and well-rounded. Drinkability was very good. I've had a lot of these on tap and enjoyed all of them. Overall, a nice little take on the style. Worth trying when you see it."
"Pike Brewing Company--Pike Tandem Double Ale. 7.00% ABV. 24 IBU's. Clear bright brown color. Toasted Belgian raisin fruit front. Creamy mild sweet brown ale fruit ester body. Mild hop sweet Dubbel end. Mellow Belgian Brown. (3.5 / 5.0) 5 oz. Taster @ Seattle, WA Pike Pub & Brewery 5/9/2010."
"Pours a mostly clear dark reddish brown with thin offwhite head, spotty lace. Smell: sweet, a little brown sugar but mostly nondescript and grainy...why do I smell a lot of pale malt?, light banana and pear, spice. Smells like a dark tripel. Taste: again sweet, caramel - overcarmelized, spicy, pear, import graininess (ehh?). Mouthfeel: way undercarbonated for the style and a little thin as well. The local giant liquor store was pushing Pike with prime shelf space and ads, but Pike has done nothing well here."
"D: This was an OK beer, but not a great example of the style. It had a boring scent and taste, and weak body. It was easy enough to drink, but it just wasn't rewarding."
"Serving type: bottle"
"Drinkability: While far from being a dumpy dubbel, it just lacks the vibrant maltiness and subtle complexities of its betters. Still, at a modest $3.99 per bomber, I'd say it's worth a go."
"Drinkability: Very flavorful and drinkable for a dubbel; mild and balanced"
"Drinkability: decent beer, but I would probably not try again."
"D= This was a really enjoyable dubbel. Other than Westmalle and a few other classic examples I have never been a big fan of this style. I could and would drink this one all the time if I lived in Seattle though."
"Poured a deep chestnutt color with low carbonation and a very small dirty white head. Nose is belgian yeast with candy sugar, dark fruiits and light boze. Taste is fig, raisin, plum and candy sugar half way through but the beginning is pretty flat. I did find some blackberry, maybe even green apple and orange peel.I got soome booze and maybe even a grape juice/grape soda flavor on the end. Mouthfeel is booze, sticky and flat. Not appealing."
"Half-finger of very light tan head, pretty quick dissipation with a thin layer of head retained. Clear brown body with some purple highlights, visible carbonation rising from bottom of glass. The Belgian yeast is quite prominent in the nose, dry bready malts, hops are well hidden. Pretty sweet taste profile, dark treacle, figs, pears, a hint of smoke and leather. Nice carbonated mouthfeel and a fairly dry finish. Not too heavy, pretty drinkable."
"Overall this was a pleasant surprise - a solid version of a spiced dubbel. Well worth a shot."
"The flavor has a pretty nice hop presence, a touch tropical and a bit piney but the caramel maltiness lacks any kind of creaminess or depth. The flavor is not bad by any means, but it feels a bit watery and just generally not very inspiring. One nice thing about this beer though is that it is very drinkable and hides the ABV well. Maybe the sum is greater than the parts on this beer because my glass emptied pretty fast!"
"A good Dubbel. One of my favorite styles, and Pike does it right. Something I would recommend."
"Tandem isn't long on assertiveness or sustain. A quick bite of vanilla cream cake easily overtook the beer for flavor. But Tandem is still worth the ride."
