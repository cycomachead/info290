"Dark brown pour, with a large off-white head that retained nicely and coated the glass with lace. Mild aroma of bready yeast and caramel malts. Taste was very bland up front, cardboardy malts, yeast, light herbal hop notes, no real sweetness or estery qualities that I like in the style; it was really just pretty lacking in taste, though benign and mostly non-offensive. Could've just been that the bottle was past its prime, but I don't see why a beer like this couldn't hold up a year or two in the cellar. Medium body, moderate carbonation. Pretty average overall, not very tasty, but not undrinkable."

"overall - a very good dubbel that stands up to the Belgian originals."
""

"Overall: an interesting dubbel. I prefer it to your over-caramel or over-biscuity dubbels, but the alcoholic and phenolic characters are just a little bit overcharged."
""
"Overall, a nice brew. I actually enjoyed the sour/funk but not very representative of what we all know as a dubbel...Im thinking this is most likley what a dubbel used to taste like centuries ago. Although it pains me to say this, but its a good brew."
""

"Goes well with garlic olives for no particular reason."
""
"O: I've heard some good things about this one and I've heard some bad. However, I'm throwing all that shit out the window by saying ""I dig it, and will stand by that!"""
""
"Overall I really did not like this. Too much yeast induced spiciness and yeasty esters overpowering the fruity date malt profile."
"O: An interesting and unique dubbel. Not bad by any means, though a little unusual for the style."
""
"O - Kind of a let down. Appearance wise it looks excellent, and the aroma was rather impressive for an American brewed dubbel...but the flavors and mouth feel just fell flat. Watery, thin, unbalanced flavors, and a harsh aftertaste."
""
""
"The pour is amber in color with a huge off-white head. The aroma is overwhelmingly heavy on the grape. Very vinous and fruit with some sweet toffee and bready malt. The flavor is perhaps even moreso than the aroma. This also has a touch of lactic tartness (which I think is probably unintentional). Not really all that dubbel-like."
""
""
"O-Not sure if the funk is suppose to be there, but the mesh of flavors isn't where it should be."
""
""
""
"An easy and unexpected beer given the flavor combination. While I am not sure this fits the dubbel style, it was well enjoyed while watching the Super Bowl."

"If this were a Sour style I'd rate this much higher. As it is the look and feel are the only reason the crack the bottle."
""
""
""
"Not a bad beer at all but not a winner in the dubbel category --- missing the characteristic depth, dark candi sugars and yeasty roundness."

"Captain Lawrence St. Vincent's Dubbel pours a very dark and deep purple, with very faint ruby highlights. There's about a finger of tan foam sitting atop the beer, and its dissipation is a slow one. Lacing is essentially nonexistent though. The nose is surprisingly buttery. There are some plum and clove present, but they are by far secondary aromas. The flavor brings more of the same. If anything, there's more of a buttery, toffee presence than in the nose. It tastes like a bunch of English brown ale got poured into my dubbel. Once again the dark fruit and spicy phenol notes can be found, but they are a bit tough to appreciate underneath all the sweetness. The mouthfeel is a touch rich, but the carbonation is nice and bubbly. It's not that I didn't enjoy what was in my glass, it's just that I ordered a beer called St. Vincent's Dubbel, and what I got isn't much of a dubbel."
"O: 3.5"
"750 ml bottle into tulip, no bottle date. Pours nice hazy reddish orange color with a fairly dense 2 finger khaki head with amazing retention that reduces to a thick lacing cap. Some bits of lacing cling to the glass as well. Tons of carbonation streaming up from the bottom of the glass. Aromas of huge grape juice, raisin, molasses, caramel, chocolate, nuttiness, and spices. Huge aromas here I could smell as soon as I poured it. Nice stuff. Taste of big white grape, caramel, toasted malt, pepper, spices, bread, and molasses up front; with some chocolate and nutty notes near the finish. A slight bit of tartness in the back adds a different aspect to this, with lingering notes of chocolate, nuttiness, spices, molasses, and caramel. Finish is excellent, not too dry, leaving a nice amount of linger flavors. Nice balance of flavors as well. Alcohol is nicely hidden with none noticed except for a small warming on the finish. Great drinkability. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a nice and creamy mouthfeel. Overall this is definitely an outstanding dubbel with tons of flavor and great balance. This improved a lot as it warmed up."
"on tap at the Dutch into a chalice. amber hue short off white head with average retention, light lacing cap. scent is clean if not boring. taste is slight clove, dark fruits, hint of booze. medium bodied and warming. not a bad dubbel, would not consider this a benchmark by any means."
"Lighter body good carbonation. Alcohol well hidden. Enjoyable"
"This is a damn good beer. Not had many from the Cap that aren't though. Milk chocolate throughout, with nutty flavors on the finish, fresh baked raisin bread, fig, prune, plum, dark malts, yeasty with some spicy flavors. Red currant, and more. Complex, juicy, yet feminine and sexy. A great american dubbel."
"O: This is a great beer, but not very close to style. Maybe a little closer to a Flanders Oud Bruin. Drank too cold, this beer will not come off as malty. Would recommend this to anyone who loves Belgians."
"Not much more I can add to it. Very good, among the better Dubbels in my opinion."
"overall a great complex brew will have to check out more of the captain larry for sure seems like realy craft brews for sure"
"A pretty tasty beer that gets better as it warms, with dark fruit and caramel coming out as it fades. Worth a try, as I need to have this again to get a better feel for it and really appreciate this creation."
"A decent, stylized take on the style, would buy this again if available"
"Overall: It drinks nicely but seems a bit off for the style. A person who likes dubbels may enjoy this or they may feel it misses for style. I enjoyed it but not enough to buy a bottle."
"Has elements of an old ale in addition to a dubbel - which makes this an unusual (and some will say unpleasant) example of the style - one that doesn't stand up to it's Belgian predecessors."
"D: capt lawrence was due for a dissapointment, I loved their nor'easter, 5 year, and extra gold, but this one is not so good. I'm visiting this brewery soon enough and will try this beer again I'm wondering if I just got a bad bottle."
"The palate is a bit of a strange beast. Opening fruity, tart and vinous, there's a suggestion of an accidental inoculation of souring culture, with a blend of lactic sourness and a very earthy, leathery Brett character. This renders the fruity and the malt character secondary, but it also does help in drying this beer out. There's a definite plum character, as well as a blend of spices with anise and a little black cardamom, there's also a very nice flavor of toffee, cocoa and burnt sugar. Drying and tart with a little bit of leather and spice on the finish, this is quite enjoyable. Light in body and excessively carbonated, this is highly unusual for the style, but still, very enjoyable as a beer, especially when colder. As it warms up, it does grow increasingly disjointed, but I am going easy on my scores here."
"Overall I love this offering from the Cpt. They have yet to let me down even with a little higher price. I will continue to buy this and age this beer on a regular basis."
"Thanks to ShogoKawada for this gem."
"Body is fairly full with low to moderate carbonation. Drinkability was on the low end of the spectrum for me, I just couldn't get past that strange sour flavor. I would like to try one again in the future to see if those flavors are still there."
"Perhaps this was a bad bottle, I had it once before and don't remember the extreme sourness I had in this bottle. In addition, Captain Lawrence usually nails their beers...this is off target."
"Poured into a tulip. Appearance is amber-brown with a light head and some mild lacing with staying power. Nose is dark fruits, toast, and a bit of spicing. The flavor is malty with some dark drugs and yeast. Good body with nice carbonation and a touch of heat. Drinkability is good, though I could have used a bit more complexity."
"D - Slightly above average but would not recommend it."
"Edit: It tastes a hell of a lot better with the yeast mixed in, but the bottle didn't state to do that, so the scores stand."
"All that being said, it is a fairly drinkable dubbel. It's just on the lighter more simple side of the spectrum."
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied and carbonation is moderate. Drinkability is pretty good, it's a very nice Dubbel with some very good malty flavors to it along with the Belgian yeast flavors. Very nice beer overall to enjoy on this Sunday afternoon."
"Full bodied with a lot of dark roasted maltiness balanced by some plum/raisin dark fruit notes, chocolate, spicy and alcohol heat. Nice balance of sweetness from the dark fruit and dry finish. Pretty drinkable."
"D: It's not as drinkable compared to other dubbels given the amount of hop flavors. You really need to warm this beer up."
"(D)- Probably would be much better if there wasnt so much sediment, but it was still a gentle pour. Showed some promise though."
"D - The alcohol is a bit noticeable after the half-glass and unfortunately the sediment off-sets the rest of the dubbel being good. It's still got potential and decent drinkability."
"Pours a golden orange with a large head that fades quickly but leaves some nice legs. The nose is mostly malt with some sweetness and yeast. Slightly metallic, mostly malty with a little fruit and even less spicy yeast. Mouthfeel and body are fine. Not overly impressed."
"Above average drinkability. Overall this is decent, but not one of Captain Lawrence's better offerings. At least it wasn't infected though."
"D - A very drinkable dubbel with a hoppy undertone. I prefer darker dubbels, but this would be great for a fan of the hoppier beers."
"Full body on this and carries a high amount of carbonation on the tongue as most Belgian styles do. Flavors of roasted apples, other dark fruits, and rounded out with a slight yeasty twang on the finish. This was a pretty good Dubbel. Not my favorite style, but this was a treat."
"A: Thick frothy head that is dropping precipitously to leave a rocky layer on top, the color is primarily an opaque brown with a hint of ruby, what appears to be decent lacing along the edge of the glass - 4.25, S: Strong spice aromas as well as a sweet caramel that reminds me of a tootsie roll, quite toasty and nutty, possibly some prune juice flavors in the depths of this beer, all around a very inviting nose - 4.50, T: Rich and malty, dark pitted fruits step up to the plate providing a date like sweetness, Belgian yeast is obvious as is the candied sugar, quite dry and with a slight warming from a solid 8.0% ABV, mildly hopped - 4.00, M: A touch on the side of chewy - 3.50, D: A very nice and drinkable dubbel - 3.50"
"Pours brown with an off-white head. Aroma is fruit and Belgian yeast with a little bit of tartness. Flavor is caramel malt and dark fruit. You get a little bit of tart fruit in the flavor as well as some Belgian yeast characters that you expect in a dubbel. Medium body and medium carbonation."
"A nice dubbel though not great."
"F: Finishes drier than I thought. The freshening warming alcohol feel doesn't fade quickly. Theres a slight fruity linger, mostly raisin. A slightly sticky feel also stays. The spicy yeast and most of the malts and fruits seem to fade quickly. It also lingers with a slight alcohol boozy flavor. Its a nice dubbel, a little on the boozy side for only being 8%, and a little on earthy farmhouse style."
"D: I drank one glass and poured the rest. Not very good."
"Overall not real sure what to make of this, I wanted to like it but it just did not seem to hold up well for me. I am a huge fan of the brewery and this is really the only thing I have no liked."
"Split the bottle, and it was plenty for both of us."
"Pours an orangish brown with a silky tan head. Nose has figs, plums, cherries, toffee, bready malts, cloves and peppery yeast. Taste is not quite as nutty and earthy as I like to see. Mostly ripe pitted fruitsfollowed dark candy, cocoa and spicy Belgian yeast. Medium body is a bit over carbonated, but settles down nicely as this opens up. Another fine ale from Captain Lawrence."
"A pretty straight forward and enjoyable Dubbel."
"this is probably the best version of SVD to date. still, it can't hold a candle to the trappists, but it's leaning in a more traditional and even handed direction."
"Overall, an interesting take on the style and enjoyable."
"Thanks to RomanW70 for bringing this one to the Sunday night tasting. Poured a hazy/cloudy caramel with a head that quickly dissipates into a thin slick. Nose reveals hops, nutmeg, coriander and a peppery quality. Taste consistent with nose; however, some chocolate, prunes and an earthy quality comes out, with hops bittering at the finish. Mouthfeel was medium-bodied, fizzy/prickly - too much carbonation on this one. Really nice complexity in this beer. Definitely improves as the carbonation levels subside and the brew warms."
"D- I drank the two snifter glasses in no time at all. The alcohol got to be a bit much during the second glass with the increased warming but the dark fruit action also increased putting a smile on my face. This was my 1st time with this brew and I think two years in the bottle will do this dubbel justice, even though it's real nice right now. For a style I don't actively seek out, this one is worth repeat purchases."
"Thanks to my wife for bringing a bottle home from a trip. The beer is a dark reddish-brown color with a thick and foamy light beige head that recedes slowly. Slick, patchy lacing on the glass. The aroma consists of malt, ripe fruit and yeast with some spices. Medium body with flavors of malt, dark fruit and yeast along with some hops. The finish is smooth and fruity with a mild spice and yeast aftertaste. Pretty good overall."
"D: A fantastic beer! Very balanced. Not as sweet and a tad drier than other Dubbels but it made up for it in many other ways."
"Out of a 750ml capped bottle. Pours a ruby brown color with a nice puffy tan head that settles into a nice cap. The aroma is sweet with candi sugar, and a bit metallic or rusty from the dark belgian malt. The flavor is a nice mix of belgian candi sugar, a slightly nutty toasted malt and some raisin/fig fruitiness. Everything is in balance, one of the better dubbels that I have had in a long while. A moderate body with very fizzy carbonation, starts off sweet but actually finishes dry. One of the better dubbels that I have had, either US or Belgian. Seems to hit the style head on. This is very nice."
"Growler from Bellport Beer & Soda (2009 batch). Pours a deep cloudy brown with no head. Aroma of Belgian yeast, spices (allspice, pepper, cinnamon, clove), and light roasted malt. Flavor of sweet malt and yeast with a roasty, spicy finish. Some smoked/charred malt notes too. From my recollection of last year's batch, this doesn't seem as complex. It's a touch sweet and weaker in the palate. Maybe it's the tap vs. bottle difference, I dunno, but I'm not loving it as much as I did last year."
"D- Alcohol is detectable in the taste but its not off putting. There is not much after taste, but the sweetness and stickiness bring down the drinkability slightly."
"""Bug spray."""
"Drinkability- As someone who's definitely not the biggest fan of the style I really enjoyed this brew quite a bit. The part that I hate is the sweetness and somehow this brew still retains its Dubbel quality. Just an all around enjoyable beer from an even better brewery. Thanks much Dan!!"
"Pours a pretty clear dark orange/brown, some reddish highlights, pretty cool colour, thick and big bubbles off white head, very active bubbles continuously rise to the surface, some lace spots, keeps a thick layer. Smell is interesting, lots of apple, some brown sugar/caramel sweetness, pears, lightly yeasty, some biscuit, apple juice, apricots, very fruity, pretty cool. Taste is weird, lots of apple and pear, juice, some caramel sweetness, lots of toast and biscuit, yeast, alcohol, some sour oakiness, pretty interesting. Mouthfeel is light bodied with high carbonation, a bit thin in the mouth and the carbonation is a bit tough to take. Kind of thin and lightly sour, but I didn't mind drinking it. Thanks Dyan!"
"Pours a deep brown, with a red hint to it. Large, dense tan head resting atop. A sweet malt smell with the definitive Belgian yeast providing a dark fruit hint. I can't quite put my finger on it, but there is a bit of an alcohol or tartness to the smell. This carried through in the flavor, as well. A rich caramel sweetness upfront that is followed by that tart back end. Maybe I want to say a spicy finish to it, because the alcohol is not so high to cause that sensation in my mouth. A bit tart as it rests in your mouth, that spiciness, I guess you could say. There is a nice warming effect as you enjoy it. Definitely a nice sipping beer, with a few different things going on in it. The alcohol may be a little too apparent for my taste."
"Overall a tasty brew, happy to have tried it."
"My only complaint is that it started to get a bit cloying by the end. Still a decent beer."
"Drinkability: This was an interesting, strange brew. It almost tastes like it was Bretted, though that can't possibly be the case ... can it? Either way, it's a dry, quenching, spicy, fruity dubbel, and I sort of kind of maybe like it. So, yes, I'm gonna recommend it, though be wary of the barnyarditude!"
"M + D: Moderate carbonation, heavier body... though it has a dryness that I can go for. The funk flavours a re a little much for me... I thought I would love it, but can't say I do quite as much as some others. Still worth trying out, and I'd be interested in more."
"There's a definite dopplebock characteristic to this one as well, almost like a dubbel-bock. Clean where it should be spicy, licorice where there should be yeasty. Very interesting and different take on an abbey dubbel."
"Poured into a chalice a very nice golden amber color, very nice carbonation, with a very nice thick creamy two-finger off-white head, tons of very nice thick creamy sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, with some yeast, dark fruits. The taste is sweet, malty, some yeast notes, nice touch of figs, raisins, and plums. Medium body, this is a pretty tasty brew. Very drinkable, I like this one."
"D-I love Belgians, but the Dubbel is one style from the Belgian line up that I have not found and example that I could drink over and over again. This is that example. This is an excellent Dubbel (though the ABV is a bit higher than expected) and is everything that I find ""good"" in that brew. Very well done by Captain Lawrence and I am looking forward to trying more brews from this great brewing Co."
"The body is moderate. A bit sweet with a somewhat under attenuated feel. Carbonation is a bit low for style but ok. Overall, a little disappointing. Some off notes and big phenolics really distract."
"This is a top notch brew, and a great surprise because I usually find dubbels to be so uninspiring. Loads of flavor here, though, and definitely a beer worth seeking out."
"Notes from 11/23/06"
"D- This beer has nice complexity with a big alcohol heat that would be better after some age. It is pretty dry for a double but has big good malt flavors coming through which is a nice change."
"Nice pale chocolate looking beer with a fluffy off white head on top. Moderate amount of funk and yeast in the aroma-dried fruits come to mind. Good, solid malty flavor with a decent yeasty and fruity flavor to go with. Ever so slight spicyness to it. Finish is rather sweet. Good mouthfeel. Very good beer overall-my first from Captain Lawrence-I look forward to more."
"D_Yet another nice brew from the Captain. I am not really sure why I sat on this for so long, but I did. The aging might have done it well as it most likely toned down the alcohol which can be felt yet is not distracting."
"D- The bottle went down very smooth"
"Tried this one recently based on the reviews. Served in my Chimmay chalice. Unfortunately, it just didn't live up to the hype. I was hoping to find a home brewed (Cap't Lawrence is about 15 miles away) Belgium that I would really enjoy but I was disappointed. Flavor wise it was close but something was missing - it really didn't have that rich, deep taste a true Belgim dubbel has."
"D-Hit the spot. If it weren't such a large bottle (1.9L), it would be very drinkable. Nonetheless, quality beer."
"Pours a dark bown with a nice thick lighter tan head. Nose is yeast, dough, spices, sugars and fruits (got some figs up in here). Flavor is full. Nice earthy tones. Smooth sweetness and a nice level of figs and matured fruits. A bit hot with the booze, but it doesn't matter so much. Nice feel and nice to drink. A pretty tasty American version of a Belgian style."
"Drinkability: This is one of the most drinkable Dubbels I've had so far. Even though you can taste a little alcohol, that's not going to stop you from drinking an entire bottle of this fine brew. It didn't stop me. Another winner from Captain Lawrence! It's pricy, but well worth every cent."
"Another lovely drinking Belgium from this brewery. Yeasty and malty aroma. Full bannana consistency mouthfeel. Sweet whipped up maltiness,carmel, sugar with building waves of moderate bitterness. Fruity, but that's only a hint.A it softer carbonation would be welcome."
"D: Extremely drinkable and I think it would be even moreso with some age on it. Another good one from CL."
"Another winner from Captain Lawrence."
"Very nice - highly recommended."
"D- This one's complex & meant to be enjoyed."
"D: Very drinkable but it took me quite a while to get through my share. The abv is low by big beer standards but the flavor is right up there. I love when breweries can get this massive taste out of lower ABV beers. Scott has struck gold again. Maybe it was the year this bottle had on it but it really surprised me at how good it was."
"As a side note, one thing I really liked about this beer is the fact that as it warms up, a more noticeable smoky flavor becomes gradually apparent..."
"D: A borderline good dubbel but falls short in some aspects per style and when compared to their other beers."
"St. Vincent's Dubbel is a real disappointment from Captain Lawrence. Everything else I've sampled from them has been top notch. Unfortunately, this offering falls far short."
"Bottom line: A very tasty Dubbel that grew on me during the session so I'd put it firmly in the ""I'd drink it again"" category."
"Very tasty and drinkable, but some cocoa notes would add some depth."
"Drinkability: excellent version everyone should get their hands on. Easy to drink and more than one bottle can be consumed in a session."
"Bottle: Poured a medium brown color ale with a big foamy head with some good retention and some lacing. Aroma consist of sweet Belgian malt with some dry fruits characteristics such as dry figs and plums. Taste of sweet Belgian malt with some notes of dry fruits characteristics. Body is full with a creamy texture and some pretty good carbonation. I thought this was a bit too boozy overall to really enjoy on a regular basis thought."
"Pours a dark orange rusty amber color, slightly hazy and effervescent with a big foamy head that resists fading. Solid sheets of lacing in its wake. An aggressive dark fruit and sweet earthy aroma highlighted with a spicy coriander character. Well carbonated, the tongue immediately becomes preoccupied with a spicy tingle and sense of the alcohol. For me, most of the flavor was sensed in the back and with the swallow and finishing breath. Quite a bit more spicy than fruity, but the flavor does linger well giving it a lot to consider. A heck of a lot more to this one than the Interlude that i just poured out."
"Rich and flavor and pretty intense, this is a nice warming sipping brew that hits the style well enough."
"Drinkability: I usually can go either way with dubbels, but I can't help but find Saint Vincent's Dubbel to be pretty likeable!"
"This is quite tasty, it has quite a bit more darker grain notes in it than is typical (especially towards the finish), but these notes mostly add another dimension to this brew. While the aroma is not overly so, the flavor definitely has some heavy spiciness to it (though I wouldn't guess this is anything more than fermentation character). Fairly rich tasting, yet the overall experience of this beer remains surprisingly light. Either Dubbels are finally beginning to grow on me (Dubbels have been one of the few Belgian Styles I have not really been exited about), or this is just enough different from the typical example that I am really enjoying this right now."
"The beer pours a dark amber color with a thick frothy offwhite head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a smooth, burnt toffee scent along with a light yeast fruitiness. It's warm with a wonderful malt aroma. The taste is good as well. It has a sweet, malty flavor that boasts of roasted and caramel malts. It goes down easy and finishes dry with a nice warming effect. There is a mild yeast fruitiness that blends well with the crystal malts. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a delicious beer. It's warm and malty with just the right amount of yeast esters."
"This is a great Dubbel. The best American Dubbel I have had in years. Very smooth and easy drinking. Highly recommended."
"not bad.. but not for me."
"This offering from Captain Lawrence pours an unfiltered dark brown beauty. The nose is dark ripened pitted fruit (Plums, Raisins, Prunes) with a brown sugar sweetness followed by just a slight hoppy bitterness of tart unripened fruit as suppose to citrus to help balance the malty sweetness. The finish is a bit rough, at 8% it is not too hot and the overall mouthfeel is young and a bit raw for a dubbel. I think age would do this Dubbel some good but it is still a nice sipper."
"I should note that the bottle cap on my bottle just came off too easy and that I would have preferred a cork or a twist off for securing the beer."
"Side note: My wife, whose favorite beers are witbiers and weisbiers, made a this is disgusting face after trying it."
"Poured into a heavy glass chalice, formed a skim of beige head above the slightly cloudy brownish burgundy brew. Head is quickly down to just an uneven layer of bubbles, with limited delicate lace. Aroma is boozy malt sweetness. Taste is hearty grain flavors upfront, seguing nicely into the dark fruity sweetness in the middle, and then alcohol warmth turns on the afterburners. Mouthfeel is smooth, but a little lacking the carbonation area, and drinkability is somewhat limited by the alcohol, which seems to feel stronger than the advertised 8%abv. Actually had a little bit of gum numbness going for a bit. Nonetheless, and nice brew, and glad I got to enjoy it."
"Taste: Carbonation felt a little too lively, but it actually worked out well as it mingled with the alcohol that tingled my face all the way to my nose, like drinking sparkling wine too fast. Solid malt presence, but had a touch of ash in the end that spoils the sweetness in the end. Still, a good Beer in a style where I'm sort of hard to please."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, yeasty, with cocoa clinging to the semi-dry palate. As one of my favorite styles, this one hit the spot."
"Very, very nice. The 8% is evident, but also enjoyed."
"Interesting. Warming. Not really too unlike Chimay Premiere in a way but bigger. Very nice."
"This is the latest, just released selection from the ""captain", large champagne style bottle, label lets you know this was ""bottled in 2006"" Pours dark auburn, cloudy, murky, with a typical mocha head, with moderate retention, leaves fine, scattered lacing and delicate sheeting to boot. Nose is softly of toffee and abit of musty funk is picked up. This is a smooth, tasty and well crafted Belgian Dubbel style ale. Rich notes of more toffee, rum, raisins, smokey chocolate. Complex flavors and sensations entice the senses, soft and inviting mouthfeel, with a nice warming alcohol feel in the finish. Scott does not miss a beat and this is an instant favorite. Go get some...bottles are gonna be available at fine area retailers and, of course at the brewery."
