"A solid, dark, chocolate-banana dubbel that's very drinkable but, nevertheless, not expressly exciting.  A sharp, bitter thickness appends the expected deep-brown sweetness, but beyond some banana esters there isn't a lot going o with the flavors of this beer.  And yet: it's damn solid.  Indeed, for a dubbel, it's downright fairly sessionableâ€”particularly since its mouthfeel isn't too sticky (for its genre).  All in all: not incredible, but credibly constructed to a decent number of steps above tolerable."

"Nutty bordering on roasty with the typical dark fruit character. Touch of hop bitterness."

"I have had better and the alcohol is a bit more present than I would like but this is a solid and well brewed beer."

"O: Good but lacks the depth, complexity and balance of a fine Belgian dubbel."

"O: A very tasty dubbel. Will be drinking more of this one. The Belgian yeast really makes it pop. Try a pint."

"Despite a really solid, cool smell and a wonderful look and pour, Straight to Ale's Dubbel is a bit fruitier than I was expecting. It's certainly not bad, but not necessarily my preferred taste. I suspect their IPAs are so prolific and popular for a reason. Straight to Ale might just be a brewery more geared toward American IPAs like Monkeynaut or Snakehandler, which are both highly recommended."
"O: A nice dubbel. Enjoyable to drink. Not the best in the group, but a solid choice especially for a local brew."

"O: Overall, a little to sweet, not as creamy as I like and heavyhanded on the candy"

"O: The sometimes-spiciness is nice, but the fruit is a bit too sour and the flavours are a bit too subdued. Not recommended, but worth a try."
"I am having a hard time believing I am the first to review this one, but its the only dubbel I see by this brewery and the menu cleary said Straight to Ale Belgian Dubble. So...it was a great interpretation from a small craft brewery on a dubbel. A nice dark copper with a thick white head that faded fast but left nice lace. The smell had faint belgian yeast on top of a caramel and honey toned backbone with some spicy elements. A bit of a watered down version on the taste for the style, but very drinkable. Unmistakable on the belgian yeast profiles with spicy and fruity characters coming through a caramel backbone with hints of cocoa and cinamon. Very good drink. Easy to down."
