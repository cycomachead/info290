Good amount of lacing on the glass.  Smell is grainy, sweet--hints of candy, dried fruit, raisin.  Taste is also sweet, slightly malty with a very good amount of carbonation -- a slight black licorice hint to things.  This is a very enjoyable winter beer.  For the price (about $8 for a six pack), I think you'd be hard-pressed to find a more enjoyable dubbel.  For the 7.20% ABV, this is VERY smooth.","oldirtycaffrey","Dec 08, 2014"

AROMA: Plum! sweet, sugary confections--some caramel and toffee--the raisin also presents late--not a plum/raisin guy myself, but this does deliver what it promises... PALATE: medium-bodied, chewy and significant--a formidable body--still drinkable without need of resolve...TASTE: big, sweet and dry--a wine's base that marries a brown ale's flatter profile--plum and malt strike an attractive balance...

It just didn't feel like a Trappist Ale and almost felt like an Imperial Brown Ale, because of the stickiness and plain nature that this had. This just didn't quite measure up but Dubbels are full, complex beasts while this was more of an introductory beer to that style. If you've never had one of these before, this would be good to start with since more than one could be enjoyed in a sitting without be overwhelmed. Had this warmed me up a bit, I knew that it would have been more on target.","JerzDevl2000","Oct 24, 2013"

Firmly malty, but nicely balanced. Caramel, raisin toast, almond, pretty complex dubbel. Medium bodied feel with a fairly aggressive carbonation.

I know there's no solid numbers for ABV for the Belgian styles, but 7.2% seems respectable. The beer looked like a Coke in terms of color and viscosity. The nose was OK- nothing really jumped out at me other than the yeast, but the taste was pretty decent- dark fruit (figs, raisins). It was very carbonated but thin. Would I have this again? Probably not.","BuzzLitebier","Sep 15, 2013"

I guess it looks like a Dubbel, but not one of the better examples. Smell- caramel syrup, raisins, a buttery aroma as well. Decent, but points detracted because it reminds me of what melted milk drops smell like when in a movie theater next to buttery popcorn. Chemically in some ways. Taste- chocolate cherry cough syrup. raisins, butter. This is a stylistic miss, and the chemically syrupy nature of this is present even more. This is not a good dubbel, below average.

I had (shamefully) forgotten the color of a Dubbel and was moderately surprised at what I was seeing coming out of the bottle. I got a fluffy two fingers of light-tan head that slowly fell like a souffle. Color was a beautiful copper, the color of an ex-girlfriend's hair (miss you, LindaLou), with NE-quality clarity. Nose evidenced notes of dried dark fruits, caramel and a slight yeasty mustiness. Mouthfeel was medium, approaching creamy, with a lot of caramel flavor on the tongue. This was quite sweet (for my tastes) and yet highly drinkable, given the way it seemed to evaporate from my glass. Finish was equally sweet with the caramel simply lingering.

3.83,7.3,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,"The pour was a nice medium amber in color. Nice dark highlights throughout the mostly cloudy body of the glass. A small head of white peaked out over the top of the glass and settled down nicely into a thin, but firm coating across the top of the glass. Aroma is loaded with bready malts. Tons of rich bready notes that just would not quit. Really nicely laid out, but as it warmed it became evident that it was slightly one dimensional and the light notes of grapes and pears could not save it from being over run by the malts. The flavor was about the same as the huge malt and grain bill dominated all that was around it. Nice and full feel to it though and the carbonation was nearly spot on, the only downside here was that the caramel and fruit that lay underneath was just not given enough room to really flourish.","mikesgroove","Feb 25, 2011"

Big chocolate taste with a hint of coffee. A good dose of caramel sweetness with some slight fruity esters, raisin and grape. Finish is rather crisp and dry. This really doesn't seem like a dubbel to me, just a bit too much roasted character and not enough yeast profile. A tasty offering, mind you, but a bit to clean.

I sensed a bready brown sugar-raisin taste in the beginning and end. Very little carbonation. A good, easy to drink NJ beer that can't quite match a real Belgian Dubbel though.

Similar flavor profile to the aroma. Sweet and malty with a bit of a dark fruit flavor to it. If I were to pinpoint it I'd probably say cherries.

Popping the top I get that great Belgian smell of yeast, spices, some brown sugar and cinnamon. Pours into a chalice to a hearty translucent brown with a wispy head. Taste is also classic Belgian with an up front sweetness from the double malts and a tartiness in the middle as the carbonation and hops take over the sweetness. Finish is mildly bitter and clean. This is an easy drinker and the 7.3% ABV is barely noticeable except for attributing to a silky smooth mouthfeel. This is a good brew and a great value.","mooseisloose","Nov 27, 2010"

Mild dark fruits, prune, apple and a bit of cherry. Light toffee, and toast also make an appearance. The flavor to is rather light only offering wisps of the typical flavors associated with a Dubbel. The one thing different about the aroma then the flavor would be a definite yeasty spiciness that is very detectable in the finish of every sip. Also the 7.3 percent alcohol is very well hidden which shocks me. The mouthfeel goes along with everything I've said about this brew. Its really light, doesn't linger on the palate, and has a very mild carbonation to it. This is a decent attempt at a Abbey Dubbel. Honestly, I wish this beer were amped up a bit.

I served it at room temp, so this beer has no reason why it didn't have a head of foam. It had an aroma of tobacco, burnt malts, a pinch of dark cherries, and ended with a smll touch of burnt citrus hops. The aroma just loved the smell of something being burnt. It had a pretty much average taste of dark fruits, sweet yeast, sweet caramel, and then the taste ended with some roasted citrus hops. There wasn't much to the taste, but at least the flavors weren't burnt like they were in the aroma. It was a medium bodied beer with a short lived aftertaste of yeast and sweet dark fruits. I do have to hand it to them because they were able to mask the 7.3% ABV. I would like to give this beer another chance. I sure hope that the next bottle doesn't taste like this.

Mild yeasty/fruity quality about the aroma with some lesser roasted malt and candi sugar smells. Sugary and fruity, some chocolaty maltiness in the middle, with a mild, leafy astringency near the finish. Not bad, but not what I'm used to in a U.S. brewed dubbel interpretation.

Then flavor did not stay sweet, it turned bitter as it settled on the tongue. F.F. needs to develop some new beer. I've grown bored with the selection they have even with the couple seasonals.

Not bad, but I really thought from smelling it, that it would be much more flavorful. Peppery yeast, with a nice malty backbone, but not much else. Very smooth mouthfeel. Almost velvety. No bite whatsoever. Another strong suit there. And above all, definately drinkable. I'm glad I got a chance to try this beer. Quite a nice one.

Smelled of strong grape scents, musty wood, a small bit of alcohol. Seemed like it was struggling to give whiskey notes. Taste was strongly of grapes, while also starting with moderate sweet, chocolatey malt notes. Middle was reminiscent of cheap red wine, and the finish was creamy.

Very drinkable - I have to admit the first one went down so quickly I had to open another to verify if it actually had any smell - as it approached around 55 degrees it did release some aroma.

This is a very rich tasting brew that has a moderate body. There's a slight sweetness, but it is not dominant at all. A bit of coriander spice meets the hop bitterness on the dry finish.

Decent palate, rather roasty at firstÂ… the mesh of spice, alcohol, fruity hints, candy-sweetness and chewy malts work well together. Unfortunately the finish is curt and clean.
