4.12,2.5,4.25,4,4.25,4,4,"Pours a deep clear brown with a slightly ruddy tint to it. The head barely hangs on after pouring but still leaves some nice soapy lacing. The aroma is true to form, with nice dark fruit and deep caramel sweetness, a little hint of spices, and a little hint of alcohol. The taste is even bigger than the aroma and full of all the aroma characteristics. The body is a nice weight, maybe not quite as full feeling as others but great all the same with just a little hit of carbonation on the finish.","delta490","Sunday at 02:42 PM"

Nice slow fade with huge amounts of clingy lace and clumpy head left behind.  Clear chestnut color with few precipitating bubbles.  Nose of sugary sweet malt, dark fruits, and a bit of boozy alcohol.  Mouth is thin and easy going with little carbonation in evidence.  Tastes of bready malt, definite clean alcohol presence on the finish.  Hints of bitterness.  Overall: Great appearance and nose.  Flavor was a bit underwhelming however I have a feeling I had a rather old bottle.","jettjon","Feb 01, 2015"

Aroma is spicy and sweet, lightly roasted, with root beer or sarsaparilla, gingerbread, light molasses, and candy apple notes discernible. Palate delivers some chocolate and coffee to complement these sweet and spicy elements, a rather bitter yet smooth and rich dubbel, with more body than most Trappist examples (which swing toward the more attenuated) and a pleasant molasses-like or puffed wheat square note in the roasty finish. A sour fruitiness lurks in the background. I appreciate the richer flavors here.","CalgaryFMC","Aug 30, 2014"

Spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big raisin, plum, cherry, fig, caramel, molasses, toast, brown bread, light pepper, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of fruity/earthy yeast and dark/bready malt notes; with good strength. Taste of big raisin, plum, fig, cherry, caramel, toast, brown bread, molasses, light pepper, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Light yeast spiciness/tartness on the finish; with lingering notes of big raisin, plum, fig, cherry, caramel, molasses, toast, brown bread, light pepper, herbal, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a while. Damn nice complexity and robustness of fruity/earthy yeast and dark/bready malt flavors; with a great malt/yeast balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth and lightly slick/bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is an excellent dubbel style. All around nice complexity and robustness of fruity/earthy yeast and dark/bready malt flavors; and very smooth to sip on. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Jul 13, 2014"

The smell has a dark fruit smell balanced with some floral hops. Belgian sugar notes are also present with a bit of a malt sweetness and grain smell as well. The taste is similar to the smell. Dark fruit notes dominate the palate. A floral hop taste is also present but get a little lost in the sugar and caramel malt notes. The mouthfeel is smooth and heavy bodied with some biting carbonation. The beer is actually fairly light with a slightly dry finish. Overall, a fairly good beer that I'll probably revisit again in the future.","HattedClassic","Jun 12, 2014"

Definitely a beer to savor, as more than a glass or two will have you firmly in the alcohol’s grip. What we have is a quality Belgian dubbel, on par with the likes of those offered by St. Bernardus.  This is made even better by the fact that it is Wednesday night at O’Bannon’s, and that means half-price Pint Night, so this $8 beer is now only $4 – and you cannot beat that!","Buschyfor3","Mar 11, 2012"

The nose comprises fig, brown sugar, light orange zest, toffee, and Belgian candi sugar. The taste brings in more of the same, along with some clove, light cinnamon, honey, and very light cocoa. The body is a light-leaning medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a watery-style smooth feel. Overall, a nice, easy-going dubbel, something I could see throwing back a few times at the bar, but not necessarily something I would consider in the upper echelon of Belgian beers.","TMoney2591","Feb 02, 2012"

There were nice fruity malts (plum, raisin), and some interesting spice (anice, clove), but the the tangy, kinda medicinal background kept me from really loving this one.

Pretty much the same as the aroma, malts and fruit, but the spice was more pronounced and lingered on the palate along with sour cherry and toffee.

The flavor is very close to the aroma, a nice bready roasted malt, fig, raisin, molasses taste with a touch of clove spice. The warming alcohol feel and flavor is apparent at first and then fades nicely as you drink. There is a bitterness in the finish that leaves the mouth a little dry, other than that, the mouthfeel is generally smooth and creamy with a good level of carbonation and maybe a little bit on the thin side.

Has some sweet caramelized malt in the beer that gives off some bitter chocolate taste, and finishes dry and husky thanks to roasted malts combo'ed with hop bitterness and some spices and fruit flavors like orange.

The flavors were equally complex, rich malt, caramel, light chocolate, fruity alcohol esters, Belgian yeast and a slightly grainy note towards the end along with some floral hops that offered balance.

The taste starts of with red wine flavors which is cut by slightly roasted malt, a metallic twang follows, finishes with a nice sweetness.

Taste has some moderate bitterness up-front with loads of dark fruity esters. Can't decide if that bitterness is due to the hops or some weird dark malt or what.

4.87,21.1,4.5,5,5,5,4.5,"Poured from 330mL bottle into one of my Trappist-style stemmed glasses. Immediately noticed the rich color, this is definitely an Abbey Dubbel. Head set up very nicely but not too thick, fairly low in carbonation. Then it hit me. That glorious scent of caramel malt. Very potent in scent immediately upon pouring, about 10 minutes of breathing time and the scent mellows. My first sip of this beer and I immediately thought, "Wow!" This is one of the only Belgian dubbels that I have had that wasn't too overpowering on the first sip. Most that I've had usually seem too sweet on first sip so I generally gravitate towards the tripels, which have more bite. My second sip, and I knew that this was a VERY GOOD beer. Mouthfeel typical of most top-quality Belgian styles, almost "fluffy" and light while still reminding you how big the beer really is. While this is a very drinkable beer, the 8% ABV is not to be taken lightly. If this had been a 750mL bottle, it may have been too much for a Wednesday night. :)","KRMBeerGuy","Jun 04, 2008"

On the palate, rich, thick flavors, with bracing, countering bitterness for the sweet malts. Spicy chocolate malts, yeasty fruits and finely honed bitterness characterize the nicely rounded, fulsome palate. This beer really hits all the spots in your mouth.

The brew poured to a nice dark brown color in my chalice with a nice sized dark colored tan head that had nice retention while leaving some nice lacing. The aromas seem to suggest a rich malt scent which seem to have a roasted quality. Also noticeable is a rich fruit like scent that reminds me a little of cherries while a slight chocolate and alcohol smell seems to be there as well. Over all this is a nice smelling brew. The flavors are good, a sweet smell dominates the flavors at first which seems to break a little to a cocoa/chocolate taste along with fruit flavors that seem to not go along with what I was experiencing in the nose, as I am not picking up cherries but more of a fig/date taste. Has a very carbonated feel to it which goes nice. As this brew warms i am noticing more of a alcohol flavor at the tail end which gives it a nice warming feel.

Awesome news as this will only serve to bring in more and more good beers into a place that is already jam packed with goodies. Sat down to order my pizza and was trying to figure out what to order, and I noticed this on tap. Now I hate to admit it, but I had never heard of it before, and had a bit of an issue pronouncing it correctly. I was promptly corrected and proceeded to order. Now this was poured most excellently into a large tulip which bore its name along with a gold lip. The pour was extemely dark brown, opaque with a huge billowing tan head that literally fell over the sides of the glass. I did not think it would actually ever go down. This really looked like a serious beer. It finally settled down but left a ton of lace down the glass for the rest of the session. First whiff of the aroma was very fruity, albeit dark. Hints of apricots and raisins, along with some plum and a touch of alcohol were all readily present. The distinctive aroma of Belgian yeast was ever so present as well. Very nice, floral aroma. First sip was delicous. Very full flavored and lively. Lots of fruity flavors, again figs, apricots, banana, and a nice mellow spiceness melded well with a touch of alcohol that was ever so gently mixed in. Very nice warming feeling upon putting down a few sips. Mouthfeel was superb. Very rich, creamy and thick, great carbonation. I could have sipped this all night, keyowrd there would be sipped. This is defiantly not a chugger by any means. Overall this beer was awesome and exactly what I needed after dinner. I nursed this for almost an hour before all was said and done. I will definatly look for this again when I go back, hopefully it will still be on top, I would love to have some more, and would really love to the try the 10!","mikesgroove","Jul 20, 2007"

The taste is, again roasted but not much of the fruit that the smell promised. Some spice in the end. Speaking of the end it is very dry. It balances out the initial malt. The mouthfeel is thin for the style, although nicely carbonated. The drinkability is very good, with no real alcohol burn and a balance between malt & hops that makes it very drinkable. The finish gives a nice kick that gets you set up for the next one. And the next. Not the best dubbel but a decent offering from a great brewery.

Tasted fairly good, richly malty with molasses and sweet fruit up front, followed by the slight metallic sting of alcohol, but a nice long balanced finish atones for the boozy middle.

Nice fluffy off white head, which dissipates, lingering in pinky nail thickness around the surface and leaves thick sticky lacing. The color is a dark brown with red highlights. Smell of medium yeasty alcohol esters, sweet dark malts, some raisons, brown sugar, plum, other dark fruits and as it worms up bread. The hops are extremely subdued which is not untypical of the style. The taste is much the same as the smells, except with some apple flavor produced by the yeast and a crisp dry finish with a subtle flourish of bitterness. The hop flavor all though not coming forward balances the malt well and forms an even flavor letting the yeasts character shine a little. Over all a nice Belgian Dubbel, honestly I have not really given the Dubbel style a fair enough chance, but as it goes I would say this is a nice one, worth comparing to others.

Head is very thick, large, and tan colored. Aroma isn't very strong. An initial dark, fruity wine flavor quickly disapears and is replaced by a bit of Belgian sugar and a hint of spice. Sip starts with a burst of citrissy tartness which turns into s sugary, earthy Belgian malt body. Spices are in the mix, but seem to be content to linger in the background. A touch of alcohol is noted in the finish. Overall, I'm disapointed and think that maybe I got a bottle that was a little off. The flavor wasn't bad, just unbalanced and somewhat watery.

This great head sat on top of a deep in color but not dark, syrupy beer. The beer had good Belgian flavor, slightly roasted but reinforced by the creamy wheat.

There was also a lingering alcohol that helped accentuate the dryness. The mouth feel was light and dry with an easy small carbonation.

Aromas of candied malts, berries, fruits and spices create a tart and sweet aura. Flavors don't disapoint. Fruity, nutty, with a touch of chocolate, spices, and twang. Feels carbonated, lightly alcoholic, drying, and sweet on the toung. Finishes malty sweet without becomming thick. Hides alcohols well.

It also has aromatic notes of brown sugar, and rum, it almost smells like a rich fruitcake. It is lightly sweet up front, which turns into a rich fruity maltiness, and finishes with a bit of yeast driven spiciness. As it warms up a bit the fruity notes of plum and raisin are joined by notes evocative of apple cider. Has a certain lightness to it, despite it's rich flavors, and is quite effervescently carbonated as well. This beer is actually fairly dry, despite my first impressions. The nose is a bit richer, and a tad more enjoyable than the taste.","Gueuzedude","Sep 02, 2004"

Yeast and alcohol lure in the background initially. Chocolate is down there even deeper. A spicyness comes through along with a slight hop flavor. The finish is where the yeast and alcohol really come through. Very dry finish. Lots of complexity here, this is a really engaging beer.

Tastes of dark fruits, mainly dark cherries or candied cherries maybe? Slight bit of darkened toast in the background. Bit of chocolate. Can taste the alcohol more as it warms up. Medium carbination, maybe a bit too much? Seems too much for the style for me... probably would have thought more of the mouthfeel if there was a tad less carb here...

The aroma is straightforward dubbel with a well-balanced combination of It's delicately crisp across the palate with a very fine effervescence and medium body.

Aroma was fairly neutral, but there was a hint of chocolate malt, which for some reason struck me as a bit odd for the style. On the first sip, I was almost shocked by an initial perception of a mineral flavor that bordered on salty. This quickly diminished and was not evident through the rest of the beer, although it did remain rather dry. The fruit flavors common for the style did not really emerge, and I think I may have been drinking this beer a bit young.","Brent","Apr 07, 2004"

So fresh, as soon as he poured it, I could smell it as he brought it over.  Meduim darkness paired with a rich, creamy head that never dissipated.  Aromas of rasins and plums waft into your nose.  Also on the taste, you could sense all the fruit.  More ripe plums and rasins, combined with a slight toasted malt flavor.  Very rich, warming  and alcoholic.  It reminded me of rich port.  This is a brew to really sit and sip after dinner or any memorable occasion.","AaronRed","Oct 19, 2002"
4.23,5.2,4.5,4,4.5,4,4,"Deep, dark brown color. Thick foamy head, stayed for-ever, and laced down the glass nicely. Rich roasted malt and yeasty aromas. Taste was complex, lots of roasted fruity smells of plums, bananas, with a touch of spicy sweetness. Finish was subtle and lingered slightly, reminded me of a port wine taste. Slightly bubbly feel. No more than one at a time. I had this with triscuits and felt like a yuppie.","StevieW","Aug 12, 2002"
4.27,6.2,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,3.5,"Notes: Complex is not saying enough, so many levels of flavours that go around it is nearly too much. This brew is to be sipped and savoured and should be consumed at cellar temperature for optimum flavour. This is one Dubbel that does not take any crap.","Jason","Apr 07, 2002"
4.4,9.5,4,4,5,4,4,"Another delicious dark strong ale from Belgium. It's a satisfying blend of sweet roasted malt, plum, raisin, nutmeg that's extremely smooth. A slight alcohol warming takes effect and makes this a pleasure to sip and enjoy.","John","Jan 07, 2002"
