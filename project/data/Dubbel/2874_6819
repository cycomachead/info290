4,5.5,4,4,4,4,4,"Poured into a Gulden Draak tulip. Pours a dark chestnut amber with a fine one finger light tan head with excellent retention and lacing. Unusual spicy aroma of bready malt, brown bread, Belgian yeast, clove and an earthy sharp component similar to cinnamon. Flavor is a complex, but well integrated combination of caramel and bready malt, dark dried fruit, brown bread, faint cloves; somewhat earthy. Flavor is subdued but rich. Medium bodied with a hint of creaminess. Very nicely balanced dubbel that seems almost attenuated at first, but offers up quite a variety of flavor as it opens up. Very enjoyable, but not as intense as some other dubbels.","LiquidAmber","Mar 18, 2013"

3.9,2.9,4,4,4,4,3.5,"750 ml bottle into signature chalice, no bottle dating. Cork was a battle to remove on this one. Pours hazy and cloudy dark ruby red color with a 1-2 finger dense and fluffy light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Spotty foamy lacing clings on the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big raisin, apple, caramel, brown sugar, molasses, toffee, toast, fig, brown bread, floral, pepper, light clove, and yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark malt and fruity/spicy ester notes. Taste of raisin, apple, caramel, toast, toffee, brown sugar, molasses, fig, brown bread, floral, pepper, clove, and yeast earthiness. Lingering notes of dark fruit, caramel, toast, toffee, molasses, brown bread, floral, pepper, clove, and earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and complexity of dark malt and fruity notes; with a good sweet/peppery ester balance; and zero cloying flavors present after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a creamy, fairly slick, and lightly prickly mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a very nice Dubbel. Nice balance and complexity of fruity and malt flavors; and very smooth to sip on. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Jan 28, 2013"

Hints of cherries. Alcohol cleans the palate on the finish. Just a little warming from the alcohol. Medium body but a touch overcarbonated. A little harshness on the tongue.

The aroma is sweet, fruity and yeasty, and the flavor adds to this a big malty kick of caramel and molasses, biscuity malts, apples, melons, and perhaps some phenols on top of a smooth, medium to full body that imparts a medium finish.

I really like that in a Belgian and it was abscent here. Smell was quite everage with plenty of dark fruit and toasted grains. Taste was nice with dark fruit profiles, toasted grains, and a lack of that metallic taste that seems to be so prevalent in Belgian styles.

The aroma is at once faint... a sure sign of dissapointment for me since I expect a noseful with any solid strong brown. Then, nut and coffee nuttiness with faint candied sugar notes. You really have to swirl this stuff to whip up the aromatic signature or what there is of it. The taste is nutty with hints of candied sugar. Mild again, however, the taste becomes more pronounced as the liquid warms. Mouthfeel comes through with a swirl or two and presents a pleasant coating for the tongue. It's a drinkable but somewhat unremarkable dubbel. I much prefer something that's not so understated. Still, if your options are few, worth the investment.","jim102864","Apr 04, 2007"

Theres still a faint trace of the hops which lent it a slight bitter finish that kept it from being overly sweet. Mild smokiness comes out through ashes and tobacco flavors. Almost earth malt notes are quickly followed by a slight watery edge just before the spicy fennel reminiscent bitterness kicks in. Yep, reminds me of a scotch ale.

The flavor starts malty and lightly earthy with notes of light chocolate and toffee, then expresses notes of dark fruit (raisins, prunes) as it crosses the palate, and ends with another note of creamy chocolate. The finish is exceptional; long and dryish with a wide range of flavors that alternate throughout the glass, sometimes chocolatey, sometimes fruity, and always with some light spiciness and mild lingering malt. It's sweet but backed by enough hop bitterness to keep it from becoming cloying. Really nicely done, and highly recommended.","NeroFiddled","0"
