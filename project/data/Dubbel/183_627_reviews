"Pours a medium brown color, mostly free from sediment. White head forms and recedes to a ring.  The aroma was fruity and malty with plenty of raisin, fig and plum notes.  The flavor followed suit with plenty of raisin and plum flavors making for a very tasty drink.  Belgian yeast flavor, candi sugar, malts, and fruity alcoholic esters.  Damn fine dubbel ale here and at a low price point.  Medium bodied well carbonated ale.  This could easily win an award in the Belgian style dubbel category.  Very, very nice."

"330 ml bottle into chalice, bottled on 6/13/2012. Pours moderately murky deep ruby red color with a 1 finger dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big raisin, prune, cherry, fig, apple, caramel, toast, molasses, brown sugar, brown bread, light chocolate, clove, pepper, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of fruity/earthy yeast and dark/bready malt sweetness; with good strength. Taste of raisin, prune, cherry, fig, apple, caramel, molasses, toast, brown sugar, brown bread, light chocolate, light clove, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Light herbal/earthy spice on the finish; with lingering notes of raisin, prune, cherry, fig, apple, caramel, molasses, toast, brown sugar, bread bread, light chocolate, light clove, herbal, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice complexity and robustness of fruity/earthy yeast and dark/bready malt flavors; with a nice malt/yeast balance and no cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth and fairly creamy/slick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with zero warming present after the finish. Overall this was a very nice dubbel style. All around good balance, robustness, and complexity of dark/bready malt and fruity/earthy yeast flavors; and very smooth to sip on. A very enjoyable offering."

"What a dubbel should taste like."
"A nice Dubbel, with a beautiful brown color and fair amount of carbonation bubbles and good head. Smell was fairly neutral with nothing really standing out apart from some bready and malty aromas. Very little sugar tastes or sweetness in general like a lot of dubbels. Some spicy coriander flavors and touch of dryness. But the taste was still very solid and enjoyable, if not a tiny bit different from many others in this style. Not always a bad thing. Mouth was fairly thin but still fine. Couldn't figure out the alcohol content, but it seemed to heat up just a tad as beer warmed. A very solid Belgian that I would not hesitate to drink again."

"Mid pack beer, at Beligian Dubbel prices, look elsewhere. Would definitely include in a taste off and I'd try again. Still a mid-Belgique is still a decent beer."

"Overall not sure of the age but the sediment really kills the experience of this beer. It's actually a very drinkable but the price point I don't think I would ever revisit."

"Overall – not a bad brew at all. Good taste, and interesting to think about."
""
"I would buy this again and may even pick up a case at the price I paid!!"
"Still highly impressed by this. The yeast character is really strong but super pleasant. Incredibly impressive beer."
"Of course, it must be drunk, and it is pretty smooth. A litle dark, and the aftertaste reminds you that you singed up for Belgian. This really is a great experience to drink. A great Belgian."
"The mouthfeel is creamy but still well carbonated, leading to a really pleasurable overall experience. I definitely recommend this one, a real nice surprise."
"Eric"
"Enjoyable and good to very good, but certainly not world class."
"D: The beer is very easy to drink and goes down smoothly."
"MF/D: Feel is a little prickly due to higher carbonation. The finish is Belgian yeast and a esters"
"Interesting beer, which was tasty and very easy to consume. I liked it and would have it again, so I recommend trying this beer."
"D - This beer has a darker than average malt profile for its style. There are some nice toffee and brown sugar notes, but they might work better in an English porter or old ale than they do in this dubbel. The real issue with this beer is the lack of carbonation; it leaves the beer seeming thick and lifeless on the palate. Not an awful beer, but it has some serious flaws and it is a disappointment after drinking their vastly superior Witbier."
"Drinkable, but not an overly exciting beer."
"D Pretty good. The raisin like sweetness is pleasing enough and I found the bottom of the goblet without too much problem at all. 4.0"
"Overall this was a very enjoyable beer and hit the spot tonight. If I was looking for a dubbel with huge flavor I would pick up something else, but if I just wanted a drinkable dubbel, this one fits the bill. I'd recommend letting it warm a bit before drinking it though. Straight outta the fridge it's not at its best."
"D: A very drinkable Belgian I think, though I'm just not crazy about it myself."
"D: I could have several of these. Very sessionable!"
"Overall, this is an ok beer. Not something I'd have again, because of the mouthfeel. Howeverm It is an ok representation of the sytle. Fairly cheep for a bottle as well."
"Sterkens Dubbel is easily above average and almost good all-around. The nose and the body could use a little attention, but the flavor's not bad at all. A little more noise from Belgian yeast would certainly improve that aspect a little, but its muted presence doesn't hurt it too bad. There's still enough flavor to go around. All in all, it's pretty good and definitely worth picking up if you spot a bottle."
"Great find, this one would be good with a nice porkchop or hearty meatloaf, love the smell color and taste, picked up a 4 pack on my way to Austin, and just tried the beer just now. Overall it is a pretty impressive beer, wish I could get it here in Oklahoma, god willing I will one day."
"Smooth beer and imagine the ABV is on the higher side but nothing in the flavor to indicate that. With solid flavor but not overwhelming, this beer would be an excellent food pairing option."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied and smooth with a good amount of carbonation."
"Easy to drink, and not extremely expensive, which is nice."
"Ruby brown, off white head. I was looking for something a little darker. The slightest hop aroma. Dark fruits, sweet malt. An almost bitter flavor. Malts come afterward. Some green vegetables. Sort of boozy. Good mouthfeel. Small fizzy bubbles. The flavor is not quite right for me, but fairly drinkable, nice tight carbonation at least."
"date consumed:	19 Nov 2008"
"D: These are drinkable. Feel like some decent belgians without the high price tag? Here you go. I'm guessing this is about a 6% ABV and would make a nice session belgian to be followed by a St. B 12 for dessert"
"D: a good drinker and the only thing that stands in the way is the rather light featherweight flavor for this type of beer, not bad though. Maybe that means I can make room for a few more in the belly!"
"Interesting dubbel, not sure how old it is but it popped up as a single at the local World Market so If I had to guess I'd say it has been around the block a few times. Rich sweet aroma grainy and slightly sour. Light brown pour, decent head and nice lacing. Solid on the palate, easy finish. Flavor is sugary and warm with a nice malt content. Fresh baked breads and dark fruits are reminiscent. Not too bad"
"this is one of the worst examples of the style i've experienced. even gave me a headache."
"D: Overall, this is a decent beer, though I don't think it's as interesting as others from Belgium. Not without its good points, though."
"The smell is grassy, herbal and sweet. The taste was caramel malts and was smooth but not much in the way of a hop presence. It was lightly spiced but didn't make itself known. It was well carbonated and that little bit of spice hit you on the way out. Overall an excellent dubbel which I would buy again."
"Mmm, juicy, but with smooth caramel candy and toffee to match. The juice reminds of Welch's grape juice with tart cherries, strawberries, and a hint of green apple thrown in. This one finishes with a neutral (not really sweet or bitter) aftertaste and a touch of lingering cut-grass and black pepper hops flavors. The body is medium weight and there's just enough carbonation to provide a refreshing feel. Worth trying and underrated IMO. Similar to Grimbergen Dubbel, but better."
"Looking at the bad reviews, I could not believe we drank the same beer. My guess is the storing condition are very important. As I did not detect any skunkiness. No ""fluffy floating"" stuff either. Another thing I've noticed is that all bad reviews are dated last year. Maybe a bad batch?"
"Strong and a tad sweet, but still tasty."
"Subdued aroma is earthy with a wet paper tinge. Taste is good. A slightly citric introduction melds to ripened figs, prunes and other dark fruit. Musty, citric hop bite immediately gives way to some darker malt flavors. Prickly alcohol tinge on the palate with an almost steel like edge. Not too overpowering though. Slick body with an almost watery mouthfeel feels at home. Overall a pretty solid, drinkable beer. Cheers."
"D: Decent overall but the flavor was muted and drank only moderate per style."
"Have had this brew in the fridge for a number of months and thought I would give a try today. Brew pours to a russet brown color with a thick light tan head that has amazing retention but lust only slight lacing. The aromas of this brew are inviting, nice malt smell wrapped around a core yeast smell. Some fruit smells give off the idea of sweetness though with a little alcohol. Also in the mix is a nice spice aroma. The taste is quite good as well very malty up front giving a slight toasted like flavor. Slight caramel flavor wrapped in with the toasted flavors. Very good carbonation which plays with the hop presence to tingle the back of the mouth. Surprisingly easy to drink, IMO a very good brew. While I am not sure I would go looking for this as it is not so outstanding that I would really remember it, I would be happy to have another."
"This beer poured with nearly zero head. And yeast clumps were rampant despite leaving a bit in the bottom of the bottle. There is a nice spicy aroma from this beer, but perhaps subdued due to know head with popping bubbles adding to the pungency. First taste seems to be a bit on the watery side, but does lend a slight spicy/yeast balance...but unfortunately it's seems off in the distance. Again the watery taste also reflects in the mouthfeel and it just seems too light for a dubbel which is the top of the styles I like. Due to the lackluster experience, the drinkability suffers as well."
"Pours a dark amber/light brown with an okay head that fades to a ring. Strong aroma of honey, quite sweet, and even a tiny touch of smokiness. Big malt presence here. Floral as well. Taste is similar- this is a malt bomb. Ther is a bit of woodiness and some more of the floral honey notes. A bit sweet and light for a dubbel. Mouthfeel is smooth, but not especially creamy or full. Decent, but a bit too sweet for the style and lacks a bit of depth."
"There is something disjointed with the sweetness, bitterness, and maltiness."
"I am sure this could be a good beer. But I have no qualms about writing a review when I get an off beer. A quality control review if you will. If you get this beer in Tallahassee, it may be flat, or either it is always flat."
"D: I won't finish it because of the taste. The smell isn't all that appealing either, but it's average for the style. Maybe if I liked drinking hard liquor straight I would enjoy this, but that's not what I'm looking for in a beer."
"This ended up being pretty drinkable towards the end, in spite of my terrible first impression. Still, it has an off taste that I don't care for, and I will probably never bother with this again."
"(Thanks for the review Clint!)"
"pours out of the 11.2 oz. bottle a dark amber colour with crimson hues. a thick off white head appears and sticks with some ample carbonation. nice belgian lace. light candy like aroma, with some must and yeasy funk mixed in. taste is some some subdued maltiness...caramel and cocoa flavours, some candy sweet flavours and ripe fruit. it has a rather tame flavour profile that opens up only slightly as it warms a bit. the mouthfeel is lightly pricky due to the medium carbonation, the overall body is a bit light for the style, too. drinkability is good, just because it goes down easy and there isn't much to ponder as i drink it. very average to below average i'd say for the style."
"Poured from the 330ml bottle into a Chouffe tulip glass. Beautiful color of deep orange-brown with some bright orange highlights. A sizeable creamy head crowns this beauty and lingers for a while as the ample carbonation continues to emanate from the bottom of the glass. Aroma of dry, funky Belgian yeast, some sweet Belgian malt, and a hint of candi sugar and dark fruit (figs). Palate is lightly malty up front, with a hint of sweetness leading to a dry finish. Body is a bit airy and dry, which is kind of incongruous for this usually heavy style. I'm a bit disappointed in this one - the wonderful appearance belies its rather ho-hum qualities."
"11.2oz bottle poured into a St. Bernardus chalice. The aroma is very sweet, medicinal and bready with some dark fruits and yeast. Much like the smell, the taste is sweet malt with dark fruits with some spice and hops rounding out the finish. Overall, this is an odd dubbel but not odd in a bad way. There certainly are better dubbels out there, but I have had worse too. Recommended."
"11.2 ouncer, no freshness/bottling info. offered. Pours ruby burnished amber, slightly cloudy, with MAJOR chunkage flowing out of the bottle. Moderate tan head, with retention shown mostly in a large ring around the edge of the glass. Lots of fine bubble, sticky sheeting and nicley developed lacing. Nose is pepperminty, sweet spice. This is a strange tasting brew, cardboardy and some how ""off tasting"" Mushy in the middle, not impressive, lots of better Belgians out there..."
"D - Great. This is a slow sipper to be savored, not quaffed. But I would definitely buy this again."
"I couldn't really enjoy this one. The beer isn't bad, it's just not in my range. I feel I have had much better Dubbels."
"Poured from a 12oz. bottle, into a snifter. I wish I had read a few of the reviews before I poured, because now there are a few chuncks of sediment floating in the glass. That aside, the beer poured a cloudy copper/faint red, with no head, and very minimal lacing. The aroma is light, but seems to consist mainly of the fruit notes. The taste is suprisingly alot like apple cider. Dark fruit flavors, with a little spice. Interesting, but not what I expect from a dubbel. Nonetheless, a good beer. Light mouthfeel. Overall, this is quite enjoyable, and a welcome beer during a session."
"I was slightly surprised how cloudy this beer was for a dubble. It had a good brown color though. The aroma is great. Very biscuity and malty with a very smooth light body. There is some sweetness but it is overpowered by the maltiness. I like this beer a lot but it isn't the among the best dubbles I've had."
"Poured into my Ommegang chalice from the bottle. There isn't much head to speak of, and the beer is rather cloudy. The beer is a translucent, lighter brown. Very yeasty/bready aroma. Other notes in he smell include sweet cane sugar, and a lightly toasted malt. The taste is pleasant, round, sweet, with fruity and nutty undertones. Definite chocolate maltiness. Everything is great except for the fact that it tastes watered down. There isn't a full, rich flavor, although the flavor is nice. The mouthfeel is smooth, but like the taste, rather watery leaving it thin. This beer would be so much better if it was more dense and rich. This is drinkable, but it isn't close to being as enjoyable as other dubbels I've had."
"D: Despite the watery mouthfeel and just above average scoring for the other areas of this beer, it's pretty easy on the mouth. Is it my favorite Dubbel? Not even close, but it disappeared rather quickly from the glass."
"Pours a deep spoced apple cider. Decent carbonation. Good film throughout in my wide mouth Gosse Island wine glass. Lots of very thick clumpy sediment at the bottom of my 12oz bottle that I dumped before pouring into the glass. The aroma is of muted toasted and very lightly roasted malts with some fainty sweet spices. The taste is a little strained for a dubbel. Not enough in the adjective of dark. I like a dark tasting dubbel. This would be a nice everyday dubbel. Flavor compared to most. Just not up to par for a better than just ""good"" dubbel."
"Drinkability: One of the top beers I had tried so far. Not sure of the ABV, but overall this is a great beer to enjoy over and over and I think I shall do just that."
"The pour delivers a copper coloured brew with no head to bolster it. It has a few random bubbles of chubby stature that pop off here and there. The smell is terrific caramel candy. Maybe some soured dark fruits. Atypically lacking in yeast character. The taste is light and caramel slathered. A bit of creaminess. The mouthfeel is thin and light. The drinkability is good. This feels like a Belgian macro or something. A good entry level Belgian? Hell. This is weird. Not bad, just a touch unexpected is all. Seems a bit subdued."
"Pours reddish brown with white head, it recedes quickly but leaves some lace. Smells malty with fruits. Taste is malt. Moderate to light carbonation and medium mouthfeel. Alcohol not evident like it is in a lot of dubbels. Not bad, I would probably drink this again if it is available, but I wouldn't seek this out."
"I thought this was pretty good. The only thing I found offensive was it smelled of alcohol, but tasted pretty good. A little thin in the mouth feel, nice lacing down the glass and a decent head. Had some nice belgian candied flavor and slight pluminess. Really worth a try and fairly priced."
"Drinkability: This beer has some nice elements but overall, I am underwhelmed"
"With an average mouthfeel of fuzziness, I'd love this beer with picnic of fried chicken and a side of beans and potato salad. Yummy stuff!"
"D - good, easy down, sweet and nice, but the sediment is a little much, didnt realize how thick it was"
"Appearance is brownish with minimal head. The aroma on this beer is quite light. Maybe a touch of tartness in there? I also get a little malt. On the palate, mild raisin, malt, and some slight spice. The flavor profile is good, but altogether I find it a little held back. This is a decent, if unspectacular Belgian."
"Presentation: Packaged in a twelve ounce brown glass long neck bottle with a pop-off crown, served in a Belgian beer chalice."
"An absolutely filthy, thin beer. It's not really that awful, but it's far from a quality dubbel. The Hamm's or Black Label of Belgium."
"I wasn't overly impressed with Sterkens White Ale. Sterkens Dubbel is in the same ballpark likeability-wise. From first sip to last, it strikes me as a second-rate dubbel in a country that's brimming with plenty of first-rate ones. I get no comfort from the fact that it's readily available in my quality beer starved state because it isn't that good and won't be entering my chalice again."
"Poured out to a cloudy cherry hazelnut color with a nice 1/8 inch foamy head. Wads of sediment toward the bottom of the glass. Mountains of lace amid a medium level of carbonation. Aromas of malts, nuts, berries, earth, dough and sweet grain are present. Taste was not as intense as the smell, but still quaffable. Flavors of mild spices, dough, grains and sweet tea. Not bad. Mouthfeel was accentuated by the appropriate level of carbonation, making for a nice edium bodied brew. Decent drinkability. This brew simply lacked enough flavor for me. Worth a try, but there are better examples of the style."
"Pours out a reddish-mahogany color with a light head atop it. Nose is fruity, lightly malty, perhaps a tad musty. First taste is malty, somewhat breadlike, with a plum fruitiness. Bitterness is a little higher than most dubbels but well within the style, with a piney, resinous hop flavor. Finishes simple and fairly clean. Neutral texture with a moderate body. Really, a fairly ordinary Belgium beer, simple and uncomplex, but still drinkable."
"This beer is usually $9.50 per 6 at Metzler's here in Denton, but today I lucked out and found 4 of these on their ""6 singles for $6"" rack (which usually is loaded w/ Budweiser select, Corona Light and something called ""Thin Ice"" which looks suspiciously like Zima). Again, I've no idea as to what the abv of this is, but if it's way up there, then they did a hell of a job hiding it. Big smooth malty beer."
"I'll revisit this at some point in the future."
"I could drink another, but would rather not. It is an okay beer, and worth trying, but I wouldn't go out of my way for one, and i wouldn't pay a premium price either. And DON'T buy a bunch until you try one and confirm it is for you."
"This was drinkable but disappointing."
"Pours with one finger of head. It's a nice golden brown color and mildly hazy. There's very little sediment in the glass. The flavor is almost watery. The aroma is made up of sweet malt sugars and plum. The flavor is much like the aroma - toffee. tart fruit, and alcohol. The mouthfeel is also fairly watery. Overall, not a great beer, but decent."
"Pours a cloudy brownish amber color with lots of flakes of sediment floating throughout the beer. Nose is sweet dark malts and toffee along with a tart fruitiness. Taste begins with sweet and buttery caramel followed by some earthiness. The alcohol becomes more pronounced towards the finish with spicy and peppery notes blended with a bitter hop twang. A decent enough Dubbel but nothing really remarkable."
"More dark fruit, caramel and molassas. A slight sting from the carbonation accompanied by a bit of spice. All in all a decent dubbel I wouldn't mind having again."
"Overall, I would buy again if I was in the mood to drink a lot of belgian beer, and I planned to start with something better first. Not an awful beer by most standards, but a modest one by belgian standards."
"Very good dubbel for the price. Picked up for $8.99 a sixer. Pours a medium brown with nice lacing, not a whole lot of head. Smell is slightly sweet, malty. Taste is very smooth, well balanced. Notes of chocolate, toffee, fruits dominate. Maybe a little vanilla. Mouthfeel is smooth, creamy and full. Very drinkable beer. Not in the upper echelon of dubbels, but a great beer for the price that I will continue to buy and enjoy."
"Tastes of malt, hops, bit of caramel, and hint of coriander. Very good mouthfeel. The malts and hops dance around the edges of the tongue with the adequate carbonation. Some unpleasant off flavors though that are hard to pinpoint."
"Pours orange brown with a thin white bubbly head. Smells of very sweet candy sugar and a subtle fruityness. Tastes of candy sweetness, nutty and a little bit citric, lacking any of the fruityness that I was expecting from the nose. Mouthfeel is thin and perhaps overly carbonated. Very uninspired and lacking everything I would expect of a good dubbel."
"Head is small, yellowy-white. The bottle is full of floaties, but the beer is a clear, rusty, orange-amber. Small spots of lacing. There's a great aroma of rich toffee, some Belgian spice and a touch of chocolate. Yeasty. It starts off chocolatey with alcohol, butter and toffee. Thick, rich, malty, toffee middle gives way to a bitter, fruity finish that still shows plenty of buttery malt. This beer is very good. It's a nice, buttery, toffee dubbel. I like it a lot."
"eeess ok, nothing special..."
"I first had this brew at a place called KClinger's in Yocumtown, PA. It's become a tradition for me to get a bottle of this every time I go there. They have over 600 different bottles at this place. That should tell you how much I enjoy this beer. One of the best beers I've ever had. DRINK IT!!!"
"Big on flavor. Rip zip zap of plums up front, alcohol and grain the back, juicy wet fruit aftertaste in the back."
"This one pours an earthy brown color with a light-brown foam atop the liquid. The aroma is a faint mix of sugar and yeastits a sweet two-dimensional smell. I was kind of disappointed, Im used to Belgian brews having a wondrous depth of aroma. Taste is subtle, with a fruit and malt qualityraisins, grain, caramel, sugar. Theres a little spiciness in the mid-taste. Medium body and creamy texture. Some yeastiness. I found this to be a mediocre dubbel, at best."
"This brew is a dark brown color, with lighter brown hues around the edges. Bubbly cream head tops it off, trailing thick lace after it. The scent is sweet and tart fruits. Sweet malt front, apple, caramel other fruits, touches of bitter hops. Chewy mouthfeel. Hint of alcohol spice. Pretty nice beer."
"Overall Impression: A drinkable and enjoyable dubbel. A little light and spritzy in my book, but overall worth a try."
"Mouthfeel is medium, smooth and soft. Legs on the sides of the glass may point to a higher ABV, although nothing shows in the taste. Not great but a decent dubbel."
"Pours with a two-finger cream head that fades slowly leaving some lace. Cloudy amber color, loaded with chunky bits. Medium carbonation. Nose is malty. Light to medium bodied. Starts sweet has a plum/raisin flavor. $3.99 for a 12oz bottle from Hoosick Street Discount Bev. Troy, NY."
"This beer poured a dark brown color with a huge off white foamy head. The head was massive in size and it took awhile for it to diminish. All I could really smell was a brown sugar sweetness. Really sweet in the nose. The flavors were lacking in this beer. The thin body hurt it from having anything that I would call depth. There was some caramel and fruity undertones but there also seemed to be a sour medicinal flavor in there, yuck. The finish was dry and chalky, not really enjoyable. This wasn't really a dubbel and it wasn't really a good or even average beer either."
"Poured a nice darker brown color, with a huge head of off-white sea foam. Smelled of cloves, berries, and definitely hops. Taste was fairly delicate to begin with, but finished strong with alcohol and hops. I definitely wanted another bottle of this when I was done, it was an excellent beer."
"The beer pours a dark amber color with a thick creamy off-white head. The aroma is great. It has a nice malty scent with some spicey undertones. The yeast gives it a refreshing fruit aroma. The taste is good. It has a malty core that is enhanced with spices and fruity yeast. The mouthfeel is great. It is a medium bodied beer with creamy carbonation. This is a fine Dubbel. I would buy this again."
"Twelve oz brown little with a simple silver label of a monk pouring a beer. The beer poured out dark ruby red with a very lively carbonation that reminded me of cola. A two inch thick off-white head formed rapidly, and then receded to a quarter inch line of foam. There were lots of yeast floaters around. The aroma was sweet-sour reminiscent of honey and caramel with faint and distant hops. Tastes like it smelled, sweet, yeasty, and malty with hints of chocolate, plums, and toffee. Slick with a somewhat thin mouthfeel."
"Carefully poured even an aged bottle delivers a clear, deep-copper bordering on russet-brown colored body with a fair-sized head of creamy off-white foam. And although it doesn't hold particularly well, it does drop slowly and leaves some very nice, spotty lace throughout the goblet. The aroma offers juicy dark fruit amidst a candyish sweetness; backed by a delicate caramelish malt and subtle spiciness. The flavor follows suit with some additional candyish sugariness and more spice, and the malt reveals a gently toasted character in addition to its caramelized sugars. It's very well balanced, and the alcohol is nicely cloaked. The body is medium with a very fine carbonation that gives it a lightly tingly, creamy mouthfeel; and it finishes with a gently lingering sweet maltiness that fades to reveal some spice and bitterness, leaving the palate refreshed and ready for another sip. An enjoyable and satiating beer!"
"Sterkens Dubbel Ale: Kind of a curious taste, I guess I was anticipating more of a yeasty tartness to this beer, but it has really got a lot of candy like sweetness. The color is a deep amber, with a very white head for the style and, nice Belgian lacing. The aroma is sweet and candy like, although not cloying. As already noted, the taste is driven by sweetness of the malts, and perhaps a wee bit too much rock sugar. It is lacking that blazing alcohol warmth that so many of its cousins in the style have. All in all, it is probably a poor example of the style, but I like it, damn me to beer geek hell, I like it."
"Unusually light colored for its style. Copper colored with thin off white head. Fizzy carbonation. Sweet toasted candi sugar aroma melded with a nutty, almost metallic nose. Not much to speak of in the hop department, but I didn't expect much there. Very sweet malty texture with a minimal copper penny in the mouth acidic twang to it. I suppose I'd say it was drinkable for it's light feel, but it's a bit to sweet for me to go the long haul."
"The beer pours deep amber to brown color, hazy and the head modest in size, frothy texture and a light beige color the lace forms a fine sheet upon the glass. Nose has a sweet malt front, caramel actually nut like comes to mind, crisp and clean. Start is nicely malted, sweet and the top middling in feel with the finish bitingly acidic; hops are upfront in their spiciness, very dry and a decent but not great double"
"Thanks to garymuchow for the bottle. It was my reward for driving down to Owatonna and drinkin' 11 beers for the Steele County Fair."
"Brown body with orange highlights, ruby when held to direct light. Frothy eggnog-colored head. Aroma of herbal hops and a dose of sweetness. In the taste, that sweetness becomes defined as a candy-like taste, mixed in with some fruitiness (non-citrus), more like dates and maybe a little plum. Herbal hops also present in taste, and are a bit astringent. Something is a little off in the finish, A slight chalkiness left on the tongue. Feels good drinking, but declines with the swallow. Disappointing in the end."
"this beer makes my glass look like a pretty glowing orb. Firey amber colored. The head isn't too impressive. Very thin and spotty. Smells of cherries and spice. Tastes nice, but weak. There's not too much going on here. A little bland on the tongue. Tasty enough to enjoy this one, but I won't be seeking it out."
"Cardboard flavor with a hint of fruit. Light body for a dubbel with a dark brown color, nothing exceptional for a Belgian Dubbel. The foam was not there possibly and old case... but the taste was very drab and not exciting. As far as Belgians go not up to their standard."
"Sweet malt nose with a slight soapy smell. Cherry colored with a slight white head. Malt flavor seems a little watery with a predominant paper like sterile flavor. You also get traces of raison, edgy yeast, and a dry kicked up ABV finish on the tongue. The beer also seems light on the mouth side as well. A decent beer, but not one that really impressed my tastebuds that much."
"I enjoyed this one."
"It is pretty sweet overall with a big malty character. The fruits are very subtle at first, but they come in later, and you are left with an aftertaste of dry black cherries. I picked up some bready flavors near the end along with a touch of yeast. This is definitely not an amazing beer."
"This beer poured into the glass nut brown in color with amber/reddish hues. The head was big, rich, thick and creamy and tan in color. It lasted very well and left a chunky lace behind that stretched all the way on the inside of the glass. I also noticed that this beer seemed to have good carbonation as the bubbles could be seen through the clear liquid. The aromas that came from this beer were of caramel, malts, fruits, hops, flowers, fresh grass, some spices and a slice of bread. All these seemed to come out after each sip, some more pronounced then others and some not until the end. The tastes were of hops, caramel, dried flowers, sweet malt, fruit – fresh and sour – and a yeasty bread flavor, which was slight. The beer had a bite and was tangy in the front, some sweetness in the middle, and ended with a slight dry felling of the hops. All flavors seemed pretty well balanced all through the glass."
"Delicious, and tasty, but very soft on the palate. Nothing too much, but nothing too little. A pretty decent dubbel!"
"This beer pours a clear red/brown with a rocky/bubbly off white head. The mouthfeel is moderate and very average. The smell is caramel-like and somewhate grassy. The taste is cookielike with mild herbal/grassy hoppiness and a slight warming alcohol. This beer while not bad, made me wonder if this was a Belgian version of macroswill. If so can we trade it for Bud?"
"A lazy-day dubbel. And a nice one."
"Pours a ruby red with a very thin head that clings in patches throughout. The smell is mostly grassy with just a scent of alcohol. Prominent bitter malt taste with a light and spicy hoppy feel that comes after a few sips. Has almost an earthy aftertaste, very warming--the alcohol feel is right on target, very drinkable."

"Clear amber color with an orange tinge. Forms a decent head when poured, but it quickly dissipates. The aroma was of sweet caramel malts, and an herbal, clove-like aroma as well. The flavor is a bread-like maltiness, with the caramel malt flavors as well. The hop bitterness is almost non-existent. Overall, the body was very thin and watery. I guess it really did not live up to my expectations."
"This beer is like free jazz. A Medeski, Martin & Wood tune. You're taken aback by what seems to be a cloddish attempt at art, but you hang in there because there is something about it. Something right. Initially, the nose seemed a pronounced, armpit-like odor that was not good, but as you drink and the aromas seperate, you notice the earthiness of it, the connection to something foreign. The way the spicy hops edge a transient sweetness. The heady phenolic and alcohol skin. Unique, and good."
"Hazy dark amber in color, almost no head at all.  Lots of sediment in bottle even when poured slowly.  Malty toffee like aroma, hint of alcohol and a bit of tartness.  Spice and malt blend very well together, and a hint of hops gives this a slightly dry but very well balanced finish, with a gingerbread cookie-like aftertaste.  Medium-light body. Very drinkable"
"Brilliant brown liquid and honeycomb-patterned white head. Neutral nose of autumn leaves and oreos. Some gaps appear in the aromas and flavors revealing chaff, metal and simple sugar flavors. Otherwise there are nice spicy, gingerbread and tangy, floral nuances. Definitely a downable dubbel, and not too intense in a crossover kind of way. Still, quality is universally appreciated. So why not choose another."
"Initially a sweet malt aroma, followed by more malt richness, finally settling into a phenol quality with sweetness and some cloves.  Nice full head in biege color that settled to a rocky look with lacing trails.  Nice amber color and clear. Taste has nice blend of mild malt richness with phenols (this combines quite nicely).  Some warmth and alcohol taste, but exceedingly strong.  Some dryness, but not bitter on the finish, and rather short.   Maybe a little thin on mouthfeel.  Quite tastey and enjoyable."
"Deep red color with an initially good head that drops to lace very quickly.  A little compost to the smell, earthy and woody.  Pleasant flavor, heavily malty with some sense of caramel.  Medium-bodied.  Hops are peppery at the close, mostly there as a balancer.  The smell promised more than I tasted here, a little unidimensional and could have used a vague atringency and dried leaf flavor found in some Doubles.  Still, a nice beer to enjoy in the cooler months."
"This beer pours a deep amber color with a really thin, short-lived head that leaves hardly any lace. The nose is of roasted malt with somewhat of a nutty characteristic. The taste is of the malt with almost no hop flavor penetrating through. The mouthfeel is rather thin and weak for the style. Drinkability wasn't poor, but I wasn't in a hurry to grab another one. This is one of the few Belgian beers with which I've been disappointed. Although it's certainly not bad, it's over-priced and rather average for its style."
"Certainly a well-balanced ale.Slightly damp aroma.Nice lace,color of Autumn leaves,mouthfeel was a little light for my taste but offered very good drinkability.Nice warming on exhale.This is served at one of the local pubs, so I will have to try it again."
"Burgandy in color, this beer is topped with a small beige head with no retention.  Some light fruitiness blended with a musty earthiness on the nose.  Taste is pretty mellow.  Some spiciness is present as well as hebal tea like qualities.  Mild yeast tones and breadiness are also evident.    Body is light to medium.  A nicely drinkable belgian."
"Notes: A pleasing Dubbel, rich and flavourful with an agreeable collaboration of malt, yeast and hops. One of the better Dubbels to come our way in a long time."
"A pleasant and flavorful dubbel."
"Well balanced, although somewhat astringent with an almost white-wine like finish."
