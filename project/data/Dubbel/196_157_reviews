"330ml bottle. Augustijn Chalice glass. Brownish amber color headed by beige froth & close but quickly diminish crown. Toasted, prune, plum marmalade, brown sugar & herbal aromas. Sweet, crystal & caramel malty upfront. Medium to full body. Moderate to high carbonation. Silky palate. ABV is felt as a sugary & kind heat. Slight wood, spiced, anise & cumin hues. Sweet & quite sparkling finish. Long fruity aftertaste. Correct beer."

"Not a mind-blowing Belgian ale, but nevertheless a really solid one. I'm definitely glad I got to try it."

"O: Probably my favorite dubbel. It's a really good beer, and when I try it again I will edit this review."

"Tried a bottle just a few months off the expiry date. Poured into a Chimay goblet. Beer was a pleasing red/russet hue, quite sparkly with a fair amount of brown foam that held its form well. I screwed up the pour and got a decent yeast cake floating in the glass but not a big deal. Aroma very fruit-forward, fresh grapes, plums, and oranges along with sweet bread and spicy phenols that evoke anise and clove. Palate complex and includes some interesting flavors, even in the world of ester and fusel hurling Belgian yeast strains. Starts fruity, with the aforementioned grapes, citrus, and something even sweeter like classic Belgian yeast bubblegum, blackcurrants, a hint of sour cherry. Then moves into dark dried fruit territory with dates and raisins, marmalade. Cola and anise spice flavors emerge, and the whole package is back-dropped by brown sugar. Thickish but smooth body that is maybe a bit lighter than some other dubbels, moderate carbonation that allows the flavors to all peak though and overall impression is low-key sweet malts, fruit, and some unique spice flavors. Solid offering."

"O-not my favorite of the style but still a very solid beer"
"This a warm, fruity and spicy little dubbel. It has a the rich flavor of anise but it doesn't overpower. The dark fruits are rich but not too sweet and the brown sugar in this is terrific and restrained. The body of the beer is firm with plenty of bread and the lightness it has in the malt is deceptive to the palate. You are expecting a huge heavy sweetness and then it glides like as if on air instead. Worthwhile and smart."

"Pours a murky orange-brown with a foamy orange-tan head that settles to a partial film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, brown sugar, caramel, spice, and dark fruit aromas. Taste is much the same with dark fruit and spice flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of spice bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer with a solid dark fruit and spice presence in the aroma and flavor."
""

""
""
"Overall: Not as good as the big trappist dubbels, but this is unique in its own eay and can hold its own as a belgian i would reccomend. Especially if you like te really overripe fruit and cherry taste."
""
""
""
"Very good Dubbel, this one seemed to have evolved nicely overtime to be more complex and round (it has just 5 months before expiration date). Good beer for your buck."
""
"O: I wish that this beer could have delivered on the flavor what it does on the aroma. It was much less intense than I was expecting, and the flavors overall all feel a bit muddles and muted. That being said, it is a very decent beer and worth picking up."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Really good. Goes down almost too easily, but I'm complaining about that."
""
"O- Very good, but then what do I expect with a Belgian beer. One of the better dubbels."
""

"I haven't paired this one with food yet, but I imagine it would go well with a summer or an Italian sausage"

"750 ml bottle served in a Chimay trappist glass. Pours a reddish brown color, lots of floaties, decent frothy off-white head, good lacing. Aroma is caramel malt, slightly roasted, spices, yeast, and a hint of plum. Flavor is bread and caramel malts, yeast, spicy, dark fruits, and candy sugar. Mouthfeel is medium, dry, fairly carbonated, and a little bitter. Good beer, drinkable."

"330ml. bottle. Amber reddish colour with a big creamy head and a lace that keeps forever. Chunks floating on the glass. Smell of candied fruits, caramel, spices and damp earth. Taste is on the sweet side, with an astringent finish.Apple, banana, pepper, caramel and some medicinal notes."
""
""
"O - Ages well. I remember an earlier bottle I tried not being as good. A pretty good dubbel."
""

"this is great beer! Great smelling, great tasting. Ranks as one of my favorite Dubbels. will buy again."

"Overall, this is a wonderful Dubbel. Too bad it is not available in Georgia."
""
""
"A very enjoyable Dubbel."
""
""
"750 ml bottle into signature goblet, bottled 7/7/2011. Pours lightly cloudy reddish copper color with a 1-2 finger foamy light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Spotty lacing clings to the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of raisin, prune, apple, caramel, toast, pepper, clove, banana, earth, candi sugar, molasses, and yeast spiciness. Damn nice aromas with nice complexity and balance. Taste of apple, raisin, pear, caramel, toast, clove, pepper, banana, earth, candi sugar, bread, and yeast spiciness. Lingering notes of light and dark fruit, caramel, toast, pepper, clove, banana, earth, candi sugar, and yeast spiciness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice flavor complexity with good balance; zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a fairly creamy, slick, and prickly mouthfeel that is very nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with almost zero warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is an excellent dubbel. Great complexity and balance of flavors; very smooth and crisp to drink. A very enjoyable offering."

"A medium body and smooth feel to it. This is a nice, quality Dubbel."

"O: very good dubbel, more refreshing than other abbey ales and with great balance sweet/bitter/alcohol."
""

"Overall - A great beer that I feel rewarded to have chosen out of the many other great Belgian doubles on the shelf. Balanced, lively, full of flavor and easily drinkable for the abv. Nice work Affligem I will look for your name in the future."
"Sweetness up front which gives way to the dark fruit. There's a medicinal quality to the taste which is eh. A good but not exciting flavor on this dubbel. It is well carbonated with a medium body."
"O: I won't be seeking this out ever, but I certainly wouldn't turn it down if I were in the mood for a dubbel."
""
""
""
"Pours reddish brown and hazy, thin head. Smells sweet, like bread. Taste has a mild sour note and low hop profile. Body is light, not watery, but light and with decent carbonation. Overall a good beer. The finish and the body are limiting factors here."
""
"D - A traditional Belgian dubbel that tastes and feels just like it should. I've always enjoyed dubbels ever since I first got into craft beer, and this is yet another I enjoyed a great deal. This brew offers up a degree of complexity, drinkability, and flavor that I really enjoyed."
""
""
""
"O: A pretty good dubbel, not the best I've had by a long shot but still. worthy of a purchase."
""
""
""

"DOA"
""
""

"O: Not even close to the best Dubbel's I have had."
""
""
"Affligem Dubbel, 750ml bottle: Storm chasers get ready for the thunderhead of suds that will form on top of translucent mahogany brown brew. Just as big as the head, the aroma lets you know there is a big dubbel waiting for you as things settle. When you finally venture to take the face shot of foam searching for some beer below, you will be greeted with big caramel and brown sugar flavors, and a smooth drinking experience. This is as fine a dubbel as any. It’s a little too sweet for my tastes, but that is more of a comment on dubbels in general, rather than of the Affligem, which is an excellent representation of the style."
"Overall: A concoction that is developed to satisfy every taste bud that appreciates what fine beer is supposed to be made. Treat yourself, grab a glass and watch little TV you'll will definitely not be disappointed. Salud!"
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A great Dubbel. The nose was the highlight for me, but everything about it is solid. Impressively drinkable for the alcohol content. Definitely something to seek out."
""
""
"Overall: an addictive beer - the taste is so interesting, and yet undefinable"
""
"Bottle: Poured a clear deep amber color ale with a large foamy head with a super large foamy head with great retention and very good lacing. Aroma of caramelized sugar and fruity ester is quite enjoyable. Taste is a well balance mix between some caramelized sugar with solid malt backbone and some fruity ester. There was a light metallic taste that I could have done without but it was quite subtle. Body is about average with nice creamy texture and great carbonation with no apparent alcohol. Not the most overly complex example of the style but very enjoyable nonetheless."
""
"My god. In true Belgian style, this beer just bursts with smell and flavour. It also pours beautifully, leaving a nice thick head that has great retention (although no lacing). Its a reddish brown that screams malt, and this is exactly what you get when you smell it - mixed of course with the characteristic Belgian yeast smell. Maybe even a hint of cherry. Damn this stuff is tasty. The cherry really shines through in the taste, as does the malt, which is almost perfectly balanced by the light hops. It has a nice dry, well-carbonated mouthfeel. Overall, this is an amazing beer. I will definitely buy it again."
""
"Overall this has a unique taste/consistency to it. Its a nice switch up from all the overdone american crafts Ive had lately. Decently priced, alright availability. I think if this were aged for at least 6 months to a year it would do wonders for this beer to mellow/balance the booze taste."
"D - I like this one and would definitely have it again."
"O. I was thrown off by the reviews on this site, but i have to say this is one i will get again for its drinkability. I enjoyed this more than the St. Bernardus Prior 8 and the Westmalle Dubbel. Each to their own i guess"
"D: A tasty dubbel that I'm finding quite easy-to-drink (result of lighter body maybe). Not quite brown sugar forward but more of a refreshing tropical fruit focus. Would definitely recommend."
""
"O- Not your standard dubbel and actually quite a complex brew, showing that industrial bewing does not necessarly means flat and boring. Nicely drinkable, maybe just a bit too much on the malty side to be a perfectly balanced beer. Very nice price/quality ratio"
""
""
"O - A tasty dubbel and certainly worth a try, but don't expect to be blown away. Would need to pack a bit more flavour into this one to make it world class."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Just a run of the mill dubbel for me. Not much complexity to the beer at all"
""
""
""
""
"O: This is a very enjoyable beer. Definitely lighter than a quad, but not so light that you feel something is missing or lacking. Reasonably priced. I've had this a few times before, but tonight is the first time reviewing it, and I have to wonder, why don't I buy this more often?"
""
"Drinkability: It's a smooth drinkable beer accompanied with good flavors and aromas."
""
"Poured a dark ruby/mahogany with a lighter brown to offwhtie head. Decent clarity in the body, moderate lacing and some retention of good thickness. Nose has some lightly dried and dark fruits, a touch of brown sugar. Taste is fairly dry as well, dark breads, mild vinous notes and more dried dark fruits. A bit of brown sugar again, with pronounced spice and yeast notes. Mouthfeel is medium with a good amount of chewiness, moderate and restrained carbonation that works well for a beer of this style. Decent, if a somewhat plain dubbel. Not exemplary, but pleasing."

"Overall: Good Beer, Definantly Pick one up and add it to your cellar"
"O: I taste quality, but it's a strange one. Weird mix of flavors, and weird flavors. More interesting than enjoyable."
""
""
""
"O- I've never encountered a dubbe, like this. Maybe it's me who knows but the licorice is definitely a new flavor for the style."
""
""
""
""
"O: okay, but leaving a flat impression."
""
"Overall, it's a decent take on the style. At the same time, it doesn't really stand out much, and it will be a little hard to remember. I wouldn't refuse one of these, but I'll likely opt for other Dubbels first."
"O: Quite nice beer, but a poor excuse for a Dubbel..."
"The overall impression is really good! I've had many a dubbel, and though my favorite is still probably the Chimay Red, this one really gives it a run for its money: complex and rich, with a great spicy phenol profile, and a much more substantial feeling body (less carbonation). Not a session brew, but a near perfect cold-night beer in my books."
"Lively, biting carbonation, feels fairly light. Fairly complex, enjoyable dubbel."
"Overall, enjoyable but not particularly good dubbel. Pales in comparison to a Westmalle or an Ommegang. Decent beer but no reason to buy it if you can get one of the others."
"An agreeable enough dubbel, a little too cozy with the sweetness, perhaps, but with plenty of things going on otherwise to render this nice and drinkable, and more than enjoyable after all the thinkin' and appraisin' is well and done."
"O/D - Could do with less spice and more fruity malt notes. It's an alright Dubbel but not a hair raiser. Respectable but not world class in any way."
"Overall – A very well crafted beer, but the flavours weren't my favourite. I'm glad I gave it a try but there are many other beers in this style that I'd rather be drinking."
"Rich, smooth and certainly one of the best glasses of beer I've had in a few months, this is an incredible beer that I would describe as 'worth a try', if not a must-try, to anyone who purports to enjoy Belgian brews. My first dubbel, but definitely not my last."
"M: Viscosity from alcohol is downplayed by the sugars. Carbonation is medium-low. Overall achieves a silky feel that is pleasant, even luxurious."
"Nice dubbel, accessible, though not nearly as bold in the flavor department as I would like. Still, nice pickup - I'm going to age a couple bottles, see what happens."
"Reddish brown colour, one finger of dense tan head, sticky with decent lace. Smell is quite fruity, tons of dark fruits, raisin, nice yeastiness comes through also, brown sugar, light alcoholic notes, spicy points as well. Taste is similar to nose, fruit up front, plum and raisin, burnt sugary notes come out in the finish, nice fruity aftertaste, moderate yeasty notes, spicy towards the middle. Med-high carbonation, soft and lightly creamy, fairly smooth, nice full body, good weight. This is a very nice dubbel, not the most complex but its very flavourful and complimentary, good stuff."
"I am glad I came across this at the LCBO and will certainly grab it again. Like the others I have tried from this brewer, it is not overly complex but it is certainly a well crafted brew that is very easy drinking."
"Really similar to the tripel. A very good beer, not quite on par with some of the world's best, but just a notch below them."
"O - this is just really really good; a rich and satisfying dubbel that doesn't come off the least bit heavy or cloying; bravo"
"O - No real quirks here about this one, just not a beer that will take you over or turn your head. Good flavor mix."
"nothing to be ashamed of but nothing to put it in a class of its own either, try it if its convenient for you"
"From the wire-caged corked 750 ml. bottle marked 10-173-14. The pour is somewhere between amber, red, and brown. The head is softly floating on the top and slowly fades away. The Belgian sugar and crystal malts shine on the nose. The body was a little thinner than I expected but still quite nice. It is sweet up front and then the malts are clean on the tongue and the hops are soft and dry. Nice beer."
"I tried this beer on October 30, 2009 at ""Smokeless Joe's"" in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The beer poured a deep reddish-brown with a 1/2"" tan head. The aroma was roasted malt, caramel, and plums. The mouthfeel was medium bodied with medium carbonation. The flavour was roasted malt, slightly sweet, some fruit, and licorice in the finish."
"jd"
"Medium body with heavy carbonation."
"-Flandes Bar, Oviedo, Asturias"
"Poured a little cloudy, mud-brown color. Ample head. Served in wide-mouth Chimay glass. Yeast visible at bottom. Caramel/brown sugar as primary flavors. Hints of raisin/prune. Had a sour apple/apple core type aftertaste. Fairly heavy. Not as good as their tripel, and I actually prefer dubbels in general."
"There are other abbey ales that I prefer but it was well worth the price. The finish left something to be desired for me but I would certainly be well satisfied if this was the only option available for an abbey ale."
"Notes: Great price-quality ratio, at least on this occasion, and while I am slightly more pleased by some of their seasonal offerings this Affligem is a good addition to any shelve."
"Got damn. This stuff has really mellowed out, not that it wasn't fantastic before. This is a quintessential Belgian dubbel. Nothing really bowls you over the head or kicks your behind, but it is really solid and really drinkable. To tell you the truth, nothing really blows me away here. The characteristics of a Belgian dubbel are there. Very, very solid. Not sure if the aging has really done anything to this beer, however (nothing too discernible). Paired with a nice Grouyere, however. It really paired well with the Belgian yeastiness of this beer."
"Not a bad beer to try but there are much better dubbels readily available."
"Alot of carbonation and with a full flavor of that typical yeast strain found in the Belgium Abbey Ales. Some floral hints with a bready, toasted flavor. It makes you want to stay their for another, only this time accompanied by good conversation, to talk about it's complexities and warm nature. Cheers!"
"Nice, drinkable and smoke-centred Dubbel with an rather unbalanced finish."
"D - Yes. Yes. It's decent ABV would make you think this is a sipper but I could have a few. It's on my list for ones to enjoy more!"
"Very appealing without being overly complex, the dryness does more for this beer as it is able to separate itself from the sweeter Dubbels. A bit of an underdog within its style, and should be given at least a chance--we are glad we did."
"Picked this up in a two style sampler with chalice at the French version of Walmart (Carrefour) in Puerto. I liked the chalice, which I poured the .33 L bottle promptly into and appreciated the two fingers of head. The colour is a tawny brown apparition of my former self from the summer. The smell is of malts, yeast, and berries-reminds me of cranberry bread. Taste is sweet with a background of warmth from the 6.8% ABV (not sure when the 7% came in to play) . Mouth feel is medium bodied with some effervescence from the carbonation. Drinkability is fine but I have only found this in a four pack sampler with chalice at abt $10.00 USD. (Not too bad!)"
"D - Pretty good. Even though it's not that strong, I'd still probably call it a sipper. Goes down pretty smoothly, but the spiciness might get to you."
"D:Not a big multi-layered brew, but easily drinkable and a decent example of the style."
"Notes: Really glad that I kept this bottle (and that it survived the trip) so that I could enjoy it this evening."
"Finishes with a long sweet but semi dry with lots of lingering Belgians malts and sugars, candi and syrups, touch of bitterness."
"Affligem dubbel comes in a 750mL bottle topped with a champagne style cork. It poured a hazy, honey, brownish tan. The head was a rich light cork color. The nose was earthy but a little sweet. Maybe a hint of hazelnut and some yeast. Nice...the first sip is soft and sweet. It was defiantly hazelnut I was smelling because it hit the tongue like a freight train. There is some apricot and tartness on the sides of the tongue that add some balance to this sweet dubbel. Some lingering leathery feel finishes out this nice Belgian beer. This would be great paired with a glazed ham and stuffing. Maybe a side of mashed sweet potatoes or carrots with brown sugar. Perhaps I should keep this beer in mind for Thanksgiving dinner."
"Bought this in a Czech grocery store, for $1.50. Pours out a red-brown color with a thick, chunky head that sits on top for quite a while leaving lacing all over the glass. The nose is pretty unremarkable, malts, faint cloves, caramel, and a off putting metallic smell. The taste is similar to the smell with more alcohol and spice, bitterness and a metallic taste that is a bit overwhelming and pretty much ruins it for me. Nothing special here, but not bad for $1.50"
"Drinkability: a tasty, solid and drinkable dubbel. This is a beer I would gladly have again."
"Overall, this ale is almost too drinkable. Worth a try, at the very least. I'm keeping this as one of my favorite Belgian-style ales."
"Overall - A good, if pretty standard, example of a Belgian Dubbel... definitely worth a try though..."
"This was a classic abbey dubbel, but I was a little disappointed. I think I can brew a better one myself!"
"D: The beer is relatively easy to drink but doesn't stand out among dubbels given the limited amount of complexity in the taste."
"d: Subtle and restrained overall, I really enjoyed this."
"Very average Dubbel. I'm glad that i've tasted it but don't need to revisit it when Westmalle is sitting right next to it on the shelf."
"A fairly laid back dubbel. Pretty good, but there's nothing here to really blow you away."
"Kinda weird, kinda pleasant. It fails as a Dubbel, but succeeds as an interesting beer, so it's a bit hard to review. I'll say this, I'm enjoying it at the moment, but will probably never go back to it."
"Drinkability (2): Very average, nice addition to a good meal."
"D: Not a bad Dubbel at all, but not my favorite by any means."
"Finished dry, I love it. Could easily drink this for the rest of my life."
"D: the price is right, the flavor is great...this is a regular in the rotation"
"Drinkability-Icould drink a bottle but after that I might switch on to something else(not a session beer)"
"Huge drinkability potential. Huge flavor, and fantastic lasting flavor makes this a Dubbel that is a cut above others. Not to mention the price, its hard to beat."
"Affligem Double is a rich shade of reddish-brown. As I pour it from the bottle, it forms a thick, soapy, off-white lather on top. This head is very well-retained, but doesn't leave much lace behind. It smells medicinal, also showing hints of banana, pear, raisin, and plum. Caramelized sugar, sweet over-ripe fruit, and an unexpected lemony-tartness in the finish. Slightly medicinal. Medium-bodied with sharp, spritzy carbonation. Feels light but not thin. I found it easy enough to put this one back."
"D- I would not bother again"
"Good beer with nothing extraordinarily remarkable. The cork is very nicely decorated...but ill save that review for later."
"Overall, average beer, i mean, considering the fantastic dubbel out there...."
"Though others' reviews say otherwise, I believe this to be the best of the Affligem offerings. This is a beautiful beer that belongs in the discussion with the Chimay Red's and Westmalle Dubbel's."
"D: Great beer. It's my first dubbel and I really enjoy it. I would like to see more brought on in the flavour department, but it is good none the less. Also, it's worth noting the the alcohol is not noticeable at all, hidden quite well."
"Mouthfeel as stated is impaired by the strong carbonation. I find this impacts the drink and reduces it's drinkability."
"Overall, yeah. This is good but far from the best dubbel I've had. I have one more to drink, but I don't think we'll make it past the second date."
"The body seemed weak and watery for 6.8%ABV, pleasant enough, but lacking in richness and body for me."
"There's definitely some great things going for this beer, but somehow a great aroma masks a middling flavour. I was going to buy a few to cellar, but I think I'll give it a miss."
"D: A very good dubbel that I wish had toned down the carbonation for better feel, but the herbal, lemony hoppiness is a welcome and unique characteristic of this widely available brew."
"Rather straightforward in flavor without a great deal of depth. Some plum and black cherry notes are supported by a steady release of fine champagne like carbonation from the bottle conditioning. The light color on the pour shows itself in the aroma and the flavor. This is decidedly light in body for the style yet rather pleasant. Drinkabillity is consistent with the overall presentation by the brewery. A good but not great beer, and not the best from the brewery."
"Drinkability: Nothing stands out on this beer. Very plain dubbel"
"D - This is a very good dubbel. Nice flavors and relatively easy drinking."
"Pours a Mahogany-brown with a large sandy head and some lacing. As others have noted, not much on the nose. Mouthfeel is good, but not great. Hoppier than other beers of this style. Finish is a tiny bit bitter with some alcohol present on the tongue. Overall slightly disappointing. Wouldn't buy again as there are similarly priced Dubbels which are more satisfying. Not bad though."
"As far as the taste, I can see why this beer gets so many ""B" ratings. It has a very standard Dubbel taste. Maybe even a little muted compared to some. Still tastes good though and is easily drinkable. I don't know if I would get this again, most likely would try a new Dubbel."
"Pours a leather couch brown with a thin tan head (poured in chalice) that died quickly with no lace. A yeasty, orange smell with some other fruits that are tart and some faint caramel notes. Nutty, bready and full of yeast for a full-bodied puffiness. Has some sweet malt and tart fruit taste, along with hints of spice. Everything is noticeable but mild in a smooth, easy-going body. Not a powerful dubble or anything amazing, just a solid sessionable (to a point) dubbel."
"D: Nice drinking beer, really easy to drink, lacks a lot of the flavors of other dubbels though. Okay beer, but I don't think I'd recommend it to others."
"Mouthfeel/drinkability: Heavy carbonation and a light body. Not a bad beer but I wont be trying it again."
"Beer poured reddish brown with a decent long lasting head. Nose is hints of light fruits. Taste is carmel, toffee, apple, and pear. Mouthfeel is pretty good, not as velvety smooth as hoped. Drinkability is pretty good. This is a little different then what the style suggests as it almost seems like a crossing of a belgian (yeast strain used) and UK pale (hop characteristics) beer."
"D'ability - Not overpowering, and finishes fairly dry. If you can afford it (~$9/ 750 mL bottle), probably pretty drinkable."
"D: big herbal and floral notes throughout. Sort of an interesting brew with a good Belgian vibe...not tops marks, but not bad"
"OVERALL: An interesting one. The herbal qualities sets this one apart, making it a unique and interesting version of the style. It could use a stronger nose and a more pronounced aftertaste, but the herbal qualities makes it one to ponder non-the-less. One worth picking up for sure. Recommended."
"D: very good, easy to drink for a dubbel"
"affligem dubbel is the perfect beer for any semi formal get together. its label is beautiful and for its price it is a very good beer that will also get you ""feeling it"" quite nicely. i bought the affligem dubbel and trippel for a new years party and it was a big hit. you can also find it in alot of stores and its usually worth its price. great beer."
"BB 21/08/10, foamed at the neck on opening? Generous creamy tan head, lots of lacing. Colour is a hazy, light brown with flashes of dark red. Smell is caramel, toffee. Taste is layers of caramel and malt puncutated by sour dark fruit, mincemeat tart, figs. With air, the sourness is more dramatic and the malt finish comes to predominate more as well, but not necessarily in a good way. Smooth mouthfeel, high sour notes, abrupt malty finish, fruit seriously understated ... somehow it doesn't seem to work here for me. I do think it's consistent with the style, just not my favouite example of it."
"Drinkability - Not too bad, but the light mouthfeel and slightly sour taste take away from it overall..."
"D - This was your standard Dubbel, a very good beer that will fill your gut, a good example of the style"
"D: Very drinkable. The mild flavors, smooth textures and moderate 7% ABV make this an all-around tasty but not extreme in any way beer."
"Turbid,caramel colored body with a massive foamy toffee head that lasts forever. Rich, dark fruit and champagne yeast in the aroma with toasted grain. Tastes of raisins and dark cherries balanced with a dry yeasty quality. The mouthfeel is my favorite thing about this brew, very effervesent carbonation that makes it a treat to drink. A very approachable example of the style."
"Pours a cloudy dark amber, thin head which quickliy dissapates. Faint aroma of malt. taste is slightly tinny at first but full on finish. Malty sweetness is present. Decent drinkability for this class. Smooth mouthfeel. Not my favorite dubbel but not all that bad either."
"D: An alright drink but would probably rank it low on my list for dubbels."
"D - Very drinkable. I would purchase this one again."
"I'm really impressed with the dubbel; very drinkable, intense and complex flavor that is well balanced and not at all overpowering. I could handle a few of these back to back without being bored. The price (7.44) was spot on too! Drink it."
"A beer that goes down extremely easily - that's what Affligem Dubbel is. I could drink this all night, and would undoubtedly pay the price the next day. Certainly, it's a fine beer to unwind to after work while watching an old Humphrey Bogart DVD."
"D - I would recommend this beer to a freind."
"D:"
"MD&D - very smooth and crisp, I would call this a good medium bodied (though it is most likely tipping the scales) beer"
"It's full bodied, but doesn't really drink like a full-bodied beer, if you catch my drift. The carbonation is on the medium side but that's not a complaint, it fits. Has a very smooth mouthfeel. It balances spicy/sweet outstandingly. The drinkability suffers a little bit because the alcohol is not masked very well and it kind of takes away from the actual brew. But nevertheless, a must-try for any dubbel fan."
"D- It realy is one of my all time favorities.The price does keep me away from ordering it all the time, but I will get it for my next special holiday."
"D: Pretty drinkable, but my one complaint is that it foamed out of the bottle and we lost some of it and it took a long time for the beer to settle."
"I had an Affligem on tap at a bar in Paris a couple weeks ago on the recommendation of the guy at the next stool. It was served in a nice chalice glass with the Affligem logo. It had a bright lemmony nose and held a good half inch head. The taste was crisp and dry with a great balance of hops and malt. Paris is not a good beer town but as long as I can find one of these I'm not ordering wine."
"Drinkability: This is a fantastic tasting beer worth enjoying on nice occasions or with dinner. Definitely something worth taking your time and enjoying."
"I'm looking forward to reviewing the trippel tomorrow night"
"Overall, it's a not-very-complex, easy to drink, enjoyable beer."
"I enjoyed this beer, it was the first beer from Affligem since I had the Blonde. Of course the blonde I happened to love....Alot. THis one was a pretty hearty beer, good taste, not too bad decent smell. This beer would go great with almost any meal. Yum."
"The other components of the beer are typical, but let this beer settle in your mouth, and the real flavor begins to come out. Substantial, but not quite impressive."
"The aroma is quite nice with candy sugar, yeast, toasted malt, dark fruit, and alcohol. The appearance is hazy brown with a fairly large head. The flavor is like the aroma but more bitter than it needs to be. The palate is thin and the aftertaste is bitter from what seem like tannins. I am not that in love with this one."
"Very active, extremely foamy. Pours a dark brown, with a medium body. Pours a huge head is a very light brown color. Very flowery aroma, with some malts. Very malty taste, somewhat flowery, and acidic. Malty aftertaste. Just an okay tasting beer."
"On a final note: Overall, a decent Dubbel albeit not a prototypical one, as it lacks a more subtle and sober aroma and taste profile of nuts and chocolate. Dark fruits aroma and taste should be less dominating of the overall beer character. Reminds me of Verboden Vrucht / Fruit Defendu. Not overly impressed, will not be seeking this in the near future."
"I had this on tap at an Affligem cafe (at least it seemed this was the name of the cafe) in Brussels, right in the Grote Markt. My God but there cannot be many locations more perfect than this to sample a Belgian beer. The beer was listed as a bruin, but I'm guessing it's the dubbel. It was was brown and mostly opaque or maybe darkly translucent. The smell was malty nearly to a fault, possibly a little one-dimensional. The taste was possibly more like a brown ale or a Belgian dark ale than dubbel, not that it's a bad thing. I savored the moment as the location was ideal, but eventually moved on to better beers in poorer quarters in the city."
"D: Drinkability was decent but falls just short of good due to its limited complexity and layering. A rather safe entry and a tad boozy and fizzy but well deserving of a try."
"Very clean, dumbed-down version of the style. Not a bad beer by any means but not worth $5.99."
"Overall: to tell the truth I expected more from Affligem Dubbel. Certainly it was a nice experience but not a great one. In short an enjoyable but not top of the notch Abbey Beer."
"A 750ml bottle poured into a goblet. Hazy orange/brown color with a thick white head that retained well. A fruity aroma, as well as a little caramel. Fruity taste, sweet, and somewhat yeasty. I enjoyed this beer quite a bit, and thought it was a bargain at $5.95 a bottle."
"A nice all around winner! You could pay more for a dubbel and with the price of gas....why! I like the fruity esters and with dubbels the amber and copper tints in my wine class almost fool my wine-o old man. I'm trying to get the afternoon old schoolers to try some nice beers instead of the vino. This Affligem might be the ticket!"
"Nice label, nice heavy bottle. A decent mahogany color tinted with ruby; looks nice when held against a light. The head disappeared very quickly and left very little behind on the glass. Poured into a chalice, the aroma was nicely concentrated but didn't deliver much: some peachy apples and something akin to wet wood. The taste was not as complex as I expected from a dubbel, leaving behind flavors of mushrooms and cola. Not much of a challenge. Overall, nothing spectacular but was worth trying."
"I believe the progression goes something like: 'get macro lager drinkers onto Stella, from Stella onto Leffe, and from Leffe onto Affligem."" I would think this Affligem is good enough to entice them to keep going from here..."
"Out of a 750ml corked and caged bottle. Opened with a bang, cork went flying across the kitchen; scared the crap out of my wife, who at the time was talking about how she hates when ballons pop, oops. Anywho, pours a fairly clear ruby brown color with an average head that dissipated into a light ring. The aroma is kind of faint for a dubbel, not picking much up except a light pruney smell. The taste is disappointing. The dubbel has a slight wine like grape characteristic and some light Belgian spice. The feel seems way off base for a dubbel. It is tart not velvety, no malt characteristics are popping through. The feel is moderate with appropriate carbonation. The finish is just wrong to me, way too tart and astringent. A sub par dubbel. The taste and feel seem to be really off."
"Served in a Chimey chalice. The beer pours a deep reddish brown, forming a medium 1/2 inch off-white head. Very little spots of lace slide down the glass. The aroma begins with a noticeable malt presence, followed by a sweet dark fruit and alcohol aroma, with spices mixed throughout. The taste is dark fruit flavor up front, followed by the malt sweetness, and ending with a hint of alcohol. Not the most complex tasting Belgian, but not bad. Good medium mouthfeel. For a dubble, this is very drinkable, but not as flavorful as others. For the price, this is a very affordable Belgian Dubble. Overall, not quite what I would expect from a dubble, but nonetheless still a good beer. Worth a try."
"My favorite part, actually, is the bottom-of-the-bottle yeasty ""dregs"" -- brings out a nice nutty quality, and more pronounced cooked apples. Very good with sweet seafood-in-cream-sauce pasta."
"This abbey ale poured a very hazy dark brown with a lot of tan head. Its smell was a balanced mix of caramel, yeast and hops. It tasted much the same, sweet with a long aftertaste of malt and only a little bitterness. The texture was thin and slightly carbonated. Overall it was a nice sipping beer, but could have been better."
"On the whole, this is a nice Belgian dubbel, but nothing to knock the socks off. I am far more partial to Westamalle's or Chimay's offerings, for starters, for better wares from Belgium. However, this is nothing to swat off the table. It just needs--more."
"Another decent one from a fairly under-appreciated brewery."
"Affligem Blonde was a great beer - a very good depiction of the style, and the brewery's version of a Dubbel is about authentic as you can get... pours a wonderful, dark-brown hue with impressive foamy, frothy head with some staying power... From a 750 ML bottle bought caged and corked from Total Wine and More in West Orange, this Dubbel has a nice aroma of prunes, dark fruits, and dark Belgian sugars... taste strongly complements the aroma, with fresh figs, sweet candy, sugars, slight vanilla, and a heavy malt factor... The mouthfeel was good but slightly bland for the style, otherwise, the drinkability was top-notch, went down as easily as possible with no bitterness or alcohol detected... perilously drinkable, no problem downing this one at all... Overall, a very good beer, great stuff, although there are better examples of the style..."
"Still, a nice beer. Very drinkable."
"Superb and easy to drink. Have only seen these as a part of the four pack with the glass (which is where I got this, as a gift), but wouldn't mind seeing them in singles or four packs at a good price."
"Very drinkable, with alcohol well-covered. A nice brew to pair with pot pie."
"Affligem is one of my favorite breweries and one of the classic breweries in belgium. This dubbel pours a dark brown as it should and has just the right amount of carbonation, with a decent head that fades slowly. The taste is quickly more nutty than most dubbels, this could be due to disruption of the lees, but i found it quite appetizing. smooth feel in the mouth and goes down smooth, a good beer with a steak or nutty chocolate."
"I enjoyed this Dubbel the most out of the three beers I have tried from Affligem (Dubbel, Triple and Blonde)."
"This is an OK Dubbel but it lacks some robustness and has way too much alcohol presence for a 7% beer. Try it if you like Dubbels."
"A good brew, classy and enjoyable...but not earth shaking."
"Reviewed 11-14-2007, translated from french 1-12-2008"
"D - Great. I was going to offer some to my roommate, but I found myself drinking all of it before I realized. It is a fairly sweet beer, but nothing close to cloying or oppressive. I would not mind having this again. In fact, I might buy it again to use as a Belgian sample among people who claim to ""dislike"" beer."
"Beautiful crystal clear deep ruby in hue, covered by a persistent, thick, light beige head that leaves loose lace. A quick waft of solvent - like fusels in aroma is immediately ensued by bright, citrusy fruit w/ a hint of spruce. The initial impression aromawise is that of Pine Sol, but as the beer breathes, hints of raisiny Special B and light chocolate malt provide contrast and depth. Yeast derived contributions in aroma are virtually absent, w/ bubblegum present only at a trace. In flavor, a snap of cider like tartness is perceived at first, then mellows into a somewhat understated combination of chocolate, dark, ripe fruity prune and vinous notes of fermented grapes w/ a pine undertone. Yeast esters flavorwise are very mild, and mirror the light bubblegum in aroma. Very dry, well attenuated and correspondingly light in body, w/ a spritzy mouthfeel from the high carbonation. (The mouthfeel was downright seltzer like and prickly for the first few minutes) Finishes dry, clean and a touch bland w/ a hint of yeast must. A bit of a dissappointment. Affligem Dubbel lacked complexity overall and was too ""clean"" and neutral esterwise. It was as if they fermented this brew with a neutral American ale yeast at a high temperature."
"D - I think I maybe able to sip on these all night long...well until I pass out as this 7% ABV will catch up with ya!"
"What wasn't impressive was the taste. It has a very metallic feel and taste. It is appropriately sweet and bubbly, but it's very hard to get past the metallic taste."
"Drinkability: Glad I decided to re-visit a fresh bottle in 2011 as I moved all of my ratings up a half point or more; a pretty decent dubbel, after all"
"From my notes 6/4/2007 pours one-finger white head that fades quickly to a thin layer leaving a trace lace. Mahogany color. Malty nose. Good carbonation and medium bodied. Flavor is sweet malt and raisin. Best by Feb 17, 2009. 3.95 ($5.41) for a 330ml bottle from Novotel Irish Pub Amsterdam, NL."
"have top notch expectations of Dubbels; at least a rating of 9/10 perhaps? :)"
"The cork came off of this one like a bullet from a gun. It foamed very aggressively but calmed down pretty quickly to form a nice off white head on a cloudy bubbly red body. The aroma is classic malty belgian funk. The taste is very smooth initially and then there is a blast of malt with a lingering bitterness on the end. There are some dark fruits in there as well. It is a good medium bodied beer, but I would like it a bit fuller. Overall, I'm not that impressed with this beer."
"From a corked 750 ml bottle. Pours a cloudy dark brown color with a pretty lively tan head that subsided slowly. Aroma was quite malty but also had a lot of spice in the nose. Taste was chocolatey and spicy as well. I could pick up on flavors of cinammon, anise and pepper. Could it be the hops contributing to the spicy flavors? Body was light to medium. This packs a lot of taste for a relatively low alcohol Dubbel. I had no problem finishing the bottle and it's priced well to boot. Recommended."
"Corked and caged 750ml bottle. Poured into a St. Bernardus chalice. Pours a murky brownish ruby color with a light tan head that leaves a good amount of lacing around the edge of the glass. The aroma is slightly sweetened malt, yeast and a bit of a nuttiness to it as well. The taste is very malty and semi-sweet with some spices lingering in the background and a dry and bitter finish. Overall, this is certainly not a bad dubbel. There are some other dubbels out there to choose from, but I did enjoy this one and would certainly consider buying again. Recommended."
"from the bottle corked and caged. poured a cloudy garnet with a nice foamy light khaki head that left some good lacing. aroma malts, caramel, and I swear thin mint, yeast, brown sugar, toasty. flavor, cherry, malts yeast, sour fruits, metallic , sugar. after drinking half the bottle I shook it up and poured the yeast in the only thing that I could pick up that was different was got a nutty flavor. good beer"
"Drinkability- It's not wretched, but I won't be buying another bottle anytime soon. The over-carbonation tends to masks a lot of the more subtle flavors."
"The beer poured as a beautiful brownish amber color; very colloidal. The smell was terrific with hints of fruit maybe cherry. The taste was strong at first, but settled down as it sat for awhile. The flavor was very good compared to many of the dubbels I have tried. Overall it was one of my favorite dubbels."
"Cheers!"
"All in all, the smell makes this one a winner. Beautiful and deep, good luck keeping your nose out of the glass as it's on the table. The taste is a bit of a jolt, but it has to be appriciated for it's ability to convey such strong flavours with little to no body. Highly recommend this one paired with very, very dark chocolate or very gamey cheese. Challenges you, leaves you wanting more."
"Again with my trusty Duvel tulip glass in hand and this time with a roaring fire in the hearth, I popped the cork of the 750 bottle of this belgian dubbel. Lovely chestnut brown color with a tannish, sturdy and thick head. Lace hugged the glass throughout the session although the head thinned with each sip. Lots of apples in the nose, along with raisens, dried prunes, and a hint of hazelnuts. Mellow, slightly carbonated mouthfeel with dried fruit that lingers through to the finish. Ripe prunes, dired fruit, again apples and some pears in the mouth. More chestnutty flavor and walnuts than in the aroma. Modest alcohol, so minimal warmth as it goes down. Very drinkable Belgian and one woth revisiting."
"Looks a ruddy, reddish brown with a very dense, very persistant creamy tan head. Smells of raisins and prunes, with a sharp tangy note. Taste is chocolate up front, with dried fruit afterwards. The finish is crisp and brings back all the stuff that the smell promised up front. Very refreshing! Mouthfeel is well carbonated, silky with a dry finish. Maybe a touch too dry but it offsets the silkiness nicely. The drinkability is good, although the dry finish may limit it a bit. Still, a very nice offering. Good complexity, a nice balance of flavors and textures. A beer to make you think. A beer to make you appreciate the monastic arts."
"It's been a few years since I last had an Affligem Double, but I don't remember it being this bland to the taste. Everything else about it is interesting. Weird. I'll buy another bottle later and resample it to make sure it's consistent."
"It's a nice beer, but overall just an average Dubbel. The smell is probably the best thing about this beer; the somewhat static and monolithic taste gets a bit boring, however. If you're a fan of Belgian beers, it's certainly worth a try. But if you're looking for a Dubbel (or just a darker Belgian-style beer), you'd be better off trying a Trappist or even a Unibroue."
"Taste begins with a puckering sourness that is followed by a nuttiness that borders on soapiness. Alcohol comes next, followed by a bit of cloying sweetness and an odd sawdust-like flavour in the finish. This is not what I expected from the nose, much less complex and bordering on boring or even annoying (if that can be applied to a beer). Mouthfeel is surprisingly thin and carbonation seems a bit high, drying in the finish. There's no way I'd want more than one of these, the cloying and dare I say cheap taste is very off-putting, I'm a little disappointed."
"Mouthfeel is rather thin and extremely bubbly. Too much so for my taste. I had to swirl my beer around to release some excess gasses. Overall, an okay beer, but not the best for the style. An equally available (of perhaps more so) bottle of Chimay Red would win in a dubble contest anyday."
"A solid dubbel, and I look forward to trying the tripel that also came in the gift pack."
"drinkability - it rocked"
" Wavz"
"Bottom line: A pretty darned good Dubbel that's not too hard on the wallet.(US$6.990 from Liquorama) I recommend it."
"Just a below average Dubbel, there are many more Dubbels that just blow this one away. Slightly recommended."
"Very slightly cloudy orange/bronze/brown colour with a slightly off-white head with loosely knit bubbles. Smell is sweet malt. Some stewed fruit, a bit of chocolate, and honestly, a bit of honey, as well. Lovely smell. Taste is more of the same. Very smooth with a bit of honey in the taste. Lots of maltiness, as well. Mouthfeel is lighter than one would be led to believe, and there is a nice level of carbonation present. I am glad I took the time to revisit this one. I'll be buying it a bit more regularly."
"Poured into a Chimay chalice, the beer is a hazy dark brown (increased by later yeast pour). The slight head is comprised of mostly surface lacing, which still manages to leave some nice lacing. Smells of wine-like acidity, and caramel. No yeast in the nose. Tastes of cocoa, caramel, vinousness. Very sour at first, which makes me wonder if the bottle is a loss. I persevere, and find that the acid recedes with warming, improving the overall flavor. The mouthfeel is somewhat thin, but retains very nice carbonation, especially for its age. Very warming. Drinkability is average - the acidity, even as it warmed, detracted the most this, I think. The smell was lackluster too, but not as important to the taste. Still, this ale paired nicely with some venison put through the Jamaican jerk treatment."
"Mouth: Lightly sour, like grape skins, black pepper, and unfortunately a bit metallic, as if it were coming from a can. It's not extremely unpleasant, but it definitely doesn't help at all. No hop presence - this seems all malt to me. Excellent mouthfeel though: nice and strong."
"(I had this beer on-tap and from a bottle and both times I was quite unimpressed.)"
"Overall a quality offering from Affligem."
"Smells of sweet fruits and grass. Some anis in the background. The brownish foam is thick and creamy and the color is dark copper brown red. The taste is a bit of a surprise compared to the leads in the smell. Basically it's hoppy and alcoholic. Some sugar and licorice spinning inside. Quite a full mouthfeel with high carbonation. A fine beer."
"A bit of molasess on the nose. Maybe some dates (which, incidently are almost the exact color of this brew). Tastes of malts, molasses, dates, and an odd bit of citrus. A nicely complicated brew, without any of the odd metallic or astringent flavors that seem to plague this style. One of the more drinkable Dubbels I've had lately."
"Taste was a bit of a disappointment, there was the obvious burned malts and the alcohol that came through. I tasted some peppery and nutmeg, this is a new taste for me. Could this be due to the addition of coloring agents? I feel that this is somewhat an artificial taste, there is probably not even crystal malt in here. Lately I have discovered that a lot of the Dubbels are not more than colored blond beer. Not enough depth and complexity and lacking caramel taste, which is an essential taste in a good Dubbel!"
"Raisin and malt aromas are up front on the nose of this copper-brown ale, with the definite aroma of alcohol there as well. This boozy smell adds a new facet that I like a lot. The flavors are of malt and minerals, along with raisin and light dried fruit, which also features in the aftertaste. This Dubbel is quite good."
"Opinion: This beer is really rich and malty. Not like this is a bad thing, and I am glad that it isnt a fruit basket in a bottle. I think that the toastiness is a bit too much for the overall balance, and I believe that the beer can actually use an adjunct or Pilsner malt to cut the edge a little. I would like to try this beer on tap to see what a difference that would make, but this beer would have to be served fresh as this malt bill would suffer from oxidation. Not a bad beer by any means."
"All in all I think this is a good brew, but I'd have to be in the mood for something sweet in order to crack another of these open. A fine substitution for a Captain and Coke, is this."
"[added later: I got a bottle sent to me from a friend in Belgium. Not sure what the difference was in terms of freshness or date bottled, but this one was much mellower and brought out the earthy and rum-soaked raisin characteristics better. Was it fresher, or aged longer? Either way, it was better than any Affligem I bought in the states.]"
"This has been aged for a couple years, the age really helped the blond but not so much with this dubbel. Pours a clear ruby brown, big brown head forms, super lacing, some of the most amazing I've ever seen. Smell is malty, chocolate, some citrus, quite vinous. Taste is chocolate, very malty, with citrus, caramel, sour/acidic finish, very malty though. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with low carbonation and a thin finish."
"This is a good warmer, though maybe not an all-nighter."
"Drinkability/notes: A decent example of the style, although the flavors clash more than they harmonize. Not the best Dubbel, but not bad."
"Drinkability: All around a well done beer. Balanced though still on the sweet side. Pairs well with lamb and left over Thanksgiving stuffing."
"This is a very nice looking dark amber with a thick ivory colored head. The smell is great, very fruity and sweet smelling. The taste is great as well. Fruity with vanilla and a wine like flavor. A bit of yeast as well. The mouthfeel is good. Drinkability is pretty good, it is definitely enjoyable."
"Slightly hazed ruby/brown colour with a fine, light brown head. Some lacing was evident. Aromas of bready yeast, caramel, dried fruit. Malt sweetness dominates, but there's a harsh burnt bitterness in the finish that really lingers. Ample fruit and caramel with a hint of spice. The texture was fair, maybe a bit creamy, with the carbonation providing some lift without being coarse. Moderate body, fairly high attenuation, and a hint of alcohol warmth."
"D: Digestable, as a dubbel should be... The burnt flavour keeps me from wanting another..."
"My father seems to think this beer was ""off""; the sediment was certainly a little unnerving but is often harmless. If it was ""off", it was not proper but certainly still enjoyable. I appreciated it, although I don't think it is an incredibly special beer."
"An surprisingly simple Dubbel, this one."
"Dark brown in colour. Very aromatic, with all of the spicy, yeasty, bubblegum, fig, and dark fruit (perhaps plum and raisin) aromas that youd expect from this style. The flavors were a bit of a letdown. The initial malt presence was good and there was some nice dried fruit notes in there too, but the body was quite thin and there was a slightly astringent bitter finish. Was the carbonation supposed to be this high?"
"The taste is bold, with almost more balls than it has, at 7%, it tastes like it has more. It's lighter than other dubbels but the taste is still well layered. Good malty cream finish, and for under 6 bucks!!?? Buck for buck, this is the iron hammer of Belgium beer."
"Smooth yet textured mouth. At 7% abv, this could rank as a good session brew."
"Here's a pretty common Belgian. It's good, but pretty average. My mom got me this for a present and by no means is it a bad beer in any way. Just not that complex. However right now i'm pairing it with some cheese's which knocks the taste up to a 4.5 . Really. Which i why with this review i won't really bother describing the beer as others have done that. This my i can't believe how much the cheese changes the beer post. Some simple goganzola was amazing with this, as were some limburger and french blue cheese. But the gorganzola paired best."
"I have gobbled many of these and they get better with each brew...the only problem is the price....oh well."
"taste is a bit more balanced, rye-like spiciness meets a hop bitterness over rock candy. sweet with banana, apricots and some darker fruit. a great dubbel for $6/750. a bit too christmasy in its spice but a wonderful exercise in the style for those who love it.. something approaching a session dubbel. closest belgian to ommegang abbey IMO."
"Large bottle, caged and corked, opened with quite a bit of energy being released. Pours murky/cloudy and chocolate in color. Lifts a long lasty puffy, dark tan head and leaves nicely developed and long lasting lacing. Nose is chocolate, raisins and rum. Flavorful and enjoyable dubbel, notes of more chocolate, pleanty of rum raisins, cafe au lait, cloves, candi sugars etc, a very drinkable and moderatly complex dubbel. Widely available and well worth a try."
"Very drinkable for the style."
"I was surprised that there was not more of a crispness to this beer but overall a good beer."
"Served from a 750ml brown, caged and corked bottle. This poured out a very hazy brown with a super-condensed creamy head that would not disappear. It reminded me of something out of a nitro-can. The aroma had lots of malt with a strong raisin back. The taste mimmicked the raisin aroma and there was a really dry finish. I don't want to critique this beer beyond this glass because I have a feeling that this is a bad bottle. Overall, since I am not a huge veteran of dubbels this one will make me steer clear of this style for a little bit."
"From a corked 750 ml bottle, this beer poured a cloudy, murky, rust-brown. The moderately sized head has a tan color and, and nice density. A mellow, mild aroma of tart yeastiness and peppery phenols was immediately noticed. Theres a little alcohol present as a background aroma, but overall the smell is faint and easy-going. The taste is fruity, with a solid malt foundation. Its a little sweet up front, but a tartness kicks in by the mid-taste. Finishes with a biting peppery finish. I enjoyed it, but expected more. I think this was mediocre, as far as Belgian ales go."
"The beer is pleasant, but not great."
"Bought along with an Affligem goblet gift pack, it was only available around these parts that way. Poured from a 330 ml euro-style brown bottle, 6.8% abv listed, best before date: 24 09 06. A massive pillar of spongy off-white head on the pour, large bubbles, went above and beyond the rim of the chalice, just kept rising. Serious head retention, some sticky traces of lacing here and there. The body is a deep mahogany, yet while held to the light it is a gorgeous cherry oak, intense carbonation action. Orange and coriander greet the nose at first, along with a mild malt backbone and some candy sweetness, along with rum soaked cherries and raisins. The alcohol presence is also apparent, it bombards the eyes while inhaling. Mouthfeel is light and effervescent, but watery at times, lacking in body. The flavour is incredibly mild, I was expecting so much more from the strong aroma, the malt tip-toeing through the tulips in the middle, most of the taste appears towards the finish, a rum raisin character with light fruit esters, and a wave of alcohol on the aftertaste. A light and smooth dubbel for the abv%, but flavour-wise it's more of a dud. Perhaps it's better caged and corked. But for now I won't be seeking out any more of this in the 330 ml bottle."
"Cork date of 2/03. Medium dullish brown with translucent highlights and very light sedimentation. Head rises to 1/2 an inch, lays mostly flat with some small divits. Laces in large primary rings with some drips. Cherry aromas, slight allspice and raisin. Mouthfeel is lightish, higher than expected carbonation. Flavor impression is fairly ordinary, sweet pear juice, brief impression of cocoa, slight vegetal leafiness and a bit of fizziness that seems a little wrong. Lightly astringent at the close, lemony. This beer has a reputation of as being typical of the style, I think Steve Beaumont features it in his ""Premium Beer Drinker's Guide", but to me, its not as satisfying as I was hoping when I picked it up (last Summer, I think)."
"75 cl cork and caged bottle lacking a best before dating, however it is the new label so I know it is reasonably fresh. Pours a deep chocolaty brown color with a modest tan head. Surprisingly, a lot of hops shine through in this dubbel as well as some pear-like fruit esters and a cocoa-like malt profile. Sweetness and dryness are at a tug-of-war. Healthy carbonation. Lots of muted hoppiness mixed in with the dark roasted malts and candi sugars. It's 7% shows in the mouthfeel, it comes across as a bit thin. Strange how the alcohol seems to poke through in a beer with a lower ABV. Not really a world-class dubbel, but an enjoyable one nonetheless."
"Mouthfeel: Full and creamy. A wonder and tasty beer that would be great for desert."
"Pours a dark caramel-brown with a heavy offwhite head. Smell is strong on the lightly roasted malts, and smells of caramel, toasted rye, and apples. The taste starts out with caramel and malt, and becomes vastly more complex as the ale warms, hinting of apple, plum, with sweet overtones that balance out the bitterness of the hops. The mouthfeel is great - perfectly peppery and smooth. These are injuriously drinkable, as they taste great and go down smoothly."
"Old recipe, new equipment-- worked out better than okay."
"Drinkable but....zzz.."
"With the strong yeast presence, however, it makes me wonder how this would be cellared. I believe I'll do that, and write another review in a year or two..."
"Pleasant brew. Orange brown appearance, nice looking Belgium (sorry for redundancy). Fruity appetite inducing yeast aroma. Medium-full mouthfeel. Satisfying malty aftertaste. Good though not outstanding. Fresh smooth with graininess. 10% ABV you say?"
"The taste was short to the malts and then a hoppy green apple like presence. However, the over powering sence of alcohol was dominent."
"Poured a gorgeous ruby red, with a cream coloured, fluffy thick head. Excellent retention, thick film of foam on the side of the glass, and thick layer of foam atop the beer. One of the best I've ever seen from a bottle. Aroma of toffee and slight malt. Taste is subtle. Nothing too spectacular. Just a steady dubbel that does the job. Dark fruit, malt, caramel, toasty. Bubbly smoothness. Well carbonated. Decent beer."
"Drinkable, but not memorable. Preferable to the Affligem Blonde."
"A nice brew, better than the blond version. Thick and round taste thats well balanced and nice."
"Drinkability: i like this quite a bit. good complexity and great balance. not as sweet as some Dubbels which i liked."
"The dubbel pours from the 330ml bottle an almost ruby coloured dark red. Very rich and full looking. The head, light brown, leaves screen lacing, or a circle of foam. The head is large bubbled at first, but becomes very creamy after a few minutes. The beer is translucent but substantially thick looking. The aroma, like Affligem's blond, is salty, with some sourness. Besides some more malt, I get very little difference between this and their blond ale. Roasted red malt aromas, aromatic spices, seasoning salt, and a hard water smell. Roasted nuts. A sour finish, like sweet bread. Red malt up front, and in the middle is the perfume taste. The phenols are there more obviously, though this is the exact same alcohol content as the blond. The subdued hops, noticeable in the aroma, are almost non-existent in the taste. The finish is dry, like barbeque sauce and spices. The lees, dark and caramel coloured, were sour and sweeter than the beer. This has a little more carbonation than the blond, which is in its favour. A little more watery than I expected, and not much of a change from their blond ale; though it does have more flavour. Above average drinkability for a dubbel. A malty offering. (Note: the 750 ml corked and caged version of the dubbel pours with a monstrous head with better retention. It is also somewhat sour, and less malty than the 330ml version. )"
"I taste oak and cedar; Milk chocolate malt balls, dark chocolate covered cherries with a splash of ouzo, and a scratch-n-sniff still-life of button mushrooms on the wall."
"This beer pours a dark burgundy brown and produces a big foamy head which is lasting and results in some lacing. The smell is a combination of spice, fruit and dark chocolate. The taste is very good with dark chocolate, coffee, and fruity notes. Slight bitterness resulted in the finish. Mouthfeel is tingly and well-balanced. Overall, one I'd drink again."
"Drinkability: All in all, a very nice Dubbel, although hardly a daily beverage of choice"
"Half an inch worth of tightly packed, tiny beige bubbles sit atop the glass of mahogany liquid. Not much cling or lacing, but the head is bolstered by some very strong streamers. Beer is on the thin side in viscosity and sports good clarity. Smells slightly vinous and a touch sour right after opening the bottle. Out of the glass, pleasant light chocolate and almond are displaced by an off-putting smell of adhesive bandages. Nosefeel is so light as to be barely noticeable. Pouring the yeast helps to fortify the nuttiness and body, but it's just too little too late, I'm afraid. Individually, the flavors are quite nice: candy-apple sweetness at the tip of the tongue develops into a body of vinous dried cherry and butterscotch (accompanying the Band-Aid), with warmth bringing out peanut and rum raisin. However, the profile is odd--uncomposed--the flavors string out but don't tie back together. Mouthfeel is only slightly too thin but the extreme carbonation hits the palate like cola; crisp with a touch of oil. Good balance of buzz to soothing drinkability. Any flaws here aren't enough to totally defeat the brew; the worst aspect is probably its outlandish price tag."
"On to the Dubbel, this is more my style than the Blond. Poured a mahogany red with a light tan head that had the same wonderful lacing and thickness of the Blond. No sediment, even when held up to the light. Smell was fruity and biscuity, very good. Taste had a great deal of roasted malts, with a bit of tangy fruit as well. The finish was dry and a little hoppy, glad to taste some hops in an Abbey ale. Mouthfeel was crisp and lighter than expected. The is one to savour for a bit, the Tripel awaits."
"Thanks to Jim for the birthday present!"
"Open up a affligem dubbel! Good & clear apearance after pooring it in my my favorite oval trappistglas. Nice& lasting foam with over it a green flowery smel in a nice maltfield that has been roasted for a bit. Makes you feel OK on these days and the warmth that this dubbel gives in the taste heatens the engine up again! Good and clean bitterness thats there but not to overwelming. So altogether in my eyes a more than decent Dubbel."
"The flavor was of a rich musty malt-based beer, with some slight sweetness. It was warming, as their other beers are as well. Finished well. Very good, but again, not their best offering. I preferred the tripel much more, even though I usually prefer darker beers."
"Best before 11/16/02, pours muddy brown with a huge light brown head that leaves a sticky lacing in my glass. Fruity, yeasty aromas, caramel, chocolate, cherry and plum flavors. Medium to full bodied finishes with a funky sourness. Not what I expected, don't think I would buy another bottle."
"Not offensive though."
"Great beer but will try others over having this one again. I think this is partially due to not drinking many Dubbels and therefore not knowing what to look for in the style."
"Overall a simple classic belgian dubbel. I could drink this stuff every day, it may not be the most in your face dubbel, but thats what makes it great. Just a simple session dubbel."
"Pours a pretty brown color with the tiniest of port colors in the edges of the glass. Medium aroma and a mdeium sized off-white/ten head. Aroma is of dates, plums, and sweetness. The flavor is very nice, with a lot of malty bready reminders of date nut bread- cinnimon and nutmeg in the corners. Very smooth, with nice mouthfeel and high drinkability. A keeper!"
"A good, but not spectacular Belgian ale."
"Thick, beige head. Dark brown/orange beer with red highlights. Malt in the nose, with tangy, sour apples, rum, toffee, plums. A Christmas dessert of a beer. Dark caramel and rum in the tangy front. Deep caramel foamy middle with a dry, vinous finish. Toasted grains. Almost a little woody. This is a great, dark, caramel, fruity dubbel."
"Pour a nice dark brown/ruby in color with a moderately sized, fairly creamy tan head. Nice, durable lacing down the glass. The nose is floral and slightly chocolately, though rather weak overall. Flavor starts sweet, highlighting bready malts lightly spiced with cinnamon. Develops a bit of pruny fruitiness mid-palate, and ends with a bit of floral/herbal hop. Aftertaste is just slightly sour. Creamy mouth and pleasantly warming, with a low enough ABV to down the whole 750ml in one sitting. Not a terribly *deep* beer, but a undeinably solid one. Tasty and quite drinkable -- enjoy it with a meal and turn your non-BA friends on to some real beer."
"This one pours a dark red/light brown color. The nose is weak but kind of fruity sweet. The taste is very balanced. But not much complexity here. The flavors seem like they could go deeper. Raisins and fig-like malts. Slight tart fruit on the finish. And in between are some floral hops. This was a nice one to have but probably not worth the price."
"Overall Impression: Definitely one of my favorite Abbey dubbels. Maybe even better than some of the Trappists. To me, it has everything a dubbel should have: dark color, lots of phenolics, balanced sweetness, and not too heavy."
"Worth $6.49  Erm, NOPE!!!"
"Poured brown with a pretty decent-sized tan head that retained well. Aroma is very fruity. Particularly noticeable is lemon and citrus accents. There is also a great deal of malts in the nose. Taste is fruity as well. Plum, light citrus, some grape. Burnt toffee. Could hardly detect any hops. Medium-bodied. This is a pretty good dubbel. Not the best I've had, but very respectable none the less. Perfect for a crisp autumn night."
"I have a bottling date of 1/01 and best by date of 02/28/03, let's see about that. Appears: This one Pours with excess foam when I popped the cork it had some umphhh to it, the actual body appears a murky mahogany tone with a massive tan head very amazing due to the head retention and massive thick chunky head just very nice lacing comes in thick evenly dispersed patches beautiful. Aroma: Of the glass without sediment poured in, vinous grapes, sweet sharp tones, mellow apple notes very complex and full of esters from the fruit scented phenols produced in fermentation. Glass with sediment poured in, glass claims a nutty aromatic profile is created let's see if I can detect it a deeper mustier but fuller scent both are exquisite but this one seems to be more balanced with the fruit still in existence I believe the yeast helps aroma here try it both though ways that's just my opinion. Taste: No sediment glass, very smooth carbonation tiny bubbles raisin, over ripened fruits like apples or figs here nice belgian candy sugar here, overall very nice and refreshing. There is definitely a difference to the one without sediment this one seems more robust to the palate with fruit not stealing the show, caramel roasted malts and deeper specialty malts make up a small percentage of the sweetness here, but there is a nut edge on the yeast profile not so much bready as usual but a very almond like flavor arises nice. Mouthfeel: Fluffy, creamy, medium bodied but light on the palate dessert like indulge and enjoy to the fullest, this is a beer that you can't believe the best before date completely b/c it's still amazing well past the suggested date. Drinkability: One beer to indulge in one 750ml at a time and that's about it in my opinion but surely one I would like to experience again."
"Drinkability  This is an average Dubbel Ale. I had higher expectations after the pour, but it just didnt deliver. Good though nevertheless, just not sensational."
"This brew poured a light brown head of fine and medium sized bubbles that left a good lacing. It has a cloudy dark brown body and a strong raspberry aroma. It also has a strong raspberry taste and an acidic finish. Overall, this brew is just averagely impressive. I was more impressed by the unique packaging. I think it has been the only brew I have drank that was wrapped in a paper package and had a wire tied cork on the bottle."
"Poured crystal clear with an almost ruby body and tight tan head. The head was appropriatly thick, and lasted longer than the beer. Aroma was almost spicy with a hint of grape or rasin. Sweet and malty with a medium body and hopped just enough to balance the sweetness."
"750ml corked bottle: The beer pours a cloudy brown color with a hint of red in it. Large light tan head that lingers for awhile. Aroma is filled with candy sweetness, raisins and a slight hint of alcohol. Taste is very silky, with caramel and much malt sweetness. Medium to full bodied, and well balanced. Complex taste, almost wine-like. This is an exceptional dubbel."
"Pours a very dark amber color with a massive tall light tan colored head composed of many large bubbles that gradually burst allowing the head to dissipate in chucks and leave spider webs of lace across the glass making this resemble an exotic elixir that some sorcerer concocted. Nose is sweet candied fruit, crème de menthe, and spicy alcohol. Medium to full in body and very smooth and velvety in texture. Taste is sweet and fruity up front with some raisin notes followed by a flavor similar to chocolate covered cherries. Some notes of caramelized sugar and alcohol come across towards the finish. A very nice and complex Abbey Dubbel."
"Poured a soft brown and ruby color with a full finger of frothy head that settled well. Smell was full: of plums, grapes, whisky, and oak notes. Had an earthy core, though altogether a wine-like character - inviting. Taste was dark and highly woody, but also of grapes, a thin but good malt, and a citrus tinge. Had a light finish, softly dry and earthy, and developed a creamy cheese-like aftertaste that was strong with time. Watery mouthfeel, thus easy to drink but not terribly impressive."
"Pours a rich dark brown that has deep hints of redness. You almost can't see through this one. The head is tan, full and rich as shaving cream. The nose, while not strong, is sweet spicy malt with a tinge of alcohol. The head just won't die on this one. Very heavy carbonation that adds effervescence and continuously builds the head up. The flavor is just excellent! The hops are strong and aggressive while exceptionally well balanced to each other and the malt. The malt is mostly dry with a hint of fruit flavor and a spice that is just perfect. This is just a damn fine beer."
"Hazy amber brown with a tight tan head. Nose is very fragrant with a winey complex aroma. Smells of sherry, port and green grapes with some plums thrown in. Taste combines the above fruitiness with some candi sugar and Belgian hops. All kinds of things going on in this dubbel. Typical yeastiness with some background hoppy astringency to make things interesting. Moderate carbonation gives this dubbel a nice mouthfeel and a silky finish. A very nice brew that hangs in there well with it's Belgian buddies."
"Poured into a chalice from a 750ml bottle, the smell was immediately great. That is what I love about Belgians. The nose was so powerful and refined. The head remained thin but was prevalent throughout. Hints of lemon and raisin come through in the aromas. The original taste is quite nutty and full of fruity flavors. The beer is very warming as it makes its way to your stomach. The overall feeling of this Dubbel is cheer."
"A good dubbel, a fine enough drink, but far from great."
"Best By: 28-02-03"
"Enjoyed this beer before and during and after dinner with 750ml size. It had a nice head that hung aroung long enough and a nice color. The malty flavors were good and the full carbonation really opened this beer up but nothing really jumped out at me cause I was eating the whole time. It semmed to go well with everything, cheese and crackers, salad, pasta and even vanilla cookies for dessert. Overall an enjoyable beer and it was a good representation of a belgian dubbel and would buy it again."
"Ruddy red on the pour with a thick, creamy tan head that took a while to subside. Inviting, fruity aroma with suggestion of prunes perhaps? Left a fine lattice of lace down the side of the glass. Tilting the glass left a small wall of finely textured bubbles that slowly dissolved. Creamy in the mouth, not too sweet. I thought this was a fine beer and I would definitely buy it again."
"The beers as it sets in the glass a deep dark ruby color with the head lavish in size and the lace a luxurious sheet to conceal the glass, both are long lasting and a winsome light tan in color. Nose is sweet and fruity, chocolate cherries, with the grainy freshness of the malts. Start is sweet, the top is skinny, the finish is commonplace as far as carbonation, the hops are customary for the style, and the aftertaste is droughty, somewhat sour, a beer well worth the sample"
"After pouring this beer and seeing a golden brown beer with a light brown head was appealing. The aroma was of a caramel and spicey nature. The taste was very pleasant for this Belgium beer. Smooth with very little bitterness! Be careful when uncorking this beer!"
"Beautiful crystal clear deep ruby in hue, covered by a persistent, thick, light beige head that leaves loose lace.  A quick waft of solvent - like fusels in aroma is immediately ensued by bright, citrusy fruit w/ a hint of spruce.  The initial impression aromawise is that of Pine Sol, but as the beer breathes, hints of raisiny Special B and light chocolate malt provide contrast and depth.  Yeast derived contributions in aroma are virtually absent, w/ bubblegum present only at a trace.  In flavor, a snap of cider like tartness is perceived at first, then mellows into a somewhat understated combination of chocolate, dark, ripe fruity prune and vinous notes of fermented grapes w/ a pine undertone.  Yeast esters flavorwise are very mild, and mirror the light bubblegum in aroma.  Very dry, well attenuated and correspondingly light in body, w/ a spritzy mouthfeel from the high carbonation.  (The mouthfeel was downright seltzer like and prickly for the first few minutes) Finishes dry, clean and a touch bland w/ a hint of yeast must.  A bit of a dissappointment.  Affligem Dubbel lacked complexity overall and was too ""clean"" and neutral esterwise.  It was as if they fermented this brew with a neutral American ale yeast at a high temperature."
"Perfectly good in every way, i like the yeast strain these dudes use, quite gentle and soft and interesting, ver floral chocoltae nose, great presence of malt and even hops, nice spicy flavour, i like it a lot."
"This beer poured a reddish amber color with a bubbly white head that left some nice lace.  Had a decent amount of carbonation common to this style.  It had an aroma of malt and carmel.  The flavor was of malt and caramel.  Slighty tangy(maybe due to the carb) and caramel sweet finish.  A good dubble, not the best of the batch, but well worth trying."
"A dubbel to pair with a nice home cooked meal, it might not be a top notch dubbel it is enjoyable to say the least."
"I prefer Chimay and Orval compared to this"
