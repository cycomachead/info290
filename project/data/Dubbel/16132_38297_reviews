review_text
"Poured from a bottle into a schooner, the beer is a deep, dark, vibrant, ruby-brown coloring with a thin, low profile, off-white head. Aromas of sugary sweetness, roasted nut, tangy caramel, and some old world fruit sweetness. Very heavy and cloying sweetness. Flavors are very sweet forward, with a blast of date, fig, cherry, and berry notes that border on sugary/syrupy. Candi sugar in there, too, making this a real sweet tooth brew. Wow. The body is light, but a bit chewy from all the sweetness. The aftertaste is all the berry and cherry again, and that lingers through the slick, slightly oily finish. This one leans far too sweet and sugary for me, for the style."
"I Pop!ped the cap and began the pour which resulted in a LOT of rocky, light-tan head coming up as if I were pouring a bottle of pop! It fell as quickly as it rose, but it left a bunch of sticky lacing in its wake. Color was Very Dark Brown to Black/Opaque (SRM = > 34, "
"I picked this up for my wife who has a gluten allergy. Relative to other gluten free beers, this is not bad. Relative to everything else..."
"O: Not bad at all!  Rather surprised/delighted that alternatives exist for those that can't have gluten.  I wouldn't swap it for Chimay or Ommegang, but it'll do in a pinch."

"Aroma of sherry, wine, vegetal, dirt. Taste dry vinous, faint cherry coke, prunes. Not a Dubbel! Another undrinkable Gluten!"

"Pours a pretty dark brown with some ruby highlights, almost black with a good 3-finger thick foamy beige head that last a good while before settling down to a good 2-3mm head. LOTS of lacing is seen when sipped and sticks to the sides of the glass. The aroma is of yeast, rice, and sweet dark molasses. The label says:""Water, millet,buckwheat, rice, sorghum, hops and yeast'. Lots going on with the taste as you can taste the ingredients listed including the water. LOL! Goes down easy with a very slight dry bitter finish that doesn't last. Also a slight different aftertaste is noted. Not bad but different. Overall a different BUT decent brew."

"WONDERFUL gluten free ale but EXPENSIVE.  I cannot believe that anyone rated this gluten free delight poorly."

"Even though it wasn't easy to discern, the alcohol was spot-on and the somewhat creamy aspect of the mouthfeel led this to go down easy. Would gluten have added more body to this beer? Probably, but even with that, it would have still been light. I wouldn't trash this like others have on here but at the same time, this wasn't anything special. A good beer should enhance a meal and with the bread and seafood that I enjoyed, this paired just fine. worth a try once for anyone who wants a light Belgian-style beer with dinner without being overwhelmed."

"Poured from a 500ml bottle. Pours a dark chestnut brown colour. Very fruity nose with scents of pear/pear skin, port and dried plum. Flavours of cherry and cola on the palate, with a tart dry finish. Itâ€™s not as heavy as an Abbey ale, but has nice similarities flavour wise."
""
""
"Light bodied with a lot of carbonation. Just as nasty as the other two Green's beers I picked up. Thankfully I am done with these putrid beers now, and can get on to something better. I should have know better than to buy all 3 of these Green's beers without checking any ratings first."

"Overall - an ok beer for being gluten free."
""

"Oh my God. I bought this because I had a friend who had allergic issues. It taste like a dark Corona. It's barely drinkable, and franky, for the calories, I might just drain pour and open something decent to get this aweful taste out of my mouth. ICk."
"O: One of the better gluten-free offererings I've had. The flavors almost remind me of Lindeman's Faro at the beginning. While not strictly adhering to the flavors you would find in a traditional dubbel, it is still quite good for what it is."
""
"My wife who has been searching for a decent gluten free beer for a while says that this is her absolute favorite."
""
""
""
""
"O: As a dubbel it's really off the mark, as a Dubbel/Flanders Red hybrid, this is very good."
"Overall doesn't really taste like a dubbel but as a gluten free beer it's the best I've had and I've tried most of them."
"A beer brewed with Millet, Rice, Buckwheat and Sorghum. I would also like to add no redeeming value for a beer drinker."

" ~ If I had Siliac's Disease I would do my best to make this beer work. That being said, I do not, so I won't, and I recommend you do the same. To me this seems more like an alcoholic cola rather than a dubbel."
"It's like a sparkling red wine with some yeast thrown in. Not as good as Quest and not a great Dubbel but it has a huge disadvantage being gluten free. For some reason it reminds me of Christmas. I could drink this while decorating the Christmas tree."
"O-Not a great Dubbel when compared to barley based gluten beers. But, as a gluten free beer this is very good. Green's has produced the best bottled gluten free beers on the market. I wish more brewers would enter the game."
"O - a fine and distinct Belgian dubbel, little hampered by the gluten free goal. While this makes a fine sipper, it is exceptionally drinkable and can disappear quickly. Less than world class but not actually disappointing."
"Well, like many of the other gluten-free beers I've had, this just seems to be sorely missing the right grain backbone. Conversely, however, it does a decent job of providing some of the other flavour characteristics inherent in the proclaimed style, and hides its elevated alcohol well enough. Overall, though, one out of two and a half just doesn't cut it, I'm afraid. Drinkable, I suppose, but this is not the dubbel you're looking for."
"Ahhh...The Belgians..."
"Appearance is dark brown with a very tall light brown fluffy head not bad lace. Smell reminds me of rum and coke and dark fruits, with the sweetness of the coke and a light bite of rum in the aroma. It also Tastes a little like rum and coke with a bit earthiness put into it. Mouthfeel is light with good carbonation. I'd like to have seen my face in the mirror after having that 1st sip, interesting, different, not necessarily bad, but probably not again."
"However, I dig this concept, and there is definitely a skill level involved to the brewing. Consider for a second for either situation: a) you are allergic to nearly everything on Earth but would love to drink beer; or b) Your conscience (or boss) says to make a beer without malt, wheat, or anything not hypo-allergenic (yes, it is generously mentioned that there is no fish, eggs, celery, or mustard involved). Either way, you would have to be pleased with this offering. Especially if it were more dry."
"Final Notes: It's worth a shot if you just absolutely can't have real beer, that said, it's not as good as the real thing, but no gluten-free beer will ever be."
"D: Ultimately, the drying metallic tang from the brown rice renders this a one-off for me. I'm going to try others, since I do have Celliac friends, and I'd like to find something we can all enjoy together."
"this is my first foray into gluten free beers. not impressed. my scores actually might be too high."
"The only other gluten free beer I have tasted was an AB product and it wasn't bad; this was."
"Reviewed on: 01-21-2010 21:40:45"
" i would not recomend this as an alternative for those who can't enjoy regular beer types."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass. Color was a dark, slightly translucent beer, with a thick frothy head made up of large bubbles. Most of the head disappeared quickly leaving some bubbles clinging to the sides with a thin layer on top. Aroma was slightly alcoholy, with some bitterness, bananas, and also some burnt sugar sweetness contradicting the acidic bitter. Taste was bitter and astringent, with a very small amount of banana aftertaste. Felt watery in the mouth, along with extra amounts of carbonation. Not easy drinking , and the ABV definitely hit stronger than it should have."
"For gluten-free beers, this is probably the cream of the crop. Interesting, and somewhat enjoyable."
"Mouthfeel is poor and this is not drinkable."
"Overall: I'm sure if I had Celiac Disease, I'd be glad to be able to drink beer at all, so perhaps I shouldn't expect too much from the Endeavour Dubbel."
"It pours a mahogany brown with glistening ruby red highlights when held to the light. The head is about two fingers thick and quite puffy. The aroma is a powerful blast of darker malts and sorghum syrup. Medium mouthfeel. After the impressive first glance and whiff, the taste is a bit of a syrupy letdown with chocolate hops and wheat and the obvious stench of alcohol. It leaves a bit of an unpleasant aftertaste."
"Wanted to like this one but I can't. It's just not good at all."
"EDIT- Drain poured it."
"The taste is..umm...sweet to the max mixed in with a lime soda like tartness. Wow. So this is what gluten free does for a beer. Umm...no thanks. It's thin bodied with light carbonation and for me, is almost totally undrinkable. No way I'm going to finish the bottle."
"D - Not so much I'm afraid, will steer clear of this one."
"It has a strong malty and alcohol like aroma. It has a fruity liquor smell to it as well that is a little roasty. The head starts off even and beautiful but quickly becomes foam. There is a lot of crazy lace. It has a dark brown body with quite a bit of sediment and little bit of a reddish hue. It has sort of an odd sweet melon taste with strong alcohol tones. There is a mild metallic and roasty aftertaste there is not much for body."
"Just not something I'd ever want to drink. I think that folks with a gluten intolerance can do much better than this. Avoid it."
"It's hard to believe that gluten-free beer has to be this bad. I sure do feel for anyone who has to drink this stuff. Truthfully, if left no other choice, I'd do without. Bottom line: (less than) one and done for me."
"Pours brown-black with a fizzy, soda-like head that leaves a thin, patchy film. It smells of sulphur (molases, maybe), with a bit of raisins in the background. Taste is metallic, bitter, sour, and not...good. It goes through a phase where it almost has a fruity sweetness, then it descends into a medicinal esters finish that devolves into burnt metal finish. I'm not sure if you can burn metal, but I think this is what it would taste like. The mouthfeel is thin but ok on carbonation but I really can't focus on anything past the taste. Not drinkable, sorry. I admire their creation of a beer for the gluten-allergic and I admire their effort to do it in a Belgian style. I'm just glad I'm gluten-ok."
"Not a very drinkable brew. I will finish this bottle but will not seek it out again."
"D- Easy to drink due to the low alcohol, but not very exciting in flavor profile."
"Bottle: Poured a deep pitch-brown ale with a light foamy head with good retention and no lacing. Aroma of sweet malt with some distinguishable alcohol. Taste is also dominated by some overly sweet malt which are kind of gross with some hot alcohol ester. Light body with average carbonation. No subtlety or complexity and not something I am looking for ever drinking again."
"Is it better than your other gluten free options? Probably. Is it better to the tune of probably 3-4x the cost of your other options? I don't think so. Give it a shot if you're missing belgians but their blonde tripel is better."
"Man, am I glad I'm not forced to drink gluten free beers all the time. This just doesn't do it for me. It's not terrible, but it doesn't exactly meet the usual Belgian dubbel ale standards. Average drinkability here because, in my opinion, I've had worse. But I wouldn't recommend this to anyone except those of you who are seeking something totally different that what you're used to. This beer will satisfy that craving, if nothing else."
"taste is very sour and tart, sour grape, fruits and berries, some cocoa, licorice, malt, slightly bitter."
"For any of my celiac brethren out there, at least the looks is appealing. Forms a large thicket of light tan head that dwindles at a decently quick pace. Body is ruddy with deep amber highlights, lacing is apparent although not evenly strung. Aroma is very vinous in nature and label says this one is good until 05/05/09 that's awesome I know it's 7% but that doesn't scream that the beer should last. Smells deep like a red wine mild peppery feel with grape peels after being aged on barrels, spicy Belgian yeast strain touch of raisin and apple tartness as well. Flavor is strikingly vinous in nature, grape seeds red wine dry finish with yeast cake dough flavors. A decent amount of acidity can be noted here as well, I'm not getting much hop flavor. Definitely a hybrid Belgian styled dubbel I admire the creativity and I will confess this is not bad at all. Definitely drinkable I will have to compare it to the Red Bridge brew tomorrow, the last gluten free beer I had was utter shit. Yep that brew was the Passover honey beer from Ramapoo Valley. You would have thought they could have pulled of some wine like flavors in their version of a gluten free beer, but sadly that wasn't the case. Mouthfeel does sit a bit heavy some shades of cloying sweetness and acidic dryness with grape tartness and yeast cake powder notes. I will definitely pass this one on to Celiac patient's, as a nurse I run into this disease pretty frequently this brew will have to get my approval as reccomendations for alternative brews that these poor folks can go for."
"Gigantic brown head towered over the brew even after I tried to pour it carefully. Settled down to a chunky head that laced my glass intermittently. The color is a deep brown like the bottle. Aromas are strange, candy sugar and packing plastic. Flavors are equally unpleasant. For an all natural beer it tastes awfully unnatural and astringent, plastic again, alcohol, vinegar. The mouthfeel is also off, thin for a Dubbel. The color I really the only thing right about this beer, I expected much, much more from a Belgian."
"While I liked this beer, I must issue a warning. It is not like any Dubbel I've ever had before, and I doubt it really fits under that style. What it really is, and not a bad one, is a decent cross between a Flanders Red, and an unblended lambic. If you like naturally fermented beers, with a strong wine-like quality, give it a try. I don't know what the brewers intended with this beer, but that's what they achieved. If you're not fond of those styles, avoid it."
"Poured into a chalice with an aggressive pour, got a one finger thick ,tan head that was very fluffy but it quickly thinned out and with little lacing. This is a dark brown beer with hints of red hues and some very active carbonation. It has a sweet fruity aroma to it, some cranberries and lemon zest... soy sauce? Too...Just a weird, sour and complex aroma. It has a medium body leaning on the light, mildly sweet and dry throughout, it tastes very much like Green's Discovery... not really a Dubbel taste at all, it is semi-smooth and fairly easy to drink and leaves a slightly Smokey aftertaste in your mouth. This is not a bad beer but I will not be buying it again..."
"I have 2 more Green's beers in the fridge. I hope they're not this bad."
"Aroma is fruity and more like a brandy than a beer. Pours a nice dark translucent brown with a beige head that is thick but does not stick around for long. Flavor is rather like brandy or cider, very apply, not like a beer at all but still tasty. Texture is exceptionally smooth. This hardly seems like a beer at all, but that is not necessarily a bad thing!"
"A clear miss if trying to imitate a Belgian Dubbel. Unless your allergic to the real stuff, I'd avoid this."
"Flavour is also radically different. No raisin or plum notes, no candi sugar, nothing to make this taste like a real Belgian dubbel. Its not ""bad;"" it has a unique, cereal-like flavour that I find pleasant. But its just not a dubble...flavour is wrong, scent is wrong, too much carbonation. I'd have it again, but...not if I want a dubble."
"Taste - Very medicinal/alcoholic. Vinegar, green apple and unripe berries. Very thin, dry and astringent with a harsh sour/boozy finish. Not a beer I'd recommend to anyone."
"D - Ughghgh. Unless you are gluten intolerant, I do not recommend trying this beer."
"D - This is my first gluten free beer, and I am quite impressed. I came into it expecting something pretty bad, based on reviews of other GF beers, but I was pleasantly surprised. If you can get past the somewhat unfortunate body, the flavor is a good imitation of a barley based dubbel, and the smell is so good that it gives no clues that the beer is GF. The best compliment I have for this is that I had no problem drinking the whole bottle and I even enjoyed it!"
"Overall impression: Interesting - definitely different than other gluten free beers I've tried. Not the best, but its nice to see some variety."
"Pours a three finger rocky light tan head that goes slowly to a thin layer leaving a little lace. Light carbonation and medium bodied. Opaque black color. Nose is very slight spice. Flavor is sweet and sour orange and dark chocolate. Very smooth but something is missing here - hops?? More like a fruit drink. $5.95 for a 500ml bottle from Colonial Spirits, Acton, MA."
"Drinkability- I wouldn't sample this beer again. as far as GF beers go, I would probably steer clear of it. While I really enjoy all Belgian styles, I felt that this beer missed the mark."
"This one was the biggest hope of the bunch. A Merchant Du Vin rep told me that it was the best of the three, and that it relied heavily on caramelized sugar for its dubbel character. The color was encouraging, and the aroma was not unlike some standard dubbles with the fruity estery yeasty sweet nose, but then --- CRASH! --- it all went to hell in my mouth. Too much thin phenolic sweetness, the sugar was almost all that revealed itself aside from lightning flashes of fruit and malt flavor that appeared and disappeared so fast that my repeated sips to catch this elusive flavor only amplified my disillusionment. Imagine that, the only somewhat satisfying gluten-free beer most people tell me they like is made by A-B. What an ironic fate. 5.99 per half-liter bottle of this stuff - are you kidding me? It's time for those with gluten intolerances that love beer to quit waiting for the market to find a solution, and start brewing up their salvation at home."
"A new brew-line offered to Central Kentucky BA's who prefer gluten-free beers. In fact, this beer fares much better than any other gluten-free beers that I have tried thus far. Starts wit a stable Dubbel look -- Solidly brown with some mohogany, purple colors mixed in, a loosely knit, typical Belgian head and retention, and highly carbonated. Scents deliver a heavy plumb, grape, apple estery quality, along with a sugar / syrup sweetness, and a lot of ferment-type spices. The tastes also deliver heavy, candied fruits found in the aromas. Pile on a deep booze-like flavor, and the brew takes on serious port wine-like flavors, mixed with Mr. Pibb soft drink. Quite nice and flavorful, but lacks depth and complexity. However, as with most gluten-free beers, the body suffers. The beer has a light airiness, that leaves the beer void of texture and depth, yet with a whisp of pepperiness. Finishes with a cola-like flavor"
"In the glass, this 'All Natural Dubbel Dark Beer' looked like a champ. A rich-looking, cloudy brown, it produced an off-white head of foam that lasted until the last drop, leaving plenty of lacing to coat the inside of my Tripel Karmeliet glass. Unfortunately, those are the last good things I can say about Green's Endeavor. The smell is reminiscent of Asian grass jelly drinks. As far as smells go, this one isn't particularly foul. In fact it is reasonably pleasant, but it is quite off-putting when the drinker knows that it is supposed to be a Belgian dubbel. The taste and mouthfeel are both mediocre at best, watery and tasting like an unsweetened herbal soda more than a beer. The aftertaste is fleeting, but what there is of it is unpleasantly medicinal. The abv is listed at 7%, and I'll give them credit for hiding it well, but that's just lipstick on a pig. And at $6 for a 500 ml bottle, I will not be getting a second one, nor will I accept a freebie. Okay, maybe there is one more good thing I can say about this beer: according to the label, it does NOT contain crustaceans, celery, or sesame seeds. That's a good thing, right?"
