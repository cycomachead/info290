"Chocolate brown appearance with a creamy head. Aroma is a little soapy at first, then settles down into a modest sour coffee. Alcohol heats the tongue right away - a little too much. Dark chocolate and fermented cherries on the finish."

"Poured from a bomber.  Head was almost non existent.  Lacked carbonation.  Not very good"

"Review based on the BJCP2008 guidelines (style 18B). Bottle 33 cl - Batch 20:05 K27B14. AROMA: sweet caramel base aroma with alcohol spicy notes. APPEARANCE: dark amber color and a bit hazy. average and moussy tanned head with average retention. TASTE: sweet and caramely flavour profile. some spicy notes. medium-low bitterness that lingers into a medium-dry finish. PALATE: medium body with medium-high carbonation. OVERALL: an average trapist dubbel that would benefit from more malt complexity."

"O –A pretty mild Dubbel which is not too pronounced in its flavours this beer is still very drinkable but does loose some marks for the Band-Aid pinch in the back."

"Great stuff from La Trappe, a very sweet beer that was balanced out with some good spice & touches of malts which prevented the beer from seeming sickeningly sweet. A very good offering and one I'd pick up again."

"05/01/14 On tap. Really nice and toasty flavor, nothing sweet on the caramelized side, just a solid, well balanced brew. Leave all expectations behind & try this. If nothing else you'll have a true point of reference as to what is good & bad. If you find fault, be prepared to defend your opinion, if you like it...well..just enjoy it like I did."

"750 ml bottle. Pours dark amber with tall, long-lasting, foamy off-white head and nice lacing. Aroma is of bready malt, caramel, ripe cherries, apples and yeast. Body is full, creamy and spicy. Spicy yeast, caramel malt, bread crust, plums, raisins, brown sugar fill the mouth. Finish is long, spicy, semi-sweet. Extremely, delicious brew."

"330ml bottle. La Trappe Chalice glass. Dark brown color, cloudy appearance. Light beige foam & creamy crown shows fairly good retention. Dark fruit, slight phenolic, sweet & caramel malt, spiced aromas & lemon hints. Gentle tart & fruity flavors at first followed by toasted maltiness & chocolate hues. Medium body. Moderate carbonation. Oily texture. Spicy & peppery palate. Tartiness is enhaced by carbonation but, finally, toasted malts overwhelm it. Very low hoppiness. Kind alcohol heat & sweet fruits into the finish. Delicious, complex, well balanced & nice spot of the Style."

"O: Rich malt and wood, excellent balance. Strong choice for a medium-bodied brown dubbel."
""
"Dubbel pours a dark brown color, with a large fluffy lacing tan head. There is a nice deep oakey and earthy, and almost wine like aroma that is warm. The taste is dark and deep, with strong fruity ester flavors, good solid malt base. A little flat feel, but full flavors. Overall a rich and enjoyable dubbel."

"Poured into a tulip glass from a 25 oz corked bottle (first plastic cork i've seen with beer). Nice frothy head developed which was tan in color and lasted a short time, very bubbly. Appearance was a cloudy, honey/amber color close to brown. Aroma had hints of caramel, spice and some floral notes. Taste had a strong caramel / toffee note with hints of malt and spice. Mouthfeel was creamy with a sweet caramel aftertaste."

"O: A different dubbel, less bitter than Westmalle Dubbel and other dubbels, but still a great beer. La Trappe dubbel is different from its sisters because it not resembles to wine like other which makes that dubbel quite unique. To me La Trappe Dubbel is another must have beer."
""
""
""
"Overall: this excellent Dubbel lives up to its reputation. Great balance and complexity Alcohol is partially hidden but with light warming. Exceptionally enjoyable flavor and aroma."

"Great beer."

"750 ml bottle into chalice, 07/10 printed on the cork. Pours very hazy and cloudy dark ruby red color with a nice 1-2 finger dense and fluffy cream colored head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Spotty foamy lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big raisin, pear, apple, caramel, brown sugar, light banana, pepper, floral, clove, brown bread, candi sugar, and earthy yeast spiciness. Fantastic aromas with great complexity and balance of fruity/spicy esters with malt sweetness. Taste of raisin, apple, pear, caramel, brown sugar, pepper, clove, light banana, floral, herbal, brown bread, candi sugar, and earthy yeast spiciness. Lingering notes of light fruits, caramel, brown sugar, light banana, pepper, clove, brown bread, floral, herbal, and earthy yeast spiciness on the finish for a bit. Damn nice balance and complexity of fruity/spicy ester with malt sweetness; with great robustness and zero cloying sweetness present after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a smooth, fairly slick, and lightly prickly mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with hardly any warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a highly excellent Dubbel! Great balance and complexity of malt and fruity/spicy esters; and very smooth and crisp to sip on. A highly enjoyable offering."

"O: I've had this beer lots of times. But it's just the second dubbel I've had. The other one was Maredsous 8 and that one was pretty neat as well. I really like trappist beers and this one is a good start into this kind of beer."
""
"Overall, this is very decent stuff. I tend to be quite a fan of dubbels in any case, but I'm happy to say that the La Trappe's Dubbel is the best of their standard range I've yet had (with the Quad to come). Nice stuff."
""
""
""
""
"Certainly a nice beer, a straightforward Dubbel. It is nicely drinkable and offers a pretty nice interpretation of this malty Belgian style. It doesn't have many noticeable flaws, but I didn't find much terribly exciting either, just a really well-constructed malty and dry ale that has nice balance. There are Trappist beers that are a lot more interesting, but this is quality beer."

"330ml bottle, poured into Leffe chalice. Amber to auburn colour, pale for a Dubbel, one finger ginger tanned head, lots of lacing, opaque. Aroma was dark chocolate, cranberry and molasses. Tasted dark chocolate, cranberry, malt and molasses. Slightly boozy and fairly complex. Body was on the thick side, decent carbonation, smooth. Reminded me of a German Doppelbock, decent cold weather beer, quite enjoyable."

"O - A very good example of the style. Dominated by malt and yeast-produced fruitiness. Hops bitterness and alcohol help keep it from becoming too cloyingly sweet."
""
""
""
""
"O- This paired well with some beef buorguignon. A good example of the style."
""
""
""

""

"This beer pours a ruby red with a touch of brown and a thin tan head and lace. The aroma is of cherries, dark chocolate, a hint of brandy and some yeasty hay. The flavor is complex leading off with mildly sour cherries followed by dark choclolate, and wood notes with just a hint of smoke. It's mouthfeel is medium and smooth. Koningshoeven La Trappe Dubbel (Koningshoeven/Dominus) is an excellent brew, well balanced, drinkable, and what the style should be. Highly recommended!"

"O: The alcohol is very well hidden in this beer but it is still easy to drink - this is a very enjoyable sipping beer."

"O- just cant get past the tangy, dark fruity flavor i'm getting. it's not a bad brew, and i'm really looking forward to trying others, especially the tripel, but it's not striking out as a 'classic' to me."
""

""

"Brown with a good amount of ruby colouring coming through, just over one finger of tan head, great retention and plenty of lace. Smell is yeaty with a bit of spice in the mix as well, clove being the most noteable, dark fruits, alcohol and touches of brown sugar. Taste has lots of dark fruits, raisins and plum, lots of fruity esters, clove throughout, spices and possibly corriander every so often, a little alcohol heat in the finish. Light carbonation, creamy and medium bodied, light feel at points though. A solid dubbel but by no means is this a world beater, just a quality beer that I would welcome again anytime."
""
"O:"
""
"I've had the quad and the tripel before this dubbel. The quad is world class, the tripel is not very good, and this dubbel is every bit as good as the quad. This is one of the best beers I've had. It's easy to drink, I wish I had more than just one."
""
"Overall: very drinkable but bland for the style. A little disappointed in this one."

"O: Fantastic. Really well rounded, perfectly balanced, and expertly crafted. It's rare to taste something so good."
"Almost great but lack of some crisp however it’s leverage by nicely balance aroma and flavor also attractive appearance showcase. Yes, worthy."
"Dark amber colour with a two finger brown head, with great retention.Aroma of fruits, banana, citrus. Taste is bitter at first, like a bitter chocolate, at the end bitter-sweet.A bit of caramel there. Thick in body and average carbonation. Overall a really great beer!"
""
""
""
"In short: a decent Dubbel with strong apple-banana aroma rather than more common plum&raisin like. (330 ml, BB 11-2013, into tulip.)"
""
""
""
""
""
"a good dubbel, but not la trappe's best brew. pours a mahogany/cherrywood color into a goblet with a smallish white foamy head. smells like dried cherries, plums, and belgian yeast. flavor is not as sweet as the nose, not at all. in fact its malty without really being sweet to any degree. nice balance too. mouthfeel is medium bodied with effervescent carbonation and a warming finish. Overall a good beer, and very drinkable at 7% abv, but its quality and excitement lag well behind the la trappe quad"
""
"Notes: Maybe the fruity and soft sour touch shines more than what is typically expected of a Trappist Dubbel but this is a pretty pleasing and quality brew within this bracket. Given the rest of the selection in most common spots in Spain, it is rather nice to have this one waiting on the shelve. Not so sure I would reach out for it again in the States but a good one to have around and share."
""
"O- I say ""God bless the Trappist Monks"" ( and, no doubt he does). There are better out there, but this one is good, indeed. Well worth the visit."

"Overall a good dubbel, but nothing outstanding for me. I dug the carbonation level."
"a solid dubbel, but a bit cloyingly sweet. better widely available options."
"O: A solid, easy to drink beer. Definitely worth a try."
"O - I love Trappist ales. Good dubbel"
"A very interesting brew - definitely different from other dubbels I've had and contains a different yeasty taste from other Trappist ales. However, it is quite reminiscent to Rochefort 6, if that gives me any idea what it tastes like - spicy, malty, slightly boozy, yet not too thick or sweet in character. Definitely recommended!"
"O: A Dubbel is always a Dubbel; nice - especially if brewed by Trappist-monks."
"M:nice mouthfeel not to difficult to drink starting mild with some sweetness changing slowly to some medium bitterness."
"D- drinks as good as other monkly dubbels although flavor is lacking just a bit for me, even after a couple years, as trappist brews generally break the 4.5 mark in my book. this one is welcome in my chalice any time."
"O: Good beer."
"M - Medium carbonation with a medium body"
"Conclusion: this is an outstanding Dubbel, and one that I consider a benchmark for the style. Tasty and complex. Certainly worth your money and time."
"Murky brown with a small to near non-existent tan, airy froth which surrounds a swirly sea of small aimless bubbles. Vinous aroma up front with a little yeast, dry grain and plums at the end. More grape and grain to the tongue with taffy and plum finishing it off. Noticeably airy but still satisfying and perfectly balanced. Consummately refined and more straight forward than bold. If they served this at communion instead of grape juice I still might be going to church."
"Medium mouthfeel that is very drinkable. Solid offering."
"This Dubbel pours out as a earthy brown color with a cream colored head. The head lasts for a little while. The smell is of dark fruits, earth and yeast. The taste follows up with the same qualities as the smell. The mouthfeel is smooth and silky, not much carbonation but had a good medium body to it. Overall I'm not a huge fan of Dubbels but this one worth trying."
"Overall - A very nice Belgian dark high-alcohol beer for people who like that taste"
"O/D - Not a bad Dubbel. Not too full of those yeasty notes, most likely because it's filtered. A nice drink in a small alley with people passing. Tasty and worth a try."
"Overall a great representation of the style. One of the best dubbels out there."
"From the corked big bottle marked 10:15-K11010. Sampled on April 12, 2011. A dynamic looking ruby red when held to the light and do hold it to the light because out of the light it looks a bit brown with a fluffy, tan head. Aromas of yeast, smoky malts, and dark fruits like plum. The body settles comfortably on the tongue while the head delicately tickles the lips. The flavors abound with moderate malts with a hoppy, alcohol bite at the end. Interesting and engaging."
"Burns a tad too much, but otherwise great balance between complexity and drinkability - what makes this style great."
"O- Overall a very nice Dubbel and would try again."
"Very drinkable brew, good carbonation and freshness. I would buy this definitely again."
"D: Very sweet, milkshake-sweet, but nice all the same. It disappeared before I realised it."
"Overall, what we liked best about this beer was the inviting aroma and the complexity to the taste. From the first whiff of the beer you are drawn in, and want to sip it right away. Once you finally do you are met with a straightforward dubbel, with some inherent complexities through the finish of the taste. What was most surprising about this drink was how quenching and cooling it was to sip. The drinker is left refreshed and wanting more."
"D: very drinkable, the Dr. Pepper flavor takes a little getting used to, but once I adjusted to the maltfest. A good malty (malty, malty) beer, I feel like I just drank a vitamin shake."
"Overall a very solid dubbel and one that is probably just a little better on tap."
"D - not much drinkable since the perfume and oil taste, but I can bet other bottles or tap beer will be lot more better"
"D: The added sweetness, increased sweetness and the taste of redcurrant berries made this beer something distinct as opposed to a lesser version of the Quadrupel. Very refreshing and bit of a summer beer even if it is a serious beer altogether."
"Poured from 750ml bottle into chalice glass. Golden orange colour with a foamy white head. Malty aroma with notes of spices, fruits and alcohol. The flavour is malts, spices, alcohol and some fruitiness with a bitter finish. Medium-bodied and smooth mouthfeel. Pretty decent dubbel but not the best."
"A medium to full bodied beer with a drier finish. Good for Christmas"
"Drinkability was low as this beer was just too sweet for me."
"O: I like the fruity and chocolaty flavors. However, a bit too sweet to be very drinkable (see Westmalle) and not complex enough to make for a good Strong Dark (see Maudite, Chimay Blue)."
"The warming feel from the alcohol and spectrum of flavors hurt drinkability a bit, but overall a pleasant brew."
"D - A little one dimensional likme other La Trappe beers."
"Very nice - worth a try."
"A really solid dubbel, but for the price there are better to be had (Achel Bruin is far better)."
"This is just lacking all respects."
"The bottle is similar to the tripel label and not like what the picture shows here. It also states 7.0 ABV not 6.5. But, let's not get wrapped up in petty details. It pours a wonderful deep amber brown color with approx 1 inch of head and some mild lacing. Smell is wonderful, the banana bread laced with rum jumps out of my chalice and punches me lightly.Taste is sweet, fruity, bready, some cherry and banana taste, and the alcohol is somewhat present. Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied. Almost like eating a banana nut bran muffin laced with rum. Drinkability is fine; I will hunt these down again. Cheers."
"Drinkability: Its a very easy drinking beer. Good, but not the most complex or interesting."
"D: It's a fine beer, good but not great. I would drink it but wouldn't seek it out."
"I'm not really into Dubbels, but this one rather satisfied me. It has that typical La trappe sweet dark malty caramel toffee taste I like. You can find it in the quadrupel (oak aged) as well. But you have to like it... Went down really well, fresh and warmed up, would drink this again for sure!"
"Had this on tap at Smokeless Joe's in Toronto in branded glassware. Pours a mahogany brown with a finger or two of off-white head. Nice lacing in the glass. Smells of strong brown sugar and candied cherries. I cannot overstate how sugary this smelled. Flavour is incredibly sweet. My friend wasn't a huge fan of the style so I basically had 2 glasses of this in a row. I enjoyeded it, but prefer a bit less of the sweetness."
"Overall: Not the best Dubbel I've had by a long shot. I would buy it again if it were at a discount price, but I'd buy some nice cheese to go with it of course."
"jd"
"D= Great dubbel. I don't find myself diggin dubbels as much as I like this one. Really a winner."
"D- A very nice Dubbel, and not overwhelmingly sweet. I found it had a very good balance to it. Very drinkable at a medium to slow pace. Has a warming effect on the stomach which gets a bit coarse if you drink it to fast. A good example of the style, but it really didn't excite me much. Would drink it again though."
"Overall impression: classic dubbel but not overly exciting. watered down and lacking appropriate carbonation."
"It's a very nice Belgian. Smooth and good flavor. The flavor seems to drop off, leaving very little aftertaste. There is a syrup-like coating felt after drinking."
"Definitely one of my favourite belgian."
"Poured into a Koningshoeven Chalice a ruby black with a one finger white head. No lacing and little retention. The scent is strong of carmeled raisins and grapefruit. The taste is a malt bomb, with more raisin flavors and a little hop bite at the end. The mouthfeel give a little bit of dryness."
"Overall this beer is a succes, will definately buy again."
"Notes: Think I might like this better than the Quad and am going to lay some down for aging. Don't usually like Dubbels, but this doesn't strike me as a great example of a Dubbel which in this case results in a higher rating."
"Poured a dark brown with one-finger tan head that leaves lace down glass on top of a yeasty, orangeish smell with citric hop notes along with some sugary sweet malt and there are offshoots of sour and tropical fruit like grape, pear and apple. A little less sweet than I like but good carbonation leads to a crisp, light-to-medium body that's smooth with citric and grapefruit fruit flavors along with a little bit of sour and tropical splash. Balances with bready, caramel malts plus hints of cocoa and roasted along with mild ABV so the beer is both fruit and sweet flavored and it all has chance to shine. As I sip there is a lil bit more of sticky syrupy sweetness in the malts and a touch more dryness in the finish."
"I have to preface this with the fact that I don't particularly like Belgian style beers...but I like this one. No head at all on draft. Great amber color. Not much aroma..but real great taste. What aroma there is, is sweet and spicey. Taste is great....not too sweet. Perfect. I will seel this one out again for sure. The monks know what they are doing."
" D- This is a great balanced and complex malt forward beer that has everything in balance. There are some oxidative notes that get in the way a bit but still this very drinkable."
"Poured an 11.2 ounce bottle into a Chimay chalice. Great reddish brown color. Nice head but it disappears within a few seconds. Lacing is nonexistent. This is my least favorite of the Trappist Ales. Good but not great. Plenty of sweetness and caramel."
"The dubbel style is not among my favorites when it comes to Belgian ales, but this beer is the exception to the general rule. Maybe it's the cola and ice tea that balances the sweetness so well, but whatever... this is just a very fine beer."
"Pours a strong tea colored brown with a quickly dissipating head. Smells malty, spicy, and it has a little undercurrent of alcohol. Initial taste is of, I guess I would call it fruit. Not the dark prune/raisin of a porter, but what I can only describe as a lighter fruit. I can't think of a fruit that would describe this, but I'll simply call it 'light finish fruit'. Aftertaste is a very solid burned sugar/caramel flavor. Taste and beer lingers for a short bit, though not so long as to detract from the experience."
"M & D - Nice fluffy feel and great drinkability with the relative lower ABV."
"Body is surprisingly light for the flavours, the carbonation is unsuitably high."
"After Chimay red this is probably my favourite double. Actually a type of beer I haven't been overly fond of in the past but with this and the Chimay I'm starting to love this style."
"Slightly soured cherry taste. Less sweet on the tongue. Rich sugary body. Good carbonation. Too sweet for my tastes, but one can tell it is well made."
"Complex fruity esters are felt on the nose, this course provides a mish-mash of different flavors of fruit where there cue mostly red and black fruits. The palate is quite heady, with a body busy in toasted malt that is quickly boosted by a good spicy bitterness in the finish. The body is initially soft, almost like water, but it becomes more complex very quickly. Very similar to the St. Bernardus Prior but perhaps more focused on the malty-fruity red fruit typically on the exotic fruits of his cousin beer."
"Notes: ABV = 7.0%. Best before 10/2011. A nice Dubbel that is very well balanced. A bit more on the vinous side of dark fruit flavors and has a bit more of a mineral than I expected. Overall a solid enjoyable beer that I would happily drink again."
"This is a damn good example of a Dubbel. It could have used a bit more carb but it did not damage the overall beer. Thumbs up on this one."
"D- Its a fine easy drinking dubbel, i just feel the whole beer is subdued from the aesthetics to the flavour/aroma experience. Certainly smooth drinking with a nice flavour profile if you look hard enough for it, but thats the problem."
"It had a deep amber color with a decent head. The smell was sweet and fruity. The taste was sweetness and finished with a bitterness. It has a medium body that went down easy with no real hint of alcohol. Enjoyable brew to finish the day with."
"Drinkability: Very high alcohol content means this is never going to be drink to enjoy for a whole evening. Probably would go best with a meal, taken slowly and savoured. Creates a pleasant warming sensation in the stomach."
"Bottle poured into a large snifter. Purplish brown, fizzy with a slight tan head. Smells like purple candy or artificial grape flavoring along with cherries and other dark fruits. Taste is a milder version of the smell with a strong initial burst of the grape that mellows out quickly. Fairly watered down, the alcohol is hidden well. Decent drinkability, but not that exciting."
"D; Very easy to drink, but I would probably sip one of these in a sitting given the sweetness."
"I'll enjoy this beer while I drink it but I'm not sure I'll get it again."
"Drinkability : a good beer in the style Dubbel."
"FN- If it weren't for the wet dog smell id have rated higher. I dont know if its from the aging, but this beer is just flat out a work of art."
"Bottle. Dark pour with thin white head. Very winey grape aromas, dry, fruity and sweet. Taste is quite fruity, lots of plums and grapes, some alcohol. Smooth mouthfeel with a decent alcohol presence. A very interesting dubbel, which is not my favourite style."
"D-- Nice and easy to drink. ABV is noticeable but it is mostly once it opens up. Still easy to drink and enjoy. Nice appearance, nose, and taste. A drinkable beer that can be done any time of the year."
"D: For me it's a sipper, but a darn good one. Take your time and enjoy."
"D - Good rich beer that was easy to drink and very satisfying. Wouldn't have a session on it but will definately drink again"
"Drank this one in a hotel in the south of Holland on tap. It was served in the original La Trappe chalice. It's a beer as can be expected from one of the abbey brewers. Delicious double with a very nice dark colour and a nice head in the glass. The alcohol is hardly noticable, but with 6,5 % that's to be expected. This one can be bought in Holland in every liquorstore."
"D - Very good dubbel overall and very pleasant to drink."
"Overall this didn't blow me away but it did serve as a good representation of the style, even if it was a bit on the bitter side. Worth a shot."
"Mouthfeel is thin and very bubbly. I could make a night of this beer, but probably would choose something over this."
"O: Not as good as the Trippel (in my opinion) but would do it again."
"D - Like a fine wine, La Trappe Dubbel is well worth savouring. A great find on tap - certainly one I'll go for again. Great stuff."
"The beer is very smooth. It's great if you want a couple more, and want to try a medium complex and very well balanced beer."
"D: This was my last attempt. In the future I will focus on their quad and the Isidor (if they keep producing it)."
"I usually will not comment on how other members rate their beers (because everyone is entitled to their own opinions), but, with that said, how can some rate this a C, or even worse, a C-? I understand there are better dubbels out there, but come on now, seriously? I wish some would just give this beer a little bit of the respect that it deserves. Damaging ratings ought to be withheld for garden-variety American-style lagers. ~"
"While a very nice beer, there are plenty of better ones that are pretty easy to get."
"Drinkability: The alcohol hotness harms the drinkability. The residual sweetness (most likely needed to help counter balance the hotness) ends up being a bit cloying. Its true to style and interesting, but has some (aforementioned) flaws."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a strong biting carbonation."
"Corked and cages 750mL bottle. Clear deep brown with a bit of a reddish hue. A generous cap of dark beige foam fell quickly to a thin ring and left a few islands of bubbles floating on top of the beer. Malty aroma, bready, toffee, light dried fruit character, slight alcohol, but fairly mild overall. Bitterness was higher than I was expecting, but still on the low side. Malt sweetness and toffee up front, followed by fruit, cherry, plums, sugar. Light alcohol in the finish. Carbonation was higher than average, which gave it a lighter texture. Slight warmth. Pretty tasty overall."
"Overall, this beer is drinkable enough but it lacks overall depth and interest to make this a beer to come back to more than once."
"A nice dubbel, light with a good Belgian fruity, phenolic sweetness. This beer pours a dark mahogany, translucent without the murkiness I was expecting. The head dissipates quickly but sprouted nicely and left a bit of lacing and, at least, a fair ring around the outside of my goblet. The aroma has a strong phenolic band-aid note, although it's not unpleasant. There are also strong Belgian stone fruit flavors, a touch of earth and a splash of rum. It's a fruity, sweet beer, like a quad without depth and punch. Again, that sounds critical and that's not entirely meant. I don't always want to drink big heavy quads, but I still prefer them in terms of ratings. While it's more drinkable than a quad, it still tends to make my mouth turn when I take a large sip. If nothing else, Koningshoeven deserves an award for packing this much flavor in a 6.5% abv beer. It might not be the most complex Belgian flavor, but it's a big, assertive sweetness."
"Drinkability: Like I said, probably my favorite dubbel, a sipper and great for dessert."
"Cloudy, muddy amber body. Caramel and sweet, dark fruit on the nose. Caramel, chocolate, spice, earth and that classic yeastiness on the palate. Medium body. A good dubbel from the only Trappist Abbey outside of Belgium. I enjoy this beer, but compared to some of its Trappist counterparts, this beer is unremarkable. Perhaps that comparison is unfair, but when the phrase ""Authentic Trappist Product"" is on the bottle, the bar is set pretty high."
"I was lucky enough to have ths on tap at Novare Res; it was poured into my Uprising chalice. Te beer is a great color--dark red, like a glass of port. It lost some appearance point because of the disappointing head. There were some bubbles atop my glass when it was poured, but by the time the glass was brought to me, it had largely disappeared (not even a skim was left), and I was sitting at the bar! The aroma is rich and sweet, with some caramel and a little bit of alcohol. You can pick up some alcohol in the taste as well, along with sweet grapes. There is a lingering feeling of sourness. It has a light mouthfeel but much more carbonation than I expected. The amount of carbonation and fruit flavors remind me of a grape ginger ale; I'm not sure if that is a good or bad thing. Overall, it's a decent beer although there are both Trappist and non-Trappist dubbels I enjoy more."
"Drinkability: Paired well with the 1920 silent film ""The Parson's Widow"" directed by Carl Th. Dreyer. Still though, it's not exactly the best Belgian Dubbel on the block, as it's beaten out just barely, at least for me, by both the Rochefort 6 and Chimay Red."
"Overall - Reviewed from notes (April 2009) at Monk's Cafe. Bottle K09E7 08:54. A nicely done Belgian Dubbel, but could use a bit more in the nose and flavor departments. The head was also a bit modest, but retained nicely. Overall, a good beer; I have had better and worse."
"The La Trappe offerings seem to get treated as the black sheep of the Trappist world but its a little unfair, this dubbel is good sample of the style and worthy of anyones consideration."
"ADDENDUM: After the yeast is swirled in... Nose becomes noticeably creamier, and the head gets a quick revitalization. Taste becomes a little more raisiny and the finish gains a touch of added tartness."
"OVERALL: A decent brew, but the taste was just a little too sweet to make it a real winner. As such, this one didn't drink away all that easily. One I'd have again, but I wouldn't go out of my way. There'll probably be something better at the bar I'll enjoy more."
"D- A nice, sweet treat. The alcohol may be low, but the sweetness makes this a bit of a sipper. A very clean and enjoyable dubbel."
"A very tasty dubbel."
"I highly recommend this beer, especially to people looking to get into Trappist ales...or to have around as a beer for those guests you have over who can be impressed by more artisan beers and just need someone to show them the way."
"Thick creamy head, doesn't last very long. Very dark body, hard to see through --> dark red/brown not a strong scent. Light fresh taste, light bodied. No aftertaste ""wet", smooth, fruity taste, but not the strong flavor typical of trappist brews. ""Taste the silence"" -- very appropriate motto."
"3 D: with its flavour failing the promise of the aroma, this is a rather thin-bodied dubbel showing a very modest profile indeed. Strange quality by the standard of a Trappist ale..."
"Unfortunately, I find La Trappe the least impressive of the Trappist beers. Perhaps, unsurprisingly they are also the most commercialised and it's not even clear how involved the monks really are with the brewing anymore - I believe Bavaria do most of the work these days. I think this shows in the beers which don't really live up to the standards set by the other Trappist breweries."
"Somewhat later I had it in its bottled form, and still enjoyed it, but without the same feeling of rapture. I guess it was just one of those magical moments. Scores adjusted down slightly."
"NOTE: ABV is 7% according to the bottle."
"Pours a clear mahogany with a tall brown head with decent retention. Smell is surprisingly faint for its style, but still good: dark fruits like cherries and plums, other assorted sweet malts. Taste is spot on the money: molassesey malts with complex fruitiness, burnt sugar, cloves and spices; hops are very restrained. Medium body is finely made; very drinkable and delicious. Highly recommended."
"D: The odd after taste makes this a bit of a slow go for me."
"Overall, this is the first dubbel I've tried, so I have nothing to compare it to. I have to say I really enjoyed this one, but that could mean I just like this style of beer."
"[Mouth] Full and goood taste!!!. In deep i found yeast, vanilla? gentile bitterness and alcohol notes. Good belgian dubbel beer"
"Pours a dark brown/black colored body, with a white-tan head. Has a nice aroma of molasses, and flowers. Fizziness in the taste, some molasses, slight floralness, and a dry aftertaste, not bitter. Has a warming mouthfeel."
"Overall: To me I feel that this beer miss the mark for a dubbel. The mouthfeel is flat with an astringent finish. I was hopping something more but I was dissapointed"
"Tap at Pizza Port Carlsbad. Mahogany pour with the remnants of a tan head. Malt, yeast, dates, and fruits in the nose. Velvety mouthfeel. Earthy and yeasty, with a sweet malt, plums, and some banana esters. Could have been better on a colder day given its weight."
"D - Almost cloyingly sweet, but paired well with a good meal will probably benefit this beer."
"pours a dark ruby/ brown with a bthin beige head that quickly dissolves into a lacing that lasts throughout. Aroma of dark berries, roasted malt, yeast and alcohol. High carbonation up front that loses its intensity as the beer wamrs up. Sweet hints of raisin, plum, grape, black cherries and malty chocolate/caramel with a slightly dry finish.."
"Easy to drink but nearly too sweet."
"Decent Dubbel with an ok amount of alochol gives this a good drinkability."
"Nice beer that is a little hoppier than other dubbels, less fruity."
"D: Very much so. For a dubbel of relatively low abv, packs in a ton of flavors and taste that many higher abvs lack. This has me eager to try out some other beers from these guys."
"This beer has fairly lively carbonation that adds a good bite. Extremely drinkable for 7%, I'm very glad to finally have tried a trappist ale!"
"Nice beer and one worth trying and pair it with some chedder cheese for some extra excitrment."
"Notes: I prefer the tripel but this is a GREAT beer!"
"Fantastic beer."
"Drinkability- Right up there with a few of the best that I have had. Not quite up to Westvleteren status or Benedication of RR, but really nice and definitely worth a try."
"Pours a dark amber in color with distinct reddish hues at the edges and a fleeting off-white head. Aroma is subdued, some light malty sweetness, a notable vinous character, namely figs, plums and raisins, and just a touch of spicy phenols. Taste is similar to the aroma but includes a wider range of esters. Figs, plums, raisins, and dark cherries are again present but a slight banana character is also evident. There is just a touch of bitterness here and a noticeable but not hot or solvently alcohol presence. Good, malty backbone. Mouthfeel is good, medium body, medium carbonation, and as mentioned before a slight alcohol presence. Drinkability is pretty good, complex flavors and low alcohol presence despite the 7% ABV (as listed on the bottle). Overall this is an easily drinkable beer this was quite enjoyable."
"Koningshoeven Quadrupel is one of the finest examples of the style that I've reviewed so far. Unfortunately, both Tilburg's Dutch Brown and Koningshoeven Dubbel fail to impress. If you're curious about the style, start elsewhere. If you love the style, I'd recommend leaving this one on the shelves."
"D - A bit too sugary and under-hopped IMO. The nose is subtly complex, but the flavor is too cloying. This is good stuff. though. A chocolaty desert sipper for sure."
"Label showed 7% abv"
"Awesome."
"***First beer of the night... hard act to follow...."
"Overall - A little bit like a lighter version of the Quadrupel. Very good overall."
"Very good beer. I enjoyed this one quite a bit. It's a well-made, no frills Dubbel, crafted expertly by Trappist monks... I guess. That's how I like to think of it, anyway. I'm not overly familiar with this style of beer, so I don't really know how this one stacks up with other Dubbels. It's not big on complexity, but it's got a great flavor and is, overall, a solid beer. I suggest picking it up, especially for fans of the style. Recommended."
"This produced a light, medium-tan head on the pour, but with low retention. The nose was extremely sweet and sugary. The color was a slightly hazy light-brown. The mouthfeel was medium with a sugary sweetness on the tongue. The finish was still equally sweet. It strikes me that this might have been a young bottle, as I have had this beer age and it really becomes much less sweet. I still recommend it."
"Of all the Trappist breweries, this is the one that I came to learn about latest. Poured in to my Westmalle chalice a dark ruby red complexion, with a strong, buttery white heading with substantial retention. Aroma is lovely, made up with vinous fruits such as plum, raisin, strawberry, fig and date. Bits of earth and spice lurk in the corners of the nose. Taste is complex in every sense of the word. More of the same fruit, earth and spice, which has the ability to almost lift the palate up while inside. After letting it swish around the mouth a bit, and after swallowing, there is a slight numbing sensation as the flavors and alcohol marry in the finish. Body is medium, and despite being a beer to sip and savor, is beautiful in its drinkability. As i sat with this beer over the course of an hour, I listened to the monks singing on the Weihenstephaner tour section of the website. Although that brewery is German, and this beer Belgian, I truly felt like I was tasting a bit of history. I would go so far as to say the atmosphere was a bit haunting. A delicate, complex Trappist beer that I cannot say enough about."
"Poured a deep red brown colour with a frothy head that didn't last all that long. Smells very sweet and malt/caramelly. Taste sweet/caramel with a slight bitter aftertaste. Quite light on the carbonation and has a very solid mouthfeel. Quite tasty :)"
"Palate is well balanced, still vinous, more cherry. Mouthfeel is a bit fizzy for my taste. Ripe fruit. Quite good. I can't compare this to the Trip or the Quad but I'd get it again."
"Very drinkable and enjoyable beer, but I wouldn't seek this one out again any time soon (taste isn't worth the price tag)."
"Drinkability: If not for the price could drink these all day. Not much going for it, probably wouldn't buy this one again."
"Overall, this isn't the best dubbel I've had, but it is still pretty satisfying, Good attempt by a pretty good Trappist brewer."
"I tried this beer on May 9, 2008 at ""Smokeless Joe's"" in Toronto, Ontario on tap. The beer was a beautiful dark brown with some plum coloured hints and a thin, rocky, tan coloured head. The aroma was sweet malt, with some yeasty tones, as well as chocolate and cherry hints. The mouthfeel was medium bodied, mildly carbonated, and slightly creamy. The flavour was caramel malt, some other fruit flavours like cherries and plum, and a little hoppish bitterness to round it out. I loved this beer."
"Overall: great beer. Very well balanced and very complex with a strong personality. Wonderful example of the style and a must have."
"To sum it all up, a quote from the Missus: ""It's like a hug in a bottle."""
"11.2 oz bottle with an ABV of 7% on the label. This beer is a very dark brown with maybe some red tints with a lingering tan head. The smell is very fruity, chocolates, and also vinegar. The taste is malty and fruity but it smells better than it tastes. If you like dubbels, this delivers."
"Notes: A terrific Trappist treat. Mine's from 2008 and the bottle is different then the picture shown. It's still delicious though."
"Toasted malt and caramel up front. Esters and dark banana bread follow and blend with raisin and date sweetness. Yeasty. Caramelized brown sugar. Mild herbal, woody bitterness joins the toasted sweet fruit malt in the finish. Nice. Medium-full body with a smooth feel. I'm quite impressed with this dubbel! Even a bit surprised."
"D = Good drinkability. Not the best Trappist Dubbel, but it's not like any of them are bad. This would be a very good beer to drink while sitting back and watching it snow on a Winter's day"
"D: Not a whole lot to offer aside from sweetness. I'm probably won't be seeking this out in the future, but I definitely wouldn't complain if this were the only brew available."
"A good beer but not one I'd get often."
"Notes: Solid and enjoyable, but probably one of the lesser trappist dubbels."
"Drinkability - not a bad brew, just didn't impress me, it was kind of ordinary"
"This poured a dark and hazy mahogany with very little tan head. It smelled very strange, like roasted orange and malt. The flavor was just as strange, like oak and honey with some malt and hops, fairly sweet but only slightly bitter. It was watery with lots of carbonation, and had a mild and sugary aftertaste. Overall this was a very strange drink, but it was enjoyable."
"D: Very peculiar the final aftertaste is interesting as well very woody."
"It had a nice reddish, brown color, with a minimal head. The smell was good, but not great. Smelled like syrup and raisins, niether one of my favorite flavors. Taste was about the same.. syrupy, raisiny, with a touch of apples a caramel. This beer was pretty good, I'd try it again."
"-With all of that said, this was probably my least favorite of all the trappist beers."
"drinkability is great. this beer advocate can finish off a 1 pint 9 oz growler in one sitting and love every sip, which is more than can be said for most brews. cheers!"
"one of the worlds nicer more mellow dubbels!!"
"d - A great tasting dubbel. I enjoyed this much more than the chimay red. It has more fruit and sweetness along with some good spicy flavors to balance it out."
"There are better Dubbels out there."
"My second beer from Koningshoeven, and from what I understand, this brewery once sported the authentic Trappist Logo, but after commercializing their brewing process, were stripped of that accolade... nevertheless, this is still a world-class Dubbel... a great representation of the style with a wonderful dark brown, ruby-red appearance with an impressive foamy, frothy head... smell is full of dried fruit, figs, and malts... taste strongly complements the aroma, with thick malts, heavy toffee, slight vanilla, rum, brandy, and nut flavors that is ultra-rich, thick, and creamy... certainly a top-notch brew... demands respect and is one of the better Dubbels out there... good mouthfeel and pretty easy drinkability... very malty and rich... definitely recommended..."
"D- The nose and the beer taste could not be more different. Interesting brew but not my favorite."
"Pours an extremely dark ruby brown with minimal head after a minute. The nose smells like my mothers chocolate chip cookies. Touch of cherries. Sugar is there, but that is part of mommas chocolate chip cookies. Malty subdued flavor that has a caramelized sugar edge to it. Seems to be lacing something. Perhaps this bottle is beyond its life. Feel is thin to standard. Not all the way bubbly, but still seems to be missing something. Drinkable I guess. I am wondering if this bottle is too old."
"After fighting the champaign cork and eventually pulling out the waiters key when no one was looking I managed to remove the insistent cork. The dubbel poured into my goblet with a dense head of natural carbonation provided by the bottle conditioning. The thick tan foam lingers minutes after the pour. The nose is not nearly as appealing as the appearance with overt sweetness as though the yeast did not attenuate well. After that is the note of old yeast and the distinct leathery note of wild yeast; finishing with fig, spice, and maybe a hint of black cherry and raisin. The nose deceives the taste. The body is full and nicely carbonated, the under attenuation I worried about is not an issue. Wild yeast provide a dominate leather taste and leave their characteristic sour note on the tongue. Not the best Trappist of this style, but certainly an enjoyable experience worth trying and maybe revisiting."
"A fantastic dubbel and one that I buy everytime I want a taste of a real dubbel... more complex than my tongue and brain can describe..but not too far out there for a relative novice to savor."
"Presentation: Packaged in a custom brown glass 11.2 ounce longneck bottle with a La Trappe logo, served in an Orval goblet."
"belle bière brune avec léger reflet rouge, très effervescente la mousse brune a disparu très rapidement, nez frais de caramel, de malt, la bouche est ronde, un pointe d'alcool, une touche épicé, rafraichissante et très agréable."
"D: It's alright, but it'd be better with some carbonation."
"Another nice brew from Koningshoeven, if not as remarkable as their quadrupel."
"I would have to say is my least favorite of the Trappist beers. ( at least so far & I have sample all of the other 6 Trappist brews.) Definitely an oak flavor, great aroma with a hint of bananas. The finish is short and seems to have something missing... almost flat. The head is good that reduces to lacing along the side of the glass. Overall a good beer that will have its place on my shelf, but will have limited appeal."
"This is a very individual and worthwhile beer, perhaps it has changed recipe since I tasted it last. I have had this on tap in Netherlands, and don't recall it being as ""sharp""."
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability: Really heavily carbonated. I expected something high, but I believe that this is too much; seems to me that the carbonation is scrubbing the tongue before I have a chance to really taste the brew, really gets in the way. I'll finish my glass and enjoy it, but this is a beer I'll not buy again. However, I'd not be opposed to drinking it again, if offered I'd gladly accept, but its not worth the money."
"Update February 2011: There is no medicinal aroma in the nose this time, the beer isn't watery at all, and it is just a delight in everyway. I'm adding points on."
"D - Not something I'd drink all the time but I could see it being a semi-regular purchase for me."
"Tasty, complex, and easy to drink, a pretty solid dubbel."
"A very rich, sweet, indulgent and good beer in my opinion. Perhaps a little too much so, to the point that it reduces its drinkability (although drinking the one was certainly no chore!). I wish I had some some strong cheddar cheese to pair with it. Cheaper than most Belgian alternatives, and better than many of them. I will be trying it again."
"D--This beer just did not do it for me. Not a bad beer in the bigger picture but certainly not something I would ever buy again. Not the kind of Dubbel I was hoping for."
"10 and I think I am going to put it at the same level or above the contemporary Chimay Blue. Truly a GREAT beer and if I were to coin the experience in a phrase... ""Immensely fruity tasty and sweet; totally complex and immaculately balanced; full of strength and character yet unbelievably smooth"". Very nicely aged... Kudoz to the owner who aged it so very well."
"Not a standout beer, then again not a standout Trappist. In any case this was a tasty dubbel and I do feel the Koningshoeven line to be under-appreciated by most people."
"Pours a dark ruby brown with a decent amount of creamy tan head that fades away to a thin layer fairly quickly. Smells yeasty and sweet, hints of raisins and chocolate and a tiny bit of berry. The taste is very similar to the smell, sweet, a little chocolatey, raisiny, some berry and lots of maltiness. The mouthfeel is heavy and slightly fizzy, but mostly creamy. Overall, it's a very drinkable and tasty belgian-style dubbel. I'll be getting this again."
"A very good Trappist Dubble from Koningshoeven. This is a beer I can't wait to enjoy again."
"Pours out a color that is reminiscent of a mix between a ruby and an amethyst. Head is thinnish, with pock marks on the top. Smell is a pleasant mix of dried fruit, hints of spicy phenols, brown sugar, and toasted malts. Flavor starts off with brown sugar and molasses which is then followed by some weak (thankfully) phenols then followed by toasty malts, dried figs, and grassy hop. Mouthfeel is slightly more than moderate in weight, with some stickiness on the tongue. Carbonation is effervescent. Solid dubbel all-around."
"D - A pretty good dubbel. Not bad considering it is not a true Belgian beer."
"A very drinkable dubbel from the Dutch trappists. This is a much more rounded and balanced beer than their Quad, very drinkable and could even be considered somewhat of a sessionable belgian dark."
"The body is medium to full. Plenty of crisp carbonation. Probably more than I would care for in the style. Easy to drink, especially for a belgian style. Glad to finally have these trappist beers in the state of Iowa."
"ABV, listed at 7% on the bottle, is well hidden."
"Poured from a 750 mil corked bottle that I bought in Amsterdam in January 2006. It's been aging in my beer cellar, and it was time to drink it this past Friday 6/29/07. Poured it into two La Trappe chalices (also purchased in AMS) for my wife and me. Smelled like a nice dubbel upon pouring, but I was a bit somewhat disappointed at the lack of huge head. It was there, but kinda small and faded fast. Appearance was good enough, a nice dark brown color. The flavor though was amazing. It tasted like a nice blend of cherry and fig. Drinking this beer brought back memories of all the good brews I drank in Holland. This is a great example of a dubbel."
"Notes: Loved it. The smoothness, restrained malt dominance, and the slightly spiced backside make this a can't miss."
"From my notes 6/6/2007 pours one-finger light tan head that fades quickly to a ring leaving a good lace. Deep mahogany color. Caramel nose. Light-medium carbonation and medium bodied. Flavor is a nutty brown and some caramel. On-tap for 2.40 ($3.29) for a 250ml chalice from Corner House Cafe Amsterdam, NL."
"Served in a chalice, the beer pours a chestnut brown color with a half-inch tan head. Head retention is low, but the lacing is good. It smells like dark fruit, bananas, caramel and brown sugar. The taste is the same as it smells, except there's some spicyness in the taste. Body is medium, with a decent amount of carbonation. However, it seems a little watery at times. Drinkability is good, it's easy to drink, smooth and a bit dry. I think it's a decent Dubbel, I'd buy it again."
"A very nice Dubbel. Would gladly drink this again."
"It tastes as it smells, with a subtleness throughout. Well balanced with a pleasant sweet, fruity lingering finish. A good medium-full body with a listed (on the bottle) 7%ABV, that is very easy to drink and a good representation of the style. Another solid Trappist that's always a treat!"
"A very drinkable double. Enjoyable, ill have another please."
"Drank very easy, dubbels are my favorite trappist-style. Having said that, probably middle of the pack for dubbels (still nice to quaff& would happily session on this)"
"D: Definately drinkable. Aroma and taste works beautifully together and deepens each others qualities. A beautiful beer and very tasty."
"Poured into a snifter, pours an amazing blackish red with a fluffy 2 finger head that leaves some thick heavy lace on the glass. Smell is of yeasty bready and a bit of dried old fruit and also a strong smell ofo alchohol. Taste is very bready and malty with with a strong taste of alchohol and heavy carbonation. After drinking this I felt a bit dissapointed, the look and the smell were pretty awesome, that being about it the taste was a carbonated mess that was not really that good IMO, anyways its nice to drink something from the old land."
"Out of a 750ml corked and caged bottle. Pours a deep brown color with an average tan head the left some lacing on the side of the glass. This review was based off of the last half of the bottle so plenty of yeast floaters suspended in the glass. The smell is sweet, plums, has a hint of grape-wine aroma. The taste is of dark fruit & carob, musty & earthy, some roasted nut qualities to it. The feel is well carbonated, light to moderate body, slightly bitter aftertaste. A pretty crisp and refreshing dubbel with a nice balance, very drinkable."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with dryness lingering of cherrywood and plums with a cocoa powder finishing it off. A fine level of carbonation mixes with a warming, bready feel. Nice."
"Pours a red/brown color, with a tan head that disipates too quickly and leaving a poor lace. Primary smell is wet earth, then you find later the subtleties: cherries, cocoa, licorice and spices. Rough roasted flavour, though the body is lighter than expected and mouth of cocoa, licorice, plums and fruits. Sweet finish."
"Sort of a demanding beer, the taste is stronger than I have found in most Dubbel ales. Not bad at all, but there are others that I find better."
"Poured in a very nice dark copper colour and with a thick, creamy head on top. A big smell of sweet caramel, yeast, fruits and licorice filling the room. The taste was equally good. Bitter sweet, yeasty with a pit of violets in the middle somewhere. Very flowery on the back of the palate. The double is definately better when compared with La Trappe Tripel. Usually it is the other way around."
"Not a bad beer, and considering that Dubbels are my least favorite Belgian-type beer, well it is even drinkable"
"11.2fl oz bottle poured into a goblet. Pours a dark brown color with a large white tan head. The aroma is sweet malt, dark fruits, chocolate, spice and yeast. The taste is sweet and a bit roasty with some spices and a mild hop finish. Overall, this is another stellar belgian dubbel in what is without question one of my favorite styles. Recommended."
"Mouthfeel on this baby is great. Beautifully soft bubbles in this one almost hide its high effervesence and make this dubbel a real easy drinker. Not too complex for sure, but a greatly approachable and highly drinkable trappist."
"Westmalle Dubbel knocks spots off this beer in my eyes, but it is still a very drinkable beer. This was a fairly young beer, I have one more left, I intend to age it and see what it is like in a couple of years time."
"Pours dark amber with a head that fades quickly. Smells of dried fruit and spice. Tastes of spice, raisens, and yeast in that order and then hops in the after taste. Slightly acidic with a warm alcohol feel but not taste. Carbonation is light but not thin. Well rounded beer. Would definately drink again."
"All in all , a nice drinkable dubbel."
"Pours a dark, russet brown with a delicate head that fades to a tight-bubbled, thin layer on top of the beer. Very fruity, caramel-tinged aromas complex with phenols, fruits (apples, figs), and candi sugar. On the palate, very fruity (raisins, apples), fairly sweet for the style, with a wonderful nutty undercurrent that crops up midway through the palate. In spite of all the sweetness, there's a cutting acidity throughout, but it doesn't bring to mind hop bitterness at all... instead it seems a bit chemical in nature. That, and the big carbonation, lighten the mouthfeel somewhat, making it lightly juicy instead of heavy, or maybe on the heavy side of medium. Overall, this is a very enjoyable dubbel, not up to the standards of the best in the style, but very good for the everyday."
"Good to see this back as ""authentic trappist product"". The last ""crock"" I had over a year ago did not have the logo. Was too long ago to tell if the beer has changed. However this one is certainly worthy of the name."
"Poured a deep ruby read color that was just barely not opaque. Good thick head that was diminishing and left spotty lacing on the glass. The aroma was an interesting blend of malts, dried fruits, crisp yeast with some alcohol presence. The taste was very complex. There was an interesting fruitiness that blended well with a great sweetness well balanced by some subdued hops. There was a good yeast bite in the flavor as well. The mouthfeel possessed a great level of carbonation. The alcohol was well hidden, but there was still a slight astringency present, but not too much. Overall, this is a very enjoyable beer, but not something I can have that much of. I would certainly try and find this for special occasions."
"The pour into my now venerable (despite never having held the actual nectar) Westvleteren glass raises a short light tan head that dissipates quickly, falling to slight surface lacing and a thick glass ring. The body is a deep, dark brown, which is practically opaque at its core. Red highlights abound, too. The nose, which I expected to be full of berry and fruit scents like the Ommegang I had a few days ago, is actually quite muted in that regard. Rather, it speaks of rich caramel, with toasted notes. It seems fairly straightforward. The taste has more of a fruit flavor, but in a light and toasty way, with a subtle caramel aftertaste. A bit sour, but only just. The mouth is medium, lighter than many dubbels, with a high but fine carbonation. A nice, mellow, and very approachable dubbel. Perhap not worth the cost (> $4/btl), but tasty nonetheless."
"Drinkability: Great dubbel - could sip on this one all night. In my opinion, it rightfully has a place as one of the exclusive trappist brews - lekker"
"It's something worth trying, but not something I'd recommend."
"Overall: A good, malty, semi-fruity dubbel. Recommended."
"Not their best beer, but a decent dubbel."
"D - The alcohol does the most damage here. It is a decent double, but there are much better ones out there."
"The Koningshoeven dubbel to me poured beautifully, a light lace on top, even though I poured it a little too softly attempting to keep the yeast at the bottom of the bottle(to no avail). Aroma is hugely bananna, with a touch of malt and spice in the back to even it out. Taste is nice, sharp and balanced, no one flavor really jumps out and smacks you in the back of the head, but the slight fruitiness, subtle malt and the sharpness of the alchohol blend beautifully in this textbook example of a dubbel."
"Other comments: The cork was nearly impossible to remove, but once I got it open, I found a gorgeous-looking, heavenly-smelling, humble dubbel that is quite pleasing to drink, despite it being somewhat bland."
"A bit cloying for my tastes."
"D - An above average offering, which is certainly worth trying."
"The beer was very pleasantly carbonated which greatly enhanced the flavor. I tasted some hops, malts, yeasts, and grains as well as distinct overtones of alcohol from start to finish. I very much liked this beer overall."
"($5.99 / 25.4 oz. tall straight brown wine-like bottle, corked, and caged)"
"Poured very dark with a nice red hue and a big three finger light brown head, good lacing. Smells of cloves and spicy apples and malt. Tastes of cloves and hops with a mild bitter almost toasty finish. Very silky mouthfeel and quite drinkable. I picked up a four pack of these and really enjoyed every one of them."
"This beer poured a dark brown cloudy color with a cream colored head that lasted for about a minute. The smell is very malty. The taste is malty with a hint of nut. The mouthfeel is full and has a carbonation bite when swirled around the tongue. This is a delightful beer which I find very drinkable."
"Opinion: This is a very nice beer. The flavor seems oddly ""hollow"" to me, and I am not sure what makes me say that except that it may be that the mouthfeel is so neutral that it glides over your palate, and you have to almost struggle to notice it. This isn't bad, but it gives it a watery impression. The entire experience with this beer was refreshing and clean. A nice beer, and one that I am sure I will drink again."
"Dark copper in color with moderate head and lacing until finished. Picked up malt, esters (melons & roses?), maybe ginger and a whiff of alcohol in the smell. Taste was very malty, with little hops if any. Some type of spice was present as well, maybe ginger or coriander. Mouthfeel was slick with little carbonation. Overall, a nice sipper, reminded me of Chimay blue."
"Koningshoeven Dubbel pours a dark brown with a thin head from a brown 11.2 ounce bottle. Smell is definitely strong, malt dominated, with some alcohol present. Taste is also dominated by the malt at first, then there are some chocolate flavors that pop up near the end. Alcohol is also noticeable toward the finish, about the same time as the chocolate becomes noticeable. I don't care too much for the malt up front, tastes funky to me, but I'm sure its appropriate to the style. This becomes less noticeable as the beer warms. Interesting beer. Definitely worth a try."
"Overall, a very drinkable beer of the style. Quite delicious with lots of character."
"What a dubbel this turned out to be! Very pleased. Nice sweet plum smell on the nose, light carbonation, sweet caramel/plum taste and light on the taste. Nice appearance too, not a lot of head, but leaves some tracing. And the drinkability is exceptional. A highly recommended double, without that garbage lemony taste that some possess."
"This pours a dark reddish brown with a smallish head. The smell is one of roasted malt or grains and some dark fruits. The taste, like the smell, is dark fruit and roasted malt or grains. The m/f is light and the flavors mix well. Not a bad beer, although a higher alcohol content would give it a needed bite, still this is a very drinkable beer that should not be missed."
"Drinkability: Overall I found this beer to be quite enjoyable. Probably not the best Dubbel around, but it's still good."
"Last swigs: Tasty yet a tad on the fragile side. Worth trying. Something tells me that this bottle was a little on the old side."
"750 ml corked and bailed bottle."
"Overall - A very good beer.... Recommended... Probably could have done with some aging though..."
"Pours out a clear rich mahogany color with a fluffy tan head. Nose is sharply phenolic with points of caramel and malt. Spicy, fruity yeast notes are the dominant flavor, with malt taking more of a backseat than I expected. Peppery alcohol is noticible despite the low strength. Soft in the mouth, with a bit of a watery feel to it."
"The mouth is smooth and not overwhelming. The malt, hop, and alcohol balance is great. The finish is medium with a lasting impression of toffee."
"Aroma is fairly sharp and features dark candied fruits, sweet breads and mild spicey notes. Opaque red/brown body holds a two finger thick, creamy tan head. Fore is candy sugar, yeast, spice, sweet bread, bannanas, apple, crusty churros and apple fritter crust. Quite damn flavorful with a very silky/creamy mouthfeel."
"Undoubtedly, the best offering from Koningshoeven. Very Trapist worthy. Rusty color with a ligh haze and yeast 'floaties' swirling around. Rocky eggshell colored head sprinkled with spices. Robust malt and musk aromas with belgian famous tartness, earthiness and a little Oud Brune characteristics. Very sweet to taste with dates, grapes, nuts, berries, figs, and perhaps a little syrup and chocolate. A little sticky-sweet in the mouth. The sweetness helps the high carbonation to remain smooth and less alcoholic hot. Remains spicy throughout the finish and aftertaste. A little bite-ey toward the end, mainly due to yeast and husk. Still, tasty stuff."

"Overall a good cheap dubbel. I could get this and not think twice when i have that craving for a dubble and dont have much money/or variety."
"The beer, however, is quite good."
"11.2 oz bottle: This one pours a cloudy, opaque mahogany brown color. There was almost no head on it, and it died off immediately. The aroma is quite nice. Many fruity scents in there, notably raisins, plums, and some others. The taste is quite good also. It is a tad sweet, and mainly consists of brown sugar, some caramel, a hint of alcohol, bananas and bit of yeastiness and breadiness. A full rich flavor. A very nice dubbel."
"Small bottle from a gift set box, which included the nice glass I'm sampling from.No freshness indication. Pours pretty clear, light-medium chocolate amber, with a roasted garlic colored head, leaving stringy lacing. Nose is distinctly of cola, also some vanilla and fruits mixed in. Fairly light bodied for a double, moderate carbonation. Sweet brew with notes of caramel, smoky raisins, gingerbread cookies and Belgian yeasty goodness. Nice easy drinking Dubbel."
"Overall: This one's okay: not really in that top echelon of Belgian dubbels, but also not too expensive. A nice enough stab at it."
"Bottle: Poured a dark brown color ale with a medium off-white foamy head with average retention. Aroma of sugary malt with some Belgian type yeast. Taste is really good with a nice mix between sweet caramel malt and fresh cookie with a touch of Belgian yeast. The mouthfeel is a creamy but also watery and I believe this is the main default of this beer. Body is way too thin for the style."
"Body is between light and medium, a tad too thin. Texture is light and fluffy, and very quaffable."
"Drinkability: A fine dubbel. I've had trouble getting into Belgian style beers but this style clearly does the trick for me. I would imagine this going down fine as the months get colder. Strongly recommended."
"not bad."
"Notes: one fine dubbel"
"Pours dark brown with big pillowy tan head and lots of lacing. Smells almost too sweet; caramel and candi malts on strong alcohol base. Taste and mouth-feel are very poor; a mess of sticky, carbonated, and overwhelmingly boozy bubble-gum that overpowers everything else. No hop-profile or dryness to speak of. An exceedingly inferior dubbel."
"Notes: I've had this beer maybe 5 or 6 times, and the taste has been pretty consistent. I'll drink this again and again."
"Carbonation was fairly low and the mouthfeel was moderate and clean with just a hint of girth. Drinkability was through the roof because while it lacked much in the way of overall complexity it greatly made up in appreciable simplicity of flavor and ease of quaffing. Nary a bite of alcohol or other obnoxious faults. Pure and simple."
" A great dubble here."
"The mouthfeel is full enough without going to far, but suffers a bit from too much tingle. Quite drinkable, even if it's $2.99+ a single."
"For me, this was not as impressive as some of the other trappist of abbey specialty dubbels, but this would be a beer to keep semi-chilled, and bring out at you house if you friends over for a casual dinner. Perhaps this would be excellent at a pub with fries and a giant burger."
"I can't wait to try this in the 750 mL corked and caged version."
"This is a nice dubbel, very user friendly. Not as complex as some but very enjoyable and drinkable."
"Mouthfeel is chewy, not watery, and pleasant. I could and would be content with drinking only this all night. A really well-rounded beer on the whole."
"Drinkable? Like water. Beer shouldnt be so. I cant recommend anything to pair this with, food-wise. I say dont drink it. I purchased my 750ml on sale in Parkville, MO for $3.00. I wouldnt buy it again for half that. Skip."
"I'm actually very happy with this ale. It works well after dinner and with the very reasonable price ($6) I will definitely be going back for more. Thanks to Nick at Bauer Wine for help with this selection and the wonderful chalice."
"Pours a deep dark copper with a generous fluffy tan head. Smells of brown sugar, caramel dark fruit (raisins and plums) with a slight alcohol nose and a bit of sour smell. Tastes much like it smells, dark fruit and malty sweetness. Low hop bitterness, noticable alcohol, slightly sweet finish. Mouthfeel is full and carbonation medium. A very good dubbel, not as good as their blonde, but still good."
"Scents of fruit and alcohol. Tastes generally fruity. Substantially malty, with a chunky texture, and banana and kiwi notes. Smooth and tart. Aftertaste of berries. Raspberry in front. Esthers abound. The malt finishes smoothly, without dryness or cloying. Scent strong but not well-definable or identifiable. Overall very nice."
"Really just a skein of head that quickly peters out to a desultory wash with some volcanic action erupting from time to time in the middle. Magenta hue with touches of brown and claret, difficult to see through though I know there are things happening in there. Realy raising and tons of fermented dates on nose with some freshly tilled earthiness and pumpernickel. Very meaty malt to taste, with some salty black walnuts, craisins, blackberry jam, and a bit of roasted pepper all swirling around. Quite tasty."
"Nice hazy burgandy color with a loose tan head. Decent amount of lacing. Very vinous aroma. Lots of purple grapes and alcohol along with an acidic punch that burns my nose a little. Flavors have more grape notes to them. There's a citric tart underneath along with some yeasty spicyness. Hops come towards the finish with a good dose of acidic. Long dry, lingering finish. Body is thinner when cold and thicker when warmer. Flavors come together and work really well when this beer warms up a bit. A solid beer all around."
"Drinkability: very high. A wonderfully made brew with great balance and good complexity, like all the others I've had from this brewery."
"An okay dubbel, but there are better options out there. I got this one as part of a gift pack and don't think I'll be returning to it soon."
"Certainly a quality brew, and probably a favorite for dubbel fans. For my money though, when it comes to the Trappists I'll always reach for a tripel."
"the problem with this is the drinkability- so high and i only have the one at proper temp."
"Okay, mind you this is the first Trappist Ale I've tried and my comparison is obviously limited. However, if others retain the same qualities, I may have found my new favorite style. Great head retention, carbonation and lacing. Appears like cream soda. First tastes of butterscotch followed by light liquid candy on the lips. Enjoyed every sip. Not sure if i could drink more that two in a session. Paid $2.99 for a 12oz bottle."
"Overall a good beer. I would buy this again."
"Brownish brew with tan head that falls to ring of foam. Aromas dark fruits, spices, and candy like chocolate hints some alcohol also in the nose.Taste is good semi sweet malt spices with fruit coming thru raisins plums good mouthfeel aided by burst of carbontation in the middle. Finishes nice creamy lingering sweetness with some spices. No aclohol in the taste but it does warm the body some. Mouthfeel was good solid medium ligth carbonation except for that little burst in the middle. Drinkability is good not the best dubbel but not bad. Thanks to merlin48 for the sample."
"This was the second beer on La Trappe night... and a good one, as it was a step up from the Enkel."
"Overall, a decent dubbel but there are many that are much better."
"Gotten for a song at Premier Gourmet, made a great sharing with a business associate. While not as tasty as complex as the quad and trippel, it was tod rink slowly form like a fine wine. Strong alcohol and quality yeast aroma. Winish red-auburn colour. Initial head and retained thin lace. Moderate malt, with raspberry mid-sip."
"Overall a decent dubbel. Nothing to go crazy about, just a nice run of the mill dubble."
"La Trappe version. I'd imagine this beer has some age behind it because it's still labeled as La Trappe, and I've sat on it myself for a couple of years. Served lightly chilled. Pours a nice coppery brown with some ruby highlights. Frothy beige head that seemed rather fizzy, like cola carbonation. Good roasted malt aspect to it (slight suggestion of whiskey malt), with some raisiny fruitiness, light fudgy chocolate and woody esters in the nose. Mouthfeel is spritzy, melding well with the robust malt, and an earthiness bordering on woody and spicy. This dubbel is rather remarkable in the sense of it's complexity. Fruity notions like dates, raisins and prune. Never overly sweet or cloying, because a slight vegetal woody astringency in the finish keeps each sip a savory delight. I feel like my heart should be sinking, knowing I'll never have this La Trappe version of Koningshoeven's beer again, but I'm just busy enjoying it. Enjoyable it is."
"When you pour this brew it is a symphony of differing aromas, and that intrigues you immeadiately! The head floats like a summer cloud as you pour it into a suitable tulip glass to admire it's mahogany hue. What a wild aromatic bonanza! The taste is excellent with a tangy flavor highlighted by a peppery overtone. I love the overally spicy, fruity complexness. Mouthfeel is soft, well rounded and balanced. A great Belgium Dubbel that I will love to taste again and again. Yummm."
"Unfortunately, the toffee malt and bread from the nose just don't develop. It gets better at temperature: creamier, more syrup. But it still doesn't blow my socks off."
"The beer pours a nice deep brown color, letting a bit of light through. The head is nothing but a covering over top of the beer. The nose is all sweet malts, none of the fig/rasin character I expect. Hmm...The flavor is the same...Lacking and weak. The flavor is thin and not what I want from this kind of beer. Mouthfeel is also a bit thin for my liking as well. Overall, this one is left me wanting a bit more."
"Pours a dark brown color with no head at all. No lacing either. Has a slightly fruity aroma with a lot of malty goodness and sweet. The flavor is all malts. I wouldn't really call this a good dubbel, but it's an ok beer - nice malt character. Doesn't have the fruit or yeast character that it should. A decent beer, but not great for the style."
"Not a headknocker, but pleasant enough. Cream colored head itself has nice, spicy, candy taste. Nice brown beer with orange highlights, shows bubbles drifting up as sediment settles down. Taste brings out oranges, raisins, a bit of wine and light spiciness, on a well-warmed, rather that roasted, malt base. Comes off like a fresh barley wine. May not be the very best of its kind, but darn close, and its alcohol warmth makes a nice way to break a Lenten abstinence of over a month (and circumstances kept me away from home where I had a store of actual Trappist ales to enjoy on Easter. This was a good substitute)."
"I had this before a Chimay Red (this was better), followed by a Westmalle (which is better than both). Nice, dark fruity flavor. Definitely on the sweet side, but not too much so. Medium to full body, creamy and smooth. One of the better dubbel's I've had. Not up there with the Westy or the Westmalle, but very good. This just showed up in a local store (in four packs). I will certainly buy it again."
"A good, solid Dubbel. Not quite up there with the Westmalle and definitely not in the same league as the Westvleteren, but still an enjoyable brew. I will definitely purchase this again. I'm anxious to try their Tripel."
"All and all a beer that was alot thinner than I expected, but still worth a try."
"Murky and a bit on the pale side of walnut in color. Very fizzy at first, quickly settling to a lace of head. Aroma calls to mind a cherry cola. Flavor profile is remarkably restrained for the style. Mild caramel malt and some gentle fruity notes. Alcohol flavor is evident at the finish, but not too prominent. Interestingly, the aroma became a bit more pronounced as I progressed into the beer, whereas I usually stop noticing it after the first few sips of most beers, the cherry cola character even more distinct. While this beer is quite smooth, it is also a bit tame, even a little watery."
"Bursting with fruit character. Some grape/diacetyl flavors dominate. A decent doulbe, though by no means one of the greats."
"Worth trying again :)"
"This so mild and boring I drank a third of the bottle and then forgot about it until the next morning."
"It's certainly a drinkable beer, but for what I payed for this, I expect a much higher standard of quality. Nix the metallic taste, and this might turn into a great beer."
"A good drinking experience."
"Fine, persistent and dense brownish head on an intense opaque dark almost purple body. Medicinal aromas of herbs, citrus (grapefruit), and maybe some coffee. Very smooth mouthfeel, complex but not too heavy. A grapes and wine aspect combined with citrus is overwhelmed by a thick dark chocolate taste, which combines the dark malts and some of the bitterness very dark chocolates have. Enjoyable, but one of these is enough for the day."
"A very nice dubbel and is something I'd buy again."
"A top Dutch Trappist beer, well worth its price."
"Poured out a dark brownish-red with a nice head, but left no lacing on the glass. Smell was quite subdued. But there were some notes of some dark fruits. Perhaps a touch of peach in there as well. Taste was quite bold. Very full bodied with lots of character in this beer. Finished clean with some fruit aftertaste. A touch of spice is in there as well, but not much. A nice dubbel. This is a good full body to it, unlike some other dubbel's out on the market now."
"12oz bottle that has the Koningshoeven label yet embossed with LaTrappe.Poured a reddish brown and clear with a thick head that reduces quickly to a thin film that is dense and creamy looking. Fruity aroma with big notes of cherry coming through. Smooth creamy mouthfeel with a crisp carbonated edge. Nice sweet fruity flavor with cherries again and slightly spicy, possible herb flavor as well. Overall one of the best Dubbels I've had in awhile. Quite a nice flavor."
"I would definately buy this again."
"A fine dubbel, better than most I've tried."
"Definitely a nice one!"
"This was a nice dark brown colour with ruby red highlights. The aromas are of berries, other exotic fruits, slight spicy alcohol, light belgian candy sugar, yeast, malts, and hops. The taste is a nice blend of the above, and this brew really leans towards the fruitier, sweeter side of the spectrum. The mouthfeel is a bit thin, but it gets the job done and the drinkability is nice."
"A brown pour with a medium but rich tan head. The nose is sweet with toffee and dark, un sweetened chocolate. The taste starts somewhat bitter and then expands into malty and chocolately treat. Hints of cocoa and spice. A smooth and lively mouthfeel with a dry finish. I like the fact that this Dubbell was not as sweet as some others. The flavors here were more subtle and toned down. A decent beer althought it was not a classic."
"Deeply clouded hazelnut brown color with a tall light tan frothy thick head. Fades slowly to a skim and a thick firm ring around the edge, some drippy lace with some sticking in small ink blot patches. Smell is somewhat darkly fruity with plum and dark cherry; caramel floating in and quite a nice spicy clove on top. Some alcohol pokes through upon bigger whiffs and swirling. Taste is mild, lightly roasty hints up front, with creamy caramel locked in battle with crisp dark fruit notes and citrusy hops with some yeasty spicyness. Nice smooth and clean mouthfeel thats close to medium bodied with a light carbonation. Across the palate this is a bit short lived, and not strong at all, quite mellowing and mild. A nice drinker, but could use a bit of a boost."
"I have never consumed a brew such as this before, the smell and taste is of licorice(sp?) Full bodied, very dark and sweet. Lingering after taste....Glad that I met this brew, but do not think I could handle two in a row....."
"The beer poured a dark brown color with a thin head. There was a sweet malt aroma that aroused the senses. The beer had moderate body with good carbonation. The taste was of sweet malts with hints of chocolate that came through during the swallow. The malt lingers on the tongue for a bit, but dissolves quickly. The alcohol was not very noticeable. This dubbel is worth seeking out."
"I now read that this Ale is fermented in the bottle."
"This one comes out looking good. Its a dark brown with almost a touch of purple in there. Big tan head that sticks all over the place. Its got a malty smell, with a touch of alcohol detected. There are quite a lot of flavors going on in this beer. Some malty sweetness, with some lemon notes, plum as well perhaps. Some well balanced hops hidden in there carefully. Slight alcohol taste as well. This is my first beer of this kind so i have a hard time comparing it, but this is quite a sweet drink in my opinion."
"Beautiful deep cherry red verging on mahogony under a big, thick contoured tan head that lingers well and leaves sheets of lace. Outstanding presentation. The nose is mild and fruity, with more cherry than anything else. The mouth is slightly tingly and heavy with fruit. The taste is certainly good - nice, complex mix of flavors, from cherry to vanilla to caramel to malt. What's missing here is hops. The finish is fruity, the aftertaste is fruity. Maybe true to the style, but I want a bit of a bite. Still, I'd never turn down an offer to enjoy this brew again!"
"Overall Impression: A well-made beer with a couple of flaws. The metallic taste in the finish detracted from the experience. Also, needs a little body to fit the style IMO. Drinkability is good, its not filling and the dry finish invites another taste."
"A quality trappist dubbel, much better than Chimay and Westmalle in my book. Complex, yet smooth and sophisticated. Easy to drink, too!"
"A hazy, dark brown body reveals mahogany glints at the base of the goblet. The initially massive head of tan foam drops to a solid half-inch or more and leaves some very nice (but short lived) lace throughout the glass. In the nose some clear alcohol is present, though not bothersome; along with some rich malt, mild chocolate, soft dark fruit, and a dusting of delicate spiciness. It's gently zesty and then lightly creamy in the mouth as its warms; due to the combination of its medium body and very fine and lightly effervescent carbonation breaking out of suspension. The flavor is rich with soft and ripe dark fruit that's livened by a gently peppery spiciness. Sweetish toffee, caramel and chocolate appear in the finish; and the lingering aftertaste is dry with a residual fruity maltiness. Quite nice! This is possibly the shining star of the Koningshoeven line. The fermentation flaws that are more visible in the lighter bodied and more straightforward blonde and the ""hotter"" tripel are masked here - and even add character to it's peppery spiciness. Worth trying!"
"590"
"Sweet yeast nose. Dark burnt orange color witha 1/4 inch light brown head that has some rather large air bubbles. This settles into a rather slight sheen after a few moments. Big sweet malt, sour plum, chewy cooked caramel flavor. Full, faintly smooth, lively moth with lots of bubble action on the tongue. As the brew warms in the glass it becomes richer and smoother. This is quite a sweet rich brew and IMHO too much so. A little more balence would make it more drinkable for me."
"The Mouthfeel: a well balanced beer full bodied."
"This beer pours a very slightly hazy dark brownish red color with a clingy tan head. The mouthfeel is rounded while thinner than expected. The smell is sweet roasted malt and slightly citrusy. The taste is oaky with a sweet malty middle and a somewhat cedary finish. A nice smooth beer with a pleasant hoppy finish."
"This beer came out the bottle a very dark ruby-brownish color. The head exploded at first then settled down to just a thin sheet. The lacing was decent. The aroma is very fruity and flowery, with a nice malty sweetness to it. This brew tasted like it smelled, with the sweet malt up front. It was followed by a lite fruitiness and it was all topped off with a little bit of hops bitterness. The mouthfeel was a little thin and felt too carbonated but it was bad. I would drink this brew again, however I do think they charge too much. Overall this beer has good balance and is fairly easy to drink."
"Their new slogan is a tickle, too: ""Taste the Silence."" Sure, I'll be doing that just after I dance to the architecture!"
"Was lucky enough to find one of the last kegs in the states at the Taphouse in Bellevue, WA. This beer was damn near a religious experience for me. I am a very big fan of dubbels and this is everything I could have wanted. Poured a hazy dark brown with a nice thick layer of light brown head. Aromas were that of belgian yeast and candi sugar. Fruitiness and sweetness are most prevalent in the mouth with nice apple and pear undertones. Mouthfeel was spot on and the flavors were so well balanced that I could have had two or three (if it weren't for the alcohol level). It really is a shame that this beer will not be available any longer. I know Taphouse is going to be seeing a lot of my money till the last of the kegs is tapped."
"Damn, this was good. A huge, round, complete flavor. I could almost taste this one in my cheeks. I think that in my review of the blond, I said that it was my favorite of this brewery's beer. I was mistaken."
"(source: Habersham Discount Beverage; Savannah, GA)"
"Cloudy reddish-brown in color, huge sticky foamy head, leaves a clingy lacing in my glass, a lot of floaties. Malty fruity yeasty bubblegum aromas, fruity caremel apple banana flavors, medium-full body with a creamy mouthfeel, finishes sugary sweet, a good solid dubbel."
"The beer pours a nice deep brown, prosperous head, affluent lace, both depreciate quickly. Nose has grape like tones, malt, hints of chocolate, sweet. Start is sweet, the top light, the finish is tart, minimal carbonation, pleasantly hopped, the aftertaste malt dry with a touch of alcohol bitterness. Quite a decent drinking beer, and well worth the sample."
"Pours a caramel brown hue with a frothy tan head which leaves nice lace down the glass. Smells rather subdued with faint notes of yeast and malt. Taste is quite sweet up front with notes of raisins, apricot, yeast, and sweet malt. Creamy, smooth mouthfeel is fitting and it would not be difficult to turn down another one of these. A fine ale from La Trappe, or shall I say Koningshoeven?"
"Deep chestnut brown in hue w/ light haze. Initially thick light tan head settles into a thin, clinging layer. Decent lace is left. Bubblegum laced sweetness upfront in aroma, along with smooth, mellow chocolate and raisiny fruitiness. Notes of dark caramel and clove become more pronounced as the beer breathes. Refined, but appetizing aromawise. Flavorwise, the malt profile is dominated by clean, dark caramel notes from both dark crystal malt and candi sugar. Chocolate malt and bready notes provide secondary contrast and some depth to malt character. Yeast contributions are a milder extension of the aroma, being comprised of light bubblegum esters and clove phenol. Fairly light in body, but agreeably smooth and lightly dextrinous in mouthfeel. Hop bitterness is light, but residual sugars / dextrins remain low, so overall balance is only slightly skewed towards malt sweetness. Finishes relatively clean, with only a hint of yeast derived nuttiness. Not the most complex dubbel, but rich enough in character and light enough on the palate for excellent drinkability. I would not mind drinking several of these. La Trappe Dubbel is reminescent of an English Brown / Dubbel hybrid. This is the 11.2 oz bottle."
"Dark brown, ruby in color with a creamy thin head.    Dominant aroma is malty with a deep raisin-like fruitiness.  There is also a certian tartness to the smell, perhaps a bit of lemon.  Flavor is of a crisp, slightly roasty toffee.  Good malty body with an extremely well-balanced finish -- just slightly dry.  Slightly sweet aftertaste.  Medium-full bodied and creamy.  Very pleasant indeed."
"Deep chestnut appearance with a big and dark foamed milk-like head.  Slight candy to the nose, some prune aromas, along with a peat-like impression. Organic ""composty"" flavors and something else that leans toward phenolic. Dark and changing with elements of roasts, raisins, and deep cling peaches.  Just a spritz of hops.  Good flavors, carbonation works well in this beer.  Nice beer from the trappists ""across the border"".  ""Doubles"" are rapidly becoming my favorite Belgian-style brews."
"The beer is a murky looking brown color.  It pours a fizzy champagne-like beige head.  Fruit, caramel, figs and dates on the nose.  Taste is heavy on the figs and dates.  Some minor molasses tones mixed in as well as phenolic content, slight alcohol and just a tinge of vanilla.  Body is light to medium.  Nice little Trappist ale here."
"A solid dubbel that could be consumed in quantity."
"Huge nose of bananas and phenols. Malt sweetness in abundance, but quelled by a hearty dose of bittering hops. The wonderful earthiness one comes to expect from beers of this quality is here in abundance and my taste buds are happy now. I like Mulder's description of this beer, how it will haunt you. Seems rather fitting actually. Quality!"
"murky and dark in color...a huge tan head that sticks.  fruit aroma...lots of apple overtones.   a layered and complex taste of candied fruits and flavorful malts. minimal hopping. the mouthfeel was a bit lacking for a brew of this sort, but i didn't mind.   a welcome but slight alcohol burn in the end leaves the mouth tingling in delight.  divine."
"Notes: A prime example of the style, flavours meld together perfectly with out becoming confusing or vague. A semi sharp cheddar would make a ideal pairing."
"This beer poured a nice dark reddish color and formed a nice off white head that left some lace.  Some cirtrus, spice and hops aroma to it.  Finish seems to have some sweet elements to it.  Seemed to have a light to medium body to it.  Some spice elements and malt.  Couldn't detect any alcohol, which I prefer."
"Dark tan with a creamy head.  What I loved about this beer, was its smoothness.  I could not get over how subtle the hops and yeast combine with a medium bodies malty thinkness.  Sort of a caramel flavor, with a hint of sharpness that keeps it from being boring.  I had this with a meat suace and pasta, and it was great."
"This was my first foray into the world of Belgian and Trappist ales. It was a wonderful experience. Medium-dark reddish brown in color, the Dubbel has a nice fruity complexity in smell and taste that I had been previously unfamiliar with. It was also missing the spiciness of the alcohol and unusual yeast flavor present in many belgian ales. The only reason it took me so long to rate it was because the bar had it listed as simply La Trappe Trappist Ale. Just recently found out from the bar's website that it was the dubbel."
"Ok, but maybe a bit sweet and cloying sometimes, still, very well made trapiste beer, pretty good, but theres better examples of the style out there."
"A nice dubbel with fruity, sweet, mild spice and faint alcoholic undertones. A good changeup."
