4.3,3.6,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"750 ml bottle into signature chalice, bottled on 8/31/2013. Cork popped itself off when I uncaged it. Pours lightly hazy/cloudy reddish copper color with a 1 finger dense light khaki head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a large amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of raisin, plum, fig, pear, apple, pepper, caramel, brown sugar, toasted bread, light chocolate, light nuttiness, herbal, grass, and yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of fruity/spicy yeast and dark/bready malt notes; with good strength. Taste of big raisin, plum, fig, pear, apple, pepper, caramel, brown sugar, toasted bread, light nuttiness, light chocolate, herbal, grass, and yeast earthiness. Moderate amount of yeast spiciness on the finish; with lingering notes of raisin, plum, fig, pear, apple, pepper, caramel, brown sugar, toasted bread, light chocolate/nuttiness, herbal, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Incredible complexity and robustness of fruity/spicy yeast and dark/bready malt; with a great malt/yeast balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium body; with a very smooth and moderately creamy/bready mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming lingering after the finish. Overall this is an incredible dubbel style! All around awesome complexity, robustness, and balance of fruity/spicy yeast and dark/bready malt flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A highly enjoyable offering.","superspak","Mar 21, 2015"

3.25,-21.7,,,,,,"Review based on the BJCP2008 guidelines (style 18B). Bottle 33 cl - Batch L13-651. AROMA: complex aroma with malty caramely background and fruity aromas reminiscent of pinneaple and apricot. hop aromas absent. APPEARANCE: semi-dark copper with material in suspension. medium ivoey head with average retention. TASTE: flavour less rich than the aroma with mild sweet caramel notes. low apricot notes. low bitterness with a medium-dry finish. PALATE: medium body with medium carbonation. OVERALL: a dubbel with very nice aromas but, alas, not so complex flavours.","titvs","Dec 10, 2014"

The nuttiness adds a level to the brew making it more hearty that works well with the fruitiness and the oats. The dryness also makes the brew easy to drink, aching you for another gulp. There's nothing negative I can really say about this brew. Don't take my word for it, try it for yourself. This brew is Recommended.","Shroud0fdoom","Oct 20, 2014"

Apricots, slight clove and bready yeast ride the forefront of the bouquet with a hint of booziness in there somewhere. A long sip led to a smooth, unctuous mouthfeel filled with sweet dried fruit, great unfiltered yeast and a sweetness I can't put my finger on, non bitter chocolate? With an abv. of 7% there is an aftertaste of alcohol but not over powering by any means. A great beer.","MayonakaStout","Aug 10, 2014"

It is completely fermented… it’s has a fruity feeling like a South African dry Riesling, I’m not sure if this is the autolyzed yeast for a spice in the ingredients. It has a great dry wine taste at the end. Nothing like the American cascade hops… the bitterness I would interpret as dryness, it has a very wine feeling that would seem more than only the 7% that it is.","burntoutphilosopher","Aug 02, 2014"

AROMA: bright, aromatic hops; some apple and pear bake in a soft, doughy aura; some ginger or allspice as well...PALATE: almost light-bodied, dry, and beguilingly drinkable presence; smooth and inviting...TASTE: grape, grapefruit, and soft pine resin--soft, pleasant, after-dinner cordial warmth; slightly acidic... OVERALL: revisiting the first beer to make me say, "Whoa," Keanu style--and the beer does not disappoint to create a drinking experience where the beer IS the moment...the Chimay family grows in strength, but the opener in the sampler outperforms most other breweries' "first-ups by a long shot with drinkability and strength to spare...","dacrza1","Feb 16, 2014"

3.99,-3.9,3.75,4,4,4,4,"Poured from a 330 ml bottle into a genuine Chimay chalice. This iconic dubbel is a reddish-orange hue, less dark that one's Trappist beer schema might dictate, with a massive light tan head that retains form quite well. Smells like dried dark fruit (figs and dates), sweet white bread, cola-like brown spices, and a little cellar musty character. Palate is sweet, herbal, spicy, somewhat medicinal ... Clove and nutmeg spicy phenols, some wintergreen or birch beer herbal character, treacle, light chocolate, hints of citric fruitiness, and an earthy spice that reminds one of ginseng root. Body not terribly thick and the brew is quite bubbly, which provides an interesting contrast to the dark and rich flavors. Finish includes some hop resin, booze, and further spicy, earthy notes. Not roasted or toasty. This was my very first Trappist brew, sampled years ago in graduate school, and I am happy that it still hit that sweet spot for a guy whose taste buds have been plastered by double IPAs and stronger Belgian ales. Younger examples may include more banana flavor from yeast esters ... This one (minimum two years old) was less fruity.","CalgaryFMC","Dec 22, 2013"

4.11,-1,4.25,4.5,4,3.75,4,"Pours dark brown with two fingers of off-white head that dissipates quickly. Right after pouring you can hear the carbonation and feel it on your nose, just like a soda. The nose has an over-ripened plum, cherry, and raisin characteristic to it with the bready malt and candied sugar smells that are common in Trappiste ales. It tastes surprisingly low-key with some bread malt up front, an earthy quality throughout, and a sweet finish with no big fruit notes like the nose has. It feels pretty light-bodied and watery even with the high carbonation. Still a very good dubbel.","itsscience","Nov 17, 2013"

This one was poured from an 11.2 oz bottle into a Chimay chalice (seemed appropriate). Wonderful aroma and head. Amazingly smooth beer that is easily put down. My honey-bunny says it makes her nipples hard and that's good enough for me. Cheers!","SoupKitchenBeerSnob","Nov 10, 2013"

This stuff pours a mostly clear ruby-sienna topped by a half-finger or so of sandstone foam. The nose comprises raisins, figs, rich caramel, Belgian candi sugar, and a smattering of clove. The taste brings in more of the same, along with a definite vein of dark fruits, a swirl or two of cinnamon, and a sprinkle of ginger. The body is a stolid medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a mostly fluid feel. Overall, a damn solid dubbel, a clear classic of the style. Not much else to say than that.","TMoney2591","Oct 06, 2013"

Steady flow of carbonation throughout. Aromas of bready backbone with a rich date and fig sweetness, tart apple highlights, and some spicy notes. Very balanced aromas. Flavors are smooth and roasty, with an apple and date sweet backbone, some cinnamon and all spice, and a slight warmth from the ABV. Extremely well balanced. The aftertaste has more of a fruit bread character to it, with sweetness and richness balanced together. Robust, full body kept light by the carbonation. Smooth, slightly warming finish that beckons you back again and again. Delicious.","GarthDanielson","May 11, 2013"

Can't wait to try yellow and blue. If you're new to trappist beer, this would probably be the best starting point. Monks know how to brew great beer, and while I would still prefer a Rochefort 10, this is more sessionable and can easily hold it's own in the complexity and flavor department. Any avid beer drinker should give this a try.","Roman5150","Mar 31, 2013"

Ruddy and light brown but with more of a red tint than the other trappist dubbels. Aromas of estery Belgian yeast-fruity apricot. Typical dubbel malt aroma-sweet and heavy on the malt bill. Taste is all dubbel. Malty, quite yeasty and fruity with a dry finish. Light on the sweet dried fruit that should be present but it is definitely detectable. Mouthfeel is a bit more carbonated than most dubbels and lighter in malt backbone. Perhaps a touch more bitter aftertaste and slightly less sweet than Westmalle's version. Super easy to drink with lots of character. A great beer.","deebo","Mar 10, 2013"

For me this was the best of the three Chimays. Appearance is a nice dark burgundy color, head was a little less powerful than I thought it would be. Smell is of spices mainly, which isn't a smell I particularly like in beer. Taste is the most enjoyable of the Chimay beers, not overly spiced or too strong, and smoother than the rest.

I will gladly pay the price back in the U.S. for this brew. Again to reiterate, if you can afford the airfare Estonia is probably the place to go in Northern Europe for awesome beer at Bud Lt. price!","JoshatTownHall","Jan 26, 2013"

Great dried fruit and malt aroma. Taste is amazing...typical trappist notes; dried fruit, caramel, malts, smoooth as hell. A superb brew, lots of complexity.

As is often the case with a true Belgian, the yeast is really the star here, and it nicely showcased against a mild maltiness and a warming alcohol to good effect. This brew is a bit rustic and not as well integrated as some, but the flavors layer nicely on one another and produce, in the end, a pretty solid beer.","spoony","Jan 12, 2013"

It's similar somehow to St. Bernadus flavor types of the 8 and 12 etc, but without the sweet en depth. Making it refreshing. But there's something missing to give it that edge and uniqueness.

Smells of caramel and chocolate up front with a fair amount of fruity and sweet maltiness. Light pepper and yeasty esters provide balance as the hop aroma is just about non existent. The flavor is sweet with lots of caramel and dark sugars with a fair amount of dark dried fruits. Prunes and raisins mixed with a bit of pepper and other assorted yeastiness. Medium body with a spirited level of carbonation and a sweet bubbly mouthfeel. I love the flavor, and the aroma isn't half bad either. For my personal taste the carbonation level is a bit high and makes the mouthfeel a bit too bubbly. Minor annoyance to my palette in an otherwise fantastic beer.","johnnnniee","Nov 18, 2012"

I kept waiting for a more powerful flavor to come out as the beer warmed but it never happened. Even if the beer wasn't as bold as I hoped, if it was easy drinking, I could find a place for something like this but it just didn't go down that smooth either. I know this beer isn't overly expensive but it costs more than what I would be willing to pay for it so I most likely won't be drinking it again anytime soon.","mjpolzin","Nov 10, 2012"

3.74,-9.9,4.5,3,4,3.5,4,"The beer pours a yellowed brown like properly aged hay, and sits a nice deep amber brown, with a deeper milk chocolate brown at its center. The beer pours with a great brown sugar-white head that’s bouncing with bubbles and dissipates swiftly, leaving a little thin lacing that runs down the sides of the glass. It smells like day old cooked bread, not especially pungent, but not a terrible smell, rich in biscuitiness and yeasty character. There is even a suggestion of subtle spices in the corners of the smell, along with a slight sweet kick that suggests the candy sugars in the beer. It tastes like a loaf of liquefied brown bread, and soft with candy sugars. There is also a slight hint of brown sugar and an after linger that reminds me of stale honeydew melons. Mouthfeel is very thick and smooth, with an odd harshness on the top of the tongue which sits oddly with the rest of the beers smoothness. The carbonation bubbles fiercely in the initial rush, but quickly peters out on the tongue, providing most but not all of that initial roughness. Overall this a nice sugary bread beer, easily palatable with a little too fierce of a carbonation but some nice after flavors in the mouth.","Maxwell","Jul 01, 2012"

There was a malty and slightly honey sent that was pleasant, not awesome. The beer had a little sweet, malty, spicy, citrus flavor and had a mild hop feel. This is a good beer. At $7/six pack it would have really been remarkable. Unfortunately, it cost nearly $7/bottle leading to expectation not realized.","RedBear84","Jun 23, 2012"

4.33,4.3,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Poured into a chalice. Pours reddish brown with a finger length white head. The head dissipates, but does not disappear completely. The aroma is of sweet dark roasted malt, yeast, and dark fruits. The flavor is bready and sweet. The malt, yeast, brown sugar, and some dark fruit come through in the taste. It's not overly sweet and some faint hop bitterness comes in on the back end to help balance it. The body is medium and the carbonation provides crispness to the beer. It has a dry finish. This is an excellent dubbel and one I'd recommend.","acevenom","Apr 04, 2012"

Spicy malt and light fruit aroma. Taste is low-key, sweet malt, light fruit, a touch of carmel. Finishes with malt, fruit and a bit dry. A pleasant, but somewhat understated dubbel. I'd probably go for the blue over this. Still, nicely made and presented.","LiquidAmber","Mar 28, 2012"

There are very pleasant notes of apricot jam, some red apple, a bit of breadiness, and some late mild bitterness. The whole package is fairly straightforward, but has an appealing freshness to it. The typical Belgian yeast notes are present, but more subdued than you would expect. Very light notes of banana and clove, and in exchange you get the brighter fruit notes. Pours a chestnut color, with fairly good clarity unless you swirl the yeast into the glass. At 7% abv, this is a nice alternative to the higher abv blue as well. Nice, as always.","Georgiabeer","Feb 04, 2012"

Fairly strong spice notes as well. The ale is spicy and bitter from start to finish which helps to mask the medicinal flavor. Phenols are readily apparent, and I lose the complex flavor amongst the fairly heavy spice and bitterness. The sweet aroma helps to balance the bitter after taste. The medium carbonation feels dry on the palate. The beer is good from start to finish, but for me it doesn’t live up to the hype. It’s slightly above average. For me the Chimay Grande Reserve is much smoother and more enjoyable.","BryanRex","Jan 10, 2012"

Dark tan / caramel in color, murky, and has a head that fades quickly, but leaves a light blanket of foam. Smells malty with a hint of raisin and plum, with the slightest trace of hops. As far as flavor goes, its yeasty and malty with distinct spice notes and dark fruits. Bitterness lingers on the tongue as it goes down. Has a medium body and heavy carbonation that washes over the taste buds like a thousand little kisses every time I take a swig. A strong Dubbel.","thewalkindude","Sep 16, 2011"

4.15,0,4,4,4,4.5,4.5,"Burnt red with slight murkiness despite a careful pour. An inch of creamy, ecru head leaves a speck or two of lace before settling down to a thin cap. A nice blend of fruits including plum, grape, and cherry jump out first before being evened out by a bready, musty yeastiness and a sharp phenolic note. Some brown sugar emerges as it warms, as does a biting bitterness at the back of the palate. It perfectly exemplifies the extremely dry, yet creamy mouth presence that almost all of the Trappists have perfected. An excellent and complex ale that would stand up well to roasted root vegetables, braised lamb, and a chocolate-laden dessert.","bump8628","Sep 07, 2011"

4.2,1.2,4,4,4.5,4,4,"This pours a hazy, yeast dreg filled dark tea color with a large foamy tan head which seems to quickly dissipate down to a very thin layer. The smell is very sweet and malty, I also get some grapes. The feel is high carbonation, very tingly, the body is medium to light. The taste is not quite as sweet as the smell makes it seem, I get some peppery spices, some of the sweet malts, a hint of grape and figs, but a very pleasant long dry finish (excellent counterbalance to the sweetness).

4.16,0.2,5,4,4,5,4,"My gentle pour from an 11.2 ounce bottle created a dense finger of tawny head with excellent retention. I could barely bring myself to look at it - I was and remain so unworthy that I was cowed by its presence. This is what it means to me to respect beer. The color was a deep copper with NE-quality clarity. Nose was rich and malty and I got a cereal-like quality along with the underlying must. Mouthfeel was really full and soft and it caressed my tongue like it was welcoming me back after a long underway period. The taste was more caramel and toffee than anything else and even though I generally disdain sweetness in beers, I was game for anything. Finish remained very sweet with an underlying mustiness that I welcomed after the malt onslaught. It has been a long time since I last had Chimay Red and I am glad for the more reasonable individual serving although I might buy a big bottle for aging. Forget what St. Pauli Girl would have you believe - THIS is the beer that you will not forget your first!","woodychandler","Aug 15, 2011"

The smell of the beer is a mostly earthy and a little spicy. The taste spicy upfront and suttles into a dry earthy sweetness in the end. The mouthfeel was about the same at the Grand Reserve.

4.12,-0.7,4,4.5,4,4,4,"Poured into a tulip glass. Beautiful looking beer. Mahogany in color. The head thick, rocky, and lasting. Seems to stay around forever. The head went down first around the edges and left a mountain of foam. Not much lacing though in the end. Smells amazing as well. Picking up lots of fruit and spiciness. White grapes, raisins, slightly sour berries in the background. I also get a pleasant clove spice with faint maple syrup and and soft Belgium yeast. Taste is well balanced. Floral hops along with dark fruits and caramel. The clove spice gives the finish a little kick. Everything melds together really well. The mouth feel is not to heavy not too light.

Taste has dried fruits and caramel and a slight bitterness in the finish. There's a slight acidity contributing to a medium finish.

Warming brings out a yeast note that is quite intresting and adds a light fruit touch to it, but very sweet still. Flavor again is very intresting and not what I was expecting. Rich notes of caramel and almost candied like sugar abound here. Light touches of hops play on the tongue now as well, very intresting. Comes across almost like an amber ale to me, has that bready maltiness and caramel flavor I associate with it.

Taste starts out with a dry fruity cherry sweetness, followed by some moderate carbonation, which leads into a slight bitterness and a touch of natural yeasty flavor in the aftertaste. It has a very wine-like feel to it, with an extremely flavorful dry and fruity finish. A very refreshing brew with a bit of alcohol warmth after each sip.

The flavor is so delicious, it reminds me why I love this style of beer so much. I really don't have much more to say about this beer then try it yourself, you will not be let down.

4.38,5.5,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Poured from a .33 liter bottle into a chalice. It provided about two inches of fluffy sea foam type head that eventually went down to about 1/2 finger of head. Some mild lacing occurred. A nice red tint. Smells like a loaf of warm bread, some mild spiciness and some fruit characteristics. Nice complex flavor. Can taste the yeasts, some roasted malts, and mild hops with fruit overtones. Can't put my finger on the exact fruit but goes nocely with the bread. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, not syrupy like some dubbel, and not overly alcohol feeling. Drinkability is fine and dandy, could enjoy a few at a sitting, and since they are readily available at a fairly decent price, don't mind if I do.","jhtipton","Oct 11, 2010"

Anyways the appearance of this beer is top notch... a deep hazy brown along with a good amount of head. The smell is a delightful combo of sweet and spicy. Taste-wise it has a bit of an initial bite to it followed by a mild blend of sweet/fruity/spicy. Normally I like a bit more maltiness in a Belgian, though this is only 7% ABV, a bit lower than my average Belgian. Mouthfeel is good... a bit watery at first but ends nicely. It is quite easy to drink, though a bit more maltiness would make it a little smoother.

The head slowly recedes but remains as a thin layer on top of the beer for quite some time and leaves no lace. The aroma is full of spice from the yeast as well as the aroma of dried cherries, raisins, bready malt, some woodiness and brown sugar. The flavor is mostly malty with a nice fruitiness and a sort of cherry/prune thing going on. Brown sugar is also evident, as is some dark, bready malt, earthy hop notes, some leather and a clove/cinnamon spice from the yeast. This beer is wonderfully balanced, so well balanced in fact that a quick sip would lead one to think this is one dimensional, but the more I slowly enjoy this goblet, the more nuances seem to surface. The mouthfeel is medium, with carbonation that I wish was a little bit more subdued, but it's not a deal breaker. Very drinkable and enjoyable.

The taste has a bit of caramel malt, banana, dried fruit, and spice. The mouthfeel is especially fantastic on this one. It has a nice crisp carbonation that cuts straight through the richness of this beer. This is highly drinkable and refreshing for a darker beer, the carbonation does it. I've thought of red as getting the least respect of Chimay's outstanding line up which is truly saying something about the quality of this brewer.","littlekidlover","Apr 07, 2010"

The taste is of raisins, prunes, a light spice in the background (maybe like black pepper). The aftertaste is of yeasty bread. The mouthfeel is medium at first, but finishes a little thin.

As with Chimay White the individual characteristics are somehow indecisive and I can't easily pinpoint at any although they are clearly delimited. However, the beer is very well balanced and refined with individual flavors/aromas in tune with each other. Medium bodied, medium carbonated.

The taste pretty much resembles the smell; a sense of spice mixed with a fruity and slightly sweet flavor. The flavors stand out more after sitting, so don't drink this right out of the fridge.

Poured from the bottle into the Chimay chalice, beer is a very hazy, copper/light brown color with a standing, active head. There are small chunks of particulate that have settled to the bottom of the chalice. The biggest thing that hits my nose right away is the spicy phenols which reminds me of cloves. There is also a light fruitiness about it as well as very subtle hints of darker, roasted malts. The flavor also has the spicy phenols, but also a light fruity sweetness that reminds me of pears, apricots and white grapes. There is just a touch of bitterness to balance and a slightly solventy warming alcohol effect. A very complex beer. The mouthfeel is medium bodied, velvety with a slightly aggressive carbonation, formed by the bottle fermentation no doubt. Overall a drinkable beer but definitely one you want to sip and enjoy.","gmfessen","Jul 13, 2009"

Incredibly smooth flavor....the clove and spice hits right up front followed by the bready yeast and raisin/fig and fruity flavors. The alcohol is barely noticable with a slight appearance. Again, finishes very, very smooth in the aftertaste. A nice spicy, full-bodied mouthfeel from the high carbonation.

Since I really like Belgians, I was looking forward a great deal to drinking them. I poured the Premiere in a smallish wine glass and immediately liked the appearance. Reddish brown with a haze and had a nice aroma of bread and malt - a good sign to me. Then I tasted it - what a disappointment. First of all, it had a very thin mouthfeel to it, nothing at all like other Dubbel's I've recently had. Maybe that was a result of the carbonation, which seemed a bit over done. The actual taste? Well, there just wasn't much to it. At first I thought it was simply too cold, so I let it sit a bit with my had cupped around the bowl and periodically tasted it. It just never seemed to really change. The 33cl bottle filled my small glass about 1 and 3/4 times, so by the end of the second (partial) glass it could no longer be said to be "cold" - really just right for a Belgian Dubbel, IMO - but still not much in the way of flavor. Perhaps I got a bad bottle, or simply too old. With all the rave reviews of this beer, I was expecting much more. I am hoping the Blue will be better.","BluesDaddy","Jun 24, 2009"

On previous tastes I didn't use the proper glassware and I forgot to let the yeast settle. This time I corrected both those errors and gained a new appreciation for the incredibly fresh smell of this beer. The flavour doesn't possess the metallic notes it had when, on a prior taste, I drank it almost immediately after pouring.

Super-cloudy red-brown in color, like mud or plumbing backup, can't get any more opaque without being black. The nose unfolds in a slow, if not sneaky, manner, surprising spine and hoppiness to frame the dark chocolate, caramel, coriander, ginger spice and candied plum and cherry fruit scents, banana bread, chooses balance over nostril penetration. Medium-bodied, the flesh is sculpted and hard, no jiggle. A good deal of the sense of momentum comes from the ever-present carbonation. The ginger and clove spice almost turns to cumin, pairs up with grass and grain notes. Without excess sweetness, there's raisin, fig, date notes and fresher cherry fruit. Bready like fruit-bread or cake not a loaf of bread, leesy as well. Even with nothing out of place, does sort of spin off at the end. Good drinkability.","farrago","Jan 18, 2009"

Looked very inviting, looked very good! Smell was great, no off smells what so ever, the hops came through, and you could smell some of the sweetness, I cant put my finger on it exactly, but it defiantly smelt great! Hands down, this was one tasty beer! It goes down real smooth, finishes with mild hop bitterness, and then you feel a warming sensation from the alcohol. Very interesting and very well done. I enjoyed this one immensely! The only downfall i saw with this beer was, the mouthfeel. It felt very thin, and tad over carbonated, with the same sensation as pop would leave in your mouth. Not too bad, but at the same time i was very disappointed. I could honestly drink more than a few bombers of this beer, it is of high quality, and well balanced, it went down easy, and the higher ABV was a nice added bonus.

I like, I like, sweetness of the nose is downplayed in the actual taste, here the malt bitterness begins to shine through. Taste at first of well cooked toast, slightly herbal, mild pepper and tart cherry with a noticable alcoholic warmth that kicks the tongue and back of the throat ever so slightly.

A bit of apple sweetness along with some faint spicyness and a bit of oak come through in the taste area. Mouthfeel is smooth, somewhat light on the palate, moist finish. A very good brew, worthy of the praise others have given it. I liked the Blue better, but this one is still very very good.","BigJTrucker","Jul 17, 2008"

But also plenty of sents that I cannot even describe and havn't experianced before. Tastes of Alcohol and plumbs up front with a malty dry earthyness throughout and some sort of maby root after taste that s wonderfull and addicting. I can pick out some hop bitterness inbetween multiple other flavors that I really will have to check out the vocab section to better describe in the future.

Aromas really aren't intensely fruity, just a lot of dark candi sugar, a little bit of citrus, even less of clove, and a touch of band-aid. A medium bodied brew with very high carbonation delivers flavors of more candy, caramel, toasted bread, and a moderate amount of esters. Finish is quite dry and no noticeable hop flavor. Overall, it's a solid example of the style, no doubt.

There was almost no carbonation and had a nice body to it, being slightly syrupy. Overall this was a very tasty beer, flavorful but still easy to drink.

3.98,-4.1,4,3.5,4,4,4.5,"Now, is it drinkable in the sense of, 'could i drink this beer all night?' Again the answer is technically yes, however with the substantial, but not earth-shattering alcohol, sessioning this beer will produce some less-than-pleasant-next-mornings. But the real question with this beer is do you spend an entire night with a beer that is undeniably well made and awesome, but is at the same time, very subtle, refined, classic; in short, the kind of beer that inspired and forced brewers to take liberties with and re-define the style: why try and brew something like this beer when you won't be able to make a better example of the style. It's a beer you can enjoy, but only if you are committed to enjoying the beer; it's a beer that's on par with the master works of literature; it's not an everyday beer, and when you do drink it, you need to drink it with it a mind focused on the beer. With all that said, it's quite possible I completely dropped the ball on this one; the glass I drank it out of (a chimay chalice) has been sitting around for a week or so; it's clean, I just haven't used it in awhile. I had music on at a level where I noticed I had music on, and there was more light than normal. So yeah, maybe the elements had some factor. Still, elements and outside variables be damned, you won't find a better example of what it means to be a beer, despite what my low score on this beer suggests.","bigeyedfish","Jan 01, 2008"

I am fond of it, but get tired of it quickly.

Once again, very yeasty up front, slight dark fruit flavor, and a noticeable balance between the hops and malts. Complex and good. Nice smooth medium mouthfeel. Great flavor, and not so high abv. make for a highly drinkable and enjoyable Belgian dubbel. Overall, having never drank a Chimay product, I was impressed.

4.42,6.5,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Pours a clear brownish copper with a tightly packed tannish white head. Lacing left all over and lasts through the finish. Looks very inviting and appealing. Aroma is of mainly of toasted malts, some caramel and a pleasant fruitiness as it gets warmer. Taste is excellent. Very Belgian-like, with hints of banana and clove, but not too overpowering. Some fruity/cirusy hop flavors start coming through with warming. Very good on the palate. Oily but rather thin on the tongue. Perhaps due to a modest amount of carbonation. Goes down very smoothly.

The mouthfeel is somewhat better with a smooth, full bodied texture and lively carbonation continuing. Hoping the taste would improve with air and warming, the aftertaste became even more overpowering. I wondered just how much fermentation was still going on with this one!

Mild phenolic aroma with a hint of clove followed by caramel malt notes. Smooth, almost creamy mouthfeel with a medium body. Very low hop bitterness. Sweetness dominates at first and is then followed by a tad of caramel malt and complex, peppery Belgian yeasty flavors. This is much better in the 11.2 oz bottle.

Some toasty malts, some dates, some booze. Nothing bad about it, just lackluster. Flavor is a big improvement over the smell. Starts off with toasted and roasted malt, which leads into a fruit and brown sugar middle with just a whisper of yeasty phenolics. Finish comes back with some more of the higher kilned malts and a kiss of the hops. The weight of the beer in the mouth is about moderate, but the carbonation is harsh.

The beer seemed under carbonated, especially for a Belgian Trappist, and was evident in the thin foamstand and the more dull texture. The aromas are candy sweet, malty, fruity tart, and berry like. Flavors bring the same characteristics as the aromas, and add dark, dehydrated fruits, syrup sweetness, bread, yeast, and cherries. The body was firm and moderate despite the light caronation.

The flavor is good, but pretty understated, I think--I'd even call it a bit weak up front. I expected it to be stronger than the Chimay white, so I had the white first today; but if anything I think the white was stronger and richer in flavor than the red.

Hints of fruit: apples, bananas, and something tangier, like cherries. Rich floral fragrance. Flavors are a little darker than I expected. Opens up nicely in middle with dark toasted bread and apples. Ends on a flat, slightly metallic note. But it picks up with a good aftertaste like the skin of a red apple. Mouthfeel is very light. Tiny bubbles that fizz on the tongue like a cola. Overall, a nice example of a Belgian Dubbel. Not the best I've ever had, but there's still a good complexity of flavors, aromas, and textures.

And I think if you looked up "dubbel" in the dictionary, you'd see the red label for the definition. It's a warm quaff, with the ABV far from extreme, but it has its way with the senses if left unchecked. And it's nicely drinkable and enjoyable. It's been around so long, and certainly longer than most Belgians, that it's easy to look past, but this is one more good reason to get back to the heritage from time to time.","Foxman","Jan 31, 2007"

The taste is where is this beer starts to really shine: Initially the barley comes w/ a slight hop bitterness. Very fruity (can't quite put my finger on it...apples and raisins?) with a slight trace of ethanol. The alcohol hides behind the hops. The aftertaste is dominated by the hops (but not too strong!), also with a potassium like taste (the kind of feel you get from tasting bananas and dates).

I had this chilled, and intially, the carbonation struck me as too high, and the mouthfeel was off. As the beer warms, the carbonation goes down, the sweetness intensifies and the drinkablity increases. Alcohol is not appearant.

There is also a bit of a dank basement sourness that is very, very faintly present that reminds me of a Saison. It's very deeply buried, but there nevertheless.

The smell is awesome with raisins, sugar, molasses, caramel, and lots of other aroma's I'd never even dreamed of smelling in beer. The taste is the aforementioned last sentence except the yeast kinda makes it metallic tasting in a way. Alcohol is well hidden, although sort of prevalent at times. Kind of like a smooth, more refined, Arrogant Bastard. The mouthfeel isn't 5.0, but it's damn smooth. A running trait of this beer. The drinkability is awesome. You'll probably be toasted after one bomber bottle (in my case, 3 goblets full), but damn is it good. Wish it lasted longer and I had a tap of this in my house! Smooth and sweet. Perfect!

A nice frothy head, typical of most belgians, formed upon the pour. I was suprised to see the head fall almost immediately. This is very possibly due to the fact that I havent used this glass in awhile and my mom was the last to wash it. Color is reddish copper and alittle hazy, very sexy. Aroma is strong and has the honey-fruit aroma that is present in many trappist ales. Taste is initiated with a blast of honey-fruitiness, I want to say plum, but I don't really eat them so I'm not sure. The flavor leaves with a sweet bitterness that leaves you wanting more. The mouthfeel is light bodies with a nice carbonation. You can feel the bubbles forming on your tongue with every sip. Drinkability is good for a Trappist ale. If I had the money this would be a good sessions beer. All in all I think this is a very fine brew. Great for a special occasion when you can't spring for Rochefort.

My second one (Blue) hit the spot because I brought it to share on a cruise at my brother's bachelor party (plus it tasted reallll good). I picked this one (Red) because it was $3.50 and the place had Cimay glasses to drink them out of. The coolest part of this was all the bubbles that floated only to the middle of the glass.

Smell is of some yeast, some light grain, and lots of woodsy spice. Clove, banana, vanilla, grape, alcohol and cassis. The taste is all about the clove, from the second it hits your lips until after almost all other flavors have dissipated on the medium-in-duration finish. This looked and smelled like a world-class beer, but the taste didnt wow me and the mouthfeel I thought was a little thin and too carbonated.

Poured a lovely dark orange, close to amber color with a large head that quickly faded to a perfect lacing that lasted right up until the end of the glass. In the nose, I smelled strong alcohol, candy sugar, a bit of fruit here and there. I suspect that more smells would surface if the beer warmed up a little bit. Taste was excellent with figs, syrupy sweetness, juicy fruit, also a slight medicinal taste to it as well. Im usually not crazy about the medicinal sides of many beers but this one wasn't overpowering at all in the end made it a better beer in my humble opinion. Mouthfeel was the highlight for me, the beer was just perfectly balanced and a real thrist quencher. I love the prickly feeling you get when tasting this one. It was also a very drinkable beer....I think even wine lovers would have appreciation for the vast complexities within this beer.

The aroma is a little muted, but theres some notable esters and phenols. Clove and raisins. Theres a little malt and caramel in the smell, both of which show up in the taste. No hop presence at all in the smell, and just a little hop bitterness in the finish. Yeasty. I expected to sense a little alcohol, but its very well hidden.

The head is off-white and soapy, and fills the glass quickly with a hard and audible fizz. The retention is lacking, and only scarce dots of lacing are left behind. Caramel or belgian candi sugar in the nose, some mild fusels, and a belgian phenolic aroma similiar to flintstones vitamins. The taste is rich with malt and well-attentuated. Toasted crystal malt and/or candi sugar, raisins and dates, and organic honey. The aftertaste holds a spicy alcoholic kick; coupled with very mild hop bitterness and a belgian tart, and slight dryness that cleanses the residual sugars. This creates a wonderfully balanced flavor, while preventing any lingering sweetness in the finish, and thus a high drinkability. The alcohol and yeast notes are detectable, but more of a pleasent farewell than solvent or puckering. The carbonation and body are at a medium level, leaving the mouthfeel both textured and crisp.

Poured to a dark amber with a puffy foamy head that formed very quickly, likely due to the secondary fermentation in the bottle. Smell is earthy and clean. The taste is phenomenal, delicate earthy flavors accompanied by a nice light earthy aroma carried by the carbonation ever so delicately throughout the palate. Carbonation is sufficient, and this goes down very very smooth. Very drinkable indeed.

I smelt all sorts of fruits like dark berries, grains, yeast, and alcohol; very appealing. The taste was just a great blend of flavors with the presence of various fruits mixing nicely with hop bitterness that was present but so subtle. The flavors changed as the beer warmed with sweet sugar flavors starting to dominate. The beer seemed to coat my tongue and keep my wanting more, but the high ABV and the richness of the beer prevented me from indulging. Still, a great beer with great flavors.

Taste starts more bitter and roasty than sweet and malty. That's okay. Wheaty malt is there, but the sweetish fruit flavors are very subdued. Bitterness stays strong as alcohol flavors increase.

I would guess that the wise monks use a butt ton (as versus a metric ton) of bittering hops in their boil. Bless those monks. I have been a moderate beer geek for a couple of years now. I am afraid that Chimay Premier has expanded my geekiness to full blown. I am ready to try about 100 other types of beer. Malt, fruit, and bitter balance combine to make this high gravity beer amazingly drinkable though a tad too dainty for my dopplebock tendencies. Go monks! One and a half finger head though difficult to pour the last half glass hard into the girly glass they served it with. The head gives way quickly even though the carbonation is quite evident to the tongue. It is not as heavy on the mouth as I expected from a beer of this strength. As a matter of fact it is really difficult for me to grasp that this is an ale and not some type of lager because of how light it is.

Served in "appropriate" Chimay glass (whether those wide chalices really ARE the most appropriate for savouring complex beers, is a discussion of its own). Unfortunately served far too cold - youd think White Horse waiters knew better. For good measure, the waiter poured the beer along the side of the glass, which prevented the beer from "opening up", the head disappeared quickly and the beer kept too much carbonation. The beer has a brown colour, aroma of leather, balsamico vinegar and barnyard. Flavour is quite dry, well hopped, elements of leather and tobacco. Hints of cardamom and ginger. Aroma and flavour improves somewhat as the beer slowly warms up, but altogether this remains my least favourite of the Chimays - give me a Bleu, please!

Perhaps the bottle of blue I had was skunked, because there was a HUGE different in yeasty taste as I took a step down the ladder to the red. The yeast in the red was present in the taste, but it was much better masked by the typical (if it could be called that) blend of spices, fruits, candy flavored malts. The alcohol content is significantly lower, thus making this much more drinkable, though it still weighs in at a rather hefty 7%. Even though this beer made up for my disappointment with the blue, I haven't been completely convinced that Chimay is worth all the hype. Nonetheless, I will definately revisit this one in the future when money permits (and I don't necessarily need to treat myself to something such as an ABT12 or Rochefort 8). I have already lined up another bottle of blue from an alternate source though, which will hopefully produce better results for me.","neonbrown82","Jan 26, 2005"

Still, it could not contain that head. Huge. Had to stop, let it settle, then pour again ever so carefully. When the final drop falls out of the bottle, I'm left with a not quite brown, somewhat orange nectar. With a head three fingers thick and creamy. When held very close to a light, the beer is a hazy orange, and I can see little bits of yeast floating around. Oh, I poured the yeast in. Smell is raw malts, bread, honey, alcohol and some floral hops. Very faint floral hops. Taste immediately starts out sweet. Honey and bread. The sweetness grows, as the honey becomes more pronounced and the bread changes to almost a pudding flavour. Bread pudding? I've had bread pudding once, a long time ago. This flavour reminds me faintly of it. Aftertaste is sweet, with a mild bitter zing. Throughout this flavourful experience, the hops are their in the background, adding just a mild balance for a terrific beer. Mouthfeel is excellent. Cannot be improved. It's creamy, thick, coats the tongue, mouth and throat, and yes has a light carbonation that teases the senses. Highly drinkable. I can sip this for hours.

The flavoer was superb - fully malty, robust, with caramel and toffee notes as well as some toasted bread. The bitterness was not dominant and was easy to miss, meaning it blended well with the malty profile of the beer. Also the alcohol didn't dominate either, and was almost not noticable.

Massively strong fresh bread/yeast notes dominate. Nuts, pine wood--it goes on and on. Ageing has also created a smoother mouthfeel, with more phenolic warmth.

Slightly translucent, with a 1-finger high white head with small bubbles. Aroma is very gentle, nice, not strong and overpowering. Slightly sweet with sweet fruit-candy aroma (raisins/dates) and maybe a little chocolate. Flavor is slightly sweet like the aroma, but has a firm bite of hops. As the drink warms in the mouth, an unpleasant medicine-like sharpness comes aroound that ruins the nice flavors that come before.

The first taste is that of sweetness like caramel and then it goes into the fruity taste. The malt a slight alcohol taste is also pleasant. The taste is very crisp and pleasing to the mouth.

Possibly the least sweet Belgian trappist or abbey I've had. Head disappeared quickly, one of the least impressive appearances i've seen in a Belgian or Belgian-styled beer. Almost no lacing.

Sweet raw honey-like malt aroma and flavour, some herbal medicinal flavour clash with a fresh tasting juicy hops. Ripe tropical fruit is vague but present. A hell of a lot sweet than what I am used in the bottle, I actually prefer the bottle but would certainly order this again.","Jason","Mar 20, 2003"
3.97,-4.3,3.5,4,4,4,4,"Aroma had an original quick shot of raisin like fruitiness, then moved to a strong phenol and cloves nose. Big and full head with a cloudy orange amber color with obvious sediment. Minimal lacing. Ale smoothness, alcohol taste notable. Cloves and phenol again with fruity background. Great long lasting finish of both flavor and dryness. Lower carbonation, which helps the smoothness. Mostly an enjoyable adventure of flavors, but a bit limited. Others have described it well and better than I. My bottle may have been a little old, because it lacked the complexity as I would have liked. Enjoyable nonetheless.","garymuchow","Mar 20, 2003"
4.8,15.7,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,5,"This is quite a wonderful brew. Pours a cloudy orange/brown color. Has a rich, creamy head, which leaves a lace that clings to the glass for the entire duration. Wonderful malt aromas emerged with a spicy hint of cloves and sweet citrus. The carbonation seemed to dance on my tongue, like that of fine champagne. This brew has an exceptionally well-balanced taste of plums, raisins, and touch of pepper-like spiciness. This is a wonderfully complex, yet balanced beer. Its by far my favorite of the three Chimays.","Scooter77","Mar 17, 2003"

4.2,1.2,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,4,"Pours a nice red, almost garnet in color. A thick off white head that wouldnt quit slowly gave way to a thick never-ending lace that was on there until the finish. Mostly malt aroma with hints of plums or raisins mixed with yeast. Nice, very nice. A malt sweetness moves over your tongue with the hints of plum, raisins and yeast. Very smooth and creamy feeling in your mouth. I really enjoyed this beer so dont let the rating fool you. This is my first beer of this style and I like to leave room for adjustments where needed.

You can smell the carbonation in the aroma! Cherry's abound in the first sip, sweet yet somewhat sour. High carbonation, yet creamy in the mouthfeel. Short, dry finish, yet again with a lingering, somewhat tangy edge. Unbelievable. Now, of course the August of 2000 was the freshest, but my personal favorite; the March of 1998. It showed signs of aging, less carbonation, hardly any lasting lace, but the short, tangy, slight sour finish worked for me. Next mission, cellar some blue.","HopheadEd","Jan 12, 2003"

Still all in all a good beer.","bewareOFpenguin","Jan 05, 2003"
4.3,3.6,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,"Nose is plum liqueur soaring over rich crystal maltiness and dark toffee notes. Simply mouth-watering.

A gem.","Realale","Jan 03, 2003"

4.36,5.1,5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Light murky brown in color with a beautiful fluffy white head. The taste is creamy and smooth. Hints of spices come through and is a bit peppery. Very effervesant in the mouth. The aftertaste is very warming and smooth. I have been waiting to try the Chimay line for along time and they did not disappoint. Can't wait to sample the white and blue.","CharlesRiver","Dec 13, 2002"
3.77,-9.2,4,4.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Pours with a nice fluffy head and rich brown/cherry colour. Smell is intensely fruity with cherry, plum, and mild banana. Taste is strong malt, cherries and plum again but without the banana. A touch of caramel as well. Mouthfeel fizzy and sharp. Not as smooth as the rest of the Chimay family. An excellent brew and strong thirst quencher but definantly the worst of the three. Almost like a toned down weizenbock.","Ardon","Dec 09, 2002"
4.11,-1,5,4,4,4.5,4,"Amber color with lots of bubbles. Thick white fluffy head, slightly sweet nose with a smack of spice (black pepper). Very smooth mouth with a lively (sparkle) finish. Very rounded malt taste with hop bitterness and spice to the finish (dry pepper). Tart plum notes also balence the malt sweetness. A great looking brew. Not as complex as I remembered but very well rounded.","frank4sail","Dec 06, 2002"
4.26,2.7,3.5,5,4,3.5,4.5,"Taste begins medicinal and hard candy, with banana, berries, malt and yeast. Nicely rich, soft, with a light tingling carbonation and mouthfeel.

4.32,4.1,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"A deep translucent garnet to brown color on the pour, the head preposterous in size, creamy in texture, light tan in color, with oodles of lace to cling lovingly to the Chimay Chalice. The nose is dominated by the malt, but also a hint of yeast and hops, sweet, and quite sniffable. Start is malt sweet, the top middling in mouth feel, the finish is potently acidic, mercifully hopped, droughty malt aftertaste. My second most favorite Chimay, and as I have stated, if you havent tried a Chimay, youve not lived Baby.","Gusler","Nov 22, 2002"
4.5,8.4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"An amber red-colored brew fills the glass and a very large off-white head forms on top. Stays very well with the help of the Chimay chalice's etched bottom, which creates bubbles that rise to the top, keeping the head perfect. Leaves a few dots of lace as it levels out. Beautiful spicy aroma. Dried plum and raisin dominate, along with a little yeast in the background. Maybe a bit of banana as well. Definitely a "dubbel aroma". There's a characteristic in there that I can't quite pinpoint, it's almost like a soft aged cheese aroma. Maybe a little bready. A slight Belgian pepper tingle greets the tongue with the first taste. Clove and a bit of banana follow. Rich yet delicate malt sweetness supports the fruity and spicy products of the yeast. As the liquid travels around your palate, it feels almost thick, like whipped cream. So smooth and creamy! This is just about the smoothest, creamiest beer I've ever tasted... or felt, if you will. A medium to light body, but the complexities and malt make this a pleasure to savor in the way that a more full-bodied beer would be. I can definitely see this one holding the monks over during a fasting. A delight to the senses. Another must-try from Chimay!","hyuga","Nov 18, 2002"
4.08,-1.7,4.5,4,4,4.5,4,"Dark Brown color, which is actually very attractive if you pay attention to it. Topped with a creamy thick white head. It has a light smell of apricot. Yet another TOP Beer by Belgium (Dubbel Style)","ipogios","Nov 17, 2002"
4.53,9.2,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Pours a nice deep reddish copper color with a thick and creamy white head.  Aroma is slightly sweet and fruity with hints of apricot and figs.  I also read another reviewer describe this aroma as bread pudding like, which I have to say is right on.  This is a medium-bodied brew with a somewhat complex taste that is a bit fruity and malty with a dash of pepper.  The fine carbonation creates a very nice mouth feel that goes down extremely smoothly.  I could drink several of these.  A very fine beer.","Morris729","Nov 10, 2002"

4.12,-0.7,4,4.5,4,4,4,"Honey-colored with a frothy, rocky cream-colored head--large bubbles. It's unfiltered, and there is some visible particulate matter suspended in the beer, but not so much as to be bothersome. Very natural-looking.  Aroma is of dark fruity maltiness (very ripe apples or apricots?)--smells very sweet. Vigorous carbonation lends a very crisp bite at first. Notes of clove on the tongue. The taste is somewhat less complex than the smell, and it's definitely not as sweet as the aroma leads one to expect--the balance is striking, and it benefits from not being real sweet and syrupy. Certainly a world-class Belgian.","doerickson","Nov 02, 2002"
4.13,-0.5,4.5,4,4,4,4.5,"Pours a cloudy, deep amber color with a generous head and tons of lace. Malt and fruit in the nose along with a spicy, rose-like aroma. Medium body with a creamy and smooth mouthfeel. Flavor is rich in malt and fruity, some yeastiness, and bread-like taste. Finishes with light hops that balance it out.  Slightly dry with a light spiciness. Easy to drink, but slowly enjoy this one. A wonderful Belgian ale","Lupe","Oct 20, 2002"
4.47,7.7,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"This is a great beer! It pours with a small but creamy tan head and is a nice dark reddish/brown.  The aroma is very appealing like calling you to TASTE ME.  And the taste is so smooth, not very hoppy but more on the malty side IMO.  Great tingly moutfeel that stays with you. And contrary to somethings I read as to drink it alone, I had it with a fettucine alfredo and it went great with it. MY WIFE EVEN LIKED IT, and she is a liquor type gal. Try this beer...........CHEERS","tigerpaws","Oct 10, 2002"
4.35,4.8,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Small bottle. Age unknown, but prior to the fairly recent packaging change-over; and aging is not really needed with this beer. Cloudy reddish-brown with an orange cast. The light tan head wants to rise out of the glass at first, but eventually subsides to a very creamy 1/8" head that holds throughout the serving and leaves some nice lace. The aroma is lightly fruity (dark fruits - raisin, plum, fig... and maybe some lighter fruits as well), lightly phenolic (even some minor bubblegum), gently citrusy, somewhat woody, somewhat sweet, softly spicy (clove) and subtly leathery. The body is light/medium but with a very soft, smooth, and creamy palate from a very fine, natural carbonation. The flavor is somewhat rich with a fruity, bready malt flavor, some yeastiness, and some light grassy hops that round and balance. It finishes semi-dry with a light spiciness that lingers. Although it may appear one-sided at first, a closer examination will reveal that there's much more going on. That's what makes this beer work so well - its great balance and finesse. The flavors and aromas don't reach out and grab you individually, but rather act as a whole, which gives it complexity as the varied characteristics are slowly revealed at different times throughout the serving. Highly drinkable, and quite enjoyable.","NeroFiddled","Oct 07, 2002"

This blew the Witkap Pater out of the water (does that rhyme?) but I still feel it was lacking in some areas. Copper colored with an insanely thick head. Mellow fruit undertones are about all that stood out to me. I am looking forward to trying the Bleu.","Dogbrick","Sep 11, 2002"
3.78,-8.9,4.5,4,3.5,3.5,4,"Semi-opaque deep ginger brown, nice bottle-conditioned head that races to 3/4 of an inch in the tulip glass.  Bright aroma, a little citrus and cantelope.  Mouthfeel is light and at the same time a woodsy, leafy, cane sugar malty flavor is pretty evident. There's a lot of yeastiness going on here. Good hop bittering, but at the same time, I was looking for a little more complexity and a little more fruit to the overall impression.  Still, obviously a respectable brew.  The Grande Reserve appeals to me more -- its got added depth of flavors.","ADR","Aug 12, 2002"

Effervescence remains in the dark brownish brew, which intrigues with light swirls of foam below the head.  Aromas are smooth, though rather muted until the beer warms a bit.  Taste is exceptionally smooth and well-balanced, neither overwhelmingly sweet nor overwhelmingly bitter.  Deliciously drinkable...a really wonderful beer.","BitteBier","Aug 01, 2002"

3.78,-8.9,4,3.5,4,4,3.5,"Pours a bit browner than ruby. Nice typical belgian head. Nose has that smell that's the same in the La Trappe beers; it's like the taste of suger in the raw if you took away the sweetness. Maybe it's from the sugar they use to start fermentation. Some very faint citric qualities to the smell with some other vague fruitiness. I'm not sure how many people here have done this or have this weed, but chew on the bottom end of a stalk of Y grass (peel away the secondary leaves and chew on the white bottom). It's a flavor that very similar to one of those in this beer. Flavor it with a little bit of red grapes, minus the sweetness, with the faintest hint of alcohol and you've got the flavor nailed. The mouthfeel is actually fuzzy because of the way the carbonation is.","aracauna","Jun 14, 2002"
4.2,1.2,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Okay, opening this was akin to open a champagne bottle. Lovely amber color with nice white/light tan head.

3.85,-7.2,4,4,3.5,3.5,4.5,"Pours a nice shade of burgandy with a bubbly head that retains nicely.  Very sweet candy-like aroma with yeasty tones evident also.  Taste is nice, but nothing really jumps out at me.  Very refiined compared to some of the other Belgians I've had recently (like Scaldis).  Taste consists of a bready yeastiness,  subdued sweet tones of cotton candy,  and slight bitterness.  This is a medium bodied beer.  One of the more easily drinkable Belgians I've had.","Bighuge","May 29, 2002"

The yeast is the highlight and balances the brew perfectly between weighty intensity and frothy lip-smacking refreshment. Drink this beer with food. Namely meat. Rack of lamb would be ideal, but this beer is so good that Boston Chicken would probably do the trick.","Thrasher","May 10, 2002"

Mild phenolic aroma with a hint of clove followed by caramel malt notes.  Smooth, almost creamy mouthfeel with a medium body.  Very low hop bitterness.  Sweetness dominates at first and is then followed by a tad of caramel malt and complex, peppery Belgian yeasty flavors.  This is much better in the 11.2 oz bottle.  This is easily the most balanced Belgian trappist ale I've had.  Lots of flavors, but it won't kick your ass like the other two Chimays.
