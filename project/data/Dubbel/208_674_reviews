"Weak coffee look, creamy head, nice malt smell, smooth well balanced malty taste.  Can taste a banana and light alcohol at the finish."

"I really enjoyed this one. A good looking dark brown ale with malty sweet aroma. Great dark fruits taste along with malts and caramel. There is a burnt essence in both the finish and aroma. There is some alcoholic quality in the taste but it is masked well by the other favors. Full bodied, creamy and quite drinkable. I will definitely get again."

"Prune and dark dried fruit on the nose with some spice. Pours clear brown with 1” light tan foam cap that persists and leaves gothic window lace. Palate has big yeast flavors with prune, over ripe fruit, spicy malt, and dark sugars. Medium to medium full body and medium high carbonation. The carbonation tones down the malt and yeast flavors."
""
"Not very malty in the smell or taste but of a hugh body nevertheless. Bitterness and carbonation are at good level."
"Bought recently at the LCBO in Ontario based on Beer Connoisseur Mags listing this as one of the best of 2014. Poured it into a chalice shaped glass. The beer is brown with a rich foamy head and some lacing going up the glass. You can smell the alcohol and caramel sweetness.This is a complex, delicious beer that is enhanced as the beer warms in the glass.It's velvety smooth."

"Final Grade: 4.6, an outstanding A+. Westmalle Dubbel makes for an excellent introduction to this oft-lauded Trappist brewery. This is the first Westmalle product I've had the opportunity to try, and I'm already pining to try more. Its spicy, complex flavours are both enticing and wholly satisfying, making this definitely one of the better dubbels that I have tried over the years. Keeping in mind that this is probably my least-favourite of the major styles of 'abbey beer', I am still convinced that this is one of the best dubbels in the world - and it would be welcome in my glass to celebrate any occasion."

""
""
""
"Overall: A lovely sipper that would be perfect for Christmas drinking in my opinion. Lots of fruits and spices."
""
""
""
""
"Overall- Really like this dubbel as it has great dark fruit flavors and an interesting spicy hop profile in the finish.  Only complaint is the finish, which can be overbearingly dry. Other than that its a great beer."
""
""
""
"Enjoy"
""
""
""

"A bubbly and buoyant Dubbel, the yeast really manages to cut a unifying line throughout this beer to deliver a highly complex and refreshingly tasty Trappist ale. Not overly weighted in any one flavour group, it is simultaneously rich and playful between the groups of floral, spicy, fruity, and malty notes. Delicious beer and a real treat, one of the top belgians available."
""
"Heavy on the banana bread flavour and dryer than most in this style, this is a beer you reach for when you are out of all other trappist beer. Still, I am happy that the LCBO is carrying it for a limited time here in Toronto."

"Overall -  A wonderful dubbel that's right up there with St. Bernardus Pater 6 as the best I've ever tried. Just pure awesomeness."
""
""
"o: what an incredible beer.  such massive aromas and flavours.  the carbonation could be toned down a notch, but it's not like it's offensive the way it is"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I can't believe I put off trying this beer for years based on a previous disappointment by the same dubbel style. A new 'go-to' for me when I'm craving a belgian. Dark sweet and full of esters and dried fruit. Will buy this one again and again."

""
"lots of flavor (mostly fruity)"

"Pours a hazy dark red-brown, two fingers of cream colored dense foam, fades to a thin ring, spray of lace down the glass. Smell: dark brown sugar, brown bread, dates, mildly spicy and grainy. Taste: caramel, cherry, dates, mildly grassy and earthy, buttered brown bread. Very nice. Bottled 2/14, best by 2/16."
""
""
"A dark beer with smell of spicy notes.  A very smooth beer with notes of spices.  Well done by Westmalle"
"Outstanding as is expected with a Trappist ale.  Lots of carb, refreshing."
""
"Overall: Once again, Westmalle hits the bullseye - generally speaking, I prefer their Trippel but this is a stunningly drinkable dubbel even if it seems to be lacking in the spice department. Stunningly smooth and well worth a punt."

""
"Pours from the bottle a cloudy ruby color and maintains a nice head well into drink, plus the foam lacing on the glass. Has a nice, sweet, fruit aroma. Tastes as good as it smells (if not better). Not quite as spiced as some other dubbels, but very enjoyable all the same."

"Warming, dark, soft and tender. A touch bland?"
""
"As no single one of the numerous great qualities is overbearing or out of balance with the others, it's easy to fathom Westmalle's excellent reputation. The body and alcohol content of it is also quite manageable, so this is a Belgian that can be enjoyed on easy-drinking occasions. Recommended for any lover of great beer, and a great place to start in the world of Trappist or Belgian beer in general."
""
""
""
"O: A great dubbel. Dark, but not roasty, chewy, yet creamy, all-in-all reminding me of a dark, sweet, bread with dried fruits baked in."
"O – A cracking number and much better than the Rochefort offerings this beer is very pleasing with well-rounded balanced flavour so in all conscience I cannot give this less than 4.5. For me it only loses marks on the appearance as it has rather disappointing head."
""
""
"I had this on draft in the village it was made in and it was fantastic / delicious. BUT this review is based on the bottle I had in Brighton and it was average, a little bitter and had an unpleasant burnt after taste."
""
""

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Well rounded, complex, really beautiful."
""
""
"Poured from bottle. First impression of aroma is green apple with hints of vanilla and banana.  Pours a dark brown with tan head. Medium bitter taste. Medium body, creamy texture, average carbonation, with a bitter finish.  Very nice Dubbel."

"11.2 oz bottle dated 4/11/15, poured in a chalice.  Pours a dark brown in color.  Head didn't retain for very long.  Carbonation is on the above average side.  The smell first struck me as cinnamon, perhaps raisins as well.  Taste reminds me of a Cherry Coke with a very full body, creamy and malty.  Very interesting taste for a beer.  The sweetness really lingers in the aftertaste, and it is very pleasant.   I really enjoyed this beer."

"330 ml bottle. Pours dark amber with tall, long-lasting, foamy off-white head and nice lacing. Aroma is of bready malt, caramel and dark fruits. Body is full and smooth. Spicy yeast, caramel malt, bread crust, plums, raisins, brown sugar fill the mouth. Finish is long and spicy, sweet and complex. Delicious brew."

""

"Pours a rusty brown colour with a very fine grained head. Not much lacing, but very nice looking. The smell is so incredibly clean. I get notes of grass, cherry, bread and a hint of citrus. The taste is very refined. Quite complex, with a noticeable level of alcohol and lots of malts balanced out very well with a mildly bitter finish. The mouthfeel is relatively dry, with very frothy carbonation. My goodness. This beer is wonderful."

"O-The balance makes this one of the best I have had this year, I always enjoy dubbels"
""
""
"O: very nice dubbel"
""
""
""
"Smells of sweet dark malts and dark fruit. Smooth taste of toasted malts, candy sugar and dark fruits, plums and raisins. Sweet but not sugary. A dry finish that leaves a lingering sweet aftertaste of toasted bready malts and fruitiness with a hint of chocolate. No taste of alcohol. Medium-full body and carbonation, creamy mouthfeel. Easily drinkable and very enjoyable. A really good dubbel, my favourite this far."

"D- This is a great brew. I think if it were a little thicker and had less carbonation it would have scored even higher for me. I'm sure the carbonation fades with time. Will stick a couple bottles in the cellar and forget about them for 5 years ..."

"Purchased a single 12 ounce bottle from Michiana Minimart on 1-23-2014 for $4.49. Taste tested on 1-26-2014. Bottle had a ""Best before end:"" date of 15/06/13. Medium hard pour resulted in two fingers in the tulip glass. Appearance and smell were definitely above average. Taste and mouthfeel were excellent. Aftertaste held well and was also excellent. I would definitely recommend this Dubbel"
""
"O: Overall a good dubbel, a good example of the style, not exactly exciting, but it's definitely worth a try."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I have a winner, I am bowled over by this dubbel. I will set all others by this example. It really impressed me. I can only hope that others enjoy this as much as I have."
""
"Esta é uma das grandes representantes do estilo dubbel, e mais um respeitado rótulo trapista. Eu só conheci dois rótulo Westmalle, mas os dois mostraram representar cervejas de qualidade suprema, que com que certeza posicionam a cervejaria como um dos grandes nomes do mundo."
"O: it's not the best I've had, but I love dubbels and I love this beer -- you can't go wrong with the authentic Trappists' work. I'm missing some of the yeasty flavor you often get from a good dubbel, but I'm not missing it much. I could drink this anytime anywhere and be 100% happy ... so much good fruity sweetness."
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel - A very dry after taste which initially was surprising to me, and the carbonation made my mouth tingle."
"Pours out dark brown/ really dark brown with a three finger beige head with nice retention and some nice lacing. Smell is dark fruits, some dark malts, and just that smell of a blegian dubbel. Taste is much the same as the nose. Really no difference except maybe a tiny bit of sweetness and Belgian candy sugar. Mouthfeel is a little thick as one would like it and it great; Overall one of the greatest Belgium beers. Just really nice."

"The feel stops short of sweet, spices and the very light hops character balancing it expertly. A little dryness is pulled out of the medium, almost full body. Almost the whole of every sip is creamy smooth, flowing on the tongue like velvet as spiciness and alcohol play into the finish."
""
""
"O: A handsome brew that is excellent for sipping. I can’t comment on the availability, but something I would like to enjoy again. A good winter beer that is warming and highly delectable. Something I am looking forward to drinking again."

""

"WILL have again; worth searching for."
""

"Holy moly! Brilliant, self evident, inexhaustible and vital. This beer exemplifies the style and is worthy of your utmost attention."
""
""
"Thick & frothy white head sits on top of a dark red/brown beer that is almost opaque. Nice lacing on the glass. I smell white wine, citrus, raisin bread, some cinnamon. Flavor is out of this world: caramel, grapes, more of that raisin bread, brown sugar with a perfectly balanced but slightly chocolatey-bitter finish--a lot going on! The carbonation is really nice on the tongue. Slight warming from the alcohol. Exceptional."

""
"Overall This is a great Trappist brew, but it is not my favorite."
"I guess I have to get another bottle because I don't see what all the excitement is all about. I got none of the malty yeasty sweet flavor you expect from a dubbel. Actually it was not full flavored at all. I would compare it to a Becks dark. Very disappointed."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"taste is dark fruit, candied sugar and, to use a term someone else previously used (and is totally on mark), refreshing. refreshing is a great adjective for this. it's easy to drink, not too bitter, not too rich (like Belgians often can be), and very flavorful with raisins and figs (some cherry?)."

"Overall – It has a nice flavor profile, but is a little drier then what I was expecting for a dubbel. If you are looking for a crisp Belgian style with some good fruit flavors and nice roasted malt taste, then this is a good go too, but if you want something slightly more on the sweeter side then this is not what you want. It is certainly good and something to try if you are in the mood for something drier."

" Remarks: Did not score A, T, S, M at that time; so please disregard those scores"
"O - A great example of a matly, complex, strong Belgian dubbel."

""
""
""
""
"O- A very pleasant brew overall. I'm glad I picked one up, but the price is a bit steep."
""
""
"O-Along with the other Westmalle offerings, this brew is pretty easily obtainable across Belgium, including at my hotel restaurant, which is were I had a bottle for dessert one night last week. This is undoubtedly a good beer, with decent looks and above-average smell and taste, but there is nothing here that stands out and makes me say, ""Wow, I can't wait to drink that again."""
""
""
"O: This is a really good sipper. The dark fruits are amazing!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pairs well with street tacos, dark meats, and ice cream, especially pralines and cream ice cream; it's a damn good dubbel"
""
""
""
""
""
"O - a little underwhelmed. Especially for the price, but it is an import... This would be my ""cheap session beer"" if I lived in belgium and it was indeed cheap... Unfortunately it is not, at least here in the States."
"Very complex yet well balanced beer that was quite rich from the get go and dominated by dark fruits and sweet malts throughout. A really nice one that takes a while to open up but once it does there is no looking back."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall. A quality beer but maybe bot quite on par with other trappist offerings."
""
""
""
"O: If you search for a real complex beer try a trippel or a quadruppel, but if you look for a really good beer even if it is simple a Westmalle Dubbel will serve enough."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The first, and one of the best. A premier trappist ale that can work as an introduction or as a expert-level representation of traditional Belgian ales."

"Spiegelau tulip."
""
""
""
"You can't go wrong with this, I would say this would be a good starting point for anyone wishing to get into trappist beers, and don't want to start with a heavy quad and need something more accessible, but not lacking in the complexity and flavor dept. I will be buying this again and again, as it's a lot cheaper than it's Rochefort cousins. Like I say with every trappist beer I try, I alwasy have high expectations, and they never fail to dissapoint. It's not just hype, it's quality craftsmanship; monks make damn good beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this double is very agreable, easy to drink. Aroma of caramel malt, raisins and banana. Brown color, medium body, lively carbonation and bitter finish. This beer is medium sweet and bitter, well balanced with notes of banana and something that makes me think of almond-flavoured liqueur."
""
""
""
""
""

"I tasted a litte bitterness which persist to the finish. The finish duration is average."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Beer is medium-light to medium in body, with medium-low levels of carbonation that work well for its weight. The result is a mouthfeel primarily smooth, with slight foaminess, which flows across the palate quite easily. Closes quite dry with a medium amount of stickiness lingering on the palate."
""
""
""
""
"Much much better tasting than the ordinary less dark version. This beer is very rich and even better tasting than it's appearance would suggest. As usual, with me anyway, the first taste wasn't very gratifying but the second and every thereafter were very good tasting with that full taste ever present. The more you drink the more gratifying is its taste."
""
""
""
"Deep purplish brown with fluffy khaki head that lasts. Aroma of cookie, caramel, grape cola, herbal notes. Tastes evolves over time: cola, grape, caramel, cookie, herbal notes, mild earth, banana, some grass and veggie aftertaste. Medium bodied with high carbonation. Creamy and bubbly and dry. The beer evolves as its sipped. A beautiful legendary beer that is still the quintessential Dubbel. A real old world treat. It's our duty to keep buying this beer."

"Fantastic beer, with a beautiful dark brown appearance, and a *powerful* aroma. I was absolute amazed with it. The taste is very good, although I had other Trappist Dubbels that were slightly more delicate. But don't understand me wrong: this is a fantastic beer, full of character, and I really enjoyed it (as seen in the review scores)."
""
"O: A complex, malty beer."
""
""
""
""
"overall, much preferred this beer at room temperature, flavors and smells came out. Another sipping beer. Prefer the Rochefort 6 over this but nice Dubbel."
"Westmalle says this beer will improve for up to for years (mine was bottle 7.14.11) but knowing my palette I'd like a newer bottle. Still, it shows lots of highlights and the sum of those highlights is better than any individual part."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"In some respects this reminds me of the putrid sweetness of a barleywine with loads of sweet barley malts at first followed by a pungent, potent bitter hop finish. It burns a little on the end but not in a bad way. This is quite a beer."
"O - A nice dubbel that could be more bold.The biscuity base limits all that this beer can accomplish. Given this basis, they did a fantastic job."
""
""
""
""
"O: A great, subtle but flavorful Belgian."
""
"Complex and delicate. Loads of dark fruit and earthy aromas. Deceptively drinkable. This is a spectacular Dubbel."
"O: Decent drinkability. A really nice dubbel."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: One of the better dubbels available. Smooth, rich and tasty. Bless those monks."
"Poured into a snifter, this beer has a dark earth brown color to it with some fermentation floating around with the carbonation, and its all topped off with a nice thick head that slowly dissipates into a thin layer of bubbles surrounded by some really great lacing. The aroma is very complex, brown sugar, plums, figs and raisins all come up, apple and wine smells also come through. Slightly bitter overall, the flavors is just as complex, the hops are present as you swallow, mild grapefruit zest, dark fruits and some raisin are all mixed in. It has a medium-to-full body and is filled with carbonation. Overall, this is a very good beer and I’ll be drinking this one more often."
"Westmalle Dubbel is another Trappist gem. It must be tried if you even remotely favor Belgian ales."
""
""
"A beer that evolves as you drink it. Loved both the Dubbel and the Tripel, I will chase more brews from Westmalle."
""
""
""
"O: Really nice dubbel, probably the best I've ever had of this style. Better than the Chimay IMO."
""
"O: very tasty and delicious... Really love the weatmalles, both this and the tripel are delicious."
"Mouth feel was great and full. I've had this before with a bad pour and it seemed overly carbonated, but this time it was perfectly balanced. A great beer that is the pinnacle of the style."
""
""
"Overall, this is a a nice example of a Trappist ale, a style I continue to seek more examples of. I'll have to grab this brewery's Tripel next time."
""
""
""
"Bottle from Belgianbeershop.com. Head: beige, thick, stable, nice lacing. Color: dark red brown, very beautiful. Aroma: filled with roasted malts, chocolate, coffee, caramel. The taste is very well balanced with a fantastic full mouthfeel. Notes of caramel and banana. Very long finish. This is one of the best trappist ales, almost as good as the Westmalle tripel."
""
""
"Pours a deep, dark amber with lighter amber highlights. Fluffy, cream-colored one and half finger head. Candi sugar and a hint of almond on the nose. Complex flavors of caramel, chocolate, nutty grains, raisin, and date. Mild spice throughout. Drying from midpalate through the finish, crisp carbonation balances the syrupy medium body lightening it a bit. A fantastic representation of the style, a landmark brew."
""
"O- A very enjoyable brew. Its dark, roasty, nutty, and caramel, mixed with light citrus, fruits and crisp carbonation. It's very unique and very enjoyable."
"O: Not a bad dubbel. Somewhat thin though and the fruitiness is borderline sour. All depends if that sort of thing is your bag. For me - meh."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Very smooth, medium texture in the mouthfeel. An excellent beer in nearly every way. HIghly recommend it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Appearance is a hazy brown, and very (I mean very) foamy, definitely good to look at. Aroma of malts and wood mostly to my nose. Taste is very long-lasting, with dark fruits at first, ending with wood and dry notes. Mouth feel is not light but not heavy carbonation either, falls in between. The aroma is not as complex and nice as the taste, so don't let the first impression fool you. Definitely worth trying, glad I did."

"Overall: perfect equilibrium. Good trappist beer, long in mouth. Maybe the aroma is not so fine as the later taste, but in mouth is an amazing ale. Classic."
"Flavor is date, lightly bitter. Cassis perhaps. Smells sweeter than it tastes (I love that). Very slight tang at the finish."

"I've tried quite a few times trippel version of Westmalle and was blown away each time. That's why I decided to go for dubbel, too. It has awesome dark color, nice head, malty taste and dark fruits aromas. Alcohol is well hidden, although it does hit hard. Overall, would go for this one anytime again. I see it as suitable in the evenings and in the winter period. If i had to choose between this one and trippel, I would still go for the last."

"I have been harassed for years for turning my nose to dubbels. Don't ask me why. They just didn't sit right with me. Always seemed like the shitty little brother to my lovely quads. Not the juicy quads on these foreign girls that raid my nest, but the herculian brew we all raise a glass to. Those spectacular beverages that push the double digit mark on the ABV scale. For the second time in my life, I have been proven wrong. Avoiding dubbels meant that I was avoiding Westmalle Dubbel, and this beer happens to be one of the most finely tuned brews on God's green earth. The perfect balance. Exceptional taste and mouthfeel. Reminds me of the breasts I had in my mouth this past weekend. This, in turn, reminded me of the third time in my life I had been proven wrong. Right after discovering this special beer, I was approached my a loose-lipped Dutch girl at a hostel I was spending the night in. During conversation, breast size was brought up, and my friend guessed that she was a b-cup. I laughed at the notion that she was a b, since that chest was going nowhere but inward, so leaned closer for further inspection. With the Westmalle Dubbel in one hand, I used my free mitt to size up the specimen. He was right, b-cup. I then finished my Westmalle, and convinced her to fetch more beers. I then went to sleep. She could not trick me into sleeping with her. Since that night, I have realized that when guessing bra size, the b-cup is the go-to cup size. That guess will win you more battles than you lose. There is also such a go-to when it comes to world class beers. This is Westmalle Dubbel. It may not be the people's champ, like the over-hyped c-cup, but it is always the go-to when you need something to bring home. I am now a Dubbel man, and Westmalle is my girl."
""
"Final verdict: if you haven't had this ale, buy it: it won't let you down. It is more like champagne in consistency and in flavor than any beer I have had otherwise; I'm not a large fan of champagne (I once bought a bottle of Dom Perignon and Moet et Chandon White Star to see if it would make a difference: it didn't), but this isn't a putdown of the beer: it does what champagne could not."

"Poured from a bottle into a Westvleteren tulip. Thick two-finger tan head, dissipates to thin lighter tan head, chunky lacing. dark red/brown color. Looks good to me. Aroma is light on the nose. There is sweet/dark fruit, but also the typical crispness. It's not overwhelming, but the smell is fresh and light. Taste is similar to smell, except less sweetness, more dark fruit. IT does have a ""nectar"" flavor to it, but again overwhelming. Mouthfeel is fresh and crisp, almost like a champagne, with medium carbonation and relative smoothness. Overall I do really like this beer, perhaps more than Westmalle Triple, but certainly not as much as Rochefort 10 or Westvleteren XII. I would definitely get this again. Cheers."
""
"Drinkability: It's a very smooth drinkable beer accompanied with good flavors and aromas."
""
"Overall (4.5/5): Westmalle Dubbel is one extremely tasty beer. It packs a ton of great yeasty, fruity flavor into a relatively low ABV package (for the style). Despite being a bit flawed, it's one of the classics of the beer world, and it is a special occasion whenever it's in the glass you're holding. Superb!"
"Hmmm - not sure about this one. Perhaps I let it get too old? The sweet, fruity character that I would expect from a dubbel is present, but seems muted. The stewed hop/cardboard notes, on the other hand, are excessive and taint the flavour. The phenolic/alcohol hints also seem disproportionate. I'm not loving it, but I suspect it's gone stale and/or oxidised. I'll try and re-review when I get my hands on a fresher example."
""
""
"Bottle from Tipple's in Gainesville. Pours a deep purple brown with a one finger off white head. Aroma of figs, raisins, spice, yeast. Flavor follows with big fig and raisin flavors, some light pears, spicy yeast, sweet brown sugar. Medium to light mouthfeel, medium high carbonation, with a slightly dry finish. Lingering sweet dark fruit on the palate. Only complaint is that I'd like a little more body on this one. Very nice beer!"
""
""
""
"Overall this is another classic example of a Belgian dubbel. Not my favorite or the best example from Belgiam if you want my opinion, but tasty, not too filling and readily available. Not as good as the tripel but close."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Completely satisfying. To be honest, this is beyond my palate but I did my best. I used to avoid dubbels but it has rapidly become one of my favorite styles. I don’t know if I was drinking the wrong ones or just not paying attention, but I plan to investigate further."
"With warmth and each sip, this one just opens up so nicely which I find is the case with great beers. Amazing example of the style and what I look for from a strong yeast Belgian beer. Has that nice edge but doesn't kill you with spice, esters and alcohol."
""
""
""
"This was a very tasty beer, very nice flavor and easy to drink."
""
"O: Pretty boring. Maybe I don't like dubbels. I think the Westmalle goblet is too domineering for this light tipple."
""
"This was the first Belgian Dubbel I ever had, and I loved it so much that I spent months seeking out other, highly-rated Dubbels. But in the last four years, I have yet to find a Dubbel that I like more than this. It's not mind-blowing, but it's nearly perfect for what it is. This is always a treat."
""
""
""
"Review from 9/2010 notes. Poured into a Gulden Draak tulip. Pours a dark brown/orange amber. Healthy light brown head and slight lacing. Sweet malt aroma. Mild sweet malt flavor fades to dryer almost coffee taste. Slight dark fruits and dry spiciness. A pleasant taste, but subdued. Not as noteworthy as the tripel."
""
""
"Pours deep brown with a foamy beige head, decent retention and falls to a foam atop the ale. Not much for lacing on the glass, and the ale does have quite a bit of particulate matter floating about. Aromas are dark fruit, malty, Belgian yeast, faint booze, brown sugar. Tastes are sweet, malty, brown sugar, ripe dark fruit, plum, raisin, cinnamon, apple, banana. Mouth-feel is creamy and smooth, on the thinner side of medium. Finishes spicy with the alcohol somewhat hot, but warming as it goes down. Overall, excellent example of the style, exceptional quality, and even though this one was 3 years old, it's still in great condition. I love that about Belgian ales."
""
""
"D - Worlds apart from the Westmalle Tripel, which was one of the most disappointing tripels I've ever tried. This one the other hand, after many dubbels, quads, and BSDAs, still stands out as a remarkable beer. A truly classic Trappist beer that should stand as a benchmark for what this style should be; deep, rich, and complex."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Drink- It's a good dubbel. Nice flavors, a little compact in places. One of the better dubbels but still doesnt wow me."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is good fare, but suffers from a lack of any extraordinary characteristic to set it apart from its peers. The flavors here are good, but the beer feels like it needed more of something--sugars would be a good place to start--to bring out a lovely bouquet. The slight staleness to the latter half of the mouthful and aftertaste is also unsettling. It’s still a good Trappist ale, but simply needed to be more awe-inspiring."
""
""
"More grains than Rochefort, but not as much as Westvleteren.This is much more slick than the others, with a nice prune and cherry sweetness. Carbonation really makes the flavors pop and disappear. Finishes exceptionally clean and smooth."

"O - Very disappointing. I had saved this towards the end of a huge haul with the other special Belgians, thinking it would be a special Belgian, but it's not. It's unattractive and faint. The best you could say about it is that it's kind of light and refreshing if you're ever in the mood for something innocuous that doesn't really get you involved or bogged down, like if you're meeting someone for a drink but don't really want to and just want to drink up and get out. But you're left wanting after each sip, wanting flavor and richness and body. It's hard to believe it's 7%. I'd have guessed 3.5%. If I'd never heard of this beer, I'd rate it average. I thought I had heard it was really good so it's extra disappointing. That's not extra points off, just context. It's not offensive, just weak. I feel kind of robbed, given what it could have been. Will not buy again and if you offered me this at a party I might abashedly ask if you had anything else."
""
"Overall: I had this shortly after I turned 21 and it blew my mind. Drinking it now, it's still pretty tasty. A lot less mindblowing, but well-balanced and nuanced. A touch too carbonated for me in the long run. Flavors are on point though."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Satisfying and complex, this trappist ended up giving me a memorable experience. It wasn’t an incredibly satisfying palate, but it was nice and well-rounded; I’d buy it again, especially if I could find it really fresh somewhere."
""
""
""
""
"OVR - A very drinkable beer, quite complex, and the alcohol is very well masked. I find the balance between the sweetness of the roasted malts, and the acidity / sour of the fruitiness just a little off. The only reason it scored lower in certain areas."
""
""
"Overall a pretty good dubbel, typical of the style. Good example of the style, I'm just not generally a fan.... I'd drink this again if someone offered it but I wouldn't seek it out."
""
"Because I really enjoy dark Belgians of all kinds, I feel the bottle I had must have been past it's prime, as it's very close to the best-before date on the bottle. I've never had it before now, but will give it another go if the opportunity arises."
""
""
""
""
"330ml bottle, poured into Leffe chalice. Dark brown, thick, one and a half finger head, reasonable retention. Smelled pleasant fennel but not much else. Tasted roasted Maris Otter style malts and fennel. Bitter aftertaste with a hint of citrus hop at the very end. Mouthfull was coarse, not what I expected. Overall I was slightly disapointed, not as complex as I would have liked, would probably benefit from aging."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A great authentic Belgian Dubbel. Great fruity taste with a nice spicy kick."
"O: Easy to drink and quite enjoyable. The alcohol is very well hidden and there is a nice complexity to the flavors. Definitely one to get again."
""
"This is a complex brew that has many layers of flavors but lacks a ""good home feel"" that I like out of Dubbels. Still very good."
""
""
" I could certainly feel the effect of the alcohol when I finished the bottle along with the influence of dark fruit. No spice or lambic-like sourness here, just a wonderfully warm and inviting beer that called for a slow drinking session to enjoy it. No doubt that this deserves to be called one of the classics and a must-try for all who love a well-crafted and enjoyable brew. Highly recommended."
""
""
""
""
""
"Hands down one of my favorite Trappist Dubbel ales."
""
""
"O: This is a classic for a good reason. In this case it's more than the sum of its parts. It's rich and decadent. Extremely pleasant to be sipped slowly at the end of the night."
"Poured from bottle slowly into my Chimay chalice. Pours a murky dark brown translucent color, some dark orange/brown hues appear as the light hits the bottom of the glass. A nice rich fluffy off white/tan head fills the glass, and stays around for awhile, covering the sides of the glass with thick lace and leaving a creamy 1 finger of head when its done receding. Beautiful looking beer. Smell- dark fruits like raisins, some aged cherries, brown sugar. Not all that much going on with the aroma. Taste- WOW. cognac, cherries, brown sugar, raisins. This is an incredibly creamy and rich ale, perfectly carbonated and a perfect example of the style. My night has been much improved having had this ale tonight. The yeast Westmalle uses is legendary and deservedly so. Amazing."
"O- I have not had too many dubbel's before, but this one is superb. Will be buying more Westmalle for sure."
""
"mouthfeel: slightly sour, a little bitter, easy to drink. again with a little citrus but as opposed to the aroma, this is definitely stronger on the yeast end"

"Pours a cloudy rich brown with a red tinge. Great foamy tan head with good retention. Rich aroma with emphasis on the malt. Sweet caramel malt with some darker roasts and a fruity ester. Taste is the highlight here, orgy comes to mind. Rich caramel and darker malt, chocolate and nutty. Fruity esters also play a big role, date and raisin, entertaining to the last drop. Mouthfeel is very smooth, hint of alcohol. Overall a fantastic beer. Make sure you serve this at the right temp and you won't be disappointed."
""
""
"Overall: The smell and flavour of the Westmalle Dubbel leave me wanting more and more, but dubbels are easy to come by here in Vancouver so there's a lot of competition for it. I'd usually pick a dubbel with a less aggressive fizz."

"O - Very good overall. Not too sweet with a nice bread and spice presence."

""
"Overall, a trappist monastery in Belgium shines again. This is one of my new favorites for the style. Second behind Rochefort 8 for me. Haven't had Westy 8 to compare so this is second in my book."
""
""
"Overall: Excellent! World class for style. Unfortunately not cheap in the U.S. A great sipper: engaging, flavorful, interesting and easy to drink. The look, smell, flavor and feel all seem just right for each other. Highly recommended!"
""
""
""
""
"Pours hazy reddish brown with a tan head that retains well. Plenty of lacing is left on the glass. The aroma is sweet and of chocolate and maybe a bit of fig. The first sip feels creamy. I pick up flavors of roasted malts, sugar and fig. The finish is a bit dry and there's a mild spiciness to it. The flavor profile is well balanced. It's not too sweet. It's not too dry. The carbonation is definitely present, but it's not overwhelming. This hides its alcohol content very well and the mouthfeel is medium. Overall, this is an excellent beer."
""
""
""
"O: Possibly sour from either light or heat exposure. Unfortunately thats the major taste profile I get initially, and its a turn off, even though the secondary and finishing notes are so strong. Im going to rate this well regardless of its sourness because it was in fact still good. Not great, not perfect, not up to par with its older brother westmalle triple. This beer's age and improper storage may have led to the bottle's accelerating decline. These usually have a great cellaring history. Well, regardless, I would still recommend."

"The taste is, together with the drinkability, what makes this beer a difficult one to make one's tatse buds to it. Way too carbonated even for a Belgian brew, I shall give it a try leaving it at least a couple of months in the cellar; that's why it is that high my overall grade."
"I really like this beer a lot. It's a fine example of a true Belgian Abbey dubbel. If you've never had this beer, you are missing out!"
"Bitter taste, medium thick body. Bitterness stays in your mouth. Quite carbonated. Overall not bad, quite average."
"Mouth-feel: Has a creamy, smooth mouthfeel...very nice. Medium carbination...easy to drink."

"overall i would opine that this is certainly a classy trappist/belgian dubbel. i'm surprised that it's taken me so long to get around to sampling this and the tripel. slightly underwhelmed but not disappointed. definitely yummy stuff."
""
""
"I tried this beer a week ago over all a great beer, had a malty and hoppy feel taste and smell. Slightly bitter, with a smell of Omami, had a medium hold on the glass, the texture and taste was creamy with a hint of coco and dried fruits. I would recommend this beer to anyone who a beer that is not to bitter or sweet rather perfectly balanced. Have fun."
""
""
"Pours a slightly murky dark brown with a 3 inch foamy khaki head that settles to a craggy cap. A nice pattern of lace forms on the glass on the drink down. Smell is of bready malt, dark fruits (especially grapes), and sweet candi sugar. Taste is of slight candi sugar and dark fruits (plum, prune, grape, raisin) up front with a bready malt aftertaste. There is a slight earthy bitterness on the palate after each sip. This beer has a higher level of carbonation with a very crisp and bubbly mouthfeel. Overall, this is a fantastic dubbel and one of the best Trappist beers I have tried so far."
"O: My first Dubbel, and I am not disappointed."
"Nice drink that is sold at every supermarket."
""
""
"Single finger head with no real retention with some lacing. Cloudy maroon body. Nice sweet cherry and strawberry with yeast esters. More dark fruit in the flavor. Mostly raisin and cherry. Belgian yeast and mild spice. Medium body and high carbonation. I like how the aroma is more than a generic dark fruit aroma with individual flavors noted."
"11.2 ounce bottle into chalice, bottled 1/09/2011. Pours hazy and cloudy dark reddish brown color with a nice 2 finger fairly dense khaki head with fantastic retention that reduces to a thick cap that lasts. Some spotty lacing clings to the glass as well; with plenty of carbonation streaming up from the bottom creating a creamier head than on the pour. Aromas of huge raisin, caramel, molasses, prunes, biscuit, roasted nuts, light chocolate, and yeast spices. Big malty aromas here with good strength and balance. Taste of big caramel, molasses, pepper, chocolate, roasted nut, biscuit, dark fruit, and spicy yeast. Lingering notes of biscuit, caramel, chocolate, pepper, and yeast spices on the finish for a bit. Nice malty flavor with no cloying, and less spiciness than I was expecting from the yeast. Medium bodied with lively carbonation; with a fairly creamy and very smooth mouthfeel. Drinks incredibly easily with the high carbonation as well. Alcohol is essentially non existent with only a slight warming after the finish. Overall this is a fantastic Dubbel style as I would have expected. Great balance of flavors and dangerously drinkable."
""
""
""
""
"So far, this Westmalle and the Rochefort #8 are the two best Dubbels that I have sampled so far. I hope one day to give each of the Trappist dubbels a try but until then, this still remains one of my most favorite beers!"
"complex malts on the tongue, plenty of raisin, fig, brown sugar and pleasing warm alcohol. only ding is a bit of bite on the back end. not sure it was even taste so much as being what i consider slightly-overcarbed. regardless, a spectacular beer, always enjoy revisiting this one."
"O: a nice dubbel, pretty well rounded, best ive ever had? No, still good tho"
""
"Overall, this is tasty dubbel that's not too heavy and quite drinkable."
"Probably the best dubbel out there, definitely my new favorite."
"O. I haven't tried the Dubbel in about 5 years so i didn't know what to expect. The drinkability is better than i remember, but maybe that is also its downfall, as there is nothing too complex in the taste and is the reason i do not grab one of these very often."
""
""
""
""
"Overall a very good beer. Needs some time to develop into a sweeter, less bitter, complex and interesting beer. Not so interesting when young, but I now it's full potential."
""
""
"Overall - I think I expected a little more from this one. It has tremendous balance and is very drinkable but it doesn't have much of a wow factor. Still worth a try though."
"O: A great Belgian that I just want plot be more estery in the body."
"O-Anyone looking to make a dubbel-this would be a good one to try to mimic-fantastic beer. Great taste, mouthfeel and drinkability. Love this one-my favorite of the style. Loved the price and availability in Belgium too-wish I could have brought cases of this stuff home with me."

"Medium-brown, milky appearance, light brown head that was solid and long-lasting. Plenty of champagne-style bubbles. Nose was herbal, perfumy, some citrus notes. Taste was mildly hoppy with herbal and spicy notes. Mouthfeel was smooth, not thin, not heavy. Well-balanced, robust flavor."
""
"o - Overall a nice Belgian dubbel, and very good for the price and availability. Some nice dark fruits in the nose, and something I'd certainly buy again if I was in the mood for a dubbel."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Pretty much a flawless example of what these Trappist monasteries put forth in their splendid dubbels. It has everything that this kind of beer is supposed to have, and adds a nice twist with a more grapey character than you would normally see. It goes wonderfully with cheese and by itself, very easy to enjoy. About the only bad thing I could say about this beer is that it is not the very best I have had, but with that said it is certainly up there with many other great ales."

I just leaf through an old magazine while listening to some acoustic music like John Cage's compositions for string quartet, or Larry Coryell's Bolero cd."
""
""
""
"Pours a beige all-head which leaves a lasting floating merengue. Hazy rusty brown body. Smell has malt, caramel, and fig. Taste repeats the smell but also adds some sour rye. Body is lighter than I expected, medium weight at best. Alcohol seems even higher than the 7% reported on the bottle. All in all a good dubbel but on the hot side."

"D: overall, im not really in love with this. a bit weak as far as dubbel's go. i would look elsewhere for solid examples. not bad by any means, just not great."
"Overall: Just a classic beer that will always be a go to beer for me."
"O: Good example of the style. The mouthfeel on this is off for me, and some of the flavors are a bit tough to pick out (part of the fun!). It’s a good example of the style IMO. (4)"
"overall, very enjoyable, it definitely stands up even more considering its price and availability."
"If I have any caution with this beer, it is to be concerned with what food you pair it with. It can be overwhelmed by strong, spicy food to the point where you might miss the complexities of this beer. Take my advice and order simply. Or better yet, enjoy this beer with an open chalice, allowing the aroma to breathe. Take it slow and enjoy it on its own. You'll be glad you did."
"Overall I am wishing I could say more about how this tastes, but it tastes like drink club soda and nothing else. Pretty darn disappointing cause the nose is fantastic."
"Pours a deep brown color with a light tan head. In the aroma, dark fruits and a small note of alcohol. In the taste, dark fruits, a small caramel like presence, and just a note of alcohol.. A small bite and medium to bigger bodied mouthfeel, with a small dry and lightly sticky caramel in the aftertaste. Almost quad like, caramel is sticky sweet, and a nice coffee note, very nice."
"O: Good DUbbel but nothing Earthshattering but maybe I am missing something here"
"O - There's no doubt in my mind; this is a fantastic beer. It's by far my favorite dubbel, and I don't think anything else I've tried even comes close. Sadly it's taken me several years to get around to reviewing this (just as I'm lagging behind on reviewing everything else I've tried), but I decided to pop one open tonight and share my thoughts. The price is very reasonable as well- particularly when considering the pricier offerings that can't manage to come close as far as quality."
"Solid Dubbel."
"This has all the elements of why I love Belgian beer. It's fruity and spicy, and has that nice candy sugar flavor I have come to like. It does seem more like a cold weather beer, but one I would happily try any time of year."
"Good stuff. A complex, flavorful treat."
"O - It's like fine art that you can take out of the fridge and enjoy. I look forward to more of these in the future."
"LLove this beer. Underappreciated. Slow drinker like your suppose to drink beer. For the mature drinker. Classic dubbel with dryness like champagne. Goes well with cheese pastries my wife makes. Expensive even if you can find a deal. Three is usually all I can drink. This is not for the chugger. Dont leave in your freezer more than an hour or you have a slushy,which still tastes awesome. Ive discovered that if you wait till you get close to the expiration date on the back it becomes sweeter. One of my favorite beers to enjoy. Please try with patience."
"O - A beautiful complex beer that can easily be enjoyed."
"o - not a bad beer, but for almost $6 a bottle i was expecting much more. seems to be lacking the richness and fuller body typical of the style. maybe i just got a bad batch, but i doubt i would buy this again."
"This brew poured out as a nice chocolate brown color with a red highlight to it and a tan colored head. The lacing was light but stuck fairly well to the glass. The aroma is earthy, and slightly sweet. The taste of some earthy malts and dark sweet fruits take over in the mouth. The mouthfeel of this beer is really quite nice, it's very smooth, had a creamy body to it and goes down really easy. Overall this is probably one of my favorite Dubbel's, a style that I'm not overly crazy about but I find this one to be an exception."
"O: somewhat clean, straight forward beer, but very drinkable and inviting beer. I like the non sweetness! Classic."
"Overall, this is an extremely well-made Dubbel and should be the model for all others in its category."
"O: A pretty nice ale, but I would stick with much better belgian offerings. Maybe I'm not a fan of the dubbel style, or maybe this one just isn't for me."
"Overall, a triumph of a beer. So many flavours and aromas to mull over. Not to mention how easy it goes down. This was truly well worth the wait. Believe the hype. Simply delicious."
"Pours a dark brown, variably cloudy depending on your pour, with a cap of foamy, off-white head that retains well and laces moderately well. Dark sugars and dark dried fruits in the aroma. Taste is woody, bready, yeasty, with notes of brown sugar, caramel, dried fruits: raisins, figs, and the like. Some banana and spice moments slip in once in a while. Medium-bodied and very nice to drink. Though I prefer its elder sibling, the Tripel."
"Overall - pretty interesting and a good brew in general. Worth the try!"
"O - I'm not generally a Dubbel fan but this is a great example of the style."
"Excellent dubble. Complex, medium bodied, and interesting. Easy and enjoyable drink."
"O: A very nice beer. Still just scratching the surface in terms of Dubbels, but I look forward to trying some more soon. Will be interesting to see how this one stacks up to Chimay, Rochefort, etc."
"O - A very well crafted trappist dubbel. However I still prefer the Chimay Premiere Red over this. But this still is a class brew. Outside the Rochefort brews, both this and the Chimay are 2 of the best dubbels available and are fairly easy to find in the small populated area I live in. Remember, you can't go wrong with Belgian Trappists. They are brewed with quality in mind, and this one is no different. It goes right in line as another world class trappist."
"The CPJ"
"Scores are for the bottle. "
"This beer pours a medium brown color with a decent off-white to tan colored head. The smell is rich dark fruits brown sugar and a slightly Belgian yeast smell. The flavor follows suit but is fairly mellow and well blended together bthe carbonation is medium and a medium body to it noverall this is a B+ to A- beer"
"It's only competitor in its class would be trappistes Rochfort number 8. Both are great beers and for the cost in my area you won't find any better unless you want to up your price."
"Extremely solid dubbel, although for the price I'd usually pick a Rochefort 8 instead."
"Overall- Very good dubbel, definitely will be drinking this again. Nice complex flavor, and the ABVs are hide nicely. This is one of those beers that you just have to try at least once."
"Very, very nice overall. A bit more body, a little less aggressive carbonation and a little more sweetness and it would have been a 5."
"O - this gets big point for having all the peripheral qualities of a dubbel, BUT bringing in a unique flavour profile that makes it more interesting than the typical offering, I see a repeat purchase in my future"
"The beer pours a hazy brown color with a decent-sized tan head. The aroma is heavy on the raisins and cherries with some nice brown sugar notes. I also get some yeast notes. The flavor is not as fruit as the aroma. I get some raisins and plum notes, but what is more prevalent is the toffee from the malt. The yeast is also present in the flavor. There is some brown sugar flavor but the beer is fairly dry overall. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. A world classic beer that never disappoints."
"D/O: Remarkably drinkable. It's balanced, light, bitter-sweet, and enjoyable. I would gladly follow this beer up with another."
"Overall: Worth a shot, but I have to wonder if sitting for a couple of years may ease the sharpness of the body, which is easily my least favorite aspect of this beer."
"My favorite regular Belgian beer, and definitely my favorite dubbel."
"Westmalle Dubbel pours a typical dark purple/brown. Ruby red highlights shine through with some exuberance when the beer is held to light. The light tan colored foam maxes out at over four fingers in height, and shows some solid retention. Lacing isn't nearly as widespread as it should be though. The nose doesn't have quite the amount dark fruits than I'd like, and the result is an aroma that's a little too phenol heavy to really appeal to me. The flavor has a similar dark fruit deficiency, but unlike the nose it's at least replaced somewhat by a toffee note. The clove, spicy phenol notes on the back end are intense, and threaten to overwhelm the beer. The mouthfeel at least has the excellence I've come to expect from trappist beers. The body is beguilingly light for a beer with a definite sweetness in its flavor profile. At the same time the carbonation, even at the bottom of the glass, is active enough to give the beer a vibrant energy. Westmalle Dubbel is a solidly brewed beer, I'm just not a huge fan of the fruity ester vs phenols balance in this one."
"Overall - Very smooth and easy to drink. The floral fruit flavors really add bold sweetness. Each drink is balanced, sweet with mild yeast in the background. The beer is affordable, widely avaible and a great example of the style. One of the best."
"Overall, a fantastic beer. The best dubbel that I have had. A classic."
" Ultimately, this beer ends with a well balanced blend of chewy and almost leathery malts. The balance tips towards the malt/alcohol side but the hops dash around in the background giving this beer a bright spunky spark. The beer goes down smooth and beckons for another taste. This beer is wonderful in all aspects. The flavors are distinctive and each sip is a pleasure. This would pair very well with desert foods. It is a perfect evening beer."
"O - A great example of one of my favorite styles; moderate and balanced. Not too high in alcohol, not too sweet or too sour."
"This pours a hazy brownish color with a large light brown head with large bubbles which quickly goes away (which seems to be different than most reviewers here). The smell is nice, very fruity with a hint of caramel. The mouthfeel is nice medium thickness lots of carbonation. The taste is good different than I expected, there is a hint of sweetness, maybe a little bit of fruit and some malts but then it finishes dry and spicy good stuff."
"Dr: Relatively high ABV, very fairly priced, and incredibly easy to drink. It's very commercially available and it's high quality. It's a shame people may try to make counterfeit Westvleteren with the bottles, but the beer isn't to blame. She's certainly worth a go if you like beer."
"O- absolutely lovely."
"Overall an excellent beer, though heavier, darker and more of a winter/cold weather beer than the tripel."
"Overall: A nice beer, very easy to drink. Never lets you down"
"Taste was spicy with a hint of fruits like raspberries. Caramel sweetness on the end. There were different flavors developing constantly and it combined with great a mouthfeel. Highly drinkable. Very impressed."
"This is one of the better examples of the style, which isn't my favorite but I'm gaining a new appreciation for it."
"Pours dark brown with a light beige head. Has a nice sweet plum/raisin aroma. The spiced fruity flavor is coupled with wonderful abbey yeast compliments you would expect from this brewery. The body was very smooth and went down far too easy. Left me wanting another."
"O/D - Basic Dubble IMO. Not spectacular but a nice gateway to Belgian styles I suppose. Obviously the beer lost something on draught compared to the bottle, but it was still alright."
"O: Easily the most enjoyable dubbel I've had to date. The berry and custard flavours are really juicy and vibrant. 4.5"
"M. Medium bodied with a good amount of carbonation, this beer glides on down. Tasty and refreshing, the spices on the end build to a very nice taste that stays with you."
"O-overall this is a subtle but impressive dubbel. it'll satisfy any craving for a good belgian. i enjoyed this all the way through. It tastes better every time I get it."
"In all good, especially with a ripe goat cheese and bread. This was sampled and compared with the bottle, more smell and taste."
"Poured from 750ml bottle into snifter glass. Pours dark brown beer with big and beige head. Aroma is full, plums, raisins, some redcurrants and syrup sweetness; overally aroma is full and fruitfull, pleasant. Almost full-bodied, smooth and nice to drink. Lot of dark fruits also in the flavor, plums and raisins. Flavor is not very sweet, but balanced and quite dry and long aftertaste. Medium bodied and sticky mouthfeel. Decent carbonation throughout. Dry caramel malt finish. Pleasant dubbel."
"33 cl bottle. Pours a light cola brown with a very big very light tan head that sticks around for a long time and leaves a lot of lacing on the glass. The aroma is raisin, plum, some light licorice, some spicy yeast, and very light alcohol. The initial taste is raisin and plum. This then goes into some very light molasses with some spicy yeast on the finish. No alcohol in the taste. Pretty dry overall. Light body. Medium carbonation. Overall a very enjoyable beer."
"Overall: This is a strong example for the style, and balances the candy sugar and fruits with the malt backbone very well."
"The aroma was nearly spot on as well. Rich notes of spice, dark fruit, plums, raisins, mostly in the front as a nice grainy and bread like aroma started to peak through as it really warmed up, along with a light hint of a spiced pear or apple. At the first sip I was in love. I am not normally a fan of the style as it is usually rather plain for me, sitting somewhere between the sessionable and the extreme, but a whole new life was brought forward for me here. Key word in this beer was smooth, it was simply breathtakingly smooth and subtle. Rich notes of raisins and plums, hints of light spice, pears, great yeast notes here. There was just such a smooth, subtle flavor here. I really am at a loss, as I rarely find a beer this drinkable. The long aftertaste was rich with a ripe fruit flavor that left an almost funky note that was only detectable after a few minutes after the sip. Just a wonderful expierence."
"O: Very good beer, very good Dubbel. As compared with Chimay Premier, Westmalle is less fruity, drier, more hop bite. Depends on your preference, but both excellent."
"I loved this one and once again another great Trappiste"
"Lovely nobel hop aroma with estery fruit notes. Many flavors present, bubblegum, clove, and a very slight pineapple tartness, with a dry caramel finish. Light phenolics and heavy carbonation give an exuberant mouth feel to the beer as expected with a true trappist style dubbel."
"Very drinkable indeed. Can have this over and over. All in all, it's a quality Dubbel that won't leave you feeling like you've just had a quality Dubbel."
"O-Dessert in a bottle. A great after dinner beer."
"O- Overall a very solid Dubbel that I would certainly recommend to a friend."
"A dark cola brown with red highlights and an espresso cstyle thick creamy head. The Belgian yeast is all over the place. Fruity esters, sweet alcohal and warm bread scents, then almost a candy apple smell. The taste is sweet medium roasted malts and warm alcohal notes. There is some spice and a bit of walnut with a touch of bitter smokiness. The mouthfeel is dry with some heavy carbonation. I feel like I should throw on some flip flops and a brown dress. The monks have done themselves proud. This is a good European brew and I feel quite distinguished drinking this aromatic concoction."
"Overall, a good Belgian ale to drink in the warmer months."
"O- A must for Belgium Dubbel lovers."
"(11.2oz bottle) Pours dark brown-dark mahogany when held up to the light with a khaki head. Aroma has candied sugar, dark fruit, and sherry-like notes. Taste is a sweet malt backbone with a little sour and some hops on the end. Thin bodied with a creamy texture. Finish is a bit dry, but smooth. Some effervesence. Not the best trappist beer out there, but still a very nice beer"
"O - I will seek this beer out again in the future. Wont find it in my neck of the woods, unfortunately."
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied and carbonation is about average for the style. The real draw of the mouthfeel is the thick and creamy head that you get on each sip. Overall it was a good beer, and a very good example of the style. Nice beer to sip on this evening."
"Overall Drinkability - The whole is better than the sum of the parts. I really like this beer. But it's a Trappist, so is that really so surprising?"
"Overall, despite my reservations with hyped beers, I was pleasantly surprised. I actually ordered another at the end of the evening. For a Dubbel, this one ranks at the very top for me. Sets the bar very high for strong ales, without a doubt."
"Taste is surprisingly mild. Muted cocoa, caramel, crisp and dry with a bitter finish."
"This is a good beer. One of the better dubbels I've had. Unfortunately the aroma is a little better than the taste."
"O: A delicious Trappist Dubbel, worth every second to savor. Took the better part of an hour to work my way through this one, and I am left wondering where that hour went. A great journey."
"Medium-Full, creaminess and a dryness"
"A great Trappist beer."
"Ah, now that I think about the mouth feel of the drink, I can understand the claim to high attenuation. It has actually gotten better as it warmed, but still not my ideal Trappist choice."
"Enjoyed on 3/2/11 in a Chalice glass. Burnt sienna color, cloudy body. Headed beige close foam, small bubbles, carried on ´til the end. Wide lacing. High sensation of malty aroma, yeast & low hoppiness. Medium body, low carbonation very well balanced. Very soft & dry bitterness in mouth. Perception of high level of alcohol under your tongue, crisp. Subtle chocolate on the aftertaste. Surprising beer even not being my favourite one of the style. Suggested for a long & paused drink."
"Overall: Excellent. I think I might like this even more than Chimay Grande Réserve. Would absolutely love to have this on a regular basis, unfortunately it isn't too common and isn't cheap either. One of my top beers."
"O - What a great beer. A very complex and flavorful brew that goes down smooth."
"Not a bad drop, but I've had better dubbels, and better trappist dubbels as well. The style is a good basis, whatever happens, but I feel this could have been better."
"Very complex and heavy in the mouth but with a smooth, warm finish. Some remaining tartness and hops coat the palate. Hard to describe this one...just a master of the style and worth a try."
"D: Trappists do it better."
"Very good overall."
"D. A very drinkable dubbel. As good in bottle form as on tap."
"This dubbel has a large billowing white fluffy head. The liquid is ruby colored and the head leaves lacing all the way down the glass. The aroma is belgian yeast all the way. Fruity esters and spicy notes are at the forefront. Kind of light. The flavor is subtle as well mimicking the aroma. Not as full and rounded out as I would appreciate, but still very good. Mouthfeel is great. Belgian candi sugar lightens this one right up with good carbonation levels. Overall, this is a great beer with awesome drinkability. It is a pleasure to split a bomber of this beer."
"Big deep dark amber pour, not much on top, head was prettty thin, but still appealing. Smell was a massive caramel, malty sweetness. On to the taste, and well, very malty sweetness as the nose, but a nice dry fizziness to finish it off. At first I was not that impressed, but that was based on the hype, but as I drank a few more sips, it warms up to you and the fizziness on the end cleans the pallate and your ready for more. A true classic, amesome to pair with cheese."
"Overall I much prefer this to the tripel offering of Westmalle trappists --- this is probaly largely a stylistic preference."
"Overall this is just an amazing beer. Very drinkable throughout. I'd love to try this on tap."
"O- To me this was a good beer. Not as great as some of the other Trappist beers out there but it holds it's own. I would drink this one again."
"A fantastic beer that should be enjoyed slowly."
"Overall: Another world class Dubbel that I find to be enjoyable, but does not quite knock my socks off. Not sure why, as I like Quads and Belgian Strong Dark Ales a lot."
"D: This is a very fine beer, I just wish I liked the flavor more."
"M/D - Medium bodied, but a clean, balanced finish. It's actually a challenge to savor the beer because it is so drinkable."
"Poured a dark murky brown with a tan fizzy head that was fully diminishing and had poor lacing. The aroma was heavy of roasted malts and molasses, light resin hops and a moderate scent of a horse blanket yeast. It tasted slightly malty and extremely bitter at first and ended with a bitter acidic flavor that layed in the back of your throat. Mouthfeel was light in body and watery in texture with a fizzy carbonation. Overall an OK brew, but nothing special."
"M/D: This beer was a gusher, but it was not overly carbonated, just the right amount to capture the smooth and creamy nature of this beer. A lot going on, kept my interest the whole way through. Highly drinkable, I could drink this all day."
"Medium bodied, carbonation is on the high side of medium. This is a very easy beer to drink. I will look for this again."
"But the taste is wonderful with cocao and coffee notes, but not nearly as over bearing as Stouts and Porters usually are with those flavors. With an amazingly creamy mouth feel, and no off notes anywhere in my experience with the beer. Absolutely wonderful."
" Drinkability - As a huge dubbel fan, this is one of my favorites and i could drink this guy all day. That being said, it may be a tad too sweet for more than a single bomber in one sitting."
"D-very drinkable. Done with me taste in no time."
"Pours a yellowish brown. A good amount of off-white head. Dissipates leaving a bit of lacing on the glass. Smells sweet and floral. Lots of yeasty smells as well. Tastes sweet and floral. The yeast blends well with malty sweetness. Thick solid mouthfeel. Very drinkable. Incredibly tasty. A pleasant surprise. I was expecting to like doubles less than I like triples but quite the contrary!"
"Very drinkable considering the sytl"
"D: Drink this beer."
"Pours a lovely amber brown, with a decent off-white head that remains as a layer of bubbles on the surface. Smell is mostly malts and fruit with a bit of yeast, but smooth. Taste is lovely, with gentle sweet malts up front with medium fruit that smoothly blends into a nice light hop bitterness. Very well balanced. Mouthfeel is fantastic, just a bit too much carbonation, but nicely coating. Extremely drinkable - could drink this stuff for hours."
"The taste wasn't what I was expecting on this one. Less rich than other dubbels I've had. Overall a fantastic beer but not my favorite dark trappist. Worth seeking out though."
"Overall- Wonderfully mild but tasty dubbel. Another great Belgian creation."
"Pours very dark brown and clear with an impressive off-white head. Smells of malt and light yeast, with some green apple-like scents. Tastes slightly sweet with hints of plum and very light alcohol notes and the noble hops trademark touch of bitterness without the off-putting pine needle cut. Soft and nice carbonation, with a great drinkability factor due to slightly dry finish. This is my personal favorite dubbel style in the solar system, if only they were all made this way."
"D - Quite a nice change from the hop bombs I usually drink. Refreshing. I think this would pare well with food."
"Picked up a couple of bottles at Il Corte Ingles in Jerez. Pours a dark reddish brown into my chalice with some tan head that provides mild lacing. Smell is kinda like tofee and liquor. Taste is somewhat complex- chocolate-toffee, raisins-pears, and taste the alcohol. Mouthfeel is somewhat carbonated and light bodied-lighter than I would have expected for a dubbel. Drinkability is fine-I could drink another sometime soon."
"Drinkability: Crisp and light with a pleasant balance of flavors. Tartness, semi-sweetness and dryness combine nicely."
"excellent beer, understated and delicious as well as fairly light. exceptionally drinkable."
"D: A nice dubbel, not ovely sweet. I would definitely drink more of this brew."
"D - Nice flavor balance. A touch boozy."
"D - I could drink this all night long. Very good beer here."
"It's about time that I finally put my thoughts of this beer down on paper (digital paper). It pours out a dark brown-mahogany color with a beautiful head that leaves a great ring of lace. The head retention is unreal! The smell is wonderful; raisin, plum, slight alcohol, and a slight sweet spociness. The taste is similar. Super complex yet still delicate. It has a medium-full mouthfeel. I don't want this beer to end!"
"Drinkability - Great sipper, one of those beers that really demands your attention to enjoy. Not a casual beer. Drink above 55 degrees in my opinion, and pay attention to the subtleties as it warms to near room temperature. You'll be glad you did."
"D- Good beer, not my favorite style but it definitely is good, wouldn't session this beer, but for the price it is to acquire that wouldn't be an option for me anyway."
"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was its sweet, and subtly robust, aroma. The notes in the nose complexly blend together, to leave much to be desired in the taste. Here, it was a bit underwhelming, and the feel was surprisingly light. As you sip, however, it is quite creamy right off the edge of the glass, making you want to go back for another satisfying sip on the lips."
"My favorite Trappist to date. D Train could drink this brew all the way down the line..."
"The drinkabilty is superb, for it gets better and better with every sip and as it gradually warms, further enhancing the flavor. ""Trappist"" should be its own group on the food pyramid. Despite the cost and trouble to find it in the states, I wouldn't mind having one every day."
"I have not experienced a beer quite like this, it is different than other dubbels I've had yet possesses recurrent similarities that make it unmistakably Belgian. The beer would pair nicely with a variety of foods because it offers complexity yet balance and therefore would not detract heavily. I liked the beer at a slightly cooler temperature (45-50 degrees Fahrenheit recommended), but I wonder how room temperature would have suited."
"A year past its declared BB date, the Westmalle Dubbel is mainly distinguished from his above reviewed younger brother by more pronounced sweetness enhancing the malt-perception, absence of fruity tartness and poorly sustained head with less carbonated body. The scores for this one are 3, 4.5, 4, 2.5, 4 = 3,75"
"D - Flavour is rather stronger than expected - not nearly as sweet as some other dubbels. Definitely no chocolate-type flavours here, only a touch of sweet sugar but dominated by a darker bock-style taste."
"My first evidence that not all trappist beers are nectar from God."
"After recently acquiring a job bartending at a Belgian Bar in New York, I have been delighted with my exposure to new beers and with a full immersion of the Belgian styles. I have since taken a new favorite, Westmalle Dubbel. Everything about this beer is amazing. I love the mouthfeel and could drink this beer alone, with food, on a cold day, or in an alley and I would be happy. I feel that the carbonation combined with the subtle notes of chocolate and malt just make an explosion of flavor that surprised me the first time I drank one. I was a huge fan of the Triple and randomly tried the Dubbel and soon found a new favorite. The proper pour in the proper glass just gives me a happy feeling every time I return to it. Combine this with the traditional Belgian Carbonnades Flammandes for an exceptional dinner."
"D- very drinkable beer, one of my personal favorite dubbels. Well balanced, no overwhelming flavors, could definitely drink a few of these in one setting."
"Drinks very well. I'll definitely have this one again."
"O: A great dubbel that lacks the sharp, often peppery, spiciness of others in this style. Very drinkable with mild, pleasing flavors and dry-moderate finish. Malt is accentuated due to low spiciness for the style. My favorite dubbel at the moment."
"D: This is truly a gem and being the original ""dubbel," it certainly sets a high bench-mark for what should be expected from the style."
"Same yeast as westvleteren but a completely different beer, it would be fun to pick up one of these next time i get my hands on a westy and compare."
"Drinkability - pretty drinkable for the style. Not my favorite style but I still thoroughly enjoyed it. Well worth my purchase."
"Pours a deep brown with miles of rocky head. Lacing is spectacular. Fruity, citrusey hops dominate the nose. Dark fruit you'd expect in the style is there but subdued. Light waft of alcohol presence, but not at all overdone. Start is overwhelmingly carbonated. Sweet malt, fruity at the start. Alcoholic finish. Strong bready presence from the middle to the aftertaste. Not a bottle conditioned Trappist ale, but still strong yeast character. Medium to light mouthfeel - lighter than I expected. Highly drinkable!"
"On tap at Stoffel in Tilburg, Netherlands. Served into Westmalle chalice. Ruby in color, pinky of foam. Thick, soapy lacing. Aroma is sweet with malts, dominated by raisin and molasses. Taste follows suit. Blends together many complex flavors and notes. Very easy to drink. An all time classic."
"D - Easiest dubble I've ever had. Smooth and perfect."
"The taste is just too coarse and prickly for my preference. I was hoping for a slightly smoother beer, but alas no. The yeasts really add a harshness that takes away the candied sugars, and Belgiany malts that I was looking forward to. The slighly burnt, coarse, prickly, banana and the slightly boozy pineapple flavors just don't blend all that well. The beer has a harsh cardamon spiciness that doesnt' play nice either. Where's the nice caramel malts, where's the candied sugars, where's the star anise? The beer settles in a bit as it warms and that helps. I'm still a bit disappointed with this beer."
"D- given the full flavours and thicker creamy feel this one is suprisingly easy to drink, although best enjoyed as a slow sipper to allow all the flavours to come through and develop."
"This is nothing at all what I thought it would be. This is such a breath of fresh air to go back to the basics to realize what makes a classic dubbel. The dry finish keeps me coming back for sip after sip. I'll be sure to pick up more of these in the future."
"Westmalle Dubbel has a cloudy dark amber colour and an excellent head due to the excellent carbonation. The smell is nice: citrus and hops. The flavour is similar. You get citrus upfront into slightly bitter orange rind and hops. This beer is foamy and thick in the mouth. Nice, but not the best of this style."
"WS"
"Overall this beer is very easy to drink and has a wonderful complexity. I can't wait to drink this again."
"At 7% abv, you can definitely enjoy a few of these in a sitting. All in all, an exceptional world class beer that can drank and enjoyed over and over again."
"Drink well my friends."
"Full body from the strong, tight carbonation. A bit rough going down. I do love high carbonation, but this stuff is intense."
"This tastes, as expected, like a dubbel, with a slightly smokey or peaty finish that betrays its sweet scent. The 7% ABV remains well hidden, with the exception of a slight alcohol bite on the finish as it warms up. It's solid, yet doesn't quite measure up to my favorite dubbel, St. Bernardous Pater 6."
"D - Drinkability is this beer's forte. With only 7% ABV, I could see myself knocking back several of these. However, at $7/bottle I couldn't see drinking more than one at a time."
"D - I just finished my first and I want another, if that tells you anything. But at $7 a bottle, I only bought one. :-("
"Had a bottle for $7 at the Steelgarden in Bethlehem, served in a goblet. I've been reading about Belgians lately, so this really hit the spot. It was almost wine-like for it's relatively thin body, bitter spices and smooth (but hardly sweet) fruit. There was a rummy raisin-grape character up front with a peppery, and surprisingly bitter finish. The middle of the flavor was light, with almost a sort of strawberries and cream taste. Very interesting, very tasty. An absolute classic."
"I foud the Westmalle dubbel to be abit atypical for a dubbel. A noticable roasty-ness dominates the taste, the plumy-ness that I typically love was undetectable and the body seemed a little thin. While the Westmalle dubbel didn't really met my preconceived expectations of a dubbel it was still a very enjoyable beer."
"I was a little surprised I've never reviewed this one because I've had it several times before and will be having it again"
"Notes: Another iconic and reliable Trappist offering. Maybe it is a touch too tepid but is quality throughout and always worth holding."
"Had this one fresh on-tap, wasn't that impressed. Maybe a bit too soft for me, or too fresh, no pronounced flavors or aromas to me, not remarkable. Will pass final judgement when I get one from a bottle. I've noticed I like bottles more than tap at the moment..."
"Serving type: bottle"
"Salud!!"
"I am a huge fan of the triple Westmalle, the darker brother is ok also!"
"Had this tasty Trappist on tap in Brussels and also get it bottled in NJ. In either case, it is one of my favorite beers. From the taste to the appearance, I love this beer. Smooth and very drinkable, not very strong but not weak either (the perfect medium). Highly recommended!"
"Mouthfeel is a bit heavy but with this much flavor, it works out well. Overall, this beer is one of the best representations of this style. Truly a classic Dubbel."
"easily accessible by me and a good tasting beer. I would definitely try more of these in the future, with different glasses, temperatures, etc. alcohol high but not TOO high. I've tasted better and would opt for something like a Rochefort, but this is still a great beer."
"The dubbel is very drinkable but the mouth-feel is a bit too light for me. Still, an outstanding product from Westmalle. I would drink this again."
"F/D - Fairly carbonated which brings out the full flavor of the dark fruits. A full, deliciously rich feel. Trappists like this make me realize why I love beer."
"The Westmalle Dubbel pours with with a dark red burgundy color with a nice off white head. the nose opens up with your typical Belgian aroma dark fruits like dried plums and figs with the typical Belgian yeast. The taste is a bit more subtle the fruits are a bit on the wayside and the yeast is a bit more prominent. This is a very tasty beer the mouth feel and carb is right on i could probably put down a few of these"
"Pours a dark brown with a few reddish highlights. Off white head and good lacing. Smell is dark plums and raisins with a good amount of caramel and dark sugars. Taste is a bit less unrefined, with the yeast characteristics not coming through nearly as much. More of a bready-type flavor. Mouthfeel is fairly full and rich. Drinkability is okay; not nearly as impressive as their tripel."
"It is slightly sweet. Angelically so, very balanced malt that does not tip over the edge. Slight esters/phenols, vinous, slightly spicy. So delightful. My mouth is baffled."
"Nice tan head, leaves plenty of lacing. Deep mocha color brown. Raisins, figs, prunes, caramel, roasty malts, and faint spices. The flavor is of dried rich vinous fruits. Not as spicy as I like a dubbel to be, maybe a little too malt forward. I detect a touch of roasted barley or chocolate malt. Clean finish, dry finish. Not cloying which is nice for the style."
"M: very smooth."
"Oh damn. I poured the spent yeast into the glass. I don't want to drink that. crap."
"Mouthfeel was nice, drinkability was relatively easy. Light and refreshing as far as Dubbel's go."
"Dark coal brown color. Modest creamy head. Sweet sugar caramel taste that went very well with the house cheese, clean and delicious. Not much of an aroma, maybe light yeast and wheat. Full rich beer that does not fatigue the pallate."
"11.2oz. bottle served in my Maudite tulip. 14/07/11 indicated on the back label. Pours a hazy plum with a two-inch, frothy, cream-colored head. Head eventually collapses into a solid quarter in cap with thick swaths of lacing coating the sides of the glass as the brew recedes and with each tilt of the glass. Nose is fairly subdued - malt, spice, a faint suggestion of prunes and some phenols. Taste follows nose, but extremely watered down. There's also a slightly bready quality and some herbal bitterness that lightly lingers between quaffs. I have to say that I was expecting more. Mouthfeel is medium-light, with a fairly assertive carbonation. While I really enjoyed the tripel, I have to say that the dubbel left a lot to be desired. A bit disappointing and not worth the $6.99 pricetag. A fairly lackluster dubbel in my opinion."
"It drinks with a nice velvety smooth texture. Very drinkable in the beginning but gets pretty heavy on the stomach towards the end. A really good dubbel. God bless the monks at Westmalle Abby!"
"Beer is medium bodied with good carbonation in the mouth. About the most drinkable dubbel I've ever had. Good dark fruit notes in the midpalate and a good non-dry finish. I love this beer a lot."
"I am a bit bias toward the Trappist beers. When I first heard about the Westvleteren I just had to find it. When I finally got a taste it was the most amazing experience. It felt as if I was tasting history. That got me excited about the Trappist beers in general and then I finally found the Westmalle and Rochefort beers. I have to say they are just as amazing. This guy, even at a 7% abv, is highly drinkable. It has a great brown sugar taste and just makes me tingle. The dubbel and tripel are just so good. Nice sweet smell and just hits the palette in a way that makes you want more. I would recommend this to anyone. My fiance does not care much for beer and this one she even liked."
"D- Highly drinkable. It's not a heavy beer, and the bitterness does not close my stomach. I could definitely go for another."
"Drinkability: This beer is very drinkable. It has some body to it but not too much to feel heavy. Overall just a great beer that I am pleased to have had, and will be having again."
"But then again it's a good beer, for me in this kind it's not the best and I'm in the hunt for the Westvleteren so it might go down another notch in the trappist war if there's any."
"Served in a Chimay chalice. Nice head that sticks around for a while. Deep red color. You can certainly tell that this is a fine example of a Trappist ale the moment you take your first sip. This is a beer to be savored. Not as complex as some in this style but still a nice flavor. Solid and good."
"The alcohol peeked through, but was not a factor and there were no spices apparent to me. A really good Dubbel and Belgian classic that I recommend based on its flavor and how damn easy it is to drink!"
"D: Very pleasant dubbel. Starting to delve more into this style."
"I could knock a few of these suckers back with great ease. This is a nice change of pace, as most dubbels run much more sweet than what Westmalle has put together. I can see myself coming back to this one in the fall."
"D. Drinkable. A good dubbel. Nice balance between malt and hops. I like dubbels a little more sweet, but this is good."
"D: Really a delicious and easy to drink beer. One of the better dubbels I've had in awhile."
"(D)- A wonderful Dubbel full of great flavors. Smooth and a fantastic drinker for anytime of the year. This is a dubbel I could see being in my fridge all the time; easily available and not overpriced for what you get. A great trappist beer."
"Looking on the back, I see two dates: 9/19/2007 and 9/19/2009. I'm guessing that these are the bottled-on and best-by dates? Not sure, but if that's the case then we're getting up on 10 months past its best date. It's still a damn good beer, though!"
"D: Unusually accessible and drinkable for a Trappist beer. Relatively light at 7% and quite pleasant. Not my favourite flavour-wise, but a solid choice and a beer I could drink lots of."
"After drinking almost nothing but american IPAs for the last year this was the perfect reminder why belgians were the ones who got me into craft beer."
"A very nice and subtle beer. Deserves the high rating I think."
"jd"
"Very nice. Just slightly mellower than fresh. Other than some oxidation, I don't feel like this beer has evolved all that much in 5 years. It is amazing beer to begin with, so I don't see much benefit it laying it down. I will say that even @ 5 years I feel like it could go at least several more."
"I got this beer on accident when I ordered the Tripple. It was a little disappointing, considering the A rating. Flavor is good, but not terribly complex. If you like the Bernardus, you might like this one, but there are better Belgian ales, in my opinion."
"D: Great beat, easy to dance to; I'd give it a ... oh, wait, wrong channel. This is a quintessence of a dubbel. Have one."
"D: One of Belgian classic, very good for dinner."
"The alcohol is nicely hidden but, the spiciness and the breadiness make me not want to drink more than a few ounces. I can think of a few dubbels I would rather drink instead."
"Notes: Best before 23/09/11. A very solid beer and good example of the style. Quite a bit of dark fruit, with a nice dark malt base. Very drinkable and an enjoyable flavor, but it just didn't really blow me away or really distinguish itself as a world class beer. It is certainly worth getting and a very good beer though, and I would happily drink it again."
"D- I split the small bottle with someone which left me wanting more of this. I liked it, but I was expecting something a bit more flavorful. Well balanced, though. I dropped the drinkability a bit because of the vinegar taste I detected, but I would probably try it again."
"If I wanted a Belgian that wasn't overly complicated then I'd go with this one. If I'm looking for more flavor I'll choose another style. This is a wonderful representation of the style, but I prefer that my taste buds get more of a work-out."
"All in all, very well crafted dubbel, and one of my favorites in the style. Looking forward to my next one."
"Overall: World class Belgian Dubbel. Somewhat different than others in the style and could possibly benefit from just a touch more complexity. In spite of that, it is supremely balanced and immensely drinkable. Would definitely buy again."
"D: Balanced. Easy to drink. I would have another."
"D: 100% drinkable, and for me, that's an interesting concept for a Belgian Ale. If these didn't cost so much here in FL, I'd consider buying this every week."
"A great Dubbel. Those Trappist monks are just brilliant."
"Bottle gives dark brown color with thick lasting off-white head. Nice aroma of dark fruits and yeast. Taste matches aroma with dark fruits, malts, yeast, spice - a bit sharper than I am used to with dubbels. Finish mildly bitter, thin mouthfeel. Overall just a step above OK."
"D: this is an excellent Belgian Dubbel, lots of fruity notes alone with characteristics similar to a dry red wine. Lots going on here while being greatly balanced. I may have to head back to the store and clear them out as this beer seems to age well."
"pours a a thick dark brown color with a 2 finger beige head that recedes slowly and leaves some nice clinging lacing on side of glass...the smell is plum, raisins, fig ,caramel , toffee and malts and some hops ..WOW this is a complex and flavorful dubbel it starts out sweet then some fruits like plum and fig come in then some bready malts and hops this is well balanced and very flavorful..the currant fruits with the malts and hops are just fantastic..it medium bodied and highly drinkable"
"Pricey, in fact very pricey, but definitely worth a try."
"Notes: I didn't really love the Tripel from Westmalle, but this is awesome"
"D: easy to drink 3 or 4 of these but you will be a tad tipsy at the end, at least I was."
"Fairly easy to drink overall, but the dryness makes me want to sip it slowly and enjoy the flavors, rather than knocking back a few."
"Pours a dense, milk-chocolate brown color with a thinner head than I expected for a Trappist. The dry, champagne sweet aroma doesn't seem to have much of the dark fruit character I'd expect from the style and actually gives a hint of the moderate alcohol content. The taste is much truer to style, with flavors of raisins, sweet (rather than tart) cherries, and a caramel sweetness. The effervescence that seems common among Trappist beers mutes some of the flavor, but at the same time invigorates the liquid, helping it slip over the tongue with a silky drinkability. Overall, not my favorite Dubbel, but it is still unique and interesting."
"D: I have tp admit, this brew isn't as gopd as some of the other Trappists. Even so, it is a brew that is made with a lot of care, and is very delicious. Definitely a must have."
"Drinkability - Overall its good but I guess its reputation precedes it. In my opinion this is not an exceptional beer."
"Luxurious crisp and sparkling moth feel, mid-bodied and sot."
"Westmalle Double pours a hazy medium brown with a light brown head. I smell sweet raisin as well as other dark and tropical fruit with hints of dark chocolate and caramel. There is a bit of a sweet, vinous character. Some light alcohol comes through, but it might be because I practically submerged my nose in the Westvleteren chalice. The flavor is heavenly with sweet esters upfront and leading into earthy, slightly vinous character. Some dry dark chocolate comes through along with some caramel leading into a dry, slightly bitter finish. Herbal hops with a bit of sharp alcohol and phenolic flavor linger after the beer is gone."
"Drinkability: This beer is pretty easy to drink, and the alcohol and malty sweetness is balanced by the dry finish. Quite refreshing and pleasant."
"Overall, Westmalle Dubbel is a good beer, with a surprisingly hoppy character to it. I guess it isn't much of a surprise when a trappist brewery puts out a good beer, but it is still very appreciated. Also, this beer drinks like something with half the ABV, and I cannot detect even a hint of the 7%ABV."
"D: It's relatively easy to drink and the alcohol is completely masked. The beer becomes easier to drink as it warms up."
"D: I wouldn't want more than 750 mL in a sitting."
"D: Watch out, 7%. I finished my small bottle and decided to take a long break!"
"D: Good beer, it's a little to much funk for me, but it's an interesting experience."
"Drinkability was also good. This is good for everything a trappist beer ought to be good for."
"D- Extremely drinkable. Full of flavor, but does not weigh you down."
"D- The metallic flavor was overwhelming and killed the drinkability of this beer... I did finish the glass, but did not want to order another one."
"D - Quite good. This has got to be one of the best dubbels I've had, and I think it is a little step above Chimay Red (but I'm probably being subjective). Very balanced beer: not too complicated, yet full-flavoured and interesting."
"One of those beers that I wanted to be more excited about but maybe I had my hopes set too high. Pours fine, looks fine, nice chocolate body with a rocky head. Smell is a touch muted, dried fruits and a hint of chocolate. Definitely higher in carbonation than I was expecting but overall a good beer. I think I was hoping for the best dubbel ever, which was probably too much to expect from any producer. Still, thoroughly enjoyed."
"All in all a delightful Trappist ale."
"Final Thoughts: This beer was far superior to their Tripel that is for certain, and if you are looking for a nice treat, this is worth a pickup. Pretty much everything I'd expect from a Trappist beer, well brewed but has it's own kind of simplicity."
"Drinkability- definitely high drinkable and I appreciate greatly about this beer is the fact they are able to make this a very nice flavorful dubbel while still maintaining its alcohol at 7 percent which is actually still manageable and doesnt knock you to hard like some can, the balance also also of dryness with sweetness to start make you really looking forward to your next sip, , If i had to say the overally most surprising part of this beer it would be its pronounced dryness, a very solid example of a trappist"
"Overall Impression: An authentic Dubbel brewed in Belgium. Outstanding beer!!! Let's just say it's a Famous Trappist Ale for a very good reason."
"drinkability - easy to drink, enjoyable"
"Drinkability: I could definitely drink this regularly. Great example Dubbel. It hides tha 7%abv really well."
"Pours a hazy, amber color. 1 1/3 inch head of a pale tan color. Good retention and good lacing. Smells of yeast, slight citrus (plum), slight hops, and sweet malt. Fits the style of a Dubbel. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp with an average carbonation level. Tastes of yeast, slight hop, slight sweet malt, slight grain, and slight citrus. Overall, a little more dry than I'm used too, but otherwise a good dubbel."
"this beer has a good amount of carbonation, you can detect a bit of the alcohol (it does check in at over 7%abv). Overall a good drinking beer, nice for a cool night indoors. I would def. revisit."
"Westmalle Dubbel is very well balanced as is most Belgian beers I've had, drinkability runs high and the moderate ABV level allows you to have two or three without fatiguing the tastebuds. Very well brewed for the style."
"note: i bought this from a import/organic food store in the us and it was very price like 12 bucks for a 11.2 oz a bottle there are other dubbels i would drink before this for that price but over a very good beer"
"D: easy to drink but the abv does sneak up on yea."
"Extremely drinkable. It's so smooth and creamy. A little on the sweet side, but it pulls it off."
"Drinkability: It's been well over two years since I've enjoyed a Westmalle, but as I was shopping at Whole Foods for Super Bowl food, I spotted this guy sitting there and decided to have one. Great idea as I can see this becoming a regular in my fridge. Such a great balanced beer."
"drinkability is good. nice balance. good complexity. i think i'd lean more toward the witkap-pater dubbel i had before this, but mainly because it's a little more fruity whereas this one leans more toward the spicy side. i tend to prefer my dark belgians to be fruity rather than spicy, but that's more of a personal taste and this one is certainly right in line for the style."
"D: A very good Dubbel. Rich in flavor, yet has the body to make it very palatable."
"It seems that the more I drink Belgian's, the more I fall in love with them, and this one keeps me going down the same path. In comparison to the Chimay Red I recently had, this interpretation seems musty with a greater emphasis being placed on the sour aspects of the beer. Still, the sourness is excellently balanced with the sweet candied/fruity notes of the beer, and that's one of the things that makes this brew so great."
"Cheers!"
"A rich brown in colour, and hazy with yeast held in suspension. Topped by well-retained beige head that leaves a pretty lace as it slowly subsides. Malty, fruity aroma vaguely reminiscent of banana bread. Theres plum and cherry to go with that banana, along with caramel and a hint of chocolate. Inititial dark bread flavour is overtaken by fruity notes of raisin, apple, and fig. Very ripe and jammy tasting. It finishes with a hit of warm alcohol and a musty bitterness. The flavour and aroma both get a bit boozier as the beer warms. Medium bodied with fine, tingling carbonation. Doesn't feel heavy while still feeling substantial. Easy drinking, flavourful, and subtle; I was left wanting more after finishing this fairly potent ale."
"Overall a very well-balanced beer that should please any Belgian beer fan."
"D: A nice Dubbel, worthy of the Trappist name. I wish there was a little more flavor and aroma, but overall a solid brew."
"O: Very drinkable. Very well done. Mandatory for Belgian lovers"
"d - this beer does not drink like a beer of 7.0 abv. but non the less when im finished i want another one."
"D: A planned on making a bit of a night of drinking, but I'm so happy here I'm going to stop now. Complex without being in your face, I have to say this deserves all the hype it might get. Alcohol content is low enough that I felt like I was in control throughout, unlike some balls-to-the-wall extreme brews that knock you back and drag you along."
"D: Lacks the overwhelming flavor that keeps you coming back, but still very enjoyable."
"Maybe I was let down after hearing such great things about this beer. It's a good, solid selection, but I didn't think it was one of the best beers I've had."
"Now the ABV is 6.5°"
"D: A flavor that grows on you throughout the brew with nuance more than any dominant flavor. Feel is amazing and this will taste even better in 2-3 years when I try the other bottle I picked up."
"D: Complex beer despite not being massive. Caramalized and standard sugars lightened the body while creating nice caramel and apple flavors."
"It's very smooth, even with the slight bit of extra carbonation. As with the nose there are similar flavors that come through. It's a bit crisp, the flavors don't linger as long as with others."
"D- A nice dubbel, great appearance and a nice mouthfeel, lacks a little in the taste department, but this is a very easy drinker for a dark beer."
"A full bodied beer that wad very smooth on the mouth. I am going to give it only 3.5 for drinkability as at 7% this is not an all night beer. One of the better Trappist beers I have tried."
"D - Easy drinking beer for the strength. Wish I would have bought more."
"Drink is good. A good Belgian beer with smooth malts and alot carbonation a must try."
"Appearance isn't spectacular although it is impressive, I was surprised the head formed little crater pockets, not used to that in Belgian beers. Has a brown, gold crimson color and a head the color of ripe dates. The nose wasn't as forthright as I'd originally anticipated but was still aromatic enough offering caramel sweet malt, white raisin, cocoa shavings and jammy fruits. Yeasty notes are evident in the smell and taste categories but it is subtle and lends character. Very impressed with the taste of this beer and the quality in the craftsmanship. Lots of dried and jammy fruits like apple jelly, fig newton insides, semi-dried dates, a sweet raisiny backing through into the finish which offers a light cocoa shot in the finish. Flavors linger awhile, mouthfeel is dry, silky smooth and creamy. Very drinkable, even though you savor every sip and enjoy the complexities, you will raise the glass often. Very good stuff. If it wasn't so pricey I would enjoy this frequently."
"poured into a westmalle goblet, about a finger of thick, cloudy foam, which did not disappear for minutes, creating a nice looking top to the ruby-brown color. smells of raisins or plums and caramely malts. tastes nutty, malty, a tinge of sweet and cocoa bitterness. mouthfeel is good, with the tickling of carbonation. i will definitely have this beer again."
"D - and exciting and challenging sipper, better suited for a warm summer night. looking forward to trying the tripel."
"D - Very refreshing and delicious. good co2."
"This is a very drinkable Trappist and I enjoyed it very much. Excellent head and lacing. Aroma reminded me of a warm summer day laying in a field of summer flowers. Fresh and pure and thanking God your alive. It has spirt and lets you know your not drinking some light beer of ordinary taste. It will awaking your tastebuds and make you feel like the warm sun is shinning on you. Can't say enough about it , just try it and see."
"On tap at La Morte Subite, Brussels. Long-lasting head, tan and bubbly and thick, floating leisurely atop a pool of mahogany beer with light traces of bubbles. Aroma of mushrooms, bread; plenty of malt up front in the taste and smoothness that satisfied. Some light flavors of chocolate and bread. Had the weight of a great dubbel. A must-have if you visit this bar."
"Overall, a solid example of the style, but not as aggressive as one might desire. It's a nice drinking beer but could be less tame. Still, a nice one to try if you haven't done so already."
"33cl Bottle from stystembolaget. Dark, murky brown with slight rosey tint. Big tan head that lasts til the end and laces the glass. Aroma is amazing - belgian yeast and tart fruit come rushing at you, followed by caramel and slight alcohol hanging back. Thick, full mouthfeel and medium carbonation coat your tongue. Flavor is sweet and malty, but bitterness perfectly controls things. more bitter in finish, but not out front. Hops become more pronounced as beer warms. One of my new favorite beers."
"So, Westmalle Dubbel has its faults, but its still a classic for the style. Actually, in some respects it defies the loose style guidelines and strays over to a class of beers that include Rochefort 8. Mind you, who cares about style that much? All you need to know is that this is a decent beer and worthy of your investment in it."
"D - Smooth, refreshing, a meal by itself, but overly sour at the end. By no means disappointing. There were more complex smells and flavors than I listed here, but the alcohol and fusil oils mask their true names."
"M&D: High alcohol limits the drinkability, but there is at least an attempt to hide the apparent booziness...Not the most sessionable, but easily worth having a few."
"Taste at first is bland...that lasts about a second. The flavors then pop when it hits the back of your tongue. Booze is again well hidden, with some dark fruit flavors...and slightly carbonated but very smooth."
"D- A very complex beer with a uniquely delicious, creamy yeast flavor that stands out stronger than the hop or malt flavors, while simultaneously contributing as the dominant factor that gives this brew a lot of personality. This drink, very literally, turns me on!"
"Muddy chestnut brown with medium tan head, good persistence and lacing. Sweet honey aroma with notes of raisins and dark fruit, well balanced. Full mouth with complex spiciness, malt and dates. Alcohol shows through more than most. Slightly bittersweet finish."
"Taste leans toward the fruity end of the spectrum with lots of strawberries, bing cherries and blackberries. Malts are light and airy with some burnt toast and caramel flavors...really not very sweet at all. Minor complaint is that it is not very creamy and even feels a bit thin. This one goes down way too easy though, the alcohol is barely even detectable. It's like a Belgian session beer! Very Good."
"D: A damned-nice dubbel... wish I had access to it here."
"D: absolutely amazing, but strong, definitely a keeper, worth the trouble to find"
"D - Smooth, flavorful without being precocious, a hard beer to surpass."
"Pours a dark reddish brown. Way too carbonated, head was just everywhere it seemed. Once that settled, its not a bad tasting beer actually. Tastes of dark fruits and its not that sweet at all. I would consider this again if in a pinch, but not in a rush to go after it. Very easy to drink, don't notice the 7% at all. Not a bad beer."
"The beer itself is actually a LOT less sweet than I expected it to be. It remains quite interesting, because that lack of sweetness let other usually hidden aromas developp. The beer is very grassy, earthy and dry. Hops are also quite present. Even if interesting, this is not my type of double. Still, very good brew."
"D = Terrific stuff, fast becoming one of my favourites of the Trappists. Will definitely sample this one again!"
"Poured into a brandy snifter. Dark mahogany brown, with three fingers of tan head, and fantastic lacing. Raisin, brown sugar, molasses, date, caramel apple, limejuice, and slight yeastiness all massage the nostrils, with very little trace of alcohol. The flavor yielded all of the above, as well as toasted toffee and caramel, which dissolved to herbal hints and then a bittersweet raisin finish. Bitter afterwards. Mouthfeel was spritzy, with a nice medium silkiness and alcohol well-hidden throughout. This went down too easy. Wow."
"Drinkability: This is definitely drinkable but also quite subtle so it would be easy to hurry this one and miss out on some of the complexity here. I could easily finish off a second one and I do expect to sample this one again one day."
"This is a nice brew. Not truly sipper without the robust body, not truly sessionable due to alcohol presence, in the middle somewhere. Have a couple to age, see how that goes."
"Drinkability- quite drinkable. Would have no problem having a fridge full."
"Drinkability - not sure. I hear so much about Trappist ales that people rave about but maybe I'm missing it due to the wrong glass. It was good, just not ""WOW!"" good. However, I will say it went really well with the Quiche Lorianne I had with dinner so I'll give a little bit higher on drinkability as a special occasion beer for special occasion meals."
"This is a very nice dubbel. Interestingly, I enjoyed the St. Paul more, but that was a while ago. I suppose I'll just have to try them both again to make sure. ;)"
"Seek. Drink. Enjoy. Repeat as necessary."
"D - The drinkability of this beer is subject to whether or not you like the style of the beer, and I love most Belgian styles, and this one is a good representation of this style"
"Definitely a worthy trappist dubbel for sure."
"D - pretty good dubbel - very good nose and mouthfeel and a solid taste. I don't know if I would reach for this one often due to its price tag, but I definitely never turn one down."
"sweet, spicy, cola, breadcrusty. with a nutty finish. some vinous character dovetails with the spice and cola. hop flavors evince themselves. i wish the mouthfeel were just barely more substantial, as i could use something else to hold onto--this might be quite the complex brew if flavors had something more robust as a spine. interestingly, the malt characters and spice seem almost yeast-independent; as the yeast contribution is quite nominal and well below the level expected of a belgian dubbel. flavors aside, not a yeasty brew"
"Drink: Decent flavor, though the bitter aftertaste carries a bit of alcohol. Very drinkable nonetheless. I literally drank the whole bottle trying to pin down the flavors, hence the sparse description."
"World class mouthfeel. Thick and silky with a medium body. Velvety smoothness characteristic of only a handful of the best Belgians. Clean finish keeps me wanting to drink more."
"Drinkability is HIGH HIGH HIGH"
"D - One of the best dubbels available in my opinion. It is a rightfully world renowned beer, and when you try it, you see why."
"Good if not simple flavors combined with lighter makes this beer quite drinkable for the style."
"D: Metallic flavor makes it a bit tough to put down, but the flavor and body are both on the lighter side."
"D-Very drinkable even for non-belgium lovers. Smooth feel with complex flavors. Maybe my favorite dubbel yet."
"Yummy."
"D: Even though this is not my favorite Trappist brew, it is still worth buying. If they could somehow balance the ABV with more taste and add a thicker head, they would be golden. Give it a shot, it's worth adding to your collection."
"Pretty spot-on, I suppose, but not nearly as heady as one might have been expecting, the beefed up malt just a little too lacking, and weirdly so. An otherwise agreeable tipple, even more so when we New Worlders bring our lofty expectations back down to earth."
"Overall, this is one of the most balanced, tasty beers I've had the pleasure to enjoy. It's definitely one of my favorite dubbels, and one I'd recommend to anyone looking for a nice beer to sip slowly on a quiet evening."
"33cl bottle poured into a Westmalle Trappist glass. Pours dark brown with ample tan frothy head. Beautiful yummy looking beer. Smells malty and sweet. Flavour is like nuts or raisins, kind of sweet and bitter. Palate is smooth with light carbonation. Doesn't taste as alcoholic as a lot of Belgian dubbels... especially for a Trappist. Very drinkable beer."
"It tastes ok, but I like this one less than the Dubblel but better than the quad. Which is very strange because this is the opposite of the way I like the other Trappistes. Overall a very so-so beer."
"Bottle. Pours a cloudy brown with a thick light tan head. Aroma of sweet malt, sweet fruits (applesauce and fig), some cola-like notes. Flavor of bitter hops initially with lots of malt and sweet fruits, even some soda-like notes. Hmm, not what I expected from the #2 dubbel in the world. The flavor is bland and the palate a touch heavy. I would have liked more fruity notes or spices....oh well."
"Overall, this brew was a bit bitterer than I expected. It's decently well rounded with no dominant flavor to overpower the whole beer."
"D: This must be one of the best beers ever. I'm thinking about joining the monastery that produces such a fantastic beer ;-). This one you must try."
"Had this earlier tonight while watching poker. Poured a medium brown with cinnamon head that faded somewhat quick and left decent lacing. Smelled of bready yeast and fruit. Tasted pretty much the same. Slightly overcarbed, but smooth. Could drink a few."
"Drinkability- Decent, but not the best dubble I've had."
"I must say, I expected more depth out of this one. Alot more on the dry side than expected. Shows some caramel and dark fruit sweetness, but that immediately turns to a dry and coarse stone fruit pit bitter bite that was strangely appropriate but not all that pleasant. The yeast and tasted bread are there as well, but the dry fruit flavor and alcohol edge dominate. You can tell this is well crafted, and damn good thing, because it hinges upon becoming a mess. Decent body and carbonation help clean the palate. Overall, a drier than expected drinker. I liked this less than the hype, but still dug it. Worth a try as you work your way through thee vast sea of Belgian beers, but this one will be a matter of personal taste and preference."
"D - I would only have 1 or 2. Not really a session beer despite it's reasonable ABV."
"These Trappists are growing on me!"
"I will definitely give this one another chance, but as for my first look I was anything but impressed. Hopefully round two brings me a bottle with no added contaminants."
"Overall, a gem of a beer and I expect nothing less from the Trappists"
"D - Nice beer."
"A fantastic beer like all Trappist ales."
"D: I'm not that much into dubbels, but this is definitely one of the better ones. Good for anyone jonesing for the fruity esters of a Belgian dark ale but not really in the mood for the knockout blow of a quad."
"Also used it for cooking in stew pastasauce. Nice"
"Too much carbonation detracts from flavour! Otherwise quite enjoyable!"
"Drinkability? It's an enjoyable session with the 1 bottle but now that I can buy it here in Casper, I'll be revisiting it often. A solid Belgian Dubbel."
"Smells kinda standard. Estery belgian nose. But the tasts is amazing, like roasted figs with dates and raisens. Some dark toffee flavors in there as well. Still get some of that yeasty ester flavor that turns me off from belgians, but still damn good. Really glad i drink this one."
"Quite a good beer, which I'll likely have again in the future, but I didn't enjoy it as much as Westmalle's tripel."
"The taste was a smooth malt with a apple bitterness that hit you right away. It was pretty dry with a wet finish on the lips. It was a tad hit hot alcohol wise and it really shouldn't have been with a 7% abv. Overall I thought it was average and maybe this was a poor batch."
"Taste follows with some dark cherry and plum. The carbonation on the swallows purges the tongue briefly, then there is a brief return of chocolate, hazelnut and plum. Carbonation is a bit high on the mouthfeel until the beer settles down. Flavor, like the smell, improves with some exposure. But then a few more minutes and the carbonation is a bit too low. Side by side with Chimay Red, it looks better, but it ain't really about the looks(in this case!)."
"Overall, a disappointment."
"Nice drinkability on this one."
"D - Not horrible but nothing I'll be racing back to."
"I'll try this again to see if I like it better, obviously many do, but this just didn't do it for me. Not that it was bad, I just expected much more."
"Overall - Dubbels are usually excellent and hard to fault, but I didn't enjoy this quite as much as I hoped."
"An excellent dubbel."
"D: Don't know how I ever went this long without trying this gem before. Light and crisp though it reminds you of its size in a beginning warmth and finish. An excellent beer from one of my favorite beer makers of all time."
"Drinkability: A tad too anonymous - for a trappist - but satisfyingly delivering in all the sensory inputs , yet I cannot stop to wish to expect more!"
"A subtley exceptional brew. Each sip reveals a new shade to enjoy. The ease with which you go through the glass is scary."
"poured into a pint glass. appears an opaque molasses brown, with tan head and better retention than expected. smells of clove, chocolate, dark sweet fruits and roasted malts. taste is great. not too heavy on the yeast bitterness, not too much carbonation, has chocolatey and banana flavors going on. alcohol barely noticeable. finishes sweet and medicinal, with a tingling clove taste at the end. very creamy for a dubbel, feels very full in the mouth, and again carbonation levels spot on. the drinkability on this one is through the roof. very smooth. the flavors combine extremely well and it goes down like a knife through butter. excellent trappist dubbel."
"Drinkabilty: Very drinkable at 7% but I was ready to move on to something else when I finished the bottle. While I enjoyed I think I'll stick to the Tripel when I drink Westmalle and look to other options for my Trappist Dubbels."
"I love this beer it's has become may favorite dubbel."
"D - Drinkable. Even with the 7% it's a good drinker."
"Drinkability is obviously high on this one, this is one of the better Belgian Dubs out there. SLAINTE."
"D - Has a little punch at 7% but you could drink quite a few of these without it becoming overwhelming."
"Smells of dark fruits, sweetness and a bit of alcohol. The taste is deliciously sweet and malty. A bit of alcohol, spiciness and dark fruits round out the flavor. The carbonation is pleasant and the finish is a tiny bit dry. I wish I had a second bottle."
"I poured from a 330 ml bottle into my SA pint glass. What a pretty beer, deep caramel in color with a big fluffy, white head that stays around forever. The aroma is heavy on dark fruit notes-plums and raisins. The flavor follows, and is slightly sweet. The beer is medium bodied, well carbonated and goes down smmooth."
"D: This is an exceptionally drinkable beer. In fact, it's likely in the top three that I've every had the pleasure of trying. Very recommended!"
"OVERALL: I've had plenty of Belgian dubbels, and this is one of the best ones out there. A great example of the dubbel style. Very enjoyable and drinkable; something I would definitely get again and would recommend picking up."
"D- A decent beer but it is just an average example of the style."
"11.2 oz bottle poured into a goblet. Opaque brownish copper color with a light tan head that leaves fine Belgian lacing. Aroma is hearty with sweet bready malts, heaps of fleshy fruit, raisins, and peppery alcohol. Flavor contains a toffee maltiness as a basis for all the light and dark fruits and spices to accent. Medium-full body with very fine carbonation. At first it's overcarbonated but with a little time it settles down. A very good dubbel."
"I get a lot of sweet malts backed by belgian sugars, mingling with some darker sensations, like some burnt sugar, licorice. Very yeasty, and the darker sensations give it a bit of a kick. I don't get any of the bubblegum sweetness in the background, no raspberry, none of the fruitiness I'm used to from other dubbles. Seems to be medium bodied, lighter than I would have thought, a lot less dense. Very creamy, and decently coating. I think for me though, it doesn't have that earthy fruitiness I like, the darker flavors come through too strongly. Not dark fruit, but licorice is a good way, or a burnt roastiness you might find more in a stout. Has a slight bitterness to the finish, maybe alcohol burn, maybe roastiness. Not my first trappist, and most likely not my favorite. Still good to try though."
"D: Pretty easy to put down, but hey, drinking in public is always easier, right? Although it's middle of the road ABV-wise, I'm sure I could put a couple of these down in a sitting."
"I like the Tripel more but great beer from Westmalle here."
"4 M&4 D: pretty soft on the palate, though the taste always comes with a faintly touch of alcohol. Overall this is a medium-textured ale with semi-rich flavour and little unwanted sugary and sticky aftertaste. Very easy to drink, though I think the complexity of the flavour is not as great as the nose. A solid brew all the same."
"Conclusion: Black beer with a fluffy, tan head. Raisins, plums and estery yeast aromas are prominent in the nose. Fruity, berry-like flavor with a nice balance of sweet and sour. Would go great with fruit salad, dates or raisins, meat dishes served with berry jelly or just as an aperitif. All in all - a good beer"
"I would definitely seek this beer out again, and preferred it to the Westmalle Tripel by a mile. I don't think it is the absolutely best dubbel I have ever had, but it is definitely one of the 2 or 3 best. Highly recommended for the style, and really any beer drinker in general that likes a nicely balanced beer, that tends toward the sweet malts as opposed to bitterness."
"Poured a turbid reddish/brown color with a huge tan/brown head. Aroma was full of sweet malt, something like sugarcane, with yeast and cherry present as well. Taste is a bready malt, sweetened with flavors of cherry and raspberry. Alcohol is slightly noticeable on the finish with little to no aftertaste. Carbonation is high, tickling the tongue, with a full-medium body. I would like to have another, and could handle it at 7% ABV, but can't afford it at $6-7/bottle."
"Alcohol was masked well. I really enjoyed this brew very much and would keep an eye out for another aged bottle."
"D - Very drinkable even though it's not my favorite of its style"
"D = Pretty drinkable. Alcohol is nowhere to be found."
"I could drink a couple pints of this in a night if I was determined, but I'd prefer not to."
"I thought this was a good beer and glad I finally got to try it. I will definately say this is drinkable."
"D,i can drink this often and i do when ever i can get my hands on it,nothing here you would get tired of ."
"A well crafted beer, but not my favorite trappist. Too malty for a dubbel in my opinion, and not interesting or complex enough."
"This is one of the world's great beers. The taste is marvelous and at 7% ABV, one can afford a few."
"Bottle from Chester Beer distributor. Pours a dark murky almost purple color. Two finger head, retention is not that good but excellent lacing. Peppery aroma. Somewhat sweet tasting with sharp notes, not sure how to describe again a taste of pepper. Smooth finish. Syrupy mouthfeel."
"Regardless of whatever level of appreciation I had for beer, the Westmalle Dubbel (and Tripel for that matter) has always impressed me. Before I could even understand why it was I liked it, I've always appreciated it for its wonderful appearance, rich flavour and delectable drinkability. Sure enough, the more beers I try the more I appreciate it - Westmalle Dubbel is a beer I'd recommend to everyone."
"Drinkability: The fruit character in this one is just amazing, great balance between sweetness and tartness - very refreshing. Truly complex and well balanced. Perhaps, I would have liked just a little more bite in the finish."
"Drinkability - I have to say that I was expecting a little more, especially for the price tag. I will try again, this time controlling the experiment by chilling the beer a little bit more. Hopefully this changes its character a little bit."
"Yes! I finally got the chance to try this amazing beer and it was everything I wanted it to be and more. I really wondered if it would live up to the hype but I found it to surpass what I was expecting. I think a glass of this every week would do a body good."
"D - A very good beer indeed."
"Westmalle Dubbel is a cloudy, dim, dark brown ale with a dense, blotchy, beige head that has excellent retention and lacing. It has a fruity aroma, with notes of apple, raisin, banana and clove. It is medium-light bodied; bubbly, with a dry, slightly gritty finish, almost like it was dry hopped. It is a simple flavor that's pretty well bittered. It's a bit sour and a touch sweet, with notes of leather, pepper, hay, juniper and brett. OK, maybe it's not all that simple, but the flavors are very fused. This is a pretty solid Dubbel."
"Mouthfeel is crisp, lightly scrubbing, with a fluffy mouthfeel and medium body."
"Drinkability- normally when I do these reviews, I finish about a quarter of my beer, then go enjoy the rest away from the computer. The Westmalle is already half way gone. It isn't an every-day beer, at least for me, but it is very enjoyable, and I am already looking forward to my next one before this one is done."
"Drinkable. One that I could easily session during a cold winter night like tonight. Warming, hearty, tasty. A winner."
"D: As far as dubbels go, it goes down almost too easily."
"Drinkability: A great representation for the style. I was a little underwhelmed by the taste, but all things considered I could (and would) have another one or two of these."
"A very fine beer, I'm not sure it's going to make my top 10, but it will be close."
"D - very good beer that is very easy drinking for a moderately high ABV"
"Comes out of the bottle a dark, hazy, chocolaty brown with a fairly thick beige head. (Be careful - it foams like all-get-out!) Strong aroma has a fruity overtone and an appreciable malty component with hints of caramel. Satisfying flavor is malty with a strong apple/pear tone and hints of caramel and smoke, and a hoppy undertone. Finish is subtly bitter and has a touch of sweetness. Smooth texture helps it slide down the pipes pleasantly."
"Again, just let it warm a little to get the max enjoyment. Very good beer!"
"Very good beer. I have to say both the Dubbel and the Tripel exceeded my already lofty expectations. I will definitely be returning to Surdyk's before the sale is over to pick up more."
"http://foodbeertravel.wordpress.com/2009/01/10/westmalle-dubbel/"
"This is a standout beer that is one of my top six for style."
"D - Deeply rich and complex brew... The bar is set high for Trappist creations and this one meets the expectations... This beer absolutely improves as it warms..."
"Drinkability: Because of the great mouthfeel and nicely balanced taste (not too mild, not too bitter, fun complexity and lots of flavour) I find this beer quite drinkable, and would drink it again! The 7% ABV is masked quite well also."
"This beer pours a cloudy brown color. The head is one inch in height, and recedes slowly into a firm quarter inch cap of firm foam. Lacing is thorough. The aroma is of anise, bubblegum, figs, and dates. The taste is full of soft anise, figs, and bubblegum. The mouthfeel is medium-full bodied with lively carbonation. Overall, this is awonderful beer. I will surely drink this again."
"Drinkability - I'm enjoying this beer and could easily have another but I'm not sure if I will go out of my way to pick up more supplies..."
"A great Dubbel, but it kinda lacks that wow factor."
"Mouthfeel was also very nice, very velvety and easy to drink. Overall, I could drink this all night, but at 7% ABV, that's probably not smart. Goes well with simple fare -- had mine with mild cheese and a spicy mustard, which was perfect. Great after dinner too, I'd bet."
"D: Highly recommended. Flavors and body are just right on this one, and it may rival my favorite dubbel."
"it's ok, but not my favorite by far. i'm finding westmalle's offerings to be more phenolic than i'm comfortable with."
"MF&D - I could drink this all night long, if I wouldnt become atrociously huge, that is. the feel is perfect in my world: there is ample carbonation, while the viscosity is thick enought to make the carbonation just right. however, in my opninion for the dubbel, the mf and the d can rarely be paired up exactly, for they conflict. the dubbel requires a thick bubbly beer, which makes it harder to have in larger quantities (which is how I guage drinkability: : ""could I have this all night long?""). either way this is a great beer that would take a lifetime to get bored with."
"Notes: Quite an enjoyable Belgian ale overall. Probably the best Dubbel I have ever had."
"Pours a dark brown/black colored body, with a medium sized tan head, that is lasting. Has an aroma of some malts, molasses, perfume, and flowers. A taste of malts, perfume, and alcohol. An aftertaste of perfume & alcohol. Very Belgiany."
"This is highly drinkable."
"750 mL bottle. Dark brown-maroon color with a nice frothy off-white head that stays throughout the life of the pour. Great lacing. Aroma of raisins, plum and malt. Mouthfeel is slightly thin and watered down. Taste of malt, caramel, yeast and plum with a great velvety finish."
"Pours a dark brown, slightly plum-like color with a huge foamy beige head. Aroma is malty with hints of chocolate, caramel, sugar cane, dark fruit and alcohol. Hoppy up front with a good amount of carbonation, chocolate maltiness, candi sugar and figs with a slightly sour and bitter hop finish."
"D: The taste is light enough to make this very drinkable, however, it's more carbonated than my personal preference and that makes it a one-glasser for me."
"D: By style on of the best ive had and simply amazing. A must try coming highly recommended."
"Average body."
"A beer I always have when in Belgium, often on tap, it is a delight and one of my all time favorite beers."
"D- Sooo drinkable. The price is the limit on this beer"
"A nice belgian, not my favorite, but worth a try."
"Taste: The taste is much like the smell. Some ripe banana flavor.I love how well the alcohol is hidden in the Westmalle ales."
" I like this stuff and from what I have read it is a good example of the style. I would certainly drink another."
"Nice example of the style. I also love how I can get this for $25 a case in Belgain grocery stores. Dark brown with a nice tan head. The nose has sweet malts and powerfull Belgian yeasts. Taste is well balanced. Medium body suits the style well. Great deal in Belgium over priced in the US."
"This is a nice brew but I think it will do better with some time in the cellar. Ill review in a year."
"Overall a decent beer but not what I thought I was going to get from this beer."
"Purchased one week ago, bottle has a buy by date of 4/4/09. Poured from an 11.2 oz bottle at approximately 50-55 degrees F. into a pint glass. Coloring was a very pretty dark reddish brown, very very little head and what little there was dissipated quickly, consequently very little lacing. Quite a lot of carbonation, lots of small bubbles racing rapidly toward the surface. Nice malty aroma and I was eagerly anticipating a full body/heavy ale. Good initial malt flavor but the mouth feel was not at all what I'd been expecting from it's aroma. Fairly thin/light mouth feel, somewhat dry finish with a faint sweetness remaining on the center of my tongue, possibly a very faint citrus note. All in all it's flavor was good, it is a drinkable enough ale just not as heavy as I like and definitely not something I'd likely pay as much for as I did this time."
"So hard to review these classic beers... not that I'm complaining."
"Bottle poured into chalice. Nice dar red mohogany - huge head considering it was poured into a chalice. Smell malt and fruit - faint. Taste was similar - I would not consider the flavor to be strong though - very nice - not overpowering - clean finish. Mouthfeel good body well carbed. This won't overpower you - I can see drinking two or three of these easily. It is what it is, I don't necessarily think its worth the price though - based on this site - I guess my expectations were a little high."
"I would highly recommend this beer. I had it along with a croque monsieur and some frites at a Brussels restaurant called La Trappiste."
"Westmalle's dubbel goes down fast though for a such a strong beer. And in it's native glass, finishing a few in a sitting is not out of the question."
"Westmalle's Dubbel is simply magnificent. The crisp, medium-bodied drink is, dee-licious, zestily carbonated and highly quaffable."
"D- Awesome! Could have a couple in a sitting."
"Damn good beer, I suggest picking this one up if it is available to you."
"Notes: This was the last in a large group of bottles that I picked up at McNalty's Bier Markt in Cleveland, Ohio a while back. Since then I have found many of those same beers on sale in local stores and some at lower prices. The Bier Markt is awesome for having so many of these available (whatever the price!) every day."
"Velvety smooth"
"D: not sure what to make of this so I'll just rate it good. It didn't suck but I'm not sure I'd buy a case."
"This beer is fairly drinkable at 7% ABV but not so drinkable considering the $4.50 for an 11oz bottle. Oh well still cheaper than Abt 12. I did like it, but I've had better within the same style. This is definately better than Orval but not as good as Chimay Grande Reserve."
"D: great dubbel...as with almost all trappist beers, give it a shot and you won't be disappointed."
"Pours nice dark brown colour with big tan head. Smell - roasted malts, nuts, chocolate and a hint of alcohol. Taste is unbelievable. So rich, chocolaty, but overhelming, not too sweet, not too bitter, perfectly balanced. Medium body, very smooth, perfect carbonation level, alcohol is so hidden in that beer. It's very drinkable. I mean very. It my first dubbel, and I'm very surprised how drinkable beer can be at 7 abv."
"One of the classic Dubbels. Fantastic dry drink."
"A dark cherry brown brew with a good helping of tan head completing the pour and rising to the rim of the goblet. Head recedes at a quick pace and leaves very little lacing behind. Some scattered chunks of sediment float throughout. Aromas of chocolate, coffee, cherries, booze and roasted malts linger. Tastes thick with a burgundy booziness up front. Behind that theres some dark fruits, malts, yeast and spice. Mouth-feel is medium bodied and open with plenty of carbonation. I find it drinkable, although not as smooth as could be due to a certain crispness present, but this is entirely a personal preference."
"Review from tasting notes. Dark amber brown, massive amount of foam, nice lacing. Aroma of chocolate covered nuts and rum soaked fruit. Floral. Flavor of dark fruit - raisins, plums, plus hints of dark chocolate. Slightest hint of sugary rum and candy sugar. Creamy, ample carbonation, dry yeast finish. Absolutely delicious."
"D.I enjoyed the whole glass and could drink the rest of the bottle but was glad to split with a friend."
"D: Highly drinkable."
"HV"
"nice full mouthfeel and very nice beer to drink."
"Good head, fairly dark, in appearance not that spectacular but good. Smell was exceptional. Taste was nothing else I have tasted, smooth but complex. Nothing short of incredible, worth the wait. I would give up sex to drink this beer."
"Amazing the flavor that is packed into a dubbel and at this alcohol level. Definitely one that needs and urges you to seek it out. This has the complexity of a terrific triple or even quad."
"D - Great for a dubbel, hiides its alcohol content very well."
"Pours a dark brown color topped with a nice thick foamy tanish head. Aroma is nice and fresh consisting of dark fruits, yeast and a touch of wine. The mouthfeel is creamy, slightly tart and relatively full and rich. The flavor here is some sugary dark fruits with yeast and a touch of roasted malts. Not crazy flavorful but they all blend together quite nicely. The finish is somewhat mellow and clean. This beer is extremely smooth and easy drinking. Another excellent one from the Monks."
"Overall it's a classic Dubbel...give it a shot if you haven't already."
"Drink ability= I like this beer a lot, but I'm kind of a Trappist groupie."
"Overall: decent stuff for sure but not my true calling."
"What is it with monks and beer? I am yet to taste a trappiste brew that is anything below excellent, and this beer is certainly no exception. At 7%ABV it has as much complexity as some BSDAs and Quads, and is substantially cheaper at the same time. Worth seeking out - this is a special beer."
"I've been looking for this for a long time, and finally found it. It poured a muddy dark mahogany with lots of tan head. It smelled like very potent but light yeast, balanced with bitter chocolate malt. It tasted like citrus hops and tons of yeast mixed with earthy semi-sweet chocolate malt. It was slightly thick with some carbonation, and had a lasting yeasty aftertaste. Overall this had a fairly intricate flavor, but wasn't as clean or delicious as I hoped."
"A good mix of clove and pepper in there, as the spices are noticeable on the edges but do not overpower the malts/fruits or wreck the tastebuds. Nice dryness on the backbite as it has a warming sensation to boot. Just a solid Trappist Ale and any real beer drinker has already tried this, so no need for me to recommend it."
"D: I could drink a few and it would take me along time as its a very good beer to savor."
"D - Overall one of the best beers to look at but not to taste. This seems to be an average dubbel as I have had some that were both more complex and tastier. A little more age may due well for this beer to calm down some of the alcohol, but who knows. Overall, it is easy to drink but in terms of a dubbel I'd much rather have a Pere Jacques or Chimay Red. I have to say they blew me away with their tripel but the dubbel not so much."
"Pretty good."
"I poured the beer into a chalice. A very nice head, color like honey. However, I could only smell cherries. No malt, no hops. The beer had a light body, no caramel, but a nice cherry taste with a little of hop bitterness. The beer went down nice and smooth and I didn't notice the alcohol. While I liked the beer, this wasn't my favorite of the Trappist dubbels. The flavoring that I look for when I drink a dubbel just wasn't there."
"D-Smells great, tasty, well hidden ABV, not a session brew for sure but highly drinkable"
"Drinkability: Excellent. I usually don't like Belgian dubbles but this is VERY nice"
"D: A tasty beer, but I think the tripel is much better, especially with the price. The standard bearer for this style, a well made ale for sure, any Trappist fan should try it out."
"I thought that this was pretty good, but not really exceptional. Certainly not as good as the Gulden Draak that I tried earlier."
"d: a good grainy dubbel; i think that this beer may have been a little misstored because i have had it before and remember it having a lot more fruity flavors"
"I'm in trouble."
"Overall: very complex and spicy dubbel. Pleasant and highly recommended."
"Mouthfeel is a bit thin, moderate carbonation, but manages to finish bubbly and tingly. Very drinkable, really good beer."
"Overall it's another great Belgian Trappist beer."
"D-I wouldn't complain if someone bought me one of these but I much prefer the Westmalle Trippel"
"So far, so good with Westmalle. Both their Dubbel and the Tripel I had two nights ago have been top shelf beers. These monks know their craft exceptionally well."
"Well balanced and at 7%, it's an easy go."
"Drinkability is okay as well. Not as good as I expected out of this beer. The taste is fairly bland and the mouthfeel is one of the oddest I have ever felt."
"Poured into a chalice from a bottle. The beer pours a slightly hazy dark ruby, forming a 1/2 inch tan head with slight lacing. The aroma is a combination of dark fruit aromas, along with some sugar sweetness and a noticeable amount of alcohol. The taste starts with light sweet maltiness leading into dark fruit flavors and ending with a slight alcohol presence. Nice smooth mouthfeel. Full flavor, medium body, and not too high alcohol lead to a very drinkable dubble. Overall, not bad at all. I can see why this gets such great reviews. I'm not sure if this is the best dubble I've had, but its definitly near the top."
"The original dubbel. Or, rather, from the maker of the original dubbel, so you have to assume it was probably pretty close, recipe-wise, to the original dubbel. One of the best dubbels, too - nothing bad here, and some of it is plain outstanding. Recommended."
"I'd seek this dubbel out again. Very nice. A good way to end the night."
"again, a beer to be savoured."
"Drinkability is high and I could suck back a fee of these no problem in one sitting."
"D: Some have said this doesn't lend well to drinkability, but given this was from a 9.4fl oz bottle, it only gets better after each drink. There's just over 2 glasses worth (american pints) in this bottle and this is a great beer. It goes down very smooth. Not as smooth as a stout or porter but given it's level of carbonation, and the nice balance of malty sweetness it is dead on. I would not hesitate to buy this again. I will definitely be exploring this style further."
"That's a nice dark ruby brown with orange hues the beer appears as. It has a pleasing aroma of assorted dark fruits with a little bit of cocoa. The taste, while not in your face, is very mellow and refreshing. Tastes just like the aroma, then add in a little bit of esters and pinch of peppery yeast. Very nicely balanced with the alcohol in disguise. Yep, another quality Trappist beer."
"D - Incredibly easy to drink. The taste/mouthfeel make up for the muted smell."
"The mouthfeel is very smooth but carbonated almost like a champagne. I would definitely have another."
"Dark fruits and sweet molasses bring out the flavor, along with a hint of Belgian spices and red wine. It is a dubbel, to be sure, and is sufficiently complex and fulfilling. I didn't get that special feeling like I have with some other trappists, but that doesn't make this any less of a solid, enjoyable beer."
"Damn good Dubbel!"
"Remarkable quality..seems to ooze gentility and patience. Get after it."
"Pours dark with some red highlights and a puffy tan head that leaves lots of thick even lacing.The smell is tangy with red wine aromas.Tastes of malts,over ripened dark fruits and a hint of watered down prune,spices(cinnamon),the yeast was not as dominant as I had expected,I was very pleased with the abundance and subtlety of flavors.The body and mouthfeel are soft and frothy.A stellar Dubbel!"
"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass. Pours a deep, ruby red with a lot of carbonation. Some lacing but not a whole lot. Smells like brown sugar and dried fruit. Tastes very sweet and malty and finishes very dry. Due to the relatively low ABV, this beer is very drinkable. A very satisfying beer that I will definitely have to pick up more in the future."
"The taste is first sweet and malty, with spicey fruit and toast with smooth, warming alcohol - rather like amn English barleywine. It becomes more bitter with spiciness with more caramel, prunes and cherries, balancing the sweetness. Although rich and complex, it is unusually smooth and easy to drink."
"d - i've heard that this is an excellent example of a dubble. i greatly enjoyed it and could drink this anytime."
"I liked it, but I can't see having more than 2 in a sitting."
"Poured a light brown with a reddish hue and a small creamy head with nice lacing. Strong aroma of liquid yeast and fruit, cherry?. A sour fruit and caramel flavor up front with a smooth hoppy finish. Well carbonated, cleanses the mouth, would pair great with cheese. Easy drinking beer."
"I enjoyed this beer and found it drinkable. It's not quite up to the same level as some other Trappist beers, but it's pretty easy to find and not as expensive as some of those either. This one is certainly worth a try."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, good kick, good representation of style, this is a beer that will hold your interest and your taste buds for a long time making it a good beer to drink for an evening."
"Overall, this was a really enjoyable beer, and something I'd drink again. I could have used a little more kick in the taste, but I also enjoyed the slightly muted flavors where nothing was overpowering. Again, appearance and particularly mouthfeel really were nice."
"Not my favorite dubbel, but still a very good Belgian."
"This is a wonderful dubbel that pours dark chocolate brown. The body is dark and hazy. The head is off white thick and bubbly, that makes for good lacing. Aromatic roasted malts and classic Belgian yeast fills the nose. Also there were light unripe or green banana and caramel notes. It tastes as good as it smells, malty and sweet, with hops being very low key. Molasses and malts, banana and caramel blend together to round out this smooth and silky ale. The body is full with soft carbonation and finishes dry, slightly bitter."
"D- Great brew. This one was an excellent dubbel and goes highly reccommended."
"D: A good, versatile beer to have on it's own or paired with food. Personally I like it on it's own to savor and enjoy. One is very nice, but I would save more for another time."
"I really liked this beer and I look for it and buy a few bottles for special occasions / events."
"This is a good sipping brew. Like a red wine it tastes like it will pair well with fine cheeses and a meat dish. Its also good to enjoy slowly and savor by itself."
"And that leads to drinkability. Again, for a 7% abv beer, this is almost entirely too drinkable. I'm a bit upset I only bought the single because I can't wait to have another one and to let my friends try this as well. The monks are certainly doing something right, one of the better beers I've had in a long time."
"A nice sipper that really opens up as it warms. Very easy drinking."
" This one feels a bit ""green"" and adds a bit too much bitter earthy notes. I still dig this style."
"This is a really great beer. The alcohol isn't all that noticable except for the warm feeling it leaves in your belly. A great winter sipper and a perfect example of the style. Not nearly as sweet as the St. Bernardus Prior 8."
"D - This is a very easy to drink Belgain I greatly enjoyed this brew worth trying"
"D&N: Pretty drinkable for a beer, but I think this is a one at a time beer to be appreciated. Very enjoyable and complex. I wish I could get more stuff like this back home."
"D: This is a powerfully good dubbel. It is smooth, well balanced and full of flavor. It is a real joy to drink."
"This is medium bodied, medium-high carbonation. Very smooth. Could drink a lot of this. A very good Trappist beer."
"Very drinkable. Most seem to like it fresh, but I can't recall a bad experience with this beer. Nicely done, and recommended."
"D: An excellent drinker. Westmalle dubbel is a fine example of the delicate and easy-going nature of the Trappist beers, which somehow manage to have this characteristic while still being packed with flavor. It is almost too difficult to describe this in words."
"A 750ml bottle with 07/03/09 over 07/03/07 stamped on the label. Poured into a goblet, it was a medium brown color with some red highlights. A small head that dissipated quickly. It had a faint aroma of fruit (I think banana) and caramel. The taste was similarly muted, but there was some nice bitterness at the end. This was a pretty good beer, but I was expecting a little bit more than I got."
"Notes: Not as good as I expected but I think it had to do with how the bottle was kept plus was a great beer none the less."
"Easily drinkable but not really what's expected. Interesting stuff."
"reddish brown with an off white head that faded pretty quikly and left minimal lace. smelled wonderful. roasty, caramelly, green raisiny, dried fruity, figgy, plummy... on and on... not overboard though. just nice and subtle and enjoyable. taste was very similar to nose. complex, but not overdone. great medium body and very very drinkable. surprised to see ommegang on the list. this one is miles ahead."
"Very malty aroma with roasty and raisiny overtones, slight caramel and a whiff of alcohol. Very dark brown with a frothy, mostly lasting tan head and lots of fine carbonation apparent in the glass. Complex flavor of malt, raisin, slight sourness and mixture of hop and burnt roast bitterness. Aftertaste is mainly of bitterness, sourness and alcohol. Medium carbonation, medium-light body with a fairly quick finish but a lingering aftertaste."
"This is truly a beer given to us by the the beer gods. I had it for the first time last night an I could not believe how good this beer was. It pours a red/brown color with a tan two finger head. From the first smell you can gather what kind of treat your in for. It smells so sweet so fresh that you would think that it was just bottled. The taste is a wild ride between grapes, berries, brown sugar, and a little bitterness for an after note. My palate was jumping for joy when I took my first sip. It is an easy beer to drink and it would sum up and warm day with its refreshing feel. Very easy to drink and I will be certain to enjoy a few more of these this spring and summer. Not to forget I had this from a bottle, but it was poured into its proper Westmalle Glass imported from Belgium."
"Drinkability: A solid, though somewhat subtle Trappist ale."
"Westmalle's Tripel was an outstanding depiction of the style, and their amazing Dubbel fails to dissapoint as well, being an excellent representation of this classic genre... 11.2 oz bottle copped from Total Wine and More in Union, this Trappist Ale pours a mahogany brown hue with a decent frothy and foamy head that soon dissipated, leaving a fair amount of lacing... smell was very thick and rich, replete with dehydrated fruits, caramel, and malts... taste strongly complemented the aroma, with figs, prune, dark sugars, candies, rich malts, caramel, and slight vanilla... really enjoyed this beer... goes down smooth, crisp, and clean, without any alcohol detected and a wonderful combination of intricate, rich flavors that linger on the tongue right after the first sip... an excellent dubbel, truly worthy of great praise... Westmalle did exceptionally well with this one... Nice, creamy mouthfeel with very good drinkbility for a 7% ABV... good stuff... Definitely recommended..."
"Good stuff. Aroma is equal mix piney hops and molasses malts with some fruit as well. Pours an extremely dark red tinged brown with a large creamy kakhi head that lasts pretty well. Some of the best lacing I have seen so far. Taste is okay but somewhat watery for a 7% Trappist Dubbel. A bit dry and over carbonated for the style. That said, this beer is worth getting again."
"D - Very drinkable. I could enjoy a couple of these in a sitting. Recommended."
"d - I started off worried about this one after pouring it and giving it a good smell. Nothing too impressive until it actually hit my tongue. There was almost no head which might be because it had been sitting on the shelf at my local beer store for who knows how long. The taste was excellent though."
"A solid dubble, which I am happy that I can enjoy so frequently."
"I poured this into a chalice. It had a deep brown color with a small creamy head (that didn't last too long). It had a subtle but sweet, malty aroma and a distinctly Belgian flavor that lingered for quite some time. I enjoyed this one and I will certainly try it again."
"This is a drinkable beer if you're into dubbels. While admittedly I didn't care as much for it as others of this style, it's still an excellent beer all around."
"Training my tongue in prep for the Westy 8. This is by no means a training beer, this is a main event in its own right. Pours a brown just on the dark side of hazel with a massive head. Smells vinous, with hints of coriander and nutmeg. Tastes of raisins, brown bread, fermented grape, apple, a slow hop march with a strawberry sweetness trailing behind. Mouthfeel is bubbly, well carbonated and a smooth, clean finish. Dry like a champagne. Quite drinkable - nothing too extreme but solid and well balanced."
"Easily one of my favorite dubbels from what may be the most underrated trappist brewery IMO. Pours a nice brown color with red highlights and good white head. Smell is of spice and dark fruits. Taste has a toooonnnn of dark fruit flavors in it that come out strong up front. some spice and more fruit through the middle. Clean crisp mouthfeel but could be a little better. Drinkability is extremely high. Wonderful beer, from the brewery that makes one of my top 5 tripels as well."
"Went well with some Wisconsin Havarti Cheese."
"D: Very drinkable. Better than Chimay's, IMO. The flavor is good but not overly complex, but all the factors combine to make this an extremely good beer."
"Nice foamy head and a great sweet smell. Pours a dark amber with a tan head. First taste is just...WOW. Where have you been all my life? fruity with a nice long bitter finish but nothing overpowering. Great balance. Motuhfeel if soft, not too think, but not too thin. Goes down smooth, this is a beer I could dirnk a lot of. Drank it too fast to be honest. Amazing."
"The initial taste reminds me of a delicious artisan bread. A little tingle on the tip of my tongue, a hint of tart apples fades into a crisp, earthy, slightly spicy finish. Still plenty of carbonation to keep the mouth feel on the light side, but I liked it. Overall, very tasty. I'd like to try a fresher sample."
"11.2 oz bottle. Pours a murky, non-translucent brown with a massive tan head that is mostly diminishing. Aroma of dark fruit, mostly raisin, some yeast and alcohol. Initial flavor of apple and grape with more dark fruits coming in later. Light body, moderate carbonation, slight alcohol presence, and some lacing. Ok beer, worth a try."
"This is an absolute delight, easy to have a few of these were it not for the cost, and they're well worth cellaring despite, or because of, the drinkability. Outstanding Dubbel. Grab a few."
"Overall, pretty drinkable. There's a lot going for this beer. Great aromas and flavors - a beautiful looking beer. But my bottle may be a month or two past its prime. I'll have to try it again!"
"D- Very good beer. The alcohol is somewhat apparent in this beer."
"Great mouthfeel. Light but rich. Alcohol was totally masked."
"D = This is one of the most drinkable dubbels I have tried. Just an excellent and drinkable beer. Drink and enjoy!"
"This is a wonderful beer. Treat yourself to a great Belgium Dubbel."
"I won't recommend this beer to anyone. Highly overated in my humble opinion. I'll revisit it some day but on someone else's ruble."
"I would happily drink this again but I probably wont because there are other Belgian Ales that I like better."
"Flavor is sweet cedar and more fruitcake.. Belgian esters .. low but noticeable chocolate no alcohol is evident. Nice viscosity and carbonation.. what I think of when I want a dubbel. Trademarked balance and complexity that is beyond my palate."
"Overall- Very good and enriched tastes and smells. However, that made it one dimensional to me. The overall taste and smell was cherries. If it added more complexity than this, I would be a bigger fan. This one didn't do that for me, but all in all was a nice offering."
"Deep garnet/flame colours, nearly opaque. A thick and creamy head floats on top, and lasts forever. Thick malt aroma, sour cherries, spice. Toasty biscuit aromas and flavours. Warm and spicy feel, rich and luscious. Sweetness is well balanced by bitterness, with a yeasty aroma on finish."
"Definitely a dubbel and the second Trappist ale I've had."
"Drinkability: This is an incredibly smooth and enjoyable beer. It is one of the finest Dubbels I have had  really world class."
"The taste starts of nice and malty (caramel, chocolate). Then becomes spicy, dark fruits and just a bit of mustiness. This is my first beer from Westmalle but it will most definitely not be my last."
"Drinkability: A classic Belgian Ale that deserves a chance to be in any fans catalog. I am debating which is the better choice to reach for -- Westmalle Dubbel or the Tripel. I really enjoyed this one, but I think the St. Bernardus Dubbels are more complex and worthier of my praise and devotion. (4.0)"
"A pleasure to drink."
"I've been onto Belgian ales for 6 months and of course had been seeking out the Westmalle offerings. This dubbel is the first Westmalle I have had and it was outstanding. There was a high amount of carbonation (as there should be) and the color of this beer is something to write home about. It is hard to describe the color - sort of a reddish brown carmel malty color - very beautiful. The aromas coming off tis ale are very malty, slightly sweet, and intense. Of course you can smell the alcohol, but that's only natural for this style. As for taste, it is unquestionably great, but I can't help but compare it to Chimay Blue. The hardest thing is to call whether or not I like it better than the Chimay Blue. Chimay is a bit more intense in the flavors, but the Westmalle dubbel is more smooth. In any event it does not disappoint!"
"I poured this expensive beer into my tumbler at 50 degrees. I thought I was going to like this because I have heard so may great things about it. It had a fine bubbly head ans was a rich mohoganny color but was cloudy. The beer semmed to be very very carbonated. The beer had a nice creamy head and bad ass lacing but was very strong in the alcohol taste. I will not buy again but thats just my opinion."
"High attenuation make this highly digestable and refreshing. The mouthfeel is in quite prickly. Haven't had this in a while and I am glad that I chose to revisit the brew."
"Ahhh so delicious. A satisfying and complex favourite, the dubbel of choice. Pairs well with a beef and vegetable stew, but great on it's own as it is delicate."
"Mouthfeel is smooth and warming. Quite rich, without being unctuous, but certainly a sipper. A fantastic, complex beer, that begs to be the centre of attention for an evening."
"Poured a 11.2 oz bottle into a Chimay Chalice. Poured a dark mahogany with ruby tones and a aggressive head. Probably two inches that gradually gave way and left heavy lacing on the glass. Aroma is fruits, sweet malts, raisins and a little alcohol at the end. Taste is mostly the same, but heavy on the fruits. Mouthfeel is medium body with a nice carbonation all the way through the sip. A highly drinkable beer."
"D- a great dubbel, probably my favorite so far"
"This will become a regular visitor in my fridge."
"Overall, a damn fine brew, and one worth seeking out. Its nice to see a brewer still brew a traditional dubbel, without blurring that line between dubbel and Quad. This seems to be a very traditional dubbel, with great malt complexity, but not overly sweet. Mild and restrained in its magnificence perhaps. That being said, I would love to see what the brothers at Westmalle could do with a Quad...."
"A ""must drink"" beer."
"Leaning towards lighter in body and, as mentioned, expressive carbonation. Very drinkable. I can think of other dubbels I would opt for though, if given a choice."
"Review translated from french 11-19-2008."
"Overall this is an enjoyable, complex beer that makes me want to try more in this style and experiment matching w/food."
"11oz bottle from Bevmo. Poured a dark brown with a bit of red around the edges. Head was khaki in color, ample and slowly faded to about 1/4 inch and held with plenty of lacing. Aroma was complex with walnuts, almonds, raspberries, toast and sweet caramel. The flavor mirrored the aroma, with a bit of hops at the back end. The mouthfeel was smooth, full and satisfying with lively prickly carbonation. The finish was long and smooth with a bit of biter hops lingering. Overall: this is an outstanding brew. Recommended."
"Drinkability: A very good beer, although my expectations may have been a bit high as I was expecting something better than good. A decent beer to try especially if one wants to start into trappist ales. A good solid beer and relatively inexpensive, my small bottle was $3.49 or $3.99, I can't remember exactly."
"drinkablity:I could drink this all day"
"picked this up for about $6 at the local package store. It was everything I expected it to be, but just a bit expensive for my current income. I'd gladly pay $2 a bottle all day for this, but I don't know if I'll ever pay that much for such a mid-range beer again."
"Drinkablity is supreme. Damn this is a great beer, why don't I always have a case of these laying around the house? Oh yeah, I'm a huge beer pig!"
"12 oz. bottle marked 07/02/08, I have no idea how old it is. Appearance is a dark-reddish brown with a small head that sticks around pretty well but is not more than a centimeter high. The smell of this beer reminded me of grapes and red wine and me anticipate the taste even though I dont drink wine. The taste is delicious but doesnt quite match up with the smell but that is ok. It is also thick and hard to describe. Its dark and fruity but not really spicy at all, maybe some nuttiness. Good bubbly carbonation and very easy to drink, this is a nice beer. Both beers I have had so far from Westmalle have been delicious but I enjoyed this more than the tripel and I wish I had bought more than one."
"Interesting, but not really my type of beer."
"Notes: My iTunes is on random right now, but what comes up as I finish this glass of Westmalle Dubbel? Coldplay's ""God Put a Smile Upon your Face."" I can't think of a better song to describe this beer."
"Easy to drink but I wouldn't put down the money for one again. Their tripel is far better."
"drinkability is good. the beer is not filling, nor has a high alcoholic presence. this brew is a solid example of a dubbel, and a great brew all around. cheers!"
"Drinkability: This is very easy to drink. A damn good dubbel."
"On the palate the carbonation greatly stands out with an off, malt extract like component towards the finish. Good malt, brown sugar, and dessert like qualities but I'm concerned about the finish."
"Pours into my goblet a dark mahogany color with a creamy thick tan colored head. The head dies down to leave a slim layer of foamy head. Smell is of belgian candied sugar and some yeastynes... Taste is dark malt, dried fruit, a little cocoa, and doughy yeast. A slight alcohol warming presence makes this a very rich drink. One of my top belgian darks, great trappist ale."
"The prune juice brown color with fine belgian lace surrounding a tall glass. Nose is slightly malty with hints of fruits and dark sugar. A range of malt flavor from sweet to slightly sour that gives way to a balanced a spicy hop finish. Truly well crafted. Great for those mild fall days."
"D2: Drinkability improved significantly."
"am not really sure, to be honest. The after taste was strong and fairly lasting but not as lasting as I would like it to be. Something that made me feel a little uncomfortable was the sludge that formed in the bottle itself along with the sediment flakes. I had the flakes scooped up before I drank the beer. I guess it is normal to have these flakes around specially at that age but I guess I would do without it. :)"
""
"Drinkability is good."
"D--very good beer no doubt. However, I honestly would never pass over the abt12, prior 8, rochefort 10 or 8 if I had the choice. This is a belgian worth trying though, I think I am just spoiled."
"D: As the Chimay Red, very drinkable. The alcohol is more noticable here, but not enough to keep me from having a 2nd or 3rd (if only I'd have bought more)."
"If I take up consuming Westmalle Trappist Ale on a regular basis, Im going to have to get a second job"
"d - nicely done, this is so easy to drink and has a lot of depth to it."
"Mouthfeel is nice, although perhaps a little too carbonated, but its got a great overall silky texture to it. As for drinkability, for the style and ABV its extremely quaffable and I could probably go through gallons of it, expecially when it tastes and smells so damn good. One of the best dubbels out there."
"I was somewhat disappointed with this dubbel. Aside from the faint aroma and thin mouthfeel, it lacked both complexity and smoothness."
"Very enjoyable. More bitter than I usually expect from a Belgian."
"My first dubbel in quite a while, I'm always drawn to the tripels since they are always highly spoken of. This beer pours a deep brown with a nice head that has some decent retention. Some mild fruitiness in an aroma that is mostly dark chocolate and caramel. Mouthfeel is a little creamy with a slightly astringent taste that is well balanced, slightly sweet with a mild dry finish. A well-crafted and easy drinking beer I won't mind having again."
"Cheers."
"D - Another terrific belgian brew, not exceptional, but pretty darn close. If it starts appearing in Tallahassee, I will certainly line up to buy a few more."
"Overall, this is my favourite Belgian beer - I'm always tempted to try and homebrew a clone myself, but I doubt I could do it justice."
"D: Fairly complex beer, would get this again, very drinkable."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable for the style. One of the best dubbels out there."
"Mouthfeel is highly carbonated (too much?) but this could be the fault of the above mentioned bottle disturbance. Raisins, prunes and dark rye bread seem to dominate. Nothing terribly hoppy here and the alcohol profile is well-defined and not hiding behind any other flavors. This dubbel does not fool around. You taste all of its 7% ABV."
"Taste is a decently complex dubbel, with a fruity body and an almost harsh alcohol presence. A dry, smooth, and semi-creamy mouthfeel meets the mouth up front and a hoppy, alcoholic bite finishes. Overall, this is a good, complex, and tasty dubbel, as expected from the Westmalle family. Can't wait to try the triple..."
"When held to the light, this beer is the color of a dark ruby stone with active carbonation stemming from the center of the base of my PBR goblet. Head is full, tan, and made up of mostly uniform bubbles. Leaves some spots of lace, but it is minimal. Smells of honey, dried fruits, apples, pears, orange zest, grape juice, a little chocolate, and some faint floral hops. Flavor starts off with a bit of yeast character and some spicy notes mixed in with orange oil and a variety of fruits very close to what I found in the aroma. I pick up some toastiness and a bit of roast malt flavor as well as a little cocoa powder. Overall this has a sweetness to it, but dries up in the finish along with the coming of floral and earthy hops and a soft bitterness that seems to come from a mix of the hops and kilned grains. Mouthfeel has solid body to it, but it is far from cumbersome. It weighs on the tongue just enough to let it know it's there. Carbonation gives the flavors some life but is not harsh or intrusive. This is probably the best dubbel I have ever had for my money. Westmalle is definitely 2 for 2 with this and the tripel."
"D - Very nice smooth fruity beer, that is not overwhelming"
"Very drinkable. I would love to end every day with one of these. This is an exceptional beer. Try it if you haven't already done so."
"Notes: This is just an overall amazing beer. One of the most famous of the Trappist beers, Westmalle Double can be found on tap at many Beglian establishments. 6.5% abv."
"This is a very good beer you have to sit back and think about to really enjoy. You probably could pour it to your macro loving friends and get away with it because it is not screaming with over-the-top flavors and smells. But - those who think about what they are consuming will really appreciate this great brew. I think I need to keep this in mind for the next new years eve party - since I serve beer, not champaign, this would be a good celebration beverage for the beer lovers in my neighborhood."
"D - This is definitely a premiere ale. While it is produced year round, I think it's hard to find a good pairing for this beer because it's so well put together. As is such, I feel like I need to save this beer for a special occasion even though it's readily available."
"D-Not one for everyday, but a nice sipper when the mood takes. im really starting to come around to dark belgian ales. I always imagined something overpoweringly complex and bitter, but the few i have tried have been rich warm and characterful. This is no exception. A fine beer i will enjoy on the odd occasion so i dont sicken myself of it."
"I find this beer to be very smooth and not overly spicy - which I think suits a darker belgian beer... it allows you to appreciate the malt. The only knock is I that I find the aroma lacking. Spectacular, and very well crafted... as a homebrewer, I would love to brew something this good."
"D - More of an ""ale"" feel than some of the trappists as the sweetness was not too heavy. Would have no difficulty dispatching two or three of these. Great stuff."
"Poured a medium to dark brown. Well carbonated as evidenced by a dense, 3/4"" head. Smell is malty, but not overly so with a slight belgian yeast aroma. Other than that, I couldn't detect any other aromatic characteristics. Taste is malty and sweet, but as with smell, there isn't much else going on for flavor here; maybe this was an old bottle (it was the last one on the shelf at my local beer store). Mouthfeel is above average with a warming effect on the palate. Drinkability is fine, although I'm dissappointed that two of this beer's key characteristics were on the average side. I expected more from a dubbel. However, I would give this beer another try."
"I'd rather run around with Racer 5 that I had an hour ago, if I was drinking beer to run around with in my hand."
"D: This is a very drinkable beer. It goes down smooth and crisp and with nice flavors. It would pair well with rich sauces, BBQ, or a nice chocolate desert."
"A quite solid representation of the style. A pleasure for the senses."
"Very drinkable. Smooth and expressive."
"And while I like the aroma, the taste is fantastic. Delicious fruits, toffees and caramels, the alcohol warms everything, the mouth is medium, but the high carbonation makes it feel lighter, which I've never really liked, but is part of the style. In all, its one of the beers that got me so hooked on Belgians, dubbels particularly. Simply a classic."
"D) OK. It would be nice to do back to back with this style."
"Dark hazy brown, almost burgundy. Light tan head of small bubbles. Big at first, dissipates to a nice opaque cover. Aroma is yeasty and bready with notes of raison and alcohol. Like whole wheat bread, slightly bitter with a lingering raisony sweetness, slightly metallic. There are more complexities I cant put my finger on, but still somewhat dissapointing for a style generally characterized by rich and deep flavors. Sharp carbonation bite. Medium bodied and dissapointingly water-downed for a dubbel. More drinkable than many Dubbels, but comes at the expense of good body and strong flavor. A decent beer, but not as good as the Westmalle Tripel."
"Small bottle, 16/05/08 dating on the rear label. Pours cloudy, mahogony, with a long lasting medium tan head, plenty of sticky lacing. Allowed to warm for about 30 mins. Nose of raisins, figs, cola. Seems pretty highly carbonated on the tongue. Flavor notes of more raisins, figs, more cola, and some rum also picked up. Drying and slightly chalky in the finish. Tasty and complex brew, but kind of expensive, (over $4 for the 11.2 ouncer) A nice treat, but other choices abound and I'm not sure how often I'll go for this one in the future."
"Pours a very dark brown color with an average off-white head, not much lacing. The smell is of roasted malt, some dark cherry, a bit metallic, not particularly strong. The taste is of plum, sour cherries, a nice roasted malt backbone. The feel is moderated and fizzy, perhaps a bit too carbonated. Despite the carbonation, this is a damn drinkable dubbel, not too sweet or bitter, hides the alcohol, and goes down nice and easy. One of the better dubbels that I have had."
"Drinkability - excellent. soft feel, no harsh flavors or bitterness."
"D - A very good beer. The complex flavors are outstanding."
"Splendid appearance! Massive thick off-white head about two fingers thick. The color is a dark brown and actually the color of the bottle. Sediment left on the bottom of the bottle. Head gives no indication of receding in anyway after about 5 minutes. When it finally recedes it gave way to moderate lacing. Strong bitter Phenolic aroma. I would of like to see more malt notes in the aroma. Mouthfeel is a bit flat in the carbonation area. ABV is well-hidden and it goes down smooth. Has the same kind of mouthfeel a Guinness might deliver in the area of texture. Aftertaste is very bitter with strong phenols. Has a watery rolling texture that is easy on the mouth. Would like to see more malt character in the taste. Bitterness is a bit overpowering. It doesnt offend too much and is quite drinkable. Not too impressed here. I prefer the Westmalle Tripel anyday. I bought this at Spirit Haus In Amherst,Mass for $5.35/bottle. Very pricey for an 11.2FL OZ bottle."
"D - A nice Dubbel that could use a little less carbonation."
"There is little I can say compared to the accolades this beer has had from proper critics....all I know is that I wish I had a consatant access to it...if I did I may lose my love of German dunkler bocks."
"This is definately a premium beer for the connoisseur, appropriate to be enjoyed with a gourmet meal or on a special occasion."
"Im glad I tried this stuff and I will seek it out again in the future for a special occasion.God im glad the monks like to make bier."
"Well worth seeking out. As a side note, It went extremely well with a lemon tart that I was eating (which brought out the sweetness of the beer)."
"Pours an almost black brown with a thin, creamy but quickly gone head that doesn't leave much lacing. It smells of chocolate and dark cherries. Nice but simpler than I would have thought. The taste is fantastic. Smooth cocoa up front, sweet and sour fruit, then a crisp aftertaste that tastes of baking spices. It reminds me of fresh baked bread. The mouthfeel is silky but surpisingly thin for its pedigree and color. Drinkability is great. The balanced flavor makes the aftertaste leave you wanting more of the original taste and vice-versa. This one doesn't stand up to the tripel but it is simple only by the standards of its off-the-charts trappist cousins. A beer not to be missed."
"A great Dubbel with the classic aroma of caramel, malts and beautiful yeast overtones. Classic Belgian pour and color. Taste lingers a bit but leaves you wanting more. Hard to find a better value in a Dubbel A real winner which is readily available in our area. Life is good."
"Mouthfeel is a little too thin, but the beer clings fairly well. THe mouthfeel in this beer somehow hinders its drinkability. However, this is one solid brew."
"This is a nice drinkable dubbel. Flavorful and smooth."
"D: Extremely drinkable. An exercise in subtlety and nuance. So easy to enjoy!"
"A nice little Trappist Dubbel, with plenty of fruit flavor to enjoy. Recommended."
"Boy does this go down easily. The aroma never stops. Tasty."
"Perhaps this might be an off bottle of the stuff, but barring that it isn't really my cup of tea in the dubbel dep't, so much more out there with flavour to offer to be had instead."
"Poured this one into my Duvel tulip glass. Nice eruption of fizzy head that settles into a creamy tan 1/4"" thick layer on top of the dark brown beer. The nose is rather floral not showing much sign of sweetness, but it is still very much a complex aroma. The first taste is a quick burst of alcohol flavor and a slight bitter ending. I am drinking this at room temperature. After a few more sips it turns into a very warming beer. Not the sweet and rich flavor of several of the dubbels I've had before, but more of a subtle complexity. The mouthfeel is slightly handicapped by the alcohol taste. This is a very odd beer, very mellow yet bold. Very drinkable although it's no good on the wallet. Overall, this beer wasn't as great as I thought it would be. I will have to try a tripel of theirs, I have read that it is much more impressive."
"Overall a nice Dubbel. Not among the best beers Ive tasted but surely pleasant."
"Pours a nice chestnut brown with some red highlights. Good head with nice retention and fantastic lacing. The smell is of clean yeast aromas, dark fruit, and sweet malt. Dry, but noticeable. Some light chocolate on the finish. The taste is wonderful- very dry, with a light creaminess up front, some drying bitterness in the middle and the development of fruit flavors as the taste goes on: dates, prunes, and apples. Sweet malt is also noticeable, as well as some chocolate at the end. Very little alcohol is noticeable.The mouthfeel is one of the most interesting aspects of this beer. It is extraordinarily creamy- it almost seems to float on the tongue. I'm unsure of whether I really like this or if it ends up giving the beer too light of a feel. I think ultimately it probably increases the drinkability score and decreases the mouthfeel score. This beer is a classic- very drinkable, surprisingly refreshing for a trappist ale. A real winner, and one which I hope will be brewed for many years."
"Drinkability: The aroma on this Monk crafted brew is amazing. Iv'e yet to smell a beer like this one. Delicous and complex flavors that are on the fruitier side. An exellent Trappist Dubbel. And the ABV is masked light that of some evil."
"D: Cannot wait to get more next month. If I would have known it ws this good I would have gotten a full case. Very great beer!"
"A ""fresh"" 2007 bottle. Pours (into a Chimay goblet) chocolate brown with a little tan head. kind of looks like unrefined maple syrup with foam on top. Odor is a little weak, although i do get a nice complex mix of fruit, smokey malts and alcohol. Velvety mouthfeel more apparant than the flavor at first. Taste ius woody and yeasty. some smooth chocolate. alcoholic rawness. could use some time to mellow i think. there's a yeasty flavor that's a little overbearing as well and makes me think of homebrews past. There's a 2005 back at the store that i might buy now to compare."
"Trappist Dubbel...Westmalle brings an incredibly complex, dark, heavily bodied beer to the plate. Pours a deep dark chestnut...if this beer was the sky, one might think a storm could be well on it's way. It has that kind of intensity. A burnt sugar head dissipates into a subtle crown not to far down the cup. Raisin, brown sugar, and subtle hints of coffee dominate the nose. The taste follows the nose beautifully, nuances of anise periodically break through. A smooth, heavy body is complimented by the slightly tart finish that lingers well. Stands so well on its own, but can be paired well with any number of flavorful, full bodied cheeses..Enjoy"
"Very drinkable however I only have a single."
"Poured a medium brown color with a good head. The smell was not very strong, the alcohol was what came through to me. The taste was slightly sweet, but I don't taste the alcohol that I smelled. It had a fairly short finish with a bitterness to it. Very little carbonation in this beer and it was almost syrupy. I really enjoyed this one."
"Drinkability- Sippable and quaffable- it's good either way."
"D - Good, but it isn't great. Not going to have this one again, but it isn't awful. Definitely not worth the American price tag. Better dubbels are readily available. Even Chimay Red is superior to this one."
"A very enjoyable dubbel! Not my most favorite of Belgian styles, but this is a really good one. If you haven't tried one before, this would be a good choice. And if you like Belgian beers, this is a must!"
"Served in a chalice, the beer pours dark brown with about an inch off-white head. It smells like dark fruit, roasted malt and caramel. It tastes sweet at first, and has a slight tart finish. It tastes like dark fruit, brown sugar and roasted malt. Mouthfeel is medium, slick and smooth with just the right amount of carbonation. The drinkability is also very good, the alcohol is well hidden and it's pretty easy to drink. Overall I think this is a pretty good Dubbel, I'd buy it again."
"Poured from 11.2oz bottle into a Westmalle chalice. Beautiful appearance, dark opaque chestnut brown with a thick and creamy looking froth. The aroma is sweet and a little malty and the flavor is already well documented by hundreds of reviews. I agree with the majority opinion, this is an awesome dubbel."
"Overall: One of the best dubbels i've had and a staple in my fridge."
"330ml bottle with the best before date of 7/2/08. Poured into a chalice. Pours a very dark brown with a light tan head that sticks all over the glass. The aroma is a malt-dominated nose with overripe dark fruits, bananas and just a slight touch of chocolate. The taste is much like the aroma in that it is very malty. The full bodied and silky smooth mouthfeel instantly stands out as one of the best assets of the beer. Overall, this is a delicious brew that is recommended."
"A nice brew, well put together, and a pleasure to drink."
"D: Definitely worth another go-round for the flavor characterstics."
"Still solid and worth picking up any time of year."
"Pours a murky, very dark brown with a head that lasts for a few minutes. Some toastiness and raisin in the aroma; no hops. Taste is an enormously satisfying maltiness with some spiciness at the start and tartness in the finish. A medium mothfeel. Taste and mouthfeel are reminiscent of a bock, but the taste has much more complexity. The alcohol is completely subdued; I could drink this all day."
"Amber/brownish with thin 1-finger tan head, poured into a goblet. Very solid dark brown when filled all the way up, as it gets down to the end and there is less liquid you can tell it is a translucent brown with orange-red hue. Very malty and as it warms up a lot more of the yeast character comes through. Hops not detectable. Carbonated pretty generously and seems like alcohol is hidden pretty well."
"Overall: A solid offering from Westmalle, but not as good as their Tripel. Its also expensive for a beer of this quality (4.99/ 12 oz.)."
"A solid Dubbel, with it's share of positives to offer. Along with another fair share of negatives in the mix as well. It's good, but their Trippel is much better."
"Poured out a is a solid dark brown color, mostly opaque, with a light brown head. The nose offers fruity esters (banana) with undertones of yeast. The taste on the other hand counters with roasted chocolate malt, raisins, and a subtle bitterness of floral hops and bittersweet chocolate. The mouthfeel is smooth, almost a bit on the watery side."
"Pours dark brown with an off white head which dissipates to a patchy film and a ring around the glass. Aroma is malts, carmel and fruits. Taste matches aroma. Medium bodied, leaves a slight alcohol burn in my throat. This is good, but for the price there are much better dubbels available."
"This is a very nice beer. It has all of the maltyness with just the right amout of hops. All of this blends into a delicious product where one aspect of the product does not overpower any other. Dark red brown colour, creamy head. Aroma of plums and yeast. A good beer."
"A good dubbel, tasted a lot like Chimay's dubbel: Chimay Premiere. Has some very pleasant and rich malt flavors and a nice burnt sugar sweetness to it. Recommended."
"This is one tasty brew. All the flavors blend well together and the 7% alcohol is hidden very well. It's definitely a good beer to age since I have no idea when I bought this bottle."
"As stated before, I could drink more of these. Nice beer! Recommend trying this one!!"
"This beer is exceptionally drinkable and I would defiantly have this in my kegerator if I had the money to spend. This is a very good beer and a must try in my opinion as it is probably a great example of the Trappist Dubbel style."
"The beer poured in a nutty dark red-brown color. Its sweet, hoppy and fruity aroma filled the room. Great. The glass had a finger of thick, nice foam with small craters in it, almost like a solid hat on the liquid. The taste was bitter and sweet with some licorice and citric notes as well as a faint touch of yeast. It was bubbly, to say the least. I know this is right for the style but I thought the carbonation got the upper hand of the mouthfeel. Considering that it's a Trappist I also felt it was a little thin in taste. I'd rather opt for the triples."
"Glad I bought this one! Great stuff!"
"Taste is clean, with a lot of the fruits I mentioned, plus a dry tartness at the end. It's a little bit puckering, but this is one juicy beer and tastes delicious."
"Drinks pretty easy, by far my favorite style of trappist/abbey ales. This would go great with roast beef or stew IMO, or any thing a burgundy type wine would pair with. Well worth the $ 3.70 for 11.2 ozs. superb version of the style"
"I've had this beer several times and refrained from reviewing it because I thought factors other than the beer might be contributing to my enjoyment of it. But it hits me the same way every time. For me, this is a Hall of Fame beer."
"I found this to be very drinkable and I was wondering, as I always do with great beer in a bottle, what the ale would be like on tap...an exciting idea as I know barrels are available of this one, but not the Triple, in the USA."
"Pours a very creamy head, with a nice toasted-brown colour. Colour is dark opaque brown. Aroma of dry fruits, raisins, chololate and spices, pepper maybe? I think a notice some coriander too. Mouth is of a somewhat harsh, but nice taste of caramel, spices, aniseed. Chocolate and port wine too."
"Poured from the 330ml bottle into my Liefman's goblet. Body is a pretty dark brown with garnet highlights, topped by an inch of creamy, khaki-colored head that holds its own. Aroma of dark, sweet, bready malt, dark fruit, some banana esters, and a touch of astringency. Palate is lightly malty up front, with some strong peppery notes. A sweetness somewhere between maple and molasses builds towards the back of the mouth, along with notes of plum and dark cherries. Mouthfeel is rich and creamy, very nice. Goes down easy for a darker Belgian. A very tasty and refined ale."
"Go LCBO!"
"The pour into my Westy chalice raises a cola-bubbled one finger head that dissipates very quickly to a thin layer, and eventually to a glass ring. The lacing is quite sticky at the beer's previous level. The body is a murky brown with ruby highlights. The nose is mildly alcoholic, peppery, caramely, darkly fruity, and, well, that's all I can pick up. The taste is mild (I think my cold is affecting my taste more than I thought), but a bit spicy and sweet. Still, this seems to have balance, I just wish I could say more. The mouth is a little light, with pretty active carbonation. I think I'll drink liquor and cheaper beer until I'm sure that I'm rid of this cold. Definitely scheduled for a re-visit!"
"I want to go to Belgium. NOW. If this is this good here (after being in the bottle who knows how long - no freshness date), I can just imagine what it is like fresh over there...Would love to pair it with some fresh Belgian chocolate."
"D - Hmm. I was a bit disappointed with the taste. The initial no-taste was a bit of a shocker - I've never had anything like that before, and the overall lightness of the brew wasn't expected."
"Drinkability: Great brew, phenomenal with dessert. Offers many surprises as she warms up."
"Poured a ruby red with a small caramel head. Nice swirling effect as the head reforms thick and clingy. Smells of chocolate with deep roasted malt. Some hints of fruit, citrus I think. Taste is chocolatey malt with anice bitterness. Warming as it goes down. Very well hidden alcohol level, but I think I would enjoy a little more feeling. Thin mouthfeel goes down easy. I wish I had more than one of these. Looks like another trip to Ohio!"
"Pours dark brown with ruby-red highlights with several fingers of light tan head and a good bit of lacing. Smells sweet, fruity and somewhat piney. Tastes fruity, kind of pruny. Some roasted notes. Medium body. A little bitter. Tasty, but not my favorite dubbel. A solid beer though."
"11.2oz brown bottle with drink before date of 5/4/07. Pours a deep chestnut brown with a crisp sounding 2 finger head with good longevity and lace. Wonderful aromas of sweet malts, dried dark fruit, brown sugar, buttery, nutty and sherry. full bodied taste but yet somehow still subtle. Again big malts mixed with all the above smells. Alcohol hidden well. Smooth and creamy with a nice subtle hop bitterness in the aftertaste. A very very nice dubbel and one to easily get a bit intoxicated."
"Pours a hazy reddish brown, nie thick tan head forms, settles down into a nice layer, great lacing, great retention. Smell is sweet, berries, yeast, caramel, almost a burnt currant kind of aroma, real nice though. Taste is sweet, very fruity, some citrus, yeast, little bit of booze, pretty weak compared to the smell for me though. Mouthfeel is thin bodied with high carbonation, finishes dry, very attenuated."
"Dark chestnut, a little hazy, with reddish highlights and a fine, light brown head. Bready and fruity aroma, some raisin, malt, and mild chocolate. Raisin and plum flavours to start, mild bitterness, then it finishes sweet and bready with a hint of alcohol warmth. Great texture, well-integrated and generous carbonation, medium bodied. This is very nice, sweeter than I expected, but not cloying at all. I'll definitely be picking more of this up."
"Excellent aroma, the flavors are quite nice too, but the mouthfeel is strange. I'll stick with the tripel. But it's still miles above the norm. Leave it to the monks."
"Lively hops wake up the tongue, however, the texture is smooth, medium bodied and highly drinkable. Very nice. I will seek this one out again."
"Not the first Belgian Trappist ale I've had, not the first Dubbel either. This ranks as a good one and certainly worth a try."
"I must travel to Belgium for a fresh sample."
"Mouthfell is good and creamy with lots of soft carbonation. Taste is certainly very good, solidly delicious dark ale. The main impression is perfect balance between malt, hop, alcohol, no element intrudes on any other. My first taste of Westmalle, I guess I was hoping for something a bit more interesting--I guess mainly because of the price, I feel like there are lots of other ales out there as enjoyable as this."
"drinkability: at 7% abv, you wouldn't know there is alchohol in it. I would have had several if it hadn't been for the drive home."
"D: One of my all-time favorites. Just a remarkably flavorful, warming, comforting beer, especially on a cold/chilly day."
"D-Was pretty good but don't think I'd be buying this again unless the price went down."
"D: It's nice to finally have this one. It's pretty good, but the strong phenolic taste makes this one a bit less drinkable for me than its contemporaries."
"Poured a reddish brown into an Achel chalice, with a 2 finger head that quickly dissapted. The aroma was of carmel and cherries with a hint of butterscotch, The taste was complex, with notes of pepper, cherries and carmel. Mouthfeel was light to medium with little carbonation."
"Tastes of raisins and prunes, berries, molasses, fenugreek, cocoa, a little alcohol and white pepper. Very smooth, creamy carbonation. Head keeps replenishing itself. The sweetness is never cloying. Some grassy, herbal hops in the background. This is very well balanced, rich, and satisfying."
"Very awesome looking brew here. Nice 3 finger head that never disappates, leaving lacing down the tulip. Almost strange for a dubbel, has a very chocolately(light) taste to it. It is short in my opinion as compared to other dubbels I have had. A good brew, just will not seek it out, many other better dubbels less expensive."
"Dark brown purple in color, kind of a chestnut, peachy-rose when the light hits it right. Average size beige head. Deep fruity, plum and date aroma, with some yeast and banana, as well as some medicinal phenols. The taste revealed sweeter, fruity flavors like ripe raspberries and blackberries, red grapes, pears, and bananas. This beer really had a feel like drinking wine. A semi-sparkling, dry, and tart mouthfeel, with alcohol that was hardly noticeable except for some belly warming. So easy to drink, an awesome dubbel."
"Drinkability: An awesome dubbel, one that could probably be considered the standard for the style. Amazing balance and development, with awesome malts and a refreshing bitterness. Fantastic."
"pours amber with a slight brown head, but it goes away quick. smells great, a slight fruit smell to it maybe. tastes good, but its drinkability is really awesome for as it is 7.0% the alcohol is there but it doesn't attack you like some other higher ABV beers do. mouthfeel is good, doesn't feel too thick, but not to thin either. one of the few stronger beers that i could see myself drinking more than just at dinner."
"Drinkability/Overall: this is to dubbels as Tripel Karmeliet is to tripels - complex, balanced and totally drinkable."
"Drinkability is great. Great beer."
"the flavor was rather tart and interestingly smokey with a slightly bitter finish. the mouthfeel was decently balanced . overall this was not a bad beer, but as a dubbel I didnt feel that it stood out particularly much in any way."
"The 7% alcohol and $6 per bottle will limit my consumption of this one, but it is very tasty"
"D: A wonderful warm beer, easy to drink with a hearty dinner or rich dessert. Be sure to enjoy from a snifter or similar glassware to get the full aroma/flavor spectrum."
"Mouthfeel is medium, approachable with great carbonation. Drinkability? If there's any room in your belly, you will want to drink this!"
"D - Good. Nice Belgian Dubbel."
"Pours to a reddish brown color with thick, foamy off-white head that lingers through most of the glass, plenty of floating yeast, and good lacing. yeast. Aroma is a mixture of hints of fruit and chocolate. Tasty, fruity flavor throughout the glass, and has a good, long finish that actrually is that of a malty sweetness.."
"A gem pairing would be with a nice dark chocolate with roasted cocoa beans. Guess what I'm having with mine? *hint hint*"
"highly recommended!"
"Deep brown color with a slight mahogany note. Nice big fluffy tan head that sticks around to leave trails of lacing. Smell is very malty. Caramel, with a light chocolate note. Also some faint dark fruit, cherries and figs. As it warms a faint alcohol smell comes through too but it is very pleasant. Taste is a well balanced maltyness with enough other flavors to keep it interesting. Again, a light cocoa note and some dark fruits. Just a little bit thin on the mouthfeel but I'm not thinking that is a bad thing. This would be the Trappist I would turn to when I'm not in the mood for the high alcohol and big taste of some of the big boys. Finishes very smooth with no aftertaste. I really enjoyed this one. Will definately get it again."
"Nicely balanced brew but lacks deep complexity."
"drinkability: neither smooth enough to call refreshing, nor heavy enough to call filling, this is a pleasing enough brew that's relatively easy to drink. I'm not anxious to try it again, but I'm tempted to pick one or two up and tuck them away somewhere for a year or so and see what happens."
"Pours a brown-tinted garnet, moderate head, no lacing at all. Smells very sweet, definitely some fig aroma here, maybe a little caramel. Taste reminds me a bit of Sierra Nevada's Bigfoot Barleywine. Figs, some date maybe, a bit of alcohol warming. The level of bitterness seemed appropriate. In the mouthfeel department, seems a little undercarbonated to me. A touch syrupy, aftertaste is good. Overall a solid dubbel, but I'm not the biggest fan of the style - too much on the sweet side for my personal tastes. Funny how much it reminded me of Bigfoot, though."
"Drinkability is way high. This is quite a fine brew. Care and quality show the whole way. You could drink this all night if you had the $$$. But at $4 per pop, not the best deal in town. MK"
"Westmalle Trappist Dubbel pours an opaque dark brown, with a small tan head and little bits of yeast along the bottom of the glass. Banana is noticeable to me in the aroma. I can also smell some alcohol, some other fruity notes are also present. Taste is really interesting, caramel and some fruit like notes, fig like maybe. Really interesting mouthfeel as well. Sparkly and prickly, but not overly so. Excellent beer, recommended."
"Very easy to drink, warming, and goes down smooth."
"Pours a cloudy, muddy brown with a good sized head and lacing that disperses quickly. The smell is that of dried fruits especially grapes. Strong alcohol notes. Taste is sweet with an effervescent feel. The fruit flavor really shines through. The drinkability is high as this is a great tasting beer with a moderate alcohol content."
"It poured a nice dark - reddish color with a nice foamy brown head, which dissipates slowly. Nice aromas of malt, fruits - melon - and bubblegum are present. This beer has a nice level of acidity. It is a pleasure to drink! Wonderful to sip on. Highly recommended!"
"This dubbel poured a dark brown color with red highlights with creamy, light brown foam that slowly settled but coated the glass. The smell was malty with notes of dark caramel and a light hint of sweetness. The taste was malty with notes of vinous fruitiness. There was a moderate hop bitterness as well as a touch of alcohol in the finish. The mouthfeel was smooth with medium-full body and good carbonation. Overall this beer had a light feeling on the tongue, and was lightly warming. A nice beer to savor slowly."
"This is very good, but I wouldn't want to do more than one at a time. The merlot flavors would make this an excellent beer for dinner."
"Pours a deep mahogany and amber with a two finger cap that dissipated to a 1/4 inch cap. Nice head retention. Aroma is yeast and sourdough right off. Fruit esters of pear, green apple and raisins. Bubblegum in the background. Alcohol is light in the nose. A slight vinous quality. Flavor is raisin and fig. Dissapointingly no pear that I can find in flavor. Sour grain and yeast. Mild bitterness and a earthy undertone. Mouthfeel is med carbonation, med body, and finishes mildly dry. Good beer!"
"I've had better, but I'd definitely recommend this beer. Not sure how many I'll pick up at $5 a bottle though, but I just hope I save my other bottle long enough to find out how much better it gets with age."
"A great beer with delicious malt, roasty, hoppy flavor and aroma that is very smooth and easy to drink despite the good strength."
"There isn't anything to prevent me from wanting another but not much to induce me either."
"Not a bad beer, certainly a quality Belgian-style abbey ale, but it fails to live up to the Westmalle hype."
"D - Very drinkable. This is my frist Westmalle, very tasty brew indeed, will definitely buy again, highly recommended."
"Poured from an 11.2oz bottle into my Rochefort glass. Poured a dark brown almost amber with a small quickly dissipating tan head that leaves nice lacing the whole time. Smells malty sweet with definite fruity notes. Tastes of a slight spice with a nice warming sensation, malty with just a hint of fruitiness. A nicely carbonated mouth-feel, a medium body. This is a very drinkable dubbel, I will definitely get more."
"Decent mouthfeel if a little on the thin side. Fairly easy to drink, but also a little underwhelming."
"A very drinkable trappist."
"Comments: I truly enjoyed this all the way through the glass. Each sip seemed to be better than the last. By the first true Belgain dubbel I've reviewed, this was everything I had expected."
"Burgundy. Deep, complex nose of mixed berries, cherries, chocolate, caramel and mixed nuts. Slightly cloying, deep fruity flavor with notes of plums, cherries and other dark fruits. This is lacking flavor beyond the sweet dark fruitiness but more so, this is lacking depth and body. I want a richer, more complex malt flavor in a dubbel"
"Overall, good carbonation, not too thcik or too thin, pretty drinkable, but I'm not feeling another one."
"Glad to have revisited this beer after not having it for quite a while. Typical of all great Trappist beers. A prune-like colored hue with a yeasty murkiness, rocky foamstand, and great lacing. Seriously rich aroma. Full of fruits, candy, spices, and berries. Tastes the same as aroma, even moreso. A terrific blend of ripe-to-bruised fruits of apples, pears, dates, figs, and banannas. Candies of beet sugars, sweet malty, and a bit of a chocolate flavor. Spices up with a vineous-berry flavor, yeast, aged hops, and alcohol. Full and rich in the texture that falls short of thick. Finishes sweet, a bit tacky, and a bit dry. Worthy of the Trappist name. It's a very good beer."
"Cheers2Beers"
"Quite a nice brew, and I tip my hat to those monks!"
"The body is big but not necessarily full. Limit Dextrins and bits of chewiness are a big presence. This really limits the drinkability of the beer. A dessert beer is the best descriptive word. Still nice to know you can pick it up in the middle of nowhere."
"This was poured from a 330ml bottle inte a Westmalle chalice.The appearance was a reddish brown color with a tan head that quicly dissappears.The aromas were malty and slightly sweet and those smell were reflected in the taste as well.This Trappist beer was not as full as some of the other ones and while I personally thought this beer was ok,I do not believe it as good as the other ones like Chimay or Orval."
"This is a nice drinkable Dubbel. It certainly warmed me up from the inside out. First beer of the evening and I must say I enjoyed every bit of it."
"Well made and a joy to drink. A solid Belgian that many could enjoy."
"The smell is actually the least appealing aspect of this dubbel...seems a little boozy. Overall, a rich and fruity trappist brewed ale that drinks like a much stronger beer."
"Pours a deep brown, mahagonay color. Very slight head that dissaptes to a white ring. Beautiful aroma, raisins, dark chocolate, caramel malts. Taste is friuty yet finishes quite dry. Juicy plums, rough hewn wood, a little citrusy. Hops are non existant in the aroma and subtle in perceived bitterness."
"I've had this many times, but have just gotten around to rate it. I had a cold, so some of the aromas probablydid not come through as strong. Heavy malt with some sweet dough. Also, a good hint of cherry. Creamy head that completely went away. Brown, with some tiny particles. I poured the whole bottle.Good, dubbel, right on style."
"Full body, normal carbonation, little dry mouthfeel. Nice spicy, light bitter lasting finish."
"The mouth is a bit astringent and comfortably stocky. I like this one as an evening sipper. I would not session this beer, but always look forward to the next time I have one."
"On par with the much praised Westvleteren. Aroma is full of dark fruits like cherry and date and spicy. A dark brown body supports a huge three finger thick Belgian beauty of a head. Has the taste of spiced bread pudding dipped in choclate liquor and the mouthfeel to match. Very tasty with a long lingering aftertaste."
"P.S. For the last few sips I have swirled in the sediment, and the beer came back for another round of boosted activity in the mouth. Obviously more attention was brought to the yeast, and the beer's body thickened slightly. Great Trappist offering."
"Overall very enjoyable, much more than expected. Quite drinkable."
"It's a joy to drink and feel. Very yummy."
"D - Definately a drinkable beer. Something to be appreciated especially after a long day of programming."
"drinkability aside from the tangy metallic taste was good. this is a light bodied easy to drink beer. As far as dubbels go, I am glad to have tried this, but it doesn't move into the ranks of my favorite dubbels."
"The rather abrupt, dry finish is a bit beguiling. In a way it leaves me wanting, which is good and bad. It makes me want to take another sip soon after the last, but can almost be a little unsatisfying (at least the first one) as a sip & savor beer. That said this is a real finely crafted, complex beer that I could see myself settling down and drinking 2 or 3 of, or enjoying with a rich braise."
"11/25/05 on label. Pours a bubbly raison brown. Aroma is like a Fig Newten and some raisins. Lots of dark brown particulate matter suspended amongst the aggressive carbonation. Taste is less sweet then most other well known dubbels but less complicated and interesting as well. Its rather underwhelming but one strong point is the lively carbonation. That in combination with the moderated sweetness makes this one very drinkable."
"flavor is sweet, with fruits like dried apricot coming to mind, a little yeast, and some mild dry hops on the finish."
"The drinkability is superb. This thing is full of different components that all seem to share the spotlight. Nothing is overdone and the balance and mellow nature of this brew are worthy of praise."
"Overall - A very good beer.... Recommended... Probably could have done with some aging though..."
"D - Definitely an interesting scope of flavors that keep a drinker interested. I like this one a lot."
" I could drink this again, easily. I will recommend this one to friends."
"The beer has a lovely head, rocky, light tan, with a nice brown beer that is slightly cloudy. The aroma is nice, too, with a light bubble-gum ester and some other fruity aromas, along with a slight malty note and a light, almost raisin quality. I think I'd like those last two to be a little more prominent. The flavor is great - full, fruity, somewhat malty sweet and a little toasty. The alcohol is present but not overpowering, and the body / mouthfeel is kind of spritzy, which is fine for style. Delicious!"
"Drinkablility is very high. This 11.2 ounce bottle disappeared very quickly. I did make the huge mistake of drinking the chunky black (eek!) sediment in the bottom..."
"Drinkability was good. Not as strong as a quadruple. Nor as sweet. A very drinkable beer."
"Drinkability - not the most memorable dubbel but certainly drinkable. I can handle several of these as long as the budget can."
"Very good beer, but I don't think I could drink a lot of them in a row."
"The color is a rich cloudy brown with a dense, solid head. Plenty of dark sediment at the bottom also. The head dissipated some but left a nice brown layer behind. Smells of grapes, licorice, coffee, and chocolate. Very complex and inviting. The taste is sharp at the start, both sweet and sour, with hints of wine grapes and other fruits. Mild bitterness to follow. It's very bubbly on the palate and light to medium in thickness. Lots of complex flavor to offer, very drinkable, and very delicious."
"D: Very drinkable for its 7% alcohol content. A good beer to savor with dinner or dessert."
"As far as drinkability, I found this to be a lot more drinkable and smooth, going down and afterwards, as any of the more common darker beers mass-circulated in the USA, such as Beck's or whatever. I think that if you aren't a beer-fanatic and you like those darker beer-brands, you'd like this one a lot better."
"I expect the use of lots of sugar, because of the thin body and the lack of caramel tastes. Aftertaste is almost absent. According to well informed sources, this beer is made from pale malt, 20% dark candy sugar and colorant (E150). Off course, the signature yeast is indispensable."
"Served in a chalice. Beer poured a dark brown with a nice creamy head. Plenty of carbonation, but not over carbonated. Malty taste with very little hop bitterness, little bit of an alcohol kick at the end. I would love to drink more than one, but with the price and alcohol content this may not be one of my better ideas. Good beer to drink, especially if you find a decent price on it."
"D- This beer doesn't have the depth in malt that I was hoping for and I was surprised by the alcohol kick. Its a good beer but I would expect a little more. The date guide on the label is not checked of so I don't know how old this beer is, that might account for the lack of depth?"
"11.2oz bottle poured into a Chimay chalice. Nice dark brown colour with a creamy tan head. Lots of carbonation. The color looked great and the smell was awesome! Had an excellent mouthfeel with the carb. The taste however let me down. It was good overall but had alot of bitter aftertaste. Worth the occasional try but not a favorite. PR 2.75"
"Nice ""Belgian"" carbonation and full rich body. I'm very impressed with this beer, Long live Belgium!"
"Overall, a quite drinkable beer. Very easy to drink for seven percent alcohol."
"Cheers"
"D = Drink the tripel. Forget this one."
"Overall: A very fine beer. The key here is the depth of flavor as it starts doing somersaults down your throat and the lingering tastes on your tongue go through their motions. Not a ""wow!," but a very drinkable beer and a classic example of the style."
"Pours an effervescent hazy mahogany, with an indestructably creamy tan head. Aroma of plums and other dark fruits, almost palpable vapours. Taste was a candy sugar sweet at first, with a malty chocolate note in the middle, and a raisiny finish with some roasted and hop character taking a bow at the end. It really coats the tongue and is smooth as silk. This is a wonderful Dubbel, and easily my favourite."
"Pours a murky deep garnet color with noticeable trails of yeast and with a mountainous beige head on top that slowly recedes into a thick and rocky lace. Nose is rather sweet with notes of sugar cookies and banana cream pie. Taste begins with sweet malt, ripe banana, dark plums, and brown sugar followed by some dry bready notes and dusty cocoa. Pretty nice dubbel here."
"The mouthfeel is wonderful. Very smooth with some nice light carbonation. It is certainly a beer I will drink again. A nice beer to sit and ponder life or have with an excellent steak."
"Opinion: Thus far, I have not been a big fan of Dubbels. I keep trying them because I assume that I will find the right one. This beer is probably one my favorites so far. It isn't too estery, which is my contention with most of the others. I haven't tried that many yet, so I don't have nearly the opinion on Dubbels as Tripels. This is still a mighty fine brew, and one that I am sure I will be drinking again in the future."
"Pours an opaque dark mahogany, with a light tan head that gushes up to fill the glass. Excellent retention that leaves patchy lacing. The dark fruit aroma is strongest, raisins and plums, coupled with chocolate malt and traces of noble hops. Roasted malt and sharp fruit esters make the flavor both acidic and sweet, but never astringent. A crisp, hoppy aftertaste balances the pronounced malt flavor and dries out the residual sweetness for a clean finish. The complex flavors complimented by a velvetly smooth mouthfeel provide a more than adequate drinkabilty despite the full body and alcoholic strength."
"Mouthfeel is velvety smooth, soft and luscious. Changes character quite a bit as it warms a little, this one is worth setting out for a few minutes. A very nice dubbel, one of the best I've found. I could drink a few of these."
"This is a wonderful beer. I'm glad my first experience with it is a fresh version that I can tell has been handled well. I'll definitely revisit this one. As dubbels go, it's hard to beat something like this."
"12oz bottle poured into a Chimay goblet. Pours out a deep ruby-tinted brown with a half-inch of solid tannish head. Nose is gorgeous, a sweet, fruity scents with a full malt aroma that reminds me of unboiled wort. Flavor is more of the same: rich dark malt (unusually malty compared to most dubbels), caramalized fruit (raisins, plums) along with lightly spicy, phenolic notes. The finish is somewhat roasty, balancing things out nicely. Full, even bodied, with a neutral texture."
"Drinkability is simply some of the best stuff on Earth! I am going to go drink the sediment in the bottom of the bottle, and I am not joking about that!"
"Poured into a chalice and had a nice dark brown, slightly reddish color, with a decent off-white head. Smell was mostly caramel with hints of alcohol. Smell was a sign of trouble ahead. Did not care for the taste at all. Caramel flavor was overpowering and did not mask the alcohol taste. Needs a bit more body and complexity. Felt harsh on the mouth and actually struggled to finish it. I just may not be a fan of dubbels so take this for what it is worth."
"Overall a phenomenal beer."
"Drinkability: The alcohol punch is not hidden well. This inhibits the drinkability a tad and this is one to savor. Nicely done."
"Decent belgian; not as tasty as I hoped but rather easy to drink."
"I'd buy this in a store, but probably not at a bar again as it set me back eight bucks. Worth it once!"
"Westmalle Dubbel oozes quality. Patience and focus is required to plump the depths of its beer soul, but the effort will be rewarded. This is a more than worthy member of the canon of great Belgian dubbels."
"Very approachable. Drinkability only suffers because there is so much flavour!"
"Drinkability is good a nice enough dubbel, the smell is wonderful and the flavor doesn't quite live up the the expectations set by the nose on this one."
"Pured a dark brown color, with a very thick foamy head. Had a really good dark fruity (raisin/plum), matly, sugar and a little alcohol smell. Was expecting more from the taste after how good it smelled, but it was still pretty good. Had a very nice creamy mouthfeel. Worth trying atleast once."
"This is good."
"Drinkability is good as well. There is some noticable alchohol but this is a rare treat that will get the job done of fulfilling the craving for a dubbel."
"An inch of bubbly, tan, sticky head caps a nice, dark brown beer with red edges. Holy smokes! What a complex nose: sweet, malty, yeasty, bubblegum, bready goodness. Delicious before I've even tasted it. The front is a buttery, spicy, yeast-o-rama. Fruity in the middle, with bubblegum, vanilla icing and dark caramel. Yeasty, bready, fruity finish. The aftertaste is slightly woody with alcohol... quite red wine-like. Absolutely delicious: sweet (but not cloying) bubblegum, malty, yeasty, vanilla icing. Wow again."
"The smell is of yeast and sweet malt and caramel and toffee. There is not extreme complexity, but enough to keep the drinker interested. The inital taste is of sweet dark chocolate coffee and honey. The finish is dry and the aftertaste Is superb. There is absolutely no hint of alcohol here. This is simply amazing. As you swirl this around your chalice, you think to yourself, why is God so cruel that this does not come in pints? Perhaps in heaven."
"the only con for me was the carbonation was a bit biting in the middle, but hardly a complaint. highly reccomended."
"a delicate yet strong beer, one to enjoy during a quiet, focused time."
"Overall: At Last!!! Fresh Westmalle is now available in the USA, I had experienced way too many old bottles in the past over here; old, musty, aged, mishandled and poorly transported  this alone has the been the single reason why I never submitted a Beer Review for either the Westmalle Dubbel or Tripel since joining BA - simply because I knew how good this could be. I find Merchant Du Vin are a little pricey at times, but that said I had no problems paying a little extra for a good fresh bottle. In short, in the US, if it doesnt say MdV on the reverse label, my advice would be to put it back on the shelf, if it *does* say Imported by MdV on the reverse label  pick it up and remind yourself how good this one is. I think Ill pick up another Westmalle Goblet when I see one to celebrate the return of fresh Westmalle."
"Smooth and creamy with a small crispy bite from the carbonation. Chocolate, dates and hints of spice collaborate to engorge the toungue. Hidden underneath is the alcohol. Sweet beer with a decent amount of alcohol underneath. Overall one of my favorite Belgiums. Great offering from the monks at Trappist."
"Pours a well-carbonated clear mahogany with a thin off-white head. Leaves a small film and good lace considering the ABV. Smells sweetly malty. Raisins and bananas on a grainy and spicy base. A nice progression of flavors ride strong carbonation and a very crisp mouth-feel. Starts sweet and slightly sticky, with plenty of chocolate and raisins. Builds into a drier and more grainy middle. Notable spicy hops and alcohol in the finish; extremely dry and crisp. Much drier, more strongly hopped, and more quenching than I remember from previous samples."
"Excellent brew, too bad it cost me 5 bucks for 330 ml. bottle."
"Incidentally, one of the 2 bottles I drank had a raised relief writing over which the label was applied. Think it's probably an earlier bottle, so I hung on to it! Sad, I know."
"Dark cherry brown body with a tan head that faded but laced. A bit of sediment that looks like coffee grinds even. A stronge and somewhat surprising baker's chocolate on the nose, the ABV came through too but not nearly as strong as some other trappists I've had. Very pleasant on the nose. A mix of black cherry, bits of chocolate, cane sugar, and a very light sensation of lemon zest on the tongue. No acidity to speak of but a creamy and thick feeling with a slight oily aftertaste/feel. Very drinkable for the alcohol."
"Poured out of a 11.2 oz bottle with a 11/25/05 best by date into a tulip. Pours a deep dark brown with tinges of purple and a mammoth beige head. Moderate amount of lacing. Aroma is of bubblegum, plums, apples, hay, and of musty yeast. Taste is very sweet and malty, reminded me of cherry flavored gum, with a bit of spiciness towards the finish. Alcohol is more evident than it needs to be for 7%. Mouthfeel is extremely smooth and effervescent--it hardly feels like your drinking anything. Not a bad beer my any stretch, but for the high price of a Trappist, I have to say this is one of the few I tried that just isn't worth it."
"Drinkability- Not a bad beer at all, but I was expecting a bit more. More sweetness and bursting flavors. Still worthy of some praise."
"Cascading from its distinctively shaped Westmalle bottle, this Dubbel sits before me enticing me to learn its secrets. Hazy deep amber brown is its hue, and it is filled with free floating solid matter. Khaki colored head crops up huge and then dies down to a manangeable level. The head is composed of small and distinct tightly knit bubbles. Malty aroma hints at dark fruit and apples below the bread surface. At first, I am taken aback by the huge, crisp carbonation. Concentrating on this ethereal tasting experience, I am confronted by a metric ton of bready malt at the beginning of the taste. Going deeper, sweet toffee and caramel are revealed to me, leading into luscious ripe fruits. Some nuttiness graces my palate, all of this amid streaks of a woody smokiness. Herbal and earthy notes frolic about, setting the stage for some spicy and biting citrous hops that boldy make a stand. Finish is toasty malt mixed with very bitter lemon and orange peel hop glory. There is a pronounced acidity in the finish as well, lending a vinous quality. As stated before, the mouthfeel is very crisp, moving this taste along with brisk carbonation. Fantastically complex, this brew is meant to be sipped and analyzed, not quaffed. As I reflect upon the greatness that is Westmalle I am content with a single glass of this liquid alchemy."
"Thanks to HardTarget for generously sharing this fine beer."
"A 3.5 for drinkability, because it's good... but not a session beer, and at $4.99 a bottle, I wouldn't get this again for a long while (too many others to try, too)."
"Hazy, murky, light chocolate brown with a large head. The foam fell to a table after a minute or so, some lace. Smell is dark fruits, and not much else. Not a big nose either. Taste is all bubbly candi and malt up front with some candied yeast following, finish is creamy, slick and carbonic. Medium mouthfeel. Pleasant drink but at $5 per 330ml this is nowhere near a bargain. I'm thinking those boys at Unibroue got something going on that I like better than what the monks are doing and they're doing it a whole lot cheaper."
"330 mL, bottle conditioned, best before 7/20/06, served slightly chilled in a Chimay chalice. The body is a deep brownish-red and the fluffy, tan head peaks at 1 inch, leaving nice lacing on the glass. Wonderful aroma - figs, plums, cherries, molasses, yeast, bananas, band-aids.... lots of phenols with a candy sweetness. The flavor has all this plus a mild bitterness. Warming with a full body that starts off fairly carbonated, but becomes smooth. Very nice ale - wish it didn't cost $5 a bottle."
"This beer poured from a bottle into a tulip glass deep brown in color , slightly hazy with mild copper/orange highlights. It was topped by a tan head composed of dense bubbles. The nose has a great yeast/dough character backed by the malt in the form of caramel, and an earthy finish. The flavor has the same caramel malt, and the earthy tones are even more enhanced. Towards the finish, some characteristics of wine come in with some cabernet and black cherry. The mouth feel is smooth up front, but a sharp finish as some citrus hop kicks in. Dubbel has become one of my favorite styles, and I enjoy this beer very much."
"Drinkability: It's five times the price of New Belgium's version, which I think blows it away. You tell me."
"Thanks to Stonecrusher for the trade"
"New to reviewing, but I had to say this about this beer....WOW!!!! I was given a bottle and now I can't wait to find more. Definitely the best beer I have ever tried and the one thing that I can say to describe this lucious nectar is ""BALANCE"""
"330ml, pours ruddy brown with a swiftly dissipating (possibly due to the pint glass?) head, which has varied-size bubbles of very light tan. Scent is lightly alcoholic, phenolic perhaps? Raspberry--no! Blackberry! Smooth malty esthery taste all over. Generally light; I look forward to the tripel for more intensity. Nice but not the best."
" I was not displeased with this double. I was; however, caught off guard by the excessive alcohol taste. But after a few sips from my westmalle chalice I quite enjoyed this brew."
"From notes. The beer poured a dark brown color with a finger of tan head. The nose was molasses sweet wtih some grape rind and fig characters with a slight sugary sweetness. The flavor was figgy, slightly souring on the finish and a little light on the flavor for me. The feel was moderate and bubbly. The flavor and the nose were really nice. I will definately have to visit this one again."
"Highly recommended."
"This brew is a murky dark-brown color, big tan head on top leaves behind some lace. Sweet malts on nose, as well as some dark fruits. Sweet caramel malt front, candies, fruits, alcohol spiciness, some bittering effects from the hops. Mouth is full and round. Beer is sweet and delicious."
"Overall, I'd have to say that this is a great beer, and one that I'm really enjoying. Gonna have to get some more."
"Pours a garnet red into the Westmalle chalice with a cream-coloured head that diminishes to bubbles along the surface. Little yeasty bits floating about as well. Dark fruits and alcohol in the nose. Nice and complex taste. Dark fruits with some definite nutty hints coming in before going back to the dark fruit and finishing with a gentle warming alcohol finish. Nice mouthfeel and rather drinkable. I approached this one cautiously (after having sampled an off Tripel) but this was very tasty and will be buying this again (along with giving the Tripel another go). Very nice."
"Kind of a thin head that died quickly. The smell of alcohol was very strong. Reddish color with decent mouthfeel. It could maybe use a few more bubbles. Good flavor. I need to take a bee tasting classs casue I can't tell ya what the heck the flavors are. Definitely a good representation of a dubbel. I would buy this again."
"This went down pretty easy, but there's just enough dark fruity bitterness to keep me from saying it went down like candy. A novice craft beer drinker might find it too bitter for them, but that's not saying much. For me, it's just fine. Made a nice beer for christening my St.Bernardus goblet, too, since I can't find any St.B's around here at the moment."
"Body is medium and thirst quenching, easy carbonation, creamy texture. Finish with some dry, oaky sherry notes and spicy hops. A delightful dubbel in every respect. A benchmark of the style!"
"Appearance is dark brown and poured a fine 3 finger head. Not leaving much lacing behind. The nose is so very interesting, primarily detecting the sweet fruits with perhaps a hint of vanilla. Taste is of sweet wonderful malts and finishes with a ever so subtle dry hop and hint of alcohol. Mouthfeel is very smooth and full and pleasantly lively on the palate. Overall drinkability is near perfect, easy to take in all the complexities it has to offer!"
" Overal I think this scores a 4.0."
"Not a dubbel I would seek out, but a nice beer nonetheless."
"very good dubbel."
"Beer is good. Happy beering."
"This Dubbel is very enjoyable, but after having the Tripel, I expected a bit more depth and some bold flavors. A tad understated, but still a nice quaff."
"Drinkability: Not cheap and relatively hard to find in this area, but it has good drinkability and if it weren't so damn pricey, I'd drink this a lot more often. Great Belgian offering"
"I probably won't buy any Westmalle again, even though I quite enjoyed this and the tripel. I simply feel that there are much better products on the market for the money, whether they are authentic trappist products or not. This should not discourage you from trying it anyway, though if you are seeking out information on the trappist ales, you are likely going to try seek them all out regardless. Happy hunting to you!"
"Hightly enjoyable, simply fantastic. Complex flavors keep your mouth interested, no way to put this down thinking you've got it completely figured out."
"This is a beer I can't even break down into categories. What makes this beer so special to me is that everything works together so brilliantly. The deep brown color capped with a nice tan head, the taste and smell of apples and bananas, it's all here. This is a fabulous beer, and I think it's one of the best trappist beers available. Highly, highly drinkable."
"The body is a bit thin, and the apparent alcohol negatively affects the mouthfeel & drinkability. Overall, a decent but underwhelming brew."
"The pour is a rusty, brown tea color with some haze from the yeast. The rich and ample head lives well within the glass. Sturdy lace adds to the perceived elegance. The nose is vinous and caramel with a touch of sweet tea and slight alcohol. This product bowls me over in the taste department. Im literally dubbel-ed over with its quality. Its fruity (prune and grapes), a bit spicy, with some earthen tones and a solid body that ends clean, dry and crisp with slight alcohol and malts. This is smoother than Barry White."
"Doesn't really have enough to keep me interested and this harshness in the finish is discouraging."
"Poured into my Chimay Chalice with a thick slightly tan head that subsided slowly atop a deep hazy brownish red brew. The aroma was aparant immediatly upon pouring as the fruity esters and dark fruits seemed to jump from the glass. Upon closer inspection a slight malt could be detected along with an alcoholic touch. The taste was very balanced and complex with an initial rush of sweet malt and dark fruit flavors which quickly segued into an effervescent rush of carbonation which seeme do have a bit of hop bitterness in it as well finishing dry and clean. The mouthfeel was excellent as this ale had a delicate creamy texture to it and the effervescent carbonation created a very delicat balance. An excellent trappist ale I would definely include this ale if I were hosting a Belgian Beer tasting as it is approachable and also indicitive of belgian brewing."
"ABV is moderate, but I was really felling it even after the first few sips. Very warming, very smooth, extremely enjoyable."
"A very good and drinkable beer."
"Not my favorite. Has a very dry, spicy flavor. Alchol is big and present. Not enough extra stuff going on to mask the Alcohol. Looks nice in the glass, nice head and all, but that's about it as far as postives go. Maybe I just don't like Belgian beers?"
"I did not really care for this one. Oh sure it looked decent when first poured into the Westmalle goblet. Nice warm brown, creamy off-white head. But it left no lace in a beer clean glass. smell was yeasty with hints of alcohol and some fruit. Taste was a disappointment. May have turned on me. not sure. It was not sweet like I expect a dubbel to be and was not syrupy in the way of mouth feel. Too dry, and yeasty/doughy with some hints of coffee/cocoa in the finish."
"I enjoyed this one on a Sunday afternoon, from a large tulip glass. The color is a deep, mysterious chestnut brown, topped with an astounding, off white head. Theres not so much lacing, as a thick growth of foam trailing down the sides of the glass. The appearance of this brew is exceptional. The aroma is of sweet sugars, toasted malts, yeast, and spice. Taste is grain, ripe fruit, sugar, and malt. Esters and spice and sweetnessat times it seemed almost cola-like, a characteristic that I didnt really enjoy. Full mouthfeel, with a creamy texture and only moderate carbonation. Its a fine brew, but somehow not up to expectations."
"A great beer, very drinkable, never disappoints."
"This is a great beer. You really don't have to read any more than that, go get yourself one! It has a dark opaque orange/brown color and a mamouth creamy head. The aroma was quite nice, sweet malty goodness. I smelled some apple and citrus too. The taste is in a word, sweet. Some noticable hops, but the overiding taste, and the one that lingers is one of sweetness. Great beer."
"The smell is nice, containing candy sugars and hints of alcohol. Its only weakness is that it's a little too weak. The taste is quite good. Flavors bring malt behind more candy sugar. Alcohol is barely detectable. The mouthfeel is fairly full while the drinkability is outstanding."
"overall, it's very good and worth a try."
"Not a bad drink, still quality, but not something I'll be searching for again."
"This was a dark mahogany color with a large, persistent, light tan head. There was a lot of dark sediment at the bottom of the bottle. It has a great spicy, yeasty smell. The flavor is fruity and spicy. Good, but I was expecting better. The mouthfeel is a little thin for my taste. Drinkability is not great."
"Pours a cloudy, impenetrable ruby under a one finger tan head that fades slowly (but does fade) to thick film, leaving a bit of lace. Fairly distinct caramel and plum nose, quite pleasant. Very prickly and fairly light in the mouth. Nice, subtle brew, with a bit of sweetness from both the fruit and the malt. A bit like carbonated grape juice, but with enough malt to give it some backbone. There are hops here, too, even deeper in the background, lending just an echo to the taste as the liquid goes down. The aftertaste is ever so slightly bitter, with a more ample dose of fruity sweetness. Very pleasant, perhaps even classy product."
"This is a really good and musty beer, very fruity and delicious. Worth every penny hehe ;)"
"First sip reveals average body and fine yet prickly carbonation. Flavor is complex and starts fruity sweet with berry and cherry flavors mixing with biscuity yeast, almost like a scone. SOme tart astringent flavors as well which make me pucker just a bit. I get peppery spicincess and a drying finish allowing a white grape flavor to come through. A very interesting brew that is not overwhelming. Could be a good crossover brew??"
"The drinkability is good for this type of beverage."
"Drinkability: Pretty good, but despite its relatively low alcohol content, I want to drink this slowly. I don't think I would want more than one of these in a sitting. Just too strong in flavor for that, but I will definitely try this again."
"11.2 ounce bottle. Label says Alc. 7% Vol and has a date of 27/03/03 on it. The label is different than that pictured. Not the most complex of the trappist dubbels. More alcoholic than most, yet still maintaining a nice complexity of flavors. A nice dubbel, but not the best."
"Drinkability: Well-structured beer; complex and satisfying; would be better with a more complete finish"
"Overall, a darn good dubbel here. I'm definitely going to revisit this one in the near future, although the price, while not too high, isn't exactly cheap either..."
"deep dark red brown beer with a nice full white head. full, horsey, barnyard yeast aromas dominate with some sweet malty notes in the back. Good rich mouthfeel with excellent carbonation. The tastes are at different times citrusy, breadlike and spicey with apricot and grape flavors. Finishes clean and dry well balanced. A beer I will enjoy again"
"A deep garnet /ruby colored body with a big tan head. The aroma is sweet dried fruit with some fig and a light underpining of spiceyness. There is a distinct chocolate characteristic at the start of the taste followed by a fizzy burst of carbonation at the back of the tongue and then there is the light fig sweetness on the finish. Quite enjoyable."
"Taste is malty-chewy and syrupy but with a dry finish. Only the good expensive beers are able to do this. This is another of the good ones. Oooh --I should buy more than one next time."
"Dark muddy red color and tall beige colored head made this an attractive looking beer. The aroma was spicy and malty with notes of cocoa, cinnamon, and plums. The taste was sweet and fruity with cherries, apples, and pears. The mouthfeel was thin and hollow and was clearly the weakest point of this beer. Very light and drinkable for a 7% ABV ale, but not the best Dubbel Ive had."
"Dark brown in hue with a tawny-ruby influence, I could see a few chunks of yeast floating in the liquid, oops! Still Id say the beer is largely clear. The head is off-white in color, almost beige, at the apex the head reached one finger in height and it quickly faded to a half finger cap, this remained for the entire consumption. Impressive. Subsequent lacing was splotchy and it clung poorly. Still this is a good-looking beer, largely because the head held like cement. The nose is very enjoyable, the potency isnt as loud as Id like but Im picky. The aromas included a fantastic malty base, rich and chocolately like a cookie. Nutty. Toffee. If this was all the bouquet offered Id be happy. But Im elated because there is a hell of a lot of fruity aromas! Including cherries, dates, raisins, grapes (yes, there is a difference between raisins and grapes), apples infused with figs, coriander and brandy. Nice! As a whole, the nose is a malty harvest! The palate doesnt live up the nose. Its not close really. The bouquet told me, big, malty backbone rich, flavorful. It was not. I found the malt to be thin and not that flavorful. Sure, it is good but not that yummy. The alcohol is a little too naked as well; this hurts the fruity qualities, which is a shame. I can find some nuttiness, bitter chocolate that is not very rich. There is some astringency that is vague and aimless, it cant find a partner to dance with. Clovey. Fruitiness is a mix of bananas with a very weak kiss of grapes and apples. On the whole the palate is good but nothing more, it lacks pizzazz for one thing but the weakness of the malt is really disappointing. For a Dubbel it is average, decent. The mouthfeel is too thin. Again more malt please. Medium-light in body with zesty carbonation, the bubbles feel small but active. This aspect of this beer is satisfactory. I dont really care for the tacky aftertaste. Sure this beer is drinkable; I found it quite pleasant and enjoyable. I have to mention a bottle in Omaha runs $5.00. With that in mind, it is not *that* drinkable! I can buy a six-pack of New Belgiums (much tastier) Dubbel for $6.50. It is a no-brainer as to what beer Id select in the future. Bottom line, it is a good beer but nothing special and nothing I think I will seek out again (unless it is much cheaper at Johns in Iowa City)."
"Pours a dark mahogany, the head is nice and lacy, sticks around a good long while. Smell is exquisite, scents of currant, anise and chocolate, truly a decadent whiff. Taste is awesome, both full and spicy, creamy mouthfeel. An overall excellent beer."
"Taking a better look in the beercellar I saw that there were still 6 bottles left of Westmalle Dubbel that went over the best before date. Off course I decided to open up 1 and find out how they were aging. Opening it carefully I found out that it had a little gushing but with the glass nearby no problem. For the rest the beer ( best before 21/5/04) was still in a perfect condition. Great hoppy smell and a great taste of candice sugar fermentation, malts and hop. Altogether it came very hamonic. I realy enjoyed drinking it and I wondered how it could be that I didn't drink one earlier, cause it's just a great beer! Probably its because I love their triple so much that I forgot how good the double is.... and am sure the rest of my stock Westmalle double won't last that long."
"Strong carbonation and flavour. Residual spice, great lacing in chestnut brown. Sweet and spicy. Cocoa, berries that seem and smell like wine but only a small percentage.Had a bottle after three years and it was a good wine. Great yeast craftmanship."
"Freshness dating of 8/19/2005. Bottle lists ABV at 7%. Pours a clouded burnt sienna color with a fluffy, big beige head. Aromas are deep, malty and yeasty. Slight suggestions of husk, spice and sun-dried dark fruit. Head retention is good even in the wide-lipped Westmalle chalice. Initial sip implies a slight anise and husky dark malt in flavor, finishing clean and slightly dry. Further tastes include notes of sweat, yeast, plum skins, and a metallic twang that comes from an active carbonation and coincides well with the evident huskiness. Faint woody esters come into play. Very nice and pleasurable to drink."
"Taste is also fruity but also metallic. Caramael and nutty. Some molasses and barnyard funk. But the flavors are tame and the mouth is thin. Watery. Not at all what I was expecting. a light metallic and sticky aftertaste. It's not even that tasty. Very disappointed in this one. Enjoyed the tripel, really did not care for the dubbel at all."
"Not bad. Poured a dark reddish brown with a monster fluffy sandy coloured head that stayed for a long time. Plenty of thick, sticky lacing on the sides of the glass. The smell wasn't very impressive. It wasn't terrible, it just didn't seem to me to have a smell worthy of a 4+ rating. A little hoppy. Little raisin like. That's it. Perhaps it's just this particular bottle. The taste, however, was very good indeed. A little bit of cooked apples, a little bit of raisins. Plenty of yeast. (Hey, it's Belgian). Very smooth. Not a ton of carbonation, so it was easy to drink. Over all, pretty damn tasty. Oh yeah, and my bottle says 7.0%abv, not 6.5%. Slight change in recipe, perhaps? New discovery made at the brewery? Just a mistake?"
"Hmm. Interesting, but not impressive. I love their triple even though I don't really care for triples, now I am not impressed by their dubbel although I love dubbels. I am left thinking that either this bottle has had a rough life or other people will worship any monk droppings. I will try this again at a later date and hope for better things."
"Pours a chocolate brown color with a massive invincible head that lasts to the bitter end and gobs and gobs of lace. Theres apples, cinammon, raisins, dark chocolate and passionfruit in the nose. The flavor is remarkably complex (like the smell). Its replete with the fruits detected on the nose as well as berries and an alcohol twang. Its extremely refreshing, my only fault with the taste is that the alcohol is a little strong tasting for its low ABV. Many Belgian brews with much higher ABVs conceal them better than this. Thats a very minor imperfection and this beer is still excellent. Very refreshing, though as far as Dubbels go, Maudite is still the best."
"berries."
"When poured it was a medium dark brown with loads of off white foam. The smell was of roasted malts and hops. The flavor was of toasty toffee/caramel with soft malts and hops. Well balanced and very pleasant to the palate. In the end, this dubbel was darkm full-bodied with hints of toffee."
"This is a beautiful beer with a rich red-brown color crowned with thin tan lace that leaves sticky swirls on the inside of the glass. It has a full nose of sweet malted barley, and of carmel. The taste is divine. Sweet carmel and molasses intertwine with notes of brown sugar, nutmeg, raisin, cherry, prune and sweet bread pudding. This is decadent and satisfying. The mouthfeel is nice because it is not as heavy as you'd expect for all these rich flavors. This makes it easily drinkable, and a wonderful example of a Belgain Dubbel."
"Meh. Not crazy about this."
"I have waited too long to try this beer. Pours out a reddish brown color with a huge beautiful off white head. The smell is amazing. Soft, sweet, malt with a touch of fruityness. Wow! The taste is not what I expected. Unlike anything I have ever had. Raisins, figs, earthyness, and some citrus coming through. Carbonation is sharp in the beginning then gives way to a big warming feeling at the end. So smooth and so balanced. I am guessing the alcohol notes would mellow out with a bit of aging. Even after some time, the head stays creamy, smooth and fully entacted. One of my new favorite beers. I can't wait to try more trappist ales."
"11.2oz. bottle poured into a chalice. It pours a murky dark brown color with three fingers of fluffly light tan foam. There is lots of lacing left on the glass. The smell is very malty, with sweetness of caramelized sugar and fruity esters. A little spicy on the nose too. The taste is also fairly malty and a little sweet, but with a slightly tart and dry finish. It doesn't hide the alcohol well, and it's only 6.5% abv. The mouthfeel is just a little on the light side, especially for the style. The drinkability fairs pretty well though, not too shabby. A fair dubbel."
"Pours a dark rich brown with a HUGE frothy head that took long enough to subside that one could make a sandwich, clean up and have a smoke before it would be half way down. Smell is rich of Chocolate,Caramel, and Dried fruit. Taste is Rich and full with lite brown sugar notes with some lightly brandied fruit and a touch of breadiness. Drinks smoothly with just a hint of alcohol on the tongue. A definate post dessert. Would go great with a nice rich cigar sitting on the deck with old friends.. A tasty treat, not as good as the triple... but holds its own."
"The beer pours a dark brown color with a thick frothy offwhite head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is great. It has an awesome pale and Belgian crystal malt scent with a tart, yet fruity Belgian yeast finish. The taste is good. It has a creamy brown ale flavor with a tart, fruity Belgian yeast finish. It goes down easy and finishes creamy and dry. The mouthfeel is exceptional. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a damn good beer. It has aroma, flavor, and mouthfeel; a fine sessions brew."
"This was the first Trappist beer I ever tried when I was in Belgium last year- and so it has a special place in my heart.l But I waited a year and tried some other Dubbels and Belgian Brown ales before I reviewed this puppy. Presentation 11.2 oz bottle. Pours a medium brown, somewhat clear, but that's because I kept the inch (that much?) of yeast sediment from pouring into the glass. Head was a surprising mix of large and small bubbles, off-white/tan, that looked more like a soda pop head than a beer head. Aroma is the best feature of this beer. Bready with a light sweetness, malty, pleasant gentle chocolate. Aroma follows through into flavor; here some pepper also comes through. However, the alcohol isn't hidden as much as I would like, thus negatively affecting the balance (in my humble opinion). Still very good and I will gladly drink more, but would like it toned down a bit. As it warmed, it seemed there was almost some smokiness coming through (I don't think this is quite right, but I can't find a better descriptor). Maybe a bit of aging helps mellow and balance it a bit."
"330ml Best by date 19/08/05 Poured a hazy reddish brown with a thick dense head and looking very inviting. Aroma is both fruity and spicy with a peppery note. Flavor is slightly vinous, malty and notes of burnt sugar. The body is quite effervescent and with a lively carbonation. I was surprised at the vinous characteristics this Dubbel had. Overall a complex one for sure, maybe the most complex Ive had thus far."
"Pours a very sexy brown with a big tan full head. Very smooth with a wonderfully well crafted sweet malt flow over perfect balance. This is a top notch beer with a full flavor profile. All should try this brew. It is a shame that these beers are oh so very hard to find in the states."
"Smooth and candy sweet, with a scotch like flavor due to the alcohol. Very well balanced. One of the best doubles I've had."
"Uniqueness is redefined. A beer that begins its existence in the shadow of its world reknowned big brother has its standards set high before the bottle is even opened. Eager this one is to prove its worthiness. As I crack the top of the signature Westmalle bottle, a volcano erupts reaching for the heavens catching me off guard and making for a sloppy beginning to the pour. Let it be said now, that this, if any was the only flaw I could find with this beer. The final pour resulted in a deep, earthy, reddish-brown body with a lively light beige head that calms quickly, as if to show reassurance in my snifter being its final resting place. The smell dominately sweet, but beyond that nearly indescribable. Imagine smelling every fruit in existence exclusively and all together at the same time--Fruitopia of the Gods. The taste reflects the nose with a symphony of sweetness which is obviously the masterful combination of malts with the trademark belgian touch of sugar and spices. The sweetness is not out of control and there is a hint of yeast and a slight bitterness and crispness to the finish. Mouthfeel is medium in body and very smooth. As far as drinkability goes, I could drink this beer all night with or without food, in a pub or at home, and with a fox or in a box. Praise to Westmalle once again!"
"Frothy beige tuick 1/2 inch head. Slight toasted caramel/brown sugar nose. Hazy opeque dark brown look in the goblet. Lasting head and white lace on the goblet. Slight sweet nutty (hazel) taste with a dry tongued slightly sweet burnt caramel finish. Medium to lighter mouth with a lively carbonation feel. Slight touch if blueberry in the finish."
"Its rather drinkable..but that fact in itself tells a tale..i found this nice but dull. Maybe I got a bad bottle..but this was not exciting as i expected..or the price suggested!"
"This is a very good beer that can be enjoyed as a winter warmer. It's versatile enough to be consumed virtually anytime of the year."
"What a suprise to find a case of this sitting in my local beer store today! I love the tripel (in my top 5), so I grabbed one of these up to try. In the middle of a 750 of Val Dieu brown (an excellent brew in it's own right) I drank this. It is fantastic. Tastes as much like a dark Belgian as a dubbel. Better than the Val Dieu, and better than Chimay Red or Maudite, IMO. Nice dark, fruity taste. Wonderful balance and taste. A little expensive at $4.99 a bottle, but I'll be buying 1 or 2 of these each time I go to that store (and I asked him to get the tripel, also!)."
"No Advocates, the numbers don't lie, I friggin liked a Belgian!! This beer was a dark amber brown with a big thick head. Chunks of lace clung here and there to the glass. Aroma was strong and yeasty, but lacked the spicy clovy notes that have turned me off to other beers from this country. Taste was very smooth, had a yeasty bite but was not riddled with cloves, bananas and spices. I detected a solid malt base with a yeast presence. Some slight raisiny fruitiness was good. At 7% it has a bite, but not overpowering. I found this very drinkable. Enjoyed this as an after dinner drink, and is a Belgian ale I will be sure to have again. Finally!"
"Though not quite as good as the tripel, this is still a damn good beer nonetheless. A nice plum sweetness makes this a beer that I'll certainly be having in the future."
"CO2 bubbles stream to the surface of this crimson colored brew at a very rapid pace. The body of this beer is topped of with a gigantic mousse-like light brown head. The retention is excellent. There are nice aromas of chocolate, yeast, must, chalk and candy. The flavors are a little bready, chalky and dry. Alcohol presence is really kept in check. Some bubblegum makes an appearance as well. Mouthfeel is lightly carbonated. And the body is light-medium. This is enjoyable."
"A fine dubble. One of my favorites actually. Will have again."
"The aromas are of concentrated, very ripe fig, plum and wild berries joined by nutmeg, toffee and malt. The flavors are bold and stately, with a glycerin-packed texture that reveals hints of seasoned wood, brandy, grape skins and currants. Balanced to perfection between boozy, brandied fruits and finely milled, papery tannins."
"Loads of fruit here, along with a hint of chocolate. Quite tasty. Soft, medium bodied, intense carbonation."
"Alcohol is hidden well and the not so much ""in your face"" flavors lead to outstanding drinkability."
"Dark sludgy brown with rusty, tawny reddish edges, great cap of fluffy firm tan foam ever so tall and present, creepingly settling to an ever present murky skim and finely stitched lace sticks. Aroma is intially soft and ripe of fruits giving a blend of mango, grapes, passion, and pear skins. A nice earthy dusting of dry yeast and bread crusts settles across the top after a bit with ever so present gleams of candied sugars. Taste is plump and a bit overcarbonated which gets in the way for me with every sip, as soon as I begin to get something out of it taste wise, the carbonation wipes it away far to quickly. A bit too sharp for my tastes. Perhaps an aged bottle of a year or more would help as this was bottled 2004. What is there for tastes are some dullish fruity malts in a darker realm of plum, raisin, and dry figs, mixing a bit inbetween some pear and cherry pieces. Slight cocoa and a firm earthy yeasty dryness with just a pinch of spice and walnut skin dryness finish it out. Very nice finish. Body is full with a bit much on the carbonation scale which has a scratchy/chalky-like coat on the way down which sorta blends into the complex drying qualities in the finish after awhile, which I actually liked, so that made up for some of my dissatisfaction in the carbonation dept.. Overall, this is one to come back too, with age, I think this might round or smooth out and be one fun and fine ale to behold."
"Pours a darker shade of brown with a nice fluffy/sticky head you can tell this well made by the pour alone.Anyways I get a deep brown sugar aroma a red wine hint almost like a port wine.Taste of spiced cake and raisins,very rich tasting.A little harsh in the mouth though wasnt as smooth and creamy as expected.Aroma and flavor wise a real top notch brew but in drinkability and mouthfeel it lacks in my opinion."
"Pours a huge light brown, five finger-head leaving just traces of lace, pour slowly. Deep ruby color. Good carbonation. Medium bodied. Starts malty and sweet, finishes with a good mix of hops and malt but a slightly hoppy aftertaste. My 100th Belgian and not a bad one in the bunch. The ABV is 7.0%. $5.39 for a 330ml bottle."
"*this is one of my first belgian brews - excuse my lack of experience in this area."
"I drank this beer within the posted freshness date and noted no telltale signs of spoilage. I can only conclude that on the whole this is a rather ho-hum brew from the good brothers at Westmalle whose reputation for excellence is not upheld by this rather uninspired twice-fermented ale."
"These Belgian ales are all so different. The dubbel and trippel classifications don't even tell you that much. Just be ready to sit and sip and enjoy. This one is definitely a winner."
"Really a superb dubbel. This is simply the blue print by which all other dubbels are based. I could drink this all day long."
"The packaging may have set me up to expect too much. Raised embossed bottle, with paper label overlay probably to meet export label standards - the hallmarks of a quality imported Belgian ale. I suppose I've come to expect all Belgian Trappists to be really good beers, so this was a letdown when it came in at a bit above average. The flavor was rather blunt and simple - not much in the way of spicyness or depth of the malt and yeast interplay. Some rough, dark orchard fruit and a bit of caramel to the malt. Sharply fizzy, with good head retention."
"Bottle  Poured a red/brown quite opaque brew with a huge head with standard retention. Great carbonation with strong body. Aroma is very spicy with no alcohol noticeable. Taste is great with the usual Belgian style mix of malts and hops with some added roastiness to that one. The spice mix is a bit stronger then expected but overall very enjoyable. Overall, this is a good beer but I was expecting something greater from this well known Trappist."
"This beer pours a dark brown color with a nice fluffy head and leaves some lacing on the sides of the glass. The aroma was yeasty with fruits and caramel. The flavor was quite sweet and filled with caramel tones. I had higher expectations for this. It's a great beer, but it can't hold ground against others in the same category."
"We finally can get this again in the US. The last time I had this was on tap in London. Anyway. This one is a nice dark brown color with a dense tan head. Smell is dense and of bready malts and fruity esters mixed with some yeast and sugar. Taste is incredibly smooth with touches of vanilla, chocolate, and great Belgian yeasts. Amazing. One of my favorite beers. Goes great with moules and frites."
"The flavor here is a simple smooth blend of basic tasty elements. The malt goes through a progression of flavor phases, and they end up leaving a very good impression overall. At the same time, and in a smaller way, the simplicity doesn't do a lot to make it stand out. Drinking it is easy enough, and certainly not disappointing, yet I'm just okay with the idea of having another, not all moony faced and ga-ga. In a nutshell, I'm not floored, but there's nothing that puts a true black mark on its permanent record, so let's face it, it's not bad at all."
"Westmalles dubbel is a nice brew thats pretty easy to drink but the rather heavy sweetness wouldnt have me drinking much more than one before Id feel kinda full. All in all, a good beer but I expected a bit more balance."
"The mouthfeel is smooth with a dry finish. The caramel and bread tones last long on the tongue after swallowing. The alcohol not noticebale at all. This is an exceptional drinking dubbel."
"On-tap at Lucky Baldwin's Belgian Festival. It's a somewhat murky brown with traces of red. Ripe fruit is present in the smell and taste. Althought it's a very nice beer, my expectations were a bit elevated and the taste didn't quite come through like expected. Everything works nicely together, but it's not a world-beater."
"A bit blander than I recall, lack or flavour and aroma, too fizzy and not as smooth"
"A rage of activity here. Intense carbonation produces a volcanic like oooze of foam as it rests in glass awaiting tasting. The head is stiff and alive-it has taken on a soft serve ice cream appearance, and it seems I will have to lick my way to the beer. Aromatics are difficult to peg through the mountain of thick foam. Some warm malty banana, raisinet, creamy dark chocolate, blue cheese-quite fruity. The mouthfeel is crisp, dry, rather complex, full bodied, and quite creamy. Malty flavors and fruity dark chocolate flavors dominate. Much like eating a very fine dark chocolate with a raspberry filling. Bitter chocolate, dusty malt notes and a very fine champagne like bubble make for a charming and memorable finish. I'll try this one again fer sure."
"Poured very carefully into a goblet, still produces a large, billowy beige head on top of a mahogany body. Nice Belgian aroma of vanilla, prunes, bananas, coriander, and allspice. Mouthfeel is highly carbonated, and silky. Taste begins with a spicy, earthiness. Plenty of dark fruits like raisins and figs are in a constant battle with the yeasty woodiness, and spice array. Sheets of Belgian lace are all over the goblet. Alcohol is concealed very well. Seems overly carbonated for a Belgian Dubbel, or maybe it's my imagination. Very nicely balanced, otherwise, and another fine, smooth, satiny, Belgian dubbel ale that is ideal on a cold winter evening."
"Highly carbonated, providing a huge head, and releasing a very nice caramel aroma with underlying dark fruits. The flavor is very complex begining with chocolate before a spicy middle and followed by a cherry finish. Very interesting with many more flavors than I can hope to name, but not nearly as good as I had hoped."
"World class."
"This beer exploded with a frothy head, I should have poured more carefully. I am new to this style of beer, but I am very impressed , as I should be for 5 dollars a single. Appearance is deep ruby with a yeasty haze and a thick, overwhelming head. Very bubbly. Smells fruity and intense. Taste is mostly of tart cherry, grape and raisin with a bit of nuttiness and alcohol warmth. Complex and bursting with great flavor. Mouthfeel could be silkier but altogether everything wet together to make a very enjoyable beer. I am hiding one in the basement to try in a few years."
"Cheers to monks at Westmalle for creating this masterpiece!"
"Sampled at From The Vine beer tasting Jan 9th, 2004: This brew is a dark brown color with a thick foamy light beige head. Very thin lacing. It has an aroma of fruit, malt and toffee. Medium-bodied and rather smooth with lively carbonation. The flavor consists of fruit (plum was very noticeable), malt, and nuts. The flavors did not seem to play very well together though. The finish has a nice dark fruit character to it though. This beer is decent but I have had better Dubbels."
"Flavors of caramel, light chocolate, fruity esters, and yeast sprites. Plenty of nice, coarse complexity. Smooth full body and crisp edges at the finish. Wonderfully drinkable and enjoyable."
"This beer poured a dark red color and formed an off white thick foamy head that left circular lace when it finally subsided. A medium amount of carbonation and some sediment present. An aroma of malt and fruit with a trace of bread/yeast. A flavor of malt, and some fruit, but the presence of the alcohol overpowers it. The finish is light for the style and sprite. Not as good as the tripel they make."
"Truly amazing beer, really sets the standards for dubbels to follow."
"Nevertheless, a nice brew worth buying."
"i'm really starting to dig the abbey dubbel style more and more. this one pours a cloudy ruby colour with an off-white, moderate sized head that lasts but settles in quite quickly to a thinner head. smells of alcohol, caramel, grapes, cherries, all with a hint of maltiness. the malt is more dominant in the taste along with the caramel, but the other smells are present in taste here as well and present a nice balance which ends with a slightly dry hop finish. this is quite a smooth brew that is creamy but has a bit of a bite from the carbonation at the end. quite enjoyable."
"This was a bottle from 1972 (!) Tasted at Kroegske in 2001. Appearance: Reddish brown, light head, very clear. Aroma; Sherryish, malty, some oxidation. Flavor:rich, sherry-ish old ale flavors; rum, dates, etc. Mouthfeel: light bodied, with mild carbonation. Sherryish finish. Pretty unique!"
"Very dark brown color. Large head, foamy and rich. Aromas are malts, fruity, hint of banana, plums, yeasts and brown sugar. A medium bodied dubbel. Malts are rich and fruity, with chocolate and toffee tones. Yeasty and malty. Nicely balanced. A surprisingly dry dubbel. The dryness balances and highlights the fruity sweetness. Interesting effect. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is dry. Aftertaste is slightly sweet."
"Pours a dark brown, large beige head that mainly lasts and leaves good lacing. Aroma is lightly malty, some dough, banana, and some caramel and honey. Flavor is quite sweet at the start, more fruity in the middle, and ending is dry. Medium-full bodied."
"This beer was quite dry and at first not nearly as complex as I was expecting. The color was solidly amber without much in the way of haze. As it warmed up a bit it began to open up and show what it had to offer. It picked up a hint of sweetness which helped to boost the malt perception. There was a bit of raisin the mouth as well as a finish that was sweet from the alcohol. The aroma too had an alcohol component to it as well as a bit of woodiness. Quite estery tasting without being particularly fruity tasting. There seemed to be some higher alcohols in here as well."
"Wow. Pours a deep mahogany with a gigantic frothy tan head. (I used a brandy snifter since I don't have a chalice). Caramel, fruity aroma. The one thing that struck me about the taste of this beer is that it's extremely comforting for some reason. Figgy, fruity taste with understated chocolate tones. The mouthfeel is out of this world. It's just so smooth. While this isn't one to pound down night after night, this beer is just so drinkable. I'm seriously in Heaven drinking this beer. Spectacular."
"I managed to resist temptation somewhat successfully and age this bottle for about one year before succumbing. Right from the crack of the cap, the beer gives off a pleasant sweet prune-like aroma, undergirded by a distinctively Belgian yeasty maltiness. This dubbel is quite an attractive beer -- deep mahogany in color with a thin, light tan head. The flavor starts off quite sweet, characterized largely by a deep, figgy fruitiness. Combined with the bready body, this gives me the (not unpleasant) impression of Fig Newtons. Toward the end, light chocolatey and toasty notes are noticeable in the background, and the beer finishes with a mild alcohol spiciness. Quite full and body, and luxuriously creamy in mouthfeel. Very, very yummy."
"I stand by my ratings from the initial taste and didnt actually change the score of this beer, but I will say after trying over 200 Belgian Ales since the first review it really is one of the best offerings of the style on the market."
"Small brown bottle. Neck stamped 'trappist"" Cool beans. An agressive pour yeilds a glug glug glug exit from the bottle, and an murky brown color, with a fluffy bubbly biege head that settled to a thin covering very quickly. Lots of candied fruits on the smell, carmelized like the bottom of bananas foster. Super smooth taste, more candied fruit, carmel and bananas. Rum soaked cherries. Little hints of spices, cinammon, etc. Very good, flavor soaked yeasty belgian goodness. Hints of bitterness on the finish, just ever so dry. Very smooth and drinkable. A real treat. This one came compliments of the BelgianBum !"

"Originally sampled on 8 March 2003 at Pizza Port's Belgian beer fest. I am writing this review from my notes. This is a dark brown beer with a lot of fizz in the head. The aroma is full of chocked fruit with notes of chocolate & brown sugar. All in all an enjoyable trappist."
"Pours a ruby-brown color with a huge beige head. Excellent head retention leads to excellent lacing down the glass. Nose includes hints of sweet malt, spices and chocolate. Notes of the sweet malt, very subdued hops, yeast and raisins introduce themselves to the palate. This is a very well balanced dubbel, perhaps the best I've tried so far. The alcohol is definitely there, but hard to pinpoint. Definitely worth seeking out."
"Nice distinct bottle. Pours a beautiful dark brown and a nice tan head. The head goes away. Not much lace. Some vanilla and malt in the nose. Good carbonation malt, chocolate, hint of fruit. More hops than a lot of Belgians. The finish is different and overall the beer comes off as a little watery. Musky, hoppy. This is very good beer."
"The flavor mirrors the aroma with dried cherry and chocolate and some leather tones in the fore palate. The beer quickly transitions into cinnamon and clovey spices. The beer finishes with a brown sugar smack and a warming glow of alcohol in the throat."
"If I had to sum it up, it tastes like spritzy newspaper soaked in cola and smeared with butter and cherry jam. I love dubbels and have had hundreds of them, but honestly, this is probably one of the worst that I've had."
"Drinkability - Give me more and more and more."
"Mouthfeel: highly carbonated (bubbles multiply and expand in your mouth), lots of alcoholic warmth, fairly light body for a dubbel"
"It's a runoff between the Westie and the St. Bernardus Abt 12 in my book, but I think the Westie eeks out ahead. It is perfectly balanced, with subtle fruit tones in the bouquet. Unlike Corsendonk's wine-like aftertaste, the Westmalle leaves you savoring its complexity and wanting more. Be sure to air it out, as it gains more character just below cellar temp. Also, be sure to serve it in the proper glassware... presentation and aroma are everything with a beer this good. Definately a cost-wise alternative to Abbaye des Rocs' offerings."
"I could drink a few of these maybe not in one setting thou."
"ABV was 7% (bottle bought in Finland). This beer pours with an enormous lasting head, cloudy brown colour. Lovely aroma of oak, leather and spices. Well balanced spicy flavour, slightly bitter finish. Aftertaste could have lasted a bit longer, but this is still a thoroughly well made beer."
"This one's about average for a Trappist brew, which means it's above-average when compared to most others..."
"I was very pleased with this brew, I recommend it to everyone who haven't tried it. I will most definately buy it again! :))"
"Had at the Taste of Belgium event at Celtic Bayou in Redmond, WA... Poured a cloudy brown with quite a bit of head. Candy sugar and cloveyness come across in the nose. Same flavors are present in the mouth as well where a nice medium bodied beer goes down quite easily. Other flavors include some fruit and a slight spicy twang."
"Burgundy in color with an off-white head. Excellent lacing when sipped down. Has many complex aromas and flavors. The aroma is of sweet candi sugar, fruity banana esters, and somewhat raisin-like. Flavors are sweet, herbal, spicy, and fruity. It is medium-full in body, with a light carbonation. Overall, another excellent Belgian beer. I will definitely drink this one again."
"This beer poored with a good frothy headand had some nice sweet aromas. Flavors of banana and sweet malt were good and made this beer enjoyable. Had some yeast hints on the body of this beer which was nice and rich. This beer overall was a good dubbel and would drink it again."
"such as plum and rasions, medium body with a light bubbly mouthfeel, it finishes rather dry, which is a good thing, not the best trappist but still great."
"Westmalle trappist Double: From a very cool old bottle, with Westmalle embossed in the side. Cloudy brownish beer that leaves a huge head. The aroma was sweet, with hints of the huge malts to come. The taste was a very pleasant malty taste, with chocolate/molasses overlying a biscuity base. Very nice warmth makes this a great beer for a cold night decking out the tree."
"The pour a murky brown color with modest sized dark beige head that is frothy in its texture and the resultant lace a fine velum like sheet to obscure the glass. Nose is lightly tinted with banana, slightly sour, hints of malt. Front is malt laden, and somewhat sweet with the top fair to middling in its feel on the palate. Finish has a prickly acidity and the hops pleasing and delightfully spicy in their bite, the aftertaste is desert bone dry and long lasting, a long favorite and one that has a permanent home in my DBF!"
"Brown coloring with a fine, persistent off-white head. Very, very sweet smelling; raisin/date and dark fruit sweetness are all over the nose. Light-to-medium body; active carbonation. Taste is nowhere near as syrupy and cloyingly sweet as the smell leads you to expect; I find this to be a positive thing. That said, the flavor is primarily more on the sweet side, although it's surprisingly well balanced. A world-class dubbel."
"Persistent beige head sits atop a ruddy, lightly hazy brown brew.  Loose lace is left.  The aroma is dominated by milk chocolate and dark caramel sweetness complemented by surprisingly light banana fruity esters. Slight sour apple tartness eeks into the end of the aroma.  Flavorwise, nutty malt and prune like fruitiness quickly yield to dark, raisiny Special B and mellow chocolate malt.  Sweetness is akin to diluted molasses and is well controlled, not overbearing, but is somewhat one dimensional. Light on the palate all around, smooth in mouthfeel and highly drinkable.  Mild banana ester reemerge in the otherwise neutral and slightly watery finish.  Westmalle's Double is surprisingly understated and shy in malt and yeast character, but is nonethless very well balanced and highly drinkable."
"A semi dark brew with a light brown head that stayed all the way to the bottom. Some banana aromas mixed in with sweet dark malt aromas. Initially this has a sweet dark malty flavor of caramel, and chocolate followed by a prune and banana fruitiness. Ends dry with barely any hop flavor. Not as big flavored as I was expecting but it still left me wanting more."
"Maybe this is too young (bb: 13/05/04).  Nevertheless, I just don't see the flavors here to hold out much prospect."
"Pours with a foamy head and a deep dark amber color.  The earthy alcholic Belgian Aroma is strong, stronger then the flavor for sure.  The heavy malty flavor and obvious Trappist yeast character give way to an earthy brush with a cider-apple flavored finish.  The bottle conditioning has left the carbonation level of the beer a bit too high leavy a harsh mouthfeel, but that is the only downside to this tasty offering."

"I found this awesome brew along with several other fine Belgians in a grocery store in the Netherlands. The average price for a 30cl bottle was about 1.50 Euro or about 1.25 US! That's so sick. Needless to say I stocked up and carried my booty around Europe, drinking some along the way and carrying some home. This fine dubbel, 7.0% abv. for the local market, is outstanding. What a gorgeous brew in the appropriate stemmed glassware. Monster, lumpy ass, misshapen head that did not quit. Quite a rich flavored brew that's deep ruby colored with nutty notes. Molasses also comes to mind. Alcohol is present but blends well with the beer's other complexities."
"Tight carbonation, very foamy.  slight alcohol nose, slightly spicy and peppery.  extremely dry flavor.  light hop bitterness in finish.  distinct raisiney flavors.  Head retention is very strong.  Slight dark malt flavor but not bold or overbearing."
"A tasty Double, dark, rich, but not over the top, maybe a bit better than the triple, but its hard to compare, coz they're both different styles, very tasty beer."
"Very easy to find around Belgium, even in the grocers ... it seemed like this stuff was everywhere. Very smooth and even better on tap in the proper Westmalle glass at the Circo cafe in Brussels."
"Notes: This is just an overall amazing beer. One of the most famous of the Trappist beers, Westmalle Double can be found on tap at many Beglian establishments. 6.5% abv."
