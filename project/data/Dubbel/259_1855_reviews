"O- Another excellent beer from St. Bernardus."
""
"Just okay. Three more words."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Serving type: bottle"
""
"The Dubbel. Almost as good as their Abt 12. (Almost.) Great nose, smooth finish, silky mouthfeel. Like zero aftertaste. A- Belgian."
"Great dubbel. No complaints. Great beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Final Thoughts: Well after a lacklustre start, this beer pulled itself together and produced a genuinely great experience, scoring in my eyes where it counts. This is without a doubt the best St. Bernardus beer I've had thus far. It's a little heavy, but this is a beer you save for a special occasion. Two thumbs up."

"O:  fantastic brew all-around even if it lacks a few things -- mainly that yeasty pop that I'd compare to almost a pizza crust that some dubbels have.  this one doesn't, so it's very sweet and would definitely be an easy brew for the abbey ale novice to get behind (unless they hate sugar); hard not to like and WAY too easy to drink; I could chug this brew, it's so light and drinkable"
""
""
""
"One of my favorite trappiste ales that is as good as the best quads.  Substantial flavor profile & character."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"My favorite of the St Bernardus mixed pack, so far.  Still have the ABT 12 left."
""
"Great beer. More like a Flemish Sour Ale."
""
"One of my all time favs. As close to perfect as a beer can be. Flavors flavors flavors!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O:  holy shnoikies this is good.  So much interesting stuff going on."
""
""
""
"Final Grade: 4.5, a remarkable A grade. Dubbels have never been one of my favourite abbey styles, but this right here? This is a good one. St. Bernardus Prior 8 is probably the more 'traditional' of the two dubbels included in this pack, with a more malt-forward, fruity flavour that includes more residual sweetness and yeasty spice then can be found in the Pater 6. They're both outstanding beers that all Trappist beer fans should consider must-tries, and even though I consider this one to be (objectively) the better of the two, the Pater 6 is still more tailored toward my tastes, and probably my favourite."
"O:  A taste between a Prior 6 and an abt 12.  And there's nothing wrong with that."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a nice and crafted dubbel, good spice and fruity notes, doesn't blow me away though, good incorporation of the alcohol. A good spicy dubbel that drinks well."
""
"This is an outstanding beer.. It's a go to beer! Feel is nice and smooth!! Smells so nice.. Taste is great banana, candy fruits.. It's got it all!"
"O:  Good beer with some drawbacks.  Would have if it was offered to me."
""

"o: a superb dubbel that is full of tasty flavours"

"Enjoy!!"
"Poured a deep and murky brown with a thin tan head that dissipated quite quickly. The smell is mild but with some light dark fruit and some spices. The taste is a little more robust and with a nice light sweetness on the finish. There is a little bit of carbonation on the finish but the body has a nice weight and feel to it."

""
""
""
""
"On tap at the Yard House in Denver. Great beer - what you expect from a Belgian but very smooth and nice to drink."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Fairly nutty taste.  I enjoyed this one a lot."
""
""
""
""
"A solid beer from a solid producer, just considerably less interesting than the Tripel and Abt 12."

"Medium body color, foamy off white head. Very nice aroma - complex malt, bready, nutty. Same flavors in the taste, plus some earthy herbal notes.  Medium body, soft smooth carbonation.  Very nice dubbel, a prime example overall."
"Excellent brew, between a Dubbel and a BDSA, with good complexity and full of flavors and spices. Well balanced and not overly sweet as several other Belgians can be. Ages well. Recommended."
""
""
""
""
"Overall - A great grape/fruity flavour mixed in with the belgian spice mix make this a delicious beer.  Very easy to drink and almost refreshing in a way.  The perfect amount of sweetness as well."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours dark cloudy brown amber with a large beige lasting head, some mild lacing. Dark dry fruit and Belgian yeast as well as some mild fruity alcohol ester fill the senses. Taste is mild toasted caramel malt followed by a mix of dark dry fruit and Belgian yeast, bread notes. Palate is a medium body, smooth mouth feel with good carbonation. Dry fruit, yeast and bread notes with mildly toasted caramel malt and alcohol on the end. A very well made and nicely balanced brew."

"prior 8 is a real delight. i dont know how so much time in beer has gone by without me trying this ever, but it must have somehow slipped through the cracks. shame on me, because this is a real beauty. a classic dubbel in style, maybe the classic version. not quite as legendary as their quad i dont reckon, but its there in quality. dark muddy amber colored brew, hazy with yeast sediment and a speckled off white head, thick and full of tiny bubbles that keep on holding up. notes of dried fruit dominate here, raisins and plums both come to mind, even figs and molasses, the additional sugar here is super raw, and not all the way fermented out by the dusty spicy belgian strain. not a ton of lingering sweetness, appropriate levels for the style, but there is a real richness created in the texture of this beer. a long experience, yeast and grain driven equally, but showing a higher level of refinement than even the offerings from other belgian monastic types. lighter in body than the quad, but still big, maybe a bit more drinkable. the fruit tones are awesome and permanent, this is a memorable brew, drinking well easier than 8% abv. worth double what they ask for it in my opinion."

"Pours a nice dark amber, quite clear with lots of carbonation. A nice beige head forms but turns into spotty lacing barely covering the chalice. Very fragrant with lots of fruit such as figs and raisins followed up by bready aromas. A bit lighter than expected with a touch of sweetness. Despite it's sweetness a touch of bitter is present making this a very refreshing brew. The taste follows through on the nose. There are other many other Dubbel's but this is a solid example that I would be hard pressed to pass up."

"Overall - great dubbel that didn't disappoint."

"Although not visually appealing, this dubbel is redeemed by the overall good taste and palate. It is slightly sweet, but never too sweet, as dates often are. Overall, a very pleasant brew."
""
""
""
""
"One of two regular dubbel offerings from St. Bernardus. Single bottle snagged from a mixed 6-pack and poured into a goblet. A murky light cola brown brew with a large beige head. Aroma is intensely spicy and fruity but with a rum and raisin meets chocolate malt undertone; smells a bit ""darker"" than some other dubbels but with a pleasant rock candy sweetness. This translate well to the palate and I am enjoying where this particular Belgian is going. Brown bread, clove oil, perhaps some dried apricot or papaya and a unique note that recalls chocolate macaroon. Remains only semi-sweet, however, with the chocolate coconut and cola-like brown spice flavors remaining on the dark side of the ledger as opposed to the cloyingly sweet. Rather brisk carbonation and the body is a hair heavier than other dubbels, yet the drinkability remains high like Chimay Red. Finishes on the dry side as well but with some lingering vanilla and dry chocolate wafer notes. I like this beer as a bridge between the lighter-bodied dubbels and some of the heavier Belgian dark ales. Great balance of sweet and bitter."
""
"An impressive dubbel. Nice aromas and flavors with a refreshing mouthfeel."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Refreshing and fruity dubbel. Highly drinkable."
""
""
""
"This pours a dark brown color with a highly carbonated tan head. Smell is sweet and malty. The taste is disappointing as there really wasn't much complexity and flavor I expect from belgian beers. This was light bodied, which could be considered good to some, but for the style i'm expecting a fuller beer. The taste I did get was a little bit a chocolate and slight bit of dark fruits. Overall, this is an solid beer, but I wouldn't take it over most belgian dubbels. (84/100)"

"33cl bottle (30 03 18) into a goblet. Amber brown with one finger tan head with good retention and lacing. Smell and taste have moderately sweet roasted caramel malts with spice and raisins. Roasted malts and raisins on the semi dry aftertaste. Became sweeter as it warmed up. Creamy mouthfeel, medium body and medium-high carbonation. Very drinkable with well hidden alcohol. Quite a lot of yeast in the bottle. A really nice dubbel that's not too sweet."

"My beer guru invited me over to split a few beers and rolled out this one. Wow, great looking and smelling beer with an even better taste. hard to be critical but maybe a little thin. Very smooth and easy to drink, overall an excellent beer and one I hope to revisit."

"O: Did I pour it wrong, did I get the bottom of the barrel - what is with all this yeast? Like whoa. Otherwise this is an excellent dubbel with a subdued character that hits all the right notes. I was impressed by the spiciness provided by the yeast - that said I apparently got an ounce of yeast in my 330mL."

"O-Another great dubbel by St Bernardus"
"O - Only slight flaw that I found was on the feel, and that may be fixable. I have had some truly delicious dubbels lately, and they are fast becoming one of my favorite styles. This is certainly right up there with the finest examples."
""
""
""
"A terrific Dubbel. Definitely preferable to the Prior 8 offering. It has more of a malt presence, added sweetness, and a richer flavor. Definitely recommended for those who enjoy dark Belgian strong ales in the Abbey style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Peace"
"O: Pretty good, definitely not their best or second best, but worth a try (I suggest the small bottles unless you really like the style a lot), recommended."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Fantastic, another home run from St. Bernardus. Possibly one of my favorite Belgian breweries."
""
""
""
"Pours a very dark brown color with a solid, pillowy head that drops to a thin beige film on the surface. Beautifully rich, creamy-smooth aromas of figs, raisins, brown sugar, nuts, spiced apple cider, and yeast. Flavor is sweet brown bread, mellow spices, and apple and banana yeast esters. Raisin and clove phenolics on the back end along with some black pepper and a slight cherry tartness. Dry, prickly, medium-fullish body. Lots of character...good Dubbel!"
""
""
"However, all in all a top drink if not as good as some of its stablemates."
""
"Uma boa cerveja, mas um tanto distante da abt 12. Mas mesmo assim ela cerveja interessante. Longe de ser uma das to of mind do estilo, mas um bom rótulo para compor o time da St. Bernardus, que com certeza é uma das mais respeitadas cervejarias da Bélgica."
""
""
""
""
""
"O. I like drinking this one @ my band practice, it's a fun social beer"
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a perfect example of the style just more subtle with a tempered personality."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Satisfying and very enjoyable. One of the more solid examples. Worth many trips back."
""
"Dirty brown color and fairly opaque. Big poofy head is slightly off white in color. Aroma is harmoniously sweet, fruity with prunes, dark berries, caramel goodness, fig newtons, and a very pleasant mellow maltiness. Taste is just the same. Very delicate and fulfilling. Sweet, malty, chocolaty, fruity with berries. Mouthfeel is super smooth and a little buttery. Finely prickly carbonation. A fine beer."
"Poured into a goblet: Cloudy brown with medium foamy white head that faded quickly into nothing but a spacey cafe layer. Smells of chocolate and burnt espresso, and dates and plums. Tastes slightly of ginger, nutmeg, banana, date, plum, oak. Mouthfeel slightly watery mixed with booze. There are better doubles, probably. However, a very good beverage that one should enjoy at least once."
""
""
""
"o: Very easy drinking Abbey ale, which is my favorite style in Belgians besides Trippels and Quads. Perhaps due to its age it may be maltier than intended, but as it appears to have been bottle conditioned one might expect the yeast to have asserted itself more as well. Only price puts Ommegang's Abbey Ale and Sierra Nevada's Ovila ahead of it the next time I want a good brew of this style."

"2013 vintage."

"Another outstanding beer, after abt 12 which is one of my fave beers ever. Not as strong but still a 8%, this is a typical abbey ale. Looks dark red and cloudly, abundant foam that dissipates quickly. Strong malt flavors with some sweet, perhaps caramel, especially in the aftertaste. A bit too carbonated for me: perhaps I didn't pour it correctly, but the foam makes me thing otherwise. This beer gives its best when it warms up a bit."

"O: Stable and solid, albeit a wee bit on the anonymous side. It doesn't really stand out."
""
""
""
"O: A very well-made Abbey style dubbel. Very complex. Spot on. Nothing to criticize, just a damn good beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall a little sour at the end and I prefer sweet big and boozy. Nice old feel to the taste but just a little stong with that combined with the slightly sour taste robs this of a great rating."
""
""
"Overall- Solid. Very good beer. I think, at the moment, Westmalle Dubbel gets the win over this beer but it's close. Definitely worth a try. Not cheap, but no Belgians are."
""
""
""
"St. Bernardus hits the mark with their Dubbel: fruity, malty, only slightly sweet. This is one of the benchmarks for the style."
"330ml bottle. Tulip glass. Brown color, hazzy appearance. Tan head, fairly good retention. Caramel malt, toffee aromas, hints of molasses & dark fruit. Flavors as expected from the aroma profile. Medium to full body. Moderate carbonation. Belgian yeast notes & subtle warming alcohol. Dark fruit on the aftertaste. Nice drinkability."

"The taste does not linger too long. When I first got this beer and took a whiff of this it reminded me of DFH R'aison D'être. I'd like to try the two side-by-side now to see if there's a difference."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Was very excited to find this as ABT 12 is about my favorite beer in the world. Didn't quite live up to the expectations. Flavor is decent but I don't care for the aftertaste as much. Overall I would definitely have again, on a cold night perhaps."
""
""
"Presentation: Packaged in an eleven-point-two ounce Euro-style brown glass bottle sealed with a pry-off crown, served in a New Belgium Brewing chalice."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Pretty solid dubbel and one of the originals that has stood the test of time. Delicious."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: a top notch Dubbel from a top notch brewery - so far I've had the triple and the Pierre Celis Witbier, and between the 3 they are all over 8/10. This one tends toward sweetness rather than bitterness, but still the Belgian yeasts manage to just even out the odds. definitely a slow-drinking beer - I wouldn't want to power through these, particularly as it is 8% and over AU$130 a case (2013)."

"O: Good stuff but I think I like Pator 6 better. Good balance of flavors and a huge dose of spice."
""
"echoing the other reviews, appearance is hazy, a bit of sediment on the bottom, mine is showing virtually no lacing. smell is fabulous, fruits, love it. taste is more of the same. only issue is a distractingly prickly carbonation that i'd like to see muted a bit. waiting a bit after the pour helps here. very cheerful, will have to try more from them."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A pretty solid beer with good flavors and good marks for hitting the style. a bit spicier than I expected but not bad."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pairs well with dark meat sandwiches and smoked sausages--and bacon, lots of bacon"
""
"Overall: Like a dark hefeweizen with great sweet Belgian candi sugar, spices, and vanilla thrown in. A great beer that is not necessarily the easiest to drink, nor something that I would want to have all the time. However, I will definitely revisit this one in the future."
""

""
""
"o: i prefer the Abt 12 (duh) but don't enjoy this. i would have liked the sweet dark fruit to be a little more prominent, but not a huge deal as its a dubble. also, there might be just a touch too much alcohol in the flavor for me."
""
"D - Lives up to high standards of other St. Bernardus offerings... A rock solid Dubbel... Just a notch down from my favorites in the style category... Easy drinking and highly enjoyable... I can recommend without hesitation and would gladly drink again myself in the future..."
""
""
"Dark brown in color with some chestnut highlights when it catches the light, big frothy and dense tan head, swirls of lacing. Strong notes of yeast and caramel, notes of spice, dark fruit, molasses, dark bread, nuts, alcohol. Not as deep and complex as the nose, bread, caramel and sugar make up the malt profile, yeasty spice, fruit. Medium bodied. Solid all around."

"This is one o he most balanced and best tasting Belgian beers I've had to date. A very enjoyable bready beer."
""
"Overall, a wonderful Dubbel with perfectly melded but very in your face flavors. Every St. Bernardus beer I have had has blown me away and this ones proves no different."
""
"O- quite a curveball, but not in a bad way. there are multiple layers to this beer, and all of them are fascinating."
""
""
"Has to be one of the pinnacles for the style. Dangerously drinkable also, but just so well rounded and complex that this is one that does not disappoint."
""
""
"A nice beer to sip on a cold night. A little warming alcohol makes this very enjoyable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - I love it! I could drink great quantities of this if I kept it on hand. If I were in Belgium, that may make for more of a quandary. As it is, it is too dear and expensive to keep around as an everyday drinker. But who knows, maybe I will enter the Brotherhood midlife and enjoy the finest ales the Abbeys have to offer on a more regular basis..."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"M- Creamy just like the head. Goes down very smooth. Hides the alcohol well."
""
"O: One of the better dubbels out there, but it's hard for anything to compare after you've had Westvleteren 8, especially in terms of mouthfeel. Still definitely worth a try, though."
"Overall: In my opinion, this is one of the better Belgian Ale's available. I got this bottle at my local establishment by itself for $3.99 and I consider that a steal. Such an easy drinker that any Belgian fan will appreciate."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Damn, I was definitely impressed with this one. After having the Pater 6, my hopes weren't THAT high for this one (I mean, it's just a stronger version, right?) Wrong. This beer is great, and in my opinion, severely underrated. A super-complex compound of fruit, malt, sugar, musk, hops, spices, and yeast. This is a must have for lovers of the style, and even a good choice to convert people who are hesitant."
""
""
""
""
"Beer is medium-heavy in body, with medium to medium-low intensity carbonation that feels slightly fizzy upon the palate. This quickly foams the beer, though, and the beer ends up softly moving across the palate. Closes rather dry, with moderate stickiness lingering across the palate."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"One of the most gorgeous, aromatic, and tasty beers that I have ever had."
"Overall: Ahh, St. Bernie. You done good. Real good. I'd reach for this in almost any situation, place, mood, weather, or company."
"Overall: Nice beer, probably would sell this beer in my pub."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-This brew lacks the complexity of my favorite dubbels, but it is a nice representation of the old world style with big sweetness and subtle fruit characteristics. The appearance is archetypical and mouthfeel is great. This brew made for a nice sipper on a cold January evening and I will be drinking this again."
""
""
"Good stuff. I forgot which one was more revered, this one or the tripel; both beers that I've never had before. Went with this one. Needless to say, I gotta go back and get that tripel. Singles are the way to go, as I don't need the gift pack because I already have the glass."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Very good beer. Much more flavor than the 6, very good example of the style."
""
""
""
""
"I really was hoping to like this beer given how good the 12 was, but instead I am beyond unimpressed. This being only 4 months old could be a factor in my score, perhaps at 6-12 months this might work out the kinks and become a good bit better. Sadly, a review is just a snap shot in time for the bottle being opened. I won't go as far as to say avoid this beer as this isn't a style I seek out normally, but I wouldn't go in with high expectations."
"	Overall Impression: this is a very nice beer; it’s packed with flavors that meld together very nicely; it’s sweet and smooth and the aftertaste is absolutely delightful; I really think I could drink this all night; I love me some St. Bernardus!"
""
"O - Wow this is an awesome dubbel. Complex, flavorful, and very drinkable all at the same time."
""
"O: This is a sure hit, sweet and deeply toasted malts in both the scent and flavour with plenty of creaminess with a solid foundation of deep dark copper in the glass. Get some and enjoy."
""
"Very solid brew overall. Maybe not as impressive as St. Bernardus's higher gravity brews, but still a great beer. Will visit this again."
"Overall: A really great Belgian Dubbel. One of the best in the style. Great mix of yeast, spices, and complex fruit esters."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O. Call me crazy, but this has a very similar taste to the Abt 12."
""
""
""
""
"O - Highly drinkable and packs a lot of diverse flavor without losing balance. I would recommend this one to most anyone."
"O: a decent beer, but honestly I am a bit underwhelmed here, deffiantly would take a rochefort 8 over this one."
"-Overall 4.0: Very good to excellent beer. This is an easy-drinking dubble (double) and would be fantastic as a ""heavy session"" beer for those nights when you do not have to work the next day. Not the best dubble in the world, but definitely not one to refuse."
"This is a medium bodied brew with a modest amount of carbonation. Overall, this is a pretty solid dubbel with an interesting mix of flavors. In comparison to the other St. Bernardus products, I give the nose on this one a slight edge over the 6 but the flavor of the 6 is a little better than this one. Still worth a try if you get the chance."
""
""
"Overall, I enjoyed this brew. It came in a four-pack sampler from St. Bernardus and we'll see how it compares to its abbey brethren."
""
"the entire experience is pleasurable. not too fruity, not too sweet (the belgians were beginning to wear on me with their richness). just the right amount of quaffness and quenching in this. i definitely need to get back to the belgian pub and have a few of these on tap again."
""
"O - Overall, definitely not as good as what I was hoping."
""
""
"Overall a superb example of a dubbel. Highly complex and very well rounded."
""
"O-a really solid offering from St. Bernardus, as expected, but doesn't have the flavor as the 12. I know it shouldn't compare, but its simply a lesser version of the 12"
""
""
"Overall, I truly enjoyed this brew.... A complex, but well balanced brew with a delicious taste and aroma.... Though not amongst my favorite Belgians, it's an easy-drinking Belgian.... Unique, indeed.... I love you, Belgium."
"Final Thoughts: This is a Dubbel done right. Those who enjoy the style should really appreciate this one. Would I drink it again? It's probably my favorite of the style I've tried."

"On tap at Kickbacks in Jax. Poured into a snifter. Light beige head, good retention on a hazy, amber body. Soapy, suddsy, sticky lacing. Aroma is vanilla, raisin, biscotti, fig, feint chocolate. Taste closely follows the aromas. Alcohol is very well hidden, this beer is extremely easy to drink for 8%. Delicious in every way, shape and form."

"The beer is chestnut brown with a half inch of tan head that leaves ample lacing in its wake. The aroma brings brown bread, yeast, brown sugar (though the aroma is not sweet, per se), light spice. The flavor is light and easy. Minimal alcohol presence. Bread, yeast, malt, light spice. A stellar example of a dubbel."

"Overall this is a beer I quite like, though I expected a bit more of the taste and it could be a bit more balanced, especially in the aftertaste and the mouthfeel."
"Delicious! I can't wait to have this again and to try their other brews."

"Smells and tastes of raisin bread and waffles with a touch of molasses sweetness and a smear of figgy jam on top of fresh baked muffins... I'm thinking that it is probably the blend of medium yeastiness and medium-light sweetness with just a little whisper of pseudo-cinnamon / allspice blend in the background that gives me such a nostalgic sensory rush of hearty breakfasts full of baked goods, and I really enjoy it a lot."
""
""
""
""
"Bottle. Pours a dark brown with a light brown head, good lacing. The aroma moderate to heavy malty, brown sugar, raisin, plum and hoppy. Flavor moderate/heavy sweet and bitter, in good balance. Medium/full body, syrupy, soft carbonated. Moderate in alcohol."

"O - Definitely a high quality dubbel, but didn't blow me away. I would have it again though."
"O: A really great Belgian that's exceptionally balanced between spiciness, alcoholic bite, sweet fruity flavor and that distinctive yeasty foundation. It's flavorful and strong without being totally overpowering."
""
""
""
""
"An overall very well crafted, complex and interesting beer. I've had dubbel's with more striking flavors. This one is more about balance and drinkability."
""
"What a great dubbel. Pours slightly darker than the 6 with a thicker mouthfeel, small off white head. Heavy prune notes and carbonation is just right, a little chocolate, more dark fruits and plums. Just a hint of yeast. Medium mouthfeel with still plenty of carbonation. More good stuff by St. Bernardus."
""
""
""
"For some reason, as I sipped this I couldnt help but think that some aspect of it reminded me of an imperial, souped-up version of Celebrator Doppelbock. Maybe its the chocolate or candy aspects of the brew. And that's not a bad thing at all.  "
""
""
"O: Maybe I have been spoiled by the other dubbels I have had, but this one doesn't particularly stand out."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"overall: It's an interesting beer. I'm not sure if i like it or not. It's not bad and i do enjoy it, but it's just not a ""Wow!"" moment i had with their Triple. So it's def. not their best."
""
""
""
"Overall – A tasty brew, but in comparison to its bigger brother 12 it is nothing to really pine for. For the dubbel style it is more towards the top of the line, but not the best out there (at least in my opinion)"
""
""
""
"Pours a molasses brown with a two finger light beige head. The head remains as long as the beer, significant lacing coats the sides of the glass. The aroma of dark fruit, fig and dates, sweet cream, and a hint of alcohol rises from the chalice. Notes of sweet malt, caramel, spice, bread, and almond can be found thoughout this brew. Medium-bodied, perfect carbonation, creamy velvet on the palate. An exceptional dubbel from a fantastic brewery."
""
"O: This brewery never ceases to amaze, this is a great tasting beer, very well balanced and warming."
"Overall a powerfully rich beer -- an excellent slow sipping, nightcap treat."

"Overall: I get a lot of caramel, but well in balance. Not much alcohol or hop character. Very drinkable."

"Review from 12/2010 notes. Poured into a St. Bernardus goblet. Pours a murky dark red amber with a nice off-white head and lacing. Subdued light malt, dark and light fruit aroma. Light fruit, malt and Belgian spicing. Somewhat light flavor. Finishes nicely with sweet malt and light fruit. Mouth feel and carbonation are very nice. A great dubble, although the flavors are not as assertive as I'd expect. I'd still be happy to drink this any time."
""
""
""
""
"Taste -- Its absolute strongest point. I sipped on this over the course of a half hour, and savored every drop of it. I like to start these out a little colder than recommended, and let the taste gradually enhance as it goes on, and this, even cold, had a very nice flavor. I had one of these the same weekend I had a Rochefort 8, and while this is the minority opinion, I found the Prior 8 exceedingly more tasteful. I've had the St. B quad, but this was my first time with their dubbel, and this is now my favorite dubbel, hands down."
""
""
"O: A very good beer. Light enough to enjoy on a warm evening. Not as powerful or as much of a sensory overload as 12. Sort of like 12 light. Not quite as much flavor and not as full bodied, but the flavor and fizzy character matches. You can tell it's St Bernardus!"
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is as fine a dubbel as I've had and one worth seeking out. I probably enjoyed it more than any of the other St. Bernardus offerings, though they are all worthy."
""
""
""
"Overall, a great beer at the right temp. Warmth brings out the finish and mellows the mouth feel. Will drink again."

"Damn tasty! Rich, complex, and quite enjoyable overall. Highly recommended..."

"For me this one was just amazing, though I may have a bias toward this type of beer. Hugely complex and a lot sweeter than its big brother, better looking too."
""
""
"I only wish I had a 750ml instead of on 11.2oz bottle."

"O: A pleasant, fruity dubbel."

"St. Bernardus Prior 8, 22 oz. bomber: A good Belgian dubbel is an amazing experience. The Prior 8 has a dark caramel color and the big head as is common with the St. Bernardus products. The aroma is good, but could be bigger and have more of the Belgian yeast that I expect out of a Belgian beer. Good flavor, but overpowering in a raisin flavor note. Lacking the big rock candy flavor that ruins some dubbels (in my opinion), but too much of the raisin flavor and not enough complexity. Not enough Belgian yeast coming through (but I did not swirl the yeast in, so that may be my fault). So the rating is good, but I was expecting more."
""
""
""
"O: Not easily drinkable, with a nice aftertaste."
""
"Overall an outstanding dubbel, possibly my favorite. Wish there weren't so many chunks but in the end, a minor detraction."

"O: Decent Dubbel. It's been a while since I've had a dubbel but a good representation of the style. It's well balanced and dangerously drinkable, as well as easily obtainable. Worth trying if you haven't."

"750 ml bottle into signature chalice, no bottle dating. Pours cloudy dark reddish brown color with a fairly dense 2 finger off white head with good retention that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Some slight spotty lacing on the glass. Aromas of big apple, grape, raisin, prune, dark candi sugar, molasses, pepper, toasted biscuit, and yeast spices. Fantastic and standard dubbel aromas with great complexity and strength. Taste of big raisin, prune, caramel, molasses, biscuit, clove, pepper, dark candi sugar, light chocolate, roasted nut, and yeast spices. Lingering notes of dark fruit, molasses, apple, candi sugar, clove, and yeast spices on the finish for a good bit. Fantastic flavor balance and complexity; with no cloying sweetness. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a fantastic fairly creamy and slick mouthfeel. Very smooth to drink but is still a sipper. Alcohol is very well hidden with hardly any warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is an absolutely mind blowing Dubbel. Fantastic flavor complexity, balance, and super smooth drinking. Hands down the best Dubbel I have ever had."

"-Palate is tighter than nose - temperature is a bit cool - but citrus and spices show themselves. The beer is lively and fresh and youthful - just a hint of bitter (very nicely balanced) with malty richness and nuanced power. The beer finishes long and with high complexity. This is far superior to the Pater 6 I had from the same gift set. Great beer."
"Great beer"
"Notes: Fresh by 4/12/2013, drank 2/8/2012."

""

"The mouthfeel leans toward lush in a rich carbonation flowing through a big, malty backbone, but carbonation is so heavy it becomes extremely filling. Both smooth and crisp, I understand the love of so many for the mouthfeel, but if the carbonation could be moderated it would make for easier drinking."
"Served in a branded goblet. Poured a dark walnut colour, two fingers of clean head. Smells robustly malty. Is lightly carbonated, slightly sweet, not too heavy and sickly. Finishes slightly pruney. A good showing for a Belgium, representative of the style, without the sickly sweetness sometiems present. No strong alcohol overtones."
"Overall, a real disappointment. Not sure if this is an off bottle or just a really young bottle. but I expected much more. I am a big fan of the other St. Bernadus beers I have had (12, 6, Tripel and Wit), so I am surprised by this. Will definitely try it again to see if I have a different reaction next time."

"O- Nice combination of full, dark flavors paired with a good mouthfeel and beautiful appearance makes this a great brew"
""

"Dark brown in the pour, some ruby around the edges. Fairly thick tan head, with some dense lacing and somewhat thin retention, but it's persistent. Nose is chockful of rich dark fruit notes, loads of plums and the like. Caramelized and candied with notes of brown sugar and gentle vanilla. Some grapeiness that sits well in the background. Caramel, toffee and more sweet dark fruits. Vanilla is right there again, and dominates the profile for the better part. Finishes sweet and somewhat sticky. Mouthfeel is creamy as can be and the alcohol is invisible, super smooth and as close as can be to perfect for the style. Overall, a fantastic surprise (didn't see the dating when I got this) - one of the best dubbel's I've had in a while, doesn't stand far at all from a Westy 8."

"O: Very nice beer, well balanced and with good amounts of complexity. I shouldn't be surprised as I have been impressed with every beer I have had from St. Bernardus. This is a beer that I would get many times and each time I think I appreciate it a little more."

"O: A very good dubbel from a world class brewery, happy to have found it on draft & look forward to having it again."
"O-pretty good. not the best of the style. above average but nothing special."
""
"Pours a muddy cloudy light brown with a tan head. The scent is of dark fruits and spice and makes up for the less than beautiful appearance. The taste is much fuller than I expected and follows the scent. This brew was nicely carbonated and quite viscious at the same time. I would not hestitate to buy this one again. Tasty!"
"O - A good beer from a great brewery. Not my favorite from them (nor should it be), but a good beer nonetheless. Seek it out if you enjoyed the Abt 12, but didn't enjoy the price."
"DOA"
""

"Overall, this is a very good Dubbel. One of my favorites in the style, I think. It's a bit too much at times, too strong, but it's very tasty just the same."

"Overall I thought that this was a pretty damn good Dubbel that is exactly was a classic and traditional Dubbel should be, this beer really epitomizes the style, with great balance and some nice complexity. This beer was really drinkable, at first I didn't think it was going to be because of it's sweet aroma but it wasn't that sweet in the flavor, it went down very smooth and had enough flavor to hold my attention, if I wasn't sharing this with my brother I don't think I would have any problem drinking the whole bottle. I liked pretty much everything about this beer, it is just about everything that a good Dubbel should be. What I liked least about this beer was the high amount of prickly carbonation, it wasn't that bad I just wish it wasn't so prickly. I would for sure buy this beer again, mainly for special occasions, it's got good flavor with some good drinkability to go with it, I recommend giving this beer a try, it has all the aspects that a good Dubbel should have. This was a nice beer to celebrate my birthday with, it had some nice complex flavors without being too big and boozy, if I had more I think I would be content with drinking this all night. Those monks really have this style down and this beer showcases what years and years of hard work can do, this is the best Dubbel I have had to date and I can't wait to see what their Tripel and Quad are like."

"Pours a dark clear brown with a medium sized head. Lacing on the surface. Smell is strong dark fruit. Plums. Raisins. Brown sugar. Taste is complex with fruit notes- apples. Caramel. Bitterness in the finish. Full bodied and well carbonated. Pretty easily drinkable for a beer of this strength. Overall this is a great dubbel."
""
""
""
""
"O- good beer, but a little thin. Fairly easy drinking."
""
"Overall, after sampling the Pater 6 back to back with this beer I think I prefer the lighter example because the flavors seem more balanced and lean toward the toastier bread compared to this example that is kind of crossed between a Dubbel and a Quad flavor wise (dark fruits are most dominant in the Abt 12). While this is a good beer it not no exponentially better than the lesser ABV example and I would lean toward that one so I can imbibe in more of it. If you want a more ""flavorful"" darker Belgian beer, opt for the 12 over this 8."
""
""
""
""
"Notes: Sourness plays a big part here. There is a slight bitter 'aspirin' taste and a just a touch of sweetness. Not sure if I would want to drink more."
""
"my second one out of the gift pack. pours a dirty brown color with a small tan head that leaves minimal lacing. smell is of raisins, prunes, roasted malt and spice. taste is right on with the nose except that the spice is more present in the flavor. has a some what creamy mouthfeel to it with a dry spicy finish. not liking this one as much as i did the pater 6."
""
""
""
"Of course its good. Its St. Bernadus!!!!"
""
""

"D - A good beer to sip on while working. I'm not a particular fan of dubbles but I would never turn this down. Though multiple would be tough for those are more accustomed to lighter beers."

"This is a nice beer but just like their Pater 6 is doesn't stack up at all to their ABT 12."

"O- I had just tried the Pater 6 and thought it was excellent and was hoping this would be the same but a tiny bit better but i actually prefer the 6. Having said that, its a great brew."
"Overall a good beer and similar to the 6, but it seemed to impress me slightly less. Still, a really good belgian beer. Would enjoy it again without question."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Very good dubbel. I like this dubbel much more than the Prior 6. It is interesting how different the two actually are within the same style."
""
"Overall, this is a true winner, can well be considered a definition of the style along with greats like Westmalle, La Trappe, Sterkens and Ommegang."
""
""
"A quintessential Belgian dubbel in my opinion and one that all dubbels should be rated against. Highly recommended."
""
"A nice dubbel, a little too brut for my taste but still a worthwhile visit."
""
"Wonderful example of Belgian dubbel without the ass kicking ABV. If you have a taste for something Belgian on a lower scale, grab one of these. Getting more for those occasions."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall Impression- I'm a huge fan of all other St. Bernardus brews, but this one falls short for me. Should have more body, carbonation, complexity, richness, and many more attributes. Nonetheless, enjoyed but would push you to get an Abt 12 or Pater 6 before this one."
"I don't think I can count how many times I've seen this beer around, but I never got around to trying it, always opting for it's bigger brother 12, if I'm in the mood for a St. Bernardus. Clear, chestnut brown color with a frothy off-white head that retained and laced well. Aroma of sweet malts and sugars, with notes of dried fruits. Taste was pretty much what I'd expect from a dubbel: candi sugar and caramel, lightly toasted bread, tones of dried plums and raisins, and a touch of vanilla. A bit of noticeable booze. Medium mouthfeel, and pleasantly drinkable."
"Overall, a good brew that was a good representation of the style. Recommended."

"O: A really good beer, easy drinking and smooth. Solid flavor profile, spot on."
""
""
""
"Prior 8 is another stellar ale from Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV."
""
""
"Overall Drinkability - Flavorful, balanced, but a little bland."
"If you pay attention there are a lot of subtle flavors that come together in this one. It's well balanced and very drinkable."
"Poured from a 750ml bottle into a goblet. This pours a hazy yeast filled tea color with a small white head which quickly dissipates. The smells are of grapes and dark ripe fruit. The feel is medium with high carbonation. The taste is of grape, fruit, malts with a dry finish and a little alcohol burn. Overall pretty good but the 10 is better."
"It's been established in other reviews that I'm highly sensitive to candied sugar, and this one does it to me. I guess I like this more on tap than in a bottle. Good to know."
"Overall a really nice tasting beer, complex, smooth, creamy, excellent example of a dubbel"
"O- This is a great beer. Has the same qualities as the Trappist ales without the noticeable alcohol despite the 8% ABV."
"O - Thought it was a great beer, easy to drink and enjoy. Nothing was overpowering, things just seemed to mesh together well in this beer."
"This is a really great beer...almost like a more drinkable apt 12, though, the two have distincly different tastes. Great dubble either way that is hard to beat with the lack of Rochefort around these parts."
"Popped the cap on this brew and the bubbles started coming right up the neck of the bottle and magically stopped right at the top of the bottle. Poured this one slowly into a wine glass, it came out as a muddy brown color with a light tan colored head on top. The lacing was pretty good down the glass and sticks around for a while. The smell of the beer is soft, earthy and had a light spice note in there too. The taste of the beer was smooth with some subtle dark fruit flavors and brown sugar. The other flavors of some yeast come through also. The mouthfeel was medium bodied with a light carbonation to it and was very easy to drink. Overall it's a brew that everyone should try."
"M: Easy to drink at the beginning turns a little difficult at the end because of the bitterness that remains a long time making a good ending, some alcohol remains on the mouth but not disgusting."
"O: This beer is clearly quality. If I have one qualm with it, it is that it is almost too unassuming. The flavors are developed and sophisticated, yet sometimes are so delicate and understated that they border on anti-climactic. The Prior 8 consistently dazzles you, but never quite delivers that knock out blow."
"D - Another home run by St. Bernardus. As I mentioned, a slight step below the Pater 6, but a fantastic and flavorful dubbel nonetheless. If it wasn't for the 8.0% ABV, I could drink a ton of these."
"Nicely balanced, full-flavored, and completely easy-drinking. Very tasty and not too sweet."
"overall this is a good beer. probably my 2nd favorite from Waton topped only by ABT 12... A MUST TRY!!!"
"O: Not bad but not something I get excited over"
"o - a damn fine beer. thoroughly enjoyable and recommended."
"O: The beer is very easy to drink, especially as it warms up, because no traces of alcohol are detectable. This is a very good representation of the style."
"I'm not crazy about this Dubbel. I wouldn't turn one down, but I don't imagine I'll be buying another in the near future."
"O: I love this style and I love this beer. This is a classic. I wish I could afford to drink this all the time because it never gets old. I can't remember if I like this more than the Pater 6 but the alcohol does seem to come out a lot more in this one. This is a solid Dubbel and a no-brainer to try out."
"The drink of this beer is very enjoyable and not overpowering in flavor for a Belgian abbey."
"Overall: nice dubbel, but can not compete with westvleteren, achel and rochefort"
"When I first had this beer, I thought it was truly excellent. Upon a re-review, I found it to be less than perfect. It's less complex than some others. Tasty, nonetheless."
"Overall, a nice brown ale. I generally prefer a bit more bitter flavors, but with food, I think this one 'll do!"
"Overall a very good brew, mellow yet complex and a pleasure to drink. Addition of cheese and onion crisp not recommended."
"Overall: I expected a bit more though it's still a very good beer, The clove taste is more evident than I would like. This and the Pater 6, while very different beers, don't compare with the quality of the Abt 12. Look for the 12."
"O: Tasty, goes down very easily, not too filling, good kick, very good representation of style, this is a solid Belgian-style beer worth drinking for a while but it’s not quite as outstanding as some other beers from St. Bernardus."
"O-this is a wonderful beer. its quite different than the other dubbels i've had, not as sweet, this seems to have a different flavor profile to me. this seems to be more complex and sophisticated to me than the others. every time i go to take a sip, i get excited. i definitely won't mind getting this again. its quite tasty and goes down very easily."
"Dr: Hides its high ABV quite well, but is nothing special, especially by Belgian standards. Wonderful but average - if that makes sense. Very well priced in Belgium."
"Pours mahagony with a decent head, into a chimay chalice. Initial smell and taste sour, and cidery. Thinking i'm going to drain pour after i finish the chalice, but I give it a chance and allow it to warm, maybe served a little too cold. Smell, plums and raisins(disclaimer i have a bad sense of smell) Tastes very sweet, perfect level of carbonation. mouthfeel light and smooth, head retention is minimal. Overall not a bad beer, but most likely wouldn't try this one again, if I did i would allow it to warm to correct temperature first."
"O: great beer but I wish the alcohol wasn't so noticeable. I'd grab the 6 first."
"The beer is medium brown colored with a tannish head. The beer is hazy and you cannot see through it. The aroma is caramel and toffee with some molasses mixed in. I also get a little bit of dark fruit. The flavor is full of caramel, Belgian yeast, candy sugar and a little bit of grape/other dark fruit. The alcohol is barely noticeable and the beer is very easy to drink. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"Medium full body with creamy texture and moderate carbonation, and some alcohol warmth. One of the finest Dubbels out there (330 ml, BB 08-18-2016, into tulip)."
"awesome beer, truly a hallmark of the style, simply impeccable."
"The mouthfeel is a bit on the lighter side of medium bodied and incredibly briskly carbonated. The drinkability is quite good, especially for the ABV. Could all the Trappist and Trappist-style beers be this good? Have I been writing off Belgian beers entirely due to American breweries poor heavy-handed use of Belgian yeast in styles where it doesn't belong? It's too early to call that for sure, but this is a great beer. Suddenly I'm looking forward to my tour of Belgian beers."
"Medium and smooth in the mouthfeel. High level of carbonation that works well. Excellent brew."
"O—This is a solid brew from St. Bernardus, but I’m not overly impressed with this one."
"O: A great Belgian dark ale. The complexity and nuance is there, huge toasted malts, great yeast esters."
"O: A great dubbel... rich and very enjoyable; something to take your time with and enjoy."
"Drinkability: Its a great dubbel. One of the best."
"Been a while since I had a new Belgian. This was from St Bernardus so I was hopeful when I bought it and it was not their best but it did not disappoint. Prior 8 is somewhat darker than ABT 12 but has the same outstanding characteristics of the top tier Belgians. The appearance was dark with a good head. Smell was underwhelming but fruity. Mouthfeel was pleasant with the right amount of carbonation. Taste with sweet overtones and not overwhelming yeast and some mild bitter."
"And here's to my daughter: Michelle Rachel. May you live as long as you want and never want as long as you live."
"Medium bodied and well carbonated. No real taste of alcohol. Finishes a little dry. I could drink this again easily."
"Another great beer from St. Bernardus with plenty of authentic character for the senses."
"O - A nice choice but maybe lacking some bigger flavors. Nice and smooth but a milder dubbel."
"Very drinkable, super smooth and delicious."
"I love the style. And this is simply a good example of it. If this was more widely distributed in my area, it would probably be in heavy rotation in the beer refrigerator."
"This is an excellent beer, well done and well made. Though lighter in the alcohol, it tastes almost like a quadruple. It's a perfect beer to have if you want the fullness of a quad without the higher alcohol levels that accompany it."
"Brown with ruby red edges and a dense and rolling tan head that has staying power. Malts and dark fruit to the nose with a slightly metallic edge. Tastes of plums, cherries, brown sugar, taffy, cinnamon and a slight bitterness at the very end. Everything is very well blended with no intrusions. Smooth with a subtle graininess going down and a little syrupy on the lips after a bit. Good brew from a great brewery."
"Mouthfeel is creamy and full, with some chalkiness at times and a finish that is awkwardly watery, chalky and slightly bitter at the same time. Drinkability is shoddier than expected, as the yeast is just way too strong at the start and the finish, as just mentioned, is weird. Abv is not utilized in the best way possible (this doesn't mean it has to be hidden, it just means the strength is too much for this beer). After having Abt 12 and Tripel from these guys I expected a lot more, but I guess everything is not going to be to my taste."
"D - umm not really seeing the big draw to this one. Its good but its nothing special. It does not compare to ABT 12 or really anything i have had from them. Maybe i just dont like dubbels are much as tripels and quads? idk but not the best and not the worst. Right in the middle."
"Overall a superb tasting Abbey Ale with a great drinkability, which did a great job of hiding the high ABV..."
"Pours an opaque super dark brown color with a 1 inch tan head that fades to a small cap. Very spotting lacing on the glass. Floating particles are present in the beer as well. Smell is of dark ripe fruits, vanilla, brown sugar, caramel malt. Tastes like it smells with sweet caramel malt, brown sugar sweetness, ripe dark fruits like raisins or plums. Somewhat of a high level of carbonation. Good drinkability but I was expecting more from this beer."
"A very good beer, but I'm not diggin' it as much as I thought I would. The jolly Friar on the bottle suggested that it would make me very happy, and I while I have a smile on my face I'm not running off to join Robin Hood and his band of merry men. Pours beautifully, and after 15 minutes it's still holding a bit of head. Lacing is french vanilla white and runs up the entire length of the glass. Malty, malty, malty; smelling and tasting creamy. Carbonation is very high, which may be putting me off a bit. It's reminding me of seltzer water and I never drink seltzer. Alcohol taste is muted, but it does give me a nice warm burn. I'd drink it again, but there are other trappists I'd put way ahead of it."
"Feel is medium, smooth and easy like most trappists beers, alcohol is not noted, carb is light, not refreshing but satisfying. I can drank a bunh more of this, why not..."
"A deep oak brown brew with a slight reddish hue. Considerable head standing firm after the pour. Sediment evident throughout, which is typical of the style. Not much in the way of aroma, but what is there has a biscuit and caramel tinge. Moderately full bodied flavor, with caramel, molasses, some fruits such as apricot and pear. Very well balanced, smooth through the swallow and finishing slightly dry. No rough edges. Mouthfeel is equal to or slightly better than the 12, but has a letter less complex character. May vary based on batch, storage, and age characteristics. Another great brew from St. Bernardus."
"D- a great dubble to say the least and surely one of the bench marks for the style."
"Overall, a wonderful and very drinkable brew. Quite tasty.. Very enjoyable."
"Nice dubbel. Little bit too sugary - seems like the high sugar levels here almost stop the other flavours coming through. You could probably compare this to cola... if you wanted to go to hell!"
"Verdict: Prior 8 is simply the best Dubbel I've had the pleasure of trying yet. It ticks all of the boxes: it confirms to style, it's criminally drinkable, and it's tasty as hell from the first sip through to the dregs."
"Really a classic, well made beer. First thing to strike you is the creaminess, really smooth and mellow in the mouth, low carbonation which fits perfectly. Dark fruits, figs, raisins with a pleasant bready malt and a touch of caramel and cocoa, hint of cloves. Somehow both drinkable and sumptuous."
"drinkability - i had this after a chimay red tonight and this was the hands down winner no contest"
"Good Dubbel. Don't know much about the style so I don't have much to base it on yet, but I like it."
"Overall- Basically to me, drank back to back, it tastes like a slightly stronger and more complex version of the 6. This has slightly better flavor profile, but not quite as drinkable, with a more full feel and higher ABVs."
"Price = $4.99 at Whole Foods"
"Mouthfeel is nice with a firm carbonation and a smooth coating feeling. It's almost chewy with a warm finish that stays in your mouth for some time after. This isn't a bad beer but a solid average one. Simple and well made but not much for big flavors and complexity. Worth a try but probably not one I'd come back to. I find the 6 to be much more satisfying."
"D- Again, solid beer as its brothers."
"Solid Dubbel, i preferred the prior 6 more as i thought it was a touch dryer and even a bit more complex. Still a solid beer."
"D: Less boozy than the 12 means this goes down extremely easy. It's not as complex, but still a beautiful example of the Dubbel."
"D: A very nice offering from St. Bernardus."
"I think I like the Pater 6 better, but this is a great one too."
"Quite full mouthfeel with a lot of carbonation. Very nice dubbel -- more or less hits the prototype of what a dubbel should be in all ways (except maybe aroma). Very nice beer."
"What could be better (besides a stiff Scotch ale) on a snowy evening than splitting a big bottle of a good dubbel with one's spouse? As comfort beers go, the Prior 8 is among my favorites. It warms but does not overheat; it doesn't overwhelm with yeast and sugar; it goes well with anything, including sushi and Indian food. And it's affordable. A fine winter treat."
"D - Overall a tasty offering from St. Bernardus and worthy to any fan of Belgians. ABV is not overpowering making it pretty drinkable. A great bottle to share with friends."
"D: This would be a near perfect dubbel with higher carbonation and lacing."
"Yet another great Trappist beer!"
"Feels good in the mouth, easily drinkable."
"aroma: nutty, bread, caramel with belgian yeast. maybe some raisin and vanilla. appearance: red brown in color, hazy to clear, tan head taste: medium sweetness, light bitter, with raisins and figs but lightly palate: med to full bodied, average carbonation, good finish. drinkable beer, but more of a sipper."
"D- Very easy, but rich."
"D - Drinkability is moderate. It's a bit on the higher side of the scale for sweetness and alcohol, and while the flavors are good, it's a good sipper."
"d- not bad, this is a classic belgian that shows exactly what a kicked up, stronger alcohol dubbel should taste like."
"(D)- A fantastic dubbel with everything in the right place. Smooth and creamy with just the right amount of dry yeasty earth to help balance out the ripe and creamy fruits. Far superior to their prior 6."
"This is a very good Dubbel. IMO, not as good as the Pater 6, but a good beer nonetheless."
"A good beer all around without any real faults to speak off."
"Overall, this is just another wonderful beer from St. Bernardus. I am sipping this on Christmas night while watching it snow with my wife on the couch and listening to Christmas music, making it a near perfect moment. A beer and moment I will never forget."
"D- A really solid brew that I will be buying again."
"D- Very smooth, very drinkable, very nice."
"Not really as unique or as interesting as I had expected. Surely not bad but this should really be firing on all cylinders."
"One of the beers that got me into Belgians over two years ago, Prior 8 is a mighty fine Dubbel."
"very good very delicious my only problem is a cant stand cheeries in beer and as this beer warms it comes out more and more"
"This is one of my favorite dubbels and is a very drinkable beer. This was actually the first beer I had from St. Bernardus and I have yet to be let down since. This is a great beer to curl up with on a cold winter night. Actually, strike that and curl up with your significant (or pet) and drink the beer. Beer bottles are lousy at cuddling."
"Just didn't strike me quite right. I liked the Pater 6 and the Abt 12 better. I get more twang than the sweetness I would prefer."
"This is a nice dubbel. I've certainly had better, but this one's pretty good. All the trademark flavors are there and it should please fans of the style. Recommended."
"An amazingly welcoming even delicious heavenly brew, straight from the hands of that goddamn monk. No wonder the prick is smiling."
"D - High to say the least. Very drinkable for 8%. I'm drinking from the 11.2oz bottle but I could see myself purchasing a bomber for sure."
"Drinkability: A solid all-round Belgian brew, though not the best. Still, a beer I would love to have again and something I would recommend."
"Drinkabilty - It Has enough alcohol that you cant slam them , but its sweet and spicy, very tasty, and very plesurable to drink. One of the best dubbels out there."
"D - very sweet in flavour, melt in your mouth smooth, alcohol is there but not too intrusive, an enjoyable treat"
"D - Very drinkable for an 8% ABV."
"This is a fantastic dubble! I love all of the flavors that mingle so perfectly together, and that dry finish is fantastic."
"D - As with most premium Belgian brew the alcohol is well-disguised and the flavor is amazing with a very notable smoothness. Definitely an impressive Dubbel that I could never have enough of. (5)"
"D: This is a good beer with a nice flavor profile, but I find the carbonation level (at least of this particular bottle) interesting initially but tiresome as I work through the bottle and therefore a bit detracting. That said, I would gladly have another if weren't going to cost me another $7.50. At that price? I'm glad I tried it, and I did enjoy it, but I will venture on to something else next. I do expect to return to this beer again at some point, just not today."
"D- As with all quality beers, St. Bernardus is right up there with the best of them at masking abv. In none of their beers I've tried can you taste the alcohol. It is slightly warming, but no taste of it whatsoever. A good dubbel."
"Most definitely a classic dubbel, in that it is less about the sweetness, and more about the balancing yeast, fruit, spice, and alcohol, all of which do their personal best to keep from becoming overbearing. Monks, they be monks, whatever their particular unimportant denomination, and they brew some pretty damned (sorry, pater!) good stuff, as evidenced here."
"Live and subsequently learn."
"Pour yields foamy 1 finger tan head and very very sticky lacing. Dark Coca-Cola coloring. Not quite black but close. Smell is sticky sweet candied plum and burnt cane sugar. Taste is brown sugar coated fig. Has a touch of plum and raisin and a taint of hoppiness. And perhaps a bit of tobacco. Carbonation is toned down as it should be with a beer like this. Only complaint is that it is a bit hot on the throat. Otherwise a stellar Belgian."
"As a dubbel, this is good, but I actually prefer the Pater 6. This is perhaps closer to a Belgian strong dark ale/Quad in the taste, but not quite as good as the Abt. 12."
"This is a nice dubbel, the sweetness could be toned down alittle."
"this is one mellow brew, very complex and one to ponder. I wasn't sure what to expect but this is just another world class beer from a world class brewery"
"drinkability; a little rich and strong for a session beer, sit back and enjoy, while it still last. Very easy to drink in spite of the alcohol."
"Very smooth drinking for 8% ABV..."
"Overall this is an awesome beer, but that is expected from this line. I could sip on these for an entire evening without a hint of boredom."
"D - If i could purchase it for less i would drink it all the time. I think this would do well with cheese in particular the palate just needs to be given something other than the high carbonation. Right now the carbonation is making it difficult to detect even the flavors i wrote a moment ago as my tongue is suffering."
"D: Loving this St. Bernardus mixed 4 pack! Definitely calling it quits after the 6 and the 8 and saving the Tripel and 12 for another night. Fantastic beers for a great price, plus an awesome chalice."
"I've only had one Dubbel previously, Chimay Red, and this is impressing me more. Less solvent-like alcohol would make this a great beer, and maybe more age would solve that (haha)."
"Drinkability is great. The delicious smell draws you in and the taste delivers, though not as well as it could have. The alcohol that shows up towards the end doesn't really impair the drinking experience, though sipping is recommended to fully enjoy the flavor experience of this quality Belgian brew."
"For a dollar more for a 750 I'll go for the Abt 12 any day. But I'm not dissapointed in the $9.99 I spent on this bottle. The 6 and 12 are better of representations of their respective styles."
"Medium body. Creamy. Notable carbonation at first but it soon calms down. An alcoholic finish. Very drinkable. Smooth. Not as sweet as some. Two thumbs up."
"Hmmmm, expected a little more from this one. Pours a slightly murky mahogony color with a half inch head that fades to a few islands of foam. No much lacing at all. Kind of bland aroma, but there is some spice, dried fruit, leather, prunes. A few things going on in the flavor but nothing melds all too well. Complex malt profile, spicy fruity yeast esters, and a combo of some hoppyness and hotness on the back end. Not too sweat. Full mouthfeel and a little slick. Again a little hot on the backend. I like the beer, not sure I would seek it out again real soon though."
" The body is full, rich, and creamy. I loved the flavor profile of this beer. Bready, cookie joined in with the great malty characteristics that mimicked the nose. A spicy, alcohol flavor appeared in the finish."
"This Dubbel delivers, offering enough complexity to keep you coming back, and enough juxtaposition to keep you guessing. Enjoyable, yet I managed to lose interest near the end."
"All in all, a winner of a beer. It's drinkable, smooth and is a good beer for this style. Just watch out for the ABV."
"Pours a dark brown with some chestnut coloring and a nice tan head with some good legs as it goes down my tulip. Smell is dark fruits with a good amount of caramel and some dark candied sugars. Taste is not quite as refined, with yeast character really beginning to dominate. Mouthfeel is nice and rich without too much heat. Quite creamy. Drinkability is quite good. Did this as part of the entire St. Bernardus lineup, and this was one of my favorites; though, to be fair, I suppose all of them were quite good."
"All in all, this was an ok brew. Kind of overrated IMO. Good to try if u like belgians. I have not gotten in to them myself."
"My First St. Bernadus... very good, cannot wait for the next one."
"D - Pretty good and easy drink. This is something you treat yourself to, so definitely not multiple in one night."
"jd"
"This was unusually very easy to drink since it was very rich in flavor and had a strong alcohol presence."
"11.2oz bottle served in my ST tulip. Best before end 11 08 14 indicated on the back label. Opened this bottle to let it warm and breathe before pouring - unbeknownst to me, it was slowly foaming out of the bottle, leaving a puddle in it's wake (luckily it didn't hit the carpet). Pours a deep, reddish-brown with a foamy two inch, cream-colored head. Clarity is a bit murky and there are tiny yeast particles evident in solution. Nose is earthy and vinous with dark fruits (prunes/figs/raisins) rounding out the middle and the back. There's also a dull spicy/herbal/minty quality in the mix, but it is difficult to nail down the precise character. Taste follows nose - pretty much the same character, with the residual earthy/herbal/yeasty quality lingering between quaffs. Mouthfeel is light-medium, with an even and pleasant background carbonation and a semi-dry feel. A very solid dubbel with very good complexity, but not something I would drink a lot of in one sitting or with any frequency."
"D-Very drinkable and enjoyable brew. Will look for again."
"A true dubbel. Textbook stuff here. The familiar sights and smells are all here. Clumpy head with good lacing a top a rusty brown body. Some dried fruits, plums, raisins, bit of phenolic action and brown sugar. The sweet yeast aftertaste sits nicely alongside the alcohol warmth. Great balance, going down a treat this cold windy evening."
"D-- I really like Dubbel's but this is one I am not real found of. Prefer Chimay over this and the La Trappe as well. A little too carbonated for me and left me bloated. Lemon taste was a hindrance in this for me. I will stick to their Triple and ABT 12."
"Drinkability was okay - you'll definitely be crab-walking after three or four of these."
"Drinkability - This is a rather heavy beer but one could probably have three in a night although you would be quite full as a result. As I said before this is my favorite dubbel, very well balanced not overly malty or punishingly alcoholic. With out a doubt worth trying and enjoying."
"Beer has a creamy body, fine bubbles round out the sweetness and the minor ester character. Beer is slightly bready and nice. Medium overall, high drinkability, a great obtainable dubbel."
"D - Super drinkable and deliscious."
"D- A really tasty and unique dubbel and a definite go-to for the style."
"The candied sugar has quite the presence in the taste and really shows how it can be used in a beer, the strength is a little more noticeable but it might be that it's a fresher bottle, once again the carbonation is quite assertive and cola like but works for the style, aftertaste is semi-sweet but not sticky or cloying."
"Cheers!"
"D - This is a very drinkable beer that is a fine example of Dubbel. Well done St. Bernardus!"
"D: For a dubbel, the taste here is slightly one-dimensional. However, still very solidly executed and incredibly drinkable. Good mouthfeel makes it go down easy and low IBUs and big fruitiness mean that my palate is unlikely to be saturated by this one. Widely available and worth a shot."
"This has to be on the short list of style defining Dubbels. The word quintessential comes to mind. Further proof of the brewing excellence that is St. Bernardus."
"Pretty good, kind of a unique fruit sweetness in the taste. I've had better dubbels though, but it's definitely worth a try."
"D: Another good beer from St. Bernardus. The alcohol warmth does come through a bit as the beers warms up a little bit, but it doesn't detract from my enjoyment at all."
"Mouthfeel is delicate and unique for a dubbel, and while the finish is interesting, it doesn't convert into the malty saccharin finish characteristic of it's type. Unique and very good for a single bottle."
"Still, I don't find it attractive enough to want to down another one. In fact I probably won't get it again, although I'm glad I tried it on a whim."
"D: Not my favourite St. Bernardus mayhap, but very good. Despite the smell, it didn't taste very alcoholic, nor did I realize how quickly the beer was flowing from my goblet until it was gone. I would have one again, but probably would choose the Abt 12 over the Prior 8."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: High in carbonation with a medium body. Not bad overall but not my favorite of the style."
"D: A nice strong beer that doesn't have too much of a kick. Very tasty."
"An eminently drinkable brew with a nice malt richness and good interplay with the alcohol."
"overall a solid representation of the style"
"Taste, quite interesting. Up front flavors of cherry (my favorite!) but that's soon overtaken by deeper malts and then hops. The defining characteristic, for me, of this beer is that it has a lovely ""sweet"" taste (the cherry) but it's ultimately a very balanced beer. First time I've tried this and I'm in love."
"Served from bottle into a Chimay goblet. Poured a nice dark brown with minimal off-white head. Lacing was minimal througout. The aroma was comprised of sweet and fruit notes. The flavor was full of fruit, slight spice, and minimal alcohol. It was medium on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a very nice brew that was quite drinkable and enjoyable. I was glad I finally got to try it. It is definite worth a try for any Belgian fan out there who has not tried it."
"O: This may be my new favorite Belgian. I'll be purchasing more of this. I believe it tastes better than the SB Abt 12. This is a definite recommend."
"It's not much above average dubbel beer though, I'm disappointed to say."
"D - The fisrt time I darnk this beer I didn't rate it. I muct have had a bad one becasue this is the best Dubbel that I have had. It's richness and fuller body sets it apart."
"Such a mistake in only buying one. Not to be missed!"
"D - Smooth and very sippable. Sweetness would keep me from having a second in the same sitting. A wonderfully complex and tasty offering."
"Fruity nose, with touches of malt, quite complex. The entrance is easy on the palate but then quickly becomes exhilarating. A very good body, rich toasted malt and a body far more intoxicating than other Dubbel. One senses in the palace of keys and a coconut flavor to both sparkling and full of flavors, especially fruit. The finish also has the slight spicy fruity. Good beer at once heady, fruity and spicy."
"D: it is hard to shell out $4 for a breweries middle beer, when the top shelf bottle can be had for $5. Despite this, I strongly recommend that you try this brew. It is among the most well crafted from one of the best breweries in the world."
"Maybe just a bit overly rich on the late mid with a few too many phenols to quaff. Otherwise, excellent throughout; a rich, enjoyable winter ale."
"Drinkability - i actually enjoyed my wife's idea of an orange and tried it as well. I couldn't make this a session beer only because of how special it is. This is to be enjoyed on an occasional basis, to celebrate something. Apparently this is what the monks drink for dinner in Watou - lucky bastards. I have to invest in a cellaring project - this would be a prime candidate."
"Pouring a slightly opaque rusty brown and giving birth to two solid fingers of lively head (could be considerably more, depending on your pour!). Settling down with light lacing, featuring a thin lingering cap of tan foam throughout the full imbibe. This beautiful concoction throws off some fruity esters, a sweet almost candy-like malt aroma. Alcohol present but well controlled amidst hints of chocolate and caramel. This one goes down smooth and delicious, somewhat sweet, warm and very easy to drink. Well done Bernardus!"
"D- Really enjoyed this beer a lot; one of my favorite dubbels."
"D-Tasty beer...yes, it's less complex and not on the same level as the Abt 12, but it's close."
"Carbonation is lighter. Mouth feel is lighter. But its flavor is strong. Not a whole lot different from the 12 which is not a bad thing. This beer is just as great but dont expect a huge difference."
"Notes: Another good offering from a good brewery. Solid Dubbel that is well spiced. Well balanced and complex flavors that interplay with each other nicely. Definitely worth a try."
"This beer is very tasty, but the St. Bernardues Tripel and Abt. 12 are far more balanced and complex."
"Cheers!"
"This beer represents St. Bernardus very well."
"Notes - Very good mouthfeel due to the expected high level of carbonation."
"Pours a nice dark chocolate with a good frothy head. Begins with a beautiful clovey nose and a bit of caramelized banana, bubblegum, brandy, and rum. Flavor is more burnt banana, with a nice clove finish. A thick feel with the right level of carbonation makes for an appealing drink. Probably the closest to Westvleteren as you can get; a real delight!"
"Drinkability - Very nice, very much like the Pater 6 only more nuanced and flavorful. At the end of the day, I'm still don't care for the high carbonation."
"D: Pretty standard for a dubbel."
"D - This is a very dark, yeasty dubbel that borders on becoming a quadruple. There is a chocolatey, roasted grain note that weaves through the flavor and influences the other flavors significantly without quite being strong enough to push the beer out of style. It becomes most prevalent in the finish, where it combines with the yeast notes of clove and allspice as well as the caramel malts to produce a complex, almost woody, rum character that lingers on the palate. A very nice beer that is well worth seeking out."
"Good flavors and nice body make this highly drinkable. Not to big, well balanced."
"D - a decent Dubbel at best...just missing a littler personality in the smell and taste, and it had kind of an unpleasant hop bite to it. it is quite refreshing but the alcohol presence tells ou to slow down."
"d - A pretty solid dubbel. I thought it smelled a little better than it tasted, but good and worth a try none the less. Not as good as Abt 12, but something I would try again."
"If you want something that has many levels of complexity, this is a must have but I dont visit it often given it's big brother is my favorite. I had the peche mortel earlier which is a beautiful beer, but even it doesnt touch this beer in complexity. For this reason, Belgian quads are the most interesting beers in the world. The Abt 12's little brother wont let you down though"
"Damn, I knew this would be good, but I didn't anticipate just how good. A fridge staple for sure, you could do much worse than stocking up on these."
"This beer pours a cloudy medium brown with a tan foamy head. Aromas of banana, nuts and orange zest leave you wanting more. The palate was medium bodied, malty but not over the top with notes of orange, toffee, and nuts lead into a malty sweet finish that really likes to linger."
"good beer, i have had some dubbel that were a little bit to bitey, this is a nice even medium."
"This doesn't have the most robust flavor I've ever gotten from a dubbel, but it is well balanced and has a nice, dark, maltiness to it. Subtle notes of brown sugar, light fruitiness, and a little bit of caramel. Creamy medium body that is excellent, with noticeable light fizzy carbonation. Soothing going down, smooth and just the right amount of carbonation. All this makes for a incredibly drinkable dubbel, which is maybe just a step or so away from perfection - or at least the best dubbel I've had."
"~Cheers"
"Poured into a St. Bernardus chalice brown with a one finger white head that disappated to a small little island of foam. Smells of carmelized sugar and belgian yeast. The taste is rather light and smooth. The belgian yeast really brings the front and back of the palette together with a sweet malt flavor in the middle. The mouthfeel is high in carbonation, which is really tricking my tounge into not really knowing what the initial flavor is. The alcohol isn't noticable."
"Drinkability: I cant believe its 8%abv. This is just an excellent beer, very easy to drink."
"D - Overall a good dubble that's nice to sip rather than gulp. The alcohol is buried well making it a silent killer."
"Definitely a good dubbel, even a great dubbel. It's a shame it smells so much better than it tastes, though the nose does enhance the experience of course."
"Overall this is a very good dubbel without any real flaws. I prefer a (perhaps Americanized) version with more malt influence but regardless, this is definitely worth a shot."
"D – As good as the Abt 12? It is so close…"
"M -"
"T - Deceivingly drinkable. Flavors come across as moderate. ABV will poke you. Can be a bit filling."
"D-very sweet and easy drinking. a hint of alcohol burn in the finish but the sweet dark fruits and high carbonation hide it well."
"It had been too long before I tried Prior 8. It won't take this long again; tremendous."
"D - Drinks well enough for a glass full of sediment. May have to reexamine this one and try for a better pour/let it sit for a bit after grabbing it."
"This guy pours a deep brown with ruby highlights subjugated in the crowd. The head is bright and strong, beneath which float disparate flakes of yeast (or such is my assumption). The aroma is sweet, with hints of molasses and fruits. The taste is rather sweet up front, with something akin to banana coming up behind. There are also hints of a wheaty quality, possibly from the yeast flakes, but tasty regardless. The body is medium at best, and sits nicely on the tongue with only an iota of carbonation. Very nice and effective dubbel."
"This brew poured to a nice mahogany color that has ruby highlights, has a thick light tan head that has incredible retention and has left a ton of lacing. On top of the cake of bubbles are some brown specks, could that be yeast? Also suspended in the beer are some floaties that I would also imagine is yeast from the secondary fermentation. The aroma here is of a roasted, bready and a biscuit malt profile that has a nice fruit scent, candy caramel is there as well. The flavors of the malts are nice, my palette is telling me the same as my nose was - roasted and bready malts, dark candy, fruit, along with a nice yeast presence. Has a nice warming feel, but in no way has and alcohol flavor, well hidden and as I finish this really sneaks up on you. This brew goes down very smoothly and all I can say is I am so happy I was able to finally track this down, not sure why I had such a hard time in this area finding it. Now I know that this is a different brew than the quad but I do feel that this brew is a clear step down from that one."
"Overall, this is ok, not a great dubbel, subpar St. Bernardus beer."
"Drinkability: This beer bears a family resemblance to the 6, but with a noticeable increase in richness and complexity of the flavors. But it retains some of the light, tart character of the 6 and is also quite refreshing to sip. A complex, subtle, and well-balanced beer that I'll be happy to have again."
"Drinkability: I did not enjoy this as much as the 6, but liked the dark fruit. That being said I will search for this again and would not pass it by."
"Fantastic Dubbel that I will be going back to again. Like the Westmalle Double, it beats its big brother in every way!"
"Drinkability: It's a serious brew. With a decent ABV and a thick body, it makes a nice dessert beer or something with which to end the evening. Anyone can approach this dubbel; it's only mildly bitter (if at all) and has plenty of familiar aromas.."
"F/D: This is a mouthful, but savor it! Love this beer and quickly becoming a huge fan of St. Bernardus. This is the closest think I've found to what I drank a lot of in Italy a couple years ago. They were big on this style in the pubs... Not Perroni."
"D: An excellent dubbel, I have found that the dubbel style seems to be based on the brewers interpretation of it; there are some that are sweet with little malt, such as this one; there are some where the malt dominates with little sweetness. Neither interpretation is bad per say, it's simply interesting that there is such a contrast in the same style. I don't think this is noticed in styles such as IPAs, Belgian Witbers, or Hefeweizens, for example. Overall, this one is quite an excellent beer, regardless of style. A sipper to be enjoyed and not simply quaffed."
"I had this one sven months later again and now the smell and taste of orange came up. A well balanced beer."
"D - A good dubble that's nice all around and nicely drinkabile as a deep sipper. The alcohol is buried well making it a silent killer too."
"O: Good drinkability. Great Beer. St. Bernardus quality"
"D- a slow sipper here thats pretty enjoyable. ill probably get a couple more of these and check them out in about a year."
"The drinkabilty doesn't get much better: great flavor and well hidden ABV plus a wonderful mouthfeel all add up to another winner from St. B"
"Taste: The taste is more pronounce in the malted sweetness but there is also a slight bitterness which is more alcohol then anything"
"Good drinkability."
"Mouthfeel- Slightly thinner than expected, high carbonation levels."
"D: This beer manages to pull off the Belgian candi characteristics with great balance. It is nice that there is no stickiness left on the palate following each swallow. The abv is well hidden. A very nice Belgian ale!"
"This is a tasty beer with a well balanced flavor. None of the spices or fruity notes are over powering. It's a bit sweeter than I thought it would be, but overall very delicious."
"D - Wow I will have another. I liked this and should be one that others should seek out."
"Excellent, and I expect nothing less from St. Bernardus."
"This a great beer - very complex but insanely drinkable for the style. Very sweet but with the right amount of toasted character and spices. Excellent."
"D - Not too high. Very complex full bodied beer with a higher ABV."
"I was thoroughly impressed with this beer. It's up there as one of the best I've had and rivals its big brother, Abt 12."
"Overall an excellent beer, it seems slightly better along side some food."
"Notes - An outstanding dubbel, one of the best. I can't believe I waited this long to try it."
"d - terrific beer and another stellar St. B."
"It's a good beer, but there are better examples of this style. No reason not to drink this though."
"Taste is nice and creamy, malty and smooth. An awesome amount of carbonation for the style. I'm really surprised by this beer, it's really good!"
"Conclusion: Good Dubbel; it's not mind-blowing, but it is rock-solid. Very traditional and tasty; though at $10-11 bucks I think I'd pick Ommegang's Abbey (at $7-8) over this 8 times out of 10."
"kelly"
"As it warms...much better. Smooth, a little creamy actually-while the head remains. Dark over-ripe fruits. Decent dubel!"
"Big thanks to HYDE for hooking this up for me! Deep brown body, topped with a fluffy beige cloud. Molasses, prunes, spices, and malt all fill the nose. Sweet and spicy. Lots of huge and heavy malt flavours, accompanied with molasses, honey, brown sugar, and spices. Warming alcohol. Very smooth muothfeel. Thanks derek!"
"D=nice beer not overly drinkable or sessionable"
"d) 750mL is enough for one person. Nice on a cool autumn day."
"Noch eins bitte!"
"Dark muddy brown with a light tan head, disappears slowly leaving very nice lacing. Aroma of dates, raisins and port wine. Flavors of dark fruit and pears, with nutmeg and cinnamon. My favorite of the line - a big beer, complex and balanced. Best candidate for storing for a few years."
"D: Quite drinkable, especially for the style."
"Boozy and slightly sour, the latter of which is kind of a shame and hurts drinkability, But this is not the kind of thing you're meant to have a bunch of and you're more fool than me if you try Find me a better dubbel and I'll be pleasantly surprised."
"Overall a very good dubbel and one that I would pick up again."
"Overall, I suspect it may not of been up to it's standard based off some of the reports here, but I bought it from what would be classed the best fine beer stockist's in Brisbane, so I dont know. I'd imagine this on tap could be a different drink altogether."
"D- although Dubbels are not my favorite style of Belgian beer, this is a nice example of the style. will definitely drink again and enjoyed the experience"
"D: Very drinkable, especially for its alcohol content at 8%, but I think in the end I actually have to give the edge to the St. Bernardus 6."
"Not that I think about it much, but Brouwerij St. Bernardus is one of my favorite Belgian breweries. Top-5 at least and maybe even top-3. Prior 8 is the second best dubbel to have ever entered my glass and is an easy recommendation to... pretty much everyone. This is outstanding ale from top to bottom and from side to side."
"This brew is good, although not really anything you can session (or at least not me). It is a nice take on the style. But the alcohol taste is too apparent."
"D: Excellent dubbel. Very drinkable for the ABV. Another great beer by St. Bernardus."
"Mouthfeel: More carbonation than I expected."
"Notes: This beer is another solid brew from St. Bernardus."
"D: Very good, like the other Bernardus beers. Different from the 6 and 8 and not just by alcohol percentage."
"More lacing was laid down and there was a touch of alcohol in the nose, which also seemed a bit thicker. All of the flavours were amped up (which is a good thing), and joined by a warming finish. The body was thicker, but the carbonation kept it from being cloying. Even better than the 6!"
"Poured a medium brown with a generous head that displayed good retention. The aroma was a musty smell to me. The taste was the sour/sweet of dark cherries. The feed was medium bodied with plenty of carbonation. Drinkability was OK, no problems with 750 ml bottle."
"Overall - This is much more than just a lighter Abt 12. Amazing."
"Drinkability is pretty high given the dryness and well-hidden alcohol, but not tasty or satisfying enough to reach for another at this price. There are many more dubbels I prefer at this price."
"Nice malt backdrop on the flavor follows the nose well. Complex and lingering with dark cherry and dried fruit yet not too much raisin. Perfectly carbonated for the structure of the beer, giving the beer a smooth feel and drink. A masterful Dubbel that has no obvious flaws and yet doesn't try to overwhelm. Not as sugary rich as many of the style, offering quality over quantity in that regard...."
"D Good. I finished the goblet without any problem."
"Drinkability: despite its sweetness and relatively high alcohol, I could probably quaff this stuff all night long."
"Medium bodied, though it drinks like a lighter-bodied beer, which I'll attribute to the carbonation level, which also gives a nice tingle. This is a great dubbel."
"#3 in my St. Bernardus sampler six pack. Poured into my 25cl Chimay goblet with a red/brown body that is dim, a 1 finger head that fizzes out after a few minutes. The lacing is moderately low on this one but a nice coat is left on top of the beer. Smell is definitely that of a solid Belgian, got the malts, some fruit, raisins and some yeast, smell is kind of subtle on this brew. Tastes of raisins, a sort of toasty taste in this one, some sweets, fruits (apples again), spices and a decent alcohol presence, but a tasteful one, it is definately balanced by the other tastes. Mouthfeel is medium, with the alcohol warming at the end of the aftertaste. The alcohol in this one might get to me after a while, the spices started to get to me before my glass was finished, still a good, tasty and refreshing dubbel."
"D - taste is great and the mouthfeel is exceptional"
"D: Extremely pleasant beer, but it never quite takes off. Alcohol is well masked, and it has a great array of flavors, just none of them really wows."
"D - This was a very good example of a Dubbel, not as awe inspiring as my favorite the Abt 12, but a wonderful beer with a great amount of complexity"
"St. Bernardus Prior 8 is a dim, cloudy, leathery brown ale with a big, fluffy, light beige head that leaves tenacious lacing. It has a grainy, bready aroma with notes of raisin and prune. It smells just a touch sweet. It's medium, maybe medium-light, bodied, smooth and fluffy and quite bubbly with a clean finish. There are dark and dried fruit flavors; notes of apple, plum, cherry and raisin bread. It's not very sweet-- almost savory, with no noticeable bitterness. It's warming at the finish and has a clean aftertaste. Very tasty."
"This is not a dubbel to drink in the Summer... more of a Fall/Spring beer. Not as easy to drink in succession like the Pater 6."
"Overall, a very nice beer. The alcohol starts to show a bit as the beer warms, so can't see having too many of these in one night, but definitely one to have if available."
"Poured from a 1 pt 9.4 oz bottle into a St Bernardus Glass. Dark amber beer beneath several fingers of tan foam. Pleasant fruity smell, barely beer like. Tastes like a cross between muscadine wine and beer. Very fruity taste. It fills the mouth with a flavor that isn't exactly what I call beer. I can truthfully say that I have never tasted anything like this. I look forward to trying more of this style beer. I would have no problem drinking the entire bottle."
"Carbonation helps mix flavors, doesn't stand out, which is nice. Goes down well, but perhaps too quickly."
"Drinkability: A sipper, but a very enjoyable one. The way the flavors blend together remind me of Christmas - the gingerbread, and the fruits. I liked this a lot. This would be great to enjoy by a fire on a cold winter day (too bad I'm drinking it in July...)."
"The last two St Bernardus beer I've had have been over carbonated and gassy, so I think that the Prior 8 may actually have been improved by gushing. Much better than the Pater 6, almost as good as the 12 in my opinion. A great beer."
"So far, I would say that I am pretty impressed with the St. Bernardus beers. I still need to try their Tripel and Quad, but this one is probably my least favorite of the ones I have had. Pretty enjoyable brew for someone who doesn't like Belgian ales all that much. Recommended."
"Worth seeking out, but not the best I've had from St. Bernardus. Go big and get the 12."
"Slick mouthfeel, good high carbonation but it does feel slightly watery."
"I thoroughly enjoyed this beer. The lovely malt character may not be for some that prefer a little more hop character but for me it was great. Wish I had grabbed a few more!"
"This is a fairly drinkable Dubbel. It has a nice appearance and smell but a little dryer & bitter than I like."
"D: 8% ABV is fairly prominent - in the aroma, the taste and the warming sensation in the pit of my stomach. One more 11.2oz bottle and I would be good to go."
"A very pleasant Belgian dubbel. Hard to say which I prefer - the Prior 8 or the Pater 6?  It's a tough call and my ratings go to show just how close these two beers are.  What I can tell you for sure is that both are fantastic dubbels in their own respects and both showcase the quality beers brewed by the monks at St. Bernardus."
"D: I must have been in a really good mood last night. To me, this beer was simply amazing. Rich and complex, I found myself thoroughly enjoying every sip. Abt 12 is up next as the last stop on my St Bernardus beer tour. Prior 8 has set the bar pretty high. Here's hoping 12 can match it."
"T/M: Lots of malts and fruity goodness. Raisin and plum with a heavy dose of carbonation. A mild medicinal taste in the back from the alcohol."
"Served in my Uprising Chalice. Appears very dark with a head full of tiny bubbles. The bubbles leave a fine lace all around the glass while I'm drinking. The taste is malty at first with hints toffee at the end. There is a hint of alcohol to the flavor, but not nearly as strong as you would think an 8% ABV beer would taste. There is a bit of noticeable carbonation in the mouthfeel, but it isn't distracting in the least. Overall, a very fine beer. I enjoy a darker Belgian style to a lighter, so I think I actually prefer thins to the St. Bernie 12. As long as I'm not driving, I could have a number of these."
"WOW! Poured a cloudy dark brown with a huge tannish head, plenty of carbonation on this brew. Nose is sugar, candied fruits, caramel, dried dark fruits, roastiness and all of this is in the taste too. This was an exceptional Dubbel. Very smooth and rich, easy drinking and probably one of the best Dubbels I have had, ever."
"4.0 D: Pretty good, not spectacular."
"D - It's a sipper."
"On tap at Oakmont pub, poured into a St. Bernardus chalice. Millimeter or so of head, black but purple-ish color (bar was dark). Smell is of wine and raisins. The taste is of raisin as spices as well as alcohol. Very thick beer. Definitely a sipper. Not what I would have thought as a dubbel."
"Drinkability- Not great, but worth a whirl."
"M, D - Coats the mouth with its full goodness, but clears out well and leaves the palate with a brightness that invites the next sip."
"D - Very drinkable."
"would not want to drink more than one in a night, but will definately enjoy again. one of my favorite dubbels. best served at cellar temp, and take your time and allow it to open up and let all sorts of new flavors come out."
"D--Except for the carbonation sting, this is a very easy drinking beer. I will definitely go back to this one in the future with a more thorough review"
"Pours a cloudy dark brown body w/ two-finger head. A husky, thick bitter malt smell with a mix of grainy roasted/toasted malts with coffee and some sweet malts like caramel. A sweet, creamy, sugary malt taste as I pick up caramel, nuts, oat as well as some chocolate. There are some dark fruit/fig tastes for balance and it finishes slightly dry thanks to some roasted malts, but overall this a medium to heavy bodied beer that is sweet. I must add that I noticed some fruit notes on the backend with the dry malt feeling - could be some hop bitterness, although it had a slight grape tinge. This is a great dubbel from St. Bernardus."
"Drinkability was superb, at no point did I not find myself not enjoying this beer. It was really hard to put my glass down between the tasting and smelling. Brilliant!"
"Drinkability: A little different from the norms of the style, and this is a very drinkable beer. The strong, dark flavor and high alcohol content make it a nice sipper."
"I found a preference to this over the triple and would drink this one again."
"OVERALL: A very enjoyable and super drinkable brew. The beer fled my glass quicker than I'd expected from an 8% beer. Doesn't quite fit the dubbel style very nicely, what with the roasted and smoky qualities, but never-the-less, this is one excellent brew I will be grabbing again the near future. I'd say this is my favorite in the St. Bernardus line; even out does the Abt. 12 for me. Recommended for sure."
"I factored the drinkability so low just because this beer is to be sipped, the flavors need be appreciated."
"Prior 8 is a very nice Dubbel. It's every bit as good as Pater 6, though neither materially distinguishes itself from the other. Yes, this one is a little stronger and has a more substantial yeasty flavor. But, I like them equally. They also suffer from the same fault. They don't have that special something that drives them to the next level. I honestly believe it's a stronger spicy flavor. That's just my take. Nonetheless, this is a very good Dubbel that's easily recommended."
"Poured from a bottle in to my St. Bernardus goblet. Poured a reddish brown with a lively huge head. In fact upon opening the bottle, foam began to seep over the top. Smell was of caramel and toffee along with roasted malts and dark fruit. Taste was amazing, subtle fruits along with toffee and caramel, similar (but even better) than the smell. This is very delicious and makes me want to come back for another sip soon. Mouthfeel was good, nice and foamy. Drinkability was high due to the incredible taste and smell. A true gem."
"D = Great beer, only issue is the flavors get a little cloying by the end of the glass."
"M&D: rather refreshing with a decent, moderate body and light fizziness, this big brother of ""Pater 6"" shows a deeper profile of dark malts yet overall lacks a level of complexity that is supposed to be built upon the junior one's virtuosity. That said, I find this an utterly drinkable sample of Dubbel, for its elegant integrity on the flavour and a total absence of alc. feel."
"Good beer. Had it as a sampler from St. Bernardus. Got a cool glass to drink it out of!"
"D - I really enjoyed this beer. I would definitely have it again. Seems to portray the Dubbel style nicely."
"Very enjoyable dark beer. Another great one from St. Bernardus."
"Go St. Bernardus! Another great beer. Pours deep mahogany in color with some sediment, big creamy head. Great retention and lacing. Smell is of sweet dark fruit, pear, and white grape. Overall very sweet. Taste is very similar. Some sweet bicuit malt with apple, pear, and other sweet fruit. Some earthiness and grass. Mouthfeel is very light. Almost champagne like on the first sip due to the higher carbonation. Dry, sweet aftertaste. Overall a great beer and easy drinker. The ABV is well hidden and this is a great slow sipper at warmer temps."
"Creamy one finger head on the pour that left heavy lace upon swirling. The beer appeared a dark red-amber when held to light and was a bit clouded due to the yeast sediment remaining from the bottle conditioning process. The aroma was lightly fruity and sweet- the distinct tart odor of the Belgian yeast came through and offered a complex and appealing twist to the blend of scents present. The carbonation is high, but feels good to the inside of the mouth, tingling all over, and the overall mouthfeel is smooth and substantial, but not so thick as to linger long on the tongue after swallowing. The flavor is nice, true to the name of a dubbel; very good and well balanced. The finish is there but dissipates quickly, although the remaining flavors of clove and malt are very pleasant while they last. Would definitely drink again, but not every day."
"Very good ale!"
"This is yet another excellent ale from St. Bernardus. A real treat when and if you can find one."
"Apparently St. Bernardus 8 doesn't crack the list of my favourite dubbels. Nevertheless, it's a beer I greatly enjoy. In an ideal world, this would be present at more dinner tables and in more cold cellars than is currently the case. This abbey may not have the legal rights to bear the Trappist logo, but their beers have every bit the same quality and historical significance."
"There was a big fig aroma, unmistakeable. With air, an aroma of walnuts, but more than that ... pumpernickel loaf. Taste is figs, dates, sweet dried prune. The mouthfeel struck me as superb, nicely balanced, bitterness is muted but in the mix with the malt and yeast. Slight hints of dark fruit start to emanate with more tilting of the glass, green or dark cherry from a brandy fruit cake but with sugars well in the background so the sweetness never takes on a life of its own or becomes cloying. Overall, a real treat for north american tastebuds, beers like this distinguish the true beer lovers from the party animals and the uninitiated. I could use a few more of these to remind me every so often of just how rich the beer experience can be."
"D - Very drinkable."
"Light and creamy with a malty backbone,strong carmell with a good sharp metallic edge. Dark fruitiness lightly blended through the mix with a earthy feel ,well balanced with a nice tart woody bitterness.The alcohol is pretty well hidden kicking the drinkabilty up a notch. A very nice Belgian,one that worths keeping on hand."
"Pours a murky reddish/iced-tea color, beautiful soft foamy sand-colored head isn't going anywhere anytime soon, and various-sized floaties hanging around. Smell is doughy, yeasty, fresh baked bread, some dark fruit. Flavors follow right along, with more raisin and fig throwing down, and a slight hit of flavor from the alcohol. Very fine carbonation, but creamy as well. This is just delicious, and very drinkable."
"Overall- This may be my favorite beer by St. Bernardus. It is super complex and very drinkable, this beer is great!"
"D - very tasty beer. I prefer this one to the pater 6 because its finish isn't quite as dry."
"D- I couldn't drink more than 1 or 2 due to the carbonation, but definitely not a boring beer."
"7/4/8/4/15 (3.8/5)"
"Drinkability moderate. Strong and a sipper for sure."
"Gorgeous beer. Can't go wrong with this one."
"drinkability: This was almost as good as chimay red. Very similar but if I remeber corretly I emjoyed the shimay better, but not by much, Very solid Dubbel"
"This is a worthy and more widely available (though still pricey) substitute for Westvleteren 8."
"Dark amber, bordering on brown with a smallish off-white head and very little lacing. Aroma off the bat is yeast, light chocolate and raisins, earthy, with a bit of banana and a touch of herbal grassy hops in the background. Flavors of grapes, raisins, light chocolate, bruised apple, minerals and earthiness. There seems to be this grape lollipop flavor on the front end that's odd. Agressive carbonation, medium bodied. This is a very complex yet tasty beer. Definitely the Pater 6's big bro."
"In many ways this beer was pretty much as I expected, being a Belgian Abbey Ale and having an ""8" in the title, immediately made me think of the Rochefort 8, and indeed it pours a similar cloudy brown although with a more frothy head, tinged with beige. The nose was malty, with touches of cocoa. The maltiness of the nose came through again in the sweetness of the beer, although the body was on the thinner side of the Rochefort, which while not reaching the heights of those august ales is no bad thing."
"Some fizz to this helps keep this dancing on your tongue, and keeps it drinkable. Great balance in flavors and texture. Not something you could drink all night, but you could do two. If you like Belgians, try this."
"M: Light in body with plenty of carbonation and a drying finish that enhances the drinkability"
"Pours a clear cream soda brown with a small tan head. Aroma is sweet dates and cherries as well as caramel. Flavor is sweet and malty initially then more fruity. Finish is more of the same smooth malt notes and a start of a winous feel. Otherwise extremely well hidden alcohol. Nice but not fantastic. Light to medium body."
"Highly recommended."
"Complexity enhanced by tasty yeast prominence."
"Drinkability: Not quite as good as this brewery's other offerings, but a nice dubbel. I have friends who would probably like this a lot better than I do."
"Sweet and thick with a definite level of alcohol warmth. Decent body, but not as thick as some Belgians. Nice light hop in the swallow. Very smooth and easy to drink."
"Very good brew."
"This is one of the better examples from the Dubbel style that I've tried. Enjoyed it much more than the Pater 6. Very nice one and worth a shot."
"MF&D - Highly carbonated but went down pretty good for 8% ABV."
"Notes - I know why the monk on the bottle is so happy, he gets to bottle this nectar of the Gods for a living."
"D= pretty average. Not my style but very tasty"
"A very fine dubbel from St. Bernardus, but I expect nothing less from these merry monks. Pours a rich murky brown with a silky dark tan head. The nose has sweet bready malts, peppery yeasts, chocolate, ripe pitted fruits and subtle hops. The flavor is equally complex, yet perfectly balanced. Rich, full body suits style well. I could enjoy one of these anytime."
"D= This beer is simply a slightly ""larger"" version of the ""6". That might seem like a silly thing to say but not all Belgian breweries make a weaker and a stronger version of the same dubbel. Very drinkable despite the ABV."
"D - At 8 percent and being this malty not sure if I could have more than two of these. I had the 6 prior to this which I thought was more drinkable, but the 8 is much more complex. Not as drinkable or candy-sweet as the Westy 8, but still a very good beer in its own right."
"D: An exceptional dubbel with classic earthiness and a perfect mouthfeel that makes it hard to beat."
"A sweet beer overall with a decent abv. Easy to savor and enjoy."
"Cloudy mahogany with a small off-white head. Malt, dark fruits, vanilla, and musty spice in the aroma. Heavy malt backbone with spun sugar, corriander, raisins, and a sherry-like alcohol flavor. Dense, sticky mouthfeel. A little too thick and sweet for me."
"Pours a very dark brown colored body, with a very slightly off-white head, big and lasting, smooth. Has an aroma of citrus, lavender, and spices. A slightly bitter, slightly sweet taste. Some molasses, warming, with a good mouthfeel, somewhat alcoholy."
"D: Not my favorite of the St.B's beers so far. Pater 6 and ABT 12 come with much higher recommendations."
"Amazing beer. One of the best."
"Bottle. Caramel pour with slightly red tinge and a bit cloudy. Nice lacing and a medium tan head that tasted almost as good as the beer itself. Aroma of Belgian yeast. Taste of caramel, yeast and faint orange and nectarine with sugar and spice. Very complex. Smooth yet full finish."
"D: An incredibly sweet and smooth beer per style full of rich caramel, bread, ripe fruit that was superbly brewed to produce a great drinking beer."
"Great characterful beer."
"Pours a dark brown color with a huge frothy beige head. Aroma of dark fruit, alcohol and chocolate. Very tasty beer with lots of malty chocolate, raisin, prune, plum, spice and alcohol. Nice soft carbonation up front with a sweet malty center and nice dry, spicy finish."
"This is a must-try if you like sweet, dark Belgian-style ales. Would be a great accompaniment to jerk chicken."
"Mouthfeel is smooth, but slightly watery."
"Not a stunning dubbel, but a solid representative. A good starter for those not familiar with the style."
"Not a bad Dubbel, but I have had much better. Not very complex. Though a pleasant enough example of the style. I always like to support Abbey and Trappist Ales as well."
"Drinkability: The dark fruits aren't as complex as with other dubbels; still, a quality brew"
"D: This is a good abbey beer. It's not the most striking Dubbel in flavour I've ever had, but it is distinctly Belgian and it would make a great starting point for those just beginning to get into Belgium's wonderful and diverse brews. It's got something in there for everyone I think. One of the most drinkable high gravity brews I've ever had. Recommended."
"Excellent Beer!"
"Overall a great dubbel, finishing slightly sweeter than others adds to its drinkability."
"As with a fair amount of Dubbel offerings the whole is greater than the sum of this one's parts. Quite drinkable with well-hidden alchohol. Part of one of the better gift sets I've seen in a while."
"I have had this beer before and i don't remember it tasting like this. This is not to say I am disappointed, just I remember this beer differently. I wonder what aging would do to this one. Good beer, just not what I remembered."
"This poured an opaque brown with light tan head. It smelled like creamy sweet yeast and caramel malt and grassy hops. It tasted like rich malty caramel and creamy yeast, with orange and lime hops. The yeast became more pronounced as it warmed. It was watery with some carbonation, and had a bittersweet aftertaste. Overall this had very nice flavor that was fairly simple but very clean and enjoyable. Texture was good too, and alcohol was well hidden, making this easy to rink. Very nice dubbel."
"Drinkability is good but it's special enough to just savor the one small serving for an entire evening."
"Drinkability is relatively high. It's a nice tasting beer, and a nice experience. I prefer the 12 and tripel, but would certainly buy this one again."
"The beer poured a cloudy brown with a light tan head. The aroma is a spicy crystal malt. The taste is sweet malt, an almost peppery set of spices, and a wonderful alcohol burn. The feel is heavy and wet. I liked this one, just a nice smooth spicy beer with a good bit of alcohol in the beer and apparent in the taste. Definately one I'll need to sample again in the future."
"Nice full feel and an easy drinking beer that sends some warmth to the head after a few sips. Not my favorite dubbel."
"This is a winner for me. Very tasty & satisfying. Recommended Belgian Dubbel."
"D - Good beer but for the price there are a lot of better beers."
"The taste was not overly complex, but a nice balanced combination of malt and hops. The mouthfeel was super smooth giving the beer a great finish."
"Overall a very drinkable dubbel, but I prefer some others I have tried."
"The flavors are too mild and powdery compared to other Belgian dubbels in the land. Worth a taste."
"D - I don't find this the most drinkable Dubbel in the world. That I found it somewhat buttery like an English Brown didn't help. I find Chimay Red a much drier, more elegant example."
"pours up a nice dark brown color with maroon edges when held to the light. fantastic frothy off-white head with great retentive lacing. the nose has wonderful spices, candy sugar (my girl suggests candy red apple), slight alcohol scent, subtle caramel, dark fruits for sure, strawberries, slight dry vanilla as it warms up, smells like a very festive beer! The taste is subtle cocoa, darker malts, subtle sweet malts, darker fruits, plums, very carbonated, dry finish, medium to full bodied, syrupy taste left behind in my mouth. Nice complex brew....thats why I love St. Bernardus..I wonder if its the same beer as St. Sixtus?"
"Drinkability: What's the ABV on this puppy? ...eight percent. Flavor is pretty strong and body is heavy. Lump that together with a fairly big ABV and what do you get? Lower drinkability. Good beer, but I'm fine with just one."
"Another selection from a St. Bernardus mixed 6 pack I recently purchased. This one pours a hazy dark brown color (similar to the last one the Pater 6). Nice foamy head that does taper off a bit. Aroma is slightly malty and grainy but it's faint, there's just not much there. There is however quite a bit of flavor. It seems relatively full-bodied too. The taste is malty, quite sweet, brown sugar, with some fruit and caramel. It all blends in nicely, but it's not the type of beer I would drink several of at one seating. Good thing too as it's not cheap."
"Drinkability: Paired very well with some Pinback mp3's. A delightful dubbel, to be sure, I'll see how it compares to the Abt 12 which is up next."
"Once again an excellent brew from St. Bernardus. Would serve this up any day of the week but be careful cause the moderate ABV can jump up and grab ya."
"This beer was simply amazing. I had high expectations for it, and it surpassed them. Pours a deep, acorn colour with a nice, slightly brown head that reminded me of cinnamon baked goods. Plenty of chunky yeasts. I did not decant. I like the yeast. The scent was beautiful. Plenty of baked bread, yeast, malts, vanilla, grapes, apples, pears... It was like a nice farmer's market on a Sunday. Oh God, the taste. Exquisite. Not overly complex, but a blend of different flavours, all getting an equal share. Plenty of fruits, caramel, bit of honey, breads... Even a bit of a flavour I can't quite put my finger on. A woody flavour. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, smooth and a bit carbonated. Drinkable? Yes. I could sip a glass all day and not tire of it."
"Prior 8 is super-smooth and fullish in body with vivid carbonation that aids this drink into unmitigated quaffability."
"D: Very drinkable for a doppel. Great taste really enjoyable. Gonnan try the Pater and Abbot for sure."
"It's a quality beer, perhaps a little overhyped. Definitely worth a try, maybe two or three."
"Nicely put together. I really like dubbels in the winter for they seem to warm me up as this one did. Could not resist trying it on tap, though. Fairly drinkable, but one is enough."
"Very nice beer....I am really high on the Belgian styles."
"Overall this is a great dubbel, and deserves the praise."
"D: This is a great beer but you probably don't want to hit too many. One a night is more than enough. This beer has amazing balance and feel, Can't wait to experience the other brews this brewery has to offer."
"I picked this up after trying other Belgium styles and have not been impressed. To me this really tastes like a grape soda that has been infused with alcohol. It was too sweet for me but I can see this beer appealing to those who don't have alot of experience with many Belgium styles."
"Drinkability: Very high."
"Pours a dark brown color with a fluffy white head with some little speckles in it. Smells of dried fruit and malt, and tastes very mildly of figs, blackberries and some other assorted spices. Lots of little hints of flavors, but jsut not much overall quantity of flavor. I got bored before finishing the glass; just not that interesting overall."
"D- Not as flavorful and complex as I expected, but a very enjoyable dubbel."
"D- A nice dubbel. I really enjoyed the immense pepper."
"D: Low, but only because this is so amazing. I want to savor one of these over a long period, and I will only drink this on occasion."
"highly quaffable beer. Highly recommended"
"Top notch brew, highly recommended!"
"Notes: Decent dubbel."
"Ah the ocho. A very fine dubbel."
"D: Good drinkability and better than the 6, but still not a great dubbel."
"A very good tasting ale. This one can creep up on ya...glad I bought a 4 pack. I'll have more tonight but keep the other 2 for later."
"D - This was pretty easy to drink it has a good taste I'd get this for someone new to Belgians worth a try"
"Poured this 11.2oz bad boy into my Val-Dieu goblet. Pours a cherry brown with mahogany tones when held up to the light. Poured a huge, creamy-tan head that stuck around the entire length of the beer and left really sticky lacing down the length of the glass. This is a really pretty beer. Smell was a bit of a let down. There are definite notes of figs and raisins and just a hit of cinnamon. Not much else. This has a very straightforward aroma. Taste is interesting. There are the definite notes of a normal Dubbel but there is an after taste that I can't quite place my tongue on. The only thing I can say is that it tastes like the flavors I sometimes see in my homebrews. Not a bad taste, not even necessarily off. Mouthfeel is medium bodied that finishes dry. Nothing would prevent me from buying this beer again."
"A full flavored, balanced Dubbel. Probably the most flavorful, authentic version of the style I've had to date. Tough to find flaws."
"Overall: Those monks at St. B sure know what they are doing. Love their quad and triple and the dubbel does not disappoint either. There is a reason they have been brewing beer for as long as they have and this is one of them."
"An easy Belgian to drink."
"D: Smooth, with a lingering of alcohol."
"This has a nice dark fruit and slightly sweet flavor. Finishes clean with a medium body and good carbonation. The sweetness doesn't hang around at all. The beer is easy to drink and ABV is not detectable. A very nice Dubbel and a benchmark for the style. Cost, high ABV, and availability hurts drinkability."
"As I stated earlier, I like a beer who's head stays throughout the drink, this beer has that trait. It is also a dam good tasting beer."
"Overally a very nice beer, as was expected from St. B. Pretty easy to drink, fairly complex, everything a Belgian should be really."
"Drinkability is superb, but i need to watch myself. It goes down like a session beer, but beware!"
"Prosit, MK"
"Out of a 750ml corked and caged bottle. Pours a cloudy mud puddle brown color with a nice khaki colored head that left some spotty lacing all over the glass. The smell is of brown sugar, fig, and raisins; sweet and a tad funky. The taste is of raisins/prunes, candi sugar sweetness and a light bready malt. The feel is moderate with prickly carbonation and finishes sweet but not slick. A very nice sweet dubbel which is very drinkable. I would prefer a bit more of a malty presence in my dubbel to distinguish it from a BSDA and to balance out the sweetness."
"Pours a rich brown color with a nice white, thick, fluffy head. The head resides after sometime and leaves a thick lace film down the sides of the glass. It smells of caramel and bread...with a bit earthiness to it. The taste is of sweet malts, fruits, biscuits, yeast, and a dash of hoppiness towards the end. It has a medium body and finishes incredibly. Overall, extremly well executed beer...very well done."
"Drinks too easy, I'd guess this at a bout 6.5 abv if I didn't know. Easily one of my favorite dubbels, now that I've tasted it!"
"Nice, but nothing special when placed next to other St. Bernardus selections. Nice aroma with pine, caramel malts and apples. Appearence is a muddy brown with smallish off-white head. Lacing as always excellent from St. Bernardus. Flavor is sweet throughout with a nutty, yeasty finish."
"This is a must try! Gotta love the dubbels."
"St. Bernardus Prior 8 pours a reddish brown with a short cream colored head. It gives off a mild smell that is a bit yeasty. The taste is mellow, with hints of fruit and a slight yeast aftertaste. Mouthfeel is smooth, but also highly carbonated. This is definitely a good beer to drink, but the high carbonation and yeasty aftertaste hinders this brews drinkability a bit for me."
"Drinkability: Delicious dubbel, easy drinking, not too alcoholic or overwhelming. Good Winter warmer beer."
"Pours a dark reddish-brown with about a finger of tan head that exhibited decent retention. Aroma is quite good, malts and dark fruits. Taste is good as well. Sweet caramel malts, a touch of chocolate, and huge fruity esters. Some fig and dark cherries with tons of raisins interplay quite nicely with just a touch of spiceyness and a bit of alcohol. Overall very complex and enjoyable. Mouthfeel is good, medium-full body with medium carbonation, quite smooth. Drinkability is quite good. This is a complex and interesting brew that is a pleasure to sip and enjoy."
"A good beer to try at least once but not one I'll seek out again. Nothing really special for a beer of it's type, bot not bad either."
"I could drink these all night. the more belgian beer i sample the more i fall in love!"
"Overall, this is a very tasty brew. I like the 12 a bit better, but this is certainly recommended."
"M + D: A similar, lively carbonation that comes across as a just a touch harsh on the tongue, as with the Pater. This seems perhaps a little wetter, and so it is a offers some rather nice gulps from the goblet. In terms of drinkability, I would lean towards the lighter 6, simply to avoid being overwhelmed with another."
"Poured in to a small mug because the bar had no proper Belgian glasses, oh well. Foamy head, pretty good retention. Lots of yeasty, hay,floral, sweet candy smells coming through. Taste is very sweet, bready, feel a little alcohol bite at the end. Very sticky mouthfeel. This one is a sipper, almost a little too sweet for my taste, but I could definatley enjoy this very much as dessert."
"D - Each sip begs for another. Nice."
"Red, slightly cloudy body with thick head and sparse lace. Warm leather, slightly sour smell with a little alcohol and spice. Malty IF with sweet, alcoholic aftertaste. Medium bodied with active carbonation and alcoholic finish. Good overall, but I felt that the alcohol came through a little strong."
"Very nice, though."
"I'll admit up front that St. Bernardus is one of my favorite breweries. The Prior 8 is no exception, though I admit I like Abt 12 a little more. It has a somewhat darker appearance, common to dubbels. It has a fruity, subtle smell to it. The taste is excellent, though the alcohol does creep through a little in its taste. Like other St. Bernardus brews, it has a fantastic mouthfeel: lively and highly carbonated. This is an incredibly drinkable beer, one with more personality than most."
"This is a great beer, and a good Dubbel. Recommended."
"Drinkability: Had no problem going back to this brew. Great beer to sip on and really appreciate the complex flavors."
"The flavor was strong on the malt with a bread taste in the front. It was sweet all through out. The mouthfeel gives you a well rounded carbonation with a real bready taste left all over the mouth. Overall one of the better Dubbel's I have tried."
"From an 11.2 oz bottle copped singly from Total Wine and More in Union, this Belgian staple pours a gorgeous ruby-red, mahogany brown color with a huge frothy head that displays good staying power... smell is very malty and sweet, strong aroma with a rich, thick, and full flavor to match... taste is extremely malty with a distinct sweetness pulling through, present with a fig and prune taste filled with caramel and dark notes... a really good example of the style... awesome brew... slight alcohol presence, but hard to detect behind a great conglomeration of flavors... top-notch sample that was worth the price... first brew from St. Bernardus, and am eager to experience their other well-known styles... Recommended.."
"drinkability - Dummy me, i opened it after it said it can be stored for 10 years. I saw a lot of sediment on the bottom and I have a record of keeping beers around too long in the cellar. Why didn't I buy this before?!"
"D: I am not a particular fan of dubbels but this one is very good. Drinkable and complex. Not overly sweet."
"I wish I could buy this in New Mexico. If I could, itd probably be a regular."
"Taste: Luscious and complex taste that just spreads across the tongue. This is the kind of taste I have come to expect from St. Bernardus. Starts with a nice malty character - toasted as well as caramel. Then comes a spiced fruity note that I likened to cinnamon and plum. Finishes smooth with a light sweetness. Exceptional taste for a dubbel, and a new favorite of the style."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable. Masks its alcohol superbly."
"This is a decent brew. Very drinkable, high ABV is almost unnoticeable. Flavor is balanced and smooth."
"Easy to drink and good, will be drinking this again."
"D: i feel like the prior 8 is all nose, little bite (besides carbonic). a delicious dubbel, but with such rich aromatics, the flavor in the mouth leaves more to be desired."
"This is one of my favorite dubbels. It pops open just like a belgian should, no weak ass apologetic pop like some. Pours dark brown and at first reminds me of chimay red. however it is a little nuttier and not as plain. bread and spice on the nose. Good dark fruit, raisin or fig on the initial taste and lighter fruits on the finish abv is well hidden, smooth and very drinkable."
"Beer pours a nice brown or very dark red with a big thick head and it has a big malty aroma with some chocolate and faint fruit. Taste is a tad thin, some dark fruits, black cherries, prunes and clove. Fairly sweet with only a hint of bitterness at the end. A good beer that I would never run down, but the other choices from St. Bernardus stand out a bit better for me."
"D- Another stellar offering from Bernardus is not surprising, well-balanced and complex with a smooth and creamy profile, flavors open upon warming and the alcohol is well-masked"
"This one is not as good to me as the Abt. 12 but is a great representation of the style. I wasn't sure what to expect when I opened the bottle, and I am very pleased. Just another A+ from these guys."
"This caps off a memorable evening of beerdrinking, starting with the St. B. Abt 12, then the Tripel, and now the Prior 8. I expected the first to be best and then down in scale for the others, but it's almost the reverse. These St. Bernardus brews are incredible... all of them!"
"D: To be fair this is only the second dubbel Ive tried and it puts the alagash to shame, that is for sure. So quite a drinkable beer in my opinion."
"Aroma is strongly malty and yeasty with hints of banana and fruity sweetness. Color is dark brown, rather chocolaty, with a fairly persistent head. Flavor is rich and malty with a hint of sweet and some fruity and smoky undertones. Finish is smooth and lively, and has a ribbon of hop bitterness. Overall a very satisfying ale."
"Mouthfeel is full bodied and slightly doughy. Very enjoyable."
"Milk chocolate brown liquid with an egg white head that doesn't go away until you're done drinking. Hazy sediment appearance. Malty grain smell. Tastes of yeast, alcohol, bread, and fruity undertones. This beer has ample carbonation in the feel and leaves a pleasant bready malt taste on the palate. It warms the whole way down. :) A wonderful sipping beer to have with a few friends."
"This is a great Dubbel but I actually prefer from the tap over the bottle. It seemed to have more depth."
"This small bottle version is much, much better than the 25 ouncer, IMO."
"This beer is completely different from the St. B. 12, and I don't know if I don't like it better. Today I like it very much. Quite impressive."
"D- a solid dubbel, very enjoyable,"
"Lovely chestnut brown with a creamy, dense, off white head. The aroma is sublime, with dark fruits, roasted malts, yeast, and a hint of the alcohol. Taste is much like the aroma, with notes of chocolate, raisins, and spices. The mouthfeel is perfect, with well balanced carbonation. This is the best dubbel I have had, from what may be my favorite brewery. This was part of a Saint Bernardus variety case which was pricey, but worth it. Treat yourself!"
"Almost too thin of a mouthfeel, but the strong Belgian carbonation helps create an unreal smoothness. Very drinkable, but I don't think I could manage much beyond the twelve oz. I've consumed. I admit I'm rarely wowed by any dubbel, but this is a great job from an amazing brewery."
"A very nice beer. It manages to be extremely full flavored yet very smooth. I will have to try Westy 8 again, but as I recall I like this beer much better."
"Review translated from french 10-26-2008."
"Overall very enjoyable beer but I don't see myself drinking more than 2 in one evening."
"A medium dark golden brown with reddish highlights. Moderately cloudy and produces a very big, persistent, somewhat sticky head. Carbonation is significant, somewhat fizzy like a weisbier but found it pleasant. Smell is yeasty and balanced. Taste and mouthfeel: slightly caramel, yeasty, moderately creamy, with a slightly pepperish tang to the sides of the tongue. Alcoholic dimension is noticable but not unpleasant. Taste continues to evolve for several moments - this beer makes a big impression. Coating of yeast on bottom at the end."
"O: Much like the Pater 6, this beer is a joy to drink and goes down easy!"
"Cheers!"
"d: enjoyed this one - no surprise given their other beers. balance was very good and was easy to drink"
"Drinkability: Good beer. Not spectacular, but very good. The rating here would be a bit higher if the taste was a bit more powerful. Definitely worth a try though."
"Pours a dark ruby with a nice two finger off-white head that stays forever. Stickiness, well the head is enormous and stays that way and leaves its mark on the sides. Smell is complex: yeasty goodness, dark fruits, banana, brown sugar, molasses, and fresh honey. Very rich and full on the nose. I know I couldn't get all the smells because there are so many, but hey, I tried. Taste starts off a bit metallic which I didn't enjoy that much. Once that goes away, some sweet caramel sweetness takes over. Some nut bread flavors blend well with the fig and raisins. Good taste, but the Westy has the edge in taste in my opinion. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a creamy carbonation. Not as pillowy as the Westy 8, but still pretty good. I'm drinking a 750 mL bottle and I don't see a probelm finishing it at all. Good Dubbel, pick it up if you see it on the shelves."
"An amazing Belgian brew from St. Bernardus who know a thing or two when it comes to making them. An absolute joy to drink. Highly recommended."
"Overall- Great beer. Not as good as the Abt 12 but still a solid brew."
"I would definetely try this beer again."
"Had this one at a beer tasting at a friend's house. He claimed to not be a Belgian ale fan, which I don't get, but to each his own. This one was excellent: poured a cloudy amber color with a nice bit of fluffy head on top. Nose was lots of dried fruit, raisins in particular, and that cookie scent common to a lot of Belgian dark beers. Flavor is similar. Lots of cookies, a dose of chocolate, honey, butter, deliciousness. A touch of warming alcohol in there. Body was full and creamy, appropriately carbonated. I really liked this one; not quite at the level of the 12, but a very tasty dubbel."
"Decided to get a bottle of this to celebrate the arrival of the BA September magazine on my doorstep (and their profile of this style). Poured in to a large red wine glass a brownish red color, with a beautiful white head that lasts throughout. Lots of tiny air bubbles make their way towards the top of the glass. Aroma has traces of buttery sweet bread, brownies and dark fruits such as plum and date. Taste reveals tons of fruit, dates and figs being the most pronounced of the bunch. Sweet honey can be tasted in the middle, followed by the sweet bready character at the end. Mouthfeel is creamy and medium in body. Seems like an easy beer to drink but I have a feeling that the ABV might catch up to me after this glass is finished. A lovely Dubbel, and one of the best I have tried in a long time. Would pair well with any hearty meal I am sure."
"Drinkability: I can drink this all night."
"D- A tasty and worthwhile brew. I do prefer the Pater 6 as far as dubbels go though."
"In summation, yes. Yes, this is a fantastic beer within a fantastic style, and I couldn't be more vague and specific in its spectacularity than that."
"Hazy dark crimson hue. Creamy, thick beige head. Loose lace. Soft, yeasty aroma w/ subtle notes of fig and cinnamon. Hints of chocolate and raisiny sweetness. Mellow dark caramel and banana esters as well in aroma. Bourbon laced sweetness upfront, followed by nutty malt and hints of toffee. Dark, ripe figs and prunes add a dark fruity overlay. Well calculated light bitterness leaves a pleasant residual sweetness. Moderate in body and mearly perfectly smooth in mouthfeel. Understated banana esters and clove. Finishes w/ a hint of buttery malt and fading yeast must. Prior 8 is quite a tasty brew. It's not overly complex, but rather soft and tremendously balanced. Akin to a milder version of Rochefort 8. Most worthy of a 750 ml portion-- 11.2 oz teases the palate."
"Thanks to my neighbor across the way for sharing this Belgian delight!"
"Comment: I must confess that I am a fan of the magic that comes from Brouwerij St. Bernardus. I rank the Quad among the best and the tripel is close to if not the best in my estimation. However, this effort is admirableit smells great, tasks wonderful, but its malty sweetness limits its drinkability."
"M/D-medium bodied, full flavored, very complex(put this one up with a bottle of wine), and moderately clean mouthfeel for a such big beer."
"The label is different now."
"Drinkability - A nice sipping beer that is very enjoyable. There is a strong alcohol presence that can sneak up on you due to the malty sweetness. Good stuff."
"Beautiful dark bodied pour with a modest head that has great retention and outstanding presence. The smell is the weakest link yet still pleasant with some noteworthy spices, lacking in complexity but still smoothly simple. The taste is remarkable with just enough of a dark bitterness and a hint of syrupy flavoring that fades quickly but would make a delicious pairing with sharp cheeses. The mouthfeel could not be more balanced if it tried with a light character and a hint of dry carbonation. Delightful and delicious."
"Prior 8 is very enjoyable and surprisingly quite drinkable."
"D - St. Bernardus knows good beer. Nuff said."
"Drinkability--Not quite the abt 12, but just on the heels and good enough to still score a 5. This is one of the best beers in the world and one I would gladly drink everyday of my life. Nice heady beer that is must drink, especially if you love the best...Belgian beer."
"Pours a deep amber, forming a thick 1 inch head. Medium spots of lace. The aroma is a mix of malt, dark fruit aromas, and a hint of alcohol. The taste is malts, dark fruits, and a bit of sugar sweetness. Complex and smooth. Mouthfeel is medium. Very drinkable dubbel! Overall I was impressed with this dubbel, as I have been with all the brews I have tried from St. Bernardus. Full complex flavor. Highly recommended!!!"
"Overall: A great beer, these abbey brews can't be beat."
"the bottles can be somewhat pricey (mine was $3.99), but this brew is well worth it!"
"D: Since it tastes well-rounded and has a great mouthfeel, I'd say this is one drinkable beer. Another great Belgian from St. Bernardus."
"Flavor was a superb dubel. Lots of rich malts. Belgian sugars provided a nice solid base to this beer. Dark fruits such as prunes and dark cherries. Bits of dark grabes and dried raisins too. Could not pick out any heat from the alcohol at all but it sure hit m pretty good. Vinuous and heavy mouthfel that did a great job just coating the cheeks."
"Bottle opens with a satifying burst of carb. Pours dark mahogony brown with some burgandy tints. Nice tan head that falls a little quicker than i would have expected. I nice cap is sustained by the constant stream of bubbles. The trails of lacing stream down the glass slowly but leave no residue behind. Smell is malty with some dark fruit overtones. Raisins are also noticable. Taste follows suit. Creamy mild finish that is inhanced by the supper active carbonation on the tongue. A high quality beer as expected."
"Drinkability is good, considering the high abv. The taste is strong enough to take notice but not overpowering or so sweet that it becomes annoying after a while. Not an everyday beer but very enjoyable."
"Poured from a corked magnum into a brandy snifter. The beer pours a not quite opaque dark brown with a great head that lasted and left spotty lacing. The aroma was of dried fruits, malts and some candi sugar. The taste was dominated by dried fruits with some molasses and dark malts. The beer was rather heavy and the alcohol was present. This one took me a while, but I did enjoy it."
"Dark brown with a thick dense head. Aroma of sweet malt and dark candi sugar. Delicious sweet chocolate and treacle flavours with berry fruitiness. Full bodied. An outstanding, complex, sweet, dark ale. As good as the 12."
"A tasty beer to savour. Wouldn't drink lots of these but every once in a while it'd be pretty good."
"On tap at Zenos in State College. A- Medium-dark, murky, brown with a very small, foamy, off-white head that quickly diminishes to a film S- Floral and fruity hops balanced by sweet malts. Herbs, honey, brown sugar. T- More sweet malts and those Belgian yeast flavors Ive grown to love. Good bit of clove. M- Medium-full body, dry texture, moderate-low carbonation. D- This one just has a good overall feel and flavor. I enjoyed it."
"D- I really like it just wish it had a bit more fruits and less malts and also didn't have the champagne carbonation feel to it. Other than those 2 things it is very nice. I do think I prefer their triple though (even though I usually prefer dubbels)."
"Drinkability is good given the abv."
"The mouthfeel is creamy, smooth, and medium-bodied, and the carbonation is perfect. Excellent drinkability."
"11.2fl oz bottle poured into a St. Bernardus chalice. The aroma is perfect! Sweet bready malt, yeast and dark fruit make up the rather enticing nose. The taste explodes with sweet malt, dough, dark fruits and a hint of chocolate. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy. Overall, this is a superb representation of the dubbel style that is highly recommended."
"This is an outstanding example of a Belgian Dubbel if there ever was one. The beer poured a dark brown, slightly cloudy, with some yeasty bits floating on the bottom. Nice head, great lacing, the head is an off white. This beer has a wonderful fruity, sweet, somewhat malty aroma, and the taste won't disappoint. The taste is sweet malt, a little yeasty, wonderful fruits popping through, not too much hop flavor except maybe on the end. It is your typical Belgian in that there are plenty of candied sugars used in the fermentation and that is what makes this beer what it is. The after taste is smooth, there is some alcohol notes coming through too, but mostly on the end, but not really that much for a beer with 8 ABV. It actually hides its rather highish alcohol content very well. This is just a wonderful beer. L'Chaim."
"Beer decanted perfectly into my Duvel glass. It poured a ruby brown color, with yeast sediment visible, with a perfect long lasting off white head. Nose is splendid, of bananas, sweet malts, and dark fruits. Taste is pretty much the same as the nose with a drying hop finish. The alcohol is ever so slightly warming. Mouthfeel is nicely carbonated, fairly full, and very smooth. Drinkability is near perfect. This is a pretty darn good representation of the Dubbel style!"
"Drinkability: Exceptionally easy to drink despite the big ABV."
"Drinkability is good, nothing wrong with putting a few of these away."
"D - Very tasty and easy to drink for 8% ABV."
"A superb choice in a Belgian. The 12 is still superior overall, but this is a worthy alternative."
"A very nice beer, I like this brewery."
"04 08 10. Poured into a chalice, with a multi-colored head that's stained several shades of Kool-Aid; interestingly, this beer was much much darker in the glass that it was in the bottle. A simple review of the nose and flavor profile would consist of two words: ""beer pez."" Sickeningly saccharine sweet, with noticable candi sugar priming. This beer has many similar elements evident in the quadruppel, but somehow they come across as flaws here. Carmel malt pez candy is the obvious one. Sugar in the Raw. Mouthfeel is too chalky for the body, another ""flaw"" I don't mind with the 12. Lots of tiny bubbles. Too much flavor, and not enough of the right flavors. Not for me."
"Walnut colored body topped by a great, clinging tan head. Aroma is sweet, with nice fruity scents, a touch of oaken vanilla, and caramelized sugars. Flavor is complex, with cherry fruit, vanilla, caramel, a touch of dark chocolate, and figs. A slight bitterness shows through, then more sweet malt and fruit flavors come through. Mouthfeel is very smooth and creamy, with pretty much perfect carbonation. Drinkability is superb. This is definitely a great experience. The Pater is good, but this is twice as nice."
"I'll certainly have to try it again, and as good as it was, it was not quite as good as I was expecting."
"This dubbel is thick and syrupy, lingering on the tongue for a bit. The best by date on the bottle is 040810. If only I had the patience to wait that long before trying the next one."
"11.2 oz. bottle. Pours a slightly hazy ruddy orange-brown color. Produces a beautiful huge, fluffy and rocky tan head which maintains a 1/4"" thickness throughout the glass. Quite intense and pleasant aromas of fresh baked wheat rolls, yeast, ripe pears/apples, caramel candies, toffee along with faint hints of buckwheat honey, spices, charred oak and alcohol. Palate is full and round combining a nice spritzy carbonation with an enjoyable chewy texture. Flavor profile seems a bit more reserved compared to the aroma, but still quite good. Notes of sweet Belgian crystal malts, light brown sugar, caramel, toffee, spices, fresh dark wheat bread and ripe light fruits are savored. Finish shows just a quick hit of hops and alcohol, but unfortunately tends to fade out fast leaning toward some thiness in the end. All in all a well done Belgain Dubble and would certainly visit this again."
"Pours a cloudy brown with an orange hue in the light. Churning carbionation,frothy head,with excellent retention and lacing. Smell is sweet and bready. Dark sweet fruit, and nut are also there. Body is on the thick side,and carbionated. Taste is of brown sugar,and fruit. With a nice slightly bitter finish. A lot going on with this excellent beer!"
"Cheers!"
"Poured from a corked and caged 750 mL bottle into my Ommegang chalice. The first thing I notice is the awesome head. Very light and fluffy, sticking to the sides, it doesn't erupt over the sides of the glass but it doesn't settle quickly either. Perfect. The color is a little lighter than I had expected, most other dubbels I've had were very dark brown. You can actually see the carbonation in this stuff. The aroma is VERY bready, I'm a little worried the taste will be the same. Nope, the taste is awesome. Very sweet like brown sugar with a perfect balance of bitterness. Slight alcohol taste that is smooth and rich. Very silky mouthfeel. This is better than I had expected. Minus the bready smell this is one of the best dubbels I've ever had."
"Fresh pastry dough with a dash of yeast. Faint currant flavor with hints of glazed donut.This is like a glass of your favorite local donut shop at three in the morning when they are cranking out the next day's pastries. I recommend that you drink it at three in the morning, or at least before bedtime. I can really get into these flavors, and I'm generally over dark strong bottled conditioned Belgian beers. Good job. Solid."
"My first of this beer, and I must admit I'm impressed. Much smoother and warmly maltier than I was anticipating. A great beer."
"I thought the hearty ale would be perfect to be snowed in with, but I would need a case to keep me happy as this was very easy to drink (with a refined taste). As I always speculate upon finding a great beer or ale, I will want to find this on tap sometime soon."
"drinkability: high"
"Poured from the 330ml bottle into a St. Bernardus goblet. Body is an orange/brown hue with deep golden highlights, topped by a small, creamy tan head that doesn't last very long. Nice, sweet aroma that's spot on for a Dubbel - sweet malt, caramel, and some tangy Belgian yeast. Palate is superb as well, with a good balance between the sweet, bready malt flavors and the mellow, fruity hops. Just a touch of astringency is detectable on the finish. Body is creamy but overly foamy. On the whole, though, a very enjoyable offering from one of the greatest breweries in the world."
"I very much enjoyed this beer and can't wait to try some more."
"Drinkability easily reaches 5.0, as this is a true pleaser."
"Prior 8 pours a deep ruby red with a thick and tall off white head that lingers for quite a while. Smell is herbal and sweet, with a slight sour tang. Taste is rich and slightly fruity. Sweet malts upfront, with a dry chalky yeast flavor towards the end. There is a slight raisiny aftertaste, with a lingering sweetness. The alcohol is completely masked. Although between the two I like the 12 better, this is a delicious beer, well worth the $8 a 750."
"The color is a nice deep mahogany and there is a good sized head. The smell contains raisens, and could almost be mistaken for a wine. The abv is not too evident in the taste. A nice dull bitterness in the taste and there are lots of fruit tastes as well. The mouthfeel is smooth. Not overly carbonated. A nice sipper. After a couple of less than stellar Belgians, it is nice to run across one that is very good. This beer gives me hope in getting accustomed to these Belgian brews."
"Poured into a tulip a nice slightly cloudy dark mahongy color, nice carbonation, nice two finger foamy off-white head, one big island and some smaller ones are left behind. The nose is of malts, yeast, grapes, figs, raisins, dates, and slight caramel. The taste is absolutely delicious, nice malty/yeasty/grapey flavor. Slightly dry finish. Medium body, a very complex brew. Very drinkable, a true to style brew, highly recommended."
"It's very drinkable, although despite all the brilliant traits of this fine brew, it does feel a little over-carbonated for my liking."
"St. Bernardus Prior 8 pours a dark brown color with an off white head from a brown 11.2 ounce bottle. The aroma is dark fruit all the way and it's very appealing. The flavor starts with dark fruit, but there is some hop bitterness toward the end. A very tasty beer. Highly recommended."
"D - Drinkable and pleasant. This is the first St Bernardus I can recall actually enjoying. It isn't fantastic, but it is good. If I am ever to repeat a St Bernardus, it will most certainly be the 8."
"Slainte!"
"Mouthfeel is light and airy with fine carbonation, very drinkable!"
"Served in a St. Bernardus chalice, the beer pours a dark amber/brown color, with a small off-white head. It smells like dark fruit and molasses. It tastes very sweet, just like it smells but with some warming alcohol in there. Mouthfeel is medium/full, a bit slick with a lot of carbonation, but not too much. Drinkability is very good, it's smooth and crisp. Overall I think this is a pretty good beer, I'd definitely drink it again."
"Pours a dark nut brown with very little head and little lacing. The smell could be a little more robust, but it has a nice winey aroma with a lot of rounded malt. The taste is classic Belgian. Dark and spicy with that tang od Belgian yeast and the sweetness and thickness coming from the malt. Bananas and cloves, and brown bread with some hops throughout. Very nice. Mouthfeel is very balanced - not too thick, not overcarbonated, just a nice medium body with some spritz and flavors to go around. Quite drinkable- no real sign of the 8% abv, and very refreshing with some interest in the flavors."
"33cL bottle from A-1 To-Go in Gardiner. Dark brown body with less than a quarter inch of off-white head and feint ruby-red highlights. Smells peaty and kind of nutty. Aroma is not that prominent. Roasty chocolate and date notes dominate the flavor with hints of nut. On the upper side of medium bodied with a fair bit of carbonation. Very drinkable despite the thickness of it. Fantastic. Better than all I've tried from them except Abt."
"This beverage is a rather fine Dubbel. It pours from the bottle a nice dark color, with a minimal head, which sadly does not last. The smell is of sweet malts contained within. The taste is sweet, as was the smell. The mouthfeel is smooth. A tasty treat worty of searching out. Enjoy!"
"Taste is of vanilla, nuts, malt, with a slight hoppiness to it. The fruit is not as noticable as the smell would suggest, yet citrus and apricot pull through as it warms. Very little aftertaste to an exceedingly smooth brew with a slight hint of carbonation (just right!). Very enjoyable at the end of a long day, good drinkability."
"The carbonation on this even though not immediately apparent comes out in the flavor making for a slightly more crisp beer. The acidity is really nice I can totally imagine eating cheese and crackers with this. I think it would be a great way to start a dinner with. I will definitely buy this again especially for my next dinner party. Again this is not an over the top beer I appreciate it for what it is, not a punch in the face, but a subtle beer you can eat and hang with not that I don't love their tripel and quad, but those should be used for very different reasons. I love you saint bernardus."
"Drinkability: Good, but not exceptional."
"In a word: underwhelming. Although a good beer, I found nothing to brag about. It looks like a nice monk brew, brown with generous head. Smell didn't do much for me. Some fruit and caramel, but it was faint. Similarly with tastes, there were some nice subtle complexities, but nothing grand and tasty. It was a mix of tart, sour berries, with bitter candy. I had a hard time tasting much because the beer was over carbonated. Really took a while for that to settle down. Still a very smooth drink, but not one I'd drop good money on any time soon. I'll stick to the Abt 12."
"A nice ale, though a bit more bland than some of its other family members."
"This beer is a one-trick pony. It offers one taste, which is hard to put my finger on. Raisin? Carob? Molasses? I'm not sure, but it's a little too ""rustic"" for my taste. I'll try this again in a few months - perhaps I had a bad bottle."
"It just may be that few other beers so typically fit into the dubbel style with such a strong pedigree. And the pedigree is well earned. While the ABV is healthy, it's also a nicely incorporated warming component, and it drinks so very nicely. So this is on more impressive offering from the pride of Watou province."
"A very nice Abbey Ale."
"I like this one, I really do. Wonderfully complicated and tasty. A tip 'o the hat to the monks."
"11.2 oz. slender Belgian bottle, served in a small snifter. It pours a hazed deep copper with some yeast floaties and it's topped with an inch of light brown head that laces nicely, but I keep swirling it away. The aroma is quite nice, with dark, rich malts/grains, molasses, banana, cidery apple, raspberry, and hints of strawberry and kiwi. Not quite as fruity on the palate, with rich grains taking their place, contributing molasses and maybe some carob. Yeast, apple, and banana are also in the mix, on top of a medium to thick body that has ample carbonation. Overall a good, tasty dubbel from a brewery I'm only starting to get to know, but would like to know better."
"-Oelergud"
"Drinkability - I find this to be good, but not great. I will have this on occaision. High abv also supresses sessionability."
"750 bottle. Pours a thick, dark rust color with big large-bubble head that lasted until the last sip. Amazingly complex but subtle aromas of raisins, orange and almonds. Palate was complex with high maltiness but low overall sweetness. Sourness was milder than many abby ales. High yeast content but it stayed in the bottom well and I could pour all but about an ounce. No hint of the alcohol flavor (until I tried to stand up...). Left me wanting another."
"Wonderful beer. Served in a goblet, it was a dark brown with a thick, sticky head. It had a caramel, dark fruit, and roasted grain aroma. It tasted as it smelled, nice caramel flavor, a little fruity, some hops. Smooth, good mouthfeel. 8% ABV means I could drink more than one at a time."
"Mouthfeel is good and for 8%, this is very drinkable. A very good brew."
"Drinkability is marginal here because of the slightly higher ABV."
"Creamy mouthfeel, but it becomes a little sticky towards the end of the glass."
"Tastes great. A defintie candyness; the orange and chocolate are still here, along with caramel and toffee. Malty with a slight hop to it but very well rounded. Not very much alcohol taste at all, pleasant and drinkable. Good body. A solid Dubbel."
"This beer poured a cloudy dark brown color. The smell was a bit nutty and slightly sweet. The taste was bitter with coffee and caramel tones. The mouthfeel is full and chewy. The carbonation is perfect to balance out the mouthfeel. I like this beer a lot and consider it a highly drinkable beer."
"The pour from a 75 cL bottle into my Westy chalice (close enough, right?) raises a quick-falling one finger tan head with thick sudsy lacing. The body is a deep, translucent ruby-copper. I like the lacing, but the head is lacking. The nose is very rich and fruity, with a lot of cocoa depth. The taste is very mellow and bready, with light cocoa notes and slight rich dark fruitiness. The mouth is over medium, with nice active carbonation. This is a very drinkable ale that I will be revisiting."
"This beer pours a dark brown mahogony with a giamy foamy head. Carbonation is crazy in this beer. The smell has alcohol, roasted malt,nuts, and dark fruit. The taste,like the smell, has nuts,roasted malt, and dark fruit. A good flavor,but I was a little disapointed that this is nothing really special. The m/f is light with the flavors mixing well ,except that the aftertaste is abit watery. Not a bad beer and you can't really taste the alcohol,but I was a little disapointed because I expected more from this brewery."
"As a side note, I have tried this beer both on-tap and in a bottle and the bottled version seems to exhibit much richer and smoother flavors, as well as a reduced hop and alcohol profile."
"Drinkability--for a stronger beer, it goes down pretty easy."
"D: It's a bit on the strong side for a Dubbel, but it's very rich, smooth, and tasty. A nice sipping beer, currently being enjoyed during a chilly rainstorm."
"This beer is a rustic, rusty-brown color with an absolutely enormous head. Its a little hazy and murky, and produces a fantastic lace. The aroma is classic Belgianearthy and doughy, with a lot of aromatic malt. Theres some sugar and candy-like sweet smells, along with yeast and peppery spice, dark fruit, and caramel. Yummy. The taste is slightly sweet, with a little alcohol and yeast. Theres a slight tangy-tart quality that appears in the midtaste, and the finish has a nice balancing dry bitterness. Moderate-to-full bodied. This is a fantastic brew, and a benchmark for the style."
"All in all a great ale. Probably in my top 3 or 4 for a darker Belgian and probably my favorite dubble. Easy to drink but with enough flavor that you slow down and savour it without having to tell yourself to."
"8 % ABV is a strong brew, but the feel and taste is enough to make you forget that."
"I don't know how many of these I could drink due to the richness but I'd be willing to try a few."
"D: 8% is tough, but the beer is top notch."
"Drinkability - a fine Belgian, tasty and delicious."
"D: A very good beer, but at $3.29 per 11.2, this isn't one that I'll find myself drinking regularly."
"I felt somewhat guilty to take the single bottle from my friend's fridge... This certainly is one of those gems that you come across once in awhile. Lovely dark brown color, full head slowly receding and a taste that I hadn't experienced before. Definitely one of the best dubbels I've tried!"
"slightly murky amber color, slight spicy, with some nutmeg, crisp and clean nose, light earthy with good malty taste , with a sharp bubbly refreshing body, aftertaste bitter and sweet very nice slightly murky amber color, slight spicy, with some nutmeg, crisp and clean nose, light earthy with good malty taste , with a sharp bubbly refreshing body, aftertaste bitter and sweet very nice"
"The pour was dark brown, with hints of orange and some suspended particles. Good thick tan head that lingered throughout, and excellent lacing. Aroma was strongly dark fruit...grapes, plums, figs, and the flavor was more of this, along with the malty sweetness early on. As beer warmed at mid-glass, alcohol became more evident in both the flavor and the aroma. THis is a very tasty beer, and pretty much what I expected. Not the best for a hot summer night (like tonite) , but there is no mistaking the good aroma flavor and overall quality of this beer."
"The taste is also earthy. The yeast adds a slight sourness that combines with the earthy base. Mouthfeel I would place on medium of the entire spectrum from light lager to stout- it falls in between."
"Overall: You must have this beer!"
"Extremely drinkable, extremely tasty. An excellent Watou ale in the shade of its older brother, the abbot."
"This is another winner from Watou. Highly reccomended."
"Drinkability is very nice. it's a strong beer, but not a knockout. The flavors blend really well together. I'm thinking of a ton of food pairings that would work, from sweet deserts to spicey chilis and I think all would work well. But it's also got enough heft to be a sipper by itself. This is the star of the St. Bernardus line i.m.o."
"""Dubbel Light"" is the best description of this beer. It doesn't do much for me. It looks and smells nice but has a very one dimensional taste. Too dry and it has minimal residual sugars, like Shiraz that is steeped in tobacco. I'm not inclined to buy it again."
"Quite drinkable for an 8% brew, although its thickness and carbonation hold it back somewhat. Still for pure drinking pleasure, this one is fantastic.... much closer to the Abt 12 calibre than the Pater 6."
"Sampled with the Witbier while watching the MLB All Star game tonight. I poured this beer into my Duvel tulip glass. The beer poured a deep brown color, medium tan head and strong lacing. The nose has some fine tones of brown sugar and raisins, maybe plums. The taste starts off with a toasted malty kick and a bit bready. There is no real notice of the abv while tasting which is nice but it eventually shows up. Medium body and very drinkable."
"Pours a muddy brownish purple with a large frothy head that recedes slowly. Pleasant, sweet cherry cola like aroma with a dusting of plums and raisins. Dark fruits and doughy funnel cake, or whatever greasy fried confection you prefer (sans the powdered sugar) embody the flavor; the dark fruits provide a subtle tartness, balanced by bittersweet toffee/dark chocolate. Alcohol is not noticeable in the flavor, though my head has found it. Carbonation nips the tip of the tongue but is in no way overdone or what I would consider overly or highly carbonated; rather, it's quite smooth. Another stellar brew from this master Belgian brewer."
"Poured a warm tone of amber. Head was smallish with furious carbonation. I smelled the nose even before I finished pouring. The dominant tone was almonds and raisins. I also get sweet brown sugar. The smell is so damned rich I don't know what to compare it to other than a freshly baked home made pie. The taste is the same as the nose plus an added pleasant tartness. This is somewhat highly carbonated, making for a dry finish. This is a great beer, one that would certainly please me when I thirst for a dubbel."
"Drinkability: ridiculously drinkable, despite the alcohol and the coppery/metallic finish to the malts. Balanced and smooth, this beer would be a great session beer or one to sit on for a while."
"Highly recommend."
"I might have to give this another try, but based on this introductory bottle, this beer is easily consumed but doesn't taste all that special. I had higher hopes considering how fantastic the 12 is. Still looking forward to the Trippel."
"A highly enjoyable brew and certainly ranks right up with the best Dubbel's I've had."
"My first experience with this style and particualr beer was very good. Aroma was nutty, yet clean. Taste was of walnuts and slightly buttery. Very drinkable for a 8% beer. I can normally taste the alcolhol of any beer over 6%, but Prior 8 was different. Great head and head retention. Great lace on the glass. Overall, very enjoyable and I will definitely have more in the future."
"Well, compared to the 'drink 'til you are dead' nectar that is the Abt 12, this is utterly forgettable. Next time i'll be sure to purchase this in the 750mL package to see if this was just a case of poor-handling or excessive age."
"A major improvement over it's little brother, Pater 6"
"This beer has a good reputation and really lives up to it!"
"This is a fine Dubbel, and what Chimay Red should aspire to. Looks great, smells great, goes down smooth. I have to admit that Dubbels aren't my favorite style by a long shot, but I enjoyed the Prior 8."
"This beer is very drinkable at 8%abv, alcohol is in great balance with the beers flavors."
"Overall, it is rather similar to the Pater 6. I liked that one better though."
"Although dubbels are hardly one of my 'go-to' styles, quality beer such as this shows just who the others are chasing. Excellent!"
"It's hard to put into words the overall beauty of something so phenomenal, but I guess the numbers will have to speak for themselves for now. Excellent, excellent beer, I can't recommend this one highly enough aged as this one was."
"This is an interesting brew. Very malty, slight lacing, nice fruity smell. Lots of apricots and plums. Again, extremely interesting. A little overpriced. Almost more of a belgian strong dark ale than a dubbel. For me a little too strong for a dubbel, but still, a tremendous brew. Nice pillowy head, little carbonation, and the head dissapates quickly. Hey if you cam find a single, go for it!"
"D - Tasty and drinkable enough. Just feel that there is something missing when comparing it to others in the style."
"just what I look for in a dubbel, hard to beat."
"Probably my favourite of the St. Bernardus beers I've tried (including the Abt 12)."
"pours out a cloudy deep amber with a fatto bo batty head. leaves some nice lacing. smells sweet with some doses of alcohol hovering right about the rim. taste wise? niiice. malty, oh so malt. doughy/bread like malt, dark fruits and some brown sugar. crisp, lovely carbonation, champagne like. deadly in its drinkability, this stuff is the real deal."
"Pours a two finger, thick cream head that barely fades leaving a good lace. Cloudy amber color. Medium carbonation and medium bodied. Cherry nose. Starts sweet, raisiny, sweet bready finish, not cloying. $9.60 for a 750ml bottle from Colonial Spirits Acton, Ma."
"D - this is a very good dubbel. With some warmth it could be better."
"This is a great dubbel and very enjoyable."
"Overall, this is a great beer. As good or better than the Trappists."
"Very balanced and drinkable. St. Bernardus wins again!"
"The strong aroma and dark color leads one to expect a full-bodied, malty sweet meal in a glass. But this beer is instead very dry and subdued on the palate--too subdued for my taste. Still, a very clean and balanced beer that, in true Belgian style, is extremely drinkable despite its powerful punch."
"Awesome looking brew. Medium brown color, with copper and amber highlights. Sweet looking cream colored head, about two fingers deep on the intial pour. Very clumpy. About one finger on refil pours. Fantastic head retention, that leaves some brilliant, very delicate looking lacing. Not as aromatic, as I expected. Mostly a bready, yeasty, with hints of fruits and alcohol. Fruity tastes up front, maybe green apples, malts, and spices. More flavors show themselves as the beer warms. Smooth, creamy mouthfeel. I mean very smooth, leaves you wanting more. Even with a 8% abv, this is so easy too drink and an absolute pleasure. My second offering from St. Bernadus and a definite winner!!!"
"Pours dark, reddish. thick head. fruity odors, almost like strawberries. whoo! very strong. lots of fruity, peaty flavor. alcohol is very evident, which makes me think we should have held onto the bottle a bit longer (i had this problem with the Abt 12 too). A bit too harsh for me in its current state. nice full mouthfeel. good, but too much would knock me flat."
"D---as with the other St. Bernardus offerings, this one is a sipper, an excellent nightcap, which is how I am enjoying this one. It really warms the body as I sip it. One is plenty, but the one is very drinkable."
"Drinkability is damn good, I can't stop sipping it!"
"Another winner from St. Bernardus! Can't wait to hit up that ""6" in the fridge."
"I noticed recently that my ratings on Belgians have gone steadily downward in the past couple of months - Some have been amazing, others have been a little disappointing. This one's unique in the way it presents itself to the senses."
"Much darker and deep than the 6 version. this has a metallic twinge that is annoying but overall the dark fruity brew comes across sweet and tasty. I loved this offering but I just couldn't score it outstanding, considering the sweet , syrupy finish, it just ended up a bit short of perfection...thats not a bad thing at all."
"I am glad to have this, but will wait for a great conditioned one next time"
"Drinkability: The high ABV and sticky texture make this less than exceptionally drinkable, but it certainly holds my interest!"
"Moderately sweet, yeasty, bread aroma. SOme fruit, as well. Appearance was perfect. Poured a nice, creamy head with excellent lacing. No yeast particles. Initial and finish flavor were moderately sweet. It has a decent wheat flovor component. Overall, another great beer from St Bernardus."
"Had this one on tap at Cicero's in the Loop in St. Louis ... my favorite St. louis beer stop. Presented as a murky brown color with lively tan head and serious lacing. Nose is of sweet malt, yeast, and over-ripe fruit. Slightly spicy as well. Taste is very malty upfront, with yeast and spices following closely. Medium to full bodied, and not heavily carbonated. This is a good dubbel from St. Bernardus, makers of one of my very favorite ales in the world, Abt 12. Easily drinkable and good, solid flavor. Give it a try ..."
"One of the great dubbels, maybe only behind Westy 8. Being that I can't get Westy these days, St. Bernardus and Westmalle are my best options. 750ml; deep amber color, large foamy head with good retention. Paired with beef, great match. Not as sweet as many other dubbels tend to be. Terrific balance, top notch all the way!"
"D - Very enjoyable and easy to drink. Not as spicy as some dubbels that I have had."
"Poured a murky , dark , reddish-brown , with a large foamy head that never left. Lots of carbonation rising. Left a creamy lacing. Nose is very sweet-creamy , with fruit and some alcohol. Taste is also fairly sweet,rich, and malty. As it warmed , more fruity flavors(pear etc.) arose. Also a bit of a medicinal taste and spice in the finish with just a slight bit of hops. Full and nicely carbonated mouthfeel. This is indeed a very tasty and rich Dubbel and i enjoyed it."
"Thick enough in the body and plenty enjoyable."
"Despite the very present alcohol in smell & taste, this goes down smooth enough. Having two or three in a row would never be out of the question. Because of the high presence of alcohol, it has a warming sensation as it goes down, making for great winter sipping."
"I'd love to have more! Supposedly a local store will be stocking St. Bernardus soon."
"This beer looks initially dirty brown and boring, but when held to the light, some beautiful apricot and raspberry colors shine through. The head poured exceptionally tall and is a yellowish white and very frothy that left some clumpy lace. Smells like home made root beer, apple cider, some ginger and spicy Belgian yeast. Tastes of home made root beer as well with some green grass, plumb and over ripe apple. Finishes with a dry spicy character that materializes out of the original flavor. The mouth feel is light to medium bodied and clean with a medium carbonation."
"Just awesome, a complex and delicious brew. Right on for this nectar."
"My God in heaven, my luck with beer over the last two days has been amazing. This brew poured out to a dark brown color with a great 1/2 inch head of tan foam. Medium high level of carbonation. Aromas of yeast, cashews, bread, plumbs and mature malt fills the nose. Flavors of roasted nuts, heavy and full malts, a marked brown sugar element and yeasty bread notes keep the palate occupied and happy. Mouthfeel is smooth and almost creamy, with a tamed level of carbonation keeping the flavors vibrant. Great drinkability. This is another amazing, world class beer. Highly Recommended."
"Drinkability: this is a fabulous brew. worthy of praise and an absolute pleasure to drink."
"A uniquely flavored Belgian beer, brewed the St. Bernardus way. From the bottle, aromas of Belgian candy sugars and spices jump out. Rich, well aged malts blend into the sweetness for genuine complexity even to the nose. Alcohols swirl into the aroma and flavor. Looks rich and sweet. Clings to the glass to promise richness. Dehydrated fruits are distinguished and flavored with mild spiciness. Alcohols edge into a fusal flavor that dominated the flavor midway through. Sweet and full on the palate, leaving a dry and alcoholic sweetness. A goood dubbel, but the alcohols dominate too much."
"D = Good. But I'd rather drink St Bernardus abt 12."
"Pours deep ruby brown with big creamy and pillowy tan head and thick lace. Strong carbonation with some haze caused by yeast in the pour. Big citrus and dark fruits on sweet grains, moderate hops, and sugary alcohol in the nose. Prickly up front, developing a chewy grainy middle. Builds a very satisfying powdered chocolate and sour cherry dryness in the finish. Rounded and slightly sticky medium-heavy body with big carbonation. The flavors are a bit weak at first, but the finish is excellent and leaves you wanting more."
"Opinion: I seriously think that this is my favorite Dubbel...period. There are some others that have more facets to the flavor, but this beer just plain delivers. It is clean and refreshing with a reserved fruitiness and balanced well enough that you can put away half the bottle before you realize it after standing up. I am so impressed with this beer, that it makes me shy away from making Dubbels because I don't know how I could come close to this. It is a great beer, and one I highly recommend (in case you hadn't noticed)."
"Pours with a great one inch foam cap. Very dark brown, I tried to leave the yeast/sediment behind but this thing is loaded with it as plenty of particles can be seen floating around. The head dissipates only slowly as the foam clings to the sides of glass. Aromas of rasins, spices, sweet malt and a bit of cinnamon are present. It smells almost like a fresh cinnamon roll. The taste seems a bit lackluster after expecting such good things from the aroma. It's only subtly sweet, although I detect notes of raisins, coffee and a hint of chocolate. Not real bitter. It has a rich and foamy mouthfeel, semi-thick and very smooth. Overall I prefer the St. Bernardus Pater 6 over this one. This brew smelled wonderful to begin with, and the flavors were there, but they just didn't come out with enough strength and complexity."
"Overall a hell-yeah beer that I would be happy to have very often. The price is a bit high, but not out of reason for a beer of this caliber. The best dubbel that we can get without pissing off monks."
"Nice, clean and crisp mouthfeel. Carbonation is a plus in this one. Medium bodied and extremely drinkable."
"Pours a cloudy mahogony brown with a huge creamy head, great longevity and equally great lace. Aromas of rich malt with candy, brown sugar, fruit and vanilla. The best word for the falvor of this is luscious. Rich and creamy malt mixed with brown sugar, vanilla, raisin, plum followed by a roasted bitterness. Nicely balanced as Dubbels go. Highly drinkable. One of the better beers I have had. A bit costly, but very nice."
"Pours a medium brown color with loads of foam that just sits there and leaves intricate lacing behind in my goblet. Aromas of plums, raisins, alcohol, and dark berries seem to come out. The taste closely resembles the aromas with the addition of an astringent flavor in the finish that draws out the fruity sweetness and imparts a rough and rather powerful aftertaste. The texture in my mouth starts off rich, but turns into a slightly bready and stickly texture. The drinkability takes a hit because of the texture and the finish, but otherwise an enjoyable beer."
"A hard pour into the St. Bernardus chalice gave me a picture perfect head. Lovely dark brown liquid with a nice tan head that never really went away and gave lacing all the way down the glass. Smell of a little alcohol but is covered in fruity esters and lovely sweet malt. The taste is chock full of flavor every taste is a whole world of flavor and the complexity is lovely. Absolutley great body nice and fluffy full of carbonation that gives the sensation of melting in your mouth. Very drinkable and a endless supply would be great."
"This beer came caged and corked in a wonderfully decorated bottle. I know this beer is made for sipping...it wasn't sipped!"
"Overall- another solid beer from St. Bernardus."
"Beer is good. Happy dubbel beering."
"nice clean finish for excellent drinkability. 8% isn't noticeable."
"Yet another wonderful concoction from the happy friar. Kind of dark burnt brown color, a hint of red. Not much head, but good lace. Smells divine, caramel, sugar, cinnamon/nutmeg. Clean bubble, sharp. Alcohol noticeable, but accompanies, doesn't overwhelm. Taste is like a cold glass of eggnog - thick, sticky, spicy. Good sweet malt. Maybe a touch too sweet."
"33cl bottle: This one pours a very hazy mahogany color. There was a good bit of a tan head that dropped away rather quickly. Definite dark fruits to the nose. Also some breadiness, yeastiness and some caramel/toffee notes. The taste is quite good, I get the caramel, raisins, breadiness, as well as a plethora of other things mixed together in there. A slightly spicy aftertaste, as well as a full body. Quite nice."
"Decent, competent beer. Nice finish."
"Highly drinkable. Its stature as a beer should be savored, but man, I could do some damage with a number of these."
"Drinkability: Another great brew by St. Bernardus. This is Pater 6's fruitier, maltier, less spicy big brother. Same level of quality."
"This is another offering worthy of its praise. So complex and enjoyable. Nice rich body and so many flavors, this is a sipper for sure but the alcohol does not detract whatsoever. Highly recommended."
"Pours a hazy brown with a decent sized tan head. Pleasant aroma, very bready. Flavor is tasty; very malty, with a very faint raisiny flavor, and the slightest bit of bitterness. Quite drinkable; goes down fairly easy with little evidence of alcohol. Not my favorite offering from St. Bernardus, but a great example of the style."
"Pours a murky brown/orange, big tan head forms and sticks all over the glass. Smell is chocolate and coffee, rich roast, fruit (cherries especially), some yeast and a little alcohol. Taste is chocolate roast, iron, some yeast, cherries, a rich maltiness and some spice. Tiny bit of alcohol as well. Mouthfeel is very smooth, highly carbonated but perfect, medium to high body. Spectacular."
"Alcohol comes through in the smell but not the taste. What the taste does reveal is plenty of malt and esters. The mouthfeel is a bit sharp for the style, while drinkability is good."
"An above average Dubbel, though a little less tastey than the Pater I just tried. Its not as fruity, and a little heavier in body. Still better than most Dubbels."
"D: Quite drinkable."
"I've recently re-discovered these beers. I've always appreciated this brewery, but my interests changed a bit and I wasn't into Belgians as much. Had a St. Bernardus triple the other night which made me remember how good these beers really are... So I'm trying the whole line again. Let's see how the Prior 8 stacks up. Dark brown, cloudy (I poured in the sediment), and as usual for St. Bernardus, the head on this beer is outrageous, and indestructable. Another quality found in all beers by this brewery is the amazing cup-cake like smell and taste... so subtle, so fruity. Nice and malty as well, with a slick raisiny feel. A nice spicy hop background balances. A little kick of alcohol in the finish, but gentle. The mouthfeel is a pillow. So good. Don't know how they do it... Cheers, to the merry monks of Belgium."
"Pours a rusty dark amber with a tall beige head and big floaty chunks of yeast. Smell is a spicy, yet muted apple cider with clove and nutmeg. Taste is a drier, more subtle version of its big brother, Abt. 12. Less sweet, more tartness and clove. Mouthfeel is champagne crisp with fine, tickling bubbles. This is an extremely drinkable dubbel, especially at 8%. I'd have to give the edge to Big Bro on this one though, it's just a richer experience."
"Muddy reddish brown colour with a tan head. There was generous foam off the pour that receded to a thin, but solid, layer of small bubbles sitting on top of the beer. A thick layer of very fine foam also remained behind on the sides of the glass. Bready and yeasty, like the others in the St. Bernardus line, and that's a good thing. There's also a bit of spice and a vinous fruit character. Mild flavour with a bit of alcohol warmth in the throat. Spicy with a rich doughy, bready malt character. Chocolatey finish as it warms. Slightly slick. Ripe fruit is balanced in there as well as a bit of raisin. Alcohol becomes a little more forward as it warms, becoming a bit of a distraction. Carbonation really contributed to the texture, providing some meat to the lightish body. Another great beer from St. Bernardus."
"Mouthfeel: Moderate warmth from th alcohol, medium body."
"Medium to dark amber color, with a light tan head. Immediately the head began to diminish, giving way to very delicate lacing. The aroma was of yeasts and dark fruits. The first thing I could taste was dark malt and yeasts, which gave way to more subtle fruits. Although the taste was complex, it was more bitter than I like at first. The bitterness diminished as the beer came to temperature, but finished with a clean, smooth dry taste. Very decent Dubbel overall."
"Drinkability -- One of two will probably be enough for me. This is a nice one for a cold fall evening. It has a nice warming effect."
"Notes: This beer perfectly compliments a nice cheese and fruit spread."
"Overall - A excellent dubbel, although i thought there was something missing from this. The bottle i had could probably have done with ageing for a couple of years.... Certainly recommended though...."
"Drinkability: I am hoping that this is a prelude to the Abt 12, which is currently waiting in my ""cellar""."
"Notes: Excellent, I can't wait to try the 12 that I have sitting in the cellar."
"A very well crafted beer. The 8% ABV is hidden well. One I will definately keep on hand for special moments, or just when I want a kick ass dubble."
"Velvety and full in the mouth, a pleasure to let it roll around. Perfect to savor with every sip. Oh dear, I'm tempted to drink all four."
"Drinkability: Since this is 8% and it has less sugar than a tripel, it's quite a possible to have a few of these at a sitting, though if so they should surely be sipped slowly (say that 5 times fast)."
"Pours a murky dark brown with some ruby color when held to the light, and a nice creamy tan head that sticks to the glass like nobody's business. Aroma is initially very fruity with cherry, plum, date and raisin notes followed by a some candied sugar sweetness and some spices (clove and corriander) and light phenols. The taste begins with some fresh fruit flavors of cherry, plum and raisin, then some light cocoa notes, candied sugar, light spiciness (mainly clove) , light floral and grassy hops flavor and a slightly phenolic and lightly sweet finish with some light alcohol notes. Mouthfeel is full and rich with a medium to big body and light carbonation. An excellent dubbel, my favorite by far...less phenolic and spicy than most with a nice, complex fruit character that matches the light sweetness perfectly."
"Another great brew from St. Bernardus, my favorite Belgian monk! Not as complex as Abt 12, but delicious nonetheless. If you have the means, I highly recommend procuring a bottle at your soonest convenience."
"Drinkability: Due to the price and alcohol content, this is a beer that's only good once in a while. An excellent beer for my first Dubbel. This is a beer that would age very well in the right climate temp."
"I prefer the Abt. 12, but I'd get this again. A solid Dubbel."
"This brew pours a dark brown color with a dinosuaric white head. The aroma is fantastic. Dark fruits, spices, cloves. The first thing noticable about the taste is how refreshing it is. After that it is sweet, fruity, slitghly nutty. The mouthfeel is meduim-full bodied with tons of carbonation. Overalll, this is a very, very good brew."
"Pured with a frothy off white head. Brown, but has some ruby and purpleish hues when held to light. I get very little from the aroma. Maybe some chocolate, raisin, mostly malt.Fairly heavy on the palate. Light carbanation. No real sign of the 8% alcohol until you swallow, and the just a hint. Id say Id go buy another couple of bottles and put the in the cellar, but I dont think that is what this beer needed. Actually, this beer is probably exactly as intended, just not wowing me"
"Drinkability is excellent. I expected more in the flavor department but this is a mild mannered easy drinker."
"Drinkability: Just wonderful. One to be sipped and appreciated. I have a feeling if I hurry this one the alcohol will hit my like a velvet hammer. BTW...the head retention on this is amazing. I'll definitely have to try more examples of this style. Strongly recommended."
"Drinkability- For a dubbel this is a damn good one. A tad more sweetness would have put this one over the top. St. B never lets you down though."
"Pours with an aggressive head into a tulip glass. Body is an amber tinged brown which supports a healthy 3 fingers of off-white creamy froth. Aroma is full of dark fruits much like it's stronger brother but yeast isn't quite as strong smelling as the 12. Taste is very rich, layers of plums and raisins lead to a sweet sugary finish. This beer is not hot but definitely leaves a warmer finish than other brews of the same strength. Mouthfeel is very creamy and drinkability superb. Another stellar beer from St. Bernardus."
"St. B is the shit! It's amazing they can get all of those flavors from just malt, hops, water, yeast, and maybe a bit of sugar. The quad, the tripel, and even the dubbel are kick ass. Bow down to this bad MF. Did I mention St. B is the shit?"
"This is the kinds of dubbel I enjoy."
"Really nice dark brown color and very thick head. Very nice looking beer. Really nutty flavor, it starts strongly then gives way to a delicate hop bitterness and woody undertones. This is one of the best birthday presents I've ever recieved! Thanks Joe."
"Overall, it was enjoyable, and it was a good way to celebrate getting a new job."
"Poured into my St. B goblet a dark brown with translucent edges. Tan foam dissipated rather quickly, some stickiness. Smell is pretty tame too. Some malty notes, slight spice, and faint banana? Maybe? Taste picks up for it though...a champagne-like bubbly combination of candi-ed fruit, allspice, and cola nut. Not nearly as complex as other examples of the style. Mouthfeel is a tad thin, especially in the roof of the mouth. Oh so easy to drink. Nothing is particularly fantastic about the brew, but it is a nice plain dubbel that should not go untasted."
"-UF"
"Poured into a Rapscallion glass, formed a 1 1/2"" beige head over the translucent, effervescent burgundy brew. Dense, frothy head ain't going nowhere, and lacing is chunky and prevalent. Aroma is sweet yet spicy, and makes me anticipate the taste, and what more can we really ask for? Taste is sweet at the start, with spices tingling the tastebuds here and there, and this flavor combination fades slowly upon swallowing. Mouthfeel and drinkability are both very nice, going down smooth and creamy, and leaving you anticipating the next mouthful. Very nice offering here."
"Mouthfeel is bubbly and chewy, a nice full body. Very tasty, and slightly filling. Could see it being too heavy after a while, but this is one classy beer."
"Which is good."
"750 ml corked (champagne style) brown silk print bottle, bought in Denmark. Brown colour with a slight haziness, pours with a large fluffy off-white head. Very nice aroma of oak, leather, yeast, brown sugar, dried fruits and spices, hints of barnyard. Flavour has plenty of brown sugar, malts, oak and figs, hints of sour berries. Some spices and a certain alcoholic bite in the finish. I had to struggle to finish the big bottle by myself, which means that the brown sugar sweetness combined with 8% ABV becomes a little too much in the end. The big bottles are for sharing! Still - this is another solid abbey beer."
"Large bottle, caged and corked. Best before dating found here on the top of the cage. Pours cloudy, warm honey brown.Lots of yeast in the final pour. Head is huge, tan, very long standing , world class lace production. Nose is an interesting mix of soap/ginger/spice/sugar and perfume. Lucious brew. Heady. Complex. A ton of warming fruit flavors. Spicy. Herbal. Sweet. Flows smoothly of the tongue, warms the throat and stimulates the senses. Fine, fine brew."
"Taste/Mouthfeel: Huge hit of malt! After the initial malt jolt, a nice balanced sweet taste lingers. Can't really taste the alcohol, it's well hidden. Very slight bitterness, just a tease, and it seems to work. Full bodied, though slightly overcarbonated for my taste. It's a nice taste, but a little too dominated by the sweetness."
"Poured into a chalice from an 11.2 oz bottle with a 01/01/07 consumption date on the bottle. Pouts a dark murky red with a solid cap of off-white head and a small amount of lace. Smell is bananas, cherries, bready malts, and some spices--very sweet and appealing. Taste is wonderful--everything on the nose comes through, in addition to some plums, raisins, butter, nuts, and cloves---all beautifully blended together in malty goodness. Body is medium/full with low carbonation and a creamy smooth mouthfeel. This is another delicious beer from St. Bernardus, and the only reason I can't drink these every day is the alcohol content."
"Notes: When I first tried this beer 6 months ago, I felt it was the best beer ever. I've since tried many bottles of Prior 8, and found them to be kind of inconsistent. I brought it to a poker game in a 750 ml bottle, and was disappointed (I tell my friends it was a bad bottle, but...). I still rank this as one of my favorites, but somewhere south of the Abt 12 from the same brewery. I hear the recipe is identical to Westvleteren Extra 8. I will try this someday, it is my quest."
"750ml bottle poured into a chalice glass. Pours out a reddish-brown color crowned with a solid white head. Highly fruity aroma with a fair amount of yeastiness. Flavor is good mix of more fruit along with some clovey phenols, a moderate hop bitterness, grassy and earthy, and sweet, bread-like malt. Finish is somewhat tart with a peppery alcohol note. Lots of carbonation makes for a lively mouthfeel."
"Quality brew here. Would be great with a meal, but is wonderful on its own. I wondered about the age of this bottle, but I couldn't find any dates on it. So I'm left to wonder if it ages well or I found a fairly fresh bottle. Still, try some."
"Taste: The flavor was a replica of the aroma. Cocoa, bananas, and cloves were soft upfront. Then, a very light cherry flavor rose up with a decent amount of yeast to give the flavor a little kick. Not a ton of complexity, but very nice overall."
"The palate is much bigger than the bouquet suggests. It is delicious and mouthfilling, with plenty of brown sugar and spice. Notes of banana, butter and cloves add interest. The finish is dignified, if not terribly long. Very nicely balanced."
"Very good  easy pour produced a clear amber brown vessel with a ivory tan head. Aroma was rich with dough, fruit and malts, which also came through in the tastes  along with lite spices, cinnamon. That little butter pop in the finish ends the quaff nicely. Perfect full bodied and lightly carbonated to boot. I could sip this one all night long."
"Pours a deep murky brown with a awesome big fluffy head that settles into a nice creamy top leaving sheets of lace behind,brown sugar and orange marmalade dominate the aromas with some underlying sweet biscuit dough.The taste is much drier than expected,some clovey spicinessis very prevelant along with some unsweetened chocolate along with some toffee finishing pretty rather dry and abrupt.A very nice dubbel complex and not overly sweet a very good beer one to savor."
"A different bottle that looks like all the others with an orange background. Pours a dark, dark brown with a small head. Smell is very pleasant like a red wine with a pinch of alcohol. Candied fruits are also apparent and a hint of apricot. The taste is wonderful. Starts with the fruits and sweet malts, then finishes with what seems to be just a deluge of natural sugar. Really delicious beer."
"might i also add that i had this recently at eli's and it wasn't quite as good. as the bartender at delaney's observed, clean lines can make a dark belgian..."
"Cheers"
"Body is medium, silky smooth with easy-going medium carbonation. Fluffy and chewy at the same time. Excellent, now on to the triple!"
"A nice dubbel, ocassionally too simply sweet, but with enough dark character to make it interesting."
"Another great offering from St. Bernardus!"
"Murky light shoe brown color, massive soapy tan head; incredible patchy lacing. Fruity aroma, plums and dark grapes, yeast and bubble gum detected as the head settles down. Creamy and pasty; the palate is rich and full, sugar, cotton candy, raisins and rum soaked nuts, should there be such a thing. An on-going and rotating offering of more flavorings, plums, cloves, and even some citrus. Belly warming affect, but not overpowering; flavorful and palate-pleasing, this is a winner. Drinkability is off the charts, dare I venture into sessionable-Dubbel? A perfect offering for those just getting started on the Belgium side of the beer arena and a tasty treat for seasoned BAs."
"The appearance is a striking dark ruby color with a fairly thin creamy head. When the light strikes it from certain angles, it appears almost impenetrable and murky; from other angles it is a beautiful clear ruby color. The aroma is an intense mixture of yeast and fruit. My novice nose is not trained enough to pick out the fruits, but needless to say they are varied and intense. The aroma leads into an intense flavor delivered on the wings of a rush of carbonation. Again, I can't pick out individual flavors, but an assortment of dark fruits dominate. I do detect a blast of cherry in the middle. It finishes surprisingly dry with an acidic tartness that I imagine is the lambic trademark (haven't gotten that far yet). Overall, it's a very tasty brew. I didn't enjoy it quite as much as the Abt 12, but that doesn't take away from the fact that this is a wonderful beer."
"A pretty drinkable brew, but not as quaffable as a nice Belgian Pale Ale."
"D- This is a very pleasant dubble that has good maltyness but not a complex as other dubbles I've had. It appears very simple but very elegant."
"Best before 08-07-09 so more then in time. Poors in with nice head thats very fine of cosistance and is lasting quiet well. Beercolor is deepbrown wit litle bronze tone if light falls on. Nos is very delicate. Lots of chocolate an caramel from malts that are there majorly but also good yeastspice. Taste is rich of taste also; malty, litle sweet and spicy again before going into a moderate bitterness thats clean. Creamy mouthfeel and a good cabonisation make mouthfeel to a pleasure too. Hell this is a good brew and would love to have anotherone!"
"Drinkability and Overall: Another classic beer from St. Bernardus. A rich, full Dubbel that is full of complexity. The drinkability is brought down by the incredibly spicy alcohol presence that is left in the throat and belly. This is definitly one to try."
"Very drinkable. This is the third beer I have sampled from this brewery and each one has been stellar. Can't wait to try some of the other offering from St. Bernardus."
"A pouring of this beer produces an off-white head about one finger thick. This head goes down to form a nice layer of foam on top of the opaque garnet beer. Smell is a mixture of cranberry nut bread with strong hints of chocolate. The taste followed the same with a light cherry and cocoa palate. Mouthfeel is dry. I felt there was a bit much carbonation. A good beer and one I'd drink again."
"Mouthfeel: good body, a little on the bland side."
"The beer pours a deep dark brown color with a thick frothy offwhite head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a dry, yet rich malty scent that boasts of pale and crystal malts along with a fruity Belgian yeast aroma. The taste is good. It has a smooth and creamy flavor that boasts of roasted and Belgian crystal malts. It goes down easy and finishes dry and fruity with a warming aftertaste. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium/full bodied beer with good carbonation. This is an excellent Abbey ale. It has great flavor and aroma; a fine sessions beer."
"Drinkability: This beer is drinkable but certainly not a session beer. Its very smooth but the sweetness could overhwelm if having more than 1 or 2. 8% alcohol content will creep up on you if not paying attention. Overall a very good beer, but a little sweet for me IMHO. Definately worth seeking out."
"Overall a very well balanced ale for the alcohol content. This was on sale at the local market for $2.99 a bottle. I'm glad I picked it up, although I don't know if I would pay 7 bucks for it I would definitely recommend anyone give it a try. Cheers."
"Carefully decanted from a long-standing bottle, the prior delivers a crystal-clear chestnut body with a reddish cast and amber and copper highlights. Its huge, pillowy off-white head holds incredibly well and leaves solid sheets of thin, creamy lace about the glass. And there's an added attraction in that you can see the thin rings left from each sip within the solid wall. Candy sugar sweetness, sweet wine, caramel, almond, and vanilla reside in the nose; and appear again in the flavor, balanced by some dark fruitiness (black cherry, plum, fig), alcoholic spice, and leafy hops. It's bitterness is restrained against it's sugary malt, but slowly fights its way through to dominate in the finish (although some splashes of sticky malt do linger). This is a rich, sweet, satisfying, and complex ale that never becomes cloying despite its breadth; and has a great drinkability despite its strength. Impressive!"
"Pours a deep mahogany, with a big foamy tan head that laces, but not too much. Smell was a like weak, but was a pleasant fruity raisin. Taste was a very good caramelly dark fruit, which malts making an appearance and a bit of tartness in the finish. Creamy and smooth, this was a good Dubbel, but not a great Dubbel, still a good start to a night."
"This was a very good beer... I couldn't drink too much more of it though, one bottle was enough."
"As always, this is an excellent brew from St. Bernadus. These monks have managed to bottle the heavenly nectar in a variety of different flavors. The beer pours to a dark nutty brown color with a thick off-white head. The opacity and carbonation of this brew give the appearance of a coca-cola, but the smell and the taste beg to differ. The smell is beatifully floral and fruity as one would expect from an abbey ale. The taste is very similar to the ABT12, but perhaps a little lighter, and definately lighter on the alcohol. It is very well balanced, though the delicious caramel malt obviously shines through along with other sweet candy flavors. I recommend this or any other St. Bernadus product to anybody."
"Drinkablity. If I could afford it, I could drink this beer all day long. It would probably have to be a relatively cool day. Perhaps while skiing. In a flask perhaps. No, alcohol and skiing don't mix well. But Alcohol from St. Bernardus mixes well with just about anything."
"i could drink it all night (and day). delicious"
"There's alot going on here, but not all of it's good. This beer just doesn't have the same cohesive *bang* of a better-balanced dubble. It's still pretty darn good, though."
"This beer pours a murkey brown color wtiha nice 2 finger head that falls to thickly coat the beer. The nose is sweet raisiney fruity. Very mellow and pretty much what I was hoping to smell. There is some alcohol in there as well, but just as an afterthought. The flavor is very nice. A smooth raisiney character is put alongside a slightly roasted character, not quite chocolatey, but just a hint of roasted. What a nice nice beer. The feel is right at moderate thickess, but as smooth as a beer has ever been. This could make a run at the 12 for my favorite beer from these people. I do recommend this one."
"Drinkability: Great Drink! (Though I expect this is even better in the bottle)"
"This is definitely a great beer to sip while reading or working on the web."
"Drinkability: This is worth a repeat."
"Final Thought: This is quite a remarkable beer."
"33 cl bottle. Pours dark brown with a fluffy light tan head that stuck around forever. Vinous, earthy aromas amidst a dark malt and candi sugar profile with some underlying careb and unsweetened, buttery chocolate notes. Superbly complex in taste; malty, earthy and smooth. Hoppier and a little more astringent than your average dubbel. Very good carbonation aids the dryness of the beer."
"Small 33 cl bottle...reddish brown and dark, lightly hazy with some chunks. Medium but rising head, light tan and settling as a flat surface with good embedded tight carbonation. and long-lasting properties. Plenty of lace, lots of small details on the sides of a Trois Pistoles chalice. Aroma is deep, candied cherry and molasses with cinnamon bread maltiness with yeast smells. Mouthfeel is medium to full with the carbonation prickly enough to make it mouth filling. Lots of interesting flavors, candies of chocolate and caramel, slight toffee roundness -- but what's most interesting is the fruit undertones, varied and ranging as deep as red wine-soaked prunes to bright berries with an estery leavening. Finishes with minimal apparent hops but slightly more dry than some Dubbels. I'm a big fan of this brewery."
"Rather strong stuff for a double, but a good beer by any means. Worth seeking out!"
"It's been a long time since I had an authentic Belgian ale, and even longer since I reviewed one. This is a very pleasing one that has tons of delicious flavor but not quite as much complexity as I was anticipating. It is a very dark sepia color with flashes of orange at the edges. The head isn't super-charged, but ample and permanent. Not really any lacing. Small grains of sediment, or perhaps they are sunken bubbles, rest on the slope of the glass. The nose is vibrant, toffeeish and fruity. The flavor is primarily sweet, with lots of lush graininess and peppery spice. A lactic funk provokes thoughts of fine farmhouse cheese, and a note of numbing alcohol marries perfectly with the brew. Mouthfeel soft and yielding, velvelty smooth on the tongue. Despite its darkness and robust character, the beer manages to be refreshing. The light cleansing grass twinge at the end makes this a particularly drinkable beer. My oh my, this is delicious, and it's aching to be accompanied by food, either a robust but milky cheese, or a lightly tangy dark meat. To be bought and enjoyed by me again, in the very near future, I hope!"
"My scores 5.0 scores all teeter between 5.o and 4.5....being this is one of the best dubbels I've had I rounded up..."
"Contrary to others, I happen to like this one more than Pater 6. Very tasty stuff here."
"Overall Impression: An enjoyable treat. Flavor is complete with all tastes melding nicely. Mouthfeel is nice and dry, lively but not fizzy. Looks nice and dark with substantial lace. Drinkability is pretty good. Im enjoying this one and will buy others. Hard to find any faults, but its also not the pinnacle of sublime joy. A very solid dubbel."
"This Trappist poured a medium dark brown, with a medium amount of tan foam and some lace. The smell of hops and fruit was evident in the aroma. The taste was of a fruity nature, with hop's to finish it out. The finish ad a sour, bitterness feel in the mouth and palate. This ale would have had more intense flavor if it wern't for the over tartness and sour after taste that I found."
"This came from the tap in a chalice at Anam Cara. It was a deep chocolate brown with a thick rich tan colored head. I mean a huge gushing head that settled after 5 minutes into the beer. The lace turned into a thick clingy lace on the rim. The nose is sweet malty figgy sugar. Hints of candy and dates. The taste is more candy and figs. Just a slight hint of flowery hops. Thick mouth feel, and a medium drinkability. I think the dubbel style is my favorite Belgian, and this beer is close to the top."
"Ruby brown is color with a thick tan head. The aroma is malty, sweet candi sugars, spicy yeastiness, with a dark fruity, breadiness. The flavor is yeasty, and malty. It has a raison and date-like flavor, with some rum like qualities. It has a soft bready flavor as well. It is very light and fluffy in the texture and rather smooth drinking. I am a big fan of the dubbels, and this is no exception. A very well done beer."
"Feel is creamy and nearly full with some light drying effects floating around and finishes terrific with a super yummy and smooth exhibition of chewy fruits and earthly delights. Another fine drinker by St. Bernardnus - which I've mentioned in other reviews of their first-class brews is that the drinkability is amazingly easy to handle. All that I've imbibed by these jolly monks has been top notch good stuff! Recommended to try any and all by Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV."
"As I said in my opening statement, this is a very smooth, drinkable dubbel. I'm ready to curl up with another and let this beer do it's magic."
"Drinkability is quite high, finished the whole 750ml myself in about an hour from the uncorking. Flavor broadened somewhat as it warmed with no bitterness or off-putting characteristics at all. A wonderful example of the Belgian art, though I prefer the 10 & 12 more."
"A brown brew with a off-white head nice and full leaves a light coating of lace. Aroma is dark fruity grapes, figs light hints of banana bread coming thru. Taste is alive rolls smoothly over the tounge imparting sweet fig like flavors as it goes leaving a longing sweetness of malt followed by a spicey and lightly hoppy dry finish alcohol not really present but warms the throat and tummy. This beer is good, will be great this winter it is the first Dubble I have enjoyed, was starting to wonder about this style but this one has restored my faith, did I mention it was kickass. Mouthfeel is full not really heavy I would say about as perfect as you could get for this beer. Drinkability is great hard to sip this one just wanting to down it can I have another please?"
"Taste is fruity and yeasty. Spicy. the spiced apple flavor is there again. Winey tasting (vinuous, I guess?). Let's break the fruitiness down: apples, cherries, plum and sour berry. A light alcohol burn and a lightly metallic finish. Full-bodied but velvet smooth. Exceptionally easy to drink for the style. A really excellent beer and I am not a big fan of dubbels. Bravo!"
"I would love to try this beer along side the real trappists to see which I like better."
"Dark copper hue, medium off-white head consisting of big bubbles, mostly diminishing. Big yeasty (dough, light must) and vinous aroma with several fruity hints (banana, plums, grapes) matching a generous toffee and alcohol presence. RIchly malty. Sweet on the tongue, with scotch ale characteristics, but a very yeasty one. Mild acidic profile. More alcohol than most in the finish. Not so balanced imo, leaves an oily coat around the mouth. Slight yeasty and leafy bitterness. Medium body is extremely bubbly, a bit too much for its own good."
"Pours a deep caramel with a lovely, considerable head. Smells distinctly Belgian (duh). Sweet bready smell, alcohol, some fruit, citrus on the nose. Nice malt flavor, bread, sweetness, some citrus. I was hooked at the first sip, great tasting brew. Satin smooth in the mouth and easily drinkable. I will be looking for this again the next time I make a Belgian brew trek to Marty's in Newton, Mass."
"Very soft and silky head, very beautiful and lasting on an intense dark brown color. The smell shows sweet notes of raspberries and grapefruit. Some wooden notes of cinammon (maybe). The first sip is so delightful: chocolate-like and winy with a fruity complexity. Great mouthfeel, creamy, soft and smooth. Then, a sweet seltzer like aspect appears, and the hops reveal a dry and citric character. Maybe the alcohol could be a bit less noticeable. A good beer nonetheless."
"Pretty drinkable, but honestly a little cloying. Kind of gumming up my mouth actually. But I would still do a couple in a sitting if I had them."
"This stuff poured alot darker than I thought it would have. A dark copper, caramel like colour. Monster sandy off-white head with real sticky lacing. The smell is very sweet and spicy as is expected from this style. A little raisin like. The taste was really impressive. I thought so, anyway. A lot of candied fruit, brown sugar, cloves and other spice. Very tasty. It did, however, have a little bit more carbonation to it than I expected. This doesn't ruin it for me, but it does prevent me from giving mouth feel a 4.5. Overall, I was quite impressed with this one, and I feel they do a nice job of concealing the 8.0%abv. This stuff doesn't even have the warming sensation many others have. Definitely worth a try."
"Pours a caramel colour with a super huge frothy head. Way too much carbonation. Yeasties floating around. Just hanging out. Drinking this particular beer is a lot like biting into a chunk of bread. There isn't much else to say about it. It's just not my thing. That's okay, though. I'm aging one. we'll see how it does with 10 years on it."
"The taste is complex and took me a while to separate each flavor for my notes. I had to let it warm a little before the flavor really came through. It is both sweet and chewy with a fruity acidic flavor of bananas and cloves and a smoky plum (hoisin??) salty afterbite. A delicate brew that would warm me up on a cold Colorado fall night... Good Stuff."
"Pours cloudy brown in color with a huge light brown head that sticks to the sides of my glass. Fruity sweet and spicy aromas, sugary plum and raisin flavors, medium bodied with a crisp almost soda like mouthfeel, finishes with a brown sugar sweetness."
"11.2 oz. bottle with a smiling belgian monk on the front. Aroma was strong in alcohol and fruity esters. For some reason there were dark flakes on top od the head which was very thick and refused to die down. This ale poured a dark murky brown which swallowed any light which tried to pass through. The taste was remarkable in that it was rich in dark sweet malt flavors and some dark fruit flavors as well. The mouthfeel has that Belgian qualitiy in that it is effervescent but not rough on the tongue. The carbonation seems like champagne but the body of the ale lets you know malt is involved."
"Sampled at From The Vine beer tasting Jul 9th, 2004: Pours a lightly cloudy brown color with a light tan head. Thin lacing. The aroma is an interesting concoction of malt, raisin and caramel. Medium-bodied with a great Belgian feel from the get-go. Flavors of spice (cinnamon and coriander), yeast, warming alcohol and caramel. The finish is nicely complex with lots of spice and malt. I am a fan of the 12 and this beer is no slouch either."
"Drinkability/Overall: I could drink this exceptional brew all day without a complaint. I think i'm in love!"
"This is very drinkable. A very tasty dubbel. It goes down easily enough that one forgets the high abv. For that reason, it would probably not be a great session beer. It makes a great dessert beer, however."
"The quality of the beer is immediately apparent in the reddish brown insanely carbonated body, and the towering tan head. The aroma is complex, with chocolate, honey, and musk on the nose. The taste has a warm and spicy alcohol bite, with a banana nut bread taste, and some dusty yeast lurking in the back. The mouthfeel is creamy and a bit on the light side. This is technically a Dubbel, but comes in Tripel strength of 8% ABV. A welcome newcomer to Georgia shelves."
"Mouthfeel is good, the right consistency for a Belgian, medium - thick with some carbonation while the drinkability is also good, as expected."
"Bottle: Poured a quite opaque brown beer with a great head with good retention. Aroma is bit weaker then expected with some roasted malts and some light plums. Taste is also a mix between roasted malts, a bit of candi sugar and some light plums. Overall, this is a good beer lacking a bit of complexity and overshadowed by better products from this brewery."
"5 years later, and licorice and molasses."
"A very simple and tasty belgian dubbel. Maybe not as complex as some of the more in your face versions, but very drinkable and extremely tasty."
"Every Dubbel makes me like the style more and more."
"That settles it. Im getting a brown robe and a dumb haircut."
"Goodness aplenty in this bottle. A keeper if ever there was."
"Quite the rich complex offering. Almost a bit cloying and definitly a belly warmer. Good dessert beer."
"Huge head which sticks around and will not be denied. Sipping the beer with a moustache will leave some foam on the 'ole ""flavor saver"" for later. Particles of brownish specks in the head, rather unusual. Delicate and sticky lacing, the color of the beer is a dark red, almost mahogany. Smell is surprisingly light with no real ""waves"" of florals or fruits like other Belgians I have tried. What it lacks in smell it more than makes up for in taste. This beer is world class in the taste department. Fig, maybe some light butterscotch, I also get some otherworldy flavors I am not sure I can even describe with words. Truly amazing."
"Hazy cocoa brown colored, thick looking, with particles suspending and moving. A foamy one-inch beige head rises up and lingers. There is no aroma, but for a bit of yeasty notes. Flavor is initially sweet and figgy, with some cocoa. A bit of clove and light brown sugar, but not too complex. Mouthfeel is a bit tingly. Better as it warms, but I've had better Belgians."
"This brew blew me away.. Brown/ruby color in the goblet. Huge beige head. Nutty (hazelnut) orange peel smell. Persistant 1 inch head. Smooth clove, nutty , cinnamon, chocolate taste. Very smooth fuller mouth. This is the beer to drink while sitting by the fire on a cool night with your dog by your side. Soo rich, smooth, and comforting. What a Dubbel should be... excellent!"
"Incredible mix of raspy and gritty hops and a million-dollar-violin deep shiny sweetness. Stupendous."
"murky dark brown in color with suspended chunks. enormous off white/tan head that recedes to an ever-present 1/8"" foam. spectacular lacing. huge sweet malt aroma, i'm thinking figs and other assorted dark fruits. silky smooth in the mouth while maintaining a very lively carbonation....just amazing. big sweet malt flavor, full of dark fruit and brown sugar flavors with bready undertones. alcohol is slightly detectable. light on the hops, but a phenolic spiciness finsihes things off well. quite strong, the sweetness keeps it from being much of a session brew. still, a sheer pleasure to enjoy, extremely well crafted with more character than most. highly recommended."
"The mouthfeel is smooth with a crisp finish. Medium bodied. The malt lingers on the tongue after swallowing. Extremely drinkable as this is so flavorful as a dubbel and the alcohol is barely noticeable."
"While the Abt. 12 has a more complex flavor, I think the Prior 8 wins of drinkability. A supremely drinkable, tasty Trappist Ale, and proof that St. Bernadus can do no wrong."
"Sharp citrusy flavors counter the sweetness to near perfection. A light taste of cloves, coriander and peppery spices, quite separate at first, blend in as it warms. The alcohol is noticeable, but in a totally subtle way. Nice!"
"A fantastic looking beer. It has a perfect head atop a remarkable body of golden brownish red. The fresh aroma hints at fruit and alcohol. It's rich in flavor, which ranges from a slight sweetness and caramel aspect to a somewhat banana-like fruitiness. Feels like heaven in my mouth; it's silky with an appropriate yeasty zing. I'd kill a six-pack of these if they made it. I can see this beer in my future."
"Sometimes the Toad still amazes me. What a rare find on tap! And they served it in a St. Bernardus stemmed balloon glass. Sweet ass! It appeared an opaque, dark brown with some streaks of red here and there towards the bottom of the glass and when you looked at it over top. Had a nice tanish head that receded into the slick you see, but had a great lacing. Smelled of currents, raisins, slight estery notes and a good showing of caramelized sugar tinted with a nice smokiness. The taste was sweet and dry with the dried fruits taking over and morphing towards the end into a nice licorice finish. Stickiness stuck to my lips. There was a good aggressive carbonation to this beer without going overboard and it complemented the beer quite well."
"Pours dark brown in color with a very lively and robust head that shows little sign of dissipating even several minutes after the initial pour. Nose is candied sugar and dark fruit along with some fainter aromas of buttery caramel and spicy alcohol. Medium to full in body with a very smooth and creamy texture. Taste begins with notes of bread pudding blended with rum-soaked raisins followed by some vanilla extract and a bite of peppery alcohol in the finish. A note on the back of the bottle says that this beer can be enjoyed aged up to 10 years, so I suppose Ill lay a few bottles down (I doubt Ill be able to wait that long, though)."
"O- this is a good beer....but nothing compares to the abt 12. If I was going to spend the cash I would prefer the Ommegang Abbey Ale if going for the same style. Or the Abt 12 if I wanted to get the best beer they make (still to be confirmed since I have the tripel and pater to drink still)"
"The appearance of this dubble was excellent. Dark, dark brown with an immense tan head and plenty of yeast floating about. The smell was sweet and yeasty with some hints of the fruit notes contained within. The taste was excellent as well. Up front yeast and bread followed by some fruity notes, and then a warm alcohol finish. The alcohol is present yet not overwhelming. Very similar to the abt 12, although not quite as sweet, and the fruit taste's are not as discernible. Mouthfeel is creamy and satisfying, although the carbonation is filling in itself. Drinkability is excellent, the lack of sweetness when compared to the abt 12 makes this actually more drinkable than it's big brother. Defiantly something to try if you get the chance."
"Presentation: 33 cl bottle from a St Bernardus Sampler Pack (with free St. Bernardus Goblet included). Appearance: Opaque dark brown (I looked for other colors and could not see them) with a 1/2 inch off-white head that stuck around for a good long time. Aroma: I am in heaven! Lots of different sweet desserty fruits (brandied plums, raisins, chocolate). Flavor: The aroma follows through in this meal of a beer (OK, dessert of a beer) with bready (date nut bread?) chocolaty, and slightly coffeeish flavor. The head helped make for a very smooth creamy mouthfeel. This is the first time I have tried it, and it is easily one of my favorites."
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability: Med-High in body. Creamy smooth on the palate. One to sit by the fire with with your best dog at your feet, while the chill rain falls outside. Slow down and savor this one."
"11.2 oz bottle served into a St. Bernardus goblet. Raisiny-brown color with a nice fluffy head and a nice bit of carbonation. Smell is reminiscent of its more potent sibling, but a little more restrained. Dead-on for the style. Plenty of spice in the body, a bit of a banana-bread feel with a nice alcohol backbone. Flavors not as developed as the Abt 12, but that's exactly what I expected.Smooth mouthfeel, almost velvety. Eminently drinkable, a worthly little brother to the 12. Hats off again to the smiling monk.."
"11.2 oz bottle served at cellar temp. into a St Bernardus goblet. Pours a somewhat murky dark chestnut brown, with a light cocoa head that has excellent retention. Sheet lacing all over the goblet is impressive to behold. Aroma is of a classic Belgian of this style. Earthiness, spices such as cloves and coriander, a whiff of alcohol, and the tug of war between the dark fruits and the pineapple/mango/banana. Moderate carbonation tingles the mouth, before seeming to melt like a marshmallow. Taste is not nearly as complex as the nose, or as other St Bernardus offerings I've sampled, but is very well balanced with a hop presence to counter the sweet malt backbone. Finish is clean and a bit dry. Nothing to complain about here, and this one is another St Bernardus that made me glad I bought the 4 bottle sampler pack that included the nice goblet. Wish I had bought the other 3 sampler packs that were left on the shelf."
"Typical 11.2 oz Beglian bottle with an orange label and a jolly old fellow that reminds me a bit of my dear-departed grandfather. It pours dark brown with a fat off-white head with amazing retention. The head sticks to everything it touches and looks like a sand-blaster will be necessary to remove it. In other words, it's a damn fine-looking beer. The smell is nice dark fruit but a bit more alcohol than expected for an 8% abv beer. Raisins, ripe plum, and a hint of cherry are backed with a twinge of tartness. Although the flavor is on the tame side compared to others of its style, it's a very classy/classic tasting beer. Very nice for a cool winter afternoon."
"Overall Impression: A nice bruin from a great brewery. Abt 12 is obviously the shining star, so it's easy to overlook their other beers which are also quite good. Just look at how many reviews there are for the 12 as opposed to this one!"
"Thick foamy tan head built of big bubbles. The beer is dark brown in color, only a little light makes it through, and small light brown flecks of yeast float throughout. The aroma is of malty bread and burnt nuts. The flavor is a mix of dark fruits, bitter chocolate,and other flavors that I can't quite get. A fairly complex beer with a moderate body and plenty of carbonation."
"Appearance: Murky brown with a soft bubbly tan head leaves behind very nicely patterned lacing. Aroma: Raisins and green apple fruit esters fill my senses with toasted malts adding a bit of sweetness to the mix with an herbal air about it not bad. Taste: Not an overly sweet dubbel a bit dry in the finish but the underlying fruit tones are more than satisfactory, with rich complex layers of bready yeast, chocolate, apples and raisins. This is an awesome dubbel, mouthfeel well carbonated medium bodied belgian ale. Drinkabiliy: A very complex sorta hard to seek out brew that should be enjoyed in small quantities for the pure quality of this product."
"Pours a dark brown with a thin tan head thats last till the end. Aroma is typical Belgian, yeasty and bready with banana and bubblegum. Taste is sweet and malty with raisin and cherry. Slightly spicy with a dry finish. Mouthfeel is spot on. Very drinkable, hiding the ABV very well."
"Pours a dark musty burgundian brown with tiny sediment particles clinching to the sides of the entire glass. The head is mountainous, dense and definately Belgian. Sheets of lacing left all over the glass with the head lasting the entire session. Rich aroma of red licorice, sweet malts, raisins, yeast and bread. A very vibrant and diverse flavor profile of caramel apples, raisins, figs, cane sugars, spices, sweet candy, yeast and alcohol. Trememdously balanced! Full mouthfeel and a smooth aftertaste that lingers on and on. Stupendous!"
"A very good brew indeed! God, I love the stuff that comes out of this place! The beer pours about as dark brown as the spectrum allows with hints of orange. An awesome head forms and sticks like mad throughout. Aromas are all about sweet malt, vanilla cream, chocolate banana, dried fruit, very assertive in flavor....a baby version of the awesome ABT 12. Perhaps a bit lighter, but the mouthefeel is still one of large-ness, and complex-ness, this is a super sipper, and perhaps the perfect beer to offer before the ABT 12. Start with the triple and call it a day! I can't say enough about the value found here at this facility. Find them and buy them! I paid 2.99 for this and the triple. 3.49 for the 12-serious chit."
"Pours a murky dark brown with maroon highlights. Enormous dishsoap head, tremendous lace. Aromas of vanilla, dark tropical fruits and cough syrup. Taste is very malty with a little bit of the dark fruit in the aroma. No bitterness whatsoever and finish is a little watery. Fairly tasty but nothing special."
"The murky cola look is is followed by a nice nose of fruity goodness. Lots of plums, cherries and raisins luking in there with a very nice earthy overlay from the yeast. The flavor is dried fruits much along the lines established by the aroma. The feel is medium with nice crisp and clean lines. Decent drinkability."
"Prior 8 struck me as the slightly more alcohol-laden version of the Pater 6. Prior 8 is wonderfully drinkable but can put a bit of a dent in ones sobriety. Another superb beer by the monks at Brouwerij Sint Bernardus."
"A nice garnet color when held up to the light, otherwise this is an amber beer topped by a tan head. A spicy musty aroma wafts from my goblet. There are undertones of fruit in the aroma as well. Definitely spicy tasting as well, finishes a bit hot. This beer definitely features what Belgian yeast can do. Lots of yeast character here. There is a subtle malty sweetness that helps to carry the complex yeast flavors and aromas. The spice notes from the yeast that I can differentiate are; ginger, pepper, bergamot, and cardamom. This beer is medium bodied, though, as many Belgian beers are, it is quite light for its alcohol content. This beer is very similar to the 6, just a little bit richer."
"Dark brown color. Medium white foamy head. Aroma is malty, bready and sweet. A medium bodied Belgian Ale. Malts are sweet and fruity. Nicely spicy. Touch of molasses, cane sugar, dark fruits (plums and cherries) and spices. Touch of mustiness. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly sweet."
"Wow!"
"one of the truly great belgian beers and one ill be giving further inspection for the rest of my beer drinking life. fair dinkum, beer drinking doesnt get much better than this. a bona fide classic."
" The taste is rich and creamy, smooth and full with a fluffy texture, a slight bitterness and the end, along with a bit of warming alcohol. This one sticks a bit to the palate in a pleasant way..I prefered this one over their tripel. Quite quaffable.."
"Deep and somewhat murky looking burgandy. Big and hefty pillowy light beige head. Retention is stupendous. Aroma is yeast sediment, must, candy, raisin, rum and bread. This beer is pretty delicate in its flavor profile. The first impressions I get are rumcake and bread pudding. Then some dark fruits enter the picture. Black cherry. Plum. Eventually some alcohol soaked raisins and sweet candy/ bubblegum esters seep into the picture. This beer feels like velvet in the mouth. Low carbonation and about medium body. Nice little beverage here."
"If feels like watery syrup. Medium bodied. Carbonation fills the mouth. It is not an ale I would personally drink more than one in a row. This is definately a dessert ale for my tastes."
"330 ml bottle. Best before date of end of 2004."
"Drinkability  This was a wonderful ale that went down nicely and was a joy to consume."
"The beer pours an opaque brown color, the head mountainous and light tan that is also semi-creamy in texture with the lace forming a silk like curtain to conceal the glass. Sweet malted grains, bubble gum and hints of yeast, maybe even an over ripe banana, at any rate a first class nose to be sure. Start is rich in malt, lightly sweet; the top feels full and rich. Finish has a suitable acidity and the hops are unobjectionable in their spicy bite, very dry somewhat vinous aftertaste, and the 8 percent ABV does warm the tummy, a most pleasing beer to end the day."
"Consumed at Brouwzael in Ghent. Appearance: Reddish brown, big head, somewhat cloudy. Aroma: Big malty sweetness, and in addition some roastiness. Flavor: Clearn, refreshing raisin/rum flavo, balanced by a subtle roastiness. Finish: Crisp from roastiness. Very rich."
"In looking at the other reviews, you would think I got a different beer. The aroma was understated with a nose of alcohol and slight raisin. The flavor is uniquely Belgian, but lacking in complexity. It does have a slight raisin/plum finish, but it reminds me more of molasses. The alcohol is huge in this beer and overshadows all else. Not a bad beer, but not my first choice for a dubbel."
"A Trappist beer for Atheists! EXCELLENT. No wonder the Monk on the label has a friggin smile on his face; he needs to loose the James Brown threads though!"
"Full, rocky tan head that maintains a good presence to the end. A cloudy dark brown/red color, with plenty of sediment. The aroma is yeasty, of dried fruit, malt, bubblegum and a little medicinal. Flavor was quite complex: sweet start, creamy/malty middle with a dry spicy finish that maintained a taste of plums. The mouth feel is full-bodied, and smooth with relatively low presence of carbonation. It rolls off the tongue leaving an oily consistency. St. Bernardus has a pleasant well-rounded blend of flavors and mouth feel with no overwhelming/over the top characteristics."
"Yum."
"A beautiful beer when poured, just like the other St. Bernardus brews. Dark brown and nearly opaque, sporting a good sized off-white head that stays exceptionally well with no help whatsoever. Leaves a nice Belgian lace too. Rather yeasty pour though, watch out if you don't want it in there. The aroma is big, caramel malt and spicy yeast jump out at you with a little candi sugar showing itself here and there. As it hits the palate, spiciness is most noticeable, partially due to the great hopping and partially due to the yeast strain used in brewing this. The big helping of sweetness that balances this out perfectly isn't far behind however. Caramel and candi sugar with a bit of grain. Lots of dark fruits, plum and raisin. Very creamy mouthfeel. The finish has a good amount of sweetness, but the aftertaste is a bit dry and hoppy. A very enjoyable beer, kind of like a toned-down Abt 12. Extremely drinkable. I wish I had one of the 750 ml bottles I saw today instead of this little 330 ml one."
"11.2oz bottle pours a brilliant vermillion with a massive bubble-bath-in-my-brew almond head that lasted forever. an almost solid wall of lace is left on the glass. Lots of yeasties floating around, and a substantial amount of gunk was left behind in the bottle. Aromas of spice and tropical fruit. Taste is more fruit and spices, with sticky malt and warming alcohol. Good yeast presence - there but not too much. High carbonation but not too imposing. Slightly dry, malt finish. Quite drinkable and enjoyable. I think this bier has taken me to the 'other side'. Definitely worth a visit every now and again."
"Nice dark amber brown color with a huge head that exploded out of the bottle before I could pour it. Good smell that is sweet and malty but with a slight sour smell to it. Hints of a raison and spice aroma. The taste is sweet and malty with a slight spiciness. Flavors include raisons, fruits, and spices typical for abbey's. Overall a good beer. Could be a little heavy or thick - kind of a thin begining taste but that ok cause it finishes nicely."
"Chestnut brown color with a frothy off-white head. Rings of lace permeate the chalice glass. Bouquet features dark fruit, yeast, sweet malts and fruity esters. Taste features an amalgam of sweeter flavor profiles including dates, plump raisins, and brown sugar, all while finishing with amildly assertive hop twang and a rush of alcohol. Mouthfeel is creamy, smooth, and luxurious. This is a very drinkable dubbel ale from an outstanding brewery."
"A hell of a lil' cousin to the tripel and Abt 12."
"Dayton, OH AleFest:This beer had a medium sized ivory head that contained fine-small sized bubbles.The body was slghtly hazy with some carbonation noted.The hue of this beer was brown and the nose was that of alcohol and malt.The flavor was malty and hoppy.The mouthfeel of this beer was smooth, tingly, watery, and light-medium bodied.This beer also had average lacing."
"This beer pours a cloudy brown color with a nice full head and just a little lacing on the glass. The aroma was very fruity with some yeast and alcohol notes. The flavor is very much the same as the aroma. It is fruity, malty, and slightly spicy, but very smooth and enjoyable. This is a very nice Belgian."
"Drinkability: Decent... This is a bit disappointing considering how good their tripel and wit are."
"Murky dark brown, tan highlights thick beige head, over a fingers worth. Excellent retention; rings lace. Lovely Dubbel nose sweet alcohol, malty and organic, spicy with fruity hints. Inviting. Pleasantly spicy palate with strong undercurrents of malty alcohol. A licorice note is unleashed midway through with a nice organic finish. The alcohol might be a tad blunt. The dark fruitiness mingles well... there are plenty of subtle nuances. The carbonation is heavy and it adds harshness to the palate. Medium-full body. Overall this is a decent and agreeable beer, it does lack a little but for the cost, it is worth a try."
"Not a nectar of the gods like abt 12, but still a very good brew."
"Maybe I expected more."
"Pours nice medium head. Settles quickly with good lace. Pretty dark brown. Possibly vanilla and fruit and chocolate mixed in. Really creamy the minute it hits your tongue followed by a good bite. Leaves mouth velvetty and malty. Upfront there is a mixture of fruit and malt. Alchohol is not upfront. Only downfall is a little chemical taste. Not quite as fulfilling as the green(tripel) or blue (abt12) but still excellent. Don't pass any of these up if you have a chance to try"
"Poured a color that was a blend of chestnut and ruby. Also had a soft pillow-like head and nice soft lace. Fairly good looking brew. Nose was of grapes, roasted malt, and some notes of coconut. Opens to an oaky character, as well as showed a wine-like alcohol presence. Taste was creamy, though mostly a mellow and lightly sweet malt with a developing nutty-toasty taste. Had a soft mouthfeel and a moderate length finish - quite lush, it really reinforced all the flavors. Soft and barely drying, this beer became earthy with time. A good dubbel, could have a more pronounced profile."
"St. Bernadus Prior 8: A creamy tan head sits on top of a murky brown beer that light cannot penetrate. Fairly strong aroma, smells of raisons and other dried fruits. Although I’ve not had great luck with brown beers from Belgium, but this beer tastes very good. Its got nice malt characteristics that add a nice sweetness that tends to supplement the yeast flavors that are so characteristic of this style of beer. The dominant tastes are the dried fruits noted above. The body is light, but this beer is somewhat carbonated. Very nice."
"F."
"This beer poured a dark amber color and formed an off white foamy head that disapted leaving circular lace. A medium amount of carbonation is present. An aroma of malt and caramel. A flavor of malt, caramel and slight touch of butterscotch. A fairly light finish to it, with little elements present that make up the flavor and aroma. A good beer, but not the best by this brewer, however."
"Beautiful, opaque burgandy brown with a high tan head and wisps of lace. Incredible aroma of freshly baked brown bread , cherries and plums. They should make air frsheners that smell so good! Initial sip dissapoints - a bit thin with a peppery carb bite up front, not alot of brown malt or candy sugar flavors. Some hints of licorice and coco and a tongue clenching hop bitterness and sour cherry notes on the finish. 8% alc./vol. is hidden well in this medium bodied and very drinkable Abbey Brown."
"This beer poured a cloudy brown with rich, thick, light tan foam that left lace on the goblet. The smell was malty, biscuity, and yeasty. The taste was malty with a hint of musty grapes (and some yeast if the sediment was poured). The hop character was modest, but there was some floral hop flavor. The mouthfeel was creamy, clean, and warming. There was a slight tartness also. The drinkability was good."
"Thanks to D & V International for the sample. http://www.specialtybeer.com"
"Hazy dark crimson hue. Creamy, thick beige head. Loose lace. Soft, yeasty aroma w/ subtle notes of fig and cinnamon. Hints of chocolate and raisiny sweetness. Mellow dark caramel and banana esters as well in aroma. Bourbon laced sweetness upfront, followed by nutty malt and hints of toffee. Dark, ripe figs and prunes add a dark fruity overlay. Well calculated light bitterness leaves a pleasant residual sweetness. Moderate in body and mearly perfectly smooth in mouthfeel. Understated banana esters and clove. Finishes w/ a hint of buttery malt and fading yeast must. Prior 8 is quite a tasty brew. It's not overly complex, but rather soft and tremendously balanced. Akin to a milder version of Rochefort 8. Most worthy of a 750 ml portion-- 11.2 oz teases the palate."
"Taste follows through on the nose - chocolatey, nutty, maltinmess with a definite decoctionlike flavor, hints of banana and vanilla in the background. Very round mouthfeel, with a slight but notable warming surge o' alcohol in the finish. Very nice, very drinkable, but somehow not a ""gottahavanotha"" brew."
"Vanillan, caramelly sort of aroma, also some dark fruits. Quite rich and smooth, on the sweeter side of the scale, with caramel maltiness, suggestions of spice, quite yeasty aswell, OK, but not a masterpiece."
