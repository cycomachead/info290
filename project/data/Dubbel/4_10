I haven't had the dubbel because I feel it'll be close to their tripel, which is a good beer, but doesn't blow me away—but the Dubbel Reserve is cut from a different cloth. It pours a dark amber color and smells of fruit and sugar. It tastes of fruit and goes down very smoothly with a little bit of an edge to it that makes it unique. It says it's aged in a cellar, and I wouldn't mind taking a trip to that cellar to thank it for its great work.","bmeehan","Mar 21, 2015"

Aroma is mainly yeast, some malt, fruit, spice. Flavor's similar to nose, somewhat bittersweet along with some carbonic tang and a little metallic. The metallic affects the body leaving high points that don't fit. Maybe this beer gets a lot better with age, as the label suggests.","drpimento","Feb 23, 2015"

I really think that Allagash does a good job at not only representing this type, but capturing the whole spectrum of Belgian ales. An above average ale, no shame in serving this or ordering. I will go back again. A very nice break from the dozen or so IPAs you will run across tonight.","JLSIV","Aug 01, 2014"

Heart aromas of nut and toffee, with hints of booze and smoke. Flavors of roast and smoke initially, with a nutty sweetness forming a solid backbone. Subtle, tangy sweetness at the end of the palate and into the aftertaste. Smoke rejoins the toffee and nut sweetness in the aftertaste, blending into a smooth, light finish despite the robust palate and body throughout. Easy to drink and pretty damn tasty.","GarthDanielson","Jun 10, 2013"

Bananas and cloves tickle the nose as a rich brown sugar scent satisfies. The taste? Remarkable. The spice hits the tongue immediately followed by a rush of light sweetness. It's subtly estery. Belgian yeast is at the forefront, that is for sure. It has a very rich malty flavor with a hint of herbal hop. The mouthfeel is lightly creamy and all too spectacular.

Sweet malt, light fruit and Belgian spicing aroma. Complex fruit, sweet malt and spice flavor. Some spice and hop bitterness in the middle and finish, with a pleasant malt and clove element to the aftertaste. Somewhat more spiced and more reminiscent of a tripel in some respects. A different take on the dubbel that works well.","LiquidAmber","Mar 21, 2012"

It leaves a lot of lacing on the glass. The aroma is alive with sweet malts, yeast, coriander and other spices, with a slight hop coating. The body is medium. The flavor is of candied malts and pepper. It ends fairly dry. I liked it.","puboflyons","Feb 29, 2012"

I know that I liked this beer, though I'm not heartbroken that it may be the last time I have it in a while due to its unavailability in Northeast Ohio. I believe that there's plenty to recommend about this beer -- nice tasting, beautiful in appearance, and it has a decent mouthfeel -- but I also am not finding it to be terribly memorable as I type up this review and it sits in the glass awaiting further consumption. I guess the best I can say is, try it you can find it, but don't stress if you can't find it.","TheHoppiest","Nov 16, 2011"

4.12,8.4,4,4.5,4,4,4,"750 ml bottle into tulip, batch 67. Pours clear dark reddish brown color with a nice and dense 2 finger light khaki head with fantastic retention that reduces to a thick cap. Some nice lacing clings to the glass as well. Aromas of big raisin, apple, caramel, grape, candi sugar, molasses, and cherry. Some very nice and complex aromas here. Taste of grape, raisin, caramel, toasted malt, chocolate, toffee, and yeast spiciness. Fairly dry finish, but there is some lingering notes of dark fruits, caramel, roasted malt, chocolate, and spices on the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a very nice creamy and smooth mouthfeel. No alcohol noticed at all in the taste or finish. Very nice drinkability for 7%. Overall this is definitely an excellent Dubbel from Allagash. Very balanced and drinkable.","superspak","Oct 09, 2011"

The smell of the beer was a little earthy, it also had some dark fruits and yeast aromas in there. The taste of the beer had some nice sweet flavors upfront that faded into a dry soft aftertaste. The mouthfeel of the beer was pretty good, easy to drink and very smooth. Overall it's a pretty good Dubbel I think. I wasn't disappointed by it at all.","Knapp85","Oct 05, 2011"
4.13,8.7,4,3.5,4.5,4.5,4,"Pours a nice slightly hazy tea color with a bubbly off white head which quickly dissipates. The smell is a little musty, a little belgium funk, with some sugar and grape. The taste is pretty great, this might be aged, but I get some caramel malts, some grape all very dry on the way down along with some almost roasted malt / hop bitterness, this beer taste wise is fantastic.

4.45,17.1,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Perhaps a touch sweeter than classic Trappist Dubbels, but Allagash Dubbel tilts toward the maltier side of the scale for a succulent session that rivals some of the best made Belgian Strong Dark Ales. This beer has proven to cellar with grace and confidence, at least through three years of conditioning.","BEERchitect","Sep 22, 2011"
4,5.3,4,4,4,4,4,"Opens with a large pop. Decants into two snifters, a cloudy brown color with a white head and good staying power. Aroma is raisin, belgian yeast fruityness, large malt and a hint of booze. In the taste, appleskin, white grapes, light fig and some faint spice. It could be the peppery Belgian yeast, or it could be muddled coriander, but there is a small spice on the tip of the tongue. Musty yeast, grapes, and malty all the while with faint caramel. There is a subtle, growing dryness to this beer, and time has evened out all the flavors and made for a smooth feel. Medium bodied, and somewhat light at that. Overall, the Allagash Dubbel holds up nicely with 5+ years on it, a nice treat.","Stinkypuss","Sep 12, 2011"

Scent is dominated by the bready malts, lightly toasted, moderate yeastyness, candi sugar and dark fruits on the back. Taste is fairly malt forward, crusty wheat bread, lightly toasted grians. Candi and brown sugar combine with some fruit notes, yeast profile lower than many other Belgians. Medium bodied, moderate carbonations, minimal lingering sweetness. A nice beer, quite malty yet not as sweet.","rfgetz","Apr 01, 2011"

3.85,1.3,4,4,4,2.5,4,"Poured into my snifter and I am met with a darker amber colored ale and big frothy massive cream colored head with major staying power throughout the session. Nice fruity smells with a malt whiff undertones. Pear and red apples are present. Interesting taste. There is an almost grainy type of taste followed by a leathery/dark chocolate powder at the back of the throat. Big malt/biscuit taste on the swallow. Some coffee taste lingers well after consumption. Just stepped away from the beer and came back for a sip and got major campfire smoke in the taste...and then a huge dose of malt. A lot going on here. Much too carbonated for my liking though. Still getting bubbles in the chest. Overall this is an interesting beer. A lot happening in the this bottle for a Dubbel. Well worth trying out for yourself and seeing what this is all about. At 7% a 750 is rather easy to consume...though I could see the taste getting tiresome.","kaseydad","Mar 26, 2011"
4.18,10,4.5,4,4,4.5,4.5,"Pours a nice mahogany with a red hue shining through. A pearl white head absorbs some of the red color. Laces all the way down the glass. Real nice looking. Aroma of pepper, spices, yeast and dark fruits. Smooth and malty flavor profile. Starts off with just a hint of Belgian spice and pepper, before the sweet dark fruit malts take over. This beer had nearly 2 years of age on it and it really smoothed it over. More malt on the finish, a bit of candied sugar, sweet bread and caramel. Nice sticky mouthfeel.","uustal","Mar 25, 2011"
3.41,-10.3,4,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Poured from a corked/caged 750ml bottle into an Imperial Pint Glass. Dark brown with amber highlights. Good clingy off-white head. Not much in the nose. Clunky flavor of earth and some spice with a dry finish. Something sterile about it -- maybe eucalyptus? No trace of the fruitiness expected in a Dubbel. Generally didn't live up to its pricetag.","CountJustinian","Mar 24, 2011"
3.88,2.1,4,3.5,4,4,4,"This beer is quite cloudy brown in glass sort of muddy with a nice off white head that has good retention. To me the smell is a bit weak and somewhat dominated by belgian yeast character with a bit of clove and horse barn esters coming through. Beyond that there is a bit of bready malt and maybe some slight fruit. The taste too is classic belgian dubbel, I'm actually quite impressed. Fruit, molasses, bready grain and cloves are all present but well blended. The finish is tingly and dry as a result of the fine and lively carbonation. Slightly sweet but not cloying despite having little hop bitterness to balance. Overall quite good, but I expected that having always been impressed by beers from Allagash. They have definitely mastered the classic belgian styles.","fank2788","Mar 18, 2011"

3.62,-4.7,3,3.5,4,3,3.5,"Poured a medium hazy brown with a large off white frothy head that was mostly diminishing but had good lacing. The aroma was of roasted nutty malts, a sweet leathery yeast with hints of burnt coffee, molasses and a mild odor of dried fruit. It tasted lightly bitter in the beginning and finished with a malty-bitter flavor with notes of nuts and coffee with the flavor lasting an average amount of time. Mouthfeel was medium in body and creamy in texture with the carbonation being quite flat. Overall a tasty dubbel, but just an average brew.","KajII","Mar 09, 2011"

3.55,-6.6,4,4,3.5,3.5,3,"I am a bit disappointing with this as I just had it on tap and it was sublime. In the bottle it doesn't taste nearly as impressive. Oh well... I'd get it on tap in a heartbeat, but won't be buying this $8.99 25 ouner bottle again. I will try the trippel though for the same price.

3.74,-1.6,2.5,3.5,4,4.5,3.5,"Mouthfeel is really good, as the beer is weighted well and offers a diverse array of sensations: smooth, creamy, chalky and thin. The chalky feeling in particular makes me feel like I just chewed on raw leaves, and makes this beer oddly similar in some ways to chewing paan (Indian post-meal breath-mint type food). The betel leaf feeling is very nice. Drinkability is aided greatly by the clean finish - all flavors are killed off, allowing the cycle of tastes to begin anew with each new sip. Mouthfeel however is not refreshed each time, which means the chalkiness can build up over time, leading to your teeth to feel like they have been chewing on each other the whole time. Nonetheless, a very enjoyable beer.","veinless","Mar 03, 2011"

Lacing is spotty rings down the side of the glass. Smells like dark fruits (plums, cherries) and pineapple. Tastes of the dark fruit, sweet malt, and yeast. There is a biting bitterness to this beer that hits the back of the tongue. Carbonation is a little flat on this beer. Drinkability is a little above average due to the bitterness and carbonation.

The taste holds notes of brown sugar, figs, cinnamon, nutmeg, and wheat. The body is a light medium, with a moderate carbonation and an almost chewy feel.

The label states that it has a ""remarkably clean finish"" and that is certainly true, this Dubbel is crisp, pleasant and very refreshing.

I bought it because I think the Odyssey is fantastic. The Dubbel just didn't measure up.","confer","Nov 25, 2010"

The taste is a bit austere, but somehow it works, as underneath a few dark fruits and some grain exist, making things a bit more interesting. Mouth-feel moves toward the heavy end of medium. There's not a lot happening with the carbonation, but there's enough to keep an openness to the entire experience.

The appearance is a murky dark ruby brown color with a smallish tan head that left some light lacing on the glass. The smell is of old dusty chocolate, a little spice and earthy qualities, could be a little stronger. The taste starts off with a sweet berry flavor which is quickly subdued by a complex malt profile. The malt has musty chocolate characteristics which lead into a sligh Belgian spice and candi sugar flavor. The feel is a tad thin, with soft carbonation, finishes slightly bitter.

So much so that it practically hid the plum/raisin characteristic I expected from this style. The mouthfeel was a bit thin and watery.

At first the dark fruits from the aroma return but give way to malt flavors, mostly toasted and/or crystal, and some spiciness that reminds me of cloves coupled with a light hop bitterness in the finish. Good mouthfeel, medium body, medium carbonation, just a bit of alcohol warming. Drinkability is ok, I enjoyed this brew but, in my opinion, the dark fruits are just a bit too dominant and make this slightly less drinkable than it would have otherwise been.","mnj21655","Oct 02, 2007"

Pineapple and pear notes lead to a semi-sweet caramel and cocoa powder center. Finishes with drying toasted biscuit and coffee malt notes and some warming spicy alcohol fruitiness.

Taste reveals more of the same with an more alcoholic finish than expected and some lingering chalkiness. Perhaps some oxidation in the bottle. Theres kind of a bitey carbonation that i'm not too fond of but the beer is pretty creamy feeling other than that. I'm going to leave the mouthfeel as an average rating and blame it on oxidation.

This beer also has a pronounced, and complex malt flavor...when followed by the alcohol warmth, it kind of reminds me of warm bread. Plum and yeast flavors are on the back end before a pretty clean finish. Body is somewhat light for a dubbel, and carbonation is a bit much, but this beer still drinks quite easily.

The aroma develops as it warms, yeasty and malty, herbal hops play in the background as some bananas sit around and play cards, a little too reserved for me. The taste is better, though still mellow, just better developed, a woodiness that pairs well with the fruity esters and malty goodness, some chocolate. Unfortunately, there is simply too much carbonationhere to appreciate everything, and it doesn't fade as it warms and sits, and its only saved by the decent body and dry finish that seems to counterbalance everything else out.

This is really far from what I expected when I think of a dubbel, but I'm digging it. Starts off with a mix of cola and dates which reminds me of a malty doppelbock. Soon the toasted and roasted malt come in giving me flavors like that of a porter. Finishes with a slight hop flavor and bitterness and the coffee-like lingering flavor of the malt. Phenolics kind of get run out of this beer by the other flavors, but they are present in the aftertaste. Mouthfeel could be thicker and have more mellow carbonation for my tastes.

A very thin white head forms. The aroma is very malty with a pronounced Belgian spiciness. There's also some sweet overripe fruit in the background. The taste begins with the spiciness and a fruity sweetness enters quickly. A nuttiness seems to be hiding in the finish. All this is supported by a very strong and interesting malt base. The mouthfeel is OK, but it finishes a bit watery and thin. The drinkability is great, the alcohol is hidden nicely and it goes down very easily and smoothly. I had no problem killing the 750 ml bottle by myself on a snowy Friday night. This dubbel is a very good beer, but I can't help thinking something is missing.

The taste is great with a fruity sweetness paired with a hop profile that fluctuates as the beer warms. A variety of flavors dance across my tongue and leave behind a sweet coating that is really very nice. The aftertaste develops into a rather sour flavor in the back of my throat, hence a deduction in points for mouthfeel. I think this would be alleviated by aging. The drinkability is good for this beer despite it's high ABV because of it's distinct flavor spectrum and it's complex texture.","jaluria","Dec 07, 2005"

Taste was a very nice dark earthy malt, with hints of slighty roasted coffee, figs, berries, and brown sugar upfront. These give way to a big yeasty center and a nicely spiced finish and a bit of surpising hop bitterness.

Notes of cherries and raisins came through in the flavor. The finish was fairly dry. The alcohol was at first not particularly noticeable, but as I went through the bottle the alcohol became more pronounced.

A light dusting of spices. A tad overly sweet in my opinion. Smooth mouthfeel with a lighter body. Drinkability would be helped by the sweetness being a bit more balanced but overall not bad.

The aroma has subtle roast malts, sweet malt aromas of figs, and ribbon candy, followed by just a hint of spice. The flavor delivers the sweet malt character first followed quickly by subtle hop fruitiness. The spice I caught on the nose is just barely there. A bit of tanginess shows on the finish.

Unaware, the actual brewmaster and owner of Allagash was standing right behind us and said ""nice choice, thats my beer!"" I thought the guy was blowing smoke up my ass, but he handed my friend his business card and thanked us for supporting him. So, needless to say, that was pretty cool. Now on the other hand, this beer is not so cool. I love allagash products and was shocked by this brew. The appearance isn't terrible. It was an opaque dark brown with a red glow in the light. The head was pretty small but held on for a little bit. The aroma was semi-sweet with malt and sugar hints. The taste was suprisingly off. It was beyond what I consider to be dry. My mouth immediately began to search for any remaining saliva to prevent total loss of all taste. The alcohol was very evident and came on strong along with the dryness. Now let me clarify, dryness is not always a bad factor, but this was just not a favorable presence. In order to finish it, I will have to struggle.

Hops are picked up more in the taste than in the nose. Soft carbonation gives it a creamy, almost chalky mouthfeel. Dark malts and candi sugar play into the vinous, yeasty character to create all kinds of fruitiness ranging from grape and currant to plum and passionfruit and finishing with a bit of spiciness, like clove. There's more dubbel characteristics, like chocolate, in the aroma than the taste. A good dubbel, with its own, unique character.","crookedhalo","Oct 06, 2004"

The label notes how much -- rather, how many varieties of -- malt was used in this beer, and you can tell. It's got some nice complexity to it.

It's kind of a WYSIWYG thing, delivering at face value, and that makes it drinkable, but I'd likely put the brakes on after one or two of these.

Nice spicy aroma with a tiny hint of citrus. Good mouthfeel. Not overly full - maybe a bit on the light side, yet it still goes down remarkably well. Nice spicy brew, yet theres also a good distinctive malt start that is bready and a bit yeasty. Becomes smoother when additional yeast is poured in from the bottle. Spices come in along with a prickly carbonation towards mid swallow and last through the finish. The malt is sweet but is never overly so or cloying.

Especially smooth on draught, but still a touch too thin on the palate. Fairly full-bodied, but loses some character as it reaches room temperature.

Definitely worth trying if found on draught.","Jon","Sep 04, 2003"

The flavor is exceptionally dry for a Belgian style Dubbel, although lacking the fruity undertones like a native Belgian this one has some very strong and prominent character to it. The flavor is nutty and coffee tinged with spice (coriander). Very satisfying this is and I find its hops come on strong in the end as well.

Taste is slightly harsh from the dark roasts but this nicely balanced brew throws in a wonderful hop bitterness earthy and pine cone tones with a syrupy sweet full flavor, another reason to bow down to Allagash as a premiere belgium style brewery. Mouthfeel is bubbly high in carbonation tickles the back of the throat goes great with meat and potatoes had some buffalo meatloaf and mashed potatoes paired with this awesome brew.

In the mouth, it's very fine carbonation lends a gentle caress to the tongue against its medium/light body. The flavor starts with an earthy malt as the spiciness tries to work it's way through.

True to the bottle's claim, the finish is very clean for such a malty, flavorful beer. Mouthfeel is decent, but not as memorable as other Allagash offerings. Drinkability is good, but this is a good one for me to have purchased one of. Too many other beers I like more to have more than one of these.

Aroma was a little disappointing, I was expecting a little more malt nose. First sip revealed surpressed candy sugar, caramel, and light fruit. Nice mouthfeel, but a little under carbonated. Slight ""tinny"" aftertaste. Lingering malt in the finish, not crisp or dry. Definitely better as it warmed. I will give the benefit of a doubt, and try next bottle after it has been out of the fridge for a while.","HopheadEd","Jan 05, 2003"
3.83,0.8,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Dark brown in color, big, fizzy creamy head. Aroma:very subtle and light, hints of cocoa and nuts, very smooth texture, soft palate. Medium body, good balance, not too forward, but, really? You want to know what I really like? The FORWARD beers, that's what! So if points are missing, it's because I feel that they're pulling back. For an ""Abbey Dubbel", I expect a bit more than what I find here. Very nice, very good, very tasty, but my socks are still on tight, thank you very much.","feloniousmonk","Dec 29, 2002"
4.2,10.5,4,4,4.5,4,4,"The taste was very impressive, complex with any element of the brew dominating the others. The traditional sweetness in this beer did not take that all to fatal step into cloying/raison sweetness that to me makes it hard to enjoy this style with food. The Allagash had a very crisp finish that left me wanting more. Very nice.","jackndan","Dec 26, 2002"
3.73,-1.8,4,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"The last of my Allagash stash at the bottom of the fridge. Very brown in color with little to no head at all. The smell is malt all the way with a hint of sweetness. The taste is again malt, much more sweetness and a hint of coffee. Something doesn't seem right here. Doesn't seem as balanced as it should be as the sweetness takes over too much. I am a little disappointed as the Grand Cru was amazing. I am no expert with this style and would like to try a different offering to see how each one is different.","CharlesRiver","Dec 23, 2002"
3.92,3.2,4,4.5,3.5,4,4,"Batch #33...as dark brown and opaque as you can get, big head, lots of bubble sizes -- one was as big as a ""cave"" in a raised glazed donut. Yeasty, bready aromas, nice astringent muskiness. Surprisingly light and spritzy, burnt raisins, slight citrus, a bite of coffee and a mid-mouth sense of bitter hops. I liked this brew and its resemblance to Belgian funk in the aroma. The malts were a little mediciny bitter and unidimensional, sweeter complexity would place it in Unibroue territory. As it is, I'll probably move on to try some other Allagash brews.","ADR","Dec 05, 2002"
3.7,-2.6,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"In the glass it pours a dark reddish/brown color. The head was a cream color and left a lace that clinged to the sides (like spiderman). The aroma was generally a fruit smell. Like lemons, and some malt. In the taste flavors of the lemon (fruit) were apparent. It had low tones of wheat (bread) and malt as well. Flavorful/strong. There was no apparent flavor of alcohol which surprised me after I found out that it was high in it.","Jarod","Nov 25, 2002"
4.2,10.5,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Allagash is an underrated brewery and this is an underrated dubbel. As far as quality US produced versions of Belgian brews, Allagash is at the top of the heap, alongside Ommegang and New Belgium, perhaps even surpassing them. This is a sugary dubbel that pours with a huge frothy head and enticing aroma of wood and grasses. Big caramel bite with sugar, lemon, and spice flavors. Subtle finish, a big blast of sugar; as beer mellows in glass, becomes more wine-like and slippery, almost watery. Best enjoyed alongside a hearty meal; on its own it can be too candylike. Had a thick beef stew with this and it was incredible. Burgers, steak, lamb, this beer will go with them all. Could conceivably go with dessert as well. Perfect for the budget-minded Belgian lover.","Thrasher","Oct 30, 2002"
3.8,0,4,4,3.5,4,4,"Nicely drinkable beer but not a favorite of the Belgian styles or even the Allagash brews.","MaineBeerMan","Oct 08, 2002"
4.03,6.1,4.5,4,4,4,4,"A tan medium sized head quickly disappeared with little lace. Cloudy dark brown color with active carbonation. Heavy honey and raisin like aroma. Carbonation hits the mouth hard but quickly retreats. Sweet dark malty taste dominants until a nice light bitter finish.Drinkability? ok, but it seems batch #26 could be very interesting after some maturing. I'll defintely get some for later.","paceyourself","Oct 05, 2002"
3.32,-12.6,2.5,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"pour vigourously to give about 1/4 inch head, which almost instantly died leaving a thin ring. think amber/light brownish color which i was unable to see through clearly. smell was high in alcohol and malt. cold : earthy malt with just the slightest hint of hop kick. good tart. sweet and simi-thick mouthfeel. medium bodied. warm :  malt. malt malt. slightly roasted, slightly floral","Myk","Sep 17, 2002"
3.3,-13.2,3.5,3.5,3,2.5,4,"Garnet in hue w/ a light haze, topped by a head that quickly recedes into a thin ring that manages to leave lace.  The understated aroma is comprised of bubblegum esters, hints of chocolate and unripe fruit esters.  Light and pleasant butterscotch surfaces as the beer breathes.  Surprisingly, a whiff of solvent - like fusel alcohol emerges, and is unusual considering the relatively low strength.  Although absent aromawise, clove asserts itself in flavor and is the dominant yeast derived characteristic.  Esters are subdued, with very subtle bubblegum discernible.  The malt profile consists of raisiny Special B and hints of biscuit, but is unremarkable otherwise.  Thin in body, and borderlining on watery. Hop bitterness is a bit above the norm for style and when coupled w/ the well attenuated, dry finish, the overall balance is left askew.  Allagash Double is enjoyable, but unremarkable. It's reminescent of an American brown ale fermented with a Trappist Ale yeast.  Although not an outstanding dubbel, it is quite a drinkable stylistic hybrid.","marc77","Aug 29, 2002"
4.36,14.7,5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"As a note:  I picked up the only two bottles I could find (traded one, kept one and planned to age it).  Out of the blue, a friend dropped by with an addtional bottle (same batch) as a gift.  He knows little of beer, just that I like to try ""different stuff"".  Is that harmonic convergence or what?  The other bottle will be cellared.","cokes","Aug 26, 2002"
3.78,-0.5,4.5,4,3.5,3.5,4,"This beer poured a very dark reddish amber color and formed a small bubbly white head that left only a small amount of lace.  An aroma of malt and spice and a touch of caramel.  The flavor was of malt, a hit of caramel and spice that vanished quickly. Also a hint of the alcohol in the aroma and taste.  The finish was very light and dry and void of of any of the tastes and aroma before.  I was hesistant to try this due to what I heard about it.  While not a bad of beer as others have said, it is not as good as some of their other beers and weak for it's style.  But a good beer, if not outstanding, nontheless.","Wildman","Jul 28, 2002"
3.77,-0.8,3.5,4,4,4,3,"Pours with a vigorous light tan head with healthy Belgian lace clinging to the glass. Nice medium-brown with red highlights, once all settles down. Sweet nose with fruitiness from the yeast...and candi sugar perhaps? Very nice indeed! Taste...ahhh the taste, pinpoint effervescence makes this go down smooth. A great combination of malt sweetness mixed with notes of coffee detected, with some alcohol coming thru backed by a quiet hop bitterness. A super easy-drinking Dubbel, one of the great American interpretations of a classic Belgian style.","beerluvr","Jul 27, 2002"
4.32,13.7,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"I gave this one a second chance from a tap.  The previous six-pack was definitely abused because the tapped stuff was awesome.  Had a nice fruity aroma and the brew was not at all too yeasty.  The flavor was rich and refreshing.","beernut7","Jul 25, 2002"

4.58,20.5,5,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,"Wow smell the cork... its like a sweet hop field in your hand.  Sweet (candi sugar) nose with hops.  Rich brown/ruby look in the goblet with a tan head.  The head is dense creamy and lasting ... and lasting... and lasting...  Very smooth silk mouth and also in the initial taste.  Subtile smooth well rounded taste of sweet roasted malt,flavor with hints of chocolate and a slight hop bitterness in the finish.  A little more hops than the style would dictate but I love hops and this is an awesome dubble for my taste.  An awesome American product!  Wonderfill retention to the end.  This is the best Dubble I've had in a long time.  If you find it buy two.. one to drink and one to cellar.  Bravo Allagash!","frank4sail","Jul 11, 2002"
4.1,7.9,4,4,4,4,4.5,"Batch #17.  Based on other's reviews, it seems this beer varies from batch to batch.  Mine poured with low carbonation, small head.  Light sweet malt, raisiny aroma.  Hit the mouth spritzy, which was odd given the low carbonation in the glass.  Nice fruity flavors with notes of caramel and rasins.  Very little yeast presence, in fact the yeast was pretty well packed and only with a good amount of agitation did I get some in my last glass.  Overall, it was a light style Dubbel, albeit extremely smooth and drinkable, making for a good summer-time Belgian ale.","pbrian","May 02, 2002"
3.26,-14.2,4.5,3.5,3,3.5,3,"Batch #24. This brew is impressive in appearance. Unfortunately that's where it ends. Maybe batch 24 is too young. Extremely high carbonation level. In fact I thought the high carbonation masked much of the flavor for the first half of the bottle. Once the brew warmed and some of the carbonation dissipated, more of the flavors shone through. I detected the typical dubbel flavors, though a bit subdued, raisins, prunes a touch of alcohol and even a bit of vanilla, cinnamon, chocolate and some nuttiness. I can think of many other dubbels I'd prefer over this one. Can't understand how this has a higher average rating than Ommegang. Maybe I should get another bottle and lay it down awhile.","John","Apr 26, 2002"
2.71,-28.7,3.5,2.5,2.5,3,3,"Bought a six of this upon a recommendation.  It turned out to be less than I had anticipated.  The head was weak with little complexity in the nose and had a cloudy, medium brown appearance.   The body was weak with some hop bitterness and a strong, but dry yeast flavor which was really not appealing, plus some noticeable alcohol.  Where is this sweetness that I had heard about?  I was really dissappointed.  Maybe I got ahold of a bad batch.  Unfortunely, I will not be giving this one a second try.","DrewS","Apr 18, 2002"
4.32,13.7,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"I had a bottle of Batch # 24 with Easter Dinner. Took the beer advocates advice and tried to introduce beer at family dinners rather than wine. This is nice brown amber color, thick foamy head that quickly settled down. I had the glass with yeast poured on top. Nice yeast aroama and great taste. Maybe a little thin in the palate, slightly more watery than I expected. I had a bottle at christmas time I thought was a little better. Overall a really good beer for special dinners.","StevieW","Apr 01, 2002"
3.97,4.5,3.5,4,4,4,4,"Notes: Allagash seems to be giving the Belgians a run for their money ... very drinkable for such a complex and big beer. An amazing American brewed dubbel. Great with grilled steaks, steamed asparagus and roasted new potatoes.","Jason","Jan 20, 2002"
4.06,6.8,5,4,4,4,4,"Have had this beer twice.  The first time it had a great maltiness that begged you to drink more.  The second time (with a different batch number) the big maltiness was gone and was replaced with a lighter-bodied, less flavorful brew.  The inconsistency rates it lower.","DrDocRudge","Aug 28, 2001"
