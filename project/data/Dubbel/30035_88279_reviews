"Not a dubbel, belgian dark ale."
""
""
""
""
"Pours an opaque, deep amber (with a decidedly red hue) brown producing a huge to the point of being difficult to pour, tightly bubbled foam, beige, moderately lived head that leaves minimal lacing. Aroma is malty with notes of grape,  dried apple, honey, spice, earthy/floral hops, Belgian funk & a vinous hint. There is little of the dark fruit character I associate with the style. Taste is Belgian malt, sugary dark bread, fig, raisins, soured fruit, a hint of honey, brown sugar, grass, earth, alcohol & a little Belgian funk finishing with pepper & spice. Aftertaste is malty, earthy & bittersweet with an alcohol prominence that fades to a faint bitter astringency. Again little of the dark fruit character I associate with the style. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with lively carbonation, spicy, crisp & dry late in the sip."

"Overall: I tend to put Trappist beers into their own category. While the intent is to brew a good beer, it's not the primary purpose of the brewers. Given the beers are a byproduct of another process, and the consumption of them donates not to crass commercialism but to worship and self sacrifice, I tend to enjoy the beers more than just because of their flavor. If this was just another beer, I doubt I would revisit it. As it is a Trappist beer, I'll gladly get another when I get the chance."

"Nice beer.  One that I would have again happily"
"Hazy orange colour, with a small head that fades soon, leaving a non compact lace. Smell of dark fruits, honey, and lemon. Medium body, creamy and sticky palate. Good carbonation. Taste of dark fruits,  hoeny, lemon is more perceptible. Good, but not near the best trappist beers."

"I wish I could say I loved this, being born in Austria and all, but I can only say I like it."
""
""
"It's brewed by monks and out of Austria. Benno is a solid beer as it stands, though in my opinion doesn't quite hit the lofty expectations of set by other trappists."
""
"O: This beer is very interesting. Even though I disagree with it being a Saison - I'm not sure I would label it that way - it is refreshing to a certain extent. It has a lot of dubbel characteristics, the maltiness, yeastiness, lot of Belgian hints and the spiciness. Very good brew. (4)"

"    I really like tasting this beer too. It has a fuller body that’s light on its feet, I find the texture to be really silky. Underneath that silk are some wonderful flavors of honeyed cereal, toffee, caramel, grapefruit, stone fruits, with a bitter grassy hop ever present through the long flavorful finish. I say that if you are looking for a good beer for your smoked Gouda, you found your beer. Do your self a favor and enjoy this little beauty."

"O: My first from this new to the scene Trappist beer producing brewery.  I’ve now tried brews from all 8 of Trappist breweries, and this is the only one I’ve not travelled to.  A year ago I’d heard that it would be impossible to try beers from there aside from actually travelling to Austria to try it.  I was so glad to have found two from this brewery in the US.  It really is a well done brew.  It is listed as a saison, and yes I can see that.  It is unique and has some Belgian triple qualities.   Bought in Asheville, drank in New Hamburg, ON Aug 22nd, 2014."

"330 ml bottle. Pours hazy golden with tall, long-lasting, foamy, off-white head and nice lacing. Aroma is of barnyard yeast, bready malt, caramel and fruity esters. Body is full and slightly crisp. Funky yeast, spices, caramel malt, bread crust, tobacco, woody notes, herbal hops and ripe fruit fill the mouth. Finish is long and dry. Nice, complex brew."
"Overall - Again, love the use of honey. This may be the only saving grace when it comes to this recently dubbed ""Trappist"" ale. Not much to rave about here given the status of a brewery like this. Would never go out of my way to find this. Fairly boring, fairly bland. Other standout Saisons in this style that FAR supersede this are the Hennepin, Saison De Dottignies by De Ranke, Saison Dupont, or The Bruery's Saison Rue."

"Pours dark amber brown with fluffy peaked head. Smells of plum and raisin with sweet malts. Nice lacing on glass with fruit flavors of plum and raisins, sour cherries, and light sweet bread from the Belgian yeast strain, light bitterness on aftertaste with Belgian candy sugar in the back. Not the best I have had of the Trappist beers but very solid and very drinkable."
""
"O: Drinks like a less intense (though slightly more bitter) double. Would certainly recommend."

"330ml bottle. Het Kappitel Chalice glass. Orangish amber color, chill haze appearance. Beige close fairly quickly diminish. Crystal, dat, cane sugar, grape & slight acidic aromas, as well as toffee, floral & vanilla notes on the back. Sweet fruit, citric notes & touches of quince & raw plum. Medium body. Moderate carbonation. Spicy & spiced palate. Dense texture. Earthy, sour notes & hints of wood linger into a bitter/sweet finish. Fruit on the aftertaste. Worth to try!! A far away one from usual Trappist bier styles."

"Not a bad beer in and of itself but certainly my least favorite of the Trappist ales"
"More bitter than expected. The yeast esters are pleasant, as is the pepper and clove, but bitterness lingers more than I prefer."
"O: modestly enjoyable but highly interesting. ABV mostly hidden in the nose, but not in the mouth"

"This was my first taste of an Engelszell Beer. It falls short of the refreshing, grounded nature I expect from a Saison, but it is still enjoyable. The initial pour left yeast in the bottle. The second pour included yeast which cut out the sharp aromas and flavors, as well as metallic notes. Yeast definitely improves the overall profile of this beer."
""
""
"Hazy light brown colored beer with a half inch of tightly woven khaki colored head. Brussels lacing. I get the aroma of light earthy malt and honey. The initial taste is sweet earthy malt and is quickly followed by a candidate sugar like kick and then more gently sweet malt. The body is moderately carbonated and fairly dry."
""
"A good ale, but not indicative of quality Belgian saisons or unique interprrtations of such. Still, a worthwhile effort."
""
""
""
""

"Overall, a nice Trappist beer and different from the other ones out there. There is a lot of bubblegum in this one but it really seems to work. A nice, unique beer that is worth picking up if you come across it."

"330 ml bottle into chalice, bottled in 3/2013. Pours very hazy/cloudy deep orange copper color with a 1 finger dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty foamy lacing clings on the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of orange peel, apple, pear, grape, clove, pepper, coriander, honey, caramel, toast, bread, herbal, floral, grass, and yeast earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance and complexity of fruity/spicy yeast ester, honey, and malt notes; with solid strength. Taste of orange peel, apple, grape, pear, honey, clove, pepper, coriander, herbal, floral, grass, caramel, toast, bread, and yeast earthiness. Large amount of lightly tart and crisp spiciness on the finish; with lingering notes of orange peel, pear, apple, grape, honey, clove, pepper, coriander, caramel, toast, bread, herbal, floral, grass, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a while. Very nice balance and complexity of malt, honey, fruity/spicy yeast flavors; with a crisp malt/spiciness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a lightly slick, crisp, and moderately prickly mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very good saison style. Good balance and complexity of malt, honey, and fruity/spicy yeast flavors; and quite smooth and crisp to sip on. A nicely enjoyable offering."

"Overall, a really nice refreshing yet balanced beer with flavor."
"OVERALL: Not sure I'd classify this as a saison, unless they used saison yeast of course. Much more a Belgian pale ale to me. This was actually pretty nice, with some light honey components and some good yeasty flavors as well. Give it a try if you get the chance. Thanks again Doops!"

"A decent enough dark saison, everything displaying an air of subtle complexity, and the dryness is more than palpable. Something different for a Trappist brewery to put out, that isn't some form of a malt-forward Belgian dark ale. Interesting, but other than trying a new monk-brewed beer, this one doesn't quite have me reaching for another."
""
"O: This one is very rough on the palate. Calling it a saison is a bit of a stretch too. I don't know what it is, but I've never had a saison leave a sticky, syrupy malt coating in my mouth. No cohesion at all. Easily the least enjoyable Trappist ale I've had to date."
"Overall a really nice beer and I'm glad I got to try it. Nothing that rocked my world, but I'd drink this again."

"Overall: this is a pretty decent beer, but not a wonderful one. Worth trying if you are a fan of the style, but otherwise you can probably skip it."

"O: Good drinkability. Nice Saison. Better than the Gregorius one"
"Poured into a Nostradamus flute glass. Pours a clear, medium coppery amber with a half finger white head that dissipates to thin persistent film. Aroma of caramel malt, sweet stone fruit, coriander, Belgian and lighter saison style yeast. Flavor is semi-dry bready malt, saison yeast, light citrus, earthy and bitter spicing. Dry bread crust finish with residual bitterness that tastes more like dry earthy spices than hops. Medium bodied with peppery carbonation. A nice example of a Belgian style farmhouse ale, with both dry saison components and Belgian spicing. The honey element is not noticeable in the taste, but may contribute to the fact that this isn't a very dry ale. The earthy spicing is unusual and rewarding."
"This is a complex beer that fits very well in the Saison category rather than the light Dubbel as it was labelled for some time. I cannot stop smelling it, getting waves and waves of different aromas. The taste is surprisingly sour which makes it interesting as well as tasty. All in all much better than the Gregorius and in its sourness unique in Austria. I am very excited to find out if they keep the sour touch or mainstream it in the following batches."
""
""
"O: A delicious Saison. I tried the Gregorian last night and promised to review both..I'm a sucker for Saisons and this one is top notch. BUT the Gregorian is more unique with its midnight plum/raisin. I would recommend the Gregorian over this one, although both are great."
""
"Overall not too bad but on the lower end of the Trappist family."
""
""
"O-I am glad to have tried this brew. It is a unique a tasty drink, but I'm not sure it qualifies as a proper saison. At times, I felt like I was drinking BDSA, with the hints of dark fruit and honey playing against the clove spices. Anyway, although it is tough to categorize, this brew is good and I would happily drink it again. A good early fall option."
""
""
""
""
""
"The taste starts out with a brown sugar sweetness, malty, and with some nice deep spices but then it evolves into a musty lingering finish. While this is not a bad beer it really smells and taste like a dank, dark cellar. But perhaps that's the point."
""
""
""
""
"Flavor is rich and thick. Somewhat noticable grain tone. Definitely honey going on here. Probably a little too hearty in that it could use its edges smoothed out. Not too shabby a drinker. Could use the wrinkles ironed out for sure though."
"Drinkability : a good beer in the style Belgian Ale."
""
""
""
"D: This was a decent saison, with nice scent and taste, but nothing special. The body was pretty weak, and the finish wasn't the smoothest, so not super easy to drink. An average brew, and really not impressive for a trappist."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a fairly nice blend of flavors. My first impression was not great, as its grainy-ness is a little reminiscent of some macro beers, but there's more going on and it's better than my initial reaction. Worth a try."
""
"Pours a murky honey orange with a foamy orange-white head that settles to a small cap on top of the beer. Foamy swaths of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, spice, yeast, and slight fruity aromas. Taste is much the same with spice and yeast flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of spice bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer with some solid aromas and flavors for the style."
""
""
""
"O: Nice clean easy going Saison. I noticed that the label said the beer is brewed with honey. I didn't get any traditional mead flavors, but it's probably too delicate to stand up to the more roasted flavors in the beer. It is very enjoyable to drink."
""
""
"Overall – An alright dubbel but nothing too out of the ordinary here in my opinion."
"O: This is an interesting beer that seems to taste like it is a hybrid of a saison, bière de garde and a dubbel."
""
"Far more bitter than the smell would indicate. Starts with a sour and nearly dry malt up front. The swallow is nearly astringent with a bitter kick. The aftertaste has some of that cherry show up again, a bit flowery, but it leans to the bitter. Full bodied with a low carbonation level."
""
""
""
"Overall: This is good new entry into the world of Trappist beers. Sorta a Saison, but the fuller fruit and honey notes make this a little more distinctive."
"O: A nice beer, not mindblowing in any way but highly enjoyable. It's great to have a Farmhouse style beer in the Trappist stable and I'm happy to welcome our newest Trappist brewery to my experience base."
""
"Benno is a wonderfully crafted ale that compares very favorably when considered in the likes of Unibroue Maudite and De Koninck Ale. It simply belongs in the portfolio of time honored Trappistine history, regal, spirit and taste."
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured into a glass mug. The beer pours hazy copper with a finger-length white head and lots of tiny, visible bubbles. The head sticks around for a while and retains well throughout consumption. The beer smells like lemon, Belgian yeast funk, sweet and bready malt, and coriander. The beer has a nice malt profile that's evidenced in the taste, being nice and bready with some sweetness. I get the lemon and coriander as well as some earthy hop bitterness in the back end. The body is medium with lively carbonation. The finish is dry and the aftertaste coats the mouth. This is a nice drinking beer. This is an excellent beer."
""
""
""
"Meh."
""
"Pours amber with golden highlights capped by a fluffy white head. Great retention and plenty of lacing along the sides of the glass. Plenty of yeast, on the nose, however different and not as strong as the the saison/farmhouse yeast found in most saisons. The honey does come through as well as hay, and some malt touched by a bit of toffee. Yeasty, caramel, honey maltiness, a light touch of citrus throughout. Smooth mouthfeel, light, medium bodied with moderate to low carbonation-much lower than most saisons I've had. A very interesting and enjoyable beer. Well worth a try."
"O: Benno is a solidly made beer, in spite of some bumpy areas. Drinkable."
""
"Big, proper taste with an approacable abv. Complexities that I expect from a Trappist ale.I have two remaining... going to start looking for more...Gregorius is next"
""
""
"O – This is a great beer and maybe my favorite saison that I’ve had so far. It looks fantastic, is very tasty, has great depth of flavor, and has a tremendous creamy mouthfeel. Awesome beer from the newest Trappist brewery. I can’t wait to see what beer number 2 from them has to offer."
"Overall this is really solid, and wonderfully balanced also. It's also very unique tasting. This a great execution for a trappist beer, I am getting more from these guys if I can."
"Overall: Interesting, tasty, and well worth a try. Somewhere between an Orval and a Belgian Saison in terms of flavor profile. Certainly good enough to pick up again."
