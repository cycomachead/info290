The flavor followed suit with plenty of raisin and plum flavors making for a very tasty drink.  Belgian yeast flavor, candi sugar, malts, and fruity alcoholic esters.  Damn fine dubbel ale here and at a low price point.  Medium bodied well carbonated ale.  This could easily win an award in the Belgian style dubbel category.  Very, very nice.","Stinkypuss","Dec 17, 2014"

Pours moderately murky deep ruby red color with a 1 finger dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big raisin, prune, cherry, fig, apple, caramel, toast, molasses, brown sugar, brown bread, light chocolate, clove, pepper, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of fruity/earthy yeast and dark/bready malt sweetness; with good strength. Taste of raisin, prune, cherry, fig, apple, caramel, molasses, toast, brown sugar, brown bread, light chocolate, light clove, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Light herbal/earthy spice on the finish; with lingering notes of raisin, prune, cherry, fig, apple, caramel, molasses, toast, brown sugar, bread bread, light chocolate, light clove, herbal, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice complexity and robustness of fruity/earthy yeast and dark/bready malt flavors; with a nice malt/yeast balance and no cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth and fairly creamy/slick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with zero warming present after the finish. Overall this was a very nice dubbel style. All around good balance, robustness, and complexity of dark/bready malt and fruity/earthy yeast flavors; and very smooth to sip on. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Jul 19, 2014"

Some spicy coriander flavors and touch of dryness. But the taste was still very solid and enjoyable, if not a tiny bit different from many others in this style. Not always a bad thing.

4,7.5,4,4,4,4,4,"Have had this brew in the fridge for a number of months and thought I would give a try today. Brew pours to a russet brown color with a thick light tan head that has amazing retention but lust only slight lacing. The aromas of this brew are inviting, nice malt smell wrapped around a core yeast smell. Some fruit smells give off the idea of sweetness though with a little alcohol. Also in the mix is a nice spice aroma. The taste is quite good as well very malty up front giving a slight toasted like flavor. Slight caramel flavor wrapped in with the toasted flavors. Very good carbonation which plays with the hop presence to tingle the back of the mouth. Surprisingly easy to drink, IMO a very good brew. While I am not sure I would go looking for this as it is not so outstanding that I would really remember it, I would be happy to have another.","Stimack","May 09, 2008"
2.64,-29,2.5,3.5,2.5,2.5,2,"This beer poured with nearly zero head. And yeast clumps were rampant despite leaving a bit in the bottom of the bottle. There is a nice spicy aroma from this beer, but perhaps subdued due to know head with popping bubbles adding to the pungency. First taste seems to be a bit on the watery side, but does lend a slight spicy/yeast balance...but unfortunately it's seems off in the distance. Again the watery taste also reflects in the mouthfeel and it just seems too light for a dubbel which is the top of the styles I like. Due to the lackluster experience, the drinkability suffers as well.","BeerAngel","Mar 22, 2008"

Floral as well. Taste is similar- this is a malt bomb. Ther is a bit of woodiness and some more of the floral honey notes. A bit sweet and light for a dubbel.

Definite chocolate maltiness. Everything is great except for the fact that it tastes watered down. There isn't a full, rich flavor, although the flavor is nice.

Mountains of lace amid a medium level of carbonation. Aromas of malts, nuts, berries, earth, dough and sweet grain are present. Taste was not as intense as the smell, but still quaffable. Flavors of mild spices, dough, grains and sweet tea. Not bad. Mouthfeel was accentuated by the appropriate level of carbonation, making for a nice edium bodied brew. Decent drinkability. This brew simply lacked enough flavor for me. Worth a try, but there are better examples of the style.","Frozensoul327","Nov 05, 2005"

First taste is malty, somewhat breadlike, with a plum fruitiness. Bitterness is a little higher than most dubbels but well within the style, with a piney, resinous hop flavor. Finishes simple and fairly clean. Neutral texture with a moderate body. Really, a fairly ordinary Belgium beer, simple and uncomplex, but still drinkable.","allengarvin","Oct 05, 2005"

There was some caramel and fruity undertones but there also seemed to be a sour medicinal flavor in there, yuck. The finish was dry and chalky, not really enjoyable.

A two inch thick off-white head formed rapidly, and then receded to a quarter inch line of foam. There were lots of yeast floaters around. The aroma was sweet-sour reminiscent of honey and caramel with faint and distant hops. Tastes like it smelled, sweet, yeasty, and malty with hints of chocolate, plums, and toffee.

The aroma offers juicy dark fruit amidst a candyish sweetness; backed by a delicate caramelish malt and subtle spiciness. The flavor follows suit with some additional candyish sugariness and more spice, and the malt reveals a gently toasted character in addition to its caramelized sugars. It's very well balanced, and the alcohol is nicely cloaked. The body is medium with a very fine carbonation that gives it a lightly tingly, creamy mouthfeel; and it finishes with a gently lingering sweet maltiness that fades to reveal some spice and bitterness, leaving the palate refreshed and ready for another sip.

The color is a deep amber, with a very white head for the style and, nice Belgian lacing. The aroma is sweet and candy like, although not cloying. As already noted, the taste is driven by sweetness of the malts, and perhaps a wee bit too much rock sugar. It is lacking that blazing alcohol warmth that so many of its cousins in the style have. All in all, it is probably a poor example of the style, but I like it, damn me to beer geek hell, I like it.","jackndan","Dec 03, 2003"

Herbal hops also present in taste, and are a bit astringent. Something is a little off in the finish, A slight chalkiness left on the tongue. Feels good drinking, but declines with the swallow.

I also noticed that this beer seemed to have good carbonation as the bubbles could be seen through the clear liquid. The aromas that came from this beer were of caramel, malts, fruits, hops, flowers, fresh grass, some spices and a slice of bread. All these seemed to come out after each sip, some more pronounced then others and some not until the end. The tastes were of hops, caramel, dried flowers, sweet malt, fruit – fresh and sour – and a yeasty bread flavor, which was slight.

Initially, the nose seemed a pronounced, armpit-like odor that was not good, but as you drink and the aromas seperate, you notice the earthiness of it, the connection to something foreign.
