"Just not my style of beer"
"D: Good drinkability and solid for style.  A pleasant surprise."
"One of my favorite beers."
""
""
""
""
"Overall:  I found this beer to be delicious and was a perfect accompaniment to my family’s Easter dinner.  It’s got great toasted malt, dried stone fruit, spice, funk and hops flavors in a great balance that kept me coming back for more.  Recommended."
"This was a fantastic beer. It came in a can which is great to reduce light absorption. The beer was extremely flavorful but not overpowering and had a nice finish."

"O) A tasty dubbel. If I had another can I'd drink it!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Okay for the style."
""
""
"O/D - A decent Dubbel. Complex and hits the requisite flavour notes, but doesn't go to crazy. Nice."

"O: one of the more well-made domestic dubbels I've had -"

" The flavor has an element of fruit with semi-spicy yeast giving the ale more of a light taste with toasted grain taste in the background. The flavor has fruity yeast with an herbal tinge of hops perhaps, but the malt is lacking in this for my taste. Overall not a bad beer but if you want a dubbel more representative of the style there are better options, the drinkability is good overall."
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured from a can into a tulip. Pours deep light red with a nice white head. Smells of berries and Belgian yeast, berries dominant. Tastes of sweet grain with hints of berries nice balance. Beer is carbonated nicely light body goes down smooth. Overall an above average beer."
""
""
"Overall, a slightly light dubbel, maybe headed towards saison dryness more so than dubbel sweetness and yeastiness."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"D: besides the slight metallic notes, this is a pretty good dubbel. good sweetness, fruitiness. not too shabby."
""
""
"O- an enjoyable Dubbel and a good effort on an American attempt of the style"
""
""
""
""
"O: This is a solid American take on a Belgian dubbel. It grew on me a bit as I drank it, but it never wowed me. It seemed a bit scattered compared to some of the better versions of the style, but it was still enjoyable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: really a great beer from this brewery and now I really want to try more of their beers."

"Overall: I guess I had high expect ions coming into this beer. It was good, don't get me wrong, but for this style, I guess I was expecting something out of this world when it comes to my beer palate. It did have a smooth, creamy body that went down nice and hid the alcohol well. I would try again, only if it were on tap since I would love to have another experience from a different side. I would recommend to a friend who isn't familiar with the genre but looking to expand. I would recommend at least a bottle. Cheers!"
""
"Overall - I was shocked at how well crafted this beer was made and its taste. It's absolutely worth trying. I'll be looking for this one again many times to come."
""
""
""
"Overall- A pretty nice dry and warming dubbel, which all the while still maintains a nice fruit flavor profile. Although it is a bit on the boozy and biting side at the end of the taste, it is still rather enjoyable to drink. Worth a try if you have the opportunity."
"All in all, a Maryland brew to be proud of."
""
""

"O – Classifying this beer as a Double doesn't do it justice. It's unquestionably off-style for a double, but it's unquestionably delicious. I'd be much happier calling it an ""American Double""; a lighter, hoppier version of it's Belgian cousin - and to that end I'd argue that it was brewed perfectly to-style lol. No matter how you label it though, it's a fantastic brew. This one took me totally by surprise and I was quite happily blown away."
""
""
""
""
""
"It's just an okay beer, really. Doesn't taste contrived. After letting it warm up and become fully-realized, I can admit that it's right in the ballpark, after all. A uniquely dry dubbel, and out of a can, no less."

"Notes: Recommended to me by the Mid-Atlantic Brewery News Baltimore correspondent, Alexander Mitchell, while we were waiting in line on 2012-12-12 for the special release of Westvletereen XII."

"Really cool to see a Belgian beer in a can, judgment still out on how this will hold up with Belgian beer fans. Appearance had a cherry red raisin color with a slight blood orange hue. clarity was minimal. a big off white head that dissipated somewhat quickly in the glass. The aroma was full of dark candi sugar sweetness. some toffee notes, some dark fruit notes (def. cherry) with a slight citrus and caramel aroma as well. The flavor is not exactly the same though, Some raisin notes perk up in the front. the middle seems to present the moderately strong dark sugar character that is similar in the nose. the mouthfeel i feel is a bit in the middle for a Belgian style ale. it could either finish quicker or hang out but transits while it hangs around. I believe this to be a sessionable style Belgian beer with a higher than average ABV. its aroma really did it for me and the interesting coffee acridness which i am probably confusing for a higher than average hoppyness combined with the malt character is actually very enjoyable."
""
""
"The beer appeared a nice, clear, dark ruby red color that produced a nice white head that left a thin cap. The beer gave off a nice sweet aroma with hints of yeast and sugar. The beer had a really good taste to it. I have to admit, that the style is not my favorite, but I have to say that this is probably the best of the bunch that I have tried. Sweet maltiness with hints of sugar. A hint of alcohol is ever so noticeable. The beer had a nice moderate feel to it with nice carbonation and a dry finish. Overall, a very good beer, with no let down from the one that I tried from a can. I will have this beer again the next time that I am in Baltimore."
"Not bad with many traditional Dubbel characteristics just not as pronounced as some of its style counterparts."
"D - Everything but the taste of this dubbel is a winner, it is just too bitter."
""
""
""
""
"D - A bit bland for a dubbel. The yeast character is mild and the malt is not quite as dark as I would expect it to be for the style. Just not much going on here."
"Overall: its definitely very drinkable, its just not very flavorful. almost like a watered down dubbel."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"However not a bad brew at all; I wish the feel had been a little smoother, because the aroma and taste are both quite nice."
""
""
"Ressurection comes to me looking pretty standard doubleish with a dark brown bordering on red kinda like a maroon color with a cream tan shaded head that sat on top leaving minor ticks on the glass. Nice looking up towards the light. Smell is real bready, a deep dark bread, not overly yeasty like most. Smells of caramel, and plums with raisin plus others. A very good dubble here, better than most american versions I've had recently. Dark fruits plus plums with dark bread. Some faint cherry notes and a touch of chocolate. Some banana and hefeweizen tastes. Feel is a step down from medium and is a tad thin, but that makes this even more drinkable. I finished a 12oz and contemplated getting more, for a style that's not my priority. Get a hold of this stuff."
""
"Poured a reddish brown with decent head on top of a spicey and sweet malt (def some sugar) aroma, complete with a touch of yeast and orange found in Belgians. Not as sweet as the smell, nor does it have pronounced fruit flavors but overall there is a good citric/orange fruit quality with a sweet vibe. Beer is medium bodied and goes down easy with a nice little kick at the end and you can sorta feel the booze as you keep sipping. A pretty good ale and def worth a try if your in the Baltimore area."
""
""
""
""
"As far as the can version of this beer goes, don't fret. There is quality inside the can too. It's not that often you find a Belgian style Dubbel in a can, so credit to Brewer's Art for taking a chance."

"O- This is a bad beer, tastes like a macro-lager with a bit more malt, never again."
""
""
"O: I really enjoyed this brew – had it on tap awhile ago – and this was just as good from the bottle if not better."
"Overall - A decent enough Dubbel, but perhaps the real magic is putting a Belgian-style ale in a can (something I'd love to see more of)!"
"Fairly pleased with this brew. Have tried brew of similar style, body has been thin or taste is astringent, common Dubbel flaws. This one is slightly over carbonated, which could be attributed to the age. Would put this on par with proper Belgian Dubbels. Would get this one again. Wanted to save longer but glad with the result."

"o - overall, who woulda thunk it...a dubble...from a can! i love canned beer, but this is a style that it seems the canning hurts it. would love to try this from tap or perhaps a bottle, to see if the canning of a dubble just doesn't work, as i suspect."
""
""
"pours a light brown with mahogany(ish) highlights and a just-off-white head that hangs out for a while. nose is dark fruits (raisin, plum, date), caramel, malt sweet and spice. taste follows the nose, translating in balance, and with a touch of mustiness. medium body with lower than what i expected carbonation-wise. i think i needed more umph and a little more carbonation to carry things through. spice and must in the finish. minimal alcohol. good beer from one of the forerunners in the belgo-us trend."
""
""
""
"O - I loved the pour from this can but I can't say the same for the beer...a classic, middle-of-the-road Dubbel...I like seeing a Belgian style beer in a can though!"

"One of the few beers in this style brewed in the US where I could distinctly pick out the tasting elements brought in by the malts, hops and yeast. In most of these one or two dominate and the malts or the hops are typically relegated to mouthfeel duty without bringing any additional flavors."
"Tastes moderate malt sweet supporting dominant fruity esters. Nice candi-sugar adds depth, as does a spicy belgian yeast zip. Phenols are present, but muted and overpowered by the malt and esters. Malt tastes lightly of chocolate and gently toasted bread. Esters (which dominate the palate) are pear, green raisin, crisp-style apple, and green grape. Finish is a bit musty and weedy which dries is out with a lingering edginess. Light, yet somehow chewy, in the mouth with way too much carbonation. Has a concerning stomach heartburn, which suggest to me, some sort of contaminant microbe. I give this one a 'meh'."
"12oz. can courtesy of Soonami (thanks Mike). Served in my DT tulip at 53 degrees. Pours a hazy mahogany with a latte-like, 1.5 inch cream-colored head embedded with craters. Head eventually dissipates into a bull's eye dollop in the center and a frothy band around the edges. Spots and slashes of lacing are exposed during the tasting and exhibit excellent retention. Nose expresses dark vinous fruits, yeast and an earthy character. Taste consistent with nose; however, there is also a pleasant herbal quality and a light sweetness. Finish expresses a slight metallic tinge. Mouthfeel is medium-light in body with a pleasant, even carbonation and a touch of acidity. Overall, a very good American Dubbel. I definitely will need to try some more form this brewer. Well worth your time if you appreciate the style and have the opportunity to try it."
"O – Classifying this beer as a Double doesn't do it justice. It's unquestionably off-style for a double, but it's also unquestionably delicious. I'd be much happier calling it an ""American Double""; a lighter, hoppier version of its Belgian cousin - and to that end I'd argue that it was brewed perfectly to-style!  No matter how you label it though, it's a fantastic brew. This one took me totally by surprise and I was quite happily blown away."
"Overall interesting, nice malt balance, hops are UK style herbal earthy hops but not the kind I hate so decent, but not enough of the Belgian malty flavors or esters IMO."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with rather punchy carbonation that explodes as it flows down. I have to say, a Dubbel in a can is pretty awesome and this is an enjoyable brew. Glad I had the chance to sample it, thanks smokeypeat!"
"Pours a hazy light brown with some yellowed hues. Touch of white head. Good head retention. Smells lightly roasty and malty. Some yeastiness on the nose. Tastes yeasty and malty. Lots of sweet roastiness. Overall not that tasty but okay. High carbonation. A bit off-putting. Very drinkable but not that enjoyable"
"Would not seek or even buy this beer."
"drinkability: smooth and easy to drink considering it's 7%. I wouldn't really call this a true dubbel style, but it's good and consistent."
"O - a great local staple, and recommended for any beer fan"
"O: I think I enjoy trading just because I get the opportunity to try beers like this. If I'm ever in the area, I'll be drinking several more of these. This is a damn good beer."
"drinkability: very well done, complex and complementary elements, decent yet not overpowering, very drinkable."
"O: hands down my favorite beer. reminds me of home, and tastes exceptional. made me a fan of english dubbels without being over bearing or specific."
"Poured into a New Belgium snifter. It pours a medium bodied nice reddish copper in color with a one finger soapy cream colored head. The aromas are of aluminum, pale malt, and caramel malt. It's hard for me to get much because of the aluminum. The flavors are of slight aluminum, caramel malts, mild yeasty spice with light dark fruits. Again, the aluminum is a little too prominent and takes away from the actual flavors of the beer. This beer is exceptionally smooth and has a near perfect body. Overall this seems that it's a beer that should not be canned and should remain in the bottle. I'd be interested in trying this one from the tap or out of a bottle."
"Overall, a very good beer, to be taken slowly and with consideration."
"One of my friends, who digs this beer said it best, ""It's an Un-Belgiany, Belgian ale, for people who typically don't like Belgian Ales."""
"I'm having trouble fathoming that this is from a can. So good. SO good. It might not be a world class dubbel, but it's a damn good one, and in a can."
"Overall: This is an enjoyable take on the style. The flavors blend together well. It's also fun to drink Belgian beer out of a can."
"D - Impressive... Rather quaffable, dangerously so given the 7.0% ABV... A solid all around American interpretation of the Dubbel style; and in a can to boot... A pleasant surprise and welcome introduction to the Brewer's Art..."
"Mouth: Lots of spices meets a mild, almost ESB like hop presence. Not overly sweet... like a total ""American-ized"" version of a Dubbel, some cinnamon, baking spices but dry, hoppy finish. Strong, coating mouthfeel. Actually quite a nice marriage of old & new world brewing. Glad I went for the 6-pack."
"Big thanks goes out to Lunch for this in a past trade. Served from can into an Orval goblet. Poured a deep red-orange with a half finger khaki head that subsided to a minimal amount quickly. Maintained excellent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, dark fruit, and wheat. The flavor was of sweet malt, dark fruit, subtle alcohol, and subtle wheat. It had medium feel on the palate with mild carbonation. Overall this was a pretty decent brew from a can. It was fairly complex and refreshing as well. The dark fruits were definitely the star of the show on this one. This one is definitely worth trying for sure."
"This one surprised me. I'm happy I have another."
"On tap at a beer tasting event in MD. Poured a dark, cloudy orange caramel color with a tall creamy off-white head. There was a sweet malt aroma and a little bit of spice. The initial taste was sweet with a light taste of alcohol present. There was a little bit of a spice and nutty flavor as well. After the initial taste there was a bit of a dry mettalic taste that deleoped into a bit of a hop bitterness on the finish. I liked that this wasn't overly sweet. The hops on the finish blended well through the sweetness leaving a nice feel on the palate."
"D: I love having a beer this good brewed this close by."
"D: Another comforting beer from Brewer's Art, rich and lush even with the higher booze content."
"D - for 7% this is pretty drinkable. very good stuff, I'm interesting in trying this again."
"Don't know about this one. Thin taste, thin mouthfeel, definite sugary quality, to the point that I would've mistaken it for a macro. Actually, the closest reference point I have for this is the St. Pauli Dark I had on Super Bowl Sunday, very similar in taste in character. Decent enough, but I don't think I'd rush back for more."
"It's my first review!!"
"A nice, easy-drinking Belgian, and from a can no less. Not really what I would think of as a Dubbel, and nothing overly unique about it, but a nice, solid brew."
"D - all good until close to the swallow. this literally just falls apart from a decent beer into somewhat of a mess. perhaps the can has something to do with this? what do i know..."
"D - Ugh. Even the taster was too much. There's no way I could drink 750ml of this, even if I was desperate. Takes the intense sweetness of a barleywine, adds more types of sugar, and ""balances"" it with fruity Belgian yeast. Not much of a dubbel."
"A very big thanks goes out to grownfool for sending this extra, which was on my wants list. Resurrection pours out a clear rose color, with a quick to fade white head. Bready malt in the nose, followed by some mild stone fruit such as grape, strawberry and some cream in the finish. Big and juicy up front as far as taste goes, with the fruit that was mentioned above. Toward the end it gets much dryer, with a graham cracker like bite, and more full of esthers and yeast. Body is medium, and although the alcohol can be tasted, it does not take anything away from the drinkability. This is my first beer from a brewery I have wanted to try for some time. I am not the least bit disappointed, as this is a very tasty, and complex Dubbel. Looking forward to trying more from these guys. Cheers"
"D - Medium to light bodied. Not too expensive."
"Notes: While nothing particularly outstanding this is a nice and reliable ale. Good for an uncomplicated malty sweet offering with some dark fruit touches."
"D: This was pretty good. I didn't have incredibly high hopes after having some other canned Belgian style beers (Siamese Twin and Monk's Blood), but this one exceeded expectations."
"Note - Resurrection is one of only two canned Belgian-style dubbels currently available in the US. The other is Siamese Twin Ale by Uncommon Brewers in Santa Cruz, California."
"D - A very enjoyable American version of a dubbel. A bit on the mild side of things in overall impression - flavors and aromas are a bit on the lighter side, but still quite good. Not going to rival the best from Belgium, but a worthy beer that I wouldn't mind having again."
"Overall, the nose was solid and I thought this beer was going to be good. However, the taste just didn't put up the flavor. This one is not very drinkable and something I will struggle to finish my 12 oz can."
"Poured into a chalice a very nice grapy color, nice carbonation, very nice two-finger plus foamy off-white head, with some nice thick/creamy sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, slight yeast note, grapes, slight cherries, with some spice note. The taste is sweet, malty, nice little touch of yeast, grapy, some cherries. Medium body. Drinkable, this is a fine brew. So far 2 for 2 with them. Recommended."
"HV"
"Basically, this beer is middle of the road, in my opinion. I believe that there are many better examples of the style. I have another bottle in the cellar and I'd like to have this again. Hopefully, I will have a better experience the next time around."
"The crack of the top exposed yet another craft CAN filled to near the brim. We certainly get our money's worth from the micros in a CAN. My pour netted me a finger of rocky medium- tan head with low retention. Color was a ruby-reddish deep amber with NE-quality clarity. Nose was rich with spices and dried fruits. It smelled like a holiday fruitcake - cinnamon, nutmeg, lemon zest, prunes, apples, all overlaying a general yeasty mustiness. Mouthfeel was medium-to-full, approaching a creaminess on the tongue. Jeez, but this was dry! The spices were what really came through on the tongue and then translated to a breathtakingly dry finish. The fruity esters on the nose really got lost in the overall flavor, which is too bad. Overall, it was not a bad beer, but it would not be something that I would want as a steady diet, nor would I want it in my cooler in the summertime. Maybe on Hula In the Coola Day ..."
"d: An excellent dubbel that comes in cans for $11 a six pack. I love the American craft beer scene today. The U.S. is the the beer capital of the world, no question."
"Drinkability: Another tasty beer from Brewer's Art. I've had several of their offerings, and they've all be very solid - this one is no exception. Give it a try if you can find it."
"While I could sit down pick out the individual flavors, this just lacked a definition to it which hurt the overall complexity of the profile. Instead, this just came off as a warm sticky mess at times and failed to keep me interested during the duration of the glass. It's a shame, as I was really excited to try this, seeing at how this is the second Belgo-American Ale to get released in cans that I know of. I think that I'll stick with a Monk's Blood next time..."
"Overall not a bad beer by any aspect, but a rather non stand out from the crowds."
"I'm confused by this beer. The smell seemed to fit the bill for a dubbel, different than many but still within the ballpark, but the taste is out there. The bitterness is overdone and overwhelms what sweetness there is, which is not enough to begin with. At the end of the day I think this is just off and out of balance. It's decent, but in need of tweaking."
"Poured from a 12 oz. can. Has a dark caramel color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is mild, some spices and yeast. Taste is good, yeast, spices, a bit of hops and a touch of alcohol. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and has average drinkability. Overall this makes for a decent brew."
"drinkability: fine"
"D: Taste was good from the start and kept getting more complex and interesting. Very easy to drink and enjoy it's depth."
"d - A pretty nice dubbel. Lots going on in the taste but I really liked it. I enjoyed the sweet smell and taste and thought the smell was very balanced. Would have liked it to be a little less carbonated. Would try again."
"D-quite good and drinkable for 7%; I can't really taste the alcohol too much; very good example of the style and having it local in Baltimore is a plus"
"Overall this is quite an enjoyable Belgian Dubbel that is full in flavor and easy to drink. Another fine beer form Brewer's Art. Recommended."
"Oh well, it was worth a try. I won't seek it out again."
"Drinkability is very good, a nice dubbel for my taste, with enough sweetness to counter the spicy esters, full of character yet still highly digestible. Very well done, I've been really impressed with the four Brewer's Art beers I've got to enjoy so far. Thanks again John!"
"Not a bad beed by any stretch however it just didn't live up to the hype from people who have described it as the best beer of all time. Had a frothy head and a big white head. Taste was intense with wheat. I was overwhelmed by how much wheat was in there. It had also a mixed taste of spices. Was a bit dryer then I would have expected. It was a good beer I wouldn't have minded having another of however it wasn't the best beer I had that night."
"Review from notes taken on: 12/18/09."
"This is my first beer from Brewer's Art and I don't mind saying that I am impressed. I'd like more please!"
"So Drinkable I had two despite 100+ other choices available. I'll have more on my next trip to Baltimore."
"Pours clear copper with an out of control head. Smell is fruity and phenolic, with apricot, pear, quince. Flavor is fruity, apricot, all spice, apple, a little vanilla. With nice bitterness at the end. Mouthfeel is slightly clingy, but way overcarbonated. As it warms, strong brown sugar and toffee comes through."
"Drinkability- I really enjoyed this brew. It's very easy drinking and has an amazing mouthfeel. It definitely doesn't have the intense sort of big flavor that most dubbels have but I think I'd prefer this. Just a nice beer that was an even nicer surprise. Thanks!"
"D - It's tasty, and is nice to drink. Not to be had quickly, though."
"Picked up a bottle at State Line Liquors in MD for about $10. This is a dubbel? OK, the Brewer's Art website calls it an abbey ale. I can live with that. The beer poured a clear amber with a white head. The flavor falls a little flat for my liking and the malts remind me of stale bread. There is a very pleasant dry bitter finish that bring this beer back from the edge of mediocrity (which really isn't too bad in this style). It's very drinkable and the body is right on for the style."
"D- Can drink these all night. But beware, the alcohol sneaks up on you!"
"An amber color, small head. It smells sweet and thick like molasses. Upon taking a sip, it tastes like quality tobacco leaves, some sugar and barley too. In the mouthfeel in addition to the aforementioned flavors, I come across vanilla beans. Drinkability is good on this local Maryland beer."
"Mouthfeel is nice and soft, not quite fluffy, a bit sticky. Good but not great."
"Interesting brew had travelling in Baltimore. Pours a reddish brown with a light tan head and some decent lacework on the glass. Not much in the aroma department, but detected a little fruitiness, but then, I have a weak nose. The taste with also a bit fruity, with a cherry like tartness, a little clove zip, and a little yeastiness. Finished with a warm, resiny hops. Realy enjoyable progression of flavors as you drink. Has some complixity, but very drinkable, and comes across almost like a session beer for the dubbel style."
"D: enjoyable, delicious, nostalgic"
"Edit, 3-12-12: Had another bottle of this (also thanks to my brother-in-law) this past weekend. Bumped down the mouthfeel score, as it was overly-carbonated. Gentle pours still resulted in geysers, and it had an impact on the drinking experience. Otherwise, still a decent effort."
"Pours a cloudy pale yellow color with a nice white head that stays for a while. Smells of sweet belgian spices just as any other belgian ale would. Tastes good, I've had this beer many other times before, it has a typical dubbel taste, nothing too special. Sweet citrus hops, smooth alcohol flavor, and good maltyness. Mouthfeel was nice, crisp and refreshing, drinkability... the same, went down well."
"D - This was the second bottle that I've had from this brewery and I must say they do a very good job at making Belgian style beers worth trying sometime"
"A: Loads of carbonation on an easy pour, after 5 minutes of sitting the beer is still settling and with a solid centimeter of thick foam that climbs the edge of the glass, lots of fine sediment, the color of a opaque iced tea - 4.25, S: Significant spice and alcohol are the most notable aromas, some orange peel, slight bubble gum - 4.00, T: The alcohol is very prominent, nice spicy zing, noticeably hop bitterness, a little woodsy - 4.25, M: Nice smoothness to the beer, medium bodied - 4.25, D: Another impressive product from Brewer's Art, a very nicely crafted beer that I'd happily drink again - 4.00"
"4.0 D: I'm happy I have 750 ml and not 12 ounces. Nuff said."
"D- excellent. I can see why so many people in the Baltimore area consider this their go-to beer."
"Pours a cloudy, deep burgundy and amber color with a solid half inch of off-white head. Aromas of pepper and clove, sweet caramel covered pears, and light, spicy phenols. On the palate, this one continues to be quite spicy with a moderately large body, thick mouthfeel and medium carbonation. Very creamy and smooth contributing to a high drinkability. Not nearly as good as Le Canard, but still a really nice Belgian from a brewery (American even) that does a damn good job of making Belgian beers."
"Rerate: On tap at Brewers Art. bumped up the numbers a little bit - I really enjoyed this one better the second time around."
"Drinkability: A really solid and tasty is strange dubbel, which seemed very ""dubbel-esque"" at times, and not so much at others, and it definitely took a while to get used to. When I'd grown acclimatized to it, however, it came across really well. Alcohol is reasonable - perhaps even a little low for the style - and well-hidden, and everything is else is perfectly pleasant."
"I could drink this all day, its a pretty good beer, though the alcohol might be a little to high for that :) I don't want it to sound like it's too sweet, but it is quite sweet, if that makes sense..."
"visited the brewpub after a week in Columbia"
"d: a really interesting belgian mongrel with a lot of dry flavors"
"Pours a clear amber. Flavor is whoa! Not exactly working for me. Too much bite and too much acid. It says loads of sugar have been used in this one, but I can't tell at all. Feel has a full carbonation. This just doesn't do it for me. Too leafy, earthy, unbalanced, and lacking character. It's a decent Belgian style, but I just don't dig it."
"Enjoyed on tap at Mahaffey's in Baltimore. Thick layers of lace on cloudy amber.Yeasty aroma including some funkiness. Some sourness. Some hops. Balanced, not too sweet. Alcohol detected of palate.Interesting though there are many very good examples of the style."
"D: a very enjoyable dubbel, there are some alcohol flavors there that remind you of the strength but the flavor profile is very interesting."
"Drinkability--hides its high alcohol content well. I could easily drink too many of these at a sitting."
"The alcohol hit is heavy, as a percentage of the beer but it's completely hidden in the brew so take it easy when drinking these."
"To sum it up, Brewer's Art Resurrection is a well-crafted beer that is deceptive to the palate, but does pull a strong punch. While, this is a fine beer from an imaginative brewer, had I had it at Max's, it would have been easily overwhelmed by a good majority of the many fine Belgians I enjoyed during the 72 Hours of Belgium. I recommend an occasional stir just to keep the flavor alive."
"Very pleasant to drink. I was suprosed with the alcohol content and that this was a dubbel. It seemed like more of a brown ale, with stronger fruit and malt. Very pleasurable to drink."
"Long story short, a very tasty beer I'd love to try again, preferably at The Brewer's Art."

"Drinkability; Very interesting take on the style and I love the finish; can't wait to try more Brewer's Art beers at the 10th Anniversary dinner tomorrow"
"D - Pretty good. The bitterness started to get to be toward the end of the brew, but nothing severe. I definitely enjoyed this one, but I feel it is vastly inferior to the Proletary."
"Decently drinkable, but not nearly as good as I remember it being."
"Drinkability: very enjoyable and for me a nice after dinner beer. Simply a must try if it is available."
"This beer wanted to get out of the gate fast, almost spinning its wheels, a bit frantically really. But it got itself under control, and at the end of the pint I realized I enjoyed it. The ABV never came through at any point, that I noted anyway, and that was a good thing considering the sometimes herky-jerky flavor ride. And while I did move on to something different, I'd have had no qualms about having a nother of these, because the end result is tasty. It might have a bit of an identity crisis, but it's enough to me to look this way again."
"Drinkable? Is that even a question here?"
"Highly drinkable. Should have ordered this first, best of the three I tried at Brewer's Art, easy going down"
"Tatse was sweet but not overly sweet and the aromas come through in the taste. Its medium bodied, smooth and finishes sticky sweet in the mouth. alcohol is well hidden. Overall very drinkable and enjoyable."
"Beer is good. Happy beering."
"Pours a dark orangish brown with a big lasting beige head and good lacing. Smell is plums, raisins, tofee, and chocolate. The same flavors come through in the taste, with the dark fruits dominating, and a nice hops taste coming through on the end. Full bodied and creamy, this is an easy drinker. This is another great Belgian ale from the Brewer's Art, and there's good reason it's their most widely available offering."
"Browned, tarnished copper penny in color with a half inch or so of a bubbly, semi-dense head. Alcohol soaked fruits -- raisins, plum skin, prunes -- some cocoa, and some nuts fill the nose. Some nice spiciness as well. Similarly fruity flavor with a sprinkling of cinnamon or allspice and a more solid caramel taste. A bit dry and maybe woody, there's some clove to this as well. A very nice rendition."
"Still, very drinkable, and 7% allows for more than one glass."
"Drinkability is really good. Really nice mixture of malts, spices and bitterness. Well made beer."
"I reviewed the regular version of this on tap previously. This was better on two counts. First, the blackberry added a nice tang and brought the color level from brownish to a nicer garnet. Secondly, as cask conditioned, the mouthfeel was especially pleasing with the bubbles softer and fewer."
"on tap, poured a solid dark brown, medium bubble head of about 1/2 inch and left some basic lacing. Malty, nutty nose. Malty brew, medium bodied and average carbonation. Not sure why this is characterized as a Dubbel, what I tasted was more of a brown ale with the slightest touch of Belgian spicing. In any event this is a pleasant brown brew. Smooth and tasty"
"I paired this up with an appetizer of Four Hour Port Wine and Charm City Sour Cherry Ale Braised Pork Belly, Toasted Garlic Chips, Poached Shallot. I suppose the sour cherry ale would have been the more appropriate choice, but I am hardly ever appropriate."
"Dark amber color. Frothy off white head with lasting creamy lace. Slight sweet malt nose.. very slight. Small bitterness upfront followed by sweet caramel malt. A nice beer but nothing over whelmes, A little light on the tongue with a slight ABV sting. Soft finish. Good but missing a little something.."
"I must say on 1st try opf this beer, I really can't detect the ABV presence. I mean w/ something like 7%, I would expect a hint of something. But this was a pretty good beer. My non-BA loving friends really got into this stuff, so when we went out, we had some. Not much hed retention, and almost no lace. dark amber hue. Hints of indecernable fruit prescence, strong malt prescece, and some nice hops for a finish. Smooth and clean, nice crisp beer that is extrememly drinkable and should be had by all"
"One of the best US brewed Belgians I've had. They bill it as a Dubbel, but it reminds me more of a dark strong ale. I've had this both at the brewery and from my own tap setup here at home. Pours a deep brown with a frothy silky head. A lot of malt and fruit flavors with a nice sweetness. Some hints of rasins too. Well balanced for its ABV and has a nice crisp finish with no lingering alcohol taste. Overall a very solid offering from this excellent brewery."
"This beer poured into the glass a gold/hazelnut color that was visually cloudy, that when held to the light you see red and orange hues through out. It produced a beige/lemon color that was thick and creamy in nature, lasting fairly well then subsiding to a small covering and a ring along the edges. This ring helped produce a thin and spotty lace down the glass. The aromas that came from the glass were of sweet malt, big sweet dark fruits (cherry, raisins, plums), spices, wood and some alcohol (light). The tastes that rolled across my tongue were of dark fruits (cherries, plums, sweet raisins), malt (sweet and dark  both mixing together), spices (licorice, cloves), deep wood (like an aging barrel), and some alcohol. It left behind a semi-sweet spicy flavor on the tongue that was very pleasing. This is one complete and balanced beer, from the flavors to the aromas that they produce. Pleasing to the senses and packed full with flavor - all in a single sip or wiff. Very enjoyable and will be looking to get more. All around great beer."
"I recently had this beer on tap at Max's in Fells Point. It's a very impressive ale and extremely drinkable despite the alcohol (warning!). I found it somewhat similar to the S.N. Celebration in body and impact although the hop content is far less. Stylistically, it's hard to place-Belgian in origen but very Americanized."
"The body is a cloudy deep copper/ mahogany with an orange cast when held to the light, but it appears much darker and reddish when sitting on the bar. It's creamy yellow-stained ivory head holds well, eventually drops to a nicely creamy collar, and leaves some thin lace throughout the glass. The bold nose expresses lightly sweet and fruity (raisins, prune) malt with a touch of wood and spice. Some alcohol adds to its aroma, but it's really well-engrained and never imposes. The mouthfeel is lightly zesty at first due to its very fine and gently effervescent carbonation; and it becomes creamier as it warms, enhancing the firmly malty body. The flavor is rich and seductive. It starts with soft dark fruit and sweet malt up-front, including notes of raisin, plum, and cherry. It's not tart at all, and the fruity notes blend flawlessly into the sweet dark malt. As it warms in the mouth some woody character becomes apparent. It finishes dry with a mild sweet malt followed by a light spiciness (some clove; maybe a very mild touch of anise?) and then some residual oak. Extremely well-balanced, flavorful, and complex. Immensely enjoyable and highly drinkable! Well worth seeking out for the lover of Belgian-style beers!"
